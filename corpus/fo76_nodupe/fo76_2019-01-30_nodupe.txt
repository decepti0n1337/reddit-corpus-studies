I agree....
---
---
---
I will test this out in a bit. I didnt notice this earlier using my lever action but that sucks if true.
---
I ran into a Mr Messenger on the way to Morgantown that had the same problem.  No module to be found anywhere.
---
I’m not sure what you’re doing wrong. I’ve got an anti-armor automatic laser rifle I just modded to fuck around with on my normally sniper-stealth-vats main and I am melting shit with it, and I’m not sure but I heard anti-armor was broken on energy weapons.
---

---
I’m also melting the gun, but it’s fun when it lasts.
---
i even scrapped bulk, and it does this.
---
I completely agree that it needed to be reworked, but they went about the wrong way and for the wrong reasons. 
---
The first fix should have been the stacked explosive bobbleheads exploit which caused most of the grief with PvP and people taking the queen down in 1-2 hits.
---
People online were showing screenshots of weapons doing 55k+ dmg, which was 100% an exploit issue, not the TSE themselves.
---
Its called Version Control. Its a basic tenent of software design. Along with a QA team development actually LISTENS to.
---
Its clear, that Bethesda lacks BOTH of these things. 
---
That IS the problem, and the solution is to manually scrap the bulked mats you need for your repairs.
---
No screenshot? Kinda sketchy if you don't include proof.
---
I think all beers do as well. I always make sure to have the perk that tripls their effectiveness, for that +3 to strength/charisma. +6 strength if its whiskey.
---
Keep that toxic attitude to yourself. I dont care about a nerf but 75 percent is a bit much. 
---
Factions would be great, but it'd be hard to make much of it from a 32 player cap per server. 
---
You assume what i presume. 
---
Your feelings of my thoughts are solely your feelings. Im sorry i couldnt convey myself more appropriately, but i think you have mistaken my feelings.
---
and the tears keep on flowing, its like 60 percent of the people playing are 5 or less years old
---
Not a good look for the silver shroud gear. Should have been quest related reward.
---
Wow, how are those useless TSEs doing damage??? /s
---
I can't use my bulked items. Not even if i take them from my stash. PC IGN RizingToBe
---
The only major thing is the nerf to already overpowered weapons and adjustments to perk cards, the game has gotten necessary fixes, there’s still reason to log in.
---
You need good weapons or a team to farm the golf club.  I did events until I got to about level 40 then made a point to hit it every chance I could get.  Then acquire better weapons and mods with caps by a lot of farming.  Watoga station is a good place to buy for better stuff.  
---

TSE may have been powerful but I'm seeing people running around in pvp now with one shot mole Miner builds and insta kill swords. TSE honestly just evened the grounds for overpowered close range by providing a long range option. Now it's melee or nothing. While I think TSE did deserve a Nerf I think that a 80% debuff was far to high. I've rarely ever seen a mmo make the end game weapons weaker than a level 20 common weapon.
---
My exploding gatling laser seems to be be doing quite well, 1-2secs for a lvl 68 ghoul 
---
This is so easy to say, but in the alternate universe where they pushed back the release six months, the games media bashed all the supposed assumed bugs, trashing the game nonstop, and when the game releases and it STILL has bugs (because open world games are complex and games pretend it's just a fancy game of chess) everyone would scream that the developers obviously did nothing but add premium content and trash the game.
---
Face it, games are in a no win situation today and pretending they aren't helps nobody.  I dont like bugs, but I also dont expect bug free experiences in Bethesda games because tracking the world state of a game the size of West Virginia is a way more complex problem than running some ai monsters over some geometry.
---
That's not shilling, that's realism.  I'm happy to be playing the game, not screaming about the bugs.  Just another example that this game was made for people like me, who love open worlds and are willing to accept glitches in the matrix in order to get everything else.
---
Oh yeah?!? Well DOD GAMN it, my Rocket Girl costume no longer appears over my armor, so with the weird melding between my suit and my leather armor, it now looks like I crapped my pants.
---
HOW IS THAT FOR SERIOUS PROBLEMS? How am I supposed to be taken seriously in game now? Huh? HOW???
---
Are you throwing popcorn at me!? 
---
Oh that's just your TSE...
---
First, sorry about whatever else is going on in your life. Stress has a way of multiplying with each new little or big thing. 
---
I didn't have a good legendary until about level 60.  I don't know what I used when I went there, but I do remember it was pretty rough. ... It was supposed to be.  
---
I got a 2 shot explosive handheld a while back. Blew myself up several times. I actually just was getting used to it and even liking it. 
---
I can definitely tell the difference. Just encountered a couple of high level gulpers and it definitely took longer to kill them. Hardly the end of the world though. 
---
My guess is that Bethesda will tweak the power just a little. 
---
You sound like a Bethesda employee who spent all day getting drunk and trying to forget about the mess you made. 
---
what a nightmare... 
---
Dude I know. I earned my shit. Dont render it useless though...
---
Bro it’s an economy, if it’s more common it’s only logical to increase the price, it would be worse if they kept prices the same as pre patch and made them available whenever a player wanted, everyone would just have everything, cut them some slack.
---
Awww. I feel so bad for you
---
They should at lease be removed from decision making roles. If they are good coders, why lose them just because leadership is not their thing? 
---
But allow them to keep making leadership decisions? Absolutely fucking not.
---
Awesome. Nice to see it is running better for lower end PCs
---
Would you prefer to have a new update every single day to tear apart and bitch about? 
---
I assume if you were asked why, you would just parrot the "it's a reused asset from another game" talking point?
---
sorry couldn't screen it, it only showed for a second after i clicked play, other people are sure to have seen this by now
---
I meant all 3 perks maxed
---
I believe I had 2 with 1 rank each so +20% plus max bloody mess then u have the bloodied mutation and rarely go about 50-60% hp so however much extra damage is...
---
I could easily get my 2SE HM up over 1300 by being around half hp and get a couple kills for adrenaline to kick in 
---
I could kill a lv 80 SB with 3 shots of my pump without a prime receiver
---
Explosive is 20%, stupid.
---
Who out there doesn't use Power Armor already? Seems like an odd fix.
---
Mantaman suit FTW. But the suit doesn't properly take up the glove slot so under armor or your hands can clip through.
---
Exactly it has literally been copy pasted from fallout 4.  No effort put in at all
---
"Finding things to do on your own" won't keep players in the game. I ran out of quests to do a month ago. I've explored most of the map, have 3 sets of power armor, and a nice camp. I've done everything I wanted to do in the game. So until more content comes along, I have no reason to play anymore.
---
Camden park and Welch station also spawn the mods (still random per server) buy yeah Camden has every single plan.
---
Well leveling up, I had a stead group of 4-8 people so killing things wasn’t the biggest issue.  
---
Though I was a melee main until I managed to get my first TSE.  None of the other guns could even compare to a melee build, which unless I’ve missed some melee nerfs, is going to make melee the star of the show again. 
---
This is about half an hour for me every morning or after I leave work. I spent a while farming up the skeleton outfit plans and now three of those pretty much clear a vendor for the cost of fifteen plastic and some cloth, if I recall. Just saying with a little up front work you can make your 1400 (less expense) pretty quickly. 
---
Did you try turning it off then on again?
---
PvP is a good change of pace but yes this game needs more and better PvE like yesterday. Been saying this since the first month.
---
Suck my dick you hum bug. I farmed it and they provided it. I get nerfs but that was outlandish. 
---

---
Yeah, reading that response - which I duly Reported - was painful. Absolutely cringeworthy, in fact. 
---
Damn, someone is a bit angry.
---
Chill, it's just a videogame.
---
On PS4 this morning I bought a plan for a small water purifier at the Charleston vendor because it wasn't marked as known, when I read the plan after buying it I got an error message that I already had learned the plan and then the plan updated to saying (known) beside it... 
---
Beware, not all plans that don't have (known) beside it are actually unknown. Kind of defeats the purpose of this new functionality... In case u/ladydevann wants to pass along this occurrence to the devs, I'm not running any other characters, just this one. On PS4.
---
How cute a cuck has feelings. 
---
Haha... why dont you quit whining about other people's opinions? 
---
I completely agree! It seems like all the fixes they choose are picked at random. The (known) plans fix should've been something the caught in beta not 3 months after the release. 
---
In March they are adding "Survival Mode" which is PvP servers. Adventure mode is the current mode
---
I am a melee build and IMO pretty powerful, that was still a challenge thought. But when I got that tse, I felt like god and if I want to feel like god I’ll go play civilization or something.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I felt powerful, but not fun powerful.
---
My only concern is fighting the queen. But then again, you should not be able to kill the queen everytime.
---
It will also push people to find more perk/weapon combos and be original.
---
Im also very happy they nerf the bobblehead staking.
---
Even I thought 934 dmg was a bit high, but at the same time it also took 20 total perk points to reach that much, which is quite a lot to dedicate to a single weapon.
---
im gonna see what the damage output is on my tse once i get home tonight..im seriously scared to look
---
I’m having this issue as well. I’m turning it off for now since I can’t repair any of my items...
---
!!!!!
---
So many times...
---
Oh and you have to compete in the SE and East half of the map consistently.  That’s where the badass critters exist and more XP and goodies will drop. But you need to acquire some legit weapons first or you are toast.  Don’t be the level 15 person hanging in the SE you will get worked.  It’s all about progression. 
---
If I'm more than double somethings level, it should be 1-2 shot easy.
---
wouldn't YOU like to see these things? It shouldn't be US telling you what your game needs... silly higher ups dunno whats going on. 
---
Goddamn it.  A reasonable response in a sea of rage.  
---
Do you have the bloodied mutation also?
---
Im not your family, friend or child. This isnt the only game I play and my time IS limited. Obviously you seem to think you have some authority or skill that makes you better. So what level are you? I can see by your posts, you only play this game. It's not about being OP, it's the issue that you build something one way but by random opinion, it changes. So let's say you are on Social Security, for 10 years, but for now tangible reason it is taken away. You are saying you would have no right to complain?
---
I guarantee you and everyone you know would, period. 
---
why on earth would a nuclear detonation mutate animals into grotesque creatures out for blood instead of just killing them?  Why on earth would laser weapons have recoil?  Why on earth would a simple IV magically reverse the genetic and physical damage that massive radiation doses cause?  Why on earth can mutations cause people to jump onto rooftops and become nearly invisible like the predator when in reality 99.9% of mutations are negative?  Why can a naked player get shot even once in the chest and survive?  Why can a simple injection cure broken legs, gunshot wounds, sever burns and lacerations in 10 seconds allowing you to go right back into combat?  How are massive 50's era computers running on freaking tape reels for storage somehow capable of advanced AI far beyond what our modern technology can accomplish?
---
I can keep going on but you want realism in a game that is not even the SLIGHTEST BIT rooted in realism in any way, shape or form.
---
ffs man it's a GAME meant to be FUN.  Make PA have a durability edge over armor, fine.  
---
But increase non PA durability too offset the nerf to white knight that nobody wanted or asked for.  Cool?
---
it's extreamly versitile, and is very good. probally the best Rifle in the game. can be moded for both an assult rifle, and sniper very easily. and .556 is generally cheap to get, and make in 76. since the combat rifle can't be chambered in 308 in 76, I'd rate it below the Handmade.
---
I know, I’m cracking up!
---
Lol english is not my first language, sry ;-)
---
My TSE dragon went from neat 3000 down to 600 and my TSE lever from 1100 to 300. I get they needed turning down a bit but this is ridiculous.
---
Is it possible to play on PC with somebody on ps4 ?
---
So you add to it by complaining about the complainers.
---
 Problem is that although some people go way overboard, many people are offering valid opinions on why they are upset with the changes. For example grenades, mini nukes and missle launchers and now worse than than ever. I spent some time and effort to get a 2 🌟 mini nuke launcher. It wasn't an awesome drop but i liked using it, now it barley does dmg to higher lvl enimies and is out classed by my wood board w/ spike mod
---
Well why can i select adventure mode already? this gamemode selection screen wasn't talked about in the patchnotes 
---
Ok soo my regular two shot hunting rifle cant even oneshot a super mutant while sneaking...
---
Despite all the incoming nerfs, this seems like a good patch overall.  I feel they may need to tweak some weapon stats to make up for the nerfs but that's a balance issue not a coding issue so shouldn't take too long to get sorted out.
---
Wait, 5th amendment? How are you incriminating yourself? 
---
Me too
---
I've never even seen the recipes on there, just the serums themselves.  Is there a separate vendor?  I'm glad we can buy them, honestly.
---
I posted this question recently. Will find it and post a link. 
---
I'm playing on PC.
---
RadAway not on, so it's not it.
---
I don't want to use RadAway as it will cost me 5k caps to get a new serum and I already paid for it, so not willing to pay again just because Bethesda f\*cked up their latest patch.
---
I expect them to fix it and soon a this skill is essential to my build and it didn't say anything about planned changes to mutations.
---
Really annoying.
---
Well, MODUS occassionally has them.
---
It’s because it was off topic. It’s not that difficult to see. 
---
FO76 has never not been broken.
---
Doesn't it seem like everything they do is half assed?
---
Now all of the sudden lock picks are back to 0.1?
---
Like what the fuck...? 
---
I hated destiny but then again it isnt bethesda so who knows? Maybe I will buy it. 
---
700 hours into a 3 month old game and im the cuck? Jeez. If someone was banging your wife would you even realize it?
---
Not even gonna tell you what you're gonna see. Lol. 
---
I love this game, I genuinely enjoy it! I bet you do too, you ARE defending it after all. But that doesn’t put you in the right, you are the problem with the fo76 community! You can’t accept any criticism of the game or it’s devs, you push it away as “hate” when. it. is. the. truth! You need to accept this, or not, but you should.
---
Additionally, plans drop from events and near power armor stations. You're not forced to buy them from a vendor, it's just one way to be certain you can get them. Farm caps or farm plans, either way expect to grind... That's how MMOs work.
---
Not even gonna tell you what you're about to see lmao
---
Same for me.  If you scrap the bulk item you can use it.
---
Don't bother with the equality tards, they can live there life like communists, see how that works out..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Explosive shotguns are still strong. You pare that with melee and you got something. 
---
Yep, RIP my level 17 alt-alt-character whose sole existance was to my weapon plans.
---
sorry, but weapons doing 600+ damage is what's outlandish.
---
😁
---
I was referring to the weight glitch. That has existed since Fallout went first person. 
---
The dupe glitches employed now aren't necessarily unique either. They've been used as far back as Ultima online. Roughly the same process of doing a series of actions that cause the server to lag and roll back progress to a checkpoint. 
---
Do you actually play this game or just shitpost about it?
---
You should. I took a 400-level course called "oil politics &amp; the Middle East" in undergrad with a professor who was a relatively prominent Iranian-American woman who nobody recognized til midway through the class. We read an awful lot of books for that class, and after the years I only remember "The Prize" ...and it's coincidentally the one book I recommend most from my undergrad in history days.
---
Does your wife realize it when you're banging her?

---
I dont agree with the p2w statements but you need unique outfits.
---
4 ppl with the garb is 15 hp. 3 ppl need to buy from the shop to get to 60 more hp.
---
15-60 hp isnt "winning" regardless hence its not p2w
---
I was hoping to find some infos stating otherwise... but it seems we still gotta hop servers for x-01 mods... still need 1 calibrated shocks...
---
On top of that, i asked for a reasonable solution, none was offered. Just a backhanded comment. Also i was being facetious, obviously you are not as mature as you believe yourself to be. Just another keyboard warrior, safe behind your screen.
---
And how many hours have you spent playing it?
---
Or maybe I meant games I already own? I do have lots of those, too.
---
Or does that not fit your sarcastic, edgy little narrative?
---
That sounds like a good investment of 5 points.
---
Its ok, better weapons will exist with higher levels available above 50. You may have farmed your stuff legitimately, but most were duped and capable of 1 shotting everything. 1 bullet from a handmade shouldn't equal a Fatman mininuke. And now it doesn't. A lot of the player base was exploiting the overpowered nature of these weapons, in PvP and PvE. They are still ahead of most weapons in damage unless you specialize in bloodied. It's ok.
---
Pretty sad how many things they have broken in this update.
---
A lot more than that. 
---
I may be in the minority, but I think they should not have included mod plans in this. 
---
I'm totally up for base weapon, armor, and functional camp item plans being readily available from vendors. However, I think mod and cosmetic camp item plans should only be available as random loot and rewards from events and workshop defense. It gives people something to hunt for and another reason to do events/capture workshops.
---
Quite a few, I don’t have them on-hand, but a good couple hundred 
---
So can we at least get some info on future nerfs? Its kinda shit to grind for something that just gets nerfed shortly after. 
---
Small potatoes in the overall mix of pluses and minuses, but: Apparently there's a limit to the number of personalized screenshot/loading screens you can have on consoles, but not on PC. I enjoy these, since they remind me of achievements and memorable moments when I've taken a  photo.
---
The only thing I really use plastic for is to bulk though.
---
.45 ammo takes gunpowder, lead and steel.
---
I have leather armour.
---
There is something else I use it for but I don’t need it often so can’t think of it.
---
Maybe the odd gun when I get a new plan and want to craft?
---
Can I have your stuff? 
---
Bob pin weight back to 0.1.
---
Bulk junk needing to be scraped before using the components on craft.
---
Both were modified and wasnt around on the last patch.
---
I’m pretty sure Phoenix in Watoga has them.
---
It still sucks that they increment 10%/15%/20%, no matter how it gets calculated.  Returns diminish way too fast after the first point.
---
Excavator skins! I don't even care if it's just a package of "Yellow becomes red, or blue, or white" or whatever. ANY variety whatsoever for the game's signature power armour would be very, very welcome! 
---
Where can i find gaitling gun plans?
---
its in ‘advanced connectors’ plan or whatever its called
---
Thanks for being decent. But you're right. It's a relatively new game still. I'll go back to mele for now I guess
---
I genuinely don’t get why so many are upset that weapons no longer disintegrates the biggest and most challenging enemies in the game like common radroaches, at most they just need to fire a few more shots.
---
Bruh. Me too. Grape Mentats for the win
---
Haha I feel you, explosive build myself. And I agree, I said to another user that it's truly semantics. However this is the first money = in game boost we've seen(even if it is temporary), while everyone else is talking about loot boxes. 
---
&gt;	even destiny wasn't this bad, and that's a big statement.
---
Not that you would have known that from /r/DestinyTheGame... the salt there was as concentrated as here, easily. 
---
New engine, new story and a new platform... They could save the franchise. Give em a decade. I would love to see on in Seattle. 
---
Bro I server hopped for 1 day and found 3...
---
Upvote this post since I'd prefer so many more weapons and builds to be viable than Bethesda nuke-balancing all the weapons until all thats left is a bunch of burly men in power armor wailing on a giant bat with sledgehammers.
---
I don’t care whether someone buys it or not, but it’s pretty obvious to see patterns for downvotes on the sub many times. 
---
People who post solely to gripe on subs often get downvoted, especially when off topic. It’s a message built in to say the comment doesn’t contribute. 
---
I’d expect to get downvoted on a sub if I said I liked box art, thought about buying it, but didn’t. It’s like telling a story about why you chose oatmeal or cold cereal this morning in a nutrition sub. Yeah it might matter, but it doesn’t. 
---
I am level 90 and my regular shotgun does less than 160. I am supposed to be able to slaughter you, but with that tse gun I still don’t stand a chance. How is that right?
---
So less ppl on the server means his pc is able to raise his gfx settings?
---
Does that mean if everyone quit he could go to ultra?
---
Oh I didn't know stacking explosive Bobbleheads was "playing this game". My mistake.
---
I think that since they are making such a big change to the build mechanics, they should offer a free leveling respec, or mayne offer one in the atom shop or something.
---
I just bought that but am unsure if they are any good?
---
 and im the dumbass? Why spend so much time on some thing if it's broken? 
---
If you're a duper or like one-shotting everything with a TSE including Queens, good riddance to you.
---
If not, good bye. This game is probably dead in less than a year with the lack of events/content.
---
How could you know? So let me just lay it out.  In 1977 I started training as an Electronic Engineer.  That's before the internet.   By 85 I was working on the largest integrated systems in Europe as a software engineer.  By the mid 90's I'd reached Senior Mgt level in my field.  I've worked for some of the largest companies in leading roles.  Oh and I can recognise a complete arsehole when one utters a word.  Next you'll want my CV &amp; LinkedIn profile.
---
Do you use subversion or GIT for your code base ? Might explain what happened 
---
4k for both tse. Shotty and SMG +1k for the 3k ammo on the smg
---
Ahhhh "dear diary, today was a good day"
---
Would potentially give ppl an advantage. Could be seen as pay to win.
---
all the toxic bs is uncalled for you're the morons that need to quit the game. the point isnt that you cant kill everything the problem is if you do a build based on your best weapons and now they dont work like they used to you have to grind 40-75 levels to changed all the perk points and builds to get a new setup but wait........by the time you do that there will be another patch and the revolving door keeps spinning
---
I wonder how many dupers are gonna rage... They are gonna have to make weight real fast.
---
The Inspector and Manta man are physics enabled, which is damned cool.  The cape and coat-tails move and flap around with you.  The textures are also really damned nice.  I love the Shroud, but these two costumes are really well-made.  Just wanted to put that out there for those who didn't look at them carefully.
---
Looking for two of those and a med pump.
---
Grinding in-game I can understand but bullshit server hopping is definitely not a great gameplay mechanic.
---
No other char. Reading some forms it is actually a mod messing with it. About to uninstall said mod and try again.
---
If you have two xboxes you can create a second account then add it to your family under settings. It will share your Xbox gold and any digitally owned games. People use this to share games with their friends and only have to buy one copy for multiple people, but that’s not what I use it for. 
---
I think it'd be worthwhile for Bethesda to take a look at how some other online-only title handle things like respecs and balancing, at least in regards to the community.
---
And you're incapable of spelling out the word 'without', thus defeating the entire cynical purpose of your comment. Oh well. 
---
What's crazy to me is that due to it being pointless often times the only reason to pvp is to grief... 
---
A player has no idea if you have valuable junk, and even if you do they could just as easily farm it themselves. So if they really wanted to pvp they could just come to kill you to grief. It happens already with camps.
---
Yes! Thank you! These patches are ruining the gameplay, not helping it.. wtf.. so funny. Keep it going. 
---
It was a massive buff. Wish they could nerf it as hard as TSEs
---
[removed]
---
I run marsupial on my sniper build just for the jump distance. Hop up onto something the mobs cant get on top of and pick them off. 
---
Well, time to go get some worms I suppose. I was only spending 92% of my time in Whitesprings; now I'll be there 97%.
---
That's all very, very cute. Pardon, but I'm going to just going to giggle away and go play the actual game that, strangely, I am not having any trouble doing alleged half damage where it's impossible to trigger serendipity.
---
Pat yourself on the head for me.
---
One more big request that still needs to be filled is the ability to name power armors or some other means to differentiate them in inventory.
---
Would you like some cheese with that whine?
---
If everyone quit that would just be Fallout 4 but with no NPCs. 🤔
---
I’m going to go with Yes, absolutely. 
---
Bye
---
I’m saving mine for some power armor camo, but yeah...that would be cool as long as it isn’t like 2000 atoms. Like 300-500 would be grindable in a week casually. 
---
Thank you.  Will give that a try later tonight 
---
Just remove the 25k cap on CAPS 🤔
---
Tl:dr
---
Fanboy
---
Pretty sure this is just a reused asset to represent a bronze ornament.
---
Was your camp right next to the golf club?
---
600
---
Yup, you’re a troll. 
---
It's not just a fallout game. It's an online survival fallout game. You're right, at high levels, your need to farm and scavenge to handle the survival aspects should be lower (or your ability to farm be more efficient), but it shouldn't be removed entirely. I went from having to farm for ballistic fiber daily, before level 40, to I haven't had to make any effort to look for any in over 80 levels. So they nerf it, it's still a reduction over not having it, and they lowered overall repair costs by like 20% in the last patch anyway.I Willave to farm for it more now? Probably. Will I have to farm nearly as much as I did at level 30? Definitely not.

Hey bud, impartial observer here. I'd take a short break, maybe get some water or a snack. Come back in like 20 and reevaluate your comments.
---
600. 
---
Because I enjoy the game, I don’t care if it is broken, in fact I think some of the bugs can be funny at times, but others are simply a hassle to deal with. Also some people *cough* *cough* are a hassle to deal with.
---
Stash is 600
---
Yeah, it seems like this *should* be the fire rate.
---
It seems i often see the med pump. If i come across it again i ll let you know.
---
Ebay gave you a sense of accomplishment?
---
How much are they
---
Maybe next time talk about the games you actually mean, and nobody will be left confused  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
Yes, if you pay the token number of caps (usually 20-40), you just move your camp and lay it down again in the same spot, EVERYTHING is back up to full repaired status.
---
it's considered a distant melee relative after all.
---
and that's all the devs care about, melee.
---
Working for me on food and ammo.

**Besides right now,  I won't ever use this account to comment. This will be the first and last time. u/Atomic_Andrew is my main account. This comment will be deleted soon.**
---
Still waiting for stash limit to go up. I'm board and fed up of my character being permanently over encumbered.
---
Do you play solo?
---
I fire a lot of shots to take down Super Mutant mobs. The ammo grind is a little lame.
---
I don't understand why someone needs a Super Sledge to smash a radroach or why they don't need to grind for ammo.
---
They still have not increased carry weight and did not give us unlimited storage, in fact they just did the opposite! So most of my friends and I will not be coming back to Fallout 76 (STILL). Also no increase to C.A.M.P. size and it still has that stupid budget. Then they ruin how plans are bought from shops (Should have stayed random!). Still kept the shared faction shop caps (Caps should NOT be shared between shops)! Another sad day in fallout. 
---
They come with this excuse  (These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy) We play other actual mmo survival games with way more players on a server then Fallout 76. These have unlimited storage and way more inventory capacity and options (Companions and pets) and have little to no problem with performance and or economy.
---
Again very sad day that we were hoping we'd be coming back to Fallout 76 but instead they push us further away. GREAT JOB BETHESDA!
---
The Scrolls of the Eldest
---
It is a little annoying because with Class Freak 3 it reduces your stats by 1.5 instead of 1, which messes with a lot of perks and creates more bugs like flickering carry weight numbers.
---
RL money market sellers likely have several accounts with full mules. Would merely take logging in next to the other account and only dropping as needed.
---
  
---
The big timers still have a lucrative stock that just increased in value (excluding TSEs). 
---
I mean, I'm ok with the fix. It devalued quite a lot of things. But yeah. It's not a fix for the biggest offenders. Hopefully those accounts have their own kinds of breadcrumbs, as youtubers have had multi accounts banned.
---
Oh yeah no, the entire reason respecs are one point per level is to increase the time sink.
---
They want people playing, they make things take as much time as they think they can get away with. They need to balance fun with time invested. Its arguable if they've been successful so far.
---
You want to respec your guy, they'd rather you have to play for a few hours more, instead of just hitting a button or something.
---
Righto, I will remember that thank you. I guess that’s what I get diving in the deep end lol
---
Super mutant. 
---
Too bad, you could have learned a thing or too. Let me know if you need help moving out of your parents basement, fam...😉
---
It's makes one wonder, do they even play their own games? Anyone with a decent amount of playtime who has messed around with explosive weapons should know how weak they are. Explosive weapons shouldn't NEED the demolitions expert perk to be just slightly better than bad. They should be pretty good on their own seeing how expensive the ammo is and how heavy it is up until you get the carry weight perk that doesn't unlock until level 31! The Demo perk shouldn't be in line with the other perks because explosives aren't in line with the other weapons! Three quick super sledge attacks are the equivalent of one pre-nerfed fully perked rocket blast with slow reload (and of course the risk of hurting yourself because most enemies in this game bull rush you)
---
The inspector outfit is good also for men?
---
So 10 jetpacks for 2 CS ?
---
The only materials that weigh less, per unit, bulked are lead and aluminum. If you are bulking anything else, other than to sell it, you would have the same result by just throwing the 2 plastic per bulk on the ground.
---
the fact that it has no microtransactions makes legendary in this day and age or did you never learn the nuances of reading to pick up what i was puttin down 
---
I agree that it’s a shitshow, an enjoyable one, but some of the things we are trying to push are big concerns, like bulk not working, or thing breaking way too fast in some cases. One great example is the Gatling laser, one core then it breaks! And with the tse’s they were 100% OP, but Bethesda hit ‘em **way** too hard
---
Lol, well enjoy it while you can, they will be sure to promptly *try* to fix this since it offers some benefit to the player. When they fix it tho, they will only fix the good  parts.
---
Theyll probably put a rush on it if that also affects xp bonuses
---
hehe
---
Which is funny because I was up against a guy with a TSE handmade last night before the patch and I one shorted him 6 times in a row in monster mash then 3 times afterwards when he sought revenge.
---
Stealth sniper with anti armour and a dense chest piece means he didn’t have a chance.
---
Thanks for the reply. I’ll delete the thread
---
Haha...
---
I bet they have no way to do it.
---
Bad, but better than not having it at all. 
---
Can you fix VATS so I can move with my non standard config?
---
I can do that, I'll double check to make sure i don't already know it when i get home
---
If they come up with a frankenfurter costume I'm in for atoms. Hell even if they had a rocky costume ;) nothing like a golden briefs wearing wastelander going full unarmed crits on a deathclaw. Glorious
---
Indeed, this nerf hit me right in my Pyromaniac induced feels.
---
Love the hand made I have a 1 star furious version, drop a hardened receiver and drum mag and u good to go.
---
I never said you were. Destroying camps placed next to the golf clubs back doors is a common practice. 
---
Yea I’ll let you know if I do. I’ll pay for your plane ticket too since you’re family man just make sure you have someone to take care of your kids 🥰
---
I just spent 2k caps for a plan. I want to die...

---
I’m gonna go take a shit now. Just so y’all know.
---
I have a gatling plasma. You are a liar. It totally lasted for two cores before it broke! ^_^
---
I have to disagree - unless the fundamental function of a perk is changed, no skill points should be refunded.  Balance changes that don't change the function of the skill itself does not warrant a refund of points/etc.
---
It’s very similar to the theme song from the old TV show “Bewitched”. https://youtu.be/jdNhPUXf6Lc
---
Might be nice to see more people that are there for the game itself. Less people just trawling for eBay fodder. Though they need to release some actual content. That survival mode sounds good for PvP and PvE people alike but things to do are starting to run short. 
---
So what weapon do I use now to get high base damage? Playing field can't possibly be so leveled that everyone's weapon build is just ehh?
---
So just take however much plastic you were going to use bulking other stuff, and bulk that plastic instead. Then go sell the bulked plastic. You've saved the same amount of weight, and made extra money in the process.
---
For high ammo consumption weapons I understand that problem, they do need a buff, but for the shotguns doing 1000+ damage, it isn’t that terrible to fire 2 extra shots to kill a behemoth, that is where I think the nerf isn’t an issue.
---
Its a mf joke bro
---
I'm gonna upvote you because it's sad to see such a positive point of view with so many downvotes, but let's be realistic:
---
They will NOT rebalance "everything", not for a long shot. If a weapon is too weak like the gatling laser they might buff it (bear in mind they have not buffed a single weapon since release) but they will probably only focus on the most important targets like Scorchedbeasts' and Queen, IF they do any enemy balance at all which hasn't been their priority as of yet.
---
I don't think the explosive perk nerf was that bad but let me get this straight. Explosives are really ammo hungry and costly to craft, and grenades are so bouncy happy they are hard to land even with perception perks (not sure they work properly, their damage gets nullified often with no cover in sight). Explosives already are vastly limited by the OHKO self damage and stamina cost. A fully upgraded explosive build costs 5 special for damage, 2 for range and 1-3 for accuracy (really hard to land otherwise because of bouncing, mines and grenades take so long to blow enemies just walk away from them). To fully upgrade to prevent self damage, you must sacrifice a chest mod and 3 points in endurance for Fireproof. 
---
Right now only for my explosives I have 5 points on Intelligence for damage, 3 in Perception for accuracy and range, 3 on endurance for self damage, a wasted chest mod slot (and I'm not sure if the heavy weapon antiarmor and crippling stuff works on missile launchers and stuff but they might do but let's forget bout them).
---
That's 11 points on one of the most resource hungry builds in the game (and 15 Carry weight) for something that isn't even that good. Is not the most perk based build for sure, but it has so many downsides compared to any shooting thingy that it doesn't need to be in line with others. Because if the damage is in line with a rifle we'll just have to stop using it at all, because the damage doesn't justify the cost.
---
Bunker Buster weights 40lbs, each shot weights 2lbs. Look at the gears needed to shoot that thing for 10 seconds. It needs at least damage, it already sucks at everything else.
---
Interesting, I can actually work with this. Time to dust off the bloody explosive gatling
---
Well it kind of depends on lvl and mods, but usually it is only one core
---
Bethesda Fun Police at it again. It's all about THE GRIND! We have to make the game even more tedious!
---
We’re a dedicated community on a sub forum. Ofc were going to be opinionated. The fo76 didn’t seek us, we seeked it.
---
Nah lmaoo that's a waste of caps imo
---
Dude some people just don't care. There has been many posts saying the same thing and a bunch of sour bethesda fans boys just attack the player
---
Crazy!  It's working fine for me now.  Good luck!
---
Melee hasn't changed; still 2-3 power shotting Scorchbeasts of any level, and 2 shotting level 91 Deathclaws.
---
I was trying to transition to a shotgun build since it uses the same amount of Strength/Agility but guns are probably shit right now.
---
I'm honestly quite a devotee to the game and have spouted a lot of wait and see.
---
I agree with needing a big nerf, maybe even "larger than it should be" at least in short term to devalue its excess. 
---
But you dont do that while adding no other weapon balance beyond clipping the wings of already broken weapon types.
---
Big nerf with energy weapon adjustments making them useful? Fine, cool, at least there's options.
---
But here we are again with rifles shotguns and pistols. Everything else is bugged.
---
 
---
I want to play the game. I'm going to enjoy it when it's fixed. This just isnt the right kind of dev path to take when approaching the laundry list going forward.
---
It's disheartening.
---
Watoga BoS vendor for sure it’s around 800-1000 caps
---
I don't think it's bad customer service or bait and switch, to think they would make no changes to the game is crazy, I'm fine with the changes, you just have to adapt and overcome, sorry that you guys can no longer one shot everything but it doesnt mean you should get your points back.
---
.45 lever action rifle with hardened receiver, maxed out rifleman perks and maxed sneak.... 2 shots max almost any non-legendary in the game if you are undetected. 
---
They will, sooner rather than later hopefully.
---
At least one person on the dev team must get that a complete respec option right about now would save them from weeks of being burnt by the internet and maybe even stop a few customers leaving completely and becoming walking adverts as to why you tube was right and fo76 sucks.
---
It probably should have been done before the nerfs start hitting yes, but if there's one thing we've learnt over the last 3 months is that Bethesda make great single player games and are really crappy at making mmo's.
---
No they didnt forget, they simply dont care. It doesnt affect pvp so they wont do it.
---
not acceptable. giving an in-game advantage of any type for items that can't be acquired in-game is pay to win
---
Have you done or found any testing to see how much damage is reduced or found the formula? I'm so curious about this!
---
Can you get robot companions?
---
Doesn’t matter anymore, with the new update they have destroyed the already shitty game.
---
its shit, and I'm done for a long time.
---
My legit found TSE combat rifle with perks spent a LONG time earning went from 266 to 73.  Literally my least powerful weapon.  My pitchfork does twice the damage.  So long and fuck this shit.
---
How could they have not seen it coming? I've always used gaming as 'cheap" entertainment. I can think of many things to spend irl cash on. Unfortunately, I don't see this ever changing. There is always someone who wants to pay to play.
---

Same rock
---
People will downvote you but it’s true. 
---
Maybe they should hire some of the amazing mod creators as an emergency crew.  Pretty sure they could clean this mess up. 
---
They had a 3gb patch for xbox today that fixed the bug! I got a email from bethesda saying to try it out, and it worked! FINALLY!!
---
&gt; you only brought it upon yourselves. 
---
Many people did, but I'm no exploiter. I'll admit the single TSE weapon I bought in the last month is very likely duped, but I didn't know at the time. I wasn't just going to toss out something I paid 2.5k caps for.
---
With that being said, I never bought another because I didn't want to support duping. I never once used stacked explosive bobbleheads because I knew the only way to reliably buy them was to go to someone who was likely sitting on millions of them and that pissed me off. 
---
You're right though. Melee weapons will get their turn with the "balance" stick and all the people laughing at gun users right now will be crying just the same in a month or so lol.
---
How much? I only need 1 and I can provide mats...
---
mmmmhmm
---
Yes, you would.  You have way more faith in the gaming world than I do.if the ANNOUNCED release date was a few months in the future, giving proper time to develop, maybe it'd be OK.
---
But announcing a release date then slipping it... there were already hyperbolic hate articles being written based on prerelease stuff, slipping the date would have opened the floodgates of speculation and shitshows.   The games media want clicks, and hatred on a game is always worth an advertising eyeball.
---
Also, you have way more faith in game development management.  People here have this fever dream that a slipped date means that backlogged items get caught up on, but that is NOT the case.  Work items always expand to fit their container, and any bugs not critical enough to fix at the end of the year wouldn't have been critical enough to fix now; instead, more "features" would be injected, and all the game balance data would still need to be collected, and the exploits found by the community would just now be discovered.
---
Look, buggy games are bad; the slapdash way AAA companies sell broken stuff on the promise of patches is bad.  But this idea that their bad behavior would be less bad with a slipped ship date is not reality.  Neither is the idea that the games media wouldn't latch on anything to make it a shitshow.
---
Look, people wanted New Vegas, and still wanted New Vegas even after being told the game would not be New Vegas.  They were told there would be no human NPCs, and it would be multiplayer.  All the hyperbolic screaming about bugs and whatnot doesn't come from people caring about bugs (the worst dupers are youtubers doing the duping) but from jilted gamers who know a good thing when they see it.
---
No amount of delays would have changed 76 to East Vegas, and no amount of delays would have made Zenimax behave.  We have the best game we were going to get, and at least I'm thankful they are bug fixing it.
---
This isnt an apology,  just a statement of reality.  Its industry wide, not just 76, but bashing 76 gets the media the pennies that high concept analysis doesnt, so nothing will actually be fixed at any publisher.
---
No instant gratification? IM HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME KEEPING IT 100 WHEN I CANT GET WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT &gt;:(
---
Thanks for your unsolicited snark, you're extremely original and funny. You can go now.
---
I would also like Ballistic Fiber to now only come from killing the SBQ.
---
But what about the phat lewts precious hmmmm? What tasty morsels did she drop? Some exploding vents and unneeded ultracite body part plans?
---
If it makes you feel any better, as misery loves company. 2 weeks ago I got my first tse lever action at level 96. Suddenly went missing out of my inventory when I fast traveled doing a quest. Was totally bummed out and angry. 
---
Couple days ago I found another player selling a tse Gauss rifle. Completed my 2nd trade ever, and paid 1500 caps for it. Had a damage of 380 with my build. Was awesome. Used it for ONE NIGHT. Now after the nerf, it’s down to about 160. Which is 100 less than my super sledge. Fuck. 
---
Perk manager is updated works now
---
Yeah same happened to me while I was there, I know better than to engage but blocked and report. I am almost tempted only to build stairs and foundations which can't be destroyed to make fun of these dick bags, that will show them .. and store everything else ..
---
Yup
---
I want more ways for our character to look post Apocalyptic (see FO New Vegas box art) with the cheesy skins sprinkled in. Right now its mostly cheesy skins with no skins that fit the actual narrative and setting.
---
I can't remember what my damage was pre nerf but it was way higher than 68. They nerfed the living shit out of this gun and it wasn't even a TSE.
---
350 hours of play and I've only had 4 good drops and my favorite just got buried.
---
I'm done with Fallout.
---
Bloodied Explosive Gat has been my SBQ weapon for a long time now-
---
Mr. Handy buzzblade is the new weapon benchmark.
---
Will there be another stash box limit increase in the near future? If so, how large of a range would it be increased?
---
Exactly!
---
I've done a couple cap stash runs to test since the patch and it seems like it is hit or miss on which cap stashes you can actually search. But I've had this same problem with pharma farma, the medical box under the first desk in Watago medical center comes to mind as an example for me.
---
I definitely thought favoriting an item would make it unscrappable. I was so wrong. 
---
True. For a moment u actually could enjoy the the game and not needed to farm ammo all the  time
---
What level is it, 5?
---
Armor piercing is where it's at now.
---
I've got me an audiobook and a long trip to listen to it on in my near future.
---
bloodied melee is untouched,so probably that 
---
they will make it cost 25,001 caps, and players can only hold 25k, so we'll all look at it like 'would be nice to buy' and BGS will be like 'oops, will fix in 6 months'  rofl
---
Yes! 
---
Weekly hot fixes are not that bad. 
---
PS4 on rest mode and it updates automatically. 
---
Also why do I no longer know plans like the broadsider and laser Gatling...
---
Which are no longer available because the really stupid unnecessary price hikes, I have hard bargain and 9 Charisma and the broadsider alone is 1359 caps.
---
I was an automatic rifle build with explosives maxed as my secondary. My best and only gun was the TSE Handmade powerful automatic. My nuka cola quantum grenades did 600 damage and my TSE did 450ish. It now does like 125 I think. My M79 and my grenades are also weaker. I had poured the rest of my caps into the plans to make the handmade and the lever. My points where 6,10,4,9,14,7,6. Everything I have been working on or with has been nerfed. I hate this patch, level 51 playing since December 29th 
---
Rip. In. Peace TSEs everywhere 
---
Searching for audio here and sorting by newest posts shows that a few people are having serious audio-related issues with this update, but there's not a lot of discussion about it.  
---
It is much easier to walk away from the game without sound... which may be a blessing in disguise (I play too much)... but still, I'd really really like it fixed. Grr.
---
Yeah, those are selected for me too, and the scrap armor one didn’t progress even though I scrapped stuff. 
---
Nail on the fucking head. My jaw dropped when I read that. How the fuck does making it  _worse_ not make it a mandatory pick. If it was mandatory to start, that means it's because the parameter it is affecting (ie carry weight) needs to be BUFFED, not the other fucking way around. It's not rocket science. I don't get how their logic works. 
---
Maybe they should all stop developing for like a week and just play the game for their work day, cause it seems like the devs have yet to even touch the game (understandable since they are probably spending most of their waking hours fixing it). 
---
that extra 45 hp for a few days  https://youtu.be/V4MF2s6MLxY
---
Hey people are doing something that is fun and rewarding. Nerf it!
---
Improve the PVP System, but keep it as a game dynamic. 
---
This game would be bland if it's just PvE. No fun in that.
---
yes I am looking for that.  Are you giving it away?  I blew all my caps on plans today  lol
---
fusion core generators too
---
As has already been pointed out, there is no free option for full bonus, and Bethesda did make it very clear that microtransactions would be cosmetic only. Your insulting exaggeration is... well, exactly that.
---
No body gives a fuck about pve! Stop nerfing everything and fix the real problems!
---
Wait did they patch all platforms at once? I thought they were still doing PC first and consoles after a few days
---
Were you using a TS weapon? I noticed similar behavior with my TS lever-action, I assumed it was viewing the second bullet as a second shot; that behavior might have been changed with the 2-shot damage adjustment. 
---
Handy!
---
I really want some new hairstyles that aren’t so silly looking. A nice ponytail, or some long hair or braids or something would be great.
---
They shouldn’t be removing cap limits. It’s a good way to keep things regulated 
---
Super sledge just became the best weapon in the game.  Nicely done Bethesda.  I had a nice 50 cal w/100+ damage now it’s been neutered to 50.  Pathetic.  My 2 shot non duped shotgun spec’d our at 350 now 125.  Goddamn super sledge standard is 145 damage lol.  
---
at least borderlands 2 had a endgame !
---
Yep. :(
---
This may have been actually implemented. I have to test some more. However earlier on when I was testing out weapon changes I seemed to be missing a lot of 95% hit chances. 
---
Explain? 
---
Workshops at least you can build a stash and benches. But in the bog you have to repair missile turrets on the fly, or at fort defiance. If u sont bring junk with you now you're screwed. 
---
You should've lost your patience a few weeks ago. 
---
You don’t remember, have I misinterpreted the before: 58 part in your post?
---
Either way I’ll just say keep your chin up, it’s frustrating to see you gun nerfed I’m sure, but with the benefit of the plans being more available I’m sure the games economy will change. Balancing online games take time.
---
I wish I saw who it was, there's nothing I can do now and that's really shitty. Whoever did it has no punishment and gets away.
---
Lol GL 
---
Well, we did collectively purchased, or are using someone who purchased this game. Without a playerbase large companies died. I'm going to look into what Bethesda's stock is at this point.
---
... does that mean you can’t trade it to someone else now? ‘Cause that’s bullshit
---
Good point.  Because everyone complaining is obviously a filthy fucking duper.  I'm glad you guys can be the shining example.

On xbox I'm jumping HIGHER than marsupial normally does, more like I'm in a team with 2+ people when I really am not.  No complaint here considering the nerfs as of late.  
---
Hmm..what would be the lowest DPS built? I know, use up all 50 points with defensive perks and weight-reducing perks as well as durability perks for armor, melee and ranged weapons, and Power Armor. Also max out AP with various perks. Put 15 points in strength to boost carry weight, and don't put any points in damage increasing perks. Then use only the pipe pistol, unmodded, and let me know how you do against the mirelurk queen.

I don't have trouble farming the items myself either (I find a server with a nuke and pick the flux, but your costume idea sounds real smart too)

My sticking point is the same 200*7 caps every day with an arbitrary wait between...

I just got a chance to log in.

My explosive radium rifle that I spent the last month grinding for mods.....
---
It does 63 damage with 5 levels of Demolition Expert.....58 without those 5 card slots.
---
This is bullshit!!!!
---
Ye I ran the same tests you did. Completely ruined my build.
---
Now I can't farm caps, but still they want me to buy a recipe for 22.000 even with the 25.000 limit. Any of this make sense.
---
Np, enjoy
---
They can't remove the cap limit until they get eveyone down to a decent weight.  Someone could just sell on his duped inventory from all the mules and end up with multiple characters with 25000 caps
---
Really? God of war was pushed back. Red dead redemption was pushed back. How'd those games turn out. They blew the doors off this piece. So no time of a push back would help? Why were red dead and god of war the most loved games of 2018 and fallout 76 was one of the most ridiculed. It's a reality with quality studios there's just less of them. 
---
I’m with ya there man
---
I almost didn't post this... 😋
---
Berserker legendary effect allows you to do crazy damage but only at low damage resistance. The build I want requires at least 1 piece of legendary armor, but I want to get that legendary effect attatched to the lowest DR item possible.
---
I see both sides of this. My weapons lost hundreds of damage, some lost thousands. Balance needed to happen, even of it was immediate and stark. It's an MMO and will have more options available, and more weapons with far greater enemies. A tip is to replace demolition 5 with demolition 1, and move the points to agility for adrenaline. It's more rewarding, but not as powerful. 
---
No but it is the start of it. 
---
I believe OP is expressing ire that the supposed Co-op content appears to be sidelined for more PvP content
---
T60 as well on PS4. I've got the Vault Boy light I bought from MODUS for shits and giggles. My Nuka t51 with kinetic whatever in the torso isn't tagged though. 
---
Oh by the way - nice purchase nerfs too at Watoga station.  1500 caps for radium rifle plans are you nuts?   Please tell me that’s a joke. 
---
Just checked this and thanks so much! All the plans!!!! 
---
Anybody know where to get the underarmors?
---
I agree, INCREASE THE BASE DAMAGE AND MAKE THE PERK CARD ONLY 3 POINT SPEC INSTEAD OF 5 (DEMOLITIONS).
---
INCREASE LASERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRS DAMAGE AND PLASMA.
---
MAKE IT EASIER TO OBTAIN AMMO FOR THESE WEAPONS. FUSION CELLS AND PLASMA CARTRIDGES ARE HARD TO FIND WHICH IS BIZARRE.
---
ADD LASER COMMANDER PERK
---
ADD LASER KNIGHT  PERK
---
ADD PERKS TO BOOST ENERGY WEAPONS THEY ARE USELESS BEYOND BELIEF. YOU KNOW THIS.
---
Honestly more worked up about them reintroducing duping again
---
Can you refrain from posting until you get those periods figured out? Kthx

You’re lucky, I was about to notify jones bbq and foot massage for copyright infringement 
---
The post is here because I can't even fucking open the damn game after the last update ffs
---
Sadly, you are not wrong. Despite all of that, I'm still having a blast with it. Albeit a nerfed blast.
---
ophidia31
---
People still.play this?
---
I thought they made it very clear that their main goal in the game was to restrict you in every way possible.
---
&gt;  how does this happen
---
I'm torn between incompetence or sabotage.
---
For the love of god, they need to stop nerfing everything willy-nilly and fix the reasons things like this are a mandatory perk instead
---
Its not a few hours more though is it? 
---
Bethesda, the only dev team who's respec options take longer than levelling a new character!
---
Thanks man. One of the reasons I've enjoyed this game is players like you. 
---
That's funny I have 3 TSE weapons in the game and they were given to me by friends who play more then me I have the handmade, shotgun and harpoon gun. I do still go back and forth between my firearms though. Most days I'm running around with my non explosive weapons then a scorchbeast comes round and it's time to break out the TSE handmade. Those using TSE as their primary is funny because I see it happening in the forest area. Wow congratulations you one shotted a LVL 3 liberator bot. I can do the same with my LVL 35 9mm pistol
---
Bye

"The dev team is aware and are working on literally anything else"
---
Remove only some at a time...
---
I have good luck with my legendary Auto Grenade Launcher but I'll have to see how it does after this patch.
---
any ETA on meaningful end game content? i wish there waas more to do other than Scorchbeast Queen and whitesprings...
---
Bloodied+unyielding melee still does 1000+ dmg. Guns with either two shot or explosive (not both) are really underwhelming now.
---
Yes I have a few good things to say. Known plans. Good. Vendor items. Good. Chem weights fix. Good. Cap stash nerf. Bad. White Knight nerf. Bad. Some other nerfs I can't think of right now.
---
industry insider spotted
---
Yeah along with this patch that punishes players who grind for powerful weapons. Lame.
---
No more infinite carry weight? Well I quit. See you in the next fallout game. I really wish they just made a option to play offline so I can do what ever and have fun with non of theses restrictions. 
---
Best thing I can recommend is to do Forest events. I've gotten some pretty decent leveling gear from events there. A few three stars. There's one that starts up around Tyler park (Ferris wheel) about kill the wolf packs, it can get you up to 4 different legendaries at low level. 
---
Sounds to me like you’re whining about no longer being able to take advantage of server hopping..
---
Let me know when we get there, then I will get angry. But a passive boost that is intended to promote team play is hardly worth getting bent out of shape over.
---
I wonder if they even notice that now they’re turning off a lot of the people who actually play the game. 
---
Forget about trying to get people back, they’re just making more people leave. I don’t understand how they can break a game so much in one patch. The TSE nerf is the least of my concerns right now when I thought it’d be my only concern. 
---
The nerf is fine, but hey let’s break 10 other aspects of the game while we’re at it and not say a fucking peep about it. 
---
Actually less than 60%.
---
Ballistic guns like lever action, or handmade doesnt get all the 60% bonus. The percentage is only true to explosive weapons like fat man.
---
My completely non scientific "wander down the rail road tracks and see what they have" in the Savage Divide didn't show much diversity between vendors. 
---
Oh good. Thanks for pointing this out.
---
Yeah I’ve been playing since beta and I’m at level 77. Just doing mostly the main, side quests and some events. I guess technically I haven’t finished the main quest haven’t launched a nuke yet. Do that after I get all my treasure maps taken care of maybe. 
---
&gt; I mean you did build your entire character around a currently overpowered build in a new mmo
---
I have a heavy weapons/explosive build. Before this patch my character was much more expensive/less competitive than other builds. Now my character that I have put 200 hours into is even more useless. 
---
I'm thinking of maybe switching over to Ark.
---
Wanna come with? 
---
While you're at it, can you look into actually fixing the reason everyone takes White Knight? Not everyone wants to use power armor but regular armor breaks stupidly fast, how about buffing regular armor?
---
So your protest at Bethesda is playing another Bethesda game....edgy!
---
Grafton station u can get shadowed armor mods and deep pockets too before update
---
Demo expert was as much of a band aid as Shotgunner, Rifleman, Commando and other weapon specific cards for their respective weapon categories. Every single explosive weapon needed damage and durability increase across the board before the nerf. It needs even more now. If what you say is true then the only thing they have achieved by nerfing demo expert is reduced impact on explosive weapons and that is kinda pointless change. It's not like people are gonna build around some weapon without using perk cards that boost it's damage. Also what do you mean by "properly"?
---
I'm plenty capable. Just sometimes the way I type I'm thinking about like 5 words ahead and a word somewhere comes out with a typo. Criticizing typos (especially typos that spellcheckers don't pick up on) is one of the most useless types of criticism one can give.
---
Boo hoo
---
you may think of it as your weapon, but it's in their game, they can do what they want with it
---
People will be happy when the game is fully functional and half of the patch notes isnt obviously reproducible bugs.
---
Like, what is there to be excited about in this patch, "YAY THE GAME IS SLIGHTLY MORE PLAYABLE!". Its literally a bunch of QoL updates that should've been there from the beggining.
---
TS was already nerfed. It can’t hit shit because it gimps recoil and hip fire accuracy so bad no mods can reign it back in. 
---
This was hidden by the explosive AoE spray and pray of just spamming TSE’s
---
With the explosive part now toned down, **not hitting** with the actual projectile is going to really sting for the TSE mob. 
---
Bloody good riddance if you ask me. Bloodied dual-stack heavy &amp;rifle was always the much higher damage road to go, if you’re tall enough to take that ride. More than TSE, and more than melee. 
---
Duly (adverb) ;  in accordance with what is required or appropriate; following proper procedure or arrangement.
---
Shit, I spent hours server hopping just to find brick wall plans.
---
Jesus, huge update. Too bad the game wasn't patched like this day one.
---
Nice, good suggestion!
---
Bethesda is just teaching us not to complain.  I can see Todd saying "that'll teach them".
---
Good bot
---
So do you plan on upping the vendor's caps limits or increasing  the maximum caps from 25k or do the devs intended for us to spend days grinding for enough caps for a single plan? I'm level 212, I enjoy the game and have spent a lot of time on it but I gotta tell you this totally kills my urge to play. It seems like every update makes the game grindier.
---
#teamLeverAction! 
---
I love mine. 😁😁 I have a trouble shooter handmade I use for robots. Everything else is my lever action.
---
Aaaaaand explosives are useless. 
---
Currently at the penitentary
---
Since the hige nerf this will be the new norm. Enjoy it, its what the community wanted and beth made it "balanced"
---
Oh, thanks for the update. I have this mod as well and this problem. Time to get rid of it, I suppose.
---
And this game is governed by minority’s that never stop bitching just like society 😂
---
&gt; costs more that 1 ballistic fiber. 
---
Didn't they also make it harder to find ballistic fiber with the last patch?
---
WildStar was pretty rough.
---
&gt;  Missile launchers were so underwhelming already, now they are just paper weights. 
---
Really bloody heavy paperweights.
---
Well maybe sometimes the way devs are thinking about like 5 priorities ahead and a piece of code somewhere comes out with a flaw.... etc. etc.
---
It really wasn't a criticism of the typo though. It's just pretty damn funny when someone is making a generalizing, exaggerated statement about capability, and then they go and fuck up the one word that makes their statement the opposite of what they meant. 
---
And come on, you're talking to me about useless criticism? You didn't even make a critical point, you just shit talked lol. Stand down from your pedestal, sir.
---
Is this the new circle jerk thing for the week, ok just so i know i think i missed this weeks “What about Fallout 76 are we going to super overreact about this week” memo.
---
Energy weapons were already pretty trash before the nerf.
---
Now new energy weapons will be even worse :(
---
WHY ARE YOU LETTING A 10 YEAR OLD PLAY THIS VIOLENT GAME.
---
YOU ARE A  BAD FATHER.
---
WASTELAND WILL  NOT MISS A BAD FATHER LIK EYOU
---
Using the xbox one platform. Stash box shows 28 bulked wood 23 bulked adhesive etc, however repairing weapons needing adhesive or cooking requiring wood shows 0 available. I've reloaded the game several times to no avail. I've collected it from the stash and dropped it. Still nothing. This started right after the "fixes". Much time invested scavenging for these materials. I will absolutey not do this over. This has to be corrected or never again will I be apart of a Bethesda train wreck, which is what I would call this steamy heap of a mess. 
---
They already did in some sense, old bugs are back.
---
I'm trying.  But there's not much to hold on to.
---
Sorry but the negative shit on this sub is starting to get to me. Why not just play the game and see for yourself if you’re enjoying it?
---
I played for 6 hours post patch and other than a new crafting/bulk issue had a great time, as usual. 
---
Pretty sure Harper's Ferry
---
Dafuq does this have to do with Fo76?
---
I'm afraid that they're actually going to do it. Nerf the food/drink cards, nerf purifier rates, triple the rads you get, make you thirsty when you eat and hungry when you drink, deplete your health 2x faster when starving, etc.
---
Does a two shot explosive legendary suddenly do less damage than the non-legendary base weapon? Just how dead is dead? I suspect some people are viewing the TSE nerf as an opportunity to find a different but equally skewed build. I should hope this community reaches an agreeable equilibrium in the near future.
---
Ok thanks
---
I never extensively tested it myself but I'm pretty sure it does
---
Its nerf to garbage now, all those time spent trying get one, caps spent to buy etc, in the end Bethesda rewarded the dupers and hurt the legit players hard. Like I'm spent using perk cards to reduce weight to the point I can barely use damage perks and I was switching points into INT to get 5 star explosive demolition perk and that perk is reduced too, with it equipped I don't even see much of a buff to explosive weapons.
---
Not sure if this is happening to other people, but I keep getting locked into crafting stations at my camp. Without the option to back out.
---
Nah they did, first time ever seeing the handmade plans today. Lvl 200
---
I hesitated for about half a second before I bought them both, so you are absolutely correct!
---
Saving 15 percent at 3 stars is pretty lame.
---
To be fair, they prob needed the mats after whiteknight got nerfed lmao
---
It’s a complete waste of plastic, c’mon.
---
exactly
---
Not at all. It sounds like you don't bulk any of your mats I presume? Then I can totally understand that you don't see this as an problem. It now takes way longer to craft a single batch of bullets and you also lose mats when you scrap your bulk.
---
Have you met modus?
---
Someone one shot the Scorchbeast queen a few days just before the patch. Got really tired of the TSE and stacking bobbleheads Bs. Someone will find a way to do the same some other way Im sure, but the common method is finally done and over with. Thank you, Bethesda. 
---
God forbid some people have to use actual guns in the game. I love using my regular combat rifle that takes a couple shots to kill level 40+, I'm level 71. It makes sense, you take a few shots to die they take a few shots to die. Balanced (as all things should be). 
---
I was annoyed at defending things because of the TSE one shots or going to a nuke zone at Alpha because of another TSE one shot. It isn't a single player game, you can't just abuse the broken mechanics and have joy over another's misery. Really ruins the game. So I love this patch. 
---
My strongest weapon is a mole gauntlet that does more damage every consecutive hit and is 40% faster seeing speed. Great for tough situations, but not OP. Does about 170-200 damage depending on what armour I have on. My second most was a two-shot pipe rifle that did 180 damage, tossed that as it did only 112 after the patch, but I wasn't bothered much. Now my primary is my semi auto combat rifle that does about 62. Thank God for balance, maybe now I'll bother defending stuff
---
There you go again accusing me of a lie.  I see your also ageist.  Then you start on with the name calling again. Seriously your blood pressure must be making the veins in your neck stand out like crazy.  I am 60, I am qualified, I don't make up stories, I don't doubt your an arsehole.
---
Bethesda = A bunch of old crusty fucks yelling about a broken fax machine, then asking why there is window tint by the cabinet and don't remember they brought it and placed it there.
---
I like how they nerf the god tier until its worst then a mortal but left the god tier melee weapons untouched.
---
Unfortunately Bethesda has made it clear they don't really care about the quality of this game, don't fall for the sunken cost fallacy. If you're not having fun, play something else.
---
Yeah that was changed in the last patch but he should of recieved a bounty for stealing it 
---
Still waiting on raids. Like nuke deathclaw island and get a 100 foot deathclaw lol.
---
To be honest it's coming from a point of frustrating. Bethesda doesn't seem to be thinking ahead on anything (look at the simple things they fucked up like when they tried to stop duping the first time by just making artillery crates "withdraw only").
---
The problem is they do this again and again and again and again. Repetition of a behavior is a pretty good indicator that that's just how they are.
---
I saw your other comments... 
---
I feel someone hurt you... 
---
Probably with a tse weapon of some type...
---
Tell me where they touched you.  Lol
---
r/fo76bounties
---
Of those 72 "don't care" items I listed, were 30 of them worth delaying content?  No?  Then scrap that low level fix crap and get some content in.
---
The H1Z1 community said the same exact thing.  BUG FIXES, BALANCE, QOL!
---
Now H1Z1 Just Survive doesn't exist anymore.  The servers are gone.  The game is dead.
---
The dev team fritted away their time doing all sorts of things the community didn't ask for.
---
Finally the community got sick of it and left.
---
TSE nerf bad. TSE wasn’t the problem it was the bobble heads/perks making the damage 10x what it was supposed to be. What they should have done for the TSE problem was, make perks such as demolition expert not effect the damage same as the other perks. And for bobbleheads? Nerf them or something. It takes many players days, weeks to find these weapons and when they find them, they get nerfed. I agree that it is a step in the right direction but some of the nerfs weren’t.
---
I don’t think the prices are set in stone, I have seen for around 900 and my charisma is trash 
---
Yeah but right now I have hundreds of bulked resources.
---
I like the cleanliness of “bulk &lt;item&gt;”
---
Oh well, it’s not a big deal but just another big that shouldn’t be an issue in the first place...that the community can’t fix for Bethesda this time 
---
&gt; but PATCHING AN OLD VERSION OF THE GAME
---
Huh?
---
&gt; this very well seems to be the death knell for Bethesda. 
---
Hardly.This one game won't kill them. Hurt them, sure, but they will survive.
---
relog. they seem to have broken mutations.
---
Bethesda mo ron
---
Is THAT whats going on? Wondered why my piwer fist had 357 damage lol
---
Of those all I have is Marsupial, and I know its been bugged since patch in terms of stopping working... BUT, my friend has Marsupial and does not have the accuracy issue. So its weapon or character specific in some way...
---
There were posts about how boring the game became after you found a TSE. 
---
Yeah I was confused. I had seen a comment from one of the devs on here saying that they were considering buffing explosives and heavy guns, and then I saw this in the patch notes with no buffs at all.
---
Wut.
---
Is there a more updated version for Fallout 76 anyone has been able to find?
---
I was a stupid fanboy making excuses for that game. And I was also doing the same for this one for a while. But at some point you just have to open your eyes and see. You have to just be honest with yourself. Is this the standard we are saying is ok to put out for AAA price. I've been burned time and time again by these AAA games. I love the game in many ways, but we really need to get them know, especially the suits, that putting out games in this state is unacceptable, and more and more people are waking up to it, and more and more people will point blank stop buying them at release. 
---
Everything Gun related is pointless anyway now Melee is back to being top dog  
---
I had a metric crap ton of radaway stock piled. I just stripped naked and stood in some water until I got the right mutation. It took a few tries. I burned through probably 30 radaway, but ended up with like 40 still left over. 
---
What sucks as well is it's just a complete nerf without compensating in any way. The materials used to make or repair armor haven't been adjusted, so BGS basically just said to us "you get to grind and repair your shit 30% more often." Um no thanks I have a life I'm going to go play something else that doesn't punish me for playing.
---
If you got mids checkem.
---
I don't think merging weight reduction talents into weapon talents would be very fun. That would reduce player choices and build diversity.
---
Bethesda true goal is to turn this game into Dying Light were guns are garbo and its all about melee.
---
I'll try it and report back, and no, my stash wasn't full.
---
If you dont want to farm you can also just buy ballistic fiber at vendors. If that’s efficient time-wise depends on your cap earning method.
---
The fallout player base is a dramatic entitled community they literally freaked out because the brotherhood of steel was in this game the best part is that the only youtuber who likes this game oxhorn their have been people making expose video's on him calling him homophobic and sexist because he said he's not playing the outer worlds because he doesn't like orginal creators of fallout.
---
For a "Market to exist between players" you need to have at least a server wide text chat you know...
---
What’s hilarious about it? People are upset. They have a right to be upset.
---
FO4’s Blitz ...
---
I only bulk lead, which is one of the few where bulking helps with weight. I don’t bother with the rest. And yes, making ammo today I came across this new ‘feature’. I actually assumed it was meant to be, as you can now no longer auto scrap mods. It didn’t take much effort to scrap some bulk and continue making ammo. Crafting WAS NOT broken. 
---
The game isn't recognizing bulked items as the raw components, you need to scrap the raw items for it to work, hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
It didn't used to be this way.
---
How does anything I said make me a duper? My top lvl Character is only 30. 
---
I just think it's amazing to watch everyone get so worked up over this game. It's madness. 
---
Are you another TSE user who didn’t perk his weapon of choice?
---
I loved my level 50 plasma gun that did a whopping......17 damage.
---
Depends how much support they were getting from Activision really. They can have the best intentions in the world right now but if they can't foot the bill anymore things could really slow down.
---
It's fucked. They patched a previous build and not the current so it has all the old bugs. 
---
Thanks!
---
Bethesda's really been stepping up their response rate lately. Good job /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ !
---
The patch has disassociated bulk items.
---
Take your bulk to a station, scrap, repair.
---
They never were. It was all fake news.  I got the plans when I was close to level 60 as an event reward.
---
I'm looking for low level unyielding myself. chameleon, too. racked up a lot from the ferris event and have spare to trade. hit me up later and we can work something out.
---
For the handmade, after the patch?
---
depends on your build, heavy weapons are supposedly eating durability, explosives (not legendary effect) are sale fodder now. no point in a pipe build for durability anymore.
---
white knight i can kinda see but to nerf it without touching PA points just cements PA as the "best/only" armor type outside of specific builds.
---
not gonna touch the tse nerf because there are way to many involved variables and they decided a nuke to everything is the proper solution.
---
Are all the materials in your stash? Are they pure or in bulk?
---
The atom shop works though. And is competitively priced! So there's that.
---
Player vending (cough cough) they seem to forget stuff quite often.
---
I think the point of the SBQ is to farm for mods, not the armor set you get from completing the BOS quest line anyway.
---
Arent we already playing the test servers ;)
---
No, not at all. I'm just giving you all the attention you desperately seek.
---
I have a Lever Action TSE and a 10MM Auto Pistol with TSE too. So definitely not that.
---
You're offline
---
I'm out of town right now but If you don't get them by the time I'm back, I'll craft them for the required flux. I can craft all mutations. This goes for anyone reading. Bring me the flux and I'll craft for free.
---
with a vague and empty Into the vault on Thursday no doubt ; )
---
Jokes aside it is kind of ironic that the community managers have disappeared now after the patch dropped, and every one that had there tongues up there asses are no where to be seen now!
---
There probably busy getting reamed in the office by Todd's mom or something and with a bit of luck well hear something from them tomorrow or later. 
---
Not checked there own forums or facebook n twitter etc I assume there getting even more hate over there?
---
Aw. :) thanks, kiddo.
---
Oh Beth - you have completely fucked the dog.
---
I checked both Watoga and Harper’s today, level 62, but didn’t get them. Didn’t served hop as I already have the plans but was curious to see if they would appear.
---
Sounds like a fun game!
---
Just ignore him. Trolls aren't worth feeding. Though, if he keeps on, might just screenshot it and post it over at r/cringetopia
---
which ones do you want?   I get bored in nuked zones so I collect the irradiated flora and make stable fluxes. I have the flux for sure just need to make sure I have the other junk. say 200 caps per?
---
Dont have tse anyway so not mad about that 
---
No shit. The mods on PA are standard but if we have a complete set it should give a little more. I dont have a prob with Rad-x not being stacked because I have a stockpile of it. 
---
Yea. I thought he might be looking for a specific weapon. 
---
Would like to be able to separate guns, melee, and throwables/mines in the inventory. Same for armor and power armor. 
---
Hope they reference the [mod version](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/18901-1-1475274986.png), rather than just importing the [Nuka-World vanilla](https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1545767/fallout-4-nuka-world-quantum-power-armor.png\)) one.
---
The Scroll Elders
---
Can confirm it is applying to weapon damage too.
---
Great job Beth.
---
With the new TSE nerfs, my non-automatic TSE handmade rifle (fully modded and perked for single shot damage) now does less damage than a random melee weapon I have in my inventory without even having any perk or mod for it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haTd_UC_PmI
---
ME Andromeda wasn't so bad avided the hype train though myself as not a huge fan
---
Aliens games have always been crap
---
Duke Nukem....well wait 10 or 15 years to release a game you best get it right! they clearly didn't
---
Sean Murray is just a con man, they knew they had squat at time of going gold but hid it. Took them 2 years to get to a stage where half his claims about game play were true!
---
There's still hope for fo76, Mainly because Bethesda want to carry on churning out games. Cant see ES6 selling all that well now or FO5, especially if they don't salvage this.
---
Somebody should tell the OP that sometimes, shit happens. Mention that they should relax and perhaps meditate regularly. And then ease into the fact that they are already dead and that this is all an illusion.
---
Does anyone know the % buff for Berserker's, anyway? I'm curious how much of a boost I'd get with 1 piece of minimum DR gear.
---
How much was it?
---
They also break really really really fast and do very very low damage to flying scorchbeasts for some godforaken  reason. My non legendary rifle kills them faster.
---
Bethesda should be able to afford the best on the planet.  If this is it....omg.  Perhaps this game is a precursor to the Fallout 5 story line of a company called Bemehsda actually being responsible for the bombs dropping in the first place.
---
It takes 2 shots to kill a LVL 5 robot now when Im LVL 93... Really ok with that?
---
It’s more the precedent it sets for the future. And even if the buff isn’t crazy, they still straight up lied.
---
Just logged into the game none of the materials I have in bulk are being counted. For example I have 13 bulk adhesive. It’s not letting me repair leather armor saying it’s 3/7. Same thing is happening with my steel. I can’t craft any weapons.
---
So I had to double check my comment...nope no name calling from me, so you lie about a post I made, then expect me to believe you about your life history in IT? hahah the irony
---
It'd be in a better spot than it was released in. Look what they did in under 90 days after the majority of their player base left. 
---
I think there may have a couple of 30s, but the rest of us were well above 70.  Not a freaking dent, no matter what we threw at her.
---
Also noticed that just about everything that died gave us the circle of nothing when we were trying to loot corpses.
---
For me it's just a hastle I meet one scortch beast and the battle takes awhile because I don't use overpowered gear and it just melts the durability . 
---
They did change it! I'm level 100 and I bought them today :)
---
&gt;  If they are good coders
---
They work at Bethesda, I'm sure that's not the case.
---
A literal nuclear explosion (fat man) now does the same amount of damage as a jimmy-rigged tambourine (Death Tambo).
---
I never played that but I'm pretty sure I got it from Xbox live. Thanks for the tip.
---
I've got two 3 year old dogs who get mad at me when I play Fallout. I think the Nintendo Switch is a better fit for me these days. I've always enjoyed Diablo 3. Fallout 4 was the same for me. I live the feeling when you get a legendary drop and run around the corner to check and see what you got. Fallout 76 just killed that excitement for me.
---
That's who i laugh at. I don't care about my tse because i have some other weapons i fucking wasted time grinding over.
---
Just don't talk about it... or those wiley devs will nerf the shit outta ya.
---
Fair warning, with the recent reductions in damage on most weapons, scorchbeasts are now a bigger issue. I managed to kill one with all of the bots in white springs and it still took a while. It seems like melee weapons are the way to go but until they land it is hard to do significant damage. Same terrible loot drops as well. 
---
I can't seem to find reliable info anywhere. I know the boost was pretty substantial in Fallout 4.
---
I am also a merchant... see other posts lol. I was driven to this. 
---
Yes, I’ve been looking since the beta and then today with the Plans-splosion I found the heavy combat armor chest at either harpers ferry or Watoga mart (can’t be sure which). They were cheap (relative to PA mod plans) at 500 caps. wish there were mod plans for the armor like there always are for the marine armor.
---
This shit really should be unacceptable. 
---
I agree. It’s BS
---
Shhhhhh. Bethesda will smell the dmg.
---
I agree with all of that but Bethesda has to actually meet our needs. I'm all about pvp, but what kind of content is that man. People want stuff to do. Not a server where we have to start a new char. and get the same ol content w just an easier ability to kill players. Sure theyll have a few things to do like contracts maybe (hopefully). But we want more events, more looting, more in game enemies, weapons, apparel, hell even plans. They give us nothing and with nerfs. Where did we gain a single buff. :/ just sucks I guess. 
---
Wow, you’re really not very good at this game. Don’t have any TSE weapons and have no issue killing those levels mirelurk kings or muties. Sure, may take more than 2 shots, but I get them in the end. And I’m only level 62. 
---
Damn I'm jelly wish my fiancee gamed and was passionate about it like you she just looks at me disaprovingly while I game and stares at facebook. (Though I will say her not liking video games is the only thing I'd change about her so I'm not complaining she's great and I love her...) anyways I must say your husbands a lucky man
---
Future content will be coming in a few months with a $30 dlc we have to pay for.
---
I can kill a level 68 Super Mutants in three seconds with less than 10 bullets using a non-legendary 10mm pistol. VATS to the head and pump out crits whenever they're up. 
---
I agree 100% laser weapons, plasma weapons, and explosives are all useless, i hope people continue apreading awareness about the issue its ashame bethesda cant properly update their own game, they take one step forward and 3 steps back every single time.  
---
Don't know why the dude gave you such a salty reply. Silver Shroud and Geognak were copy-pasted into this game. Like ***literally every little fold is the same.*** They should of already been in-game.
---
Im fine with reused assets, just not when they charge you extra for it... 
---
Wtf is wrong with you people? "They nerfed a perk I like! They should have their livlihood taken from them!"
---
Do you believe everything your told on the internet? 
---
With the new vendor bots, are the daily limit still at 1,400 caps?
---
And Camden Park vendor bot.
---
Ah thought so, good to hear!
---
I know a cry for help when I see it. It's not about the game, is it? Come over here lay on this couch and tell me when the problems in you're life started.....
---
Oh my god we have so much in common. BFFs right now.
---
/u/superhans901 too busy rage downvoting everything to come up with any proper response.
---
It’s a quest at Garrahan Mining in the south side of the map.
---
I think you receive more caps from enemies know I've noticed schorched used to only drop 2-3 caps every other one noticed it's 17-25 on more then just a few almost whole hoard maybe different in areas not sure but that's new...
---
Camden?
---
Nope...this was big time FUD  for many many people.  You got lucky.
---
I don't get to play very often (literally less than 40 hours since launch day), and have spent many hours server hopping to try to get Black Powder Rifle/Pistol, and an equal amount trying for a full set of Raider PA....no real luck so far.
---
Though, to be fair, I'm so far behind and don't have anyone really to play with when I DO get to play (I have some friends that play 76, but they're level 100-150+...I don't really wanna be a drag on them) that I don't fully know HOW to play.  Oh well.
---
Bird Bones serum, speed demon serum and healing factor serum. Yeah 200 per is cool
---
Ok. Yep. Some one call the paramedics. This guy is so butt hurt he dusted off his Merriam and Webster. 
---
"people want what they paid for, what entitled assholes". Jesus, you're a fucking asshat. 
---
Heres the thing... I am having fun. Im just bummed that Bethesda seems to have no love for there own creation. They're working hard but they are just missing the bar. They rely on our feedback and listen to there customers... One thing Im very happy about. This game is still in its infancy and I believe it will mature beautifully in the end. Im proud to be a part of the FO community. We've all have had to endure this together and obviously im still hear because I am concerned. This game is a reflection of whats to come from this studio... ES6 and Starfield.
---
BSG:  We hear you and will address in the next patch
---
\- Melee weapon damage reduced by 95%
---
PVP should’ve been dead last on the “things to add” list. We should’ve received at least 2-3 PVE focused updates before seeing anything PVP focused. Everyone’s so hype about this PVP content and I’ll never understand why? PVP in this game is atrocious. Why would anyone log into 76 for the sole purpose of playing PVP?
---
dude, I farmed so much the last few days because I wanted to finish my grenade launcher + explosive shotgun build. And now they nerf every aspect of both weapons. I really want to like this game but jesus fucking christ, they are probably trying to make people not play this game.
---
I got one plan mod from an event near Watoga today after the update. Haven't seen them for sale at any vendor with this new update yet. 
---
 Camden and Grafton (town, not station)
---
Bad enough they nerfed the shit out of TSE for sakes for PvP.. Then they nerfed that perk card too? Who the hell thinks of all these "balance" changes? I'd like to have a real short talk with them.
---
I haven't played the game since December due to the repetitive bugs I constantly dealt with. The game felt hollow, and there was nothing but server crashing dupers. Now I waited around a month, and decided to see if this new patch looked like something I would get back into the game for. Yet, I remain un-surprised by the fact that instead of making anything really "better" Bethesda has again, just "fixed" some random stuff that not only makes the game less enjoyable, but frankly less likely for re-play-ability. I guess my question is, are they doing this so everyone stops playing? Do they not want to sell anymore copies for ever? People found the only weapons that they enjoyed (albeit yes TSE was OP, but so is the Bloodied Melee build). I just want to know why the loyal fan base has been perpetually tormented and abused since this game released in 11/2018. 
---
For all of you still sticking with it, I commend you in the level of patience you have. This latest patch has made me not regret stop playing it for a while until the game is more than. OH GO FARM THE SAME SHIT THIS IS YOUR ONLY CONTENT. For fucks sake, would it kill them to make 4 player instances and a game that isn't half assed. 
---
Not to mention the perfs ...
---
As far as lore, IIRC it was placed there by the coppersmith who made it. 
---
It’s also possible others were made, though given the reuse of many of the assets from FO4, I’m sure it was just them being lazy. 
---
Nothing like running around with a broken grenade launcher. I mean literally broken due to the low durability and out of ammo because springs lol.
---
1944 caps.
---
That's awesome. I am working to start an assassins guild to help a bit with guarding and dealing with greifers. 
---
Not a single thing was balanced this patch. Only nerfed.
---
Balance would means things that are underperforming would get some attention and buffs.
---
Hmmm mine doesnt show any torso armor, but that probably would look cool. I wish there were some tattoos or scars to add for the mid section!
---
Explosive Vent, Left Arm, Pump Action Prime Receiver, and some more ultracite.  I did get some violet flux from Scorched Earth though.
---
Fallout 4 was the same way. At least until I filled Sanctuary with Purifiers and became the largest producer of purified water in the commonwealth and just bought all my junk lol. 
---
harper's ferry used to have them, no?
---
Yeah but Zenimax had to pull ESO and it got relaunched after a year.
---
Got almost 1k hours on console after the relaunch, about 30 hours on PC at original launch.
---
They had there issues but they turned it around, hopefully they pull one or two staff members and lend them to this team for a few months! I say it in jest lol but it could be just what they need, the current team (pretty sure its 1 guy) clearly has no clue or can't handle it.
---
Screw you man. The kid might be mature and he’s probably a good kid. Plus it’s none of your business. It’s his decession. Plus, it’s not a big deal
---
I have powered doors! I’ll let you know when I log back on and you can have them! 
---
Better to star working on systems people don’t like to try and change their mind than to leave it stagnating and without purpose, once survival has gotten its attention the focus will shift to PVE and we’ll get new content, just a little more patience is necessary. 
---
Pretty dissapointing if you ask me, Fo4 with the Creation Club was cutting it close in my opinion. It was balanced by the inclusion of mods on the consoles.
---
Now though? Is Bethesda paying attention u/Ladydevann? We want, at the very least, a game that can pass as finished on it's release date. Fallout 76 fell well, WELL short of that.
---
We've been trying to provide information and are being rebuffed / ignored.
---
Bethesda are charging 2000 caps for a red stapler skin in the atom shop. 
---
I'm LITERALLY 100 lbs lighter.  I logged in today getting ready to do my daily inventory mgmt, and noticed I lost 100 lbs.  After a moment of panic, I checked here, and figured out why.  This is awesome.  Now increase my stash size!!
---
*laughs in r/blackops4*
---
You forgot step 2a. Expend copious quantities of ammo dispatching said mod. 
---
yeah... i mean i like the company But 76 came out way to soon. Don't get me wrong I love the game but it's kind of reminds me of an old poster I remember from school (just tried googling it and couldn't find the right one) but suffice it to say the really need to know where the track of the game is going before the train leaves the station (and it's not just them it's alot of games now being rushed by the companies and here we are now)
---
Got bobby pins? Apparently that’s broken again. (Haven’t checked it myself yet)
---
The responder vendor bot in Grafton. Not the train station bot.
---
Check if you have Rad Worms. It seems to be modifying (enhancing) many game effects including marsupial.
---
Regarding the crap jump, I was jumping like a pleb earlier and relogging fixed it.
---
This might be our lives now.
---
&gt;	Go play that
---
I will and do. I even pay them $16/mo for an unlimited crafting bag.
---
I'll never spend a dime on this game.
---
Relentlessly 
---
No you would still "have to use it" it just won't be nearly as effective now. As someone who doesn't use PA often this was a need created so players would have to grind more. That's it.
---
Ha this is my life. I actually enjoy the junk grind, but I was bummed this past Saturday when I went back to my camp to hit the water purifiers only to discover the camp was 95% destroyed. A whole day of grinding to come home realize I'd be grinding to fix the camp the following day.
---
How much are you getting hit? It takes me quite a long time to have to repair power armor even without the durability perk and I'm a melee that gets whacked in the face 400-500 times each SBQ fight. I've literally gone like 10 hours game time of actually playing (not in one sitting) end game content and getting hit in combat without having to repair. I'm talking like 20-30+ SBQ fights, here.
---
Like I'm legit asking with no hostility. Trying to figure out why I experience such a disparity. What kinda PA so you wear? 
---
The emphasis on PvP smells like corporate meddling. Every executive wants their game to be the next PUBG or BlOps 4.
---
Bobby pins weight things now? Try that
---
He wants the plans for the mods, not the plans for the PA pieces. 
---
down voted. daily caps limit makes the plans still rare and hard to get, just available when you can finally afford it.
---
For fuck sakes. Three months. What fucking game are you playing that gets new content every three fucking months? Fucking children . 
---
Agreed. That's the only reason I bought it. I have an innate desire to play fallout and force my friends to listen to my Borat impressions.
---
Seriously though, add more group driven content please 😀
---
Great. Why waste time in the subreddit?
---
That's weird.
---
I'm super confused at the direction they're taking this game in.
---
At first I thought, "Oh, they're just tacking on a lame PvP element to cater to a few people. Most people just want to play Fallout 4 with their buddies."
---
And then all of this focus on survival mode and PvP factions and their own servers and I'm just sitting here like, "What the fuck is going on?"
---
Give us some raids, give us more cooperative activities that AREN'T raids. Even some crap as simple as "group challenges" that reward more ATOM or something. "Complete 5 events with 1 or more players on your team."
---
Give us some incentive to team up with randoms, give us more incentive to complete these events. I dunno man, I'm an idiot. I was just expecting this to be Fallout 4 with more people helping me do shit.
---
I hope the devs support the game like ESO, adding lots of PVE contents.
---
i get how that works but its not displaying same numbers equipped vs not. and now it shows 97 and 62. its allover.
---
FO4 lore says it only came down once during an earthquake in 1755 and quickly repaired and replaced where it stayed until 2287. the only way would be if multiple were made, but given Shem's attachment to it during the quest "The Guilded Grasshopper" in the events of Fallout 4, I would sincerely doubt there was more than one made.
---
Board certified dingus!
---
Only in other games...there's balance. In this game, there's no balance. The people being asshats are, generally, exploiters with high power gear targeting low level characters with no recourse. 
---
I use auto rifles, and critical meter fills almost instantly. With my perks that rifle would do a little over 100 base damage, and vats crits to the head will kill a lvl 68 super mutant in about 2 bullets. The dmg on that thing is really high if you're built for it. 
---
How is this a slippery slope, no one complained about the toys decreasing rads, timed events are fine, they don't ruin the game, plus the avenger are stronger as a team, makes sense that their superheroes would benefit from being on a team together
---
About to hang myself cause of this nerf
---
I don’t really get upset over changes in computer games. What with life and everything, you know..
---
&gt;It still works but its not so stupidly OP.
---
definitely. it's not even decent.
---
&gt;Before it was a complete waste of time.
---
and now it's even worse.
---
Good for you, "bro" - I've server hopped for hours, day after day, and seen none. Literally not one. Jet packs? Yep. Stealth boys? Four or five. No. Fucking. Shocks.
---
I responded and I am not downvoting. I get why people are upset. I just always see trends like this happen and it always comes across the same way. Pathetic 
---
Thanks for your unwanted input ...bye
---
Some people would try to sell handmade rifles off as super rare 
---
Not on the game at the moment, but can’t we re-scrap bulk stuff and break it up again?
---
We need more vigilantes. Hah
---
I, for one, am so happy for all the items addressed in this update. TSE finally fixed to anyone who relied on it...sucks to be you, but now you understand how hard our games were not having those broken OP weapons etc. I'm still kinda annoyed the demolition expert wasn't reduced by another 10% at max rank as even grenades still do exceptional damage... and would also like that explosive affix of a weapon to not gain bonus from DE but alas it's a patch in the right direction. 
---
I'm not sure on that carry weight maximum of 1500 over your carry weight, even that seems excessively high. As I pick up a lot of stuff, and am always over encumbered, but I've never been even 1000 weight units total including my max carry weight. If this issue was a huge detriment to server stability it really could be toned down by half again. Unless it takes all of stash weight items with your players inventory...
---
Finally fixes to various exploits including a cap on most amount of exp a single enemy could provide, thank you. I can't even describe the amount people I've seen level 12 then 5 minutes later level 80. I have since just assumed anyone's level is probably illegitimate given how often I've seen this occur. Which is why if someone said "I'm level x and haven't seen y" I never took their stories or complaints serious as at that time levels were easily exploited. 
---
All around amazing update, thanks for your hard work! 
---
Duping is dead.  
---
As someone who spent his time collecting to both be a merchant and pass out kits starter kits to people and provide free upgrades I feel your pain, I've been completely crushed and unable to even buy / sell on my non-overweight characters.  
---
Obviously.
---
Problem was simple and fixed early for anyone that paid attention, the skeleton spam debug massages to the SKSE log, originally there was a save cleaner that cleaned the SKSE saves but then it was realize that if you just unchecked the ESP file it stopped the spamming and everything worked, no more bloated saving, which is what originally cause the lag late in game, was fixed in the first few months by modders
---
you think the jetpack is bad? check the seruns in white springs bunker science —20,000
---
You’re right, I’m finally starting to lose my patience with all the secret nerfs and plain stupidity as well with these patches. When I thought some of the prayers were answered like bobble heads not stacking anymore and duping patches, all that hype immediately deflated today. I even got bored of Fallout and started playing something else. If I can recommend a game to play in the meantime, and if you have a PS4, I suggest playing Yakuza 0 while you wait. I lost a lot of time to that game, and there was never a dull moment for me when I played that game
---
I assume that's what they meant. It seems pretty silly to highlight the ones you own since, you know, you built them and all. 
---
I'm downloading the update now, I'll let you know for sure once I'm on.
---
Didn't your neighbours complain to the authorities? Think of the children ;)
---
*places hand on your shoulder*
---
Me too... hashtag...me too.
---
Yeah its bs cause I was 2 points away in INT to be able to use explosive demolition perk, this update just made those levels moot now and since I'm such a high level respec again is such a waste of points/perk cards.
---
Sorry did you only want people who were gonna stroke your head and tell you everything was going to be ok? You didn’t mention that in your OP.
---
They are indeed back to weighing 0.1 but I've only got 5 on me.
---
Why is it that I can just see the Community Manager going about their day, they check in after the servers are back up and start seeing that previous bug fixes are now unfixed and then just going to find the nearest dev, grabbing them by the collar, and growling out "What did you do!"
---
Smooches!
---
The clown make-ups from Fallout 4, which I think came from the Nuka-World dlc.
---
Awesome, thank you! Bummer the actual percentages or even formula for Berserker's isn't posted anywhere.
---
Level 134 doesn't give you all maxed perk cards, and most are taken up by cards i sadly don't even use. Like extra weight, reduction for certain categories of items etc. 
---
That exact thing happened to me.  I found a TSE 10mm machine gun just 2 days ago, I’m glad I at least got to use it for a couple hours before becoming obsolete. 
---
The game already gave you a free set for completing the brotherhood questline, so I don't see what the big deal is. It's not like the queen didn't drop these plans all the time too, they were pretty common
---
Even with the 200 limit, many of the hardcore players are flirting with the 25k cap limit. Why do you think it is a good idea to eliminate this new cap sink? I, for one, actually have a reason to sell to other players for caps now.
---
It’s honestly laughable that these devs can’t even figure out how to properly use version control software. Getting harder and harder to continue to support and fanboy the game when they seem to be dead set on making it as tedious and grindy as possible to keep people “busy” while they procrastinate developing new content. 
---
I'll be honest. The game was getting pretty boring and the grind for materials was already bad enough. I played for 10 minutes and turned the game off......count me in as one less person keeping the servers running.
---
Am I the only one sick of the "I've never duped!" disclaimers? Yeah, you've traded in-game for your weapon, which (if it's a god-roll TSE) has most likely come from a duper...
---
Means to an end. 
---
and at Vendor Bot Greg in Grafton, Raider PA mods are from Vendor Bot Resin at Top Of The World
---
Cosidering our weapons are about to be as effective as a “commie whacker” they need to nerf the queen. And fix the annoying full-auto screech/fart the others use. 
---
He was using plastic as an example and referred to other bulk materials in general. It doesn’t matter I guess, maybe I was just mansplaining. It doesn’t make sense to me that bulked scrap would be intentionally included in stuff to not break down for crafting because most players are going to bulk the things that benefit from a weight reduction. The inconvenience of breaking bulk down every time we need to craft or build is going to outweigh the added convenience of preventing accidental breakdown of things bulked for sale. 
---
Ah, I have over 100 and that explains why my weight was up today. Thanks for confirming.
---
Just caught the last part of you comment, once you learned to completely overhaul the game, it was like a new game every time, have never played borderlands
---
100% agree. Explosives are hardly worth the five points I put in it
---
They could have always nerfed it for pvp like how it does less damage to other players but slightly nerf it against pve content, so everything isn't a bullet sponge. 
---
I’ve been thinking about trying atlas out. But I’ll check that out. Thanks!
---
Thanks. Now I am going to complain these two builds being overpower because this is probably not intended to be easy. Wait for your nerf. 
---
Well, I've spent so much time grinding that there's only one plan I need: the T60 jet pack. Already found the shocks through sheer grinding. 
---
If my understanding is right duping still exists.  Just on a much smaller scale now.  I do not think they could fix it. So they are limiting by the weight limit.
---
Well, shit. Not the answer I'd been hoping for. Thanks for answering, though.
---
If you want to do that. Go to the mine east of whitesprings, there's irradiated barrels there and a decontamination shower just inside the mine to the right
---
ok I have the junk for those. I'll be online for another twenty or so minutes if you are available now. If not I'll be on from around 4pm until 730 tomorrow night.  
---
gt phishntrtips
---
You didn't acknowledge anything I said except for the last statement. We're receiving PVP cool, that's great though a majority of the community doesn't want it \* I for one am all for it along with transferring gear\* I have 4/5 Unyielding Sentinel/TSE's &amp; Bloody\*.
---
When we asked for PVE update date or at least a release window we were told sometime march.What's sad is that it's already been data mined and is in the game. Just currently blocked.
---
I've burned all content and with recent NERFs all that is available is daily cap farming/queen kills . 
---
I didn't say Bethesda should burn or that Todd Howard should be nerfed. What I'm calling for is something that provides a MIDDLE ground. ALL THIS PATCH HAS DONE has altered the META to Melee. Melee DPS loopholes and buffs are well documented and exceed 5k to 10k.
---
A flat debuff is not a solution
---
Yes.
---
Off topic, I'm not a Yank, what I don't understand with American politics is that you choose to vote / or note yet knowing who's running and that they might end up winning you guys don't seemed to do anything about it voting wise and complain after they get into power. Don't people see they have the power to " change" ( lol I'm sounding like I'm running for something ). On topic, thumbs up for any / all balances, fixes to the game.
---
It wasn't viable before, the changes doesn't make a difference. 
---
Mods were PC.  They didn't have them on console until Fallout 4.  This may very well have not affected PC version.  This was a 360 console issue.  Do your homework before you mouth off son.
---
I can foresee you will be able to convert atoms into caps one day. 
---
They are still some of the strongest weapons in the game, so I am fine with them being brought down from "god tier" to just "Really really good tier".
---
What did you say exactly? I'm still in the chargeback process and am waiting over a month for my bank to get back to me.
---
I'd like to see the clown make-ups from Fallout 4, which I think came from the Nuka-World dlc.
---
Eh I think he’s right. It’s a huge problem for anyone who bulks anything. I could not craft a thing when not in my camp. 
---
In the bunkers there aren’t stashed so that means: no crafting due to no mats. 
---
In the middle of a firefight when you run to a weapons bench: no repairing due to no mats. 
---
Excavator plans can be purchased at the Camden park vendor in the Ash heap. Treature maps for that area can also reward them.
---
Currently you can only get Ultracite plans from the Scorch Beast Queen reliably, though any level 80 SB can also drop them. After killing the later in a non-nuke zone a while back the bastard actually dropped the mod plan for calibrated shocks!
---
Unfortunately, there are no plans for X-01 mods in game currently. Unless this patch changed it.
---
Next patch note, include an address where players can return their game for a fund.
---
If you put work into an entire aspect of gameplay that isn’t used it’ll warrant attention to try and make that worthwhile, people do PvP and PVE content is on its way, perhaps in the update following survival.
---
Because I can own the game without spending money it. Because fallout used to be a good series. 
---
Any word on lever action rifles yet?
---
Damn that sounds like a bug. I haven’t logged in today to see if my door is having the same problem. 
---
Nice. I need to get my handmade gun now.
---
Yea, but someone could come in and build a turret and it might can cause issues later. I'm not sure, but I did come across a random camp with two turrets that constantly shot at each other for some reason. I repaired them to be a good Samaritan and one had a white health bar and the other a red one. And then they immediately starting shooting each other again. B ur that might have been related to something else.
---
20,000-ish caps depending on your charisma and perks.
---
Forgot the part where they said nerf fun, make things more tedious.
---
Thanks for you Bulk items, bet I've bought some.
---
Never said we we're "hardcore gamers" but, that we we're "hardcore fans" of this franchise. We're all in our late 30s... If only we had more time to play. 
---
Now as far as White Knight Perk goes... Im inclined to agree that it needs some adjustments but, to this extreme? We were spoiled with it but  Plus, can we get some ballistic fiber drops or at least let us scrap it from armors? The farming is gonna be nightmarish.
---
This sub is going off the deep end now.
---
So fucking delusional
---
So basically the dupers that have 2 shot explosive energy weapons will have really rare weapon types now cool, reward the dupers even more Bethesda.
---
&gt;Dev Note: In looking at the Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber perks, we felt they have so far been overperforming in their current roles, and we wanted to bring them more in line with similar perks to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.
---
**Player Note:** In looking at Fallout 76, we felt that BGS has so far been underperforming in its current role, bringing the studio in line with similar bloated, out-of-touch shops like Blizzard and EA. There is no doubt BGS products are, for a significant number of us, no longer feeling like mandatory picks.
---
Okay, and plus, Yakuza 0 is out on PC already, with another game, Yakuza Kiwami (Yakuza 1 remaster) being ported over as well
---
Lol one major rollback not mentioned...duping is back. Maybe this time they'll let it stick around for an extra month now.
---
Well, it would take a large amount of development time to address each energy weapon, and rebalance them individually. And they would need to sit down and discuss the impacts of applying any sort of buff to energy weapons across the board, because they could inadvertently make one of them overpowered and that would be devastating to the game's balance.
---
Yep should have bought from other sellers at 1200 caps. Pa plans are 7200 caps
---
In time we will have content. They know they are not in perfect standing and are trying to do better. Just hope for the best and find fun where it is.
---
Who cares? Silver Shroud costume was one of my direct requests to Beth. Gimme! 👍🏻🕵🏻‍♀️
---
That Manta Man, though. Oof. 😛 
---
Inspector would be better with black pants. 🤔
---
Are these permanent?
---
Damnit! That trick! I just sneezed....
---
I think im allergic to your bullshit. Haha
---
Whenever i see an explosive build fighting the scorchbeast queen it saddens me because deep down inside i know they should make a difference but the reality is they dont, they run out of ammo quick and then theyre sitting there with their thumb up their ass waiting for the xp reward while the scorchbeast queen reams the rest of us. It wouldnt suprise me if explosives were outclassed by a player running a melee build swinging a board at scorched while hopped up on psycho.  
---
They should keep the survival mode and make the regular mode pve. That way if you want real pvp you have a way to do it. They're already splitting the playerbase with survival mode, which was apparently a reason for not doing pve and pvp servers in the first place. 
---
LOL to anyone who relied on tse and now is struck with a gun that can't insta kill everything. 
---
I just ran the queen about 10 minutes with a group of 12, all over level 90, mostly over level 130. After the full 30 minutes we just managed to get her below half health before she flew away. It's awful, really.
---
But you spent money on it? Or it was a gift? I dunno where you're going with this.
---
Ok so you have an indefensible point and have to resort to personal attacks and insults. 👌 I can see there’s no point conversing with someone like you. Gets shown multiple times in multiple comments specifically what is wrong with what they’ve said. Your reply? “Dingus” lmaooooo
---
Its not that bad. Jetpack is 7200 (Among other plans).
---
He was looking for a specific mutation recipe.
---
Jesus Christ that's high
---
Not that kind of upset. It’s like if you order a burger and you ask them to not include a topping and it’s on the burger anyways. Like you’ll still enjoy it obviously but you’re annoyed. 
---
Still love the game but I’m annoyed at the nerf. 
---
Try an explosive energy weapon. Eight shots and it’s done 
---
Haha if ur on xbox I'd love to play man
---
It's working for me with Combat Armor, though since I don't have any other armor, I'm guessing it probably only works with Combat Armor based on your post
---
Haha I know
---
Adapt or die I guess, everything changes except...
---
Some pieces didn't drop as often as others. The big deal is you had to kill the queen to get the plans the free set might not be as good as a crafted one, and you can resell plans too now whats the point. They just made the plans redundant and now that they are in the terminal if you get the plans from the queen now you just got more crap, even though queen always gave junk its more insult to injury to have these plans drop now. 
---
Plenty of games aren't polished, yes. Not many full-price major studio releases are this unpolished in the ways needed to sustain a fledgling game.
---
The problem for me, and I think a lot of other people, is that the game loop is fairly shallow compared to those other games due to the amount of randomization involved. A good loop, as much as I dislike crediting addictive hamster wheels, keeps people engaged at varying levels. That's because a good loop is predictably rewarding rather than randomly rewarding, which makes people feel like they are progressing rather than just getting lucky.
---
Today's patch confirms that the devs to some degree might see that it needs work since they clearly recognized how soul sucking server hopping for random vendor stock was and got rid of that aspect.

I really wish Bethesda would explain/comment on the cap limit.  My best guess is they use it as a choke point to make sure the game grinds at a certain (slow) pace thereby keeping players busy while they develop new content.  That said, I bet all of the planned new content is really delayed because of the excessive number of bugs and exploits they’ve had to contend with, hence they won’t raise the cap limit.  I bet they will raise the limit when they release new content (not the new survival mode), but actual new content.  Even then, it’ll be modest, like 250 and they’ll keep the time gating.
---
Ahhh hahahah
---
Sounds like reality viewed through a personality problem.
---
Yeah but ALL of the plans I’ve EVER learned are back in my stash showing as learned. They weren’t there yesterday. 
---
The game isn’t, nor should it be primarily about PvP though. That’s like if you have a car that won’t run, and instead of fixing the engine you install a new sound system.
---
It’s temporary removal *while* they fix it.
---
I'm so glad I finally finished all the achievements on Inventory Management Simulator. Haven't played it since. 
---
If anything, they're active because they have to be. Its all about Customer relations.
---
Hey 5 dollars ia 5 dollars broski
---
hahahah @ son.. dream on, so i did some quick research, and nowhere in your comment did you say on spybox...all you said was Skyrim in general DAD so try not to make yourself look any less intelligent there internet tough guy
---
My first comment said mods yet you replied:
---
Nope...this was big time FUD  for many many people.  You got lucky.  Perhaps you were 6 when it happened and not allowed to look at the internets.  And....if you played Skyrim for 7 years...wow.  That's wierd.  Borderlands 2 I could understand but Skyrim?  Hah!
---
So then you started mouthing off like you were going to make some big point then you last comment you start back tracking...I thought for a second we were having a good debate, but as with most of you facts kill the convo..I am off to play some &amp;\^ cause for most of us the game works great...good talk DAD
---
At least he's getting invited. 
---
You have a ten year old account... Wow
---
Right, they single handily killed their game today, nobody mentioned anything about perks being op but they nerfed everything 
---
Mine is do challenges sell stuff to vendors buy stuff from vendors log out repeat, its a sad repetitive end game. Now that vendors sell all plans it means just saving caps to eventually own every plan and hunt down rare X-01 mods since mods got scrapped by bs oversight of Bethesda.
---
You're kidding?
---
Cap Collector perk has been a thing in previous Fallout games too, where there were no servers... it’s always been more like an added benefit not something to structure your whole gameplay around...
---
Pretty much this.
---
Pro Tip: report his post for spam, then block him :)

---
How much is "a complete waste" I said I've heard both but I don't know the actual difference. Read my words.
---
~~Hacker~~ Duper!!!!
---
They hacked his brain! They gave MODUS a virus!
---
Don’t have a TSE, have never had one. Been playing the game just fine without one. 
---
Karma doesn't work in this subreddit, good try lol.
---
So you called out my knowledge asking for my modding work.  Then you called Bullshit in your next post.  If that's not a disparaging comment then what is.  Now you've moved on to calling me a liar and talking about internet fake news.  Please don't answer that.  Just seek help.  Do it now and stop using Forums.
---
Yeah I don't really think they thought it over before they implemented the system but it's not really surprising 
---
I'd like to introduce you to the scorch beast queen, she got a buff some time back.
---
Then why comment ? And you just said above you were getting upset ? Which one is it?
---
Such a lazy approach. If looking at their data they notice that everyone is running white knight, instead of nerfing it they should have had an internal discussion about why it was a necessity. Maybe then they would have realised armour breaks too quickly forcing people to use white knight so they can actually enjoy the game instead of farming repair materials non stop. 
---
Haha woulda hooked you up. Not everyone doesn't pick me.off lmao
---
Holy hell, i upvoted this and it went nowhere... 
---
This is a brilliant post! Come on!! 
---
Why do you need to talk to people like that....are you so shy and timid in RL you have to talk like a tough guy on the internet?
---
to keep them you need minimum 2 skill points in luck for starched genes and I would highly recommend another 3 points in luck for class freak which negates the negatives by 75%.
---
Nope, been running fine. Played 6 hours tonight, no frame rate drops and not a single disconnect.
---
I play rifles. On my regular hunting rifle with no legendaries the damage is 150. I’m spec’d with so many rifle damage perks to get there. My off hand melee does more damage with zero perks benefiting it. How is that balanced? My brothers power first does 700 damage and it’s attack speed is fast. The dps is not even comparable. Melee damage is close to almost 6 times better than any ranged weapon. 
---
Well, if they suddenly start offering AS items with permanent bonuses, or even timed bonus events that players can't participate in for free, then you can tell me "I told you so". 
---
Until then, meh.
---
Well the thing that changed is repairing armor is going cost more junk now and if you did get explosive weapon its crap and your two-shot weapon is more crap. Basically there isn't any legendary weapons to be excited for when they drop.
---
Its such a shame how true this all is really. I thought we were out of the bad *patch* and they had pulled their shit together, but after this? Fuck I'm not too sure anymore. 
---
No, there's a permanent vendor bot in the responder resupply station inside the town.
---
Spoiled meat... :(
---
I’d be thrilled with a quarter cut.   I saw at well over 1/2 cut 
---
Ypu think thata bad mine did the same damage befroe and now does 80
---
Wait I've got this too, didn't look at it because I thought it was an ad to buy atoms so I skipped it 
---
Oh I agree with you there. Right now the vendors tell me they'll buy my serums, but the cap limit is so low it ends up being impossible to sell them. Pretty ridiculous.
---
I don't know if I want to keep playing. been just browsing the sub for the last hour looking for an excuse to log in.
---
in one hand, griefing is fun and I should enjoy my sentinel set while it lasts, on the other, I feel discouraged to grind a new build because I know they'll just nerf it.
---
Ok that's good to know. I've heard more people say that's its better to bulk which is why I asked. 
---
Where’s vendor bot greg?
---
That's along the lines of what I meant. Just anyway for us to start anew, I'd love to transfer my character and not have gear. Not having to grind levels again would be a godsend really. I feel like people would find a way to either dupe, or transfer gear anyway though. If there were no game breaking bugs tied to it though, I'm totally in favor of that.
---
I had this issue and it updated when I took it to a power armor station and switched the mod back and forth.
---
It doesn’t take hundreds of hours to run out of content but I generally agree. Quit the game now because it’s boring and maybe it will be good some time later. 
---
I am desperately waiting on the paper cut buff. 
---
This 'patch' is pretty shocking, I agree.  Almost seems like the more they try, the worse it gets, which to me signifies a lack of experienced leadership.
---
I'm not going to wait for the next patch cycle for this to get resolved.  I just don't have it in me anymore to tolerate this.  A few days, maybe.  
---
&gt; There is NO EXCUSE for what happened with today's patch. None. First - and, unfortunately, LEAST of all - Bethesda nerfed perks that make repair costs less tedious. Their reason: The perks are over performing
---
OP did? 
---
Any idea on marine armor?
---
Sounds like you have put an excessive amount of hours into the game. You wouldn't have done it if you weren't having fun. You had a good run champ , take a break and play something else for a bit. Bethesda ain't going anywhere. It will be patched in a few months and hopefully its fresh for you then. 
---
Seems like a few people w/mods are having the problem, glad this post helped! Now to find a post that solves my non-mod issue : )
---

I want you to be the new President of Appalachia, I'll vote for you ( I'll even rig all the voting booths all quiet like so no one knows ) because you deserve it, not because of not getting that sandwich, but because you gave all those stars away and yet still shine at night. God bless you, God bless the new President of Appalachia.
---
Bait and switch? Wow, talk about overstating the issue...
---
Having said that though, agree that they should work out some form of compensation for a change like that. How though is an interesting question though. Like if you can refund the card and swap it for something else, what happens when people who have the card but never used it use that to their advantage to get a new card they do want?
---
I don't think there are any easy answers to resolving how you compensate, though I agree that some compensation should happen to those that invested in it.
---
I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajm38m/now_all_i_need_is_that_pesky_preserved_pie/) when I found it on a charred ghoul and was so proud of myself. All of that time, wasted. I don't even know how to feel right now other than heart broken.
---
I decided to skip steps 1-6 tonight
---
I dont think it's that bad...takes 2 or 3 shots instead of 1 🤷‍♂️
---
Does it really work?  Agree the weight limit could slow it's use down, but won't they just create lots of new characters and add up to the limit.
---
No PA usage :3. I want to play as a wasteland regulator that doesn't use it. I know the META is PA and I get griefed from my friends daily! As for what armor I'm wearing is 4 piece raider and piece leather. I'm current 4/5 Unyielding/Sentinel. I'm getting MERC'd up. I usually run half out silo's which is 3 runs if people I'm playing with take turns. Sometimes its 5 a night. I can run them solo and average 14 to 20 *20mins if blow my legs off multiple times. As for queen I take massive hits because I DON'T move due to sentinel. I incur constant damage in all content I do.
---
Btw thank you for your civility. Today has been a crazy one when all the discussions I'm having LOL.
---
I honestly kind of think that the devs somehow performed fixes on a previous version of the game and pushed that one out to us. 
---
So let's say there's v1.0. They fixed a bunch of bugs and released 1.1. Then they boot up 1.0's code and start fixing that. They then release 1.0.1 accidentally.
---
Oh yeah I was thinking of charleston train station lol. Didn't know that bot sold excavator plans thought it usually was Camden park.
---
Do the math
---
51 =  TS Damage + 20%
---
51 = 120%
---
8.5 = 20%
---
8.5 * .6 = 5.1
---
The math is right. It definitely sucks, though. I was building a heavy for the TSE mini I have. Not anymore, I guess. 
---
See her replies were actually funny, yet again you fail at this thing called banter 
---
Only the player who initiated the quest at Whitesprings can do it. Anyone else who opens that lock pick will get a wanted level. 
---
The outfit you get at the end of the mistress of mystery quest works. Idk if it stacks with your teammates in same outfit or if they have to be in different ones. I think you can also get a grognaks costume in game maybe? Not one hundred percent sure on that one. 
---
Vendor in Harper's Ferry.  Haven't checked since patch.
---
Not to bad 
---
So, your saying your team has never released code with a single defect? Lmao. Well you rock son, you should come to seattle and work for me...except I'll never, ever hire you because someone who thinks their shit doesn't stink does not make for a good teammate...
---
Just here to highlight that serums plan cost up to 23k caps. Yep, 2k under the limit.
---
Why scrap it? Are you for real? You want them to stop developing something that appeases other players that play different to you? Are you dumb? It's a separate mode... What's wrong with that? And Bethesda themselves said more PvE is being worked on too. Absolutely no reason why we can't have both which will make more people happy and potentially increase the player base.
---
Apparently they patched the game from 2 builds ago
---
All the old bugs are back. That one was the game not registering your gear reductions/additional carry weights iirc
---
Simple Ash Rose Tea also gives +1 CHR
---
Count me in as one more free spot on the servers. The grind in this game for mediocre loot already sucked.
---
And let's keep in mind that the build calculator we all use didn't even come from Bethesda.
---
Convo over, your now back peddling, you got caught lying about name calling in a visible post, and I said "Direct me to your modding work", give me the link...a IT guy of 40 years definately made a lot of mods, show me..quit your lying, back peddling and show proof, or go to bed :)
---
That sucks. My condolences.
---
I've been really considering this today.  There are some baller new mods that have come out for FO4 since I've started playing FO76 too.  And the Skyrim SE Co-op mod is about to be released out of beta in a matter of weeks.
---
S'funny b/c just last week I was watching a youtube trailer about the FO4 mods thinking "Ah well, I'll not go back to FO4, I mean FO76 is better why go backwards?"
---
I'd love to have both. but i know it can't be that way.
---
I've stopped playing and was excited about today's patch, but more bug fixes will not bring back any of the players that are like me.
---
This is one of the few games i bought on release, i kinda want to not regret it. but i can't stand playing the game when there's literally nothing to do after you've finished the ~~fetch~~ main quest.
---
Just in case nerfing explosive weapons *and* explosive perks wasn't enough. The coupling of incompetence with poor judgment is, truly, a sight to behold.
---
But karma!! /s
---
Another cute trick is hopping over to Pleasentville. Once made into omelets the mothman eggs are worth a decent penny. And they give +2 or +3 chr (I forget)
---
I have 3 industrial water purifiers and could have more. Leave em alone for an hour or so and you pull out 15 water which is (with perks and stuff) clost to 100 caps on their own.
---
And since I pick up tons of junk, I can usually bundle more than enough to cap out without any real effort just wandering around having fun killing things.
---
That was kinda random. I want to agree but I can’t quite make sense of it. Are you saying they are senile? 
---
Technically her buff, is our nerf. 
---
😅
---
Yea but the people that go crazy over this insignificant shit are the same people that have been screaming from the rooftops the Fallout was getting shutdown, then the said it was going free to play... this is just the new fad... they’re always wrong...
---
this is the sort of thing modders can fix in an afternoon while looking for r-rated skyrim mods.
---
I've always just assumed Beth was lazy, not downright incompetent.
---
I would say furious or anti armor is about it for interesting legendary items 
---
It says “get the supply drop” in the same way that Skyrim gave good characters the objective to join the thieves guild, they suggest you commit crime in case you want to know, but it’s not Necessary.
---
I just realized this might mean the infinite carry weight glitch is back as well.
---
Same behavior on XB1
---
Hi All, just a note on what Vendors now have available to them, @Ladydevaan was able to get some further info on this which might help explain things a bit more for those that are interested.

---
No that sounds super wrong. Are you using maxed pistol dmg perks?  Ive got like +50% from guerilla perks and my 10mm auto does like 51dmg. Executioners with no exploding 
---
Bahaha come on champ your the one getting butt hurt posting every where. Just calling you out, but hey you type well for someone with his head up toddies a*s. Ya got some brown stuff on ya nose
---
I know what he was referencing, I just think it's unnecessary to bring up politics in things completed unrelated. Maybe I'm just too jaded with all the constant divisive crap reported and like to come 5o reddit to avoid all of that. 
---
DEVASTATING INSULT! YOU HAVE SHUTDOWN HIS RETORTS VIA REFERENCE OF PROSTITUTION -BRILLIANT!!!
---
BOOM! Exactly. Get the PvE content made up and fit the PvP content in around that. Instead we get some half-cocked PvE and PvP thing.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's still some more fallout, I still shove a 2mm shard of death through the brainpan of some enemies but after a while it just feels like you've finished Fallout 4 and are just dicking around.
---
I think they need to disconnect explosive legendaries from explosive perks. 
---
The gun just does aoe now, your welcome. No you don't need a %200 damage bonus on top of that.
---
Then either bring back the perk values, and probably buff explosive weapons in general by another 50%.
---
The also need to bring damage bonuses to energy weapons to the science perks, but that is another issue.
---
who relies on crafted stim packs anyway
---
You’re very strident.
---
Take my upvote 
---
Oof. Doesn't make me feel better necessarily, just more aggravated at Bethesda for this patch, tbh. I guess making the plans free could be construed as a good change in general (even if it screwed you over, it might help others). But that really sucks for you
---
Because for some reason, games are judged by their PvP modes to determine their longevity these days. Destiny 2 literally banked on their PvP when they first released that they gimped the abilities so hard they were useless in PvE. Hell, Anthem won’t even work for PvP, and the devs said they won’t do PvP, but it’s gotten so bad they said PvP is up to the community. Idiots see a cool PvE game and think “Oh boy, how can I ruin the fun fro everyone else just so I can prove to everyone that I’m superior.”

Oh just noticed your handle. Psychotic.  
---
crazy how your losing your shit trying to go back and re-word the post to save face, they are all right there for me to see too, just stop, ..busted and move on we will never cross paths again I hope
---
I dunno about that, it seems like a larger stash is something that the game should come with. OTOH, if they made it cost as many atoms  as you can get in your first few hours of playing, it wouldn't be too bad. more like something you unlock with more gameplay.
---
Reminds me of the shit DayZ devs get but for the exact opposite thing lol
---
Same. Unreal 
---
Im lauging so hard...that I'm cryin'
---
Well if you don’t want loot boxes and believe me I don’t want loot boxes in this game then it has to be monetised in some other way and buying cool costumes/decorations for my house is something I can get behind a 100%! Now if only they sold wallpaper. 
---
Look, everyone at Bethesda needs to be working on the mission where you date an Assaultron.  It may be the single finest idea to ever have occurred to a human being, and I am including computers and toasters in that.
---
You know, I was thinking this when I took some dude's workshop and he came back spitting mad with his TSE. When he actually shot me with it, it was an easy one shot. But using terrain, VATS and jumping in on his reloads, he wasn't able to reclaim it because I was putting him down faster and more reliably. Finished him off the last time with a handmade. 
---
TSE can't buy you invincibility.
---
Teardrops on my guitar🎶
---
TSE should have been nerfed long ago. You know what will be agreed now for SBQ? The second most OP thing that will be found.
---
Good riddance TSE. 
---
yes. parties get insane bonuses as it is.
---
overwatch? literally any mmo?
---
New content is coming in a few months with a dlc we will probably have to pay $30 for!
---
Windows 10 64 bit is 20 gigs
---
Someone should really read all of the patch notes. Explosive only does +20% dmg now instead of +100%.
---
My marsupial isn't working either. I logged in, got one marsupial-height jump in, then it quit working. No Rad-X, haven't lost the mutation.
---
Harper's Ferry is Free States, Watoga Station is not affiliated with any faction but does share its caps pool with Grahm. 
---
Umm... Yeah, I'm not reading all of that.
---
Just on your title alone though, they're doing the right thing. Fixing bugs and balancing the game should come WAY before new content.
---
The only real issue is that since the game launch in such an abysmal state, we have a LOT of bugs to fix and things to balance.
---
I got a hidden base with lead and ticks for stimpak, only repaired one wall and my red rocket door in 2 months.

Well we have this thing called the Electoral College that in certain cases allows for someone to win an election without the most votes.  So, a majority of Americans did vote for Clinton, but got Trumped.  The Electoral College is embedded in the Constitution as a result of something known as “the great compromise” which long story short has to do with slavery.  Since it’s part of the Constitution it’s hard to change.  So, maybe that explains some of the sour grapes in our country.
---
Weird thing was I saw this guy oneshotting stuff with what I assume was TSE double barrel and maybe gauss rifle, while me with my tse lever action and combat shotgun I feel like I have the same experience as you. 5 shotgun shells to kill a watoga lvl 50 robot and 3 to kill a lvl 38 legendary 0 star robot.
---
Lol, basically. But maybe with real test servers it wouldn't have to feel that way.
---
I agree with that in a general sense, but iirc, the amount of stash space saved by bulking Lead and Aluminium wasn’t a great deal anyway.
---
I would imagine, that if you’re having this problem often, a good solution would be to keep a useful amount of these material loose. Only bulk what is deemed to be surplus, sell anything surplus.
---
The intent of the change is to stop people accidentally scrapping mods, etc. that they wanted to hold on to. BSG have apparently decided to apply the change “once and for all” by ensuring that EVERYTHING other than loose junk/scrap is safe in crafting/repairing situations. 
---
I agree.  I just, I dunno, the fun has been replaced with disappointment and frustration.  I have enough of that in my life.  I don't need my entertainment to add more of that.
---
That really isn't a lot of caps for a recipe especially at the point in the game where you burn through them.  New players and lower levels can get by with food and healing salves.
---
Finally fucking Christ.
---
screeshot first! :P Better yet, post his entire post history there :D

That's just sad.
---
My explosive radium rifle only does 63 damage now.
---
Went to West Tek and had to run away for the first time since I was &lt;level 50. I turned the game off after 10 minutes of play.
---
350 hours in and I'm officially done with Fallout 76.
---
Boo hoo.. My 10k damage from the 65$ TSE sniff sniff i bought on ebay sob sob and my 50k bobbly heads are gone... boo hoo
---
It hasn't been a thing in previous Fallout games, only in the single player version of 76, called Fallout 4. No such thing in Fallout 1, 2, 3 or New Vegas.
---
Also, every skill is something to build your gameplay around as that's the beauty and intent of various skills: you should experiment with making your own builds, and why not a cap stash collector one, if it's fun? Some people like to constantly grind White Springs or the Scorchbeast queen and others like collecting cap stashes. Punishing me for finding MY own way to feel fulfilled in a game is weak-minded, especially that grinding and farming has been a part of pretty much every online game that has resources. I suppose I am expected to just blindly follow well known, safe builds and do everything like everyone else.
---
It's not like I'm glitching into devrooms, stacking bobbleheads to kill everybody or duping items. I'm just trying to have fun my way without messing with others or f\*cking up their gaming experience.
---
Thx!
---
I'm done with Fallout after this nerfing bullshit. They took it way too far. Now it's time to sit back and watch the fuckery from Reddit as entertainment
---
&gt;”We will continue to support the game with free dlc for as long as people are playing it”

This dumpster fire is a planned burn my dudes.
---
*mic drop*

I’ve dumped hundreds of them into various newbie areas.  Never had the need to craft them because i come across so many in the wild
---
My Tse lever gun went from 439 damage to 173. It's still a fun gun but now my All rise beats the damage by 18. My non legendary shotgun does almost as much damage as my three star legendary lever gun now.
---
Thanks to the crew at BGS. Im sorry im out here busting your balls but, as a long-time fan... Im deeply concerned. As worried as I get, Im holding onto some faith ya'll pull thru. Keep up the hard work and know I  appreciate it!! (No matter how hard I am on ya) &lt;3 
---
I'm laughing at the people who can't afford to buy them.
---
Testy testy!  Have fun with that son!  Remember, Daddy still loves you!
---
What they should have done was look at why it felt mandatory. White Knight felt mandatory not because of an extra 30%, White Knight felt Mandatory because of how quickly armour breaks without it. It's still mandatory in my opinion with the current durability of armour. This was just a lazy approach, they looked at their data and went "white knight gets used too often, nerf it" instead of "White Knight is used too often, let's do a deep dive to understand why"
---
Yeah...I'm not a teenager that can constantly be milking the game for every possible cap.  I pop on now and then and play for the small amount of time available to me before the living hell that is my life takes over once again.  I will never be able to afford any of this crap.
---
Every time people post it's downvoted. Some people are very shitty about this game and seem to have down vote bots downvoting all new posts. It's not about being positive or negative.
---
Fucking DAMN
---
1.  Make Junk, Ammo, and non-condition Aid items weigh 0 in the stash.  A name and quantity variable is not what is destabilizing the servers.  Dupers with thousands of UNIQUE items with different condition bars drags on database server recall times.
---
2. Sure.
---
3. **NO, please STOP asking for this.**  The griefers and the trolls will be non-stop blowing up your vending machines (for fun, because they don't like your prices, no reason at all).  Make them indestructible terminals in the basement of Whitesprings.  So you can visit ALL of the player vendors on that server in one location.
---
4. Yes please.
---
5. Yes please.
---
6. Change that to 5% and I'm fully behind this idea.  Allow us to GRIND our own weapons and gear.  This will make duper gear LESS valuable.
---
7. Yes please.
---
8. Sure.
---
9. I can understand if the turret AI takes up too much server performance.  Let us craft BETTER turrets for more materials.  Make it take flux, ballistic fiber, ultracite, black titanium.  Make them hit harder, have longer range, and have more HP.
---
10. Sure.
---
11. Yes please.  Just like Known Plans Mod, there's already a Perk Loadout Mod.  Pay the modders and incorporate their mods into the game. Ark did this, and people loved it.
---
12. Yes please.
---
13. Yes please.
---
14. Yes please, also see answer to number 9.
---
15. **YES MORE CONTENT PLEASE**
---
I don’t see it as pay to win. How can it be if it only lasts till Monday week...
---
You’d be mental to buy the outfit just for the added 15HP.
---
I see it as a marketing gig to promote cosmetic sales.
---
Which doesn’t bother me in the slightest. 
---
I’d be happy to spend my accumulated 3000 atoms if I saw something that I wanted. Just waiting till something drops at the atom shop for that. 
---
Its hard to use perk cards when your using all those points for weight reduction, so with this nerf patch we have to waste points into perception to get 90% damage now? Like I was already switching points into INT to get the explosive demolition 5 and now that perk card feels like it doesn't even help TSE anymore. I remember that perk boosting 200 damage TSE to 400.
---
How cool would it be if pacifying an animal or creature was more complex?
---
For example, you can pacify 1 creature and then that animal adds a health and food bar by yours. That way you have a companion that you can feed and level up and watch grow into a bigger glowing creature. The more you invest, the stronger and more helpful it gets. For example, you pacify a malnourished mongrel and raise it up to be a glowing bloodhound that can help you fight and find bobbleheads. Feed it, heal it, and stim it if it dies.
---
I mainly want this so someone can visit my camp and be all "What the heck is that!?!"
---
Oh her? That's my mirelurk queen that I raised as a little mirelurk... ain't she cute!?!
---
I may also want this because I have trouble making human friends in the wasteland...
---
Fun fact: you didn't have 8-16 fully sentient player helping you in the fight.
---
Then why does the game tell me to go and open it?
---
Wait regular stimpack recipe cause I bought mine at the enclave bunker for 94 caps
---
Not a 2 shot just explosive
---
I work in IT. Version Control isnt armchair development. Its development 101, and theres really no excuse for this.
---
Heaven forbid, we want a product we purchased, to work as intended.
---
I am ok with these nerfs. What makes it bad is the fact that they are leaving melee as powerful as it is. 
---
Yes.  Both the outfit and the armor.  It didn't help.
---
I don't really follow your point... 
---
Also interested!!
---
bloodied with sentinel/cavalier. maybe aa.
---
or just melee. a regular meathook is probably stronger than any ranged weapon at this point.
---
I've gotten that event to start just once, been playing since beta. I just made a new character and bought the plan in Harper's Ferry after hitting 15. 
---
hahah yes change the subject..are you a female, cause thats how a woman concedes to a argument, they change the subject or bring something up from 15 years ago, How did we get to this point in our relationship Collie..HOW DAMMIT! It seems like just yesterday.....see now you made me emotional hahaha
---
Not trying to be an asshole. But wasn't everyone complaining they can't be a raider and surprise attack people? Or threaten players with mininukes and rockets?
---
Get ready for their next big idea, cap stashes can only be opened with your credit card! :P
---
Fwiw I think I found a trapper dense at harpers ferry pre patch 
---
Not to trash-talk Bethesda... but this paint never deserved to be 1800 to begin with. Even at sale price, it's kind of questionable. Shame this didn't make it into Appalachia.. I'll never get to use it.  😢
---
Gawd, you're such a whiny moron... oh wait.
---
That's a fair point
---
Ah excellent! Least you know now!
---
I guess mod's are going to get borked after each update for a day or two.
---
Thanks for letting u know :D
---
I killed two ghouls, on the sky bridge, near flatwoods after the patch.  About 30 seconds after I killed them they literally got up and started walking. They took no damage and proceeded to continue walking on air when they walked off the bridge.  I never saw them despawn but I lost them due to LOS. 
---
Those were bad but not this bad
---
Actually, the primadonnas doing all the bitching about it are the new multiplayer mob that never saw a Bethesda title or its bugs, who came in from CoD and Fortnite because their 17yo streamer overlords told them to. 
---
They’re the same mob who whines about bugs as if bugs make or break Bethesda games, thinking it would affect Bethesda as it would a bling and polish title like CoD or Fortnite. 
---
And now they’re whining about their precious TSE weapons getting nerfed. 
---
They don't feel really good just decent or average now. You can probably run bloodied and do more damage then tse.
---
Yea me too, only it was marine. Looking for trapper but not at harpers or watoga. 
---
Hate to say it but it might be worth pulling a Final Fantasy 14 and shutdown the servers for a few months.    I think it would be the best chance to save the game in the long run at this point.
---
would be great if it was, just for the fact you can find the bodies easily w/ recon.
---
Star Trek Online, DC Universe Online, Secret World Legends had a good new content rate until some months ago,  Almost 1/3 of mobile games.....
---
Depends on wheter the companies want to keep their playerbase or just milk the ones that can't stop buying things like lockboxes.
---
I played many games like those, also I'm no child, played Maniac Mansion on release, and some games on my old ATARI wich I don't even remember their names :)
---
Interesting. I’d love to see that, I have been to a couple places that have them a couple times each, making a mental list of how many caps I’m going to need, and it’s always been the same price. 
---
2 days of labor I spent grinding an alt to level 15....so about $300.
---
Or you can just go to Harper's Ferry now that everyone can buy them there.
---
can you ask if there is lore behind this, /u/jessbethesda? sorry to tag but it's gonna trigger me for a long time if I don't 
---
When I found mine it was from Watoga Shopping Plaza, so go look there as well as the train station. 
---
Dale a tu cuerpo
---
Ye
---
“STEAL FROM” is clear, in the picture. /shrug
---
The inevitable ones. If the game manages to stay afloat, there are already areas that are clearly going to be endgame dungeons. It would be a terrible decision beyond their current ones if it didn't happen.
---
Maybe this will help perspective, because i was much like you. 
---
And then i found the plans for combat armor, which i dont have mods for and then a 3* Gauss Rifle, which i **also** dont have mods for. I was managing my armor without a care for a while, massive stocks of junk. However, i needed an upgrade and the weapon had no mods. 
---
Building and scrapping combat armor and gauss rifles consumes a **lot** of material. My nest egg is completely gone, and to fix the dent i'm going to need to spend quite a fair amount of time collecting resources, as i still dont have my required mods, and my current placeholder armor is broken. 
---
Thanks, I will! Good luck!
---
I thought I was going crazy!   I can't fix or make ANYTHING
---
What? "I work in IT" is no excuse! Unless you work on Fallout 76 or something similar (or have in the past) you really \_ARE\_ an arm-chair dev. 
---
Yeah this stuff is SUPER frustrating, but your take on it is delusional, and you not realizing is completely inline with the great vision you've shown so far. I'm surprised there aren't more people who have a clue point this out to you.
---
I mean I get the idea. Make it easier for everyone to buy the plans. But when you have a 1200 limit on caps at vendors and enemies drop 6 to 12 caps.......but here is the kick in the face for me. I role play as a vendor who sells plans, weapons and items. This has now made selling my plans more difficult in the market since anyone can get them. Not to mention with the weight limit... Well I'm not sure how too keep up? Plus now with the patch my build is going to take several levels to repair.
---
I hate to say it, but I think it's time I put my power armor up and play a new game. 
---
I misunderstood that reference and was thinking it was talking about items like ignition cores which scrapped automatically.
---
Well here’s something from my native tongue haere koe ki te pupuhi
---
Guess it gets down voted because you dont want to know? Or because you have the plans and dont want others to have access?
---
My dog gets angry at me when I play. He walks in the room...looks at me.....gives me a look of disgust....and walks away.
---
I think I'm going to spend more time with him. This game wasn't worth it.
---
Caps grinding is literally the most boring aspect of this game. Collecting vendor trash and logging on every 20 hours to clear the vendors is tedious and unfun.
---
I see someone has worked in a Support/QA position before.
---
Somebody get the OP a Snickers©.
---
Because there is a general sense of expectation that the game should work as advertised (in the example of the Bobby pins said above). While you are entitled to your opinion and rightly ever so forgiving as a fanboy, others differ. 
---
Its (imo) "pretty ridiculous" not to scroll past a post that doesn't deserve your valued opinion, but instead indulge in subjective opinionated views that "people are SOOO upset" that in your sense it's "pretty ridiculous". 
---
I want to feel bad for you, but you bought that game...lol
---
Never said someone should be fired. In fact, I emphasized thats NOT what I'm asking for. Try reading.
---
Heaven forbid we want a product we paid for to work as advertised. Guess that's YOUR definition of entitlement. 
---
lol crybaby can't cap stash farm for thousands of caps a day and is now whining about high prices. 
---
Better go pay some duper rl money for cals, this game is just too hard for kids.
---
Havnt played since I got killed and lost all my loot without engaging with another player. Bring back single player for the next fallout or you will continue to lose a large part of your base
---
Your players don't matter. You aren't playing a game. You're playing a marketing technique. I play video games. I don't play cash grabs. 
---
Use and still use executioner's. Slow start but kills quickly in the end and anyone using bloodied you'll be able to kill fairly quick.
---
I heard grafton had them, but idk if serving hopping will refresh it. Are you after marine or combat dense?
---
Most bugs are worth delaying content for...
---
They are also probably working on content at the same time.
---
When fixing bugs you are always balancing the severity with the amount of time the fix will take.  I'm guessing that fixing those 30 don't really amount to much time compared with making more content.
---
In general we need a stable game, not more content.  I'm guessing there are plenty of people that haven't gone through all the content yet - myself being one of them.  And just because you didn't care about those fixes doesn't mean that nobody does.
---
Yes. Everyone on all three platforms.
---
I think it is definitely forgivable. What would really be bad is if they waited a week or more to fix the things that they re-broke. I'm a little  surprised it wasn't done today.
---
Of the 72 bug fixes that I listed as "don't care" which of those do you consider CRITICAL fix right now bugs?
---
I'm guessing that number won't reach 35, let alone 72.  They're fixing a lot of small borderline issues people don't experience, experience only some of the time, and some don't affect general gameplay.
---
They can scale back on that small crap and toss in a little content.
---
Hmm... Look I get people generally don't read TOS but seriously dude, anyone should know selling for real world money is just not acceptable.
---
Yeah I don't get why this nerf can't just apply to player vs player and not pve content. They already implemented lvl gap reductions in damage. So, now the queen will take maybe the whole time to kill her if she doesn't glitch fly to the out-of-bounds instead of a few minutes only to get junk ultracite plans that anyone that did BoS storyline can learn the full set.
---
I had something better typed up, but it was deleted when my phone locked.
---
For me, it hasnt gotten better. Last thing that was good was STASH increase, this time around only the things to do with plans are good. And even still, now the grind for plans in the wild is gone, and now its a grind for caps. I use to have some problems with stability, now it seems my only issue with that comes from wearing a helmet. Not wearing it is a compromise on my end. No new content, just nerfs to the game. I use to wonder why everyone complained so much. I use to wonder why people were angry at the money they spent. Yes, Beth is involved, which is nice to know, but it seems the people in charge of the Atom Store are also in charge of all development. And im not sure they play the games. Ladydev might not need to pass things on if she actually played and got to see things firsthand.
---
There were aspects of the game that were annoying, yes, but it had more to do with who was playing and how those people were playing, not anything to do with weapons or perks.
---
Im sure just not allowing Bobbles to be stacked would have sufficed. But when you change 10 things to fix one problem, youll never know what actually worked.
---
Exploiters will forever exploit. Theyll just find something new. Just avoid those people. If they keep fixing exploits by changing things for those who dont, nothing will work, and there wont be a game anymore.
---
Again, i had something a little more put together written up, but bath time and crazy kids takes its toll haha
---
I’m server hopping on PS4 and just as I found him another player ran out and killed him. :(
---
I don't have a problem with melee doing solid damage because you have the added risk of needing to get close, and constantly needing to repair armor, etc.  Melee should be good once you finally start wailing.  
---
I also agree that explosive needed a nerf, though I think 2 shot was fine.  
---
All told I think ranged got overly nerfed.  they dropped 2 shot to 25% base dmg bonus and explosive to 20%, perhaps 40% each would have been a better middle ground.
---
Because Bethesda made a PVPVE game not a PVE game. 
---
There's 1 or 2 things in the game that encourage PVP, you know about this one now so can ignore it when the quest pops up cant you :)
---
That would break this subreddit.
---
And then imagine feeling the need to go online and write a long rant telling everyone exactly how mad you are and why you're quitting and needing to be the center of attention for your decision to stop playing a game. 
---
When there's a dupe method people just need to come out and say what it is.
---
If it spreads wide enough then BSG will have to do something about it right away and not wait until the next patch cycle. Right?
---
THIS
---
I haven't played FO76 since, like, the first week of December. I actually forget that I own this game more often than not.
---
Yea, I found that today is the first day since launch that I kinda just said meh and didn't play at all. I did the vendor runs and logged out.
---
I think I remember Todd say game and all future content would be free, but not 100% sure as it was really late here when I watched the E3
---
I'm after the real combat armor and trapper actually. 
---
Que tu cuerpo es pa' darle alegría y cosa buena
---
(Hare koe ki te **pupuchi** - you don't even know your own language 😂😂).
---
Bethesda could learn a lot by just looking at which mods are popular.  Seriously.  Just hire a few modders as freelancers for a month!
---
Yeah man, my beloved gauss rifle is an airsoft gun now and I spent like two weeks playing to cater my build to my find. Totally feel your pain. Really gonna be hard to keep playing after this 
---
Watoga station too. 1.8k caps.
---
punished for ...you mean a 10 cap bounty or whatever, its hardly punishment or a major problem.
---
Mods AND plans?
---
So your solution is to not actually play the game the way it was intended? And therefore its not broken?
---
&gt;and, unfortunately, LEAST of all
---
That was the most minor point. And the point was about bad mechanics in the game more than it was about the perk itself. 
---
Now that they don't have a perk over inflating it's damage they can properly address their overall lack of damage
---
DayZ Standalone was an abomination.....lol  I had such hope for it.  I hope they can do better.  I have LESS than 40 HOURS in DayZ Standalone :)
---
DayZ Mod however was pretty damn good.  Hard to install / load / manage, but once it was setup it worked pretty well.  I played DayZ mod for YEARS.
---
Same, trapper ive seen the mod before patch at watoga, but no luck on combat
---
Bloodied Rolling Pin! 🤣
---
Also if you have the cannibal perk you can eat any scorched enemy. I ate some scorched bloodbugs yesterday.
---
You made the guns really shitty! How the hell are we going to kill the queen scorched beast when you made it so weak now I can’t even kill a damn wolf. 
---
Geez bro......it was sarcasm. You can buy the plans anywhere now.
---
Besides I'm not playing anymore after this update so F Bethesda and their ToS.
---
Using a Custom.ini?
---
Sorry, 14 years. HUGE difference.
---
Or it's reported &amp; deferred in favor of other bugs.
---
I just went to craft a hand made gun. It said I was missing material that I know I have. Turns out mats bundled in bulk are not being counted. I had to scrap my bulk items to be able to use them then rebundle them to be able to store them. 
---
This game is suck a clusterf*ck I LOVE watching the drama surrounding its incompetence. 
---
What language do you think I’m speaking? As a native speaker I’ll go off what I know and not what you can google in that hobble you live in lol.
---
Interestingly enough, Marsupial isn't working for me, either, and it's showing carry weight +30, INT -6, and + jump height.  Bird Bones is showing AGI +6, STR -6, and reduced fall speed. Healing Factor is showing regen +300% and chem effects -82%.
---
So yeah, shit's fucked up.
---
Unfortunately, the way Beth's file system works, they have to replace an entire large file every time they make even one simple change. It's easier and more efficient for them to put in a bunch of changes before replacing it.
---
melee.
---
or bloodied/aa if you wanna go against Beth's wishes.
---
I always discard used ammo in the cigarette machines or mailboxes near vendors.
---
Yikes.
---
Appdev; but I've worked closely with QA. :)
---
I will forgive it, when they either merge fixes or roll back. Just...fix this, its embarrassing. 
---
If it goes on any length of time, YouTube will have a ball...
---
I'm laughing because anyone who buys in game weapons for real cash is an idiot.
---
Haha wuh... lol as soon as you started with "what language do you think..." i stopped reading. 
---
I'm fine with this change but only if the vendor cap limits are raised. As it is I wipe out their caps in maybe 30 minutes of playing, and then wtf do I do? Go play something else because logging on every 20 hours to earn my daily caps is the most boring, tedious shit. 
---
Same here
---
so a 4 man dungeon say, how does what bonus's another group that's not in your dungeon effect you and your team?
---
Seriously doubt 15 hp will be make or break for these instances that aren't in the game yet and haven't even been announced
---
That’s 10x what I paid.  Yikes.  They really want everyone to grind for as long as possible it seems.
---
That said, did they have all of the chem recipes available?  I believe Stimpaks and Antibiotics were pinned and always available and they would rotate the chem recipes.
---
Agreed. My character is completely fucked also. My build is so jacked now, that I am getting taken out by mobs that are 30 levels lower than me. I can't even kill a scorchbeast now or even a assaultron. Every battle I get into is literally a fucking battle to survive with a ton of ammo being dumped. My damage output is only 20 percent of what is was pre patch. 
---
Hire the modders XD
---
Is it for any level or only 15 through 40
---
21:9 inverts the accuracy. I tested many things but the only thing that fixed it was switching to 16:9.
---
THANK YOUx76
---
Yeah I plan to keep it in case they get buffed, but now I have to work around that 20lbs. Not sure if I want to keep using it, though. It's just that I spent SO much time looking for a good legendary, and four days after I find one, it gets nerfed by a huge margin. Like, I can't even tell you how long I'd wanted one of these, and refused to buy one from the dozens of dupers that sell them. 
---
never be a fanboy about anything.
---
shitty consumer practice.
---
From my perspective fallout 76 and any merchandise based off of fallout 76 as been and always has been a means of making maximum profit while cutting down on quality, quantity, resources, time, funding and effort and even reusing old assets. Alot of people will argue that im wrong and im just a hater but no i did look forward to the game for ages and really enjoyed it when it finally came out but all of these business practices and the way they have handled the game has just ruined it for me i cant support this type of company.
---
There's a difference between anger and irritation. We all know there are other video games out there, you don't need to childishly threaten to leave for another game, you could just go play another game, and maybe not tell everyone about it. People here, in the FO76 sub, aren't interested in your tale of leaving, so leave quietly.
---
You’re no fool! This game is for winners lol
---
Lol so buff everything and nerf nothing is balance?
---
What games do that?
---
Well your lucky you had one given to you from the start some of us had to play with shit weapons to lvl 150 only to spend all caps saved to get one and then only enjoy it for few weeks to have them gutted. There is a thing with nerfing a weapon and destroying its value. And them touching the perk card ruins explosive weapons like missle lauchers, fatman, auto, etc those weapons were already pretty bad.
---
Please get them to add some kind of way to farm nuke zones in armor instead of a hazmat suit or power armor. I suggest using the linings and helmets as a way to add rad resist up to the level of the hazmat suit.
---
I guess raiders are fucking insane. why are you here if you want the game to die?
---
I bet it would take a week since they scaled back the size of their dev team.
---
Lets hope. 
---
Then again, they keep changing it, and so will we have to. I want to play the game, not have to keep making adjustments because others want things easy.
---
Work on stability, work on content. Figure out who actually exploits the game, and punish them, not everyone else.
---
That isn't the tricentennial.
---
They're too worried about nerfing weapons and perks that make the game fun and less tedious, and fixing little stuff nobody cares about rather than oh, you know, bugs that cause the game to crash or become mostly unplayable. By the time they get around to adding content for the game, IF they do, most of the players will be gone. 
---
I used to defend the shit out of this game to everyone that said it sucked. Now I've joined the ranks 🤷‍♂️ 
---
I help create software solutions. Making sure you release the correct fucking version of a fix, is pretty basic stuff. I'm only asking for competent leadership for an ongoing service I purchased a license to use.
---
Is that really so much?
---
What about with +2 charisma alcohol?
---
respect must be easier if they want nerf perks.
---
For some reason this patch today really did make the game feel a lot more boring. Once your lvl 100+ and have done pretty much everything the game has to offer the only thing left to really do is loot for rare items. I got tired of having to put 3 magazines into a grasshopper just to be able to do so. The TSE’s made the game fun in the sense that you could spend more time looting the world and less time fighting 3 gulpers for two hours. It’s one thing if you were running around killing other players with the TSE’s but I don’t understand what the big deal is if you’re using it strictly for PvE..
---
If someone sold you a car that underperformed every statistic it was touted for you would be pissed and demand it be made right. This is on a smaller scale but the same. The game is not performing to the standards it was sold as. This patch undid fixes to try to make it work properly. This isn't about a simple weapons Nerf. This is about breaking things that were fixed and making basic functions needlessly harder. 
---
I feel your pain.
---
I have a power armor character that picked a bunch of cards that don't work with power armor- the card descriptions say nothing about that.  It's infuriating.
---
Yeah, I could start a new character, but thinking about doing the DMV quest yet again makes me want to just go take a nap instead.
---
No worries friend, I figured it was generalized. And Exactly. I'm a little hardcore myself, especially in survival games, but I understand that not everyone is ok with or has time for 24 hour grind sessions. I'm just trying to put out discussion to make sure everyone does have fun. I wouldn't like to be wandering around farming just to be one shot sniped and lose all of my stims because some dude went into PvE and farmed safely yknow?
---
800 hours?
---
They said it from the very beginning: if you want to play solo, it's possible. If you don't want to engage in PvP, you do not have to and players who are trying to make you anyways will get punished.
---
So I doubt they added this quest as a way to trick players into PvP. In my case it isn't even PvP, but frantically checking railway stations hoping someone will be there and trying to convince them to shoot me which is particularly hard if you're limited to a few "emoticons" and you happen to stumble upon a player who does not get the combination of "help" and "taunt".
---
Saw them today at level 66. 
---
Why can't we have both?  Like damn . You guys are beyond salty. Pvp is virtually non existent. 
---
lol, still a dick move.
---
Thanks for the kind words everyone. :)   
---
Ya, thanks Tips
---
Why are so many people bulking scrap they aren't selling in the first place? As a shotgun build just thinking of all that wasted plastic is painful. 
---
Yeah I’m bad at reddit sorry. 
---
Base damage for my level 5 TSE pump action is now 97. With demolition expert ranked all the way up it does 107. So two extra points of damage per rank of demo expert. Now I have 5 useless points allocated to intelligence on my lvl 40 character.
---
Oooookay......
---
I as Player stayed and sucked in all the Bugs you delivered so far.
---
I thought; They will make it, they have Numbers and whatnot.
---
I fought your Stash Limit and had more to play with Micromanagement than actually play the Game i payed for.
---
For an Respec i had to grind LvL's hard to change Points and so forth. That took time and was not in the Category "Fun".
---
But Now....this:
---
* **Weapons:** The Explosive legendary mod’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +20% of base weapon damage, with explosive radius damage.
---
* **Weapons:** The Two Shot legendary effect’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage.
---
So....WHO is that "King of guessing Numbers" on the Team of yours? These Numbers are NOT based of Numbers you gathered, this is pure Lottery. 80% Nerf + 75% Nerf. Lol? Rly? You just think; "Ah that Number looks good, let's do that"? Or are you Dev's that actually care and see on the Servers what's going on?
---
I'm an Old Gaming Fart, if seen many Games raise and fall but i had patience and good will. This is gone now with that Patch. I will uninstall it as i type here and never ever touch it with an 10 foot Pole, be assured. Because now a Respec with "non-dmg Weapons" would be even more boring and i will NOT wait until you guys "guess" your next Numbers for a Buff just to make me eventually Respec again. You did not even give a free respec to everyone to compensate. Honestly; How Dare you? How?
---
I'm done with Fallout 76. Have Fun with your soon Empty Servers with 1 Endgame Activity.....
---
I'm so done.......
---
PS: Yes, we needed some corrections, no doubts, but thi is just BY FAR over the Top.
---
No I didn't need them before however I now have to grind some levels and respect
---
It's a video game. Play it or don't. Who gives a fuck. 
---
No, but thanks for checking! Used to have a custom .ini before widescreen support. I've uninstalled/reinstalled and manually deleted all leftover files.
---
Must have been added to the “do not scrap” category that mods were added to. GG Bethesda, fix it break it repeat. 😐 Getting tired of this shit.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
My vats/sneak/rifle build still 1 shots most things.
---
Play like a pirate, and get all the booty XD
---
Ill take it with a grain of salt especially coming from a mick.
---
That is a poor balancing philosophy but I see wear you're coming from. Guns and energy weapons do need to be stronger.
---
Ouch ok thanks 
---
Other than *maybe* the missile launchers, turrets are terrible, even with spotlight support. They often dont see enemies, they miss, they get confused, they are easy to destroy, AND they take a massive chunk of your budget. Plus, almost every time you fast travel to your camp, you get a new enemy spawn ... which turrets fail to deal with adequately. Therefore you are forced to defend your base personally, anyway, almost every time.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Therefore I highly recommend ditching all defenses completely. You get a lot more room to build or add decorations, and you wont miss repairing defenses. And you'll still have to fight the bad guys. May as well go all-out on the awesome design!
---
XBox?  I was there but I didnt see it go below 75%...unless these are two of many of the new impossible.
---
It gives it because again Bethesda made a PVPVE game NOT a PVE game. 
---
You don't have to spend any time looking for a way to get rid of it forget it and someone will come and claim it at some point.
---
Yes you'll die and yes they may take a bit of junk you wanted, but its a PVPve game them's the risks. 
---
Its no big deal being killed in a game though, never know now with TSE being nerfed you might actually defend your 10 cap bounty lol and god forbid enjoy it :)
---
Gotta be somewhere. 
---
826, level 320, no exp cheats, no duping cheats, just playing the game
---
Oh ok. Forgive me. I looked but didn't see a post. 
---
Yeah, White Knight getting a nerf was an unexpected and unhappy surprise.
---
Nobody was asking for this.  I literally have seen ZERO posts where people were asking to nerf that.
---
That explains why 2 crates I saw in whitespring were empty and the third had loot in it. So, basically you can do all the work to get a crate to drop and you go to it and some random fk who is neaby sees it can get all the loot, so you do all the work for moot nice job Bethesda.
---
The problem is the number of players that are pushing...what?  300?  400?  I don't even know.  They obviously have all of the cards, and allowing them to move points around must seem like all problems have been solved.
---
But I have a character in the 60s that only has one lockpick card, and no crafting cards, because I made bad choices or changed my game style as I learned more about the game.
---
I could solo the nuke silos with a TSE Handmade and a TSE shotgun. The silos are meant as dungeons for more than one person though. Bethesda wanted to see a small team cooperate to launch the nukes, not a lone wanderer with a TSE.
---
TSE was far too strong. The nerf was needed. Melee possibly needs a nerf too. But they should also buff the unusable stuff. Energy weapons are useless. Explosive weapons are even worse now because they had to nerf the perk. Automatic weapons in general are weak because they devour so much ammo and break so fast. There are things that need buffs. But the TSEs needed the nerfs.
---
Yes they went up. The prices being adjusted is mentioned in the patch notes. They claimed they have been adjusted to be more expensive because they are more accessible now. Plus they added level requirements for plans. 
---
Woot woot! 
---
Yes
---
“make”? Most likely it’s related to the odd PvP methodology?
---
I've actually noticed the same, no Rad-x or anything else that should suppress it.
---
Lol you’re kidding 
---
More TSE burthurt. What'd you cough up for it, caps or cash? 
---
Amen Brother. Its still something i need because i cannot find a better right leg for my melee build, and its only lvl 25. without shite knight i would never have it fully repaired. 
---
I don't know anymore if they really are better than this. The past 3 months have demonstrated that maybe this is their new normal.
---
I don't want it to be that way but I haven't seen evidence to the contrary yet.
---
So long as they take their time. Polish the game. And do a second release of a spit shined, near perfect, balanced, fun version. 
---
Test it. Closed beta. Invite gardcore grinders and some folks from the Casusl sub, to test. Listen to both groups equally. Then shine it up.
---
Ya. I was wondering the same thing. It sucks.
---
You might be shocked to hear, but I agree with you.
---
Just not on your conclusions.
---
Bethesda's open world games are a completely different class of game than a MMORPG.  MMORPGs are massive shared worlds where the world state is mostly static, and events only happen as necessary, with everything dynamic isolated into instances, which exist in their own bubble universes and never interact with the world.
---
Bethesda's engine is designed for dynamic worlds where the world state in in constant flux, and every object in the world has a script running to maintain it's state.
---
In a MMO, you'd be sent to a location to get a heirloom and find it there.  You then pick up an instance, but the actual object remains, and you pretend to not notice this.
---
In a Bethesda engine game, you physically transfer an item from one location to another, and the actual state of the item modifies the entire world state.
---
76 is trying to make a game more like a Bethesda engine game and less like an MMO.  We already have ESO, and I could never get interested in it despite loving the Elder Scrolls.  Because the universe is static, with randomly injected instances that vaporize the minute I leave.
---
Now, to your point, Bethesda has had to learn that MMOs do things the way they do for practical reasons.  When everyone needs to grab the heirloom, you can't have just one, because the first person who gets it modifies the world state.  See their turning cap stashes into containers for this very reason.
---
But they are experimenting here, trying to make something Creation Engine, not bog standard MMO.  They made it clear it was an experiment before anyone bought it.  And they've made the first multiplayer game I've cared about since Minecraft... Another shared global state game.  I want my actions to matter.
---
Everyone is robots because West Virginia is full of robot replicators.  If I kill a named human you need a lore reason for him to come back.  If I kill a vital robot I see him get rebuilt.  This is them experimenting with shared world state.
---
Now, my fellow 76ers have infinite resurrection, so there's nothing to stop this being the explanation for human NPCs (I don't bat an eye when IMMA_WAAALUIGI reappears after I blow him apart), but that's part of the experimentation.
---
They're making something intentionally not MMO, so MMO players saying that things work differently in MMOs is no shock to them.  They're trying to make something more like Minecraft and they need to feel their way through it, and that means making "stupid mistakes."
---
Nope. 
---
hahaha yep definately female, have a good day Collie!
---
I really dont care if you leave 
---
I have a quad explosive db, it's a giant poo shooter now. 
---
At some point it's time to give up and have someone else craft it for you.
---
&gt;In all seriousness, Thanks for your work CMs we appreciate you.
---
speak for yourself.
---
It breaks after 30 seconds of use from 200%. 
---
Diablo 3 never got PvP.(though it was promised at some point iirc)
---
But the swing speed!  I can one shot things at 200 feet with my lever action and it's not even legendary!  Within 12 seconds all the supermutants at a location are dead!!  Except for the overlord - that took two shots!
---
Doesn't matter how much damage you do if it takes you two seconds to swing!  Fast mollases is still slow!
---
Yep, a slice of swiss cheese has less holes than this game. Wasted money.
---
What about Star Wars Battlefront 2, Battlefielf 5?
---
Found a red outfit last night on the third floor. As you enter the floor from the elevator in the room nearest to the bathroom. Can send a pic if my location isn’t clear 
---
Well shit. Really? What do I use it for now?
---
Dude I agree, my tse pump around 400 had it to 699 or something was great and my ts sniper was beautiful at 242 now pump is 250 something and sniper is 162 which actually now out performs the pump on sniper kills and I can be point blank with the pump but yea agree why bother playing anymore 
---
Don't mock the princess bed!
---
I think Ive only ever recieved one 1* legendary piece of armor from killing mirelurk queens. Theyre definately not worth fighting
---
Sorry. On the bright side, when you stop playing, you won't have to make whingey posts in here.
---
I know what you are saying, I was trying to think of a way to make crafting useful at higher levels in a way that includes wanting some of the recipes. 
---
Fire it! /u/Ladydevann responds and she’s terrific! :-)
---
FICKLE
---
Lol coming from the guy who offered bounty hunting services 😂 man I'm glad I didn't pay you to give up that easily 
---
That explains why it keeps saying that I dont have adhesive! Thank you!
---
Yeah, thought I was being trolled.
---
I have problems with the game, but you're right about the negativity being wildly overblown in many cases. For example, this patch is hilariously broken technically and by design, but it's not the worst thing to ever happen in games. In turn, the people defending the game likewise overdo it, constantly going on about how amazing it is and that anyone not enjoying it must be at fault for their own bad experiences because they rushed to power/didn't read the mostly illegible notes/whatever.
---
My dude that's over a month of time spent playing
---
I agree with this, I’ve never once repaired my armour since I levelled it along with [whatever that luck perk is that repairs armour sometimes]. 
---
Yeah, I'm now downloading a new copy of the game.
---
Patch made it so my game crashes on launch constantly.
---
SO what I got out of this patch was a little crap I kinda wanted, and tons I didn't care about, and the inability to play the game.
---
And of course the launcher isn't working correctly.  So now I'm restarting my computer again.
---
It is only 15hp and for less than a week before it disappears. It is a very minor bonus that is short term. Not a big deal. I agree that it wasn't necessary as the costumes were enough by themselves but it is definitely not play to win.
---
There is very easy ways to "add" content with little effort.
---
1. Flood the map with events and make fast travel free to join them. Many of the events don't trigger because (I suppose) nobody come by near the zone where they take place.
---
2. Add legendaries ennemies (scaling to player's level) to all events.
---
3. Drastically increase events rewards (plans, 2\* and 3\* legendaries weapons and armors, rare materials, caps, exp...)
---
4. Increase nukable places by drastically increasing spawning of ennemies in nuked zones
---
Maybe with these changes, your loyal player base will be willing to wait a little before they move on to another game.
---
Since beta 😂😂
---
Scrap.
---
lol wtf
---
oh yes agree'd defo lol
---
So it sounds like the change isn't THAT big of a deal. 
---
People were crying it's the death of TSE. So I presume from what you've seen, it's mostly ok?
---
Nope my tse 50 cal takes about 250 rounds to kill one level 68 mutant and I have maxes perks. Thanks Bethesda! 
---
&gt;You can probably run bloodied and do more damage than tse
---
As well the fuck you should considering you have to sit below half health for Bloodied to have that level of effect.
---
Like, really? Bloodied should absolutely be the highest damage affix, it has the biggest drawback .
---
I feel lot less overwhelmed when building/creativiting than when I play fo4 modded, for example. 
---
I think the limitations are there for several reasons, but I despite them, I’m finding the lack of options (or just enough) leading to my most creative decisions yet. 
---
Checkmate Chinese cap farmers.
---
Drills man! I’ve got so many flare guns and drills.
---
You've misdiagnosed the problem.
---
They broke the un-bulking routine: For purposes of showing you whether you have enough of the mats in inventory (somewhere, either personal or stash), it shows you as having the mats even if they're bulked. BUT IT WON'T UNBULK TO ACTUALLY CRAFT.
---
Temporary work-around: Unbulk your mats, whether in stash storage or in your personal inventory, if you need to use them for repairs or crafting.
---
I may be interpreting your comment wrong,  but are you comparing a non legendary gun to a legendary gun?  Saying the difference is unfair?  
---
Only positive I seen with the patch is making all plans available for that vendor to avoid server hopping if only they did this to mods too. Other then that every other nerf is just a negative for me since these nerfs seem to make the item useless then just making it weak.
---
I'm a bit confused. Did PC and consoles all get the patch today? I thought they were going to be staggered so they could do hot fixes. If it went to consoles I don't think they can patch it until next week because of some weird Xbox and PS4 rules. 
---
Yep, Xbox. You may be right, but it was ridiculous.
---
At least now we can easily predict future patch notes. 
---
Makeshift warrior and Gunsmith perks now make your weapons break up to 25% slower instead of 50% slower.
---
Power patcher makes power armor break 30% slower and repair costs are increased.
---
Hunger and thirst now grow twice as fast and food requires twice as much ingredients for cooking. 
---
Ammosmith now provides up to +40% ammo instead of +80%.
---
Harpers Ferry vendor is no longer free of taxes, prices are increased by 100%.
---
Ballistic weapons now shoot backwards.
---
Maintaining your character is the most fun thing ever, right? 
---
All I can say is good luck to you. You have more patience than I do. They've completely ruined the game for me.
---
The costumes are 800 ⚛️, the stash is 700 ⚛️ and the bed is 500 ⚛️. There are 4 costumes in total and for the next week you get 15 hp for wearing one
---
Zenimax strategy for online games:
---
Copy popular formula.
---
Cash in.
---
Procrastination on new content until people get bored. Turn out lights.
---
Look at TES Online: sure, content is rolling now. But the game had to outlive a bug filled launch and drought first.
---
And Legends? Copy Hearthstone. Tweak. Hope to kill interest with lack of expansions. Only after people clung to the game, did Zenimax even begin to plan future content. More less make it.
---
PC
---
Scrap it, it's what I do and it breaks it up.
---
If your still being one shot by a TSE then you have the armor resistance of a lvl 1 molerat. My level 45 and 50 TSEs cant kill shit now.
---
Anyone else reporting this? u/ladydevann
---
Damn I’m on ps4 
---
Cool! I have been checking there daily, and harpers ferrie n welch station as well. No luck as of yet, just hope I have enough! Took me awhile to get that many caps and walk across the map instead of fast travel for the past week or so
---
&gt;two seconds
---
you better be roleplaying a super optimistic but hopelessly uninformed character.
---
Need AAE
---
Dude idk who is two shotting the queen with TSEs if you don’t dupe bobbles I’ve done plenty of queens where we fail bc there’s too many lvl 30s and the normal TSEs can’t do enough damage 
---
[Hmm...](https://i.imgur.com/8KTtscB.jpg?fb)
---
Ark did that, and people loved it.
---
They saw which mods were downloaded the most, and implemented them in the game.
---
Dude now I want nachos
---
that's what we doing now? ok, "if you buy from me you won't regret it. and if you do, no refunds"
---
-Todd Howard
---
The point was that the ESO game today is quite different than from launch because the developers stuck with it....as I hope they will stick with this game. 
---
That's a glaring mistake that needs a hotfix asap. There's no reason at all for those plans to increase in price, they've always been a stock list without RNG.
---
You're not a drag, have them play with you lol
---
I also had this issue. Ended up buying 2 things of bulk ballistic finer (almost 500 caps) just to find out I had 3 in my stash that it wasn't breaking down
---
Thats... fair, actually. I deserve that, at this point. We all do. I admit it.
---
But you have this solemn pledge from me: no more. Either Bethesda up their game - starting with, at minimum, a modern engine - or I will never support them again.
---
I learned. The hard way, but I learned.
---
They're balancing the game. You're very pretentious. They are a successful video game company. They know what they are doing. Know your role and shut your hole.
---
Leave at least this is not a moneygrab bull shit game like rdr2
---
This explains why my shotgun is doing 300+ damage all of a sudden.
---
They used the Adventure font for Adventure mode very creative.
---
I want to start doing this when I get to the higher levels
---
I think you’re being extremely obtuse lol.
---
For one, your player level has zero effect on how much dmg you do or don’t do.  It’s purely about perk cards.   Please don’t be one of the fools who try to use their higher level as justification to do more dmg, when it has zero effect.  
---
And comparing a completely normal gun to a legendary with two effects, is just remarkably ridiculous.  Do you want legendary effects to be completely useless?  Please, use your brain for a bit and think about what you’re saying lol.  A child has more common sense.
---
I have no problems with today's patch. In fact if it dick bags who keep managing to one shot me when I'm not even engaging in PvP with them it sounds great to me. I don't use explosives other than grenades occasionally so I don't get what all the classic nerd rage is all about. People around here just gets so dramatic about everything for god sakes.
---
The idea that people should be fired because they made a change to a game that you don't like just cracks me up.
---
That is correct, you can see the full info from the patch notes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/)  but the part below addresses the the cost increases vs rarity of items.    
---
• (Added Jan 29) Since many Plans and Recipes can now be sourced reliably from Vendors, we've also increased their Cap costs accordingly.
---
• (Added Jan 29) Dev Note: Recipe and Plan prices were originally based on the rarity of showing up in a Vendor’s inventory. Guaranteeing their appearance significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes and we’ve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others’ equipment for a cheaper price.
---
I'll take a TSE off your hands 😍 I'm a melee girl, lots of great builds for it + combined with adrenaline. I like the Furious &amp; Anti-Armor Axes. I use the Vampire ones when I can't heal quick enough. Axes do the most damage tho. With my perks &amp; mutation, I hit about 280 per shot (before any of the other perks kick in). Might not be stealthy but it's really fun to beat shit to death. Most things die in one shot. Merlek Queen took me 4-5 swings. Was over in a minute. 
---
The state of this game/community is such deja vu for me. Saw the same thing playing Star Wars Battlefront II. Dev team shrunk after bad reviews while devoted fans put passion behind reporting bugs and dreaming up wild suggestions and wishlists that would go unfulfilled. 
---
Saw a Blue Cooler in Orwell Orchards today, that had 0/15 limit.
---
They arent going in the right direction at all. 
---
Yup. Also got stuck in load screen three times fast traveling. Twice yesterday (before the patch), and one today (after). 
---
I wanna check... I know we can on lvl 91 dewthclaws. 
---
Imagine being the one guy in FO76 reddit that thinks Energy/Explosive weapon durability isn't broken and I'm using the wrong perks. 
---
I'm not unhappy w it. I'm trying to get everybody who responds to everybody else like you are to chill and breathe. Stop being hateful to each other bc we have different ideas. I have no intention in stopping. I want this to succeed, but we all gotta get along friend. 
---
Nobody was fucked today....it's a game, you weren't physically assaulted. 
---
Is that why they almost had a class action lawsuit and were being investigated for deceptive business practice?
---
Seems like the kind of thing that could be from people working on long-term branches and not pulling in master changes regularly. 
---
Yeeeeaaaahhhh...no.
---
ok well it was quite difficult to work out exactly what your point was tbh but hey ho :)
---
I think their point is that atoms are free. They just made the point badly. I see your point though. It is physically possible for somebody to spend real money and get this outfit bonus if their friends do too.
---
Isn't it a +45 on health or something? I think you can get +200 from cooked scorched beast meat though.
---
I don't PVP, that's why this isn't a big deal for me. If it was weapon damage I'd be more annoyed.
---
Scrap them at a bench.
---
Yup.. Break down the bulked shit.
---
I was going to offer an reply, but honestly I cant rrason with this degree of stupid, so have a good night regardless. And dont save for college. Its be a waste.
---
I think at one point my base on the axe got over 300. 
---
Mr. Angry, I was just venting cause I'm pissed that all my TSE weapons do almost no damage, I cant even kill myself by shooting a wall point blank. I have no idea why your friend can kill you. You must be bugged or your friend has managed to evade the nerf. I apologize for not knowing the actual answer for you because I assumed your question was rhetorical. 
---
Look at all the things that would have been found today alone. It’s definitely needed. 
---
Once the Division started using a PTS before patches the game became infinitely better.  
---
My prediction: they will try to fix it, but will only manage to patch out all the positive effects.
---
Especially when I just watched a video where a mod was made OVERNIGHT by one person that let players organize their junk and had pip boy options that were heavy increases in usefulness that Bethesda should've released the game with but still haven't.
---
Modders are easily fixing what Bethesda isn't bothering to even look at.
---
Pop music is popular, too
---
Damn. So glad I got all the mutations I wanted while serums were 4k. This patch is crazy.
---
Head: Chance to hit: 1000%
---
In the meantime just keep making what little content we do have even more boring with excessive nerfs.
---
Probably a little bit of both, to be honest.
---
Forget defences, don't put turrets. Missile turrets use a whopping 15% of your budget, regular turrets use 10%. Someone posted  a thread yesterday about some of the sizes, The spiky boards only use about 0.16% so maybe we should throw those around idk .. you can create a decent size camp without turrets ..
---
Yeah that happened to be today at whitespring... They would drop and then instantly despawn. No loot or body...
---
I thought yes, except Queen?
---
True.  I agree, and so does my attitude about this game now.
---
I finally completed the set by getting the torso plans yesterday. Yay!
---
Been this way for years
---
That’s almost how the game already is.
---
I'd like to get shat off by someone that thinks I don't have a right to be pissy unless my daughter died.....assshat.
---
Come on, it will be nice and quick. You can trust me...
---
TS-MIRV 💀 And I have seen it done with level 30s about. Takes a bit but it is doable none the less. They arent going to unnerf it so get used to it and adjust or leave the game.
---
Yea idk why I said that lol.
---
Which is probably where this is headed
---
Don’t forget Reactive doesnt work, and HUD can cause CTD.
---
Let Zenimax take over the IP since they can do it better
---
Bungie bought themselves out of Activision. They own full rights to Destiny. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
If we accept this now it will really screw us later. Advantages of any kind shouldnt be sold in the shop. This time its a tiny buff for a week. Next time they will try something worse.
---
fists are way faster than that. and you think your peashooter can down big game like scorchbeasts in one hit? or solo the queen in under 5 minutes?
---
Ill day demo expert could have stayed and the other perk nerfs but tse was to strong 
---
Outer Worlds is coming 
---
You mean the song La Macarena? I hear it's all the rage back in Ibiza.
---
Never asked for a firing. Try reading.
---
Anyone that buys the fisherman’s hat is fucking stupid. I stumble across a few of those every time I play. The Atomic Shop is seriously a joke. 
---
Someone is absolutely going to accuse you of confusing stealth nerfs and nerfs to stealth because that happened in the past and you're talking about both here, but something is definitely broken with stealth detection. At least I hope it's broken, because if this is working as intended it's not going to be a viable build component going forward.
---
If you only want junk in your stash that's your choice. Other people like having other shit. I have 30 stimpacks and 50 diluted, plus 39 supers. and that isn't even half of my aid in my stash. I have enough to repair my armor about 3 times, but I shouldn't need to repair all of my armor after one encounter with one monster. 
---
How's this for a quick easy content boost?
---
AWOL Armaments - Hard but doable.
---
SUPER AWOL Armaments - Spawns 1 out of 4 times AWOL can come up.  Quadruple the health on the bots with double damage.  Make it 6 waves instead of 3.  Give much better rewards for completing it (better chance at rare plans and 3 star weapons / armor).
---
Poof, instant content.  Specifically aimed at higher level players that are bored with the difficultly level.
---
It's not all rocket science and hundreds of coding hours.  If that took a single dev more than 1 week to implement.........then their engine is truly trash and they need to move over to Unreal.
---
It seems this is the sort of thing we can expect from Bethesda going forward. Honestly, I'm starting to believe the people saying this is a Vault Tech experiment to see how much bullshit gamers will accept before they give up on a game.
---
It's a meme. I don't think people legitimately believe that.
---
Will you be on tonight?  If so I’ll be sure to message you 
---
So I got a TSE gatling laser a while ago and was slowly building my character around it.
---
After this I've decided I'm going to give the game up for a long while so I don't run into this trap again, I don't have hours every day to dedicate towards grinding out perks and levels so that I can respec, my character is now between 2 shit builds and I lack the motivation to change it again to chase whatever the new meta is.
---
Yeah, I did that. It's all loose items, not bulked. 
---
6 months ago .. unlikely .. 
---
What platform do you play on cause I need people to play with
---
I know it's not a permanent thing. But it's setting a precedent. Pay Atoms, get better stats. They do it once, they will do it again. And what if it was 5% VATS accuracy for every Nuka-cola or Vault-Tec skin on the team?
---
I've worked for a game company...it really is possible to lose track of what the players are experiencing while you fiddle with code.
---
Moms stand up, too! Or is this a dad joke-joke?
---
*sneaks off to the kitchen mumbling about the grocery list*
---
You failed. Congratulations.
---
Big cry little guy
---
Remove the mods
---
Cause we all know that's the change that was needed right? Those pins were just begging for changing.
---
bulk plastic always bugged out for me. couldn't sell or use it. just sat in inventory. not worth the risk. 
---
I don't use it either but I really don't repair that often, even without White Knight. 
---
You should have been able to relocate the desired special perks to use the specific cards you want as your playstyle. And get the cards you want from leveling up.
---
Weird, man... Was 3.4GB on XB1. Was done in a few mins. 
---
The world has ended... Just build shelter and be happy. Stop trying to have some crazy fancy place in the barren shithole.
---
I understand the urge. Use it for good my bro
---
No, not at all. I havent logged in today. Let me rephrase.
---
Given that OP mentioned plans are now level-locked, I'm wondering why Bethesda did that. Because it was already the case that, before the patch, if a level 5 character read a plan that had a minimum level for the gun of 20, you already couldnt craft it. So I was wondering why they also added level limits to the plan (either to read or purchase, I'm not sure).
---
While you are “looking into it” make so that Bulking reduces the weight of EVERYTHING as the idea of bulking should do this. 
---
Smh
---
I look at it as a daily "job" of you will, but whatever, I don't really care. I'm a fairly casual player and don't have a problem keeping caps I guess.
---
With the brick interior walls you can build the wall as a doorway and it allows you to place another on the other side so both walls are drywall. Afterward you can switch the wall from doorway to solid  wall. That's how I've been doing it on XB1
---
No. Scorched anything is supposed to be immune to the pacify effect. 
---
Furious explosive auto handmade kicks ass. Been wrecking with it :)
---
Omg..  ytmnd..  do you remember batman uleleleuele?
---
I've done that already. It was showing that I had no oil, I debulked it, now it shows that I have oil but I still can't build. 
---
They haven't rushed anything, they've taken months to 'fix/unfix' things. I know they're working, just don't seem competent enough.
---
I can't even server hop for ballistic fiber. It seems to only spawn once per day for me.
---
Honestly they shouldve just went into everyones in game inventory and deleted anything they had more than 20 of in terms of apparel, weapons (20 tse shotguns) plans (“20” x01 calibrated shocks) excluding ammo and junk.  then lower the prices of all plans to affordable amounts, duped items would essentially be wiped off the server to a massive extent and dupers wouldnt go through the trouble of making 80+ accounts to hold onto their weaponry and apparel.  
---
 Just as an FYI the cost of items has increased due since rarity factor of items being removed. You can see the full info from the patch notes [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/) but the part below addresses the the cost increases vs rarity of items.
---
FICKLE!  FICKLE!  FICKLE!

aside from the less than helpful "we'll pass it along to the dev team" with no real help? or "we can't wait to show you what we're working on" with no actual communication?
---
they're just mods in suits regurgitating pre-approved one-liners. not to mention they focus on the wrong issues and/or their notes are mostly ignored.
---
I’m with you 
---
It is a chinese knockoff.
---
You’re right, it is tedious. Let me explain since I’m being downvoted so much...
---
Imagine a world where there is no cap and vendors just throw caps at you.
---
I can clear whitespring for multiple legendaries and jump servers. Might as well do multiple nuke zones. Then I’ll take my hundreds of legendaries, that surprisingly won’t take nearly as long as one would think and sell them all. Wash / repeat. In a matter of a day or two of serious grinding I would have thousands upon thousands of caps. 
---
That’s absurd. Cap limits and weapon damage people can’t get enough of. Yet if Bethesda listens to half of what people are saying it would be a boring game you could 100% complete in a matter of a week. 
---
You aren’t supposed to be able to purchase everything your heat desires just because you grinded a nuke zone or whitespring for a day. You should have to work for things you want. 
---
You following me around Reddit?

---
 &gt; Just as an FYI the cost of items has increased due since rarity factor of items being removed. You can see the full info from the patch notes [here](...
---
Great idea. Maybe charge $60 for the privilege, too.
---
I can’t build base items with bulk materials. And my already built wafer purifiers won’t work and say they need rubber? 
---
And why's that good?
---
The issues with patch is just the stick that broke the camels back, there is not enough to do and many of the events offer little rewards or in some cases like gathering the nuclear numbers is just pure frustration and math check on how many caps you have as it forces you to fast travel 18 times and pay caps every time and forces even longer loading screens.
---
In short there is no fun content and the only thing people were having fun with was explosive weapons which were double nerfed, I would honestly be surprised if the game recovers from this.
---
Yeah, that claim was laughable 3 months ago. Now, I'd rather electrocute myself on a stationary bike than roll the dice with another patch... Okay well maybe not, but still.
---
I would love to see some fixes to other legendary modifiers to make some viable and others less O.P.  Right now sentinels/assassins is absurdly unfair. Even before the TSE nerf, people were taking zero damage from weapons that do 2k dmg. Now that my TSE pipe bolt action went from 1500dmg to 400, how is PvP possible? Everyone's running around shooting spitwads at tanks.
---
At the current state I dont see why some of the modifiers cant in different slots.  For example an Anti Armor, two shot wouldn't be overpowered. The assassins affix should be similar to the scorched. More damage to players and less to everything else. Why even use the assassins +10% when a TS still does 25%?
---
Another thing I've been annoyed with is 7/10 three star enemies drop one star items or nothing at all. Even if I beat them with a spear for 3 minutes to register. If a 3 star can drop a 1 star why can't the opposite happen on rare occasion. Or... we could just get appropriate drops...
---
Last thing on my mind atm is scorched beasts health and rapid fire. I cant even get a shot off on some of them because I'm bombarded with sonic blasts and can't even see where the dickhead is. With the damage nerfs I couldn't kill a lvl 80 scorched beast. It just destroyed my entire base and all my armor. Now I need to farm ballistic fiber for hours so that I can play again.
---
My entire level 100 build just turned to shit. Melee is the only good build now!
---
You don't get plastic back
---
OH! That’s why I was jumping higher. What the hell, that’s a weird bug. 
---
And btw, my gf sells out for 1400 a day by  picking black Berries, in about an hours time with out server hoping at all. Is that not intended either?
---
Something is def weird with the carry weight.  Every time I log in, it jumps around, 123, 405, 250, even when it's above my limit, I can still sprint/fast travel.
---
No you just came here to tell me that I need to calm down because i'm not going to let someone with no input try to tell me i'm wrong without explaining why he thinks that. 
---
Also never claimed it was an attack, it's just a post from some narcissist that looks at someone posting and feels the need to "settle them down". Sorry to burst your back-seat admining bubble.
---
Thanks 
---
Point is proven by the lack of any meaning dialogue. Just downvotes and personal attacks.  I remember a post wayyyy back on this sub talking about how r/fallout was a collective of hating whiners. I fear this sub is becoming the same. 
---
why do you spend so much time in whitesprings now?
---
Makes no sense , I'm literally talking about this thread only.
---
if you moan like a bitch in other posts then point proven bruh
---
No problem
---
Salty nerds revolt that the exploited weapons they paid cash for aren't worth it anymore. Boo hoo. 
---
Hey Bethesda! As a huge fan of the fallout franchise I have a few suggestions for power armor paints! Remember the PA faction paints in fallout 4? When will we get faction based power armor paints in 76? (Enclave X01, Responder T 45, and also BOS T-51 and T-45 (like in Fallout 3 and New Vegas) Freestates, and my personal favorite idea: Raider versions of all power armor! For example make the metal of the armors Rusty, scratched and covered with weld marks. Also maybe wrap parts in barbed wire and other junk. Thanks!!! 
---
TLDR: Please add cool faction based power armor paints
---
Not just that, it saves on PR nightmares and player frustration by doing so.
---
Much later on, it'll give modders a leg up with keeping up with changes as well so they can launch new/updated mods as close to patch launches rather than days or weeks after.
---
Noob question. That’s TSE?
---
Let's be real here:
---
That's not true at all.
---
Ladydev just wiping her ass with your suggestions and issues. :p
---
Let me bring you up to speed champ. This patch only negatively affects game play. It just means more grinding. A TSE will just two shot what it used to one shot. Grind some ammo mats. White knight is less effective, grind some armor mats. All of which is a joke. Nothing in this game is hard to kill, with whatever weapon you want. 
---
Since they did not release any new fun mechanics, or events, or perks, or whatever, all this patch means is the game is less fun. 
---
half the stuff in this game is broken
---
Quad explosive double still
---
The only thing I think that's good is; lately caps have become almost worthless. If you look at the marketplace, everyone is trading object for object and many times they write NO CAPS. Hopefully this will recharge the economy so that the money economy will actually be used again. If this happens, I for 1 will be very happy with this, I'm sitting on like 60k (earned properly) over a few characters, that I can't really use
---
Bullshit
---
March man.  Basically 4-5 months from launch.
---
Man I wish I could be a fly on the wall during these planning meetings.
---
They mentioned they level locked it so it wouldn't hurt the economy, ie no level craft and sale bots versus a actual player having to level up to be able to craft an item. Dont get me wrong, it doesnt make sense to me either.
---
Does that stack with the sweet roll? 
---
Or you could get Bethesda hint, power armour and fisting things, its the way forward...
---
Nope
---
now THIS i understand. I have the same task. I have unlocked all mods for lever action rifle! It took most of my resources. I have unlocked ~75% of radium rifle mods. It has taken a lot of my resources.  
---
What i learned while I did this was to save ~20-30 of each junk item so I could continue to repair when needed.  I also ran into the problem of no junk to repair when I was making/scrapping lever action rifle.  
---
Now I use less materials but the cost was an issue for some time.  Thank you for the perspective.
---
There was no reason to nerf White Knight.
---
Nobody was complaining about it.
---
It's like they have someone at the office who is a secret sadist who likes to stick knives in people's back for funsies.
---
Whoever that person is, I'd like someone to take a dump in their coffee and explain how the turd benefits them after.  Pre-turd, coffee tasted good.  Post-turd coffee tasted bad.  Why is everyone complaining?
---
Because Bethesda hates us
---
I have one that dropped.
---
Yeah I was exploiting with my elite missile launcher that heals enemies.
---
And only respond to positive posts... someone post something overwhelmingly positive and a lie, watch.
---
Take the bulked item out of your stash and scrap it at a work bench.
---
I have to imagine it's something to do with the new combining of the stash and carry weights into one limited total, but I have no idea why it seems to be fluctuating as a result.
---
Good to know. 
---
True just tried mine. Not bad considering....
---
Care to elaborate?
---
My point was to express to Bethesda that I am enjoying the game and that I wish they would increase the cap limits at the vendors....it's in my letter to Beth. 
---
Why do you hoard stuff you don't use?
---
Less than half of my stash is junk. The rest is gear.
---
Zero aid in there, lots of weightless notes. 
---
Ah crap, forgot to put that disclaimer in there. I already unbulked everything before this. The bulk issue is not what caused this. Not having the materials in the actual stash.
---
The going talk is that you need to scrap bulk materials  to break them back down and then it works. I haven't tried it myself yet. Hopefully we will get a hot fix.
---
I can solo the silos without a TSE. I think they scale with the number of people in them.
---
Only annoying thing would be the bugged assaultrons. That was a challenge. 
---
So good
---
Also the game has only been out for 1800 hours..... do something else mate.
---
that sounds like something an npc would say.
---
but how can this be, considering Bethesda couldn't be bothered to add any to Fo76?
---
Side note,gauss rifle plans went from 1200 caps to 4000 caps...holy fucking NOPE , I’m out. 
---
Hope it liked you
---
Just have to scrap it yourself now. Each one individually. Annoying yes
---
I’d love for you to explain that. 
---
He's not saying he wants everything for free. He's sarcastically pointing out that constantly nerfing things makes the game less enjoyable.
---
In any case, why would I argue against a point that you just kind of drudged up from the depths of your adrenaline addled brain? Give your pituitary gland a break and try to understand sentences as they are written rather than whatever you want them to say. It's not hard for most people.
---
I'm not sure why you think you're the smart one here either. You're clearly too dumb to read 5 sentences and understand their contents.
---
I can't say I do. All I could find about it just now was a slightly disturbing video...
---
Have you looked at the state of this sub? The majority of people here are disgusted by Bethesda actions. You keep sucking that dick champ!
---
I'm trying.  But even my motivation to play dies a little with all these dumb huge "bug fix" patches.
---
I can deal with bugs.
---
It sucks my motivation that people I like to play with are leaving.
---
Would be nice to beable to load a play list into one of your own, could make CAMP a bit more homely ?
---
Judging from the reactions to this new patch, I guess I’ll continue waiting on the sidelines hoping for legitimate improvements.
---
they've totally burned up all my goodwill with this patch being the hot mess it is.
---
i have loved every inch of this game since launch. i have sold friends on this game. i have approached every patch with patience. surely, i thought, the team that pulled out what is essentially a miracle--an exceptionally playable multiplayer game using a clumsy frankenstein's monster of an engine that's older than jesus--could get the game on track in a reasonable timeframe. they will polish up this diamond. they will knock out bugfixes, address balance issues quickly, and finish up the half-done content that had to be cut for launch. they'd already accomplished one impossible task and i was so sure that they had action plans ready to go to get the game on course. 
---
i justified every lightweight patch coming down the tubes as *growing pains*. this is what every new multiplayer game goes through. the next patch will surely be meatier. the next patch will fix energy weapons; it will unfuck the objectively imbalanced durability system; it will add the fundamental features a game released in 2018 should have at launch; it will address the absence of content.
---
it's been nearly three months and i'm over it. there have been no wisps of new content. the only attempts to tackle balance issues have been half-hearted and slow-coming. there's been nothing but nerfs, nothing but content removal, excising points of engagement that players were using to keep themselves interested in a barren endgame.
---
it's clear at this point that bethesda has reduced the team working on 76 to a skeleton crew, because if they *haven't*--if what they've delivered has been with a fully staffed, fully functional team--then they should be embarrassed with what they've accomplished here. 
---
i've heard that the vaults are coming in march, but i'm not going to wait that long, because taking four months to deliver content *that was already half-finished in november* is inexcusable. i'm peacing out for awhile. maybe there will finally be some shit to do come 2020.
---
&gt;skyrim where melee is king
---
Melee is king in Skyrim? Laughs in stealth archer.
---
You know, people who can’t manage emotional regulation... they just have shittier lives. 
---
They contribute to more toxicity at work. Poorer career prospects. Less safety at home. Less fulfillment. Less stable relationships. The list goes on. 
---
You want to argue for your tight to fly off the handle over bullshit and call me names? Go ahead and fly off the handle over bullshit and call me names. 
---
Threatening me by proverbially stabbing your self in the face and worsening **your own** life this way doesn’t... threaten me. 
---
If I was less kind I’d offer to buy you a proverbial knife. 
---
I’m not, so I’ll offer there’s a better way, to emotionally respond and to treat people and leave it there. Do whatever you want with that, 
---
Awesome I have one of those, I was wondering about the anti armor effect tho
---
Found a couple bugs...
---
1. The Scorch Beast Queen flew half way across the bottom of the map and was stuck underground. Me and about 10 other people couldn't finish the Scorched Earth quest.
---
2. I'm still get the audio noise for caps stashes even if the are empty and I've been to them in the same session.(Fortune Finder Perk Card)
---
Did you send a bug report?
---
WTF are you talking about?
---
The OP was looking to buy something that he could buy in game. I informed him of that in a sarcastic manner and the ass hat above you got shitty with me about violating TOS.
---
Of course if you go back and re read the thread Mr. Ass hat eventually found out that in game vendors do indeed sell these to everyone......but if course he never apologized or took away his down vote.
---
Just go ahead and Brexit this conversation bruh.....we don't need you anymore.
---
They won't. Bethesda is no longer a game company, but an entertainment company, playing by slicked back teflon finish corporate practices. 
---
I'm pretty sure the people who wrote the in game tool tips aren't mathematicians, I wasn't implying more meant additive.  I was saying it didn't mean subtractive in the context it was used.  Its just English, you could argue all day that a near miss is a hit, but people will still use near miss to describe an accident that almost happened.
---
 your lazer weapon might not do any damage but it does break too quick. 
---
Feeling kind of good now about nobody wanting to buy my gauss plan previously
---
Does it work when your not in PA?
---
Yawn
---
Update your mods. This one is specifically Perk Loadout Manager, but Better Inventory has been updated, too. Remove Save My Stuff until the mod author updates it, it breaks vendors. 
---
:( 
---
Slightly interested in this video
---
People want more content? Nerf armor perks so they can farm ballistic fiber twice as often.
---
People want more content? Nerf explosive builds so they have to grind another 5 or 10 perks to replace the nerfed ones.
---
People want more content? Make plans 100% available at all vendors and they can farm caps for weeks.
---
I hate to say it, but the more people complain about content, the more stuff like this we are going to get.
---
😂😂
---
These were stealth stealth nerfs and stealth not stealth nerfs. Stealth nerfs all around.
---
I usually sell Marine Tactical Helmets since I have the plan for it.  3 Rubber/1 Plastic/1Glass = 22-30 Caps depending on CHA/Perks + Grape Mentats.  If not that, kill mutants -&gt; sell Assault Rifles (Harper's Ferry Mutants carry enough rifles to clean out its vendor), or bulk junk, silver scrap, nuke waste etc.  Raw Flux after a Nuke Drop is pure caps as well.
---
Let's not invent numbers. It's only a 20% reduction (160%/200% = 0.8).
---
"My stash is full make it bigger"
---
"I don't have enough junk to repair my gear anymore"
---
What do you mean bug?
---
I dont think anyone didnt want tse nerfed, but they took it too far. My tse handmade is so bad its unusable now.
---
No, sorry.  The game is a survival game.  In which items will break.  Their argument is sound: the perks were so good everyone felt like they HAD to be n the build.  That isn't what they want.  They want the decisions to be hard ones, and now they are harder.
---
Sorry, disagree.
---
if any of you quitting want to pass your ps4 copy on to someone.. shoot me a pm :) 
---
I believe bethesda will never release new pve content. The Bobby pins weight was fixed and now it's back to  .1 so how many times are they gonna have to rework certain things until we get new content. I'm 150 and bored. Cant craft x01 mods and still cant get my calibrated shocks to spawn after 200 hours of server hopping. I can buy any plan but x01. Lame. I cant build hats when I learned the plans. Still. Why didnt they wait an extra 2 months for release. Dont get me wrong I love this game, the idea, but the execution from beta just seemed abysmal. I get it, games have bugs. Free dlc is cool, but it is 2019 and dev's should have a pretty solid grasp on what to expect and or bugs. How many call of dutys came bugged out at launch, all of em. Can a dev team not learn from everyone else's problems. I know it's still tech a new game. But how could they not of learned the basics after 3 and 4. 
---
No problem at all man
---
This is what I figure a lot these are. Oh well... 
---
Go to Whitesprings, fire some shots into the windows, run like hell to a ledge you can stand on so the enemies can't get you, server hop, repeat. I was playing the 'normal' way and it took me two months to get to level 27.  
---
After one week of farming mobs at Whitesprings, I am now level 40
---
You're going to need some tongs, a flashlight, and a flexi-cam.
---
I agree. And most posts agree with you as well
---
LOL.
---
That didn't go as planned.
---
Some of us have been here a while.
---
Or  get some new friends?
---
Or stop playing
---
Or..
---
Loading the game is ***WAAAAAAAAAAAAY*** better and I haven't had any more crashes or server disconnects.
---
I think this is because they've stopped a lot of the cheaters that had dupped a shitload of items.
---
Well the patch did say “most” or “almost all” so maybe they excluded dense mods :(((((
---
i mean, lol at them before the nerf too.
---
Join up and I'll craft you one
---
This sounds deep
---
Yeah its all balances for pvp, they’ve lost touch with their origins
---
Well still not entire community 🤗
---
Couldn't have said it better myself ❤️
---
forever alone
---
Man thanks, that's the first laugh I have gotten today. It's been a long shitty day of gaming with the nerfs. 
---
Then you can feel lucky with me
---
I *really* hope so as well. Much of what made stealth builds viable was the, you know, stealth. My damage mitigation is laughable.
---
If I were into PvP, I'd spec and gear accordingly and accept the change for that mode only (2.5x multiplier permanently -- even in line of sight -- while crouching seems pretty broken, if that's what they're claiming used to happen).
---
Its that game where you play with Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and swing a giant key to kill bad fluffy monkeys. It's super popular for some reason but I never understood the appeal, like I'm not 6 any more Disney is gay as fuck.
---
Fo76 isn't a mmorpg though.
---
They work fine for me. My first stash had like 30 caps and then i searched i for 95 more. Me teammate and i were even able to both loot and search them for extra caps; instanced caps stashes area a +.
---
It wouldn't be so bad if there was a vendor reset time everyday. I have to keep track over what time during my previous playtime I sold to vendors - and sometimes even the order I sold to them - to make sure I get my 1400 caps and clear my STASH every night. It's absurd.
---
12 years??? Wow, these are some old accounts
---
My build is also stealth critical, but I haven't noticed any nerfs, still takes 5 seconds to down a SB and my crits build like crazy.
---
The cheap ones suck... Bethesda knows
---
Bro 
---
Take the L 
---
You write utter garbage , you make no sense and come across like an utter prick.
---
Take yourself and your "bruh" patter to fuck.
---
Cya , cya mate
---
My issue is that it’s a clear line. Once you cross it it becomes subjective about what is too much effect on gameplay rather then only cosmetic bonuses. These things have a tendency to drift to more elaborate justifications about why it’s not big deal while a certain gun skin gives you a 5% bonus to damage etc. 
---
My game won't load into a server after today's patch.
---
10/10 would patch again.
---
Here come all the accounts that are just about as old as the release of this game concern trolling the shit out of the sub! Yay, just another part of patch day!
---
Don’t come back?
---
Precisely the idea. 
---
It's not a multi player rpg? Shit where has my head been
---
I know right?  And I will.  I have been looking at your post history - and I wouldn't be calling you out like this - so I really do apologize - I really am legit deep into a bottle of wine - but things seem pretty rough for your overall.  I'm so so so sorry if I'm being rude right now but are you ok?  It seems like you judge your fun in this game based on how effective you are compared to other players - you don't need to do that!  I hope you know that!  Again I'm sorry - I feel like a d-bag - but I want you to be happy!  OK! Excercise!  What would make you happy!  I have some training in psychology i might be able to help! 
---
Its probably my favorite video game world that ive ever explored.
---
Ooh nice appreciate it, too bad there’s no jet pack or shocks :)
---
Enclave military vendor I think
---
At this point, I'd rather them just focus on something else.
---
Exactly this!
---
Great post man, really enjoyed reading that. (Not sarcasm if it sounded like it lol)
---
I would not ever hand over a valued piece of equipment for another player to mod, UNLESS its a trusted and known friend.
---
And if we're doing that, we do it for free.
---
The hike in price just makes it look like a stretched grind now.
---
In order for that to work - theyd need to make a 'mod trade' screen similar to how enchanting other peoples stuff works in WoW.
---
Trade screen shows up. You request 'hey can you make my gun silent?' The crafter never gets the weapon in his inventory but he can choose to attach a silencer on it. Even charge a price to it.
---
Good job fake gamer girl. 
---
[deleted]
---
Its a trap!
---
"Melee is the only viable build now" is my favorite.
---
Viable is quite different than op. 
---
Especially when my vats build is still melting face....from far away, taking no damage and using 2-3 bullets before 1 shots kick due to my build.
---
TSE Handmade with 9 Rifleman, 3 Tank Killer, and 5 Demo Expert.   Went from 498(without chem buffs) to 120.
---
Is it possible that they have people working for them that are actively ***trying*** to bring down the company?
---
MMORPG doesn't stand for multi player rpg. 
---
Heh, those are the common ones that spawned regularly at the vendors. Anyone that wanted those could have the bought easily by now. 
---
&gt;for some reason, every time I bulk steel, I save a half pound. 
---
Yeah, because you used half a pound of plastic. Just drop half a pound of plastic on the ground. Same result.
---
you forgot massive, which 76 isn't. and rpg? eh.
---
Can't remember the last time a triple A MMO went live with a patch that fucked it this hard.
---
Amen brother.
---
Dude. The recycled outfits are starting to get on my nerves. And the CLEAN versions of things??? Gimme a break.
---
Ok but, FO 76 isn’t a MMO 
---
Thanks pa!
---
Couldnt if i tried, thanks to the stability of the servers.
---
Still need to find the random responder vendor bought 
---
Well said.
---
That sounds hilarious, d'you remember where it was?
---
Well nerf criers. You did it. Welcome to the age of fallout destiny. Be ready for the same repetitive grinding for hours for shit rewards since they nerfed any good ones. Be ready for balance balance balance. Soon each fight will be 15 minutes with a pea shooter so they can extend that play time. Look at all those nerfs they only serve the purpose of artificially extending playtime since the first content drop will be a fucking pvp server. 
---
Everyone knows IRL cash should be on BE... lulz, TSE cucks!
---
It's a game, just a game and a difficult one at that if played as intended. They are making it harder and I have no beef with it. Gotta keep it fun.  
---
Me too. On Xbox. Level 20 taking no damage with shotgun. 
---
Yeah but Iike having 10 bulk of most items (excluding rubbish like bone shards) so that means 300 steel, etc
---
There is a massive amount of players playing it no?
---
The TSE (and other things) *absolutely* needed a Nerf - but, they probably should have only done about 1/3 of the Nerf they did to TS, and, focused on just Nerfing MAX damage that you could get with Demolition Perk combined with TSE.
---
As it is Rifle *base* damaged needed (needs) a ***BUFF*** not a nerf.
---
I had to shoot a **RAT** more than FIVE FUCKING TIMES to kill it, I had to quit playing because my anger was giving me stress - they've come clsoe to turning the game to unplayable shit.
---
I'm ***FUCKING LEVEL 100 something*** do not make me shoot RATS a half dozen fucking times, JESUS WTAF?!?
---
I'm not just level 100, I am using a max level, multi-star Legendary rifle with MAX (all 3) Rifleman Perks, Bloody Mess, Tenderizer, Tank Killer, etc. etc. etc.  I had EVEN POPPED A FUCKING BUFFTAT and I have to - I'm STILL fucking pissed and I quit a while ago.
---
WTF Bethesda?!?
---
Clean CAMP items would be nice, turrets that don't wobble/endlessly swivel, and of course cosmetic (or functional) companions! For the characters themselves, more serious military gear skins would be cool that isn't just for power armor.
---
Too cheap for a ptr. They'll pay for it in loss instead. 
---
Meh, I haven't repaired a piece of armor in two weeks.  Even with the change (and getting train'd by about 6 GG'S), my armor still hasn't got down to the point where I CAN repair it.  But then again I don't just stand there swinging a super sledge while everything hits me like I see so many people do.  So that's just me
---
The screenshots should at least still be on your console.
---
this is the deal.  
---
unarmed builds?  not viable.  
---
no power armour?  not viable.  
---
mad junk grind for players to sustain making it to level 50?   not viable
---
*is currently downloading ark*
---
Frankly dude it's hard to even decipher what you're trying to say through the rage.
---
One guy said a thing about arbitrary limits and lack of content and you dive into "OMG you got too babied having a Dev console, go play a different game"
---
Then continued to go off on an aggressive tangent when it was pointed out that what you said had no correlation to the original topic.
---
What?
---
They did, to an extent. Prime/Ultracite and alternate ammo receivers. 
---
Requires weapon modding (or multiple specimens of the same weapon) though. I do wish they’d to the full Monty and just let us field-swap ammo. 
---
Its a secret all i can say is its close to r&amp;g station its a random event 
---
Oh ya me to. Was like wtf maxes out perk and 1 cap.
---
Dump those “useless” weapons.  I had a sweet 50 cal explosive that had 150 damage prior too today.  It was 70 damage today.  Dropped it like a bad habit.  Thanks Bethesda 
---
Indeed.  Thanks for nothing, Bethesda.  Been playing this game daily since launch.  It has it's flaws, but I enjoyed it.  I built my character up slowly, farmed for the best weapons, then began base building, collecting power armors and finding stuff to do to occupy myself.  After this patch, my level 162 character feels like a level 32.  I'm back to long, drawn out fights with low level enemies and farming for ammo and scrap to repair weapons constantly.  There are plenty of other games I could play if I wanted to farm forever.  Take your nerfs to the PvP server and return PvE back to what it was.  You aren't gaining new players with these changes, just driving away those that have been supporting you and playing daily.  
---
Dude drop some Bobby pins, I get the stash thing but why do you have 300+ Bobby pins? I get complaints about this game about half the time, the weight of Bobby pins fucking people up has been an odd one since the beginning.
---
iirc if someone attempts to claim your workshop, you are automatically engaged in pvp with them, even if they leave and fail to claim it. so they can technically travel to you and kill you
---
Ya I'm seeing a strong trend here lol. This is making me sad. I love this game, franchise, and developer but if this is what I have to expect I may just need to find a new game. Like fallout nv lmfao.
---
Did the devs patch the wrong version? 
---
Isnt that the fucking point of level progression. to get better gear and gravitate to the better gear. A rocket launcher is generally supposed to be overpowered. You want to test that shoot yourself with a .38 in the foot. then shoot yourself with a rocket launcher. the rocket launcher generally does more damage. 
---
Consider yourself lucky. I changed servers and it's still missing.
---
Yes because we as the consumer have no right to have a completed product, or offer feedback in such a manner that hopefully gets seen by someone therefor getting the slight chance of improving the game that we care about.
---
It's the Save My Stuff mod. Remove it until it's updated. 
---
Thank you bro. Thank you for saying this. Because OP just complained about surviving in a survival game and it made me want to scream lol. Especially when he tries to throw melee under the buss like it’s OP. Remember people it’s MELEE! Meaning you have to be very close to hit people. Anyone with a rifle and decent strategy can put up a good fight with a melee character. Just stop complaining, Everyone, please. 
---
Why not both?
---
Shit happens, wow was way more trash for a lot longer than this 
---
The busted radiation resist system already made this much clear.
---
I was really looking forward to this update.
---
More things I’m finding out, so many things had their weight readjusted from glowing mass to ammo to Bobby pins my stash is magically up 40 lbs from when I was on yesterday but my inventory hasn’t changed. I’m just so sick of them releasing patch notes and not including ALL OF THE PATCH NOTES
---
Once you initiate a capture on an owned workshop you and the owner + their party are flagged for PVP against each other anywhere on the map.  You must initiate the capture first to take off the slap damage restrictions.  If you really want to capture a workshop over farm players for junk and caps it is better to server hop for an unclaimed one.  You will have to break their will to fight and chase them off the server otherwise, which can be quite fun and lucrative caps wise if they are stubborn.  
---
Except most of the plans I’ve seen tonight are nerfed to ridiculous levels.  
---
Explosive is it’s own damage category. Energy resist means nothing. Fireproof perk and dense chest mod will nullify 95%(estimated) tse damage. It will break limbs still, I recommend adamantium skeleton to combat this, or just slam a stim after every shot. 
---
It's the mod Save My Stuff. Remove it until it's updated. 
---
Never said it was. But this is the first one linked to an atomic shop item
---
"Because you can buy them, we increased the price"
---
What is the logic behind that?  Please explain.
---
Got caught duping and need to know whom to submit that essay to?
---
I wanna know what the legendaries are!
---
On PS4 the screenshots are not part of the saved data. But I dont know about Xbox.
---
A bolt action gets over 100
---
Enclave... how do you not know this?
---
Well said.  It's a video game.  Relax.
---
I have played this game with so many people that don't know how to use cover.  It's sick.  They just run right in against a HORDE OF SNALLYGASTERS!  I mean - seriously - what are you doing!  Use the enviorment bro!  Engage at a longer distance and take some damn cover!  Run away!  I only have to repair my armor like once every week and a half and I play a good four hours a day.  What are you people doing that you are running out of ballistic fiber!?  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND!
---
per server? no.
---
can hardly meet the cap nowadays, too.
---
Fallout "Vendorbot Simulator" 76
---
GAME DOESNT WORK AUTO CRASH TO DESKTOP WHEN PRESSING PLAY
---
Two Shot Explosive mod on weapons.
---
Titanfall 2 had monthly updates until support for the game ended so they could focus on the next game.
---
Lol at us that bought this game for the full price
---
I agree with the general idea behind this, except that we can see BGS isn't playing the smart cards. Certainly MOST developers know much better than we do.
---
Bethesda&gt;I’m done
---
agree with most negative points here...
---
I have been a fan of the franchise since fallout 1, 2, tactics (tho I skipped 3,) new Vegas and fallout 4...
---
I am actually sad I spent $110aud on the game, it was fun until lvl 50, now my mate asks me to play ( lvl20) and while I prefer travelling with a friend, what can we do? if I shoot anything his lvl I 1 shot it, so I just run around like an idiot while he tries to kill them... shared xp Beth REGARDLESS who shoots it..... we can travel and do stuff 
---
any solid game suggestions guys?
---
Yup, i dont have that problem personally(wasted perks, some of my weapons did take the hit though), but i am frustrated for you. Was not the appropriate fix.
---
Nothing i had did insane amounts of damage, and they werent even my most used weapons. But now i feel like those weapons are completely pointless.
---
It has been there from start
---
They do drop like candy and i dont store anything i dont use. I restock every few days. Sometimes i jusy want to go around walking and killing shit. Since im melee i get his often and heal often. Then i come across a red rocket and restock. I have 20 to 30 stimpacks on me at a time. Sometimes i dont pay attention and run out so i travel to my base and grab some more. I dont have really any gear in my stash. I use fist weapons and have the armor i use. Dont need anymore gear unless i find something to replace what im using then i sell what i had. 
---
Yeah and what did you pay for it?  10,000 caps?  It’s fucked.  Jet pack is probably 30K caps.  
---
Did they? Then I have to wonder how they managed to reintroduce so many already-fixed bugs. That shouldn't have happened if they were just injecting the newly altered values they were currently working on.
---
yep.  excavator for queens. hazmat for whitesprings. 
---
Don’t worry too much about them. They eventually make all the good ones useless anyway.
---
F
---
Eh, it’s just indicative of other issues. I could drop a couple hundred bobby pins find room for 10 lbs rather than thirty, but I’d end up of something else that I’d probably end up needing soon, and just be frustrated that an inability to properly update code caused this mess. 
---
The number of times I’ve recently needed something I’ve gotten rid of to clear up stash space has gotten increasingly frustrating, and to have to do it again because of inexcusable coding practices (and not just rolling back the patch that screwed this all up) has me past a tipping point.
---
Besides, I’ve kind of run out of things to do except grind. Better things to do with my time until there’s some new content.
---
Poseidon Morgantown and Sandy Grove, only noticed 2-3 stashes are missing completely. I think the lowest # i saw before a search was 12
---
This patch didn’t wreck the game for people who prefer guns over melee. 
---
TSE was never the strongest way to do guns anyway. It just got popular because word of mouth, streamers, and because spray and pray sells. 
---
Many people already run a full gun build (single stack STR-or-PER or dual stack) that doesn’t use or need TSE and does heaps more damage than either TSE or melee. 
---
Come to the rad side. We’ve got cookies. 
---
The main grievance is the time put into our builds is literally for nothing now, and it will take even longer to level up now just to correct our builds with point and skill allocation. If you weren't built for TSE and dont use a TSE then you have no idea just how nerfed we are now. I have problems killing mobs 30 levels below me now, and my friend and I tried to take down a scorchbeast but had to abandon it after 10 minutes due to our weapons breaking and only knocking it down a quarter of its health (it was lvl 50 and we were level 65 and 91)
---
How is this getting downvotes? This is estrogenius.
---
Any word on the enormous price increase was intentional?
---
Yeah, I don't get it
---
I always did powerplant next to it, so much faster than nuka-cola. Don't have to zone. The boxes are there, but I get no perk RNG.
---
RAGE QUIT 
---
@Bethesda : read this man's post please.
---
I'm going to down vote you for your cogent poignant and fair criticism. 
---
The hunters hood was an item taken from the dev room, it isn’t supposed to be in the game yet, it was probably recognised as such and deleted.
---
Agreed, they should have just capped max damage on the combo of the effects. 
---
They should have just made this fallout melee. They will probably need that too. 
---
I really didn't care that people were stacking radx or radshield till their eyes bled.
---
It didn't effect my gameplay in any way shape or form.
---
They didn't need to nerf it.
---
Same thing with White Knight.  Nobody complained about it.  But they still nerfed it.
---
It sucks.
---
What system do you play on?
---
Haha, i was lucky and got mine first time.... but i rock the x01 anyhow
---
They were locked to buy them from a vendor. Getting them from Patrol Duty was still possible. 
---
Oh yes, that's what I'm talking about!
---
I agree, the backlash is going to be scary. Gonna top the jacket for sure hahah
---
I'll happily be the voice actor for that
---
Only problem is how they are setting the price.  Totally unreasonable. 
---
Yup, this is why nothing will change and more and more items will come out like this. This post has a -12 rating right now. Assuming there were some upvotes there were probably only a few dozen people who downvoted this. And that's just people who frequent a reddit of the game. The vast majority of players probably won't care. And they are in the business to make money. They've already rationalized the decision above even though it was said repeatedly that atom shop items would be cosmetic only. There will be more of this.
---
It could be something to do with Power Armor, or having the card equipped when you spawn into the area. I don't know exactly but the search option is working now.
---
Put it all in your stash before crafting.
---
You did reply. ;)
---
Yeah, I read their "explanation" and I was like WTF how do they even think that's supposed to make sense?!?
---
Seems that when Rad Worms wears off, it breaks things too.
---
My Mutations stop working completely until I log off and back on.
---
That sounds like welcome additions
---
Because it's not meant to be in the game yet. You got ripped. They took it from the dev room.
---
I dont think you can use Grape Mentats and Day Tripper at the same time. You use DT when you dont have GM haha
---
What about stealthy stealth unstealth stealthed stealth nerfs?
---
How did you get the item?
---
If it was a duped item it could of ben deleted.
---
If an account is found to break TOS the items that are associated with that account will possible also be deleted.
---
I didnt say he wanted everything for free, I said he needs to play a different game if he doesn't want to deal with limitations he can't cheat to remove. Instead he whines on reddit about basic game features that don't work the same online as they do offline.
---
&gt;*autism snipped*
---
Holy shit I really pegged you right with the narcissism , this entire post reeks of mental illness.
---
&gt;DURRR YOU TOO DUMM DUMM TO READ MY INTELLIGENT POSTS
---
dude your post history is more hilarious than a George Carlin routine, you need to get help for your delusions of grandeur and blatant narcissistic rage. You went from trying to baby me like a toddler to autism spewing and insults. Way to confirm your mental imbalance. 
---
Like Kh3!!! Which is quiiite enjoyable btw!
---
Thats why you leg em first XD. Somebody nuked up near the Monongah PP and when I went there there was a couple of other players killing GG's.   I got up on one of the roofs and found a swarm of about 15 - legged every one then waved at the other guys to finish em off.  Pretty satisfying watching 15 limping ghouls. :)
---
Have fun!
---
Well, I'm going g back to a game I enjoy playing.
---
/wave
---
You really don't mention any particular specifics.
---
Who will voice the robots underneath? 
---
Same here in watoga I think all t45 and t60 plans for me not sure if this is gunna be filled all the time or what's goin on lol 
---
What platform are you on
---
You are part of a generation that wants EVERYTHING handed to them, grow up 
---
I’d do it. 
---
Everyone got the patch today
---
Fyre? Like the Bahamas mess of a festival? 
---
Just chiming in to state that I agree. I'm not angry anymore, the icon is just being moved to the section of my desktop that contains games I rarely think about. 
---
Maybe I'll hear it's turned around some time in the future, or maybe I'll never open it again. I'll definitely take more time to consider my next purchase from Bethesda.
---
Um, lets get some perspective.  You have been playing roughly 8 hours a day every day since release.  I’m not sure firing people that have contributed to that much of your life’s enjoyment is he right answer.  To that end, I’m not sure how you yourself have not been fired (or failing all your classes) if this is close to accurate.
---
My uncle did that to me once.
---
I can carry more in all my non-pa armor in everything except my Excavator Armor with calibrated shocks.  If it didn't have the shocks I could still carry more with normal armor at this point.
---
It could be a recipe like ultracite ammo or prime receivers. You can add know effects by crafting with rare junk (flux?) and a certain number of the same scrapped tag. At least then I would be able to control what I made and flux harvesting would be of value. 
---
Game been dead
---
3,000 caps?  The Vendor bot won't even give me ***300*** caps, WTF are you talking about?
---
I've yet to find anyone who actually wanted to buy anything for many caps.  I've sold some things cheap, to be nice though.
---
Maybe this has been mentioned, but the MODUS armory vendor is broken.... It just says busy.
---
Are you wearing PA?
---
They did, there are all the Unstoppables costumes; Manta man, Silver Shroud, Grognak and Inspector. We already have the [Mistress of Mystery, of course.](/spoiler)
---
I get it, I'm right there with you. I'm lvl 72 and it's becoming painfully clear that team play is a must. Wandering the wasteland alone or in a pair is going to be tougher now. 
---
Leave'em online.  Patch hasn't affected me.
---
I hate the White Knight nerf.
---
Nobody was asking for it.
---
Server hopping doesn't help either.  If you pick up a bag in World 1, it despawns that bag when you join World 2.
---
Take this from a guy that used to farm the lead weights at the gyms as fast as the despawn timer allowed.
---
They need to revert this White Knight crap.  Ballistic fiber was the bane of my early game experience.  Now they're bringing it back to torment me in late game.  F U to this nerf.
---
Hmmm so the actual explosive part 100% pens. Is the explosive legendary mod added to the value it shows for damage aka her tse says it does 142 so does that mean 142 is the most damage the gun can do when you hit a player one time or is the “tse” part a hidden damage value?
---
I don’t know how this game calculates damage but to me it sounds like if my gun does 100 damage and a player has 200 hp no resis at all then he would be at half hp.
---
I would like to read the comments of those who think this game is remotely difficulty. You literally get what you put into the game, eventually you'll find decent drops and work your way to some build that pays out some moderate challenges but mostly steamrolling.
---
The back pocket where i keep my wallet
---
Yep
---
THIS!  HAH!
---
So how much did you pay for your TSE
---
Idk coding sucks dick. Things like that happen. 
---
"Promptly"... with the next major patch.
---
Found the Destiny player.
---
Rainbow six siege
---
It’s wrong.  I farm a lot.  Have some decent weapons.  Some bought, some farmed.  Paying 1,500 caps for a non modded Radium Rifle is fucked up.  If you are going to pull this shit Bethesda you need to open up vendors all the time with no limits.  Oh and where was that on the update today? 
---
It’s showing two separate junk sections for his inventory, as though he’s trading or transferring, so all his junk weight is classed as someone else’s but it’s still in his inventory 
---
I didn't make it to Welch, but I checked both Watoga vendors and Harper's Ferry and didn't see them. I wonder if they made it a permanent spawn but restricted it to Graham...
---
On the bright side, it doesn't look like the prices for CAMP stuff went up much (if at all), it seems like only weapons, PA accessories, and some other rare stuff like serums were impacted. I bought the barn set and the fusion generator for ~200 each with hard bargain 3.
---
Nope. The majority of the people here are whiny menchildren. You keep being triggered, champ!
---
Oh. Well that's just Bizarre. Hmm, can't imagine how that would have happened. Maybe tied to this patch rolling back some bugs? Maybe start a new post and see if others are experiencing this as well.
---
Maybe the way the dealt with the plans in the system had a hiccup. 
---
You are level headed and a optimist.  I respect your opinion because of that. I can't help but feel like I'm justified in being upset but at the same time I feel like I'm throwing a temper tantrum because Bethesda broke my favorite toys. I feel disheartened at having to start from scratch to make a new build and I haven't figured out if its even worth it bc there is the off chance that whatever build we make can just be nerfed because a select few have issues with it. 
---
I had one weapon go from 145 to 45.  That’s BS
---
I'm ahead of the game dahg. Been using bladed tire irons literally my entire life 
---
You mean I used the player trading that Todd howard said would be an integral part of the game. Because you know this is an MMO. Where your supposed to trade with people.
---
So we are all in agreement that it's a bad PvP implementation... 
---
Exactly
---
You looked at my history? Lmao get a fucking life
---
You mean the guns i bought and duped and maxed caps on 4 different characters? Nah money well spent, nice try tho.
---
Mick.
---
Over 200 hours with the game. Was practically the only one of my friends who praised the game. Telling everyone to 'make your own adventures!'...
---
Now.. I mean. I feel like i got my moneys worth. Thats alot of play hours. But im completely throwing away any hope i had for the games redemption.
---
Game play design is different from technical issues.
---
Your list is technical issues.
---
Hence why I made an alt to server hop there. Still never got the plans.
---
With an unfocused build and a triple deathclaw I've swatted power tripping punks like you down with two smacks.  Now matter how you roll the dice 76 is NOT a PvP game.  It's the lamest throwback of PvP ever.
---
Sometimes I too succumb to the fire in my blood and make no sense. 
---
Mmm I get it, not really our job to care is it..
---
So what about players that got them legitimately? Your the problem making excuses for Bethesda crap game design 
---
This is a "feature" not a bug.
---
That being said, I agree with you, it sucks and needs to be put back.  It's a ***real pain in the ass now*** because I like to Bulk *everything* I get, I just do that automatically, it's like, well, like simply being *organized* - right?
---
It totally makes sense to let us automatically use stuff that was "Bulked".
---
I get it, maybe 1 out of 100 people likes the idea of not "auto junking" Bulked items, because it *wastes plastic* to do so.  But, it's not worth the pain in the ass to save plastic, which is hella easy to accumulate.
---
Yeah, I figured that out the hard way...
---
Ok, give me back the plastic i used to bulk it 😠
---
That doesn't mean they won't raise the prices later. This is mostly aimed at completionists who want a bargain.
---
Not at all, cuz I didn't lean on that crutch in the first place. 
---
I seen a long necked and armed scorched it bugged out on the floor creeped me out
---
Again, you have yet to compare the weapon to any other than a non legendary shotgun.  Read it again.  
---
You have done nothing but compare it to the non legendary shotgun, and complain about how OP TSE is.  
---
Remove mods
---
I might try for the next big purchases.
---
I'm on a PC too and have no issues with logging in.  
---
Vanilla, no mods.  GPU is 750ti
---
Ruined legitimate player shops with that 1500 weight deal. I spent 2 hours with my friends trying to move stuff to my other characters for my store front. 
---
Killed all explosives (just make the card no affect the modifier)
---
Killed White Knight for no good reason
---
Nerfed monster mash, like wtf? No one asked for that.
---
Everything but a glass cannon damage mitigation build is pretty much in the trash. (Just my opinion)
---
Treasure maps worthless now.
---
No reason to do events, all plans at vendors now.
---
Game is now farmcaps76 more than it was before. You wanted to kill RMT/duping, but people just gonna sell caps now that everything is available at vendors.
---
Plans worthless. When I finally got that full T60 plan set with shocks and other mods, it was wonderful, accomplished something useful and now everyone has it. No reason anymore to do anything.
---
Queen is even more worthless now with the plans for the UC PA and serum recipes available.
---
Yes the TS-E needed some adjustment, but not an adjustment to being completely useless. Punish the whole player base because some people's actions. Yep, prepare to get fucked by scorchbeasts with that incessant fucking green spam. Melee is next. Bloodied and anti-armor are next on the chopping block, just watch. Next thing you know, adrenaline is only one star and sneak has no modifier cards. Buffff to make stuff in line or add some new modifiers/legendary prefixes. This patch did nothing but jack stuff up worse than it was. 
---
I strongly disagree. Just because you invest points towards a build that gets nerfed doesn't give you the right to have a complimentary respec. Besides, the perks you chose are still viable it's not like your build is completely useless now. And if you don't like that, then it's your own fault for building your character like that. Bethesda owes you nothing if they tune the way specific perks work. 
---
Raising the cap limit would defeat the purpose of their raising the prices. 
---
Calm down, I am on day 64 waiting for my ticket to be answered. 
---
I heard they delayed the Fyre Festival dlc for the Katy Perry: Sweet Treats expansion, coming August 2019.
---
TedBacon it’s not that it’s the fact that the two shot and legendary effect are what made ranged weapons able to compete with melee
---
Wow....
---
Where specifically? There is like 5 roofs.
---
I still love this game! Just concerned a bit! ❤️ 
---
Hopefully Bethesda sees this or this was pointless lol.
---
Yep - I got in the habit of simply Bulking everything, every time I went to a Tinker's workbench, or back to camp - I just collected a little extra plastic so I could do that, and I felt good to be "organized" have my stuff bulked, take up less weight, and be salable to vendors.
---
Dang, you guys are lucky then 
---
\-Disable mods if you have any (Uninstall would be best)  
---
\-Uninstall any ENB/ReShade  
---
\-Do a file check
---
Borderlands 3 will make us all forget the fallout of 76.
---
LOL super valid. I'm rock rag tag gear while people are mobbing in portable tank armor! 
---
Yeah, I was lucky enough to find the shock plans for the armor I use before the price increase.
---
Like that show "Overlord" 
---
Some people appreciate it, some don't or have their own opinions. You coming here and acting like everybody else has the same opinion is kind of offensive to those without.
---
Yes, but why make something into a real pain in the ass when you don't have to?
---
The point of games, is to have fun, not make it as tedious as possible.
---
&gt;	Is it such a sunk cost you want everyone to walk off so you can stop paying for server time?
---
I think this is it honestly
---
Yeah, pretty significant stealth nerfs which were -surprise- not mentioned in the notes. Stealth stealth nerfs after we were told they'd stop doing that on patch days.
---
this is just unbelievable. they're about 50m to the finish line, and they do this. I don't know about their internal process, but it sounds like they test using an internal build and not the final one they post for downloads. YIKES
---
What happened to the PC first, then consoles? Who decided to drop that approach? They could have halted the xbox and PS4 patches until this got merged properly, now everything's gone to shit. 
---
They just keep shooting themselves on the foot.
---
After the decent writing it's like the whole game has been amateur hour.  
---
Checked a lever action, fully spec'd with demo/bloody/all rifleman perks, etc, the TSE hardened Lever action does 270. the normal hardened lever action does 170. Still not good. Most guns need a 25%-50% buff to base damage depending on the type, IMO.
---
Titanfall 2 released a new map, 2 new prime titans, a few camo packs and such just a few months after launch.
---
Yeah, some one was harassing me about my base in the whitspring. It's at the very far south of the place next to the mirelurk lake. I don't have any turrets, my doors are always unlocked so people can access my workshop if need be. He went on how my house and others are what's making the server trash, and that were lazy farmers that destroy the market. I just wanted to have a nice place to live...
---
The OP is probably a professional shill.
---
They aren't arbitrary, and that's what my first post is meant to convey but I guess your reading comprehension is as shit as you think mine is. The stash limits prevent you from hoarding EVERYTHING you find, like it was like in fo4. The vendor cap limit prevents supers from crashing the cap market with ease without giving Bethesda time to catch them. Build limit is there to stop people from building massive server crashing bases. Stale content is an opinion and the re-use of fo4 assets is fine imo because they didnt just copy and paste them, they improved the system they are a part of.
---
Basically if you werent a petulant child here to shit on the game because of your own ignorance you would have understood that these systems have a reason to be in place. But instead of admitting you got it wrong and maybe someone who disagrees with you has a point, you're probably going to keep flaming me while saying every reason I listed is a boogeyman. 
---
It literally says it was if you read the patch notes..
---
Lol, you mean major setback?
---
Another filthy casual reporting in.  Holy fuckballs did things shoot up in price. . . 
---
I got so many weapon mods from Harpers Ferry. Very happy. Only a dozen or so left to find. And I somehow neglected to buy the Cooking Stove crafting plan all this time wtf.
---
Lol so valid. Like before patch not moving I could SURVIVE tse blast multiple times. However, it would be at the cost of breaking limbs and armor :3
---
Nobody said rdr2. Learn to read. Also yes- it is a “moneygrab bull shit.” It has the same cosmetic money transactions as that game.
---
Yeah, sorry. People suck.
---
TSE Handmade top lvl with explosive perk and auto build. Had around +450 damage per shot, now it's 138. I do feel the nerf, but I'd say it's actually more fun now, when I still do damage, but can't 1shot kill every enemy in the game =)
---
TSE shotguns and rifles cant oneshot anything over level 10 from my field tests today. [And some mobs under 10 required 2 or 3 shots]
---
You can open a ticket, but if my experience is any guide you won't get a response and your item is prolly gone for good.
---
Sorry but I don't think they have the ability to restore lost items in this game.
---
Some peopke say the plan cost is a bug? Not too sure but id say hold off on those until you research on the
---
if they add more content it will likely break the game beyond repair
---
tread carefully...
---
Someone probably merged an old build to trunk/master/staging. GIThub detectives on full alert!
---
I can understand why a lot of people are mad. They spent their hard earned money on God Tier weapons that are now no better than random drops. 
---
If I had done that, taken the easy route and given real world money to duper’s who effectively created a ‘Pay to Win’ market I’d be furious.
---
Now these players are forced to either pay more money to the next best ‘Pay to Win’ weapon or play like the rest of us do.
---
It’s interesting how real world problems creep into virtual gaming.
---
The actions of a few ruin it for the many!!!
---
Look at the state of the game. What do you think?
---
I'm on Xbone unfortunately, but thanks anyways!
---
Arsenal fan tv-Fo76 edition. You just need to say “blud” more often. 
---
Yeah I realized I missed one. I thought the Bethesda launcher check would have ensured they were all gone but I got it now
---
Xbox here.
---
Also has the plan thing happened. Didnt say known in vendor in entory. It did once I bought it in my notes tab. 
---
The stash issue with bulked items is awful. It will prevent us from fixing things on the map when no stash is near by to scrap a bulk down for supplies. Like missile turrets.
---
Also still have the pip boy issue. If you open it justa moment too soon when loading in the game will freeze up with a black pipboy screen. You can only resolve this bu restarting the whole game client. 
---
It SHOULD because the "weight" isn't just about weight, it's about how much you can store, and it makes sense that if it's neatly tied up into stacked bundles, you should be able to store/carry more of the stuff.
---
Welp, a rep should take a look at your ticket as well then.  I can understand maybe a week response time, but 64 days is pretty excessive.
---
Underarmors were never vendor sold except the first 2 versions and the operative ones. I feel like the Shielded are probably still event drops only
---
In your Documents folder. 
---
imagine thinking that the tiny reddit represents "the community"
---
I'm just in a loop of "oh, no fusion cores better take over the power plant. Oops no ammo so they destroyed the fucking processor. Oops no gears to repair it. Better get gears. Oops they're attacking again and my turrets are ass. Repeat."
---
Really good point
---
bullshit
---
I haven't had to repair my armor in 20 hours of playing since I got white Knight. It should have been nerfed. It made repairing useless. It costs very little materials to repair armor. I don't understand the hate. Yes maybe make the armor cost less ballistic fiber without white Knight other than that, I see nothing wrong.
---
Oh wow. I forgot what year we are in. Pft. Lol
---
Nvm this is what i got from ladydevann
---
We've reached out to the Dev's for their reasoning behind this and have updated the patch notes with the following information;
---
• (Added Jan 29) Since many Plans and Recipes can now be sourced reliably from Vendors, we've also increased their Cap costs accordingly. 
---
​
---
No they just made them useless. They were coveted for a reason. 
---
So some weird bugs going on here.

Purified water seems to be restoring more thirst now (37%) which is the same as with Dromedary equipped. Except I don't have it equipped and when I equip it it goes up to 47%. Further I went to pick a 3 star lock, equipped all my cards and it said my lockpicking skill is at 4. Seems some perk cards are being counted even if not equipped?
---
lmfao same as usual 
---
Plan slot 1: Vent 
---
Plan slot 2: PA piece (now redundant and worthless to endgame players)
---
Plan slot 3: prime receiver i didnt have (one day these will run out)
---
Ah damn I was gonna invite you to come play with me and my friends. We always have a good time
---
For the love of god.....FIX THE SERVER STABILITY!!!!!!!!!!
---
Nothing worse than bouncing around like Im having a fit.
---
Every post like this validates the absolute shit out of my pessimistic comments that got me banned from /r/Fallout.
---
Neener fuckin’ neener, I was right ha ha.
---
1) What platform are you playing on?
---
Xbox One X
---
2) Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account
---
The Spoonisher
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable)
---
No screenshot available at this time.
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.)
---
I have a second character that I leveled up, and wanted to buy a couple plans.  Checked the vendor, and it is telling me I can buy them, but that I already know all of the same ones from my main.  I check by going to my camp on my second toon, and I cannot build anything that it says I know.  CAMP, weapons, armor, mods, all items.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable)
---
Today I took the Red pill.  
---
Had been a defender before, but as I can't even get the [Community Managers to respond to a significant bug + fix I've had numerous people ping them on](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/), and am [one of those people with Mules and an account I can't even use on my non-overweight characters](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/317914/account-weight-fix-is-apparently-account-wide/151?language%5B%5D=en) I think I'm tapping out.
---
shall I get you a box?
---
Exactly. This. 
---
If you got to that point you should have a basic viable build already so that's just not true. Getting a couple levels passed the point you currently are at while trying to juggle a few points around isn't as painful as you make it sound. 
---
My game just completely freezes when I try and walk/run anywhere. Doesn't bother to unfreeze. What the hell?
---
I was pretty disappointed that blitz was not in this game.
---
wait, that's illegal
---
Well that sucks. I've opened a ticket anyways though. Really hurts to have my first good legendary roll lost because of a server issue.
---
The only time I have experienced this is when the game has not fully loaded and I attempt to open my Pip Boy.
---
Feel like they have a wheel they spin for every update. Like oh it landed on nerf explosives and add old bugs back
---
Thought it looked wildly familiar.   
---
D2 was okay at first. Haven't booted that shit up in months. Got so tired of that didn't touch any games for months actually. 
---
Factually inaccurate.  
---
Internal Database has not shown up for me in more than 1,000 vendor interactions in Watago... and Optimized bracers was a hot trade item until this patch
---
He's talking recipes. Not the consumables. 
---
Good idea. Always drop some ammo first to make sure a bag appears before dropping anything or drop 1 piece of junk until you see a bag before you drop the rest. I lost my All Rise a few days ago ..
---
They mean you wont be buying duplicate plans from vendors. They will show which plans you already know.
---
Sneaky sniper is the way to go with all of the damage multipliers
---
My tse combat shotgun took like 5-6 shots to kill a lvl 50 robot in watoga. The tse lever action I have did like maybe 10-20% damage to a lvl 65 scorch human.
---
Stacks my man.
---
So did somebody say it was a problem or not?
---
I'm not unhappy with the prices, as crazy high as they are. I just wish vendors has a higher base cap pool (500?) and/or got more caps back than the currently inexplicable 1:4 ratio.
---
Yes, please. Something nice, maybe blue? And a neat little bow on it.
---
Thank you kind sir/mam
---
i feel your pain, as does my chapless cowboy character
---
My max carry is 260. I spawned in with 205 lbs total. It's not weight.
---
Oh well, game over man. I wonder what happened to that idea, it might have helped them save some face here.
---
Known bug, you can scrap the bulk and you can use it
---
Ignoring the second paragraph those are excellent points, and I agree.
---
I did, this morning, before they apparently decided it was a feature. They were not in the patch notes till recently. 
---
Reading through multiple posts that brought this up I hadn't seen the response until a minute ago.
---
troubleshooter prime gause- 846 down to 370
---
2se lever 812 to 234
---
I did not open the PipBoy.
---
Ots not at all viable against a bloated glowing one in a white springs nuke area. I know, I just use a TSE .44 western revolver and it took more than 2 clips to kill one.
---
Scrap them first, heard bulk needed to be scrapped before
---
I've enjoyed my time with 76 pretty much up until today so I feel you on this. I've only spent about 300 hours playing and have enjoyed my time with it but logging in today was depressing. If you want to nerf explosive damage and 2 shot output that's fine whatever but I'm putting 76 on the shelf untill they balance out some of the other builds or at least offer a free respec. Don't get me wrong I know their output needed an adjustment but this kinda seemed unreasonable. Now I'm hesitant to dump time into changing my build or just start a new character altogether because the nerfhammer might swing down again and I'll have wasted hours upon hours of play time...again.
---
How do you become apart of that fancy raiders flair thingy?
---
  The game needs serious Balance work, nerfing TSE is good, they were too much more powerful than base ranged weapons, but they also need to get melee more in line and make sure they are not making creatures, even more, bullet spongy than they already are.  The PVP mode is going to be a train wreck if they don;t
---
Mine say different. With all shotgun perks, full deomlishion expert, all best mods on shotgun, and full bloody mess I could not one lvl 30+ super mutants, players, death claws, sloths. Could not one shot lvl 40+ gouls, lvl 68 scorched, or windigos. Not calling you a liar just had a completely different experience. The combat could almost 1 shot. I tested double barrel, pump, and combat.
---
170k+ people....
---
No, don't want to wear those ugly clothes even for the bonus. I'm sorry
---
They are too cheap to have one. I guess thry don't realize they are still going to end up paying for it in the loss of players. 
---
Last time I played was during the launch of the second shitty expansion. Only because I had the season pass. When forsaken came out I went "hell no am I gonna pay another 40 to get the fucking game I bought at launch" and left the game for good.
---
Why do you think that buffing your Strength and Int would boost damage done by a rifle? AFAIK only melee and unarmed damage are boosted by Strength.
---
This! So much this! I'm tied of devs nerfing the OP rather than buffing the under performing. I'm looking at you WoW, you F'ers!
---
Thank you for this opinion. Although, I do not agree with the first point about perks, I one hundred percent agree they fucked up in rolling back the version. Silly mistake on their part. If they do end up giving up on this game that will probably be it for me on Bethy games. Its a sad state for gamers when you look at a lot of the triple a game companies. EA, activision, and now Bethy have just ruined what brought them to the top. They lost sight of themselves. Cash rules everything on these streets. 
---
the Fyre doc on NF is directed by the guy who did American Movie. fuck the Hulu Fyre doc, all fake news.
---
Holy fucking fuck, I cant believe they actually expected us to just get these recipes through rng
---
It was fine to adjust the op TSE combination, but don't touch the demolition perk card that now makes the old normal explosive weapons even weaker! (Agl, missile launcher, m79)
---
I'm sorry for her or maybe him, not sure.. I'll just stop now. 
---
Wow, no wonder I could never find any other mods, internal database and optimized bracers were the ones I saw the most. 
---
Ah that's sweet, I appreciate the sentiment x
---
My friends aren't quitting because of bugs.
---
My friends are quitting because of NO NEW CONTENT.
---
They're bored.  They're leaving.  That's the reason.
---
Now I feel self conscious about my chunkiness and I'm still lost about this bug. Thanks man. Kick me in the feels. ^(/s)
---
Nah, 260 max I spawn in with 205 lbs.
---
Oh, yes, let us get right on that. Getting someone to craft an item no obtainable recipe exists for?
---
You think that's funny? There's still people trying to sell them for irl cash. 
---
I only ever use my broadsider in conjunction with the Wrecking Ball perk. It's fun, but pointless.
---
Mine is in that area, too (next to the stream and the broken wall). I don't know why that's a problem in the least. It's centrally located and has access to a ton of vendors without having to fast travel.
---
Sounds like a new bug, have seen a few posts regarding this issue. Would hazard its due to them restricting auto-scrap killing off desirable items. 
---
Trying, and failing, to get a TSE weapon was really my only endgame at level 93.  I'm not really sure there's a reason to log in beyond cosmetic upgrades.  It was a great game to play though, even with it's rough patches.
---
The thing you were responding to said
---
&gt; no one said that was the issue
---
in response to a comment that breaks OP's point down to *only* being about the perk.
---
THE issue. There are many issues, this is not THE issue, and is pretty minor overall.
---
Yes, OP said it's **a** problem. But the thread isn't about it.
---
I love fallout so much, but this patch is probably going to get me to uninstall and just play kingdom hearts until anthem comes out... Is it too much to ask for a patch that actually fixes the problems instead of band-aid after band aid in which half the time it makes the game unstable or rolls back previous changes. 
---
Missile launcher needs some love
---
Starting to feel like the only one who is having fun 😂
---
I think my weapons damage was around 200-300 and with explosive demolitions at 5 stars they were around 400+ now my handmade and lever action is around 100+ and combat shotgun is 200+. I didn't even see a damage increase with the perk card equipped so I don't know if they changed that to were the perk card doesn't effect explosive legendaries.
---
## [BUGS] [PC] Post-patch 29/01/19
---
This is a compilation of the bugs \[PC version\] I found post patch 29/01/19. I am posting it as one post, as Reddit wants me to wait 8 minutes in between each post. I have also posted those on the Bethesda f76 forums.
---
Edit: I am reposting this from a thread i just created, as I realised this is the thread for Fallout 76 Issues and Feedback 
---
**\[BUG\] Cap collectors perk not working (post-patch 29/01/19)**
---
So I have tried out those new cap stashes.
---
My cap collectors perk doesn't change the amount of caps I get, it doesn't give me that extra option to search for more caps.
---
I tried un-equipping / re-equipping the perk card, but still no luck.
---
**\[BUG\] Cannot craft from bulked junk items (post-patch 29/01/19)**
---
When in a crafting station, bulked junk items don't show up in the amount of materials you have available.
---
The only way to unlock those materials is to scrap the bulk items.
---
**\[BUG\] Known plans not showing as 'known' (post-patch 29/01/19)**
---
I had a couple of plans that showed as 'not known'with one of the vendors, so I bought them.
---
Upon eating / learning them, I got a prompt saying: 'You already know this plan' or something similar.
---
I was still able to consume the plans. I knew for 100% sure I already owned one of them, but just gave it a go anyway. It was the 'small water purifier'.
---
**\[BUG\] Mutation effects not always working (post-patch 29/01/19)**
---
My mutations are still showing up on my pipboy, but I am sometimes unable to jump at my normal marsupial height.
---
I have to go back to the main menu and join in again for the mutation effects to kick in.
---
**\[BUG\] Over encumbered but no red icon / sound to let me know (post-patch 29/01/19)**
---
I couldn't run, so I thought the 'sprinting' function stopped working.
---
Turns up it was the fact that I was over encumbered, but the game didn't indicate it to me the way it usually does.
---
No red icon / sound to let me know.
---
This issue looks like it doesn't happen all the time, but happened to me a couple times over a couple of gameplay sessions.
---

Made my day. The metal walls plan is in my sights. 
---
Beat it, nerd.
---
Oh that sucks. Good luck with that. Another player posted a photo were they are underweight but locked out from vendors.
---
I two manned her with TSE shotguns so that cant be true.
---
Someone's burnt out. 
---
 Unless they have changed things in the latest patch don't bother bulking anything but lead and aluminum unless you are selling it.
---
lmao, i'm learning how to code in swift and literally the third lesson on the course was on version control....
---
Tell me more about this cap grind.. and how do I adaptors it to my low level ( lvl21 )
---
Can you tell me if Friendly Fire works with the laser/plasma fire damage mods? I'm leveling a medic CHAracter right now and that's my end game plan. Just auto-laser some fire on the team.
---
I have my camp setup there as well. Turned the building on the East side into a store waiting for player vending to be introduced.
---
It’s a nice spot and away from all the mayhem of the Whitespring Nuke Farming. 
---
They def screwed the pooch on this one. Just the nerfs to Explosive, and Demolition Expert have resulted in weapon damage being reduced by something like 160-200% for most weapons. That's not even including the nerf to Two Shot, which you would think if its going to get its damage dropped from 100% to 25% than the negative effects would have also been greatly reduced, but no. Now Two Shot is one of the worst effects in the game, and Explosive on some weapons is a joke, have heard Demolition Expert 5 on some weapons like a 10mm Pistol only increasing your damage by 6 freaking points....
---
For the love of god why don’t they just hire the hard working modders and bring them all in house? The modders are solution-focused people, and that is what Bethesda needs!!! 
---
I don't even bother with picking locks anymore. I hate changing out 4 perk cards just to pick a level 3 lock. Same goes with hacking. It's not like I'm going to find a legendary weapon in a safe.
---
I appreciate that. I can't tell you how many times I have restarted games or played one all the way through and played it again just because it was fun to do. This game is a bear with the weight restrictions, cap restrictions and getting through it and getting all the stuff is hard. Sure you can buy it from ebay or other sellers but doing it all in the game legit is tough and to me, a lot of fun. 
---
That was the 2 shot part, when in range
---
Oh, the endgame is too easy? Nerf everything. My buddy even lost damage on his melee build.
---
Perhaps patience is the key! Although, patience has never helped my personal life. LOL
---
&lt;3 thanks for input/backup.
---
I just can't rationalize everything that was done. TSE stuff is aight... Disheartening... however, to those who want to RP a EXPLOSIVE FATMAN BEAST MONSTER they got taken out side and shot.... 
---
Thank you Bethesda for your continued effort in figuring out this whole multiplayer thing. Thank you for the gaming experience that has eaten 500+ hours of my time, the pleasure truly has been mine. Thank you for the changes that you implemented today. And lastly a preemptive thank you for the future adjustments, DLC, etc. 
---
I'm sorry for the people who complain and whine on here and wherever they do. These people sadly you will never satisfy. No matter how many nerfs, buffs, cuts, adds, these people are nothing more than consumer's. Mindless, selfish, self centered, egomaniacal consumer's. 
---
My findings, handmades are good If you mod them to powerful automatic with a drum mag, the penetration card, and 3 rifle cards. Shotguns are actually still strong after the patch. Both weapons take about 3 shots to kill now instead of 1. Heavy guns took the biggest hits and are all literally trash now.
---
How do you expect people to seriously believe you're not here to bash the game when the first thing you do is defend a shitpost that had the depth of thought of a puddle?
---
They had the ability to make hardened mass, beer bottles, deathclaw hands etc non-scrappable. 
---
I dont know what they changed to make mods not scrap (which is great btw) but having to scrap your bulk before crafting is such a colossal pain in the ass it's not funny. 
---
Play fallout 4
---
the content can't be sidelined if it wasnt planned to release before the pvp in  the first place.
---
Well...this is how the MMO's with their shit together roll.  
---
Sure you’re happy that this happen and not your 5k caps worth of cool mods 
---
So why are they nerfing things in a mainly PvE game? Why make a pain in the ass grind like armor maintenance even worse? Waste of Dev time nerfing White Knight
---
My reality of the weight limits which have not been changed again in the last patch despite them ruining the game for many of us:
---
I am stuck towards the bottom right of the map, outside the Cranberry Bog. I cannot respawn anywhere else when I die, I can only trudge and can't fast travel because I'm carrying a few different weapons and am overweight despite carry little meds, little water, a couple pieces of weightless junk and no food. I've used all my supplies trying to leave. I've been walking around for two days and there is nothing here but Mutants of a much higher level than I am, with mini-guns etc. The only weapons which are getting dropped are rubbish. No Stimpacs located or dropped as loot in two days. I've used all my explosives trying to get out of here. It's boring as bat-shit, frankly. 
---
Be careful, some plans say they arenr known until you purchase them, even if you already read them. 
---
I'm having a blast, I'm just glad to finally be "me" in a fallout game again.
---
Nope. Its gone forever. Happy grinding for another.
---
I admit to buying the storage skin, but really the rest is trash, I’m primarily solo and use food as my buff these outfits/buffs for a week are just sad
---
The 4 poster bed is tiny. 
---
Nice! I work as a defect/issue coordinator so when the masses freak out about time between patches, dev work and QA, I tend to just sigh and not get into it lol
---
Pitfall was pretty epic on Atari.
---
42
---
haha well granted that it was amazing to solo 3 SB in about a minute with no issues, now you actually have to think about HP if you are like me, and suck at different "no hp loss" builds that people do in pvp etc
---
Ok, who's in control of the devs at Beth? Do they even play their own game? Every single nerf of this so called patch can be summed up as "play a Power Armor Melee build".
---
At least give us an option to respec for free if you pull this kind of shit. Better yet, stop nerfing things that didn't need one and add some decent content. 
---
is this  a plan you can learn by crafting/scrapping combat armor?
---
Actually I don't know if it;s PA or not. I had one that had no search option while not wearing PA. I went to another one and went back to that one and the search option was there. Could be some kind of lag delay thing. It could also be something to do with PA, but not 100% sure.
---
the queen is pretty easy with 2 people , even easier solo.
---
Then perhaps you were experiencing the health glitch with explosive guns where it damages but doesn't do the full amount it should? I kill 68+ enemies in maybe 10 shots including times I miss. Again non-legendary gun without majority of perks for that gun. So I find your situation to be exaggerated with your "pistol build" and with a tse... 
---
Strange I haven't tried logging in yet. 
---
 I can only hope the massive jump in plan prices is a mistake.
---
&gt;and have updated the patch notes with the following
---
I thought Bethesda had learned this lesson the last time they chose to release incomplete patch notes.
---
Evidently not.
---
The tippy top with the chest and the furnace key.
---
Ok, but those tse shotguns standing on the bunker dod almost no damage. Tse was little better than crafted guns for the queen.
---
Op, like most games fallout needs a community and people to stand with it and believe in it. This is also the first big multiplayer game they’ve made so they’re not perfect. Everyone can see they aren’t the best at this but we as a fallout community can guide them and stick with them until they get how to do multiplayer, it has great potential but once you put that bad taste in your mouth it’s hard to get it out. So don’t hold a grudge and stick with them because I’m sure that with enough patience this game can really shine
---
I'm a software developer by profession, and I can't imagine how it's possible that a company like Bethesda roll out a broken game like this. I get taking on some tech debt to make tight deadlines and all but it's like as if this game was never tested, or rather tested at scale. And to have existing bugs come back after a patch, there's no excuse for that. 
---
I just want to go full auto laser. It's such a satisfying WHAMWHAMWHAM. Sucks that "Friendly" Fire only works with the flamer then. I had high hopes.
---
These are more likely bugs and unknown issues than known (and unannounced) nerfs. Now whether that's better or worse is up to you, personally I'd prefer it if they had incomplete patch notes than if they just had no idea what they were releasing.
---
U know what else should increase 
---
Explosive weapon dmg
---
Who is going to be the shitty rifle build who shoots the queen down for all of the melee builds?
---
I got a Bloodied / Exp shotgun that I need to test. I will reply with confirmation. Would it be possible for you post your build via picture or nuka dragon? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
I hop on every patch to see if the game is less shitty. Going to just skip this one. 
---
Hmmm... I didn't know that. I'll look into that 
---
Yea, he and I established that already. 
---
Possibly. 
---
Pipboy freeze is still there. Girlfriend opened her pipboy and the screen was empty and then she froze for awhile. Still have infinite loading screens too. Yay! /s
---
The same reason I play video games, to kill time. 
---
I'm having an issue trying to claim workshops lately on XBox One, every time I show up to like Charelston Landfill or Sunshine Meadows, I get the objective to clear enemies form the workshop, and even see the markers for the enemies (if there's only a few), but they're entirely invisible. Can't shoot them, can't interact with them... and they're stuck that way. The workshop can't be claimed and the enemies can't be killed. Today when I arrived at the Landfill, two enemies "spawned" with markers and all, but the markers are just floating in mid air. Yesterday, I tried to claim Sunshine Meadows with my team, and most of the Ghouls that I needed to clear spawned, except one. One sat there invsisible next to one of the extraction sites with a marker I could see but do nothing about. Fast travelling and zone changing did nothing.
---
Additionally during "Defend \[X Workshop\]" events, I'm getting enemies such as molerats, scorched and mongrels that are spawning under ground, are invisible, or spawn but are frozen and unkillable for long periods making the objectives time consuming to complete, especially if we had stopped a quest to go back and defend it. Gamertag is KMFireReaver and Bethesda username is same as my reddit one. I had hoped the patch would fix it but no :(
---
I'm on mobile, I don't know how it will work on desktop.
---
Here, you go to the sub main page, and on the top right corner there will be 3 dots with an option to change your flair.
---
But remember, the jet will make you jittery!
---
Had that where a guy would auto regen health at a certain point almost like a legendary
---
I just believe they’ve approached it wrong but could easily roll back and retry but wont.

Not just any tambourine. A death tambourine.
---
Yeah, I'm not reading all that. Learn to edit. 
---
Only have 1\* combat shotguns and love my quad and double.  Less swapping of magazines means more bullets downstream quicker.  Love kneecapping the Whitesprings nuked ghouls.
---
I can only dream of having TSE versions of the combat shotguns.
---
I do have a TS pump shotgun but it is alot slower than the combat shotguns and lost less less capactiy.
---
I have to disagree, not out of love for TSEs but out of experience.
---
It's really not that much. Discover a way to make a steady income maybe?
---
If you feel it’s an exploit, I think your supposed to report it to Bethesda along with the ID of said player.
---
I wonder if PvP is pushed because somebody on the board wants Fallout: Fortnite to be a thing. Buy digital items, shoot people, buy things!
---
I really want to play melee, but I dunno if it's because lag or whatever but melee combat in this game is really finicky for me. Like I will hit an enemy square in their face and hear a smacking noise but somehow the enemy doesn't get damaged at all. It happens particularly often when an enemy is strafing or running away from me. 
---
I meant with the bulk of the damage coming from bloodied (done properly, adrenal reaction, nerd rage and all the other damage perks).

Again , believe what you want, that isn't the case. I was melting them in two shots before the patch, admittedly overpowered. After the patch, it was flat out tedious.
---
Something similar happened to me just now. I was trying to repair a shotgun and even though it said I had all the materials (which indeed I had) I couldn't repair it. 
---
Not even. Let everyone who already owns the game be able to "beta test" it as they shut the servers down for a while. Take the game off for sale for a bit. The people who already own the game are able to play during beta testing for each patch to make sure everything is being patched as intended. Thousands of players are more likely to find bugs than a small QA team
---
As Trump supporter who uses Reddit you can rest assured i've witnessed the most disgraceful, rabid and disgusting behaviour from people on this site, this sub is like a kiddy pool haha.
---
Seriously! Not to mention I haven't got a 3* from a SBQ in probably 20 kills. What's the point of killing it if you've got better chances with random 3* mobs elsewhere? Even though their chances of dropping one is still garbage.  BUT when you FINALLY  get a 3* it's a stalkers meat hook or an instigating Mr. Handy.
---
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
You say you “fixed” this issue: Foundations: Fixed an issue that could cause a “Cannot place item: Needs support” message to display when editing a partially floating foundation.
---
Well I noticed it has NOT been fixed I have a foundation (floor) and I try to put any item such as a PAS on it and it goes green for a second then to red and stays that way staring “Cannot place item: Needs support.” And there IS support there now how do you explain you “fixed” this when that issue is still there? I seriously am starting to regret ever buying this game between players just farming you for junk and caps to the very very broken game not sure which is worse...

Cant forget the “fist of god” either 
---
+Karma
---
This whole game is a fucking joke.
---
Thanks for another useless post no-one here cares about. cheers.
---
I would have started differently if that guy wasnt a blatant shitposter that bashed as much of the game as he can. He's not here to discuss these issues, hes here to farm karma.
---
Same if u scrap it’ll work tho
---
Id say fix the game first, add stuff later.
---
hope you get it sorted
---
ESO and Wow, to name some, do or did this. It's mind boggling that ESO allows this and FO76 doesn't. It's the same damned company.
---
What's so broken about it? I played on Xbox for 8 hours today.  No servers lag. All went well
---
Worse Patch Ever. Seriously watching this game get driven into the ground! 
---
Yea I don’t see why a hazmat suit can’t just be an under armor. It’s not like it would be the default, it would ONLY be useful for nukezones and people would run ANY of the other underarmors during normal play
---
And there’s really good pop music. 
---
What you waiting for?
---
With everything else ironed out now I'm sure they'll put the top minds at the studio working on these cosmetic requests.
---
Exterminators explosive with a hardened receiver here and it took about 5 shots to kill level 68 Super Mutants.
---
I only tried 3 or 4 of them before I ran away and turned the game off.
---
Thanks, good sir!
---
Jet city.... WOooooooman here I come.
---
 oh ffs, Tt is 15 hp and lasts for a week.  
---
I think that your perk probably broke
---
This is already in the game... 
---
Now we need a system that let's one person drop an item to be modded, and the other person uses their skills to mod it. I'd never just hand over a good item to a random person.
---
At least the turd is a little bit more polished, eh
---
Good move but tbh your better off buying the mod or finding it tbh. 
---
Not sure if this is to be counted as a bug (as it is just a regression) but in case u want to mention it. Bobby pin weight regression back to 0.1
---
Bethesda is too cheap for hotfixes. That's why Consoles normally get patches a week later, so they can "hotfix" it then. Of course, then they pull this bullshit. I can't respect them as a company or anyone willing to work there at this point.
---
That was pretty obvious from the beta lol. The game is clearly rushed, and I'm not entirely sure why. They ended up competing with a ton of huge releases, and they did irreversible damage to the Fallout name to a lot of players. It was very obvious that they rushed things entirely too much. Even ignoring bugs entirely, there were a lot of questionable design decisions that can only be explained by a lack of time to think of a better alternative (Stash limit being so low being the most obvious one). There's also the lack of endgame content, the fact that we have Scorchbeasts which are poorly balanced bullet sponges with reused assets from Skyrim as the "final bosses" of the game is kinda silly. Especially considering they put a ton of effort into finding lots of unique creatures that could have been used to diversify the end game content a bit. 
---
I'm sure they rushed it out because they were worried it wouldn't do well, and weren't willing to sink the resources into it that they would a more "safe" title, and I'm sure they've made a good bit of money on Fallout 76 overall (Even with all the hate, the game sold really well for a game developed in such a short time frame), but I do worry they've fucked up and have lost the trust of a lot of their most passionate fans. 
---
Well that was fast! Thanks again!
---
Does this mean my medic’s explosive Gatling plasma is like, really sought after now?
---
I'll be honest, my significant other and I loved FO4. First game she'd ever played. We were STOKED for 76, especially since we're both from the area. We bought a second tv and Xbox to play together. Blew a lot of money to make this happen. Loved it when it came out. Loved it for the first month. Then bugs started to add up. Got grindy too, but that's livable. But we both work full time and have a kid. Finally get a game breaking bug back in mid December. . . It was pretty devastating. We try to get back on occasionally but. . . Just can't do it. Now we see things like this, and damn. It's just . . . Sad. We want to really get into this like we did FO4 ESPECIALLY since we're playing together. It's just a sad, lost opportunity at this point. I hate to day that. I really do.
---
There is a perk card and armor that regens health. Also a mutation when not in combat.
---
Gatling is still pretty strong
---
Something that did \~2,000 damage without armor strategies which would now be like \~700 damage (still enough to 1-shot players PVP wise mostly).  Only ones that come to mind are TSE harpoon or TSE dragon. 
---
The large water pump is now giving 4 purified water instead of 5 as well. Not like rage inducing but another stealth Nerf I suppose.
---
Have you tried a nice handmade? I do about half the damage of my all rise, per shot. Combined with vats crits, they did very well with penetrating ammo. Tse was not meta for the queen.
---
Yes Legendary two shot explosive guns,completely different from the launchers that have the durability of maybe 12-16 shots and already had a low base damage compared to how much enemies in this game like to bullet sponge
---
Stacking more armor penetration would only hurt the anti-armor legendary, as it’s a regressive benefit (the more you have, the less benefit, plus I *believe* it’s not additive reduction but multiplicative reduction... even better for TSE)
---
Didn’t even check the actual items just plans. So radium rifle was selling for 1.5k caps? Yeah that’s BS. I really wish they’d remove that stupid 200 cap daily vendor limit. Knowing these devs they’d need the amount down to 50 caps but you can get a five star perk card that gives you 50 more caps per star. 
---
Sentinel's Assassin's Armor(if they stand still hard to do damage), Cavalier's Assassin's Armor(if they're sprinting they take much less damage), Unyielding Assassin's Armor (for low health high rad builds), And which ever it is for high health "Vanguard's"(I believe) Assassin's Armor
---
I don't typically do this but I upvote this all day
---
I can't even trade with any MODUS vendor because they all say they are busy. WTF Bethesda? Fix your shit. Oh wait, you can only break it more.
---
They didn’t. I’ve noticed a slight buff actually. My powerfist (500 damage) now takes 10 solid hits instead of 9. 
---
Isn’t that great! Because Harder to kill certainly means harder gameplay and harder gameplay is more fun! We haven’t objected to this logic in every other open world game with combat!
---
I am on 21:9, an after patch same thing happened to me
---
Your plea is like saying "the super op non skill required tse I had got nerfed, I deserve a brand new 2* legendary weapon with the latest op perks..." 
---
Sorry pal I hope they don't refund you, none of you deserve it. It's your own fault for investing into a meta that was going to get nerfed. 
---
Yeah, he had a really shitty way of saying "this has not a lot to do with what you replied to"
---
That event normally has lvl 40 enemies 
---
Spotted them at the watoga train vendor, just a moment ago
---
Harpers Ferry
---
Thanks, I didn’t know. 
---
Jesus Christ.

Bethesda did not "drop" item degradation for Fallout 4.  There was NEVER item condition or degradation in any Bethesda made Fallout game, Obsidian added it into NV and people enjoyed it so much for its added realism in actually having to maintain your equipment that people were pissed when Bethesda didn't carry the feature over to 4 and it was a top requested mod that just couldn't get implemented because the basics were missing.
---
Why did Bethesda not carry it over to 4?  Because while Obsidian focused on making a good Fallout game Bethesda focuses on making a profitable fallout game, and while hardcore and realism loving players love item degradation it's the casual players that hate having to do any extra work and those are who Bethesda catered to for Fallout 4. 
---
Why did they add it back to 76?   Because it's a fucking survival game and having to maintain your equipment just makes sense.
---
White Knight NEEDED to get nerfed.  Cry about it all you want but the perk was too fucking powerful.  I have pieces of legendary armor I haven't taken off for more than a month and they STILL haven't needed to be repaired yet and even IF I needed to repair them it would cost almost nothing.  I have a surplus of almost 200 ballistic fiber just gathering dust in my stash because I always thought I'd need them and never have had to touch them.
---
I ran around trying to find the BOS torso plan and didn't see any BOS whatsoever. Was also hoping to see more deep pocket plans too. Idk
---
It's just a pvp community, with bounty hunting service. PVP was fun because of the thrill that somone can one shot you with a tse, having a bounty was fun for the same reason. You had to work hard to be able to survive being one shotted. I just had 3 guys come after me because my character still has a bounty. Still killed them. the only difference is now both sides are complete bullet sponges, its not fun just shooting a bullet sponge for 5 mins straight while they sim pack is just annoying.
---
So i drop something with low value, if the bag is there just trade the intended items to the bag? Thanks, will try that. It does help a lot, but doesn't tackle the whole problem. Its a start though, not to lose valuables! Thank you!
---
Played Xbox tonight.  Can confirm that bug is back.  On another note I've quit the game as well as 3 people in my party.  Enough is enough
---
That would be logical. Too logical for the rocket scientists running the show over at Bethesda.
---
Wait until the game loads to pull out pip boy. 
---
Unexpected Hitchikers, I like it.
---
Probably removed from game so they can sell BOS stuff in ATOM shop soon.  
---
Again, *metric crap ton* of radaway taking up room in my stash. There is a creek right behind my camp. No need to travel. 
---
The Harper's ferry vendor usually has plans I think
---
Nothing for me either. Took two runs.
---
For the first month I also thought it was purely management. At this point though the fact that no one has stepped up makes me feel like this is a problem down to the very root of the company.
---
It seems like they broke stealth with that line of site 'fix' intended just for PvP, it sounds like it's really hitting PvE hard. 
---
Yeah I got this game for Christmas and I’ve been waiting for it to be stable to start I think I might just sell it 
---
Hey, as luck would have it, a medic’s gauss rifle dropped tonight for me. If you want it, I’m happy to hold onto it for you. 
---
Doesn't work. I've been server hopping and cleaning out the golf course, just so I can keep infected and be able to jump. :D
---
Yeah... Just ignore the plethora of game breaking bugs it brought.
---
No, not useless, but if you have too many guys with tse show up, you will have a hard time killing the queen on time as she scales up. They just dont work very well.  Need penetrating ammo or melee for the queen.
---
when did they roll back patches?? Is there confirmation? When was this? 
---
Simply logging in is enough effort to find these bugs, QA... Bruh.
---
Nobody expects the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy!
---
I'm still waiting for the promised completely optional PVP. It's not optional if someone can still kill me with slap damage, no matter how long it may take. It's not optional if Pacifist mode doesn't stop accidentally hitting somebody's camp and getting wanted. Optional doesn't mean anybody can walk up to my camp and flatten it in seconds flat when I have Pacifist mode on. Optional doesn't mean the game will give me a quest to go get a supply drop, then make me wanted for completling the quest because the supply drop was owned by somebody else. Seriously Bethesda, WTF on that last one? You didn't tell me to go steal somebody else's supply drop, you just told me to get it like you have 100 times before. WTF?
---
Just finished Scorched earth for the first time today and got squat.  Absolutely nothing.  Used up all my ammo, accidentally got a bounty, and the stupid beast didn't even have any meat.  I'm very unhappy with this.
---
I'm gonna stop playing if all they're gonna do is jerk us around hoping we buy from the shop.
---
And uninstalled. Fix your shit gMey
---
Coming when the game is more than 3 months old...
---
Their is a legendary effect called Auto Stim that can save you but it has a time limit for how often it will occur. If you were constantly damaging him and his health wasn't budging or instantly refilling once he should have be dead then you or him might have been completely desynced from the server or the damage glitch is back.
---
Or he was cheating but I like to think of all the alternatives before just jumping to that conclusion. May I ask did anything or anyone manage to kill this guy at some point after you couldn't kill him? Were you able to damage and kill other people or NPC's before or after your encounter with this guy? Was this guy completely immune to damage from other players or NPC's?
---
&gt;Thousands of players are more likely to find bugs
---
Will ACTIVELY search for them.
---
We don't know the coding, so we don't look in one spot, we try break the WHOLE thing!
---
And that's the beauty of free BETA players like us, if we're heard, and our discovery is fixed, we're gonna keep at it. "Many hands make small work"
---
Final Fantasy 14's servers shut down because they had to redesign the ENTIRE game from the most fundamental level.
---
What we need is for all of the armchair game devs to chill the fuck out and stop pretending they know what's best for this game.  People are pissed off that their OP weapons and OP perks got nerfed and they're actually going to have to use more bullets to kill shit and repair their armor more often and actually play the fucking game instead of just coasting.
---
I just bought x-01 stealth boy for $460 I was surprised it wasn't more expensive. 
---
No shit , the point I'm making is that a top tier 3 star legendary pistol shouldn't feel tedious to kill bloated glowing ones . It was clearly overpowered before, I don't think Tse needs a bump necessarily, I think pistols need a bump up.
---
On top of the bad patch, it broke my ability to get in the game.
---
Tried verifying the files, didn't work.
---
Now reinstalling the game.
---
Unfortunately the download speed maxed out to 100% speed for the first 25% of the download, then down to 3% speed now.  I can't restart it either because it doesn't save the progress of the previous download.
---
My salt level is getting higher the longer this download takes.  Looks like my salt level will be increasing for the next 38 hours and 54 minutes.
---
Meh, best to just walk away from a dumpster fire.  Servers will be offline by the end of the year. 
---
If they were going to nerf it from +100%, at least put it at like +50% or +70%. Why all the why down to 20...
---
Meh. We managed fine.
---
Been to every vendor with no luck.
---
For a power player?  Sure.
---
It's still a relatively small subset of total melee players, whereas TSEs were so ubiquitous that everyone and their uncle had them.
---
It won't automatically scrap bull wrapped junk
---
Bitch your mom's a Sex Doll, you robotic bastard!
---
Usually they just scream into the sky, but by the end i like to think that anyone coming across the comment thread will notice the thread of common sense present in mt arguments, and hopefully also notoce the deranged lunacy often present in reddit liberals. 
---
Gonnanplay tambourine man on mah microphone 
---
smh they better address this it is an absolute shit show now
---
Good luck with that now.
---
Yawn. 
---
Sbq has also been broken for a while now, the explosive vent and left arm ultracite is fixed. The items does not get rolled, the drops are fixed. 
---
Bobby pins back to 0.1 lb
---
Ore veins secretly nerfed.
---
Bulk scrap not usable. This renders your stash un usable if you try to scrap em all for crafting.
---
People having weight issues across all platforms, max carry weight not registering etc.
---
TSE over nerfed, game turned into a melee slasher after one nerf? It's ridiculous.
---
I played it with 3 others, all over lvl 50. Not one legendary mole miner. I'm going to try once or twice more but I'm not expecting anything more than a few missiles which are useless now too. 
---
I got 5 off mine, just wait a little longer before collecting.
---
So we can wait 6 months to actually see something we want implemented. I won't be playing this dumpster fire by then. I've only got one or two more broken ass patches in me before I quit your shit.
---
Just to further emphasize this point, there’s,
---
like, seven entire people running full blow. explosives build across pc, PS4 and XB1 combined. 
---
The million people on the threads shedding alligator tears for them don’t run explosive builds. They’re resentful because the weapon that saved them needing to play the game (aim, hit shit, manage recoil, work hard and creatively to find ways to raise damage output) just got nerfed. 
---
What a bunch of fucking whiners. This was a great patch. I hope your pets get run over by a car.
---
Something entertaining. 
---
Yep, it no longer recognizes bulked items as useable.
---
So unbulk your stuff.
---
Great patch right?
---
Meanwhile no new content, so you have that benefit :)
---
I hope not. It's awful. 
---
What does it have?
---
It may be that thing that's been going on for a while: some of the materials are in your inventory and some are in your stash, and the game can't figure out how to use both even though it knows you have it. For example, half your aluminum is in your stash, and the other half is in your inventory. Try putting it all in your stash (or inventory if you have to) and see if that helps.
---
I can second HP of mobs regenerating back.
---
Why
---
Sad thing is, these aren't megapatches. For comparison, look at WoW hotfixes: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22824893/hotfixes-january-23-2019 Look at the number of fixes, across all 6 hotfixes they released this month. Compare to what Bethesda released this month. In short, Bethesda's stuff isn't a megapatch. As an example of a megapatch, consider ESO's most recent patch, currently on public test server, this whole thing, many posts, is just patch notes for one of their patches: https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/454456/pts-patch-notes-v4-3-0
---
What Bethesda is doing is releasing tiny, tiny patches very, very slowly. AND they're full of bugs and highly questionable decisions.
---
Overwatch is not a mmo and also its "new content" is skins and a map every few months if your lucky
---
Yep mine is reading 38.93GB on PS4 
---
likely to just roll them back after they get fixed anyway
---
People have horrible hoarding tenancies, im sure you will find 2k unneeded metal in their stash and wonder why they have no room
---
Yeah, it's been a month for me. I killed the Scorthqueen and got the camp items I wanted, there is nothing else in the game.
---
Facts.
---
They better fix this **** lol 
---
I haven’t played since early December. I stopped playing because I’d get headaches after like an hour or two of playing. Only game I’ve ever played that this has happened. The strange part is that I had no issue during the beta. It was only after launch. 
---
But it makes the patch look big
---
Downvoted for calling people out for being as childish as they are. Head to fithy casuals. Its much better there.
---
This is the first and only online game I’ve ever played where the patch notes or incomplete or things are intentionally left out. And I’ve been playing online games since it was possible to play games online.
---
Which one do you want?
---
I agree. You invest your points like anyone else does. Just because their niche build got tweaked doesn't give them the right to claim they deserve a refund. Whether the adjustments were severe or not their build is still viable to a degree it's just not as over powered as it used to be. 
---
I can't thank people who say they will look into something and then never show their face in a topic again. Too many times have they lied about looking into something. P.S. one time is too many, and they've done it more than once.
---
Just from what I’ve read so far I’m thinking FO4 tonight or some other game.   Little nervous about logging in.  Don’t have TSE but had some of the perks active that they nerfed 
---
One hour of playtime.  One fucking hour would have found this issue.  Fuck Bethesda and fuck this game.
---
Try not karma whoring and just put your answer in the one comment
---
That's like complaining to a mechanic about why your car won't move when the radio works perfectly fine.  If the radio works then the rest of the car should work!  The Atom Shop is a simple fucking storefront.  They show you pictures of shit, you click a button to buy said shit, said shit is added to your account.  It's standalone from the ENTIRE rest of the fucking game.
---
Ummm...yeah.  I see ALL that you had to say and then I look at mine.  I'm feeling pretty fn comfortable in my emotional regulation.
---
Agree.  I do think they need help with QA and there are a lot of volunteers willing to help out (and sign a NDA). 
---
It probably needs to be more than a week before for the next couple iterations, lots to clean up :)
---
To be fair, I've gotten far more out of this game than I paid for.  Not complaining, more like really wanting to make FO76 a great game, have the devs add content vs spending time fixing stupid bugs.
---
So that's why the weight loss from the pharmacy perk being fixed did nothing
---
Unyielding left and right arms how much?
---
Oh no, not again...
---
I hope it jingles when you run with it in game, imagine hearing that before being one banged.
---
Exactly. Open that mouth wide for that Bethesda dick lolol. You’ve earned it 😉
---
Yeah, coop is the best part, but the missions are clearly written for single player.
---
I started doing Silos solo at about level 37 with my melee monster in the first week, bugged turrents were the biggest problem.
---
I had to put him down as he was just too boring. I'm running a medic with auto-lasers at the moment.
---
Optimism is a respectable trait, I certainly can't fault you for enjoying something. 😊
---
Jesus. What have we done?
---
Your bulk is not being auto-scraped. 
---
So much salt... So much speculation. Chill out man its fucking .10 lbs. We should shame you on YT for being a little twat.
---
If you're carrying around 1700 pounds of shit, it's a good bet you've been duping...
---
The nerf was necessary but maybe a bit excessive. Certainly excessive for weapons that are explosive but don’t have the legendary effect. I think the problem is that the enemies have too much health. Super mutants could be toned down a bit and maybe the SQB as well a bit, too.
---
Love me some radworms!!!! 
---
Oh. I'm not playing with all these bugs anyway. Waiting for next patch I guess.
---
Just so you’re aware, the talk that this patch rolled back is mostly unsubstantiated rumour, the bobby pin weight reverted but that’s about it.
---
Yeah, sheesh, go for a walk.
---
Dicks are your thing, huh? Want some pics? 
---
Hmmmm...... Curiouser and curiouser
---
Plz grief my camp too, i've been bad.
---
if u spent 110aud on fo76 then thats a mistake, on launch the game was $60aud at jb hi-fi.  
---
As for recommendations, new resident evil, kingdom hearts 3, Path of Exile, Warframe, all really good games
---
Its going to take just as long to grind out those caps now with how limited vendors are...
---
Question from a friend, he can’t take anything out of his stash. Have items been locked if it looks like they’ve been duped?? What if someone has a bunch of bulk resource stacks? They can’t take it out to scrap it now.... probably screwed up a lot of people who wanted to fix their character before this update happened... yay. 
---
Squeaky is just going to keep arguing. Almost everyone bulks materials to save space. Without posts like yours, none of the post patch problems would come to light.  
---
I've killed 2 sbq so far today, I'm still having fun, had to change 0 of my cards (only ever stacked 3 points into 30% damage araprt from demo expert) game is far from fine sure but I really feel people should move on with their lives if it's so unpleasant for them to play, no one is holding a gun to anyones head and forcing them to endure it. 
---
Even more than 4, boy do I love seeing a ton of people just focused on killing things!
---
they nerfed TSE because they were one shotting people in PVP, it needed to be done.
---
I had that with the small water purifier today. Once I clicked it to learn it changed it to known.
---
You will be waiting for a while if you want others to entertain you, they are too busy entertaining themselves, give it a go man, you might like it and start setting time for it instead of killing time. Time should be killing you because you shouldnt have enugh of it.
---
Power Smith lvl 1 is the only perk required.
---
No its fine that a sledge hammer does more damage than a missile launcher. 
---
Id love to have actual rifles and energy weapons be viable in a shooter game instead of having to either spec melee or get a 0.002% chance of a God roll drop weapon to build around. That I can't respec for... Unless I level up 20 more times
---
May have been the 5 that was in there from the last time you played. I did two pickups today and both only gave me 4. Check on your next trip and let me know.
---
That’s not a basic mission and that area of the map spawns higher level enemy’s. You should stick to the forest and toxic valley (N-NW) until level 25-30. 
---
Otherwise you’ll keep finding much higher level enemies. 
---
So your tse is broke and you now have no idea how to play normally.  Do you even know where the weak spots are, or did you just shoot the floor the whole time?
---
Yep. I'm not complaining, particularly. Just stating what I see as a reasonable answer. And yeah, I've gotten my money's worth out of the game so I'm not hating. I wish it had been a better game, but it was good enough to play.
---
Enemies spawn when players enter an area.  Enemy levels are affected by the level of nearby players who triggered the spawning.  If a Lv. 60 was in an area before you, you will see enemies suited for them, not a Lv. 14.  They will stick around for a little while, even if the Lv. 60 leaves.
---
Now, every region of the game has a general cap on the level of enemies in it.  The Forest is particularly low, since it is intended as an incubator for new players.  High-level players can skew things that much.  But as you venture beyond that, especially eastward, you will often face much more difficult foes unless you are the one who spawned them.
---
You should leave a hairbrush in your office mailbox! Maybe even paint it silver?
---
Goddam EVERYTHING. Barn plans. Brick plans. T-45, T-51, T-60 mod plans. I am so broke right now because of Phoenix.
---
So deep. 
---
Cool. Thank you.
---
Thanks, just checked it out in game and added it to the list :)
---
Id rather they release a complete game, and not need to fix it on the fly. Truth is, they can fix all day long, but that doesnt mean jack if people are leaving the game in droves. I had a group of people I played with (all met in game cause I dont have IRL friends with the same system). That group started with 13. We had multiple parties and played together as one party, it was really fun. That group turned to 5 almost over night. Now I'm the only one who even bothers to load in 76 to see whats happening. Everyone of us said the same thing "That games kinda boring now I'd rather play (insert game title)" and this is less than 4 months after release!
---
There's an even more obvious issue with their logic - vast majority of players, on PC at least, is still unable to communicate. Not that many people use mics. Without text chat, even if we wanted to take advantage of another player modding the weapon for us, we can't ask them, because we can't talk to them without a mic. We can only ask players in vicinity, because there's no guild/clan support, no global trade chat, no nothing. They *want* us to be social, but they've not given us the *tools* to be social. 
---
Another problem with their logic, if buying mods from vendors costs so much, we traded one grind (server hopping to have the mats appear) for another grind (farming caps to be able to afford always-available mods). In aggregate, the situation did not alter, and problem was not solved.
---
Either the devs are genuinely dumb, or they're jerking us around on purpose. And I'm not sure which one is worse. 
---
Could of had that card that gives you like 40% evasion when at low health and he just got lucky with it every single time.
---
I'm not a duper. Single player. No mule. Can't fast travel cause of weight and I don't even trade with other players. I only store stuff in my stash and no extra crap in my CAMP. This weight limit means I haven't been able to fast travel for the whole game and trudge everywhere. If you want to make and collect things, it sucks. It more than sucks, it's Bethesda committing suicide. 
---
Lol. I stopped using TSE a while ago. It's all the new bugs and the return of the old ones that made me leave... why so hostile? 
---
I feel like megatron was definately joking
---
NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
---
EVERYONE MUST FIGHT WITH MELEE WEAPONS!!!!!!!!!
---
Bethesda probably.
---
The tricentenial is totally different, its American flag colours, go Google it man, no joke.
---
I mean I said 50-100... It was a general range. What does the bolt action do, like 125?
---
Teslas at least never shoot their electricity arc. Semi auto the tesla rifle worked kinda like a NV grebade launcher with no reload. Auto it is actually pretty good even without my character specing into it.
---
&gt;Put another way, Bethesda dropped item degradation from Skyrim and Fallout 4. Maybe there was a reason for that?
---
Yeah, I mean at least New Vegas and 3 let you repair your weapons with others on the go. In 76, you have to stop and find a bench somewhere.
---
I believe so with the right perks. White Knight reduced repair materials and armor decay.
---
For the record it was actually 350 hours built around my non TS Quad Explosive Radium Rifle....one of only 3 quality 3* legendaries that I got in 350 hours bit of course I spent most of those hours farming materials to mod that rifle with..... hours that I apparently should have spent farming Whitesprings for a better drop. And don't get me started on the 5 levels of Demolition Expert I wasted on that gun.
---
That entirely depends upon the minor changes that are occurring. Updating the level one can purchase Handmade Plans at, for example, is not going to cause nightmares later on.
---
Lol nah. Save them for your boyfriend. But seriously though is it hard to type your poorly thought out responses with that big Bethesda meat in your mouth? Lmfao
---
Oh yeah some events just have high level enemies
---
Overpowered weapons are less op and perks have been adjusted, pretty much just that, the technical side seems pretty stable.
---
I'd rather they go back to being (nearly) weightless, but I only keep about a dozen on me anyway.
---
Watoga had them when I checked today 
---
Yeah, my friends are dropping off 1 by 1.
---
It's not because of bugs.
---
It's not because of nerfs.
---
It's because there is no new CONTENT.  There's nothing to keep them interested and coming back for more.
---
Pretty soon it will be just me playing.  And then I won't be playing.
---
They already know explosive weapons are under performing currently. So if all those players kept the perks they have to swap to later when that adjustment comes, they are already one step ahead of everyone else. That doesn't mean they deserve an entire respec...it rather means now they should probably adapt and learn how to adjust their play style by swapping out perks that don't help them as much as they used to. 
---
Well I still have all my plans...guessing they’re now event/quest rewards since things like the fusion geni can be purchased at vendors 
---
Small subset? Majority of all queen kills I participated in had 4 or 5 melee characters doing chunks of health. The last 3 weeks theres been more ranged for sure, but in my experience 75% of the damage has been done by broken melee. Melee was certainly duped just as much as the TSEs, but remains unbalanced and easy to build ridiculous damage with.
---
Oh okay, probably since I'm down there so rarely. Guess I'm making R&amp;G the new Raider stop on my Vendorbot circuit so I can poke around there more often lol
---
Harder to kill doesn’t equal more fun gameplay. They should buff guns in general and touch melee down a bit.
---
Just proving a point, there are more games out there.  Couldn’t care less about karma 
---
See I was deadset against that. I though, a new character *should* start from scratch. 
---
Then I started a new character and that flew out the window. Nothing like a crappy wooden shack full of Atomic Shop stuff. AS carries over, as it should, but now I feel like the other plans should too. 
---
The set up for max optimal damage would be 
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Twisted Muscles
---
A 2 hander like Grogs Axe with Bloodied and preferable +40% Power Attack Damage
---
5 pieces of armor with Unyielding and +1 Str on it
---
All maxed perks Slugger's, Incisor, Martial Artist, Sneak, Ninja
---
All this and your damage should be teetering on 2K or higher and your sneak attacks absolutely chunk the SBQ, as I've seen a video of a dude who didn't even have unyielding armor on who also didn't have Twisted Muscles with a 1\* Bloodied Grog Axe kill a SBQ pretty much solo in like 10 or so hits (he killed the thing in something like 26 seconds)
---
The higher damage number I wrote was just an indicator of the potential, if you sneak attack your easily looking at 6K damage, you sneak attack critical now that's 18000 damage, and this is before using any chems.
---
Again though TSE was soOoOOoOo OP it needed to be nerfed into the ground to the point that they might as well remove Demolition Expert, Two Shot and Explosive from the game.
---
I think the issue might be that people are either A. Playing melee builds and wondering why their armor is degrading so quickly - OR - B. They don't know how to properly use cover.  Duck behind a wall while enemies are shooting! -OR- C.  They don't know the joy of crippling melee enemies legs.
---
I dunno.  I do non-power armor and I only need to to repair my armor pieces once every week and half or so.  I have a surplus of 146 ballistic fiber the last time I checked and I don't spend much time looting.  (most of my time is spent meat hunting and roaming)
---
Or Battletoads. 
---
Touché! Lol 
---
Definitely.  I just had a 3 scorchbeast fight too.  In addition to that, there was a group of 6 supermutants(one legendary).  Throughout the fight the normal scorched spawned in, around 8 bloated glowing ones, and finally a diseased wendigo.  Went through a bunch of stimpaks and ran out of ammo for my tesla near the end, but it was a tonne of fun.
---
Despite of all the negaitve reviews and bashing, I've actually really enjoyed playing the game up until now, despite the bugs.   
---
Better be a patch to patch this patch soon.   
---
In the mean time, hello ESO my old friend , I've come to play with you again...
---
What happened with ff14? I quit that grind fest a long time ago
---
Thanks, just mentioned on top of the post that some of those bugs are affecting other platforms :)
---
I just don't understand why they didn't make the explosive perk and two shot perk not be able to proc with each other. Then you could either have a cool explosive gun or a damaging 2 shot.
---
I have a two shot combat rifle that was in no way over powered even before the Nerf, I can't wait to see what it looks like now.
---
I just cant justify spending 12 bucks on that, I know it was free 12 bucks but 12 bucks is 12 bucks, free or not, only things in the atomic store that are actually worth it is the cowboy hat, pirate hat, the succulents and some camera poses. I bought em all. 
---
You are an entitled little turd. A drop in the bucket. You whining about a video game means nothing. You're just showing how much of an asshat you are. Way to go. 
---
the 10mm smg
---
We may still see their armor without insignia at some point, 11th cavalry regiment riot armor is pre- war. 
---
This isn’t a dig at you - I don’t see it as a astute observation to describe a player who bought an item with RL$ as deranged. Maybe it’s a kid, maybe it’s a grown person. Either way it’s just a way to bypass video game grind. I think it’s easy to understand for anyone who works full time to see how some games increase the grind to a level where gameplay isn’t even fun anymore. You know, when playing the game starts to feel like a second job. Sort of like Destiny.
---
Yea, like I have a life to live outside this game, ive had my 2 months of basement dwelling my holidays are coming to a close. I cant afford to spend more hours completely changing my build and obtaining new equipment. I was hoping i could just hop on this game every now and then with op equipment and have fun, but looks like thats not going to be possible, strongly considering quitting this game tbh. If bethesda wants to create a game where the grind is endless  empty and when something is op its nerfed into the ground its not worth my time at all.

&gt; [BUG] Cannot craft from bulked junk items (post-patch 29/01/19)
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; When in a crafting station, bulked junk items don't show up in the amount of materials you have available.
---
&gt; The only way to unlock those materials is to scrap the bulk items.
---
&gt;[BUG] Known plans not showing as 'known' (post-patch 29/01/19)
---
&gt;I had a couple of plans that showed as 'not known'with one of the vendors, so I bought them.
---
&gt;Upon eating / learning them, I got a prompt saying: 'You already know this plan' or something similar.
---
&gt;I was still able to consume the plans. I knew for 100% sure I already owned one of them, but just gave it a go anyway. It was the 'small water purifier'.
---
Same issues on One X.
---
How much jet pack?
---
I mean, my Quad Explosive Harpoon Gun still does 765 damage.  My health is kinda low and I have Adrenal Rush, but still, it's a little higher than 280.
---
you likely had one of the wonky "RNG Seeds" I've been trying to prove/disprove.
---
Have friends who would loot multiple TSE's per WhiteSprings runs, or would find the 'Shocks, Jetpack and Targeting HUD for their X-01 in a dozen server hops, while everyone else does it for hours, or days, to get the same.
---
The weapons are rubbish in this game.  The carry, damage and Weapons Perks are completely fake and do absolutely nothing.  All that is is a con.  I just had to shoot a super-mutant about 30 times to kill him with a 76 point sniper rifle at point blank range. He killed me twice and I'm in T-60 armour. This game is being more f'd-up every patch. 
---
I tried at least, can you say the same?
---
Played for two hours today and it feels like it did Sunday when I played for several hours. 
---
But yeah, everything is on fire apparently. 
---
You have to sacrifice all your armor for the garb.  With atom shop shroud you get to equip your armor underneath.  Providing a game play advantage over somebody that didn't pay for it in the store.
---
Yeah you have to have someone open the door for you to complete. Only work around available atm unfortunately. 
---
Not worth the effort
---
If you’re on PS4 I might have a spare one I’ll sell cheap. I’ve got so many basic plans that I don’t know what to do with. 
---
Sure. IGN is Fun184. 3k sounds good to you?
---
i just wanna a refund i don't to do anything this this game anymore
---
On the flip side...
---
I can now tell which of my "Power Armor Chassis" is my T-60, because it too has an Atom Shop icon next to it. 😋
---
Bethesda had promised a respec system and for a while everyone expected it to be some sort of system where you pay caps. No one knew this was going to be the system they used. Why is this subreddit to hellbent on punishing people who just play the game?
---
No new content.
---
No new fun.
---
Friends leave.
---
They recommend that people don't buy.
---
Word gets out, people stop buying.
---
Game eventually dies.
---
None of that cycle has anything to do with bugs or nerfs.  Players will weather that storm if the game is still fun, interesting, and there are new things to see and do.
---
This update actually made me quit.. interesting
---
Yeah what happens if they don't have viable alternatives to swap to? Should they just not play the game until Bethesda bothers to refix what they just made even worse? 
---
I guess you sounded like the "i want my tse to carry me everywhere" type. The game does have a very in depth boost/counter system no one uses because tse did everything. Using the right weapon in the right situation ftw
---
Stockholm syndrome yo.
---
I'm out. 
---
Yes the guy is delusional, all mats needs to be bulked because of the space it takes if not bulked ie; 150 aluminium scrap vs 15 bulk alu there is 7lb weight difference.. and that's fken aluminium :D I could never scrap my bulked junk and put em back to my stash.
---
Pins back to 0.1 lb.
---
Weight issues across all platforms, ppl not getting their carry weight registered correctly.
---
TSE over nerfed, they even nerfed the original demo card :D which means the normal explo weapons are rendered un usable, even pre patch they were weak, now they nerfed the only card that saved those weapons before(missile launchers, AGL, m79 etc..)
---
Your safe space is calling...
---
Hey man they made it blue AND yellow. 
---
what plan?
---
Anybody find Supersledge, sledgehammer and greataxe plan
---
Buff the explosive guns, and don’t absolutely tank the guns. Natural Explosive guns were definitely not very viable pre patch
---
Haha
---
Seriously.  I went through a massive purge and constantly have like 100lbs to play with.  
---
So you quit yet you are still here... That's interesting. Ok
---
yeah thats good
---
What's your PSN?
---
Oh wow yeah that's a big drop.
---
It does highlight how crazy 5pts + tse = 300% more damage.
---
I think they've been spoiled by decades of other people fixing things for them.
---
It has every t45 51 60 mods
---
I hope you’re right for a lot of people’s sakes, I really enjoy the game I found the daily cap/ammo run fun, earn your way to crush lots of events but when it takes more time/resources to have fun (with its very limited events) there’s just no point to the game I’ve tried a second character but there’s no joy in repeating the same shit over with its 1 dimension “story” 
---
then post your answer in the one comment lol
---
He was sad because he made an explosives build and then patch 5.
---
There's definitely something wrong with your build.  I one shot snipe level 68 supermutant warlords, and I only have the first level of each of the damage perks and tank killer(part way through switching over from a melee build).
---
I'm using an anti-armor gauss rifle.  My two-shot gauss rifle still normally one shots them too.
---
"It ain't that bad!" I say as I check reddit while waiting to fast travel to my house.
---
Then I look up after a minute and realize the game is frozen... again.
---
\+karma
---
Ya I’m not sure if it was on purpose or not 
---
Yeah. Just for some reason the scout armor is above it. Just a glitch? Or is scout armor like that?
---
&gt; Phoenix 
---
he's always been a badass. too busy kicking robo ass to trade with you most of the time
---
She gets a pretty significant health and damage resistance boost for every player in the event. It's why everyone got pissed off at lowbies who took one shot and hid in the garage. It's a pretty big boost too
---
Uranium Fever sucks for higher level players.
---
Everything is scaled below max level.
---
None of the legendaries you get are worth using if you like to min / max.
---
I traded my arm, a leg, and my left ball for the Raider Shielded Plan.
---
Now I don't do Uranium Fever any more.
---
They didn’t need lower the amount of damage output by tse AND lessen the buff of demo expert. I’m fine with a nerf, but they nerfed it to the ground. Fighting a level 68 Mr Gutsy doesn’t need to be as much of a chore as they just made it be. There is a middle ground but fighting enemies by button mashing is not fun. 
---
Yes. The issue here is that unbulked weighs a little more and a lot of people are used to bulking items. It's a time waste and uses up more of our precious stash space.
---
I did this recently. I love 76, but my god is it broken and being handled by idiots. At least on 4 I can install mods to fix issues.
---
We're fully aware of that. And in fact there are plenty of other systems in the game that otherwise work. The complaint isn't "oh the radio works so the EGR valve shouldn't be faulty", it's "I see that you put zero time and effort into actually building a car that actually runs but your sales lobby sure is nice with this marble flooring". 
---
Had that happen to me in watoga medical center. But I assumed the drops were garbage anyhow 
---
I had to destroy all my bulk just to get my junk to register
---
I have a feeling, that you will be first one to preorder starfield and tes6. So i kinda don't believe you.
---
It's 60 hp for a full team. Which is worth 12 Endurance points and it's 15 hp more than the Endurance capstone, Lifegiver, while costing zero SPECIAL investment.
---
What's to stop next week from being 10% damage per Nuka-Cola skin on the team, or 5% less damage taken for every Vault-Tec skin on the team? It's a slippery precedent that they are setting. 
---
Handmade is my go-to for all the things because the fire rate, recoil, and drum mag are great. And my TSE doesn't blow me up anymore, so I guess every cloud has a silver lining...?
---
Yes and no. It doesn't scale with guns, like melee, but you need 9 to use the 3 shotgun damage perks so it does.
---
My argument for why melee is a bit OP is that with all rise, a weapon everyone can get relatively easy, I was able to 1 or 2 shot pretty much everything with a pretty crappy build.
---
They dont even need to do that.  They need to change the server types to somthing like ARK/Conan exile where everything is permanaent and you always load onto the same server and give a mod tool kit.  Game would be fixed by modders inside of a month.
---
I have a tse sniper rifle something or other. It has a scorched modifier on it as well.
---
Uses to do something like 230 damage, now its 72. 
---
It used to take two shots to kill a level 68 scorched, it now takes about 5 to kill a level 23. 
---
Agreed. But like i said in other threads - a lot of the TSE nerfs was because people here on reddit championed it so much. I even made a thread that said we should buff other weapons instead, but got flamed pretty bad for it. Apparently buffing other weapons would create an "arms race" according to some user.
---
Guess we'll just all go back to melee and using fire axe.
---
I give my extras to noobies.
---
Hate that it reverted to .1 pounds though.  Just adds weight for no reason.
---
They already have lmao.  Bobby pin weight is back, dupe glitches and damage bug.
---
No, Bethesda, get down from the counter! Bad kitty! No!
---
Kinda, yeah. 
---
Just give the game to zenimax to redeem and patch. They turned around eso massively and that's honestly the same treatment this game needs. They also have the most experience with online games due to 5 years of eso. At the very least they could bring over the director that revamped eso to fo76 and take Todd off of it for now. Todd is sinking the crap out of this game. Theres more focus on the atom shop and pvp then the dang pve that the majority of players are actually in. We all know the pve content they have coming in march will just be more throw away events and a vault that takes 12 minutes to clear...
---
apparently there is a way to go around getting a refund even after said amount of hours. im waiting for a ban lift too and have been considering a refund aswell
---
I don't want to seem like a buzzkill because I agree with you entirely. However I do believe item degradation existed in skyrim, as over time items would lose armor rating or damage rating, then allowing you to upgrade them further. 
---
What shareholder would approve that plan? "Hey, lets make a game and make it shit so this other game we secretly invested in somehow makes more money, oh and this is totally not insider trading btw"
---
&gt; balanced for PVP.
---
Does Bethesda know there's little-to-no PvP in this game? Lol i've played so so long now, i rarely encounter any sort of PvP. And even if it does happen, it's fucking stupid due to all the weird little quirks with pvp.
---
P2W against who? Scorchbeasts? No one PVPs in this game except to blow up people’s camps. And yeah the scorch beasts are so goddamn annoying that no wonder people want the best weapons. Otherwise the experience of fighting them is beyond painful 
---
In the meantime, try a gauss rifle instead.  I'm oneshotting level 68 super mutants, and I've only got 1 level of each rifle damage perk and tankbuster.  One of my gauss is anti-armor, the other is two-shot.  They both still oneshot the top level supermutants post nerf.
---
Oh yeah, you're hungry for some eggplant. Here ya go, bud, enjoy: https://imgur.com/a/jU4q5y7

Hiring?
---
I really wish Barn walls had better/more cozy looking windows
---
TSE lever action 418 damage
---
Down to 178
---
I found em at the bos vendor for 1700 ish caps
---
Some people are saying she scales with weapon damage and not the amount of people so this might help a little. Haven't been able to try it out yet so we'll see.
---
"why are so many apologists going through and downvoting ANY criticisms people have?"
---
Maaaaaybe... just hear me out now... people are just tired of all the repeated complaints and bitching and whining. There have been literally hundreds of complaint posts today just addressing the TSE nerf and the bulk item bugs. Some people would like to come on reddit and read productive, interesting discussions instead of seeing a non-stop bitchfest.
---
Plus, when people don't voice their complaints politely and instead go, "Fuck Bethesda fuck this game you are all fucking fuckers you fucks," maybe just maybe people are downvoting you for being a jerk, not for making criticisms. 
---
Stop defending this bullshit dude. Seriously bethesda obviously aint listening to the people who paid for this game.
---
Actually, hate to break the news to you cause I wish you were right, but they admitted they're pushing the march content (which they never even said what it could be) back in favor of bug fixes. And I don't know about you, but if I put down a game from boredom its rare I pick it back up for a very long time, if at all.
---
Agreed I have quit as well. Fuck bethesda ill take my money for cosmetics and spend it in another game. 
---
I’ve only destroyed my steel and lead bulk for making bullets. Annoying af
---
I built my camp in the forest to avoid high level attacks from super mutants. The worst I get is a level 3 ghoul. I have 0 turrets.
---
Your post seems like an overreaction, then?
---
Did it solo before going to work and got two 3\* moles and one 1\* mole. Always thought missiles were useless as 40mm GMG can put out way higher DPS, even after the nerf.
---
Well my Robot Chest never had a Dense Lining but i can stop looking now. The handmades accuracy in hipfire w/ hardened receiver is kind of shit, ghouls will charge me and i fire and miss 5 times before i finally hit them once and they die
---
Only middle one works atm.
---
There is more to the world besides fallout and minecraft dude.
---
I dont have a problem with the way i can relocate my S.P.E.C.I.A.L, and i prefer this way bc i had experimented on countless of other char to understand what works and doesnt for my class/immersive playstyle. 
---
Everyone has their opinnion and it cant harm anyone unless everyone allows it to. I'd much rather the devs to fix bugs first; then, introduce new concepts, art, weapons, craftable mods, furniture, enemies, bosses, etc into the game.
---
Fix one thing, f**k up another
---
You are exactly right. The patch seemed really nice on paper. Now logging on you can see how many things are broken.
---
Even these major YouTubers have it wrong at the moment. JUICEHEAD in example says how frigging good the patch is, which just goes to show that the guy doesn't even play the game. Has probably some 3 patches old gameplay on the background and haven't even opened the game in reality.
---
The game turned into a melee slasher after one patch :D I have never seen this hard nerf to anything in any title I have played. Ridiculous nerf. 
---
FTR..no crap was exposed except in your mind that didn't process this correctly.  So sorry if I responded in the vein of consoles after you said mods. Omg.  Bottom line is I invested a shitload of hours in a game that quickly went to 1fps shit.  It was supposedly patched. I started over.  Invested another shitload of hours.  Back to 1fps.  If I recall correctly the only way I could continue after the "no it's really going to be fixed with this patch" fix was to start over again.  Many playing 76 have no clue about that debacle.  My grand point being that once again Bethesda dropped the ball hard.  As far as backtracking...meh
---
boredom.  that about sums it up for me too.  i played a melee character to level 120.  started a new one cause all i was doing was taking a workshop or two, setup resources, go shoot enemies at west tek or whitesprings, return with loot, go to workshops, collect resources, go to CAMP, craft..........repeat AD NAUSEUM!!
---
now i am playing a level 34 charisma character, and already i am getting bored.
---
the only thing really bothering me is that the game still crashes during fast travel, during load in, during a fight, hell the game some times just says, "screw you, i am disconnecting the server so you lose 2 hours of work."  doing events is boring as the rewards tend to be useless.  once in a blue moon i get some thing i need.
---
i too literally run around looking for people to join.  more often than not though, i find some one who is just as bored with the game as i am, and has turned to wrecking CAMPs and just killing other players for the helluvit.  because, THAT IS ALL THERE IS TO DO.
---
i bought this game dec. 1st.  been rolling with the punches ever since.  i gave the game the benefit of the doubt, being a diehard fallout fan from the start, but Beth......you REALLY screwed the pooch on this one.  makes me think this is your 1st multiplayer online game.  are they seriously going to once again, rely on modders, to fix up what should have been in the final product.
---
for now, i guess i will just wait till closed beta opens up for MW5 mercs.  already prepurchased it.  will still login to fo76 and fiddle with workshops, but i will not spend any more money on a broken game.  will NOT advise friends to buy the game.
---
what Beth should have done, much like PGI did with mechwarrior 5 mercenaries, is come out and say, "we fucked up.  product is not ready for general play.  we have decided that instead of putting out an inferior product, we are delaying the release until aug 2019."
---
look around you Beth, you are being left to rot in the wake of other game companies that are putting out better products, or in lieu of that, delayed the product until it was spit shined.  what you gave us was an old skeleton, that you tried to doctor up and make look like a semblance of a human being.
---
Ill bet my life thats a lie.  Youll line up and preorder their next release just like the rest.
---
If the world ended. We would be dead. We’re rebuilding.
---
This!  I feel bad for anyone that grinds out the hours to re-spec into melee. Grinding for hours just to wake up one day and discover your build is now garbage with no way to change it besides spending days rebuilding from the ground up is a whole new level of frustrating.
---
In really bummed. I missed out on getting a TSE before they got banned. Now I've been scouring the Fallout 76 community on ps4 for a 2000 cap deal.
---
It would be nice if the Scorched Beast AI was fixed, as on several occasions they outright refused to land anywhere ever before I was finally able to shoot it down, and also sometimes they just spam a seemingly infinite barrage of sonic blasts that literally make the entire screen not visible.
---
Up and downvotes are systematically generated to obscure the true vote tallies. This is true for all posts on all sub-reddits
---
&gt;Yes, but no one is going to buy them for 14k caps from a vendor. People are going to buy the ones that drop from SBQ for ~8-10k or so instead, so there will still be a market for them.
---
you misunderstand, it'll totally encourage player interaction. Instead of buying the plans you can just find someone with the recipe and buy serum from them, and you can craft the things you've learned and sell them to other people. 
---
Oh, wait, they haven't given us any in game mechanism to find out who has what, so unless you spam reddit with tags offers you won't know where to look. 
---
Seriously, who the fuck is making decisions at BGS right now? 
---
So are we sure the build was rolled back or are those assumptions according to Bobby pins weight change?
---
I didn't see anything else being changed.
---
What if Bobby pins were unintentional reduced last patch and they fixed them?
---
My worst bug this patch introduced is that now when you craft no bulk items are being used anymore.

What can I say, I don't take videogames as seriously as some around here.
---
This is called power creep. 
---
I'm down by about 3/5. Not too thrilled, but at least I can't blow myself to kingdom come anymore!
---
I feel like the dr has to change otherwise me emptying 32 rounds of explosive shotgun into her would show some movement if even just a little. Some people are telling me that she scales with weapon damage though so maybe bethesda answered me unintentionally.
---
Really? I've one shot with a sneak attack crit from a tse dragon. I also killed one from pretty much full hp (fine maybe like 95%) after it landed with a suppressed tse pump action. 
---
Yes please.
---
I'd love to be able to transfer items between characters.
---
Just hopped back on my ranged guy the other day to transfer caps.
---
Realized that he's still wearing non-legendary armor pieces at level 130.  I've dumped legendary items I could've used on that character just because it's such a pain in the ass to transfer.
---
You'll bet your life huh?  Move along fool face 😐
---
I did quit. But the dumpster fire nature of the whole thing and copious amounts of butthurt preaching keep me subscribed to this sub... Because  I find it all kind of  interesting and slightly amusing for sure!
---
Sadness. I'll have to check the trash cans when I play later, curious if those have a limit now too
---
agreed. A change of guard is needed for sure. When you have a title (let alone a live service title) that rolls backwards instead of forward, then you know you have a major issue and need to take a step back.
---
Why are you guys posting such dishonest stuff? You can't shoot at the ground to kill stuff anymore, but my TSE double barrel does 415 and one hits the scorched, super mutants, and protectrons in Watoga
---
Maybe if things are so bullet sponge then maybe the problem is design more than anything else?
---
I try to keep everything bulked at all times. It makes it super easy to just grab things at vendors to sell, and to keep a better inventory mentally of what I have and dont have. 
---
This new bug/feature is awful. It serves no purpose. 
---
I havent tested yet but I'm going to assume that we wont be able to fix things on the map unless we have loose scrap in stash. Like missile turrets in the cranberry bog, or how do workbenches work when you're exploring and need to repair a weapon or armor but all of your materials are bulked in your stash and theres no stash box near by?
---
That's literally the problem, yes. Magically turning 1 bullet into 2 bullets makes as little sense as an explosive flamer. Less, really, when you remember that flamers are actively using combustion. And given how plasma weapons work in fallout, it doesn't really make any sense to exclude them.
---
Imma take a guess and say your friends are high lvl, did everything and nuke whitesprings on a basis. Y’all just burned out. Nothing wrong with that. However I agree this game needs more content soon. The bug fixes are a good start but charging 5k caps for PA plans is outrageous. 
---
Take option 4 and use this as an opportunity to dive into a different franchise, new setting or even a new genre entirely. If you’re looking for advice on how to keep all your eggs in one basket you should probably consider moving some of them. You say Fallout and Minecraft are the only games you have played consistently, what made you drop other games you have tried?
---
It's the genre I enjoy. I have tried other games and didnt like them. Fallout and minecraft just got it right for me. Not everyone likes what I like and I'm cool with that. 
---
Honestly it's probably for the best.
---
Found a dead body with a nuka world shirt on it. 
---
^ This one. There are two points you can wire it to which causes the behavior of the door to change (if it stays open all the time or if it is just timed).
---
Mysterious Savior doesn't seem to appear on the other person's end. You won't do the death animation. There also isn't any animation for the autostim gear that might've kept that player alive.
---
Probably some combination. Lone Wanderer, Adrenal Reaction, and Serendipity (not counting sentinel, assassin, chems, etc) make PVP silly.
---
Rubberbanding health happens a lot against players.
---
Vendors are not the only source of caps.  Most things drop caps pretty often, some lore than others but it adds up.  Also cap stash’s will now be more consistent since they are containers and can be searched with perks.  Finally events and dailies also award caps (gain some more than others).  In aggregate it adds up if you are out doing things plus 1400 from vendors a day means you can pretty much expect ~2k per day for a few hours of play time if you focus things correctly.  
---
New content:
---
Your old gun sucks. Grind for a new weapon and restructure your perks.
---
So, I'm kind of new to the challenges as I'd been ignoring them before last week.  
---
Just now, I picked 37 bloodleaf.  The Weekly challenge still indicates 0/10 bloodleaf.  
---
About halfway through my gathering, I got out of my power armor thinking that might somehow be the bug.  Nope, that didn't make a difference.
---
I've also picked a couple dozen Rhododendron, and a couple dozen Soot Flowers...and just have credit for 1 Soot Flower.  
---
Goodness, it's really confusing.  
---
I'm also struggling with the Take Photos at Red Rocket challenge.  Some locations just don't want to register.  
---
We may need to form a support group on these things...
---
I 100% agree!  You put my feelings into words.  I just don’t have a reason to play anymore...
---
There's always suicide. 
---
You talking about a valley piece?
---
I have been forced to stop playing this game because I'm on a quest that crashes every time I load into a quest. It's pathetic. 
---
I've only participated in Scorched Earth about a dozen times, and granted, that's mostly been in the last 3 weeks.  Usually, it's me and my tiny knife, and a couple others with a Super Sledge.  Everyone else tends to be permanently camped out on top of the the Drop Site or similar high ground with TSEs or heavy weapons.  In the time it takes for me to close on an enemy to stab it, it's usually already dead thanks to explosive guns.
---
I just drop a bag when people need it.
---
I've had problems in the past with people using up 100% of a resource and not going out to farm more.
---
I'm generous, but when you use up 100% of the steel to make bullets and leave me 0 steel to repair my weapons and armor, no thanks....lol
---
The best thing about 4 is mods. Chances are something you don’t like has a mod to fix it. Don’t wanna grind for recourses? There’s a mod for that.
---
Not being able to use bulked crap for anything is COMPLETELY unacceptable. You can’t even used bulked plastic to scrap!
---
Super annoying. I hope it wasn't an intended feature
---
I've got 300+ hours and I have non legendary weapons that are viable without perks allocated to redefine their capabilities. So to say they have nothing else to swap to is a sad excuse to anyone who plays this game. Maybe they scrapped all the other guns but that's their fault not Bethesda's. In the time they played they obtained a weapons crafting station. All players level 1-infinity have access to basic weapons for this very purpose. If worse comes to worse they can craft a level whatever they are pipe gun and use that only requiring a bare minimum of common resources to craft and repair. They can use that til they either get better drops of a different weapon, or they can keep crying they're not as strong as they used to be til the update comes to address explosive weapons. 
---
But you Aren’t. Levels are supposed to be meaningless after 50. This game is not WoW
---
any word yet? also waiting on ban appeal
---
Same here. The only thing I can think of is that they don’t have any sort of version controls, which is inexcusable in 2019. Even if it’s just a git tracking the files and directories. Come on.
---
Thatz fucking lame 😭 no wonder I stopped playing the game 😂 jk. But that sucks
---
Your field tests suck then because my field tests in Watoga don't show a single difference from pre-nerf. Are you shooting the ground like before? You have to connect now
---
Username is Slayden10 I’m on rn ready to go
---
Oh 100% agreed.  Do people really think that when a shitty game comes out that their testers didnt tell them so.  They did and were ignored.
---
As someone who had to server hop about 250 times to get 2x calibrated shocks, I'm fine with higher prices, but these prices require 5ish days of farming caps from vendors to pay for a mod. Cut the price in half and it's a reasonable price.
---
10 years?! Fuck it. Have some gold. 
---
Iv just been playing on my wife’s account collecting stuff for when I get mine back  
---
It usually isn’t nasally teens unless you are delving into the ‘literally who?’ depths of page 10+ on YouTube.
---
I look forward to finding the hidden bugs from the fixes they implemented. It my favourite thing to do in my free time.
---
I really enjoy being disconnected every 20 minutes, to the point that if I don't disconnect  (lol, as if) I just close the game every 20 minutes so I really get that FO76 feel.
---
I love Bethesda but unless they're going to let Zen online make the game they should stick with single player, where the mod community can fix the game.
---
What are you crazy? That thing is so OP it's actually possible to kill ghouls with it. The Gamma Gun is much more reasonable and balanced healing ghouls like all weapons should.
---
Lol you don't wanna see mine...
---
I won’t follow the link, but if it’s your dick, I’m sure it’s more like a peanut lmfao. What’s got your gay-o-meter through the roof to such a degree that you’re linking dick pics? A side effect from fellating Bethesda so much? 🤔 lolol

"Sorry your entire build sucks now, that sucks for you!" This kind of attitude will push people away from the game, many MMO games refund skill points when skills change, it's common practice. 
---
  Ah the old slippery slope fallacy
---
I also quit
---
Seems obvious to me someone somewhere in charge of this game at a high level doesn't actually play it enough, nor do they have any relation to how most of the player base feels.  What people want with this game isn't too hard to figure out to my eyes.  Maybe it's a case of left hand / right hand discoordination.  But we're months into the game now, and we should be seeing more movement on more of the issues the player base really cares about.
---
If it's not OP, it's literally unplayable /signed, sniveling redditor
---
Not good hey

How long will u be on for?

Gotta nerf TSE first so everything becomes more grindy

Jesus Christ.

So you didn’t play Fallout 3 then? You know the game that rebooted the series, developed by Bethesda, which had item degradation... NV is just a reskinned Fallout 3, set in Mojave. It’s literally all the same mechanics developed by Bethesda. Jesus dude at least research before you embarrass yourself next time. A basic google search would’ve shown you that.
---
OP is right that nearly every Bethesda game other than Skyrim and Fallout 4 had item degradation.

Buff LMGs. They did a great job adding them into the game, now let them be useable!

I don't really get it. Are you saying that PvE is too difficult now? What build were you playing?

Don't lie, you looked
---
Roger that

---
You're being pretty dramatic. From what I've seen, TSE Nerf just brought players from godlike down to normal.
---
What kind of results are you looking for post-nerf?
---
Have you tried heading to west Tek and grabbing a super sledge until you "fix" your build?
---
It is a real shame this game was rushed out the door and didn't do a proper closed beta test for 3 - 6 months prior to release.  This could have been a great online game if a tried-and-true process were followed.  I am at the point to where I am just not willing to wait around for all of the problems to be fixed and some real, meaningful end-game content to be added.
---
There is absolutely no excuse for Bethesda because Ubisoft fucked up in the exact same way - cheating and lack of end-game killed The Division so Bethesda should have seen this coming.
---
30-45 min? That aight?
---
No, the cap limit is there to give Bethesda time to catch dupers before they have enough time to amass enough caps to damage the economy. The way it is now you may not get thousands of caps every day, but at least we know the economy couldnt be destroyed in a single day by a single duper.
---
People need to think about these things before complaining. It's pretty clear from a lot of the comments here that people are being played by the dupers who feign ignorance and innocence. The term "useful idiots" comes to mind.
---
It's when someone ends their own life. 
---
Ok just stop playing and move on your stressing yourself out 
---
I really did stop today. Not counting the over nerfing of explosive weapons the game is unplayable.
---
lol who paid full price for this game :o
---
The only explosive I've ever owned was a Cryolater...It's more to the point that they changed the perk to a significant degree.
---
No it's like saying "You changed how my skills work WHILE I WAS USING THEM, I'd like to exchange them because they don't work the way they used to."
---
That's common practice for MMOs.
---
Yah I think I can make it before u log out. I'm UnicornQueen971
---
Melee doesn't need a buff. It's already strong enough. I'd say 50% of the complaints I see about tse's are that even a monkey could run them since it involves very little creative thinking for perk cards.  All rise, a weapon everyone gets, is one of the best weapons in the game. My beginner melee build (what I used around level 50) was able to 1 or 2 shot all regular mobs or other players.
---
How many days has that been 30+?  I remember hearing about the bug at some point but can't really remember how long it's been.
---
Seems Kinda entitled tbh

but i've got a few hundred already compiled....

---
  It is not nerfing everything the same degree, it is tuning them to balance.  There is no need for "godroll" items if the desire is a game with decent balance.
---
Well... shit. 
---
Good to know.
---
It sounds like the old version of the game partially reintroduced in this patch might have rebroken the PA weight bonuses. I don't know that to be true, but it seems likely because that has happened to many things and this sounds like the old bug.
---
You joking right? The bobby pin weight reduction were in the last patch notes. This is just gross incompetence.
---
Oh wow you’re so amazing tell us more about how amazing you are

Ping a guy in the skull with your epic sniper from five thousand feet, it does nothing.

Wait several minutes for him to jog up to you with his supersledge so he can tag you back to begin PvP.

FLAWLESS AND ENGAGING, FUN, PVP GAMEPLAY!
---
i understand the reason for the TSE nerf, 1 shotting a group of lvl 68 ghouls in whitesprings was over powered by a large degree. the across the board nerf to everything altogether i really feel for those people already buit or building to grenades and missiles, it pretty much made ineffective weapons completely useless.  
---
I had been noticing or I should say paying more attention to my damage output since getting a TSE combat shotgun, perk build I had put me at 1025 damage per shot (also lvl 192), could 1 shot most lvl 68 ws ghouls, 2 or 3 shot scorch beasts if in range close enough for a tight spread but far enough to not blow myself up. I had also been noticing during queen fights my shotgun was completely useless on the queen my shots never moved her health bar, I would have to switch to my Two Shot handmade to see myself move the health bar. So, I would tag the queen with my handmade for a few shots, switch to my shotgun to work crowd control to keep mobs off other players, then switch back to handmade and shoot queen a few more times. rinse and repeat. I fell into the role of being crowd control and let the melee handle the queen. which i was perfectly fine with.  
---
today after patch I sign on go to check vendors and plans to see the new changes. I land in Watoga do a few test shots on lvl 50 bots and seeing I have went from 1 shot to 2-3 shots a kill, Alright somewhat manageable since my damage is listed at 250ish it was expected. What I did not expect was I found the robots fighting a lvl 50 scorchbeast back by the dinner, i run down and get involved with the fight since the SB has killed most of the bots with the exception of 2 (one was crawling on the ground), it was still about 98% health. I jump on the bus, fire at it a few times and hear the bloop of a hit notice no damage taken and tag it a few more times, no damage, but i do have its attention now and it comes in for a landing. it lands between the bus i am on and the diner and then backs up and essentially gets stuck.. Now i am sitting on the end of this bus having a stare down with a lvl 50 98% health SB at basically 20' range. i kneel, sight in (both theoretically increase my damage and distance to hit / tighter spread pattern.. pull trigger, hear the hit bloop/bloosh/plunk whatever the sound is (if yall have a better description lemme know) no damage. quick fire 6 shots.. no damage.. think glitch? reload.. fire all 12 rnds i have access to, nothing, SB just standing there looking at me.. hmm switch to handmade, two shot (no explosive), 2 star with other being +10% damage when sighted. pull trigger.. bloop.. damage taken.. empty 35 round clip takes maybe 1/4th its hp bar.. reload.. we stare at each other for a few seconds.. switch back to TSE shotgun fire off all 12 rounds.. no damage.. we stare at each other and i could swear he smirked.. switched back to my handemade emptied about 2 or 3 more clips into the lvl 50 SB..  
---
This told me two things today, I am going to have to double maybe even triple my farm time for ammo. I would usually go through about 600 rounds of shotgun shells, and maybe 1200 or so 5.56 rounds a SBQ fight, and 2-300 ss, 4-500 5.56 in whitesprings. so going by my experiences so far mean 1800ish shells and 3600 5.56 needed for a SBQ battle. I already knew my TSE didnt work against the queen, but with the TS getting a damage output reduction as well likely means i wont see any damage done on my end, that i would notice anyways.  
---
that all being said you throw in this white knight changes, and increase in crafting materials, ive gone from 1 to 2 days farming for 4 or 5 days of play, to solid 3 days maybe 4 of farming for 1 or 2 days of playing. i understand this is a survival type game. but between these nerfs, now increasing the dull monotonous task of farming supplies while drinking a gallon of water and eating every game hour (swear if i ate and drink like my character id be stuck on a toilet all day as everything coming in ran right back out, and id be like 900lbs). now increasing armor brittleness and required materials i will go from repair once a week to 2 or 3 times a week this is no longer Fallout 76, but Farmville 76.
---
I have done the touring vendors alot selling everything I can. My problem with this is I already have a job. I want to play. Do the fun things, no work.  
---
This game is feeling like a chore. :(
---
The next following patch: Pinhead perk card will be reduced to 20/40/60% to standardize with other perks
---
I work for a company that makes software that is technically deep and uses machine leanring, big data clusters and hundreds of servers to come to fruition... our coders code... they do not run the department or the team. They focus on what they are skilled at. If Bethesda is putting coders in positions to run the team and not focus on the dev process, then they are more stupid than I thought... 
---
Nah I only noticed it from the first Jan patch. 
---
I haven't tried fast traveling there in my PA since this patch but I'll try tomorrow. 
---
Don’t you still have to do the glassed cavern mission to open up that area with the computer your speaking of? 
---
dunno about other vendors but grahm has it, and the super sledge usually.
---
 I think they approached it wrong by only tackling one thing and shifting unbalance.  
---
After this last update I really want my money back now haha its garbage 
---
Non Auto rifleman 9 points with explosive perk 5 points.  The damage reduction was so massive that I'm having issues killing lvl 20 plus mobs now, and I am using a massive amount of ammo to do it now.
---
loneliness!!  lol.  bravo!!  exactly how i feel too.
---
Just message me on here when you hop on

They updated the patch notes, conveniently, armor mods are not part of the equation [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al0bl3/fallout_76_patch_notes_january_29_2019/efa2v54?utm_source=reddit-android)

/u/Pitchforkemporium should make his way down here. He could make a killing. Between the haters and fans who are just pissed. 
---
I just bought the t-51 shock plans for 600(?)The other night and I’m glad that I did. Thousands for plans? Jesus Christ. And there’s zero chance of finding them at random. Will Grahm sell them for cheaper? 
---
This happened to me the other day, I though it was part of a quest I was on from the white springs bunker. I panicked when I was wanted, disconnected and started a new character. Went back to that character a week later, still wanted and got killed within about 2 minutes of sitting The train station waiting for someone to kill me. After that, I realized I overreacted a bit. 
---
THANK YOU. Melee build take no skill just button mashing and now they are op. I don’t want to pvp with hammers I want shotguns and rifles. 
---
It's actually useful this way because I'm actually using my stims instead of hording them. I never really needed them before because my TSE Gauss would one shot crowds before they even noticed me. Sounds strange but it feels good staring down and iron sight from behind cover and fending off a horde of Super Mutants one shot at a time 
---
I really really like this concept!
---
At 1400 caps a day max from vendors, those calibrated shocks will cost me 4 days of grinding (5600 with Hard Bargain 3 and high CHA). And for stuff like that, I don't actually mind. But have you seen what they did to the building set plans? If I were buying them now brick would cost about 850 and metal somewhere around 1100 - even more if you don't have the same stats/perks. I feel bad for the lower level players who want to build a nice camp, can finally find all the plans they want, and then see those prices. 
---
Run bloodied, I ran TSE too and changed my perks around to match melee but you can use whatever that's bloodied, then just have like 100 points of health, I'm doing like 1300 damage with my fire axe
---
You're right, I should just cry on the internet over a video game instead. That would make Dad proud.

To anyone with this issue, go on twitter and call them out, referencing your case number.  Worked for me and I got a quick and apologetic response.  
---
Is there evidence INT increases xp? I haven't seen any such sources.
---
Lmao scorchbeasts are just a resource dump your argument is bad
---
These guns are still very mighty. 😎
---
Ark and other multiplayer survival games had content coming out faster than this.
---
H1Z1 went crazy on the content in the first 6 months.  They squashed a few of the more troublesome bugs (like the food and water draining too fast).
---
100% of their team is focused on bugs (even dumb ones), nerfs (even ones nobody asked for), and small QOL things.  They could remove SOME of those people to work on content.
---
I'm pretty sure marking bulk items, along with a few intended items, as no-auto-scrap is absolutely a bug. 
---
When the fuck are you going to post complete patch notes? P.S. we can't earn that amount of caps in any reasonable amount of time. You're doing this just to make us grind for months on end just so we can earn 1400 caps from vendors. We can't even sell a large portion of pour inventory. It's all bullshit. I can't even trade at the Bunker because MODUS is ALWAYS busy, each station in each section, and the bot at Harpers Ferry is just completely gone. I guess he was tired of your bullshit too.
---
This!
---
wait, i thought the dev is doing a good job with the dozen posts daily patting them on the back?
---
It's entirely possible they banned you so you can't work on your mod. This way they won't have text chat in the game, so people will stop asking for it.
---
I like
---
decent quality Pa has an absurd amount of durability, I got ambushed by 4 scorchbeasts, and just sat there waiting for them to land, no dodging, no vision, just green screen, sat in my inventory sorting favorites casually, (auto stim chest), by the time I killed them all I had lost maybe 5-10% of the durability, and that's without perks, normal armor just breaks like nothing
---
Good I hope every minor thing you buy from not on is shit or doesn't work like it should, then you can just relax and not complain too like a good little consumer. Your toothpaste? Oh they changed the formula to change your teeth blue, but oh it's just toothpaste, relax.
---
That argument is ridiculous
---
Is this a pun? Is it actually a mine?
---
The Atom Shop is not a marble floored luxury sales office.  It doesn't work because they put all of their attention to detail there instead of focusing on the actual game. The Atom Shop works because it is so mother fucking simple.  They show you pictures of shit, you click to buy the shit, the shit is added to your character.  The constant stream of items getting added to the Atom Shop?  Almost entirely assets that were already available or simple skin swaps requiring little to no time to set up.  
---
Suggesting that 76 as a whole is shittier because Bethesda put all of their energy into the Atom Shop isn't just disingenuous, it's a flat out asshole move you pull if you're just trying to stir up shit with people too stupid to actually think this shit out.
---
Wow.... Seriously.... I think I want to be you
---
Nobody is forcing you to play survival mode. Some people want PvP. 
---
Level 103 and have never owned a TSE and the only explosive I owned is a Cryolater which sounds like it might be rare now a days.
---
Private servers with mods. Games fixed. Shoot the dev team
---
If you haven't checked out Borderlands and especially Borderlands 2 then that would be a great game for a couple with your setup.  Borderlands 3 is coming too.
---
So I should call him an asshat back the way they do at your not at all pretentious primary school filled with people too insecure to talk about “””psychology”””? 
---
If the patch broke things in a way that now allows us to get something free that was meant to be released on the Atom Shop there's hope that they'll actually fix things quickly.
---
Lol I like your attitude!
---
But they didn't have to nerf explosives perks at all. The explosive effect should have been considered a separate effect all along that can't be affected by Demolitions Expert. You can do stuff like that in the Creation Kit, so it makes no sense. Or at the very least they should have made the explosive legendary just give a flat damage increase with a little splash damage. Either way, actual explosive weapons should be much stronger. The crafting requirements and weight already make them harder to use. Now my brother's autogrenade launcher does less than a regular frag grenade. What's the point anymore?
---
That's only with consoles. PC had a 500meg patch. Consoles had 5gig.
---
Which means they should roll out hotfixes to PC and make sure they don't create more issues, and roll them up for the consolers.
---
Nope. Even though I’m 200 hours deep or so I have never seen a Mothman. 
---
Gonna be one of those set aside games unfortunately. I got my money's worth and some for sure but just, getting to be a bit sad. I know theirs a lot of craziness with the game but to me it seems it was way to rushed when the beta was the full game and it came out with its bugs and the late economy duping patch the late content, no planned direction to inform is with, old bugs resurfacing, plans not being able to be crafted aka hats, x01 mods are rng still and 0 plans for x01. I'm trying to stay positive for this game but I think I'm kicking a dead horse until later in the year if the dev's try and make this game all they said it was suppose to be. I know fo has bugs, every one did, but did we not learn after skyrim, 3, 4, heck even learn from cod launches. Focus on the game before release. Lord knows how the next elder scrolls will be, fallout 5 better be some frickin good lol

Stay on the sidelines and honestly if Anthem is better, go there instead.

Same. I uninstalled a while back and haven't played in a month. I do check here for updates in case it's ever worth reinstalling and there's not any good ones today. Nothing for inventory / stash issues. Nothing new for end game. Not enough quality of life improvements. At the start, I shrugged off the bugs as "growing pains", but literally nobody in my friend group / guild even plays anymore. We used to have 10-15 people zerging scorchbeasts and we'd wait to fill up a single server. There's nothing to do after multiple SBQ kills (with disconnects and no loot half the time) and there's too many frustrating bugs and exploits (esp. for PvP). People keep defending this game like Bethesda did such a good job releasing this half done game or patching huge issues with bandaids. Well, they did the minimum viable product and sold the buggy mess to customers. Since they don't refund, I'm waiting for actual fixes to the ongoing issues and waiting for new content that isn't pvp.
---
Jesus Christ you people need to chill out for fucks sake. Remember that "shadow nerf" on fusion cores obtained from workshops the absolute uproar that they never said anything in patch notes about it and the hysteria of people going ballistic. Then a couple updates later they fix it? You remember that? Cause I do. The fact it was not intended for Bobby pins to revert just means it was a complication in the update. Which to date every god damn game has complications with its updates so chill out! 
---
The premise of today's update addressed some very serious very controversial topics in the community and thankfully Bethesda took action for it saw the purpose and intent of the items listed being critical going forward. Since they've addressed multiple server stability issues and are continuing to work on this issue regularly means we'll be able to capture workshops more regularly now without server disconnects every time we capture one (never happened to me prior but other have).  Now we can farm for those specific materials more easily through defend the workshop events in game. 
---
Apparently everyone in this community is too thick headed to see how great this update today actually means for the longevity of this game. So get your thumb out of your ass and stop pretending to be an entitled gamer because you have yo work a little harder now. 
---
Haha, yeah, they often are regardless the age. And I see you didn’t dispute the obnoxious and self-important traits - that’s pretty universal. 
---
All I’m saying as that I find them annoying, biased, and a waste of time I could better use making my own experiences. 
---
You seem to be taking this personally. 
---
Not that at all - saw that coming a mile away. It’s that they are just turning the game into farming. Just farming.  Farm exp to respec, farm mats for bullets, farm ballistic fiber to repair.  There is no content after a point, they are just making farming harder
---
Pretty sure theyre still the best weapons in the game. Theyre just no longer 50x stronger than the next best....
---
its a bug with excavator a very amazing one at that lol basically if you log off with excavatorPa equiped or switch servers you will load with an extra 100 carry weight till you exit the PA armor if you have the 2 calibrated shocks on it then your at 200 extra 
---
Pick up Sim Settlements with the Conquer addition. Makes it feel like a more alive wasteland which is a welcome change. 
---
Fffuuuuuuucccccckkkkkkkk. You are a scholar among men my friend
---
Just f\* you for laughing at a bad bugthesda move?
---
Wait. I have cap collector enabled and I don’t know if I actually understand. 
---
Are you saying when you find a cap stash, you can hit (triangle on PS4) search and it increases the caps???
---
Is there other containers that contain caps??? I think I’m missing out on using this perk. I thought it just buffed the amounts you collected or added more to enemies you killed containing caps. 
---
I believed it did not work with xp in 76. But a guy I play with did some testing with a decent int level. I wish he would have some numbers. I can ask him.
---
Good thing I server hopped forever... right?
---
Hey I appreciate that man, I'll check it out. Never played those games. Good look!
---
My concern is that it will no longer be available unless you buy it from the atom shop.
---
Really should have just been co-op without pvp. The power fantasy can’t exist in PvP games, and Fallout is always about getting that powerful weapon and destroying things that were fucking you up earlier. 
---
And it’s excellent! 
---
Yes cause dumping 6k ultracite bullets instead of 2k for a chance of trash loot feels good.....not
---
Sneak works on the SBQ? Even with enemies running about everywhere? I didn’t know! I have everything but the crit addition to my perk collection. Hmm, I was thinking that without power armor it would be difficult to fight in the nuke zone. And I lose all of my unyielding bonuses when I do don that power armor... Thanks for all the info. I’m going to keep working at it.
---
It's not even like this is rocket science. MMOs have been around since 1999 (yes, I know, not everyone thinks FO76 is an MMO, but it's built like one); RPGs even longer. That is at least *20 years* of common knowledge to go off of. But as far as I can tell, it looks like BGS is just completely winging everything - looking at every problem and issue like it's never happened before. That's what makes it infuriating.
---
They are fashion pieces
---
its so sad and frustrating seeing them be like this. i know they could do so much better, but they're just making things worse. they're ruining themselves
---
Im not sure which mission it is but yes you still need to do whatever mission it is to open the area 
---
I bet none of the devs even play the game anymore. Thats what it seems like at least. 
---
literally today. there was an "update" today that fucked everything up
---
Also like wheres some good god damn loot i can hoot and holler about?
---
You're not wrong. And to be honest, before new guns, I'd rather see current weapons correctly balanced. And after today's patch, I guess I'm not expecting that anytime soon.
---
I said it once and ill say it a million times more. They need to take the blinders off and stop living in a bubble and LEARN from other companies that have had similar issues. 
---
They need to take a page from square enix(final fantasy 14) and reboot the whole game and tie it into the lore/story whatever.
---
The engine is obviously a source of many of the games issues and needs to be done away with. Community reps need to engage the player base more and be more transparent. A planned roadmap needs to be shown to the player base showing what they intend to work on. Patches should have more in depth information. Atom shop prices need to be toned down.
---
How hard is it to play your own game bethesda and see that its on life support at this point? You need to look hard at what your doing and what your peers got right... not right as in what makes you the most money but "right" as in what keeps a player base happy and cater to that and the profits will follow naturally. 
---
Everything you are doing bethesda reeks of incompetence,greed and trying to appease shareholders.
---
The TSE nerf was a 75 percent damage reduction resulting in weapon damage that is comparable to non legendary weapons. Basically making the legendary TSE obsolete.
---
If the tse was to be nerfed I would expect the nerf to not be as aggressive as it was because they are legendary weapons that are expected to deal greater damage than common weapons. 
---
No I have not considered becoming melee.
---
I feel that making a new character would be a waste of time invested. 
---
Regardless of XP amount gains, there is still the required multiple levels and hours that will be necessary to make a new build and to farm for new weapons for a new build.
---
New content?  Naw, hell no!
---
New incosequential bug fixes, unwanted nerfs (white knight), and small QOL crap.  Hellz yes!
---
Games don't die because of a few bugs.  Games die because people get BORED and quit.  I see it in my friends list more and more every day.  I can't make friends fast enough to keep a healthy friends list going.
---
3 months in and I should NOT be starving for new friends.  This should be Prime Time when I have to say "hey I have to play in Billy's group today because I played with you yesterday".  Instead I see Offline, Offline, Offline, Offline.....
---
Thank you!
---
Or you could, you know, actually have the devs play the friggin game? I'm sorry but at this point this is just laughable. Gross incompetence doesn't even begin to describe what's going on at the so called Q&amp;A department at Beth. Every friggin patch something breaks. Things the player base asked for since the beta are ignored. Nerfs are introduced to things that didn't need a nerf. 
---
In short, let them roll back this shitshow and do a proper fix for once. And cut the nerfs. Like, who makes the decisions there?
---
Ugh use your imagination!
---
"Bethesda hasn't said anything for 12 hours,  they've abandoned the game"
---
Did you read the patch notes by any chance?
---
“Shouldn’t be a meta class that owns EVERYTHING it comes across”
---
But has never heard of melee haha. That’s the point is that this patch basically just did what you said in many peoples eyes
---
Funny as my explosive harpoon gun does 280 fully perked out. Mine did about 800 prior to today.
---
Just one
---
Shitpost. Hyperbolic. Thinks this, "Observably, factually, it is time for a change of leadership in Fallout 76 development  &lt;-- is a non-subjective statement. Pretends to be moderate but goes on to say without the OP's unreasonable and idiotic solution the game "is as good as dead". 
---
Is this sub really eating up this garbage? It's the same loud, obnoxious, self-important crap that's been flung since day 1, just in sheep's clothing. 
---
Also, do you have any facts to support the claim that the version rolled back? I see assumptions, but assumptions aren't facts.
---
I was getting 5’s all day today. 
---
Oh no, ladydevoooon, says she plays. I'm sure she toats adores it!
---
Oh.  I've never seen that bot before. That's wonderful!  A little off the mark this time, but worth it.  
---
Is it RadAway? Both times I lost marsupial today I had just used a RadAway 
---
That's true too. I don't get into mmo games but I can see that happening. 
---
The dev notes made perfect sense and all intended changes were necessary to make the game remotely challenging.
---
The mistakes of rolling back past patches are indefensible and need to be corrected.
---
These issues are not connected. It’s okay to hate the game or love it, but it’s not okay to use mistakes as fuel to build the fire of things you don’t like that are making the game better for end game players.
---
Ha, thanks porn person!
---
It's total bullshit I can't even use my two shot explosive to farm legendaries and one shot anything with a pulse. What am I supposed to do with all these duped handmade plans now that they're readily available?! My stash box was already full without the bobby pins. A bunch of my buddies quit because they essentially took the fun out of the game for us with this update, and we paid full price. Game is broken! 
---
I’m a level 92 and still love to do the event. I don’t have OP TSE weapons, but I did get a 3* quad lever action that I main now. I also got a 3* sledge that has reduced weight and swings faster. 
---
Surely not. I can't imagine anything going wrong if they try to fix this.
---
Seriously. This is why FO4 is going to be played longer than 76. If you didn't like how something was working in 4, you just fucking changed it. FO76's stupid version of online play stops that.
---
Preach it!!! I find it amazing how many people on here get offended when people bitch about the game !! it’s a fucking forum and as Fallout lovers you worry that this game is heading in a bad direction; never mind some of the completely asshat decisions Bethesda keeps making !! Maybe you guys have infinite funds to throwaway and laugh it off but people like this gentleman  and others,  me included -value our money !!!yes the game is fun , I play it daily - but complaint about stuff that’s still going wrong 2 months after it’s release is to be expected. I guess it’s all about trolling on here instead of sharing ideas.
---
So your solution for a person that was asking for advice about a video game is that they should commit suicide instead of any other option?
---
After the beautiful failure that was 1.0 they shut down the servers, and remade the game almost from the ground up. It's very fun to play now and they even worked a lore friendly reason for the shut down into the game.
---
Bullet sponge enemies and ridiculous item fragility are two of the biggest design flaws of this game - when you take away the fact that it was so obviously not designed to be multiplayer and was made so at the 11th hour.
---
Its called damage mitigation and was in the one of the more recent patches. Look it up for yourself.
---
Not for those who legitimately farmed and paid their dues in grinding already. This isn’t additional content, this is getting kicked in the pants at the finish line and being tossed a mile back down the road and being told to be enthusiastic that you’ve got more race left to run. 
---
Do you not feel managed?
---
can't believe such a drama queen post was voted to the top . get ahold of yourself nancy.  You are turning "unforgivable" into the new "inconceivable!"
---
Stop embarrassing real fallout fans.
---
Tons of people agree, yet Bethesda ignores them.  They've nerfed it into the ground.
---
I’ve taken a lot of what I learned from 76 and started applying it to a new fo4 run.  I feel I am ‘really’ playing the game now 
---
This is some of the problems but not all. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cap stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
So I just blue screened walking down the road. Sweet. 
---
Lmk if you plan to sell or if you'd have any idea to what event to do to get it
---
Today? 
---
About a month ago there were posts about player base being estimated off of achievements, because achievements made by ingame players are available to the general public. Not sure if the numbers were - or still are viable, though. 
---
See, when you word it like that, it doesn't sound very rational. 
---
shotgun or handmade user?
---
Useless now, but get on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar and sell it.
---
I think I sold mine for 500 caps or something.  No idea why the person wanted it, but I like caps :)
---
I get it, I know what it is. But it's not entirely unreasonable. If they continue to do these things, it will have a direct impact on any sort of competitive content, be it progression pushing or PvP. It's an entire extra body worth of damage a team can soak right now.
---
If no one speaks up about this, it's how games slowly turn into pay to win. Always have to have the latest skins from the store to have that edge over the next person during an event.
---
bethesda never reveals
---
Honestly this is yet another ass suggestion that would make the game stupidly easy. Is fallout 76 actually difficult for you? Everyone has a fuckton or caps and if you don’t there’s literally dozens of ways to get a ton of caps.
---
Or they implement your idea and I can make 25k caps per hour by crafting and selling Halloween skeleton outfits. Sounds fun! 
---
Sounds like you liked it, too 😘
---
I read that rad worms disease is broken, it affects everything, maybe its that?
---
Love it, exited to jump on tonight
---
PVP is what they turn to when they want players to make their own content vs. them spending money to make PVE lol
---
Quality Asshatery
---
I played the Anthem Demo and I'm 100% jonesing for some more! The load bug and a few others were kinda annoying but the demo is an old build. Still not sure why they went with an old build but I'm guessing they didn't want to give away too much of the real story... either way it's going to be a fun and fast paced game! 
---
So fucking sue me.  
---
This actually makes my point even fucking better because the OP is just being a whiny little bitch about a feature that has been in the majority of modern Fallout games by this point then.  For fuck sake 76's repair system is a walk in the park compared to having to deal with the old systems that required sacrificing an entire fucking second weapon every time you wanted to repair one and this bitch is crying that a maxed out White Knight now requires TWO balistic fiber instead of one which just RUINS the game.
---
The hate is that people don't like having to grind mats. We don't like having to spend hours tracking down the materials to be able to keep playing for that same amount of time. Armor degradation is too fast to begin with and white knight is the only thing that makes it tolerable. Hopefully the nerf doesn't make me feel like I'm spending as much time grinding as playing again or I'll just walk away.
---
Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acb6uw/proposed_yardstick_damage_build_not_weapon/?st=JRINF4J4&amp;sh=69e019e7
---
What the hell. Someone is gonna get fired. Those sound like all the previous patches were undone. 
---
Thanks for the heads up 
---
Shhh . dont tell bethesda that with 5 pieces of 20% weapon reduction armor stacked you can basically hold 200 servers worth of guns on you. Server performance that !
---
I think the bigger content is on its way, still. Can’t we be patient? 
---
They are tweaking how their world works, now that it’s had a decent run at actually living.  It’s to be expected! 
---
You as a melee build can't understand the scale TSE was nerfed. Way over nerfed and the demo card nerf was uncalled for. The original explo weapons are now even weaker. The ones noone used pre patch, now thay are the worst. 
---
Pins back to 0.1lb
---
Weight issues across all platforms, player saying the carry weight is changing all the time and not registering correctly.
---
Bulk mats are rendered un usable atm. Try to repair something that takes 8 different bulked materials! You have to scrap your bulk manually, BUT STILL cannot just scrap em all to your inventory because of the weight they have if not bulked.
---
Well, there is nothing that allows players to see that information that I am aware of on Xbox.
---
Though I did just participate in a SBQ.  Melee's next because who the fuck needs TSE when a few melee guys can wipe the floor with her ass... of course, when she finally lands.
---
Most people with an opinion will find critics obnoxious and self-important because it makes it easier to dismiss them. But sure I’ll disagree with those too. It’s the natura movement of ‘I don’t like what they are saying’ to ‘I don’t like how they say things’.
---
Annoying, biased, just the same words people would use to describe a critic they disagree with.
---
I don’t take it personally, I just find it interesting that there is a group of people happy to ignore critical content and just ‘find out for themselves’. A fool and his money and all that. Meanwhile everyone else figured out how to analyse a review, because if someone says ‘It is brown, I hate brown, it is therefore shit’ and I like brown then guess what? I’m buying it. But I’m also not going to go and laugh about how there is some goon people pay attention to that hates brown.
---
exactly. even if people use bloodied, they still suffer from low health so they'll die more often. Evenso, explosives were nerfed by like 85% (taking into consideration demolition perk nerf). Like how was this not "vetoed" , per say, during discussion? WRONG!!!! (angryjoe) 
---
they didnt have to do a damn thing, for majority of us everything was good, but then a certain few wanna bitch &amp; whine cuz they were getting one shot &amp; what not &amp; bethseda thought it would be best to punish everyone for it. This was the nail in the coffin for me. to hell with this game from here on out 
---
I haven't found them on any vendor either. Need BOS arm plans if anyone is selling
---
I have my frustrations with Bethesda too but it doesn't help to just crab at them. xD 
---
Anyway, I'm just gonna sit back and popcorn through the current 'they reversed the entire last patch' debacle. Still waiting on any proof of that, but hey, people like to talk.
---
What a great idea and a good opinion. Not being sarcastic either. I wonder how fast bethesda would change their tone if over half their users or more didnt log in for a solid week? They may actually fix some of the problems and start listening to the community. 
---
How much stuff do you have?? Even unbulked I'm nowhere near 1700 or whatever they set it at. 
---
Uninstalled the game like a week after I posted that, it was a cash grab 
---
Yeah right. It's a Fallout game. Name one Fallout game that isn't buggy. You knew what you were getting into. There only needs to be on thread on here for reporting bugs. Not a hundred redundant posts. The level of spam is insane.
---
Confirmed, handmade rifle plans are available at the Watoga railroad vendor for \~1800 caps (level 58, 4 Charisma).  Ended up dipping into my precious stash of Grape Mentats and buying up plans for that one (finally!), as well as a number of other plans I've been looking for.  Going to be selling off mutfruit, beer bottles and tin cans for fast travel caps for a while, but totally worth it.
---
With any luck, undoing the “patch” they did that seems to have caused more bugs than it fixed. 
---
Every purge then found me lacking supplies when everything needed fixing meaning I had to go hunt with my back up gear to fix my main weapons and armour. In a game so heavily dependent on fixing absolutely everything all the bloody time it isn't hording to have 2k steel, it's just trying to delay resource gathering so you can actually play the game. 
---
Thank you for your post. Borderlands 3 was great but it was a one and done kinda game (buttstallion says hello) and the prequel was complete garbage. I played ff7 but never got into any of the others. I haven't heard of Stardew valley or rimworld but I will look into them. Once again, awesome post thank you. 
---
I'm not sure all these plans suddenly available all the time was intended, so whether you like the price or not, now might be your short opportunity to snag certain things.
---
Its obviously clear that none of them play the end game grindfest either by the changes they implement. 
---
Is that what he said? Your uncle, I mean. Tell me- how does that make you feel?
---
But what about dense armor plans?
---
I agree 100% dude. I really do.
---
Todd will just go on stage, make a smug ass joke about their games having bugs because the internet said so and the idiot masses will still preorder any new garbage they put out because people have lost the balls to vote with their wallets.
---
You are the reason devs make stupid changes. I’m sorry but horrible input I think you’re just salty towards TSE’s for some reason (what’d they do to you ;-/ &amp; also melee builds? Wtf do you want us to use? &amp; how tf do you expect us to beat the queen? Without TSE’s idk how we’d beat it now but without melee builds we’d really be fucked 
---
Dont forget that we should age as well and die of old age thus deleting that character forever.
---
Isn't that what most games are. I like to imagine some conglomerate that says "hey, if you keep their attention long enough we will pay you" so everything turns into how long can we keep people watching our stuff or playing our stuff. 
---
Stash? 500/600 all mats bulked just like all other ppl that play the game. 
---
A regression defect is not a routine stumble.
---
You mean like horrible input that this sub spews out?
---
The 1.x version of the game was not good. After a while they said "alright this isn't working out. um. we can fix this." and took the game offline after a number of in-game events ushering in an apocalypse ("hey, a red star. hey, that red star was a little smaller last patch, wasn't it? alright it's definitely getting bigger. here it comes. oh god why is it opening up") In Nov 2012 they shut down the servers. 
---
August 2013 they brought it back online as version 2.0, with the subtitle "A Realm Reborn", having fixed a lot of the issues from 1.x, and having advanced the story to the aftermath of 1.x's finale cataclysm. 
---
this completely destroyed my build and I don't even have a TSE weapon. I run as a stealth sniper with explosives and now my sniper gauss rifle with explosive takes 4 shots on a normal level 64 scorched and my grenades barely scratch mobs that are half my level. I have a 2 shot .50 cal MG that used to take a clip to take down a level 50 Scorch beast, now it takes 3 clips. This is getting far to grind for ammo and not enough to actually do in game after the quests are done, dailies suck for rewards.
---
It seems silly that a weapon can have a listed value of 200+ caps but only sells to vendors for 8.
---
You have to store it and place it again.  Every time it gets placed a new random code is generated.
---
Hint, to get the process to go faster, make sure the powered door is the ONLY thing left in your stored tab.  That allows you to drop it, check the code, if it's bad, store it, and drop again.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
If you're looking for good story &amp; semi open world, play Deus Ex Mankind Divided or Elder Scrolls Online.
---
Alternatively, head back to the Forest (or really anywhere West of the savage divide) going to ask the locations that you've missed. You'll get XP for locations, new quests and events from reading terminals &amp;c, and find new weapons. I had a TSE for two days, and it was incredible. I didn't even need to aim, but you'll find other good weapons, be able to move some perks, and even start having more fun because the game will be more challenging
---
Instructions unclear. Broke game instead.
---
Sell plans cheaper than the vendor price? 
---
Same here. I cannot believe they want to use the same engine for the next elder scrolls game!
---
i'm sure people wouldnt mind it shut down for even a month, with the state it's in i'm sure many people dont want to play it anyway
---
And i can hardly take credit for the autism that is Bethesda.
---
They are trying to weaken the “overly” strong.  Balance is there objective here.
---
I have not acquired a weapon yet that’s affected by these changes. Still, they felt a need to re-balance. Perhaps they thought the overpowered guns masked a lack of combat skill? 
---
Adjust!! 
---
Yeah exactly, I like the idea of a shared team container .. but yeah for the moment that is the safest if you don't want to use the trade function
---
Yeah those guys are on it
---
Blessing in disguise? Make sure you keep the one on that lowers bad stats. 
---
You can still love the game and complain about problems with it 👍
---
You like talking dirty to me, huh? Good, I'm glad I can get you all horny 🍆
---
It's totally normal for the to nerf things like this w/o mentioning it.  It's their way of making the game more grindy and to push away the people that actually played the game daily.  It's pathetic.  I've defended them from Day 1 and had lots of fun w/ this game, but they're ruining it.  
---
Hey, look!  Vendors now have more plans!
---
\- But wait, the methods you used to make a measly 1400 caps per day are now gone.  Enjoy Farmout 76!  
---
It was, but the chem debuff was 55%, not 82%
---
It is lol, this like alt number 5
---
This is an amazing concept idea you should tag Bethesda and get them working on it immediately
---
I’ve gotten to past level 50 with almost no legendaries. Only reason I’m starting to get more right now is because I’m farming white springs golf club. But not for legendaries or exp. I’m trying to get that sweet sweet Black Cowboy hat. Went to grab it last week and my internet shat the bed just before I could get it.
---
It’s my new obsession now that I finally got the Gatling gun plan last night
---
Not surprised. 
---
Ok, by lower level I generally mean like 50 and under. At 97, I have most plans by now.
---
Btw, if you're on PS4 I have lots of extra plans if you want any.
---
Mine is fine. Did your game even update? 
---
I posted this a week ago about this update. I could tell it would be a shit show even then: "You need to summon your inner Marie Kondo if you have that much stuff.
---
Everyone here at this subreddit went batshit crazy over dupers and nerfs so Bethesda thought they had a priority to ban those people instead of fixing QoL. Thanks Reddit. Now we will have weapons that can't kill Queens and SBs. Looks like even if we could kill the Queen next week, we will have no place to put our loot. I guess this all is moot though if they put something out this week in their notes."
---
Sounds like communism to me. 🤷‍♂️
---
Yeah, it did.
---
What’s CT’s?
---
Yeah, I’m waiting for Anthem then once I’m bored with that I’ll be right back here. Maybe. We will see. 
---
Future nerf
---
So.... dont make a profit? You wouldn't buy a product for your business for $10 and then sell them for $8.
---
Which is not officially sanctioned by Bethesda so for all we know anyone using any kind of mod might at some point get banned because Bethesda never officially supported mods for FO76. Not saying it's going to happen but at this point, who'd be surprised if it did?
---
I think the main reason why people are upset is because the game isn’t even finished yet 
---
No, they designed the text chat mod for PC.
---
I uninstalled a while back and I lurk here waiting for patch notes with big improvements one day. But honestly you're right, it's probably gonna be until 2020. They're great at updating the atom store with things, and not as fast doing the bug and exploit fixes or quality of life things like inventory increases. Customer support was also terrible when I asked about different things: performance issues, visual bugs, general issues. This game was fun for the first couple of hours, and then you get to the part where you realize PvP is horribly balanced, lots of exploits like bobblehead stacking &amp; melee slap damage being ridiculous. And for pve, scorch queen fight will consistently disconnect &amp; has a very random loot table (if she drops anything at all)
---
 So what is end game? What will be the new content to wait &amp; loot for? Nothing official right now, and now they roll back the game this patch to a worse one apparently.
---
strangler bloom isn't as available as you make it out to be.  
---
Everything else is abundant except that specific mat.  
---
If you could repeat that quest, or if it just used strangler PODS (which are abundant) then that would be better than having to server hop hoping to find bloom.  
---
But hey maybe I'm missing something, if they are indeed 100% available always at night then I'll be happy.
---
It's the pins phantom weight :D thay back to 0.1
---
That is definitely new
---
Let's all get our pipe rifles and kill a queen in 3 shots. Yah that's fun. Lets kill a queen so fast no one else gets xp. Let's kill waves of glowing ghouls alone and have the other 6 ppl get no xp. That's called selfishness and that's what's wrong with the world and this game. Those 2 traits should of never been grouped for one gun. I want a instigating vampires lever. Dont think that exists so why does a tse. I say delete em from the game. Be a fun challenge for a change.
---
Everyone at Bethesda need to hit the brakes and pool all resources into fixing their bugs. STOP trying to work on new content like the PVP mode and DLC and START fixing bugs so we can at least enjoy the base game we paid for. 
---
People have horrible hoarding tendencies because the last few Fallout Games have been like that. And now that there's a survival type aspect to the vanilla  version, people are going to hoard even more. Bethesda gis making its players go against everything they've spent the last 10+ years conditioning them to. 
---
Could be, just did a disease cure as I had rad worms, and the bugs are back to normal, but the debuffs are still enhanced
---
We’re thanking them now for common sense. Something they clearly lack when they didn’t include this.
---
This or someone reverted a commit without putting a note XD
---
I feel like I've been screwed over. Myself and my wife play on the same account/character and we've never duped or any of the other crap..
---
(Ok we do log off in our excavator pa.) But our favorites were our 2shot handmade. Just 2shot. Then our/my only explosive which is a 10mm sub with double ammo(she hates but is my shtf weapon) We grinded and farmed for those. So everyone is being punished for dupers? She brought up the fact that bobbled head dupers/stackers where a real problem. I'm not a software guy but couldn't Bethesda just eliminate duped weapons through coding? I know some people traded or God forbid paid real money for them, but this is ridiculous. We spent a good amount of time and level ups this evening just trying to go from a level 136 whose now a 70ish back to where we were. Something needed to be done, but this is imo... a lazy way of doing it.
---
Oh booo communism booo is that what I’m supposed to say?
---
With developers this amazing I'm sure it's already in the works my freind!
---
Grahm has the Handmade plans, too.
---
Bethesda, why not allow us to sell all the duplicate recipes and plans we get in light of jacking the costs??? It makes no sense that I should throw these items away or scour Appalachia looking for someone who needs them.
---
So I never got around to purchasing the metal walls/building plan because I was happy with brick at the time. Now because the plan is readily available I have to shell out 7x the original price?
---
Reminds me of my neighbor I once saw on Seneca Rocks. I was on one of the peaks, he was on the other.
---
I could carry 3 and it would be too many for all the lockpicking I do now.
---
It happens. I definetly took it slow so I wouldn't be burned out so quickly. I'm not going to stop playing (I understand where you are coming from) I think I hit lvl 130 something, and plan on playing alot more once their is some new stuff but I think I might check out some other games for awhile, played the anthem demo and it was cool, jump force beta is out but the times are crud. 
---
I physically laughed when i read farmout 76. This needs a meme. Picture of farm simulator but titled farmout 76
---
Yes I do need to change my TSE weapon to another type of weapon because of the nerfs. With that being said the weapon I have now is so underpowered that solo farming for a new weapon replacement will be near impossible.  I might have to result to just tagging mobs in whitesprings till I can get a decent weapon again because there is no way I can solo then anymore. 
---
You can find plans from places other than vendors ya know. 
---
This fucking guy deserves reddit gold
---
Why dont they just do away with the condition crap in general, fallout 4 didnt have this stupid weapon repair BS, and no real weapon would break as fast as the ones in fo76. 
---
\*clap,clap,clap\* Thanks bethesda for nerfing TSE weapons, now if yall excuse ill be out in the wasteland putting my boxing gloves and whack a mutant or something
---
RIP TSE, hello Melee weapons.
---
The invisible thing has been happening a lot lately. I can deal with it if the tag is still there, but when you completely invisible it’s hard to play on a team. I had a lot of issues playing for just a couple hours today. 
---
Yeah...looking forward for something new so I can play again. Every thing I want do needs farming in between and that’s just not really fallout to me. 
---
INCOMING NERF WARNING
---
Enjoy that while you can.
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
yeah bethseda is punishing everyone cuz some of these lil bitches wanted to whine about being a victim of a one hitter in PvP. they went WAY TOO extreme with the nerf imo &amp; its safe to say i will be trashing the game as of today smh
---
I mean, you said they’re leveling out the strong to make the weak balanced. Sounds like communism to me. Take it as you will
---
I will send you a PM.
---
The game should have been Fallout: DayZ and every day it's not that is a wasted day of it's life span.
---
I feel like there are things that need addressed far more than weapons being slightly OP. I still enjoy the game but there are definitely bigger issues.
---
Maybe just an out of season April Fool's prank.
---
So did I. But with the previous patch lowering the weight, I have stopped dumping the extras... While I don't have 200, 120 is more than I need if they have a decent weight on them.
---
So the takeaway being that your uncle made you feel dirty, and you believe that to be a good thing. Great, great. We’re making some real progress here. Now is that what your uncle used on you? An eggplant? How did you feel about that?
---
They care because I’ve been given a great time. Don’t speak for me lil ho 
---
I can totally understand the raider set.  Its rusted metal.  You really cant paint rusted metal. Paint tend to just fall off.  But ultracite and excavator, YES!
---
I didn't even think about trying this, I'll give it a shot and hope for the best, thanks.
---
I'm glad you have found true peace, brother.
---
This isn't needed :( kill the scorched they summon, it lands.  Deal 1 or more damage with a shotgun and the enforcer perk that cripples wings and it will land in 3 or 4 shots.  Shoot with a heavy weapon with the cripple perk in luck and it lands too.  People just don't know how to get it to land.   I learned by bitching about it on Reddit. Some guy said this to me.  I equipped a low level shotgun and got the enforcer perk and leaned he was right. 
---
That must have been quite the sight - 2 houses on the peaks!
---
If your friends ran away from  the game because they'll have to repair their armor slightly more often and have it cost a whole one or two more of each fucking resource then I'm sorry, that is the exact opposite of "hardcore".  You're a bunch of pansy assed casuals who are crying over absolutely nothing.
---
they drop a new character every 3-4 months, with a ramped up schedule for more heroes this year than any other time before, don't you try to drag OW through the mud to defend 76. THAT game is fucking fun. 
---
I mean I agree about the melee but they really need balance overall, there's alot not right but things will eventually change over time. This guys just most likely salty he can't dupe or one shot people or something. Idk. Honestly this post was for attention so.. Yeah. I guess he got some. 
---
I’m on Xbox. My plan wish list is metal walls, Neon Letters (is this visible for a lvl 97?), and tabletop lamps. 
---
300caps. Best I can do, my man!
---
How? 
---
I think that might actually kill the game at this point
---
My buddy was like should I respec to melee? Told him - for now but it’s gonna be next nerf...so hope you like the grind for grinding sake
---
Watoga Emergency Services, I think.
---
this really sux.
---
Recommendation: explosion damage reduction for the effects on the guns ONLY. The grenades and M79 are a lifesaver with mobs and big-nasties, like mirelurk queens.
---
My sniper-grenadier build may be nerfed too much. I haven't been able to log so I can try just yet.
---
I have never noticed. I’m have a Mandela effect moment. I clearly remember regular stimpaks healing like a flat 150 or 200 hp, not a percentage, and not in the weird burst as a diluted. 
---
That's what I'm getting at, it sucks that we the players won't get the same amount of time out of this game like we did previous fallouts due to all the issues and dropping player base. That this game being ran the way it is, makes the game feel temporary and that giving up on it, money and time invested, and going back to the old fallouts has been a alternative that people see as rationale.
---
Holy shit, very well said.
---
Yep.  Missile launcher was garbage before despite being super heavy and using heavy ammo.  I can only imagine how worthless it is now.
---
Yup, they really like to nerf things but don't bother to buff the things that need some work.  Just seems like these patches do more to make the game more of a grind.  Yeah some people cheated and got to end game content in like the first handful of days, then there's people like me who's been playing when I have the time since the 'beta' and I've got two level 35 characters trying different builds.  Haven't even seen half the map or been in a nuke zone and suddenly they are making all the plans to let me survive that content super expensive.  Not fucking cool Betheseda :P  Also fix the bugs that have been around since Fallout 4 before "balancing the economy" plz.
---
A medium sized part of me feels bitter that it is now going to be much easier for people to get the mods that I spent literal weeks server hopping for, hours at a time every day. But, also, the mod plans are SUPER expensive now, and I spent probably a total of 2k caps on my mods, whereas everyone else will now pay a LOT more if they go for the mod PLAN. I feel more sorry for them.
---
nice work.  sounds like you put in more thought than those who gave us..........this.
---
Nice. Sometimes some really odd bugs happen. I like the one where I can see inside my guys skull the most. 
---
Imagine you'd played previous Fallout titles that were much more fun and less grindy with less inventory management garbage.
---
Then come here.
---
And have less fun things, with more grind, and a metric ton of inventory management juggling needed.
---
Now you understand.  Or maybe you don't.
---
My friends aren't leaving because of bugs, nerfs, or small QOL fixes...............they're leaving because there's no new CONTENT.
---
Oh no! You’re forced to use vendor bots like the rest of us savages 😢
---
It's obvious the devs don't read reddit or give a damn about it. Those "**Dev team is aware of so and so..."** statements are just lip service to make us feel our voices have been heard.
---
You are either the densest person on the planet, or one of the best trolls.
---
Bummer. I play with my son and we have a blast!
---
Hording is a big deal for alot of ppl.
---
I have a main and an alt. Combined they couldn't max out a mule
---
When I noticed my bulked items no longer counted towards materials to craft with, I just laughed... So much broken this patch, it's just sad...
---
I can almost guarantee this will be fixed before anything else. 
---
What a myopic way to play the game. That's too bad.
---
Here's hoping you and Lou can find a replacement.
---
Lawsuit if this ever happens some  people buy atomic points 
---
If only that were true, I could just ditch the pins. But just checking my Pip-Boy seems to be enough for the numbers to change. It's Schrodinger's Stash - I do not know whether or not I will be overencumbered until I open my inventory.
---
They are making the strong less strong. Still strong. Just less strong. The weak stay the weak. 
---
Pretty easy to run out of caps with the current prices thougb so people will still be looking for a cheaper alternative. 
---
I’ve literally lost all will to play this game. This game revolves around TSE weapons, without them PVP isn’t even a question and PVE is much much more costly. 
---
And then when you try to farm for that cost or for TSE weapons, oh look! YOU’RE OVER THE FUCKING CARRYWEIGHT!!!! Jesus Christ Bethesda, just don’t fuck up The Elder Scrolls VI like this. 
---
Go figure.
---
Actually testing proves ppl are liars
---
Juts curious but what makes this gun so valued?
---
How now brown cow?
---
Mods need to be updated
---
I was a primarily Handmade user but I kept a TSE shotgun for scorchbeast and crowd control. 
---
Like communism 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Why should I devote time to becoming a melee God?
---
What if that gets nerfed also?
---
I *think* it was the helmet, but don't hold me to that.
---
Same this game could have been soo good but with every patch I just don't wanna play as much. anytime I see a scorchbeast it does that infinite scream and kills me. Farming ballistic fiber is the worst and the amount of caps needed for some stuff vs. the amount of caps you get per day from trading is wild
---
Does Class Freak have any effect at all on serum-based mutations? I didn't think so, but I'll admit that whole topic is still more confusing than not to me...
---
What's some underpowered things that need buff in your opinion?
---
The accumulate on a tab that you don't pay much attention to when you're cleaning up.
---
Exactly. Every meta of Fallout is different. Even getting hit by zombies at the golf course is hurting a lot more than intended. I wonder if those now have armor penetration to help fight off those people who are trying to log servers and farm exp /Legendaries. Also a note to that area, I have 15 luck and every windigo I killed I get about 20 to 25 items to drop. Pretty weird.
---
Yes, but he probably shares the same fate as me. If you log out at CAMP, you will probably fall to your death when you log in because your camp needs time to load...
---
They must on some level, but this is insanity. It's like there are no regression tests, or this is the laziest code review process I've ever seen...
---
They rolled back, so there must be versioning, but why they needed to in the first place makes me wonder.  And of all patches to release on all systems at the same time. If they had released to PC (like with every previous patch), perhaps they could have avoided angering the entire player base in one go.
---
Hopefully they revert this change right quick.
---
I alway tell people to stop hoarding - you know you don’t need it.
---
Gotcha. So why didn't Bethesda just Nerf those instead of nerfing then entire explosive weapons skill?
---
im on the same boat. They broke my baby, but i will still use it. Just throw over a stealth build and its still good.
---
🤷‍♂️ go back to school, maybe?
---
today's a bit of a trainwreck here and on the forums, have you hit them on twitter? either one of the Bethesda accounts or LVW directly?
---
¿Por que no los dos?
---
I'm simply a poor boy running around with an Auto Grenade Launcher, I don't think it's my fault and I didn't think I was even meta'ing :/
---
What another pretentious response. You don't need to do anything back, you could call him whatever you want, if you think that's how he's acting. Don't need to be dumb to not want a lecture for calling someone an ass. 
---
P.s. I love your segment at the end where you chastise me for voicing my opinions online, then proudly group yourself with people who "point the finger at how you drive your brain". FWIW that what he did when he called you an asshat
---
The White Knight neft stings
---
Sure.
---
But they are also worth at least 1 cap apiece. 😉
---
This patch seems to have introduced a new bug: Whereas players on your team used to show up with no clothing/armor on after passing through a load/fast travel boundary, now they simply don't show up at all. For example, earlier today we went through the door to Belching Betty. I couldn't see the other player on my team. When I went back outside, the character was still displayed outside the door, not wearing any gear. The only way I've found to resolve this is to disconnect/reconnect.
---
Its funny how the obvious meds to be stated
---
Why would they do that?  This is Farmout 76 obviously.  We know where things are going from here, they have made it very clear what changes they would like to improve the game, if it results in you spending more time playing the game, then it is good by them.  
---
when you consider that half the bugs are from morrowind and they have never fixed those I don't hold much hope they will bother to fix them after 20+ years.
---
Booooooooooooooooooo
---
I love to hoard in Fallout games.  Can't do that here.
---
Step 1 - Constantly dumping things on the ground to make room for other things.
---
Step 2 - Then figuring out I need more of that thing to craft X because I dumped too much of it.
---
Step 3 - Farm something like it's my job for an hour or two.
---
Step 4 - Return to Step 1.
---
That's not content.  That's pointless grind.  Couldn't agree with you more :)
---
I agree 
---
It dropped to 119
---
Welp you answered that question 🤣
---
Whooooooosh
---
Great if you dont have multiple characters.
---
Wait what. What's a mule? I only have one dude and I throw a bunch of stuff
---
3 Teams in different places working on a Project.
---
I dont have to say more.
---
I agree with alot of that. I hated to see everything go to the v-buck standard. We had cod points before and advanced warfare for example the loot crates unique varients gave you in game advantages of different weapon abilities. I agree that they need more lore as well or atleast do something with that massive map they have. I was so disappointed that the crashed ship had nothing going on. The mothman thing was cool and all but they could build on it. I think in a few months they will flesh it out some more but for now it just feels itself like a dlc. I think point lookout took the same amount of time for me to 100% as this one did. And that sucks. I still haven't done most of the missions.
---
This isnt your typical fallout game, i thought this was apparent from the start, you didnt have to hoard everything in the previous games it was just an option, im sure you found yourself not even using 90% of what you found anyway
---
To be honest the situation with trading and providing 3rd service for independent players who have a desire to open a super duper building now have a huge hurdle to overcome. It can be trumped with now having MAX amount mule accounts and even quite possibly outfitting them with PA with CA shocks... I have mutual friends via Facebook groups who mostly play to do as described and now are extremely disappointed with patch results. A massive attempt to cull dupers and RTM sellers... It might work but it has negatively affected those who wanted to be retailers for the wasteland :/
---
They are aware.
---
Its just that reddits little hissy fits are small fry in the big pond
---
Yes, ignore a key recreation of a key mechanic. 
---
No, the correct answer is "Quit the game." 
---
&gt;nobody said they kill spawns or the SBQ too well...
---
Wait, what? That's what everyone has been saying. Not SBQ, but I've seen way more complaints about people with TSEs in blast zone killing legendaries faster than everyone else can get a hit in than I've seen complaints about getting killed by TSEs in PVP.
---
Alright so your uncle “broke you in.” You’re brave to admit that. Good for you, Ted, good for you. Now- and this is important- were you an effeminate, weepy little puff before the sodomy or did that behavior begin afterwards. Nobody is judging you, but the question must be asked for the sake of your online therapy.
---
As for your aversion to a quick read- is this because words are hard? Perhaps some autism present? Or is your uncle to blame for that as well? Did he make you read things to him? Cut a hole in thick book and put his penis through for you? What has you so scared of words, Ted?
---
This is a safe place, Ted. Be honest.
---
Pfft, I server hopped while watching Suits. I got tens of thousands of caps worth of plans for 20% of what they cost now.
---
I ain't even mad bb
---
I think he was trying to r/whooosh but idk. 
---
Never said I was immune :) 
---
Shhhhh. It makes West tek a breeze
---
The only way they’ll listen is if we stop playing the game, that’s the truth
---
I seriously think u r playing the game very wrongly then, All that stuff u claim as chores just happens in the general course of exploring for me, Im never without required materials (this includes the supposedly rare ballistic fibre, which i must be the luckiest guy in the world as im always finding it), I only need to repair my weapon/s maybe once a day, and armor even less frequently, and no i dont actually have any of the material reduction perks like White Knight. I personally have not experienced my base being attacked by PVPers once (but that might be location ie. Not whitesprings)
---
I’m not really worried about that although I think there should be a time limited non spammable reset. 
---
More pressing: 
---
Perk cards should have a store function, we all have cards we won’t use because of packs and decisions that happened after significant level.  Store would hide them with the option to go bring it back if desired. 
---
Second, Upgrading should not be a process of gaining duplications, which are useless. Delete the useless step. After we own level 1 only show level 2, and don’t award duplicates in packs period. No more duplication. It serves no purpose. It’s pure bloat. 
---
Equally important, trade ui streamline, f1 ui is a perfect example. 
---
Action Bar customization.
---
I think that's their point.  No one gets this upset and quits the game over having to repair their armor slightly more often for a whole one extra ballistic fiber.  This guy and his "friends" were FAR more likely rolling around one shoting shit with their TSE's and now they're so pissed they actually have to play the game.
---
I noticed they fire off a "Stimpack has worn off" message now.  They weren't doing that before, for me at least.
---
I agree, everyone is crying because they can't one shot every enemy, what is the point of even playing when you are that over powered?
---
I think the game is fun and I have had sever drops and freezing but nothing like the fallout subreddits and YouTube would have you believe. I started playing in December so maybe that is why? But the player interaction has been super fun and I enjoy solo play as well. Inconceivable!
---
There are still some issues with the social system. For example, in a two-player team if one player disconnects from the server and then reconnects, you can't rejoin. The pop-up says that you can't invite a player who isn't in a team, but the message remains even if the second player leaves the team. Also, there still seems to be an issue where a player who has quit from a server is considered to be in a "different world" when trying to do team invites from the main menu.
---
I've been burnt out for a while, I don't have friends to play this with so the end game is tedious and the grind to get things to allow you to grind to get other things is losing excitement. When I read that a patch was coming out I thought maybe I'd jump back in but to see they've made the game worse with bad decisions and not added anything new beyond a few things that should have been in game since release had me sigh and accept this game isn't getting better. Part of my optimistic attitude was that they'd fix major issues and rapidly added at least a little more to the game but so far all that is happening is nerfs and removal of content while bugs and exploits stay. I could forgive a sluggish start as the game was fun but the fun dried up just like the good will for the devs. 
---
I've defended this game because it is painfully standard of the gaming industry to make and release messy games. If Anthem can fix their problems that game will be replacing the hole I wanted 76 to be in. I'm not holding out much hope for that game as their beta was worse than 76s. I have For Honor and Siege to play who both pulled off the phoenix move that 76 just doesn't seem anywhere near doing. I have Metro Exodus coming to entertain me with a story. I might start those games I keep putting off starting or finishing. I don't need 76, I wanted 76 but the devs just haven't made it ready and they are now going the wrong direction. Bad dev direction is why I left Sea of Thieves. It really does seem every game I have interest in fails or releases as a failure and has to claw it's way back. 
---
I found Heavy Combat Legs at Watoga Station.  
---
So far haven’t found Arms and Torso.
---
Will have to check more later.  
---
Individual servers go up and down all the time
---
lol @ speed demon. on ps4 the game already nearly crashes when sprinting trying to load the game in, can't wait to see what it does with 50% more boost.
---
They definitely feel weaker now, especially the diluted ones. They used to fill like 20%, now it’s like 10
---
The fact that grabbing a super sledge and switching to melee is the best option really shows the state of this game rn
---
The Dev team are the same idiots who put the .1 bobby pin weight back in... clueless bunch of folks.
---
This is something they already should have done. This call for action should have come from within Bethesda and heads should already have already rolled. That we haven't seen that is just more of the same bad management, more incomprehensibly-directed, off-course development.
---
It's the Rad Worms. 
---
Buffs almost every character stat by 1.5x
---
Howww noww browwwn cooow
---
Im just speechless this is from Bethesda...
---
dude it's not like bobby pins are rare or lockpicking is difficult, just fucking drop them and move on with your goddamn life.
---
Also, why?
---
Can you please explain what the stealth build is? I have heard that mentioned before but the person didn't expound on what it was or how it worked. 
---
That'd be far to original an idea for a game of this standard
---
Yes I have seen players not get their max carry weight registered correctly and that the carry weight is now really unstable.
---
That pegged ps4 at 450k iirc.
---
But there is a caveat to that stat. Its only public profiles.
---
Atleast she gives good feedback. Instead of the same “thanks I’ll pass it along to the Devs” message over and over. If she sees this I think you’re doing a great job. It must be overwhelming to deal with thousands of people on a daily basis, ya know?
---
Yessssssssssss
---
Try 1000
---
is it a mutation?
---
If I still had my one silver I would give it to this comment. 
---
I thought that was it at first too. But then I waited for everything to load, unequipped and reequipped all perks, and no luck. It seems like there's some instability with it. After logging off and on multiple times, it randomly started working. 
---
So your uncle took photos of you. That makes sense. I can see how you’d feel obligated to send dick links to anyone who frightened you. 
---
But did he do it in a library? Is that what has you so afraid of words and reading? That’s the real question. It sounds like a real can of worms that we’re opening here, Ted.
---
Inventory management simulator. Way too much managing weights and inventory limits.
---
I don’t understand how they choose these paths of action. All of them are to the detriment of the player, it’s just frustrating. 
---
They really had something here, but it’s being mismanaged into the ground. 
---
With demo expert tier 5 you're still doing 60% more damage than if you didn't have the perk equipped. So it's not like your build is all of a sudden useless. Its just like any of the other perks for any ither gun they cap at 60%
---
Unless your auto grenade launcher was also two shot legendary you wouldn't be classified as meta-ing I was referring primary to the TSE (two shot explosive) users of the thread. 
---
No, they just don’t want us getting a lot of XP for some reason. They lowered the amount of XP per round from 350 to 150, too. And others are saying that only level 22 Ghouls are spawning when the event does spawn. 
---
Wasn't using that one, actually 
---
Lol if everyone was a real fallout fan like you Bethesda wouldn’t have fixed anything, they would continue to feed you shit and you’d lap it up

I feel you.  It's the industry itself right now.  FO76 isn't the only game that isn't compelling to play.  Problem is that people fork money over these titles and don't learn when they get burned or are too cool to admit when a game is just trash or are willing to do what I won't do anymore.  F076 is a good example but by no means it is the only.
---
 What a bullshit excuse for such piss-poor reasoning. 
---
I've just never got that notification before. My controller almost paid for there sins.
---
Metro Exodus is looking pretty good as well. 
---
You don't have to enter the high school to start it. Just stand at the door for a second and listen for the announcement about Halloween costumes and the Monster Mash event.
---
I've seen it pop a few times but went and did other things today instead of starting it.
---
You speak the truth
---
okay, cuz I cant find it at all now sadly
---
You aren’t getting my point at all. Thanks for your opinion though! 
---
If you're on pc i can help. Otherwise, good luck :)
---
I was just thinking that too. They'd really have a patch to put together if we all took a break
---
[Oh Bethesda, silly silly Bethesda... we know you (somewhat) tried but ultimately](https://makeameme.org/meme/You-fucked-up-rrwopz)
---
Are you sure that no one will ever want to buy my nocturnal walking cane as they peruse my wares?
---
Mutations are broken?  Is that why I can't jump high with Marsupial?
---
The only thing cool about the gunners was the gunner harness, but i still respect making a group 
---
Oof
---
Yes no. Character weight btw also clitched. Ppl noting that the max carry weight is not registering and it is switching up and down for no reason.
---
This stuff SHOULD be in the survival mode that’s coming out 
---
Ouch. The realness hurts 
---
Did you take serums to get mutations?  I think that gives a temporary boost to the positive part of the mutation. 
---
But can you rise up without praising Geraldo?
---
How much? Haven't been on yet
---
The only thing getting new content
---
And game devs are only allowed to nerf things people ask for... why exactly?  Of course no one asked for this nerf, the perk was ridiculously beneficial.  So beneficial that Bethesda obviously noticed how infrequently people were actually having to repair their armor and decided it needed to be nerfed.
---
How can you not believe it?  You blind?  People are just looking for an outlet, if it's not clear, a large portion of those that remained playing this game are really ticked off now after the latest patch.  
---
exactly how i feel.  i too live below the poverty level, less than 14k a year.  i live off my veteran's benefits and SSD, being a disabled veteran.  all the previous FO games have been excellent, up till now.
---
The bright headlamps are also showing as atom shop items. 
---
Thanks for just letting me know I’m crazy and this update has me questioning reality 
---
/u/kastrus as probably the only SWL player in this thread, WTF you saying. Funcom and SWL is the poster child of NOT dropping any new content, it is patently absurd you used this as your example! SWL NEVER had a good cadence of new content, at NO POINT was it even close to a decent flow. 
---
BTW I'm old as you, older, and also played Maniac Mansion on release. I bet I can remember what Atari games you have forgotten the names of :)
---
Now THAT would be a game I'd enjoy!
---
Yup bulk items now have to be removed and broken down individually, and mutations are glitched on Xbox1 😡
---
I've tried messages directly on reddit, but I'm gonna give twitter a shot and see how that works out.
---
This rhetoric needs to stop. It's not a bad engine. It just needs some work. Scrapping it altogether and moving to something new (or developing something new from scratch) would be a decade of down time during which no actual games are being developed.
---
The Creation engine does a lot of things better than *any* other engine out there. But some things it suffers long-standing issues on. These things just need to be addressed.
---
It comes back to your main point. It's not about the engine; it's not about the developers working on the engine; **it's about the leadership.**
---
Whoever is in charge obviously prioritizess what they perceive as "moving forward" over taking the time to fix long standing issues with the engine. If they switched to another engine, that attitude would remain, and we'd be no better off.
---
So please, stop blaming the engine.
---
And as a side note in the 20ish hops so far I've been stuck in an infinite load screen 3 times and disconnected within a minute of login twice. 
---
For the first time I'm genuinely on the fence about continuing to play, not because of this 1 thing but everything since release. Leaning to taking a break for a while and keep an eye on this Reddit to see if it ever becomes worth returning.
---
Isn’t Zenimax basically Bethesda?
---
I want it. We need it. This has revived my interest in the game. 
---
People complain about “greifers” destroying CAMPS but that is the result of the system Bethesda has put in place. Usually we can never find anyone who wants to fight so we starts destroying camps and workshops because it’s the only way we can get some pvp.
---
At level 100+ with max caps and meta gear the ONLY thing to do in this game is pvp. Without it there is literally nothing besides leaving up which after level 50 you can’t add any more specials anyways. 
---
PVP and PVE servers will give everyone what they want, we can go kill each other as we please and you can go kill AI and not be attacked by other players. Yes, there will still be people causing problems in adventure BUT it will be significantly less than there is now. I believe this is a very big step in the right direction.
---
Meh, this patch was a hyped one and it just ended up being the final nail in the coffin. I'm moving over to put my time into Monster Hunter World. They're celebrating 1 year of release with an **appreciation festival** that is for **appreciating it's fan base** 
---
What does that entail? The return of every single bit of free content they released over the course of the last year. Dozens of events for just free shit. All Month.
---
u/Ladydevann and u/LoneVaultWanderer, I summon you!
---
Why?
---
Nope, no serums. Have had these mutations on my toon for about a week now.
---
They’re past the point where this will work now. It would have in the initial month where people pointed out all the issues but were sticking it out. Those people were told to shut up constantly and move on because “I enjoy the game regardless, if you don’t you shouldn’t play it.”
---
Bottom line, if you’re playing at this point you’re moderately ok with anything Bethesda will put you through (count me in this number). If you are a target sales audience, the 30% or so who tries new games outside their niche, you jumped ship long ago and a “reboot” isn’t going to do anything .
---
If you want evidence of my point, I’d bet money there’s a counter thread to this within a week with a person praising how much fun they’re having 
---
They announce the nerfs weeks ago.
---
Anyone with a brain should have known that TSE weapons were absurdly out of line.
---
The nerf was a little heavy handed, but we're a lot closer to what it should be now than it was.
---
Maybe they're losing money and now tanking the game on purpose? I am playing right now and yea the bobby pins weigh 0.1 again for some reason but I haven't noticed any of the other negative changes so far. I am playing on my second character right now though so only on a level 8 character lol all I got is pipe weapons and a shotgun and a hunting rifle. 
---
Til I've been 1 shotting super mutants with obsolete gear
---
They broke mutations in this patch. They will go from what you have now, to not having any positive effects, to going back to normal. 
---
Fast traveling has been what’s breaking it for me. 
---
Not even useless, they’re still pretty good, just not hilariously OP anymore
---
Me neither, I noticed that and I just feel like I’m actually getting much more hurt than usual for being in a fully modded x01 that’s what spurred me to look and then I got confused 
---
I know the people here don’t want to accept it, but this is all still heading towards the f2p model, like it has been since day 1. Nerf resources, nerf damage, increase grind, buff bought items for p2w benefits.
---
&gt; by making things cost more, break more, or harder to get...you finally get to a comfortable play level, only to be thrown back down.
---
What game model relies on this as a core mechanic?
---
Lol, no...but do you by chance have a 2 star wooden leg??  Or 900 bone shards??
---
My understanding is that Class Freak reduces the negative impacts of mutations... and that serum-based mutations have no negative impacts. Is that not true?
---
For example, Marsupial acquired "in the wild" will reduce intelligence by four points. I got mine via an enclave serum and see no intelligence reduction. I don't have Class Freak equipped. Further, I *think* that if you take the serum for a mutation that you gained in the wild, it will permanently eliminate the negative side-effects.
---
I'm happy to be corrected here tho'! 
---
I agree completely. Their priorities need to change, and they need some foresight as to what's their 'balancing' affects. The nerf of demolition expert didn't just hurt TSEs, it also crushed every other explosive weapon that's already severely lacking, like missile launchers. Also don't bother trying to fight the scorchbeast queen right now. Me and a group of twelve level 90+s weren't able to take her below 75% in the half hour allotted.
---
I was, but a friend said Better Inventory was the problem for him. Better Inventory has been updated, though, so I didn't run into the problem from it myself. 
---
Have you updated your system software? 
---
Is your machine plugged in?
---
You can have 5 characters per account and as long as you have a friend (or a reliable way to get back to the server) you can transfer crap to them.
---
Literally it's crap.
---
I have no idea why people do it in this game. It's very common in MMOs and you'll sometimes hear "boxers" (two game clients at the same time), etc.
---
You don’t want to fight, they want to fight. No matter what someone is unhappy in the current system. 
---
Maybe I missed the first tape, but I interpreted it as the bombs having gone off, and no one crossing the bridge again.  So now it's tonnage reporting is forever stuck at some base value.
---
Either way, it was a surprisingly poignant, cynical moment for just being text on a terminal.  I don't know if there's a word for it, but I'm kind of fascinated by the idea of things that keep working long after their function is ruined.  One of the title screens in Black Mesa, the one with the crushing pistons in Residual Processing, gets me the same way.  Everything is destroyed, the facility is doomed, and yet the machine churns on.
---
It did actually go down like that.
---
If course I left out how when my rifle wasn't doing squat I switched to an explosive combat that only had a dozen shots before breaking. Pre nerf a dozen shots would have cleared out 75% of West Tek but today it was taking 4-5 shots to drop one level 68 Super Mutant so the f'ing thing broke with half a dozen Super Mutants and 2 hounds bum rushing me.
---
I turned the game off. This isn't a Fallout game......you don't run from anything in Fallout at level 123.
---
I lost my Enclave Officer's hat.  I was in Excavator PA when I logged in and when I exited it my hat was missing.  I also encountered an issue where if I logged out with the clown hat on in PA when I logged back in my PA helmet was not equipped.  
---
Aight you on right now?
---
Shhh, people don't like it when you tell them that. They say it takes work for Bethesda to put those in... Even though all assets exist in the files right now 
---
Pick flowers challenge is a whopping 40 points. Was broke last week so naturally they added it again (still broken) for this week. Someone messed up. 
---
Yep, I do the HW route, and a 50 cal will make A SB land pretty fast, and take him down the first time he does because he stays stunned and can't take off. They are an annoyance, not a challenge. 
---
[My reaction to the patch](https://makeameme.org/meme/You-fucked-up-rrwopz)
---
Player vendors was supposed to be added this patch.
---
The new patch made 21:9 invert the targeting reticle. It gets bigger not smaller the more accurate your weapon when on 21:9... sooo...
---
yeah I know, just so use to it always being available I just click on the door out of habit
---
Yeah, the game came out and I beat it. Twice with real different characters. Was doing a third and got bored plus that one was an attempted medic spec which isn't very proper in this game yet. 
---
Yeah content will be a big part but for me it's about cohesion. The idea that a multiplayer game is playable all the way through the end game and can be done solo defeats the concept of multiplayer. SBQ I have seen reports she can be solo'd. Not so far fetched I toyed her down to half health before my lack of add control got me. 
---
There has to be something between a random event 33 caps away and the end game materials. 
---
Needs more content. 
---
You clearly are not end game. My hardened messaged regular non legendary sniper takes 10-15 shots to kill a glowing enemy.  5 shots for glowing mole rats. That is unacceptable.
---
Expect to see more raiders now with this patch. 
---
Yeah. I think that ship has sailed.
---
I've never heard of this. Lol. Sounds like way more work than what it's worth. Thanks for the explanation 👍
---
It's really impressive how you propped up that straw man and then knocked it down in one fell swoop.
---
Crap, I didn't even think of that.  I know of 1 big time shop owner and 2 smaller shop owners this is going to kill.  Not dupers, they were trading in normal everyday items.  I bought a trap plan from one guy yesterday.  My friend found out that he could mod power armor, so he paid him for a few armor upgrades.  Another guy bought some ammo and meds while he was there.
---
Now they can't trade.  And Bethesda put all the power armor plans in-game.
---
So much for player trading.
---
**Not only did they not ADD content in the game, they found a way to REMOVE content in a patch.  Bravo \*slow clap, slow clap, slow clap\***
---
Bethesda doesn't give a shit about you and it's time you realize that.  
---
A new character you create strictly to hold items that would otherwise make you go over your stash and carry limit on your main character, usually so full of stuff that you can hardly move. Also used to hold caps if your main has over 25k. Some people have 4 mules completely filled with (usually duped) items and maxed caps.
---
Unfortunately, no. You cannot remove a mod from one item to put it in another.
---
Or everyone had the perks because the game that they designed would be less FUN without them 
---
Mines coming up on 12 days, yet for a less major issue. I got an automated replay the day after then provides two additional updates in later days to provide a bit more context thinking it would hopefully speed things up!
---
Currently now on my 'My Support' page the tickets says "Read answer provided". I hope this doesn't mean that my ticket is close due and I hope this (the automated answer) isn't only response I'll be receiving.
---
When Bioware has more communication and working with the community on broken things more than Bethesda. What a terrible timeline. 
---
That's been happening since last patch.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agixv2/ps4_watoga_weird_for_me_today_locks_and_reset_bots/
---
Just sit still for a bit. :\
---
Has to have 5-6 posts about the plan price increase before it got added to patch notes.
---
&gt;Bethesda is too cheap for hotfixes. That's why Consoles normally get patches a week later, so they can "hotfix" it then.
---
Are you fucking stupid, or are you one of those rare people who doesn't understand that patches have to go through a screening process before going live on consoles? They can't just push an update without getting approved by MS and PSN. 
---
1700 pounds doesn't mean you're a duper.  With stash limited to 600 people have been using alts to store extra junk/ammo/legendaries.  If they wanted it to affect dupers specifically they could have gone about it differently...
---
I’m not playing till they use this mentality 
---
I’ve had to re-log maybe 10 times tonight to get my mutations back, that coupled with 2 blue screens and 2 disconnects has made for a pleasant experience. 
---
Agree. My marsupial mutation quit working, the switch on my garage door doesn’t work, my carry weight seems to be RNG. Literally what the H-E Double Hockey sticks happened 
---
Fuck me.
---
That bug has been around for a while, it happens when a material is partly in your stash and partly in your inventory. Put it all in your stash and it should fix it.
---
Potato crisps and purified water!
---
The game is an utter disaster and has been since launch.  Best thing for people to do is stop playing and let the DAUs drop.  Send them a message. 
---
Neither will i fallout is my favourite title in gaming  honestly as much as it sucks if they are trying to squeeze it dry before selling the rights to a new studio i honestly think that would be for the best i want fallout out of bethesdas hands and in the hands of a studio who will actually put passion into the game like new vegas not a dirty profit sponge.
---
I left PUBG bc of incompetence, but now I'm just hoping they'll take me back
---
See you in 2 weeks when they actually fix the shit they broke. That was already fixed? But is now broke?
---
?¿?¿?
---
its a liberal company. this is why...
---
Bye. Don't let the subreddit hit you on the way out. 
---
I paid in real cash for the game. That was bad enough. 
---
Guys you are bring too hard on Bethesda seriously tired of all the bashing I am enjoying this game . Really getting sick of the level of disrespect 
---
I don’t think they have the tech or the skills to do this 
---
Of course they can't satisfy all of those people, but they could better indicate what playstyle they were looking to support so people could temper their expectations. The messages from Bethesda in that regard are currently all over the place.  From a sales perspective, that makes sense - keep it open and sell to them all. From a player satisfaction perspective, it's obviously going to be frustrating to a sizeable portion of the base.
---
You should be able to scrap the bulk at a work bench. If it still doesn't recognize the scrap try putting it in your stash and taking it back out a couple times. Worked for me, also ps4. Hope this helps
---
Is there currently any way to get shielded casual armor plans? 
---
Dear Fallout 76.
---
It's not me, it's you.
---
They should finish the game first.   
---
Thats the question everyone is asking.
---
Are you taking the piss?
---
Please, Bethesda? I have the day off and was super excited to play all day, but now that I've seen how much this patch broke, I have no desire to play. 
---
They wanted to sell fall out themed micro transactions and fo76 accomplishes that.
---
Does logging out and back in recharge power cores again?  
---
thank you &lt;3!

4. Basically, someone else's Bethesda Account is linked to my copy of Fallout 76. It's been like this since the B.E.T.A and Bethesda claims it's apparently not possible to transfer characters or entitlements to other accounts, and when I explicitly told them I didn't own the account linked to my Gamertag, they began stonewalling me and closed the support ticket despite the issue not being resolved, essentially defending theft of items and Atoms I EARNED AND PAID FOR

Bethesda, more like BethesdEA
---
Blah blah whine blah complain blah goodbye forever it's just a game dude chill out. 
---
No wonder my wood count went down to zero
---
They’d just abandon the game and shut down the servers. Hey presto, game they have your money for and they don’t need to support as a service. Which, lets be honest, can’t be dragging in much cash from ‘micro transactions’ because most of the suck and the rest are priced beyond reason
---
Please, just give us private servers and open modding! So many things might not be able to be solved by this but at least we would have plenty of modding content, less lag and connection issues and griefing issues by bored/jerkwad ppl, and a lot of distractions away from the frustration and stress that this trickle of patch problems and lack of official new PvE content is causing.
---
Yes I am
---
This. Rad worms messes up your mutations.
---
With this rollback to an earlier version , it’s evident that Bethesda’s A and B teams are working in bigger things. Welcome to a C team support future for Fo76
---
It may be a typo for casual, but what is the casusl sub? And if it is casual, what sub is that? Genuinely curious, not trying to be a dick? What sub am I on??
---
I'm glad. I weigh my self-esteem every day by checking my Reddit Karma.
---
&gt; Now they can't trade.  And Bethesda put all the power armor plans in-game.
---
RIP all the people who specialized in plans
---
On another note, there was an auction house I would often go to. Each week they would give away one special item in a raffle. Last week was an X-01 jet pack. This week was supposed to be a full set of ultracite power armour. Needless to say, the auction house has been “cancelled until further notice” as the organizer of it said. 
---
Juice head has actually been pretty in the middle I found with his fo76 reporting he doesn’t just bash the game like yongyea, I don’t know how much he really plays anymore but he at least seems hopeful that it can be turned around into something great 
---
Sad to see them roll back to an old version. 
---
I haven't had a chance to play. I'll try one more time but if it is truly back to crashing again, back to back. Then I'll rest it. Which is f fine. I have more games than time to play. 
---
Anthem is looking promising, hopefully it'll be the multiplayer that I enjoy with my friends. Destiny is tiring. I'm tired of paying out my ass just to play a game with my friends. 
---
Hopefully Bethesda will just allow the modders to fix this crap shot game into something worth playing again. 
---
I don't mind the nerfing. I'm used to that with destiny. But to bring back a buggier version to fix it, is unacceptable for a AAA game. This isn't their first game. This isn't their first Online game either
---
450+ hours... 1 character... 1 inventory... 
---
Yes the tse nerf effects players so much so that its difficult to farm mobs for materials, creates bored players who dont want to give up their mains and are looking down the barrel of hours and hours of leveling so they can respec. Basically a bunch of irritated players looking for fun, laughs, revenge, and easy player gained materials especially when we gang up for some good old 2v1,3v1,4v1 
---
My carry weight was 750 the entire night lol. What a clown show. 
---
They only way melee is *really* op, is a bloodied build, and that requires running around with like 40 hit points.. Even nerfed, a tse shotgun can easily manage to do 40 damage in the time it takes a melee user to charge into range. I may be able to get my unarmed damage up into the 1000-1500 range, but in any extended pvp, I'll lose to a guy with a gun more than I win.
---
all these break up letters, you won't be missed.
---
fair enough, but finishing also includes adding more content right? i completely agree though.
---
Upvote for 'clownshoes devs' lolz
---
&gt;I've been saying this for so long now. If they knew what a hotfix was we wouldn't have had the clusterfuck of duping issues we do now.
---
Again, you can't fucking hot fix on consoles. Everything has to be vetted by PSN and XBL before they let you launch a patch. Yes, it costs money, and yes it takes time.
---
Where’d you go, Ted? I’m not here to frighten you to the point of triggering your picture-linking defense mechanism. I’m here to help.
---
Considering everything that you’ve relayed to me, do you think it’s wise to continue playing a game so broken that it fucks you right proper, which in turn reminds you of your Uncle, therefore illiciting your need to defend him and thus the game as if you’re wrong to question it, and simultaneously frightening you away from written criticism of it?
---
You sure it wasn't removed again since today's patch was based on an older build?
---
1.1k
---
cancelled mine and got some switch games with the $, paid $20 for this so i'll just wait a few more months for it be at an acceptable level. hopefully NPC's as well. 
---
up voted.  
---
Just grab 1 cap
---
What does the AG do? I just wanna blow shit up...
---
So you're saying it takes *less* time for you to coordinate with a friend to help transfer or watch your transfer container, log out, log in on a mule to collect, and log back in to main (or have multiple consoles running with an alt account) than it would be to throw away unnecessary extra stuff and trade valuable loot?
---
I'd like to store more stuff, so I support stash limit increase, but what I'm saying is the whole "I need multiple mules with 10,000 plus inventory weight or else the game is dead" is nonsense
---
there are definitely spots that sometimes have mannequins and sometimes don't.  Camden park at the entrance, about half the time there is a mannequin looking at the sign.  beside where there is 2 or 3 scorched mixed in a bunch of those nuked corpses.  (seems like one of those scortched now spawns beside the bus instead, but that is a seperate thing all together)
---
Type "tcl" in console.
---
And assaultrons that spam head laser, enemy NPCs with unlimited ammo, using super sledge hammers, but drop a rolling pin...
---
Such a turn around from your views from not even a week ago 😎. Glad the koolaid ran out, sorry that the game finally beat you down. 
---
What the hell is wrong with power leveling in a game with so little content? This game takes every conceivable opportunity to waste your fucking time, and it gets worse with every patch. 
---
Yea, thanks for your empathy man I appreciate it. After giving it some thought I think I'm gonna quit this game, I enjoyed it while it lasted but I can't afford to put the hours into the game anymore, my holidays are coming to an end here in down under :P.
---
"calm down"  wow.
---
if you have mods update or remove them if they havent been updated today.
---
Bah, screw the game. I'm having fun now
---
I agree  this fan base is one of the most toxic 
---
There are items that I know and can build, but when I see the plans on a vendor it doesn’t have the (known) marker.
---
Not even ‘caused’
---
Regressed. Old bugs, some, very old bugs, are back
---
Bethesda happened.  
---
I hope Diablo Immortal isn’t a cash grab.  Micro transactions suck.
---
Oh no I submitted before I was finished
---
It was off for at least 6 months if not longer. 
---
$60 dollars will be missed next time they release a game. And any special edition or microtransaction $$$. That's the only thing they understand. Maybe you can buy a few thousand special editions to make up for it, and bury them in the desert like E.T. on Atari.
---
only thing they tried at, &amp; 100% successfully did with their uncalled for bullshit was push people to boycott the game &amp; not play anymore
---
HE NEED SOME MILK!!!
---
I agree completely :)
---
One simple thing they could do for new content:
---
AWOL Armaments - Hard but doable solo or in a group.  Kinda punishing on melee players when groups of handies spawn in.
---
Let them make SUPER AWOL Armaments (1 out of 4 times normal AWOL spawns) - Quadruple the health of the enemies, double the damage, 6 waves instead of 3.  But you get BETTER rewards like 3 star gear and more chance for a rare plan.
---
They could have one guy work on that for 1 week.  It's the same exact event, just changing the variables.
---
There's TONS of stuff they could do like that.  Instead we get hot garbage piles of patches with bug fixes (some of which players don't care about), nerfs (some not even wanted like White Knight), and small QOL fixes (they already had a MOD for known plans that works better than their feature).
---
Blowing “shit up” may be part of the activities depending on the job but we are gunners not raiders we take contracts and not grief if you join you will be able to blow stuff up but to bad people not innocent people and the good part is you’ll get payed for it
---
It didn't for me 
---
Oh yeah haha, it's crazy isn't it? I can't even look at Blizzard games anymore without feeling overwhelming pity for the players, to think that is what gaming is for so many people. It's like loot box slavery haha.
---
Only 24 people still playing. That's the only server.
---
Yeah I haven’t seen them for the past 2 weeks and not after the patch.
---
Careful, if enough people stop playing then it wont continue with new content or updates after awhile and will eventually shutdown.
---
It’s actually an old dupe glitch, they comeplety reverted all changes that were made last patch
---
Are you ps4? I’m up there and I’ve only had it happen once but was cool. Each on our wee peaks
---
What's your location?
---
50 is a bit of a stretch, TSE was only about 12x over a normal weapon. now they're about 2x more powerful
---
\&gt; No one asked for White Knight to be adjusted is an example.
---
Just because no one asked, doesn't mean it shouldn't be nerfed, right? Player feedback is very important but players generally don't give good feedback under certain conditions. E.g. if you are a White Knight user you are very unlikely to ask for it to be nerfed. If you invested signficant time / effort to obtain a TSE weapon you probably aren't going to ask for it to be nerfed. Really these things should have been better balanced at launch, before anyone has even had a chance to experience it so as to ask for a nerf.
---
IMO the real issue is lack of end game content. I'm getting weary of doing the same few things repeatedly after reaching level 50. Mainly launching nukes and killing the SBQ.
---
I'm also becoming weary of the lack of anything challenging to do. You can beat most if not all the content quite reasonably without using legendaries, without grouping up, and without using consumable buffs (bobbleheads, meds like psycho, magazines) - you just need a coherent / synergistic set of perks. 
---
no.
---
:-(
---
Was the only thing that made the relogging in bearable last time this was happening...
---
No way you one shotted those after the patch. /s
---
Anyone feel like Sherpa-ing an Xbox One player through the door three times? 😅 I have caps!... sorta 
---
Unless you do nothing but pvp, then they are all ears. 
---
&gt;And when you mix PVE and PVP players and force them to play together.
---
Sounds like a classic VaulTec sociology experiment tbh. Is that the true purpose behind the game?
---
Target margin too narrow... I wanna blow everyone up, who is not helping me blow everyone up... 
---
Shhhhhhhh 
---
Yeah they did a rollback not reallt an update 
---
I feel they are vindictive about players finding ways to circumvent the arbitrarily slow march of player progression in this game. Bethesda, build more content. If not, don't kneecap me for not wanting to have my time wasted at every possible turn. This game was already something of a tedium simulator, but it only gets worse with every patch.
---
It's from literally copy/pasting fallout 4.
---
This was definitely the last straw for me. I tried so hard to force myself to love this game, but after todays patch the game just seems to be getting worse.
---
The fact they were nearly universally trashing this game and never mentioning anything good shows how little I should care about them, because I like this game more than most I’ve played. I watched a few popular ones on this game after I had been playing for a bit, and if I actually valued what they said when buying I would have missed out on a generally pretty fun game. 
---
I take it you’re a youtuber, and are so self-important that you can’t comprehend a person finding out for themselves rather than basing their perspective off of your own views. Or maybe you just don’t know how to have ideas without being told - seems to be one of the two. Sorry to break it to you, but most people in life wont base their views off of some teen or kid in their early twenties. They just have shitty ideas they haven’t grown out of. 
---
Besides, all youtubers are incentivized to make inflammatory and polarizing ideas because that’s that’s gets them viewers. Usually children, from the people I talk to in game. 
---
Hmm damn. So damn long ago I guess I forgot. I do remember playing for free, and getting a permanent sub discount, but I guess I forgot the timeline.
---
That’s called “raiders” we are gunners 
---
“Screw the game.” Interesting. So as the game is representative of your uncle in your mind, you’re trying to tell me that he made you sodomize him too?
---
Where does the rabbit hole end, Ted? Where does it end?
---
Welp, there goes more CONTENT.
---
I didn't even know about this auction house.  Would've loved to go :(
---
A number of people on Reddit have reported Radworms now providing a 1.5% increase buff to all stats. Which is ironic considering everyone gets that disease like crazy! 
---
What level are you? 
---
I feel like Fallout 76 is Old Yeller and The community, and Bethesda is the kid with the shotgun. Every. Damn. Patch. 
---
I honestly doubt they have any kind of sane source control for the project.  The way the files are setup for the game engine don't allow for clean use of something like Git.
---
Not to say they aren't stuffing them in git, but their diffs would be a mess.
---
Damn. I’d have never known this existed.
---
ox&gt;17yo bitch streamers
---
Ah okay, I started thinking about it like that after I replied. I remember a lot of players complaining that with the nerf it's gonna be damn near impossible to defeat the SBQ and farm those nuke zones. Also, I see your Raider flair and gotta ask, are you also one of the bored players? Or just enjoy role playing as a raider?
---
Ah it only gave me an error for one and I just removed it but now I'm seeing updates, thanks! Hopefully this'll fix it...
---
And lead is most lightweight when you convert it into ammo.
---
You would think but no luck I guess
---
Naw, I'm in support of people being nice on reddit.

I keep losing my mutations effects. The actual
---
Mutations are still there, but I’ll lose the jump for marsupial for example, or I’ll lose the carnivore benefits. Nothing in particular had triggered this, as last time it happened I was building walls in my C.A.M.P.  Also, if I’m not losing my mutation effects, they are multiplying by 1.5. My jump is way higher, and my carry weight will
---
Increase to +30, while my carnivore mutation is giving me 3x the benefits. Only fix is re-logging. 
---
Constant blue screens in Whitespring. 2 tonight alone, over 50 this month according to my PS4 history. 
---
4x infinite loading screen tonight. 
---
2x server disconnects tonight. 
---
I was stuck in power armor twice tonight. Had to re-log to fix it. 
---
Have you checked to see you can make them now? we noticed they vanished afterword
---
You think a simple inversion is some kind of 'gotcha'? Your ass is a shitpost.
---
I provided a simple piece of feedback to an orator.   
---
Hmm.. so special stats and now mutations as well..intersting 
---
I have a strong feeling the persons made events didn't tried to finish those at least twice and/or on the next day. Like "seems it should work, screw the test runs, send in production". The whole mess with the majority of events being so smack-to-shits broken is somehow astounds me.
---
Releasing a somewhat mediocre multiplayer Fallout is worse than literally being lied to? Not just swapping out a bag for a slightly different bag, customers where advertised a game that *didn’t exist*. No Man’s Sky “Next” was what the game was originally advertised as, and it took *two years* to get the game to that point.
---
Diluted Stimpaks are a base of 20% and then 10%, so your numbers are the base that stimpaks have always been
---
Yes, I can still make them.
---
I feel like we've trapped ourselves in a loop
---
I mean when Beth is basically at this point trying to kill the game even more I cannot expect people to just sit and be ok with it.
---
My psn is my sn
---
I understand Blizzard can release their patches at the same time just fine. What makes them special? Oh, that's right, they aren't cheap. Please, call me names. It makes me giggle every time a Bethesda brown noser gets ruffled when I call Bethesda on their bullshit. Like you! :)
---
Wow, be proud! I'm jealous hah. I did a little extra spending today myself.  
---
I can't wait to find out the cap cost for the Neon Letters. I'vw started a "savings" for that as I collect cheaper plans on my list. 
---
THE CUCKOO CLOCK! Ive wanted that clock since before I even knew it was a plan lol 
---
Do it. I did. I am having so much fun knowing shit isn’t going to change and go down the toilet.
---
Ikr, this shit is bugged, its like i am playing without suppressors, sometimes it will feel worse than that
---
My guy is rocking camo fatigues with camo combat and scout armour. Also enjoying finding gear in the Wastelands but I'm not spending a dime on sparkly evening gowns or princess beds or toy chest inspired paint for PA. Even something as cool and RPish as the Atom Cats hotrod paintwork was cool, themed and zany enough to fit in. It was on sale for what? 24h?
---
Well... may our targets align!
---
I’m typically wary of micro transaction type games now too, FO76 being no exception. I remember the mod community from the original Doom being a blast, and free. Can’t wrap my mind around 15$ RL$ for an ingame costume.
---
I just removed BOTH copies of this game from my wife and my playstations. You fucked up bethesda. Game over. 
---
Lol I brought them from a player at that price long time ago.
---
You shouldn't give advice when you can't live up to it yourself
---
Yes, the explosive perk should be primarily for explosive weapons (like autogrenade, missile launcher, fat man, m79). Any benefit to the now 20% explosive legendary effect SHOULD be minor. The perk shouldn’t be based around one legendary effect. 
---
The sentry bot killed you before you could finish the post.
---
I play an automatic/explosive weapons hybrid build and don't really have too much issue with difficulty. I am stuck on the find tagerdy quest though .
---
Too many scorchbeasts xD
---
I said "If I find one", not talking about buying a duplicate. I read the patch notes. I'm saying I'd like to be able to SELL plans to vendors, because it's a waste to find them and not be able to just get some easy caps for it.
---
Hahahaha!  You do that.
---
However, any MP game that wasn't being run by complete muppets would already know that you were going to need to allow respecs in these situations.  And they'd already be available - not 'I can pass it along'.
---
Somewhat agree.
---
Farm the above mentioned location...at night tho. The blooms glow and you can see them a mike away!
---
You run Enforcer at all? There's a bit of the shotgun experience that's missing when it doesn't go something like "I aimed at a deathclaw at maximum draw distance and did no damage with both shots, but the thing ended up flopping around on the ground with all of its limbs shattered. A scorchbeast flew by and I crippled that, too. It ate the deathclaw and then stayed locked in place while I beat it with a bat for funsies. I received 1200xp somehow."
---
ohh, i did mine solo because i thought the more people there were, the higher level the enemies or there would be more enemies. thanks ! 
---
They announced pve content in march in the last inside the vault segment 
---
Best possible comment ha. Couldn't get a guaranteed spawn, think I'll have to aggro Whitesprings
---
i agree.  i actually have to keep a postie on my monitor that tells me when i can visit vendors again to unload my crap.
---
Sister company. Honestly things here are way worse than what eso was at the same time. It was a constant improvement every single patch and it still really hasnt ended. 
---
To be fair safes contain plans sometimes, which are now ridiculously expensive.  I'm with you on wanting some type of quick way to change perk loadout.
---
Yeah, my interest was already in freefall pre-patch. After seeing the shitstorm on the sub today, im not gonna bother updating this one.
---
Perfect timing too, needed to make room for RE2 :)
---
Damn a thread complaining about no content and Bethesda explains that content will come in 2019 but repeat the fact that they are delaying content while they stabilize and improve the core game... AKA bug fixes. Yet somehow you are gonna bitch about "How about fixing the fucking bugs first?!"... The fan base here on reddit really is spectacular.
---
It's easy to fanboy when the core game is just *fun*. Deep down, past all the bugs and crashes and ATOM store bullshit, the game is straight fun to play. But they keep fucking things up, over and over, and it makes playing the game more and more tedious. No reason to support that shit any more.
---
the fact that dogmeat is no where to be found.  :-(
---
Do you think 1 new character is even close to the amount of work of a DLC? Also ,"every 3-4 months" looks like we haven't even hit close to that production schedule being day 77 since release.
---
 By you own account they are delivering at a production rate equal to OW. They already announced pvp survival mode next month. 
---
62. Was it you, raider scum?
---
Unfortunately now the Shielded lining plans just got a whole crap ton more valuable with all of the PA plans becoming worthless vendor pieces.
---
Good luck man :)
---
No worries man your post basically said everything that came to mind today when I logged on. I may come back eventually myself but honestly right now I'd rather take a break, binge some shows, maybe even play the Anthem demo this weekend than spend another minute farming XP to be able to switch a special point every hour or so
---
I'm mainly a PvP player.   Absolutely love the strategy and teamwork that goes into raiding bases or whatnot in other games.  There is none of that in this game.  
---
This game is so sad that I actually feel bad for those that defend it with all their heart.  These people are desperately trying to see the good in the game but bethesda keeps spitting in their face.  
---
You feel like bethesda isn't listening to you? Stop playing, drop the DAUs, and force them to listen. 
---
same, just over 500 hrs and am still usually 100 under my stash limit and 40-80 under my personal carry weight.
---
What a fucking joke lmfao
---
Amazing! It's boxy and still amazing! Keep em coming 
---
Did you shoot back at a naked level 20 punching you? If yes.... Sorry
---
I went back to F4 yesterday and boy was it relaxing
---
Game really needs a reboot with characters/lots of side activities/ endgame / social aspect. Its so barebones it hurts. Dont understand what people do to entertain themselves for 400 plus hours.
---
Yep, totally agree. It’s a fun game, can’t deny it. I just think the bar is set higher these days and you can’t do what BGS has done here with 76. 
---
Enemies don't actually have much health, the problem is armor.
---
Armor degrades weapon's damage based on the ratio of damage to armor, meaning weapons with low base damage do even less damage, and rof does not matter.
---
I did the math earlier, the difference between a minigun dealing 14 damage and a gatling gun dealing 79 is that it takes 25 bullets from the gatling gun to exceed the damage of 500 rounds of minigun against an enemy with 100 armor, and a minigun dealing 28 and gatling gun doing 158 the difference against an enemy with 55 armor is still 500:42, and that comparison dramatically favors the minigun as the armor is less than the gatling gun's damage reducing the value of that armor by a huge margin. 
---
That is why TSE was OP, multiplying your damage by 4 reduces armor effectiveness by a factor of a bit less than 4, meaning you deal close to 16 times more damage in best case where enemies still have more armor than the damage of your gun, and at worst it's still about 6-8 for most weapons.
---
On launch day no less...
---
Why create a bigger mess and make the other cups full? When only a couple cups are overfilled? More inst always better. Nerfs are just as necessary as buffs. 
---
You can get the plan for Marine. As far as I know, the plans are both still named `Plan: Dense Combat Armor`  and you just have to find the right one. You can't tell them apart.
---
None of the plan guffaws were fixed. "MissLe" is still spelled incorrectly, Robot Arms is still Robot Right Arm, etc.
---
They hire the modders, the modders bring new ideas and motivation to fix everything, and then the modders get buried under the same awful leadership and glacier speed decision making that the current devs are buried under... the modders, doing what they do now, away from Bethesda are in the best place they can be unfortunately...

Just moved out west to the banks of the Ohio River today, will share that one when it's done. I get bored easily and I love rebuilding - I do it once or twice a week.

Rarity/cool factor mostly.  It's a pretty decent gun, but the hype will die down very quickly now that it's easily accessible.
---
Thanks! :)
---
Ok I’ve read all the  comments here and you want someone to tell you what issues and problems with this game and this is me I’ve heard of the same shit happening to other people let’s start out with this I was moving things around from stash to character moved it but didn’t see it on my character so I thought ok maybe it it went to the bottom the list nope those mother fuckers where gone  shall I keep going  I’ve had  load one of my character up and nothing was in there not even my misc was there no holo tapes or some of my rare plans the plan thing wasn’t the frist or last time either I’ve lost more cool and rare stuff on this game that I truly love to play just because I’ve been down with fallout since number 2 way back when the story telling was more important then a profit because people knew of the game was good they’ll tell other people and so on and so on but now they push out a half broken shit covered lollipop and tell us it’s a fudge sickle like most of you I still take a bite and say damn this tases like shit and continue to eat it because we are waiting for it to get better we’ll y’all bitched so much this is the game now it was not this bad in the first few weeks of it coming out the dupping never bugged me  the glitches kinda did but i managed through even when my 3* instigating lever action dropped through the world and you bitched about tse being over powered now there not powerful enough well this is the bed we made now we get to sleep in so let’s  pray to whatever god or devil  pray to they  really have another falllout game  that brings it back to the game we all fell in love with and fix this fucking abomination to stand tall like the other games did as for the issue I’ve had there is more but I’m going to eat my shit sickle now 
---
             Hope the waste is not forgotten 
---
This has always been true except for lead and aluminum.
---
I logged on to find that my X01 Purple Headlamp was now marked as Atom Store. I bought the mod from the MODUS terminal though...
---
This is not new, and has been widely known for a while. There's only one or two things that see a slight weight reduction from bulking.
---
I wanted to play with pistols.  Now that the tse is gone, and having no perks for armour reduction for pistols I guess it's back to dying repeatedly every several mobs.
---
Almost 300 hours here, havent needed a mule either
---
H1z1 was a trainwreck for most of its early phase, even separating its game in to separate parts ripping off people who had already paid for 1 half and not giving them both even though they paid for early access. They have definitely come a long way, but their game is much simpler I'm design than fo76 and pretty shallow imo. That said, i had a blast playing it for a short time.
---
At 250 levels above most enemies I should be able to one shot them. 
---
I bought my brother 76 for Christmas (he is a huge fan of the series). And he has yet to play the game because he's watching from the sidelines. 
---
This thing isnt mediocre its now unplayable and players are leaving in droves. Also they did straight up lie about what this game was.
---
Ayyy good luck with the nightmares man lol I'm going to get it this weekend but holy hell did that game terrify me as a kid
---
This. 
---
Bulked items do not scrap properly/don't count out of your stash. You must physically remove the bulk, scrap it, then it's ready for use.
---
Yeah I run Enforcer, that's why I aimed for the Deathclaw's leg the first spawn haha.
---
 Also just killed the Deathclaw, he charged me so it was point-blank and blew his head off. 
---
I really don't think this nerf was SO bad, I mean some guns got hit harder than others but this one is still alright
---
Yep! Here's hoping it now actually matters.
---
For most people, doing 1400 damage plus Assassin's plus chems even with 50% penalty.... it didn't really matter.
---
Game is worse than 76. Enjoy 
---
Alright, I'll be happy to take care of that for you. Please send me all of your sensitive personal information and I will get that refund processed.
---
Real talk, I wish they would make the entire game about this kind of experience.  Make it a co-op hack and slash type experience where you run around in the Fallout universe with zany weapons and crazy outfits blowing up randomly generated Legendary monsters and the minions for ever increasing silly loot.  Add back traditional raiders to make the world feel less lonely with some new combat dialog.
---
The focus on pvp and survival is a dead end.  There are other games that do it so much better.  Even if they do manage to get the mechanics figured out, the engine itself is so dated compared to competitive shooters.
---
Todays patch rolled back everything they had planned at minimum 2 weeks, even if they hit every problem at full sprint and had a proper roadmap and knew what they were doing. (ps: they dont) 
---
Dont be a shill, the game is fucking awful, its rate of production is god awful, and it's so fucking broken right now, people are calling for a change of development leadership. As they should, this thing is a shitshow and a whole slew of people should be fired. 
---
This is a conspiracy theory. But it makes me wonder why they waited until the update to release the patch notes instead of releasing the day prior (like they usually do). 
---
I just wonder if they planned to roll back to kill something bigger... 
---
It's possible to solo the silos (solos?) with non-TSE weapons.  I never had one.  Just a troubleshooter lever action and a normal handmade mostly.  I'd just imagine the TSE made it trivial.
---
Scorchbeasts only need better loot, and a fix to the rapid-fire screeching.  The splash damage and toxic cloud penetrating cover don't need to be changed because that's what makes them deadly in the first place.  
---
If you remove that, then they'll be a joke. They're supposed to be somewhat challenging, if not annoying enemies because of the whole scorched plague wiping everybody out, and them being dreaded animals of the region.
---
Lol I don't think so, don't know what level they were, it was all happening so fast. I remember a giant cat head that had a power fist and a space man I think. Fuck, it sounds like I was just using some Jet and it's all a hallucination. 
---
Hey i said "someone say overly positive things about bethesda to make them show up" and here you guys are!
---
What have they lied about? 
---
my friendlist was åpretty dead today too. :(
---
I'm getting this too. This is a huge pain and breaks the whole crafting system :&lt;
---
Sure thing, just let me go look through that bethesda information leak, Im sure you're info is in there too. Or did we forget about that as well? 
---
Its been here since day one... They dont care.
---
I see. You mean to say that it’s a vicious cycle. Your uncle sodomizes you, you’re commanded to sodomize him; he takes pictures of you in a library, you swear off the written word; a broken game release onto the market and fucks you like a right fancy whamen, you picture your uncle and are compelled to defend it; someone criticizes it, you’re afraid to read it.
---
I think we have a handle on your conundrum, Ted. A harrowing ordeal indeed. My advice is to stop playing- like everyone else has- and find a game less “uncle-ish.” Maybe RE2- unless the 9ft Tyrant stomping after you drudges up even more repressed pain.
---
Glad I could help. Please respond further if you need more therapy 👌🏻.
---
There's a Responder vendor that can spawn across the tracks from Charleston Station, behind a little broken-down shack, with some eyebot bodyguards and a moomoo. He had the cuckoo clock, along with the Nuka clock (and the red and green ski outfit).
---
Glitch central. Xbox One. Negative mutation effects are no longer negative. Marsupial now gives me plus 4 strength instead of minus 4 strength. Hahahaha what the holy eff. Also Bobby pin weight is back up. Bethesda. What are you doing?? I literally have no negative effects from any mutations. Shut servers down immediately and fix this dumpster fire. 
---
Scroll to the bottom of that computer screen and it should let you initiate launch.
---
/rant sorry for being a bit dramatic I’m just so let down by one of my favorites it kinda hurts :( 
---
You mean the youtubers? 
---
theres a terminal above that you do that on.
---
Probably the dupers fault.
---
Man, y’all getting downvoted to hell just cause you can make do without hoarding? Well, I’ve also got at least 100lbs of free weight when I’m not out gathering supplies or stuff to sell. Fuck me, right? How dare I?! 
---
Props.
---
Focusing some of the team's labor on content, and some of the team's labor on bugs.............is also a thing.
---
It's not like there's one frazzled coder sitting in the basement pulling his hair out.
---
There's a team.  Take X number of people to work on content.  Take Y number of people to work on bugs.
---
Problem solved.  Management 101
---
Highly recommend Persona 5 if you haven't played it yet.
---
Should be still less than carrying X material raw no?
---
No. Bethesda just doesn’t know their audience.
---
Cool. I post this before this post and get virtually no attention.
---
Cool.
---
Almost every patch note has included lies, including thiw one... Half the stuff they said was changed wasn't
---
Wasn't you then. My level 20 friend thinks hes a badass running around naked with 2 level 120 X01 bastards behind him, if he gets into a situation we and it. 
---
&gt; I love how their reasoning behind it was to not make White Night a "mandatory pick". It wouldn't be a mandatory pick if armor didn't break every five minutes without it. Maybe Bethesda should finally get the point we've all been trying to make that armor and weapons break way too fast without these perks.
---
It’s pretty obvious the nerfs in this patch were put in place as a lazy alternative to fixing the bigger problem... which is this is a game centered on looting and scavenger but that actually punishes you for looting and scavenging... 
---
Oh servers unstable because too much shit spawned in the game? Well then lets nerf some carry weight related settings, nerf a few perks that bolster weapon durability, and then nerf damage on some stuff so it takes more of it to cause damage which makes it break faster so the player is now forced to constantly have to repair it which will help regulate per player carry capacity in the game because now their need to collect junk will be offset by weapons and armor that break much faster!
---
GENIUS!
---
Your friends sound like crybabies and quitters to me - real fans would understand what Bethesda did and appreciate them trying to better balance the game.  FO76 is easily one of the most casual and easy mode online games - yes it has bugs, and griefers and useless PvP.  I could see hardcore Fallout fans leaving cause of the stupid griefers and PvP though.
---
That's 9 cents per hour of entertainment. And these people say they were scammed. Holy fucking shitbags bro.
---
I should go do that. I have it, but havent finished it. Thanks mate. 
---
It's like they don't want you to play.I play games since the 90s and never seen such a disaster of a game. 
---
p2w is about being able to pay money for upgrades that affect gameplay. This is exactly that. 
---
The smarter move would have been to take somewhere with a lead pile,  stand around for an hour killing shit with a stick and making bullets the old fashioned way. The ammo factory has been a bust for ages.
---
But okay. Enjoy.
---
I'm getting this too, its so awful
---
Problem is TSE was just waaaay out of line.  If everything one shotted everything then fire rate is all that differentiates them.  Two Shot and Explosive just need to be exclusive rolls from each other and the damage could have stayed where it is, its the combination of both + explosive perks that was ridiculous. 
---
It's definitely not as bad of a nerf as people are making it out to be. Shotguns have always worked this way and the TSE nerf ..... Well, they still work pretty much the same if you aren't shooting the floor and have skeet shooter.
---
The freaking ripper
---
So glad its not just me. 
---
add to that "hard bargain"  and you power thru that 200 cap limit with just a few junk items.
---
I'm getting this problem too, this needs to be fixed ASAP
---
I have been in several queen events and since the tse and demo has been nerfed soo badly, 3 out of 4 queens we didn't even kill because no one can do damage unless the queen glitches and stays on the ground for 5 minutes at a time. When you nerfed everything you can hardly even solo anything now! I know of at least 4 people who just quit this game today after this patch. I have no idea how many quit across the world. So thank you beth for ruining a game taking more away then actually fixing stuff.
---
How is 1400 caps one endgame item...?
---
The only plans for anything you could really call endgame are big PA plans and Serum plans, which are ~6k and ~20k respectively.
---
Wait...Why are you people trying to STILL play this game?
---
Nice. Ill make it a mission haha
---
That did it. Thank you. 
---
this is fucking hilarious 
---
Pvp survival mode, the mode that about 6 people wanted.
---
Its literally servers where they turned off the slap damage. Im not sure how its taken them this long.
---
Ftr, nobody would be mad if there was actually an endgame in the game.
---
If you think that sbq or whitespring farming are endgame activities. Then boy would you love literally every other game that has ever existed.
---
Actually it doesn't have anything to do with Family settings. Under your setting there is a section labeled My Home Xbox.
---
It lets you change whether the Xbox you currently are on is your home console or not. (You can only do this so many times a year)
---
The way it works is. Your Home Xbox has the rights to all your content and gold subscription. So does your account when connected to the internet. So someone one your home Xbox can play your games and use your gold to get online while you get online via another Xbox. 
---
"Transferable" media includes gold and game pass subscriptions and digitally owbed games and videos.
---
*Some* of those duplicates can *sometimes* be quite useful though since it allows you to "downgrade" a Perk in case you run out of points on a SPECIAL stat. A lower ranked Perk card is sometimes better than not having that perk at all.
---
k
---
yeah, "clean" versions?  not really.  i compared many of the clean to the unclean, and they look all the same.  sorry i got suckered in to buying a "clean" version.
---
They drop them for their "Main" accounts and sell them that way
---
Nice. I'll make it a mission haha
---
It’s 1200/day, the 200 is per faction. That’s just shy of 8.5k caps a week per character (42k per account), not counting the ones you find by playing.
---
I get the frustration with the cap and think it could be done better (1200 per faction on a weekly reset, for example. Same end result but those who can only play one good session a week aren’t screwed) but the cap is in place to extend the duration caps are useful. 
---
Haha. Im enjoying all the false equivalences that people have replied with. People have played this game for hundreds of hours and still feel like they got screwed over the second they don’t like something. 
---
I think that PTSs will greatly benefit them since just testing in a small space won't really do much for the game.
---
Even with the nerfs, I was with a group that took down the Queen this AM in about 5 minutes.
---
Best part? She never dropped loot.
---
This game deserves to die.  Period.
---
Thanks for your experiments. I had similar experiences today in Appalachia.
---
I don't have any TSEs to try out but do/did have a nice explosive combat shotgun. When I went for my normal shopping trip today to Watoga BOS, I saw that the vendor robot was being picked on as usual. I pulled out the shotgun and before, the 3 or 4 robots clustered together would all die in unison. This time, wow, barely dented them. Awkward! Pulled out my trusty Black Diamond and then they all went down in the usual 2-3 hits...I never needed any shotgun damage perks or explosive damage enhancing perks before...but if I still want to use the shotgun, I might have to actually use the perk cards! :)
---
I also have a Two Shot Hardened Combat Rifle (not explosive) that I use as my normal sniper rifle. The damage numbers looked really bad, but near my home is a regular supply of super mutants. They all went down with about 4-5 shots each, which I think is just one extra shot each.
---
This is going to take some getting used to but I so much prefer not playing in over easy mode. Of course, would have preferred to start like this...
---
Deus Ex is the first game I ever got on PC, Mankind Divided is the 4th game but 2nd chronologically. It has a cinematic to catch you up and you can explore a beautiful rendition of Prague. It's an RPG and is terrifically written. If you're on PC play the original. It's the best fps ever made 20 years later.
---
Morrowind is the third elder scrolls game, all of which are set in Tamriel. ESO is a multiplayer (think WOW more than 76) prequel set 700 years before Morrowind but you can actually go there to quest and see what the map of Morrowind looked like during the 2nd era.
---
It's pretty fun if you're looking for something new.
---
I've got a nice shotgun build but I took until level 30ish to actually figure out what I was doing so most of my weapons are used with limited perks. I've basically ended up with several different weapon perks and different guns. I'm not a one shot god, but it keeps the heart racing and the game interesting
---
Until that "new content" is fallout 5 (OFFLINE SINGLE PLAYER), or and offline single player mode for 76 with NPCs and things to do besides eat, drink, cook, and repair... No thanks. I still can't believe bethesda failed so hard with bad ideas. 
---
You should be ashamed of yourself man.  After 5 downvotes I’m about to delete my game because I’m clearly some kind of a goon.
---
Pretty sure the brick building set increased in price.  I paid about 380 caps a few days ago and saw they were over 1k now...
---
solution is to make it like diablo 2, just put 3 level (normal,nightmare, hell style) of worlds and reach a certain level or finish certain quests to unlock next level. you can,still hang in previous level but only get very little xp compared to your leveling requirements.
---
I have really enjoyed the game and have over 100 hours in it. I however haven't played the game in about a month. It is a slap in the face that they make these arguably unnecessary balance changes while so many other things are broken and have been broken since beta. I might honestly wait till they open up the game to mods before I play again because at least that way things will get fixed. 
---
You know, I play Graveyard Keeper more than I play this, so I'm not sure where this fantasy of yours keeps stemming from. 
---
I often hear the **bUT iTs OnLy CoSmEtiCs"** line, even though the vusual design elements of a game used to come with the initial $80 purchase.
---
When I first opened a loot box in Battlefield 4 to get some random red dot sight for a random gun I think i died a little bit inside.
---
I looked at today’s patch notes, what exactly have they lied about? 
---
The caps stash thing is like the final straw for me. I'm going back to Red Dead Online. Will get some more hours into Horizon Zero Dawn. I have plenty of other things to play and I don't need this BS.
---
The assultron head uses all your ammo in one shot, with out the damage of each ammo. Thats not shooting as well as any weapon. Thats worse than all other weapons. 
---
???  Nah the audience dont know their own shit.  Games what they said it would be (Buggy as shit though, not talking about that)  Everyone ignored every word that was said about what the game would be and convinced themselves its FO5 and online.  
---
How does it work. Need to know in case of rollback. Done playing this game fairly. Tired of being jerked around.
---
Well when they release patch after patch that adds more and more bugs that make this game harder to play, fuck yes I'll bitch that they're making a broken game even more broken. If I'm going to be stuck at an infinite load screen, what the fuck good is new content? 
---
These aren't CM's, you know that right? These are youtubers Bethesda hired to respond to questions on reddit, also known as subreddit admins.
---
And yes, it's just becoming funny. Apparantly lag etc 'have to be passed on to the devs' because they never notice how broken this game is.
---
I run marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction and healing factor on all of my characters regardless of build.
---
Is there any game company that does hotfixes on console for trivial, non-emergency fixes? I only ask because I don’t know of any, and am curious if any do or if it’s basically industry standard to release larger updates.
---
What? They aren't "banned", they were nerfed, hard. So you probably shouldn't bother spending 2000 caps on one because it won't be any better than most guns already are.
---
Nice mob-inciting rhetoric.
---
Personally I’m waiting for payday and I’m probably gonna grab resident evil 2, haven’t picked up rdr2 yet but I’m waiting for a sale for that. I hope we get more outer worlds news soon 
---
Is it possible to get a refund for reading this post?
---
Exactly.
---
Good luck OP. On one of my tickets they straight up never responded. I got a canned response, and I had a follow up question because it made no sense, and they never responded back it just got closed on its own. The only tickets they actually responded to was about technical issues / performance &amp; visual bugs related.
---
That proposed change would definitely help, but it's also more about them raising prices because of the extent that dupers screwed the economy to.
---
As a long time Fallout and Elder Scrolls lover, today is a very very sad day
---
This is the kind of stuff that forces them to listen.  Stop playing and make the DAUs drop.  If they pull the plug then fuck it it was broken anyway.
---
Going forward BGS needs to stop messing around.   It's no longer cute that your games are always buggy.   It's no longer funny that "iT jUsT WoRks", it's no longer acceptable that your game graphics look like they've been ripped from a 90s game.  You're one of the biggest studios in the world  and it's about time you act like it. 
---
Bethesda employees: No one gives a damn that you comment on the sub.   Stop insulting your customers and just fix the game.  Seriously.  If fucking Hello Games can fix NMS with their limited resources then you have absolutely no excuse. 
---
So... Bungie has struggled with this for a while with Destiny because its a balancing act between PVE and PVP, which despite ups and downs, they do really well.
---
When D2 came out, there was a ~6mo blackout where players abandoned ship and Bungie kept making minute incremental changes that no one wants. It wasnt until they started listening and implementing community voiced changes to legendaries, TTK and DLC/lorethat things improved.
---
The key is to have an ear to the ground and give users what they actually want, not what you think they want.
---
To your point, somebody somewhere will be unhappy with a tweak or change. However, if your player base is begging for features or functionality, you best make it happen or there will be a mass exodus. There are too many games that could replace this one in a player’s library.
---
Dude. Wittiess reply ive read in a long time. Thank you to the both you for putting a smile on my face
---
And since most of these problems seem apparent to a majority of us players...and not the devs??
---
&gt; What a joke. I fucking love this game, but it really just feels like they're nerfing everything in an attempt to slow progress and stretch our playtime longer.
---
Or in the case of this patch, to cause shit to break faster so you have to repair it more frequently which will keep stash and carry weight limits in check.
---
And honestly if you have a Str build and use makeshift warrior 5 your melee weapon cannot break. I used my anti armor moleminor gauntlet for 2 weeks before it broke because it forgot it had durability. 
---
Question about Healing Factor(sorry to derail the thread) but if I take -any- damage. Is this supposed to kick in to heal it? Or do I have to use a healing item? I really can’t tell if this Mut is working.
---
I wish I could play Borderlands 1-2 again for the first time. Pick your build well. Some enemies are tough but fair.
---
I will never understand why this wasnt the solution. Both effects are great and have their own drawbacks. Just dont let them be stacked.
---
Not sure I can play this game anymore. I loaded in to a black screen (new usual for me) and when I hit quit I got an infinite load screen quitting back to the main menu!!! Wtf. My husband and I spent the entire time we played this evening making jokes like "Loadout 76" for the endless load screens, trying to find the person that was invisible, and laughing at the legendary enemies that would bug and sprint away from me, not him, just me. It was only funny for a while, but then it got boring and then frustrating. I won't be playing anymore. If I check back and learn they fix it than great, but not like this.
---
Luckily my favorite ccg (Gwent) is getting an awesome content and qol patch this week. Good luck guys. Hope to have a reason to play again!
---
Mmm closest I can think of was blizzard for overwatch early on but I could be remembering wrong. 
---
I spent a good twenty minutes looking at my snapshots through loading screens and staring at my Pip-Boy, then spent a good 5 in an animation loop at an armor workbench.
---
Please, it’s annoying to revolve a build around something, just to have it get nerfed to the ground and have to level up all over again just to switch builds
---
I'd have to check the dates and the entries but it seems like too much trouble.
---
I haven't been there, have to check it out. We live in a world increasingly like that, automation sans humanity, so I appreciate that in a world without NPCs, 76 can do a very specific, yet broad, social commentary.
---
Anytime buddy
---
Not here 
---
As a fellow VATS  stealth based shotty boy I am also happy for the Concentrated Fire change; still leveling and finishing my character though.
---
It’s not the patch! Just want to make clear this was a known glitch beforehand, I actually played it yesterday with a friend and saw a legendary and a few stragglers. Sometimes it just happens, but making it clear that it isn’t from the update
---
Speaking of Hello Games,i now have even more respect for them ! If a smaller company managed to get their asses and make a good game out of garbage ,why can't Bethesda do it ? Why does a company with such experience put their customers through this shit?
---
This is the studios first game as a Bethesda studio, fo76 wasn't made by the main team behind fallout 4 and skyrim in Maryland 
---
Fo76 is made by Bethesda Austin who used to be battlecry studios 
---
I 
---
Energy weapons have been broken since launch.
---
Let’s explore that. So necrophilia was another machination that your uncle thrust onto you? Tell me more. How did that make you feel?
---
Fuck that was good lol
---
I played for about an hour before I uninstalled. 
---
It shouldn’t take multiple shots *with a TSE*, *and* all three rifleman perks, to kill a Super Muntant in the Toxic Valley.
---
How in the fuck can a fully upgraded gun, with 3 max level perk cards, with two legendary effects, *not* one shot an enemy that’s 134 levels below me? 
---
GG Bethesda. 
---
Haha, it scared the shit out of me too!
---
Dude its so bad ass, they did an awesome job on it all around... Definitely cant complain about ammo scarcity or bullet sponges in fo76 now :) good god, some zombies will just not die
---
Apologize in advance for going off topic everyone.
---
&gt;and took the game offline after a number of in-game events ushering in an apocalypse ("hey, a red star. hey, that red star was a little smaller last patch, wasn't it? alright it's definitely getting bigger. here it comes. oh god why is it opening up")
---
Players that had their characters sleep in inn rooms would also sometimes have their characters experience dreams relating to it, and toward the very end you could hear Answers softly playing in the background. The end of 1.X was expertly done.
---
You can DM me an email or I can send it through WeTransfer, whichever avenue you prefer. 
---
Rad worms for you, rad worms for me, rad worms for EVERYBODY!
---
I'm retaining an internet lawyer and he says this patch may be a game felony HOPE YOU LIKE PRISON, TODD.
---
Soo.. I hate to  be the bearer of bad news, but I found the reason they are ignoring you. They dont allow mods right now. 
---
Hey only 147 but keen 
---
Interesting. Perhaps lowering the amour rating of enemies will do more than buffing the other legendary effects
---
You were wrong about the queens. Turns out you don’t have to use the tse as a crutch if you’re not terrible. Who knew?
---
This guy fucking gets it. I come here for general information about game mechanics that may be hard to find elsewhere or without lots of trial and error. Sometimes I find it, but it's not easy with the high volume of rumors, opinions, conjecture, and argument. Most of it is low on information and I find that I enjoy the game more when I pay less attention here,and not just because 'ignorance is bliss'. 
---
With all due respect, this \*is\* Bethesda's reputation.
---
I'm a huge fan and totally not prone to getting mad about buggy games, etc. But this is starting to lose me.
---
What do you mean, let your feet do the talking? Can’t say I’ve ever heard that saying. 
---
Yes!
---
Correction let your wallet do the talking and buy another game. The division 2 and anthem both look promising. Suck it bethesda. 
---
Oh that sums it up perfectly. Hats off
---
Yeah, I am like 90% the fourth one with a dash of the third thrown in for spice.
---
You are living in 3019.
---
Yes.  How long did it take for you to read it
---
&gt;I just don't see how Bethesda can make everyone happy.
---
They can make everyone relatively *happier* if they'd stop reintroducing bugs and breaking features when they patch the game, which is what they did today. Completely apart from spectacularly obvious misjudgments in their attempted re-balance — which, as you point out, were bound to annoy at least some folks — today's patch is a shameful disaster, because they found a way to make the game *worse for everyone*. 
---
Lol how would that even happen? You can't (successfully) sue someone for selling something that you wanted. Especially when both parties had no idea they would be nerfed this hard.
---
Wait what? even before the nerf, with maxed commando, 4 of 5 demolitions, max tank killer, and a TSE handmade, my fight with a scorchedbeast queen fight was laughable. Literally started laughing after the first mag dump on it. After about 1000 rounds her health was like 1/16 gone and it took almost the entire time. It seemed so ridiculously impossible to take her down with 5 of us that I never even tried again. How are people doing this?
---
Had exactly the same issue in a previous patch, so it's not new. I forget how we fixed it. Addiction maybe?
---
Imagine you just lost 50+ hours of grinding, and then when you post about in the "complaints and issues thread" you get immediately put down to -2 and get a nasty reply from someone telling you to 'go play somethong else'. 
---
I'm just baffled that there are living, breathing human beings getting riled up by genuine criticisms about F76.
---
Yea I dont think Bethesda has that high on thier to do list. 
---
today I was unable to pick a level 3 lock. I put on all three cards, and it said my level was 1. what kind of bullshit is this?
---
The first time I fought a windego I was level 17 and the windego was a glowing 47. I was doing the windego cave mission.
---
It's just a phrase meaning walk away. They'll learn their mistake when the players are gone.
---
Yeah, you can. In Fallout 4.
---
Just checked it out and came back to say thank you :)
---
No addictions. The last patch lvl 3 wouldn’t stay on so I thought it was a herd mentality glitch. This patch none of them will stay on.
---
I won’t miss y’all either. I’m already unsubbed. But I’ll respond to this post.
---
This will be the next game I delete from my PS with the next game I buy. I still have Valkeria Chronicals and FO4 installed. Spider Man. 
---
I just deleted FFXV for this patch, terrible decision.
---
I played FO3 through 4 times. I’m on my third play through of FO4. Easily my favorite games, along with KOTOR and ME.
---
Give up on it already
---
If we're being honest here, I only bulked so my stash would be neat and it would be easier to find things
---
bye
---
i am having a blast!
---
It's 11 charisma iirc.
---
It's fine. It takes a lot more bullets, which is a pointless change because it doesn't make it more challenging, but she'll still go down.
---
I think they could save major face right now with a mea culpa about releasing what was probably the incorrect patch, or at least a patch with an old fork. Get ahead of it, admit your mistake, and fix it asap.
---
1400 caps from vendors alone, with what’s in place now. Queen drops serum plans and PA plans, she’s farmable easily with server hops if you want to do that. Which plenty do. If there were no cap limit I could never touch the endgame boss and just farm a serum and a PA plan every day easily by farming weapons to sell or just skip any challenge at all and craft outfits for a tiny bit of plastic and cloth and sell all of those in 10 mins. If they take all challenge out of the game they may as well give all the plans to us all for free to save time 
---
They should at least offer one free respec each time they drastically change the perks like this. The build I spent months perfecting is now utter shit, and the thought of leveling up an additional 40 times just to switch it up makes me want to take a long break from the game.
---
you're right, you don't.
---
because now your armor just breaks at the same speed of 2 hits as it would without it. 
---
Technically I read it twice because I clicked the title expecting a big rant but just read the title again. I also showed a friend.
---
I'm no lawyer but I think that counts as four separate reckless endangerment... Endangerments? Endangermentings?
---
I don't why I said that. I have the cannibal perk.
---
I should have eaten that damn windego.
---
I don't give a crap about the dupers.  I don't dupe I don't buy from dupers.  Just stop screwing the game up worse
---
The combination of two shot and explosive weapons were banned right?
---
I mean.. at this point... aren’t we all really just unpaid outsourced QA testers for Bethesda?
---
The only place I've ever had that happen was inside one of the silo.  I think it tries to clip into the roof for some reason. Try putting it down outside maybe? Idk.  Weird bug though... But saw it before the patch 
---
I haven't played FO76 in ages. The last time I did I got half way through a silo and it CTD. I didn't bother coming back till now after the update.
---
Which spawned me miles from my base overloaded with weights from the silo gym room I was about to scrap. So now I'm stuck slogging through the Wastelands with a nerfed gun that was *badly* and *incorrectly* double nerfed with zero buffs to compensate. "Oh your gun is now only 33% as effective as it was, even with all your points sunk into it but it still has the bad TS accuracy. Hahahaha".
---
With nothing NEW added to the game (as far as I can tell) and only the grind increased I have zero interest in staying in FO76.
---
It isn't a stumble it is a step back in many places and even though other games have made mistakes (Battlefield TTK anyone?)  not many of them have takeb the changelog from previous updates and removed those changes which were unanimously well received (power core rate, Bobby pin rate..)
---
And no. I don't just play FO76. I've spent the I between time going back to Battlefield and Escape from Tarkov. Oh and you know living a life. Even something as boring as weeding the garden is currently more fun than FO76. 
---
PC? Modded?
---
[PS4] (non-Pro) here and no crashes.
---
The turnaround in that game is nothing short of impressive.  That small ass team actually pulled it off and fixed the game while adding content. 
---
Bethesda hasn't even get one of those right with 50x the resources.  It's pathetic. 
---
You lost me when you started your opinion piece with “this is an observable truth”. LOL
---
I would put a ticket in for herpes ferry too. That's never going away.
---
Yes to both questions. I hope I don’t have to uninstall my mods
---
Same with the grenade rifle. I was so excited tonight when I got a two star grenade launcher that has the "more damage the lower your health" and the "50% more limb damage" on it until I remembered the nerf.
---
Have you considered trying 5,000 bullets and 6 guns?
---
You can be invested in a game without being so emotionally invested that hating it/defending it consumes you. 
---
can confirm. I was trying to craft ammo and it said I didn't have enough lead even though I had 8 bulk lead.
---
Imagine being a player like me without any twoshots, explosive, or TSE weapons and hearing you whine that you can't hipfire headshot the SBQ from across the map anymore
---
Don't worry, I didn't forget. Here's another one for you. Hope you like them big and engorged: https://imgur.com/a/qY9Z9i9
---
Thanks
---
Just do mayor for a day mission that melee weapon does 270 damage over 300 on drugs
---
still should at least let us have a decent experience on pc. the consolers signed up for that shit, we didn't.
---
I think they need to have matchmaking for the PvP servers, because what if a level 200 decides to sit next to the vault and just kill level 1s as they come out? 
---
Not to my knowledge, could be wrong
---
Xbox one
---
DarKNiTeMaRE101
---
All my bulk junk no longer count to materials in my base meaning I have to scrap it back into individual numbers to use them 
---
Specially with how much fast travel costs , it should be train stations are free to travel to and then it costs to go everywhere else 
---
I'm thinking about going back to Diablo 3 on the switch because I want a game that I can move around the house with. I just can't swallow the $60 price tag for a game I already own on 2 other systems, but I love a good lore game and 76 let me down big time with Nerfs.
---
...the queen drops *Ultracite* PA plans, yeah.
---
And I never asked for no vendor caps, I have no idea where that came from.
---
I guess I could make you stuff to argue against you, too?
---
I just think they increased some of the prices a little too much.
---
Thaaaaaat's all.
---
UGH - does 97 base now.
---
Sigh.
---
I’m lucky I chose melee. I never got lucky with legendary guns so I was happy with the hammer. 
---
Some say I chose the hammer.  Some say the hammer chose me. 
---
You're right. That's crazy.
---
How are 13 people so terrible at this point in the game being released?
---
Based on other posts, ymmv.
---
I’m not boycotting or anything. I’m just done.
---
I’m moving on. I know what I want and need.
---
And it’s obviously not in line with their own ideas.
---
I’m not blaming anyone. I’m just accepting and owning up that I want something else. 
---
I don’t know if it’s mentioned yet, but Zenimax has a colorful bunch of board of directors.
---
I'm unphased, get your build together. Games still new.
---
Don't know maybe its just mine acting funny.
---
I’m really confused.  Did they really mess up that badly?
---
This comment section makes me sick. This guy is actually out here trying to feel and you come at him with a complex version of  “get a life bro?”  Really? This is serious for him, wether you like to admit it or not.
---
it's just insulting to have to alter things about how you play because of an unintended reversion of a previous change.
---
You wanted private servers? Because this is how you get private servers.  This is one way to get some peace and quiet. 
---
but instead you guys work on a pvp mode that's already immediately ruined by all the dupers since you're letting people take their current characters in with all their stuff, so to compensate you nerf two perks that literally did not need nerfed, and why not also make our anmor break even fucking faster too, for just no good reason. 
---
I bought the Longfellows outfit from the Responders Vendor Bot yesterday. 
---
Looks awesome, that would’ve been something I’d have bought from the atomic shop! 
---
&gt;probably gonna grab resident evil 2
---
Did that this past weekend (I guess I saw the writing on the wall)... its awesome, perfect blend of the original atmosphere and modern controls
---
...this thread is about no vendor caps dude. That’s where that came from 
---
I've generally been pretty forgiving, because I'm mostly still having fun, so whatever.  But this kind of novice mistake, to somehow fuck up your release branches like this? That's something I'd expect from rookies, not from a studio that's supposed to be one of the top ones. 
---
Just be prepared cause it's a VERY long game.  The entire first "palace" is a tutorial and that took me days to finish.   Awesome game with great visuals, compelling story, and a very interactive world. 
---
Lol.  Thats edgy as fuck man.  Try not to cut yourself.
---
Ha! With the new patch it won’t matter what the scorchbeast queen drops because you’ll NEVER be able to kill her! Mmwwaaahhhhhhhahahahaah!
---
Yes,i do encounter it every time i fast travel,so i started to walk there instead. In their defense, i got this before this update,so it's not new.
---
Oh dude, I feel so stupid, I didn't even know I had another account and it was that..... thanks mate for that unsuspecting solution! 
---
Thankyou everyone for your input and help, I feel like such an amatuer lol.
---
He is right on the duping thing though, I have personally been disconnected from 5 servers in a hour. It's getting out of hand and it is likely they are doing it so much at the moment because they are scared that hot fix will come soon.
---
Then why are you even here? 
---
Yeah I don’t know how I do anything because I only carry 4 weapons, 2 of every chem, 5 stim/rad 5 food/water and some random gear/ammo before picking up stuff called loot.  How do I do it?
---
It’s like a “load out” or something.
---
Man, I'm in the same boat.  I've been playing this game like crazy, but I haven't even bothered to login today.  I think its time for a break.  
---
I waited patiently despite being stunned that ultrawide support didn't exist at launch, and once I saw the great so-called patch (ini edit) they released on Dec11th, I quit the game and haven't relaunched it since. Thought fuck it, i need a few months break from their crap and maybe by then they'll have shit figured out, reading this it's evident the money spent on FO76 has been completely and irredeemably wasted by early buyers such as myself. Everyone says never to pre-order, well I may have learnt ate and hard but thanks Bethesda for teaching me that non-the-less. 
---
That's kinda arguable. Making the game more stable is of course a worthwhile priority but unless the game remains enjoyable enough in the meantime there won't be many folks sticking around even if they do finally iron out most of the worst bugs. Making combat - the biggest part of the game - even more of a chore than it already is? It just doesn't feel like a great move for the game's longevity.
---
Here is a tip.
---
 There are 2 windegos there the first one is outside and almost easy to kill IF you don't go the cave directly but instead go from the back, so that you can be above it and it can't reach you and you can snipe it from there.
---
The second one. You just have to be prepared.
---
This happened earlier and was glorious. Got notified my camp is under attack, j check the map and this guy has nearly a 400 bounty. I knew it was leveled and was going to let it go, but I curiosity got the best of me. I engage in the PvP, I don't care about the base, I have nothing to lose, so I go for kill. They have a two shot explosive shotgun, so when I killed them with a normal lever action and got almost 500 caps from their bounties I was pretty stoked. Haven't repaired my base though as it's given me an excuse to find new ground. 
---
Awesome. It's so sad when you one hit them and the ragdoll away. I remember the fear at that penthouse place near where you get the excavator power armor. I was so over weight and low on stims and Bam he was there.
---
No, I’m okay accepting responsibility.
---
I simply don’t want what they’re offering these days. It’s been a good run, but I’m out. 
---
I’m sure they’ll do fine without me. And I know I’ll be happier elsewhere.
---
Your character has the FOMO disease 
---
Good to hear. I mean I don't want the game to die. I have hundreds of hours myself, but they just keep breaking stuff and and not adding enough. I just want more to do. They're just extending gameplay by adding more grind.
---
I know, my rifle which did nearly 400 damage now does barely 100 with all rifleman perks, my hammer does twice that, with a perk missing, tell me how that makes sense? Just make the weapons ineffective in PvP and stay the same in PvE.
---
Also, how does an explosive .50 cal  machine gun shooting twice the bullets do 59 damage?!
---
Idk my x01 helmet says it’s a cash shop mod but I never bought any power armor atom shop items 
---
Eh. Less people will complain about lack of endgame content if it takes forever to get to that point. Maybe that's what they're going for, since each patch seems to be about small fixes and nerfs while adding nothing new to the experience. 
---
Tell me about it.
---
I played for 10 minutes today and found my level 123 character needing to run away from a fight with Super Mutants at West Tek. It felt like I was using my level 15 alt character. 
---
Damn, I thought this was a serious post until the last line.
---
And you fail on an epic level.
---
Only lead and aluminum get lighter in bulk, aluminum is 0.3 each, and bulked 10 aluminum weighs 1.5, meaning each one gets halved in weight.
---
with say steel, 0.3 each, bulked 30 weighs 9, the same as before, however it costs two plastic to bulk that you lose, meaning overall your stash weighs two plastic less than before, if you bulk 6 sets of steal you save the same amount of weight as bulking one set of plastic and selling it, or you could just throw the plastic on the ground until it despawns. 
---
Does bulking save you stash space, with aluminum and lead yes and you should do so, for anything else, yes, but you might as well just be throwing all your plastic on the ground.
---
No weight reduction buffs.
---
Bro my whole build is weight perks basically.
---
Those are essential. Even more than the rest.
---
Just use a sledge. Kills a 68 super in two hits. 
---
And 15hp is going to win fights?
---
Losing players by the dozens today, I do feel as a day 1 player I’ve gotten my fair share of enjoyment out of the game for the money I spent.  But yea it’s about that time 
---
Not at killing the queen like you and 13 people did.
---
Oh, sick burn.
---
I honestly assumed it was either fake or super rare bug, because I've never had problems with the processor being bugged. 
---
&gt;  If everything one shotted everything then fire rate is all that differentiates them
---
except thats how scaling in a mmorpg works,as you get better gear you will start one shotting weaker enemies,TSEs were fine all we needed was meaningful endgame content
---
I made a comment a week or so ago that Bethesda should pause the development of their other games and put the whole dev team back on 76 to really fix the game, just a week or two of that and maybe the game would get close to a release viable version. I was crucified and was downvoted into hell for even having the thought. Now it looks like that may be the only way they save themselves and those future titles.
---
Pretty much, one at a time waiting until each has completely loaded in, Yup. 
---
Meh. Sun-kissed and ghoulish kind makes it not that big a deal. 
---
Been there since day 1 to stop people trolling with no caps to try and fame the system.  
---
Its patch day.
---
Things will die down
---
\&gt;Anthem for example
---
thanks I'll wait for The Outer Worlds
---
This is how you get them to stop paying lip service and actually fix it.   Drop the DAUs and force them to listen.  If they pull the plug on it then whatever it was a broken game anyway. 
---
Highly recommend Persona 5 if you're looking to sink a bunch of hours into a game. 
---
I agree Bethesda should get their shit together and stop making their game worse 
---
What economy? Each vendor gets 200 caps. We aren't dealing with a set number of caps in the entire fame to balance an economy.
---
Up voted
---
It's completely serious. I'm pretty sure I'm done with this for the time being. It's to the point where I'm having more fun playing BF5.. so If that's any indication
---
Can I have your stuff?   Jk. 😉
---
They have to get the game out of beta before they can add new content.
---
Sad but true. i'm just along for the ride. Am I a masochist? maybe.
---
I'm not positive, but I think it corrupted the database on my PS4. Had to re-initialize it today, and I might wait for the *next* update to reinstall this particular game.
---
" Put another way, Bethesda dropped item degradation from Skyrim and Fallout 4. Maybe there was a reason for that? "
---
Because it was done poorly in Fo3/Oblivion and didn't fit the gameplay of Skyrim/Fo4 but works far better for a survival focused game like F76?
---
Yeah that's cool. But you do all that work, just to disconnect from the server.
---
They can't keep the weight of bobby pins stable from week to week and you want them to create an event that zeroes out your character?
---
I honestly don’t think any of the devs or someone who has major say design wise play this game in their free time. It feels like everything nerfed is being done to because the players are surpassing some metric on their excel sheet. 
---
Lol
---
So close but yet another pitiful attempt at being whitty.
---
Nah. Have fun tho.
---
Bullshit. 
---
I have a Hardened TSE Lever, and even with all 3 maxed Rifleman perks it doesn’t take down SBs in 4-5 shots, let alone a non/legendary. 
---
Basically this, except if they built this patch off of a previous version, hance the roll back...
---
Merging code from different versions can be a huge headache, but they can likely revert this patch, and then systematically apply different commits. Not sure if they'll go that route, as they rolled back the version for a reason, and we can only assume it was a good one.  It was just pure lazy to assume they could release without (again) fixing the bugs that they previously fixed.
---
Bethesda seems keen on cutting off their nose to spite their face...
---
This is a bonkers bug...  seems to apply to most effects including move speed penalty for having a heavy weapon out, and when cured i'm not sure it resets properly... although that might be perception, now i cant get the feeling i'm walking slower out of my head... makes exploring maddening.  
---
Can confirm rad-worms will remove marsupial jump height effects completely after it is cured rather than resetting them to back to mutated values ... so something is ...off when rad-worms are cured as well.
---
A lot closer than you and your friends got to winning.
---
Yea, hoping for hotfix on that one, from development perspective seems that they applied new changes on older code branch, more of a production management issue than a patch work itself and it should not be that hard to fix. I wonder why Bethesda QA is not doing any regression testing.
---
Okay I'll give you a duped weapon as compensation 
---
I just adapted. I don't even use weight reducing perks. I night make a mule to store junk, I don't know. For now I got high str and deep pockets FTW
---
Take a break? I did, Christmas Eve and 13 days after.
---
Still feel strong enough to weather this patch, too. Besides, rolled a new character and enjoying a completely different play style.
---
Peace.
---
Explosives got nerfed. I for one am happy
---
Nope. An era has ended and everything is in chaos. 
---
So much variety available to build a character around yet the only build worth using is melee.
---
This is sad and it goes against everything that Fallout was built on.
---
Its still better than the base weapon is it not?
---
Judging by the posts today, that’s a solid probably not, chief.
---
Watoga vendor. I got them now I’m trying to find heavy legs.
---
The behemoth taking 18 shots to kill not instead of 2-3 is a big deal.  The of the game has be zapped out of it, the Queen is substantially harder, but about 3 months too late imo.  They hate admitting their faults and putting it all on the players.  Anyone telling you different is a fanboy with a chode at this point 
---
Spoiler alert: not even worth running queen , prob just got ultracite vents and a bolstering wooden leg
---
Some ppl aren't pulling there wait.

I counted 8 in that video and they did it more than 6x faster than you
---
Well said
---
Yeah you got ghosted man.
---
I'm sorry to hear this.  I hope you get a resolution soon.  I've been having my own problems with BGS's wonderful customer service, so I feel your pain.
---
Honestly, I don't think they care. They have our money.  What are we going to do about it?
---
how long is a while. game is less than 3 months old.
---
Yep, perfect time. No more douche bags 1 shooting you with explosive weapons....making PVP great again
---
From what we’ve already covered, I can see that touching on the subject of your uncle’s forcing your into necrophilia must have frightened you badly if you’re back to sending dick pics.
---
If the link really is as you describe, then this must be a very touchy subject, no pun intended towards your predicament.
---
Your dialogue is very interesting here. What was it that your uncle required you to remember? You say that you play graveyard keeper- which represents the necrophilia in your life- more than fallout which represents your uncle.
---
Yet you’re frightened to talk about it?
---
It all makes sense, really. You grew to love necrophilia on your own, and, judging by your overwhelming desire to show your penis to men, I’m assuming it was to men that you became attracted. No doubt due to the prior trauma with your uncle, and the fact that he commanded you to never forget him.
---
Interesting, Ted, very interesting indeed.
---
What do you know about repressed memories?
---
Thanks. Hours later the new patch (hopefully) patches it. It was within the patch notes, but if it didn’t help, we will try 
---
Just went there myself. Since when do they have level 6 turrets that shoot you 700 miles away with explosive bullets?? 
---
Another great example
---
the game is fine stop complaining 
---
Something like that. I'm pretty sure it caps at 25% of item value regardless of perks. 
---
no the point of your exposed shgit it how upset you get, try calling people names like you some tough guy or something on the internet of all places, how a adult would have responded is, " oh yea my bad, I shouldn't have been a cunt, but instead you continue to be when you were wrong, no one today takes responsibility for thier mistakes instead they continue to try and be;itt;e someone after they showed thier ass, like your doing right now little little man...get some rest all will be better
---
I mean they went with a company that make micro transaction cash grabs. In fact Diablo immortal is a reskin of one of their games.
---
We can't all afford $30 for textures. Enjoy! 
---
I never once said it would be a good idea. 
---
&gt; No way in hell they have a QA department.
---
I have worked in video games as a designer for more than 20 years. 
---
I have never worked on a team without QA, and rarely worked on a team with poor QA... 
---
But I have worked at many companies where dev or design management refused to fix the issues that the QA team found. 
---
QA can only highlight issues. If it is a gameplay issue, someone on the design team has to agree that the issues need fixing, and then someone who directs the developers has to agree to allocate the time to do the work. 
---
So from my experience, don't blame QA... I bet they are as pissed as you are. Every time I have seen issues with blatant bugs and bizarre decisions to leave shitty stuff in a game, it has been a hallmark of a resource-starved or poorly-managed team. 
---
Beth QA, if you are reading this, I give you guys the benefit of the doubt.
---
All the plans a vendor can sell are somehow for sale all the time. There's a (Known) flag, too.
---
Rad worms mess up your mutations.
---
Bobbypins are made of depleted uranium again and weigh 0.1 again.
---
A lot of people are trying to bring back the emo scene because they've never left Whitespring with the TSE shotgun they bought on the market.
---
Tonight I froze up, CTD, twice. Disconnected from server twice. Got about 15 mins of actual playtime in tonight before I  just gave up after that 4th fuckup. Very frustrating and disappointing when I thought this stuff finally slowed down. Its getting harder and harder to rationalize it as time goes on. I’m on Xbox if that matters at this point. 
---
One shotting end game mobs (nuke zone enemies) is a lot different than 1 shotting a basic "weaker" enemy.  Add on tse could do enough dmg to go through slap damage at a pretty quick pace.
---
TS as a perk for weapon specific builds and Explosive for an aoe build (less single target more aoe, could even have buffed explosion range) make for much healthier perks and leaves room for other perks.  TSE in its unnerfed state would always be the best combo unless a new perk was added.
---
You just answered our frustrations perfectly. Congrats, asshole
---
Yeah that was the boat I was in. Now this. Sigh, oh well we have resorted to rad cleansing hug sessions.
---
The patch was seemingly built on the version of the game from two patches ago, so a lot of old bugs and exploits have returned. That, and a few newly broken things and some expected and unexpected nerfs with debatable merits are the causes of the all the commotion.
---
Gosh. The more i read today, the more i am reminded of issues i just put up with. This one particularly 
---
Sneak doubles my crits if that's what you're asking.
---
Sneak attacks aren't crits though.
---
Headshots aren't crits either
---
Maybe they should have thought about upgrading the Stone Age Engine. And how come a Indie Game like ArK Survival can handle up to 100 players a server + unlimited inventory for players and tamed dinos and a Triple A Dev. Team cant make it happen?
---
You make a good point that i cant really counter if im being honest. Bethesda will probably just throw it out anyway
---
Lol wtf
---
That's the fact, Jack.
---
At least you have a TSE while tons of other players have been grinding for ages and haven't even come across a decent legendary worth keeping.
---
It's a feature!
---
Thank you 
---
It’s still decent. Guns are so horribly bad that it doesn’t matter however. One shot sneak Builds are still a thing if done right tho.
---
You would need to push it hard however.
---
Just how bad is the new patch?? as bad as people say?
---
I was happy at first with most of the fixes (White Knight nerf sucks!), but christ on a cracker, I've been booted from my C.A.M.P. 6 times now, and I'm pretty sure Bethesda ate my 4 story brick mansion I spent *hours* on.
---
I agree completely. This community is often overrun with whining children providing no value at all to the fanbase. 
---
How is that possible? They are damage bonuses on top of the weapon damage, so they should always be more powerful than a normal version.
---
Oddly enough on xb1 fusion cores generate are the right speed.
---
Got a feeling parroting is in full effect atm
---
Anyone who has done software development sees this for what it is— bugs RE-introduced, poor quality control, testing and validation, complete lack of regression etc. 
---
Nerfgate 2019 aside, this is embarassing on multiple levels. Mutations cease working, people stuck in power armor, bobby pin weight, bulk items not scrapable— these are issues that were either corrected then reverted, or introduced while attempting to fix other bugs.
---
I put up with it too, I wasnt trying to complain, I really was just wondering
---
This exactly. Can i really be ok with playing a game having to plan on random disconnects? 
---
Just change to bulking anything over x. For me it's like 300 ish
---
I made this post a month ago  
---
&gt;BETHESDA - Please don't be afraid to make hot fixes and minor patches (self.fo76)  
---
submitted 1 month ago by MrGlayden  
---
I personally, and I'm sure I speak for the majority of people here, wouldn't mind not being able to play for a few hours here and there if it meant a bug or something was getting patched in.
---
When there is weeks between these bug updates where a bunch of stuff is fixed, the things that aren't fixed sit and fester with some people.  
---
I would much rather see the server go down for an hour and come back to have the animations for the lever action fixed, or any other of the myriad of simple fix bugs. A small change can make a big difference.  
---
---------------------------------------------------------------------
---
Ah! Thank you!  
---
Now if I can figure out who has a bathtub and a commode...
---
&gt;TSE in its unnerfed state would always be the best combo unless a new perk was added.
---
let me guess you hate people having fun?
---
???
---
Average wold be a generic version of the weapon. So by pure definition they will be better than the base version making them pretty damn good. Especially for people who have never had any of those weapons, they will be objectively more powerful.
---
You talking about the 'loot cave' at the Whitespring golf club?
---
Look at it. Don't be a chicken shit. 
---
Sorry me stuff going to grave whit me 😀😉
---
I already have for two weeks. I just wanted my original character to be useful, but since energy weapons aren't there just isn't any point. We shouldn't really be forced into playing a different type of build. The idea between the different builds is for different people's preferences, but it's literally forced on you to actually complete many challenges. Not for me. Everybody has there own preferences and that's fine. I'm glad you were able to get more out of it and I have no plan to call it quits completely. They obviously haven't worked on it for as long as they did on Fallout 4, but it just feels like there isn't enough to do. I guess I am just waiting for what I consider proper fixes (like energy weapons damage) and more content.
---
I answered your frustrations? I've never heard that expression. 
---
What do you mean? 
---
Scorchbeasts, not the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
Yep, I do it with everything except Plastic and Steel. I have X amount of bulked stuff for repairs and crafting and the rest goes to vendor. Plastic used for bulking is a non issue for, I'm drowning in it.
---
You mean to fix broken stuff?
---
Yea you are right on that part.
---
You're missing what the hissy fit is about. And even then if the majority of your customer base disagrees with your changes your changes are wrong.
---
can I have your job please
---
Oh nooo you can’t one shot everything anymore 
---
Stability needed to be #1 priority. But no, someone at bethesda with their head up their rear end decides to balance for pvp and make the game more grindy while getting disconnected all the time. 
---
Works just fine for me. Don't just stand there and absorb hits. 
---
Aww...
---
You made it through Fallout 2 and this is what got you? ;)
---
I don't have bird bones, i have Marsupial &amp; Speed Demon :)
---
Thank you so much for this answer. Did the math that no one else (myself included) cared to do. 
---
I never tested it but I had a hunch. It never seemed like my stash weight got smaller after bulking. 
---
I’m not sure of the math they used for the TSE weapons. My leaver action was pumping out 450+ yesterday, now it’s at 160ish. Even if they cut the damage output in half I’d still be doing better than I am now. This is a SUPER nerf to explosive builds, and even though I am a stealth build, all my TSE weapons aren’t worth carrying around anymore. Back to the ole hunting rifle for me I suppose. 
---
Wait, taming an animal takes up CAMP budget? Why?
---
If you lowered the armor of a level 68 super mutant from 178 to 0, and gave them 3 times more health than they currently have, they would be only slightly harder to kill with a super sledge, but a minigun would chew through their health like butter. A weapon with 356 damage deals 50% more, a weapon with 178 damage is doubled in power, any weapon with 89 damage is getting tripled, and a weapon with 18 damage is dealing about 5 times more.
---
That is how dramatic armor effects weapons
---
I don't understand how anyone is still playing this shit. I lurk in the sub from time to and it feels likes it's inundated with Bethesda shills and people suffering from sunk-cost syndrome. There are better games out at the moment than this shit. Why keep doing this to yourselves? Bethesda isn't going to change.
---
I don't understand coding, but Bethesda has people that do. They were given a set of constraints by the people holding the purse strings and making the high level decisions. They did what they could with what they had. Who knows how much differently those two game engines handle those things?
---
Furthermore, after the launch of the UTTER DISASTER that is "Atlas" by the makers of ARK, I'm not sure that's a route you want to go.
---
This game needs a lot of help. I have posted recently with simple changes that would make the game way more enjoyable.  Just simple QoL things that modders make (on their own frickin time) are better than what the Devs are providing us at this point.
---
Look, I'm a BIG Fallout fan. I'm actually in the middle of a complete franchise playthrough right now.
---
It's time to drop 76. Not only is it a developmental failure, but it fails the lore of Fallout itself. And if nothing else, it's a commercial flop, going from release to bargain bin in record time.
---
Bethesda didn't want to make a game with 76. They wanted to make an online marketplace where blindly loyal players would happily spend money all day.
---
That's all 76 is to them. Always was from the very start. It was obvious to me when they announced it and it's even more obvious to me now.
---
76 is never going to "recover" because there's nothing to salvage. You can't make a boat out of two planks and a roll of duck tape.
---
The ONLY thing that will "save" 76 is a complete rebuild from the ground up and to remove microtransactions and to add literally ANY plot that doesn't involve a variation of the same fetch quest issued by a robot or dead human via 19 minute long holotape.
---
76 is a failure on MULTIPLE fronts and I'm saying this as someone who LOVES Fallout.
---
It's time to let this one go. It's never going to be any better than it is right now unless it becomes an objectively different game.
---
Serious question: have you worked in games, or in other kinds of software?
---
Most of my career was in games and I have been on the inside of poor releases like this. There's nothing that would shock me. 
---
I recently switched to a different kind of software and it is a fucking night and day difference in competence. We get better quality stuff done faster. It's completely different. Mind blowing. 
---
Yeah yeah not all places are the same, but my sample size in games is most of a career and most of it was a circus. YMMV. 
---
That one is a lot of "feels like," so I wouldn't be surprised. However, there are a lot of indicators that are readily visible to everyone. The double loading screens introduced so we don't stand around while the world continues to load in around us are gone. The bobby pin weight returned. Those aren't huge things, but they do point to the second most recent patch being undone in some ways.
---
Could not agree more. There needs to be a “my bad” inside the vault and a roll back before next week. I can’t believe how screwed up this patch is. My weight like yours is all over the map. Stuff that used to work doesn’t, and yet my PA mods still don’t work (HUD is 50/50 at best, my calibrated shocks occasionally act like explosive venting, etc). Bethesda just admit this was a mistake and put it back in the lab for more testing. About the only thing that is a positive are the plans. 
---
So your uncle humiliated and berated you to get you to where you are? And you’ve no doubt repressed it; attempting the same tactics on those who force you to confront your demons and face your past.
---
What an unfortunate quagmire to be in. Be honest: do you still see your uncle, Ted?
---
Makes me wonder if they didn't release patch notes until after the patch for a reason. People would have been flaming them if they'd released those notes yesterday.
---
Downvote it, little bitches. Please do lmao
---
You honestly didn't see a nerf coming? 
---
 This is not new. It's been that way since art least patch 4.
---
It shot me from so far!!!! I actually killed the mutants alright since my revolver also has bonus damage against super mutants but damn.... those turrets 
---
Here's what I've figured out:
---
Info re: Bethesda patches:
---
a) They change things which effect the server stability by using more memory
---
b) They do not patch things which will assist player experience unless it will assist a).
---
In short, Bethesda doesn't give 2 shits about any of us. 
---
It's stupid easy to earn caps legit I'm having to stop trading as I'm constantly at the cap limit despite buying everything I see that I want.
---
If you're looking for a new game to play then I can't recommend Persona 5 enough.  76 has turned out to be a bad product but P5 is going to steal weeks of your time. 
---
Dropping the amount of DAUs is the ONLY way to get your only hope to get bethesda to fix FO76.  
---
Give us an exp event so we can level faster to swap points. 
---
It's still just as good if not better, if you look past the reverts and other issues brought about from today's patch. I'd wait till that's sorted before coming back.
---
Or refund my purchase. Tbh that would be a better option. 
---
That's the problem.  They have a user story: "As a Reddit user or YouTube creator, I want to hate the game for karma/clicks."
---
It's an XL, but their PO keeps putting it into their sprints 
---
Watoga train station also has it, and I am level 87.
---
Does nothing for me. Sometimes you gotta go in buildings and get surrounded and its RIP in literally 3-4 seconds.
---
So what you’re saying is the game sucks even more than when it launched?
---
It released with bugs that have existed in their engine since Fallout 3. Bethesda is so used to release and forget, modders will fix it.
---
This game is already paid for, and we want a quality return on our investment. 
---
I will be using my wallet to protest also, but if they see the rage and change it for the better, I might buy another Bethesda game. 
---
Yes I know and they aren't broken they are just weak. 
---
I too am a pistol build, my tse 10mm is now a pea shooter. But my AA/Vats western is still kicking like a mule. The build still works. You need a new gun.
---
I'll take being wrong about that. Took us 3 mins with our crutch weapons instead of 1 min. Takes forever to kill a regular SB solo if it doesn't land though. They could have held back the nerfs to 50% and worked on QoL. They didn't. Read the front page of this subreddit.
---
Strong comeback Mr. 5-Minute Final Boss. You reap what you sow.
---
my CAMP is set up right on rt64.  i have windows facing down the road.  nothing is more hilarious than sitting in the window with my sniper rifle, picking off super mutants that come lumbering up the road.
---
Super Mutant - "RETREAT!!"
---
It's fine.  Cry a little less over a video game champ.
---
The bounty system for one 
---
I shot a guy who took my workshop, and he sent me a message calling me a bully. Good times. 
---
Yeah I have a feeling ALOT of people rage uninstalled fo76 today
---
Good on you man tbh I've sick of farming, I'm not gonna grind for hours just so I can get back what I grinded for.
---
Did u have armor wieght reduction perks on? because those dont work in the stash
---
Do you have weight perks?
---
Dude it needs to be complained about. I kinda forgot about it and i can put up with it but why in the hell should we have to? Other's don't have the problem. That gets me going. We paid for the same product, we should not have to just suck it up. 
---
But like you said, it's whatever
---
I feel like you intentionally managed to miss the point. This is very obviously (and stated directly elsewhere by Bethesda CMs) a probe to start to see how much p2w you’ll allow shoved down your throat before you finally choke on it.

Now I’m laughing with them about how much of an idiot I was.
---
my gun  was nerfed 50% damage. even the explosive card reads wrong and the math don't add up.
---
Doesn't matter now all has been nerfed 
---
Even before this patch I was still having enemies heal back to full from damage from my attacks.  Stealth melee build, level 40ish, just using a normal Machete.  If I didn't kill them instantly, they'd heal up and I'd have a rough fight, since sneaking to lose enemies (Escape Artist) works about 1% of the time.
---
Shhhhh you're not a part of the circle jerk and that is bad
---
Just saddens me how this game went from 
---
choose your on path to chose your faction to go there do that
---
Cancer kids. I don't fucking care if there are already people discussing this and being civilized. People are allowed to be mad and you should be too, you little fuckboys.
---
Cool seeing what I know for plans.  Bum news is, I see that I know the Handmade plan. But go to craft with my Gunsmith perk at 5 and it is not available to craft. Am I missing something or still bugged. And glad I bought it at 500 not the 1500 it is now.
---
Except that the Bethesda game database is DESIGNED for this.
---
Each bug is a mod that fixes a few records.  These can be streamed to PC four weeks ahead of consoles.  On week 3, merge all the plugins with freely available tools to a "patch" plugin for consoles.
---
A month later, if consoles are fine, merge the chonker patch into the main modules.
---
It's LITERALLY a feature.
---
People soloed silos soon after launch with melee builds and normal or crappy melee weapons. Melee is king in this game what is pure nonsense. FPS games dont work well with melee, its infinito and mindnumbing.
---
Totally agree!!!
---
Today’s patch made me decide that 500 hours and 270 levels went to waste but at this rate the game is only getting worse. I’ve ignored the hate train all along but I’m starting to think those people were right. I uninstalled Fallout 76 tonight and I’m going back to Fallout 4 until I see progress but until then. 👋🏻
---
I'd rather that then the XP gained toast notification bottom center being stuck when you fast travel before it disappears 
---
Wow sounds like an easy xp farm. I don’t actually have any snipers I can use yet
---
I made this suggestion to the community manager and got zero response back when they first announced the nerf weeks ago. Its clear they care about their players so I wont be paying for anything that bethesda gets a cut from. 
---
Just kill everything...
---
That’s a reward from the quest. The whole set. 
---
Or else servers would lag as people with nothing better to do tamed tens or even hundreds of animals for funzies
---
;)
---
I am happy with the nerf aswell, except for the demolition perks, missiles launchers, fatmans, and Grenade launchers were Already weapons that werent very strong anyways in the game,  those weapons weight tons and the ammo aswell,  crafting them is alot of scavenging around for spri gs, now they nerfed the demolition perks which effect those weapons. Idc about the TSE being nerfed though, the game is actually more challenging again. But the  for ppl who made an explosive build, its just a slap in the face.  People claim that the game is more balanced are terribly wrong. There is still melee that does over 1000 a hit, which similar like the TSE shotgun. I wonder how long it will take when people are complaining about those 'bloodied' melee weapons. 
---
Someone else was talking about a bug earlier today with 21:9 screens. Something to do with aiming i think. 
---
I feel that one of the worst changes implemented in this patch is what Bethesda did to carry weight, Please hear me out. 
---
If makes it so that if you are 1,500 pound over your max carry weight, you cannot collect any new items or caps. Basically, you can’t trade if you’re severely over-encumber
---
This means that player run shops like Lucky Lou’s are out of business simply because they have a large inventory due to them running a shop.
---
Bethesda just killed legitimate shops, and not nearly enough people are talking about it.
---
Yeah man I feel you, I'm quitting I shot a level 91 deathlclaw and  did like 10% of its hp. I'm glad this patch came about because I realised how empty the grind for this game is. It asks for so much of your time to be powerful in it and that can all be taken away with one balance patch so then you have to get more levels or make a new character. I'm not willing to put in the time investment this game asks for its more serious player base.
---
Yea but you’re locked in melee. You can rad up the whole health bar in about 10 seconds if you slip up. Not to mention that rad worms gives you untold super powers, which is totally unintended
---
This is extremely disappointing.
---
I just had the best week playing fallout confident greener pastures were ahead.
---
Dare I even pick it up again? 
---
Bethesda get your shit together.  You've lost another customer.
---
I have that’s what this whole post is about 
---
MOM I PRESSED THE DOWN ARROW AGAIN LOL
---
So just make it to where you can only tame one animal at a time...
---
I misspoke. I know weigh up is not hard. I meand do you not like being able to move?
---
Based on what I have seen with Fallout 4, modders are awesome. Maybe they can fix this garbage, nerfed to death game. 
---
Mass Effect Andromeda's multiplayer had the exact same issue. Ridiculously bullet spongey enemies that literally took more than an entire magazine of straight headshots to kill one basic unshielded grunt (in this game, it'd be like an ordinary Ghoul or Scorched), while they had perfect lock-on accuracy and downed even the most tanky classes in 4-5 shots. Eventually they did buff all player damage across the board, and it felt so much more satisfying to play, and - here's the kicker - didn't feel any less challenging, fun, or rewarding!
---
"Make enemies hard to kill" is hands-down the worst approach to giving a game "difficulty".
---
well, there was something in there, I wasn't sure when I read it it was the exact same thing. That was about missing clothes if I remember right, this is about missing players lol. 
---
I agree it was surprisingly easy to kill her with my group. Worried more about doing it with randoms. I think they could have vested their time into other things like making sure the bugs you fixed don't all of a sudden come back.
---
You know, you're right. Sorry, my bad.
---
Still players test for free in either case.
---
No sadly the errors like the mass xp at whitesprings/in nuke zones, dupers, bobblehead/magazine exploits are what caused a lot of issues. I am lvl 49 with 217 hours of gameplay. I have about 60% of the map done(I think) I still haven’t done at least 15-20 events and the Veil of Mystery quest line. I Haven’t even seen a sloth,behemoth,Flat woods monster, Mirelurk Queen, and others. I also for sure have dozens of plans and recipes left to find/buy. It is all about play style. It you started a new character and forget about how EASY this game was previously then you could have a lot of fun. 
---
Nerf-date. I can't kill anything at the moment and my Power Armour is like a plastic sandwich bag. 
---
My character is a heavy energy weapon user. I have to repair pretty much every 15-20 min depending on how much combat I get into.
---
Ahaha
---
My Idle Explosives ‘daily’ hasn’t reset in six days.
---
Can we even consider them dailies if you can’t do them every day?
---
If I don't hold onto everything how will I possibly survive through winter... 
---
It's a primal thing, not all people have it as bad as others, I would imagine nurture has as much effect on this as nature.
---
No joke. Release day hit, and then boom! Todd and Pete went to ground and haven't been heard from since.
---
Some things need a nerf, and some things need a buff. A nerf can be fine if it’s not over the top. They went over the top with this. I think they should revert it slightly or make it so that two shot and explosive can’t be on the same weapon. That way, two shot weapons can be strong, and explosive weapons can be strong, rather than two shot explosive weapons being incredibly, ridiculously strong. 
---
They just need some balance, but I agree with the sentiment.
---
Last patch was really good. They just took that away from us.
---
Opinions are aloud to change with the circumstance. If they didnt, we'd never move forward.
---
Who really cares what someone else does with their money. This goes beyond FO76, ffs settle down.
---
I think I understand now.
---
It’s your uncle who has passed, and it’s his grave that you now keep. So dominated were you by him while he lived, you still feel subservient to him now; watching his grave and occasionally sexing him up whenever his spirit- that voice in your head- commands. He even sexes you too due to rigor mortis of the penis, doesn’t he?
---
Which makes perfect sense. Fallout is a dead game. 0 endgame content. Despite being dead, it still fucks your when you need a good fucking, after which you retire to play grave keeper during the rest of your free time.
---
I think we’ve just had another breakthrough, Ted. How’re you coming with recalling those repressed memories? 
---
Yep I just wish there was a quality game like fallout out there that can fill the void, I’ve played fo4 to death and psnow is such a hassle to go through to play the old games :( 
---
That's the second part.
---
You actually get better stuff if you mark them first... You can kill them during the "Evacuation" part.
---
This is not a feature, its a bug. They attempted to prevent mods from being scrapped automatically, which affected bulk.
---
Yeah but seems they are going scorch earth to the point the enemies are bullet sponges and everyone is going have to spend ton of resources on repairs and ammo to maintain themselves to the point the fun is gone and the game is upkeep simulator, especially since they are going after repair perks like white knight.
---
You should name your system
---
Sorry Apkins but Arch is right. OP's own post is generic and repetitive and it does NOT help Bethesda realize they need better QA in 2019. 
---
OP states he was jazzed about the patch notes, and then hours after we all realize how bad Bethesda messed up technically on this drop OP states he has had enough and is quitting, meaning he is currently hot headed and furious and in the throws of reacting in the moment. 
---
I don't know about you, but I'm sort of enjoying some of the anti Bethesda posts this evening, and I'm most definitely a fanboy lol. I don't need the fun slowed down by low effort reactionary posts written in the heat of anger. If there was any gain in it, I'd write my own thoughts down and just keep re-reading them.
---
" Frustrations expressed like this are important criticisms " sorry but this is simply not so in today's reality. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake :)
---
I've been on a loading screen for 20 minutes. LOL. No internet connectivity issues either. 
---
We’ll see, but with the disappearing player, the clothes ect also disappeared on the one who were visible. Let’s just see and IF it still exists, I hope your method still works. Because that’s better than nothing! 
---
I can somewhat agree with this.... nothing can hurt me really... unless I get surrounded by a swarm of things. And yet I can't seem to hurt anything either... unless I can stay hidden. Sneak bonus is still pretty good. 
---
Speaking of ballistic fiber, what the fuck!!?
---
Just 2 weeks ago, me and the missus were grinding and struggling to find any to fix our armour, now I've got about 130 scrap of it in STASH. What did I miss?
---
Revision control is vitally important. So important that most software projects assign a person to police it, and use software (Subversion, etc.) designed specifically to allow individuals to work on the same body of software without mutual interference. To accidentally roll back to an earlier version not once, but twice, is incomprehensible.
---
5 shots from a gun that does 100ish damage to kill a lvl 5......
---
Like is this an over exaggeration?  The lvl 50 protectrons in watoga have roughly 400 hp. A lvl 5 shouldn't come anywhere close to that. 
---
I understand your mad, but come on if you make stupid claims with no proof you either can't aim for shit or found the invincible lvl 5 God protectron.
---
Your post literally lost all its credibility and validity. 
---
Oh snap. Thank you! I forgot 
---
Been playing BF5 as well since I got bored of this game as well. It's pretty good!
---
just saw Grahm... handmade gun plan is 1200 caps from him (got it from Harper's ferry below 800 caps)
---
i feel like every plans became expensive.
---
I heard nuka rocketsuit is bugged in that some armor pieces show up over it.
---
Someone finally said it!
---
Yup that's a good idea, or maybe not nerf something by a whopping 180%
---
Thanks for actually being funny and not just whining.
---
Aye, and it’s the easier one for Bethesda to keep, because it’s how every one of their games has worked on this engine. I’m not expecting a change here.
---
I paid for Mario Party on the switch, bought another set of joycons to play with a group of 4. Total investment: $130+TX
---
The game also sucks. The new game modes are cool, the new mini games are cool. The OG board game model is absolute hot garbage.
---
It's nice to want a good game from a "AAA" developer but it's clear through New Vegas that only the original developers have any sense of making a good fallout game.
---
Fallout 3, and 4 weren't great but playable. Once.
---
Fallout 76 is hardly playable, even still.
---
ES6 being on the same engine is a solid no thanks for me.
---
Lesson to be learned: dont preorder games even if it means getting into a "beta".
---
Oh my downvotes. Here is an Upvote for you, its funny because its true. 
---
Thats what happens with melee. It can one shot any regular enemy and obliterate the queen in seconds when she is on the Groundation.
---
If mules carrying tons of material is causing server issues why don't we just get rid all of the weapons that are unusable in the game?..... Could probably free up a lot of memory by getting rid of useless perk cards like Demolition, Rifleman, gun runner, etc.
---
Penis. 
---
That’s not entirely true though. 
---
1) they nerfed those two attributes, then also gutted the demolition perk which ultimately turned all explosive weapons into senseless explosive weapons.
---
2) the two shot and explosive mods now do less damage each than most other damage increasing mods. Zealots/hunter/slayer/etc. all do 30% increases. Of course their drawbacks are that they only deal that to specific enemies, but now 2 shot only does 20% and still destroys your weapon accuracy. Thats not bringing it in line, that’s dragging it to the bottom.
---
3) TSE was OP, but so is melee. By dragging TSE to the bottom, all Bethesda has done pvp and pve wise is make the imbalance between weapons that more lopsided. Melee has yet to be be brought in line, and they won’t fix energy weapons, they’ve gutted explosives, they’ve ignored pistols, etc.
---
Yeah fuck OP, his experience isn’t what YouTube told people to think therefore it’s wrong 
---
How Reddit can downvote anyone using MYOPIC correctly is beyond me :)
---
people would find a way around that like they did with duping, multiple times
---
+ karma
---
[Adaptation. It’s a Wasteland!](https://youtu.be/EUeAOUkUVO0) 
---
I killed one today with plenty of time left and got no loot
---
Yeah I like how I was 2 points  away from fitting 5 explosive demolitions and now I probably have to waste lvls into putting INT back into AGI to go stealth build. At my level it takes like 3 days of regular 4-5 hours a day to level up.
---
Have you ever seen the damage my Super Sledge does?
---
I agree with the respec I don't want a refund the game can still be fun but don't make me spend weeks resetting all my perks to another build even if it costs 1k caps to do make it possible please 
---
I honestly don’t think anyone at Bethesda is actually “playing” the game. Just some guy/girl sitting behind spreadsheets of numbers telling us what is “balanced”. Starting to hate this game.
---
This time? Oh boy. 
---
Most of the clothing, with the exception of hats, costs more than that.
---
&gt; I can't understand how, in three years, no one felt the need to fix these.
---
You are fortunate that these issues are incomprehensible to you. I bet your career is rewarding. ;)
---
For one, it is possible that their code base and tool chain is so fragile and weird that things which seem simple are very time consuming. I have seen technical debt just fucking *crush* places more than one project. (Based on what the mod community does I doubt this is a great explanation for many Beth bugs.)
---
For another, it is possible that there are gatekeepers who are all *this is fine* and roadblock people who want to make changes for inscrutable personal reasons. I have been in meetings about fixing typos: we had the meeting because the guy in charge wouldn't agree to let someone fix it because reasons, and at the end of the meeting, he still wouldn't, because reasons. Well, OK. Your door says "director" so you get to make the call. 
---
Another time, we had a feature ready to go, complete, QAd, *it even worked* and the whole thing was canceled because the team could not agree on where to put the single button required to launch the feature. Uh, ok. 
---
I have also worked at places where the devs literally only worked on things they wanted to work on. "Oh, that bug is boring? I'm not going to touch it, and the dev manager will back me up. Instead we're going to work on this other thing that no one asked for... for months." That is an extreme example, but I have absolutely seen it. 
---
Beyond belief? No. We're living it. Beyond excusing? Definitely. Clearly, it IS possible to make good games with reasonable bug counts and patch days....
---
You know what would really help? Hiring a better quality assurance team. Or any, for that matter. I can live with bugs and garbage like that at launch, because I never expect a launch to be flawless. But this game has been out for just about two months now and it feels like they haven't even scratched the surface of what they need to do to make this the game they wanted to release. They say they are listening to the fans, but are they? They keep "fixing" all the non-problems and ignoring most of the actual issues players are having. Gameplay wise, I don't know whether I'm frustrated or bored or both. Being either this early in a game's life is not a good sign.
---
It's not only about the TSE nerfs. They started nerfing before this and they will keep on nerfing making your future builds useless. Tell me why would i start a new build now, when there's a chance in 1 month they nerf it into the ground? 
---
Im gonna become a salty little Reddit lurker too. Silently downvoting every post sorted by new, just scrolling down and clicking,  all butthurt lmao.
---
yeah, I use a vampire death claw, an anti-armor power fist, and a executioner grognak axe -- all with 90% weight reduction and +40% swing speed. I fully expect the 40% swing speed to be nerfed within the next month or two.  
---
If I can't one shot it, it certainly is dead before it can get in a hit.  
---
Actually, I'm not sure what will get the nerf bat next -- melee weapons or mutations or even just class freak. 
---
But yeah, even though I didn't use TSEs except for on the SBQ to get her to land, I'm certainly not celebrating the beginning of heavy handed nerfs.
---
Especially since a sweetroll, grape mentats and a brew beer will buff most people to 10 charisma.
---
That's a whopping 10 caps savings on 339 caps  "bulk Ballistic Fiber"
---
No dude that is not the problem
---
That is very strange. I will test it myself when I can. Unless it's been changed at some point.
---
Yeah, their reticle was in the wrong position.
---
I have 18 endurance, a set of heavy Combat armor with multiple pve buffs and the dense mod. Mobs, adds, SBs, and now 95 percent of players can’t even get me down to 75 percent. 
---
I can send you a clip over Xbox of me killing a man with BINOCULARS, BOARDS, things that are total junk. It’s impossible to kill or die in this game.
---
You can recall his penis, and it no doubt reinforces your love of them. I see. Well that’s something. No doubt with more therapy you’ll be able to recall much more too. I’m glad I can help.
---
If you moved your camp its possible the tamed deathclaw is travelling from your last camp to the new one so unless it dies during travel your build budget is still going be 40% used.
---
Upkeep simulator. That is so accurate. Sometimes I sign in with the intention of dropping a nuke. I sign in, realize I’d have to farm for materials to fix my weapons and armor for hours before even getting started on the objective I originally started playing for.
---
Energy weapons, explosives, pistols, rifles need a weight reduction perk
---
https://imgur.com/a/mBrFks4 ?
---
I agree with you. I really dont get it why they let us scrap the bulk before we can use it in our camp or at workshops. It's a real pain in the ass workaround to go crafting.
---
I joined an SBQ at 10mins left and it hadnt even regen’d its health yet. I shot 20 mini nukes with my TS fatman + demolition expert x5 + explosive bobble head... barely budged her health and my weapon broke. Good times.
---
Borderlands 2 is a hoot, do give it a shot!
---
I wish it would just reset always at a certain time make life easier then this 24hrs timer.
---
Yeah, it should act as the perk in Skyrim does. The perk enables you to sell any item to a vendor (i.e. plans or ammo), and increases the amount of caps available according to your level of Hard Bargain.
---
Show exactly where OP complained about "not being able to one shot".  Please show exactly where this was said. 
---
That's not very reassuring when I've only had a handful of 3* legendary drops in 300 hours of play.
---
No, do give up and turn everything over to the community that's historically made every Bethesda game into a decent title.
---
Why are you so important that Bethesda should cater the development of this game to your specific individual needs?
---
Well said. 
---
Bwaa ha ha haa!! that's one way to put it 👌
---
tbh-- doesnt matter. Ive given bethesda since  BETA to fix this fucking shitshow. They have 4 fucking studios, but apparently cant fucking version check? PATHETIC! And you are too for kissing their asses when its so clear they dont respect their playerbase, the franchise, the lore OR YOU. 
---
Also as someone working in game development, this is not devs fault, poor release management, lack of regression testing and endless meeting is what gets in the way.
---
Does it shoot explosive bullets? Then why does it do more than my explosive bullet shooting paperweight?
---
24,000 caps... for 1 mutation serum... seriously?!
---
I refuse to follow the instructions in your username!
---
It's a hard row to hoe.  If you let people walk and fast travel overencumbered, nobody would ever bother being unencumbered because they will just carry everything anyway.  If you punish them too harshly for being overencumbered, they yell for blood for punishing them with a mechanic that makes them have to toss 25k tin cans.
---
I see the system as proposed as a middle ground.  I think they thought people would scrap everything, sell or trade or gift legendaries they didn't need, and basically take the weight limit as a goal.  (Full disclosure, I have been overencumberance free for a whole month.  I learned to let go.  And properly select my perks.). High weapon damage and ammunition burn would give you something to spend your scrap on, and the vendor cap limits would encourage you to either seek out all the factions and/or participate in trade.
---
That's what they wanted, so the encumberance system was designed to let you hold it to a local scrapper table without making multiple trips, and using the stash system to keep your shit repaired and fuelled at those same stations.
---
Alas, they didn't plan for hoarder players (just about everyone until they learn to love the bomb... Stash.) who can't let a single tin can go to waste, or a single crossbow bolt be unshot.  These players have many mule characters acting like poor men's stashes with literally tons of crap, which they then complain they have to abuse game mechanics to hoarder, and then whine that swapping in their entire-planetary-system inventories for trade makes the game unstable.
---
Look, I love hoarding as much as the next scavver; I would love more space but, even more, I want ways to show off my junk in the camp.  They tried to compromise, but it's obviously not working.  Hoarders would rather take down a hundred servers than drop a single old world banknote.  Dupers abuse the mechanics for their nefarious deeds.
---
What else can you do?
---
"Single action revolver ivory grip" 85,000 caps.
---
This^^^ would be the result.
---
If they don't need a change in leadership, what do they need? The current ones aren't cutting it - clearly. The game sucks and is barely playable. 
---
Super sledge wasn't the focus of a massive duping epidemic. The game doesn't flood with insane amounts of copied TSEs, Beth doesn't nerf them out of existence. Again, seemed pretty obvious they were going to gimp TSEs eventually. 
---
It's already the largest joke in the industry though.   
---
Our priorities aren’t their priorities? We are the users, which makes our priorities priority. lol We are keeping their lights on.
---
Honestly nukes don't seem worth the time now that tse being nerf it would take lot longer to go through and if you brought a whole group in there would be ton more robots to deal with, if you are melee build then it probably would be fine. Hope in the future they change nuke zones to all have a different boss spawn to make each zone worth the time to nuke.
---
Even min maxing of perks they break faster than any other weapon in game.
---
Proving lies! Thank God OP posted this amirite
---
I'm thinking the same thing because I was at Watoga earlier today and didn't see the Heavy Combat Torso. I'm past 50 so level gating shouldn't be an issue.
---
Killed my first sbq tonight as well! We got there with 3/4 of the health left, took about 5 minutes. Got some plans out of that too. 
---
I’m not complaining, but I do expect a melee nerf down the line. 
---
This is really beside the point. If you have one unit of bulk aluminum, then that is 10 aluminum and you should be able to use it in crafting. 
---
This is yet another poor game design choice by Bethesda, not a problem with anything that the OP did. 
---
F Student.
---
There goes another "true" Fallout fan. F...
---
I think we're already there. 
---
I came to F76 from DbD. Have over 1K hours but those devs are doing the same : nerf,buff,nerf,buff. Killers were bullied for too long and then they buffed killers to the point where i was getting 4K every match. I was happy to try F76 but after 3 months i am going back to my DbD soon
---
I use an explosive (not two shot) revolver. I wasn’t one shotting anything near my level before, and I’m certainly not one shotting anything at all now.  Keep in mind that these nerds affect people that didn’t have god tier weaponry as well. 
---
I disagree firmly about the two sticks and a roll of duct tape line. Everything else tho-- right on the money. 
---
It's not the dev team, it's whoever the product manager is for this game. As for continually-recurring bugs, I'd say that's a broader engine and tools issue; the higher-ups should be taking responsibility for that stuff.
---
Rad worms gives a buff lol....
---
*correction:* Ultracite PA armor parts plans
---
(Which are now free to alllol)
---
Activate the quest on your pipboy. It will eventually show you quest markers for remaining enemies or tell you to claim the bench if there are none.
---
Sometimes the quest activates on its own. Sometimes you have to activate it.
---
Yeah, it's an organizational failure, I agree. But that's the same organization that would be shaping anything we would wish for.
---
How, oh wise cap master, do you amass the wealth such as your own, in the wasteland?!?
---
Slightly /s, but also, how do people have thousands of caps? The MOST I've ever possessed is probably 1400. Honestly, am I NOT supposed to be buying anything? 
---
See ya Fireproof perks
---
I honestly dont even know how to respond to you. I'm venting and you've gotta come in here and be a dick about losing "credibility." I'm not writing a damned academic paper, I'm posting on an app about a patch in a video game that has me frustrated. 
---
But if we wanna be exact, it took 1 to the head and his level 22 Mr. Gutsy buddy took the 5 shots. Does that make you feel better? 
---
This is pretty hard to watch, I love this game with a deep passion. 
---
I feel like they should be going ham on UI streamlining, action bar customization, trade and item exchange / containers to help get it done (because the broken drop bag and trading UI that exist now are unacceptable)... instead we have this fail of a patch and an apparent focus on a new PVP ruleset mode that I can possibly see having fun trying, only after the above mentioned very broken areas are worked on with focus and are accomplished.
---
It can be  alot of fun if we can reach the destination suggested by the game's vision - rebuilding america. so players can have a more permanent impact on the world and other players, in groups progressing in level toward their TOWNS or similar clan like leveling up that has to do with RE building.
---
I got my ass handed to me in a cave, so I found the nearest player near me to invite me to the team. Me: 59, him: 113. He invited me to his CAMP, which was built on the SIDE of a cliff(I kept clipping on fast travel). It became an episode of Fallout Cribs. We traded a bunch of plans, finished a mission part, and then visited various vendors.
---
There's a TON of plans now available. We found just about damn near every one available for power armor mods, at a high cost. He had the highest elevation of any CAMP I have been to. Powered signs, the works. With him, I finished my X-01 armor after a lockup.
---
We had a good time, despite my nerfing of my rifle I may or have may not gotten from the back of a truck. 
---
Correction: Not a first person shooter but instead a hack and slash grindfest since only melee builds are allowed to be op apparently.
---
I don't even have a melee build and my instigating Super Sledge does over 400 damage.
---
Melee is way OP in this game.
---
because people who didn't exploit or dupe shouldn't be punished. This patch screwed legitimate casual players.
---
They will probably remove the caps limit on vendors now in response to complaints, which will further punish legitimate casual players who already have trouble hitting that 1200 limit.
---
Laughable.
---
I'm going to have to serve jump 10x more to sell all my stuff.
---
NOW I have to unbundle things I want to use when the only way I make caps is by selling said bundled resources.. ..
---
No that’s OUR LORD AND SAVIOR RAD WORMS, enhancing your soul. Don’t lose rad worms or you’ll feel the buff in reverse.
---
I support your post but warn you to be weary when making claims that the game is dying.
---
If you keep threatening fate like that, you will see it really die.
---
Source: phenomenal experience.
---
Are you also having problems with half of the locations not counting towards the challenge? The one in Berkeley springs, abandoned big town, Sutton, giant teapot, and Morgantown did not count for me. I can’t find the one in Grafton either. Any one else have these issues?
---
Toss a grenade at them.
---
Super Mutant - "Go boom!"
---
This is so true 
---
if they raise the cap casual players are goign to get screwed harder. The prices are just too much. 18,000 for a serum...?
---
Casuals have already quit, man.  This game is work to play.
---
Wait. Do you mean if items are bulked they are not available when crafting or repairing?? 
---
Hey man, I am not defending the outcome, just trying to shine some light on how shit happens. 
---
I'm losing my faith here bethesda.
---
I’m grateful at the least for a feedback discussion had been approved by whomever and that we see ideas brought up by community are being implemented.
---
Not being able to use bulk scrap for crafting/repairing has really pissed me off. I bulk ALL my scrap; I use what I need, keep a mandatory minimum of certain components, and sell the surplus.
---
That process now has a tedious and pointless 4th step. Now, I have basically no crafting components when yesterday I had at least dozens, even hundreds of every components.
---
Honestly, screw this game now. I'm going back to Fallout 4, and I don't plan on being back until a DLC expansion comes out, and only then if it's reasonably priced. 
---
Could you explain to a layperson what “versioning” means?
---
Picking up all the weapons in one area is probably 1400 caps. 
---
Buddy guy let's go I need to see where OP said this.   Surely you're not just pulling this from your ass. 
---
Damn, well said !
---
It sounds like there was a problem with the last patch and, as an ad hoc measure, they did a roll back. What a joke. 
---
Nobody has!  That’s why I don’t understand the dupe complaining!  Save caps, buy what you want!  If they had a better RNG system and progression weapon system then there would be no need.  Just another way for developers to put their fuck ups on the gamers and not themselves.  Game is SUPER unbalanced anyway you chop it and they could care less.  Games need balance, especially online multiplayer games and this game has none.
---
I even feel that 600-809 is too high. My explosive western revolver did about 290 and I felt fairly powerful, although I still had challenges with many enemies. It now does 150. Thanks to the ridiculous power of TSE, my mid-tier weapons now do fuck all.
---
Congrats. You have a tank build. Nothing can kill you. Try a 2 END stealth build. Still hard to die... But if you get swarmed it can be interesting. 
---
Huh. Taking on a hulking mutated behemoth actually feels like you're taking on a towering crazy strong monster and not a rabid wild boar.
---
Fancy that.
---
We are used to getting thousands of hours from our Fallout games. Not just a few bug ridden hours.
---
After this patch I’m taking a break. I’m not even logging in to either of my main characters for fear of something getting fucked up with them.
---
I love some of the QoL updates, and find quite reasonable some of the balance changes.... but the amount of bugs being reported, and the clearly inconsistent implementation of new things and other changes... it’s like high school quality coding.
---
I’ll see you all in a month or two. 
---
The galleria has it own Red Rocket for the challenge. It not that one, but I have no idea where else it would be
---
Mini nukes? My character is a pure demo build and I've never seen my mini nukes do any damage to her, all her minons yeah they get obliterated. Wonder what type of Fatman they were using.
---
&gt; Bulking is primarily for enabling the scrap to be sold to vendors.
---
This is really beside the point.  There's no reason that bulked materials shouldn't be available for crafting, other than another arbitrary decision by Bethesda to make the game more tedious for no good reason. 
---
Sneak attack in VATS will most likely crit. 
---
This..sweet zombie jesus this!
---
The engine cannot handle space battles. I wouldn't risk it. 
---
Targeting non-hostiles makes absolutely zero sense in real-time.
---
Hang on, let me stop you before you get too far. The stimpak plan can be gained by just running events _or_ completing a story quest.
---
The only reason you would buy it is if you wanted it early (a shortcut). You have the option to put effort in any of three ways: events, story, caps. You have chosen caps and it appears it was a poor choice.
---
Your example makes no sense and doesn't at all apply to this game. You should try this game. The game you're playing on your own and complaining about is not this game.
---
That's because melee builds aren't a fun play style. If course everyone wanted powerful guns.
---
Have you been using a Super Sledge as a crutch?
---
Your TSE handmade does 92 with rifle perks? I have 0 rifle perks and I do over 100+ damage with mine. Also, Dick and Tom can still one shot people with melee builds and maybe if they had all damage and gun perks since I saw someone in a team floating one shotting lvl 65 scorch infected with gauss rifle or double barrel shotgun.
---
Interesting. I'm on PC too but the game is the most stable and smoothest it's been for me since as far back as I can remember.
---
Hope it stays that way.
---
Just because someone has a thought or opinion doesn't mean its right. 
---
I hope you’re happy Bethesda, you made my daughter cry.
---
it sucks because not only do you have to do chores, but the more you play with friends and explore, the more chores you have to do
---
if i log on to kind of drift along with my friends, then i am giving myself a bigger chore to craft ammo, repair my armor etc. even if we just idle around chatting, then my meat is rotting, food/hunger going up etc.
---
it creates a constant sense of urgency that doesnt lend well to the way the game is designed where you have to take your time, look around and read terminals/listen to holotapes if you want any lore. 
---
I guess so.  I have definitely heard horror stories and know I have lucked out at the places I have worked.  I suppose I assume that Bethesda would be a little bit more mindful of their IP and image to not let shit like this happen.  Clearly not the case /shrug
---
this totally screws casual players who didnt exploit or dupe.
---
This is going to sound like crazy talk, but hear me out...What if we had a tab that also showed what plans we learned? Like a recipe book or a plan folder. It could even show the things we already know when we open it. Maybe we could inspect the plans/recipies and even have it show the ingredients for them! 
---
Yea, the amazing lack of attention and common sense to so many things in this game is down right embarrassing. It also makes it painfully obvious that the dev's dont play the game from outside a command console or dont even test the changes. I'm as tired as everyone else from hearing the regurgitated bashing about using broken code from 3 games ago, but seriously Beth. 
---
Get. Your. Shit. Together.
---
Man, I don't even play this game but I am so tired of seeing complaints about it on the front page of /all. 
---
I am sure this will get downvoted or whatever but have you considered just playing a different game? You are not obligated to play fallout 76.
---
I highly doubt the game was "rolled back" - from a technical standpoint that seems implausible.
---
If it were so, some of the new fixes (e.g plans/notes you already own, now show "known") would not be in place. 
---
Sounds to me like the patch failed to properly intergrate and so you've got parts of new updated code (that are sucessfully patched) and the other parts were corrupted, so the game defaults to the original game files (as it cannot reference the new ones).
---
Totally speculating of course. 
---
Either way, had my fair share of bugs this evening - floating objects (benches, plates, boxes, weapons), enemies spawning in my face, power armor duplicating itself when I put it on, trade and interaction buttons failing to respond, random or laggy sound effects etc etc.
---
On the bright side, at least I didnt get disconnected. 
---
Man, I hate to admit it though and I know I shouldnt, but I personally still enjoy playing this game. 
---
Their promise to keep atom shop cosmetic only aside... Is it easy to earn $8 worth of atoms every week, really? This isn't a one-time thing, they're testing ways to suck people in to buying atoms. Ie., slippery slope. 
---
You get a little bit of caps when you clear the last one, if the mission is triggered to claim the workshop
---
Paragraphs please.
---
What part did they roll back to allow the old meathods of duping?
---
You’re missing the point, Ted. No one wants to use a fucking sledge.
---
No, no perks apply to them.
---
I thought the game was going to have mortality, but I was proven wrong at launch and now this update.
---
Bloodied melee friends and a horde of gulpers are sure a fight for me still, but nothing my 1k damage power Fist can’t demolish! I spent a lot of theory crafting and build planning on my man, but it’s only just now beginning to show, in all the wrong ways.
---
In Soviet Appalachia, I use Combat Knife to kill scorchbeast  
---
I used to Fear them, but now, I love them.
---
what about the bounty system?
---
raising vendor caps will just screw casuals who already have trouble hitting 1200 daily... the prices are just too high plan and simple.
---
Oh, and "since the plans are more common now", their prices are 5x to 10x their previous price! Enjoy!
---
I fast travelled and one of my favorite weapons was not on the wheel, I know when I logged in my wheel was full. Problem is I'm not sure if my weapon disappeared or if one of my legendary heavy weapons was unfavorited.
---
Passive mode? Or the passive mode bug?
---
I moved my camp roughly 15 in game feet to adjust my radius. He's slow rolling if he's walking. 
---
Plan: Signs &amp; Letters costs over 12,000 caps
---
You can make a max of 1,400 caps per day from vendors 
---
That means that you would have to max out the cap limit for **9 days** just to afford it. 
---
&gt; Do a google search first, might save some time.
---
&gt; Some awesome people have put spreadsheets together to demonstrate the effect of bulking on weight.
---
All of this is irrelevant to the OP's original point.  One unit of bulked aluminum is 10 aluminum, and it;s 10 aluminum that should be available for crafting. Period, If it is not, then it's simply more poor game design by Bethesda, not the fault of the person trying to do the crafting.   
---
Besides the fact I've paid $60 for it and invested hundreds of hours in it instead of wanting the game to be better I must just accept shitty, backwards changes and go play another game?
---
If you don't like it don't buy it? Let's ask EA how well that approach turned out. What's BFVs sales figures? 
---
I’m grinding mothman eggs now instead of boss fights. This is not enjoyable. I’m just server hopping. Im bored 
---
thats what i feared, total disaster
---
Disagree on the second statement champ. As to the first, I don't work at Bethesda, I don't know Bethesda employees, I don't know how Bethesda operates. What makes you think I'm qualified to talk about what the shit goes on at their studio? And what makes you think you're qualified? xD
---
The game can be frustrating, but I don't get this need to pretend we're game developers or studio executives.
---
They're fucking elbow deep in their own asses at this point, head first.
---
I don't matter how they do it, but a full respec option should be made available imo.
---
Well... we all know by now that the end game is severely lacking. Half the community is simply complaining. The other half seems split between people screening for more fixes and people screaming for more content. 
---
Well said; brace for downvotes. 
---
By felicia 
---
Reportedly, rad worms appears to (unintentionally) affect *everything* -- buffs and debuffs from mutations, chems, etc.
---
enjoy buying your 4 overpriced plans with your 20k caps lol
---
Weapon classification is currently a mess, sorry. 
---
So at what point did you start to believe they released an old version? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I love how fast people treat word of mouth like evidence here. xD
---
Iron sights/hip-fire failed?
---
I don’t disagree that bulked material should be available for crafting/repairing, but I don’t think that’s the reason for the change. 
---
As I said in another comment, I believe that BGS have included bulked material on their list of things that should not be allowed to scrap accidentally.
---
This is completely ridiculous.  I bit my tongue and rolled my eyes at every single patch note this time around but this bug is what actually puts me over the edge.   
---
Rollback this patch.  Stop fucking your own game to death.
---
I've yet to buy a PA mod blueprint from the vendors and I have basically everything but t51 jetpack
---
Please elaborate on “get your build together”. (Im serious I want to hear your tips)
---
Too late
---
Not all financial repercussions involve lawsuits. Paypal complaints would be plenty to get their accounts frozen.
---
It's a downvote kind of day. ;)
---
You want them to land more? Next time they land, they spit acid, damaging your weapon and armor! LOL
---
Now, this OP is an argument I can get behind. This is ArenaNet and Guild Wars 2 2012 all over again. Seriously, they really really need to go talk with MO over at ANET. Learn from the mistakes of others lol. 
---
I noticed this a few days ago prior to the patch. Once I equipped strange in numbers.
---
Now you have to grind caps instead.
---
But it can be acquired in game. You complete challenges daily and use your atom points on the costumes. I haven't spent a single dime on atoms and was able to buy a costume from free points. Your arguement is invalid, sorry.
---
Although I disagree with the demolition expert perk card Nerf the rest is entirely true they've ruined the game with the patch and I too have stopped playing have a nice day
---
Ive been playing since beta, selling literally everythign i find. I've only made just under 8000 caps, and held 6000 at my max. THIS IS A FUCKING STUPID CHANGE. 
---
No no still the worst patch. Want those plans that used to be 1500 caps? Suck it, they are now 7200 caps. 
---
I literally bought the stealth boy plan at the vendor last week for 1500 caps and now its 7200? That was it, im out, my kids are out, and all my friends have now preordered anthem. 
---
Useable? By removing explosive from them, they made them even worse. It's like they don't want us to use them... Ever. 
---
The house is on fire and you're looking to hang curtains.
---
I'm a sniper, I do just fine without TSE bullshit or supersledge. Stop making excuses, if the game isn't fun for you, play one of the thousands out there that might be. 
---
I hope they don't nerf melee.  I don't have any OP weapons, but I have one ghoul slayers combat knife, modded with serated.  Maxed out single handed perks and I blow through white springs.  Stab, stab, stab, and it's like a machine gun mowing them down.  I think with melee you have to be willing to take some damage, so it plays itself out.  I've only been playing a month (got it for a Christmas gift) and have never done any of these crazy OP builds.  My honest RNG hope is some seriously awesome legendary combat knife to drop.  STAB STAB STAB! :D
---
Good one, sleezy D
---
I said have, not like i'd pay for that anymore lol
---
Yeah it’s gonna be hard to solo a silo for sure.
---
I honestly think having these plans available to all is good and will create a better trading environment.It will also stop people from gouging other players with stupid prices like I have been seeing. 
---
Pot calling kettle black, eh?
---
I’m on both. Something needs to be done. The role players at level 24 are the minority. The guy farming the queen at level 120 is the majority. Slowing the Queen down and making stuff awful, and making the game more tedious isn’t a great idea. This patch along with the last one was a mile in the wrong direction
---
But it WAS relevant to the conversation we were having.
---
That’s unreal. They need balance.
---
the moment old, fixed fucking errors returned with the same exact problems that triggered them in the first place. flashing screens, vats unlocks, people able to get into my fucking armor and then when they give it back, it destroys itself. You got time? I got ALL FUCKING DAY to give you reasons why thsi game is a POS and why there's plenty of fucking evidence to see that this game is clearly not being checked for version before its edited. YOU DONT GET THE SAME OLD GLITCHES, 1:1 FROM A NEW PATCH WHERE THE ISSUE HAD BEEN RESOLVED BEFORE HAND. YOU are a tool. 
---
About the same here. Things seem very slow.
---
And in following the quests the game gives me, I have a couple of times found enemies that were not possible to best. Right now I am trying to see the Mayor of Grafton, I think it was... and it looks like the building has level 28 Super Mutants in it. Wat. 
---
Before that, there was the mine full of Scorched. I forget what level I was, but I did a couple of rooms and saw my ammo and stims would surely run out before I could finish. 
---
I am still having fun treating this like a single player game but the progression just feels screwy. 
---
I had it updated before trying the new patch out. So I don't think it was the culprit (unless the files changed themselves after I installed them, haha) 
---
I disagree. Game mechanics have always played second fiddle to the storytelling in Fallout, and the storytelling is still on point.
---
Yeah, I'm not playing this game until this bug is resolved. 
---
i’ve seen them on vendors today, i found some at harpers ferry and scattered train station vendors, try those again 
---
yes
---
JuiceHead: "Well evidentally the update was only one of the best in theory... It  seems like something happened where Bethesda somehow re-implemented a bunch of bugs that were previously patched.﻿"
---
It hurts them. They want that billion fortnight gets. Instead the atom revenue will get them a couple candy bars and some gas money.
---
This is so true.  Melee builds laughing since day one.  I could one shot stuff with my tse before patch, a melee could one shot that same enemy.  Pretty much tse is heavily nerfed while melee foams free and still OP (don’t want to hear they are more dangerous because they have to get closer) they should nerf melee too if they do this 
---
And now plans are available at vendors(damn near all the plans) so we can save for 'em
---
if you are the only one in the area and stumble into the spawning of the Grafton Day event it will spawn a higher level Grafton monster that in my experience has better loot, the armor it drops is absolute garbage tier tho
---
If it's to make to break for plans it doesn't have any mods as far as I know.
---
This is it, I am done. I vouched for this game thinking, hoping as time went on that it would only get better. Why the fuck are Bethesda so silent right now? I loved the Fallout series and kept coming back to this game patch after patch, and this is what I get for my time and money? This honestly breaks my heart to see a series that I love and care about get burnt to the ground in one patch. I am fucking done with Bethesda. Never buying a single fucking game from them on launch ever again. 
---
That's my game plan.
---
You do realize that this isn't Fallout 4........once so many players leave they shut the servers down. Careful what you wish for.
---
&gt;I have an explosive western revolver
---
&gt;not two shot
---
&gt;I looted it myself
---
&gt;does roughly the same damage as a sledge, I have 0 melee perks and all the pistol perks in the world.
---
Do you not see a problem? You’re making huge blanket statements. And no one needs to dupe a sledge with the All Rise being so easily obtained.
---
It seems to work when you take a picture of the sign with the prices on it, or maybe it’s the pumps themselves. 
---
so are you running to the 7 different faction vendors overburdened instead of fast traveling with that overburden, because as a casual I dont have 4 hours a day to run to all the vendors.
---
I have no issues i love it 
---
Not really, your just yelling into the void. Which i can understand since your mad. My issue is if enough people with no clue read what you write and belive it, then your just spreading misinformation. Go ahead and yell, but dont lie. 
---
You seem to be having difficulties playing the game, if your looking for advice there's plenty of threads on how to properly manage your inventory since you mentioned that was an issue. 
---
Depending on your build (you seem to be a rifleman) i suggest you ask around the subreddit. See if you can move special points around and optimize your build. 
---
You might be playing as a commando when your perks and gear say you should be playing as a long range sniper. 
---
If you like to get up close and personal maybe swap gear. A god roll light raider arm legendary can actually be worse then a heavy stock combat arm depending on your play style.
---
Even if you don't read all this at least i tried to help you reevaluate your position. 
---
I'm with you man. This was it for me as well. Last straw. I got my 200 hours in, almost all trophies, and a lot of fun. I got my money's worth.
---
In addition to all the new/old issues people have been mentioning my stability has been even worse today than since last patch. I'm just done. So many other games to play. 
---
i should remove explosions perk and add some perk to luck or endurance.  stick with my old 2H melee and forgert about tse rifle
---
Ive had that happen to me twice, both times there were no map markers at all I had to just quit
---
Me and friends got on tonight and played for maybe 30 minutes and said nope.  Haven’t touched it since. Waiting for Anthem to come out so I can bitch about that.  
---
That's some shit logic.  Most customer bases are filled with majority idiots. The whole "the customer is always right" mindset and has caused issues in and ruined already every industry. 
---
90% of the time,  and that's being generous, the customer isn't right. 90% of the time the customer doesn't know the difference between their ass and a whole in the ground. 
---
Just because people reee loud enough does not make these changes bad, it just makes the customers look like idiots.
---
15 mins to go!  
---
Ahhhh interesting. I think it should be the opposite though. If you have more people the enemies should be higher level. Keep the loot the same though cause that would be unfair for solo players.
---
I agree with most of what you said, except nerfs. TSE guns were *way* stronger than anything else. Even just TS or E was too strong on many guns. Scorchbeasts are bullet sponges, to be sure. The freak out about the white knight perk nerd is some of the most pathetic noob rage I have ever witnessed.
---
What happened?
---
Before patch 720 damage at full health and after patch it is 310 damage at full health, it sure doesn't seem to be working right to me.  The card is maxed.
---
I don't really like Juicehead but it's weird that he was unironic with the title of the video.
---
I was half expecting him to go "Here's is today's psych fun fact - I was just kidding. This was a terrible update. Psych!"
---
Knowing his style of content, he'll skim sub and tomorrow will post a video that is a complete 180 point out all the problems with the patch and saying how terrible it is.
---
Great job making my Bobby pins .1 again... 
---
Yeah I have seen underarmor clip through it.
---
How about everyone frustrated just simply stop spending any money at all in the atom shop? If they dont get any sales that bring on money maybe they will learn to listen the community.
---
I have disposable money and guess who wont be getting any of it? Bethesda, they fucked themselves right out of my wallet. 
---
Bought my friend the metal house plans for 500 caps last night. No biggie I'll buy myself some tomorrow. Oops now they are 1900 caps.
---
Idiotic.
---
Get it together Bethesda. 
---
good point, but while we are on the topic of quests, how about the fact that on average you get 25 caps per quest /event. so that's what... around 40 quests to equal the cost of the lowest costing plans on a vendor? 
---
Then don’t exchange it for a respec point. The point is it gives us more options and makes respeccing a little easier.
---
No
---
Including you 
---
Modern games, especially this one, are not widgets made in a factory, they're not commodities. They're highly collaborative works of art, dense with intellectual property. They can do whatever they want, and should. You aren't owed influence based on the purchase price you yielded to, any more than you should be influencing the next Beck album as a consumer. 
---
You were using a nerfed TSE
---
They said it isnt halved anymore but it is
---
CliffyB, is that you? :D
---
Edited, definitely not in passive mode, never have been on this character.
---
You don't even know what you are talking about, TSE did not one shot the strongest of all bosses, that was cause by stacking duped bobble heads and magazines. Most of the people with your opinion don't know what they are talking about.
---
I was using a level 15 pipe revolver rifle.
---
But... Okay lol
---
Something changed for sure, and I’m not sure what.
---
Also rads fully heal after multiple deaths
---
Well I am personally close to whitesprings and Gauley mine so it’s not such a bad trek. However, I make my money with bulk junk and meds mostly. I’m just saying that all vendors should be achievable for even casual players. 
---
So energy weapons have been nerfed with the inability to roll explosive. Really hoping the discussion on fixing them is serious. Between being weaker damage-wise,  the durability issues and problems with ash piles not giving loot if the enemy is killed SG a distance, they have quite a few issues.
---
And has anyone noticed if two-shot has been fixed with VATS or does every bullet still shoot off in random directions, despite a 95% hit chance? 
---
Vendors are far better now with plans being everywhere vs limited.  I just bought handmade gun plans at Watoga... and I’m far past the level limits previously seen.
---
However Whitesprings needs some adjustment as most decorative plans are overpriced... insanely so. 
---
The Fo4 bugs were present because the code was forked from Fo4 *before* Fo4 released. All of the post-release bug fixing that was done to Fo4 was (seemingly) never applied to Fo76.
---
Either you get it or you don't. 
---
Nope.  Just to make one tiered to my level.
---
This went on for like 2 minutes before I gave up, running and ADSing and hip firing and etc. I was not capable of damaging him.
---
Oh god I submitted a ticket asking about how to get the classic collection bc I used a different email to buy the game than my Bethesda account. Guess that won’t get fixed:/
---
There's a name I have not heard in a long time! 
---
This has been a goat rope from release day. For me:
---
1. Power Armor Edition is 5 days late. I bought an in store copy to be able to play on release day as I took the day off for it. Anyone need a copy?
---
2. PAE shows up w/ a cheap ass nylon bag and we are told to basically pound sand. Fortunately the backlash of that made Bethesda backpedal in a big way.
---
3. Power helmet doesnt work out of the box, I pulled it apart and it was a cold solder weld. Fixed it myself.
---
4. Cheap as "head ring" in the helmet breaks the same day. I give up on the helmet
---
5. More bugs than a Survivor episode, low stash limit, feeling grindy w/ repairs. Updates are sporadic and don't address my issues w/ game play. Biggest is I don't give a rats ass about PvP and from what I see while playing. No one else does to...
---
As I see it, this was a money grab. And I was a sucker that got in line and paid them in advance. And from there forward was a me being bent over a barrel. 
---
Lesson learned, I wont preorder another game. And there is no fucking way I will buy any Bethesda game w/o 30 days to pass to see what the gaming community consensus is.
---
White knight was stupidly OP. With that and lucky break (even 1 point) I virtually NEVER had to repair my armor. How much damage are you pathetic noobs taking? I hate being the asshole, but someone needs to say this: GET GOOD. Durability balance is a challenge, and that’s fine.
---
Not much at all but daily events and side quests if you didn’t do em all yet
---
You can grow plants on campfires. Weird but works last I checked.
---
It's kind of sad that you're seeking validation for you to stop playing the game.
---
Fine if you stop playing. Nothing wrong with that but do you really need other people to make you feel better about that decision?
---
I think it is for the duppers that they didn’t catch that have all the bulk junk dupped 
---
Honestly, I may log on for an hour or two to hit vendors and chat with my buddy but I'm definitely done playing for long sessions or in bigger teams. The junk unbulking was the last straw for me. Maybe I'll start playing more in a few months if things get sorted.
---
Sucks that they ruined explosives all together because they were too fucking stupid to realize that stacking twoshot and explosive was a bad idea. I have an explosive revolver (not tse) that now sucks because TSE was too powerful. Two shot is not OP, explosive is not OP, the two together are OP.
---
Yeah sad to see my build go to shit, back to 2h melee I guess.
---
My first login after patch seriously tickets me off. A glitch cost me quite a bit, and I've spent a lot of time already trying to fix and I'm only part way there.
---
On PC, I log in, camp is near Whitespring. I head into the golf house, couple more people in it too. I accidentally die because I didn't pay attention. Oops, whatever, I can go get my brown bag easily. Respawn and go back, it's on the stairs. However, it just keeps circling, everything I killed is doing the same. I tried picking up legendaries before I died but nothing popped on my screen. I check my inventory, all my junk was there so I shrugged it off and said goodbye to the crappy server.
---
Next server, guess what, it did take all my junk after all. And I was carrying the hard to get and essential stuff because it weighed less on me than in stash. Bye bye ballistic fiber, that for some reason is supremely difficult to get and everything takes it to repair at end game. That White Knight perk made that bearable because I didn't need to waste endless hours server hopping in hopes of finding one or two military ammo bags so I can just fix the one thing that's broken, I'll worry about the other about to break stuff later, because who wants to play a game that's all grinding. That's what life is for, if I wanted that is toss my computer out of the window.
---
And what made me lose it was that second server, someone griefed my CAMP, and due to Bethesda and their crap "fixes" not only can I not fix my armor, or weapons, now I'm with out power because some jerk got his jollies while I was out trying to re-farm all my damn junk they took from me.
---
I gave up, moved CAMP and am having to exist like a hobo until I can replace what was taken by Bethesda and their crappy bugs.
---
If anyone is on PC and wants to help or just group up and play, add me, Pandoramonium. 
---
Either they get it or they dont. 
---
I think the mobs scale to players in the area. The may have been a 20ish player in the area you saw the lvl28 super mutant. 
---
Will look into it, thanks!
---
In the eyes, heart, and GI tract.
---
I’m sickened.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it. It really is a fun game for a reasonable amount of time. However, at the risk of taking the wind out of your sails, Flatwoods definitely has the most dense amount of that sort of content. Most areas are more sparse. 
---
Sure, if you choose to play a game where you only get 25 caps and no other rewards, or choose to throw those rewards on the ground, or hoard all the fiber optic cable you can in case you might ever use it....
---
But in _this_ game there's enough trash on the ground, in enemies, and given as quest rewards that you can run a vendor out pretty quick. There's no limit to the quests you can do in a day and their rewards vary.
---
You can probably hit at least 2K in a 20 hour period by clearing 6 (in case you haven't reached Enclave) vendors, collecting caps from mobs (which are now guaranteed drops from many mobs), and selling the 30 stimpaks you end up with from event rewards.
---
That can get you a couple of Power Armor mod plans, a new weapon to play with, some armor upgrades.....
---
Bet you have sturdy frame equipped.
---
Bethesda, you nuked yourself. You can want a clinically level playing field, but what fun is that. There HAS TO BE someone stronger, and I’m not talking about the g.d. Scorchbeast queen. Let people play. Quit nerfing and start buffing. Make this game the blast you said it would be, otherwise its just kids in the backyard with a bb gun. 
---
I think they could be referring to the fact that they decided to patch 1 well known duping method that would only dupe 1 weapon at a time and not cause server instability, but chose not to patch the better known duping method that would cause servers to crash, thus either allowing people to continue  or change to the more detrimental method, which will just lead to more server instability. Obviously it would be best to just patch them both (Don't ask me why they didn't), but for us; the normal players, honestly may have been better if they had left it alone rather than force dupers towards a more destructive method.
---
I don't have access to enclaive, but I do got marsupine receipe learned. What's the price of serums now, and what it previously was?
---
(I think I should increase my prices)
---
REVERSE POWER BUG YAY! NOW ITS ALL USELESS!
---
soon , we should leave fo76 for many reasons 
---
I see what you did there
---
They released the patch notes at the same time as they have every other time, when they bring the servers down and the patch itself is available for download, no ulterior motive except the ones people have invented
---
I get this all the time in my X-01 PA but almost exclusively jumping to Harper's Ferry...
---
Free DLC is great and all but it’s seems to me these Developers mottos nowadays are “make a game, let them play for months, break a game, make them play for more months to grind for same shit basically, release payed DLC, repeat until they throw cut material from number 1 to number 2 with new cutscenes.  Just LAME! 
---
That makes some sense, thanks. 
---
The perk that makes sprinting not use up extra fusion core power also makes the jetpack not use fusion core. For me its just like fo4’s jetpack with ap only
---
 good point, but while we are on the topic of quests, how about the fact that on average you get 25 caps per quest /event. so that's what... around 40 quests to equal the cost of the lowest costing plans on a vendor? What about a new player who spends all his caps on that stickpack plan before he progresses to that point of the story? For the record, ive done all the quests and visited every location in the game. I have the stimpack recipe, it was just an example. 
---
Ultimately the goal of my complaining is to change the game. I'd like to play the game, if I didn't care about it I'd just leave and not complain. But I want to give bethesda a chance to fix it, even if I'm not there to play it later.
---
Yeah, it's definitely a downgrade but more fair this way, I believe it's a good trade off
---
False. Just learned large generator plan on an alt. All my other characters know this plan.
---
I submitted a ticket, because I grabbed a lot of raw flux, and I have "good with salt" on to keep it from decomposing too quickly, so I really don't want to have to log out. This is super annoying.
---
I thought he asked why people where leaving? Not for validation maybe I missed something. I’m curious myself  as what was the last straw for people. Mines been pretty much forced to wear PA
---
Patch seemed fine when I logged on today. Two big bugs, though: crafting wouldn’t use bulked materials, so I had to manually salvage them; and black screen on quit to desktop which requires cntl shift escape and using my arrow keys to force shut the game.
---
Run. *Intense music*
---
I never said devote time to become a melee god. Power armor + sledge is more than enough damage to take on anything level 40 - 60
---
Normally I just auto downvote H/W posts but I'll make an exception in this case.
---
Well played :)
---
Okay but I don’t see how knowingly advertising features your game doesn’t have isn’t as bad as not halving bounties.
---
My TSE shotty does less damage with all my explosive perks than a two shot shotty. What the fuck. I’m level 100 and now have to grind out a respec of current meta in hopes it isn’t a waste of time in the next round of nerfs from all the lowbie complainers that are basically crying because they don’t have what I have. 
---
=)
---
Rolling pin beats Explosive Shotgun confirmed
---
Hopefully it'll be a hotfix cause if it's not, people are going to be livid if they have to wait 2 weeks for it to be fixed.
---
use wepaon mods, gamma gun actually quite powerful for pvp.
---
Makes me wounder, How expensive Will mutations/ mutations recipes be? 
---
When a game reintroduces bugs and new ones pop up - time to realize these clowns don’t know what they’re doing.  Taking a break tilll the next patch... not fun anymore.
---
Although that had nothing to do with previous patches, so I guess I don't really help posts owner's argument. But the point still remains, whoever is planning the patches, f'd up.
---
Lol, willing to bet you don’t own a company...you know that wants return customers?  Because you can’t defend 90% of what has happened. I know - I’ve tried for the last 4 patches.  Friend after friend has walked away.  Hell, I even bought a copy for my brother in law 2 weeks ago!  The give em time to sort it out phase is over.  Fix it, or find someone who can. The shit show is burning down, and if management can’t acknowledge that, then they too are part of the problem.
---
My best friend lives in Texas and we “hang out” by playing games together.  We had a blast with Borderlands and Borderlands 2.  We hoped for that with FO76 but after today’s patch, I’m afraid we might be out.
---
Yep, so many loud and stupid voices crying out in unison. It’s like a pack of hyenas.
---
I play a lot less. I usually start it up for a quick run around to see if I meet any interesting people. It stops being a big investment unless you are the sort of person who really wants to get perfect legendary gear, in which case you'll be grinding for hoping for lucky drops.
---
ok but it is happening on my new character.
---
Wait, what?
---
Eh. They lose it over everything. They’re very excitable. I can’t really take this sub seriously most of the time. They easily believe and parrot *anything* even if it’s not confirmed. I’ll just keep on using my own experience and enjoyment of the game as a gauge. 
---
I’m not an explosive build, but I’ve always enjoyed the grenade launcher, not for single target damage, but for the blast AOE damage. So explosives have always been situational for me. Since I didn’t have the perks before, I’m not missing them now, but I can definitely empathize with the people that spec’d for it. For heavy weapons... I feel they are too weak, but also too light- I’d like to see them at 30 - 40 pounds and just absolutely devastating. For handguns.... I’m waiting for a dual wielding perk. 
---
I don’t believe you.
---
Already uninstalled . You should do the same.Even the blind fanboys will cry for players to come back when they realize their game will die and no more content added.
---
Bethesda was under criminal investigation for exactly what you just said...  
---
How is no mans sky?  I haven’t picked it up since before they had their first big patch a couple years ago 
---
Your so right, they “update” these games (betas) and break your hard work, then expect you to throw hundreds of more hours into the game to grind for the new “meta” or whatever.  It’s disgusting, 
---
Agreed 
---
Dude, dont patronize me. 
---
1. I know how to play the game 
---
2. I've already got a decent enough build (which, boy oh boy wouldn't you know I've already asked around reddit and they seem to agree) 
---
3. It appears from the downvotes other people dont agree with you either.
---
4. Inventory has been a problem for THE WHOLE COMMUNITY not just me. 
---
5. Take your sanctimonious advice and shove it  where the rads glow
---
Sbq feels like end game (early end game). She like the early world bosses of wow, so yes she does meet a standard of mmo. Many mmos take a little while before the first raid comes out. It is usually a month or 2 for blizz and so this being their first it kinda makes sense.
---
They already posted today thwu have content ready, they just dont want to release it till things are fixed
---
The Beta Wallace vs. The Vendor Chad 
---
Thank you for the reply and suggestion, I figured it out, it was the SavemyStuff mod. It was a mod that prevented favorited items from being dropped or sold. Was awesome, it will be missed.
---
I'm seeing very little angst about the TSE nerfs. I'm unhappy with **how** they nerfed it (should have disallowed those effects on the same weapon) because it demonstrates a willful desire on Bethesda's part to overreact and under think. I do not use TSE weapons and have no intention of ever using explosive legendary weapons.
---
I am, however, a user of explosives and am not pleased with the nerfing of Demolitions Expert. It's not that the damage has been reduced (I don't agree with that, but I'm not broken over it), but that it still is designed to use five perk slots. The perk was "over performing"? If that's the case then reduce the number of ranks down to three. Again a willful desire on Bethesda's part to overreact and under think.
---
 And BTW, the real issue with TSE was stacked bobbleheads.
---
I am no quitting, actually I got more reasons to stay, not thans to the patch. As time goes on, the game catches me more and more. This reflects my priorities and desires for what i bought the game for. I wanted to play on a fallout themed game with my friends so we could roleplay, like we always did since 2010. We are playing it.
---
This is a fairly ignorant post. Melee users are still one shotting everything (and not having to use ammo). I have an explosive revolver (not duped) that now sucks as a result of the duping and TSE. I agree TSE needed a nerf, but now any two shot or explosive (not tse) weapons suck, while TSE are still pretty decent. I agree some people complain for no reason, but many of us have valid concerns. 
---
Verified that it was the SaveMyStuff mod.
---
I haven't checked to see if there was an update.
---
The new patch does fix some of the auto scrapping of items.
---
But it also won't break down a bulked item to use for repairs or modding.
---
How do they not understand how their own game should work ?
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but dupping is still a thing. Youtube
---
Definitely a point if it was just me.
---
Looking at my friends list right now..................offline, offline, offline, offline, offline.
---
Hmmmm, doesn't seem like it's just me.
---
Yup 
---
*cries in console*
---
You are correct, it seems VATS criticals no longer build the crit meter. Used to be able to chain VATS crits with my shotgun.
---
Outrage is all the rage right now!

I've started playing Skyrim again in the past couple of days so after seeing the patch notes I hoped on to see how it was going to be. They took multiple steps back with this patch and it just made me sad. Being level 147 I feel like I've earned the right to be overpowered. I found an explosive gauss rifle at about level 50 and it carried me until I could purchase a TSE. Now that they are nerfed to hell I find myself not wanting to play and completely redo my character. I have 14 points into strength because I wanted as many weight reduction perks as possible since all the gun perks were in Perception. I physically cannot run a melee build because I would be damn near at the weight limit put into place. Melee is now the only way to get the feeling of being a high level player and I literally cannot run the perks. I loved this game and I hate saying that I'm going to stop playing for a while but until they actually put some effort into their game I'm out. 
---
&gt;Are you quitting fo76 after this patch? --&gt; I am &lt;--
---
When you're also leaving too, it smacks of validation.
---
This update just made the game unplayable for me. Specifically, the carry weight cap. I had no problem limping around the wasteland at a snail's pace, but forcing me to drop things from my inventory without increasing the stash limit ruined my game. I was at the Sunnytop Station trying to unload my weight when everything went pear-shaped. Three...THREE...scorchbeasts attacked. All of my armor was broken. My camp (just outside the station) was broken. I was killed. I couldn't even pick up my junk thanks to the new limit. Now I have all broken armor and a broken camp with no way to repair anything. I also can't cook any food or drinks. All because of this new carry weight limit. I tried to defend the game all this time, but now I can't even play. I guess I am going to head back to Fallout 4, because Fallout 76 is now completely unplayable.
---
Amen
---
Alright, I’ll concede that if you start a brand new toon post 1/29 patch it may be an issue, but my low level alt that I started a few days ago has no issue with this.
---
Agree... stop asking for aesthetics when the game itself still needs ALOT of help despite all these patches.
---
Can’t wait for the game to get out of Beta! 
---
I mean, there’s a lot of work to put in to be “god tier” melee and it’s still a pain in the ass sometimes when you have to physically run up to everything. The effort for melee is much higher than just getting a tse weapon and a few perks to buff whatever it was. 
---
If you get banned for using what seems like a harmless QoL mod then you can reach out to customer support and explain what you were using and should be unbanned. Now if you have cheat engine running while you play you can get banned for that. Bethesda is taking a very neutral stance with mods because they don't have tools to deal with any issues mods might cause to the players character but don't want to discourage modders from fixing their game. 
---
The fuck are you smoking that TSE's are now "worse than a mortal"?  They still provide one of the best damage boosts in the game only outmatched by builds that require you to be naked or near death.  Most legendary weapons come with restrictions like enemy type or time of day while TSE weapons still do equal or better damage against ALL enemies.
---
This happened to me on xbox too when in close proximity with other players.
---
You said legal, not financial
---
Tons of people quit today... He isn't alone. 
---
This has nothing to do with purchase price, and everything to do with delivering a product that satisfies users needs.
---
Comparing video games to music is laughable, not only because of the simile itself, but the fact you chose Beck of all artists.
---
Music is unilateral— its a podeum to which the artist speaks, and we listen, interpret, relish, savor etc. There are no direct interactions between the listener and Beck or his music. I cant magically change the tune of his guitar, or alter his voice to my preference.
---
Would you expect to listen to a Beck album one day, then the next day be presented with Russian Polka, from the same album?
---
Users govern how applications function, not the other way around. Bethesda should listen to its player base or it wont have one— simple as that.
---
Honestly I'd rather all the vendors share 1 larger cap pool than have to hop around to all the different vendors to make money. That way you only need to go to a different vendor if they have unique things you want to buy. It's a real waste of time and decreases my enjoyment when  I have to take a break from playing to go around selling all the stuff I looted.
---
This is very sound advice in a subreddit full of chaos.
---
He ask and I responded. Maybe stop looking at it like we are attacking the game ok. I like the game but I have no interest at the moment personally.
---
It's trying to tell you something, Fam
---
iirc they were under investigation for the canvas bag and “false advertising” when the game was really buggy after release. Why would they be criminally investigated for a bounty system in a video game?
---
I own an instigating Super Sledge with 40% power damage. It's more OP than the TSE minigun that I own.
---
If TSE was God mode.......melee is God mode also. My point is if I devote my time to shift to a melee build......will melee be nerfed also?
---
There really doesn't seem to be an in between. It's either God mode or shit with Fallout 76.
---
I think you're both speaking across purposes. He's not saying he couldn't learn the plan - he says he could. It's that all plans learned on another character show up across all characters as known, even if they are not for that specific character.
---
TSE needed a nerf imo. Maybe not as harsh as today’s nerf, but what were you doing before, like 1500 damage? Isn’t that excessive? Where’s the fun in one shotting everything. And now as a result, regular two shot or explosive guns now do absolutely fuck all. 
---
Didn't think you were, unlike most responses I get.
---
So at best 60 hp for a limited time is p2w?
---
Crazy
---
Maybe you should go make your own game. With Blackjack and hookers. 
---
That's a bummer. 
---
After some time though don't they just write that off as a lost cause?  Especially considering you, I and everyone else can see that Atom wouldn't even get close to that even in the best case like look at the crap that's in there who cares. 
---
That said, I admire your optimism on it.
---
Melee been OP since day one.  No nerf tho, just one shotting bullet sponges all day everyday 
---
New players have healing salves they can make _or_ earn stimpaks through quests.
---
Have you done a quest?
---
The only thing I found fun was rofl stomping the "end game" after grinding over 200 hours. Now my 200 hours is shit and I have to actually try? What is this crap? Why is it bad that if you waste your real life you become God in fake life? Now I wasted my life for nothing. Meh, whatever I'm sick of Bethesda anyway.
---
So by your logic should they just give everyone one shot weapons so they can maximize their fun?  This is a multiplayer online game, you have to balance "fun" with actual BALANCE so that you maintain a challenge, encourage varied builds and weapons and actually have a healthy game.
---
No, I’m saying plans that I’ve definitely learned on other characters still show as not known.
---
Always been a proponent of the game, but after this last patch, it is literally unplayable for me.  I click play, the game starts to load world, then I freeze, and crash to the desktop.  I tried running a scan and repair but that didn't fix the problem.  I'm not sure what to do to troubleshoot since there is no error or indication of a problem until the crash.
---
Not the bounty system... Falsly advertising features and content that wasn't even in the game. C'mon dude, dont act like you really didn't get that.
---
Yeah.Call me crazy but the BETA version was the best of them all, in my opinion.
---
Yeah i was being a bit hyberbolic. But the point still stands. Ppl are bitching about having the best weapons on the game (90+ perxent of whom didnt get then through legit drops. They paid caps or real cash to dupers) bc theyre only 2x more powerful than the next best thing.
---
My heart fking bleeds for them...
---
It’s not. BGS proper made the general story and world, but I think BGS Austin took over a lot earlier than Bethesda would care to admit.
---
most people don't go to Grafton because the other event is bugged and never works, but the Toxic Valley area is relatively low level anyway (the Grafton Monster for example is capped at level 40) but it's a great place to farm caps (it's always infested with super mutants) and xp (at higher levels you run into legendary radscorpions going in to and traveling from) but because its known as a buggy low-level area no one is ever around. the Grafton Monster is easy after level 50 with any kind of perk relating to shotguns and any shotgun, literally 3-4 shots and its done. 
---
I always run into the same monster in the channel running perpendicular to the Poseidon Energy plant and it's always level 10 but always has some kind of explosive 10mm on it 
---
I’m definitely taking a break til they balance everything. Guns need a buff, twoshot and explosive need a buff but shouldn’t be allowed on the same weapon. Melee needs a nerf. Bloodied + unyielding needs a nerf.
---
They’re making the mats farming even worse, and the game has become upkeep simulator.
---
You're not following. TSE weapons were supposed to be rare. Dupers made them common. This is Bethesda's fix. I could have told you a month ago this is what they were going to do. If you built your special around it anyways, well... I can't fix naive. 
---
Free demo this weekend
---
your still playing this shit? i mean come on its been out for 3 months and its still a mess, what are you expecting at this point?
---
see my edit there is proof.
---
If that's the case, you're the only person I've seen say it's working as intended. Lucky you!
---
I didn't watch any juicehead videos before now.
---
Biggest best update yet?
---
I won't be watching juicehead videos in the future.
---
I'm not quitting just taking a break for a while.  I was already getting kind of burned out, and this patch just took what little wind I have left out of my sails.  It wasn't the nerfs so much as it was the slew of new issues. 
---
I'll lurk around and keep an eye on how the game progresses. Perhaps pick it back up in a few months if it seems like it's on a better trajectory.  
---
I haven't played in a few months but to me it's a very relaxing game to play with your friends.   Sounds like a cop out to generalize and say "it's so much better" but that's the truth.  Give it a shot one day and I doubt you'll be disappointed. 
---
OK, so you spent a large portion of the free atoms you've earned on this item. This isn't just a one time thing, it's an experiment to figure out the best way to get people to spend atoms. What happens when they do it every week? Can you keep up earning enough free atoms to enjoy the bonuses? No, you can't. Have a little foresight. 
---
I think that these weapons had effectively broken the game (or at least one of the things that had).  They needed to be nerfed.
---
The problem that I have with buffing everything else is that it's easy to find yourself in a situation later down the road like Diablo 3 is in.
---
I kept trying each one multiple times, in each section of the bunker. After idling for twenty minutes in front of production, I finally got one to let me sell. Couldn't buy anything though, his inventory was completely empty. 
---
&gt; Is there any detriment (if this IS the reason) in Beth actually explaining that?
---
No, which is why i don't know why they haven't.
---
&gt;Letting the dupers know they are having their revenue throttled should hopefully cause them to react and get sloppy. Clean them up when they step out of the line.
---
They absolutely already know who the dupers are and i have no idea why they aren't taking action. Items have unique IDs and it's possible to tell that two (or 2,000) share the same unique ID from the back end. Chances are they're working on something that can crawl through the data and mark suspect accounts.
---
Wanting some balance isn’t hating fun. What kills fun for me is feeling like there’s a “must have” perk or weapon or whatever. Kind of like my frustration with power armor. I don’t want to use it but tough shit because it’s pretty necessary for nuke zones. Sure you can do things to mitigate damage and whatever but it’s hard to justify that when you can just casually enter your PA and be golden. 
---
That being said, I’d much rather they buff me than nerf other players. I get that some nerfs are necessary but their responses feel so ham fisted sometimes. Then you have actual dupers and cheaters that get tickled with feathers lmao. 
---
Went from 900-200 on my TSE combat shotgun. That 900 was including perk cards but they nerfed those too 
---
Respect for actually taking the time to make this both hilarious and fun to read.
---
yeah it murders unyielding builds, just trying to get assassin sentinels
---
Wait there is a plan to craft the skeleton outfit? Not that I need it badly for caps, Iam selling 45 wetsuit helmets every day for my 1400 caps, but still. Where u got that? 
---
This saved Diablo III and made it from not played to vibrant for 3-4 years.
---
He asked and I responded, stop thinking everyone is attacking the game.  Sounds like you trying to paint us as villains to justify your own feelings.
---
You spent about a dollar for every 10 hours of enjoyment. You have no leg to stand on.
---
So I wont be able to experience the two shot explosive at its finest, that's a let Down. 
---
After reading the linked "other methods" I changed my graphic settings from medium to high, just to see if bumping the graphic settings might help. I had crashed 5 times before the settings change and afterward I went right in. It seems to graphics related, but I can't tell you what specific setting made the difference for me.
---
I kinda figured it out after posting the comment. My fault :/. But afaik you got what was advertised; A multiplayer Fallout set in West Virginia. The features are there, they just didn’t all work on release. 
---
What do you mean armor piercing? How is that even a thing now?
---
Just a joke from patch day
---
Delete game
---
Yeah it doesnt matter at this point, i mean look at no mans sky, its now everything everyone had hoped for but its still a massive running joke and most refuse to even go back and try it.
---
Damage is done.......
---
Mmmm spaghetti. 
---
Depends. They allow you to craft heavy version of armor of mentioned kind.
---
But it won't be legendary so most likely it's not good.
---
Hey I've been a fan a fallout since 1 came out in 97. If you're looking for something to play that's like fallout 1&amp;2, check out wasteland 2 made by Brian Fargo yes you know who he is. Also check out Atom on steam its Fallout in Russia 
---
I can honestly say that this is the last Bethesda game I’ll ever flush $60 on.  God damn shame too.  Fallout and Elder Scrolls are two of my all time favorite franchises, but if you can’t trust a dev to put out a quality product, you certainly shouldn’t waste you’re time or money on them.
---
Then use a different fucking weapon.  Don't give a BS excuse like "But it's my main weapon!" because that didn't fucking fly with all of the melee builds bitching that they can't jump up and punch a Scorchbeast out of the sky and it isn't going to fly here.  Scorchbeasts are heavily armored and you're trying to kill them with a weapon type that does low damage and doesn't have armor penetration then no shit you're going to piss away all of your ammo.
---
Step 3 can't be content.  That's a four letter word in Bethesda's book.
---
Worse than anything you could ever say.  Content.
---
I'm going to die of some suspicious cause tonight.  
---
Please put this on my headstone "Bethesda does not equal Content"
---
It’s good to hear you are past the level limit. That was always a worry of mine that because I didn’t get to Watoga between 15-40 then I missed out. 
---
IMO there should be no max level to find a plan, only minimum levels. 
---
Wait. Or do another report.
---
I've reported a glitch that allows people to simply dupe items without screwing up the server they are on. 
---
I'm yet to see it get fixed or even mentioned.
---
You played it to death. You crazy people are going to get depressed if you play this much of a game at once. I urge you to get exercise and eat a balanced diet and find some other shit to do in addition to gaming.
---
Ya u did
---
Oooh, suddenly all dupers have green name tags above their heads. Vigilante PvP justice is dole'd out en masse.
---
Inb4 "these fgts all kept killing me cos I had 400 shotguns" nobody cares, champ.
---
But I have his dog helmet.  
---
Again I'll explain it to you. I am leaving this game, for the forseeable future. I want to leave something behind that shows bethesda I care about the game and that they have ruined what I enjoy about the game. If I do not seek "validation" as you call it or put my opinions out there, the game has no chance of changing. Seeking "validation" is healthy in medium amounts and every human being requires it (even you) in some shape or form. That doesn't mean it wasn't my decision to leave the game. If you believe otherwise or think you don't require validation at all think again you are very wrong.
---
I’m having same exact issue on my secondary character...🤦‍♂️
---
For me the worst experience i had was the base dupe bug. Every damn time i log in id have 88+ of each food that i had to manage. At first it was like a payday revenge for all the mislabled/duplicate patterns i bought. Then it became a burdon to where id have 1-1.5k overweight storage space. Why not just drop it..hell yeah i started too. But  logging in to play and only deal with that day after day / after server dc's was insane. How they let it go on for so long blew a circuit in my brain. At the time everyone i knew quit besides one guy i made friends with and it was happening to him too. So i imagine the  hundreds of players probably experienced the same struggle. 
---
Stop hoarding for a nucular apocalypse chief, it already happened.
---
Yessir.
---
My biggest issue is the nerf to two shot. If they wanted to gut explosive so hard, why hit two shot as well? Now they may as well be only useful together, which seems counter-intuitive at best..
---
I have a two-shot western revolver that is quite underpowered and is only going to be much worse now thanks to this nerf. The nerf should’ve been that the combination resulting in TSE just simply didn’t drop. 
---
Ive been to every vendor except graham and responder bot and the Spear plan is one of 7 or 8 plans i still cant find, so theyre probably event rewards.
---
Real helpful. Gee thanks.
---
Good too see you are enjoying the coop of the game man, wasn't really my thing tbh.
---
Even ESO lets you respec for free after major updates.
---
Ah, did not know that. As a primarily PA user wasn't a bug I ran into.
---
Soooooo does that mean artillery duping is back?  
---
Holy crap, did you pick the wrong day to come back. Wait another week...
---
Enjoy skyrim dude!
---
Why do you downvote them?
---
Mister sandman, maxed luck critical skills, and sneak attack.  Not sure man.  I sometimes soften them up with a musket blast from the dragon, but it’s not necessary. 
---
Bugs (many didn't matter)
---
Nerfs (white knight wtf really bethesda)
---
QOL we had mods for Known Plans already that worked BETTER than your fix.
---
We're starting to figure out CONTENT (despite it being 7 lettters) is a four letter dirty word to Bethesda.
---
No, zero health is nothing. 15 health is a broken promise. And you honestly believe this is as far as they want to push buying atoms on to players? They're trying to wedge their foot in the door, have a bit of foresight. 
---
Less worked than didn't. When more than 50% of the game doesnt work there is a problem. Reminds me of the lemon law on cars in GA., I cant knowingly sell you a peice of crap car that is fixed just enough to drive out the lot and then break down and thats essentially what they did. Never thought we would need such a law for something like this though, they should be ashamed of themselves.
---
Yeah that sucks man, good luck
---
Damage has been done. All the people i bought/traded with dropped inventories and stash boxes and quit.
---
I did the same, the white knight nerf did it for me with 0 rational explanation behind it.
---
Too right
---
Levels 45 and 50 are max, depending on item. 
---
It works my guy 
---
except most affixes is garbage so instead of buffing the garbage affixes it brought TSE down to garbage level
---
kek
---
So if they buffed all weapons up to TSE levels so everyone felt happy and included then what?  Everyone's one shotting max level enemies and the SBQ dies in minutes if not seconds?  Then everyone whines that the game is too easy so they have to make enemies harder?  But then people just start whining that enemies are all bullet sponges?
---
Your two cents are worth exactly that.  You can't  balance a game just by tossing bigger numbers at everything, sometimes you have to look at the ridiculous shit and bring it in line with everything else.
---
When you guys quit the game, feel free to quit the sub as well
---
no skin off my nose, just means the servers I'm on have 2 people instead of 3 while I play
---
...make us.
---
And let's nerf the weapons you've spent 200 hours finding so that you feel like a level 12 character at level 161!  And spend more ammo and repair your weapons more often as a result!  Oh and BTW, we nerfed the ammo factory!  But the PVP server no one wants will be ready soon!  And we'll nerf much more at that time, but won't document it.
---
&gt; Kind of like my frustration with power armor
---
if the  armor that is supposed to make you bad ass in teh fallout lore didn't make you bad ass then i might as well uninstall this game
---
My marine suit gloves clip through, and if I remove it, the hand clip through slightly. Seems they just missed fg it to cover the hand slot.
---
Other than that, its fantastic.
---
There is a specific list of the red rockets you need to go to.. Just hover your pointer on the challenge and it will show the locations. The one in Grafton is not on the list I think.
---
And that’s a fucking health risk. I fear for his mental health.
---
It wont let me fast travel. I even went to the very top right of the map. Still caution. I used VATS the entire time. No one around me. I even nuked miles around me. 
---
LOL. Best comment in the thread.
---
Cool... Did I say it affected you? 
---
This was my biggest issue. Apart from energy guns, non-legendary explosives are some of the worst in the game, even pre-patch. They did paltry damage and their ammo weighed a ton. Take the Fat Man for example. Around 500 base damage and a SINGLE SHOT weighs 6lb. Missiles were just as bad. The only decent one was the Auto Grenade Launcher, but it didn’t count as a heavy weapon (???) so it was always heavy while the Fat Man and missile launchers were reduced 90% by Bear Arms. 
---
Maybe two. Or four.  
---
By November you definitely might want to start it up again and give it a whirl.
---
That was kinda my point in "there's other things to do in life" but thanks for the reinforcement.
---
seems like you're one of the ones who can't take a joke
---
Often in software development, when you make changes to a codebase (i.e., all the files in a piece of software), you use a program that tracks the changes you make, as a part of a concept called version control. When you take an existing release of the code and change it, you often do so by creating a branch off of that code. And you can do this for any version of the code (i.e., you can branch off of earlier versions at will).
---
I think it's being suggested here that today's update was branched off of the version of the game that existed before the last update, thus meaning that the changes from the last update aren't in the game anymore, since those changes were upstream from the version this update was based off of.
---
More likelier, they just messed up the branch merge between this branch and the last update's branch, thus not keeping certain features (which, to be fair, can be pretty tricky to do correctly).
---
Yeah that's my primary issue with it the upkeep grinding part of the game is not fun at all. Just a chore. 
---
&gt;Inb4 "these fgts all kept killing me cos I had 400 shotguns" nobody cares, champ.
---
Not an excuse, you can have 5000 shotguns but as long as you got them all legit they will have different IDs. I think it would be hilarious to completely disable their ability to drop items that other people can see/pick up and ban them from trading. Like a hell-ban but in-game.
---
Nah tbh I'm kinda thinking of uninstalling until a content update...
---
How many people were buying off of eBay to actually make that lucrative? I bet a large number actually did leave because of the TSE nerf, namely anyone who bought one. I agree that a few really did leave for other changes, such as the more hardcore traders with the overencumbered change
---
I actually just alot organized pvp or would love to RP as a raider but alas I haven't found any groups that want to actually rp as raiders. The group's wanting to play as white knights and protectors are everywhere though.  I think it would be humorous to have the black sheep of fo76 band together under a ideal like for example being anti nukes, opposition to the overseers beliefs and teaching, trying to right injustices that occurred while in the vault, etc. Because seriously who really thinks at the end of the world everyone will hold hands and be friends. 
---
That works for me to. Reading all the salt today has been a hoot. 
---
Just seems you thought I was directing this at players, I'm not.
---
"You want to kill me?! I'll kill myself first!"  
---
Actually a fun read, havent had a problem with griefers myself, but I'll try to remember this one =)  
---
I am! Reliving the excitement of the game I had when it first came out is so awesome. Plus I can make a completely OP build with a bow and not have it nerfed because the bandits complained;) (just a joke don't down vote me to hell). I'm currently in the process of leveling my smithing to 100 which takes about 2,200 iron daggers.. Wish me luck lol!
---
You got to remember that they probably had millions of players before. Losing a few thousand is painful, no ifs ands or buts about that and I hate to see them go but it's not going to break the community in half. Anger, while hard, powerful, and loud subsides. I figure at the very least a quarter of those players will be back once Bethesda fixes these reversions and even more will be back once new content drops. 
---
Call me hopefully or blindedly optimistic and downvote me if you want. I refuse to be overzealously negative even when talking about their mistakes.
---
Side quests yes but the daily don't interest me that much 
---
Enjoy your break dude
---
Is there a different sub with karma restrictions?
---
Garbage?  Compared to what?  They're still FAR stronger than vanilla weapons and they're still stronger than the VAST majority of other legendary combinations.  The ONLY things they're weaker than are other insane combos like Berserker and Bloodied which ACTUALLY come with downsides to even slightly balance them out.  Stop trying to spin this shit into being the greatest tragedy in all of gaming just because your ridiculously OP weapon now only does great damage instead of one shoting everything.
---
Yeah every other shot use to be a crit but no longer after the patch. This was not in the patch notes so hopefully it was not intended but only bethesda knows.
---
It is pretty shitty they released the game in this state. They could have waited a year or two, actually fucking play-tested the game, and it could have been great. That’s what happened to a lot of the games I posted above, they were more focused on putting the hame out sooner rather than make sure it worked. Happens too much these days.
---
Seriously, I don't understand why they think that was a reasonable action. 
---
You’re not following. I’m not using a TSE, and I’m not using a duped weapon. Why am I being punished?
---
I also didn’t build my special around this. When I found an explosive revolver (I’m a vats pistol build), of course I decided to use it. I put maybe two points into the demolition expert perk. Those are the only two points I invested specifically because of this weapon. You need to relax and stop calling people naive because they disagree with you.
---
I agree TSE needed a nerf. However, explosive or two shot on their own isn’t even that strong. Melee bloodied + unyielding are still doing 1000 damage. 
---
Yeah, you literally picked the day of a patch that will spur thousands of people to quit the game
---
No, PC, seeing more people building their camp here. Probably safer from griefer
---
You’re welcome! Just thought I’d share after i went down a rabbit hole trying to figure out how the game was made and how much it cost, and the internet was completely scarce on information. I’m glad you appreciate it! 
---
Good point. I didn’t mean to put the whole “unbalanced” thing on you. I need to work on balance myself.
---
Myself and 5 of my freinds quit today and we hardly ever use TSE... The game is pretty much unplayable with this many bugs at once.
---
Actually, I'm running low on basics like wood and steel because I've had to pare down my stash so much. Most junk is less than 50 except for maybe 10 kinds which I allow to get up to 100. Most Aid I've capped at 5 in my stash except water and stimpacks. Only a couple bobbleheads. I do have 4 power armor frames there (T-51b, T60, X-01, and Ultracite), and keep Excavator on me for the carry weight when I need it. I've got a couple suits of armor (Combat and Urban Scout) as well as one piece of Marine armor I might want to swap out later. I've got a handful of heavy weapons I might want to use when they are actually worth a damn.
---
Half the issue is that it takes a fair amount of play time to understand what you need to hold on to. I feel like I've gotten there, but there isn't a whole lot to spare, and that 600 is just too damn low.
---
But hey, who am I to tell you how to play Fallout - Inventory Management? To each their own.
---
Worst case if all the craft items for base building were a dollar a pop id dive in. I feel a bunch more is owed to us as a player for creation. But if the pricing was reasonable compared to the 6 dollars for a floor pattern i wouldn't complain and instead of the zero they get they could have had a 20.
---
That would be a lot for the two people still working on this game to handle.
---
not at all dude. I was poking fun at the lack of players. peak any server I'm on during prime-time in EST is 18-20. since I picked the game up early April I've never been in a full server save for one time someone invited me with his full team so I could build him a garage door
---
You need a life. Do you just play 24/7?
---
These numbers don't quite add up.
---
Fair enough. I have not had this issue.
---
My boyfriend and I both quit after they "fixed" the second dupe glitch awhile back, sadly even if the game was running perfect there still wouldn't be any content, not sure if or when we will come back which is a shame we really liked it at launch.
---
I agree. I had more fun before I came on here or ever even saw TSE weapons lol
---
What a competent and compelling crowd. Ffs use your words, you’re trying to change the ideas of the developer. At this point riding the TSE train makes you look bad. It makes US look bad. Its done, let it go.
---
5000 hours equals over 208 days non stop. The game hasn't been out for 100 yet
---
Found 7 cap stashes all gave a single cap each....I would leave that out as a good way to make money.
---
Have you read a post? stimpack was just an example. do i really need to explain what an example is. Do people really read this post and focus in on stimpack as my complaint? LMAO
---
I wasn't wrong jerk...but keep fuming.  I'm sure there will be a long line of peeps that will enjoy exploiting your personality issues.
---
I'll make the gauss rifle for you if you don't have The caps for the plans :) (PC)
---
Haven't played much, just went around killing things to test out the TSE nerf. Can you toss out a few of them?
---
Judging by that superficial judgement? Definitely at least 16.
---
I mean, you should want to cure diseases right? Its supposed to be bad until you cure it.
---
People like you give everyone with legitimate complaints about the game a really bad reputation by association.
---
How did a multi-million company screw up in patch deployment?
---
Go ahead sue them, no one stopping ya.
---
They already got your money man, money from you and your wife, the couldn't care less.
---
I am also enjoying watching the player base dwendle so Bethesda can stop being supported and rewarded for constant failure.
---
Good development managers do "small changes" over time to adjust balance in the game.
---
Bad development managers do "huge triple nerfs" to completely ruin one aspect of the game.
---
I'll let you guess which one we have.
---
Someone seriously needs to hire some of the League of Legends balance team.  You might not LIKE the changes to a character, but it's not soul crushing debuffs that make them unplayable.
---
You're a fucking moron 
---
Assuming this is even true (let's say it is for now), while it explains things somewhat, it doesn't justify it in any way. Not saying you're using this as a justification. Just saying.
---
Like it seems pretty clear to the lay person that the coders are either really inexperienced and/or overwhelmed with the responsibility at hand, maybe due to a lack of staff or finances, or expertise or support from other studios. 
---
It shows with the solutions to bugs and game issues i.e. speed over quality e.g. solution to camp in the same location is just a prompt and not the option to "reroll" servers, ultra-wide support is just a stretched screen without UI elements being adjusted to suit the format etc.
---
Reintroducing the bobby pin weight issue with the latest patch is such a rookie mistake from a supposedly world-class AAA studio, even if it's the Austin studio that's mostly in charge of the game. 
---
It also shows with the terrible customer support that some people have gotten in the past. Anyone with even a modest amount of customer service background would be embarrassed at some of the things that have happened.
---
You may like the game and want to defend the legitimately good things in the game but you can never defend the studio's competency in the development of the game. It's just not possible.
---
Whatever the reality is, it's clear as day that some serious changes need to happen in the back end for this game to have any chance at a long life. More staff, more expertise, more money, better upper and middle management, whatever the solution they need it badly.
---
You want your money back, but still want to loose more money? Go and find a lawyer, it's your money to loose.
---
I agree they needed to be nerfed but not into the ground. The weapons are literally useless now.
---
STOP. NERFING. THE. GAME!!!
---
Acknowledge that you are needing things no one asked to nerf. Stop doing it! Fuck 
---
https://youtu.be/orDCkujaX1g
---
These are my exact feelings. You hit the nail on the head.
---
Love the series, defended the game at release and was hopeful for changes. It appeared they were on the right trafk, but this patch just proved their incompetence to me. I have my doubts that even a year from now the game will be in a respectable state.
---
I'll keep an eye on  it, but...good job, Bethesda, you sold me a turd for $80. 
---
I'm not downvoting, I just hope bethesda learns a lesson from all this... But I doubt it
---
Chhers!
---
Don't you see it? Our brother here has at least 3 accounts...
---
LOL I’m having a laugh attack as we speak.
---
The team that made FO4 should be ashamed of their work.
---
There is no disease half this bad in the entire game lol.
---
My pleasure 
---
Truth
---
Lmfao, can’t stop laughing.
---
I went down the list, all the ones I went to were on it. Some just didn’t work 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Na. Why put QC and testing as priorities in your build cycle, when you can whinge it instead?
---
So glad I paid 60$ to play a game the way they want me to.
---
Maybe but it’d be nice to have not using it be a valid option and not a rather large undertaking. Let’s not pretend they’ve taken the lore super seriously in this game lol. 
---
All enemies have pinpoint accuracy.  
---
Does it not look like Destiny meets Ironman?
---
Well I apoligize for the hostility 
---
They'll probably nerf that soon as Well 
---
Yeah, I will likely revisit on the 1 year anniversary. Plenty of other games to keep me busy until then.
---
I went to all of the ones on the list, some just didn’t work for me 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
When you equip and fire it, it doesn’t vanish?
---
Trolol 
---
Yeah raging bull here buddy...I'm so worked up...
---
I just got a proc for lucky break...I don’t even wear armor or have the perk equipped 
---
Low fov?
---
They're still only beat by shit like Bloodied that require you to actually put yourself at risk, compare that to all of the other legendary modifiers people automatically junk because they only work at night or on certain enemies and they're still great weapons, but people are just bitching because they can't one shot everything anymore.
---
Actually, FONV had Blackjack, slot machines, Thorn’s Red Lucy, Vault 21 Sara, etc. :-P
---
Mine went from 286 damage to 150. I could probably pick up and level 50 heavy melee weapon and do the same amount of damage with 5 strength and 0 perks.
---
I saw this and I swear i questioned if the game had been out that long or not lol
---
lol yeah I sometimes wonder if that's half the problem. They probably are skimming through someone else old code  trying to figure everything out.
---
I stopped playing just before the new year. It honestly feels like games these days are unfinished at release, I'm paying $60+ to beta test a new game. We are letting the companies get away with it. It's like they watched how many people bought Day Z standalone and were like "Fuck yea! Easy money from our idiot player base!". 
---
Don't misunderstand me. I get that games will be buggy at release, but it's undeniable that it's worse these days compared to the past. 
---
They keep cranking out games faster and faster, and more often then not it's the same issues that need fixed. Lever gun reload bug persisting for two games? They don't care about their product and they don't care about their player base.
---
I think this is my last stop on the fallout train, more than likely TES too. I really from the bottom of my heart hope that more gamers wake up and stop letting these developers treat them like piñatas.
---
Although I stopped playing the game after a while. I remember I was forced in a race to choose and upgrade the perks which worked against the game simply being more tedious and ultimately incredibly frustrating. If anything, they should severely scale down on repair, item limits and the way item drops work. 
---
I've got about 25hrs in and I couldn't do it... made me so sad...
---
Damn. ..ouch... But, agreed..
---
Had the opposite issue. Bought a plan that did not say known, went to read it and in my pipboy it said known and wouldn't read. I had already read it prior apparently. 
---
Can I have your caps before you quit? I need them for the plans. The inflation is crazy!
---
Explosives and heavies were bad before the patch.  I tried running a heavy build and ended up with TSEs instead.  The auto grenade launcher was fun, but woefully underpowered (and buggy, sometimes wouldn’t fire). It’s not classified as a heavy weapon either which means it’ll always be heavy. Missile Launchers do pathetic amounts of damage, only mitigated by having rank 5 demo expert (which has now been nerfed) and having the tracking computer.  This wouldn’t be bad if missiles weren’t 2lb each. 
---
Fat Mans are all but useless. Sure, they’re only 2lb with Bear Arms, but the ammo still has a base weight of 6lb per shot. Ordnance Express helps with this, but now you’re up to 6 points in weight reduction perks just to carry the damn things around. 
---
And let’s no forget the LMG. Eats through 308 like nothing else can, yet has a pathetic base damage of just 16. The Laser Gatling and Mini-Gun are in the same boat. 
---
Don't let the door hit ya where evolution split ya.
---
Here are some but not all. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cap stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot are useless now leaving only melee.
---
I'm assuming you didn't get a clip or a pic?
---
I understand man finally got that 7600 hour achievement and i got nothing left to do.... 
---
We'll see. I'm confident in them given what bugs they HAVE fixed. It's a pretty damn long list and looking at one of my posts from earlier, if that's all they need to re-fix, I think they'll be in decent shape. 
---
I would say if there's ever time for an emergency patch, it's now. Let's hope we hear from them over the next few days on that. They may wanna work in a couple more bug fixes and not go through whatever console submission process for just a few things. 
---
What do I know though? Not a dev haha
---
I cant find two of them. sad really.
---
This. Software QA is often neutered. Not properly integrated from the design phase through implementation.
---
The best developers love that QA finds issues because they don’t want to ship shit code.
---
The best architects love that QA highlights gaps in design early on before they become major obstacle to deal with.
---
The best Project Managers don’t see QA as that last bastion of pressure before a release, but the absolutely necessary lever to position a project for its best success.
---
Many game companies… many companies in general… cut quality in the service of an arbitrary ship date… which in the end is almost always leaving everyone in the delivery pipeline, including the customers frustrated and dissatisfied. 
---
Guess who cares about your youtube video? No one clickbait trash.
---
Do you know how stupid this sounds? 
---
no worries dude, you need to take everything on this subreddit with a grain of salt tho
---
I highly disagree. They’re easier to solo than with a group because you get less spawns. In the last room in a solo run, I get like 3 robots spawning, whereas in a group of 3 it’s more like 30
---
vocal minority
---
I didn’t want karma. I wanted laughs and to lighten the mood. I succeeded for myself, HAHA.
---
Oh, they're still coming, bet. They're just trying to get their foot in the door first with shady attempts like the unstoppables outfit buff, so they have an excuse to fall back on... "Whaat? Not like we haven't done anything like this before, and no one had issues then!"
---
All my tickets were ignored, or got the same robotic response. Bethda's support is trash. Hell, let's be real, Bethesda is trash. They got my $260, they don't give a fuck about me now.
---
Didnt say in this post that I quit... But I am taking a break until they get it together.
---
It increases weight to bulk for everything except aluminum and lead. For some fucking reason. But I assume you're okay with that as well for the convenience.
---
I got two answers in less than a day. Advised me to forward web server ports to my PC to address a freezing issue...
---
Hopefully people will get fed up with this bs and stop buying these games en masse and these companies will stop selling half finished games and sell the rest as dlc ^^activision
---
I got it but can't seem to post here. XD.
---
I kinda an new to Reddit. How do I post that anyway
---
At this rate, the game would be dead before it's first anniversary on November 2019.
---
I had it proc and I don't even have the damn perk. Noticed it when running the generals steakhouse.
---
To discourage the practice.
---
Not against the practice in principle (though screw dupers) but there are more appropriate forums for this kind of thing. Discord, other subs dedicated to buying and selling etc.
---
Mods won't do anything (if they're even around) so I auto-downvote.
---
Millions of players? Do you have any idea what you're talking about? Or just grabbing a big number out of thin air?
---
Thank you, brother. This is a difficult time.
---
By "balance changes" you mean "nerfs" and by bug fixes you mean "more bugs". This is getting fucking old, guys. 
---
Just been getting flamed for pointing out returned bugs all day
---
I’ll be back when they undo the nerf. I’m all for nerfing a bit but they made the guns useless now. I have to use 2 rounds for a bloodbug now lol. 
---
Now, let's remember that in reddit when people say that they quit, it really does not mean that they quit. Many of the "quitters" just want attention.
---
Then you're never going to play because it's a stupid fucking mentality.  If you just keep making every single weapon stronger then ultimately you're going to have to make the enemies tougher so people aren't one shotting everything in sight.
---
Thank you. Yes.
---
When they do balance changes, they should balance ALL of the things at once.
---
Then hand out respecs.
---
Also......
---
Someone seriously needs to hire some of the League of Legends balance team. You might not LIKE the changes to a character, but it's not soul crushing debuffs that make them unplayable.
---
Mine silver and gold, transmute solver into gold, make gold jewellery with all those random jewels you find, sell it. Good XP and money!
---
There's a Black Cowboy hat on a skeleton in a car on the road between Lady Janet's Soft Serve and Wilson's Auto Repair.  Gotten it there a few times now.

My strongest weapon is still a 3 star fire axe and I don’t use any 2H perks. All my STR perks are carry weight related (as if there’s room for anything else)
---
I play a stealth rifleman and I can’t even get a legendary rifle. 
---
The nerf is BS for two shot weapons. They were never op to begin with. 
---
Am following up now on your support ticket - apologies for the delay on my part mate. Have DM'd you back just then
---
My damage was only around 350. I didn’t hard spec for it and was happy with what I had. I mostly do melee but not hardcore full on melee spec. It took 3-5 shots to kill a level 68 scorch. 2-4 swings with all rise to kill 68 scorch. Now my gun breaks after killing 2-3 enemies LOL. What the fuck was Bethesda thinking. Did they even test this shit?
---
Well from what I read Battlecry layed off a ton of staff in 2015/2016, and then started to look for replacements with experience in developing PS4 and Xbox One games. So maybe they never actually regained all of the manpower back after those lay offs. This is why I agree with you, there’s a ton of rookie mistakes, and this is the only answer with evidence that makes sense. 
---
I’m not justifying Bethesda’s actions, it seems they tried to cut corners in every way possible, but to me it explains a lot of what caused the game to be in this state and why it keeps slipping from patch to patch with different instability issues. This is literally all I could find on its development and I had to read between the lines in places, but this is overall the information I could gather on what likely occurred behind the scenes. 
---
I've probably had rad worms 10x more than all other diseases combined.
---
You are right though, if you get swarmed by ghouls(they are almost always in a group) and the first one gives you worms, you might get screwed by the rads the others give you.
---
Today was not a good day for them. I never had a TSE, if anything I appreciated other players having them to fight the queen. Never PVPd, so I had nothing to complain about TSEs.
---
But alas, I am one of those 350 hour players that is taking a break for a while. I hope they can recover their fan base after this mass exodus.
---
I dont want to return to an empty wasteland, but they gotta get their shit together. Bitching on here constantly about day 1 bugs isnt working, so I guess the only way to get through to them is for them to see a plunge in DAUs.
---
Sitting on 2k atoms waiting for the right power armor skin, nothing here for me 
---
They should have just called it Inventory Management Simulator 2018.
---
The people defending what happened with this patch are what i have trouble with.
---
Most just see that TSE and bobble, i dont. This was a lazy "attempt." For an update, they rolled the game back, duping was back again around the same time frame, mutations arent working, cap collector got nerfed secretly or is effected by this update.
---
They're still fixing things that shouldve been handled within a month or 2 of release.
---
That combined with all listed gave me and about 58 people no hope in it what so ever. And judging from the rest of the posts on here people feel the same.

 &gt; Am following up now on your support ticket - apologies for the delay on my part mate. Have DM'd you back just then
---
Sure. Like I said, nothing wrong with that.
---
Most people didn't need to validate their exit by asking others why they also quit after this patch.
---
I did and so did every friend I have and werent even big on TSE any more.
---
There's probably a Text somewhere when u download the game/launer start it. That Software is Provided as Is an some more legal bullshit preventing class action lawsuits.
---
That said i also want a refund 🤷‍♂️
---
Nope it's like it has unlimited durability 
---
I haven't fired it up today, but they fucking broke ultrawide?!?! That was fucking THREE PATCHES AGO or some shit.
---
How  
---
THE FUCK  
---
is a fuckup of that magnitude possible?
---
OP, you might not want someone's job over this, but fuck, I'm unemployed, let me come do the goddamn job of directing people on what shit to patch, I guarantee I could do a better job than this.
---
Pure fucking incompetence. And I LIKE the game. A lot. But this... This is just moronic. I didn't give a shit about the bags, or the rum, or any of the other actual controversies and definitely none of the non-issues, but trying to fix the game and breaking it worse? Are you fucking kidding me?
---
Me too.
---
I would've been happier if they said "next week but it includes Player Vending!"
---
What we got was a hot load of garbage.
---
How dare you flaunt such a mighty achievement, in this dark time, my brother? You know full well that I am still below 6000 hours.
---
I start losing faith. After the beta I realized this game will not be polished at launch and that was frustrating but okay. It worked somehow and the first patches seemed promising despite the fuck up where Bethesda tried to hide changes fom us.
---
But as of right now, I don't think Fallout 76 is worth getting time or money into. I do not think Bethesda is capable of pulling this game off and I highly doubt they'll properly support an MMO for the years to come. Looking over to my old MMO love The Elder Scrolls Online I just cannot see an equal level of community binding and maintenance/polish with Bethesda. I'm not sure if their team is too small or if they just don't care, but I hope that someone at Bethesda decides to reach out to the folks at ZeniMax again because they obviously need help from someone who's run an MMO before.
---
As for me, I think I'll return to another game for now and wait to see what Bethesda will do.
---
my group stop playing the only incentive i had that kepr me going was getting platinum which i did few days ago.. seeing my tse gun drop from 513 to 163 dmg was horrid. i dont pvp i only pve main reason i use tse is for queen  fights.. i usually waste about 600 to 1000 ammo on queen fights post patch.. dont even want to try anymore fighting queen.. maybe ill come back once new content comes out but for now ill take a break 
---
Yup. And the plasma Gatling bug is back too
---
I will say that the division has definitely approved tremendously since release. I was a beta player and picked it up day 1 of release, put it down after a month. Came back like 5-6 months ago and it's almost like a different game. They really worked hard and pulled it out of the fire. It's amazing what can be done when a company cares about its players and it's product.
---
What the fuck does "dwendle" mean? Are you trying to say "dwindle"? 
---
They definitely went overboard. I read someone’s comment saying they went from 1500 damage to 300, and that they should still do 600-800. I still find that excessive. My main weapon did 285 and I felt very strong most of the time. 800 is just overkill for anything but SBQ.
---
Lol... Cute edit. 
---
they need a test branch that needs to be two+ weeks behind official patch so they can test community response before pushing it. I would gladly join a testing branch
---

Cry me a fkin river.
---
Also been doing this but just buying iron ore when I buy the iron ingot and crafting gold rings. It seems to be keeping my gold at a pretty consistent number so it's not bankrupting my level 25 character. I just hit level 70 on my smithing and got myself a pretty decent glass bow forged, now it's time to sneak around some caves and get some satisfying sneak kills! 
---
I'm sorry, but what is the reason of QoL perks if not for alleviating game mechanisms you don't like ? You trade build efficiency for being able to relieve yourself of having to repair your armor every so often. If you diminish the return value of such perks, you remove the sense of progression of people who have still to struggle for shit they struggled for during their entire character progression.
---
When you're not a power armor user, the levels before white knight are rough: these are 40 levels where I essentially had to ditch and reconstruct my armor when I had the materials (because crafting new piece was less costly than repairing it), or use any piece of armor that I looted, or even didn't use any armor at all. And then white   
---
knight, which costs me a good deal of points that I would like to invest somewhere else, was a breath of air.
---
If, after investing so much effort, I'm essentially reduced to going back to the constant grind of repairing pieces of armor every so often, it's only another sign they didn't think about character progression in their game: at high level, such menial things as survival (which may be fun at the start, but grow old on you very fast) should be replaced by other priorities for your character. But they have nothing to offer for their player out of a constant, repetitive, and boring survival grind (which is aggravated by the fact you have to play the stash and inventory space game).
---
H1Z1's best phase was it's early phase.  I really enjoyed it despite the bugs.
---
It only went downhill from there.
---
I had fun for 6 months, and then quit due to lack of new content.
---
It took everyone else another 6 months to figure out they didn't care.
---
Then you see the numbers drop off like a lead weight hit them:  [https://steamcharts.com/app/295110](https://steamcharts.com/app/295110)
---
That’s a good point, TSE’s high damage allowed you to be more creative with your perk cards since you don’t have to tech into straight damage increase cards.
---
I built to be a tse shotgunner. I have zero melee build and my sledge does 50 less damage then my shotgun with level 3 demo and all 3 levels of shotgun 3 star. It’s insane at this point. If I do ever decide I guess I’ll be melee building 
---
So would I.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** Trickay1stAve! ^(hug)
---
Trying to lie to make yourself look better huh? Also weak.
---
No, to put it bluntly this is a stupid solution.
---
What happens to all the current monsters if you increased all player damage by 600%? They either become trivially easy or even more work is required to adjust every monster to have 6x the health.
---
What about future content? Do you let everyone steamroll it on day 1 or make it suddenly much more difficult than the rest of the game leading up to it.
---
No, just no. A pinpoint "nerf" to the specific combination of legendary affixes that we way too strong is both more efficient and healthier for the game.
---
Damn. If only Bethesda would've warned us about a two shot and explosive nerf they had planned.
---
Oh wait. They did.
---
Nice
---
Does that mean there will be less people at whitesprings?
---
The reason this was the final straw for me is bc we’re still not even close to where we should have been on day one of release and it’s been almost three months. Throw in everything else on top of that and it gets old/boring real quick. At some point you can’t keep denying it. This game didn’t even make the top 20 of 2018 so even if they only lost 10 players that’s still gonna hurt since their wasn’t that many players to begin with.. Releasing this game was the worst business move BGS has made in quite a while. They’ve already lost so much money on this game and have to continue to lose even more.
---
Yeah I’m in the cycle right now. Load in. Try not to press any buttons in case it freezes. Get attacked. Try to use weapon. Freeze. Restart game. 
---
Gross. Just gross. 
---
Did you have rad worms? It seem the disease boosts ALL effects
---
Solid tip thanks gamer
---
There ya go! Enjoy lad
---
Underappreciated comment.
---
Oh yeah I did have to repair my weapon so ran into the bulk problem. The bobby pins too. Checked out the plans too, yeah pricey. Eagle Eye Serum is 25k without trader ha. They gutted explosive weapons, hopefully this is to tweak the nerfs like how they're removing energy explosives but didn't seem like it. Cap stashes only give one cap? Whoa
---
I have absolutely no clue how some people can have 400, 500, 600 + hours invested into a game that's only been out for 2-3 MONTHS.
---
MAG, a old PS3 game I loved absolutely to death. I remember playing it quite a few times every week between 2010 to 2013, in those 3 to 4 YEARS I had only accumulated about 1200 hours.
---
Where is Todd Howard hiding now?
---
That escalated quickly. 
---
Well you usually don't hear that much from Todd but Pete is quite active and in conversation with folks in Twitter usually.
---
I guess they evacuated to the Bethesda Vault until the Fallout clears.
---
Came out less than 24 hours ago. Somehow managed to retract some previous bug fixes, added some REALLY annoying bugs, nerfed (quite extremely) what was the most used playstyle and in effect people have wasted alot of time and caps building their characters, they didn't patch an extremely dangerous and we'll known duping method that causes server crashes but patched another method that wasnt harmful to servers therefore pushing dupers towards a much more detrimental method, capped weight to a max of 1500 so alot of people roleplaying vendors are upset, already hundreds of Reddit posts of people saying this was the final straw and they are leaving the game (including major community leaders/vendors).
---
It's a shit storm. Bethesda will actually finally need to make an effort if they want to come back from this.
---
Every patch I've seen fixes a few things and nerfs a bunch of things the game had fun going for it. The only end game that existed were nukes and the Scorched Beast Queen. All I've seen added to nukes was a nerf to exp given by glowing ones (how dare the end game enemy content give the most exp) and the Scorched Beast Queen has a dev post saying they are looking into what loot it should drop (???). 
---
I don't think Bethesda understands how their own loot even works. It always seemed to be me that enemies had a lot of hit points, because if you invested into melee or got your first two shot legendary things would died at an acceptable rate. Now that Two Shot and Explosive has been nerfed, it's just clear to me that wasn't intended either? What is the point of the end game if you don't have a powerful weapon you want to seek? And as I mentioned, melee is super powerful, does Bethesda not realize this either? Am I going to read another patch in the future nerfing everything melee too then? 
---
I think it's the George Lucas affect, Bethesda actually made something amazing but when they went back to fix it... they clearly had no idea what made it fun to begin with. 
---
This along with for some reason everything is heavier now. Even tho I don’t use any of the nerfed perk cards.
---
I've not encountered it, but someone was saying that radworms, which they fixed to cause the appropriate amount of increased radiation damage by 50 percent, was boosting mutations by that amount.
---
Just give up and move along... You have no support here.
---
Will do! 
---
There’s a lot of OP stuff still available. I expect the next crackdown will be a cap or adjustment on the assassin/sentinel combo’s effects (which is actually needed in regards to PvP) and a nerf to melee. 
---
Not sure if you still can but try throwing on a Hazmat Suit and walking into and out of the zone as quickly as possible, sometimes the game will glitch out and you'll no longer take rad damage until you either fast travel or die. Very helpful for fighting stuff like the Queen without Power Armor, especially if you have Unyielding pieces as you'll then be able to boost your STR up to 30-34 potentially.
---
/u/ladydevann make a testing branch and put me and this lad in charge of it 
---
You're level 50, statwise. You just have more perk cards to build with. Have you not figured this out? 
---
PiCk uP 10 bOttLEs At THe sHoOTiNg raNgE.
---
Two of my least fav issues were addressed. I'm satisfied. FOV clipping near walls, VATS flickering. Now if they'd just fix staying in zoom when reloading.. I should be able to let of the left trigger to get out of zoom at any point. 
---
LOL. why would they put actions and movements on a corpse. It was standing with an underwear moving 
---
That is not a sub that I’m aware of. Can you link it? 
---
Yeah they broke their game on this release. Fixed a few things and broke everything else 
---
A WITCH!
---
Someone suggested a tweak to the servers, that any multiples of a certain value (ie: duped TSE shotguns and the like) all be converted to Dross, the useless shit you gotta throw through tires at Camdem park. Literally useless trash.
---
I could imagine walking past paper bags with ~1200lb of Dross, and I'll think "heh, silly dupers"
---
Excavator Calibrated shock plans are 6000 caps, and I got it from Camden park.
---
Join ussssss lol But fwiw, I'm testing with a .50 Cal. 
---
He's done with server disconnects and is walking back to Boston.
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.  TSE weapons are STILL among the best legendaries in the game, stop calling them garbage just because you're so salty that you can't one shot shit any more.  GARBAGE is a legendary weapon that does an extra 30% damage to mirelurks.  Two Shot may only do an extra 25% now but it does it to EVERY FUCKING ENEMY and against a single target Explosive is still adding in another 20%.  NOT FUCKING GARBAGE.
---
Exactly. Spawn in, wait and don’t touch anything but get killed, stupid 
---
Fuck pvp
---
I kind of expected that because on my way to Flatwoods, I cleared out a few locations  and they don’t really have that much lore/story telling to offer (Which is still fine). Let’s say I was surprised how detailed Flatwoods is. 
---
It's only going to get worse
---
If you have the right perks you should be good, you just gotta fine a way to adapt or wait for Bethesda if it’s that bad to roll a new perk or add to blocker  
---
Lol what ya play on? Pc Xbox?
---
You edited a grammatical error immediately and then pretended you didn't. I don't need support against you, you know what you are. 
---
That still wouldn't explain why the guy just seemed unkillable, health depleting to a sliver and just constantly refilling. Especially if your firing back with an extremely powerful weapon, at the most you might see a chunk of their health come back and than instantly vanish again with the next shot, but you wouldn't have to deal enough damage to kill them multiple times over.
---
LOL glad I kept scrolling
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I hope not.
---
Super duper mutants.
---
Oh no I promise thee, all you must do is dupe your hours played young one. Very simple task if you are willing to tangle with the devil.
---
Perk Loadout Manager at the Nexus.
---
Well that just gave me a positive energy boost for the rest of the day... :D
---
if you want the heroic experience, check the map for level 100+ people and fast travel behind them. easy way to level up if you have any kind of decent gear 
---
I honestly haven't hit any game breaking bugs before in 76, so despite the other issues with bugs I still enjoyed it.
---
After the game patched tonight when I turned my computer on, I can load into the menu OK, but as soon as the countdown for server found ends and it should start loading into game, boom! CTD.
---
So now I can't play the game at all. Well played Bethesda. Guess it's a good thing another Anthem demo is this weekend and I'll get to play The Division 2 next week.
---
I'm someone talking to a guy with no argument amd false accusations. Lol.
---
Yep. I wish I didn’t have to live in power armour. Carrying two rifles, armour and some aid, I don’t have much room left. Excavator PA it is... 
---
Maybe for another Single Player title.
---
Not doing another spin on this Multiplayer ride.
---
They either figure out how to do "some" content and "some" bug fixes in the same patch.......or they can be happy turning out multiplayer titles I won't even bother looking at.
---
opposite, my jump  just stops working like i dont have the mutation. reboot to fix it.
---
Yeap. Have to scrap it down again to use in crafting stations.
---
Had it happen before. Items were supposed to sell at 2c each, showed 2c each. Actually sold for 1c each. 
---
Pfffff people who defend this games balance are straight out of their minds.  There is NO balance in this game.  Move along troll
---
And?
---
&gt; Again I'll explain it to you. I am leaving this game, for the forseeable future. 
---
That's fine. Stay, go it's all good.
---
Why do you feel the need to:
---
a. announce that you're leaving?
---
b. ask others for their reason for leaving after this patch too?
---
You can already see that people are leaving. They made posts as such. Not all of them needed to know if others left and why.
---
Let's not pretend you're being magnanimous about giving Bethesda feedback to improve the game. You're basically saying "Screw this, I'm leaving. Whose with me?".
---
&gt; That doesn't mean it wasn't my decision to leave the game.
---
Did your parents make you leave the game? A sibling? Your partner? If not, you're entirely responsible for the decision to leave. At least own it.
---
Don't worry, they're next. 
---
I mean he's the head of PR at Bethesda. Isn't this literally his job?
---
It's like he knows this is a joke fest and is staying as far away as possible.
---
i honestly wish they would have just made another DLC for Fallout 4 that allowed Co op. Or better yet, make a Fallout game with a REAL story that has co op for up to 4 or 6 players. Dying light did this soooo perfectly that i cannot even express my love for that game enough. 
---
Basically the story was all single player but you could have 3 other friends join in to help you and also progress their story at the same time. it didn’t affect any missions or quests because in the story of the game, there was only one player, but there were also co op events and challenges that you could take place in to compete with friends. 
---
Looks like Mars Attacks
---
Enjoy your time on r/quityourbullshit
---
You must be new here. You should search for "mule" and maybe you'll learn that what you said was very wrong.
---
What the hell was the point of this?
---
First paragraph speaks for me.
---
I sometimes think the game might use fractions of caps in certain circumstances like this. Then I think that would be crazy. Then I remember what I'm playing.
---
Lol. K
---
Left the game in beginning of December. Have no regrets. I keep looking here for good news. Until I find the news I'm looking for, I'm staying away from fo76. 
---
Sure. How much do mules haul?   
---
I’ve been playing this game for 6-8 hours a day for the past 3 months. After today’s patch I logged off after an hour. Take that however you’d like. 
---
I had that happen on the first one I tried to loot after the patch but every one after that has been fine.
---
You may need to unequip and reequip the card.
---
I would take it if I'm not too late to reply
---
Same
---
I got that all the time with Home Defense.
---
This has been said many times here pre-patch and the devs still continued with it. Do they even listen?
---
Get bent.
---
Anyone else notice that the weight of Bobby Pins went back up to 0.1 Didnt see anything about them going back up in the patch notes. 
---
It's probably better to go with a friend or two just for protection at being disconnected during the run.
---
Ark, H1Z1, Rust............the list goes on.  Developers that pushed content early.
---
H1Z1 f'd it up and went the "we want to focus 100% on bug fixes" route they're taking now.  It's DEAD, GONE.
---
Ark and Rust are still thriving communities YEARS after their games are fully released and out of alpha / beta.  Why? CONTENT.
---
All of them are SMALLER development teams (even some indies) with nowhere near the budget or AAA talent Bethesda has.
---
It could, but that requires competent programmers that care. Today's patch is proof those are in short supply at Bethesda.
---
Like a lot of players think I am too taking a break. Build is armour based with most perks stacked towards strength and perception. Been here since launch and late on, had to rebalance my stats and perks to where I wanted them. Have my look, armour, outfits, PA's and weapons (included 3 TSE). I have grinded and server hopped for exactly what I wanted. Have no outstanding quests except for the wendigo in the cave. The nerf to my Gauss (my Joe pineapples like sniper rifle) has bothered me a little, but with 2x sneak for my rifles, and a hard hitting All Rise and Grogneks Axe I can still melee with the best of them. Just with a lot of things in this patch with traders, white knight and TSE nerf it's effected my build, and with a silly back catalogue of about 50 games spread over PC, XBox and PS4. I think I'll sit out for awhile work through some of them, and see how 76 goes after a few more patches and content drops. I paid £32 on launch from CD-Keys so have had my monies worth anyway. Enjoyed my time and hopefully it will be a lot better game on my return.
---
I legitimately feel so sorry for the community outreach team members. That has got to be a pretty rough job. 
---
Lol ok you do that.
---
I am not quitting. Just taking a long break. I’ll come back when the first real DLC comes out (not that PvP mode). Although if the game is still in a shit state. I’ll drag it on longer.
---
The serum recipies are on the vendor...
---
Happening to me too. Seems to only happen when in power armor though. Wearing excavator. Haven't had it happen if I remove the armor before fast travel.
---
Way more than the bullshit limit Bethesda added. 
---
Na. Here's the thing about reddit, we lie and use hyperbole to make mountains out of mole hills.
---
I've been playing the last 2 hours and as usual what i read here isn't what i experience.
---
i myself haven't played since the first few weeks to see if bug will be fixed, so i guess I'll give it some more time sadly
---
TL/DR translation: arm chair devs. &gt;This game is as good as dead. 
---
lol (◔_◔)
---
The people giving this gold, silver and plat are the people who were duping.
---
As a person that like the look of raider power armour I do wish they would bring out a skin for that. 
---
2 step forward, 3 step back, step on pile of shit, slip on said pile of shit, falls face first in pile of more shit.
---
&gt;Now we will have weapons that can't kill Queens and SBs
---
really? i still solo scorch beasts with zero effort, with a completely normal non-legendary weapon.
---
i read through a lot of these comments and feel with the people here, but it's comments like these that serve as a stark reminder of just how... dramatic and hyperbolic people are.
---
last time i was at the prime nuke site, the queen was killed before i could even hit her! granted, i didn't arrive before after the nuke had just hit, but still.
---
i was feeling a lot of frustrations building up at the many points people mention here, toward the game state and toward bethesda, but this comment reminded me that people are super overworking every point they make. case in point: "this bobby pin bug, now i have to free up 30 more points of carry!", like dude, just throw some bobby pins away? it sucks, but it's not the bug per se that's horrible, it's the fact that they roll-backed an already existing fix!
---
dunno, i don't think a lot of people are in any position to talk about balance fixes. i think reddit should focus on the real discussion - like end-game, more content, and such - because there are huge possibilities in fallout 76 that just lie completely unused.
---
Easy answer to that dossent take 40 paragraphs.
---
There servers are shit. And the leadership dossent need a change the game does 
---
Don't you see where this is going? Selling items in atomic shop ain't enough to fill their greedy pockets, you will probably be able to buy caps using atoms soon.
---
Maybe all perk cards are active now whether equipped or not
---
Not to mention all the ppl who duped and have 500k+ nuka colas on a mule. They now have an advantage.  They just bought every plan in the game without having to hunt for them.  Meanwhile the average player will find grinding 5k+ caps for a single fucking plan overwhelming.
---
All we know is that the PvP update is penciled in for March. Here's hoping they don't wait that long.
---
No, what was weird is the server hopping meta non-gameplay. Playing a game to save up to buy things is perfectly normal. 
---
Downvoted out of principle. Qualify it however you want, this post is entitles as hell.
---
Its not even about the money, its the principle of how a company should conduct themselves to their customers. They asked us to report bugs and we did, they cant fix those bugs and now we have paid $60 or $30 for an unfinished game but i guess thats our fault right? i assume we shouldve just known “buyer beware” that its perfectly acceptable for companies to do this?  The second you bought the game you already helped support the team, you were under the assumption you were getting a full game am i right? If the game doesnt work due to glitches or bugs or plays out in ways that is not intended by the player or developer does that not constitute paying for an unfinished game?  I just want to see the game finished, i want to see players playing and enjoying the game for what it shouldve been as opposed to what they have to go through to get the full value of the money they already spent, to ignore the fact that its okay for bethesda to just sell us this game without it being finished in a timely manner only sets a standard for all game developers that they can get away with taking your money to sell you an unfinished game. They naturally wont be seeing more money from players overtime in this game because their business ethics, marketing, and leadership is so piss poor people will move on to another company that is doing better.  If they had finished this game theyd see more sales in atomic shop and we would be seeing them releasing new content instead of fixing their blatant mistakes.

I tested with PA without PA, with the card equipped or not when spawning into an area, etc. With no PA and the card equipped some stashes have 1 cap in them, some don't have the search option. I return to it and the search option is there. And not only that, they are then empty if you change server. So all in all it is a big nerf and is completely unnecessary. Just making the game less fun and making people fast travel around the map to 7 vendors every day to sell an arbitrary 200 caps worth of stuff to, whether it's purified water, or costumes, or bulk junk, or whatever. You will play exactly how they dictate you will play. You may not find your own fun ways to do things that you enjoy most. That you have fun doing. NO! No fun allowed!
---
I play 40k games, I'm not picky. 
---
If you ever worked in a gaming company you would realize that people who gets promoted are usually someone's cousin or mistress therefore it's very hard to expect a role change when there is no other role of the same level available in the company.
---
I'm considering it. I've been playing less and less and dived in to see how this patch did. Performance was worse than pre-patch and then I see all the weird "balance" changes they did and it honestly feels like regression big time. I'm patient but even that has limits.
---
Same here. With the right inventory managment itd not hard. Im around 500/600 space for a few weeks now.
---
Still i dislike having to throw away all my unneeded ammo. 
---
Play a different game.
---
Test server, you kiddin'? These people probably don't even have backup files. 
---
Anymore..
---
Unexpected chuckle from the bottom of the comments, have an upvote :)
---
Lol, I’ve seen plenty of people around here that agree with this individual’s complaints. Wether or not those people would go so far as to hire a lawyer is another matter. The best thing he can do is work with customer support to get his skins or just wash his hands of the whole thing and never do business with this company again.

Im half asleep at the moment but these are just a few things I'd like to see.
---
Not yet. I would say someone should compile them and verify them, but since they are old bugs we can assume Bethesda knows about them and not need to be re-informed. Then again, it's Bethesda.
---
I agree
---
I’m done 
---
This whole thread is hilarious to me. A bunch of self entitled whiners who think they know more about making video games than everyone. 
---

Melee sucks late game too, scorchbeats are a pain in the ass to kill (until they land), most top tier gun legendaries will out dps too tier melee and you  take way more damage from the queen
---
Can you still wear armor under this costume?
---
Seem to see nothing but complaints in this sub.
---
Im sorry but right now the game already is and has been the joke of the community and it just keeps getting worse each time a new nerf/bug/or predatory cash grab discussion pops up. 
---
At the moment its hard to choose between Fallout 76, SW Battlefront 2, or Mass Effect Andromeda as the joke meme of this gaming generation.
---
Like I said, if true, it makes some sense.
---
The thing I'm genuinely curious about is whether it's decent staff hampered with terrible management, a studio that was asked/forced to do something that was well beyond their capacity or the whole studio from top the bottom are incompetent.
---
The most tragic thing for me is that there are little glimmers of brilliance that get lost in the mess. Like I love the more darker grounded take the story has, particularly with some accounts of post-war survival. I'd love to see that carry over to future titles, not just in the Fallout universe.
---
I wont even read your post. I have come here to say the only response I ever get from this subreddit. 
---
You are wrong, this game is perfect, there is nothing wrong with the game, the problem is you, the game is fine, shut up and take your down votes, fallout 76 is the best game ever made.
---
P.S. Fallout 76 is perfect.
---
Looks like a lot of people don't realize that there are three different Studios working for Bethesda, and this specific Studio hasn't even been working for them a for a full year. 
---
Be careful, revealing their plan could get you killed. Or worse. It's entirely true though. The evidence is right there. Too bad too many people here seem to still think Bethesda's shit still doesn't stink.
---
Nailed it.
---
&gt;They lose it over everything. They’re very excitable. I can’t really take this sub seriously most of the time.
---
bingo. every point presented here is presented in the worst hyperbolic way just to bring across a point. when hyperbole becomes a lie it ceases to serve any purpose.
---
it's quite obviously just people who are waiting for something to be riled up against. it's this way every patch. yes, there are a lot of valid concerns, but they are rarely mentioned or phrased in a way that shows the speaker understands the concern (or rarely mentioned at all).
---
Class freak still doesn't affect some perks such as grounded, it'll show 12 percent energy damage reduction but it still reduces it by the max amount... 
---
You describe it like everyone can get 1400/day. But if I take that faction’s 200 caps no one else can for that 24 hour period. 
---
with the rate of inflation your 10k caps saved up will be worth a couple dollaridoos. hope you like the digeridoo instrument varients in the atom shop too
---
Anyone else notice that the weight of Bobby Pins went back up to 0.1 Didnt see anything about them going back up in the patch notes.
---
Further evidence (beside bobby pin weight) that they just rolled back to a previous patch in that my powered doors no longer work. Interacting with the button doesn't open a menu, just like before the fix. I would love to say "this is getting ridiculous" but it started out that way; now it's just getting sad.
---
It’s not like you’re going to find anything useful at all in a safe.
---
Not just that. The bricks plans used to be 400 now they’re 1200
---
Friends
---
I’m sorry your attention span doesn’t last the span on not even one page of any book or web article you read online. Most weren’t even full paragraphs. 
---
The leadership causes change in a game, it doesn’t just magically happen. If current leadership does not fix things properly, especially under a billion dollar company, they need to be replaced. 
---
Funnily enough - all they need to do is push out Update.ESM along with an Update.BS2.  Then you just need to push out the changes alone to those files and, with it lower in your load order, they will override FO76.esm/.bs2.  Then you don't have to download everything each time nor have to worry about their patcher screwing something up when it opens, modifies, and re-compresses the archive.
---
There is, literally, no reason to directly patch the original plugins or their archives.  In fact, its actually better if they never touch those and use a single Update plugin in the load order.
---
And a lot of these bugs are in the .exe - and everyone else has the ability to patch their executables without issue.  You could save texture, mesh, location bugs for a larger weekly update while pushing code bugsfixes out daily.
---
&gt;I can't kill anything at the moment
---
noob, i can kill stuff with pipe weapons
---
What gamebreaking bug? Clickbait?
---
Hey Mistah Blue, thank you for the suggestion mate. Which weapons do you believe need a buff? I've seen a few people mentioning certain energy weapons but it would be good to get your thoughts
---
Too bad that vendor quit his job over the patch bullshit. I can't think of any reason he would be gone. Unless.....did Bethesda add a new bug? Say it isn't so!
---
either I have way too much bulked and way, way too much scrap but I didn't notice this bug at all today on Xbone. I crafted then immediately scrapped 11 (14 with super duper!) handmade rifles for the mod plans without issue 
---
I honestly can't think of a worse time to come back, to be honest.
---
It’s nice not having a post removed if you say anything other than positive things about the game. 
---
Dear BGS,
---
I am now unable to play this game now after your current patch. I can get to the main menu just fine, but once I hit play game, it finds a server, counts down from 3, and right as it is supposed to start loading me in it crashes to desktop.
---
So I am unable to play the game I paid $80 to play. You win this last time, but no more will I buy any of your games until you can actually prove to me that your code is better than a wet paper bag.
---
If you like inconsequential bug fixes while adding more bugs, a big nerf to the White Knight card you like, and minor QOL fixes like Known Plans where the modders already did a better job with their MOD than the developers did as a FEATURE.......jump back on in.
---
If not, just stay away :)

You tell me.
---
I did get to play a bit more and the health of enemies seems to vary wildly.  I was in Harper's Ferry and the mutants must have all been mainlining med-x because they were 3-5 shots minimum, even with scoped headshots.
---
I went to the red rocket just south of Harper's and the ghouls there were one shot to the head.  Gutsies at 98 NAR were bullet sponges, at least 8-9 hits each.  A lvl 21 mole rat needed two hits with a 2-shot handmade.  I understand that enemies are scaled up in health with nearby players around, but two hits to take out a lvl 21 molerat with a lvl 45 2-shot handmade?  That's ridiculous.  Without any melee perks, I pulled out my fire axe (mutant's +10 damage bonus/+50 limb/90% reduced weight) and took out another one in one swing.  That means an unperked fire axe is outperforming my rifle with maxed damage perks.
---
You constructed a laundry list day of patch for what?
---
Some kinda justification? Is me knowing all this bullshit you typed suppose to make me feel some sort of way that they failed beyond all imagination on almost every level possibly imaginable?
---
Foh.
---
It’s not about skins.  It’s about how the company has scammed it’s customers by selling a broken game.  Class action lawsuits are brought by attorneys on behalf of all the plaintiffs (those of us who bought the game) for the purposes of bringing some measure of compensation on behalf of those whose losses aren’t high enough to warrant an individual suit.  And also therefor as a punitive measure against a defendant to help stop further abuse.
---
Not only this, they need to remedy the situation FAST. They are hemorrhaging users quickly, and it's hard to regain a burned customer. The damage to Bethesda's reputation alone is worth the expense, but I'm not sure Bethesda cares.
---
I WANT A PUBLIC APOLOGY FROM TODD HOWARD!
---
IT manager here and former QA tester for a AAA game publisher.
---
Even for a huge gaming company unforeseen shit happens when you roll out new game versions. Patch one thing, another breaks. This is even harder for an massively multiplayer online game. Some stuff you can't even test until it goes live with 1000s of players pounding the servers.
---
Never seen a more relevant username.
---
Is this any surprise tho? When it came out I remember how many people were starry eyed saying they can't wait for Bethesda to fix this and that. I even got called a pessimist or a hate drone for saying that I wouldn't hold my hopes up about that.
---
I mean, lets level here. Did everyone forget about bethesda's previous games? This company is notorious not only for bugs but also for leaving their games to hang after release. Their post-launch behavior with their games has always been awful.
---
So yeah, not at all surprised that they are being less than competent about patches and so on.
---
The reason the servers are shit (and the game is shit) is because management made a bunch of piss-poor decisions. Thus, the root of the problem is their leadership.
---
Yesterday this sub was all about dismissing those who were calling for the same thing OP is calling for and calling them haters and hypers. Now after this patch you see a tidal change. Goodwill is not something you should have squandered Bethesda, but oh well. 
---
&gt; It has the potential to be AMAZING. 
---
had\*
---
FTFY
---
Oof. My advice is to give it a little more time. This is not the best of times to re-enter the fray.
---
I'm even going to take a small break for this game until the dust from the most recent patch settles.
---
However, to answer your question, there isn't really much to say about major changes. A lot of bugs are fixed but some old ones are still around, along with new ones introduced.
---
The biggest change is quality of life features like unlocking framerate to physics (you can go above 60 fps if your system can handle it), push to talk for the mic and a few other major ones similar to that.
---
Otherwise it's much the same. No new content to speak of and anything new won't come until at least March, if not later.
---
Stash size increased to 600. They just heavily nerfed guns by lowering the two best legendary effects (explosive and twoshot). Melee is still extremely strong. They have been adding server stability and I would say it’s much better than at launch, but crashes still occur occasionally. 
---
This patch is killing me. I have loved this game so much even with its problems. But today just shocked me.
---
NOTHING added to the game that is new and fun. They simply nerf'd the living shit out of everything.  My Guns now do 1/3 the game, ok I can live that and I expected it...but the nerf to the perk cards was a kick in the teeth.
---
The KNOWN QoL feature is bugged and unreliable, the bobby pin fix was reversed.  Everything that was a real pain in the game was made worse.
---
I honestly find myself not knowing what really to do....I sell stuff and make 1400 caps, which can buy me 1 or 2 plans that I dont Really need.  My Stash is full so cannot collect anything....most quest are done. My UW monitor is worse this patch and the PA Hud is still crap.
---
The SBQ hunt is just not worth it anymore. We have a very good chance of not killing her d/t the DPS nerf so if we do succeed it will likely be a long drawn out battle and I will use up 5x the Ammo I would have used pre-patch. My few Stable fluxs we get from her does not cover the cost to make that much ammo. She also drops nothing most people need.
---
TOO MUCH effort not enough reward to bother with her anymore IMHO.  
---
At this point part of me wants to reload Fo4 with mods, port my Main into it and play. 
---
Today is the day that FUN died in Fo76 and that hurts.
---
Working as intended.
---
Edit: It’s a feature 
---
If you hang around whitesprings enough it’s bound to happen eventually. Nice little fun to stick it to the trolls 😂
---
I would actually love to be in the room when you try and pitch this idea to a lawyer.
---
Serum recipes have -always- cost 22,000 base.  You just rarely saw them.  With Hard Bargain and a few points into CHA, you can get this down to like 19,800 or so.
---
any time I was in a pinch save for maybe twice in the absolute boonies of the map, there was always someone with some kind of TSE weapon nearby. even last night, one saved me during a solo "One Violent Night" run with the ghoul overload. today I fought a beast with someone who was using one and he wasn't doing much damage than I was with my lvl 50 combat shotgun perk'd with all the perk cards 
---
The problem is they'll fix that and break something else.
---
They need to chill out on the bug fixes and make sure when they FIX one thing it doesn't break something else.
---
Not 100+ changes in a single patch and the rest of the game goes haywire.
---
Also no new content doesn't help.  I can deal with bugs.  My friends all leaving the game sucks worse than any bug they introduced.
---
I think the button is just an on/off light indicator.  When the shower is on, the "button" lights up.  You need to tie it to a switch or pressure plate to be able to turn it off.  Otherwise it just stays on constantly.
---
I believe it more has to do with a company not familiar with working with the creation engine, but also tasked with implementing online that causes a mess of instability issues in itself. So maybe not inexperienced in game making, but inexperience with how Bethesda wanted it with their engine, and also a lack of leadership.

Lol I’m genuinely curious, what did you say that got you banned from r/fallout?
---
Only really bad experience I’ve had with one of these was a bobble duper wearing a full assassin/sentinel set.  Opened up on him with a TSE mini-gun (pre-patch) and could barely make a dent. He fired one shot and killed me and in the process broke both of my PA legs and both arms. While dead I hear a second shot that also breaks my torso. 
---
BGS has been totally useless with the support ticket. Submitted the video twice, once on their website and once through email. Now they just want a YT link because their email servers couldn’t handle the file (which was only ~20MB). 
---
Because if they let mods in right now they arent gonna be able to sell their overpriced trinkets and cosmetics that mods are CERTAINLY gonna make for free.
---
They are going to milk the atom store for a while until they allow mods to touch this game properly.
---
To be honest... I think the whole game should be retracted and be given another year of development time under new producers and directors. 
---
This game is a sad mess and I’m just disappointed. 
---
Why the fuck would they remove Rad-X stacking?? Who was asking for this! You need to stack in nuke zones. Rad-X is useless to carry now.
---
New bug fixes break old bug fixes all the time in software development. Calm the fuck down. 
---
Hey CallMeDrago! Thanks for your feedback buddy. Another thread had suggested something similar (it was titled "Bethesda, when you make huge changes in the way perks work...you really ought to offer a complimentary complete respec."
---
Is this also what you had in mind? If so, I know that this feedback has indeed been passed onto the dev team - but I just want to make sure those in this thread were asking for something similar.  
---
I'm honestly thinking they're removing the Bright and Red Tactical headlamps from MODUS, renaming them "Mothman" something-or-other, and charging IRL money for it, and they let the code slip early. 
---
Its hard to believe that a studio that was set up specifically for MP games, is full of people who make MP games, in a location where there are lot's of studios that make MP games, had already made half an MP game itself (before being restructured and assigned FO76) somehow doesn't know this most basic thing about community management when you make radical changes to how character attributes work.
---
I'm beginning to see why BattleCry got cancelled.
---
It is a bug that benefits the player!!!!
---
Hotfix in 24 hrs!!! I guarantee it!!
---
Omg the horror.
---
Yah, but the potential is there.
---
If you can’t see the potential or what potentially this game could be from 6-12 months now you’d be cooked.
---
Yeah, they could become like blizzard and get In the practice of completely retiring skills and spec sets. Pruning and squishing things out of their game
---
Became the standard, like the only customer they wanted to have to be new / revolving door similar to uber and its contractors 
---
I have been running around all day with a 1 shot exploding shotgun doing just fine.  I don’t one shot everything in the world anymore, but basically anything weaker the the level 68 super mutants die in a single shot.  Most of the super muts take 2.  its not like the guns are worthless anymore - they just don’t instagib everything on contact.  Also should note i am not built for max damage either.  Not using adrenaline or bloody mess perks.
---
I'll admit I ran with this one as well only because I experienced several of the other reported bugs and the "old game build" seemed pretty plausible. I still have bones to pick with this patch but its just not this one anymore and I'll be more skeptical of everything I read now hopefully.
---
Sorry, but buffing everything to TSE level would have been the most asinine thing BGS could have ever done...lmao.
---
&gt; Not only this, they need to remedy the situation FAST. They are hemorrhaging users quickly, and it's hard to regain a burned customer. 
---
That's very true but at the same time fast can mean sloppy, as we've seen with some of these patches.
---
&gt; The damage to Bethesda's reputation alone is worth the expense, but I'm not sure Bethesda cares. 
---
They might be too much in their own bubble to realise how dire the situation is. They won't really understand until pre-order season for Starfield comes around. No matter how promising the announcement and game footage may look, I think they've already caused damaged to their pre-sales number.
---
I for one will never pre-order a BGS game ever again, or even purchase at launch for that matter.
---
That’s the best thing for you to do I think. The game hasn’t really improved all that much and they are currently testing ways to make it less enjoyable. Fells bad but, se la vie. 
---
&gt;And continuing to charge outrageous prices for mostly lame cosmetics to the few people left that are willing to keep subjecting themselves to the punishment that is the game's development cycle isn't going to keep it afloat...
---
this was really the best part of your message. bethesda legit expect to earn huge amount of money on this game, yet they clearly put in so little effort and resources into it. starting to feel more and more like a scam; i'd absolutely hate being anyone who paid more than 30 bucks for this game.
---
They are also at that vendor a lil north of the Grafton Station vendor.
---
Never going to happen.  It’s all about money and complexity.  All MMOs which this game is a lite version of balance overpowered first.  Because it’s easier to balance outliers for one, and for two if they don’t, players will consume “content” too rapidly and too effectively.  
---
Every online game I’ve ever played has followed the model that you nerf overpowered to par with other tiers, then or simultaneously nerf underpowered to similar tiers. 
---
Waste of breath and time to argue against this design philosophy.  It won’t change. 
---
The damage to their reputation is quite palpable. You can see it in the backlash when they rolled out the 76 leather jacket on Twitter -- Bethesda shot its load and ruined their reputation in the process. Either they start ponying up with serious support, or their reputation keeps tanking and their next few titles are busts.
---
I ran the queen today.  Even more bullet spongey than normal.
---
Got a legendary Nocturnal Wood Leg.  That's right, a one star armor.  Totally worth the broken super sledge and busted up power armor.  I'm going to take that leg and go PVP at night somewhere, I'll kill everyone.
---
And now you can't stack Rad-X...
---
Its the mo of haters on here.
---
Fusion cores generate properly. 
---
Ppl saw Bobby pins and ran with it 
---
That’s rough. Hope you can use this method if you encounter another of these dipshits. 
---
That's a fair point. I could see that too.
---
What is Bethesda gonna have to do for people to stop coddling and defending them at this point?
---
Not unexpected since other patched issues have resurfaced. 
---
It has nothing to do with the patch, so I’m guessing your attention span didn’t even get passed the first couple of paragraphs (there’s only 9 btw). It was summarizing the development of Fallout 76, other than just Bethesda made it, because in essence they did not, another company did that didn’t have the experience to do so. If a game you plays development doesn’t interest you so be it.
---
Yup. My shotgun build is castrated now. It’s bullshit. Melee is the only option and that shit takes no skill. They fucked this game up so bad. 
---
yes thats another one I meant to test but farming 1000 woods drained the willpower from me
---
Everybody did, don't worry. There's not just the hivemind on reddit, man. I'm convinced there is either a troll discord, 4chan raid campaign, or disgruntled youtuber that actively tries to turn the mob onto certain points, there's definitely throwaways made here
---
Yeah, I have healing factor/adrenal reaction/marsupial/bird bones/scaly skin/grounded/herbivore.  I don't run around in power armor as a sniper, so my combat/metal pieces give me about 350ish DR and about the same Energy Resist.  Maybe it's a matter of having less DR than someone in power armor, but I really need to watch out when getting swarmed by ghouls (especially eating that extra rad damage at low health) or taking on a lvl 91 deathclaw, even with blocker and some ranks in evasive, barbarian and ironclad swapped in.
---
Playing destiny every gun I loved got nerfed into the ground don’t do the same 
---
So yeah about that patch! 
---
It's a bit sad that I now have over 400 lb of legendaries from this.
---
They don't want salty people like rust and gta. So far, people are realy nice on pc.
---
I've been playing this game for about 87600 hours now, and I've started to become a bit bored. Nonetheless, I guess I'll just do some side and misc. quests 'till Bethesda adds some more content.
---
Toodoloo.
---
Yes, I can confirm they are, I was just there.
---
My biggest issue is how bad their reporting system is. There’s a way to upload video, but it didn’t work. Was asked to email video. Their server dropped off the video and they want to rely on a third party service for their CS needs. 
---
I’m getting TONS of legendaries, still all trash, still one stars off 3 star enemies. But like I’m getting a ridiculous amount it’s absurd yet we can’t break them down or fast travel holding all of them to vendor. But prices increase...how we supposed to make the caps. It’s like they’re mocking me man
---
Well, at least that’s over now. I just popped over to Watoga and saw them for sale along with a bunch of stuff that had been rare before.  
---
Nice video. I agree it was a good patch
---
Just curious, what platform?
---
Community managers are mouth pieces. They barely know more than the end user and they have little agency to do anything.
---
I'd be surprised if they even could contact anyone rather than just wait to be contacted.
---
A response from a cm might as well be a bot responding. And this isn't just for Fo76 either.
---
Yes. As well as crafting armour guns mods etc, it also screws with events that require thing to be fix, surface to air for example
---
You do also have to repair it four times as often, so you'll need eight times more ballistic fiber than you did pre-patch.
---
In my case that's eight times a very small number, but then I run a ranged build and try to avoid being hit. Unarmed melee builds might be a bit painful.
---
I hate that almost any online game like this is basically a chore simulator. They try so hard to stretch a tiny amount of content to last for so long that they put in artificial time “traps”. 
---
In this game it’s the constant need for materials, shoot a gun for 10 minutes? Well it’s broken and now you need to repair it, same with literally everything else.
---
Other games, it’s the purposefully slow grind for money to buy decent gear, daily missions, or RNG loot tables with a .01% chance at a good piece of loot (not saying 76 doesn’t have these, but the repair mechanic is the #1 time trap in my opinion).
---
They make it slow so you waste time and eventually get mad enough to purchase crap from their stores. Or at least to keep you on long enough to maximize the chance you’ll buy something.
---
I usually hate online games for this reason. I want to have fun playing, not be manipulated into a slow and boring grind just so they can keep their player numbers up.
---
I had one tied to the missile turret, and it would be great if they did anything besides watch me smash radrats destroying the plants they're supposed to protect.  The turret just waves back and forth as if saying no.  The last time it worked was last week, when it went HAM on one of my teammates that picked the razorgrain to eat.
---
Thank you! Now they need to fix old bugs issue
---
covert operative adds ur damage multiplier to 2.5 on sneak attacks. U can rapidly shoot sneak attacks. Furthermore, u could throw in a vats crit build to maximize damage. As long as ur stealth, u can dish out almost the same damage. Or probably get a close feel to it.
---
It takes years and tangible new releases not patches to smooth things over, Destiny has shown that time and time again. But in terms of game development you really have given not enough time (like in the first place) to fix things. Destiny 1 wasn’t more or less fixed until very end of its life cycle. They have been quicker at releasing patches but figuring out more complex and engaging content is easier in concept then it is in application. If you’re expecting any game to truly revolutionize its image within a couple of months, three almost four to be exact, then they better be either being worked as slaves or they are a hive-mind. 
---
It's hard to come up with an easy explanation for why so many apparent old bugs resurfaced (as well as the new ones that I have encountered - not game breaking, but messy). It might be that the current round of changes required recreating that duping fix to some extent, so that part of the older build was overwritten in the merge, but I really don't know.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
Where the little inconsequential bugs get MAXIMUM attention, things that people liked (looking at you White Knight card) get massive NERFS, and QOL fixes like Known Plans work WORSE than what the modders coded in for FREE on NexusMods.
---
BTW They've known about the assaultron heads for at least a month now.  Not sure why they're giving the middle finger to the assaultron users while they chase down bugs less than 1% of the player base has a problem with.....lol
---
Warframe, which is free to play with constant free content...
---
&gt;when people who have the card but never used it use that to their advantage to get a new card they do want?
---
Is there some reason why they shouldn't be able to do this?
---
I killed the queen and died before I looted the queen and before I got my loot for completing the quest to kill the queen. I couldn’t respawn,lost my junk, couldn’t loot queen, and didn’t get my quest loot. I had to leave the server and had no friends in it to rejoin. ;(
---
&gt;I'm sure they rushed it out because they were worried it wouldn't do well, and weren't willing to sink the resources into it that they would a more "safe" title
---
this is the thing. and bethesda expects to make huge money out of this game anyway. there's only so much a player can take before they start thinking about alternatives.
---
Hope you enjoyed this video!
---
only PA negates fall damage
---
your perk card with an armor piece only maxes out at 90% i believe.
---
Now that regular pve has been nerfed to oblivion expect more of this. 
---
Its dead though. 
---
Bring extra guns, ammo, and weapons.  You're going to use a lot.  Especially if any lower level players are in the zone with you.
---
Yeah, it is ridiculous especially when non-legendary enemies are dropping them.
---
I just tried my lv 45 TSE handmade out for a few hours.
---
I now have to use 2-3 well-placed shots to take down a legendary, instead of a single shot ~10ft away.
---
Seems fine to me.  Still pretty strong actually.
---
Give real life a try. It has its charms.

* **(Added Jan 29) Dev Note:**  Recipe and Plan prices were originally based on the rarity of showing  up in a Vendor’s inventory. Guaranteeing their appearance significantly  increased the availability of most plans and recipes and we’ve increased  their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high  to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others’  equipment for a cheaper price." 
---
THERE IS NO OFFICIAL MARKET. The ONLY way to trade items in this game is through sketchy third party "maybe I'll get my stuff, maybe I'll get murdered by a griefer" side deals, from sub-reddits and forums and shit. Trying to keep a "competitive market" when you haven't PROVIDED any. Literally ANY form of market in any sense of the word is a joke.   
---
"We want XxXdickedyourmumxXx's side business to keep working". FUuuuu. 
---
LOL
---
Fortnite? Oh, we are getting there. That's what PVP servers are for. Can't you see devs spending most of their time on that rather than making new content. Those of us who are staying are going to become guinea pigs for their new e-sports.
---
How does your gear break faster?
---
Lever actions are awesome.  
---
It's to show how badass Madigan was, man. That's where he found the Scorched-killer's mods 
---
i don't see how this video proved anything, am i missing something?
---
Im with you on this. I don’t care for pvp. I Wanna see those queen fights that as it is could take a shit ton a ammo when TSE was OP. Now without it is just not even worth it. The sad part they ruined the only resemblance to an endgame this game had.  More power to the people that like to grind weapons and play in game Walmart but there’s only so many caps to be had and so many things to buy so what’s the point. 
---
You sure old dupes are back?
---
Cores generate properly on ps4 from workshops
---
You need to finish the math on this perk.
---
I heard people talk about the old dupe method, fusion core generator rates, and crashes being back, but have not encountered that myself. I have however encountered the carry weight effects of legendary armor with weight reduction mods being nulled until I relogged, it jumped me from 750 to 1260 with the same perks after a while. Also the damage bug is back, I've had it happen to me like a half hour after the update and a ton of others also said they got it since then
---
It takes time for tangible change to occur, within leadership and to gain new traits and skills and to form a new management team. Considering these things can take months to years and it has been just a little bit past the minimum the continued fuck ups aren’t surprising they are almost to be expected. Do I like them? No. But do I accept them as reality? Yes. At this point it would be better for them to do nothing but they can’t justify nothing to Zenimax’s shareholders so they must continue at least until they either fix it or hit rock bottom. 
---
Hey Rob - I'm going to pass this feedback onto the team so thank you for letting us know. But so I'm not misunderstanding your feedback (just want to be extra sure), is your concern with the 200 caps limit at vendors especially post the latest patch?  
---
Anyone else, feel free to jump in too. The more feedback the better
---
hey it's the primary lesson to learn about how a wow killer never happened but wow made itself into the only wow killer ever to be - squishing and pruning out ALL of the fun and character building the game ever had, except for the smallest of small playstyle type in very high challenge team hardcore content (basically sporting level)
---
Yeah, we hate it.
---
No idea why they nerfed it.
---
Nobody was asking for that nerf.
---
Looks like the person making the balance and nerf decisions doesn't play the game.  I bet it's someone they hired from a competing studio.  What better way to rekt your competition than gimping it from the inside, right?
---
They could do a chem item - FO4 has several mods that add in respec chems - and tie it into a short quest (which they can control when it can be repeated) to get the item.
---
Heck, the quest could simply be a hidden one where, when you start the game, it triggers, completes, and adds the item to your inventory.  Reset it to run again after each perk tree change.
---
I mean, I'm barely even a modder but I seem to have a better understanding of what you can do with Creation than BethesdaAustin does. 
---
My thought as well, but I think a second armor piece would make it 100 and make goat legs obsolete.  I saw one at a vendor today too, kicking myself for not getting it.  
---
Still, it must consider the height of the fall to instantly kill me when I landed with 90% damage reduction.  I'll go back and try with PA tomorrow.
---
Not trying to throw shade, but at level 126 I’ve never received an explosive legendary. Tonight me and 7 others (some of whom definitely had explosive weapons) took the SBQ in 10 minutes. I use a self crafted prime receiver handmade-no effects while in the air and the all rise when she lands. I have max rifleman and two lvl 3 melee cards. I used about 500 rounds of ultra cite ammo. One the SBQ is dead I pick up 40-50 violet flux and replenish my ultracite ammo. 
---
I’ve just been leaving piles for low level players to pick up , it’s ridiculous. Just walk into the whitespring clubhouse and 4/5 enemies are dropping legendaries. 
---
use melee instead, even before the patch i only use melee on her, ill shoot her in the air but its like shooting spitballs
---
That’s pretty cheap. 
---
For this particular issue it is just so *obvious* that the best fix is to stop giving wanted players caps when they kill somebody. He’s wanted. Why should he get 105 caps if the whole objective from the onset was to deter griefing?
---
The damage nerf penalty and even the TSE nerf in the patch are clearly not cutting it in this area. The solution is so simple. So obvious. Yet it goes right over their heads. 
---
I live 30 min from Rockville. Maybe I should “grief” their company parking lot with a couple dozen rotten eggs.

There have been improvements! Just that they shoot themselves in the goddamn foot every time as well

Bahahahah! Okay I'll keep that in mind!
---
Ultra-wide is broken?  i can go in to the Display menu, change the resolution, and then come back and set it back to 21:9 3440x1440.   How is it broken?  I'm missing the bug.
---
I'm so happy I only spent £9.99 to buy this 'game'. I mostly played it during 'beta', snatched it during a massive sale. When I did log in after purchasing, performance was much more rose than before release, so I'm still waiting till they rectify this, but it looks like that will take a few more months of ever :/
---
If anything, this version of Pay-to-Win is a new low for the industry. You don't even keep the advantage.
---
by that logic did you expect every person in fallout lore to have 6 full sets of fully upgraded power armor in their pockets? making something unbalanced and insanely common doesnt work together
---
I absoluteluy agree. This game was more fun in the supposed “beta” than it is now. I CALL DO OVER!
---
The only games I get excited for are fallout and elder scrolls...r.i.p
---
PC for me.
---
Haha perfect so I wont be hurting her
---
that does nothing lol
---
Lol looks like you suck.
---
Why vats without eagle eyes?
---
Community managers are glorified chat mods mate. They have basically nothing to do with the game and are just messengers.
---
Might as well be talking to a bot.
---
It's about to have a similar effect, now that nothing is strong enough to even remotely challenge it.
---
Lol. Man
---
How tho? My melee attacks wont ever hit her when shes on the ground. Cant even try to use vats to hit her 
---
The repairing cost is not the pb, the problem is the unending repetition of having to repair your armor, which is in no way a fun thing to do, so much when you have done it for 50+ levels. It brings no fun, no incentive to play, and having to do that even when you decided to use QoL perks to avoid it is bad decision. 
---
You can, for example, with some food perks such as cannibalism, completely forget about having to manage food consumption, it was perfectly fine to have such a thing for armor.
---
So the way the dupe glitch worked is you crafted 300 boards. Once the boards were in your inventory ex: Boards (307) thats how it had to appear for the glitch to work. By being over 300 identical armor or weapon items in 1 stack it would cause you to disconnect. Items that you stored in a container before disconnecting would still be there but your character would be "reset" to the status it was before crafting the boards and disconnecting. This means you load back in, you still have the items in your inventory and can also grab them from the container. The key is that the 300 boards had to be in a single stack to work. A person could craft 10,000 boards but if they all appeared in stacks of 299, the glitch would not work. 
---
I OFFICIALLY HATE FALLOUT 76 
---
All you guys do is nerf but never buff
---
And what’s up with my two shot explosives? You freaking degraded my tse handmade to a normal modded handmade. Smh
---
The serum only makes it so there's no drawback temporarily.
---
That is what people are doing just racking up legendaries in that area and low level players are taking them. I got a 'two shot The Dragon' from it. It's just crazy. 
---
Dupers and explosive two shotters are gonna downvote you to hell and back but what you say is true; for the balance of the game and to stop real world trading this needed to be done. It's bad when everyone abuses a overpowered build and then gets so used to it being overpowered that they think it is the norm. Jokes on them because all of their builds are now useless and they are all jumping into melee which is next up on chopping block. 
---
Don't think I've ever seen a game from a AAA studio fail this hard.  Wow.  
---
Check out Diablo 3 as well. 
---
From my experience with past nerfs with other games, it's to compensate someone for inconveniencing them or ruining their overall build/deck/whatever. 
---
If it had nothing to do with their build at all, they get an advantage rather than compensation for a disadvantage.
---
I guess it's about perceived relative fairness. If people don't have a problem with that, I guess it's not an issue then.
---
What I'm more saying is that I don't think it's a trivial thing to solve is all.
---
This is my only gripe with the update. Before, I was doing a little more damage than most others with some weapons bc of a legendary problem, at the expense of possibly killing myself. Now, I'm still possibly killing myself, but only doing on par damage. The risk of death isn't worth it imo. Yeah death isn't too much a drag in this game as is, but this makes me rethink my whole build once again. 
---
I totally agree.  This was a really foolish change.  You're making a conscious choice to not benefit from power armor defense, so losing 10-30% durability buff is really significant.  I always assumed that Power Patcher and White Knight were working as intended because of the discrepancy in defense.
---
Didn't the last patch try to ease the burden of continual armor repair?  WTF devs?
---
*took entire lobby*
---
This game is already in maintenance mode, it will just keep getting some polish while the playerbase slowly dies.
---
Tbf the game was beta'd by gamers instead of a real team dedicated to it, so you could guess it wouldn't be perfectly tested. Especially when said gamers learned they'd keep their beta progression at release. 
---
I've been a white soldier of Bethesda in the eyes of many people but this is becoming embarrassing.
---
Too* since you’re correcting everyone’s spelling and grammar. That’s an easy one too, shame on you. Look, I even used it in a sentence for you. 
---
Actually a lot of players have been using the ice box as a way to spread the wealth so good on you for taking it all. You are a real winner bud 
---
I looked on eBay, they're like 5 to 10 bucks. Unless the price dropped after the nerfs? Where they more expensive? Then yeah, that's pretty funny, but I think it's funnier when people spend that amount of money in the atom store for a toybox. 
---
It’s hard playing this game by the rules isn’t it? Try it, like so many of the other honest players do. 
---
Same. My friends got fed up with constant crashes and honestly we kinda ran out of stuff to do. I stopped playing a few weeks ago, will come back once they release some new content instead of patching what should’ve been finished in release.
---
Nope.
---
You're saying it wrong.
---
Are you not *MANAGED*!

---
According to the patch notes, the condition loss reduction with three levels of White Knight was nerfed from 90% to 60%. Hence four times faster condition loss.
---
I wasn’t expecting my comment to get to developers. It was just an empty rant really (more frustration because I’m an IT manager myself and handle large dev teams so i have a fairly good idea why these things happen, though not exactly why it happened at bethesda)
---
from what i understand the dupe method that crashes the server wasn't ever fixed. it was a different one.
---
You're an idiot if you agree'd ;)
---
I run 3440x1440 and it looks fine to me. The text is a little different, but it doesn’t look broken.
---
Pretty much all heavy weapons besides the Gatling Gun, which itself has bugged sights still...
---
Minigun does pitiful damage and breaks in about 3 reloads even with Gunsmith 5. 
---
LMG I have never personally used, but hear its worse than Minigun since it uses .308 ammo. 
---
50 Cal only needs a slight buff in damage, more weapon mods for it would be great as well (sights/recievers/ect).
---
Flamer, well Ive only used this for about 1 minute...and it used ALL of the ammo I had stockpiled from level 1-~70, so I think thats self explanatory
---
Cryolator I have never really used but hear it has same ammo issues as LMG and Flamer.
---
From the patch notes:  
---
 The condition loss bonuses provided by each rank of the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks have been reduced from 30%/60%/90% to 20%/40%/60%   
---
I'm not sure how going from 90% to 60% is 4x, but then again math was never my strong suit ;)
---
Basically, I think we've stumbled on a plan to remove the X-01 headlamps and charge us IRL money for them instead.
---
Was it in the ash heap?
---
i attack the legs and butt, lots of times you dont get any splash of blood or a hit marker but you should still be doing damage unless the server lag is really bad. i dont vats in melee.
---
No by flat woods
---
they are garbage,sbq takes 3 times more ultracite bullets
---
pls ,everything takes more ammo to kill now 3 times more ammo it is garbage
---
I've seen two accounts on here so far - one where it's was pretty much the same with just a little more effort and a 13 person team that failed to take the queen down. Might be too early to say.
---
Energy weapons, heavy weapons, 'exotic' weapons. Every other secondary legendary effect to bring it in line with explosive (still 100% better than the others - it really should be a primary effect). 
---
Yeah this game is now dead.  We got conned... won't reinstall it unless they somehow bring it back to life which I doubt
---
r/market76
---
yes the dupe method that supposedly crashed the server hasn't been addressed as far as I know (if its real). The modus method was fixed, and the method that crashed the game for you client side was fixed. The latter is the method I'm referring to in the post.
---
Whatever version of pvp in this game isn’t the problem.
---
Lol sure, I'm not the one who passed up a grand for a dumbass 3*** in game item that will be outdated after the first set of expansions release
---
Ah that makes sense. And no problem, I feel like people get way too hot headed on this sub sometimes haha. Sorry I musta misread that as you *only* wear PA (sleep deprivation is a bitch).
---
But yeah I get your point, especially with the Sentinel factor of standing still. Might I suggest trying out high sneak and escape artist? Could help you avoid some of that damage, though I'm not entirely certain cause the mobs in SBQ fight seem to know where you are no matter what.
---
In any case, thanks for your civility as well. Take it easy!
---
Yeah my lvl 144 friend whose been playing with me for a while quit today, uninstalled and all. He’ll prob be back once some content drops though. 
---
Apparently wasn’t theirs 
---
POE respecs everyone at every change of the perk tree.  Its not an advantage even though if the respec didn't change you, you can change your perk assignments for free.
---
Pretty much every game respecs for free everyone in these situations - its not fair to offer no respec, its simply too much work to figure out who 'deserves' one, and there's no real advantage to anyone for getting an 'underserved' one.
---
It’s the bomb probably ?
---
There are several computers. Each only control a couple turrets.
---
Man you guys are terrible.
---
I don't think cap stashes are working correctly. 
---
On my daily vendoring route through Whitespring, I pass by potentially 7 stashes. Usually I'm able to grab 3 to 5 of them. (2 are super easy to notice, so I assume that's why I haven't seen them in a while.) Tonight, there were only 4 of them there. And they all had 1 cap each. 
---
I got more caps from the Whitespring trash cans tonight.
---
I have 59 including myself who dropped stash and inventory and quit today.
---
i had a caps stash show as a lootable and not pick it up. i pick up the caps out of it. like any other lootable container. i dont have the card. got i think 13 caps.
---
No I know that it announces nukes and no one was near me, but the building I was in shook and dust fell from the roof, I’ve only been playing about 2 weeks but that was weird
---
I went through and upvoted your comments, I hope your karma count recovers
---
Wtf is a "rebuttle"? You trying to say "rebuttal"?
---
“You got tree fiddy?!”
---
PA gives hidden armor/rad resistance. If you're not in a nuke zone I don't usually run across mobs that are any threat at all. A stray mirelurk queen might be a bit scary outside my power armor, but that's about it. 350 seems a bit low if you've got much metal armor on. Either way, I use PA for nuke zones and don't when I'm not. Except for my heavy weapons toon, who requires power armor for lots of perks.
---
The only time I'm in any real danger is when the server lags and healing factor isn't applying properly... which happens far too often. Especially since the patch today.
---
I feel bad for Battlecry Studios aka Bethesda's Austin Studio. They have to deal with this and everything that comes along with the Fallout 76 game branding. 
---
Came to check if this achievement was still bugged out for others. Guess it is.
---
Quit. Think you mean unsub. Fucking normies.
---
The consensus is the nerf was necessary but this is rape. 
---
-90% of 1,000,000 fall damage is still enough to murder you, lol
---
Yeah this happened to me too. I have the card and I assumed I must have equipped it by mistake.
---
All pacifist does is makes you not hurt other players and player's things. You know, like a pacifist.

It's a total cluster fuck.  Gl
---
Was it like next to a campsite?
---
This game needs to be Borderlands
---
They need to get the game to a working state (which this patch actually helped reverse; hasn't worked for me yet since it dropped) before they get to content. The content doesn't matter if you get disconnected in the middle of it and lose all progress.
---
Thank you for being a voice of sanity.  I feel like the people complaining about Demolition Expert/White Knight/Two Shot/Explosive should take a good hard look at their peers.  The nerfs were warranted relative to the rest of the game's design.
---
Explosive is still the best secondary legendary mod on guns, Two Shot is still a perfectly competitive choice for a primary mod, White Knight still reduces your armor upkeep significantly compared to base, and Demolition Expert is *still* an efficient damage perk.
---
If it had been this way from the start, people might still have their opinion that enemy health/armor is too high, durability is too punishing, legendary effects are underwhelming, etcetera, but literally no one would be happy with the specific outliers we had before this patch being the solution.
---
Rarity wasn't a factor before since we could just server hop until we got it.  This is nonsensical.  
---
I noticed this in Watoga a couple of times tonight.  I'm guessing it's an effect of scorchbeast attacks and/or assaultrons exploding nearby.  Explosions in general seemed to have a lot more range.  
---
I thought the same thing. I was expecting a small nerf to the TSE weapons, god was I wrong. When I find a level 50 hardened sniper rifle that isnt legendary that does 160 dmg with maxed rifleman perks and my TSE does 163...I have some issues. 
---
Common rant after any big ner in any mmo/online gamed.
---
Nothing new really.
---
People are just crazy because they were used to overpowered stuff and they can't stand any changes.
---
Almost all the weapon and armour mods can be obtained by scrapping the item. So scrapping a baton gives you a small chance of discovering a random mods recipe for that item. 
---
ahh ok, gotcha.
---
They have all plans avalible to them if it's in there on loot pool. Things just cost more than they used to now.
---
Mildly challenging, but there's still plenty of time. Just don't expect the queen to drop dead within two minutes, and bring enough weapons and ammo to last the fight.
---
Im the past 30 minutes of server hoping I have an inventory of over 40 legendaries...this doesn’t seem right, and some lucky noobs gonna get a buncha goodies when I wake up. I did see I got a few “good” things but they’re all still only one star. Having 15 luck is bullshit, lol.
---
It was sorta west of Flatwoods, I think it was kind of like a campsite
---
I dont usually VATS either but when I never got hit markers or anything I gave it a shot
---
D3 solved it beautifully with torment levels. So that players further into the game could join server with higher multiplier on enemies damage/health etc. The higher multiplier on difficulty also increased drop chances so that players wanted to push the difficulty level to the max they could handle at all times.
---
And continously adding new gear that outperformed old weapons/armor, so that players needed to continue to play and loot to remain competitive against higher levels of difficulty.
---
By nerfing everything and keep enemies constant, players dont feel they progress by paying more and more hours. By letting the game multiply all numbers there is a progress even if the enemies remains as hard to kill as they were before.
---
If it's this, the campsite is haunted. There's a holotape
---
I agree. At this point they are making things tedious, just for the sake of making them tedious. 
---
"Activity" doesn't mean productivity,
---
It also doesn't mean the dev team is paying attention to anything.
---
It just means Bethesda is paying a couple people to do minor PR stunts while this flaming turd keeps burning.
---
Thank you for arguing for atom store lunchboxes.

Missile turrets don't seem to always function properly when it comes to target acquisition, just stick with normal tier 1 or 2 ballistic turrets. They're the friendliest on your budget and frankly get the job done just fine when paired with a spotlight.
---
If youre dumb you quit because of TSE.
---
If youre smart you quit because you realized this was a rollback trumped up as an update, and the white knight nerf put of thin air when literally No one asked for it shows a clear motive to these nerfs and it aint to balance shit out.
---
Exactly, but I had to try.  Someone needs to go do it in PA or with 2 armor pieces to complete the experiment.
---
I was a big fanboi (girl) of this game, defending it against all the haters and click greedy youtubers since launch. I have given up on this and playing the game both some month ago. And my hunch is different then yours. You think there will be something by 2020? I think that something will just be a new different game. I don't think they will ever fix this, or ever wanted to. I'm afraid they just wanted to sell this ancient engine one more time, re wrapped, all assets from their old game reused, that was the mission here - just milk that old rusty bitch one more time, and leave it for death with the few people hardcore enough to stick with it. I have never been this disappointed about a game/studio ever :(
---
Snail pace to correct bugs and add something of value to the game, whereas they should hotfix their shit each day till it finally works.
---
Introducing as much (if not more) bugs as they are trying to correct, showing they don't know jack shit about how their spaghetti code works.
---
Concentrating essentially on pvp, and as they chose not to have different set rules for pvp and pve, slowly nerfing and removing what made pve fun (I don't have TSE but you can already see they will start to nerf melee and sneak after that).
---
Nerfing things out the blue, such as QoL perks like white knight.
---
More like fake leaving the game is the new bandwagon people are hopping on
---
You probably have a stealth build? 
---
Is it really haunted? I’ve never seen the holotape
---
The longer the fight draws out the worse the frame rate gets.

How's it illegal?  What...?

---
And I didn't believe this, just because of the sheer love and amount of energy that must have been put into creation of the map by someone. Someone really put their everything into that, just to be let down by everyone else whos in on the project.
---
Thank you for your feedback. Temporary stash increase lunchboxes will be coming soon!
---
We all toughed it out from the beginning. Griefers and PvP are new dynamics in this version of Fallout but thats not why people are leaving. Its the persistent problems that continue to exist after a patch. 
---
Just did a run. Went through three Gatling lasers, a super sledge and I think 7 ultracite fusion cores but we beat her with like five minutes to spare. Definitely more challenging. 
---
You don’t have to use any healing items but you do have to be outside of combat in order for it to work. In other words it must say “hidden” when you crouch in order for it to work.
---
I think all hope is lost. Bethesda doesn't seem interested in putting in the effort it would take to fix this game. And with the amount of bad press and general hate they got at the beginning, I can't say I blame them. Well, Id o blame them, actually, but not as much as I should.
---
&gt;I’m sure they still had help from other studios during development on design, but this wasn’t a project that Bethesda Studios completely focused on
---
According to Tod Howard, in the documentary NoClip did, this game was overseen by him (as Producer) and BethesdaAustin had *EIGHT OTHER STUDIOS* helping them out.  Basically every studio Zenimax owns (other than ZO) was namechecked by this dude as contributing to FO76.
---
Howard wouldn't lie to us, would he?  
---
Stop having biased subs dedicated to circle jerking. 
---
I’ve jumped off that more than once
---
So fun :)
---
The towers deep south of ash heap are also wonderful to drop off
---
Ew... controller.
---
If you can’t handle some bad times you don’t deserve the good times
---
This game literally has had no energy put into PvP. At all. Seriously there’s nothing besides the basic functionality they put in and that’s it.
---
Stop blaming this game’s shortcomings on other play styles and players and point the finger at the devs who are underdeveloping the product as a whole.
---
If you made the game less PvP in its current state there’d be no PvP at all. So how about more game in general.
---
First thing I did on any playthrough of 4 or NV was to enable unlimited carrying capacity. Fuck inventory management.
---
Until someone sends you a request and goes to destroy your base just because they can
---
The new “point” a level is b.s.
---
Time to free up some disk space then my friend
---
Yes... This is true. They shouldve never released it in the state it was in. 
---
I'd like to echo what almost everyone else has said.
---
I stopped playing it about a week ago and I don't think I'm looking back.  I was a loyal supporter specifically of this game and it's concept but I just had enough.  Inventory navigation is a mess, im still not comfortable with it after hours upon hours of playing.
---
There's so much more to say but so many other people have said it better.  The foundation of this game, the more I play it - the more I see how flawed it is.  There is really nothing to do except keep looting...keep looting in order to do basically nothing but loot some more.   It's not even about people rushing to be high level.  There's simply nothing to do.  PvP is a disaster at the moment.  Shooting / detection is still a disaster for me.  There are so many other things that are a disaster that I would be making the longest post in the history of reddit.  
---
This game needs to make it easier and more comfortable for people to want to group together.  Not just easier as in seeing a list, but to give people a real motivation at all timer to want to work together.   Having everyone be perma "red" was an absolutely atrocious idea and keeps people paranoid from wanting to group together with anyone other than there personal friends.  So you stay solo.  If we were on bigger fixed servers where reputations were made of who was the pvpers vs the non-pvpers this would be MUCH better, but the game keeps putting you into brand new worlds every time with brand new people so no one knows anyones reputation.  So everyone has a right to be paranoid.
---
In leveling up, as I was leveling up, i started to ask myself "why am i leveling up - what is my motivation to level up".  Most games like this have some sort of clear tangible bunch of goals to make you want to keep leveling up.   To me, this game just has the goal of wanting to collect better loot, and possibly the nail in the coffin that got me to lose interest in this game was when i came to the realization that Beths is forcing people intentionally and specifically to make a goal of there leveling up just to extremely slowly unspec.  This is frankly terrible especially in this day in age (I've been playing these types of games before many of you were even born).  I feel like they knew they had no real ideas for end game and were just like "we have no real end game fellow developers...so, let's just slow down the EXP gained immensely, make it really slow to respec, nerf weapon power, and make weapons break a ton".  So the end game becomes not a healthy end game, but just a need to fix yourself from random beths nerfs, slow'd down exp grind, and loot gathering just for the sake of loot gathering.  
---
And some of you poor people trying to enjoy the game, it's so sad.  Because it reminds me of kids from the 1920's great depression where they got like a cardboard box and they tried so hard with their imagination to turn it into something really unique and amazing.  But it just shouldn't have to be like this in this day and age.  
---
I guess I'm just ranting now / letting off steam.  I don't even feel bad about posting this because at this point in the game's lifespan and current state, I feel it is within our moral right as supporters of this project to let the developers know that if they don't do something major and soon, that this game will go down as one of the biggest bombs of the past decade.  Me personally, I'm taking a break now.  But I wasn't supposed to be taking a break.  Through the poor rollout of this game, I have been forced to take a break from this game.  Perhaps permanently.
---
I have a 3440x1440 as well and just tried it and there seemed to be some weird stuff at the very edge of the screen, but seemed playable. Going to try switching fullscreen, windowed, fov, etc and see if it can be remedied, but if that is the only issue with it, it is a minor annoyance and not fully "broken" so to speak.
---
What gun will you replace it with? It's still best in class. 
---
Um, no one pays $30-60 to experience a bad time.
---
Hasn't cheated once, but clearly cheated????
---
Could be a good idea, but I very much doubt it will happen. The game will never sell like their flagship games at this junction with the bad reviews etc. The maryland team has moved to Starfield a long time ago and I very much doubt that they will cease on that game which they probably think will be the money cow to fix fo76. 
---
Bullshit. Unless you aren’t a heavy build and have zero damage perks, in which case, what did you expect? I run a heavy build and just have a regular 50cal, I down supermutants with maybe 20 bullets
---
Same happened to me! 
---
I'm not so sure this was as simple as an older game build being re-released! Definitely bugs added but I can confirm at least duping is not back and I have it on good authority that fusion core workshop production levels and fusion core auto charging are not back either (although I am testing this later myself)
---
There still was/is a dupe glitch people aren’t talking about though. No way guys could have multiples of the legendary hunting rifles the way that they seem to have popped up in trader without one. I have seen the same couple guys posting the same guns repeatedly even though they are getting karma from people for selling it.
---
The curtains have been pulled back and it’s easy to see how truly fukt up their rng system is.  I mean there are plans at vendors that people don’t even know what they are because nobody has ever seen them.  Straight jokes
---
Exactly, now you can play melee or gtfo - I wanted to play sniper, but it's pointless now - my weapons was nerfed like 70% and barely scratch most bullet-sponges enemies...
---
There's no fall damage at all in power armour, I've jumped off some pretty tall places and after 3-4 seconds falling ,boom, and walk away
---
Fallout 5 is more than a decade away. Plenty of games in between to see if they still got it for single playergames. 
---
Yes. Prewar visitor comments to park rangers mention screaming (which you can still hear occasionally),spinning picture frames, and shaking buildings. 
---
Don't you realize you log in test servers every day?
---
I quit a while ago when I realized that there was literally NO CONTENT whatsoever left for me to do. It feels like I've been waiting for ages for some new content, but it seems like that isn't happening. And now you're telling me they rolled back to an older patch with modified values? LOL.
---
I was so mega ultra hopeful for this game and don't get me wrong I grinded the shit out of it before I quit and I kept thinking to myself, "hey, let's play a bit of fallout today", but every time that thought crossed my mind I realize that there is just nothing to do in the game. 
---
What do people who are actually well geared do nowadays? Just same old farm legendaries and nuke zones?
---
I'll grant that.  Though a CCG refund for specific cards is different than a perk card refund.  Perk cards are basically passives - they're just random.
---
In this game's situation, a respec would just be allowing you to select a set of cards (of any number - even all your cards) and let them be re-rolled.  Maybe you get something better, something different, maybe the same thing.
---
Did you check any of that before posting? Because bobby pins definitely weigh 0.1 again. Im looking at it right now, plus when i first logged in after patch my stash was at 605, have screenshots. One example of you being full of shit as usual. You complain about the "haters" but you are just as bad from the other side. Constantly attacking people in comments for criticizing the game's issues. You're pretty pathetic
---
To OP, watched your video and you didn't do it the same as other videos ive seen. I dont kbow if the same old dupe is back but i do know there are other methods that people are using daily
---
A few BoS related issues here. Have not got a support ticket number for any of this yet as I will not be at a pc for a few days but will update with it and pics if needed once I am.
---
Platform: PC
---
Bethnet name: THJT-9
---
Issue 1: BoS combat armour torso has a double imprint of the BoS logo. Looks like the file has 2 sets of the decal applied 1 of which is flipped 180 degrees.
---
Issue 2: BoS logos on the Thunder Mountain Power plant are upside down. Certainly the case for the outside, cannot remember for the inside atm.
---
Issue 3: Craftable BoS Knight Uniform and Soldier Uniforms  both use the orange/grey texture. Judging by the existence of the Officer Uniform and the naming of the different uniforms in Fallout 4 I would presume the soldier uniform should actually use the Green/Grey texture.
---
Unless they’ve changed the values, everything but lead and aluminum have the same weight bulked as unbulked.  Lead and aluminum save half their weight. 
---
I’d be fine with this new glitch is bulked items were weightless and you could just unbulk them when needed. 
---
For a game where they really made the end game nothing more than a grind for materials and weapons, having dick all stash size is a massive handicap and yeah I agree with you there I’ve not played it in a week and I don’t think I’ll be picking it up any time soon. Each update just adds as much bugs as fixes 
---
I’m pretty sure the enemies from the wolf pack event, and thus their drops are level 10, so you’d get 5-10 stuff off them.
---
Rare plans are rare
---
no point in even killing the queen. the reward can be bought and given elsewhere from what i read here.
---
You can always reroll. Maybe play as a melee character if you’re a gunner already.
---
Yup I noticed, they will fix it; seems they are glitched at one caps. Definitely not intentional so just do vendors as per usual for caps till they fix it.
---
Whats up? I made my base a merchant store with an apartment above it on top of a little tunnel area I put public benches in. [Raid N’ Trade](https://imgur.com/a/M2UDIFg) 
---
&gt; Everyone ignored every word that was said about what the game would be 
---
What I saw from the announcement with YouTubers and Streamers was people knowing exactly what it would be, pre-ordering it, bitching about what it was, then bitching they couldn't return it after also knowing there was no refunds.
---
Please reread what I said.  None of your points are relivent to what I said.  I was not argueing weither the nerf was needed or not overdone. 
---
The point is that buffing is not always preferable to nerfing.  When something needs adjustments, you adjust the outliers or whatever requires the fewest adjustments.
---
The same principle applies to the explosives damage perks. They wanted to bring that perk in line with its equivalents. With that goal, It makes more sense to nerf it then buff multiple other damage perks to match it.
---
This principle applies to any buff/nerf decision. Unless you're trying to make a larger change, you go with the option with the least impact.
---
Hotfixes are probably no that easy for them to rollout, because everytime they change something little, you have to download the whole .esm file and this cause a lot of traffic. When you are on PC and have a SSD, this is not nice to have. If they fix one single texture file, you have to redownload the whole ba2 file.
---
Someone at Bethesda made a deliberate decision: Let's enable the emotional four-year-olds to destroy the camps — including items like decon arches that require blast zone farming to repair — even of the players who've already chosen not to participate at all, ever, in PvP.
---
That person should be fired, as should his/her boss for not seeing to a fix by now.
---
This is just indefensible on the part of Bethesda, *unless* their *sole* target audience are emotional four-year-olds with credit cards. They've certainly proved there are a lot of those, but are there enough to keep this game viable when the rest of us bail out?
---
That’s what I said about design, others helped design it, maybe lending help in texturing and building the world or adding some new things to kill, but that’s not our problem with it is it? 
---
It’s the instability issues and bugs it has that seem to never get fixed along with its slow reaction to fix things or add content we want. If a billion dollar studio with EIGHT studios working on this made this then maybe Bethesda needs to halt Starfield and ES6 right now because this is rookie stuff they are messing up on and theyre moving at a snails pace. I can safely assume the only developer still working on patches is the Bethesda Austin studio.
---
Agreed
---
There's an earthquake machine at the camp. You can turn it off/on using the terminal in the treehouse.
---
&gt;  get 2.5x sneak attack criticals at a rate of about 5-7 shots per second from a distance
---
hitting what exactly? even the best recoil mods make that impossible
---
Everyones upset... Hardcore and casual players. 
---
I do but I still get swarmed by ghouls a lot
---
I don’t really care about the nerf, the rest of the update is shit aside from the plan indicator.  
---
If a spreadsheet I saw previously is correct, Electrified should have a 15% chance of unlocking for each baton scrapped. It's definitely a scrap mod anyway.
---
There's a baton spawn on one of the desks in the military wing in the Enclave bunker. Probably others in police stations but I don't recall.
---
Are you a leader of somekind of cult?
---
Of course people leave for good, but there are also those who say that they quit, but still play or return after awhile. 
---
We all quit someday.
---
Ghoul Slayer's baton
---
Lol. I literally laughed out when I read the comment before thinking exactly what you wrote
---
Here we go again.
---
I 100% support this, but sadly people rarely do this due to the risk
---
yep had to break them down to repair my Gauss.
---
Sorry for your loss. 
---
I was expecting a nerf to explosive shotguns, I was not expecting a 95% damage reduction. I actually thought my instigating explosive double barrel was pretty well balanced given the long reload time and high risk of splattering myself when enemies get too close. Now it's practically useless WITH EVERY APPLICABLE PERK applied (not to mention running salt on the wounds of explosive weapons fans). It's almost as if the devs just picked a number out of a hat and didn't even test the results of the "balance" nerf...
---
The only way to deal with griefers is to reverse-grief them.
---
Good for F’ing Vault Tech. At what point can we riot from our comp/ps4/xbox and rally against Bethesda who continues to ruin an already “balanced” game?! Ffs, honestly, F u Bethesda.
---
Sorry, a disenchanted player.
---
TSE Auto Prime Handmade went from 409 to 133 with the Commando perks. That’s more than enough of a reason to uninstall. 
---
I’m not going to play a game where the devs have no idea what theyre doing and see no issue with completely gutting the only legendary effects that made the endgame somewhat fun.
---
Actually that one was the easiest of them all, and has been in since BETA! Literally randos on xbox invite me to teams to try and get me to help them dupe ha. That was the "modus exploit" that was addressed in the patch. The way it worked is that you would sell an item to modus. Then you and up to 2 friends would both coordinate and  purchase the item at the same time and voila! He sells all of you the item! There may be other private methods to dupe as well but these wouldn't be seen en masse as the high level exploiters usually have private discords and are secretive about their methods to prevent letting the cat out of the bag.
---
Oh... guess i should ve asked that 1st, i m on ps4
---
The cost of going melee is more damage to armour, potentially more stims used and, the big one, more diseases. Given that diseases last an increased amount of time compared to what they use to plus the relative rarity of anti-disease chems, it's not like melee is an instant win.
---
Depends on the situation and what you have.
---
REEEEEE
---
Ahh I can see how that would work given the multiple access points 
---
Ghoul slayers baton is better
---
It's ok they're no longer suffering
---
I dont honestly know where people got the idea that this game was supposed to be pvp heavy. Like they heard survival and thought some fortnight rust clone bullshit. 
---
Wow you’re a real pariah
---
Can you read?
---
I said ppl saw Bobby pins and ran with it.....
---
As in the pins are wrong.
---
My LOLs come from the people who used to complain the game was too easy and they had nothing to do have had their TSE's nerfed and are now complaining things are too hard and don't want to respec because that would take work and gameplay.
---
Literally every heavy gun.
---
LMG is literally unusable, .50 cal shouldn't deal significantly less than a 50 cal hunting rifle, just chews through ammo, the whole point of these guns is high damage for shittons of weight.
---
Don't get me started on the fat man that doesn't even kill 2 scroched with a goddamned MIRV.
---
Like, this is just pathetic tbh.
---
You can either find the mod or but the plans, or learn it by scrapping batons as far as I know that's the only mod for batons
---
It keeps players grinding for longer. 
---
The devs are likely trying to keep their jobs by trying to inflate a metric for player hours. If they fall post patch, there will likely be layoffs.
---
I hate to break it to you, but a change in leadership at BGS Austin isn't going to change anything. At least not at the heart of the problem. For me 76 confirmed what I have long since feared. Bethesda is no longer the Bethesda of old, they have gone over to the dark side of corporate greed. They now act more like the Activision's and EA's of the gaming world. 
---
It's been going on for a long time. You could say it really started with Horse Armor in Oblivion. It really started in earnest with the whole paid mod fiasco for Skyrim. Then there was increasing the price of the Fallout 4 Season pass after it was already out. Moving their games off Steam, making it harder to get refunds. Making it so that if you wanted to mod the console versions of Fallout 4 or Skyrim, you had to buy the pc version as well. Oh and it didn't matter if you bought the original version of Skyrim, they make you buy the Special Edition all over again. 
---
Bethesda has been going downhill for awhile now. It looks like with 76, the snowball is picking up speed. 
---
Yea thats actually the reason that the Modus terminals are giving people a "busy" error message after the patch. So that only 1 can be in use at a time. An effective although sloppy fix, I'd have preferred they just remove the extra terminals since they're currently useless. 
---
my current build was explosive and handguns... guess I'm now just unarmed as well.
---
My feedback is very important to Todd Howard.
---
You have to scrap your bulk now unfortunately. 
---
&gt;I for one will never pre-order a BGS game ever again, or even purchase at launch for that matter.
---
Ditto — even though I pre-ordered this one and participated in the PC beta (joke that it was), and I have many, many hundreds of hours in this game, Fallout 4, and Fallout NV. *I feel betrayed.*
---
But atoms.
---
The patch was the nail in the coffin. The endgame has been dragging out for about a month now and we're all getting burned out from the lack of new content. Its ok but its kinda sad. 
---
Like I said... griefing is a real risk. But I believe it’s one worth taking. Keep your base minimalistic and it even further downsides the risk. 
---
That is by far the most ridiculous comment you can give about a critique of a product you buy. Imagine if it was a fridge.
---
Thanks for taking a moment to replay.  However, what you described is what is what is supposed to happen without the card present.  This thread is asking about issues with the Caps Collector card failing to trigger the search option.  If you don't have the card, I'm afraid you won't have the ability to make any statistical or anecdotal observations.  
---
Cool. Bye!
---
Yes, I can help add some color to this feedback.
---
The idea is that if the average cost of plans is going up by a multiple, then in turn, the multiple of caps that we are able to earn on a daily basis should also go up, too.
---
Calibrated Shocks used to cost ~700c.  Granted, I would have to perform the mind numbing act of server hopping for several hours and hoping to get them.  
---
Now they are guaranteed to be sold but while the cost has gone up ~10x (6,600c), we are still limited to the 1,400c daily vendor caps limit for selling bulk, items, etc.
---
Dog this game has been dead since November lol
---
Yup, paranoia is real my guy haha
---
I’ve been running about a 3/5 success rate tonight. Promising if not perfect results.

---
fev exposure ?
---
Because they want to artificially increase player hours. 
---
They likely know that layoffs are coming if they can't reverse falling user numbers and less engagement.
---
And why did we need those again?
---
They didnt want people to shuffle around inventory on characters and people to dupe like crazy knowing they cant anymore
---
Perfectly said
---
Agreed. Energy weapons in particular need a real buff.  The ultracite gatling laser takes some grinding to get the plans and more grinding to build.   And it's an item that is unique to this game so I expected it to be something special.  I have not desire for it to to one- shot kill everything. I was just expecting it to make high level enemies a lot less bullet-spongy. 
---
It does nothing of the sort. It's very underwhelming and it breaks very fast, and drains fusion cores really fast too (even with power user perk maxed out). 
---
The Ultracite Power armor is unique to the game, requires grinding and is powerful. 
---
The Ultracite gatling laser is unique to the game, requires grinding, and is weak as hell. 
---
The grind just got easier for plans! 
---
Yup and you have fanboys defend it with, "Well if thats the way the devs want it to be we should just accept it and be thankful for it" or " BUT THE GRIND MAN!!!! IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GRIND!!!!!1111111!!!!
---
Ciao bella
---
For 9 shots, anyways.
---
By not nuking her anymore. Nuke somewhere else. 
---
it has happened to me too.  so many bugs in this game, i just gave up reporting them all.  seems Bethesda wants us, the players, to be their Q/A department.
---
I’ve been trying to hop for BOS legs and jumped on excited to finally upgrade my last remaining pieces and boom, nothing.
---
Now I can’t even hop. They’re just gone. I’ll be looking into this further to figure out that I can do. It was an actual thing I was trying hard to do, a fun goal to have...and there’s no information in the patch notes about these plans or the other missing ones.
---
They said mods are still random but these are plans!
---
Agree 100%. I've enjoyed the game for the most part so far, but like with other MMOs I've played, the moment it starts to feel more like a chore than a game, I will stop and never think twice about coming back.
---
Well, I'm not sure how I could've crafted the boards any differently! Recommended intelligence is around 5 and mine was 8, all boards were confirmed identical and not crafted under different perks or effects. And their actually was a dupe method so easy that was being used daily but doesn't seem to have been picked up on by the general population. It was actually fixed this morning however and I will link my comment that explains how it worked!
---

---
Don’t forget carrying over the dev room from the game this one was built on top of and including it in the retail version.
---
It’s painfully clear there is little to no online game experience going into the making of this game.
---
Indeed. I think I may go blow up camps for fun now, due to my build struggling to kill level 25 radrats now. :D. At least walls cannot fight back. I'll just spend all of my 8K caps on some overpriced plan so I have nothing to lose, right? But really. The TSE was excessive. As for the Small, increasing population of griefers" I fear that is all that may be left. People are leaving due to the excessive amount of bugs that have returned, weapons they spent hundreds of hours grinding now being essentially "barely better than a slingshot". I cannot see a point to keep playing this at its current state. I will have to grind a minimum of 60 levels to respec into melee or something, which will probably be getting nerfed soon anyway (Because, Nerfs are the ONLY way to balance games, right?). Anyway, Just my two cents. Take them how you will.
---
Heavy weapons.
---
Lol at anyone who paid 60 bucks for this game
---
Also looking for them. It would be nice for this info to be in the patch notes...
---
Small trade off for keeping the community happy. Simple solution as well would be ban dupers. They can track players who have characters with millions of items. 
---
My TSE hardened handmade went from 430ish,I cant remember exactly to 163....163. Yea,sure they were OP,I was telling myself all day that I could live with the damage dropping to high 200s to low to mid 300s. I come home to 163 damage and find a basic gun is the same as my end game gun. That's beyond to much of a nerf. Period. Like you said, it should not take more than 1 shot to kill a level 14 super mutant or robot. My shotgun is sorta okay damage wise and at least useable after all this but I'm really unhappy. 
---
&gt;  Out of the 32 people on my friends list that own this game, only 3 are still active.
---
They're celebrating that 29 rubes bought the game at full / close to full price and they no longer have to run servers for them.
---
I feel raped and naked now. 
---
Wtf, those perks were too overpowered with high intelligence. If you know how to play the fucking game and put the right points into the right place you’d know that it takes forever for weapons to break. Respecing is already part of the game, if you don’t know how to fucking build perks to your play style, the of course the game is not going to be fun. Creating builds in Fallout has been a massive part of the game since Fallout 3, if you have don’t like it you can go back to Destiny and freely respec all the skill trees you want. Fallouts replayability is in new characters and new builds since FO3 
---
I think if they could they would track it
---
Bethesda hates you anyway, why give in now.
---
Its weird sometimes it won’t and sometimes“ it just works“
---
&gt;	They're great at updating the atom store with things, and not as fast doing the bug and exploit fixes or quality of life things
---
Hmm, it's almost like you can see where their priorities lie...
---
The fact that we're having a discussion over this is why I said that there are no easy answers.
---
Like take for instance the example you gave. That's something along the lines of what I would expect too rather than what the word respec implies, which is a full top-down change (or at least that's my experience). 
---
The question then is, if you allow perk card re-rolls, what about the SPECIAL you allocated to make use of those cards? 
---
Should you be allowed to respec those too? If so, how? Just the number of points that the nerf perk card has? Do you pick the max number or just go with the number of stars you have on the card? 
---
If you have say a 5 star card that you have never used, is it fair to not only re-roll those 5 perk cards but also get to respec 5 SPECIAL points too, even though you were never affected?
---
Personally, I'm fine with a card respec and that's it, like you said too, but others may not see it that way.
---
same here. 
---
Can you pass  this along to the devs?
---
Ask them why are they making the game more tedious for the sake of being more tedious with nerfs that no one asked for? Do they seriously not want people to play the game? Because this is how you get people to quit playing the game. 
---
Your comments is silly mate, we paid for the game. you invest your time for it to be taken away because of Bethesda’s poor management of the game. I have stuck with it in the bad times 3 months now 1 month beta. And finding my frustration is just increasing with Bethesda. 
---
Tell you I will not be buy any more Bethesda games on a blind whim of trust as I once did and ESO and Starfield better be mind blowing for me to pick up another Bethesda game.... not good, not great, but mind blowing that if they want my $100.
---
Can we stop blaming the engine and blame the people neglecting to fix the engine’s bugs?
---
OMG!!  that would be hilarious!!
---
Beth goes bankrupt over fo76!!  HA HA HA!!!
---
They dont fix problems, they change the game to be able to run better with the problems. I agree this is not good.
---
But with a non moddable game its unforgivable. 
---
Pros: nothing 
---
Contra: destroyed camp, repair cost for decon shower (again), maybe pvp, guaranteed pvp when workshop, vulnerability while accepting team invite 
---
... all so you can save 10 caps or so 
---
I used weapons with stalkers prefix to guarantee I was hitting her
---
Don't remember. Will check today. 
---
This post will be downvoted to hell but just because you are upset at a game’s current situation doesn’t make you an expert on how games function and what would be best. I’m not an expert either but at least I’ve studied the field a bit. Community feedback can be helpful when it concerns the community but almost useless when concerning the innerworkings of a company.
---
Great, that helps with the people who have 10,000 of something and are selling on ebay.
---
lol, loved that movie when I was younger, gotta watch it again now :P Thanks \^\^
---
Bethesda is BARELY working on this game. Ask Pete, oh wait, he’s out working on something else.
---
GT: Evil Bob 78
---
Cant agree.
---
Game is more broken than ever. Dont remove Limits Bethesda or the economy or whats left of it is gone.
---
And to all the, I WANT NOW people...just Grind a few Days.
---
Don't remember if I had rad worms. Will try again today. 
---
The caps limit is far too low to earn any real amount of money without grinding for it and the stash limit is too low to be able to save items to be able to sell them later, resulting in more grinding. 
---
It’s frustrating to spend the first hour or two of your game managing inventory then fast traveling from vendor to vendor to try to sell/buy items. Not to mention how frustrating it is when you do this at the beginning of your playing time only to find that most weapons, armor, chems, and junk have to be left or dropped because you can’t store them or sell them. 
---
I spent the last few weeks bulking junk to sell and adding in a plastic grind to my route. I had gotten up to about 12,000 caps. I spent a few weeks worth of work on a handful of plans last night. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. 
---
Nobody selling duped items gives a damn about caps. People are paying in paypal, etc
---
I bet most of you used to fly with the Strange In Numbers perk sharing method. Fight me in pvp if you didn’t and call that cheating coz that helped with the queen. Cheaters are duplicaters, perk card hackers, and players who used the bobble head stacking exploit. Literally all major fixes in each update. My buddy has 2 mule characters(only one in use so far) and is a pre beta player. The only thing he ever really exploited was the Artillery piece container inventory would become part of his stash after the camp was stored, therefore just adding onto whatever was already in there. He had a stack of nuka colas for us all, including 5 low levels we’ve become friends with. We were almost finished the stack. He was almost finished clearing his stash before the update, which seems to have locked anything over 1500.... so tell me how have we actually cheated? We never duplicated anything. LOL. Sorry to burst your bubbles but we’re also honest players. Seems like some people have been wiped across the map too much by tse weapons. Seriously grow the fuck up and realize not everyone cheats just because some people are fucking hoarders doesn’t give you rights to point fingers. Come on PVP me bitches!
---
You’ll be able to take her down. We beat her earlier with a less optimal group than when I’ve run it with you. It took a while and broke several weapons. But if you get anything like the groups we’ve had together, you’ll be fine. 
---
I’d join you but I’m not on right now. Good luck!
---
Ya i was on and server hopped a lot and could not find any nuked servers.
---
It simply is not worth it anymore.  Even if you killed her, do you really need another copy of "Plan: Explosive Vent".
---
I feel you. Gotta just go out grieving 
---
The most calls I've had on me at one time was about 1700, so this sucks for people who actually didn't dupe 
---
Todd Howard is the executive producer of this game so I assume, outside of crisis meetings, he is mostly focused on Starfield
---
Things don't break too fast except for a few things, mainly the laser/plasma weapons.   If I forget to equip my gunsmith perk, I know it right away of course because it will break faster but I can finish at least 2 areas before that happens.  (about 1-1.5 hours).
---
It was not a rollback in version.   The patch just re-broke stuff, that's all.   It happens all the time in software development. &lt;shrug&gt;
---
I find it pretty galling actually that a "player" would say "This is a gross and unforgivable level of incompetence" when the OP cannot even program something like this game in 10 years by themselves.   
---
Did they put out a game that people play for 200+ hours, yes!  
---
Did they make profit on the game? Yes!  
---
Mission completed.
---
&gt;The question then is, if you allow perk card re-rolls, what about the SPECIAL you allocated to make use of those cards?
---
Sure, why not?
---
&gt;If you have say a 5 star card that you have never used, is it fair to not only re-roll those 5 perk cards but also get to respec 5 SPECIAL points too, even though you were never affected?
---
Is it really?  What if you turned down a lot of different cards because you *had* to pick certain ones just to counter annoying and stupid game mechanics - a lot of people pick item lightening perks or carryweight perks to get around the crazy low total weight limits and that a lot of items are several times their real-world weights (like assault rifles that weigh *fourteen pounds*!).
---
I feel bad for people who hopped for those plans. I found them multiple times a day alongside metal building at harpers ferry for a week until i finally had the caps to buy them.
---
Im glad you got them tho its nice not have my walls sneezed on just to break 😀
---
Just killed one with a group of like 10. Didn't take any longer than my usual times. Most of them were smacking with melee tho
---
My favorite thing about fallout is building so making it smaller just to pay less if someone destroys it all so that they can fast travel for free isn't worth it
---
Todd, is that you?
---
I guess so lmao. That was honestly the last thing I wanted to start doing. Role playing is one thing but murdering for caps hahaha it’s almost like Fallout is becoming real life in its own sadistic way......
---
Finally, thank you!
---
So tired of all these cry baby posts 
---
and another one's gone, and another one's gone..........bethesda has bit the dust.
---
Oh.
---
I only use white knight to repair so it's unchanged for me.
---
Btw that's a shady use of math.
---
That's like me saying tse was worth 45 levels as tse+5pts of demo = 300% damage and 9pts for any gun= 60%.
---
9x5= 45.
---
It's fucking ridiculous that you have to create a reddit thread to get a response for a ticket... What the fuck are you guys doing? Like seriously, what the fuck?
---
And while I wait for shit comments I’m gonna go read some r/nosleep
---
As silly as it was, the end game was essentially server hopping all day for rare vender drops to make a best-equipped character. Now everyone's beat the end game for free.
---
What's left to do until new content comes out? Another character? I've already deleted two of them that were level 60+ because I wanted to start over for the seventh time.
---
Just not much to do in this game right now. I don't blame your friends for stepping back.
---
Let's all just stop pre-ordering ANY games, please!
---
not sure now after the latest patch, but one spawns at the gorge junkyard.  i farm there a lot and have see it and the pearl hand grips too.
---
Exactly, at least little to no experience with the creation engine and online. I was going to mention that rookie mistake in the post too, why the hell would the dev room still be left in a game that supposedly had 8 studios working on it, including one that made ESO, and they didn’t remember to remove that. Well for one it’s the engine and two, it’s because they never had experience with it before making the game besides implementing it in doom and their first game that was never released. If you read the first article I linked and go to development it explains a lot.
---
They have already begun banning people with characters that carry too many items. They can track it.
---
Honestly, it’s a great time to get into the game. They’ve made a ton of quality of life adjustments, overall stability is way up, and they’ve done a ton of game balancing.  
---
It is an absolutely terrible time to ask this question on this reddit as they say, “the salt overfloweth” from the recent patch nerfing a beloved but broken weapon/perk system.
---
Hello friend I think you may enjoy my latest post, I'll admit I took you up and was wrong!
---
My apologies you were not. I guess I was trying to say Anthem will most likely be like Fallout 76. So don't get you're hopes up.
---
Everyone can get 1400 a day. When you deplete the 200 caps you see there, people who haven't depleted them still see them.
---
Im guilty but Im also expressing concern as i hate to see some friends leaving after 'this patch'. 
---
yeah.  maybe then, your servers will stop brain farting and allow me to play for more than 45 minutes in a stretch.
---
That's why I stopped playing...
---
Hmm.  How much was the repair cost with Construction equipped?
---
I wonder what the bounty was on that player....
---
They have been going it by people reporting other people tho. Not by randomly checking people
---
Saving up caps for days on end? 
---
No, the game isn't broken, because it's still in beta, and what is still in beta isn't complete and thus can't be broken ;D
---
Yeah, they're looking to inflate player log on hours, likely because that is a metric that will be used to decide how much money will be spent / how many people will be kept on to design new content.
---
MMW, someone will leak emails after they get laid off.
---
depends if you have a bloodied build or not
---
I know but there is nothing else to do
---
This mentality is why we can’t have nice things. 
---
Why is always some responders tag that response with some bs, fanboy assholes 
---
I am the QA now.
---
LOL!  thats awesome!   Mental image of a guy casually tossing some jacks in front of a door as he walks away..
---
LMAO!!  now the admins are getting pissed!
---
Happens to me everyday. Those Vendors probably robbed for for a thousand caps by now.
---
They dont get how the Game works, now they are here talking nonsense and blame other people for their stupidity.
---
Obviously you only Bulk to sell. They just dont get it.
---
We had several patches in a row where things were slowly getting better, and than this, Atom save us all. 
---
Satire? Trolling? Shit, I can't tell anymore.
---
There are two options for blocks.  One says "Session block" the other says "Block".   (PC Version)  Not sure if the same options are available for console.  So I assume the "Block" is permanent.
---
Mods on a power trip in the my fo76 subreddit?  I guess it's more likely than I thought.
---
This is the most succinct description of an abusive relationship that I've ever heard.
---
Pros: being a nice person
---
Change they will drop something as a thank you 
---
Ok, so that's what's going on. I was wondering why my mutations weren't working.
---
I've noticed weird weight things myself in various containers and work benches as well as my personal inventory..... thought I was crazy at first  😆
---
BTW who is game dev lead for FO76  ?
---
How about publishers stop rushing to release games while *counting on* customers accepting that the games are 1-2 years from completion at launch?
---
That's her!   She was my favorite companion.  Some found her irritating, but I always brought her!
---
The whole patch is so messed :( lol. Spent the entire day meandering about. Didn’t go too far from camp. Was so broke. Forgot to drink nukas last night. One of my friends has nukas for me and can’t take them out of his stash... couldn’t do events, couldn’t buy aid or resources or anything. Caps I made from super mutants was spent on short distance fast travels :( so sad. Bethesda basically took anyone with odd looking stacks of stuff on accounts and locked their stash. My poor friend can’t even empty his stash and scrap his bull stuff. I’m lucky I constantly make ammo. No odd stacks for me. We aren’t cheaters :( why Bethesda why... :(
---
There's a bug in the new patch preventing you from using bulk items to craft. You have to break the bulk first
---
Yep me too. Lol. 
---
"Power trip" is an odd way to say "removing effortless duplicate posts and leaving the better ones up" but ok.
---
I bated to this thread. sorry not sorry
---
Plenty of players were offering PA mod installment for much cheaper though. They weren't hard to get with those traders around.
---
Yeah you can't really min/max and go bloodied melee cause you just take too much damage getting hit all the time, that being said if you dope up on furry, party boy whiskey, glowing meat steak, Yaoguai steak, molerad chunks
---
You can get your strength to 30 at full health with +50% damage, no other weapon class can boost themselves like that
---
That's where your wrong buddy..enchanted weapons lost charge...thats it no durability 
---
I suspected this was the case before the patch, not 100% sure however.
---
Then stop playing already 
---
Can only join people if you are loading out of a world and take their invite
---
Can't join from xbox, can't accept game invites at the title screen
---
Xbox 1
---
That would be crazy if they sold it, I never really looked at it like that. I like 3 and 4 better than NV but clearly obsidian put passion into it, can’t say the same with 76. Who do you think would buy it if they do plan on selling? 
---
Yeah with the demo perk they should have lowered the star rating to 3 or at least changed it to 75% instead of 60%
---
While you are at it, you may want to mention that I would be a lot more likely to get the Chrome weapon skin if it could go on other guns besides the minigun... particularly now that the Silver Shroud outfit is a thing. 
---
Same here. Level 160(ish), roughly 300h, never even thought about making another character and the only times i get overencumbered is when there is no workbench nearby. Managing my stash takes me a couple of seconds. By the time i might have the thought of being frustrated about managing the stash, i'm already done.  
---
There is absolutely no point in hoarding stuff i might need in a far, slightly possible future.
---
yeah.  i have had the same thing, several times.  no rhyme or reason to it.  the screen starts to shake for what ever reason.  i thought the same thing too, am i experiencing a flash back from the california northridge earthquake?
---
TSE was OP.  There's no way around it. It was the only viable weapon option at end game. It's still incredibly powerful, but now it's just not... broken 
---
Really? I’ve personally not been a big fan of the C.A.M.P. function. I’m only level 35, so my budget is way low... I’ve been pretty satisfied to keep my base down to nothing more than 4 walls with access to resources, a couple crafting/cooking stations, and a bed.
---
Does the building function improve drastically when you get higher leveled?
---
I havent  been, but if i ever happen get on the same server and level up enough to make it there. I will be looking forward to it one office fan to another
---
Stop making the game more and more tedious with every mother@@@@ing patch and focus on what the community is asking for. Like seriously, who asked for the perk nerfs???????????? 
---
I agree, but what can the developer do at that point? Most of a games direct management team doesn’t have a say in that only does the tippy top like Todd Howard and a few others have sway on the other side and he’s always on the weaker side of the relationship. So why call for a new management team for a developer when it’s the Publisher at fault?
---
I've never used enchanted weapons or armor though. The actual rating of damage and protection will deteriorate if you use it long enough, and once it hits a point you can upgrade it with a workbench. It's something I noticed in my gameplay.
---
How about “ft game after this patch”?
---
It doesn't even matter it's still by far the strongest shut in the game. The most reliable shit in the game. Without it you are playing with BB guns except you don't get to fight cockroaches you fight goddamn autism bats and nigh unkillable super cyclops robots with magic regeneration health. This whole game is fucked. It's backwards, it's buggy, it's community is torn apart, the game is so empty, the thought was put in way after and then scrapped. We need to admit that FO76 needs a goddamn super miracle the likes of R6 Siege x10 to ever be a good game 
---
3 months plus beta and closed testing and still some of the same bugs present from a AAA company? That is not acceptable and people are getting fed up woth up. It goes though, they leaked customer data, swapped out the bags, and overall the lack of teansparency is frustrating when they said no more stealth nerfs. So yes the project manager who approves all these changes needs to be held accountable. It is no different from any other business where the project manager would be held liable for the shortcomings.
---
Wait, what? 
---
I think the latest patch is great and i enjoy the game even more (single player only)
---
Sometimes it feels like people are playing another game :)
---
I’ll probably get downvoted to hell and back for this but so much bitching on this sub lately.. move on to another game then ffs, if you’ve put in 100+ hours and don’t think you got your money’s worth i dunno what to tell you 
---
Don’t you dare say Godd Howard’s name in vain. 
---
You put too much effort in.
---
I've been playing the last 3 hours and alot of redditors are bold face liars.
---
And the parrots are doing their thing.
---
For instance repairing armor costs 2 fiber instead of 1. And fusion cores generate 8 an hour.
---
So far ONLY bobby pins are bugged.
---
All loads are faster, no more double loads.
---
Whitesprings was more stable than ever too.
---
If we assume that they use the version control system, where there are concepts of "branches", then it could have been like this: someone began to implement yesterday's patch fixes long before the previous one was released, in its own branch, without merging master to his branch all this time. And it was the version from this branch that went into release. If so, then these guys definitely should learn how to use VCS.
---
I want to upvote this multiple times!
---
It's not that- having to scrap bulk is (as I understand it) a result of the patch today.  This has been going on for a long time for me.  And I have unbulked steel scrap, lead scrap and gunpowder in my stash or on my person for the amounts shown- it's just not letting me craft with it.  
---
&gt;The 76 Development team have been quicker at releasing patches then most studios.  
---
Quality over quantity.  
---
Thankfully my moment happened during Fallout 4 but same deal. Waiting til Black Friday was so worth it. If I'd purchased at full price, I'd probably be as livid as some of these other people.
---
For me Starfield has to knock it out of the park. If it's just an ok game, I might just be done with Bethesda overall, much like I am with an EA title.
---
I feel real bad for those who bought this game and have kept holding on.... Wow are you ignorant. Do some research for once.
---
Everyone has been patient. Everyone that stayed and supported thru the bullshit have remained vigilant thru this painful process. Today marked one of the toughest for the community. This patch may be the nail in the coffin for some players. Most of my friends have left because of this patch. Its fucking sad. 
---
The problem was the rng. I hardly use PA and saw those mods a lot. I traded several of the shock plans to my friends. 
---
Sincere question: you guys are saying you lost hope and such, but if you played this game hundreds of hours, isn't that a good thing and you SHOULD move on to another game? Most games I consider a great buy if I play 75-ish hours, we've all gotten tons more than 75 hours out of 76, it is good and reasonable to want to move on, without generating a lack of hope and despair!
---
I'm not big on long-play MMOs so I totally get it if the first five posters in this thread, all disappointed, are MMOers and that's the disconnect. But if it isn't the case, I say we consider a few hundred hours an outstanding success!
---
So awesome.
---
Not only are they having fans test and report on the bugs... They got fans spinning PR!
---
Hey op these are great ideas, doubt bethesda will do any of them for that reason though. It would require too much work. 
---
I feel sorry for you. 
---
I`m playing even more :) 
---
Can someone pls nerf the whiners ... thx!
---
Blance patches can only buff, never nerf!
---
The changes are not all that huge like people are making them out to be. TSE weapons went from "god" to "really good", and white knight while not as amazing as it once was is still quite good considering.
---
Its mostly all drama for the sake of drama, which is to be expected with Bethesda games. People looking to start a stink over the smallest things.
---
&gt; Plenty of players were offering PA mod installment for much cheaper though. 
---
Been told about them countless times on here but never actually found them.  Plenty of  people claim to be able to do it but when I make it clear that I'm serious and I have the caps, they mysteriously disappear. 
---
With Pharma Farmer I find enough disease cures and Antibiotics to get me through as a Melee player.  There are also perks like vaccinated.   
---
If you have the perk, Don’t forget to also Search med cases.  On the PS4 the green triangle becomes an available option.  
---
Great job on reducing your player base. Wonder how long before you're laid off.
---
rofl, shitty game with shitty reddit mods.... what's new?
---
At least andromeda was just a bad game 
---
You've literally never posted on this sub before this, glad to have your opinion.
---
Skyrim never had weapon or armor durability that's a simple fact
---
These are multiple project managers across multiple teams. QA is headed by a different guy, PR is headed by another guy, etc. Website support and development is headed by a different person possibly by by two different people. Mismanagement will happen and it takes twice as long to fix but it isn’t just one management person’s fault. Also Triple A is unofficial moniker that bears only the weight you give it. Bugs are underestimated, they are tricky as shit to fix sometimes and are pure trial and error. They take time. 
---
No people will gouge more I’m seeing axes for 7k now and with the prices of serums being 18k I can pretty much see the prices going back up to 2k to make them or something. Prices will go up to reflect the amount they are spending on plans. Once people start gaining all the plans the prices of trades will start to go down but not what they were before the patch. Don’t expect anything to be cheaper then before.
---
you noticed that too?  EVERY other game i play gives you the patch notes BEFORE patch release.
---
makes me think that the dupers have made beth become VERY secretive.
---
TSE was broken. You might not like it, but it was too fucking strong. 
---
They seriously nerfed Monster Mash XP?
---
I mean I've been joking that the Bethesda Fun Police would implement even more XP nerfs, but then they went and did it?
---
WTF Bethesda? 
---
That being said i dont mind the vendors selling the plans at all
---
Is it any good, honestly looking for new game suggestions?
---
So it seems what I described was just differences in leveling, rather than simple degradation, my apologies for my ignorance. 
---
&gt; Add weight reducing perk for rifles, they’re the only weapons without one.
---
Or just reduce their weight in general. They are stupidly heavy for no good reason. Perks should be... perks, not things to make inventory management tolerable.
---
Feel free to disagree 'Champ'. (LOL) What makes you think that people critiquing this shit-show of an unfinished game are not qualified to do so? You are free to be a fan-boy. That's your prerogative but it's not your business to try to silence critics, including me, who have paid top dollar for a sub-standard, barely functional, unfit for purpose product.   
---
I'm sorry that you had that experience. I never had an issue when i wanted something added. I just think they had much bigger fish to fry.
---
Nah man. Next thing they will do is eliminate all food in game without getting rid of hunger.
---
IE the Ethiopia Patch
---
I’m considering this field and when I see others call for stuff like this it emboldens to say “No, that isn’t the answer here.”
---
Ah, the Mega Sloth in it's natural habitat. Posting a dank meme in these dark times... Upvoted :)
---
I see, thank you for the excellent explanation.
---
So the Two-Shot still gives the explosive bonus twice then?  
---
I would much rather the skills in the game be the mainstay and not the specific weapon you happen to find via luck or duped.
---
Yes, even before the nerf, the explosive weapons were just ok with the right perks.    I think the fix to the current state would be to raise the base damage of the explosive weapons.   If they need to make crafting ammo more expensive, then fine, but they need to do about twice the current base damage.  (PVE at least).
---
Spicy. 
---
The current shit storm going on right now a good indicator to not buy the game?  
---
Don't forget the 20,000 caps per serum recipe. grind for 2 weeks to get enough to buy 1 serum recipe. I might be able to get all the recipes by this time next year.
---
&gt; I traded several of the shock plans to my friends.
---
Practically everybody on reddit claims to  have plans for them and the ability to craft them cheap. It's finding them people in the game world to, you know, actually do it that has been the problem.
---
Excpect 2 weeks minimum. 
---
I didn't take as much issue with the dev room thing.
---
Not to say that it was smart but I get why it could be left in there i.e. saves you having to keep taking it out for the public build.
---
Just came off as either incompetent or arrogant enough to realise that people could hack their way in, even with safeguards and it looks like they had none.
---
They have no idea what they are doing. That much is clear from these "patches".
---
I mean, make them powerful swoop and claw fighters. Make them fly in and claw your shit up before flying out. 
---
The sonic spam attack is miserable and makes fighting them an incredible headache. Like they can be fun and challenging to fight without that having to spam that attack
---
You're adorable!!
---
There is still a dog dog project manager who approves all the changes. You describe an imbrella scenario. At the top of the umbrella there is a product manager who approves them all. They arent in touch with their fanbase and/or don't care. I have a bachelors degree in prpject management along with PMP certification. No excuse for how well they are laid. Any other company would have fired them when the bag scandal and customer data was leaked. 
---
Why not set up a sticky thread for people to "me too" in? That's usually the solution.
---
Interesting approach.   I did not think about blocking high bounty players.  I think I will start doing that as well.
---
Be aware though, that the two griefers that hit me were very particular on what they destroyed.   They took out my generator (I leave it outside exposed) and garage door which only gave him 15 cap bounty.
---
That’s humbly your opinion not my own. Disasters have varying lengths of time to clean up and usually it’s a *long* time. That’s my point here. The patches have fixed a lot of stuff in my experience. Some bugs will seemed to be fixed but come back, that’s part of the process. 
---
That would mean Bethesda actually admitting the made a mistake
---
Dang I never knew this, thanks for telling me.
---
Why always some random guy with no flair starting shit, smh hater assholes
---
Its ok to take a break. 
---
I agree, but I also don't see a great path forward for this game, which is the sentiment that I think is driving a lot of the recent outrage as much as this patch itself.
---
I won't pretend that Reddit is a great sample of users, so I'll just speak for myself: I'm frustrated with a lot of the gameplay currently in place, and the trend has been to make those existing systems require more of my attention rather than to introduce or concretely discuss other systems. The maintenance side of survival and reward randomization rather than progression are the specific systems I'm most annoyed by. The fun I have takes place adjacent to, or sometimes despite, many of those routines. I continue to hope for other systems, like trading and social elements, to get some love rather than a continued emphasis on more equipment repairing and randomization (the plan change in this patch did get rid of some of the latter, gratefully!). Arguably, I am just learning that this isn't the game for me despite being a fan of the series, but I can never be sure about that because of how the future is being pitched.
---
That gets back to my first sentence: I don't see a great path forward because the message about what this game is trying to become is garbled. The notes seem to indicate that someday "soon" this will be a game for everyone despite the immediate focus on PVP and the apparent rate of development. I don't mind PVP, but I struggle to see it being consistently interesting given the mechanics of a Fallout game, so I keep being excited to hear about something more. And I keep hearing that more of *something* is coming, somehow, at some point in time. I can understand trying to sell the game to everyone at launch, even if I don't appreciate it due to the inevitable disappointment some will feel. But, at this point, continuing to do so just makes me think that there is no real plan in place, or if there is a plan at least some of us, people who want different things from the game, are being mislead about it in the interests of keeping us onboard.
---
Lol I got a chuckle outa that
---
Or a pitchfork reskin into a trident 
---
the bull barrel not being in the game isnt a bug dude. I know it sounds like cherrypicking but it's literally the first line you wrote. Apart from that, there's no problem with gimmick weapons being in game, especially when they made it so they can't be legendary.
---
The drill is a solid 7/10 meme with a great animation
---
The commie whacker is literally just a plastic head-sized bat
---
And what in god's name do you expect them to do to make a paddleball a viable weapon?
---
(as a side note, i personally hope they leave the gattling gun as it is. the first time i modded a sight onto it I cried laughing.)
---
Apart from that, I havent been actively farming legendaries for a while, but i remember getting plenty of pipe weapon legendaries and I'm pretty sure a few were pipe revolvers. Is this a recent development? 
---
I think it's important for the Fallout community to be aware of a mass exodus of the player-base.
---
Though I do sympathise with the mods regarding spam.
---
Overall, Fallout 76 was a shit game and I'm glad folks realise that now - **don't forget to unsubscribe from the sub-reddit!**
---
Profitable to not play? Don't play!
---
Sticking to the system as is. No reason for a shotgun to weigh 20lb, but at least they have a weight reducing perk (that also buffs reload speed).  Every other weapon class has a weight reduction perk. 
---
&gt; a flying fuck
---
it's funny, because, you know, the SB are fucking flying
---
Well aside from this method I’ve got nothing haha. Don’t know how to kill these guys. 
---
Oh I'm well aware of the benefits of that perk. I picked up one in a pack and have never removed it since.
---
Only have a 1 star version too but that's already enough.
---
Still though, when I do go melee, I burn through them. Less of an issue when diseases didn't last 4 hours. You could just ride out some of them.
---
Oh great; censorship will definitely help support the player base. 
---
There is a three prong flaming pitchfork mod! Closest I can think of
---
Example: Nerfing all armor and resistances for both players and enemies now would make: 1) all weapons more powerful (more fun?), 2) the game have a steeper (and longer) challenge curve, 3) melee builds high risk high reward, 4) base defenses somewhat more viable.
---
I know nerfing has a bad feel to it, but you have to consider the total impact. There's a balance to strike between challenge, grindiness and power but it's not obvious. 
---
The enemies need to withstand and make enough damage to be actually dangerous, but no more. Currently I can stand in place for most enemies and pop a bullet after another until they die and maybe use one of my dozens of stimpaks (and maybe one of my dozens of radaways if it's not daytime) to remove any ill effects. There's only a handful of situations where I need to actually pay attention and this is with mostly a non-legendary sneaky sniper/assassin build who doesn't even use white knight outside of repairing armor and maybe scorchbeast fights when I remember to swap ninja for it.
---
The ammo you use needs to be a finite resource you need to manage, not something that just accumulates infinitely, but it shouldn't require monotonous grinding to get it. Having ammo weigh more but be scrappable to make the ammo you actually need would probably strike some balance. It's hard to balance the flow of material just so that you feel you need to make every shot count so hits and misses feel meaningful, but still not be constantly out of ammo.
---
It's about what kind of balance players and devs want. Making enemies withstand a lot of punishment is kind of a way to keep a game easy enough for a wide audience while not having everything be a pushover, but ultimately it just makes everything feel powerless and requires tons of grinding just to get to the fun part of the game. Making the players too powerful satisfies a select crowd, but makes everyone breeze through the game and accumulate tons of everything, then complain about stash space and lack of challenging content. Making the enemies too difficult (hard to hit, stagger effects, other gameplay-effecting changes) limits the audience to skilled players. Just making the enemies more powerful (simply increase damage/armor piercing etc) saps healing items faster and necessitates more armor repair, thus increasing grind if the rate is increased too much instead of just stopping accumulation. Stuff shouldn't accumulate too much unless you do it consciously, but regular play shouldn't require grinding if you play well.
---
Didn’t know about this. I just saw the patch note and thought there is no changes that make the game more FUN to play. Everything is completely focused on getting the game to where it should have been on release day.
---
If anything it actually made me go back and replay fallout 4.
---
The customer data being leaked seems to have been a website glitch. Why does that fall on the soldiers of the biggest project lead. With the situation you pose it seems he doesn’t know what to do but who could you replace him with? It may not be the developer’s place to call for his firing or step back from. It definitely won’t work coming from the community. This post is describing the team as a whole. 
---
What economy?
---
Wouldn't it be easier to catch people duplicating if they see them amass caps extremely quickly?
---
There really needs to be a sort of "Bounty Hunter" mode, along with the current Pacifist and non-Pacifist modes. I don't want to initiate PvP by spamming my Tesla everywhere, but I sure as hell want to kill wanted players without fumbling around in a menu.
---
Picked up the plans at watoga.
---
Heard there was a glitch with if your pet died that the budget wouldn’t change back. I remember someone said to move the camp.
---
Its not just the nerf shit... Its a Quality Control issue at this point. 
---
i have a suggestion for you, choose a different game.
---
creatures,  events , places is boring after lvl 100. everything happen in the game , is repeated many times for you and you are still looking for a attractive moment at apalachia.
---
it is not possible because the structure doesn't have that capability.
---
so because everything was trash we had to bring TSE down with it?
---
Add the ability for guns to backfire. Instantly breaking themselves and maiming your character if not killing them outright.
---
If the game doesn’t seem enjoyable and doesn’t seem like it will be enjoyable I must implore why do you still keep playing. This isn’t meant to be rude but it doesn’t seem like you like the game or do like the game, is it out of loyalty to Bethesda or trying to get your money’s worth?
---
The double loads, while awkward, were there to prevent us from being put into the game while our character and the world continued to load around us. If they got rid of them intentionally, it's a rollback, not an improvement.
---
So you're censoring posts? I've seen thousands of low quality posts in favor of every decision, but when someone says they're frustrated and leaving you decide to censor it?
---
Your entire post was extremely unprofessional and I'm questioning whether or not you got approval from the entire team before posting something like this. 
---
So....  we asked for them to be added to our C.A.M.P. and instead they removed them entirely?  Why am I not surprised. 
---
Look, I know that's their excuse but it's bullshit. Items stored in a container are more likely than not something like 8-12 characters, per item *type* and changing the *number* of that item in the container doesn't change how much space it takes up in memory or on the HDD of their server. It's not like people are bitching about being unable to make bigger C.A.M.P.s (though that would be nice), they're asking that the devs remove an obviously stupid and arbitrary limit that ***cannot*** cause lag because *that's not how computers work*.
---
Bye!
---
You're lying. There have been many effortless duplicate posts writing positive things about the game. You're essentially censoring one entire side of an argument by removing selectively like this. 
---
Yes, they dropped two mini nukes on my camp 
---
The Dev team has been taken over by the  Bethesda Fun Police, who are just taking a hammer to everything. 
---
Arbitrary daily limits just ensures people STOP playing for extended periods of time. There is little benefit to collecting things to sell if you have nowhere to sell them, and our stash space is limited so holding on to things isn't really practical. So it boils down to logging on for long enough to do the daily cap runs then log off because, what else are you going to do when you've done basically everything else?
---
Balance team is a bunch of fucking dumb asse's
---
It's actually even less ultimately for most people since all damage is additive. 
---
A roadmap is only useful and provides transparency if you provide detail and actually stick to the plan. 
---
There’s no point in telling everyone player vending, CAMP , Vault Raids, PvP, PVE content is coming if you’re vague about because then everyone waits in anticipation only to be disappointed by new patches. 
---
It’s great that you’re making bug fixes your #1 priority but you’re losing touch with people who have been here since the beta and are begging for more. 
---
I never said I was leaving. 
---
He really blew it with this one, lol. 
---
Not only did they leave it in, they left it in the same place it has always been. The retail edition should have no hard references to the room, so it’d be a simple compile flag to auto remove it from retail builds.
---
In fact, stripping dev code from public releases is the exact reason build flags exist. They just, they fucked this into the ground hard.
---
So this I the first version where text in the loot window and other places isn’t stretched in 21:9. I.e for me it’s the best version for ultrawide so far. 
---
I also saw this happen with the recipe for Mentats.
---
Not to mention the videos showing people crafting them but hey why believe what can easily be searched and viewes
---
#NO

I was a very early MMORPG player back when EQ first started and there were ALOT of bugs/glitches/bad quests/etc. A small time company called Verant Interactive started Everquest and Sony bought them out. I have played dozens of different MMO’s over the last 2 decades and this one although I agree some QoL things should have been instituted before they even released the game. Has been one of the better ones. Top 10 for sure. It keeps getting better as well as we have seen with the last 2 months of patches. I ignore most of the negativity because of “nerfs” lol that comes with all games like this. Time is what’s needed. in a couple months time this will be an even better game then it is now. 
---
They would have to move forward trying to balance additional end game content around people using TSE weapons. This would mean enemies would have massively increased health pools, meaning anyone without TSE weapons would have an infinitely harder time. 
---
By removing this future limitation they can balance future enemies with more normalized numbers. They can also focus on current enemy health, ammo crafting, perk balance, etc. 
---
TSE was a creative bottleneck. It was too strong and needed to go. Go pop some psycho and adapt. 
---
it is obvious,  100% agree
---
Didn’t read it, don’t care. Thanks for sharing.
---
Being a PM, it’s rarely the actual testers fault. When it is, its more a testing philosophy then anything, I think. Like testing separate functions one at a time and looking at “end-to-end” only at the very end, finding out that something breaks down the chain and wasting time with constant retesting. A lot of testing Frameworks(tm) can be shit like that. 
---
I stopped playing at abut lv70, when the duping started going nuts and people were seemingly one shoting queens. The patch before this looked good, and I thought this last one (skimming) was ok too, but reading posts and comments don’t make me want to come back yet... 
---
Disease cures are easy to make. Just go to Flatwoods and get the stuff. One trip up the river and you can collect enough to make a bunch of them, especially if you have Green Thumb and Chemist equipped. 
---
With my perk setup I'm down from 2/3 to 5/6 hits. Not terrible. Splash damage is way down.
---
I run all 3 autorifle cards, bloodless, demolition, armour piercing card, full Adreneline and glow sights vs ghouls 
---
Exactly. This isn't the kind of game that actually *has* an economy of any note.
---
Thank you for the clarity with games like this. I agree with this statement wholeheartedly. 
---
Can't argue there, but like from my standpoint with what I forsee myself doing in the future it doesn't really matter what they do with 76 at this point right, like I'm not going to buy any future fo unless it is a true return to form, regardless of what they do from here on out honestly, they've shit the bed so badly.  So were I'm running a business that fucked up and I think there's nothing I can actually realistically do to manage it, why do I sink more money in?  Back to my example of nms, who have, as far as I've been told done a hell of a lot, and the best they've really got out of it is going from being abhorred to being ignored that's like the best they can hope for, oof. 
---
So a one way comment means bad?
---
At least not in game. The dupers are cool with paypal
---
To be honest all patches are, are big update on debuffing everything. So I wouldn't be surprised if they did. I love this game with a passion but they seem to be taking out the only fun parts of the game left after every patch.
---
You could always server how a random event spawn point to get the skeleton trick or treater for the plans. But the mask and the witches hat doesn't appear in the crafting menu to even make them. Probably another issue that won't get fixed.
---
I totally understand, but fixing something at this point is extremely tricky. I don't know for sure, but I guess the sales are ... far from ideal. Fixing things takes time and resources, so money. But probably not much more money inflow is to be expected, so fixing things will cause a loss. But NOT fixing things will also cause a loss. So I guess now Bethesda is trying to fix what's absolutely necessary with the least resources possible. No amount of personal change will make it better if they have to do a job of 20 people with 2.  
---
The moral of the story is: don't ever publish a clearly unfinished game.
---
Entitlement
---
&gt; What if you turned down a lot of different cards because you *had* to pick certain ones just to counter annoying and stupid game mechanics
---
What if you didn't? No one HAD to pick any cards. It's all trade-offs.
---
Now that isn't to say that the game is balanced in its current state in terms of perk allocations and requirements for certain play styles and it can't do with some tweaking. 
---
However, given how diverse the different combinations and reasons/justifications for those combos, I hope that you can appreciate that someone is going to be unhappy about it for a legitimate reason.
---
We might be able to find that fair outcome that most people are happy with. We might just be given something and have to live with it. All I'm saying is that it's complicated to get to that "right" answer, as we've clearly demonstrated :)
---
bloodied 
---
 So glad my SO and I switched to PC, $80 for 2 copies of tricentennial where as I would have had to get a new Xbox and game just to join her. Figured the game would either fizzle out or I would get bored. Both happening at the moment.
---
Probably should submit a ticket see if they can eventually fix that, since having 40% of your budget gone forever is pretty game breaking for camps.
---
Yeah, all 9.9 players on H1Z1 holding out, like the few of us have been. Today is the first day I just didnt play. Normally I play a few hours a day. Sadly now I'm starting to side with the people who incessantly complain about a game they didnt play in the first place
---
...is not underpowered.
---
Try over-repairing it.
---
&gt; So the Two-Shot still gives the explosive bonus twice then?
---
&gt; I think the fix to the current state would be to raise the base damage of the explosive weapons. If they need to make crafting ammo more expensive, then fine,
---
Yes they need heavily buffed. No making the ammo more expensive isn't fine. They're already quite expensive to make in any usable amount.
---
Dark Souls.
---
Good job, you guys did nothing to curb the endless low-effort circle jerk posts that went on for months that got us to this state by blindly downplaying how dire the situation was, so now rage at a community that’s rightfully fed up with being let down.
---
When I started seeing posts fail to load and delete as I scrolled to read them I figured it was just an issue with my reddit app, but alas, it’s come to this.
---
For the record, I read about 3 of those deleted posts and they were anything but low effort, but hey, here we are.
---
That's not how the gaming industry nor layoffs work. 
---
You find someone from within with experience or you hire someone in from the outside. Possibly someone from zeni who led the ESO and turned it around or you hire someone from another company with MMO experince since it incorporates several functions of it. 
---
I seek a handmade rifle two shot or two shot + explosive, anyone?
---
Can you name any other game that arbitrarily limits how much money to can gain a day?
---
The only games that ive seen that have any such limits are mobile games that do it to get you to buy the game currency. I got an extra game key, should I make a new account and use it to get some extra farming in and transfer the caps?
---
I'm saying that I'm not fully judging it in its current state. As you point out, it's a game in progress. Like I said, I do enjoy parts of it, and I'm hoping some of what's being promised, however vaguely, will actually come to pass to improve those parts. If it would stop pretending that it will be all things to all players I could make a better informed decision along those lines.
---
Well given that context, then there's no reason for that room to exist in a public release.
---
You have actual stats on this mass exodus? Where do you get your figures from?
---
I was soloing blast zones in excavator and All-Rise unique super sledge with 1 strength, which meant no strength perks. 
---
Power Armor = 10 strength
---
All Rise = Easy Pickup
---
Blast Zone = End Game
---
Melee = No Ammo
---
Melee does great damage with 0 perks, it has the lowest upkeep cost because you just need glue and tin cans to keep your weapon repaired and you don't need anything else to be viable. 
---
You thought wrong.  They didn't cover anything regarding player vending or ways to sell plans back to vendors in today's patch notes.
---
I have a pair outside my camp by riverside manor.... makes me feel like I have some in game friends to play with.... they suck at defending the camp though.... 
---
Wow quality post you got here. Look at all those comments.
---
Okay but this is baseless conjecture between two redditors, one of which while still informed on the topic is not informed on the exact situation of the management. My point being we don’t know the full story. 
---
True, I am a fan of all the fallout games. (Including I and II made by a different company).
---
But the poster went overboard on the slander as well as went exaggeration on the comments. 
---
I recently bought Lord of the Rings: war in the north and while its a very fun game, I crash to desktop every 2-3 minutes.  I literally have to rely on pure luck just to make it to the next save point and continue in the game.  I struggled about 10 hours in game before I finally gave up.  I would consider *that* game as being incompetent if it were not like 6 years old.  
---
I have 300 hours into Fallout 76 and still have fun despite its flaws. I could play the game with friends.  (True multiplayer, not the wanna-be-multiplayer of NMS)
---
If nothing in his reply was relevant to what you said, then what you said was not relevant to the topic.
---
I'd say so.
---
The period where I was willing to give them the benefit of waiting for fixes and changes is over, plus the barrage of interesting games 2019 promised to bring has already started.  
---
All the patches until now were just stirring the pot in some sense, relatively minor things got fixed or changed, stability may be somewhat improved, but it has all the grave problems it had on launch still with no sign of them ever getting addressed.  
---
Well, don't be level 30 in hazmat suit and a level 20 sledgehammer for starters.. i see a lot of those ..
---
I'm a PA build and I've been managing my inventory, hoping that the day when I can move into my ultracite without being overencumbered comes sometime soon. Guess not.
---
Hit us with that TL;DR
---
Okay then, I see now. That’s the live service model these days I’m afraid. Appeal to all and satisfy none. Unsure if they will stray away or not at this point so I’ll be waiting just like you. 
---
True, either way someone is responsible for the lack of testing and all the crap though. That doesnt change.
---
Your build must be pretty bad.
---
At level 45 I can take out most beefy enemies with six or seven sneak attacks (all rifle perks plus sneak perks). Drop some points in luck, too - four leaf clover and GRS means you have constant crits and near always full AP. 
---
"Guys. GUYS."
---
"What, Todd?"
---
"Let's add a recipe for pizza in the game. Everyone loves pizza right?"
---
"Ok but if we do, let's add a chance to add lactose intolerance to every character generated. That way they can evacuate their bowels uncontrollably during combat"
---
"Ok. I'll make sure its buggy as hell to top that off. Great job guys"
---
The only people who are going to get scammed are the ones not willing to wait for a decent price. Serums were 5k at the vendors before and I can still buy them for 500 caps each from players or less if I shop around. 
---
It’s supply and demand as well. I really want a lvl 50 3* Instigating Combat sniper rifle with 10% aim and 90% weight reduction...would I pay more then 7k  caps for it ? Nope. 
---
I will either find one myself eventually or find it from someone who isn’t a rifle build. If people refuse to pay stupid prices they will go down. 
---
Yeah and honestly, everything I have bought has come from atoms that I obtained through grinding.   I have not purchased one single item with real world money. I've bought mostly power armor skins from the shop, but not a single one of them was paid for with real world money.
---
'Knocked Out The Fuck Out'? 
---
The downvotes means your actions are only slightly more popular than the last patch.
---
That's a thing ? Will give her a try got a solid 40% more speed +1 strength one
---
What other games? I'm pumped for Cyberpunk, but who knows if that's coming out this year.  
---
Mods insist they aren't paid by Bethesda to push a narrative but then censor posts critiquing it :thinking:
---
Out our curiosity what is this magical limit?
---
Fallout Scavenger: Inventory Management RNG Edition.
---
Good question....
---
I'm in a neverending loop of 3x L80 scorchbeasts, and L60+ protectrons attacking me near the Glassed Cavern since the game decided to crash on me as I was finishing a Brotherhood quest.  A bit frustrating...
---
True but what’s done is done. All we can do is pickup the pieces from here. Someone will or probably has already paid the price for the fuckups but at this point I think we can all agree we want a better game. I just don’t see replacing key members of the staff at a time when it seems like they are just starting to enact plans is the best thing to do at this moment in time. 
---
After yesterdays patch I can no longer play the game, it's suddenly running at an unplayable framerate and I have no idea why. So I'll wait till the next patch and hope it fixes things. (i5 6600k, 16gb Ram, Nvidia 1080)
---
I really like this game, it's fun with friends, but it's such a chore to play sometimes. Introducing new issues at this point just puts a big downer on it. Hope they get it together soon.
---
u have a serious mental problem kido.
---
Lol, they rollbacked to a previous buggy version. What the actual fuck?
---
As you get higher level, the things you have are much more valuable and cost more to build. Youll be alot less willing to give up your camp location when some of the repairs require you to drop a nuke or two just for mats.
---
My camp probably cost a few hundred wood and and steel and at least a hundred concrete, plus a bunch of crops, copper, and like 5-7 of each flux for the decon shower. Not to mention several hours of build time.
---
This just proves that Bethesda doesn't have a QA team to test the changes before they release them.
---
most likely this. They knew the game wasn't finished. All devs probably knew it wasn't fit to release. Guess who wanted to make the holiday season?
---
HaHA bolstering wood leg if you are lucky. Try troubleshooter’s pipe
---
I'd honestly hold out on both. 
---
The first Division was pretty bad. Enemies were bullet sponges of the highest order (read: two full mags of headshots to kill a single mook), gear was really imbalanced, most skills were useless, and the Dark Zone was a fucking joke. 
---
Anthem looks really good, I'll be honest, but... It's EA. 
---
Have your weapons repaired..
---
Wear powerarmor..
---
Have perks that prolong life on weapons..
---
Have perks that give bonus Damage..
---
Stay Alive The Hole fight .
---
Kill adds as Soon as you ser Them..
---
Launch the nuke South of dropsite v9 so you get less adds and dont fight in blastarea..
---
Saw a queen dropped in 10 min today. Done by a couple lvl 100+ and a handful of 40+. They must have gotten something right. 
---
Oh yeah, I saw T-51 Calibrated Shock plans at the Brotherhood vendor once at 1200 before the patch, now they are 5800.
---
I'm not shitting on CM's as their position is both very important and invaluable in an online game community. The Fallout 76 CM's have been particularly responsive. With that being said, I've seen tons of CMs saying "we'll make sure the development team gets your feedback" but with all due respect what does this actually mean...? Words mean nothing and actions mean everything to me as a consumer. To save time I'm not going to provide a bunch of examples (just look at the countless awesome suggestions on this Reddit daily) but much of our feedback never sees the light of day. Four months in and PvP servers and some procedural generated vaults is what you gathered from all the precious data your community managers have been gathering for you, Bethesda? Really...? People are leaving in droves (CM said she deleted something like 80 posts of people "leaving and complaining in a non-constructive way") for a reason and you can delete those posts until your blue in the face. But why should these players that are leaving stay to play your game? Why should I, someone who has stuck it throughout this entire shit storm, stay and play your game...? If you want words that matter, a road map is desperately needed. I feel it's owed to the players who have remained positive throughout the beta and post launch of Fallout 76 to know what our loyalty has earned us. Or don't... I'll play every day regardless. Because I love Fallout.
---
Serum and serum recipe prices are the same as they were before the patch.
---
There’s a treehouse not too far away with a computer where you can control everything lol
---
The Bull Barrel, even if not a bug, it's certainly an oversight, why wouldn't they include it, it's not even in the files.
---
The Commie Whacker, why add mods for the commie whacker (like the bladed mod) to the weapon if they know it won't be used by the players as a regular weapon?
---
The Paddle Ball, increase the weapon's damage, add the rest of the paddle ball mods from the Nuka-World, they're still in the files, just marked with ATX prefix so they'll be coming.
---
The Legendary Pipe Revolver, not obtainable.
---
Yeah that wasn’t turning out like you predicted at least until it crashed for me.
---
This is where I am coming from, it's not fair to make a player grind out a dozen levels to shift around special points just to get back to a similar level they were before. 
---
Some players have been hit hard and it's not fair for BGS to tell them to kick dirt like this. 
---
Then let those people quit. 
---
edited original post for your nitpicking pleasure.
---
Funnily enough, Bethesda already has a way to create delta patches for `.esm` files. They are `.esu` files that contain only the differences and they overload the main `.esm` file. And they work for all platforms. But they do not use them.
---
[Proposal to Bethesda] I know that your versioning scheme is 1.0.esm_version.exe_revision, but for the love of Mothman, use`.esu` to hotfix the `.esm` and when you are about to release the next `.esm` version, bundle them up and add them to it.
---
Added at the top, I know long winded, but there was a lot more to be explained on how Bethesda Games Austin was formed.
---
My favorite part is when I spend an hour farming mats to fix my guns, but break my guns while farming and use the mats I just found to fix them. Then I do it again! 
---
Don't forget the amount of caps that you have to spend to travel to all those vendors.  So you make 1400 caps minus fast travel cost so there is always that.
---
As mentioned, with Melee and the recent changes to White Knight, there's a big cost attached to armor repair, depending on the armor it might end up being more expensive than ammo costs. If you want to keep your options open, do a Strength/Agility build at first. Leave Endurance below 8, Charisma at 4, and decide what you want for the rest. With a STR/AGI you'll have the option to swap between Shotguns and Melee, not a rifle build, but still gives you quite a bit of the same options. You can always swap from STR to PER after level 50 if you want to.
---
With your particular story situation I can give you some insight to what's going on and how things will play out differently so you can find out what you want to do.
---
&gt; ...decided to try to stealth whitesprings... Most mobs are x3 levels over me...

This is common. Mobs in WS spawn in at the assigned level for the player that spawned them. Since WS is a big end game leveling locations you were probably fighting things spawned in by a level 60+ player that were not killed before you got there. If you go there when no one has been around you'll get the low level 15-20 golfer ghouls.
---
&gt; I used two, just two, special attacks followed by a very few small  swipes (guzzling stimpacks) against a giddamn crowned level 65 glowing  one and killed his ass straight-up. 
---
Ghouls have very low armor values. I haven't checked, but I assume it's between 0 and almost 0. I wouldn't try that shit against an equal level Super Mutant or mid level Rad Scorpions or Mirelarks. Ghouls all don't block melee attacks like Super Mutants and Mirelarks. Death means very little, so feel free to saunter up to the Grafton Steel Yard and see how you fair.
---
Another thing with Ghouls is that they do some radiation damage (more if they are glowing) so if you had rad resistance chems on you, you lost a bunch less HP than you normally would against things like Melee Molemen or Scortched of the same level.
---
&gt; That solitary 14 pound sword and a handful of stimpacks that can take down bosses 40 levels over you in ten seconds?   
---
Yes and no. Your situation was great for the tactics you ended up using. This is why people think End Game content is easy, those mobs they use to level are easy to kill if you're using the right tools. Also why people think Melee is op, it's not op, it's just effective against the current most commonly fought end game enemy versus things with no armor. 
---
Melee also gets a lot harder when you have 15 level 60-ish Super Mutants shooting at you, another 3 staggering you with power attacks, and one with a deathwish chasing you around with a Mini Nuke. Also keep in mind that Melee builds make it harder to do damage versus flying mobs like some insects, Scorched Beasts, and the Scorched Beast Queen. It suddenly not so easy to win when you're fighting something shooting at you from 40 feet in the air.  
---
In the end, most meta builds will work. If you want a sniper rifle build, build it. If you're having trouble with, ask. Simply take the good advice and downvote then ignore the people who answer things like, "Why not just melee?". Mostly, just enjoy the journey of building. Once you hit level 50 you can always begin to respec.
---
See thats the problem, you want everyone to see that you dont care but you fail to add anything to the conversation. You do realize that if most of the playerbase quits altogether then bethesda will abandon this game right?
---
I dont really think op is even referring to weapons. I think people are more mad at the nerfs that came to white knight and others. All white knight did was make the game less tedious and for some reason that's a bad thing. Why nerf something if it never negatively effects the player? 
---
Alrighty guys, I'm done playing for a while then. I don't think I read "become a play tester for free" anywhere in my terms of service when I bought this game for 60 USD. Better luck on your next title.
---
You are correct.   One poster commented to me that the nerfed TSE still provide 189% damage.   No other weapon/perk combination in game can do that.   Sure you can get close to that with drugs, low health, ect.  But a single weapon without ANY additional items/perks/mutations gives a straight up +89% more damage.
---
I got my money's worth, I had some great gaming moments a lot of fun. 
---
This is the first major rebalance patch and it shows how unprepared BGS is. They've essentially told a portion of their player base to go kick dirt and earn a dozen levels just to get back to similar level of viability they were before. 
---
even then, they were way overpowered.   +100% damage on each ability if they did not stack? That would be 300% damage.  
---
Give me ANYTHING in the game at all that would do that type of damage by itself?  One perk or one mutation or any other legendary item?   You really have to struggle combining several things before getting close to that type of damage.
---
One of the key problems with the chores thing is that it is covering up the lack of (new) content for ppl to engage in. Classic Fallout RPG content that is more than just go here and kill waves of enemies b/c a holotape said so.
---
I'm  with punda on this one.. i kill level 91 glowing deathclaws with two shots at their feet .. they die in 0,5 seconds.... Now it takes 2-3 seconds.. stop crying .. we needed this.
---
but for co-op they need make some content, like raids, insatnces new weapons or legendary effects. so in sum they need to work. but the sandbox pvp does not need any content. "its just work" sound good but...
---
Same here. I want to be excited for ES6 but I can’t anymore after how they’ve responded to their mistakes with 76. Even without all the outside bs like the canvas bags, the rum and the data leak, the game itself is the worst part of it all. 
---
It’s seems crazy to say, but I actually trust EA more these days than Bethesda. EA is honest with how blatantly greedy they are, but at least I know FIFA, NHL and Madden will be solid games every year that aren’t completely broken and the devs are quick to fix issues. 
---
I remember fighting my first queen.
---
Like 10 people maybe more.
---
At some point i was very low health and one dude pumped my ass cheeks full of lead with a shotty to finish me off. What a great experience that was. In the most cooperative thing we could do it didnt prevent him from being a prick.
---
Set up a cross-server auction house that functions like the one in World of Warcraft. 
---
This whole situation is like an income inequality demonstration, people without TSE are feeling sour, complaining how OP TSE weapons are and want them to be gone. However, making the money of the rich become worthless is not the solution, the poor will still go through hunger and hardships of life. WHY NOT GIVE EVERYONE A TSE? PROBLEM SOLVED!
---
Yea make that 4 people 
---
Because I quit the game 
---
Good post op, very valid points and a good opinion to back it up with.
---
Surprised a dev has commented on this one yet. 
---
Yeah thats what i was thinking. So on the one hand its reduced the amount of caps each person can individually farm, but on another it has increased caps for others on the server. Seems to be a balancing patch then.
---
Shame, as i think i have only found 4 caps stash's in my whole time playing so far lol
---
Sure but how do you know what ‘most of the player base’ is doing? Youtubers and reddit posters don’t necessarily make up the whole of fandom. 
---
You don’t need me to add anything to the conversation, you just want to whine.
---
I am happy they nerfed that.
---
On my char I have 15 Str, 9 cards for bonus damage, 3 for armor ignore and 3 for faster swinging (dont know the english names). The legendary 2 hand hammer from the Mayor for one day quests does with all this combined 272 damage.
---
I was really happy with that, i could 2 hit most mobs or 4~ hit the 68 super mutants...
---
and then I heard about freaking TSE with over 1000 damage and I kinda was thinking about quitting the game about it. Because if you specialize all your points into a certain specc and it does not even do a quarter of another spec due to weapon inbalance... then everyone has to do the other spec and the game becomes boring.
---
Dude, your settlers will still your stuff!
---
I’m a lone wanderer, so if I have someone in my team, it actually nerfs me. I only team if I have to. So I tend to reject all unexpected incoming team requests.
---
Sorry, could you explain?
---
&gt; Remember when “You have *contracted* dysentery” was endgame material on your travels *in West Virginia*?
---
Yes please.  co-signed.  Working with others to accomplish a goal is so much more fun than getting teabagged by a bored teenager.
---
That's why I sold it after the first month. I was actually really engaged in the story but was progressing at such a slow pace because of how tedious the game is designed to be. It pisses me off because it's all intentional to keep players playing - the fast weapon and armour breaking, the artificial carry weight limit to avoid you being able to repair weapons and armour by not letting you keep too much junk, the artificial vender caps limit that means you have to fast travel to many different vendors just to get any decent amount of caps. I gave this game every chance but when they nerfed Whitesprings Golf Course the only way I could efficiently progress the main story I just said fuck it and sold.
---
I nuked the queen for the first time today and the whole server showed up, had a blast, killed the queen after another player launched another nuke at her. probably one of the best moments in the game. got shit drops but that is the nature of the beast. still worth it since i launched the nuke myself.
---
I personally think these "low effort posts" you're trying to censor are very important. Bethesda needs to know how bad they fucked up. If it was completely up to them they would definitely not care enough to improve the game. They've grown fat and lazy from complacency of success. Things like this oughtta light a fire under their ass.
---
I have come to the conclusion Bethesda is doing this on purpose to contrast „how far they have come since fallout 76“ when the next Bethesda game title drops 
---
The keyword here is “low-effort” 
---
I’ve seen several posts already lamenting the changes made in this patch. These players took time to write down several paragraphs expressing their few. 
---
Not seeing a “censorship” problem here if the mods are removing 3-sentences-or-less whiners. These kinda of posts don’t exactly add to the conversation on how to make the game better. 
---
They still would need private servers for this as this is an online game.
---
If they change anything at the last minute they'll have to patch their patch notes. They'll be bug reports on things that were intended because they forgot to patch the patched patch notes. Suddenly people will be all like, "Bethesda please release patch note after the patch".
---
Thank you.
---
I never grief, plus those griefing were mainly stacking bobbleheads. 100+ in effect at once can one hit a SBQ, and of course can be used by the level 500+ who is running around in his underwear and messing with other players.
---
I grinded like hell to get my load out of weapons just to have youtubers and others get them nerfed.
---
"We will pass it along to the dev team"
---
This tells me they haven't even played the game they work on
---
I used a rifle/explosives build because i like tossing grenades out of no where and firing the occasional mini nuke from stealth. Build wasnt the best dmg i could get but it made the game fun for me. Took a pretty big hit today and my mini nuke launcher is probably going in a paper bag now. Took a lot of farming to have that drop, wasn't really looking for it but was happy to fire off nukes from stealth. Now im in a pretty big need of a change, which i guess gives me something to do
---
I agree with this 100%. 
---
I saw so many great ideas being thrown around during the beta and early release that would add new things and improve the game. People including me thought they’d listen and evolve the game, with new stuff being added regularly and they would work with their fan base. 
---
They didn’t add anything new and it’s basically the same as launch besides bug fixes and balance changes. They’re never going to regularly add to it and actually put effort in it. It was never designed to be that and it’s becoming more and more obvious. 
---
Like you said they’d have to completely change and rebuild the game. Sad part is we won’t get another fallout for 10+ years. 
---
LOL. Yeah that the answer, and then they should have increased all mob HP x 10000
---
Really, instead of bitching why don't you piss off and get a life.
---
Too true about these endless grind cycles and rng carrot and stick and loot boxes (for the games that have those kind of gacha things) that is meant to stimulate ppl's gambling addiction brain centers.  
---
You suck mothersucker
---
Lol some tag chosen pre release means so much. Just leave you rager, go back to fortnite
---
&gt;Lvl 40-60 Super Mutants at Harper's Ferry took at least three headshots each to drop. 
---
A single headshot with an instigating lever rifle, the stock 2x stealth bonus and fewer rifle damage perks than you have will easily kill a level 68 super mutant. Two-shot explosive is now a pretty poor sniper combo, as it probably should have been all along.
---
I do think they over-nerfed two-shot given the accuracy penalty though. +40 or 50% damage would be fairer.
---
Even better!
---
While real life has better graphics, I find the story-line more lack luster than Fallout 4.
---
Also the NPC are mean to me.
---
Tata
---
Yes. 
---
You'ree the only one.
---
Removing cap limit will mean Beth won't be able to make money from selling caps. This is a business strategy, you can get only 1,400 caps off vendors a day, to get more, you either have to trade with other players or buy them from the atom shop in the future.
---
After the update my playing style hasn't changed. My sniper rifle is the same. My black powder SSE has reduced by half, but is still highly effective. My SSE handmade doesn't seem a lot different, even though it's been drastically reduced as well. I don't know what all the fuss is about. TSE must still be highly lethal.
---
Guys don't let people downvote this please!
---
I've never seen them censor low effort posts saying "Whiners bad, YouTubers bad, game good, Bethesda good"
---
Definitely not the case before the patch, at least on Xbox. Now it's hugely annoying and time-consuming.
---
Yep. I launched what, I can only imagine, must have been an 800-cell ion cannon blast into some trees by accident. 
---
I’ve heard directly behind the golf club is VERY popular and a good place to set up. Make sure to set up tons of turrets too. /s
---
Seriously though, find a junk node, plop your camp down on it, and stay put. Come back every so often to collect. 
---
I never knew we even had those mats to begin with
---
You're just making shit up.
---
After you ruined the TSE guns I won't be playing 76 for awhile. Time to play Red Dead Redemption. I'm starting to hate Bethesda.
---
First, I hate VATS in f76 and I barely use it, so my build is not utilizing any skills with crits and VATS. Second, I was talking about real bullet-sponges like SB and SBQ - most weapons will do nothing or almost nothing if you change them for prime receiver. 
---
Good, I've almost finished a game (from my solo-play point of view - done all quests, all events and dailies at least once, have more than 300h and 129 lvl, nice CAMP) and with no new content on the horizon I just quit. I bought the game for ~6$ so it gave enough entertaining for the price, now time to visit Wild West in RDR2...
---
Yep, 900 hours, all time to learn how to mod radiums and today I'm not sure I even want to play the game :/
---
Nice! I’ll give it a full read later. Thanks for the info! 
---
Bobbleheads never could kill in pvp, even through pacifist mode.
---
ok i'll find one and show you how to use it
---
Same goes for similar weapons.
---
If do visible chunks against a SBQ. I prefer the drill and flaming chainsaw because the ripper does need to be "revved up" if you're staggered, and you will be staggered if she aggros on you. (The drill is much less effected by this, and the chainsaw more noticeably disengages so that you can resume your attack sooner, with less time wasted.)
---
and your armor breaks faster plus with the white knight nerf you need more ballistic fibre now, what a double whammy!
---
It only applies the items that have to be manually scrapped (which unfortunately includes bulk).  Regular items should be unaffected by it. This was to fix the issue of quest items being auto-scrapped, like the ignition cores for the RockHound or the damaged mainframe cores from the silos. 
---
That is a more accurate title. Had they given it a title like that, I don't think the backlash would have been as severe. The title sounds like a tedious grindfest. 
---
Yep had the same experience. Dunno about the whining, but it’s more annoying than the actual nerfs in the game.
---
I’ve been dropping a food item or something of small value as a “thank you” and promptly leaving the team. Didn’t think about joining a team nerfing certain character builds... that’s definitely a valid reservation. 
---
In rough order of release, from January to March:
---
Ace Combat  7
---
Battlefleet Gothic 2
---
Resident Evil 2 Remake
---
Metro Exodus
---
Devil May Cry 5 (although this one isn't really my cup of tea)
---
Sekiro
---
The Sinking City
---
Plus Phoenix Point in June and Atomic Heart looks interesting with a purported 2019 release date.
---
Don't blame the industry.  Bethesda has a terrible track record for screwing over it's customers.  I agree that the industry is bad right now; anti-consumer practises like lootboxes and season passes are detrimental to the industry, but Bethesda has been anti-consumer since they popularised micro-transactions with horse armour. When you shift blame and scapegoat the industry you stop holding Bethesda responsible and you give them a free pass to walk all over you again
---
I bulked everything as well and its a GAME Breaking Glitch!!! So many hour of material farming, and now I start from the beginning! Cant repair my PA or weapons or craft Items for my camp, its pretty sad. 
---
It'd be easier to say which weapons don't need buffs.  Every weapon with low damage-per-hit or split damage types (some combination of dam/eng/rad) is underperforming because they were clearly balanced without consideration for how badly the resistance formula punishes low damage-per-hit.  Have a dev take a few minutes to compare base guns against a target with 300 dam/eng/rad resists versus 0 and see how vast the difference becomes in DPS.
---
High damage-per-hit penetrates resistances better than low damage-per-hit weapons.  Energy and radiation resistance are not affected by most (possibly any?) forms of penetration as well which is why energy weapons are probably in the worst shape, but they're not alone.  Pistols, for example, completely lack a penetration perk and have relatively low damage-per-shot.  Heavy weapons like the minigun have some of the lowest damage-per-shot in the game due to their fire rates and suffer greatly for it.  The radium rifle's low and split-type damage hurts it in a similar way.
---
This isn't just guns.  Melee weapons with very fast attack speed suffer possibly worse than energy weapons as a consequence of the resistance formula due to their severely low damage-per-hit (the bizarre over-repair interaction notwithstanding).  Similarly, any melee weapon with low damage-per-hit for its attack speed category can be considered relatively weak.
---
Oh damn that's going to get tedious real fast. This is gonna sound a bit mean but I hope this is happening to a lot of people so they fix it fast(er).
---
My fancy-ass hunting lodge-style house now has an Unstoppables bed and stash box and I love it.
---
It does say in the first link I posted that making Fallout 76 wouldn’t have been possible without annexing Battlecry Studios after their game failed, they probably gave them the code to Fallout 4 along with the dev room in the same place and told them to start building the game from there. 
---
Now THAT is backstabbing. I've grinded just to find out that the ultracite power armour plans are free? rubbish.
---
Do you still have to get mod plans from the sbq tho?
---
Far Cry ~~76~~ New Dawn   Post nuclear-apocalyptic setting in the beautiful landscape of hope county , montana with  mutated wildlife unlimited amounts of ~~raiders~~ road warriors to murder, ~~workshops and camps ~~base building , weapon crafting , a huge world to explore ... you can play it with a friend (if you have any)....  
---
attach a wire from your power source to the switch box. then put a pressure plate down, hook that up to the power source and to the middle of the door. boom, you can now open the door temporarily from the outside using the keypad and open the door temporarily from the inside via the pressure plate
---
It really does seem that this patch was based on an older version of the codebase than than the last patches and as a result has rolled back a lot of the changes made. That and nerfing the game too hard has me with zero interest in playing until this mess is resolved.
---
Agreed, but it would make them usable as for the tougher battles.  Not like using them as primary weapon.   
---
But they really need buffed.
---
Yep, I'm not hunting for an instigating rifle.  I was looking for one pre-patch as a better option to the wildly inaccurate 2-shot, but as you probably know legendary farming and getting something you can actually use is like winning the lottery.  I get all the instigating melee weapons and heavy guns I could every want, but landing a useful pipe/hunting/lever rifle is semi-mythical.
---
They were selling for like £3 so I don't think anyone will be filing for bankruptcy, that's less than almost any item in the atom shop and they're still probably the best gun even after nerf. Although I tend to prefer instigating for my sniper build anyway
---
This is what happens when you don't have a single person on the dev team who actually plays the game...
---
&gt; how long until people stop complaining 
---
I assume in a week or so because they stop playing fallout 76 and don’t read and write on reddit 
---
So you’re telling me is that there is someone watching me while I’m exploring the campsite? 🤔
---
Yeah, we know. 
---
If you make a map with every stash on it you could make enough caps to last you a long while. As they are not shared between the players you can guarantee you get caps from them once a day.
---
two shot weapons. because it was a mistake to nerf them. the problem was the explosive part. 
---
but a short list:
---
\-plasma rifle
---
\-laser rifle
---
\-flamethrowler brake so fast and the amo is prety expensive to craft probably becuase mistype in config file. u make 9 istenad 90 at once-
---
\-lmg use .308 amo instead 5.55 or 5mm when .308 for riofles and cant craft it in huge mount what needed to use this gun. i need chage the caliber but the .308 crafitng to heavy weapon levels.
---
\- 40mm grenades too heavy u can carry enough amount to solo sbq. 
---
The other games offer free respec or other ways to quickly respec your character in certain situations where patches nerf skills or builds. F76 offers none of this. If your character gets nerfed to the ground you have to grind for hours to be a able to respec with no guarantee you won't have to do it again later. This is the reason you are getting down voted, you simply can't understand the difference between those other games and F76
---
It is so damn sad that a person with poor aim cannot be able to complete the AMS quest.   
---
4x i have died so i give up..  
---
I wish therr was a way to DELETE the quest: recover pipe from ams corporate headquarters
---
Nah you can set it on autorun 
---
He's only the best videojame player ever 
---
It'd be fine after February 22 because that's when Anthem comes out lol. They'll have plenty of easy time to fix stuff when a lot of people migrate to anthem
---
Can we get a hotfix for being stuck in a scope view for 50+ seconds? 
---
He and his  only friend  stopped playing ( atleast he wants us to believe this, its actually his younger brother ) = mass exodus .
---
Yes. Mod plans are still queen only drops. 
---
btw if only you put half that effort into your game, they wouldn't be leaving.
---
I've gotten one from full to about 20% with a TSE the dragon from sneak with full sniper build. Barely scratched the queen though
---
&gt; I don’t think that it’s because I am playing the game “wrong” I just probably play the game different than you do, 
---
Maybe you are trying to play the game in a different way but it really allows you to play it one way. Hence your frustration, which is completely justified lol.
---
And here you are calling for change. Wake up. 
---
I've gotten tons of legendarily out of WS as you described since probably the 14th patch. Just one solo run into the Golf Club (just that building) has given me 4-6 every single time then another 3-5 doing the loop. Each loop takes 5-10 minutes, so server hoping for an hour, yeah, 40-60 per hour seems about right if people kept loading in and spawning more.
---
I always server hop after 1 lap so I always drop my stuff in the register at Artisan's Corner in the hotel instead of the icebox.
---
**Insert melee players comment saying melee is not broken here**
---
Yeah, mods are still queeno
---
No Class Freak fix I see. Bummer. 
---
Fantastic.
---
Yeah I’m amazed by the number of ‘feelfacts’ that get touted around on this sub, vs actual ‘facts’.
---
Still hold to this approach or have you admitted that there is a big difference between writing a term paper in an hour and coordinating 400 people in fixed thousands of issues in 30 gigabits worth of coding. Games take years tonmake and still come off as buggy piles of crap becuase writing a term paper the night before it's due and building a complex gameworld are two vastly different things
---
There is a spot near vault 76, that has steel and copper resources, the reason it is on a ledge, and has resources.
---
Get rid of some of the legendaries FCS! You're just making life difficult for yourself. Or just don't play anymore.
---
&gt; sledgehammer for starters.. i see a lot of those ..
---
Oh, you mean those who tag the queen and go on afk at the barn?
---
Melee isn't broken. To get really high melee damage you have to have like 5 health, and get one shotted all the time from just about everything.
---
It's not even bloodied and isn't affected by almost any perks like my rifle is.
---
For some reason Bobby Pin's now have its old weight back of 0.1, (if was fixed last patch down to 0.001 if I recall correct, but that seems to be reverted)
---
Some mutations are getting a bigger buff than before the patch from "Strange in numbers", like jump heights of marsupial and Herd mentality has its bonus upped from +3 to +4
---
To be honest, this whole "let the community fix it" mentality surrounding Bethesda games is what led to 76's mess so I'd rather hold Bethesda responsible and force them to improve. It's because of that mentality that they became even more complacent than they originally were and attempted to take advantage of consumers over and over again.  The harder 76 fails and the later it gets mod support,  the better. Mod support makes Bethesda games successful and builds goodwill, we need to let Bethesda take off the training wheels and actually learn proper game design.
---
I'd probably also guess like a week before people are over it. 
---
I bet most people who say they're leaving will be back by then also.
---
if u can buy it for 8-10$ and u can make a questline with 8-10hours gameplay.. its 1$/hour fun.
---
That sounds annoying! 
---
well i regret clicking this at work
---
Explosive and two shot was overpowered tho. Separately they were good. Together was just outrageous. Although they nerfed the 2 effects individually too much. I have an explosive plasma Gatling and it barely does anything now compared to before.
---
Thankfully bloodied weapons are still amazing
---
All I've got to say is that I don't like how when you're crafting it doesn't automatically take from your bulk supplies now. I've got like 28 bulked plastic but it's only marking it at 7 because that's all I've got in spare. I keep having to go to the stash box, grab my bulk and take it with me, then put the bulk away, like, what gives? 
---
Ever since today’s patch, components are not registered if they are in bulk. For example I had a ton of copper bulked but it would not register as me having the ingredients until I manually scrapped the bulk copper back into individual. Only then could I build the power connectors 
---
Tried getting out of your power armor?
---
Good post
---
How to fix a game 101: hire a well known modder,
---
1. Knows the game and what could make it better
---
2. Loves the game and is willing to put in the work for others free of coast
---
That's what I was thinking. Since nobody is fighting over them anymore
---
I agree.
---
Came here to post this.
---
Not sure on the reset but I agree. I have a list of where the ones I found are. Didn’t have time today, but I hope to make a killing tomorrow. 
---
At least the majority of the posts got removed by now
---
&gt;  rng carrot and stick
---
Yeah, and you never really catch the carrot. 
---
There's a handful of mods that simply do not drop, and the only evidence that they even exist are claims on reddit. 
---
I have never actually seen anyone with them in the game (e.g. T51b jet pack). 
---
Melee damage gets increased on strength, the antiarmor capabilities are nuts, the park options are some of the best next to shotgun. Damage output is too high as the claim was TSE was a problem for one shooting things. 
---
they need only our money.. third world mentality...
---
I previously unbulked all my stuff in my stash so I spent my time in oblivion about this whole crafting issue until I went on reddit today and saw I had a message explaining it. 
---
And here I thought things were looking up. RIP FO76.
---
And thank fuck for that.
---
Why dont they just give a borderlands style option, where you can pay caps/atoms for a re-spec? Could cost more the higher level you are (more SPECIAL points you have to re-spec).
---
That's why we need to keep this post upvoted! No one is seeing the toxicity of this community, no one accepts any kind of criticism around this game, even when it's supposed to help the developers to see where they made mistakes so as to improve their own game
---
I tried to say this and was twice rejected 
---
Why is Beth doing this to us? I feel so mentally abused. They gave us what we want and then take them away later.
---
If you're a PC player grab the Perk LoadOut mod, it helps a ton and is kind of op if you want to have multiple combat builds.
---
Disconnects are hit or miss. I almost never get them, some people claim to get 20 in a day.
---
I would just jump in and see if things are to your liking yet. If you have the time to test it out, may as well get some use out of something you paid for.
---
So ?
---
You have it ?
---
I'd be willing to buy it for a good price
---
I noticed it too. I didn’t stutter or crash during my vendor runs.
---
I really dont get this argument of lack of new content, its only been three months since release, I dont feel the need for any new content as of yet as i am still working my way thru the main content (obviously other peoples experiences will differ, but ive seen this same argument happen since literally the first month). 
---
As for their plan, people can only guess and assume at this time. Which is what they will do. The only people who will be able to answer are Bethesda, and they will not.
---
Ok, so are ultracite pa plans still obtainable from sbq? If not, does that mean higher chance of mod plan?
---
Usually he’s playing and talking about it by now....
---
On the bright side, I can stop having "Fortune Finder" equipped, now that it only alerts me to stashes with zero to one caps in them.
---
the physical copies of this game removed form shops after a month of start... u can buy it for 8-10$ instead 200...
---
Not sure why they nerfed white knight they said it was too essential yea it is because ballistic fiber is a pain in the ass to find ive never given any away but just collected it naturally i have 120 in my stash, and ive never used any until i recently started repairing and using legendary armour... why  not buff the other perks. Im really starting to belief they are just nerfing these things to increase the grind just for the sake of extending the game because there is no content.
---
As a melee you also have to be standing right next to your opponent. Firearms have the advantage of range, and stealth which can increase damage a further 2.5 times.
---
Nobody wants new content in a game that many deem unplayable. How can you play new content if you call the game unplayable lol. That's what enough people are saying
---
This sub is doing a pretty good job blaming the devs since the latest patch lol
---
This bored my dick off, I did not like this post. 
---
Please no..
---
Glowing pustules?
---
Low stash is to reduce lag
---
You can get down voted all day but the fact remains that you're right... The current post asking for a change in leadership has no comment from a CM nor will it ever.
---
What’s your source on the physical copies (hint - it didn’t happen).
---
Oh yeah I forgot about the pitchfork. Apparently it has a flaming mod which might look cool.
---
&gt;many of us would gladly help Test builds 
---
Aren’t we already doing so?
---
From my understanding we are not „paid“ beta testers but „paying“ beta testers...?
---
See, opinionated and divisive, yet, beautiful unique snowflakes. Couldn’t do it without ya, friend.
---
Jfc how is it that my normal lever action rifle with a tuned receiver is stronger than my tse handmade ???? TSE wasn’t nerfed they were straight up shitted on smh
---
LOL the part about stripping down naked and drugs got me
---
RNG means "Random Number Generator," but in my experience, it isn't random. Some items appear regularly, and some simply do not appear at all.  
---
Beth, just give us our private servers already, so i can mod the bad out of this game.
---
You really think their goal is to get people to to pay $8 for a whopping  +60 max hp? That's a lot of money and coordination just for a joke/novelty buff.  If you happen to get jumped by a film squad of super heroes... you can get +95 max hp by eating some psychobuff and a hot dog!
---
I got that outfit and didn’t even think of this until you posted. Im glad you did
---
I believe they have not touched the Queen st all this patch. 
---
So her drops are the same. 
---
The Bethesda reddit person said the dev team will look into tje Queen at a later date. 
---
So she still rarely drops ultracite mod plans, or decent legendaries. 
---
She still regularly drops ultracite arms, legs, helm, chest plans, which are now worth nothing. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to respond, I sent you a direct message back in response to your other messages.  I hope some of the other people in this thread who've had similar issues with tickets can get some resolution as well.
---
Thanks Wastelander, here’s to discussing Fallout over better circumstances in the future.
---
It's a deathclaw. They make an earthquake when you get in range of them.
---
You can test at deathclaw island, or the thunder substation just north of watoga.
---
well go to any shop and try buy it. 
---
Or if Bethesda just goes bankrupt, that'd be ok, too.
---
Can confirm, extractor no longer gives 3/hr
---
can Aussies get in on this class action?
---
Seconded. Maybe we could only play in small intervals so we couldn’t discover all it’s problems. 
---
&gt;Go pop some psycho and adapt
---
i already have a melee char with a bloodied grognak axe with swing
---
If they had made explosive bullets simply uneffected by any perks or buffs the guns themselves would’ve done rreasonable damage without being one shot Queen killers. Two-Shot could’ve done decent damage and my guns wouldn’t feel like everything is a sponge
---
Yeah, having non-wanted player's bases destroyable by other players was a poor design choice. It serves literally no other purpose than to just grief a player.
---
And a hotkey to toggle pacifist would be great.
---
&gt; Exploit: Addressed an exploit that could allow players to duplicate items using MODUS Vendors.
---
This this why it says "Vendor is busy" when you try to use any terminal other than the middle one now?
---
Realistically the time it takes to really find enough materials to repair a piece of armor to 100% or above is Legitimately only a few minutes. If it's such a problem, then learn the best places or ways to replace materials fast.
---
OR just play in excavator all the time lol. Get the carry weight and with power patcher, it lasts so long that you could repair 3 times with the stuff you find by the time it breaks
---
cool
---
Crippling depression caused by the lack of difference between beta and release ?
---
No, I start thinking about second character.
---
Neither two shot nor explosive on its own was OP. It was the combination of the two on one weapon, with the perks. 
---
Two shot weapons are trash now. Unless youre well within shotgun range, one of the projectiles usually misses. That makes the gun a 0.625 shot. A three star two shot .44 used to one shot level 5 super mutants, and rightfully so. It has 10% damage buff while aimed/scoped and also has faster movement speed while aimed/scoped. It sometimes takes 3-4 shots to kill a level 5, and its a level 50 gun. Thats trash. Im not asking to one shot everything here, but a level 5 should drop to a level 50 gun like that in one shot. The two shot .50 cal I had already felt weak due to the absurd accuracy penalty; it sprayed bullets everywhere like a garden hose with holes poked in it. Now its twice as bad. I was hosing down Colonel Gutsys last night and it felt like it took 200 rounds to take one down. The difference between the 2 Shot Level 50 .50 Cal ((with 25% faster fire rate) and the Explosive .50 Cal is night and day. Two shot is trash, and Explosive feels great.  
---
On the other hand, none of my explosive weapons feel weaker. In fact, they feel stringer in that I can not blast Ghouls and Glowing Ones right in the face point blank and barely scratch my HP.  Theres a plus; but it also reflects that the nerfs did not accomplish what was intended. Instead of bringing TSE guns in line, it ruined TS guns and didnt really seem to affect Explosive guns much at all. Explosive builds were hurt, but I wasnt playing one so I really dont notice a difference. It takes the same amount of shots to drop Level 62 Ghouls at Whitespring as it did before. Except now I can do it point blank, with no down side to the gun. Thats a buff in my eyes.

The primary tip there is that a Respec might be in order. Which I can't  say. No one even talks about the endangerol syringer. 
---
he aint wrong
---
" i need chage the caliber but the .308 crafitng to heavy weapon levels. "
---
\* need to chage the caliber or the .308 amo crafitng to amo of heavy weapon levels. "
---
Fair enough man 
---
No, seriously, what’s your source? Is it one dude? Is it the same dude everyone quotes? The guy in Aus? The one the game shop itself already debunked? C’mon, don’t be so lazy.
---
Yes it’s till like that.
---
So the assumption is everyone uses that perk?
---
I agree that one handed melee and unarmed builds could use a little extra hot sauce.  I can't remember the last time I saw a pistol build.  The pistol build perk loadout seems awful, or at least clearly outshined by other builds.  I felt like Bethesda went a bit heavy on the spice for two handed melee and shotguns (so many great perks) and left a bunch of other playstyles either unchanged or underpowered in comparison to Fo4.  (I played a stealth rifleman or archer in all Fallout/Elder Scrolls games and have no desire to charge around in heavy armor.  I also play rogues in DnD.  Being bulky and strong has no appeal to me.)
---
Sorry OP, but I think you actually mean:
---
&gt;I can’t defend Bethesda anymore 
---
I too love the brand Fallout and I still do - but Bethesda is milking that brand dry now. I just hope they sell the franchise to someone more worthy after they are done with fallout 76
---
Was looking for this, unless your game is in a Beta state (Fortnite for instance) it costs quite a bit of money to update on console. PC is free for several reasons. It’s the reason why they only do major patches with lots of fixes.
---
Melee requires no ammo, so do you not only need less resources, you have less inventory management.
---
Problem is, a lot of people were using two shot weapons and not explosive builds that relied on TSE. I dont have any TSE weapons and this balance patch was trash. It wrecked more than it fixed. 
---
Best burn of the century. This is why I still visit this subreddit, even though I stopped playing this POS game in December lol.
---
theres already videos on youtube showing the dupe glitch is back lol 
---
Bro my spiked wood board does more dmg now than the mini nuke launcher i had. I didnt use all the perks to make to stronger but seriously, wood board with a few spikes&gt;mini nuclear explosion= broken af. You have lost your mind on this one
---
"I have bad gear and no clue. Queen won't budge. Boohoo it's not fair" 
---
It sounds like PS4 bots are using the same math used when increasing their cap stash after you buy something from them. There's like a 30% diminishing returns adjustment on caps paid vs. caps left on vendor when you buy something, might also be working on selling.
---
Which nerfed perks are you referring to that made repair costs less tedious?
---
Yeah. Mistakes were made. Sorry. 
---
I think you might enjoy the new Black Ops more. 
---
Yeah for real
---
You know it’s supposed to be a game about surviving in a hostile environment, right? It’s not supposed to be easy? It requires some thought, planning and strategy to balance all the elements - weapons, armour, junk, stash size, etc?
---
It’s not a game about collecting the most caps and having the biggest gun.. 
---
Maybe this game is just too hard for you. Maybe play something else.
---
Would you be interested in selling the anti armor one? Bwahaha just a souless survivor trying to aquire a lively weapon. Great job, I know how hard it is (gotten through scrapping almost 40 and hardly unlocked a couple attachments)
---
Pretty much.
---
I feel like they are just gonna go through and nerf melee and bloodied as well, personally i feel like there is no point in grinding for something if they just gonna nerf it into the ground. Tse needed a small or medium nerf not this dumpstering
---
Sounds like you were near Alpine River Cabins. Go there and follow the noise(you'll know it when you hear it) and it will lead you to the source.
---
It's broken, at least perk that signal near cap stashes - it keeps beeping even if you cleared that stash few minutes ago...
---
As of now if you want a 60% Buff on damage to guns, you need to use 9 points. Making it a single card with a max of 5 points is far more reasonable. 
---
I’m guessing the reason for the stacking perk cards was to level gate them in the simplest way they could come up with. Having new cards unlock at a higher level is easier than making different levels of a card unlock at levels. 
---
I play tons of mobile, collection, and clicker games. This game is barely manipulative. Let me fix this for you:
---
"**Does the incompetence of Fallout 76 game designers bother anyone else?**"
---
i agree w this. its getting old real quick. i think if they did away with weapons having to be fixed- it would ease some of the pain. i know i wouldnt miss it..
---
The problem is not that they don't make EVERYONE happy, the problem is that with each patch they are changing things to make it more tedious and grindier, thus alienating 90% of their players....
---
Exactly.  Well said.
---
If you've ever one shotted the SBQ, your build must be 1000x better than mine.  The best I ever did was actually seeing a sliver of her health drop with a 3.5x sneak attack and displayed 800+ dam pipe rifle when I was the first to arrive on the scene during my team-mates nuke drop.  I barely scratched her with a 2800+ hit and I was the only one there.
---
Didn't read. Totally agree.
---
K, bye 
---
Potted plants take almost no budget at all lmao. 
---
Go upload the image here instead [https://imgur.com/](https://imgur.com/)
---
You're trying to link to an image in a private Facebook group that is invite only.
---
I just made a whole post for it if you’d like to rant there lol
---
I don't know how long I've been playing because there's no 7600 hour achievement on Xbox and no discernible way to check gameplay time but I'm guessing 300 hours and I'm lvl 98.  I've never farmed just play a lot.
---
Some dork ? And you are... ?
---
I have to agree with your sentiments. I still play this game and enjoy much of the potential it has. The biggest problem is that the game is so out of balance from the start that it forced players to compensate with crazy powerful perks and weapons just to avoid getting slaughtered.
---
The main focus of these patches seems to send players down the rabbit hole even further by nerfing perks and weapons but doing nothing about the over powerful creatures kicking our asses. Had Bethesda actually taken the time to review and play test this game in detail, they would have scrapped many of the crazy balance killing problems from the start. It will always be easier to add into a game new weapons and loot instead of taking them away from players after the fact.
---
I’m level 7 so things still look peachy... most of the complaints about the game aren’t factors for me yet, but I sympathize with everyone who got screwed. 
---
I hate your affectations. Most of your words are bullshit and fluff. It's all good though. I'm sure you're a nice guy.
---
So they say. I could see that for unique items like guns, but there’s no reason stacks of bulked material or base junk items should cause lag regardless of how high they’re stacked. 
---
A tell bethesda why i personally decided to leave and what id like to see changed if theyd like me to revisit their game (third time ive explained this to you btw)
---
B i asked others to include others so the post has a higher chance of gaining traction and views
---
&gt;Am I going to read another patch in the future nerfing everything melee too then?
---
Yes you are. You totally are.  
---
They will announce that Melee is nerfed "to align with other type of weapons", cause actually "all weapons were supposed to work like plasma gatling, so we also fixed the durability issue of all non-energy weapons, since they were almost indestructible".  
---
However, when they'll deploy that patch they'll also remove the ground's texture and colliders so the game won't be playable, and the fixing patch will have bobby pins as a weapon.   
---
Then probably we will all spawn as butlers in Whitesprins and they will announce "Fallout : 94" for the new vault to open.
---
The more we forget about Mass Effect Andromeda the better 
---
You're doing it wrong if you HAVE to spend that much time doing it. Don't blame the game blame the players for not knowing how to play. Or blame them for knowing how to cheat the game
---
Like with 2 perks, my weapons take forever to degrade because I repair them to 200% and my excavator armor takes forever to degrade because of power patcher. Chemist and super duper give me all the stimpaks I need. Effectively letting me play for long periods of time without really the need to gather things as I frequently already just do it whole I'm out and about.
---
I mean sure sometimes I want to restock on stimpaks but with butcher's bounty and a free fast travel back to vault 76 and a few server hops, I'm back up to like 100 stimpaks
---
Thought it may be a hard choice whether to try the new patch out last night to see how bad the nerfs where or to play Kingdom Hearts. Suffice to say after crashing from the first fast travel after speding 20 minutes sorting out my inventory because bobby pins aren't working again I turned it off and went on KH3. Best decision ever.
---
I still hold out they may resolve this game but the way the devs are treating an MMORPG "supposedly" is completely backwards. Yeah lets nerf anything that's viable and make our game even more boring. Only way to play if they go down this route is to rebuild your character every time they decide to go batshit crazy with nerfs. 10% would be an acceptable change, 75% eh?
---
Also remember this is a soft core survival game. This is what you do in survival games. Chores. 
---
Did not check it. But i would be happy if this is true!
---
Well said. I have trouble believing they even play test their fixes. 
---
I can’t speak to armor perk nerf, but there is no way anyone on staff uses regular explosive weapons like the rocket launcher. They already under powered and they were just rendered useless with the Demo nerf. 
---
You make a strong counterargument. No rebuttal at this time.
---
Microsoft, for obsidian, in a heartbeat. They will never sell it though.
---
&gt;The only people who will be able to answer are Bethesda, and they will not.
---
No, they can’t, because they don’t know yet either. 
---
Plus sprinting between targets, and the constant threat of disease unless you 3* vaccinated. And forget about fighting flying enemies. Yeah melee’s got some powerful perks but it’s evened out by the gameplay
---
Yep, most games they buff stuff, here all they do is nerfing things into oblivion. Time to "put the game on the shelf" and play something else.
---
Shills will be shills.  
---
I've been playing since day 1 , but I'd be perfectly okay with a one-two month blackout on this game and a server wipe if it meant it comes back unbugged, with working features and a real balance.   
---
But I have more chances to see Todd come here, give an apology and say they'll refund everyone.
---
Don’t know if you ever played modded FO4 but why don’t they just do what Survival Options does? Increase the outgoing and incoming damage multipliers that way all guns do a little more damage but enemies also do more damage. I hated the bullets sponges in 76 and it’s a big reason I stopped playing. 
---
Actually ZeniMax published eso and runs it. Bethesda just kinda does what ZeniMax tells me
---
Bethesda is doing 76 all alone without big daddy ZeniMax helping them out
---
Spending more on servers while increasing stash would improve that lag. The way it is now is ridiculous.
---
When is Bethesda going to fix the ability to dupe time. It's really unfair to us legit players who just want a fair game when other people can just duplicate their time and play more. I even see people selling their duped time on eBay for like hundreds of dollars. #BlameTodd
---
As long as you don't tell players they'll be able to keep their progression, maybe.
---
Just repaired my excavator power armour legs with like 4 springs each. That is with the appropriate perks, but it still used to require over 20 each
---
actualy i fixed this for mayself:
---
1. made a camp at lead node.
---
2. use gaus and tesla rifle
---
3. run in x01 pa, never need to repair
---
4. scrap all weapons what i got for steel and plastic
---
5. at base craft them all always to 2mm and fusion cells
---
6. because battery perk almost no weigh of the amo
---
the real porblems:
---
1. i hate pa but to keep up regular armor need a shitload balistic fiber what mean a shitload farm with serverhopping
---
2. when i got any usefull legendary over 2 star what i want to keep "because i really sure sometimes i will use it" (never) i have to go to may mule toon... and in this patch they destroyed this mule system without offered any solution liek bank system or something. they ar arogant idiots and work verry hard to destroy this game completly.
---
Yeah I agree, at least till they put some good work into it.
---
Is still fun, despite its flaws and derpy development, and has loads of potential. 
---
To be honest i do not thint they count!
---
Yesterday was playing and saw 2 players, a lv85 and a 35, probabily friends, they attacked me, i shot them and took all the loot, they come back and start doing splash dmg on me, i had no intention of answering fire this time, they had too much junk to lose, was walking away with them in front of my face when unstable isotope went off.
---
There was a split second with my "oh shit" but pvp never engaged 
---
Agree. This is a very serious problem and never should have happened. 
---
You can already do this for free when you level up post 50...?eventuslly you'll have every single perk maxed out in game. Why are people freaking out like babies. 
---
Mfw this game turns into Skyrim
---
Mfe Todd does it again
---
Imagine the shit storm of additional problems we'd have if they attempted to rework the code so the explosive affix did a little less damage and wasn't scaled by the demolitions expert perk.
---
I'm sure if they did, we'd somehow have ghouls using the scorchbeast attack pattern of flying and "non-stop blinding you with scream attacks because it's the worst creature design ever made aside from maybe the stalkers in Borderlands 2 because fuck those guys as well"
---
Dude you should stop posting and call an ambulance for that dick falling off problem
---
Hey maybe-some-thyme, I know the team is definitely aware of this feedback, but I'll share your thread with them too!
---
Ah, yes, the magical worlds where arbitrarily selected metrics don't matter in a project that has had a disastrous start.
---
3 months is absolutely never ever the amount of time where projects are evaluated for determinations of funding on support staff and devs.
---
Sure, you're totally right.
---
I know how you feel, my point of view : (I'm french sorry un advance for the mistakes)
---
When the game was first announced, if I remember, Bethesda wanted to try something new. A big multiplayer fallout 4 style game but without npc to force real role playing. 
---
On the paper , it's wonderful: base building, trading between players, ressources managing like as Fallout 4, I would pay for that game !
---
Unfortunatly in reality some feature just don't work as if it was treated too fast like if Bethesda were in a rush. ( And it's probably what happened)
---
As a result the game look infinished,unbalanced, crash on consoles, who thought it was a good idea to hunt for players un the entire map just for initiating a trade, why just can't we have a shop at our base ? 
---
They announced like day one, the game will not be like a Fallout 4 sequel, I was okay with that but my theory is that for a unknown reason they lacked of time with this game. The question 
---
Fallout 3 was a game about surviving a hostile environment and that never had any of the annoyances I listed above.
---
&gt; Maybe play something else.
---
If you read my post you will see I sold it after a month. I have been playing the previous Fallout games since then and that's what prompted me to make this post.
---
Haha.  I've had enough ranting for one sitting.  I said my piece.
---
I repair maybe once every 3 days, other than that it's not really tedious, other than my hazmat suits I don't think I've repaired this week thinking about it
---
Probably to farm legendary gear, that would be my guess.
---
about 50% of players of fo76 left the game when the weigth glich fixed...
---
Uh. Can’t you literally just buy that now? Pretty sure I saw a post just today that all the plans for power armor including jet packs are on Phoenix.

Oh god... I can just see it now! T-Posing ghouls that fly and a 3* Legendary Mr. Prize Bot Scorchbeast Queen coming out of the earth!
---
This is what MMORPGs are like, especially after you've completed quests, and what led me to quit them.  Grinding.  Endless grinding that makes you start to wonder why you are playing the game.  One day I loaded up Fallout 3 to give it a go instead of logging into Wow and realized what I was missing, what my "me" time was all about.
---
bet the redbull case is the team leader. And more productive than team A and B together.
---
Upvoted, I know it doesnt mean much as the hate train moves on thru, but you are right.
---
Speaking of CAPS... Cap Collector PERK isn't working at all. I have that card maxed out &amp; I'm only finding 10-15 in a cap stash. Awesome 😑
---
Sure, all we need is more nerfs... Maybe they should to something with melee damage and nerf it too?
---
Glad that you’re enjoying it! But the game is not ‘fine’. It has a lot of crippling bugs that need to be fixed, if they don’t bother you I am jealous but for a lot of players they are very frustrating 
---
We are entitled because we are upset that Bethesda no longer lives up to the expectations that the franchise set?
---
Not a glitch but after the patch, and insane number of ghouls are spawning for me in white springs golf course, I mean like 30 at a time in giant waves. And like 8/10 are legendary. I’ve never seen even half this many ghouls before 
---
Use endangerol and watch her health drop, and prime your weapons and use meds. If you weren't doing those things before, that's a gain of 75% extra damage per person. It's the toughest boss in the game, treat it as such. 
---
Why, is Fallout 76 turning into the new Rick &amp; Morty or something?
---
I may have made it unclear. I’m saying wouldn’t it have fixed the issue to do this one thing instead of nerfing every other aspect
---
Probably gone sellin hotdogs by this point.
---
There’s plenty to give feedback on without making shit up. 
---
Thank you, so basically no more spray and pray lol
---
I have two fall damage reducing armor pieces. (-50% each) I can jump down and it won't hurt. 
---
I think you lost them at the QA part 
---
There was no note that Bobby pin weight reduction was only a two week special. This sneaky bothered me more than anything
---
What about teammates or self being invisible and no teammate icon on compass? Both of us on PS4 Pro.
---
What about suspicious VATS missed shots with hunting rifles? Missing 3-5 times in a row with a 95% chance to hit? Seems to be a bigger issue with headshots. "Issue" has been confirmed with multiple people.
---
Since plans are static at vendors now, does that mean the Handmade Rifle plans have no upper level limit to acquire?
---
You all are getting there! Good job, especially thank you for putting an upper limit on carry weight!!!
---
No real use in having mules though for most peoples. I've seen TWO dudes using them as a full clan's bank, they doing BOS RP.
---
Everyone else just stacking légendaries they will never use
---
That probably has the MIRV that has lower damage because it splits into multiple parts.
---
This is incredibly sad to watch. It seems that FO76 makes half a dozen bad choices for every one good choice they make.
---
I just left and it wouldn’t stop spawning glowing ghouls without a nuke and almost every single one was dropping level 45/50 legendary items. Even non legendary enemies. I had to stop because I kept leveling and getting over encumbered with tons of glowing meat lol 
---
We definitely haven't forgot - the dev team has been made aware of this feedback, and as always I'll share this thread too. Thanks, vigi!
---
Actually  i just was at my Local  Electronics  Store ... to pick something else up .  If you would actually want to you could pick up  76 in  the following Versions:   Base Game  ( Pc, Xbox, PS4 ) 70$, Tricentennial ( Pc , Xbox , PS4 ) 90$, the
---
MICROSOFT Xbox One X 1TB Konsole – Robot White Special Edition Fallout 76 Bundle ( 570$) and the infamous  Fallout 76 Collectors Edition  Xbox  (220$)
---
Which one do you want me to get ya  dude ?
---
What I've listed above is not incompetence. It's intentional to try and keep players in the loop of farming resources while not being able to keep what they've farmed for any significant amount of time, and to make selling extra resources an inconvenience.
---
Yeah, you are kinda asking for it. But those are your opinions and im glad you have the guts to share them. Happy Gaming!
---
Yes, as you level up the game quickly turns into a boring grind of traveling to 7 vendors to sell yesterday's junk for about 30 mins and then spending the next hour finding more plastic and junk to bulk for tomorrow's sell and gear repair. So about 90 mins is wasted on vendors/repair every game session which ended up being almost all the free time. So I quit.
---
Fallout 76 reminds me of Jurassic World Evolution. Frontier, creator of Planet Coaster, really messed that game up. Everyone said Universal rushed the launch but if you sign a deal you know the deadline. That game was shit during launch, worked like a beta game, took a very long time before we got some usefull patches and now the game actually works **BUT**  I had the same feelings as with fo76, paid money for something not even finished
---
You you can now. I'm talking about up to today. Why did we have to wait several months for this? 
---
And what I said still applies to the ultracite power armor calibrated shocks. I killed over 20 scorch beast queens hoping for the plans to drop, and finally gave up and bought them from someone here on reddit.
---
Players would f*** it up with verbal abuse from across the map
---
Then you must NEVER play Elder Scrolls Online..
---
I was really looking forward to that, too... 
---
Very disappointed in this patch, all around. 😔

Im fully aware other weapons are much more effective, that's not the point. It's a fricken browning 50 cal, not a pee shooter.
---
That's because they see what is screwing up the worst on pc before it gets pushed to consoles.... u gonna be mad with your next one if half the crap makes it through to you guys
---
You’re actually the worst type of fucking consumer, this whole fucking sub is a joke. You’re allowing a company to literally make you think this game is OK lmao like holy shit how aren’t you mad at the fact the games broken again and been rolled back to an older client and what you think that’s fun?! 
---
Not all stashes are showing up for me. The less frequently grabbed ones were there, but the ones that are only there 75% of the time or less weren't there for me tonight.
---
Plus, I only got 1 cap from each of them. However, on the upside, now that stashes are useless, I can stop keeping the perk to find them equipped.
---
Are you on PC? I can craft Calibrated Shocks for pretty much any Power Armor. 
---
"alt-history, post-apocalyptic exploration"- is not genre, it is theme. Genre is offline FPS, Online Survival, MMO, MMORPG, Rally, Simulator, Strategy etc. You don't say "Modern guns" is my genre.
---
And no plans of parts?
---
Lv 90. Just bought handmade plan at Watoga railway.
---
1. Never pre-order. Period. If you pre-order, expect deception.
---
Also, kthxbye.
---
No offense man, but I don’t think anyone sporting a cartoon dog with black shades on as their online persona is in any position to say what’s bad and what’s not
---
I mean they knew that there are dupers with 100k caps and increased the price of everything, thus making the dupers profit again, since they are the only ones who can buy the items. SUCH LOGIC.
---
Not to mention the various XP nerfs as well which makes the current system a drag.
---
Underrated comment.
---
the point that you have to grind and server hop just to get stimpaks should say enough...
---
not to mention having to swap perks every time you do this.
---
It isn't that perk thats useful now it's the one that adds the ability to "search" the container. Though I'm having trouble. I think you need the card equipped when you load the cell. I've been swapping it in and I don't have the option to search 
---
Werent people complaining about coop “because you need to be able to solo”
---
I'd be okay with this. I mean, we're all pretty used to being beta testers at this point. At least this way we'd have that world-building experience Bethesda promised us. :) 
---
Several months is not that long. I don’t know why you guys act like it is. We didn’t have it right away because that’s not how it was originally designed. Now we have all the plans but they’re much more expensive. If that doesn’t work for the community they’ll probably try something different. I don’t know what you hope to accomplish by complaining about something they’ve already fixed. It honestly feels like people like you just want to be upset. 
---
You will get down voted, but only because you can’t read. 
---
Hilarious, no more fallout nor elder. Scrolls.

You guys should probably report this to the team, to Todd, to the shareholders, or whatever.
---
I know you won't answer cause you can't assess the failure (and we know you are community manager so not responsible of any of this shitstorm) but you can't let them be blind.
---
This is almost the most upvoted post of this sub, it has been gilded and silvered which means people actually agree to GIVE MONEY to someone saying "your company is reeking of incompetence right now".
---
Might be worth a thought. We might not be taking decisions for Bethesda, but we are giving you our money. Or at least we were.
---
Got the same thing happen to me aswell
---
Can confirm. I am on the Xbox and I have marsupial and when I had rad worms I also seemed to gain super jump along with bird bones.  Keep in mind I do not have the bird bones mutation normally but I was definitely floating. 
---
Thats what im windering and it scares me since Beth might "fix" it and break something else in the process.
---
It would have been nice if as an alternative to using junk/materials to fix weapons and armor you could use duplicate weapons and armor like FO3 and FONV. Maybe these methods wouldn't fully repair an item like using crafting materials would, but would be a nice alternative and make the repair process seem less like a chore when it comes to collecting materials for repair.
---
I guess the argument against that would be that players wouldn't even bother with getting junk and crafting materials, but I would think this would be balanced out due to spending crafting materials would allow you to fully repair an item and repair an item over 100% (with the right perks) and using another weapon or armor piece that is the same type to repair an item would only partially repair it.  
---
In any case the game needs to reduce the repair requirements across the board. Managing repairs and item condition requires too much time and thought as it is, and you don't even have the luxury of dumping all your broken stuff off somewhere for a later point due to the STASH limit.
---
Yep, me too. At least Division 2 will be released soon.
---
You are getting duping confused with a weapon implemented in the game 
---
No I was just there, plenty of 60+ level ghouls.
---
You didn’t feel ridiculous typing this at all?
---
Wait, you got your beta for free? I paid $60 + tax. :( I heard they should release the full game aaaaany day now.
---
Yes because these two things are equivalent lmao. 
---
Oh BTW 60% of 20 is 12 not 5 so yeah do the math asshat
---
This is very in line with my opinions and thoughts as well. If they had thrown in a free respec or even one for like 500 atoms for fucks sake would have at least kept me on the game. Ain’t grinding 20 levels at 170 to rebuild my whole damn character after I already did that when they FIXED the TSEs that were glitching and not damaging anybody. Spent a good 40 specs just moving from melee to rifle and now back to damn melee I guess. 
---
What condescending bullshit. Ugh, fans are the fucking worst sometimes.
---
Wow. Sounds like someone didn't take an economics 101 class. You probably won't own a personal business anytime soon either. I'd also be willing to say that you have posted a lot of shade on Fallout 76 on public forums like this just to make yourself feel better? Who knows?
---
Honestly the only thing that troubles me some what are the scorched queen and to a lesser extent the beasts, just pop in an out of cover during shots
---
Zenimax was created by Bethesda to manage their other assets, so it *is* Bethesda.
---
Point being it's meant to be rare and powerful, something to celebrate when finding your first one.
---
Letting the team know about this now. Thank you for letting us know
---
always be prepared and prepare to make sacrifices

 &gt; Letting the team know about this now. Thank you for letting us know
---
Can’t be rare with duper’s selling it?
---
Definitely. Ask all fifa, battlefield and call of duty players. Also things like bad pc ports. They pay up to 70 dollars for these bad times, lmao.
---
cut to any designer ever making a face
---
I agree with you on many levels, however, say tedious one more mutha fucking time... 
---
You just pull that outta your butt? The only official word is that you use third party mods at your own risk. 
---
When I sprint in power armor and jump with marsupial out of the sprint, my guy hits an invisible platform and pushes off of it 
---
I couldnt agree more, i preordered what was assumed to be a completed game, it is far from that in any shape or form.  I want my money back as well for misleading me as a consumer, it should have been sold as fo76 “beta” nothing more, this beta does not meet any qualifications of a completed game when developers are focusing on fixes instead of new content.
---
Different underarmors are learned differently.  I think the only one where you can buy all 4 from a vendor is Enclave, and the only where you get all 4 by just visiting a bunch of places is Vault Suit.
---
[This google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/htmlview#) (from before the patch) says that the first two for Rader are learned by buying from the vendor, but the later two for Raider are gotten as random quest rewards from the savage divide or from raider quests.
---
The 4 poster bed is the same its absolutely tiny compared to the standard beds from plans in game
---
This latest patch went beyond nerfing TSE. In what can only be seen as an ill conceived attempt to further neuter TSE, they nerfed Demo Expert. This deals a heavy blow to users of grenades and the assorted launchers.
---
The simpler solution would have been to buff explosive guns (which need it) and have the demo expert perk only apply to them.  The explosive legendary effect would be wholly separate and unaffected so that those guns couldn’t double dip on damage buffing perks. 
---
Teach me your ways 
---
They already said player vending is coming. 
---
They're running melee builds.
---
I can't argue with that. Nerfing them isnt a good solution though.
---
I doubt they can do something properly - 21:9 is still broken, sooo much time after the release and last patch, most changes that are useful are gimmicks while game is still festival of bugs, glitches and crappy servers. I have problem with friendlist for more than a week, game quits to windows at least 5 times a day (playing session \~5hours), they can't repair challenges (some just doesn't update, no matter what), and what's most irritating, they "force" me to change build to melee to make any significant damage to the SBQ, since my rifleman build is now mildly-acceptable to molerats and ghouls but almost useless for SBQs. 
---
The perk was nerfed due to explosive legendarys, but I agree the grenade launcher and launchers could use a buff.
---
I’m not gonna argue what i personally think is fun with some angry rando. Also calm down 
---
By new content I don't necessarily mean new plot lines, map areas or bosses - though those will definitely be needed in due course since it IS an online game, not a solo. There has to be something to keep people logging in past the point of launching a nuke. I'm still not there yet, and I'm not sure I ever will be, because the world itself is barren and isn't luring me back.  
---
By new content, I think that I, and many other people, want some of the things that were hinted at or implied and which we all thought were in the wings - not months or years off. Like shops, in-world communities, stronger collaborative events and instances.   
---
At the moment "new content" to Bethesda seems to mean - this bobby pin weighs a lot! Now it weighs nothing. Now it weighs a lot again! This gun does a lot of damage! Now it does none. Now it does some! Etc, etc. 
---
&gt; As for their plan, people can only guess and assume at this time. Which is what they will do. 
---
Well... yeah. That's kind of what I'm seeking. Feel yourself under no obligation to participate. Many, many moons ago I was an online Harry Potter fan while the books were being written. Those books were the tightest secret on the planet at the time - the pentagon was leakier. And damnit if the online communities didn't have all the big secrets, cliffhangers and endings figured out well before the second to last book was even released. Never underestimate the power of fans to get inside the heads of the creators. I'm not looking for a crystal ball here but it's fun to speculate. If the groupmind reckons that what you see is what you get, I feel that's valuable knowledge  because I'd rather start spending my time on something else rather than investing in 76 only to watch it become more and more of a shitshow. 
---
No doubt they do carry more than 1500.  But is it really 'bullshit' to say that people shouldn't be able to carry more than literally *two thirds of a ton*?
---
&gt; I don’t know why you guys act like it is.
---
I don't know why guys like you act like it's  okay to wait several months to have a game that's playable. 
---
Why are people uninstalling the game? Instead of doing that how about you all refund this mess and actually show as a consumer this isn’t acceptable? This sub is filled with complete idiots who will support this game to the death and make them think its acceptable in 2019 to produce this kind of shit. This isn’t a AAA, people need to wake up and start caring where their fucking money actually goes. 
---
Thank you for this long response mate. Very helpful
---
Yeah that part is rediculous I just meant that it says known😂 I refuse to spend that many caps on a plan
---
Holy shit, this fucking thread. Anybody not foaming at the mouth with bloody spittle is getting downvoted to oblivion. 
---
Carry weight perks, the very fast melee weapons which are useless (fists are better), explosive weapons and their ammo in general.
---
Same for me, very convenient.
---
They obviously increased the prices to offset how easy it is to get plans now. I think it’s a great trade. Now instead of rng we know we can get the plan and just have to save for it. This change has nothing to do with dupers. Stop blaming dupers for absolutely everything. 
---
'I'm going back to NMS because Fallout 76 is so bad'... Tell that to your 2016 self XD
---
It's a good thing i stuck with my spiked board since day from release.
---
Thank you for confirming mate
---
Adjusting the weight of an item isn't going to have much impact at all
---
Thanks for this mate
---
They were selling god roll melee weapons too and armor
---
Must just have been unlucky, last 5 runs for sure all the same
---
PA removes fall damage
---
It was also done to prevent auto scrapping of mods. But of course they broke bulk junk at the same time 
---
"Serum recipes now are around 21,000 caps" . Does that mean I need to farm caps for 15 days straight to get 1 serum recipe since we are capped at 1,400 a day? If I want 6 mutations I need to farm 3 months? Wow, that's insane!
---
B-but todd said EVERY studio was worming on it...
---
They're not so much weathering the storm as they're just ignoring it. A real shame.
---
What kind of maniac uses a plasma weapon against the Queen anyways 😂 they’re awful in this game 
---
Another way about it that could've been done was possibly nerfing legendaries that have multiple effects so that with every added effect they have each individual effect is slightly less strong, giving you less buff in a certain direction but a better spread across all the effects.
---
As the other guy said, that is incorrect. Likely you’re encountering the bug that shows vendors at 0 caps despite having their 200. 
---
If you run into a vendor that shows 0 caps and you’re pretty sure you didn’t empty them out, buy or sell something small to make their cap count refresh.
---
Please, for the love of god, Gatling Plasmas and literally every other gun listed. They (Gatling Plasmas) do decent-ish damage. Not utterly fantastic but not nearly as bad as the others but they break WAY TOO QUICKLY. My Handmade has a higher damage output lifespan than almost every heavy gun except possibly the Gatling Gun. 
---
That’s not how it works lol. 
---
If Todd Howard really intended that the game would be completely different after its first year, then it begs the question: What in the hell were they thinking when they designed this game in the first place?
---
Thank God that Boeing doesn't design airplanes with this philosophy.
---
Same thing with my t-60 bright headlamp.
---
Theory: they were testing with adding new mods for power armor that are atom shop pay to win exclusives and used the headlamp to test it and forgot to remove it from the patch.
---
please educate me then. how does increasing the price of everything help those who didn't dupe and didn't farm caps? no I throw shade at the game because I expected much more from Beth, since they were my favorite developer and want them to learn from this disaster and not make TES 6 and Starfield a mess like this. Please professor, educate me more! 
---
Previous levels of explosive nonlegwndary weapons were insultingly low. Previous levels of TSE weapons were actually fine too, but only if you did not have a terrible build. Without any particular legedary armor, it was then possible to take a TSE shotty magazine and walk out, without sentinel nor cavalier.
---
Now its possible to take unlimited amount of shotgun shots if they are not shot from a bloodbuild.
---
The amount of people that could participate in PvP and not get wrecked second 1 was much, much, much greater than it is now. Its been slashed to few percent.
---
I believe we are having such an extreme nerf right now to show the community that previous values were not so bad and thats knowing what you are doing is the most important factor.
---
Granted the game feels like a chore, but that’s how these style of games feel like. I read a review somewhere that mentioned 76 feels like Minecraft made with the creation engine, and honestly, after 200+ hours, I totally agree with that sentiment. If 76 is a weird take for you, then play another game in the series bud.
---
PS, just my two cents on the matter, the inventory/scavenging system in Fo4 was the most ridiculously boring game mechanic I’ve ever come across. There was nothing fun about having EVERYTHING given to you in an apocalypse, especially when online forums had millions of pages dedicated to who sells what. That’s what I enjoy about 76, I really felt alone playing this game, more so than any other Fallout I’ve ever played. Every other game felt like a walk in the park (albeit the original fallouts, they had no mercy written all over them), but 76 really sat me on my ass and told me that I’m gonna get very little rewards for a long time, and honestly? I love the fuck out of it. I like the idea of grinding and grinding, and still not being good enough. Every Fallout before 76 had a goal, a certain point that you hit where no enemy can kill you, all quests are finished, and you’re left with your dick in your hands and a stash with every bulk item imaginable. After logging in more hours than I ever have on any character before, I honestly can say that 76 is my most favorite Bethesda Fallout. 
---
I’m sure they play test some things. Like they said they tested being able to kill the queen with the changes. Yeah you just need to be melee heavy and have them carry the fight. I wonder if she can be killed by a team only using ranged weapons and if she can what level of stupid the amount of ammo people would go through to do it. 
---
I just sneak through it with my DCG. 
---
I switch to a Hazmat when the radiation is too much. I have launched 4 nukes, all solo.
---
Thank you for writing this out in detail mate. Really do appreciate it. Sharing this with the dev team.
---
I think majority of us as players are pretty unhappy right now. :(
---
Read again, if you still miss- You don't sell vendors, you sell them to players. You going around trying to sell one exterminator weapon, ofc no one is going to buy it. Search where people are trading, read what they want, looks what people have sold for what price and then actually gather the stock.
---
There seems to be a lot of replies to them that makes it seem people don't realise they're not actually devs
---
He probably doesn't have any caps on him.
---
Exactly. So what nerf everything? bad logics on beth
---
They intended the game to change based on user feedback to make a game that is loved by its players, were currently in the feedback stage where the players hate everything because they think if something isnt right now it never will be
---
How the fixes they implemented yesterday could change the bobby pin's weight back to 0.1? I don't know if they rolled back to an old build, but they sure fucked up.
---
Iam not playing the game until this GAME BREAKING BUG is fixed! It's enough, all the other bug in the past are nothing compared to this bug! I cannot tolerate this anymore!
---
The devs went overboard this time. 
---
Perhaps I've been too busy running around shooting stuff to notice like this, but can you actually farm caps? How and where?
---
Game has been playable. Sure it’s bugged to hell sometimes but for the most part it’s absolutely playable. I’ve experienced exactly one game breaking bug, the power armor bug, and it was with the first patch. I have over 300 hours so if it’s not playable I’m not sure what I did for all that time. 
---
It's a kid's bed, I bought it for my family house build. 
---
As always with camp items in the Atomic Shop, preview them *in game*. It's pretty obvious in build mode that it's a very small bed. 
---
(Slowly raises hand but drops again at the first stare)
---
**getting stuck in entering new power armor frame still not fixed, getting stuck in terminals still not fixed! nice!**
---
I (your trash can) have arrived
---
Thank you bottlecandoor - this is very helpful
---
I agree 100% that new leadership is needed to right this ship. That's why I said since day one, they should hand over the keys to modders.
---
In its current state, this game is unfixable. Further, because it's multiplayer there's going to be nerfs and buffs that are going to make some people happy and others angry. With private servers, you could choose which mods to use and not to use to tailor to the way you like. Players would have a multitude of servers they could choose to join, depending on what they are looking for out of the game.
---
There's no way to No Man's Sky this game. The reason they made an enormous come back was because the basic foundation of the game was solid, it just needed content. With Fallout not only is there a lack of content, but the game is a buggy broken mess.
---
I see, thanks for the info
---
I guess if you have enough caps.. For me, I now have a reason to do events, I need the caps! Theres so much to buy now! Before Id hope for 1 new pattern to show up when I visit a vendor, now Im going to be farming caps for ages to get everything!
---
I would be really interested to know what would happen if a large chunks of the populations character data went missing or got corrupted somehow because of a patch. I do really wonder if it says that has the ability to restore things like that as I have read on many comments they do not. 
---
This is a conversation that’s up for discussion. Whereas you didn’t even read it. 
---
I didn’t just mention the TSE, the first sentence was me welcoming it. 
---
No, you’re right. Redditors and Youtubers don’t make up the whole of the fandom, I’ll give you that. 
---
But the most hardcore of us players ARE from here or YouTube. We know what’s right for the game, and for balancing. The casuals who play once every couple of days, on the other hand, do not. 
---
Worth the price of ESO+  to have ubimited space for materials honestly. Playing without it  is really annoying. 
---
Respec? That's probably gonna cost atoms. 
---
This is unacceptable. If I can't warp spacetime around me, how can they claim that the game is in a playable state?
---
3* Legendary Mr. Prize Bot lmfao
---
So i found out the hard way after multiple trial and errors that if you attempt to open your pipboy too quickly when entering a server for the first time it will freeze up permanently until you leave and try again, do not open your pipboy until you can see npcs or your camp fully loaded and you shouldnt have an issue.
---
Sorry you won't get an answer. Their interact-with-community-day was yesterday, now you have to wait until the new patch. Meanwhile, they will only post on innocent threads with cute pictures and wholesome stories.
---
Because if you have to spend more time on the game you will pay your abonnement longer.
---
I'm guessing someone doesn't have the balls to tell the shareholders we don't pay an abo for this game.
---
Because of it being cross platform it prob couldn’t happen. I’m not an expert on ps or Xbox but I’m pretty sure they don’t have dedicated servers that you can pull from a server list, with server bound characters on most games. To rebuild the world you would need to be able to logon to the same server everyday and play against the same people in other clans etc, similar to a lot of MMO on pc. I’m i orang and didn’t read but I assumed that’s how the game would be, like a huge map with like thousands of people on it ha. 24 fandoms is kinda hard to build community
---
Lol another mans trash can
---
You're correct, this was my misunderstanding. 
---
Your single experience in the game is not near enough data to make broad sweaping comments about other players experiences. Its also pretty obivious you dont know what you're talking about and it doesnt even matter anymore now that they sell the plans so im outa here. Glad you got the gear you wanted and Happy Gaming to ya
---
Even if 200 caps is their daily inventory limit, stop capping how much they have from our buying. E.g., say modus has 200 caps in his daily inventory and a serum recipe worth 17500 caps...I sell modus 40 purified waters at 5 caps each, gaining 200 caps and taking modus to 0; I buy his serum recipe, losing 17500 caps... currently, modus doesn’t just only put a fraction of my 17500 cap purchase back into inventory, he never puts more than 200 caps into his inventory. That makes a bunch of small purchases less costly than one big purchase, because the fractions of purchase price gained as caps inventory never goes over 200 for each small purchase, so I can easily get them all back by selling more water. 
---
Dunno why you’re downvoting, the guy is right. 
---
The cap limit? It’s 25k
---
I'm still totally down for the PVP servers, but apparently I'm in the minority. Two things that are a must for PVP servers. 
---
1. New Characters Only. The game was so broke that so many players have glitched, duped, and exploited their way to levels that should be literally unobtainable under normal circumstances.
---
2. No Visibility on the Minimap. That makes stealth combat more realistic, but also prevents constant ambushes. There is nothing easier than knowing where your enemy is 100% of the time, then just crouching to their location to merc them. It's what I do everytime to kill wanted players with ease.
---
2.5. Remove wanted system in PVP servers.
---
I agree with most of the posts here, though. More Co-op content needs to be the primary focus. I'll be honest; I haven't played in over a month because the constant grind, lack of storable space, and completely shit drops have just killed the fun. I think I quit at like lvl 150-ish.
---
Anywhere that's near water and doesn't get shot every 5 seconds.. reason.. I has industrial water purifier..
---
Hey Col, thanks for this. I commented about this on other thread but I'll include the answer here so you know - with regards to the stash limit, the dev team is indeed exploring increases to stash limits - this has not changed. They are just currently figuring out a number that they're comfortable with such that servers won't be affected negatively.  
---
In terms of your caps limit feedback, thank you for letting me know! I've passed this feedback onto the team
---
Yeah, I'm not sure if they were in financial trouble or just greedy, but this one was 100% rushed to market.
---
Hey, no need to laugh. I thought it worked that way at first, too. It's not a very detailed system. 
---
If a triple A game company can’t figure out how to have a very large amount of items in a server then we have a bigger problem on our hands.
---
Don't you get caps on killing people to get wanted though?
---
Did I forget to mention that he now starts pointing you to settlements that need our help?
---
Oh my god you guys are such dramatic babies lmao. 
---
For anyone who purchased TSE weapons on 3rd party sites serves you right. 
---
Everyone with a logical brain knew that this anything with TSE was WAYYYYYYYYYYYY... OP
---
the nerf was inevitable. Unfortunately melee weapons are going to be the next big thing that's going to be nerfed.
---
I cant find the quest on my log either, i wanted to complete it but now i cant. Total bullshit
---
In Fallout? Honestly not really. :) Yeah. We were promised a second stash increase. I'm past ready.
---
Clearly that’s not true based on the last patch.
---
Try legendary farming and selling it on discords or the trade Reddit 1 or 2k per trade is normal a great roll can go for like 7k. Ontop of that 1.2k a day just from vendors. Get geared enough to quickly solo the queen and make like 300 caps per queen before selling flux for 150 to 200 per. 600 a day just from the silos
---
Have you considered unsubbing from a game you don't play?
---
They never said it would be in this patch. Why would you expect it? That’s coming with the March patch I believe. 
---
I wouldn't take any of these advices. This subreddit has more salt than both fortnite and the summoner rift.
---
With the new patch, I don't see any Deep Pocket plans at the Grafton Vendor.  Anyone else find which vendor (if any) sell these?
---
I mean you were entitled to sit and argue with me on the last comment so why change the attitude? The games dead, how can you have fun on a game which you 100000% know is buggy, lags consistently, has a bad framework and literally provides nothing endgame wise and what you think that’s worth £60/$70 yeah?! 
---
Yup, they seem to be balancing everything around PvP and not PvE, I went from being a badass to being washed up in one patch. TS/E/TSE weapons were the only good "end game" ranged loot, and they made taking on nuke zones and the SBQ bearable. I went from having a TS gatling gun that did 250, E gatling gun that did 340, E .50cal that did 180, and a TSE Harpoon Gun that did 1400 (this was the only "overpowered" one); stack the Modifier nerfs with the Explosive perk nerf and now my guns take an ungodly amount to kill anything. I was talking to some people in-game and we all basically said "whelp time to go back to a melee build, guns are done".
---
Hey ParkSouls - I responded to another thread about this but I just want to make sure you also know that I've let the team know about frustrations with the cap limit, especially after the recent update with plans.
---
I might sound like a broken record but thank you for this feedback. It seriously helps.
---
What glitch would that be? Apparently only when people comment on here or make a youtube video with instructions on how to do it will it ever get patched after its made public.
---
It's Senpai to you novice!
---
It's honestly not that hard unless you are not putting in hours. I traded for over 400k caps already. 2 characters already have all plans for C.A.M.P. and working on the 3rd. Now on to how to make those caps!
---
You just post up the legendaries you find and people will pay ridiculous amounts for something I find useless.
---
I farmed 3☆ Mutants for a week and used scrapper to bulk my steel and sold that for about 80k cap by itself alone. Oh btw, that means I create and sell ammo...
---
Opened a shop with rare outfits from other trades I made on my 5 characters, bam, instant caps.
---
Now, if you don't socialize then you are probably going to end up outside Vault 76 at the moonshiners hut drunk, chem ridden, and being fed on by ticks while you complain to yourself about how bad the game is which is a reflection of your own skills. 
---
No dupes necessary to make caps. It just takes some "thinking outside the box". 
---
If you have anymore questions like how builds work or the best places to farm, shoot them my way. I'll set you on the right path, you just can't be a lazy keyboard warrior. :3

 &gt; Hey ParkSouls - I responded to another thread about this but I just want to make sure you also know that I've let the team know about frustrations wit...
---
That's an entirely unrelated thing
---
&gt;im outa here
---
Good riddance. 
---
‘Finding our for yourself’ is a good way to waste money.
---
I'm not sure how they parse through the game's feedback so far, but considering what I read online it appears that they are changing many things that people don't want and not fixing things that really need it.
---
This may be an over simplification, but that's how it looks right now.
---
The reason Sony aren’t down for crossplay is because of technical reasons, they’ve been working on this for a while and have only gotten it right with Rocket League and Fortnite, and that was through the developers ends, not Sony’s. 
---
I think give or take another 2 years when next gen rolls around, I think everyone will be happily playing together. 
---
I completely agree. Playing with a subscription is much more enjoyable. Basic inventory capacity is sufficient to store weapons, armor and all sorts of potions.
---
Wandering around and collecting resources is a pleasant, meditative exercise, it is surprising that we are forbidden to do this in Fallout 76. The player who just farm resources does not load the server, does not require new content, just runs around the world for hours and presses one button. Is not a gift for the developer?
---
ESO is free to play. Fallout 76 isn't. Given that people would see something like this for what it is - a cash grab.
---
I'm not necessarily against the idea in principle but If we get to a stage where Fallout 76 goes free to play, I hope that all the people that had purchased the game gets one of those crafting bags for free.
---
Thank you for taking the time and replying I'll most definitely put what you've said into use !
---
They should make dungeons where you have to have a party of 4 or 6 or 8 and then people could team up at the entrance.
---
the only mod i know exists for the super sledge is the heated coils, i dont think there are any other mods for it in the whole game. all other mods i’ve seen have been for the sledgehammer so far
---
I haven't played in like 3 weeks and from what everything I've seen on the sub I plan to wait a good while before I go back and try again
---
That’s because all consoles have KBAM support for Fortnite. 
---
As I understand there is some kind of levelling mechanism to make it fairer?  I have no details and I'm skeptical about how well it will work but that's what I heard anyway.
---
Haha, well Anthem is out next month so if they keep this up i'll just switch to that fully instead of playing both like I was planning to. 
---
MASSIVE thank you for letting us know about this. I've told the team about it.  
---
If anyone else has this issue too, please respond to this thread as the team will also see your responses too
---
You sure have the balls to say that in the vicinity of such a toxic fanbase but yeah I agree with you.
---
Everything wasn’t trash lol. Using an OP weapon was just a crutch for bad players. Learn how to properly spec and play the game. 
---
Kthxbye
---
Every game that was ever made has had bugs. Every modern game has bad bugs. Especially online  games. Very bad bugs. But none of the modern games are crippled. They all recover (no man's sky comes to mind). What is it about Fallout 76 that is so crippling 3 or 4 months in that it is unplayable/crippled? What bugs are so bad that you are not enjoying the game? I only ask because I am genuinely curious. I cannot solo the scorch beast queen. But I have defeated her in groups. Is that crippling the game? I don't like that "feed the people" no longer rewards everyone on the server. Is that crippling the game? I get server disconnects. I got one tonight because Comcast decided to update their servers. I got one yesterday because whatever. Does that cripple an online game? I wish energy weapons were more viable. But right now they are not. Is that crippling the game? I didn't get a gjallarhorn in Destiny until the end of the first year. But I didn't call the game crippled like everyone else that wanted one. What is so frustrating about this game that you or others could be having a problem with it? PVP? I can't comment on that because I don't engage in it. I have and it was fun. My friend and I kicked some ass once. But I don't pursue it. What is so crippling about this game that maybe I am not seeing? 
---
Quick, Bethesda, hire more yes men!
---
So your solution is to grind more. Thx but no thx. This game is already a grindfest. 
---
Introduce throwing poker cards already! Give us a perk to charge those cards for explosive damage!
---
Yeah, but they didnt warn us before they nerfed Demolition Expert. And White Knight. (So, every armor that isnt PA)
---
I mean, I’m not gonna spend 23k on a serum plan, I’m gonna find a play with the plan and buy one serum for like 1k plus mats or whatever. 
---
Or worse, they accidentally used a pre-launch Version for the latest patch, which also happen to contain old coding and reintroduces known bugs 
---
I think that the cap limit is a great idea and i’m really glad the introduced it. But why don‘t the auto ban people that have more, like 30 of the same legendary (tse?) weapons of the same type on them. No one that plays the game normally can get so many legendary weapons with the same stats...
---
Hmm seems zenimax online should have handled  it as they did with elder scrolls 
---
Simple, money sinks artificially extend the ‘endgame’ grind without actually adding content.
---
It really is the ridiculous health pools that kill it for me. It sometimes feels like we're playing a shooter in a world where everything is immortal.
---
I walk out of a mine or cave or something and that visible ear rape of yours blinds me and that's about it. It's not worth the time and ammo to get the Ma Deuce out of my pocket and unload like 1500 rounds for a scorchbeast wing. But it also can't kill me either, I just can't see anything anymore, so I stumble around like a blind person until I find a building to hide in so I can see again.
---
You'd think as someone who plays a lot of Monster Hunter it'd be no problem for me, the monsters in those games tend to have pretty big health pools. But they're also fun to fight, and worth taking the time to do so. And I can go into "end game" content knowing that if I slip up I'll probably die and fail the hunt.
---
As it stands now, I don't even play 76 anymore, and with they way these up/downdates have been going, I probably won't keep it installed for much longer.
---
So long as they hotfix it in the next day or 2, I don't care whether or not they say anything official about it.
---
It'll likely be boiler plate PR speak anyhow.
---
Ehh... your right. 
---
Never pre order another Bethesda game (to be honest you should never pre-order anything). Always wait at least 2-3 weeks after release to get a proper assessment of a game's state. Don't always reject criticism - there's always a grain of truth. If I could offer you one last piece of advice - subscribe to /r/patientgamers and /r/gamedeals. The former helps with embracing the patience, motivating to clear your library before focusing on new purchases. The latter will help you stay frugal. Thanks to that sub I managed to buy FO76 for £9.99/$13, even though I haven't really properly played it after Beta, I've maybe played for 2-3 hours (15 for beta).
---
Proof? 
---
I see you guys have been responding to many concerns today. Thank you for that. 
---
This is my first fallout and I'm loving it
---
There's 7 faction vendors in the game, each with a 200 cap limit. They reset every 20 hours. This means that every player in the game is limited to earning 1400 caps per day by selling to vendors. On top of that, there's also a limit of 25,000 caps a player can have at any given time. Serums, post patch, cost 23,000 caps. 
---
They never said a lot about this particular patch, in general. I felt broadsided with quite a few things. 
---
But, player vending was announced about 5 weeks ago, so I made the stupid assumption that it was to be included in this patch. 
---
Your right, il def preview in game next time, saw the fancy duvet and rushed to buy it in the atomic shop lol
---
Lets be honest. If you were involved in developing this mess, would you play it in your freetime between the crunch periods?
---
Theyre obviously not playing their own creation. This studio wanted to make hero shooters.
---
Historically this subreddit, in particular, doesn't get behind anything that might make Bethesda answer for its problems.
---
I was expecting an actual communication with the server crashing an instability but we never got a single thing.
---
I'm talking about the implementation in terms of game design, not marketing. This is a great feature that has already been implemented in another game, by people who are somehow your colleagues.
---
Workshops should remain pvp areas though, otherwise someone could squat on all the workshops and get everything from them.
---
If your whole build hinges on a TSE then you are part of the problem.
---
whoops, I mean sell things to vendor for caps. cap stash farming is dead
---
Easier fix would be have them level gated to 3 star 20% 3 star 40% and 3 star 60% then without the ability to equip them simultaneously.
---
All perk card should have been 1-3 star range in my opinion.
---
Thank you! Finally!
---
Maybe after the next nerfs. Weapon nerfs have priority over fixing weapons that work at all.
---
Fans? You mean customers. 
---
&gt;Your single experience in the game
---
My single experience in the game huh? 
---
Yeah. 
---
Okay. 
---
Played the game hundreds of hours. Seen countless people in T60 and T51 power armor. Not a single one with a jet pack. Either those people just don't care about jet packs and they aren't looking for one- or their experience has been exactly like mine. Which means we aren't talking about my single experience at all, but the experience of countless others.
---
Ok. I mean, if you can’t be bothered to learn how to play without using an OP weapon as a crutch this probably wasn’t the game for you in the first place. See ya. 
---
Were you doing an event with another player around? I've had "Lucky Break" proc when I didn't have it equipped, and I assumed it was because the other person doing the event with me was sharing it.
---
The problem of working towards what the devs made work the best?
---
Agreed this is accurate as i tested it today i was during high 1300 damage with my shotgun now i do 250, insane nerf. They should do much more damage than 250...
---
This is all done in preparation for the next stage of what seems like a very delusional plan. You will, most probably, be able to secure all the caps you need in a very short time in the near future. Instantly, in fact. And all you'll need to do is pay real money to do so.
---
True 100%
---
ROFL
---
Criticism=/=hate
---
Yeah no chance I’m letting a stranger have instant access to camp 
---
I'm till banned without reply. Level 196, they do not care. Mistake or not is irrelevant to them
---
So the devs should make pre made audio messages?
---
I think he means the mod response team that has no control over the changes but have to take the piss of it anyways
---
Really? QA can't pull snapshots of a few dozen random real player accounts and look at weights before and after while pushing an update that is only supposed to lower weights? That actually should have been easy.
---
Gaining 12 pounds post patch was actually one of the first things I noticed. I knew it was a weight related patch. I knew what my on person weight was last night pre-patch. It was very simple. I didn't know it was bobby pins immediately, but I immediately knew they'd screwed something up.
---
LOL "two week special" indeed.
---
Yeah I noticed a few on the list that didn't say known but I'm pretty sure I know them.
---
You’re kidding right? Crashes, disconnects, over needs, the game being flooded with duped weapons, treasure maps, armor, caps, meds etc, the poor optimisation, some perks not working correctly, bugged armor effects, ghost camp items in storage that prevented people from building for a month or so. I could go on. I’m going to choose not too because it would take ages.
---
Or just let us craft a stand-alone mod (like we can find and buy). Then we could trade the mod like anything else.
---
The reason I'm yet to make it public is one of the steps involves moving your camp into a train. Or any area which you cant usually place a camp.
---
My camp has been inside the whitesprings trainstation for about 2 weeks now. And I'm starting to like it.
---
You'll like fallout 3, 4 and new vegas more than fallout 76. 
---
80 people is a lot of people. If 80 people are complaining about similar things then perhaps they shouldn’t be ignored and be allowed to post as they please. I’m willing to bet not all those posts you conveniently censored was  simplistic whining but actually legitimate issues.  Which leads me to believe OP that you aren’t being impartial about this. You don’t have to like it, or loathe it but don’t be unprofessional in your actions. Keep this sub an open discussion.
---
Enjoy, Fallout series are always fun. For the people that are familiar with the games, it's hard not realizing the potential it could be.
---
I'll have to play then at some point but for right now I'm just all set playing 76
---
Just wait until you get all rise and incisor 3
---
The spot with copper and acid? SB spawns there every time...
---
Will you be able to help me? My Base duplicated and I got banned. I made a post here about it and uploaded evidence to you tube. Made 2 tickets and had nothing back. Please try get my account back 
---
Yeah, they are also good dmg. Feels good to have explosive laser rifle, cryolator and flamer.
---
Thanks for the response! Just curious though, is there any more info you could give us on exploring stash limits? 
---
I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3kb1/comment/efc8z8w?st=JRIZFYRH&amp;sh=5466a6bd) on another post about the roadmap. 
---
Bethesda keeps telling us they’re trying to be more transparent and provide more info but all it really amounts to is mentioning vague content additions with no timescale and telling us bug fixes are the #1 priority then updating the game with fixes not mentioned before that aren’t necessarily fixes.
---
Seems like the opposite of transparency... 
---
I mean, people have been whining about his white knight is basically a must have for a while now. Beth took the worst possible interpretation of that feedback but no need to pretend this came out of nowhere. 
---
I did this for the Metal Building Set a few days ago.
---
I think this week’s notes were perfect.   Some of the things they did were not so perfect, however.   
---
&gt; There's no present proof that duping via old means is back
---
I doubt I'd be allowed to link it here, but it's on youtube if you care to look.
---
No, thank you. Thank you all for being so passionate and letting us know about these issues. We are in this subreddit everyday and really do admire how much you care about the game to continuously be constructive and let us know what your concerns are.
---
Fallout 76 is like grits compared to the others and once you play the others you will see why so many fallout fans got mad about Bethesda not letting it live up to the potential it could have been at. 
---
yes, it is true
---
Why would they have a note?   They clearly did not intend it.   They lost version control and based this patch on an earlier iteration.   
---
We just need to be able to craft stand alone mods so we can trade them like normal.
---
New Bug - jumped in to see if the servers are actually more stable and they do appear to be, so kudos.  while running around killing things some of my weapons broke so I went back to my camp to repair them.  I was repeatedly told that I did not have the resources to repair my broken weapons, even though I had plenty of bulk materials in my stash. If I moved the bulk items into my inventory, and scrapped them so that they were no longer bulk, I could then repair my broken weapons.
---
At a guess I would say this is an unintended consequence of the “no scrapping mods” bug fix.  The logic that determines what is available for crafting, no longer is including bulk items.
---
Diablo 3 has a good idea on how to do it as well. 
---
They made bobby pins heavy *again*.
---
any one know if any vendors have metal armour plans?
---
Please react fast to this problem, cant play the game anymore because I cant use my materials to buildt/craft or even repair gear or items! ITS GAME BREAKING!!! I will not Log in until this Problem is fixed!
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I don't get my hopes up for any games anymore, and I'm never disappointed thanks to it
---
I don't think you mean Quality Control. There's a bit of an obvious lack of that. You may mean the devs and PR people. But I'm sure they're fine folks.
---
You dropped this \

---
Dude, they can’t even fix the weapons already in the game.
---
What makes you think they’d implement new guns with any success? 
---
Depends , they stated the drop would be temporally stopped till they figure out the animation. Any legacy item would become sought after, even if it's useless.
---
I'm glad you are, actually. It means youll probably love the other products as many of us have too. Its just been way too easy for the fans that have been here since the older games to get jaded. 
---
Fallout 4 in my opinion was good, better than 76 because you see a driving story at work. Even better (for me) was New Vegas based on how much influence your character has.
---
The real criticisms most of us bring up is because we've seen them do much better, so we know that they can do better, but for some reason, they dont. Keep enjoying it though, for sure. We need folks like you in this fanbase to help keep the thing alive.
---
I didn’t argue anything with you, i just said i have fun in the game, which i do. I paid way less than that, but that don’t really matter either. Also can you maybe chill?
---
Regular PvE?   You mean “I have a TSE and you don’t,  I win” mode?
---
So does this if you bother to pay attention
---
I had that happen and in addition the ROF of my Gatling gun was really fast, jumping servers fixed it.
---
I was curious but I still can’t imagine any explosive effect on a close range weapon like that. Lasers and crossbows and others sure. Tesla rifles... maybe? That’s kinda close too though
---
I have logged into a few different games, but I just want to play FO76. I just want it to work and I want them to stop ruining stuff I have fun doing like cap stashes and easy XP and loot at Whitesprings etc. If I want to level up and get some new per cards or change some points around why does it have to be such a chore? Why can't 3 star legendaries always drop 3 star loot? Why can't I farm cap stashes if I want to? I'm having less and less to do in the game. I like being in the game world. I want to play. But it's like they just make it more and more frustrating for me.
---
Is this a console or pc glitch you discovered?
---
no they didnt crafted items still dot stack
---
How was PvE nerfed?
---
It’s a common glitch, try tagging for search and then I tagging, if not , server hop. It will eventually let you do it.
---
I second this
---
Or, I dunno, maybe actual lockpicks or something.  Just a thought.
---
No, near the vault 76, next to North Kanawha Lookout direct east next to a broken plane, has a steel and copper resource.
---
Buff Missile launchers, grenade launcher, Auto grenade launcher, Fat man launchers. 
---
basically the best ways to do so is lower the default weight of their respective ammo types AND to revert the change to demo expert perk back to the old increments. you guys already nerfed the explosive and two shot effects. as well as as gave the fire proof explosion resist.
---
Fallout 76 has a story, but it doesnt hold a match to the previous one, as the previous one didnt hold a match to the one before it.
---
Yes. LMGs need some sort of a buff :)
---
You have a point. Id like them to fix bugs and broken stuff AND give us new content. Surely they have plans for a raised cap and weapons, no? I think they need to speed those plans up.
---
You're welcome mate!
---
Currently, there isn't more info to share. The latest update is genuinely that the team is doing a lot of testing to determine the number for the stash limit that is just right in terms of server stability.
---
Rest assured though, r/fo76 will be informed when that number is determined, what exactly that number is, and when it'll be implemented.
---
Honestly 1500 is not that bad, with 7 vendors with independent loot you can sell 1400 worth of daily caps.
---
Here’s another one, the game is trash and the defenders of this game are even worse. Literally the definition of Stockholm syndrome. You wouldn’t know a good game if it slapped you across the face.
---
Not really. If you want 6 mutations you should just buy the mutations. The only reason to pay the recipies is to craft and sell mutations. if you don't want to do this then you don't need the recipes. 
---
by the way. some people already have the recipies and sell the serums from 100 to 500 caps. if you need 6 mutations it could also be a way to just get some the natural way. so if you get 2 mutations the natural way and buy 4 more for each 300 caps you will just spend 1200 caps instead of 19000 for a single self crafted serum (and you also don't need mats to craft it)
---
Also a point to think of: guys here sell crafted serums for 100 to 500 caps. how much serums would you need to craft to get the caps back for a 21.000 recipe? i guess it's not worth
---
You suck then..
---
I’m sorry, but Bethesda has given people plenty of warning to start switching up perk cards since their first couple “inside the vault” newsletters. It wasn’t in bold print obviously, but they still let people know that TSE were going to get a major nerf, I think they even let people know that it’ll just be straight useless come next patch (the one we got today). 
---
I get that the way they did it wasn’t the right way, because the mechanic plaguing the game was people stacking bobbleheads, magazines, and perk cards till they could one-shot people they weren’t even in active PVP with. At least with this HUGE nerf, the players start branching out to find a weapon set that can outmatch/counter the TSE weapon pool. Just how many fuckin explosives mains are people really rocking in 76?? (Not trying to push anyone down, just genuinely curious who’s insane enough to go for any explosive launcher and their ammo’s crazy huge toll on carry weight.) 
---
Same with the TSE light machine gun. It did 64 damage before but now it's nerfed down to 23 I think. The problem remains that these high level critters are simply too powerful which is why TSE's were so coveted. Now with this update we have to use more ammo and run back to get our junk bag after we get our asses handed to us.
---
Same I fixed it by taking rad c to get the 5 min timer and it came back after that had expired 
---
If you have just the needed amount of any item, say 12/12 springs, it won't let you craft either. You must have at least one extra. It's crazy, but it's always been this way. Maybe that's what you were running up against. 
---
Neither, when I first heard they can spawn with explosive, I was like "wtf how would that work", constant stream of explosion? I have doubt they will make something of it.
---
Still waiting for the  Tesla Rifle fix so that it no longer gives Ghouls, Mirelurks and whatnot the "Crash to Desktop" attack...
---
And of course that it is finally moved to the Energy-Section for crafting as its NOT a Heavy Weapon.
---
Don‘t say something like that. They‘ll just nerf PA to instant-break like regular armor
---
Hey mate, could you DM me your ticket number and a little more info on what happened?
---
But the toxic players aren't responding? I want to hear a genuine complaint. Something that cripples a game to the point the developers pull the plug. It's a bunch of false complaints. Most if not all have no  merit. It's a game. A really good one at that and a lot of players here keep shitting on it. It's a fun game. It isn't tailored to everyone but it is a fun game. Make reasonable request to the developers. Don't tell them they are doing a bad job.
---
Seeing that base glitch labeled an "exploit" actually made me mad. That inconvenienced the absolute shit out of me. I had to scrap every saved blueprint 19 times, then scrap each individual item--and this was a big base. It took me a few days because I had a good chance of a blue screen whenever I uncompiled a blueprint, or scrapped things too quickly, or the wind blew from the northeast, etc. But, sure, I'm sorry I exploited the game code by dating to *move my damn base.*
---
My reaction [https://imgur.com/K0A1GoJ](https://imgur.com/K0A1GoJ)
---
I found it on pc when the beta was on. It does work on xbox. Havent tried it on ps4.
---
I do pay attention, but the story in fallout 76 is very vague and rather disappointing. The concept is great, but the implication is bad. I played fallout 76 for several months, explored everything and hunted down as much lore as I could find in it. It's boring compared to the rest in my opinion.
---
I quit fallout 76 already and got rid of my copy of it because simply, it gets boring. 
---
It's cool when you complete the faction stuff and the enclave as a general, but it's always the sane exact things. It also feels like half the game is about making your base in different designs. 
---
They’re aware of the issue and are discussing it.. or something 
---
Does that include the overall Damage issues and the crash-to-desktop bug from tesla too?
---
If you enjoy the queen just respec to melee or get bloodied, this stuff is still viable melee is way stronger but bethesda could nerf it at anytime. Personally i dont want to put i the effort due to that possibility
---
E was broken. TS was fine. Ever try to VATs something with a two shot?
---
Haha good stuff
---
Has anyone seen Graham’s stock yet Iv seen a post long ago saying you could get it from his stock but it was rare so he might have it
---
In essence, the problem looks like this (if I understand correctly): currently all weapons, armor and other non-stacking things directly affect the performance of the server. It looks like a controversial technical decision, but it is. Moreover, so that players can craft items at any crafting station, after the first opening of stash, it virtually always remains open until the end of the gaming session. And this makes the game transfer more traffic and keep the server more data in memory.
---
So, why not disconnect stash from the crafting system? Let it be just a container that is available only when the player interacts with it. But make a separate mechanism that can store junk not as objects, but simply as a table with numbers. Access to it will be almost instantaneous and does not waste memory at all. Let craft stations take resources from there, and the player, when he scraps junk items, automatically places the materials in this table.
---
This will solve the problem of server stability (it will be unprofitable to keep resources in the stash when it is limited in size), but it will still force the player to “break up junk” at certain crafting stations in order to put it in a crafting bag.
---
I think thats where I have trouble. It feela more like a chore to play it now than an actual relaxing experience.
---
I'd like to see respec'ing immersive. Like a quest from the Enclave that resets your points at the end that opens at level 50.  Maybe a mutation, maybe they clone you, etc. That makes it accessible to everyone and doesn't require you to farm caps or atoms to do it.
---
Duping is back.
---
&gt;Patch bad bye is not criticism
---
Lol ok. Perhaps spend more time keeping the stickies relevant and less time pruning the conversation.

I'd much rather server hop than have a massive price increase this is dumb, all that was needed was a known tag. 
---
Hey we need to turn around you passed the"$&amp;@578" flips car over turning around
---
I can confirm that for the issues with energy weapons breaking fast, the dev team is working to address them in a future patch
---
For me it was weightless junk. I dont wanna drop brooms to make space for duct tape
---
You mean, like a buff? 
---
^ THIS!!!
---
They're poop now lol
---
If a low level was nearby the. They can spawn to their level Iv had that happen before.
---
Now people are complaing about Bobby pin... what is the next step... i wonder ;)
---
Oof, I could test it on ps4 and let you know if you feel comfortable messaging me in a PM on how i can check it. i would just like to see this fixed already so they can move on to more important shit like focusing on releasing content. 
---
Not a fan of censorship. Don't care for a refund though, got my money's worth.
---
There's a spot near West Tek. It's a cliff that has a gorgeous view. I go for views.
---
THAT is my biggest fear...
---
Or just a functioning QA dept. Like most big companies have...
---
I agree with you 100%, you will most likely get the toxic players downvoting your comments instead of posting an actual complaint or a reasonable rebuttal to your post. 
---
Maybe this game is not worth your skills as a modder. Use your talents on a game that deserves it!
---
Thanks mnidun - in my report I emphasized that heavy guns are the issue here
---
Imagine typing all of this because someone said they appreciate the work someone else does lol. 
---
The gloves are now added!!
---
Its the same on console. Maybe one in twenty use a mic...
---
Hey mate, are you experiencing this in the latest patch too?
---
"I have no idea how any of this works."
---
I think he means instead of 3 cards with  3 stars each to make it 60% that there should be 1 card with 5 stars at 60%
---
I would suggest sorting the "(Known) plans" at the end of the list.
---
As a player i am visiting a vendor to see what i don't have. so i would
---
prefer to have all the "(Known) " plans below the unknown
---
Thanks, but make sure they take a look at energy weapons as well, someone who uses them more heavily than me could explain the issues better than me but for the most part they also have damage and durability issues.
---
Dementia sucks 
---
Yea i know being a fury autimaticly losses you some credibility but i could give a shit about it and out of all the YT hate train and normal reviews i watched/listend to he did the best one imo
---
All damage is additive? Is it not rather something like:
---
Base damage x (1 + demo%) x (1 + adrenaline%) x (1 + nerd rage%) ... etc?
---
Best thing I read all day
---
It would destroy the game, but perhaps, that is the only way to save it.
---
Your problem is the 13 people. SBQ scales with the number of players in the fight and if some of them dont do enough damage because they just camp in the shed or have no idea about perks the fight drags on and cant be won.
---
Last year in december I had such a fight. We had so many TSEs with us, but a few low level people nearly screwed us. It took us 29 minutes to kill the queen.
---
On the other hand just last week I had a fight where we were just two people fighting the queen. We killed her in 10 minutes. TSEs were definitely too strong. The SBQ is not supposed to be killed by two people.
---
Yeah, it was too powerful the way it was. Now, as far as why they have left some of the upper tier melee weapons alone I do not understand.
---
Venders 
---
Is there a plan to have weapons break at a slower rate? I am all for realistic wear and tear on weapons but some of my guns simply break too quickly and that's after repairing with the Weapons Artisan perk.
---
And yet, the idea of a test server is to detect these things before they hit the general population. It is a suggestion that would spare most of the players the kind of problem we just encountered. 
---
Our crew can still kill her in 1-2 mins. 
---
You just need a better build 
---
I feel the sentiment. I want new content too but the bugs and stability has to be improved first. This game is such a mess I don’t even know where to start fixing it honestly.
---
rip everyone who scrapped it before noticing that you needed it to craft another
---
Lol okay, if you found away around the glitch without only carrying 5 cells, i would love to see that. 
---
As a Fallout fan I’m reeaaally trying to continue playing your game Bethesda, but you’re making it more and more quit-able. This patch ruined explosives and normal armor..
---
Yea u have been having the same issue and I don't understand it. Game doesn't dip below 100fps for me. Fov is set to 94. I get some horrendous headaches. I have never in my life been prone to headaches from video games. It is strange to me. 
---
Better to ready for this. It does seem very likely.
---
Yes, people talk about it.. it's a absolutely no-go. Unless everybody is on Discord and follow orders blindly..
---
hey at least you are a raider
---
while i agree that it takes time, this is an issue that shouldnt have been in the game at all.
---
an entire section of equipment is unusable because of several problems, i wouldnt call that a minor issue like "bobby pin weight" or the "lever action animation". no, these are major problems that damage the gameplay.
---
Tesla Rifles cause a crash to desktop since release when you hit certain enemies with it (and they hit you back). This is not a small cosmetic issue, this is gamebreaking. i wonder if you can even abuse it to crash other players.
---
Energy Weapon Damage and Durability can be "hotfixed" easily. Increasing a single number for "damage per shot" isnt hard and doesnt require major reworks. Same with durability. It takes just a few minutes to rewrite those things.
---
Seriously, if we would be able to mod this mess, the community would have fixed those things in the first week!
---
I think that the main problem is, that the core is broken. The current problems are the result of a decision that was made years ago: To make a multiplayer game by using the old engine instead of a modern one. Nobody can fix the problems today, not a different management team and not more capacity in the development.
---
Well let’s see. Very common feedback was having known plans shown as known, having a more reliable way to get plans from vendors, and not being able to accidentally scrap mods. Do you think the fixes to these issues just happened to occur to them or do you think it was fixed because of feedback provided and collected by community managers?
---
I mean, look at the B.E.T.A.
---
A few hours a couple days a week?  Just enough time for players to have some fun and find a few bugs, but not nearly enough time for them to realize just how broken it actually was.
---
I think the point was is that it is a premium service. Yes, it's a good feature, but you're required to pay for it. 
---
"Im sure its fun for all true fallout fans''
---
LMFAO. So if you dont like this game you're not a true fallout fan. I don't even know where to start with this stupid statement. And are you the president of the FO fan club or something? Why you speaking for all of us. 
---
This is quite possibly the shittest post i've ever seen in 6 years of reddit. A helluva achievement mate.
---
It was always their intention to have a player based economy. But the problem is that the only way to really communicate what you want to sell/buy/craft is with mic chat, and we all know that it is not very common. There needs to be a simpler way. 
---
considering those items provide no bonuses to start with and they come from the atom shop i do not think they will do such a thing. 
---
however i would enjoy a silver SMG paint job to fit in with the costume
---
Tell me about it. Every day - EVERY day - I made my trip to all seven vendors, selling the maximum amount. I was sitting on about 21,000 caps, which I laughingly admitted was more than I could ever possibly spend on anything, and collecting them was really just a small hobby for me at this point. 
---
Then today's patch drops and within a few hours I'm down to 600 caps, but I know a LOAD of plans I didn't before. No regrets. 
---
Go back to latestagecapotalism or politics or whatever hole you crawled out of. 
---
What happened with the patch?? I thought it had a lot of good fixes etc??
---
Place all your junk in your stash and try again
---
Buddy, my numerous builds and 1000s of hours in the game would like a chat with ya.
---
Short version.
---
DS1, stunlocking and backstab fishing
---
DS2, hexes alone
---
DS3, darksword before nerf, plenty of other shit after
---
And of course they were so proactive about removing the ‘Thanks for gud patch’ threads in the past that were oh so constructive.
---
Bethesda asked for suggestions on quest rewards people would like. I think a weekly/bi/monthly quest that increases your vendor caps limit for 3-7 days would be a quest worth doing.
---
Idea is, say for end game players the quest reward starts a 7 day timer where on the first day all vendor factions have 1000 caps each, second day 900 caps each, and so on until you're back down to the 200 caps per day per vendor. Then a cool down period starts where that quest cannot either randomly start or be triggered to run again for a bit.
---
This would give people a chance to make more rewarding caps runs for a few days every so often.
---
Their only intentionn is for you to pay for "cap stashes", in the near future, very likely.
---
I certainly (and genuinely) hope you have fun playing what you play next
---
I love MMOs. I love the loot grind, I love colllecting weapons and armor, finding the best things, fighting dungeon bosses over and over until I get the items I want. Farming the same mobs over and over to get the rare crafting material, to make some of the highest level crafting recipe items, to sell for hundreds or thousands of gold etc. It's not that I can't put in effort to do something, but there's no motivation. It's just a tedious chore in this game. And the loot is just a lottery. I like farming routine like collecting cap stashes. I just learned a new one the other day, and suddenly it's been messed up. I just don't see any logic in it. To slow me and others who like to do it down? Why slow us down? Why target the probably small number of people who enjoy doing that? What if it's the only thing they enjoy  in the game? Why take that away? I just don't get it. By the way thinking about all of this reminded me of this. If you're interested it's a kind of funny series about a NPC in a MMO.

---
If it’s what happened to me go into your stash and place your junk in there you have on u. then try to do what you want. It sometimes doesn’t register what you have in your stash or if they are in separate place
---
SBQ does not die on seconds to TSE, source literally did her over 80 minutes last week, had a lot of high levels and we only got that shit through a bug where she didn't leave on time.
---
The duped bobbleheads stacking is presumably what allowed people to dunk on her so hard.
---
That must have been quite the relief! 
---
My point exactly. I haven't had any of these problems to the point that the game is crippled for me. What's an "over nerf"? What was over nerfed? I rather enjoy the treasure maps. What was your point there? I've never seen nor have been effected by duped weapons. Armor/caps/meds/etc what? Poor optimization what? The game runs fine for me. What perks are currently not working properly? I haven't seen it. I am curious. Ghost camp items? I had this happen but I was able to fix it on my own. Please go on.
---
This, pretty much. Don’t shoot the messenger. Life can’t be that great to read fucking shitty shit all day, I hate it just scrolling through the sub for a day.
---
It’s hard to say. Some of the things we ask for sound simple enough, but in reality is more complicated. 
---
Seems like the dev team is under a lot of pressure from management and a furious fanbase. I imagine the team is overworked and morale at the office is low. 
---
I’m sure they have plans to roll out new content, but they are focusing their efforts on prolonging the tedium of grinding resources to mask the fact that there is little substantial content in this game. Rather than focusing on pvp rebalancing and other glaring problem, they rework quests and xp gains; things players didn’t complain about at all. 
---
So to your point, with the eventual rollout of DLC, there likely will be a raise to level cap and weapons. I just think the last thing this game needs right now is a poorly implemented DLC that breaks 10 more things and fixes nothing. 
---
Xbox. T51B. Same thing for the bright head lamp I have on it. 
---
You literally called them bots dude. Stop pretending you’re anywhere near the high road. 
---
We are aware of this issue and the next patch should greatly decrease melee damage to match all the other useless weapons.
---
It's the "Fortnite" effect on devs and publishers these days. They all started drooling over the reoccurring revenue and raced to make a game to do the same thing.
---
Me thinks it's time to crawl back into my single player game cave...
---
Dear sneaky pete
---
Please put this x-01 jetpack on my x-01 torso for me
---
There's a few which sell the plans for calibrated shocks for the excavator. Camden Park, Welsh and Grafton. 
---
agreed, i had to store away my 3\* fatman due to the demo expert nerf. 6 pounds for a single mini nuke that deals 600ish instead of near 900 or 1000 with rank 4 demo expert is just not worth the effort (luck-ally mine is reduced weight.)
---
I am very worried if this is possible at all. If a private server is just a button in a game that creates a new game server instance on the servers of the Bethesda, and the mods are installed via the Creation Club, then their choice will be very limited. Some modes that fixed complex bugs or greatly modified the game often required Script Extender. There is a suspicion that now it is also necessary to patch the server, and not just the client.
---
And that means that Bethesda must give server binary files to the community so that it can be run locally. I could have expected this from a small indie studio, but this is not our case.
---
Quited end of last year, too boring... 
---
Nerfing a reward item into oblivion isn't a good way to make a game more challenging. Alternative make a area in the game more difficult for the people that did grind for these rare items.  A area more constant than sbq. 
---
This happens all the time also ash heap has them from the mining machines
---
Hey there! The team is definitely aware of this suggestion. I understand it's been a common concern with players
---
Inner you smell your own farts with how condescending and full of yourself you are. 
---
Anytime, man
---
Just remember, I love and appreciate you community managers. ❤️

 &gt; Hey there! The team is definitely aware of this suggestion. I understand it's been a common concern with players
---
Thank you. I've font that now. Wasn't sure how t send pm so took a while 
---
Yeah it was a plan
---
No idea what you're talking about. There are complete areas, Whitesprings for example, which are literally unplayable due to lag. Crashed 2 times in an hour, too.
---
My experiences is players only want what is best for them not for the game. 
---
Cool! 
---
All TSE will become collector items.
---
Well, it's true that SWL was a reboot of TSW but because of that we got all the way until Tokyo super fast, and then it wasn't even 3 months we got the final stages of Kaidan, like the Kaidan lair and the first zone of SA. After that yeah they stopped pretty bad until the release of Dark Agartha, that's why I left the game. 
---
I really hope FO76 doesn't go along that road too.
---
When I click the links, nothing happens.
---
True that Homie, #giveourdramakings/queenswhattheywant When do we want it? THE MOMENT WE WRITE IT ON THE PAGE MFER. #instantgratification
---
It was a matter of time when the first TSE baby relises that his perk-deck sucks.
---
Hey mate - I am not too sure but regardless I'll let the team know about it. If you submit a support ticket too that would be really helpful in logging the bug too [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
I am willing to pay a reasonable amount for this even in the form of a subscription. If the game will develop, of course. Yesterday's patch made a little doubt, to be honest, but I still hope that things will get better.
---
When my loot disappeared from the map i logged off and back in. Which fixed the pip-boy issue. 
---
Hopefully the loot didn’t just disappear and made someone happy.
---
It's sad that you all still playing this game
---
Probably has something to do with them really hating the state of the game upon release and just wanting Bethesda to suffer for it.
---
That, or they just wanna cause chaos because this is the internet. As if that's something new. Out of hundreds of posts, I saw like maybe five mentioning duping being back - and nothing concrete 
---
I dont get what i just watched? You put on too many hard hats and it killed your framerate? Or what did i miss?
---
Im adding to your list that chad (Camden Park) also sells Excavator mods.
---
same. can you imagine how disapointed i was when i found my first "Charging Laser Sniper", and it was not charging, not a sniper, and dealt less damage than my pipe pistol?
---
Not to mention that piles were still broken when i last checked.
---
Speak for yourself. I have played every single day since launch, and several days of the beta, and I just got my first "calibrated shocks" mod two days ago. The first EVER. I am more than happy to drop whatever number of caps I need to if it means I can have the ability to craft a mod whenever I need or want to if it means I don't then have to spend another two and a half months dancing with the RNG. 
---
So all the time. Spent for my heavy weapon explosive build was wasted thanks Bethesda, unistalling right now 
---
I’m genuinely happy for you. I love the idea of this game but the reality is most people have problems that at the very least make general gameplay frustrating.
---
An over nerf is exactly what it sounds like. Over nerfing. The explosive legendary effects and the explosive perk card were over nerfed. So was the armor rating on power armor.
---
My point was that people have duped hundreds of thousands of treasure maps because they’re weightless.
---
You have seen duped weapons. Many, many people use them either by having duped them themselves and having bought them, and it doesn’t matter if they haven’t affected you. You’re asking why WE think the game is crippled.
---
Armor, caps and meds have been duped.
---
The game has poor optimisation. Any area with anything decent going on such as nuke zones, whitesprings etc is laggy. Uusally about 30 FPS on a 1080, 16gb of ddr4 2133mhz ram and an i5 7600.
---
Ghost camp items were a huge problem for some time and had no fix. I was completely unable to build properly because I had 144 water purifiers that were not placeable or scrappable until the patch that fixed wayyyyy after the patch that introduced it.
---
Anything else?
---
How is this not obvious to these people? Are you guys new to gaming? Im always amazed at people defending any aspect of pay to win gaming. Shooting themselves in the foot, and happy to do it. FFS. 
---
Its a sad fact that games development is still stuck in qn amateur mindset compared to consumer software.
---
The mining helmets, they changed colors like 3 times
---
But how many people were successful in server hoping for that stuff? EXAMPLE: Pheonix carries,  plans for T60, T51 and T45 jet packs. 
---
If you server hopped for hours... and hours... and hours... the chances of finding ONE OF THOSE is small.
---
'
---
But during that time, you'd only see one of them. So there's a low chance that you will see a jet pack at all, and an even lower chance that ***it will be the one that you are actually looking for.***
---
A friend of mine server hopped the Watoga vendor looking for T60 jet pack plans for many hours.   
---
He found the T45 plans instead. 
---
The chances of finding it were so low that the mod may as well have not existed at all. 
---
18400 with 20 charisma i aint gonna buy that.
---
Visit the vendors at Welsh station, Camden Park, or that big building in Grafton (not the train station, but the one in town). They all sell plans and mods for the excavator. 
---
lol sure people that liked using the TSE weapons were the problem. Get your head out your ass mate.
---
They haven't said "it will be. It's definite."
---
WIth everyone saying NO, don't, Bethesda would be a cu... to do it like that
---
Perhaps done to reduce the time exploit users have to abuse an exploit while they wait for their system to be patched. If I had to take a guess it's probably a result of past exploits being abused massively when they're about to be patched and that would impact performance a lot too.
---
I prob would too, tbh. I dunno about a lot of other ppl tho. Lol
---
True, All Rise is pretty good and easy to get, but it doesn't make the scorchbeasts to land, sometimes I wondered if it could be thrown at them so they would stop that annoying screeching :)
---
That was a fucking demo, not a beta. They literally didnt test shit.
---
But I mean, they're so expensive! You're going to have to do all kinds of grinding in order to earn any of them. Surely that's worth something! 
---
The atom store is not the problem. It is needed to keep the game getting new content. Its also how they always have promoted it. So nothing wrong with that (besides stupid objects like princess beds)
---
They do however have to start putting people in place that know what they are doing. Especially the teamleaders. Im sure lots of designers and programmers over there are being hold back by bad leadership. And if they dont have the knowledge than look for people who are able to fix it (modders for example)
---
They’re significantly less common, with dupers selling complete sets on eBay for rather princely sums (for digital items at least). 
---
The stacking of damage reduction perks needs to simply be capped across the board or allow the armor piercing perks/mods to ignore the legendary effects. 
---
I have no information on this but is it possible that character levels and perk builds will be shared but not hear such as weapons, armor, caps?
---
&gt;Mining helmets are changing colors and hard hats are always green even if you pick up a red or yellow one
---
 Mining helmets are changing colors and hard hats are always green even if you pick up a red or yellow one 
---
I fired up poseidon this morning after the patch, was still getting lots of fusion cores stacked up in the generator.  Not reduced to .8/hr.
---
It worked - just saw your PM
---
Endlessly grinding for materials and caps while continuously dealing with a barrage of nerfs is not fun. It is a great set up for a pay-to-win scenario, tho. Even worse, a pay-to-remotely-enjoy, scenario. If they continue down this path, and I mean even one more step, i'm back to FO4 untill s better RPG is available.
---
We appreciate you for being so damn amazing 
---
I have a feeling with all the feedback about this that they may change their minds. But who knows. 
---
How much for the right arm?
---
I haven’t played 76 in a few weeks. About the time my quests had me going either south or east of the Ash Heap and I found I was grossly underlevelled and pretty much unbothered about grinding levels. 
---
With this patch, I’m done. I can’t be bothered. I really enjoyed my time with 76, despite its bugs/flaws. But I can’t be bothered to go back to a buggier state. I’ve got plenty of games to keep me busy (Resi 2... omg), so I’ll wait patiently for the game to be fixed completely before I return to it
---
And if it never gets fixed? Well I didn’t buy the game, someone bought it for me, so all I’ve lost is time. 
---
As one annoying kid learned. It dosen't matter how strong your melee attack is. As long as I can back up and stay out of melee range I can still kill you with a 10mm pistol. 
---
I also doubt you are supposed to be able to wear 10 hard hats at the same time
---
21:9, same thing... 
---
Nope bust still looking 
---
I know of two friends who won’t come back no matter what. So I am a solo player now :(
---
I'm there same way on PS4. I can make it in to the game sometimes, but will end freezing. Completely unplayable.
---
Totally, but the one i played the most was that one with the Olympic Games, also that "prototype jumper" that Nintendo transformed on Mario Bros. 
---
I have to do some digging so I can remember all other ones i had and sadly sold a long time ago :)
---
Why nerf White Knight? Fix the rapid condition drain that is the problem.
---
It still bothers me that I was unable to refund this terrible game. :/ 
---
Not to mention their sonic attack can go through solid walls in some houses. That is not okay. 
---
This one was already a bug before the patch
---
The animation has been going off for me non stop since i logged in, and i dont have it. and when i say non stop, i mean non stop. It hasnt stopped. and my performance slowly degrades because of it until i have to restart.
---
Schrodingers mining helmet is because it's red  and yellow and blue all at the same time.
---
I don't feel like that's true.  I personally want everyone to be equally valuable, no matter their build.  If someone wants to punch mutants in the face with a power fist or quick draw with a pistol, they should be able to perform equally well to a player with a super sledge or sniper rifle. I invest a LOT of perks to deal heavy hits in stealth at the sacrifice of carry weight and defense. When you can vet 24 reasonable players that take the time to submit resumes/applications, I think that the results are very good.  These are players that love the game enough to want to contribute to the future welfare of the community.  The Council wasn't grabbing bums off the street to ask if tallboys of Icehouse were too expensive.
---
Eh only bonus private servers give would be resource farming. A lot easier to keep ballistic fiber stock up if only competition is a couple of friends 
---
Patches and updates are meant to better the game and fix issues. So why is it that this company can't get it right? Their last patch brought back old issues. I don't mind that they nerfed Tse but why nerf whitespring? It was fun killing the ghouls and collecting treasure. They did it because epeople complained. Everyone will switch to Meelee then they're nerf that, because people will complain. They try to appeal the few instead of making the game better and releasing content for EVERYONE to enjoy. That is where they are failing. That is why people are leaving.
---
So you want game breaking issues? Multiple freezes or disconnect in a couple of hours of game play.
---
New patches that bring back old issues. 
---
Now you have to unbulk junk to craft and repair them then rebulk to save space. You're wasting a shit load of plastic now.
---
The grinding time isn't worth the effort. Even with a group after this nerf, the SBQ hardly can be shot down in the limit required. This is worse when you have people in the area that don't know what they're doing. Meelee builds can't be effective 8f she doesn't land often, and she one hits them to death easily.
---
Anytime I move my camp I have to and delete a hundred of duplicated items. It makes my stash over 300% for some reason and it's annoying. 
---
I waste 1000 rounds of ammo and break weapons for what during the SBQ? 
---
And because of that, I'm not getting good loot from my time to find plans to make ammo needed to really do damage against her (ultracite) 
---
While there isn't one or two things that make this a bad game, all of this adds up. This is not a game that is enjoyable because of the bugs. Because this company wants to appease the few. It's like having a kid constantly poking you in the arm. Eventually you tire of it and move somewhere else.
---
Tl;Dr: just because there isn't one thing that breaks the game, everything adds up and that's why ppl are pissed and moving on
---
You're the one who would give the most rare weapon to a duper for a $1000 scam. Even if he paid he could charge it back.
---
Yeah there's some bug that locks up the game if you open pip boy before stuff loads. Was happening before yesterday
---
Yup have mentioned energy weapons too.
---
In terms of durability - I know that many have had issues with energy weapons breaking quickly. What I can confirm is that the team is working to address this in a future update. More info will be shared when it's available
---
The Secret World sucked me in like no franchise since Fallout, I was so devastated that Funcom gave us nothing with the relaunch :(
---
At least we say a tiny bit of South Africa :)
---
And what background do you have to gaming development and community management? Oh you're just some random jill/joe off the streets with nothing but complaints? Ok. "GAME DEVS DIDNT GET MEMO ON WHERE THE GAME IS GOING, FIRE THEM ALL &gt;:("
---
I would assume it's not fixed. As it still works on xbox and pc.
---
They wouldnt fix it for just one platform.
---
Oh no big brained redditor told me my heads up my ass!! Im gonna cry now 😭😭😭
---
Played for 4 hours yesterday. What mess?
---
Can't wait for another "White Knight" to keep defending all of the BS Beth is pulling when their version of loot boxes hit the us. Hell, I hope you spend all your money trying to keep Beth in the market(and miserably failing). It's people like you that enable them to even consider doing shit like that in the first place. I bet you own every single item available from The "Creation Club".
---
The trade off with using explosive weapons is ammo cost and weight. With regular guns you don't really need the perks to reduce ballistic ammo weight, or at least I never have. You most definitely need the additional perks to reduce weight of explosive ordinances if you rely on those. You'll probably also want 2 ranks in Grenadier as well to be comparable with how guns get aiming and head-shot bonuses.  
---
That puts you at 10 points between Strength, Perception, and Intelligence to actually be able to be an effective explosive weapon (and by extension grenades) build.
---
On top of all of that, I'm pretty sure a ballistic gun user can use an explosive legendary variant and add damage with Demo expert as well. If that's the case, with the 8 points into an explosive handgun you can three perks at 2\* for 45% plus 2\* 30% to the explosive damage instead of maxing out any of the cards at all. Tons of options.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Thats true, im not sure how they implemented fixes for consoles and pc i figured it would be different since they perform them on seperate days but ill take your word for it.
---
Yeah? Well, *I* can spot hyperbole.
---
Already have. Just waiting for a good one to come along and replace Fallout.
---
Ghoul slayers baton
---
I still can't complete one of the first quests given to me and I am level 106
---
I know I won't get an answer, but not for the reasons you mentionned.
---
Those members I tagged are community manager and/or support workers. They are neither the devs, nor the responsibles or deciding whatever.
---
They do an amazing job at communicating with us. People on Reddit frequently forget that this is NOT the official forum of Bethesda, and that for this reason nobody from Bethesda has to answer anything here.
---
Seeing those employees taking the time to come on this acid-hate fueled forum to check on our feedback, tell us they share it with whoever is in charge and confirm what is or isn't working upon is a VERY good thing, when I compare with other game where the support/dev/community NEVER answered. At all.
---
But aside to this, you have to understand that those are employees of Bethesda. They are probably not allowed to express anything AGAINST their company, which also means they cannot admit "there was a mistake here" or "yeah we did fucked up that release" without express consent and strategical discussions internally.
---
That's also why they always seem in a good mood when half the fucktards of this sub acts as entitled brats. They still take time to say "thanks for the feedback" instead of "OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AWARE OF THAT, THE WHOLE NET SPEAKS ABOUT IT". That's being a profesionnal.
---
I tagged them because I'm mean, but I'm pretty sure they already read this sub a few times. I'm even pretty sure some of them agree with us, because the better the quality of the dev/teamleads, the easier their job is.
---
I always downvote you though, sorry :(
---
The new patch has caused quite an uproar I am pleased that they nerfed TSE weapons. Although I think the Nerf itself was a bit Overkill but it was needed. but from my understanding the patch change the game back to a former version / build. Which in turn caused a lot of return bugs. A subreddit has several posts about it if you just scroll through. 
---
I was wondering why there were less people roaming around complaining about everything, huh.
---
&gt; Look,  Bethesda, if you're going to allow some dork with a plasma weapon to  turn the Scorchbeast Queen into a puddle of goo, could you at least make  sure it's a big puddle, so we can find it to loot?
---
QFT
---
Glad your game is running smooth. You have to remember that your experience is not the same as everyone else's. People aren't going to too kindly to your broad statement that the servers are better after the patch because that's not the case for everyone. I suggest you add "for me" to the end of your title or something like that
---
game devs havent learned this lesson since 1999
---
they never will cause they dont play their games themselves....
---
Same here. There was a dodgy looking power armor bug for a while where people entering or exiting their power armour would appear naked and deformed. That seems to have been squashed now.
---
Yeah like when I grinded for weeks in Eve Online for my Hulk. Or when I grinded for weeks for the full set of Defias armor, and Scarlet Crusade armor. Or my Raid and PvP Arena sets. So instant. There's a reason why Eve and WoW have been so successful all these years, and it's far from instant gratification. It's rewarding and enjoyable gameplay. Instead of disappointment after disappointment. Oh wow I just defeated a Scorchbeast. What did it drop? Nothing. Just killed a bunch of super mutants. 2 short rifles. 24 ammo. 6 caps. Etc. Just killed 3 star legendary. What did it drop? 1 star autostim wood leg. Just killed another. What did it drop. 1 star rolling pin. Dayum we getting those epic loots boiz.
---
I figured it was to catch people with huge carry weights plus stashes with their pants down. 
---
No no. That was a beta, and called so upon all channels, and people here claim to have been here "since beta". Don't try to pretend it was a demo.
---
It doesn't change the fact the game should have been tested more, or that a professional team of testers should have been hired, or that it should have been released end 2019. 
---
But it was NOT a demo. People were, at some level, supposed to send feedback on issues instead of grinding xp and loot. 
---
The TS/E nerfs were warranted but I absolutely don't understand their approach to fixing them via thr Demo Expert/Bobblehead thing. Why is it still possible to stack all other bobbleheads if that was clearly needed to curb exploiters, why is Demo Expert brought back in line without looking at the weapons it affects. 
---
I feel like the intentions are good but the execution is totally scattered and therefore messy.
---
Yeah i ve had this one also, but that’s not the case here.
---
Died in a nuke zone by getting out of PA (my bad, case of stupid finger), and when i respawned i was not able to use the pip-boy.
---
Which means i wasn’t able to put my PA (or use pretty much anything) on and get my loot back
---
Shouldn't it be impossible to scrap power armor frames at all like with legendary weapons? I know people that accidentally scrapped their PA frames and armor it contained.
---
Either that or require that the armor plates need to be removed before scrapping power armor frames.
---
I'm not speaking for all Fallout fans. I am saying the game isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be.  It isn't what we all expected and I think that is true. Even for me.  But it is what it is and it is still a good Fallout game. I didn't enjoy Fallout New Vegas as much as I did Fallout 3. Does that mean I'm not a true Fallout fan? Some would argue. I know. "True Fallout fans" probably wasn't the correct term. There is a split in the fallout community and I did fail to recognize that in my post. Sorry.
---
Dude, I can't wait for your post when u run out of ammo after the bullet sponges absorbe it all...sure, sounds like fun. U could always switch to melee, tho.
---
anyone who liked this troll post is an asshole lol.
---
Yu don't get out much do you.
---
I vote for John Henry Eden
---
Are you kidding? Problems that were reported during the beta have yet to be fixed, and you blame the gamers? We were given severely limited time to actually access the beta--far less time than would have been needed for any kind of thorough testing--and that's not Bethesda's fault?
---
Resin (Ski Resort near Top of the World) sells all Raider Powerarmor plans.      
---
      
---
Chad (Camden Park) sells Excavator plans.
---
Because they are myopic.
---
Ohhh that sucks. May have happened to me before. I get my bugs mixed up. Funny and sad too. Lol
---
Seems like the mod deleted your post. Shill operation damage control.
---
Not much would change with new characters anyway.
---
The servers are so small, that you will rarely encounter other players, unless you visit the known hotspots.
---
So leveling wouldnt feel different from the normal game. Sure you could grind in normal mode, but does it matter? A Melee doesnt need to be legendary to oneshot a player. Even non-legendary Rifles can oneshot players from Stealth.
---
Not to mention that after one or two weeks the situation would be the same as it is now. People would find  their meta weapon of choice, and thats it.
---
This "Survival" is hardly survival. Its just the same game again with open pvp, pretty much just the other "design decision" they could have chosen for the first release.
---
u/the_lonestranger
---
Can you post your comment again ?
---
It doesn't show up for me
---
They need something to spam complaints over minor issues
---
Nothing quest critical is behind more than a L0 lock. I've yet to find anything particularly exciting in an L3 safe.
---
Haven't bothered with lockpick cards in my latest char. 
---
Yeah, same here, kinda disliked the simpler setup of SWL but I adapted quickly. But then we waited like forever for all the dungeons being selectable as elites, not only some, and the eternal wait for SA big zone was way too much for me, I didn't even log for the Xmas event.
---
TSW was the best MMO game I played hands down, the immersion and storyline was simply awesome, and the investigation missions were superb at first, before all the answers were on guide websites. It was truly a great idea and a great game, but when Devs started leaving, it took a great toll and it was reflected in the simpler updates. Really sad.
---
But at least it lasted some years. Maybe there are big updates still coming, haven't uninstalled the game yet ;)
---
We've definitely seen the feedback and concerns about the changes to white knight. Rest assured, the dev team has been made aware.
---
Indeed it does... and it seems like there are a lot more bugs seems the update. My inventory and carry weight are acting up big time
---
Git gud was being used in irony. Is your brain 8 sided dice?
---
A community manager is there to collect feedback from the users, as well as provide information (if they can) on the topic at hand. 
---
How would you work properly without being able to contact your interlocutor?
---
Shill. Operation damage control.
---
I rerolled bloodied melee so dw about me 
---
"This is a gross level of unforgivable incompetence" Is this meant to be ironic? Honestly? A few things get nerfed for the greater good and you act as if they've literally pissed in your face. Get out once and a while, Jesus Christ, you sound unstable.

---
I like how people with no experience in the business ,are making demands like this lol. This is a great troll post, but the fact that so many people took the bait, yikes.
---
The damage control accounts are in place.
---
It's due to the fact they nerfed weapons too hard and buffed the Queen's DR.  That's the reason.
---
You could argue that they were constructive, only insofar as they sparked controversy and snarky comments
---
No one cares if you announce that you’re leaving the game forever. “Okay, bye! You won’t be missed” Copy/paste x100 
---
It's called sarcasm- you should watch that film.
---
yes, you're right, should have written "kill stuff unarmed"
---
Double shot explosive was OP in pve allowing quick kills and damn near instant kills in pvp. 
---
They address that so you aren't almost literally 2 shot hitting end game mobs. And rebalancing it to allow for Pvp to develop and not just be instant death fights over who pulls trigger fast enough. 
---
But rather then talk about over all game balance improvements they simply complain about how they are personally effected because they can't two shot most mobs now.
---
Actually it's pretty good now, has an active modding community (unlike Bethesda who banned modders from FO76 -&gt; https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/fallout-76-players-banned-over-mods ) , private servers and regular DLC expansions without not-so-micro transactions.
---
All these visionaries and experts in the reddit. They should just turn the game over to the sub right?
---
Just curious what are your thoughts on bloodied/unyielding combo?
---
Except my TSE handmade still puts out double the damage of a non-legendary handmade at the same level. It's definitely not useless
---
Those were broken builds man. Theorycrafting in this game isn't hard. If your that hung up on one build Then after 50 the fun really falls off.
---
hold up, scorchbeasts are hard for you ? :(
---
Tell me lies...
---
Also add with the current disease you can contract, terminal illnesses from prolonged radiation exposure which ultimately kills your player and requires you too start from the beginning.
---
I was dead set on buying 76 a week after launch but then after all the bad press etc I’ve decide to wait for updates to be released. By the sounds of this though I lll be waiting a lot longer before the 76 we all want will be here. 
---
I’ll keep lurking here waiting for good news to come .
---
prefer trade, if not offer?
---
Inside of buildings like watoga city hall it “lags” out very very often. Close to unplayable :( it’s not 100% gone outside but it only happens really rare and it doesn’t feel that annoying. Could it be a bug with reflections on glass or water? Or is my overclocked hardware the problem? It drives me crazy :(
---
All Rise is the only weapon to have it and if you swap it out for a heating coil, it's gone. But yeah only having slightly higher damage than the regular sledge doesn't justify the lack of mods
---
It is already known that we fail to save the wasteland. See Fallout 1-4. 😃 stupid prequels...
---
They should have never had to overhaul the engine when their parent company (zenimax) designed the engine for elder scrolls online.
---
NO. 
---
It's called power creep, and it sucks.
---
Are you saying the people who bashed FO76 on release might ... possibly ... have been correct in the their predictions ?
---
Heavy gun damage is too low for gun's weight and the ammo expended, and energy weapons break so quickly that you might as well consider their ammo to include the cost of repairing them.
---
I've seen complaints but no proof. One thing I have learned is to disregard complaints without proof or personal experience.  Particularly with this game. As this point if Bethesda sneezes they would blame a flu out break in this game. And for nearly a month the stupid idea the game was going f2p was pushed around like a fact.
---
Ffs make the perks stronger and maybe buff weapons so I wont need 300 rounds to kill a super mutant
---
Yes, and if you're in camp or a train station that isn't a problem. But now, imagine trying to capture and build up a workshop before it has a stash box available and all your steel is both bulked and in stash. You have to do a bunch of traveling before you can even begin to build defenses or even a stash box. Then you have to break up anything else you need to build the workshop.
---
It's a massive headache once. After that, I pulled 100% of the junk out of my stash, broke apart what I planned to keep, and put most of it back again.  Got into the habit of bulking everything because it was easier to keep an eye how much weight things were taking up and it was ready to sell the moment I wanted it gone.
---
Loot boxes in games are here to stay. I agree it shouldn't be a thing but that is the inevitable future for games. As much as we as gamers don't like it. It is here. I don't like it myself but I as a gamer except it. There is nothing we can do other than stop gaming or not purchase to win. And no I do not own everything from the creation club. Just a few things. White Knight out.
---
TSE aren't OP, everything else but Melee was garbage
---
You guys are ALWAYS saying this and then nothing happens. If anything, the complete opposite is happening than what the community wants. I realize this is not your fault, it is just tiresome, to always see this same message and then see the complete opposite in the patch notes and in the game....
---
They are for a lot of people. I personally have dense chest so I can just stand there and take their attacks like it's nothing. I'm primarily melee. I can kill them fast if I don't have to have 8 fucking weight reducing perks equipped.
---
Same here, my tamborine hits like a train compared to my Quad Explosive pump action shotgun! 
---
Keep loosing slot 4 also
---
I have another doubt guys. What would happen if i die filled of radiations but withount any rad-away or likely ? Will i spawn with very low healt ? There is a limiti about that ?
---
I finally managed to pick them up at watoga thanks. I picked up two incorrect versions early in the game, that turned out to be switches.
---
I'm dying.
---
I call bullshit on that cause my TSE hadmade that dealt 1k dmg per shot used 1.5k ultracite ammo 
---
Why on earth do I need more than 25000 caps?
---
Stop using 1 star damage perk cards
---
Are you surprised people are uninstalling? If you're happy that people are moving on away from this game, good for you. Enjoy the repeated cycle of inventory management, bugs, poor AI pathing, constant blanket nerfs and rng loot. Less people in Appalachia = less money for Bethesda, but hey, I bet you think it's healthy for the game.
---
This game is constantly more than 50% off on different retailers within 76 days of launch because there's not a lot of new demand, and even this r/FO76 subreddit (most people here didn't listen when the reviews came out bad and we kept playing) now has about as much complaint threads as regular r/fallout or the official game forums (where they're deleting threads complaining about the patch). The community managers themselves have been acknowledging the game studio's own bugs &amp; blunders.
---
That's not what i said at all.
---
Don't nerf things *until they're useless and no fun to use.*
---
Nerfs are okay. You just dont want to nerf things too much because they're one of two or three only viable options.
---
You want to make other things viable so people aren't just using TSE, or Super Sledges.
---
About that sense of urgency: yesterday I was out exploring some abandoned buildings, reading notes and stuff, when suddenly SCORCHBEAST! 
---
Few things generate urgency and decentivises exploration better than a fricking mutant bat the size of a small passenger jet, who can see *and* hurt you through walls. 
---
Try revolvers man... Thank me later.. seriously
---
Suddenly my t60 is showing  “mothman red” as its headlamp and also has acquired the atom shop symbol. So much has been fubar with this patch. 
---
Could do that,  but lose your legendaries. 
---
Lol no dude got carried
---
I used to blow threw 1.5-2k ultracite ammo with a 1k dmg per shot tse auto handmade
---
Exactly.  This is on Bethesda and Bethesda only. They should be absolutely ashamed of the product they have put out.   The devs should be fired as its been proven part time modders have a better understanding of what the players want.  
---
&gt;If I want 6 mutations I need to farm 3 months?
---
That's quite a lot of content right there.   
---
And you guys say there's nothing to do. If you quit your job you can grind for cap stashes full time too, that will shave off some time.
---
ive got a cryo with explosive on it but havent actually used it yet. was planning on using it soley for the queen since it also gets the cold effect too.
---
Don’t get too close. It fires like an AR with snipers range on the explosives 
---
execute order 666
---
hand control over to rockstar
---
Yes that is an option, bit tight on my perks layout though, I don't want to drop anything 😆 Thanks.
---
I killed the queen twice today and received nothing. Over half of the spawns also had no loot. If they are playing their not involved in the game their just walking through the motions. 
---
I want Bethesda to know they made a good game that I and many others are enjoying. I wasn't worried about downvotes. Thank you for agreeing.
---
If I had a cap for Everytime I've heard, "The dev team is aware..." just today, I'd only have 200 caps, because there is still a daily cap.
---
Come see me and see what star my perk cards are.
---
These are the stealth buffs in the patch to accommodate the nerfs. Lets all get worms!
---
Where do you see that I blame the gamers ? Where did I say "that's not an error of bethesda, it's a perfectly sound strategy" ?
---
That's the stupidest thing they could have done. It would have been interesting as a load test, to see how the servers would handle multiple real connections at once, but certainly not enough to test the game. Even less when you see the state it was finally released in.
---
In addition, telling the players they would keep their progression just made things worse. If people had been told "it's just a beta,please find bugs if you can", some would have tried to be "highest level of the beta" because that's how people work, but many would have said "well then, let's try to get a better product".
---
But it was not the case.
---
 [u/the\_lonestranger](https://www.reddit.com/u/the_lonestranger) 
---
What in the living hell are you talking about ?
---
I don't try to sell anything here, i don't claim that the outfits i have are rare or anything.
---
The video is not about me collecting outfits, neither it is about my framerate.
---
So the color changing mining helmets and hard hats that always turn green regardless of their appearance in the world are tied to my framerate ?
---
Highly doubt it. 
---
It's fun to hassle Toddles. Who else is there to hassle? The Project Lead is in hiding.
---
yeah ive seen generator, that small purifier and mentats as not learned even tho we know them
---
Ahh, they did. Thought you just had different colors. You definitely shouldn't be able to wear soo many at once, lol. And that framerate drop, just gross
---
Reminds me of that scene from Dumb and Dumber.
---
"I've got worrrmmmsss."
---
Well said.  I find that I'm constantly burning through ammo, even as a stealth rifleman, and constantly making more.  Ammosmith and Super Duper perks help, but I go through ammo like candy even as a single shot rifleman build.  (the 2-shot nerf did not help at all)  I'd easily burn up 1000+ 5.56 ammo during a SBQ, and now I expect that number to double or triple.  Paint cans will be my most prized loot for the future, I guess.
---
Food and boiled water is my second most prized commodity.  I like stat and xp buffs, so I actually like cooking up food and drink for luck, perception and xp boosts.  Porting to an SBQ, I'll usually eat a bunch of food to boost my Ag and Per to stay hidden and have optimal VATS accuracy when the SBQ hovers right next to me.  As a sniper with chameleon armor, my character and other like myself were probably doing the most damage to her when she's flying around.  Considering that's 75% of the time, I was contributing a lot pre-nerf.  I didn't get an SBQ post patch yet, so who knows how that will go.  I got more than a few fails with underpowered participants and baby campers in the past, so I'm guessing on a 50% success rate of getting even more explosive vents, ultracite helms and possibly a bit of cobalt flux.
---
The future is so bright I gotta wear shades.
---
Hey Lone got lads comming to give all feedback on weapons they can to this post for your report. 
---
The main one i would like to see corrected is Flamers. The crafting cost to amount given is sitting at almost nothing needs a good jump. The ammp weight to it takes abit but it uses so much so fast and deals so little.
---
The weapon at 200% breaks in seconds and making it very much useless. I carry a few 3☆s around but even then i cannot keep them up in ammo and stop them from breaking in one queen fight.
---
WAIT A MINUTE, THIS GAME HAS A BUG? LOCK AND LOAD THOSE SIGNS BOIS, WE PROTESTING. Yeah sorry the patch didn't work out in your favor,we'll get a hotfix or another patch to fix it soon. Imagine if people got this unnerved every time world of warcraft had a problem with a patch over the years.
---
rofl at ppl like you. great community... 
---
WoW has had a lot of people leaving since the mess that is BFA and the azerite grind. What's your point? 
---
Well they had to balance put the weight gained from travelling pharmacy working properly obviously  /s
---
The framerate is usually better plus some of the lags appeared only on the video for some reason
---
it's the opposite for me (PC). keep crashing in-game when stuff blows up or too much happens. used to be like this when i started playing, but not last patch. guess it returned with this patch.
---
If you're low and close on the cost, put it all in one place, person or stash. I noticed while making ammo, that if neither place had enough (lead in this case) to fulfill the craft requirements by itself, it came up as short of resources. When I put, say, my last 3 lead on person along with the 4 lead in my stash, I was able to craft the batch of ammo that cost 6 lead.
---
I keep it patched and maybe once a quarter, load her up and do one of the Investigation missions I never finished, so i still try to eke a tiny bit of life out of it!
---
did you just "come at me bruh"
---
And BF2 had relatively pretty graphics. Fallout 76 would be the easy pick for biggest joke of the current gen, but I feel like the game itself is losing relevance so fast, that people might not remember it in a year or two.
---
Your welcome, I’m not worried either most of my posts here or on that other fallout subreddit were I usually defend the game or heaven forbid give my opinion usually get downvotes but hey can’t please everyone.
---
yeah they should have also added text ability, some people dont like to talk and find text way easier and cheaper then buying a headset.
---
No they can't. I actually work with testers and appreciate the infinite possibilities of things they might need to test.
---
You could say "why didn't they test the rewards provided from the census violence event?!" Well because it wasn't in the scope of this update. Same applies for the bobby pin weight. Dev accidentally put it in the update and test weren't aware so it wasn't tested.
---
Look on my works 
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
Actually, there is very serious talk about making it illegal. Actually, it already is in some places. This is only refering to ones where u don't know what you get, sadly. But who knows. Bigger prey has been brought down before.
---
&gt;	Basically every studio Zenimax owns (other than ZO)
---
Every studio except the one that has a successful MMO under their belt. 
---
Who actually owns fallout? Bethesda or Zenimax?
---
😂😂😂
---
haha, good joke buddy!
---
Attempting to change pre-existing weapons with both of those effects could get tricky to the point where it's probably not worth trying, if it's something they can even do. Not sure people would be particularly happy that they just decided to reroll the legendary effects of TSE weapons that people have. If you could force it so they would have either one effect and or the other and reroll the other effects it wouldn't be a completely terrible change, but would still pinch plenty of nerves with people.
---
You could also prevent both effects from appearing on the same weapon after the patch, and refer to TSE weapons as "Legacy" weapons (Legacy being no longer obtainable, but you're allowed to keep it and use it), but you'd still have to nerf the effectiveness of TSE with how overpowerd it was. I'd say the nerf was a little bit much though.
---
It's a software where you can track individual changes to the project.
---
For example git:
---
* [List of changes](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master)
---
* [Individual change ("commit")]
---
(https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0f0ed8282e5bfdc87cdd562e58f3d90d893e7ee5)
---
You can organize project to [branches](https://fr.lutece.paris.fr/fr/image?resource_type=wiki_image&amp;id=10), so new features can be developed on the side and merged when ready. And can do useful operations like revert commits or apply them to different branches.
---
There are lot of things you can do depending on the particular VCS (version control system) like continuous integration where the code is tested and deployed automatically, or some sort of (manual review of changes)[https://atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/bitbucket411-blog-1200x-branches2.png] to ensure they are up to set standard.
---
Some sort of versioning system is used almost everywhere in software development. It doesn't have to be used for software, it's perfect for storing text document or configuration files.
---
And hopefully, just like the perk, mr.White, your opinion of Beth will also be nerfed, one day.
---
I think Bethesda's vision for this game is the same vision they've had for their other Fallout games. Just supporting multiplayer. The Fallout community on PC has been about mods for a couple of decades and we know (eventually) we're getting modded servers. I'd say they're creating an open world that players are going to be able to semi-permanently change over time. 
---
The way I'd like to see that play out is kind of like Minecraft realms or 7 Days to Die servers. Each server customizable and characters either portable into (but not out of) custom servers or the person running it forcing you to make anew. The world has all the aspects of that style of game from custom building directly on the map to altering the map itself with power plant events and nukes.
---
We're already seeing that servers can be separated by rules with the release of the new survival servers with no PvP rules. With the way modding has always been done in the GECK it stands to reason changes to any other server rules such such hunger/thirst mechanics, weapon mods, etc would be just as easy to change and could be done through a front end for non-modders. With how the Creation Club works, there's already a working front end to download and install mods required to make you compatible with the server.
---
We probably won't get all of that but I'd say it's the general direction the game is heading. I would love to see more mechanics like the quests to Reactivate Power Plants, An Organic Solution, or Nuke launches utilize. One person completes an objective and it changes entire areas on the map for everyone as long as that server is active. Pretty sure we're going to see that as a core mechanic in the future.
---
The devs do not care.  I appreciate you trying to whack some sense into them but the community has provided feedback time and time again.
---
They ask for us to help shape events when we have been saying for months what we want.  I really hope Bethesda is writing an essay to the community on how/why this game keeps getting worse and how they plan on fixing it.
---
It's unacceptable at this point.  I hope they release just the level of severity the game is at right now.  The last patch being broken and resurfacing old bugs is the straw that broke the camel's back.  You guys are taking the brunt of the all the crap , maybe it's time a higher up came in and commented on the situation.  
---
Unless something changes before launch, the default answer is yes, you can bring characters to and from that mode.
---
I agree with a lot of your points, including that I am not a beautiful special snowflake.  However, the following sentence, I did state that alone these exclamations don’t mean very much but a big group does. Even you said that the post was repetitive, even if OP’s post was generic it still presents a negative response to Bethesda’s action.
---
And being a fanboy isn’t a bad thing here. It’s awesome you enjoy the game. Despite its flaws it is a new front to see Bethesda try out their TES engine used as an MMO of sorts, and it is still a fallout game with most of the series being excellent game titles.  For many, this game scratches an itch that has been bugging players for awhile, yourself included it seems.  
---
My previous post was geared more towards the short, non constructive post to which I replied to. And you are right to say that OP’s post may have been generic and repetitive but just because it is shouldn’t mean he/she meant it any less.  And to the deleted commenter to dismiss OP’s post, or at the very least criticize without providing productive input, seems to me like a waste of a great opportunity to strike up a productive dialogue.
---
We all have our preferences but let’s help each other out and provide some useful insights in our disagreements. 
---
For example, “this game got nerfed to crap and I don’t like it. “
---
“Your post sounds like everyone else. If you don’t like the game anymore then play a previous game in the series or try a new one.  I’ve had my eye on these games and they may suit your fancy.”
---
It’s the internet, i get that people sometimes suck but they can at least be productive about their complaints to help someone along. The op goes on their merry way enjoying a game they do like and responder doesn’t have to hear/see someone complain.  Hell they don’t even need to be nice about it.  I just think they need to be productive.
---
No Man's Sky probably loves FO76.
---
I think I'd really just rather an option to fully respec our points at any time, I really dont see a reason why not. Every other online, skill point based game allows this 
---
Same bug here, same plan. Also one of my friends, same plan.
---
OTOH, the game insists that both of my characters know how to make a Confederate hat, and there's zero chance that one of them does (too new), whereas I only have strong doubts about the other. I ran into another plan like this, but can't for the life of me remember which.
---
Hopefully, it's just a handful of plans that are screwed up.
---
Is it just me or does handing my stuff over to a guy named sneakypete666 and expecting it to come back to me seem wrong🤔
---
Wearing the 5 hats at once probably isn't helping either
---
So far the feedback has only made them reconsider the canvas bag thing. They are still doing whatever the fuck they want/ were planning to do with the game while ignoring some pretty major issues.
---
What makes you think they won't add things for you to buy? And who says they won't cost you a goddamn fortune? Wake up, sir.
---
It some reason cant registered to scrap the bulk items, you will have to scrap what you need into loose pieces.
---
I really liked fallout 4, also fo3 and nv as well, although they seem a bit dated now. Really liking fallout 76. The multiplayer aspect definitely adds to the game. Not sure I could go back to single player again. It would seem very empty. 
---
I completely agree it seems like they are listening to the part time players and not the people playing everyday. The guns they nerfed are hard won. I was level 125 before I even got one. Instead of actually fixing anything they thought they'd get away with nerfing what people couldn't get a hold of and make it seem like they where working hard for everyone. 
---
Yeah, it's actually really good now, a d they're still working on it. It's pretty grindy, but not nearly as boring as it was at launch.
---
I never said I have a problem with them. I said they are annoying, many people can't beat them easily, and they drop crap. When someone does eventually get the strength to beat them what do they find? Nothing. Disappointment. An epic moment ruined by an ill thought out rushed mess of a game. Oh here have some bone that you can turn into a bit of ultracite. Have 5 ammo. Etc. But all you can do is try to make it about me. Yeah maybe I want to go and kill a bunch of them and not feel like it's a total waste of time and ammo.
---
Probably
---
No idea if it affects server stability
---
Pre-ordered, played beta, 8 hours after release and then I dropped and was waiting for a reason to come back all this time...
---
...guess I'll have to wait a little longer... 
---
Its because they added the thing where mods wont auto scrap. Seems they lazily made it where nothing will auto scrap? Youll have to scrap your own bulk for the time being.
---
It's not just you , same here, but probably doesn't have anything with specific slots.
---
Sharing only works on teammates though. Unless you joind eachother as a team you wouldn't gain the perk. 
---
no it's built into the game mechanics by design don't worry.
---
Sure, but thats because of the new atmosphere of instant gratification and outrage.  Instead of demanding peoples jobs and hoping a company goes bankrupt, how about we work with the dev's pushing it in a direction we want to see. Beyond that, since we have so many game dev and quality assurance gods on the sub https://jobs.zenimax.com/departments/view/8
---
Not me. Quit last week. Not cause of bugs, tho. I just got bored. Not really complaining as I enjoyed most of the time I played. Got annoyed with DCs in silos and laggy loot + despawning SBQ. But eh. Got my money's worth in 400 hours. Hope there's more to do soon.
---
You wouldn't tease a girl, now, would you?
---
This new thing - it is bad!
---
I've been playing Fallout 76 since God was a baby, and before that I was playing older fallout games even before Interplay was born. It's always been a source of fun and joy for me, and when I joined this game I thought at the time it was my home. But then they brought this new thing into the game. This new patch is going to completely break the game! In the past I used to do it in the old way, and that was fine. I did it like that, I was fine, and nothing ever went wrong. But then there was this new change! WHY?
---
There are many reasons why this new thing will break the game.
---
1: This changes the thing I worked/payed to get
---
2: It is different.
---
3: It is not the same as it was before.
---
4: The way it was before is how I want it to remain.
---
5: It is new.
---
6: I don't like it.
---
With all of these factors in mind - and these are just the ones that come to me now, I would like to put forward a petition. Please, please can we roll back the change now? And in the meantime can I also tell you how qualified I am not to like this new thing. I did that old thing a lot. I was better than anyone in the world at that old thing. I am the master of that old thing. The only master. This is not the reason I dislike this new thing, though. I am the master of this new thing too. Oh no don't get me wrong, I am better at this new thing than any of you, ever, and have been since before I was born. But that old thing was better, and this new thing is bad and wrong.
---
Please Devs - take notice of my cries. This new thing is going to make this game into a different game from how it was before. This cannot be allowed to happen. Stop now.
---
Anyway, I am not complaining. I just want to make it perfectly clear that I am uber, this new thing is bad, and that old thing is the only way that anything should be done.
---
A bug that magically makes the weapon deal respectable damage doesn't mean the weapon isn't underpowered...
---
I mean...Watch the "Wouldn't it be Nice" trailer. It doesn't get much more community focused than sitting around a campfire laughing at a Deathclaw limping away. 
---
Your third paragraph said it really well.
---
Ive been playing since launch. The exploration was fun. The adventures i had were fun. Leveling up and crafting was fun. But now, at end game, im having no fun.
---
Its really a downfall for alot of games where, end game is just a grind loop.
---
I dont want to seek out monsters anymore because 1. They'll either break my armor and ill hafta spend more time finding stupid ballistic fiber.
---
2. Ill use up too much ammo and ill hafta go out farming for lead and plastic.
---
3. Getting exp and perk cards at this point (lvl 87) is kind of useless.
---
Im sick of whitesprings. Im mildly sick of watoga. Scorchbeasts are still a pain in the butt with no noteworthy LOOT to speak of... And speaking of which... WHY HASNT THEIR TERRIBLE LOOT POOL BEEN ADDRESSED YET?
---
Any other characters that you have will show as Known even if they don't if another character you have does know it.
---
People will always complain about a nerf becauss it means they have to now work for something that they were uswd to getting easier, thats just human nature and soon enough it would be just normal again, like if they closed a road near you permanently, people will kick off about it but soon forget they ever even used that road because they are now used to the work around to it
---
Random then, very annoying.
---
This subreddit is like that, heaven forbid you think the devs aren't doing their jobs.
---
That probably you joined a full server and your teammates were over the max. pop. limit.
---
Aight bro you do you 
---
I don't know, i think people would flame like hell "oh you do this but not that?!" and so on.
---
&gt; T-Posing ghouls that fly 
---
That's just referred to as a character "Bethesda'ing" now. Example:  
---
"Dude, that ghoul was there then it just Bethesda'd off into the distance."  
---
This has been the smoothest the game has run for me. Not one DC or blue screen all night. I even dropped a nuke and didn't lag in the radiation zone. My friend had a blue screen but said it's still smoother then it's been. 
---
I'm keeping my fingers crossed it stays like this.
---
I remember being too weak to kill a scorchbeast and you know what I did? I ran away from them until  I  leveled up enough to go toe to toe, not spam social media about how they need to cater the game to my needs.
---
You for fucking real son?
---
The new patch is just an old patch they incompetently put out.  Old bugs have resurfaced in Mass like Bobby pin weight, fusion core rate back to 0.8.  You cannot craft or repair unless you unbulk junk.
---
But hey they nerfed weapons and white knight.  Speaking of which, you guys are out on full damage control today.  Surprise surprise.
---
I couldn't find any Combat Armor ones either aside from like one or two.. so much for venders having everything. Oh don't forget now we can't get that stuff anymore because venders stock wont change.
---
Jesus Christ how broken are they making this now, it's one step forward and a f#$king launch back 
---
I craft way too much ammo. End up giving half of it away to other players 👍🏻
---
If my single shot explosive handmade is still very usable why isn't your TSE? You don't need 1000 damage to kill things, that's overkill. OK so you need two extra bullets, big deal.
---
it's easier than you think ;)
---
I wouldnt get it, if anything check out Anthem, there is an open beta this weekend so you can scope it out for free.
---
that would be nice to see, i just took all vendors caps a couple hours ago, guess ill see if they restock in the morning. need alot of caps now for all those plans.
---
Literally dozens of us 
---
Saw there might be a link to Radworms messing with mutations after the patch. Radworms right now increase mutation positive and negative effects and acts as radx if it either goes away by itself or is cured. Only way to fix is relogg
---
Crafted and scrapped 24 after finally being able to buy the plan and still don't have the suppressor mod yet which is all I needed lol. I'll try again tomorrow after junk farming.
---
There you go!
---
Thanks, will go set my console on fire and jump off a bridge  since reddit user AusPeasant made me realize my entire life is futile since they don’t see eye-to-eye with me on a set definition of “good game”. 
---
This could be the issue, I did see radworms affect stuff. Would also explain why I now jump a bit higher as well when around ghouls and such.
---
Your link is worthless. Did I say I want people fired or hope Bethesda goes bankrupt? No. Did I say I want perfection in a game? No. Did I even bring up Warcraft or zenimax jobs? Lol no, and your comments are all over the place. I said I am waiting for certain changes in the game and this patch didn't have those. Seems to me you just want to defend the devs and defend this buggy game. You should go talk to OP if you're complaining about people asking for a change in leadership / people getting fired. 
---
Seriously, the game world itself is beautiful.
---
There was no difference between the beta and the day 1 code. That’s not a beta, that’s a demo.
---
Not sure if this is intentional or a bug but I cannot wear an under armor piece while wearing the inspector costume, it unequips. I can wear under armor beneath the silver shroud costume, however.
---
Yes but they didn't build in a guarantee that I could get my stuff back and I've already seen people do it to friends faking trades to run away with there stuff. But in all honesty I was just making a joke comment that a guy with the name such as yours is asking people to hand over their stuff. I would however fell better about handing my 3* ledgendaries over if there was a way to guarantee it's return after modding.
---
I don't give a what you did. I have seen so many times people killing a Scorchbeast and being disappointed that they drop nothing. That is a problem with the game design. You braindead fanboi. Look at the mess of this game. Even people who are die hard fans are quitting. All that's left and shills and fanbois who would make any excuse and any defense for any problem the game has. I would love some real numbers for sales and concurrent players. Like some real data. Some charts to point at and rub in your face.
---
Nah.  Same old engine same old tricks.
---
Don't go blaming Austin.  It's Bethesdas fault for this mess.  iTs TheRe fIrSt gAmE is not an excuse.  It is a product sold at full price marketed as an AAA game, published by a billion dollar company.  
---
There is literally no excuse for this type of failure. 
---
Yeah this update is disastrous. I was for the nerfs because gameplay but holy crap I searched 90% of the vendors and a buncha like armor mods and stuff seem to be missing and screw everybody I guess because vender plan stock doesnt change anymore.
---
We were in the server for a while before the team invite happened, then we were in a team for close to 20 minutes before the message happened.
---
I’m struggling to think of how to pack more wrongness in a shorter sentence
---
I'd say plenty. People who like Squares RPGs also like Bethesdas RPGs.
---
Yeah, I was generalizing on the majority of pitchfork and torch wielders in the comments. MB.
---
You are the one making completely unfounded statements like they are going to make us pay money for extra cap space. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that. So you wake up. Earning caps isn’t hard and cap sinks are necessary for end game. 
---
Why are you guys still here. Bethesda jumped the shark years ago! We knew this was bad day one. 
---
First thing my friend said was 'Why is there a naked dude dancing on my screen' 😂
---
The huge chunk of exp isn't enough? Damn.
---
People who no longer want to play the game know better than you or the devs why they no longer want to play the game. I'm at that point now. Something is drawing me back, but I'm pretty sure it's over now.
---
For me it took out my TS-handmade, TSE handmade and FE handmade. Funny enough only handmades.  If re-select and restart, spots are again empty.
---
i'm fine with it.
---
Thanks for that mofo. The flamer is definitely something i highlighted as a concern!
---
I was about to build my evac power armour but i lost all my screws and gears after update when my own turrets attacked me killed me and i switched servers to escape a level 120 intruder. 
---
Yes you are right. 
---
No gun to my head. 
---
but kind of a bummer. 
---
i spend  so much time scavenging and trying to reduce weight. 
---
but there are no guides on how / what to keep or toss. 
---
anyway. 
---
I should prob be doing something more productive for my life anyway. 
---
I’m right next to Alpha Silo, the scenery there was just too pretty to let go! I set up a fake “Nuka-Cola Outdoor Company Retreat”, and even made up a little story behind it! I’m almost lvl100 and honestly, 60% of the fun I have is making up stories about the camps I place and greeting players, asking them if they want to check out my shop. 
---
No deal. ima just piss my pants like usual.
---
No problem man anything we can do to help. 
---
And yet my weight did not increase before and after patch. No one has supplied proof of core respawn speed change. Looting power cores I've not seen a difference.  Bulk junk has never crafted for me ever. Because there is literally no reason to bulk unless you are selling.
---
They balanced weapons because people complain about pvp not being viable and those weapons would for ever turn pvp into 1 shot instant kills.  Not to mention how powerful they are in pve.
---
Equalizing perk benefits in line with others is called game balance.
---
Like literally any other game players get used to unbalanced content. When developers fix unbalanced content the players rant and rave because they don't give a shit about over all game balance only what they personally want.
---
Same issue if i start it in fullscreen mode..
---
I need a fix!
---
Can’t play it in borderless (10-12fps)
---
Fallout 76 has been a fantastic game and the majority of players enjoy it. Reddit is just an echo-chamber of complainers and haters. MMOs have bugs, and ya'll are overdramatic about changes to a video game. Go ahead, downvote the truth. But it had to be said. 
---
Try to rebuild database and clear cache from PS4. In case you or someone reading this doesnt know how:
---
Clearing cache - power down the system and unplug the power cable for around 30 seconds (although 5-10 minutes is highly suggested)
---
Rebuilding database - once cache is cleared plug power chord back in and long press the power button. You will hear a beep after about 10 seconds. Use a USB connected controller and select rebuild database. Takes a few minutes to complete and will restart system after. 
---
I only say this because I was plagued by 2 crashes in about 20 minutes after installing this update. Gave this a shot before I uninstalled and reinstalled the game again (had to do that last patch because of crashes) and it worked or so it seems. Was able to play for a few hours with no incidents. 
---
I stopped playing (read grinding) until there is new content. My left hand is currently stuck in neutral position so I can't use my keyboard without having my arm out like a chicken wing. I recently got a controller so I can play again, but since being able to play again, I realized I don't want to play 76 anymore. Not until there's something new.
---
I installed the division 1 last night due to this abomination of a patch.  Enjoyed it to say the least.  
---
Was nice playing a game that upheld more than 15fps and had decent player/facial animations.  
---
This pathetic company can't do one good thing without breaking two other in the meantime. Same with caps stashes (they don't dissapear now, but perk keeps singalling empty ones) and challenges (they add some new ones, but most doesn't register anything  - like the one with flowers - I've collected 20 rhododendrons (whatever the name) and it lists 0/10). The same with plans - they've added known plans/recipies, but some plans appears unknown in vendors and changes to known when you buy it, making this new feature pointless.
---
I only could one shot some higher levels, Robots, Scorched, animals but never a Scorched Beast.
---
The main problem of this patch is not that it has nerfed something. This upset some people, but most are angry for another reason. The problem is that this patch is installed on top of the previous version of the game. They rolled back everything that was patched with previous patch. People are angry because it's crazy. Seriously, this incident is unimaginable for a large company.
---
My personal fix for all of this was pressing the Uninstall button. You can hope for whatever you wish fore Bethesda will improve, but as long as this team of pure incompetent Devs and Managers is leading this company, only a miracle   
---
can save them. 
---
Hummm.  Perhaps your right and I was just underestimating the amount of splash damage that allowed them to one shot me several times while in power armor.  That's why I would enjoy having access to a combat log for sure.  Things like this we could verify.
---
"The Devs have been made aware of this, and are working to resolve the issue."
---
I figured, I'd beat them to the punch this time.
---
And Ark has a lot more problems that have persisted since day 1. 
---
And I agree whole heartedly. Loot boxes and "pay to win" are a cancer for the average gamer. But the truth is we live in a time when people have grown up as gamers with us and now are CEO's, managers and wealthy. And as gamers of our generation they are willing to spend 100x's what they paid for a game to have the best stuff for the game because they can. And game companies as "companies" have found a way to tap into this  phenomenon. It is a slippery slope. One that game companies have unfortunately navigated very well for themselves. Bethesda included. It is lucrative for them and no amount of talking is going to make it go away. The game industry is big business now. It is what it is. I have a channel on my cable box that is for e-sports for gods sake. 
---
Well, I'll have to ask your sources for that. Being angry and issuing false statements out of the blue like that won't give you any credibility.
---
I agree completely 
---
The version we play right now is two patches behind. This is the patch before the bobby pin weight was reduced. By this time the board dupe method was already fixed. Thats why you cant dupe with boards anymore. What came after was the method that supposedly crashes the server. Afaik the server crash method was fixed with the bobby pin patch. But bobby pin patch has been undone so the server crash method, or whatever other method replaced the board method, is rumored to be back.
---
All you proofed is that the duping method with boards has indeed been fixed in the patch we currently play. Now we have to know how the dupe methods after board worked and test them(if they exist). At least Modus dupe is also gone.
---
I am not saying that the atom store by itself is a problem. The problem is keeping away something that would greatly improve the game, at essentially no cost, simply to prop the store up.
---
That was the point I was making.
---
Bethesda, hire this guy. It’s the only thing that can save the company. 
---
&gt;	intentionally low stash limit
---
i.e.  they give you so much crap that you can’t even store it all
---
&gt;	can only get up to 600-800(?) caps per day selling items
---
i..e. they give you so much crap that you try going to 3-4 different vendors every day to sell it all.
---
Those doesn’t sound to me like good arguments that there’s a conspiracy on their part to rebalance the game to be a grind to obtain material.
---
Some weapons are stupidly bad such that they take lots of repair and ammo, but that’s a different argument.
---
Other weapons and armor need almost no rare materials (sledgehammers, raider power armor [\*], T-60 power armor) but somehow those didn’t get nerfed.  (If you just wanna do quests, I guess there’s your build...)
---
The relevant nerf to White Knight to go from 90% to 60% repair costs on armor could be a good argument about trying to make things more difficult, because Ballistic Fiber is rare (the only material in armor repairs that I haven’t yet had so much of that I sell it), except they also in a previous patch shifted ballistic fiber costs to be less of an issue (higher level threshold before it becomes an ingredient to armor construction and repair, reduced total amount needed, but also made it an ingredient for all armor types across the board).
---
Anyway, by way of anecdote, I started a new character a month or so ago, now at 46, and didn’t have trouble keeping my weapons and armor repaired (mostly shotguns and leather armor, but later a motley collection of legendary armor types).  None of the areas affected by today’s nerfs intersected with what my characters experienced, I believe, which is mostly completing the quests, and running around selling all this material I was meant to eat/drink/craft.
---
[\*] (I just assume from fo4; never tried repairing raider power armor in fo76)
---
Definitely not a hundred percent on this but in other fallout games whenever i was doing something the game didnt normally allow it caused issues
---
No. I do full stack applications and backed services at Amazon. 
---
But I've played other games by much smaller companies. Warframe is one that does an excellent job. Sure there are bugs but they're addressed immediately and never repeated. 
---
They're not exactly reinventing anything here right? The multi player and items and damages are all solved? I really don't know because I'm not a game developer but if you can say "this one or two things they're doing is completely new to the industry" I can probably understand, but it doesn't really seem like it.
---
"People who no longer want to play the game know better than you or the devs"
---
Get fucked, I'm so done.
---
Do you want to be spit in the face by this company even more? 
---
Sure. When I grt up, ill hit you up
---
try removing external mods if you are using them. I heard some mods are incompatible with this version.
---
If you don’t understand why bobby pins going back to the old weight value is a massive issue and not a petty complaint then you have no business providing critique on patch quality.
---
Hotkeys on PC. Stimpack hotkey is besides the Backspace on hungarian keyboards, under F10. Thats a bit far to press.
---
This bug is since premiere, they don't bother to fix it. It must be too complicated for those geniuses...
---
Most are angry about those Bobby Pins right? No, it's all about the TSE. Just like everyone knew it would be. For me it's the caps stashes. For others it's Demolitions Expert. There are a bunch of other things but, I knew TSE would open the floodgates for the people who worked their asses off for weeks/months to get those weapons. People who don't read forums or use reddit etc.
---
I have a TSE .50cal and BE .50cal, a TSE Gatling Laser and a FE Gatling Laser, and the BE and FE one always disappear from favorites.
---
But just for the gun, right? Is there any place I can buy the mods?
---
pick flowers challenge only?  iv noticed 95% of the challenges are broken..iv completed so many of them but it doesnt show that in the challenges menu.
---
Aging then becomes bugged and everyone becomes Benjamin Button.
---
WTF
---
I’m still waiting to be able to see anything when I fight a Scorchbeast 
---
That's the disconnect I'm talking about.  My TSE pipe bolt action doesn't one shot hard enemies in PVE and never did.  I could one shot players that were destroying my house, but I had to sneak up on them as the did and go for headshots.  That was my one resource for base defense.  Once I'm in detected status, my damage output is abysmal.  High level deathclaws, snallygasters, radscorps and Scorchbeasts were still battles, but I had a hard hitting but slow weapon that felt appropriate as a massive time investment to acquire.
---
I agree that explosive ammo was overpowered, but a plain 2-shot rifle was very nice, but no world beater.  If you need proof, here's my handmade pre and post nerf.
---

---
107 damage is barely better than a stock version with a much higher crafted durability and vastly better hipfire and vats accuracy.
---
Are there any legal ramifications, for them knowingly downgrading my game.
---
How is Reactive not working? I have that on my Excavator and  monsters have died hitting me. Is it not doing the 50%? 
---
every 24hrs for me..i constantly check them 
---
Good thing that's not what I'm doing huh.
---
This game has problems that have persisted since fo4
---
Yall knew this shit was OP and was gonna get nerfed from the very beginning, yet yall still spec'd your character that way. Sucks to be you, but it's your own damn fault. 
---
Nobody cares you neckbeard.
---
Then it'll get fixed next month, or the month after whatever. If they hate it that much, just get a refund and boycott the company.
---
It was dick move lol.  Nothing but an ego trip by the developers.  'we feel it was overperforming' as they write in the patch notes.  Well maybe instead of emotion back your changes up with data.  Literally nobody wanted this 
---
I work in QA myself. My ass would have been fired if we green lighted that kinda stuff. Maybe I need a chiller company? Lol
---
Cough revs cough
---
You’re are correct! I am very excited to see this community grow and expand. However for certain role-play characters with strict weapon restrictions from their role-play, the ability to make a useless weapon excellent through a legendary prefix was a godsend. I’m a Crossbow guy: slow to reload, completely based on sneak, and the only way to keep it as a relevant weapon was to have Two Shot. So I’m beginning to have the opinion that some weapons should be adjusted for damage. I don’t want to give up the bow, Darryl Dixon would be ashamed.
---
ditto on the challenges..95% of them arent registering for me
---
We are all part of the great circle of life. We are born to become one with all, and in so doing, through death are returned into our strangler heart to nurture it to mature. Life is beautiful :-)
---
They did literally zero damage with dense+fireproof2 already before the nerf ....
---
Hey, after this patch Bethesda's QA team just might be hiring. lol
---
Same with the operative underarmor. What a waste of 800 atoms.
---
&gt; Most are angry about those Bobby Pins right? 
---
This is just a symptom. Ultra-wide support is broken again, the game freezes sometimes on cell loading. According to rumors, the old dupe method works again. No, it's not about the weight of the Bobby Pins. The fact is that all this says one thing — they rolled back the last patch. And this is some kind of insane incompetence. This is an obvious mistake.
---
They needed a change before the game came out tbh
---
I's sorry, but  I do not really see the connection with my post and the topic?
---
Same for me too, also on Xbox one. Pretty bothersome
---
The Scorchbeast screech? The one that was a big since beta that isn’t high on their list either
---
Yesterday's daily where it had you scrapping fertilizer and something else (copper?) was broken for me too, I only completed the quest, photo and level up.
---
On another note, it was difficult completing the Red Rocket photo weekly because it has to be so specific? I took like 3-4 pictures at each station and had to check it was completed.
---
Ha or at least drafting a charter.
---
Serum recipes*
---
Thanks man, I was completely annoyed until you made me realize I got my money's worth. Have all except level 50 and kill 20 players for trophies (interesting that I have level 100 trophy). Definitely have 100+ hours of play time probably more like hundreds. So it's not all bad.
---
Still a little sad, it could have been such a great game. I'm sure something will come along to take it's place though.
---
If you buy bethesda games you deserve it.  You deserve each other.
---
Absolutely, I logged in and made them before work this morning. I'll be available after 4pm est today.
---
Well if you are that worried, just give me your account username and password and i will dupe it for you, then you can hand me the extra one with no worries!
---
The latter sure, but good luck on a refund \~80 days after purchase with many hours played.
---
But being an illiterate furry???
---
Is TES pipe the only version of that weapon?
---
Not for long
---
Ppl got used to seeing huge chunks come off of her health, saw someone shooting her with a tse, and just assumed that was the problem.  It wasn’t.   It was ppl getting the damage on said shotgun up to like 18k by stacking a hundred explosive bobbles.
---
ikr...its ridicuous..the only option is to use vats to shoot it because you cant see..   and for me vats is useless.cos it always misses for me..even when it says 80% i will still miss
---
Since the patch today, not before hand.  I know it was every 24hrs before. 
---
Since when has it become something forbidden, to express a negative opinion about the work of the developer? For some games (like No Man's Sky) this was for good and they improved a lot.
---
Yeah I agree. If duping would never have been a thing, no one would walk around with TSEs and we would have to use different ways to kill the queen. Now TSE is nerfed and we have to do exactly this, adapt with different playstyles.
---
Though melee is too strong and everyone will just play melee.
---
Well it already is.
---
That was the last straw for me.  Couldn't repair my weapons and I was familiar to the put everything in your stash to register fix.  
---
Was very confused and angry at such a basic game mechanic not working.  There is no way they even tested it.  I found this bug in less than an hour.  A decent QA would have found this sooner.  
---
But hey we got the Silver Shroud costume from fallout 4 locked behind the atom shop.  The absolute cheek of Bethesda right now.
---
I meant for actual caps, not cap space. Cap stashes. Played this game before, have you?
---
Yup, that is how dumb they are on this one. 
---
There’s a mod people have been using temporarily for that. Reasonable Scorchbeast Scream Effects or something like that. It turns the weird explosive blue shriek into the gamma gun rings. The effects are all the same but visually the difference is unbelievable 
---
id love to hear the logic at the dev meeting with the licenced plumber nerf, theres like 4 of us with pipe builds
---
R/wallstreetbets 
---
They didn't mention the last two things in my list. Please explain how that fits with "perfect" in your view.  Is it okay to have surprise changes?
---
Hello.  You are not actually losing the ammo.  I believe it's a weird bug where the HUD displays previous rounds fired when you gather something.
---
Neither to be honest, I used to love my TS Tommy Gun but after the nerf it's back to shooting pellets like the non-legendary version so not really viable anymore. 
---
Which is tragic as hell. I always leaned towards bethesda titles exactly because they are not as all the other's. Despite the many bugs. 
---
Please Bethesda don't kill your game by giving it to the doritos kids.
---
I’ve fast travelled from vendor to vendor and the caps were the same all round. 
---
Are they ment to change when you go to a different station ?
---
One thing I give Ubisoft credit for.  The test servers on rainbow six siege were second to none.   
---
My explosive gatling laser is shredding! At least for around 1500 shots, then I have to repair it... 
---
too bad theres no mods for ps4 yet.
---
Thank you for the tips, I did try that very recently. Did not see any substantial improvements. This is not the PS4 that causes the problems.
---
I have a TSE handmade. "Two extra bullets" is a gross understatement. That and my the combat shotgun are at minimum using 5x the ammo they were before.
---
Oh god... I know that pain all too well 
---
white knight are not equal with power patcher due to the fact power armor is way more durable, if they believe white knights 90% is a bit too much they could easily just make it only a 2 point perk and cap it at 60% which in turn will free up a free perk for players. Same with demo expert it is already a 5 point perk which is heavy investment into the int stat they could easily just cap it at 3 points if they believe the benefit to explosives is too high. 
---
he didnt say cap space man, he said cap stashes. A cap stash is a container you can find in the world full of caps.
---
He's saying they will sell caps in the atom store.
---
Maybe it's connected to Vault 94 and we'll know more about the Strangler Heart when they release that supposed "new" content
---
That was probably the idea but they just put that in not thinking about bulked items.
---
ok...strange.
---
Bug I’ve never seen before. A blank pipboy screen that I could only leave to go to the map. Fast travel worked but the problem with the unclosable blank pipboy persisted.
---
1 - PC (gtx 1080 , 9900k ,32gb of 3466 ddr4 cas 16 ram)
---
2 - yussef961 
---
3 -
---
4 - Barbarian perk is not taken into accounts with class freak lvl  3 and starched genes, meaning the damage resistance doesn't change whether it's applied or not... of course without power armour... evasive and ironclad work well though.
---
The company should switch their name to "Buggedthesda" .
---
My 2 shot western revolver went down from 154 to 99. That’s not a balanced nerf in my books. 
---
Why would I care what you think?  In a game where apparently the entire game revolves around the devs making players fight not epic battles, but encumbrance, you don't believe that someone could be encumbered without duping?  
---
The guy is using single shot weapons (technically dual but still only using a single bullet for each squeeze of the trigger) with ammo Smith, supa dupa and bandolier you are hard pressed to run out of ammo for non automatic weapons. 
---
I use a muffled .45 pipe revolver doing sneak attacks &amp; rarely drop below 300 rounds with that setup.
---
It's a very good game now. You can go and try it out without any fear.
---
This is an example that games can be completly fixed if the company behind it really wants it.
---
I doubt that Bethesda has the same love for Fallout 76 as Hello Games has for NMS.
---
So we probably never will see that kind of threatment on FO76.
---
and a proper way to mod in trade, rather than handing gear over to strangers.
---
Wielded by 6 players instead of 13, too. 
---
Been commenting all day about this! Crossbow!
---
No they all are 200, but if you sold out the vendor to zero it usually takes 24 hrs to reset back to 200., but I have done two loops of vendor runs so far tonight.  
---
Just trade it in, or play a different game instead. 
---
"Put another way, Bethesda dropped item degradation from Skyrim and Fallout 4. Maybe there was a reason for that?"
---
Please dont encourage them to dumb fallout down anymore than they already have.
---
Good catch I was wondering what that was playing last night. 
---
It would be nice to actually run into a bot with enough money to actually buy my stock.  Half my crapsack is crap waiting for a merchant.
---
Partially quoting someone is a pretty shitty tactic, espically when that quote is one comment above your reply. To me you sound just as bad as the people overreacting
---
WE DONT NEED TO NERF MELEE WE NEED TO BUFF EVERYTHING ELSE, PLEASE DONT MAKE THIS GAME LESS FUN FOR EVERYONE ELSE THANKS
---
The whole trade UI is clunky and hard to navigate and takes too long to set up a trade anyway!  They should let us set up some kind of store or vendor at our camps, which are then marked on the map for everyone to see.  Player economy would boom!
---
When the lunchboxes come in, I'm going to frame this comment as proof that Bethesda shills have literally no idea when it comes to corporate strategy.   
---
Making the comment in general, not in need of advice on the matter lol. I still play with the wifey.
---
Not true at all. They still love to spit in our faces with new updates that break the game even more and make it tedious
---
To answer your question, I might be taking a break for a while...
---
So I tried the new balanced guns and found pretty quick that I get more out of my explosive lever by fully ranking 1 rifleman card versus having rank 5 demolition...ok that's odd but got it. Ran around Watoga killing bots and  thought ok this isn't so bad. Then went to West Tek... yea... I'm sorry but being lvl 184 with end game gear it should not take 15 shots or more to kill 1 super mutant. Sure if you sneak attack it takes 3 or 4 because the sneak damage is still nuts but when you run in and want to clear a room you dont get the sneak attack luxury. Then the armor broke...wow that was quick. Oh and now I have to keep more materials which I have to use more bullets to gather now in the same stash limit that I already had to sell things I didnt want to but was forced to due to stash size. 
---
I'm ok with the balance, but if you balance the explosive I think melee needs a bit now, or keep melee where it's at and bump explosive and/or two shot up a bit. I dont use two shot as I mainly vats sneak hit but it still got its manlyhood chopped. I would even be on with a slight explosive buff as long as they return the demolition perk, after all it does take 5 slots. 
---
Also pretty upset there was no fix for targeting HUD, dense plans are no where to be found, and still no new content besides some silly superhero outfits you have to buy. 
---
Kind of curious to this weeks inside the vault to see if there is mention of any quick changes or what is actually coming next. 
---
For me, its not giving us a respec. They nerfed and changed so many perks that it changes the builds of peoples characters. Then we have ro level up 15 times just to change a build. Yeah, it sucks they nerfed TSE a little too hard. I think it will get a small boost in the future, but when you're a level 150, youve grinded enough. Youve found your weapons, build, perks, and built a strong ass character that can destroy. When bethesda destroys that and doesnt gice us an option to respec, it feels kinda wasted.
---
I understand what you're dsying though. This is the first patch that was an utter failure in mu opinion.
---
Also, excavator carry weight is still fucked up beyind belief. I still fluxuate every time i fast travel or enter/exit it.
---
My fave t-pose error was in LotRO where this fat Orc mob kept falling from the sky in t-pose and sliding halfway to me. But then he'd disappear and spawn back in his t-pose. I must have sat there laughing for 10 mins. 
---
Got my daily dose of cringe before 6am today!
---
Now you'll be grinding caps in order to afford those plans instead. 
---
First message after horrible patch:
---
Get +15 to health for each person on team with one of our over priced outfits. (I think it was +15)
---
You won't be able to load into the game to wear it or be able to make it once in the game due to inablity to use craft items, but that's not or problem.
---
oh, ok, still don't know what is bugged with it (and I fought many of them), but at least it make sense - there are many bugs they've should address long time ago.
---
Maybe it's different for mobile games but in my case I'd be fired if I spent time QA'ing something that wasn't on my list to QA. We'd never go back over previous changes if we were working on a timeline for release of something currently live and awaiting the update.
---
Though I think it's more likely QA went fine but the final live build didn't include build parts. If I was a betting man, I'd say the CVS flagged an overwrite from the previous build(s) and the engineer on hand misclicked skip instead of merge.  
---
You grind 16 hours
---
And whaddya get?  
---
Another nerfed gun
---
And a weak-ass perk set
---
Saint Peter don't you call me cause I can't go
---
I owe my soul to the Atom Stooore
---
Causing regressions in a live service production environment is grounds for getting fired and if you think otherwise I encourage you to get a job as a developer/tester and try it.
---
Hear, hear! May the wisdom of the Mothman guide your steps in succeeding in this wondrous endeavour...
---
Actually this is not the truth. You can't compare FO76 to any other AAA MMO out there. Or you are telling me that wow, ffxiv, destiny, the division or even black desert are as bugged and bad looking as FO76?  
---
Unfortunably my friend, people who still plays FO76 dont have any quality standards to live for, so they will simple eat all the trash all day. I mean, time is a precious thing, and you are wasting it with a shit ass cash grab game like FO76. You could be playing A LOT of better stuff...But no, you are collecting bottles in a loreless fallout, congrats.
---
They aren’t supposed to spam their shriek and it definitely shouldn’t be farting out their chocolate factory either
---
Very much so. I would happily test. It's being handed a patch and stumbling over problems that frustrates me. Because I have no confidence that my voice will be heard (there isn't even a "bug report" ticket), I can't view discovering problems and changes as a bug hunt. That's only fun when your efforts come to some fruition.
---
Awww... your little TSE One-Shot build ain’t OP anymore. Tough titties...
---
End game bosses aren’t meant to be cleared in a minute (if the damn beast landed for longer than 10s). Ever since the nerf, this thread has had two things:
---
- Salty cheese-addicted cucks who can no longer cough on enemies to kill them, and
---
- Even saltier cheese addicted cucks as above but have suddenly jumped to the “Give us more end game content” ship
---
Please leave. The community doesn’t want you and your piss poor sob story. You will not be missed
---
&gt;Bulk junk has never crafted for me ever. 
---
 *Bulk junk has never crafted for me ever.*  
---
Completely untrue.
---
Reported for lying.
---
Sometimes when Devs patch in new things, they bae that of previous coding where maybe a hot fix was once applied after . This means at the time they make the patch and test it it works as the live build has since moved on. Sadly we see that in many games and old bugs creep back in. 
---
Hard for me to bite the bullet on anthem, andromeda really let me down and I love mass effect played one thru three countless times, but free open beta is a great idea thanks, may have to check out no mans sky too, maybe wait till it’s free or cheap from my gold account 
---
Bethesda should realise censoring is only going to make matters worse.  
---
The real endgame is to buy items from the Atomic Shop while building up a fake relationship with the developer. 
---
For all intents and purposes, it's like a drug addiction and Bethesda is the dealer: they pretend to care about you and to make you happy, but all they really want is to keep you hooked juuust enough to not realize it - so you can keep spending without having second thoughts about it.
---
Behold, the future of the video game industry! 
---
The stock market also predicts this trend and investors are licking their chops how easy it's going to be to milk this industry.
---
When I got my first GameBoy for Christmas some 25 years ago, video games were considered toys. Today, developers are multi-billion dollar companies whose decisions are being dictated by corporate interests and stock values. Players are but means to an end.
---
The time of "by gamers for gamers" has long since gone.
---
If you're on PS4 I can mod it for you 
---
Ditto!
---
Tfw u play melee and the repair is cheap af
---
I will only agree to this if I am voted supreme chancellor 
---
It’s a “feature”. Beth is aware but for now you have to unbulk to use your mats. 
---
I'm calling for consistency among perks in more ways than total % added damage, not about options. 
---
Yeah, and when Whitespring gets nuked, you can expect those same players to attack you to drive you off spawn points.  It's a straight-up murderfest on the ledge by the pool, watching level 100+ players and their friends beat lowbies in hazmat suits to death.
---
But still a SS-FPS for me.  My Gatling and I roll slow but heavy and hard.
---
At this point, I think someone inside Bethesda is trying to destroy the company from within, a 5th columnist kind of thing.
---
9 days of mothman eggs and civil war dresses..... fml. just for letters. when I finally get them, I’m making every workshop I take racist af
---
Crossbow! It’s such an interesting weapon for a stealth player and as a balanced player resource wise, it is a weapon who’s ammo does not need lead.  So I can focus in on making 50 cal musket balls for my Black Powder, while at the same time if I use all of my lead I can still produce crossbow bolts. Very convent. And let’s not gloss over the crossbow’s true shining point, you can recover ammunition and therefor have to carry less initially. The only weapon I have sought out was a Two Shot Crossbow, needed the extra damage to keep it pertinent. 
---
TLDNR: I’m a role player,  I’m not hanging up the bow because my desired prefix on it got a very appropriate nerf. 
---
Yea that why I always have bulk items in my inventory when i buy them. And are never used unless I junk them to get the items in the bulk.
---
Yeah exactly. Make it consistent across added damage perks. 
---
My mistake, but equally ridiculous.
---
Yes, brand new glitch - they fixed accidental mods scrapping but introduced new bug along the way - now you have to manually scrap bulk to use materials. Those developers are pathetic bunglers...
---
I don't think it's a change to carry weight, but the maximum amount of weight you can have on you and move at all. Some players had over 10k pounds on them and slowly walked everywhere. Now you have the same carry weight but once you got 1500 pounds over you cannot move.
---
Or is there a bug in the excavator armor I am not aware of?
---
But pet Mothman though?
---
No it's like every 22 hours or so. 
---
I think that comment took you out of the running, bruh.  Equal partnership squirrel and lion alike.
---
That's fair.  I'm a programmer and data scientist but we don't have or need QA.  I have no idea how the QA process even works.
---
Only the dupers, their minions and their muels... I lost some things but I'm not gonna cry.
---
&gt; Which weapons do you believe need a buff? I've seen a few people mentioning certain energy weapons but it would be good to get your thoughts
---
LoneVaultWanderer, thank you for opening channels here.  
---
I'd like to chime in and say that Flamers are definitely in need of a balance-pass, most notably in terms of ammo-consumption and replenishment.  Currently even with Ammo Crafter and Super-Duper, it's not even a zero-sum game, it's actively negative.  If either ammo consumption or replenishment can be addressed, or even both, the Flamer will go a long way towards becoming more attractive amongst players.  It's base damage and mod-enhanced damage currently are not scaled proportionally with the bullet-sponge NPC's in play at this time.  I'd suggest a +25% to +35% increase across the board to keep them able to maintain cost-effectiveness in terms of ammunition-to-kill expenditures.
---
On the opposite front is the cryolator, which is performing wonderfully in terms of crowd-control, making it a sleeper-weapon amongst the the end-game players.  It's very nearly in a perfect place at the moment, so I feel like I should state for the record that when your dev team performs their balance pass for Energy Weapons, that they take care not to disrupt what is already working.  The only thing that the Cryolator could stand improvement in is the common fault in all energy weapons- accelerated decrepitude.  Once you address the rate of degradation, it will be in a perfect situation. 
---
All but one type of flying enemy "flies" at approximately head height making it completely irrelevant.
---
And clipboards and anything that could give you gears and springs will be gone. Also, servers would be suicidal at that point keeping track of every single existing item rendering out with every container and loose item in the world.
---
You sound like a pleasant person with a lot of friends. My mistake, but that is still just as ridiculous. Nothing suggests that either. The expensive in game items are there as end game cap sinks, caps are not hard to get, and you can still earn plans for free!
---
"the game works for me so that means it works for everyone else"
---
The most idiotic stance on this sub. Willful ignorance will be the death of this game. You can like the game and still be critical of it's flaws, which it objectively has many of, regardless of your *subjective* experience. To deny that anything is wrong is telling Bethesda that an unfinished game is acceptable. It's not. They know it needs work and have asked for our input to do so. Telling people to just suck it up is the worst and stupidest thing you can suggest at this point.
---
And disconnected with their fanbase.  
---
The minute they nerfed XP the first time I knew it was downhill from there. That told me that they were a company which believed the key to their games longevity was to keep players playing what little content they had for as long as possible instead of working to crank out new content.
---
So this update really doesn't surprise me at all. In fact, I told all my friends, who stopped playing a little bit after I did, that this would happen eventually. It seemed inevitable to me between the vendor cap limits, the damage/XP nerfs, the damage bug (which I doubt was a bug), the fixing of server hopping benefits (such as cap runs). The only thing left to fuck with was perk cards.
---
Right??? Especially with all the posts complaining about how weak guns are, and how it takes way too many shots to kill monsters, and how guns break too quickly. Nerfing guns is just about the worst way to respond to whatever problem they saw.
---
I don't think I've seen a single person complain that some guns were too powerful, but I have seen countless threads about underpowered guns that break too quickly. This whole situation just seems so disconnected from the community and what the players are actually saying.
---
I have spent 3 hours just reading these posts. Most of them were legitimate issues and haven't seen any "i am leaving byeee"  posts. It's sad to see this kind of censorship on reddit, will stop coming here if that's the case. Yikes
---
What people seem to not understand is that one server can have issues that another server doesn't. So maybe rebuilding your database helped or maybe you got into a server that had less issues. Either way im glad the game is running better for you
---
Take your upvote and go to work. 
---
What you're asking for is for every build type to be balanced by being built identically. That's boring.
---
Ah, the classic kids story about the little engine who could.
---
I agree, they're pretty much useless now. I pick up guns from shitty level 30s and they are better then the TSEs I have. 
---
The same thing we do after the base gameplay of FO3/4/NV. You know the stories, quests, characters, where to get and find stuff. It's called roleplaying and honestly, I havent been able to meld my own character in a Fallout game until now in just the base game. I can have a character pre-war who's aged or someone born in the vault who might not be able to remain mentally sound in the post-apocalypse.
---
Your guns are probably breaking fast because you’re using it more than prepatch. 
---
what weapon has that kind of repair on it to last 3 days?
---
I stopped playing F76 because 90% of what I did was the shit I hated to do in other Fallout games. Plus the devs trying their hardest to make the game worse with each patch.
---
Why is this getting downvotes?
---
Nah if he offloaded his caps (he will have) you get literally nothing for it.
---
They are already mostly identical if you want to go max damage. 
---
Yeah, only when there’s enough open space. The limitation is still there.  Can’t do jack shit until it lands so all those perks? Not doing anything. 
---
In our company, when we fix any bug, we write a unit test for this bug. And if someone messes with the branches and returns the old code back, the test will not work and the corrupted code will not be released.
---
We do not have our own QA, but that is why we have many mechanisms that will stop the conveyor and prevent our customers from suffering.
---
Is this real? Censorship? How much is buggedthesda paying you???
---
Damn straight
---
**People are going to get scammed**
---
"Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others’ equipment for a cheaper price."
---
Do the devs realize that we cant mod or craft in the trade menu? Players would have to hand over their gear and mats to get their equipment modded. 
---
Furthermore, the people who exploited and duped are going to be the ones with all the plans and recipes that we have to "trust" our gear with when we want it modded. You guys basically rewarded the exploiters.
---
This is like saying that toyota should give you a refund bc they released a new car and yours is not the flagship anymore lol
---
You used it since day1, now it's shit deal with it, meta will change the only reason i see people being crybabies are if they bought tse with real money lol fk them, move on
---
I run makeshift warrior and a high natural durability deathclaw gauntlet or knuckles mostly
---
I like how this person thinks.
---
I haven't used either of these perks in my two builds so I am not affected by the nerfs but freeing up perk points sounds better that flat out dropping their abilities.
---
I logged in yesterday after patch to see what was different. Upon logging out i got hit with infinite loading screen; said to myself "no more of this s☆☆t". Probably not going back to fo76 for awhile.
---
True, I mean I guess servers can cause crashes but I would like to think most server issues would result in a disconnect not a game crash. 
---
I joined multiple servers as I was trying to find Dense plans after the database rebuild and had no issues so it wasnt just 1 good server. 
---
Having to wait 30 seconds or so for the enemy to land while it can't damage you isn't balance. You know that.
---
A coop version of fallout 4 would have been amazing. 
---
Ahh damn, forgot all about Sturdy Frame.  Haven't done anything with it in so long I forgot I even had it.  Thanks everyone
---
Chugga, chugga, chugga. Chugga, chugga. Toot, toot !
---
I think that euphemism is spot on..
---
I am not subscribed. Like I said it shows up in /r/all. 
---
Apparently because there are so many people on this subreddit that would rather shit on the game than simply get on with their life. 
---
You are probably restocking their caps by buying s bunch of stuff.  Every time you buy something about 20% (don’t know exact number) of the caps spent gets put into their pool again.
---
Just shut the servers down entirely honestly. Move on while fallout has any good will left at all
---
They are lying.  Last patch I found the trade left bug in 10 mins.  Took less than an hour to discover the bulk junk not repairing items. 
---
Hire me Bethesda, I can find most bugs in a matter of hours.  But I'm guessing they knew about them and pushed the update anyways.  There is no way they have a QA team.    
---
Have a look at tarkov😂
---
I stopped playing about 4 weeks ago. Everything I’m seeing isn’t exactly making want to play again. Complete lack of content. 
---
It's a game, not a government.
---
I'm on the other side of of your job. I debug, QA, and inform the programmers what needs to be done/changed (with full comments on suggested changes, of course). I hate merging patches and I can see what might have gone wrong. Half the time the engineer they get to do it didn't have anything to do with the current changes, just a page of file logs and dates.
---
One small request still. Please fix the "hooded rags" outfit so it counts as over armor.
---
Think I have this mod in my stash. Brought it with the hope of fitting to All Rise but it doesn't. On ps4 if you want to trade it. Won't be online until Thursday night though.
---
Na I already have them, just have extras to sale and Im trying to find a price lower then vendor that people might be interested in paying. Im more irritated that we were suppose to get all plans that weren't rare rewards and instead some seem to be gone forever. 
---
13 ppl, uninstalled btw.
---
&gt; from not played to vibrant for 3-4 years.
---
ros' peak of players was before the reworking of sets as they are now. their braindead way of balancing is partly what killed the game. jUsT BuFf EvErYThInG

No. Ive play the same everyday. Fast travel to locations and clear eneimies. Thats all i do. 
---
He is deleting posts from reddit and bethesda forums.
---
People ask for interaction from bethesda, people are angry that community managers are replying to people. Nothing will ever please this fanbase
---
They'd be extremely useful considering Everytime I fast travel, I literally fall off a mountain.
---
Yeah, so the Red Bulls getting expensive so we got you fizzes and we're going to need you to move your desk to the basement.
---
This here is so sad.
---
Bethesda shame on you. You are destroying everything you've accomplished. 
---
But on the other side.. It's so funny to see a multimillion Corp. crumbling and going down.  Go ahead! 
---
&gt; They've permanently damaged the image of the Fallout franchise, in a way that FO:Tactics never did.
---
Hey man, I bet there were dozens of us who liked Fallout Tactics! Dozens!
---
I never expected it to be a sequel to FO2 - and what it did, it did reasonably well (it was no Jagged Alliance 2 of course, but nothing is). It's a shame Micro Forte didn't get a chance to do a sequel, they could've improved on a lot of things and make it a really good game.
---
I tried to get my wife to try 76 along with me. She played for ten minutes, with several big bugs from the moment she started, and just quit. I, of course, would rather play a video game with her. So, we're waiting for Generation Zero. We played the Division together, but TD2 just seems very dodgy. Generation Zero looks very promising, and it's a bit cheaper. Plus, 80s Sweden nostalgia. ;) 
---
I logged in after the patch right near the Watoga vendor and genuinely thought the server had glitched when I saw the list of stuff he had for sale. Great decision Bethesda, now I just need to find a way of getting more caps haha.
---
Hreat, now they're gonna nerf it, congrats OP
---
Whilst there are some overreactions here, a lot of the negativity has been building from the support provided since release. Balance issues and minor bugs plague the game. A decent chunk of quality of life changes are badly needed too. 
---
There are many bugs that shouldn't be in any released game which still haven't been sorted. The fact that the latest patch brought back old bugs shows the dev team are at best callous, possibly just incompetent at worst. That's a colossal error that somehow wasn't picked up in QA, is the management poor or do people genuinely not care about the quality of their work? 
---
A patch every couple of weeks that fixes a few minor issues and introduces other bugs is disappointing for the dedicated fans who actually enjoy the game and want to see it succeed. As a longterm Fallout fan it's my fear that the entire franchise has lost a decent bit of goodwill that was built up before this. It might have a knock on effect on future Fallout games being vilified by the masses simply because of the sour taste F76 is/has given. 
---
Most folk on this sub like the game and want to see it do well, with the catastrophic launch and reception there hasn't been a well implemented support plan to make this game as good as we know it can be. 
---
let us sell or scrap our old legendaries and sell ammo please.
---
Outrage era?  Game has actually regressed to a worse state than 2 patches ago.  The game is 3 months old and still hasn't got past the beta stage.
---
Game was rushed.  Consumers were lied to and those like me who out hundreds of hours into the game, have had enough of broken promises and pure and utter incompetency.
---
Screenshot of Weapons,Apperal,and Junk pls this means nothing. I got 6 lb of Bobbypins in my inv
---
Not a fan, clearly this one is.
---
That's a fair point. I work with client facing software, but it's not video game related. Maybe regression testing isn't really doable in gaming.
---
I use to go through about 500 bullets before needing to repair them which isnt alot at all really and now its like 200 bullets i kept count after the third time it broke in 2 hours. 
---
RNG doesn't mean that all outcomes have the same probability of occurring. For an example, go back to a *true* RNG: rolling dice.
---
Dungeons &amp; Dragons is notorious for the ability to randomly determine stuff (loot, encounters, equipment, spell effects, etc.) by rolling (a d20 or percentile) against a table of possible results. Especially when percentile dice are called for, it's common for one outcome to be attained by rolling multiple numbers. For instance, a roll of 1-10 on a spell effect might mean that a teleportation failed, while 11-25 places the caster a certain distance from the location , etc.  The various outcomes do not have an equal chance of occurring, but they are still the result of an RNG.
---
That being said, I think it's likely that the relative rarity of certain plans was completely intentional as a way to prolong player attention. Furthermore, I think that the elimination of rarity was motivated by an inability to prevent server-hop-farming, and replaced by increased prices to make acquiring the plans still require extended play--not from checking vendors daily in hopes of catching a rare plan, but from farming caps. I don't believe their "player economy" explanation at all.
---
Too bad there is no stash in Enclave bunker... I would have put on ranger hat and military fatiques to make this shot more epic =)
---
I'm not sure which power armor bug you mean, I still log in with 500+ carry weight until I get out of my power armor and it resets back to normal. 
---
There's hundreds of people using it, chat is very active.  
---
The modder putted a "Global" channel, a "Trade" channel, even clans and groups and other stuff, it's really cool.
---
Great comment. Im genuinely impressed. Solid points without being an ass.  Good show
---
That isn’t what that says . They are talking about post that say things like . Patch is last straw I’m leaving the game and I no longer will buy from this company.  Post like these are not productive it’s more like a teen saying “ I hate my life I’m running away “ . I for one and glad I’ll see less of them. 
---
Yikes, well at least they made it to now. My beta group died about a week after launch. We did a few queens and then people started disappearing one by one. Now there is only me.
---
Game QA?  (If a different industry, then not too surprising if it’s more strict, well defined, slower to release, ...)
---
It seems like they could at least use a public test realm (get feedback and free testing in parallel with the in-house testing).  They didn’t even do the thing this time where consoles get it a week later than PCs.
---
Absolutely this.  For my work we branch basically everything so that tracing bugs is a snap.  We also tack on history internally so that our fuck ups become glaringly obvious when reviewing problems.
---
Probably the most logical statement I have read on this and I could not agree more! 
---
You are a troll attempting to antagonize me. And yes the entitlement is real. We are entitled to a working game when we spend $60 on it. And not only that, it should be a rewarding and fun experience, instead of an unrewarding and tedious chore.
---
Good sense of humour, i like it. Take your upvote 
---
I wondered why it wasn't fixing things despite having the materials. Even when I had the material it wasn't letting me repair things today.
---
18,000 caps for a serum is not a realistic goal. 
---
They try to be "helpful" the wrong way, it's pathetic and only proves the point, that even after 2 months after release game is still a festival of countless bugs and glitches, developers don't give a f... about players and with every change/new feature they introduce new bugs. And even for someone like me, with 300h+ in the game, I'm loosing patience for this beta-release the F76 is...
---
No double loads? Sure! 
---
I have triple loads.
---
Get the white knight perk in agility, your repair cost will drop to 1 ballistic fiber 
---
They are productive. It's a feedback to Bethesda that people are leaving the game because they messed up. You might be glad to see less negative posts but that then will just give you an image that is not at all reflective of the community's opinion. That is even less productive then posts that say nothing else other than leaving the game.
---
I really don't understand why you all keep bulked junk in your stash. Like why the hell do you do it? Why not just keep regular junk. I see no reason to bulk items other then sell them.
---
You don't know what the posts said because they were deleted. They could have deleted anything, and here you are trying to make excuses for censorship.
---
Like dense...
---
For the sake of argument, I'll go ahead and let "mostly identical" sit with a pin in it. Even doing that though, if you want to run around with Rocket and Grenade launchers you're going to almost always need the Ordinance perk to reduce the ammo weight. So if you made the damage perks the same, now the explosive people also need 2-3 more ranks just to lug around ammo to use their weapons. Most ballistic builds don't require weight reduction for their ammo. So putting their damage perks on par with each other would weaken the explosive build over time; either during long runs or things like the SBQ fight.
---
I used to get headaches too until I switched permanently to 3rd person.  That pretty much dictates a melee build but that is a viable build unlike explosions now.  
---
Nothing at all. 
---
What? You’ve fought scorchbeasts, waited it to land WITHOUT getting damaged? Are we playing the same game? Those acid and sonic attacks blow through buildings. “It can’t damage you”. I’m going to have to disagree with you on that. 
---
And try fighting an sb in the mire. It will NEVER land. So good luck running to find an open area getting spammed by sonic attacks just to give it space to land while NOT taking damage. 
---
Thanks for admitting to the censorship I do appreciate the honesty as to the number of "I'm leaving post" you have deleted. (Though it may actually be higher)
---
Hey do us a favor and actually play your own game you'd find everyones greivences before they post. K
---
AFAIK, there were dupers (or those who bought from them) who ate hundreds of explosive bobbleheads to boost the damage of the explosive legendary effect. There have been accounts of people being one-shotted throgh slap damage. Shouldn't be a problem anymore, since the explosive bobblehead doesn't stack anymore since the patch.
---
This. Maybe for a little cost of caps. Enclave with their technological marvel could have a computer which reprogram your mind or something 
---
I was putting off buying them until they added to ability to tell which you know because I didn't want to waste caps on duplicates.
---
Cool cool cool.
---
Metro exodus looking good right now.... few new games on game pass in the mean time.
---
Everyone has this issue
---
Stop trying to hide the fact you are a behemoth!
---
&gt; now the explosive people also need 2-3 more ranks just to lug around ammo to use their weapons
---
? why? I really have no idea what you are talking about since i don't propose any chances for explosive perks, except maybe making it a 3 rank 60% damage and change other ones to be like that too.
---
I love this game, but it's like they're trying as hard as they can to make people not want to play. They have no viable plan for the economy in this game. They "fixed" cap stashes (the only way to make decent caps), I logged in and couldn't press y to search 8/10 I found(level 3 cap collector). I server hop to see if that fixes the issue. Spawn in, can't move. Commence getting destroyed by super mutants. Server hop again. I can move! Still can't press y to search caps stashes.. So now, not only can i not make more than 1400 caps a day, but vedor prices increased significantly. Join my friends team, and he starts telling me how bad it is that he's a level 174 explosive build, and his damage output was halved. We fast travel to do protest march(to test "event fixes") he's invisible and the event bugs out. 
---
You are making this game worse. Listen to us, we want to love this game! People are going to be mad. Bethesda showed us a game that a lot of us enjoyed, and now they are slowly ruining it in front of us.
---
I'm glad someone else understands, yes the TSE needed a nerf but what we got was way too much. No I should not be able to one shot a schorchbeast but it shouldn't take 12 shots to kill an enemy more than 100 levels lower than me either.
---
Of course it is. At the very least there should be a test validating the state of the bobby pin weight static value. Especially since it was changed in a patch which means part of the dev activity would have been to provide proof of work (ie. test results) to the peer reviewer.
---
Stayed positive about the game up until early December. At some point you have to admit that enough really is enough and take your place at the sidelines. Kept my ear to the ground ever since hoping Bethesda would finally start being the tiniest bit competent. Sounds like today really isn't the day. Suppose it's time to crawl back in the vault for hibernation. See you all at the end of this nuclear winter of the game. 
---
I have a pair of calibrated shocks on my X01. It also has the jetpack all from server hopping. 
---
Yeah I've had that bug happen like twice. Thankfully its pretty rare. The one i hate is when the game decides its shared loot with other people and I can see all my loot disappearing. I get that bs all the time and not just on the Queen.
---
Or you could just keep leveling up to unlock more perk cards and enjoy the struggle in the wasteland?
---
To add some more math, each plastic is .05, so each bulk you make uses .1. so if you were to bulk, say 150 steel into 5 bulk steel, your stash would get .5 lighter, the exact same as if you had taken those 10 pieces of plastic and dropped them. Every 10 bulk you make lightens your stash by 1 pound, simply because you removed 20 plastic. 
---
The previously mentioned lead and aluminum are the only exception where the per unit weight is lower in bulk form. This is almost certainly am oversight, and may or may not be corrected in some future patch. 
---
Personally, I still don't bother making a bulking habit just for those 2, as I generally turn whatever lead I have into ammo whenever I pass a tinker bench, and I only keep like 100-150 aluminum at a time.
---
Well, at least it isn't just me. Hope they hotfix this ASAP. Thanks!
---
Maybe break up your abusive relationship with this game and see for what it is: a bad game not deserving anyone's money, nor time. So get your refunds, warn others of this shoddy game and heads will roll when Zenimax gets the financial reports.
---
Crying over a game you already paid for is not going to work. They already got your money and are laughing all the way to the bank.
---
REFUND!
---
Melee needs to be nerfed
---
Pheonix has reset his limit on me 2 times tonight not buying only selling.  
---
That’s the life of MMO to extend the games life span
---
this is a joke. im pretty sure you were being sarcastic is well, but just in case, don't send me your username and password.
---
Duping still works, and it doesn't crash the server. The method you described is one old method. A different method still works. I can't say that I know this because I've *done* it, but I've witnessed the process and the results.
---
Keep thinking maybe Grahm is sitting on all the stuff I can't seem to find... but somehow I doubt it. I know for a fact Grafton used to cycle both BoS and Deep Pockets because thats how I got all mine so thats what really worries me that the huge pile stuff that doesn't seem to be at any venders just isn't in the game for the time being.
---
My guass rifle
---
You might as well skip the first borderlands it is pretty rough. The second one is way way better. The pre sequel is pretty good and you can get remasters of 2 and pre sequel on Xbox one. Very fun coop games.
---
They ain't deleting posts that complain about the new patch. They are deleting low effort shit posts. Big difference imo.
---
I'm sure any post that is constructive is safe.
---
Yes please buff the guns I had to resort back to hitting everything with a stick after the last patch.
---
r/SquaredCircle is leaking
---
We already had beta, they don't give a f... about our opinions of the game state - they do what they want and leave old bugs and glitches as they are. They can't even make a proper 21:9 aspect mode, while some dude who made mod even allow them to use his work to help players. They doesn't care at all....
---
Nope, got him earlier today and none of the things in this post are with him. 
---
Yea I’m done with 76 now. 
---
The tedious process of gathering materials has me on a constant push to find the best farming locations. My go to location unfortunately is still the pleasant Valley ski resort because I can find nothing better as an all around aluminum/steel/lead farm. I want to keep exploring all around Appalachia but it seems like i found the best farm location early into the game so there's no useful exploring for me to do. 
---
To late
---
Yeah for over 5000 caps. I have diligently vendor hopped selling crap the whole time i have been playing am at level 60 and only have 7000. I don't know how people can have enough to pay that high price.
---
I haven't been playing for several weeks. Has it really gotten that bad?
---
And science 2 
---
Mini nukes and grenades. They weren't that great before but i liked tossing them out of stealth. Already dropped my mini nuke launcher, barley scratched a lvl 50. Just not worth the weight now. Didn't use all the perks, that may be the big difference now but it was good enough for me to enjoy before. Now, not so much. Not game breaking but it would be if i cared 
---
this game is not even worth playing nyore wih i could get my money back
---
"Balance"
---
Figures, maybe next patch? Lmfao.
---
https://imgur.com/a/mCdsgLA Hmm, its almost as if you are full of it, regurgitating other troll posts.
---
Well, you aren't wrong 
---
   
---
The current patch is as if we had gone back, it broke again as if everything had been fixed with tape. 
---
New ‘patch’ was released tacked on to a build about two releases ago
---
So many regressed bugs...
---
Only if you are a little bit crazy. Then it can seem like a mountain out of a molehill.
---
With the game soon will be added to cereals, they need to find the way to monetize it - that's why most challenges doesn't register, to force you to buy atoms for real money...
---
Infinite load screens player frozen upon entering new world and the unrealistic bobby pin weight is back again. I also had to switch to melee just to efficiently kill anything
---
Which sucks for console players as they cannot use the mods and are stuck with the hand dealt to them. 
---
No, they won't because the fanbase is toxic as fuck atm
---
Yeah they told it as many other things, as they are fixing bugs and they fixed lots pf bugs i am living at today! For me Bethesda declaration is untrustable. I just was hoping they split PVP from PVE. Now a simple dog need 6 shot with shotgun. My greanades become useless against any enemies.
---
Missle launcher and fat man become just junks.
---
I dont do any PVP this is not call of duty black ops! just would like to kill a simple dog with 1-2 shot in body and super mutant with 1-2 shot in head.. Anyone know the real dimension and power about .50 caliber? It is used in war against aircrafts and war tanks, some bullets can penetrate a tank.
---
Now, about scorched beast when flying, they supposed to be like an "war aircraft" but i need like a 900-1000 .50 bullets to shot down when in fly.. 
---
I can see how many peoole before play FO76 now just stop play and bought another game.
---
Bethesda must just stop making videogames and start do other things! This is my last bethesda game.
---
“pickle chin ahh boi”
---
At least you can open a wet paper bag.
---
Oh no. Banking. There's worse to be feared than angry gamers in my world. Lol
---
hmm, gee I wonder if its the low  effort shit posters that are making posts concerning posts getting deleted. Nawwwwww.
---
I used a couple of frag mines and a car. Frags took out the car, bonus I can drop a third mine to detonate them at will. Car detonates taking out me and the griefer. Best part? I run pacifist.
---
Regression testing is always doable. It all depends on the scale. With non-automatable applications, you focus on core functionality for regression testing. For this game, i’d say logging in, moving around, inventory management, some combat. The weight of one particular item in game is probably at the bottom of that very long list. 
---
That’s why wa automation is not just “nice to have” anymore. It’s a necessity. 
---
That's the dream. I don't have a lot of luck with guns to get her to land either but I'm sure I'm doing something idiotically wrong.
---
The Bos armour mods are avaliable via RNG thrlugh the repeatable "forbidden knowledge" quest
---
Sigh..... seriously..... well I haven't crafted anything yet so thank you for the heads up.
---
lol too late.
---
It took me like 10 shotgun shells to kill a fucking scorched level 68 and a scorchbeast lvl 50 was a nightmare
---
Yep, this^ I'm sorry but a player vending machine lol that's not listening to the community. That's a pathetic attempt to appease the angry mod. They have nerfed perks no one asked for for reasons that make no sense. Okay so they nerfed white knight because they "didn't want it to feel like a mandatory perk" I did not use this perk as I didn't thinking applied to power armor since there's a perk that literally says power armor breaks slower, power patcher. But gun smith is a mandatory perk. Since guns break faster anyway. I'm not saying gun smith needs a nerf I'm showing the line of "logic" makes no sense.
---
Yeah I’m not a fan of the health increasing items either. But as long as I keep earning atoms in-game it’s not too bad yet.
---
IMO a lot of these price changes are part of the effort to regulate the market, and I buy their reasoning. They made most stuff “easier” to get but upped the cost to make sure everyone wasn’t getting everything right away. If the player economy really does pick up, then these actions absolutely will help it. 
---
And yeah, that serum is expensive. I haven’t seen any passed 5000-ish caps. But enclave serums are fairly late game items. I’m not mad about being asked to work for it. And there is a way to get mutations for free too. With a little added risk. 
---
I’ve been hitting things with a hammer but that doesn’t help me kill scorchbeasts lmao
---
Average one DC/force quit per hour, nothing changes in that matter for me - is as shitty as before. What's more, from last 5 days, 3 days I couldn't synchronize friends list and trade anything...
---
You're not alone brother... 
---
How do you unbulk?
---
Perks that lets you repair armor and weapons to 200%. My items don't need repair very often...
---
Less weight 
---
Nah, just angry people complaining about nerfs. I feel their pain but TSE weapons did deflate all challenge from the game. But since they left melee untouched Bethesda just created a meta shift. Laser weapons on the other hand are just as unviable as ever.
---
People here can't decide whether its garbage or the best thing ever. I quit a week after launch and check back every patch. It's been garbage literally the whole time.
---
You know QA can find all the bugs, and its up to Bethesda to fix them, right?
---
What did you expect? An incompetent, obsolete B-team developing a game on a 20 year old game engine. That's on you.
---
Try the various station vendors I guess. 
---
Wieght of items changed and are heavier ... Perk card changes are to extreme and don't seem to work right now ..tse weapons now do little to no damage compared to base guns.. bill stored items do not register when crafting items
---
It’s a side effect of a much needed fix. Items protected from the “scrap all” feature are now also protected from being auto-scrapped when crafting. 
---
Guess what!  Bulk packs are not able to be broken apart via the “scrap all” feature and must be broken down manually.  It’s like they didn’t even bother to test it to see if it works the way they intended. 
---
This.  I think they should call it public test server or something like it.  At least for PC, like I’ve played for other games.
---
Caps stashes. That was like my favorite thing to do. Maybe I will adapt. I don't know. I just don't like this change at all. I liked the caps stashes the way they were. How they were not containers. They disappeared when you collected them. And you got the little animation for Cap Collector. It was perfect the way it was.
---
He is deleting posts from reddit [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaer0/to\_the\_loweffort\_im\_leaving\_posts\_k/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaer0/to_the_loweffort_im_leaving_posts_k/)
---
How long did it take to fix duping again?
---
They might have a better game if they put in half the effort of the no effort posters. Then you might not have no effort posters to begin with :o This game is also the product of a company when a marketing team is in charge.
---
Not being able to trade but removing the correct mod fixed this. Bobby pins are heavy again. Plus I don't think armor or White Knight are giving their crafting bonuses at all.
---
Plans are so damn expensive
---
That's not fucking dumb as shit to anyone else?
---
I think its safe to say there a few malcontents attempting ( and succeeding at) making a civilized protest in to a hate train feeding frenzy.
---
I think your correct, but I believe those that were selling on eBay for actual $€£ were suoposedky using multi accounts.  Anyway think this is just reputations being trashed at this point.
---
So in other words they should play thier own game and see these issues before they release them upon us.
---
Why is anybody bulking stuff anyway?  It just wastes plastic.
---
Good grief, compensating for a small member no doubt.
---
I've fought the queen enough to know unless someone was stacking Bobbleheads, TSE didn't crush her.
---
The new bugs that I've personally experienced:
---
Cap stashes now (usually) have only 1 cap in them. You can't server hop for them anymore. And, even though it sounds like they all are supposed to be fixed static containers, either some aren't or they removed some stashes.
---
The headlamp mods for power armors are now being marked as items from the Atomic Shop.
---
Mutations randomly stop working. (This is fixed by switching servers.)
---
While server hopping for random events near the Charleston Station, less and less things are loading in. At first the weapons bench in the train station stopped showing up. Now the door to where the vendor bot is has disappeared. (My guess is that entirely closing the game will fix this, but haven't tried yet.)
---
Can’t be any worse than now lol. Why do you find it so hard to hold these people accountable for what they do ? We paid for this game, it’s the fans that pay them and most aren’t happy
---
All I want is for pacifist enabled unwanted players to receive only 1 point of slap damage at a time (so hardcoded, not some percentage), and all CAMP items of those players to receive the same benefit.
---
Go ahead and grind your way through my wall. You may as well use your fists to save ammo.
---
I believe you scrap it and it unbulks but I'd only try it on 1 so you don't lose a bunch of materials
---
Uh...  no. The only junk items that benefit (in reduced weight) from being bulked are lead and aluminum. 
---
Ditto
---
I'm unstable and irrational sometimes. Sorry.
---
But bulking *increases* the number of things in your stash.
---
The loading screen is worse now. Thats about all.
---
It hitches now, during loading .. dunno why. Happened last update and is even worse this update.
---
Dude, come on, bad games cannot be made by bad devs, only bad management.
---
With this newest update, 1/29/19, Bethesda has; destroyed my character build, destroyed the damage output of my weapons, and explosives, destroyed my weight carrying, and storage capacity, introduced new bugs into an already insanely bugged out game, destroyed legendary loot, and basically turned this game into a very tedious smash and grab.
---
Gone is what fun could be gotten out of this game.
---
I'm gone, no more hyped up Bethesda games for me.
---
You got my money, now run. You don't have to answer to your fans, just make it look like it.
---
In my field, there's sections in our test workbook to test stuff from previous releases. But like you said, it depends how the scope was built out. I guess it makes me just a little sad to see a QA team lacking some controls or resources. Especially at a big company.
---
Scrap menu, same as you’d scrap any other protected item, like an assaultron head or composite ski. 
---
Go back to the OP and reread and then reread my post.
---
That's on you, I've never had to carry more than 40 Bobby pins 
---
This is what absolutely boggles the mind. There's a max of 1400 daily caps from vendors, and a smaller amount from other sources. That's not a lot.
---
People who sold duped items for caps aren't hurt by this (unless they're bad at selling). People like me, who benefitted from duping via a giant stack of Nuka cola to be consumed for the caps, feel a pinch, maybe. 
---
Anyone who only played legitimately, and everyone who picks up the game going forward, can kiss aspirations of being a crafter goodbye. Plans for the best weapons are unaffordable. 
---
This change is the opposite of motivation not to exploit 
---
Problem is, now we don't have really viable weapon builds and you have 2 choices - force yourself to play melee or quit/wait for weapon buffs (very unlike)...
---
Not about they said in bethesda.net but what about they must do!!
---
I’ve been out of the game since early Jan because of absolute needed changes that just didn’t come. I’ve got hope that down the line they fix this, but for now I’m glad I don’t play anymore.
---
Soooo you're telling me getting hit by a Diseased Ghoul is a good thing now?
---
Well idk then bc the wiki says level 15 to 44 but maybe it got changed after the update
---
After days of searcing the decision, I found your video on youtube and then this post. Seems like no one else has the same problem. I've been chatting with tech support several days, but still no result. I tried to reinstall the game and even my win10. But these glitches are on the same place. Maybe the game should look like this?
---
It's a line of source code appearing on the page when it's not supposed to 
---
The problem with these type of posts is you really don't know if the OP is speaking truth or not, plus there is much information missing from this.
---
Is the account "locked" or in a "Banned" state?   I assume its "Banned".
---
I notice he mentioned he is working on Mods.  Was the OP a cheater who did injection to do things/get things in game your not supposed to?
---
Was this guy a duper that got caught?
---
Sure this OP wont admit to any of the above really.   
---
All I can say is I hope Bethesda investigates the account and makes determination based on their findings.
---
As someone who's played MechWarrior Online consistently for the last four or five years, I find all this drama amusing and a very deja vu.
---
All i know is that that update will probably a shotshow again and i will have a blast reading all the threads in this sub 
---
Suggested this a few days back 
---
I can't wear underarmor with it, period. Equipping the costume deequips my underarmor (Vault, Enclave, Casual).
---
Request for the Atom Shop:
---
Could we have some solid colour paint jobs for the Power Armour? I had purple armour in FO4. I would like to have a choice of Purple and Matt Black. I'm sure others would also like Red as well.  
---
A little naive to think that imo

Oh, well ok! If anyone asks just tell them I said it was ok.
---
They just have to close this beta-release until it's really ready - it's been more than 2 months and soo many problems aren't solved while they introduce new ones...
---
I feel sorry for the people I sold them too lmao. 
---
My mole miners claw without any one handed perks with full strength (for shotguns) does pretty much the same damage as my ts hunter does with full rifleman perks

NMS is pretty awesome. Sure it got off to a rough start but it’s recovered rather well. Free updates (and I mean dlc type updates). Super friendly Reddit community too. 
---
Wierd, my friend got a duplicate base.  Luckily he did not get banned for it.
---
I would like to be hired as a beta tester. I'll be better than the current lol
---
Hasn't anybody ever told you those vacuum pumps don't work?  Or are you using the pills?
---
Fell asleep in the title. Came here for the nap. 
---
Thanks, OP snoozerloser
---
Exactly. This is why i’m really disappointed at what happened on this patch. We’re both in IT and we know why these things happen and we KNOW there are processes and automation available to prevent these from happening. Regressions are the worst and are tbh unavoidable, but bringing back an old bug? That’s just really sad. Even before qa, that should have been caught by code review or the repo system. Sheesh. 
---
I'll say this.
---
It's their own fault that 1500 max weight is not enough. There is no reason to hold onto everything.
---
I run at about 90-130 weight out of 220 all the time. Even before this patch. My stash is at around 480/600. Level 100 and no weight issue, ever. :).
---
i checked the jobs listing, they are looking for QA testers in Texas.
---
lolololol
---
I had that bug in a nuke zone once. But I don’t think I manually reequipped. It gave me the message and did the animation, then I had the gun again. Took about 10 minutes before I realized that the gun really was broken, and I shouldn’t be able to use it.
---
That was my first thought as well, but after reading many of the feedback posts yesterday (many deleted now by mods) and today, I think there is undeniable mounting evidence the quality of the patch is just not there.  
---
Good riddance to the ones that duped and those that were bobble stacking one shotting pacifist players tho 😁
---
Seriously, Bethesda should be recruiting from here.
---
Bethesda must be paying the mods the rest of the loose change they found around the studio.
---
When I come back I’ll tell you what Bubba used for a penis!
---
His ticket is probably because he got banned for making mods.  Meaning he has to do injection to get the mods to work and might have gotten flagged from a cheat scanner.
---
Got mine in Watoga station 
---
The first wholesome discussion for the recent issue.
---
&gt; I've bulked almost everything to cram as much junk as possible into my stash...
---
Which was a waste of time, because the only reason you got "more" stuff in your stash is because you wasted a lot of plastic.
---
Oh, and now the crash on exit to desktop is back.  Great job
---
Yeah, recruit actual gamers because the people they have now must not know how the game should properly run.
---
i have mine on the road next to the train station by the top of the world, there is a junk recourse which is nice, it is centrally located and graham sometimes visit
---
&gt;when you take away the fact that it was so obviously not designed to be multiplayer and was made so at the 11th hour.
---
76 was meant to be multiplayer from the very first concept of it. Before it was even pitched as a game, it started as Bethesda wanting to add multiplayer for fallout 4. They realized that it would need a bigger map, different quest structure, and a new system for levels and perks; basically, if they wanted to do it, it would need to be a whole separate standalone game, and so they went for it. Multiplayer isn't an 11th hour addition to 76; it is the whole reason 76 exists.
---
Hey now you quit taking about this
---
I wasn't even asking for a complete respec which would obviously be appreciated by good portion of the player base. The basis of my argument is I play a melee build that likes to use explosives for fun, in 103 levels I have never found a TSE and the only explosive I own is a Cryolater.
---
I feel that when there have been substantial changes to perk that would have possibly changed the way a player decided to pick and invest in that perk that the points should be refunded. You could put a limited time frame on the change if you would like.
---
And yes I understand you can just get more levels to move points around and pick other perks. The point is people invested time to get those perks the way they where, not the way they way they are now. If not for the TSE hot button I don't think this would have gotten any traction but the argument can be made for any substantial perk changes.
---
Fallout 76 has great potential and I enjoy the game but when quests lines end, the map is filled out, your build budget is maxed, SBQ has taken a dirt nap a few times, the idea of running around White Springs / Watoga to get some levels to shift points and purchase new perks is just not a strong driving force. I thought it would be good business and a nice olive branch to a player base that has seen a tremendous amount of "oops" since the game went live.
---
Anyways, thanks for the response I appreciate it. 
---
Yep I shouldn’t have to spend hours farming screws to repair everything because things break so fast. 
---
Yes. And they'll nerf that too for more "balance."
---
&gt;ts hunt
---
this.
---
I’ve crashed a couple times but I’m used to that. What annoys me the most is that my favourite gun, vampires explosive 10mm pistol is so weak it might as well heal enemies. It takes 5 shots to kill a level 1 mr-handy with demo expert, guerilla perks and bloody mess. Adrenaline maxed too but it doesn’t help.
---
Hey,Todd. We were wondering where you went ! Welcome back !
---
Yes but he's right, my lever rifle went from 812 (yes that's too much) to 234 a plan Jane walk up to a work bench and craft it lever rifle does something like 150. So you're telling me that my 9 points for the rifleman perks, my 5 points for the demo expert perk, and 3 stars of legendary is only worth an additional 80ish damage?
---
*Insert passing on to dev team comment
---
I was stupid and posted it on you tube. Someone then reported me. https://youtu.be/z6PCunF3wYk
---
Agreed. We also don't test in production either. I had a "yikes" moment when we found out about dev rooms in live servers. Lol
---
I havent logged on since the patch rolled out but I got an alt with about 500,000 carry weight.
---
I wonder if hes alright..
---
No it is not. Other then aluminium and lead all materials have the same exact weight bulked or unbulked. Someone did a spreadsheet to prove that bulking isn't less weight, look it up, you are wasting your plastic for nothing. Maybe you think you have less weight because you are destroying the plastic in the process.
---
Same as the author. These overeactings are just disappointing. People since yesterday kill the game more than Bethesda in my point of view. Bethesda has lot of responsability in this disaster that is a fact no one say no. But since yesterday, people's crying are intolerable and productiveless 
---
Stealth in PvE is bugged pretty bad.
---
Lol busted! 
---
\s
---
Payday 2 already did that
---
But the cards have knives on them
---
And they're surprisingly useful *especially* for stealth
---
Incorrect
---
Old bugs coming back due to incompetence are not "new."
---
So that's why i'm getting 4.5 lck from day tripper...
---
can’t repair my weapons to 200% anymore. (lvl 3 weapon artisan and makeshift warrior lvl 5 are equipped) 
---
If you're really this stupid I feel bad for you. 
---
Tip: scrap your bulked items to craft. 
---
Money money money money ... Mooon eeehhhhhh~
---
So you rather have a crash for 2 weeks than a fix next day? Okay wish granted
---
What about those things wrecks the balance in either PvP or PvE?
---
Well if they deleted all posts complaining then we wouldn't have a front page left. There is plenty of places to voice your point of view if you are unhappy. I'm totally fine with them deleting low effort versions of what we have already got. They ain't helpful or constructive and are therefore pointless.
---
You are either:
---
1. an idiot.
---
2. a liar
---
3. a lunatic
---
Or, possibly all 3 at once.
---
Just scrap your bulked junk.  It's irritating, not "GAME BREAKING!!!"
---
I thought we were the beta testers
---
I’m almost convinced that all the developers just sit in a circle smashing their keyboards randomly trying to see who can scream “DUUUUUHHHHHHH” the loudest while they roll their eyes into the back of their head. Seems about right. One or two more fuck ups and I’ll be completely convinced.
---
That's what gets me. I started redoing my perks and realized I needed like 25 levels to rework my SPECIAL and perks to move off the explosives and then I just logged out. I'll be back next patch or whenever they let me respec. 
---
I heard from one of my mates that what bethesda are doing with fallout 76 and the merchandise around it is a common strategy before selling off the title squeezed as much out of it as possible and than sell the rights to someone else apprently bethesda havent been happy with fallout for a while now and they are also working on that new title so it makes sence although its all based on maybes nothing is confirmed.
---
I wanna know what the post said. OP pls repost as comment
---
Egotistical devs.  Need to swallow their pride and reach out to the modders.
---
...crouching underneath the queen to wreck her with a drill for over 10% of her damage each landing.
---
&gt; but it's like they're trying as hard as they can to make people not want to play 
---
Maybe you have a point. If the player base shrinks below a pre-set threshold there may be a legal get out clause that would enable Bethesda ZeniMax to shut down the servers and claim insurance, while collecting premiums.
---
Add cap taxes for 7% of every cap you make goes to the game, don't forget to tax CAMP bases, the more stuff you have the higher the taxes that you have to pay every 2 hours of game play or you get banned!
---
Uh well, stunlocking weapons was not good in PvP.
---
Hexes were fine in PvE but pretty much instakilled in PvP.
---
And the dark sword was a straight sword, with every benefit that involved, that also had the poise of a greatsword.
---
Have you played any of these games?
---
I love em, but they were by no means balanced in PvP and PvE.
---
I like this - there's plenty perks I haven't maxed because it's not necessary and would cost too many points anyway, so they could have gone with a fewer-points route instead of reducing the effectiveness of each point in a five-point card. I have no experience with power patcher because I dislike PA to begin with, so I don't know how it compares, but I like the way you think! 
---
I don't really have this issue at all.  I don't pick up anything unless it contains a tagged component. (Springs/Screws).  That's it.
---
I just go back to base, Scrap all, store junk.   Simple, once you adhere to your limits you set for yourself.   
---
Limit all junk to 100 of each junk component (some exceptions like steel, screws, springs, lead).  
---
I actually play MORE in Fallout 76 than in Fallout 4.  I had to build tons of settlements and waste tons of time doing them all.  Plus all the "defend settlement" crap quests that popped up all the time.  I wished I could turn those off without mods.
---
I have plenty of room for junk, some room for Aid items and a few non-heavy weapons plus 4 PA.
---
When I start getting too much junk, I craft a bunch of armor pieces that might use that component, scrap them and move on.  (About 5 mins)
---
Pthey didn’t even bother changing the way to access it from fo4. Wow guys. I still love fallout, and i’m still playing 76, but there’s just too many smh moments here. 
---
But that's us !
---
&gt; A few things get nerfed
---
"Balance" according to Bethesda is nerfing. Its not about fixing anything for the greater good, its about extending stale gameplay with pointless grinding.
---
I've already got rid of this game. I stuck bhy it through until around late December but I can't see a vision or any direction that they have or are taking this game.
---
Does it turn me off from future Bethesda titles? No.
---
Is it immeasurably dissapointing? Yes.
---
That’d make it incredibly obvious if they did that. Low effort complaints should be placed into a sticky thread, not deleted. They bought the game, they’re entitled to an opinion even if they’re not the greatest with words. 
---
I would like to ask you if its possible to actually make ATOM shop costumes actually costumes instead of taking over our under-armors? EX. The nuka-girl and your new Unstopables costumes.
---
Are you the last person on earth to hear that the SBQ scales on the number of players?
---
Yeah I'm not gonna chance letting someone mod my gun unless they introduce a feature that garentees I'll get it back shit server could disconnect then bye bye gun
---
I'll stop preordering games when the internet speeds in my area catches up to the rest of the world. I could care less about the preorder bonuses and glib, but the preloading of games is a godsend for people like me who live in bfe.
---
Hey look dude, they didn't have enough time to implement this. Get off their back. Do you- do you even have any idea how long it takes to program in vaguely p2w atom show costumes, roll back the bobbypins and reskin combat armor so that looks like a kid scribbled on it with a crayon?!?!
---
See I feel the annoyance of constantly managing bars that go down even when you're doing nothing.  I think the only game thats pulled it off in the survival genre recently is Subnautica, at least there was no shortage of food or water, plus the modes where it wasnt an issue.
---
The buzzkill from not being able to sit back and just enjoy the scenery is an complete ball breaker, especially in a series that I've enjoyed a lot of sightseeing and vague meandering
---
This subreddit != the general gaming player base, most of whom have no idea what a TSE even is.
---
The patch certainly has some problems, but the drama here from some folks is silly.
---
“Don’t worry, it’ll just work.”
---
-lord and saviour T.H
---
Getting kinda tired of this. Uninstalled now to make room for other games. I've waited long enough. Shame because there's a good game somewhere under the pile of shit.
---
I was thinking the same thing!   I have tons of those at my camp. (succulents and Potted plants)
---
In every aspect of humanity there are arseholes. Pick a section of society and ill point out the arseholes. Gaming is no different. Yes some people will get ripped, however ive been doing this for people since the game released and i have also had other people mod weapons and armor for me. Not been stung once yet and i will continue to show trust and love to the other players until they show me i need to adjust my attitude about it
---
I don't think it's a bug at all. Why else would the ripper be a level-5-creation melee weapon? 
---
The way PC servers are , you can already call them "beta servers"
---
Yup changed after update.  You no longer need to grind and scrap for Plans and Mods.  Only Caps.  So exciting! /s
---
Im a web programmer and I have to say as much as I loath QA I could not do my job with out them. 
---
I didn’t not understand the difference and i think you are massively over simplifying the idea to shoe horn your point., have you looked at the size of this games data files?  No xbox or ps4 will be able to host so there goes 35% of the game population with no option to local host.  Some PCs but not for 24 players.  You will have to rent server space, like Minecraft to run a private server.  1-4 people, maybe your pc can handle the host load, anymore than that and you will need to fork out cash for professional hosting services.  So I ask again, how much are you willing to pay to get your server hosted because free is a fucking pipe dream.
---
You got a receipt?
---
So I can no longer pick anything up? Guess it's time to refund the game. Oh well, its been fun.
---
Yeh
---
Yup exact same here, have a cryolator and 2 other decent weapons in my stash, no aid, some clothes but no armor, and basically the rest is mats, on my person I have my aid, armor, a lever action, a handmade, and a shotgun and I barely squeeze into my ultracite. God forbid I want to grab some steal for repairs and I all of a sudden can’t get home unless I hop in ol’ bumblebee
---
To be honest, I only really like running a queen for the mad variety of mobs that spawn with her. Queen is pointless to kill after you get the decon shower.
---
There you go
---
Apart from the wobbly rant, yes the game is in a bad way. Can’t see it getting better soon, there are other games out there that are worth playing. Try something new.
---
Honestly i feel like hik now. My 2 main guns are now at 190 damage and it takes me 4/5 shots to kill a lvl 68 mutants. So i actually feel like i would just be a dead weight in a queen fight ,as it would take me all my gun durability just to fight the random beasts....let alone the queen.She could literally fart on me laughing.
---
They have to do this to keep the console synched with PC versions.
---
If this is truly the case, then this is a failure of process and that’s up to the TL or manager. How they would let such an important part slip (merging) is baffling. A simple paper checklist would have avoided it. 
---
yea they should have buffed energy weapons way before nerfing anything 
---
The bulked material bug,  the resetting or rearranging of favorites problem, and the broken Mr Messenger event.
---
People are trying to tie this to the TSE but that wasn't in my thought process on the post. It could have been any perk that you "level up" and has substantial changes made to it. Not to give them any ideas but if "Batteries Included" was changed to not reduce the weight of fusion cores it would drastically change the perk.
---
This is beyond true. I found and vendored a level 20 TSE last night ; first one I've found mind you.
---
It did more with proper perks than my level 50 furious combat rifle. At level fucking 20 &gt;.&gt;, these complainers are nuts.
---
No need to be rude. Of course I've played these games.
---
I suck at PvP because it requires skills I have not developed. I don't see why that means that PvP and PvE aren't balanced.
---
Sure is
---
Please, it's an EA game. Please please wait for reviews and buy it 2 months after release.
---
I never want to buy the neon letters &amp; numbers again. Grinding out the caps for them once was enough. 
---
Can't fire what doesn't exist
---
Now now... Dont be harsh.  I have found some Handcrafted Ivory Revolver Receiver plans in plenty of them!
---
Man. I hope they don't have like one guy...
---
Thanks for rating my IQ, I like it when people do that 😊.
---
 Big if true
---
Ill never get me military power armor paint from fallout 4 back :(
---
Yes, don't think for yourself. Let others think for you. 
---
I am sure the entire origin of Fallout 76 is some Suit at Bethesda saw the ridiculous success of FortNite and then convincing everyone that Fallout can be that with just a few tweaks. The failure is probably being blamed on the development team I am sure. Making a multiplayer Fallout is not a bad idea but they should have sat down and taken the time to do it right. Mr Suit will be disappointed that his huge bonus based on success of this game did not come through.
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
The wendigo inside the cave is a raider I think 
---
And those narrow passages make it snug for PA.
---
They weight for me(ps4)
---
Yes!  got my upvote on this one.
---
When I said this when the game launched I got down voted to hell and back, people calling me a hater. Glad irony is a thing and all those people can now see the truth
---
Just tried to cure a mutation and i froze... 
---
Queen fights for me nowadays mean I fire my 2 best guns till they break, then melee until she's dead. Durability bars need a buff
---
&gt; Can’t see it getting better soon 
---
Or ever
---
I played for a few hours last night, no problems.  BUT I must add that most of the feedback being reported either does not apply to me or I didn’t notice.  
---
Last night I was just grabbing workshops, etc.   no nukes on the server I was on.  No disconnects, and no griefer bothering me, thank Mothman.
---
Im playing other games too. Im just tired of being robbed by massive game devs making shit games and charging full price and it taking a year to fix their mistakes
---
Not being rude.
---
But you genuinely have no idea what you're talking about in this case.
---
There are things in the game that can't be balanced, or aren't worth the time and effort it takes.
---
Example, hexes were cool in PvP and rewarded into/faith balancing, but in PvP resulted in one shots.
---
Cant really balance separately because of the way the game was set up, and so balance will suffer always on one side.
---
That's just how RPGs work, and what they shouldn't include PvP as anything other than an afterthought or purely non balance focused for fun only mode.
---
I just tested this, and they weigh the 0.1 per. I dropped 10, lost 1 lb. I dropped 20, lost 2 lb. Sorry, but they do weigh what's stated again.
---
Do you remember 3 months ago when you had to download the game like 3 times because their launcher was shit? That's when i realized they hired monkeys to do the work for this game
---
The mobs become bullet sponges at higher levels, guns NEED to be strong to compensate. It's not fun to have to fire 20 bullets into a single ghoul to kill it.
---
Camden park vendor I believe!
---
This is a solid idea.  A beta channel would be a great addition.  Bethesda can get playtesting done on a daily basis for minor changes/patches.  
---
That said, they need to have more QC to ensure branch mixups don’t occur with major updates.  
---
This might require some NDA players on a closed server.  End users will almost always find the mistakes.
---
I poke fun at the problems, but I work in the software industry.  Testing teams usually have a script to test changes which doesn’t take into account the odd things that players do.  
---
Yeah. I'm impressed with the reasonable discussion it spawned. Even people disagreeing. Must be too dry for most of this sub. Haha.
---
Have you considered they are aware but can’t or do anything about it?
---
same on the caps thing.  collected 5 cap stashes........all of them...... ONE MEASLY CAP
---
Bethesda is known to have a 'fuck patching' attitude, and all of their SP games were actually patched by the community (FO3, FO4, Oblivion, Skyrim, FNV). This is why there are still hundreds of issues - they're not used to providing this much support. That's the reason for the outrage that began during BETA phase, which was frowned upon on this sub. You are finally understanding that some of the issues will probably never be addressed or they will continue to be mishandled.
---
Bethesda is a terrible company and they deserve every ounce of criticism they are getting and more.
---
Who gives a flying fuck? 
---
Carry 10 and sell the rest and shut up about it. 
---
There is .. but there is no jet pack for the excavator armor.
---
He's at the amusement part Camden park.
---
Fuck. Two more fucks and I think I'll be done with this game. Too true.
---
Yet people really be out here downvoting, it’s like they don’t want to kill enemies quickly 
---
You’re right I can’t. That doesn’t invalidate the fact that you shouldn’t be able to farm hundreds of legendaries in a day or two, pop some mentats and throw a perk card on and buy every plan in game in no time. If you don’t want to work for things don’t play the game.
---
Here’s an example though of a game that doesn’t have restrictions. Red Dead Redemption 2.
---
You can hunt and sell everything all day long. You can then buy every gun/saddle/etc in no time at all. 
---
I stopped playing that a while back ... and how long has that been out? Not long. 
---
Yeah...got like 10lbs of them again, they pushed the weight back up 
---
Well that's the most inane conspiracy theory I've heard yet. People are entitled to their opinion sure, but when it's parroting a hundred other posts then what's the need to make a new one?
---
Ive been using revolvers and have loved it for 100 levels.  Im trying rifle build now because the pistol perks eat up all my agility slots, and there is  no anti armor perks.  So far, im finding the rifles more satisfying because i have room to play with perception and agility perks now.
---
Fuck. One more fuck and I'm done with this game 
---
That's certainly a point of view. However, in my point of view, I view this game as the MMO advertised and an Bethesda open world game. Both of those genres typically involve me coming back for more repeatedly. Fallout 76 is unlikely to involve that. 
---
Grafton protectron vendor (not the train station) has all excavator PA plans. 
---
Cap collector did almost nothing for me. So far with this new way I've found them more consistently even if I had already looted them today. Meaning I can count on those spawns. I've gotten only one cap but in average I'm getting about 50 in the container and another 50 when. Searched. I am having trouble not getting the option to search 
---
Next level thinking.
---
Rebuild the waste land by killing everyone you see
---
  What a strange thing to get so emotional over.
---
Bullet sponge is easily one of the biggest turn offs for me in this game, granted I reached level 60, but only because Im playing with friends and we keep finding other things to do, but in other games like Borderlands 2, it honestly just does scream bad game design, and if theres definitely something I wish us, the community, made enough noise for Bethesda to listen, is about bullet sponges.
---
Also I still dont understand why you cant repair guns like you can in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, itd be so much better, specialy if they added something like a jury rigger perk, that way we wouldnt have to waste resources every half an hour because my gattling plasma broke down yet again.
---
Hrm... You would think that they would not be that gullible.  PUBG was a well designed game with a very specific goal.   Online PVP arena like hunger games.  It was completely PVP.  
---
No story driven game is going to compete with a PVP only game because of the tuning and focus of the dev team.  Its very very difficult to provide everything a specialized game can do plus tons of PVE content.
---
Whelp moderators deleting comment in 3....2...1... and it's gone * yeah they're doing that need to make everything look good to the casual redditor looking to buy the game.
---
I'm more suprised that you had ten people who were willing to play this game in the first place.
---
For real. Like how many do you need? I have a few at a time. If one breaks I pick one up next time I see one.
---
Its 2019 for god sake. We have insane technology and games should not be and should not be allowed to be released in this sort of state. There is a law banning loot boxes.. so where the fuck is the law banning unfinished games making it to market
---
Could also be said about OP
---
Try Welch Station.
---
The most polite thing I can say about this response is that it is inadequate.
---
Admit that the prices were raised to stretch out the caps grind. I'd have more respect.
---
Ranged weapons so annoying to use and so useless, even more from this patch hahahaha LUL. 
---
They do. Dropped 50, lost 5 in wt. Quick maths. Just don't carry every bobby pin you own and you're fine though
---
TIL 12 players is all it takes for "massive multiplayer"
---
Or
---
Severely reduce their damage while inside a building or behind trees and cover.
---
If I’m sniping from a defensive position they shouldn’t be able to do full damage, or why bother to have ingame objects if we can’t use
---
Them?
---
After I climbed long climbs, like the Pylon or the Monorail, I just equip my PA w/Jetpack and jump staring straight down.  Shortly before impact I mash the jump button and only take minimal damage.  If you jump from that high even with PA and no jetpack you will still die.
---
In what world were demo expert, licensed plumber, and white knight so overpowered that they were necessary picks? 
---
Demo expert helped for explosives that were already so crazy underpowered, even before the nerf.
---
White knight is pointless because you can't end-game without power armor.
---
Licensed plumber? Who the hell even uses pipe weapons long enough?
---
There is a much higher law called "vote with your wallet" . Never ever give them any $$$ until they released a finished, playable product.
---
Cannot get a refund 2months after release
---
Right, they should do a beta on the test server for a week that players can log into separately. 
---
I had just took White Knight to 3\* to complement my change to a full melee built to have it stealth nerfed in this patch was galling. I shan't leave the game or over react, I shall adapt but as **Lyvidian123**  said before me, a much kinder way would have been to make White Knight a 2\* card freeing up a point for something else. 
---
As it is, I feel they slapped pure Armor users in the face for no reason and no advantage, just negatives really.
---
yep, saw an entire list of excavator plans there last night.  damn it was expensive though.  No calibrated shocks for me...yet.
---
No offense, but it was kinda obvious from the start that the game is an unfinished buggy mess. Or did you ignore all the reviews and endless torrent of videos on the subject?
---
That said I'm not excusing them releasing a title in this state - I gave it a fair chance in November/December, mostly because there weren't any other new games to play, had some fun exploring the map (which is about the only thing that's actually entertaining in this game) and now I'm totally done with it and off to greener pastures.  
---
The only thing that could potentially bring me back is a big expansion with a new landmass to explore. Raids and new "quests" won't do that given how shallow the gameplay is and how little skill is involved in it, grinding with terrible odds for slightly better gear (that's not even needed) won't do it either.  
---
Already out
---
Guess your out of luck and got to either wait it out or trash it.
---
There is a perception perk that ignores up to 75% armor on bugs called Exterminator, if Mirelurks count as bugs I can see how this could be pretty useful.   Other than that and what you mentioned I don't think so.   As far as other perks that are useful for rifle builds, I would suggest a Luck perk called Tormentor, and Bloody Mess and Glow Sighted are useful in their own way!   
---
I see.   Well I hope your case gets resolved very quickly.
---
Getting banned for a well known bug in the game is not good.  (as well as apology to at least you)
---
I got an email the other day saying they were still working on the manufacturing. It was like a one month update from the last one but said the same thing. 
---
Still have not received my atoms. 
---
Also please let them know that materials can't be split between your inventory and your stash.  It all has to be in one place or another.  Mildly annoying but if they are working on crafting materials anyway maybe they can go ahead and fix this one too.
---
I carry 3 at a time. The mini lock game is derp levels of easy.
---
Haha they can delete it.. but you cant hide the fact fallout is a shambles 
---
OP is Fake News
---
We need Kinggath xD
---
Really scared me when I saw it. Don't want to happen to anyone else.
---
Ill use it as a coaster for my drinks im not bothered 😂
---
1500 over max weight was a great idea I've never been that heavy (yes I realize the irony in that statement as my user name is fatboyonsofa lol)
---
I’m not at all yet at late game (lvl 25), so much of this post isn’t relevant to me. 
---
I had just one question: why does bobby pin weight matter? Afaik you retain used bobby pins if locks are successful, and unless lvl 3 locks are way harder than lvl 2 locks, there is no need to carry more than 5 at the time right? Bobby pins realistically shouldn’t weigh much at all, I agree. But you don’t have to carry 100 at the time right?Or am I missing something...?
---
Correction: ESO is not free to play.  You buy the game.  They do have free weekend events at times, to allow peeps to try the game.
---
It’s a common misperception.  
---
Glad you found something for it.
---
it already happened to me today. It was someone on my friends list who i have played with for weeks, too. I wanted my bloodied lever rifle modded because my TSE rife is terrible now.
---
Dev team is making a sound wave cannon called beast rend when you shoot the dragon I mean scorchbeast it will be forced to the ground 
---
Last night when trying to craft I found that I had to have the materials on my character (not in my stash) and not bulked to be able to craft the job.
---
insert bot comentary

the one guy right now https://media.giphy.com/media/4bWWKmUnn5E4/giphy.gif
---
In my opinion you don't know what you're talking about… none of us know what's in development process. 
---
Good thing I vendored mine before the patch cause I had 680 😂 1 cap each though so I nailed 670 caps on vendors that day.
---
Fingers crossed...
---
I just don't understand the "people are having fun with it, so let's destroy it" mentality. It's a game. It's supposed to be fun. If I wanted to have to work so much, I'd just play one of the several other (vastly superior) survival games on the market. I like fallout 76. Just let me like it, though.
---
Fuck, if they don't want to make the game we want, they should just give what it is now to the community. A lot of mod creators probably know more about building things with Bethesda's stuff than Bethesda does at this point...
---
I run auto pistol and rifle build.
---
I have no issue killing shit with and without legendary weapons, nothing minus a scorch beast takes "20 ammo". Most things die in 4-5 rounds, unless I'm being lazy and aiming at their bodies vs heads.
---
This is a management failure. Developers don't run the show.
---
For PC that mod on the nexus is amazing, I can actually see the SpamBeast as I ground it with my 3\* Enforcer buffed combat shotgun then melt their batty faces up close in less than 50 shells. Quite satisfying.
---
The loot is still pants but hey ho, such is life, such is Bethesda.
---
OP wrote a mod that provides text chat on PC. He's not a fucking cheater, he's a _hero_.
---
😂
---
Cannibalism perk and lead belly survival I see 
---
Last time I played was like a week after launch so since November 
---
I find efficiency to be fun.
---
Some of us are simply lower level and have the misfortune of running into much higher level enemies.  I’m at lvl 20 right now and while I sometimes get mobbed by lvl 31 scorched mobs I have yet to see an armor drop even close to my level.  Thus far I have only seen two PA pieces that are usable by me and since neither is a helmet I lose the flashlight by wearing them.  
---
This isn ‘t a question of “Get Good”.  There are some serious flaws in this game regarding durability that the devs seem unwilling to fix.

The poll
---
im the type to also spend real money on stupid in game shit , i havnt spent a cent on the atom store , maybe if they had immersive apocalpse looking stuff
---
I really wonder why they would have that broken flowers challenge two weeks in a row. Maybe they thought the patch was going to fix it.
---
That’s unfortunate 
---
For me the game crash instantly on start, I'm not even able to see the fucking bugthesda logo. The game game return to desktop right before that. 
---
Not at all. It's been in game development since it's beginning. Sadly it's easier to moan and claim a fix than work on gaming.
---
Shhh 🤫 
---
Depends what receiver you put on it.
---
i have been
---
He didn't do an injection though. It's just a chat overlay on the game.
---
I guess use a PC and move between both platforms as you need to, I know not an answer but for this game it may be worth it. The game is now so cheap to buy, I bought my copy for £16 UK, months ago, probably cheaper now.
---
Biased mods is a conspiracy theory? Interesting.
---
Whether it’s one person, a hundred or a thousand people.. the more people that raise their voice will be noticed a hell of a lot more than a small handful. Many people want change and since there’s no other avenue to place our displeasure the best way to do that is through popular forums like reddit. 
---
  "a tad too far" and "Salty cheese-addicted cucks",  ya I am definitely tracking the same amount of emotion between these 2 statements.
---
I thought mods were band (at least from what I read online)
---
shame, people still gives money to company with that attitude. I've paid \~$6 for F76, but I fell the pain of someone who payed 10x more...
---
I doubt it's about competence of the devs, but working time and old engine. If you go through the credits, there're quite a lot of people in QA. Looks like they worked under minimum time testing the game and patches and moved on to another game.
---
I found explosive rifle twice, but never with the TS aspect 
---
Except that it was true lol
---
Theres just nothing else I like right now. 
---
You mean there is code beneath this game, is this the Matrix?
---
I never played it when it was bad, I got it when it got released on Xbox. There’s 20+hrs of content that’s chill, beautiful, shallow and repetitive.    
---
It’s a game where you literally just explore and find new things, many (prolly all) survival games have deeper and more gameplay mechanics than NMS, but NMS has the charm and beauty of exploring the universe.
---
&gt;angry people complaining about nerfs...
---
Among other things, like the old bugs coming back, and lack of any new content.
---
Every change they make adds more grind. Seems to be intentional, which might explain why nothing is ever buffed, like energy weapons.
---
I gauge play figures by the Nuke warnings, when it first came out of BETA (not that it has really) I got a Nuke warning every 10 mins or so, now when I'm playing I am lucky to get one in a couple of hours play time. That tells you something...
---
How so? We have no idea why they increased the prices afaik. 
---
I assumed it was to balance the amount of time you would have to play for to obtain your plan, to offset the previous random nature of them appearing at the vendor.
---
Okay, picking up materials for your CAMP is not this dramatic. If it’s this time consuming you might be a hoarder. Food for thought.
---
I can adventure plenty and bring what I find back with me. Just keep in mind what you need vs what you want.
---
Ex:
---
You need those clipboards for springs ... but do you reallyyyy need that buttercup leg? Or that fire extinguisher sitting on the floor? 
---
No, it's not dumb. Allowing players to one-shot every enemy would be dumb. No good game does that. Most games have level caps to prevent high level enemies from getting too easy. If the game becomes trivial, players lose interest and quit.
---
2020 Should include mod support, IE everything else they attempt will be meaningless there after  &gt;,.,&gt;
---
Get outa here, really, if so LOL
---
He means rock melee again 
---
As someone who loves this game and has 400 hours played, they have to do this. They didnt add any endgame. It is what it is. 
---
LOL who needs new content?
---
But they're not continually improving it if every fucking patch introduces new bugs or reverts previously fixed bugs.
---
... And then there's shit like this... 
---
"we'll give you the (known) tag and easier access to plans - but we'll also jack the prices way the fuck up and still only allow you to make 1200-1400 a day from vendors.  Sorry for making you grind for plans, now grind for caps"
---
Nevermind the fact had the (known) tag been implemented from jump street (how the fuck it wasn't I'll never know) it'd have saved people thousands of caps wasted on shit they already knew
---
Might have to go back to playing Destiny 2, at least the bloody game works........ 
---
Not contradicting your own experience, but I play on a fairly aged rig and other than a few small hiccups, the game performs well for me. While I'm not a huge fan of grinding for mats, PvP, and some of the other things that come from being an online game, I actually have fun every time I play. I'm low level, but the damage I do feels correct: lower than me fall fast, same level or higher takes more work or is near impossible if 3x my level. 
---
This isn't to say your experience hasn't been terrible, and yeah, that would probably have me seething too. I just want you to be aware that the game doesn't play- or look like- it was made by "monkeys" to some of us, and I'd cool it a bit with the dehumanizing insults.
---
As with most memes there's always a subgroup that actually believes it and doesn't see the rest is not being serious. 
---
The moon landing conspiracy wasn't a widely carried conspiracy until people started making fun of it.
---
So the thing is the % doesn’t add to each other as in 
---
15% + 20% =  35% for 35 dmg reduction out of 100 dmg done
---
It’s more 
---
20% = 20 dmg reduction out of 100
---
And then 
---
15% = 12 dmg reduction out of 80
---
I guess the atomic shop team is the only one that actually works hard, so bravo to them
---
No you're right. The hoarder mentality just doesn't work in this game. It's just with the pins they had lowered the weight already so people are jumping on the fact it got (mistakenly I assume) reversed.
---
Management is responsible for this.
---
That would mean we'll get a hot fix or repair patch pretty quickly then if they realise what has happened.
---
Damn beat me to it 
---
I still think that it will be like no man sky f, but it seems that they only left one man  to fix the whole game and distributed all the equipment to other areas.
---
Not really. When you bring a product to market and then say " fuck all your input take our adjustments or lump it" and then drastically change key elements, yeah you're alienating possible return customers.
---
90% of the time the customer know exactly what they want, it most often isn't feasible to deliver and stay in business. This does not apply to a SOFTWARE company which has just gone about removing or undoing changes which were well received by customers and then introducing over the top knee jerk changes to other items.
---
It was, specifically WRT TSE, "people reeeing loud enough" which caused the nerfing of both Two Shot AND Explosive, which screwed over builds completely unrelated to TSE. But your customers deciding you've made a product shit really does mean you've made a shit product. When your customers tell you you've made a shot product you can't thumb your nose at them as say they are wrong. That isn't how it works. I agree the customer isn't always right but when you're trying to peddle something they don't want then yeah, they are. 
---
And the majority of people aren't idiots. The majority of them are average. There will be some idiots and some bright sparks but most average people are average. I work in a service industry and I know many idiotic requests from my customers would lead to people dying, literally.  But I also know workable solutions when I hear them from my customers on how I can improve safety and efficiency.  None of the changes made in the recent patch improve QOL or enhance game play (boring grind is not game play). 
---
Thank you for being dishonest and accusing me of something I didn't do because you could not think of a reply that actually refuted any of the points I made.
---
-Me
---
?what has the patch broke for you?
---
Any remaining trust or optimism I had for Bethesda.
---
Even on the sub everyone was saying:
---
1) Fix the duplication glitches
---
2) Make duped weapons obsolete by *adding stronger weapons and enemies.* You know... real endgame content. 
---
That’s in addition to a balance patch to make more than one or two types of weapons from being viable. 
---
&gt;  you'll end up with a massive plate of spaghetti that cannot be maintained.
---
Wait, isn't that a strict progress considering current code ?
---
I can say that BoS T-60 paint job is pathetic. It  only adds a red logo to the chest and red strip in the right arm...WOW I'm so impressed... :|
---
Yeah. Mods started deleting this kind of discussions.
---
\+9 at time of this comment but it goes up and down.
---
yup but having that 10 cap bounty isn't stopping you from playing the game solo and it even states in the article that other players will always be present ...
---
No! I missed the damn fruit hat and I'm really mad about it!
---
Yes 
---
What about MODUS???
---
The point is that all I needed to do was play for 10 minutes and I noticed the bulk crafting bug.  Why didn't Bethesda's patch testers notice this, or why was the patch released knowing this bug existed? It's amateurish. There are many gamers here that seem better suited.
---
I don’t lose AP, generators don’t work, and all of my copper is gone. I want that copper back bc I’ve never used any of it since beta and need it now for my camp 
---
If they intend to nerf everything down until it is on plain field with energy weapons they still need to nerf everything 3-4x times. Game will be unplayable.
---
I've never seen so much passion, patience and endurance from a fan base. They want so bad to love this game but they're constantly being handed shit sandwiches.   
---
Some more openness and communication from Bethesda would go a long way towards fixing this.   
---
The goodwill is there just waiting to be ignited. 
---
Word . Same here. Been defending game but f this s i say
---
Thanks for the forbidden knowledge, I'll look out for this.
---
Truth is Fo76 is worth $15. It can be enjoyed but is not worth $60 or to even play rn. If you don’t mind the disconnects and freezes (lol it came back wtf devs?) then this is a OK game to play.
---
Sounds good in theory.
---
**Until You Realize**
---
Most of the exp exploits
---
Dupe methods
---
Or 
---
All around cheats 
---
Were known during the closed beta phase.
---
Did the testers report them? Hell no. They made their YouTube videos and waited for the game to be released so they could get the views and subscribers.
---
**The Problem**
---
Is the fact they let the public test it and expected honest feedback to which they did not receive. The problem there in lies in the *lies* of the community itself. Now had they used real beta testers from bethesda many of these bugs and glitches may have very well been nipped in the butt. Never the less money talks and *greed poisons mens hearts*
---
Remember the Oblivion Radiant AI showcase?
---
Yes to modded servers. I suspect that that's when I'll be ready to tag back in. 
---
Melee weapons does more dmg than tse now. So he probably has assassins weapons with explosive bullets. Then his armor has the reduced dmg from players. So his build is strictly for pvp.
---
Nerfing everything to make game "longer". Not a good idea imo
---
why are they so expensive? What are they doing? It cost 600 on my alt.... I am very confused... we've removed rng but jacked up the prices? No thanks.
---
You need teammates. Which kind of sucks. I wish it worked alone since I solo. So I often just grab some level 30 kid (i'm level 100) and tell them the perk and to stay by me after I nuke Whitesprings and farm glowing creatures.
---
*Devs: You guys wanted mods to be unscrappable, we thought you wanted bulk items to be unscrappable too. You know incase you accidentally scrap the bulk items you wanted to sell*
---
Ok so when I typed this out I just meant it as a Skyrim reference but now I want it. Also sound wave cannon forcing a giant bat to land kinda makes sense seeing as the brotherhood used a sonic generator in a line in the sand 
---
that's stupid. GG Beth.
---
"What I really want is the crying, whining, complaining players to leave."
---
Then you can have your perfect game all to yourself? Like real Fallout bro? Amiright?
---
I'm going to add pistols to the discussion, as I don't believe they have been mentioned yet. But currently they are in a bad place- as in, anything and everything they do rifles do better. There is currently no reason to use them. They lack armor penetration and damage for bigger creatures like scorchbeasts and the queen, but don't have any means to make up for that.  This is compounded with the energy pistols that have all the same problems the rest of the energy weapons do.
---
I'm not trying to imply that pistols should be the same as rifles or other weapon classes, but there should be some reason to use them.  The gun runner perk is actually a fun perk to use with them - but it doesn't seem to stack with speed demon or squad manuevers, (and maybe +run speed weapons- I havent actually tested that one). It seems there is a maximum attainable run speed which hampers the perk.
---
Right now i think shotguns and rifles are in a good place, but pistols, energy weapons of all kinds, high ROF heavy weapons,  explosive-class weapons, "exotic" weapons all are underperforming.  And melee is over performing.  That kind of seems like a lot..
---
Thanks for opening the discussion about this, I appreciate your time you put into this game
---
Just put caps in the atom shop already!
---
I lost thousands of caps because a bug scrapping my mods in my inventory. Not sure when it started im sure i hate it was not fixed faster. I stopped playing after it and for sure not gonna waste more time in this game where devs allow this to not be fixed for very long time. 
---
might be interested, got discord and most of the people i play with regularly are less and less active everyday so i could try playing with new people. my game is broken at the moment because of the last patch but it shouldnt take too long to get fixed. let me know if you wanna team up, you can also add me on discord, helka.exe#0350
---
Loot refusing to load (on enemies or containers) and in a team and I couldn't be seen by other people on my team.
---
It’s clear that they HAVE been listening to us
---
It’s also clear that YOU don’t have your eyes open..
---
Did they do a good job? No, of course not..
---
But are they listening? Of course.. you think these attempts to fix these issues just fell out of the sky?
---
Stop trying to bash the game and the developers by making blatant lies to rally people. At least be honest.
---
They are listening and they are trying, they just need to get their shit together and try harder. I believe they’ve learned their lesson of using an old patch to build on a new one (they did something like that) and I’m sure they won’t be foolish enough to do it again ... although doing it in the first place was foolish to begin with.
---
bethesda is already taking note of this, soon we will have new skins at ridiculous prices 
---
I was planning to use mines to weaken them but explosive damage amounts to firecrackers lolz
---
I think it's worse. Don't wanna grind 3 times the caps when could just server hop a few times and get them.
---
People trade plans for lower price
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
When I said something similar to this a couple months ago all the Fanboys on this subreddit went into attack mode. I guess they're all keeping quiet now. 
---
Nobody is disputing any of that mate. But spamming the sub with the same low effort shit posts isn't constructive. Much better to discuss your problems in a post that's already speaking about it. I'd rather see one articulate post at the top page then a hundred low effort mimics that nobody will read.
---
People literally didn’t want to grind for caps in the game to buy a tse so they offered real money for an in game gun that was most likely duped
---
They didn't deserve it all the other times?
---
My TSE Handmade went from 2/3 hitting 68 mutants to 6/7 hits... definitely quitting for the moment till some new content is added or TSE or Demo gets slight buffed, I just don't have the time to play for 10 hours to re spec to a melee build. 
---
On a side note they added a "." to "Bullets explode for area damage." and it bothers me lol.
---
I noticed a bug with the gatling plasma a while ago. When you switch to the weapon it fires a few rounds and then forces a reload. Everytime you switch back to it it needs to reload even if you didn't fire a single shot the previous time. Very annoying
---
There’s always gonna be something to work towards in any game. I’d rather grind caps over rng server hoping for days/hours any day. 
---
My nuka cola girl outfit - I can't see my curves anymore since chest armor is above my outfit. GDI!
---
2 of the legendaries I killed today had nothing on them. Considering how much ammo and my shotgun breaking during the second fight. I congratulate them on taking something so-so and making it outright bad.
---
Either way, 5\* 60% or 3\* 60%. If you change the other gun perks to require less ranks for the damage boost (without changing Demo expert) then both ballistic weapons and explosive weapons would have the same damage increases for the same points. This is what you're saying.
---
What I'm retorting with is, once you do this, you take them back off even footing. After both builds use 3 ranks to hit 60%, explosive weapons users would run out of ammo very quickly compared to ballistic users unless they were always encumbered or spent 2-3 more points on reducing their ammo weight.
---
That is the trade off there. Explosive weapons get more damage for less perk points at the cost of having to expend more on carry capacity.
---
you will have a-lot more fun and "wow" moments with no mans sky.
---
&gt;Not only that but the game has a ton of potential.
---
Had.
---
Exactly I don't think anyone doing code is making decisions, but I could be wrong.
---
The Instagib rifle from Unreal. Most snipers from BF 3/4/1/5. Noob Tubes from BF2. Various kill streak rewards from COD.
---
True
---
Hilarious!
---
And what if I don’t want to “build”. I’ve always played every fallout by grabbing what was good at that moment. That’s why I have stats all over the place and every perk I have is weight reduced or overall utility. TSE without perks did ok for me. Even TS was ok. Now I have to reset myself because my “build” can’t handle anything that isn’t a Gauntlet without getting killed
---
Id recommend console over PC for the bigger base and no hackers/cheaters.
---
&gt;I mean Bobby Pins...that os the one thing ruining your gaming experience?
---
If you think it's just bobby pins and not a more general complaint about the fact that they can't even seem to keep the changes they make in the game then you have no business criticising the critics.
---
Bobby pins are the canary in the mineshaft but if you want to suffocate because it's just a bird, not like it's a person or anything then go ahead.
---
That's a good idea
---
&gt;  they're nerfing everything in an attempt to slow progress and stretch our playtime longer. 
---
What's the point when 80% of your player base already reached boredom point tho...
---
Do you want Bethesda to be bought out by EA? Because this is how you get companies bought out by EA.
---
What the crap are they supposed to do, exactly?
---
Yup. 
---
8k minigun rounds and we took her down with 3 minutes to spare. 
---
Such a joke. I physically can't farm that much ammo for terrible drops. I'm done for a bit. 
---
Oh okay, sorry i did know people were buying for cash, i just thought that the joke was somehow paypal related haha.
---
Thanks for the reply :)
---
Or if they hired those that keep discovering the duping methods, they could get ahead of things.  Got network security problems?  Hire a hacker to test network security. Got cheating problems? Hire cheaters to find ways to cheat. Either the testers aren't capable of what the community can figure out, or management isn't listening to them. I would think management would be trying to minimize the backlash that comes from every misstep.

320hrs only weapon worth mentioning

Only on paper.
---
Just swung by the park to grab the plans, feel free to add me with the same username I have here if you're on PC. It takes 5 pure violet flux, so if you have the materials, I'd be happy to craft it for you. 
---
If not, violet is always easy to get and I wouldnt mind running a nukezone sometime in the evening with you to get the stuff. Just lemme know if you're down.
---
I built a sniper character and a melee character and both times the levelling was fun but once you've launched a nuke or two a total snoozefest. So I tried to do a full auto gun character to see how it plays and... puke... you need so many bullets to do anything it's insane.
---
The Alien Blaster is the weapon that needs the largest buff. Canonically this weapon is the most powerful energy handgun lorewise. But in FO76 it's the weakest energy weapon in the game. With full gunslinger perks it does about 20 damage, less than a Laser pistol. 
---
All Energy weapons need a buff, but the Alien Blaster at level 50 is only useful at killing level 1-6 enemies in the forest.
---
I hope you receive this post and pass it on!
---
It’s cool don’t be sorry hahahah
---
That excel sheet says you have move money to spend that you aren't.
---
Happens every day, you put up a few million to make a billion and insider trading is not a crime when you can buy the court. Google it. 
---
See I used to love idiots who did that because it meant an easy 400-800cap bounty to claim :)
---
I'm amazed that the code isn't even behaving consistently amongst users.
---
Fuck Bethesda and these community managers. "I will be forwarding this to our dev team we were unaware of this issue!" 
---
How the fuck are you unaware that your patch reverted the game back to utter shit. You really need the 16 year olds playing the game to post on reddit to make bugs known? The fuck outta here with this garbage. 
---
Don't bother with this gonkshill. Judging by his post history: "Oh, you think the Bethesda is your ally, you merely adopted the 76. I **was born** in it, molded by it... etc" - u/gonkraider probably.
---
Well look at fallout 4 and skyrim those games are still have issues. It took the modding community to fix their games. So i doubt you guys will ever see a completed product.
---
hehe, that made me laugh.
---
It's because the people who couldn't get a TSE are foaming at the mouth for a nerf, what they don't understand, because they don't use tse's is a plan Jane walk up to a work bench and craft it lever rifle does something like 150, my 3 star TSE lever action rifle now does 234. 9 points for rifleman perks and 5 points for demo expert perk and 3 stars of legendary is only worth an additional 80ish damage. That's not a neef, that's a murder. And I would put money that the foaming mouth breathers wouldn't be near this upset if there wasn't a duping glitch.
---
And blowing up their camps... because for some reason that's fun? 
---
So are many quests. We actually have to go stand in line at the DMV. THE FREAKING DMV??!? Who at Bethesda approved that quest?
---
Doing the rose quests and I noticed that my m79 does 1/2 damage as frag grenade.
---
I’m a stealth sniper as well but wear PA for melee
---
This patch is gonna make me really work for stuff
---
That’s not really what I’d call game breaking. 
---
I’m talking about the atrocious one where you’d get stuck in your power armor. Except you were kind of halfway in. It looked weird and you couldn’t interact with anything or get out of it. You also didn’t get the full benefits of wearing power armor. The only way to get out was to stash your cores and run around until you drained the one in the suit. Then you could get out. However, at least for me, I’d just bug out again the second I put it back on. The community realized the chassis was bugged so scrapping all of your chassises fixed it but that sucks for obvious reasons. I’m getting mad just remembering that bug lol. 
---
Thanks guys and gals, just went by Camden Park to grab them. 5500 caps and some violet flux poorer, but the job's done! If anyone has the materials to make it but needs someone with the plans, feel free to add me on PC with the same username, ill be on tonight .
---
It's sad because a lot of us are invested at this point. I love this world in fallout 76. It's beautiful, lonely, and just asking to be discovered. I get to spend time with friends I haven't seen in years, who live halfway around the world, and antagonize others in only underwear with my friends. This IS a fallout game, in my opinion, and it was a very good one. We're supposed to be able to run into battle and see lasers flying through the air, power armor, explosions, but also some guy in a dress with a Grognak axe. Theres supposed to be a point where you just run around and hilariously destroy everything, it's fun. They're just trying to make up for the lack of end game by slowing progress. They are too focused with making a pvp survival game, and not with making an online fallout experience, like we were promised. I just want Bethesda to not fuck this up.
---
Yeah, they definitely needed a change. I feel two shot should have been left alone though. Explosive should have dropped down to at least 25% and demolition expert should have been changed to a 3 perk card instead of still charging us 5 points for only 60%

Imagine if Obsidian worked on 76... I would pay $100 for that.
---
The entire dev and QA team have managed to push live a completely unintended change (which according to you shouldn't have any impact at all). So when they rush out a fix to it what unknown impact are they going to have on some other random piece of the game 'that it shouldn't have much impact on at all'?
---
Noticed that, welcome back Windows Key, Task View and Task Manager.
---
Yeah you don't get the complaints Bethesda should get the complaints not you so they can fix these issues. And seriously did you try and play yesterday the disconnects and frozen player issues were trifold compared to the previous patch
---
Yeah, normally happens if I exit then re enter the armour though
---
At this stage, also hire the PC modders who are coding better than internal devs, please. 
---
They won't add it. The whole purpose of the current respec is to keep people playing in the hopes they will buy from the atom shop. They could have easily added a full respec ages ago that cost caps.
---
There is a whole fan theory around the Institute and mannequins, 100% worth reading. 
---
The TSE also fires faster than your pool cue.
---
Bethesda has always been lacking in the bug-fixing department.  Since their games have always been singleplayer they kind of got away with it.  Now with online play and PVP they are quickly realizing bug-fixing and balance nerfs/buffs is a fulltime job.  Not a once a month or so (or neverat all) task like fixing bugs for Fallout 4 was.
---
The thing is I liked my TSE Gattling because it meant I didn't really have to bother when clearing out a mob. At level 100 I'm not really playing for the challenge of the game any more. I'm now sandboxing my own thing and I really don't want to be bothered by mobs. I mean in power armour I can just wade into them and one or two hit them with my melee. That may not really be everyone's end game goal but I wasn't really concerned about anything before I got my TSE anyway. I can kill just about everything without really breaking a sweat.
---
I'm still going to TSE till I find a gun I like more.
---
My guess is they all started working on bugs, then they pack a given amount of branches to make a feature release, and they don't merge the new release branch into the other, still-being-worked-upon, branches.
---
If some dev is still working on a branch from day one, we might see a return of the bugs from back then too someday.
---
They are magical.
---
did it, /u/KalinRozthan 
---
Yikes my dudes. On the bright side I didn’t play it and am more then ready to lube my butthole up for outworlds 
---
Awesome!
---
It has a faster swing speed and +1 strength
---
This would be one of those quality of life things that would be lovely to exist, however the likelyhood that Bethasda would add something like this is never going to happen.
---
The modding community could make this reality but Bethasda havent yet revealed, how they are going? to enable modding [custom player server(s)] or the pricing model for them in the first place.....
---
They don't play the game like we do probably, they are coming at it from a different direction.
---
You didn't assert that temporary small stat buffs are not objectionable atom store content? 
---
Depends on how much impact they think the bug has on game play or stability. Rebuilding the patch, distributing the patch, updating the servers, and rebooting takes a bit more than someone clicking a button AFAIK. 
---
If it were all server side, I'd say yes, you can patch server side stuff pretty quickly. Things that deal with both client side and server side things, not so much. And Fallout 76 is balancing server and client side functions a very delicate snowflake already. I'd wouldn't want to rush anything.
---
KilL 10 ProTeCTroNs! Or chickens.... what the fuck
---
Bingo!
---
I don’t have TSE but I enjoyed your story.
---
Thanks for a good read 
---
That was happening before the patch
---
Mods should not be auto-scrapped when crafting, ever, just like your weapons and armor should not be auto-scrapped when crafting. Bulk items should be scrapped when loose junk is used up, unless they are trying to discourage people from bulking items.  Selling bulk junk is a waste of time since there are so few caps on the board. Half of the time I get to a vendor, there is a paper bag full of bulked junk because people don't want to pay to travel all over the map just to make a few hundred caps. I thought the intention of bulking was to reduce the number of items in inventory or stash for the servers to keep track of. 
---
I'm gonna give it a go this weekend. I logged in last night and attempted to shoot some level 35 robots with my TSE guns that would have 1 shot them now took 6-7 rounds (my build was explosive). Bought a bunch of plans for power armors, scrapped my extra X01. Going to see what happens actually playing and trying to do some missions might run the queen, kinda wondering the feasibility of running a nuke silo solo anymore with the nerfing. I got my Sledges I can swap cards to go melee but I hate that play style.
---
100% agree. This is why I stopped playing the game, which is a shame because it really does have so much potential, and is totally a blast to play minus this aspect of it. Chores are what RL is for (unless you’re rich and can pay people to do them for you, then maybe you’ll like this game?). 
---
It's not worth their time to interact with the 200 people complaining about nerfs.  They'll pass along bug information and that's it.  Going toe-to-toe with pitchfork and torchwielding anti-developer movement people serves no purpose.  Standard marketing right now is to hold back until the noisy couple hundred folks get bored and move on to the next witch hunt and the constructive criticism is all that remains.
---
Bethesda released an update that didn’t fix anything but actually rolled back and reversed all the changes they made with the last patch 
---
I agree whole heartedly. Weapons seem really really weak after level 5. Im 71 with all level 50 weapons and thr only things thats useful for more then 1 enemy at a time is plasma and pulse mines\grenades and a sse or tse. 
---
Mini nukes damage need a drastic improvment. Missle launchers do next to nothing. 
---
The ammo consumption out side of sse or tse is rediculous. Either mobs need a drastic reduction in armor and hp or guns need a huge buff. 
---
Theres is no reason you should have level 50 items aka near end \ end game weapons and have a hard time with small groups of non boss or legendarys.
---
*That One Dev That Needs Things Explained 700 Times: Wait, so we're implementing bulking the mods, right?*
---
Weird weight glitches. 
---
If I die, or server hop, my weight I can carry AND what I currently have on me, fluctuates. 
---
I have no idea wtf is going on. 
---
What platform you on? I totally understand your point btw  but if you let a couple of pricks completely dominate your view of a community then you end up shutting yourself off to a wealth of possibility. There will be things you will never experience because the behaviour of one scummy piece of sheeeit has soured you to trusting people. Im not saying to run around the wasteland naively trysting everyone, for example i dont even accept trade requests from people i dont know. Also do not forget you have the ability to block the toxic fuckers, even if they are on your friends list. Unfriend the knob gobbler and block them. But most importantly, if you take anything from my ramblings take this, keep your chin up and move forward. Be a shark not a lamb. To survive a shark must keep moving forward, unless they find an appropriate cross flow of water which allows them to be still and sleep. But you get my meaning i hope. If you are on ps add me mjesticbattlecat
---
Damage control, make as much money as possible then close the servers.
---
I'll take the one that looks like a hammer
---
Melee has its own drawbacks compared to anything ranged. Managing that low health shit is a whole other beast. I played around with it a little bit but didn’t care for it personally. A decent amount of work goes into getting the right spec, gear, and mutations. As far as being OP goes it doesn’t even compare to the much easier setup of TSE’s in my opinion. As of now I’m rocking an unremarkable sniper rifle and doing just fine. 
---
Since the patch, I've gotten more caps from the trash cans in The Whitespring than in stashes. 
---
I was almost done with that damn quest and my game crashed. I had to redo almost the entire thing! So boring and tedious. 
---
The problem here is that tse are OP even without a build
---
They are getting harder to get by the minute. Check what they did to cap stashes with the recent update. And I have a reasonable number of friends. None of them is gullible, too.
---
I’m 1 shotting most mobs on my alt as unarmed melee build...but okay whatever you say. 
---
I bought mod yesterday for few hundred caps from Watoga Station vendor.
---
I can confirm the issue with the KNOWN status with multiple characters.
---
I have two characters with one having learned the handmade gun plan prior to the patch.
---
Post-patch, the other character had it marked as known at the vendor, so I travelled to a weapon crafting station and confirmed that that character did not get the option to craft a short handmade. 
---
I could still buy and learn it on the second character so it's a display issue.
---
Without knowing how the game or engine works at the ground level, it's easy to say that I could do better than their devs.
---
However, their business plan of releasing games fast and with bugs clearly is not working. The game got humiliated by reviews, and Bethesda lost many loyal fans. This being said, the publishers are incompetent or amateurs if any.
---
MARCh?  This game won’t make it to that point.  By then it’ll have been abandoned by most and only the players late to the game will be playing to try and level up to something in the 70’s to be a worthwhile adversary with even more subdued guns and perks.  
---
“Damn I wish I could play like that level 120 I saw”.... getting that high at this point if you’re just starting now is a pipe dream.
---
So glad they fixed the bobby pin weight, that shit was so light it made the burglar build OP.
---
Can you guys pull out metrics on time spent with weapons equipped?
---
If so I'd literally just look down the least used weapons and apply buffs appropriately.
---
Some of the beta testers should just be playing the game, just like we are. Otherwise, they are not actually testing the game.
---
Ok mine had stopped and has just restarted again  after this patch. everytime I fast travel or new load screen it drops of pieces and have to reapply them.
---
Good valid points!
---
Also want to mention that Bethesda is still very conscious of public image. Much better to say "Server Impact" that it is to say "Prevent Dupers from exploiting the crap out of the game".  I know it would have been worded better, but you get the drift, they want to move away from negativity.
---
I got mine about a month ago from Welch Station
---
&gt;How hard would it be to implement a way for it to ignore legendary prefixes
---
I doubt the current team is able to make major changes. They can fiddle with the values in the existing mechanics and that's about it. So, a perceived problem with over-powered two-shot explosive shotguns can only be "fixed" by nerfing all of the two-shot and explosive weapons to the point of uselessness.
---
heh "Unreasonable"
---
Melee... White Knight :(
---
Melee needs to be nerfed....game now needs balancing....
---
Or you know, you could learn from the fact that games usually require patching for the first few months after release and it's economically sensible to just wait them out (or till the game is at 80% sale, which is how I got my copy of  Fallout 76 for £10).
---
Agreed 100%. People are complaining way too much about the nerf, the TS legendary modifier is still SLIGHTLY better than  AA, Instigating and Bloodied effects. People are just salty they can’t 1 shot almost everything anymore. Best patch ever imo
---
You're just a duping grifer who wants to keep his OP TSE weapons and 1 shot the ENTIRE game. Lol jokes aside, this nerf wasn't a nerf it was pretty much a murder on all builds except melee. 
---
Because it makes my inventory easier to look at and manage.
---
just a disconnection from the server
---
You got me lol 😂
---
The bos fob just SE of watoga train station will have a rndom pa plan next to the pa station. I got the plan there 👍
---
Yes same thing for me or any new load screen. 
---
  Mine had stopped but now after patch started again. 
---
The current issues are because they pushed a patch based on an older version.
---
Adjusting the weight of Bobby pins was not what broke the patch. Adjusting it back would be minor.
---
Would you prefer it to take a month or so of  server hopping or a week of playing the game and emptying vendors out.
---
1.PC
---
4. **Unable to join a server after patch #5, it just keeps crashing.  On the bottom right of the screen when the World Found count down hits 1 game just crashes.**  
---
As a shotgun build it's even more frustrating. I could have been making ammo instead of bulking to save space
---
Mods aren't drops only. The watago vendor sells all PA mods.
---
Ayep!  Go ahead and allow question marks in a search field that gets added onto a querystring, see what happens.
---
Why would anyone put a question mark as part of their first name anyway.
---
Some builds might work, sure. Mostly stealth, since you are still capable of one shotting everything. What about none-stealth builds tho? 
---
What a disappointment to be honest.This game could've had so much potential, but every single patch leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like the changes in the time frame are sad. At least compared to what I am used to with nearly every other online game.
---
It is why Day-Z hype died.
---
In that case, can someone plz stretch the PA HUD to properly fit the 21:9 screens. Right now it just sits in the middle 2/3rd of the screen.
---
Just stretch it and Ill make do plz. 
---
i don't mind some "chores", but just being overwhelmed by it gets really frustrating really quick
---
TSE over nerfed. The demo card nerf was uncalled for, made the old explo weapons like fatmans and missile launchers even more useless, nice work because they were already useless before patch, it feels like that have no idea how to balance things and make a even playing field no matter how you want to play.
---
TSE got nerfed to shit, now I hit harder with a melee without ANY melee perks than with some heavy gun that I even have perks equipped. It's ridiculous. One patch and they turned the game into a melee slasher.
---
Players noting weight issues on all platforms, max carry weight changing and not registering correctly. Phantom Weight.
---
Pins back to 0.1
---
TSE Lazer and plasma gatlins still break under one mag from 200% repair. Same with agl, ts missile launcher and others.
---
The moderators of this community are as good as bethesda leadership, the discord server is even worst.  
---
Even this need to be fixed for little jesus sake.  
---
I didn’t get a response for a month about the canvas bag replacement, I made a post about it to Bethesda support on Twitter and it was resolved within a week. 
---
I had to do it 4 times. One crash, one freeze, one time the game decided the letter had no address.
---
I paid 60$ because me a dumb dumb watched the 2 reviews on YT that where positive and only saw the hate train after i bought it. That said no i will not just go away and stop complaining if a they release a Game like this. Since this Uptate i carry arround 6 lbs of Bobbypins AGAIN, 80% of my Enemies are T posing, the AI is constantly shooting at walls and can't pathfind, 
---
Its fine if you enjoy the game and have fun with it
---
but that doesnt mean the complaints of others are invalid and need to stop. Why do you even read these negative posts if your having fun why mind them?
---
Sorry , we'll fix your 300 year old pistol right after we fixed the emblematic-top-of-the-art weapons of the game if that's okay for you.
---
Patches that introduce old issues are bad, but you indicated other stuff like White Knight nerfs.  So it isn't just patch issues with your friends leaving then.  Maybe its salt to the wounds - but if you look at it, the changes to White Knight just brings it in line with the power armor version.
---
Too many are complaining about it without explaining the true reason what needs fixing.  Non PA armor could use some durability improvements, which the devs might not fully realize.  Pretty sure the energy weapons breaking too quickly has gotten to them and will get fixed at some point though.
---
No amount of talking, agreed. You can do more than talk, tho. U can actively not support such methods. I plan on doing just that, like many others. Look what happened to Creation Club. And that's single player.
---
Ditto. I haven't played since the first patch in December or so. Keep checking back to see if a new patch brings new life, but every time it appears to be 2 steps forward 1 step back. Hell maybe 1 step forward and 2 steps back. Pretty much no reason to boot up the game again until it looks fun. The patch notes always make it seem like they're nerfing enjoyable things rather than boosting underperforming things to be fun. No thanks.
---
So happy to see a post like this not just 'cos it's a cool idea but I'm really getting sick of seeing post after post of just moaning about this recent patch.
---
At the moment, I'm starting to want to play the other fallout games again (I'll fix the bugs with mods and add way more content than they ever could from modders amazing creations). It's not that I don't like the game, But its bugs (that atm modders can't do anything about and beth are terrible with fixing bugs) and the fact I have pretty much nothing left to do annoys me too much to continue playing. I can't be bothered to boot a game up just to go get plans and mats for basically nothing, It's not like I can go raiding in a nice instance with decent loot to get that might take an hour or more with a group of friends or randoms. I hear things like that are coming but it's not soon enough.
---
 Imo it's starting(started) to look like The Division when that first came out. I don't know if that game got any better, but I never went back. All the exploits and overpowered pvp in the darkzone with basically no end game content and nothing to do once the quest line was done pretty much ended it for me and FO76 is sadly going the same way. It may get better in the future but once I uninstall it and eventually I will, It won't be reinstalled for a while if ever.
---
Bethesda you need to pick up the pace, fix the bugs get us more content. Not whatever it is your'e doing now, because from the looks of things it's not going well, Not well at all.
---
They have proven they cannot make changes in isolation or as intended so I'm not sure why you are so certain that 'adjusting the weigh of bobby pins would be minor'. Also on top of that your code gets even more janky, when you rebase (or similar) your 'new patch' onto the one it was supposed to be built on guess what, you've now got three common ancestors for your bobby pins instead of two.
---
I'm not really talking about the devs, unless the devs are responsible for ignoring feedback from their testers.  I'm complaining that testers do not seem to notice problems that people in this community notice immediately. Yes, I think that I can do better that what they are seeing, because I excel at finding out how thing work, and how to make things crash, hence my nickname of 30 years, Crash.
---
Soulgator def crunched the numbers on how everything got murdered, i'm ready to see the receipts.
---
I’m over twice that of the max level where they supposedly stopped making it available at a vendor.  But at over 1800 caps, it’s not cheap.
---
I mean can we joke that a new patio plan seems to be up there in price as a gun?  I’d take a guess Bethesda was going to introduce some sort of in game purchase for caps and set the prices a while back.  Then they saw what EA went thru and removed it last minute only to now have absurd prices for DECORATIONS that no one in their right mind would pay for.
---
Oh and while I’m at it - 11k for fucking signs?  The in game economics is a joke.
---
Same here. I enjoy Bethesda Studio games, but I will not pre-order their next game, nor buy it upon release. I will wait and see. Enough customers do that, and...
---
even before the patch I had to reapply my X-01 torso from time to time, another of thousands bugs and glitches of this beta-release...
---
i don`t get it either .. i also think i`m playing a different game.
---
I´m happy that i`m not one of the "reach max rank as quickly as possible and just farm stuff the whole day" kinda player. I just take my time and really have nothing to complain about - except one thing ... please spawn more legendary enemies in quests/missions/events ... not everyone likes to farm Whitesprings or Nuke zones the whole day. 
---
Sometimes i think this subredit is even worse than the r/destinythegame
---
They have beta testers? I thought it was just us lmao 
---
This is a huge pet peeve of mine lol. I am a crit-sniper build, but I am at the point where I don't even use VATS in nuke zones anymore.
---
ESO is buy to play, just like Fallout 76.
---
Just for selling to vendors really. Lead definitely has it's weight reduced through bulking though... so does something else, I think it's aluminium. 
---
Explosive are bad not cause of their perks, your reasoning is that every build in the should use same amount of points for weapons ALL perks included? Cause explosive ones have the least amount of points to use. 
---
I'd also really like to know what their user stories and aesthetic goals are, at least what the dev side of things has as focus areas, marketing has pretty clear goals.
---
Seems like PvP was the main issue. Although it felt like in some instances like 2SE PvE was overpowered too. 
---
Honestly it's just a little too late for this game to become even close it what it should of been. The game is so broken beyond the normal scope of development repair. Casual updates aren't enough to fix this game like how some people blinded by how bethesda or game/ software development works. This game requires YEARS more of dedicated work, especially since it's their first multiplayer game on their old single-player engine. But now it just has a small team trying to pick up some pieces to safe face. It's a shame.
---
Lol of course it was -_-,keep seeing other people having random cards proc they don’t have or use either 
---
Oh but fixing actual issues has been transfered to the player/modding community in last what 10 years or so and now they are just trying to find usable ways to monetize the process by limiting the access of using the fixes....
---
People are claiming this because of the bobby pins being switched back. There is no proof they rolled it back to a former version yet you’re all just parroting it all over the place lmao. 
---
I don’t mind the patch that much but I do care about the Aaron shop items sneakily adding health buffs if you wear them
---
Farming specific locations is as grindy as vendor running.
---
I have hardly bought anything from vendors and I've only got like 3500 caps. I used to have over 6k but I gave them to a friend who wanted a TSE and I had no use for caps. Wanting me to spend what equates to a week of vendor running on one mod? Yeah I've got better things to do like literally nothing than wasting time on such a low return. I play games as escapism to unwind from having a job, why would I want to work hard in the game to generate income? 
---
Perhaps but loading screens are insane 
---
Lol my stimpacks act like a chem and I get notifications just like when alcohol where's off .
---
  But they are working correctly other than the notification effects of stimpack have worn off. 
---
Uh huh. And which “return bugs” have specifically come back and impacted you?
---
Don't do it. If you still desperately want to buy it wait for reviews and buy it 2-3 months after release. 
---
I've personally lost all trust in this company and their framework. Seeing how badly it performs I am very skeptical that they can make a functional and bug free space battle game out of it. So I will wait and see, no longer will I be a beta tester for their games
---
Jesus Christ how much damage are you doing per shot if a scotch beast takes 20 shots to kill
---
Good post.
---
Yeah I had been enjoying it a lot. Got all my ships and most my fleet set up. 
---
That’s the only way fighting a Scorchbeast won’t give me a seizure
---
I do agree they over nerfed TSE, but even as someone who doesn't really care about TSE I am frustrated with the demolition expert nerf.
---
Thank you for your reply. I’ve been finding swapping cards for terminals and locks tedious as well, but unfortunately I’m not that ‘rich’ yet :).
---
I thought about blocking all PvP non-Pacifist players (which gets you any bounty if you make a mistake) but stopped short of that.  The base levelers will get a high bounty unless they surgically remove piece by piece and have a friend clear the bounty.  Although I start suspecting anyone with a bounty past 10 caps.
---
If we make the enemies weaker there will be no challange (JMO). 
---
All the TSE issues and OP complaints stem from PVP fights and legendary farming locations if someone TSEs a room you can't tag legendary enemies and get loot. There wouldn't be an issue if this was a solo game I never heard a single complaint about being OP or duping in Fallout 4 because everyone was OP (and loved it) and duping didn't ruin everyone elses game because the only person you affected was yourself. They also took an outdated solo game engine and tried to make it MMO which gave us many flaws. It may be in everyones best interest to eventually when all the bugs are worked out do a server reset.(yes I'm one of the supporters of this idea) as much as I'd hate to lose my progress I'd also enjoy doing it over again.
---
So let me get this straight: You're complaining about items degrading too fast and them nerfing perks that are too good? Well that's how things work with survival features things break the more you use them and in fallout case it was like this for some weapons in 3 and New Vegas. 
---
As far as enemies being bullet sponges well this is a tricky thing cause some people like that feature and changing this would either make the player less powerful or enemies less powerful and this wouldn't be fun either. My guess is that the enemies wouldn't be a big issue if you're in a team of 3-4 people shooting at the enemies.
---
I don't think this patch is a huge reason to call for change in leadership, there's got to be other reasons than just adjusting repair perks efficiency. 
---
I actually don't see a problem with bobby pins having weight, it just depends on how heavy they are. And anyone who knows anything about patches is all it takes is one tiny mistake to screw up 20 other things. 
---
not act like corporate robots and actually give helpful answers would be a great start.
---
Bethesda also called the duped garbage clogging the camp budget an "exploit."
---
Yeah, those 47 Industrial Water Purifiers made me King of the Wasteland.
---
&gt; how often it blue screens on my PS4
---
Are you using the Targeting HUB mod, by any chance? If yes, removing that will fix those crashes. And you're crashing others' games as well as long as it's installed, because the effect is daisychaining, so please do us a favor! 
---
I’m patch notes you can get ultracite plans from fort defiance. All mods for ultracite from scorch beast queen. You also can’t buy x01 mod plans from any vendor I’ve seen
---
Gauss rifle, gatling plasma and gatling laser. 
---
That you couldn’t hook up mind you. But more because you could scrap them and get free resources
---
Can you do one post without some sort of condescending reply please? What sort of change to the caps stash? All I see is that they made them into a container for proper instanced loot. 
---
I don't blame you.
---
Well if it's a mistake i don't see how a change in leadership is going to change things for the better. 
---
Go to Taggerdy's terminal at Defiance. It's got all the plans free
---
PA melee then? I don't use melee, I hate this kind of games when dude with lead pipe does more damage than .50 cal machine gun, so I'm more than angry that they force leave me no choice...
---
So glad if you leave excavator PA on you ALWAYS have 405 carry limit now (great job you made a part time big into a feature Bethesda!). So there’s that but once they set it to 305, I won’t have the room to keep all the junk I use more so to craft noobs armor and weapons for.  
---
I’ve already done all the other main quests and the 1-2 side quests that are left are a joke.  One is the Overseers one - of which I fully don’t know which I’m missing.  Second is that fucking clown outfit one which out of principle I won’t do because I shouldn’t have to buy an outfit to complete something.
---
You know what I meant &gt;.&gt;.
---
But just for funz 1,000,000 per shot. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I am glad this is a thing. With Subnuatica2 starting early access today I intend to spread this term if at all possible.
---
They are found in Tagerty’s terminal in the BOS Bunker’s 3rd floor.
---
They fixed that bug for mods, but the fix doesn't allow bulked items to be used for crafting until you scrap them down.
---
Okay just because you shout the loudest on Reddit doesn't necessarily mean you're right.
---
In fact if I were the CM I'd consider that it's likely that angry feedback is bad feedback. Different members of the community want different things
---
I play on xb1 so nms wasn't available to me till 2018. I'm all too familiar with how bad nms was on launch because I heard friends talk about it and watched my fave streamers all have their hopes dashed from it. I'm just hoping Bethesda can pull off what Hello Games did 
---
good to know.  thanks for the help.
---
Go to fort defiance, 4th floor, in paladin taggerdys office, go onto the terminal and select ultracite plans it should automatically learn from there an you can then build the PA.
---
I'm not to sure about the mods.
---
btw, they did a GDC talk on that  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urijgWXLYck&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urijgWXLYck&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
&gt;  So you're telling me that my 9 points for the rifleman perks,
---
Considering it only increases base damage 20% each.  A base weapon of 100 damage would only increase would be 20 damage.  so all 3 would be 60 damage increase max.
---
Demo expert at 5 points increase base damage 60%. With above damage of 160 the base explosive damage is 32. So a 60% increase would be 51 damage.
---
Combined they would be 211 damage assuming the base weapon without perks or mods is 100 damage. 
---
So yea sounds fairly close when you know how the system works. 
---
Compared to original were you were doing  160 damage (base and perks) + 100 two shot bonus plus 200 explosive damage.  OP as shit and makes it so no other guns can compete with it even vaugly. 
---
The original system had a 360% damage increase over base weapon. While not it is a 111% increase over base weapon. 
---
There was a dude in /v/ saying exactly this. It was a dev in Bethesda.
---
At least that's what he said. It makes sense.
---
This issue occurs if you load into the world with a character, then leave the world and go back in with another character. The game seems to read which plans you know upon that first character login, and remembers it for the rest of the time the game client is open. It won't try to check again if you change characters. If you close the game client, start it again, and log straight into your alt character first, it will work properly. 
---
Basically, if you want it to correctly show known plans, you have to close the game client, open the game back up, and log straight into the character you want it shown correctly for. 
---
i didn`t have a single freeze, crash or stutter since yesterdays patch (XB1X) ... the game runs better than ever. 
---
Actually the Garb of Mystery and Eye of Ra are in game items (quest rewards) that synergise to create meaningful stats, especially if then using power armor. But their is no male variant of the costume.
---
It’s kinda like complaining that getting an Endgame Fibber in Borderlands Is broken because it can one shot bosses, understandably that game wasn’t balanced for PvP but you did have to grind for it a lot of the time. If duping didn’t exist then people wouldn’t have an issue because you’d actually have to put work in. Maybe if there were set quest rewards to work for then that would be better for getting legendaries, as you would farm certain quests for guaranteed loot.
---
TL;DR 
---
Do what borderlands did and have specific enemies or quests reward specific weapons.
---
This game is going to make every mistake countless other MMOs have made and at the same time destroyed their own community.
---
I tried to tell you 20 days ago this was going to be a problem.
---

---
My Low Life Crit Based Explosive Sniper was hit with several nerfs yesterday. I am glad I made a new character for that build because all of my invested time is now wasted.
---
You nerfed explosive perk, his bloodied explosive pipe rifle, pipe weapon perk, stealth interactions. 
---
The core reason I built my character was decimated and you offered no recourse for my time invested.
---
You realize you can unbulk it right...?
---
i don`t get your complaints .. game is better than ever!
---
Has nowhere near the firerate of a hamdmade or .50cal... but lets be honest we all know next patch will nerf melee and not address any of the other issues plaguing the game.
---
Did you read what they wrote? Constructive complaints are fine but dozens of people posting the same sentence about quitting is clogging up the sub. If you want to say you're quitting either (a) write a detailed, original post, or (b) comment on another post. 
---
junk pile camp basically all the screws springs gears a normal player needs 
---
No it doesn’t. It only really reduces the weight of aluminum and lead lol. 
---
I am 80+ hours into the game, level 31  and can really relate to this.  more and more i get the feeling that i can't do quests or advance in the game / level up because of the chores. i have too much collecting to do, too much repairing damaged weapons etc.   i never had that feeling with fallout 4  (120+ 75 hours in fallout 4)
---
It's clear they intended this games core to be a collect-a-thon. Survival games are like that. Boring as hell. 
---
I’ve never felt melee was OP,has the same balances and LOW buffs from each perk card. Melee is just good because you can modify builds in a bunch of different ways than with guns cause well there’s just too many guns. Melee it’s simple. One hand two hand or all hands.
---
People who don’t play melee are the only ones who think it’s op. I can  kill trash mobs in 1 hit. But when someone is 1-2 shooting a scorch beast with guns...yeah melee users aren’t doing that.
---
I'm pretty sure that the sonic blast is glitched just like Assaultrons spamming their beam over and over again while they are technically charging it
---
It takes a lot for me to put down a game, but this patch did it for me and my buddies. I love the game, I really hope they unfuck this.
---
Would still be nice for a buff to good old fashioned firearms though because shit takes time
---
than why even come here to this subredit .. 
---
i don`t want to live on this planet anymore.
---
get a junk pile in your camp enough screws springs gears and other goods to keep your items repaired also the reduced repair cost perks / 200% repair perks 
---
Cant get u all
---
You touched on an interesting idea. The fact that someone would spend money here to show how strong their support for the idea is should be eye opening. What Bethesda will realize soon is that it doesnt matter what the drooling, loud masses scream for on reddit, its their whales that will keep them employed. I wonder how many players that paid for items in the atom shop left the game because of this patch. I did. The best protest in situations like this is to not log in and spend your money somewhere else. Maybe this will help inspire better decisions. 
---
I’d imagine this very small inconvenience is the solution that they have for now to prevent mods from being scrapped. Hopefully it’s a temporary solution. Either way I’d take this over accidentally scrapping mods any day. 
---
Sorry didn't explain myself very well. I have those but am after the plans to make mods. Can get almost every type of PA mod plans at vendors but haven't seen them for the ultracite armour. Is it a case of farming the SBQ for mod drops still?
---
I realize that now. I sure had enough lead to make a big difference though. And it’s nice to have something to do with all that plastic.
---
Man I'm glad your experience has been good it's a hot mess on PS4 I've been having a hard time with crashing/freezing issues. 
---
Whitesprings ghouls used to give massive xp.  Higher than most bosses or crowned mobs.   I think I remember 600-700+ xp each.  Was pretty crazy.  I think I gained a level each time went through a single round of them.
---
Plus you had XP Exploits with the arc traps.  You could disable one over and over and over... 
---
Those two methods have been patched.
---
They don't fucking know any better answers, dude.  You're basically yelling at the cashier at McDonalds to get you some Szechuan Sauce.  They have no power or magic info, they're basically some people who were given the email addresses for the dev team, and told to try to keep us in the loop.
---
Amen to that!
---
I'm the same playing post patch was more challenging and took more thought and strategy which was more fun than just jump then shoot into the middle of a mob and kill them all. The health buff isn't too bad if they don't do it often because I have over 4000 atoms that I haven't had to pay for so I don't think it's too bad. But if they do this too often to be able to get them for free that would be crossing the line for me, that would be pay to win and I know people won't agree that it's not too bad so I'd say the best thing they should do is give us bonuses for day/night again and to increase sales of atoms give us mannequins to put these outfits on then collectiors would probably buy them.
---
As a devops engineer, i can say with a good CI system, automatic quality gates and manually cherrypicking in the stable release branch, a branch mixup should never happen. 
---
Yea don't forget Bethesda Austin also developed doom and are developing doom eternal 
---
Vampire’s Swing Speed +1 Strength Powerfist
---
I don’t feel like using (85) 5.56 (a full DRUM on a handmade) to kill one glowing ghoul is exactly a fair or fun challenge either. Don’t tell me to rework my perks. I’m sick of people telling me how to play the game
---
Not until they fix the list of bugs they introduced today. I’m an avid player, but the bugs are just silly now, I cant even list them all anymore
---
I also don't have any mods
---
Sometimes I wish I could see how these responses would play out in a business setting. Telling a paying customer who just had their live system bricked by a regression update that you'd be back once they stopped crying about it.
---
Given that they could have done better by literally doing nothing I would wager that yes, quite a lot of people could have done it better.
---
Bonus to this is you get level 50 quest rewards for the legendary items!
---
X-01 mods are available in the enclave bunker but not the plans like you say. But can't find ultracite mods or mod plans anywhere
---
&gt;Honestly, am I NOT supposed to be buying anything?
---
The better question is what are you buying that you need to buy?  Ammo?  DOn't, its a rip off, make your own.  Materials?  Same thing, learn where the items spawn and go get them.  Stimpaks?  You should find enough out in the world (or farm Mayor Watoga's office)  Or random plans you'll never use?  
---
they actually told us that survival wasn't the only part of that patch its HALF the patch the other half is pve content that people skipped over to talk about pvp there is several official posts pointing this out 
---
What the fuck are you paying me for, again?
---
You could have moved the camp 3 feet, paid like 13 caps, and it would have been rebuilt.
---
You also have no way of knowing if the weapon was two shot or not.
---
Additionally, with the bobblehead stacking being removed, it's unlikely that you were able to be one shot through slap damage.
---
Trees are not so good with motion you know.
---
I've just started out. Level 4. Played FO4 for 1000+ hours but this game is super new to me and I'm still getting the hang of it. I'd be down to join a group. (I'm 28 btw? If that matters at all)
---
You do realize that they’re on a schedule right? Like someone isn’t sitting around pushing a button to release things lol. 
---
Bet there is a mod on PC😂🤣😂🤣
---
I have 80 atoms. I buy C.A.M.P. Items. Now if this was Survival mode and a team all wearing this each had an extra third to their healthbar because they bought a unique outfit each and absolutely decimated you, there would be an insane outrage 
---
Plz for the ever fucking love of god fix Gatling Laser durability.
---
Thank you. There's about on your plate and we only feel that certain things are being forgotten. 
---
That is what all the trailers led me to believe...
---
https://youtu.be/5IcqE8kT3KA
---
most receivers are semi auto
---
Lol, I did that. I have a few items I can craft like vault mechanic jumpsuit and I just destroy them because I can always craft them later. I saw I could craft the garb and assumed the same thing and destroyed it. Oh well.
---
Explosives builds got hit hard, but I dont see any problems otherwise. From level 50 through my current level, I can crush enemies with non-legendary (normal) rifles, shotguns, automatics, and some of the heavy weapons.
---
They do have issues ... Pistols kinda suck if you dont have a crit build; energy weapons are weak; explosive builds kinda stink, and the heavy weapons with explosive damage are bad now. So they do need to boost those. But even with the TSE changes, rifle and shotgun builds still rock.
---
I had something like this too but not with power armor, I had 5 fusion and 2 chassis in stash. After the patch those doubled and for some reason I had 10 cores and 4 chassis
---
You seem to think that telling people who have paid for a service that they should stop complaining that the service got busted up by, frankly, amateur-hour development practices.
---
I'm tired as hell of you saying "the dev team has been made aware" over and over again.
---
They clearly know little to nothing about how it is to actually _play_ this dumpster fire of a game.
---
Aware, my ass.
---
Why am I seeing this on the front page? Im surprised enough people even give a shit about this to make it to make it this far. You guys need to do stuff outside. 
---
Is that how big the bonus is?
---
I played most of today and had an absolute blast. If I was a sociologist I'd say it's mostly signalling, and attempts to get upvoted for an ego with something memetically sticky to fellow toxic people.
---
I just feel awful for the Devs, and the community managers. It's so incredibly dispiriting to have people talking like this as though they're not dealing with human beings. 76 didn't do well financially so there's less money to pay Devs to produce content. Who knew? 
---
Patience and hope. PvP in the next month, the vaults within the next 2-3. I'm still not finished finding locations so I've got no reason to complain
---
I knkw exacly what your saying but you nust dont ever expect a AAA title to be release so bad. You know what i mean
---
My Dragon broke in a fight... it's in my stashbox btw...
---
After two full rounds of Whitespring (maybe, 30min tops?) my gun needs repairs. This is with Gunsmith 5 and a 200% repair. 
---
It’s like they don’t even consider these things. 
---
"Nerfing TSE? Great! Good! To borrow the catchphrase of a sociopathic, dementia-ridden con-man: Make Appalachia Challenging Again."
---
When I think challenge, I don't think it comes from enemies that are highly resistant to ranger builds and risking my weapon breaking off a handful of mobs... Remember, they only nerfed ranged and not melee, which still just rolls over everything.
---
Bravo !
---
Dude your chest and arms are sunburned.
---
It shouldn’t, but it does.
---
60hp each of four have it. 15 per. That’s dependent on your endurance though. Most run around 2-250 so it could be close. Maybe a quarter
---
Yeah, I’m not upset about the nerfs, they come and go, but why did my food run out in minutes (disease free), and my mutations are all screwy, my armor seems to fall apart like a wet cake now aswell. Quite the laundry list honestly, still, I’ma keep playing lol. So long as I can keep punching robots I’m happy
---
Im not sure wheather your joking or being serious 😂😂 yeh its amazing best game ever released
---
Nice work thx
---
Lol if not just give it time. 
---
Your 100% correct I forgot to mention that is even with a full 200% repair. Thanks for the addition 
---
I wasn’t going to agree but the only opportunity  i had to play yesterday, I noticed my session had around 10-13 players. I’m on pc. I usually see more people paying after an update. 
---
Why complain on this sub though? There's like three community managers who read it?  Send them a nasty email, and move on with your life! 
---
Filling this sub with your ranting and whining just annoys other players
---
I'd never suggest that. Your build is your business and it's a dick move to tell someone they're playing wrong. (This is where I get to sound like a hypocrite sorry) I do have one question/ suggestion are you using glow sight? It does help a lot with glowing ones I found them difficult before I took that perk.
---
I wish I could say this game was fun while it lasted, but it was always just *ok*. I've been holding out for more and better this whole time, but they just keep giving *less* and *worse*. The game in it's current state isn't fun. 
---
I'm uninstalling.
---
I feel ya. I started playing on my second character going for a max charisma build but with teams bugged, (unable to join 70 percent of the time) makes me uninterested. 
---
That would be a first everything good is in spite of u.
---
So the point of a PERK is to offer no perk at all? That was how all of the Perks were crafted. Level 1 gives a reduction, level 2 gives a serious reduction level 3 makes it negligible.
---
How, exactly, does making people spend more time finding a specific item improve game play? Grinding, especially when that itself can damage said item, it not fun. It is a chore. This isn't like the white fence Tom persuaded others to pay to be allowed to paint. Chores are chores. Fun is fun. Fun is increased by spending PERK points to reduce the chore. 
---
Nah. I've tendered my resignation.
---
It`s one of my favorite games of all time ... go play something else if you don`t like it. 
---
For defiance taggerdys terminal. The quest that would reward you with the full set of Ultracite power armor now also gives you the plans to craft it 
---
Why do people leave feedback on this sub? There's only like three CMs who read it. Send Bethesda a supportive e-mail and get back to the game!
---
Lots o Drama here in the last 24 hours.
---
I've been playing these types of games since the original Everquest,  so I'm pretty used to gameplay adjustments and new bugs getting introduced.  In time the new bugs get fixed and you adapt to the changes.  It's not the end of the world, believe it or not.
---
Funny thing is, most of the kids making over dramatic posts about quitting the game will continue coming to this subreddit regularly and keep playing.
---
&gt;And anyone who knows anything about patches is all it takes is one tiny mistake to screw up 20 other things.
---
Which is why software is tested before its released. Except in Game Development, where testing is done by the players. Until they lose all patience and move on.
---
Why would there have to be a perk set for a specific enemy?! Why Bethesda?
---
Nice... calculation time because base damage resistance is a bigger factor than I expected because of that also need to find the order of application too. Thanks for this!
---
You've got to be shitting me...
---
i have to un bulk my bulk to use it.
---
The bulk crafting bug is pretty fucked up
---
Pssst .. you can`t say something like that in this subredit .. too much logic
---
I've noticed that this occurs when there is a legendary piece of armor, unequipped, in you inventory. Replicated this across multiple types of PA, not just excavator. 
---
This does not happen all the time. I'm not sure if it's a server issue, container problem, or both. 
---
I assume the databases that maintain the interaction between the container the PA is and the armor the player has on prior is bugging it. In order to keep players from getting the buffs from armor while in PA, something has to deactivate that part. Hopefully the developers see this
---
That's what the fan base is for. Someone with the drive, organizational skills, and time will or already has put this together. Some people just don't like to share. 
---
With my hunting rifle that does about 130 damage with full rifleman perks I need 4-5 shots to kill a single super mutant. With my Ultracite laser rifle that does 57 damage I need about 15 shots. 
---
With my Super sledgehammer I need two hits. And the hammer doesn't use valuable ammo. Enemies are either too strong, or weapons are too weak.
---
And some like the Alien blaster are useless.
---
Seems to be a lifelong bug
---
I take that bit back then I didn't realise it was that much of a buff. 
---
*clears throat* Obsidian
---
Thanks for the background and what you could find - does make sense why they're slanting towards PvP rather than creating new content.  If they had help from other studios building the game world, what's left to support the game has little hope in adding meaningful new content.  Even the PvP survival mode is nothing more than the adventure world with some different engagement rules.
---
Problem is, Bethesda has been this way since Oblivion. Their games are known for being buggy for years after release. This was totally expected.
---
Events grant like 200 xp upon completion and some just require a single monster to die.  Sure its not the insane broke rate of 600+ xp for each whitespring ghoul (pre patch a while back), but it works.
---
I leveled up my character to 50 by not planning a build, just picking up whatever I wanted.  So now I am level 125 and still moving perks/points to adjust toward a build I planned.   &lt;shrug&gt; I still enjoy playing.
---
Wait for an awesome sale! Dont buy now, im a huge fallout fan, pre-ordered fo76, played it and had tons of fun and at this point im so disappointed about it i just decided im going to take a break from it until they fix most of the bugs and finish balancing out the game. 
---
I feel like investing time in this game at this point is just a waste a time.
---
Dont get me wrong, i like the game and i can't wait for it to be more polished, its very very fun, but right now im just bummed.
---
So, my advice is get the game if you get an awesome deal for it, otherwise, just wait a bit.
---
No, not worth it unless you enjoy disconnection/force quits, massive amount of bugs and glitches, broken economy and plan to play melee only. I played 300h+ and the game is almost as broken as at the beginning. Maybe even more...
---
When it was supported, Mass Effect Andromeda did a weekly update, balance changes, and introduced new items into the loot pool
---
I know. Even before this update, the Robots in Watoga never attack me unless I attack them. I assume it’s because of the stealth mecanic because when I crouch in front of one, it says detected instead of danger. 
---
&gt; **I'm pretty used to** gameplay adjustments and **new bugs getting introduced**
---
How about old bugs being brought back?
---
Everything except health aid recipes (stimpack antibiotics etc) going from 94 caps to 940 which may be a decimal place error. I'll gladly pay more for plans knowing they will now static spawn at vendors.
---
Dense mod with fireproof2 was enough to completely remove TSE damge before the nerf, probably just dense or fireproof now would be more than enough. 
---
They pretty much have to implement this ASAP. I agree with all the price changes, as it makes the player economy more viable. But now they need to make the player economy intuitive and accessible 
---
PVP IN THIS GAME IS TRASH ACCEPT IT AND MOVE ON.
---
fo76 is empty , it is about contents not bugs
---
How did they let the bulk crafting bug through QA? 
---
I mean..it worked somehow 
---
I think I’m only carrying like 333 in Power Armor and 260 without... I carry a lot of weapons.... a lot 
---
ESO engine is more similar to WoW than a shooter. Which it in itself was a controversy at the time as people wanted a multiplayer Skyrim-like experience not elder scrolls skinned WoW. I'm not sure if they created their engine from the ground up or are they using a 3rd party engine for that. 
---
Adding netcode to an engine that was never designed to be multiplayer is a monumental under taking. All signs point to them continuing to iterate on their game engine. They plan to reuse this multiplayer tech, it is a huge investment for them. I honestly believe FO76 is Bethesda laying the ground work for ES6. The reason we don't have NPCs is because they haven't updated the systems to accommodate multiple player interactions. There is a reason they capped vendor interaction to just one person at time. 
---
It's time to move to anti armor. I'm a heavy gunner like you and with anti armor weapons things are much easier
---
Jesus fucking christ what a housefire
---
Having bugs reappear that were fixed last patch by screwing up the version of your software stream is a sign that their dev &amp; release teams have some incompetence that's not excusable.
---
the other issue is that all of the people that have played since day 1, are mostly all decked out with everything they need.. that kills an online games longevity. The higher prices give people something to grind toward. I'm sure once CAPS have value again, the prices of goods and event rewards will balance out again.
---
I would’ve suggested mod loadout but again you’re on PS4. Yikes
---
This translates to: Bethesda can add more p2w features before you will care. 
---
That was my thought exactly. With stabilized we could negate 95% of the enemy armor. 
---
Zenimax developed their engine in house for ESO
---
Don't stop fighting! The only reason this has never happened in the history of hyperbolic shit-posts is that the people gave in. Don't give in! Hold the line until they fire everybody and hire modders! It really must be that simple! 
---
I've yet to see an satisfactory explanation of furious it seems broken? I may be wrong but after 2-3 hits the damage bonus seems to cap. This could be a feature but we'll never know unless we hear it directly from Bethesda.
---
Ok, well thats fine and all, but I was at a SBQ last night.  When I arrived there were around 6-7 other people and all but 1 was basically standing around.  Once the SBQ landed, I found out why.  They were all melee and she went from 98% HP to about 20% HP in a matter of seconds before she decided to fly away again.
---
Even pre TSE nerf, I've never personally participated in a SBQ where the damage was that crazy.
---
The weight is the worse part.
---
I actually may have a solution. Log in, don’t move, don’t touch anything. Just sit tight. If you get killed then let it happen. After the game finished loading after about a max of 2 minutes time you should be able to move and play again. There is a glitch where if you try to move or do anything immediately it freezes your character
---
Bethesda- I still play Skyrim. Obsidian has great games in the past but the good recent games that they did have always included another’s studios work. Bethesda FO3 or South Park Ubisoft. The Outer Worlds looks promising but even that is with Private Division.Obsidian is awesome at story telling, but until they can create a new game from scratch, I gatta give the edge to Bethesda. At least we will know in the future since they are with Microsoft now and hopefully left the financial issues behind.
---
Then you must have poor management skills or something. I rarely have to repair anything and mats are easy to find, and I pick up whatI need along my travels and I sell enough loot that I can buy mats from a vendor should I absolutely need to. In fact I enjoy that "grind" because it's supposed to be post apocalyptic, and shouldn't have a chest full of resources to bail me out in any given circumstance. While I do see the issues with the game I can't help but feel like most complaints/criticism are for the sake of soap boxing, and like they're from a different game, but experiences vary. Fallout has always been a game where you become over powered relatively quick, it's always been a game I deliberately make harder because again it's post apocalyptic. If players are done the they're done, that's their right. But I enjoy the challenge of the "chores", it's something to do and it's never the same adventure twice. Sorry the game doesn't wipe your ass quite the way you'd like. 
---
They changed them to containers to prevent us from server hopping for them which I can get. However, having 1 cap/stash is ridiculous...
---
Who downvotes this? Great way to let it be known how the new patch is recieved. 
---
They never were there
---
Why not just give more caps as quest rewards? 
---
I know the recent patch unpatched a bunch of stuff from the last one.. I'm hoping they have another quick hot fix/maintenance soon
---
I watched numerous F76 videos, as well as some streams, and I can say with all sertainty that it is a glitch. No way the game can look like that, this is beyond even bethesda standarts. It's a rare and ugly glitch which is happenes to be very rare and because of that was not adressed by bethesda.
---
By the way, you play on PC or console?
---
The surface problem is that slap damage exists.  
---
The deeper problem is that Bethesda deliberately put it in, and it could only have been included as a bribe to PVP griefers.   
---
There is absolutely no reason the pacifist toggle shouldn't give you 100% immunity to all forms of PVP damage. Other than it being a lure to griefing PVPers wanting to engage in non-consensual bottom-feeding PVP. If you are prepared for PVP and your target isn't, you will always have a significant advantage over someone who has opted out of PVP.   
---
Funny thing is, a well prepared consensual PVPer takes LESS damage in PVP than someone who has attempted to opt out of PVP entirely. 
---
Buggerfall 😂 yeh but that was 1998 its now 2019 we have technology so advance this shouldnt happen nowadays
---
Funny that's when I stopped playing
---
Be careful what you said about gunsmith 5. You make it a perk that is always needed and they will nerf it like white knight. I am amazed by their reasoning. 
---
i don't get why so much hate. game runs good for me
---
1K per shot? Mine only went to a bit over 400, what perks are you using?
---
Though a lot of people aren't spec'd to do that. Us melee builds, for instance. It's also harder for console users to swap cards as opposed to PC users since they can actually save different card combos.
---
And I've killed all the scorched that the flying bats summon. Still no land. 
---
That's why I'm making another character that's focused on VATS with an anti armor, non legendary weapon build. They don't want to land? I'll kill them in a couple of shots while they're still in the air and the Queen in under 2 minutes, solo. 
---
I think they really need to pull some ff14 realm reborn shit to fix this game. I Love the fallout series, I love the majority of Bethesda games but this incompetence is embarrassing for this company.
---
I don't feel it's for a specific enemy as many creatures spawn as glowing ones. All glowing enemies are pretty tough and glow sight levels the playing field.
---
 whilst you're right that I can't tell if its a TS or not I can tell that all weapons he drew were explosive. Also yes he killed me a few times legit which again I don't mind losing the caps. It was after 3 or 4 deaths that I forgave, and turned on passive which doesnt keep him from hurting me I know but it made it so that we weren't hostile to each other and he shot me and killed me instantly. Also I WATCHED him do it to my friends again and again so don't tell me that "its unlikely" he one shot me through slap
---
Maybe thats whats going on because I have just changed a piece of my combat armour for a 1 * unyielding combat armour piece. 
---
       Thanks for the info.
---
ESO didn’t have exploits as much as 76 but it still had a very rough start for months, it was made by zenimax online studios though, not Bethesda game studios.
---
DEAR  u/lonevaultdweller 
---
As a veteran who played all the titles i can with confidence say that the heavy weapons regardless of ammo type and energy weapons have been and still are one of pillars that make what fallout is. as such in 76 they are sadly completely broken and in huge disarray and the list of issues is quite fearfully large but nothing that cant be fixed so i will try to list as much as i can for future reference and as a tip if you are looking to explore new balance avenues you should start by fixing these boys ASAP because they actually include a  huge part of weapon diversity which sometimes goes unnoticed here is the list:  
---
1-make sure all perks affect all they correct weapons they should be affecting cuz there many known cases of them not doing so.
---
2-the concept of power through volume of fire should not be the main theme of heavy guns but only a side positive point, with that in mind the current state of ammo usage per power output is just undoable even from a rich character point of view therefore a more than normal base dmg buff needs to be applied to all high RPM weapons while maintaining their fire ratio. special cases are as follows bellow
---
2.1-The mini-gun: a hunk of metal that is known to put fear in the bones of enemies in real life battlefields, this huge and majestic hunk of metal does abysmal dmg even at his high RPM and is basically an ammo whore that is just used for the sheer awesomeness of feeling it gives when you hold down its trigger at the moment.
---
so a moderate base dmg buff for the fast barrel and the tri-barrel and ofc a small rate of fire boost for the tri-barrel so its not outclassed by the speed barrel at all times and actually exist for a reason.
---
2.2-The [50.cal](https://50.cal) machine-gun : one of the heaviest most power weapons handled by a single person which is used as anti vehicle and anti aircraft should not have any problem tearing through anything made out of flesh and bone and only be stopped by heavy armor and super thick hides of Scroched beasts probably.
---
ergo we really need a more than normal base dmg boost to it and of some extra mods to add to its almost non existent mod pool specially a mod that adds a non legendary armor piercing factor while of increasing weight and reducing accuracy a bit or changing the ammo to armor piercing [50.cal](https://50.cal) whichever is more doable
---
2.3- The gatling laser: this majestic weapon used to represent the what meant to be the ultimate late game class of heavy weapons and would basically tear up any enemy and make a Challenger out of the players against the bosses in FO3 and F04. now its just a super fast firing, special ammo eating, rapidly breaking weapon that is only used by yours truly because it reminds me of the good old days and ofc how badass the model looks. It is in desperate need of a major base dmg buff on btoh barrel types and the charging barrel needs to stop firing like a crank shaft 1800's german gatling gun when you switch to it to improve you accuracy and save ammo therefore it really needs an RPM boost to make it even remotely useful and also the universal issue of energy weapons breaking ungodly fast which is maddening to a fixed heavy weapon character like me.
---
2.4- The gatling plasma: this weapon is actually in almost a good place from a base dmg point of view and may only need a tiny boost the main issue here is the way the weapon projectile acts with game physics and the weapon brake speed just like his counter part the plasma rifle a redesign of the weapon's mechanics is needed and i suggest using the old ones if you can since they work just fine.
---
2.5- The fatman the most iconic and probably one of most fun an unique weapons ever in the fallout universe this crazy nuclear catapult should really represent what it is meant to be !! a shoulder fired tactical nuclear death machine that is only used when you know conventional shit just don't cut it for that one enemy and you got bring in the "Overkill" gun that will probably kill you too if you use it wrong. right now its a mediocre super heavy weight weapon that is not that impressive and the ammo weighs 6 freakin pounds! which could be fine if the weapon actually needed one shot or 2 max to kill anything in game besides that one super late game boss like the SBQ for example ..... so yeah its also rapidly becoming a joke with the current nerfs to the explosive perk too. it doesn't need to be balanced in pvp that much cuz its super dangerous to use it anyway!! give that gun some love for the love of god!!
---
2.6- The flamer : this gun has always been the go to choice of players that have that little pyro-maniac in them and what to see everything burn! this gun needs to have its own separate dmg type like it used to and have separate resistance added for it to armors across the board and also the ammo is just too expensive and too heavy to craft and hold in any usable numbers. and ofc its mods reduce the durability of the weapon to abysmal levels and thats for a gun that already breaks super fast at stock model....
---
2.7- The rocket launcher and auto grenade launcher: both suffer from heavy and expensive ammo issues and low durability and now lackluster dmg too much. case grows worse for grenade launcher where the bear arms perk doesn't apply to it at all and sits at a massive 18-20 pounds weight and only 3 mods to be used on which also add a lot of weight and add very minor benefits. so fix those issues and give them a medium base dmg boost and make ammo worth creating we cant sell the extra anyway!
---
2.8- heavy machine gun: this poor thing is just BAAAAD like so bad and useless i cant even use it as a joke!! not even when i had a two-shot one pre nerf!!! its uses .308 ammo which is ofc common for the tiny dmg it does its just a laughing matter to enemies when they see you hold it.....
---
this guy needs a massive dmg buff and it had ZERO mods available for it at the moment which is just sad....
---
3- energy guns of the non heavy type also suffer from pretty much same issues and require some love ASAP to even make them viable options ! you don't understand how much you are handicapping your game by postponing their fix and balance and most importantly variety of choices a player can have!! you can just create content by simply fixing stuff so people are not stock with a very small amount of usable guns to choose from! it will also buy you alot time and goodwill with players as they will have tons of new stuff to try out and feel unique with. it just good developer sense my dudes!
---
Yes. I agree that it's a good idea to remove yourself until you feel less sensitive.
---
They should have opened the first vault by now at this rate I’m starting to believe we won’t get one for another 3 months.
---
Thank you for the info, ill keep this in mind
---
I have to recommend permadeath, its a real challenge (I died with a \~120 hour save because I got clipped by some wildlife), also there is always a chance your first freighter can be an S class, mine currently is an A. 
---
The base duplication bans are stupid. Mine duplicated 14 time, which was not actually any help or gain. It took 10 mins straight to scrap all the items to get my camp back to nothing again, with all the 100's of parts that duped. Something beyond our control, we were being punished for!
---
If people make shitty financial decisions I'm not gonna assume they have a really good financial advisor giving them good advice that they're paying to ignore and just make their own dumb decisions anyway.
---
Liar
---
I don't know if seeking out little optimizations interests you. But, 3 level 2 melee cards does more damage than 2 level 3s- for the same points.
---
Wait and see, by next month some of the balances and bugs should be ironed out a bit more.
---
Can I throw my useless perk cards?
---
Did you say 30 bobby bins? You must have 2000 carry weight...
---
games development used to have a lot more focus on testing, 10+ years ago when "patching" (particularly on consoles) wasn't available, devs had to make sure that the game was bug free. nowadays, with patching available, most companies have become far more lazy on that regard.
---
I'm sorry people downvoted you for understanding how currency works. 
---
Good god, as a guy running a Heavy build, the sudden weight of the Tommy Gun feels *weird* to say the least
---
When you get used to carrying about 8 guns that all weigh less than 2 pounds, it does feel rather weird when you remember that it's only for heavy guns and all of a sudden you're carrying a 15-pound tommy gun
---
&gt;nerfs that make no sense
---
Oh yeah, one shotting each other in pvp or 2-3 shot scorchbeast was balanced and needed no nerfs at all
---
I was actually wondering why Shotgun damage perks are in strength but I don’t get damage bonuses.... turns out it’s just not a thing... I don’t like it 
---
Yes and no. It's a fun game you'll never notice the issues with nerfs as you'll be starting new. However the freezing and crashes can be very anoying but not unexpected as I had some issues with FO4 when it was first released
---
Ultracite mods are found at Responder vendors. I've seen them stocked and it's probably a specific one but I'm not exactly sure which one it was. I believe it was Lewisburg since that's the one Responder vendor I go to on my vendor route.
---
Yes, get rid of that limit. Or raise it to 1000 caps per vendor per day. We understand you want to extend the games lifespan, but at this point I'm just logging in for five minutes to make my 1000 caps, and then I'm off to Destiny
---
Thank you! Seeing posts from the sub is like accidently opening up the Bethesda Customer Service email queue.
---
you obvis never been to r/fallout
---
Some lightweight armor as well.
---
I'm ready for you to show me where I said I "crunched all the numbers" I'm speaking from experience. My lever rifle went from 812 (Yes that's too much) to 234. Now, if my "broken OP" TSE weapon now only does 234, and the tse is still the highest output of damage on guns, I think it's safe to assume that the other guns aren't doing that much damage. Meaning melee builds are BiS (best is slot) I did not crunch the numbers, simply speaking my opion based on my experience.
---
I got to level 50 and was already sick of it. 
---
I just lift a question and i got negative feed, lol.. Someone here really against me. Unbelieveble get a negative coz a question!!
---
We are the QA
---
I mean really the TS and Explosive and the white knight changes are bringing said weapons and perks in line with everything else. So to me that’s balancing instead of nerfing. I get it but there needs to accommodations with such changes. 
---
This hasn't been true for 5 years.
---
It makes no sense to me how it weighs that much when my fully modded shot gun barley pushes 9.
---
So I got grognaks since it seems melee is gonna be the only decent thing so I’ll be like citto running around Appalachia
---
More like lol at anyone that pays money for in game objects.
---
Start the enclave quest line it will also give you access to nuclear weapons just look up how to start it
---
This is an excellent idea. 
---
Or atleast health buffs, oh wait..
---
Honestly a PTR would go a long way here.
---
I was asking questions about this.   The OP left out many details, probably on purpose?  Not sure.
---
He obviously got flagged for something similar to cheating or would not get banned.  
---
Not saying its valid or not.   I don't know any information whatsoever.  Plus he can be seen as everyone's hero sure, but behind the scenes, he made a mod that can instant reload, or unlimited ammo, or whatever and just not tell anyone he did that.   So I tend to trust a company's investigation in the matter when they have server logs and more evidence that any word of any youtuber or random musings on the internet.
---
Just saying Bethesda needs to investigate and make determination is all.  
---
Meele bobblehead can always be stacked 
---
Haha. "Let this disaster be a lesson". Good one.
---
You seem to miss the reasoning of adjusting white knight because they think the perk becomes a needed perk in every build. 
---
regardless if true... upvote that was awesome....
---
i was kinda hoping this player vending was gonna be in this patch. i still dont even know what they mean by it, we all have our similar assumptions but this is beth we are talking aboot...it could be nothing like how we are imagining.
---
i was hoping to unload all my 2 shot legendarys(legit found) and excess plans
---
&gt;Log in, don’t move, don’t touch anything. Just sit tight.
---
there's literally no choice but to do this considering you can't move or do anything LMFAO. I will definitely try what you are saying. Thanks for the advice. Kinda sad that this is where we're at...
---
Yeah, but the engine they're using for this game has parts from Morrowind (2002), and the concept of cells (so each area you enter is it's own level) was used even earlier than their first TES game  - The Terminator: Rampage 1993, possibly even earlier, but that's the oldest game of theirs I played.
---
They use ancient tech so it comes with something called [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt), i.e. there's so much reworking required that games based on that engine will always contain unfixable bugs.
---
That was the sonic boom from a bloody melee player swinging his axe at the speed of sound. The damage you saw was the wind from the blow missing the queen because if it really hit the queen would have burst into blood and gore instantly with the trees behind it bent over and the nuclear blast blown away instantly.
---
Nice.  That actually makes it kind of fun.  And you see the full "charging" animation as you load 1 to 5 fusion cells.
---
Now that we can make it work right, I wonder what the damage is like, and the "charge" modifier.  If it's 1x cell = base damage, 5x cell = 5x damage?
---
I had just been scrapping them and making assaultron helmets for my teammates.
---
Where do you even find safes???
---
Dont worry, I'm sure Bethesda will nerf the melee weapons as well. Just give them time.
---
I'm sorry but I seriously doubt this. to be fair I've heard of 2k melee damage builds but Never once have I seen a melee weapon that does over 200 base damage, with consumable buffs like chems and bobble heads yeah sure It can do some serious damage but then you're limited to the buff time. TSE works nonstop without the need to re buff. Also maybe he had the legendary armor like assassin but he removed all his armor after cleaning us out enough times that he realised we couldn't do anything about him as an extra fu
---
Yeah, me and my buddies are done with 76 for a while. It takes a *lot* for us to get to that point.
---
They stoped the stacking I think in this patch
---
I just read that with Harold's voice!!!! lol
---
If you ever walk through the golf club check the shelf in the hallway and the shelves in the shop in the bottom floor for golf outfits. They sell for \~25 caps each depending on your perks and if you take Mentats. They also only weigh 0.1.
---
I don't think it's really going that way. They certainly know their only way to survive making this first online game is by paying some attention to the community playing it. It all comes down to what they choose to do with community feedback.
---
Hey u/LoneVaultWanderer and u/LadyDevann this should be the feedback your looking for regarding this thread hope it helps. :)
---
That doesn't say much, without what level, what perks, mutations, gear, etc.
---
That said, have you ever noticed that in pretty much *every single shooter ever* most guns take multiple shots to kill something, but a single knife/punch/weapon bash will usually do the trick? In order to be balanced, melee has to be stronger. 
---
Consider this scenario: you come over a hill, and see a group of 5-6 string enemies with high powered guns. Now let's look at it from 3 players views: a sneaky sniper, a "heavy" (big armor, big guns), and melee. The sniper starts taking lined up shots, takes maybe 1-2 shots per kill. Has killed several before they are even aware of his position. Maybe at that point, he has to take shots faster, less head shots, takes a few more hours per enemy, but the mob is already thinned, he takes very little fire. The heavy just bears down and starts mowing down the crowd. It takes many shots per enemy, but with the high rate of fire, he still chews through them at a decent rate. Probably takes a decent amount of return fire, but he can duck into cover if needed. The melee guy starts running down the hill, is spotted by an enemy, and takes for from the whole crowd until he gets closer enough to start killing them. Each one takes 1 or 2 hits, but here's out in the open getting shoot up the whole time. Now what if those enemies are spread out? Doesn't change it much for work of the gun users; they just need to turn a little in between targets. But the melee guy, now has to run from enemy to enemy, all while taking his from all of them. It maybe the enemies are melee/creatures? Even better for the sniper and gunner, who can now possibly kill half or even all of them before they are ever close enough to attack. Mr. Melee, on the other hand, had to wait till he's right in the middle and tank all those hits.
---
Melee being able to kill things in one or two hits isn't op, it's balanced by the fact that gun users can get 3, 4, 5, maybe 10, 20, whatever, shots off before the melee user is close enough to attack once.
---
It was too common for me pre patch. I've had 3 starred not drop any legendaries and non starred drop legendaries. Also bodies would be glitched underground or completely disappear. 
---
Agree, nothing bad to say with the artists, they're awesome, but their Overlords.....meh
---
Look at you mister fancy here, storing weapons into his stash :P In all seriousness I admire you because I can only fit junk in my stash, even with a careful selection of what to keep and frequent vendoring.
---
We've had a line drawn about how far this goes. They've now just slightly leaned over that line juuuust to see how we react.
---
Adding the other weekly buff things before got us used to it happening as well to make it an even smoother transition.
---
Now I want to get a ton of melee bobbleheads just to say I killed a SBQ with a switchblade 
---
Dude rifles do suck right now and melee as been op scince launch my tse weapons would still deal less damage than my deathcalw gauntlet that I have no perks on I think the way to balance it is a flat 50% damage boost to all guns change 2 shot back to how it was and make explosive have 30% bonus damage so that both perks dont ruin a weapon's legendary roll like they do now.
---
I had dense and fireproof 3 and can positively tell you I took damage
---
Melee has the higher risk of dieing, up close in personal. Does it need a nerf though? Maybe, but not as hard as TS and E.
---
Sadly this is very common. They should fix this 3* enemies should only drop 3* loot.
---
Thanks for the reply, as I suspected not much else I can do :-)
---
I never considered the tormentor card before, but checking the stats you only get a 15% chance at rank 3!  Bloody Mess and Glow Sighted look like good buffs though.
---
Yeah I am almost always in “caution”. And it really feels like I get spotted easier.
---
They stopped explosive stacking
---
I don’t believe everything I read. If they were targeting perks that are required for builds to nerf they would have hit all the damage perks too. 90% reduced wear and tear is too much when everyone else is at 60. Same as the penetration for melee with incisor being 75%
---
Go to Watoga and do Mayor for a day quest, no issues then :-)
---
You made a statement without backing it up at all. If I propose a counterexample and you refute it by basically by saying "nuh uh," you cannot reasonably expect me to be convinced.
---
Your example is a start.
---
Don't nerf them. They're the only thing challenging left in this game for lots of players.
---
Happened before the patch to me all the time. it sometimes did this when I didn’t hit the enemies and it had one item in their inventory so I always thought the connection was ifffy at the time and caused the game to think I didn’t kill the legendary.
---
They will announce even more nerfs. 
---
Every game studio employs agile... an no way in hell are they doing weekly iterations. The fact that there’s plans sharing names / duplicate names / misspelled names shows no tech writers or shittt BAs. Lack of a roadmap or planned vision (prob) means a shitty product owner....
---
Good posting. That's why I left the game last Friday to re-play Xcom 2 until The Division 2 comes around.
---
I played that and honestly do not remember nearly as many issues, there was some problem with balance and a few quests where not advanceing as intended.
---
Maybe its selective memory...but I have played A LOT of MMO since I started on day 1 of UO in '97 and this has to be the rockiest I have seen. This game is IMO treatering on the edge of collapse and I am beginning to think they should shut it down for a month and release it with a DLC and complete server wipe of characters.
---
Maybe some in game tokens to make Leveling a new character. One token levels you immediately to lvl 50. Another allows you access to a Unique vendor where you can trade the tokens for pre made Legenday weapons and armor. Another allows for a complete PA set to appear in your inventory.
---
The only things that should carry over are CAMPs and Known plans (grandfather them so all characters on that account will know them) and ATOM shop purchases.
---
Obviously fix the game, add a DLC to make up for the release fail, Make this Survivor mode but fix the forces Pvp/Griefing in Adventure mode. Make this a game focusing not on PVP but on coop play.  FF14 did this exceptionally well. while very different game design there are lessons to be learned there.
---
I’m furloughing myself until next patch.  Then if nothing has improved significantly then I’m putting in mine as well.
---
Man... I have visual glitch in game, which persist since beta, I am not the only one, I found at least 7 people with it on PS4, Xbox one and PC, and Bethesda tech support said its because of my CPU. Just stop. This game is lost. 
---
Join the enclave and finish the Enclave quest line to get access to bunker. You start it by going to the abandoned waist dump and finding an enclave soldier in the cave. Be this is an endgame quest line so you’ll be facing a lot of high level enemies. Starting with 2 deathclaws in the cave. But the cool thing is at the end it shows you how to drop a nuke. And as far as watoga goes. You’ll be good just annoying because theirs constantly robots spawning that was like the police there. Just try and stay away from the Assaultrons at the south west until your confident.
---
low armor or something ?
---
This will be VERY disappoint if all they did was stop explosive bobbleheads from stacking but still allow others to stack.
---
&gt; Unless everybody is on Discord and follow orders blindly..
---
Would you mind expanding on why it's a no-go?
---
On average, how many hours were you clocking a day?
---
How are they not listening to us aside of the durability problem?
---
They fixed overpowered weapons, severe hotkey issues, plan scarcity and server hoping, cap stashes exploits...
---
They are hiring QA folks - about 8 positions listed on the website...
---
I stopped playing after they nerfed White Springs. Wasn’t much fun if you were not getting surrounded.
---
I am some how able to grab 50 to 100 atoms each time i play.... Currently sitting on 2400. Just bought the Manta costume too.
---
Look at the challenges, do them.
---
I agree mamy of them are bugged. But what else is new?  None of the "take a picture" challenges work for me
---
they should just shift the 1400 lbs of allowed carry weight to stash weight.
---
So you don’t believe the official patch notes said? That actually tells how trustworthy B company is then I guess. 
---
This is the exact wording quoting from dev “to help prevent them from feeling like mandatory picks.”
---
Don’t do mayor for a day until your lvl 50, that is if you want a lvl 50 all rise. Or els you’ll get whatever lvl you are at.
---
... or I’ll let the devs know because working in a bubble without a customer facing firewall is the worst thing one can do.
---
Ok so it was not a purely Bethseda game. I didn't know that.
---
Too late.
---
nice, what a simple solution that took this long to figure out. maybe now i can try out my 2 shot head
---
Explosives was the only one listed. I’m hopping on to check rn
---
Its very common for starred not to drop legendaries prepatch for me
---
Old bugs coming back is obviously bad.  This has happened in other games that I've played before too unfortunately.
---
If you don't have the patience required (and these games require a lot of patience), then just quit.  Uninstall the game.  And remove this subreddit from your favorites.  Simple.
---
luckily it is only a very **limited** time buff.. it;s not like the outfits will give those bonuses forever. They tried to "incentivize" the purchase
---
Ideas are meant to be shared, his response is plausible 
---
Seems like damage control for Bethesda. Suprising how they rarely delete low effort posts praising Bethesda.
---
Agreed. 
---
Solid suggestion.
---
&gt; **So given the industry trends and failures of this game, is a mobile only Fallout next?** 
---
Umm... Fallout... Shelter...?
---
Yeah, their attacks should not be no-clips and go through everything. They would be a lot more fun if the landed and were super-aggressive in their attacks. As it is, they sit there and only attack once every 5 seconds or so. Make them fierce on the ground. As far as the landing mechanism, they are easy to force to land once you kill the crew of scorched they spawned, but sometimes that crew is halfway across the map so no way they will land.
---
The point of a perk is to simplify and alleviate, NOT to trivialize or negate mechanics. The difference between pre and post nerf White Knight has NOT turned repairing into any more of a fucking chore, the difference in repair cost is at most one to two more per each material. If having to pick up ONE extra ballistic fiber to repair something is grindy to you then what fucking bird cage have you been living your life in. 
---
&gt; No reason to support that shit any more.
---
Do you say that because you finished the game? 
---
I've bought lots and lots of plans for C.A.M.P. items because I like to build. I rarely have fewer than 5000 caps on me. I hardly ever fast travel, I never buy ammo or aid items, and I  loot everything -- not for sale, but for scrap. I'm level 54, and I don't do the full vendor sweep every day. I \*do\* play a lot of events and daily quests, and hit up vendors when I'm in the neighborhood. 
---
I kill a lot of super mutants and cryptids. I search every trash can and dumpster for caps. I don't server hop, but I search every building I enter thoroughly and I find plenty of cap stashes and random handfuls of caps in containers (and I don't have the fortune finder perk). There are lots of sources of caps in the game that don't involve grinding through all seven vendor factions every day. And all of them are more profitable and more fun than waiting through seven load screens while you fast travel. 
---
They barely WORKED on the game is more like it.  An engine rehaul would be welcome but sadly it will never materialize. 
---
Yeah I think they would get less controversy and more sales if we just got mannequins.
---
They REALLY nerfed your TSE.
---
oh my goodness nooo :(
---
Yeah, this post was meant as sarcastic, but some people are really taking it serious. I thought the emoji gave it away. Either way I was definitely one of those people that logged on to test it out, but didn't find too much to like. My two shot plasma rifle now does 33 damage 😔, my bobby pins weigh .1 again and my mutations are all sorts of fucked up. I really wanted to play, but its getting so much harder to want to anymore.
---
You might want to check things out before you just react. The dude above you overreacted a bit, then you did the same. You can't scrap the bulk items to break them down; Whether this is part of the bug or intended operation, the result is that bulked items, when the bug occurs cannot be used to craft or scrapped.

Xbox One, Medieval Paul, N/A
---
After 5 hours of Post Patch Play here are my observations, &amp; issues with the changes.
---
1. Weapons are breaking much more quickly ( not because of Item 2)
---
2. TSE Handmade now requires 6-7 head shots on a level 48 enemy that previously required 2 torso shots at most, or 1 clean head shot.
---
3. Power Armor is Un-equipping upon entry, &amp; Fast Travel
---
4. Power Armor, and other Items are not re-spawning as they should, I checked 7 spawn locations on 3 separate servers, and only found 1 level 40 T45 Helmet.
---
5. Many enemies disappearing upon death, &amp; others with no loot
---
6. Legendary enemies not spawning, 3 separate runs through Watoga (all different servers) found only 1 legendary, and it dropped no loot.
---
7. Events not triggering, &amp; some triggering when not in the area, I had a Grafton event trigger &amp; remain active while in the Cranberry Bog, 15 minutes after leaving Grafton, and could not trigger the Census Violence event or opt out of the Grafton Event.
---
8. As a Stealth Rifle/Shotgun Character at level 100+, my game is now ruined as the damage nerf was so excessive, I no longer have any viable weapons with which I can take on any sort of high level mobs, much less a blast zone, (TSE Handmade, Furious Exp SG, Explosive Hunting Rifle, Furious Exp Gatlin, are all now useless), I have higher damage from a Death Tambo &amp; Assaultron Blade (with no melee or unarmed perks than I do from my 3\* explosive Combat shotgun, with all relevant perks)
---
I predicted before the patch that these changes would make melee the only viable end game build, but the effect is even worse than I expected.
---
At this point the only thing left for me to do in game is run my little Blacksmith shop, and since everyone can simply buy all the plans that I worked so hard to find, even that won't be viable for long.
---
Sincerely,
---
Heart Broken Vault Dweller 
---
Worth it.
---
Your right it didn’t read that one I skimmed over it since I don’t use bobble heads
---
if it's the submachine gun you need commando perks they are for automatic guns
---
Order doesnt matter does it? 
---
OUCH.
---
Did you ever drop it like I did when fighting the queen to put stabilized in power patchers place? 
---
I traded the bulk plastic and would never bulk it myself but I bulk most other things
---
If it's true, they just didn't know it. Cuz they never test things)
---
And this is why i stopped playing nearly 3weeks ago. I Brought and played before it came to market and was dissapointed everytime I logged on. I started a new playthrough of Fallout New Vegas and having much fun. Not planning on turning this crap back on for a long while maybe never who knows
---
Looks like you arent either 
---
Bethesda will only learn, when the players leave their game and the managers look through their data report on any given Monday morning and realize: We lost 'em. All of them.
---
I left the game last Friday and will never look back. 
---
The upcoming content? Too little, too late.
---
That's a report.
---
Update your mods if you have them.
---
attempting to scap the bulked items, doesn't appear to work with the bug either; at least for me. They stay bulked.
---
As someone who just had to recently renew their NY license.... and attempt to get an enhanced version and get veteran's stamp.... I thought the DMV was hilariously accurate.
---
Related story: NY DMV will accept DD214 as proof of veteran status but will not use it as a form of SSN identification. True fucking story. 
---
We are keeping it alive because we want it to be good? Nice of you to speak for the whole community there pal. Sorry to hear you aren't enjoying the game anymore, but believe it or not, there are those of us that actually do love this game. And no, we aren't just making ourself think that way because we are over-hyped fanboys. I have played over 170 hours so far and I still love logging in every night to discover new locations and environmental storytelling. I found the Penitentiary last night and it is awesome! 
---
Hopefully you can find enjoyment in wherever you decide to go, but keep an eye on Fo76, once they start putting out more PvE content, maybe you might toss a few more hours in
---
Bethesda Fun Police have heard your feedback. Going forward, all gun durability will now continuously degrade when equipped, even if they aren't being used. 
---

It’s probably the timing of your question.  A good question but not at this time when tensions are high. It seems bias and inviting for people of different opinions  to bash you. Even though I answered your question in my honest opinion, I’m already prepared for the downvotes with no opposing view.
---
As of today I am quitting as well. The stealth problem is game breaking in itself. How the fuck did no one remotely play test this patch before it was implemented? I knew there was a problem within five minutes 
---
yup, plumber nerf has me salty, i already chose to run a half damage weapon compared to machined weapons for the sole purpose of "oh, i can save repair costs at the cost of extra bullets"
---
nope.avi gonna have same durability now and take way more bullets kill. cant have any upside.
---
I dont think anyone duped cavaliers yet.
---
I cant find it on pay to win trading sites!!!
---
See you next week.
---
Must admit pre-patch they weren’t great, had a lot of low level nocturnal cultist blades and spears lol
---
I’m trying to hop on and test it now but I never actually use bobbleheads so never have any. Might try to buy some on the market. I hope not. You could breach the carry limit by consuming infinite strength bobbleheads to increase your limit and thereby the 1500
---
Put it on the back burner and return in 6 months  always good to get away if you burn out, plus the game should be in a better state and have additional content
---
This post broke rule one.  It is not directly related to Fallout 76 and is purely an attempt to bash Bethesda.  
---
And you HONESTLY wonder why you got downvoted?
---
So where can i get the Psychobuff Recipe?
---
Critical shot itself doesn't add to critical meter. 
---
I can afford a jetpack and 1 calibrated shock!  I never ever looked forward to server hopping at all; thus never did it.
---
I did find like ten T60 calibrated shocks, but that is one of the few PA that I never collected.
---
I have and I I was the only melee barley touching her it was the combined dpm of all the people hell alot were 30-50 and they weren't all tse either it's how you build not most of the weapons albeit the tse was tremendously op with bobbles melee can be the same they should have fixed that exploit first js
---
Well I got about 50 bobble heads to use before they fix that (I didn’t dupe I’m just a filthy hoarder)
---
1. Xbox One
---
4. A. Cannot press y to search cap stash about 80% of the time. I have level 3 of cap collector, and tried unequipping/equipping cap collector.
---
    B. Cannot move character, look around, or access pip boy on login. Can use VATS to select an enemy, but cannot shoot, back out of VATS, or switch targets/body parts.
---
    C. Enemies take quite a bit longer to load in than everything else on fast travel. Frequently, when they do load, they cause the game to freeze and crash.
---
    D. NPC AI in messenger and patrol duty is still extremely frustrating. I waited 12 minutes for the robot in patrol duty to get himself around a cell door last night.
---
    E. Bulked junk is not automatically broken down for use in crafting/repairing anymore.
---
I could go on and on with recommendations, but fix the game before you try to insert new content/extreme nerfs. People are less inclined to stick around and play a game that the dev team seems to want to nerf into not being fun if it doesn't even work.
---
Because, by building this patch on an old branch of code, I have zero faith in the ability of the devs to even handle the most basic aspects of software development (which that is). Sure, mistakes happen, but that’s such a rookie mistake that no professional should have made it, and that it passed any QA is so completely laughable.
---
I’m not saying I’m done with the game, but I am waiting for them to get their shit together before I come back.
---
Hah, kind of forgot what my username even was, but that actually really works 😁
---
Just saying that's a misconception that a dense torso and fireproof nullifies all damage.
---
DR plays a major roll
---
Not to mention you double posted it
---
Why are posts talking about the new bugs being removed
---
made even worse by their posts about new content just highlighting PVP mode. I dont care about a PVP mode if im still bored &amp; waiting for new things to do.
---
They must have missed the part where to secure recurring revenue you sacrifice the upfront payment.
---
Where were you when 45 hp flipped the tables.
---
They didn't bring in whole studios. They brought in their best specialist programmers to help lay the ground work of introducing netcode to their engine. Which is very difficult to do right. Netcode is hard, and you need hooks for it with literally everything that a player can interact with. The reason this is being done is simple. Fallout 76 is a designed to be a developmental test ground for ES6. That's my theory as a game dev and long time elder scrolls modder on the outside looking in, at least. 
---
They fucked it all up though. Management at Zenimax needs restructuring. 
---
Whatever you need to do to get yourself to sleep at night.
---
ThAtS a RePoRt
---
Keep an eye on updates. More content will be coming in the next few months
---
I got it a different way. 
---
A friend gifted it to me when he leveled up a new character. :)
---
I'm not sure that I agree. 
---
Right now the higher prices reward people that have used cap exploits and/or mule characters to store caps past the character limit.
---
For the rest of us, getting those plans for ourselves has just become more grindy. Worse for casuals that don't have a lot of time to obtain those items.
---
If you can still get all these items in the wild without purchasing them, it'd be less of an issue. Not sure if that's the case.
---
Grinds keep players playing online games.  Welcome to MMO-lite.
---
...I for one have had no problems with the durability, seems fairly balanced IMO. And screaming for leadership change seems football level childish and short-sighted
---
You just dodge their second reasoning and only mention their first reasoning. Typical. 
---
Yessir my vats kills aren’t raising my crit bar at all, when before every vats kill would at to my bar until it was full.
---
I like the atom store, the same people making costumes and new beds aren’t the same as the people fixing bugs they are not similar situations at all 
---
I'll agree and I'll disagree. It's not that melee is overpowered, it's just that melee builds are easier to deal with. There is fewer perks to worry about and once you have them you're pretty much set and forget. Enemies aren't over powered, enemies have armor classes and mechanics that people are simply ignoring and not building to fight easier. These are not Fallout 4 enemies and should not be treated as such.
---
With melee, once you get incisor, you can eat through tons of stuff. Mirelarks, Rad Scorpions, and Super Mutants all have high armor classes, incisor negates 75% of that. It's the difference between having a weapon do 50% damage and almost 80% of it's listed damage. Guns can do this to at a 40% rate of ignoring armor but I guess people are not putting Perforating Magazine on their weapons or don't want to invest in piercing. They put Quick Reload or Larger Capacity to increase their overall DPS with less reload time and their DPS vs. heavy armor goes down and then they wonder why a dumpster sized shrimp covered in concrete is taking no damage.   
---
My gunner runs 2 rifles and a 10mm semi and has little problem keeping up with my mutated-as-hell abomination of god that one shots nuked WS ghouls with a power fist. You just need to be prepared for where you're going. Enemies are more diverse and complicated than FO4, not simply healthier.
---
With melee you don't have weapon spread, weapon accuracy, etc like you do with automatic fire. Every hit, usually, hits. The trade off is you're probably in rage to get hit back. If I'm fully spec'd to punch things in the face (or where ever you punch a Grafton Monster) the trade off is that I can't headshot it from a distance or stagger it before it sees me and make it have to do a Terry Fox run before it can hit me back.   
---
We're squishy humans attacking mutated monsters in a post apocalyptic world with a reinforced ski; we need to do damage quickly or we'll be eaten by the ugly thing 18 inches away from us. They same courtesy does not need to be extended my other character hiding invisible in the bush doing 2.3x+200% damage with a head shot from a silenced rifle.
---
Melee is horrible some things. I don't just mean SB's and SBQ. Swarms of Blood Bugs are annoying AF if you're low on AP. Mothmen are a nightmare sometimes. Deathclaws can get into a stagger combo that once you escape, you're back out of range. There are somethings that melee just can't handle that well but you don't hear melee players saying, "No fair, we can't hit Scorched Beasts with our current build we don't want to change in anyway because this is how we chose to play!" You just don't hear it.   
---
tl;dr Every enemy has a weakness, it's just less prep and though to exploit those weaknesses with melee builds. Incisor, tenderize, punch, punch, punch, Invest in Piercing Magazine, don't let things get within striking range, and learn to hit a man sized target in the head from a distance.
---
Oh of course not.
---
In their eyes the only problem is ranged weapons!
---
meh
---
Link?
---
I've only ever defended the game, no point I'd tearing down others who have a different view unless it's something fucked up lol. I didn't want to give up on this game, I really tried hard not to but this is just absurd now...
---
There is one. It’s actially not that bad as a quaint little time sink.
---
Clear your cache if on console.
---
I’ll do it 
---
Yeah, 100%.  Was going to write this but beaten to it, more eloquently.  You can have a million QA testers, but if their tickets aren't getting prioritised, then that's not on them. 
---
If only they knew what CICD is.
---
This needs to be addressed immediately
---
u/bethesdagamestudios
---
This happened to me before patch as well. Whenever fast traveling in Excavator. 
---
It’s really not that big of a deal. The HP increase really isn’t that much and PvP is almost nonexistent anyway. I think you’re over reacting just a bit.
---
If one group of people can't have fun no one can make melee into AS seen on TV sockem boppers!
---
It also feels like that when you are at level 50+, killing low level enemies is far more challenging than killing higher level enemies in LVL 10-
---
Or is it just me?
---
I mentioned melee stacking, or bobblehead stacking and someone yelled at me. Like they ONLY nerfed explosive bobbleheads...yet made no mention, nor nerf, to stacking other bobbleheads...but I’m a troll for complaining about that? NOTHING should stack.
---
That’s perfectly fine, dude. Just add my Discord at 
---
How To Rotate Text In MS Paint#6763
---
Stupid question and I think I know the obvious answer, but if I don’t put an auto receiver on it, the Rifleman perks and such work for it correct?
---
I didn’t know this but I agree.
---
It all starts with:
---
“Oh its only a little boost.”
---
and
---
“It’s a limited time event.”
---
And then all of a sudden the game loot crates that drop legendary weapons smh
---
I threw mine away, got a better one before I started it. But yes, it's decent until that point...
---
Probably, but still silly
---
Trump's brother is on the board for Zenimax. Zenimax ran by a bunch of rich old white wall street Republicans that have a real history of screwing people over. If that tells you anything.
---
Great so people are still going to one shot others even if your in passive mode. 
---
unfortunately they rolled back on the dupe fix, so the scum bag weasels are back at it again.
---
Here's the thing this was either pre-patch, a hacker, a glitch, or (not to be rude) this was made up. The way people passed slap was spaming explosive bobbleheads and hitting through slap. Also with the nerf to explosives they wouldn't 1 shot even in pvp. 
---
The engine for Elder Scrolls online is completely different and not suitable for Fallout 76. Quit pretending you know what you're talkin about lmfao. MMOs are way different because there is no precision shooting aspect and every enemy is automatically locked onto anyway when you target them whereas in this game you have to actually use all of your senses
---
i havent seen a price hike for plans, for example other stash type boxes with my setup cost 700 caps even before the patch, the ones ive found today that i didnt own are also 700 caps, and other camp items are usually around 200-300 caps like before. the vendors never actually had power armor mod plans(only a handful were in the vendors) so only those may have had the price hike, it will easily cost you 3-5 days just to buy one plan seeing as they are around 3-7k if you take all vendors caps each day(1400) obv higher cha will help lower the prices for some people.
---
I spent about 8 hours doing it. That was the last time I played.
---
Honestly it wouldn’t bother me one bit if they did reroll the weapon traits 
---
With a squeaky sound every time you hit a scorched with a super sledge for insult to injury. HOW DARE YOU PUT TIME AND EFFORT INTO YOUR BUILD
---
Games with poor story need to be carried by gameplay. Games with poor gameplay need to be carried by story.
---
Fallout (and to a lesser extent TES) are not built on an engine that lends itself to combat, an integral part of the gameplay.
---
Therefore the better studio is the one that can construct the better story. Obsidian by a fairly wide margin. While Bethesda do great environmental design and storytelling this is supplementary to the main story and Obsidian are just better at it.
---
To be fair, about 8-10 of us took her out an hour after the patch. My TSE gatling did even less than it did before of course. Someone was still able to take pieces out of her though - maybe a melee bobblestack? The bobbleheads are a serious issue. Nerfing TSEs as far as they did was ludicrous.
---
is no idea, that really sucks
---
dude hasnt even said anything since before launch. Wild
---
Lol poor baby reading must be hard for you
---
I believe it is okay, the community is holding Bethesda by their throats, I believe everyone needs to take a step back and realize that the development process wont ever be perfect. Only thing they can do is voice their opinion if they dont like a change. I'm getting tired of people constantly telling them how they should do their job. 
---
&gt;I’m sure Bethesda is trying to fix these issues.
---
What makes you sure of that? 
---
TRUE but the key is to make those chore or grind somewhat fun and make the rewards for doing so worth it. 
---
F76 epicly fail in both. The chores are horribly tedious taking up 2/3rd of your time and the reward is to go out adventuring to do what? so you have get stuff and come back to do more tedious inventory management.
---
SBQ is not worth it anymore as drops suck and now you have a very small chance to beat her and you will spend 5X the ammo you used to use.
---
I am sticking with F76 as I have just loved the series so much but have to say once you pass 100-200 hrs of play it just is not FUN, sometime interesting but no fun.
---
Having friends in game and goofing around may help but as a solo player it is not worthy of the FALLOUT name IMO.
---
“Change mechanics of the game”
---
+15 HP is a cute bonus. That is not pay to win
---
+15% XP gain would be a different story
---
I'd much prefer the game to be balanced so that it wasn't so bullet spongy. Makes sense for massive creatures but some of the smaller ones can be surprisingly tanky e.g. wendigos.
---
&gt; abonnement 
---
Had to look that up.
---
That's bet as well.  Here is the catch, they need junk/cap sinks so people have reason to keep gathering both.  From my experience if you have the perks your junk grows to the point it needs sold,  no perks and you need the occasional farming run for junk.  Ditto for caps, by making all plans available people have a reason to grind for caps and run nuke zones for flux.  
---
The damage shouldn't be doubled from a perk. If grenades aren't worth carrying, the base damage is too low.
---
I think the decision makers are still trying to make this fortnight.   "They're not fighting enough.  How do we get them to fight?  I know, make them fight each other for resources.  make everything break faster so they need more materials.  Yeah, that will make them kill each other"
---
You gotta scrap your junk and get some BULK.
---
Yea, but who cares. **Paying for a stat bonus should't be for any duration.** 
---
I don't know.  I managed to get the Lever Gun plans at the Lewisburg Station over the weekend, so I was thrilled that I picked those up.  But I've been level locked out of the Handmade plans and had no luck at all with Patrol Duty.  Especially since I couldn't get that daily to consistently trigger.  (And last time I got DC'ed halfway through.)
---
I suspect it'll take me two-three days of some judicious trading on my part to build up the caps to buy the Handmade plans, but that's just one set of plans I'm looking to buy.  Since it seems like they removed the RNG element for all plans, but increased the prices, it just means I'm going to have to adjust. :-/
---
Well that explains it. That character has the targeting HUD on its X-01. Would blue screen 2-5 minutes after entering the whitespring when i was trying to farm plastic. Figured was tied to either a sound issue or PA. Been running around out of PA for a bit which explains my lack of blue screens.
---
I don't mean to sound petty here, but have you ever played a Bethesda game before? They're notorious for not fixing bugs.
---
Damn that would be awesome. 
---
They always do. Why is this any different?
---
Why heavy weapon in endurance? All of it's perk cards are in strength.
---
Just like when Shaggy uses 2% power.
---
I’ve seen it myself.
---
Did it twice yesterday with no problem at all - your group were previous crutch users obviously.  First large group took under 10 minutes, probably closer to 5.  Second group took longer, I timed it closer this time, about 15-16 minutes.  Both times from Forward Station Delta which has way more adds compared to Drop Site V9.  Used less than 1000 rounds each time though I did switch to melee partway during the 2nd fight.
---
You can learn to play, or uninstall.  See ya!
---
Their first reasoning is what you brought up? 
---
I don’t need to defend anything you’ve not given me one reason why a 90% reduced armor repair cost perk is necessary when everything else is 50-60%. 
---
Also your in here complaining in a tread talking about reducing repair frequency at base level which could benefit across the board now that everything has a common repair frequency with perks 
---
How about instead of ruining more people’s fun Bethesda should buff ranged weapons rather than nerfing melee
---
Can't you people leave politics out of non political subs?
---
i guess people will be okay with weekly small fixes to fix that 72 things leading to 1 big patch with more bug fixes and events tweaks like you mentioned.
---
It's funny because they seemed to have a prototype back in June. 
---
Not anymore. They nerfed the shit out of White Knight with this patch.
---
I don't really think the enemies are op, it just makes the game a slight bit more challenging. Instead of 1 and 2 shooting them it takes 3 to 5 with a TSE 
---
hi hope so, had 4 crashes in less than an hour this morning
---
Very similar to how Bethesda has handled TES Legends and switching from Direwolf to Sparkypants.
---
Thanks! 😁
---
If we're talking aftermarket, I don't follow that so I'm not sure, but in-game the serum/recipe prices are the same as before
---
I totally agree. I pre-ordered the day I saw the announcment. When they said the beta will be in October, I thought uhm, a bit late but okay?
---
So, I even took a week off when it was released and was so happy to be finally able to play with my brother. Fallout is one of the few franchises we both love.
---
When things started to turn ugly, we both defended the game. We loved it, exploring the world together, killing our first deathclaw and stuff like that. And holy shit our first nuke...
---
But things changed for us. We had a few disconnects, nothing too major tho. When we decided to build camps and we saw how many feet have to be between them it was ridiculous.
---
I started to build mine southwest of Watoga at the end of the map. That was our turning point. Cause suddenly a guy lvl 53 appeared. We were 72 and 101 at that point. And this random guy pulled out his gun and started to kill us with 2 shots. Over and over again. Even spawning at Vault 76 didn't help.
---
After that the grind for scraps to repair our stuff started. And never ended...
---
I really wanted to love that game, trust me. But it's not rewarding at all. If you're not playing melee you deal almost no damage and that's not how this game should work. Bethesda needs to make drastic changes to their priorities to rescue this game and themselfes. I always had in mind that this might end the same way Mass Effect Andromeda has, but to be honest, it's even worse...
---
You've never played ESO have you?
---
The problem with nerfing the 2 shot explosive, is that now just a two shot weapon and just a explosive weapon are basically useless now....
---
There are rumors that a dupe method that used to be fixed is not fixed anymore. If the rumors are true, and Bethesda dont want their newly introduced economy to crash so soon, we might see a hotfix quite soon.
---
Take that up with Microsoft and PSN, they're the ones that limit the ability to roll out fixes at will.  They'll probably patch the PC like they have in the past, but the consoles are going to have to wait for those companies to approve it which takes 1-2 weeks.
---
Fun gameplay keeps players playing games, and if Fallout 76 had even just half as much grind then the gameplay would be enough to keep a lot of people around. 
---
Maybe I came off as more negative than I meant to be- I love this game. I wish it were allowed to stand strong on its merits, rather than being chained to a grinding structure that it really doesn't need. The world of Fallout 76 is wonderful to explore and discover all on its own, the grinding keeps that from being as good of an experience as it should be.
---
I thought that too for awhile, it is a bug, just keep hitting trade then cancel out until the caps show up. 
---
I went weeks missing out on the 200 caps per vendor because of this. They were always at zero when I tried to trade.
---
So it's a temporary Stat boost to push sales?
---
Fucking christ...
---
Actually you can if you pay attention to the daily challenges. I've racked up over 5000 in two months. Again your point is invalid.
---
The world is huge and I take my time and enjoy it. I read terminals, listen to Holotapes, etc. 
---
Moral of the story. They need to get with the new age and get a new engine that can run these types of games with little to no downfall. Consoles and pc's and even tvs are getting graphicaly more advanced and their system need to catch up. Maybe im wrong i dont know
---
I feel u, I do understand the need for a nerf, but Rn when I see high lvl weapons dealing less the 80 dmg (gatlings and energy weapons) I really don’t get the reason behind. Sure gauss rifle hitting 1800 dmg was bad, but did we need such an extreme nerf to the point of making a good amount of nice weapons unusable !
---
- The nerf to TSE also gut punched any other explosive or two-shot weapons
---
- Bobby pins weigh a ton
---
- Can't interact with multiple MODUS terminals at once
---
- Crafting doesn't use bulk items meaning you have to individualy break them down if you want to use them.
---
- Fusion core generators broken by a factor of 10
---
- Some duping method is back, supposedly
---
It's pretty bad.
---
I don’t know what specifically about this made me laugh out loud but I did. 
---
I get that 15hp isn’t much of an increase, but it’s a slippery slope, soon it’ll be ‘15% increased damage’ or ‘15% increased chance of finding a legendary weapon’
---
You seem didn’t read my posts. And unable to read poster names. 
---
I am just saying be careful what you mention gunsmith 5 is needed in every build because one of their reasoning is it will be nerf if it needed to be in every build. 
---
What you said is referring to another poster not me. 
---
People these days really amazed me. 
---
The sonic spam attack is mostly miserable because of the vfx. There is a mod (that I didn't manage to install) to turn the white and blue donut to a smaller green projectile, like a large plasma ball if you want. 
---
&gt; If you don't have the patience required
---
Ok, here's the problem. While a game is making progress towards being good you can quantify how much patience will be required, you can extrapolate based on progress how long it will take for the game to become acceptable. When a game regresses there is no timescale you can infer that ends with it being better, there is no sum total of bad patches that can reach your end goal.
---
It's unfortunate that "server stability" is affected by a couple dozen players. The software needs rebuild/replace/rearchitect. This is ludicrous in this day and age, with the technology that's available. The compromises Bethesda chooses to accept because they know the current, obsolete, outdated framework are NOT acceptable in a $60 product.
---
Estimated 2-3 rounds per enemy, plus the misses. Maybe around 200-250? 
---
But like think about it in the immersion way... With melee weapons the more strength you have the stronger your swing it. But no matter how good you are with a rifle or shotgun your bullet is still gonna do the same amount of damage. 
---
Was this actually confirmed?  They rolled back the dup fix?
---
I'd read the garb of mysteries gives the same effect, is that accurate?
---
How much Bethesda pay you for this?
---
See. That's Bethesda'ing.
---
Really starting to regret that level 1 charisma build.
---
Why would you go form 100% to 25% why not go to 50% cause in real life a shot gun will and could kill someone with one shot. Now with this patch it takes 8 rounds to kill a lvl 22 super mutant not cool please fix ASAP. 
---
I can see now where they use our money.. 
---
eh really the opposite, levels above 50 don't count for anything.
---
With Pipe weapons, once you get a Hunting Rifle or 10mm, there is zero point in using them. So you're only really using pipe anything for a couple of levels then they're useless. Unless you had a TSE version, but...you know. I really love the feel and look of the Pipe Revolver but once you can use Lever Action or Combat Rifle theres no going back.
---
Na, the current limit is fine.  Its a MMO, not single player game.
---
I care.
---
Stealth in PvE seems bugged alright.  I can be 100% hidden and camo'd and mole rats from far away will still instantly 'teleport' to me and attack.  I am now put in caution if theres a mob anywhere in the general area it seems.  Hopefully it's just a bug from the changes to stealth for PvP and not 'working as intended' for PvE.
---
How am I the collective problem?
---
Ah the old balance for pve and screw up pvp problem (Wow had this) or conversely; Ah the old balance for pvp and screw up pve problem.
---
Guess it's a good thing I got my recipes just before patch!
---
Its not slipping past us, the TSE contoversy is just so much louder.
---
I agree that we should cry louder about this one. Its just a tiny bonus. But if this catches on, they might try bigger things. I dont want any p2w in my games.
---
I'm ok with that, at least I have a clear goal. 
---
Console player 
---
Another new bug hopefully and not 'working as intended'.
---
Probably because explosives weapons where neutered
---
“It just works...”
---
Some Workshops have junkpiles so if you take one and keep one of those, you have a junkpile. I've looted a couple after taking workshops and haven't found the ROI any better than simply looting a location for junk.
---
Have fun doing any damage with that explosive gun after the huge. 75% Damage nerf. Try commando perks, tank killer and adrenaline. Perception and Agility trees
---
I no longer care about they're fixes/patches - they made more problems than they fix, 21:9 mode still sucks (and now, after patch, mod fixing that mess stopped working), BGS don't give a f... about what community thinks, they don't even play they're own game (because they'll see the mess latest patch done).
---
Now that you say it, some sort of "contract" system would be awesome. The item is yours for X minutes so you can mod it, then it magically comes back to me.
---
You guys are annoying. Hurr durr...need new mernergerz!! Perks er nerfed!!!
---
Switch to a game that doesn’t suck balls.
---
Prob about 10k is as much as someone can do with a single hit now. Has to be sneak critical.
---
Melee needs to be nerfed.....
---
Well also you don’t have to pay. I have the race car bed, sniper outfit, monacle, and enough to buy the silver shroud after work🤣 the only money spent on that game is the money spent on initially buying it. It’s a shortcut man but not pay to win, because in reality the cosmetics leading up to here ( including the ones I have) kinda sucked and if you played at all you’d have some atoms. 
---
  Total it up, it’s really not pay to win if you can get anything from just getting atoms, and I’m thinking that’s how most people do it. If that’s the case, it’s a case of playing more and being able to afford more.
---
I also read this, which changes things slightly.
---
The adjustments to melee are coming, I'm sure. 
---
Perhaps years of modders fixing everything for them has a down side 
---
3\* rolling pins &amp; tire Irons are what I get a lot of, I guess I should have kept a few since my TSE Handmade is now so useless.
---
I’m sorry we don’t have the same views and you have resorted to slander. Unfortunately I’m not the one downvoting you.
---
doesn't change the fact they're not doing a good job by any means. a monkey could google preapproved PR responses. "the team is looking into it", "it's planned for a future patch" and "we can't wait to show you what we're working on" is the only thing they'll post.
---
meanwhile the game remains just as bad- no, worse, despite the immense amount of feedback the cms passed along. if they're of no help whatsoever themselves, and their input is wholly ignored, then what exactly are they good for?
---
I peaced out a month after launch. Glad to see it was the right decision.
---
Good gear, she only has like 100k base hp before she buffs from leeches my team regularly kills her in 1 or 2 min legit even with leeches
---
Quick cash grabs with micro transactions is all the rage now.
---
Playing an explosives build has become a real chore. With the nerf to the explosive damage perk I need to craft a crapton more of the already heavy and expensive ammo. Kinda sucks when my build was already sub-par in comparison. 
---
The only thing my grenade machinegun does is throw all the loot around, waste my 40mm and blinds teammates. It kills ghouls though...
---
They really should among other balance buffs increase the direct hit damage for explosives if they want too keep splash damage lower.
---
there is no reduced repair cost perk for repairing weapons.
---
im astonished that beth doesnt do hotfixes daily when they release a new patch that messes things up so bad, even single player games can get hotfixes till they are properly fixed in their next patch.
---
When you say people you mean bethesda staff working here in Reddit, hide behind reddit users?
---
Hey, let’s not nerf incisor, because melee is literally the only way to do damage in this game. 
---
This comment was made by #BuffGunsGang
---
I agree with the plans. I liked having to hunt for them, the feeling of finding a rare plan in a comtainer I fought my way to. Now yoi're just searching for junk amd stimpacks, which is nowhere near as fun. And with the vendor caps still limited, it'll take you a stupid amount of time to save up for the rare plans. At least you had a chance to find it before then.
---
My two shot explosive combat rifle went from 433 damage to 160 damage! Also my Bobby pins, which I now have over 400 of, weigh 40 pounds! Why!? Buggy, buggy, buggy! Shotgun, thank god, was not affected. My problem is they're not fixing things, but make changes to the game that don't affect anything other than damage, damage was glitching, my loading into a game etc is! Fix the issues before you make gameplay changes.

#  [PAY-TO-WIN?] - Unstoppables +15 Max Health 
---
Okay, so I'm not trying to create drama, but I feel this is worth mentioning. Here is my logic:
---
1- Those outfits will basically supply you and your team with +15% Max Health (February the 4th)
---
2 - Whilst you can get those outfits using atoms (earned in game), you can also pay for those outfits with real money
---
3 - Therefore you can pay real money to get a temporary 15% Max health.
---
Now I don't see this as a massive deal (on 15% health isn't that much...), is this the way Bethesda is slowly implementing pay-to-win?
---
No matter what you feel about it, the fact is that you can pay to get a statistical advantage in game. 
---
Personally, I think this could lead to another PR nightmare. Who validated this as being a good idea? Did Bethesda not see that this will give rise to pay-to-win accusations?
---
Not a hater, but not a defender neither. I'm just a bit surprised / shocked that this made it past the validation process.
---
It's what Dayz used to do. Was a good thing. 
---
 ugh... it is pay to win... How the hell do you not see that. PAY MONEY TO HAVE BETTER STATS THAN PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T PAY MONEY.
---
Oh, you mean, pay to win...
---
I do sometimes wish that the fusion generator you can build just upchucked a fusion core every 20 mins or so. 
---
There are perks to decrease score weight and ones to increase fcore duration but they’re all under intelligence which is already a pretty competitive special attribute if you don’t want your power armour and guns disintegrating. 
---
I imagine the devs want us fighting over power plants to secure the core generators, but what I’ve instead seen happen is after an hour or so of a server being up, someone’s done the rounds and picked clean every fusion power plant in the wastes, leaving you pretty much farming heavy assault bots or finding random pa spawns for partially depleted cores.
---
 Can I ask how much content you need for your YouTube channel? Or how much is Juicehead paying you?
---
Haha, was just thinking, I bet I could make a boat out of two planks and plenty of duct tape.  Would be a lot easier than fixing fallout 76!
---
I feel your pain and I agree that the "premium" might be a bit too much.  With some careful trading and focusing on my goal, I can generally net about 500 caps a day in profit.  I think I have about 1k in caps at the moment, so I should be able to acquire the Handmade plans with two-three days of play.  (I presume that the 2k cost I've heard is before Hard Bargain and using Grape Mentats.)  
---
But that means focusing just on that one set of plans, and there's plenty of others I'd like to acquire.  I'm used to the grind from WoW, but these days my time is a lot more constrained.  I'd be hopeful that Bethesda might realize that they jacked things up a bit too much... But given some of the changes to things like White Knight...  
---
Still, I just know that acquiring the Lever Gun plans was a tedious process of server hoping and travel... And I managed to luck into them over this past weekend when stopping at the Lewisburg Station.  But prior to that, it was very disheartening to never find them on a vendor.  And being level locked out of plans?  That really sucked.
---
800 damage. lol 
---
200s is much more reasonable
---
PVP system seriously feels like they totally forgot about it all the way through 'development' then at the last minute someone remembered there was supposed to be pvp, so they just rushed to cram something in, working or not. 'That's good enough' is the feeling I get.
---
I'd like to know this as well
---
ESO was not a copy paste of Skyrim. It was built from the ground up by a team with a decent amount of MMO experience.
---
Yeah the only issue I had on XB1 was the 95% load screen issue. I had a lot of fun stomping around in my Colossus.
---
Honestly doubt this, 76 has made “Bethesda” slang for broken. 
---
Nope. S.P.E.C.I.A.L bobble heads don’t stack. 
---
This is my fucking point and all these people don't seem to think this is a big deal.
---
But there's so many features of this game, how could anyone not love this game? With features like blue screens, 2nd and 3rd loading screens, nerfed  Explosive launchers and guns of the sort, robust quest content,  exploits all over,  sweet gamer apparel and swag,  nerfed perks and much much more lol. 
---
*  I have played every day since Beta and I do suffer through the pain, and I know how you feel. trying at most times but sticking it out to see if this game ever gets better. Has potential and can't give up on a just yet especially since I bought the limited edition.
---
Wonderful this should have never been allowed in the first place
---
Nope I read your posts and replied accordingly. I understand your stance on saying it’s mandatory, but it’s mandatory and in line with all other perks. They obviously feel that 50% increased durability on weapons and 60% on armor is balanced. White knight and Plumber are now “in line” so the fear of future nerfing a single perk seems misplaced. 
---
That doesn’t mean big guns or melee
---
Reddit.jpeg
---
We arent sure how the mechanics work. The text says the bonus counts for each "unique" outfit. So the garb might work but a group of garbs wouldnt. So for the full bonus you would habe to buy at least 3 outfits, if only unique hero outfits count.
---
Even with bobble head stacked damage you can’t one hit someone in passive. This has been proven multiple times on here and YouTube. 
---
Did they nerf explosive shotguns?
---
I a double barrel troubleshooter that used to have no issues with taken down level 40s with one shot. Now I’m spending 4   When one shot would take them down to 10% Health. Now each shot only does 25% off. 
---
I haven’t played in a while, but did log in last night. It was very annoying since I have a shotgun build.  
---
To answer those questions.  I got mine form a queen drop. Mine isn’t a two shot explosive, just a double barrel explosive. 
---
Kind of reminds me of the original Far Cry AI. Remember getting sniped through the jungle from 40 miles away while you crouched hidden in the foliage?
---
Ah good times.....
---
&gt;Was THE bonus to have
---
Well, it still is, kind of, considering that most other effects are either smaller bonuses or very situational, or both. Most of them are like +30%, but only to a specific enemy. Instigating is +100, but only if the enemy is full health, which is great if you are solo and kill everything in one hit, but otherwise, not that useful. Bloodied can add significant damage, but only if you run around almost dead. People say two shot wasnt op, but even nerfed from 100% to 25, it's still in the top tier of prefix effects. And explosive is still, definitely, the best secondary effect. It still let's you double dip damage perks. It still let's you do aoe that can hit multiple enemies, or hit the same enemy in multiple places.
---
Ahh, I see.  Mine did between 1410 and values above 2k depending on if Nerd Rage was procced and Strange in Numbers was activated.  I can't tell you what it was with chems and Adrenaline stacks, because I was usually too focused on keeping my stacks up and killing the SBQ to check (and my Bloodied Gatling was far more effective on her anyway).
---
Honestly, after running multiple builds, I feel Adrenal Reaction is pretty much required for large damage numbers.  Even at high (not full) health, before I specced for low health and Nerd Rage, the damage numbers difference was fairly noticeable.
---
It's still a nerf on White Knight. And when most people find repairing tedious and too frequent already why not bring the other perks up to White Knight rather than nerfing it.
---
Yes. The semi-auto receivers get bonuses from the rifleman perk cards.
---
Automatic receivers get bonuses from the commando perk cards.
---
The amount of people crying about OP melee are gonna get melee nerfed next update, then NO ONE can have any fun
---
I’m sure they monitor it, nobody doubts that.
---
Its like whenever something gets 'found' it just gets added to the list. And god knows how long this list is.
---
They prolly just write in on a sticky-note and put on a devs desk....on the pile of thousands of other sticky-notes.
---
I like how this article mentions they are "hemmoraging users" when the game has near zero microtransactions and no monthly fee.  They are riding solely on initial sales dollars here.
---
Also, of the 3 vendors in the Enclave bunker, the far right and left are busy? And I've been in caution since I entered, where is the enemy? I rely on this to tell me if I'm in danger, which I'm obviously not!
---
Ok I see so basically they skimped out on having 3rd party help and we're still beta testing because of this.
---
Bet it isn't even original Red Bull 
---
There's video of one person soloing the SBQ with a non-legendary automatic combat rifle.
---
Not sure how any of this is relevant. You don't need thousands of players to validate the state of a bobby pin weight value and if changing something else interferes with the private values of an independent object then the code is objectively awful. And even if it was awful then there should be basic tests against the code that flag 'Hey, this thing we updated a month ago is broken now'.
---
It's called regression. It is the worst kind of defect apart from security flaws because it basically says 'Hey, your development process doesn't work'. This is the equivalent to finding a desiccated canary skeleton in your mineshaft.
---
They'll release a patch next month that will break even more shit.
---
Get the perk that makes repair like 90% cheaper.  Then it's only 1,1,1 to repair.  But if you need it, then run Fort Defiance.  It has about 10 ammo bags which equals 20 BF.  Enjoy!
---
If you're competative and you want to win, you do have to pay. That's the fucking point. If you want 60+ HP to match the same bonus as the guy you're going against, you absolutely have to pay to be even with him in stat bonus. That's pay to win. I don't care how small or long the bonus is for.
---
lol that’s why this post was intended to give feedback on bringing the baseline durability up. But 6 in one hand half dozen in the other 
---
Now you are back to their first reasoning and missed/dodge their second reasoning. 
---
I'll admit not all of my perks are there but I have two Max rank damage perks and maxed out demo expert
---
also had it happen on pc once or twice
---
Exactly. Really I don't know why the explosive legendary is tied to normal explosives. It should either be it's own effect that isn't affected by perks, or just add a flat damage increase. Now they have to actually buff all regular explosive weapons. And I don't understand the two shot. We already had the horrible accuracy loss, so why? They should rename it one and a quarter shot. 😆
---
&gt;Fun gameplay keeps players playing games
---
While true to an extent... when it comes to online games, Grind &gt; All to keep the community active as a whole.  That really fun thing to do is all fine and dandy, but if it's one and done, the player base is over and gone.  It's a tried and true equation for online games.  Make the players do the things over and over.  They may gripe, some may leave, but overall it keeps most of them playing.
---
The economy always was trash because of sever hoping. I guess it got even worse
---
Just as a frame of reference: before the last patch, my AntiArmor Explosive LMG (uses .308) could damage 75. Not great, but decent if the enemy were close.
---
After the patch and taking the explosive damage away, it damages 33. That is a really low amount of damage for something that uses .308 ammo. 
---
To compare, my explosive 10mm smg does 101 damage after the patch, with all perks equipped. (super mutants now take a full magazine to the face, but thats another story)
---
To me, it doesn't make sense that an LMG hurts the enemy LESS than an Light Machine Gun, something that was meant to be mounted most of the time. 
---
I don't know if you read this, but I want to thank you for reading through all this.
---
 Not just my comments, but everyone else's suggestions and feedback as well. I cannot imagine how it must feel like being an obvious fan of the game, and having to read all the feedback, good and bad, and still react as professionally as you guys do. 
---
I stopped playing a week after release.  There's no heart to this game.
---
Do y'all ever stop complaining?
---
Fired 1500 cells at a scorchbeasts Queen, can confirm it’s a kamehameha
---
Do what Warframe does. If you pump out frequent hotfixes, everyones happy, and you dont have bugs piling up. 
---
To be fair that particular plan has not changed in price, it was always around the 12,000 cap mark. I would see it occasionally but never buy it.
---
I can’t launch 76 from the “launcher” have to run from the Fallout76.exe, not a huge deal but certainly wasn’t a thing before today’s patch. I fully reinstalled both the launcher and the game after trying to use the verification process and still doesn’t work right =\
---
The overseers quest can’t be completed. They said future content will complete it. 
---
Perhaps they could...hire the modders? Hint hint 
---
Gonna need details bro. I'm level 140 with "good gear" and can't put a dent in her, nor can most of the other people I ever see taking shots at her. You sound like a bobbleduper.
---
1500 cells, so 300 five-charge hits?
---
When you shot them were they near part of their base? Splash damage? Missed and hit part of their base?
---
As for the one-shot part, no idea man.
---
Still not paying 20 bucks to paint my power armor. 
---
It's pretty easy right now for players to one shot each other. Has been for quite some time. I run a 5 stack Unyielding melee build. I've never hit a player who was wanted that I haven't one shot. Doesn't matter what level, armor, power armor, health...Unyielding rifleman can do it pretty easily too. All you need is a Bloodied weapon. 
---
I wonder if they just have terrible memories, and forget what they patched previously? I'm picturing something like
---
Marketer Steve: "Hey guys, it's time to roll out this new patch. Let's make it smooth and quick!"
---
Developer Josh: ... but but but the boss says that is has to be under 4 GB, and its well over 6 GB... We don't even have time to test it... What should we do!?
---
Steve: "Cut some shit out! Pick whatever! Just get it done!"
---
Josh: "Great idea! I think we put a bunch of stuff in there last time, that probably isn't too important! I mean, I don't even remember what the hell we fixed, so what's the worst that can happen?!"
---
Steve: "You're going places Josh."
---
* Camera fades out with the two people shaking hands.. (Josh has a thought bubble of his grandmother giving an approving thumbs up and a smile)
---
... annnnnd SCENE!
---
Was excited for this game, played off less than 10hours I think due to bugs and issues, total fucking disaster.
---
Might play again at some point, probably okay with friends if you can convince anyone to buy it.
---
You sir are right. After lvl 50 I’ll take whatever bonus I can get to boost stats. Why do you think there is a “level cap?”  
---
did you server hop at all to check if its static. a low level could have passed by to lock the area that low recently
---
I find it amazing that Bethesda was able to unstack a single bobble head but not the rest, yet they've lazely  grouped bulk junk in with the mods so you can't auto-scrap bulk junk 
---
I didn’t say it did? Lol you said you can stack strength to get carry weight and I was letting you know that you can’t. 
---
This, but that would take more work or at least that is always their excuse.
---
I'm mad for whoever worked on the environment. That's the only part of this game that hasn't consistently disappointed me. It's beautiful, and it's a shame we can't enjoy that because mechanically the game is just rekt. I started playing ESO. I logged into 76 last night to see what kind of mess my inventory and weapons had become. I was so mad I immediately logged back off lol.
---
I went through 5k rounds yesterday just trying to do normal stuff. No reason basic mobs should be needing half a clip from my legendary tse handmade when I have over 12 perk points invested into buffing its damage.
---
Good tip. Thanks
---
wut  
---
Everybody I know who plays is now "oh ill hop back on when they release new stuff"
---
Guns you got small medium large rifles pistols shotguns energy explosive etc etc. so yeah, melee doesn’t need nerfed. People don’t understand it’s an online game you can’t effectively use all weapons. Melee builds are designed to maximize one melee type, not OP, simply more strategized. I’m lvl 90 melee build wreck everything, yao guis still fuck me up all day 
---
I've seen people one-shot the SBQ. I think the overpowered things are getting out of control. 
---
See ya!.. When the game is shutting down due to lack of interest.
---
This leads to a race condition that creates power creep. You buff each thing a little bit. Each buff seems to make each other thing seem like it needs a buff. Instead of nerfing, you buff other things to compensate until everything is more powerful than it should be.
---
There is a reason why nerf is one of the tools in the shed.
---
Oh. I didn’t read my own post. I’ve been replying to things all day
---
In all my hours of play I never once saw a plan for calibrated shocks. I saw the mod itself, for about 6-700 caps, but never the plan.
---
Plans SHOULD be more expensive than mods.
---
&gt; our #1 priority remains taking care of known issues and new user reports that you have been sharing since launch
---
Does this mean we'll never see new content because everytime a 'patch' is released it introduces a raft of new (and with the latest patch existing) bugs.. so it'll be bug fixes forever?
---
These twats are in denial. Lol
---
&gt; Supposedly fusion core extractor back down to 0.8/hr?
---
The rumours are strong in this one.
---
Why didn't you mention the duping?
---
Then how in the world have I been instantly killed by a single shot in passive mode, not wanted, not in a team.
---
My tse handmade rifle went from 561 damage to 160......WTF!!!!
---
No it’s someone who plays more having an edge. Sure the availability is there to pay, but with the vc being available in game, I doubt a large base is actually spending money rather than grinding. And a grinder who plays everyday for hours compared to someone who plays once every couple of days honestly should have something to show for. 
---
Some people reported that the duping is again easier. That might be a cause.
---
Jesus agrees “you nailed it” :D
---
Considering it only increases base damage 20% each.  A base weapon of 100 damage would only increase would be 20 damage.  so all 3 would be 60 damage increase max. With the 2 shot you add 25 points of damage to that. 
---
If rifleman perk effects second shot then with a base of 25 damage each tier would increase the damage 5 points. So you would get a bonus 40 damage from the second shot part. 
---
This gives you from a base weapon with only 100 damage a new number of 185 to 200 damage depending on if rifleman perks effect second shot or not. This represents an 85- 100% damage increase.  Nearly or very actually doubling the damage done by the gun.
---
&gt; my 5 points for the demo expert perk
---
Explosive bonus is 20% of base damage. With demo expert the increase of 60% equals out to 12 points of damage added to base 20 for 32 damage.
---
A 32% increase in weapon damage with a splash attack that while not as useful against individual mobs it is great against groups of enemies allowing you to hit multiple targets at once. 
---
Combine them and you are looking at 192 damage for first shot then 45 extra damage from second shot effect. Totaling 237 damage over a base 100 damage rifle.
---
&gt; nd 3 stars of legendary is only worth an additional 80ish damage?
---
Considering bonus damage from rifleman perk is already shown when you craft the weapon. The bonus you see is from the legendary effect(s) and the explosive expert. 
---
I do have to ask what level your level rifle is at? Because I got this video here
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AOt01baAL4
---
That shows a level 45 TSE Gauss Rifle go from 600 damage to over 1,500 damage with perk cards.  Later in the video a scorch beast shows up and with the perks to boost sneak attack damage to 3.50 they literally one hit kill a level 56 scorch beast who had around 80-90% of it's health. 
---
Later still they charge up a shot with hidden bonus to instant kill a level 50 Mirelurk Queen in one shot 
---
Later still combining all the buffs he kills a level 65 scorch beast in 2 shots. 
---
Agreed. I'd much rather grind for caps and know I can get a particular plan than theoretically have cheaper plans that never spawn for me, like the fucking Cooking Stove. 
---
you're welcome.
---
The game should use partial cores first I have a crap load of 50% and 25% cores that never seem to leave my inventory
---
OP enemies need to be addressed, yes. But melee still needs... adjustments. I was getting one-shotted by another player last night with a mole miner gauntlet. Killed me 4 times vs my 1 with a furious handmade &amp; all maxed non-auto perk cards. The only thing that saved me from further deaths was he got bored killing me repeatedly &amp; left.
---
Cool cool cool cool. 
---
I think it all falls down to the ideology people have regarding that Bethesda is a triple A studio so they should live up to their rank. Which I agree with in part
---
No, my reasoning is all basic builds should have roughly the same amount of points to be equally as effective. Even with every explosives perk available, overall an explosives build is less effective than almost any ballistic build. So if at full spec'd build (explosive &lt; ballistic) I don't see how reducing the ballistics damage modifier costs to match explosives evens things out.
---
Like I said previously that a perk is good to switch out in any situation is how I read that. Your wanting to argue with another person interpreting a 3rd persons statement, if you want the context of it contact Bethesda and quit arguing with me 
---
So far it has been pretty low every time but I will hop a few more times to confirm!
---
So this is the curse of modern gamedev. Take your famous, succesful and beloved IP and throw it for some quick cash grab, consequenses be damned. 
---
Blizzard went this way, Bioware too, now Bethesda. And they said NetEase (chinese mobile company responsible for ruining Diablo) invested heavily in Quantic Dream.
---
If it goes on, in a few years there won't be a single decent studio in the world. 
---
This...it's been fine for me.
---
Shhh! Don't say anything. The more Bethesda knows perks work to reduce grind the faster they're gonna nerf it.
---
Kind of kidding, but also it's true.
---
They aren’t, the mods are still there but no plans. 
---
I take 3 guns and a Melee. I end up using them all because they break.
---
But yea, with the nerf the last few Queens have been sooooo close. ugh. there are still some good melee builds out there because when she lands her health actually goes down but to get her do land now just sucks. so much ammo. my stockpile of 5mm and 5.56 have gone done nearly 75% just since yesterday. bullet sponges are awesome.
---
You dodge the question again. Because deep down you know what that quote means but you just kept trying to be ignorant about it. 
---
In the early days of the game I loved it, but now I think it's probably the worst AAA game I've ever played. It's buggy, boring, the story is bad, the world is even more static than Fallout 4, and the pvp is awful. You can like the game all you want but at this point I think Bethesda should just can 76 and start working on a new, hopefully better game. 
---
I normally one shot wanted players by using high Level explosives but it’s possible they just had the right legendary effects and perks 
---
"Walking Cane Barbed Mod" 75,000 caps
---
It does in that equation, going to add a physical object for visualisation.
---
You have a cake and someone says you get 50% of what's left of it.
---
     You think you get 50% of it.
---
If someone then says they are taking thier half first, you would probably say okay. Assuming you get 50%.
---
    Because your 50% is applied after though, there is only half a cake left so you only get half of that, 25%.
---
Now in damage reduction, you would hope to be the bigger slice guy, despite you both get 50% off.
---
If I take the 40% first then I want to take the 20% after 
---
Of 100% you have 60% left
---
Then of the 60% left you take 20%
---
That gives you 48% of the 100% left. 
---
Giving you 52% damage reduction instead 60%.
---
Alternatively if I take 20% first I have 80% left.
---
Then I take the 40% from the remaining 80%.
---
That leaves 52% left.
---
Giving you 48% damage reduction.
---
So you want the bigger numbers first and the more broken that is the worse it gets, because there is more layers for this loss to occur. 
---
This is my understanding of maths though so always double check...
---
It's unclear. The silence given the response today is pretty deafening. 
---
Doesn't mean anything one way or the other in terms of whether or not we'll get a hot fix but if we don't get a hot fix in the next day or two, my guess is even the more moderate people are going to be livid.
---
Careful now when describing character uberness, they'll put that info on a future nerf-watch list, apply a patch, fuck things up for 2-3 weeks and then move on to the next piece of bullshit stumblefuckedness of working with gaming files.....
---
ESO had worse duping. 
---
The launch was that bad that it was pulled from shelves and relaunched a year later as Tamriel Unlimited to coincide with console launch.
---
It was the best thing for the game in the long run as its gone from strength to strength. 
---
I have the same perk and run the same type of build. It's nice, which is why I fully expect it to get nerfed in a future patch, without prior warning. 
---
Bobbleheads, magazines, chems, anything that could be used multiple times resulting in stacking of effects should not be a thing whatsoever. The bulk junk thing really blows my mind...because we’ve all spent so much plastic bulking everything...now they’re forcing us to unbulk it?...how about just removing the bulk option from game and make all junk a sellable resource instead of only specific/bulk junk. Bethesda needs to hire the community for think tanks cause holy shit the people they have don’t know a damn thing about stability.
---
Balance by buffing is nice for the player base and bad for the game ultimately.   Good post.
---
Still, they reiterated multiple times that stuff like this wouldn't be sold in the Atomic Shop. But I guess it's ok to lie to your customers according to you.
---
Cause you are the one taking this as some form of balance proposal.
---
Explosives would be shit even if they would cost 1 point each, so cause of that other stuff shouldn't be changed? 
---
(Shrinks below the table)
---
I’m calling it, 
---
Bethesda rushes release of Elder Scrolls VI in order to play damage control on their reputation. As a result the gameplay and story suffer, but paid reviews give it a 11/10 and so the majority of people get tricked into buying yet *another incomplete Bethesda game** at launch 
---
Me too, and Grafton Steel. Maybe could happen fast travelling anywhere.
---
I can confirm that. It's definetely harder (or should i say near impossible) to stay undetected after yesterdays patch.
---
Sign in, do events that bother to start, vendor hop for daily 1.4k caps, log out. repeat tomorrow.
---
You can't buy caps.
---
As an actual dev, this a shit show. 
---
You're carrying 130 bobby pins?  What does your hairstyle look like?
---
Could we be getting more information?  Yup, no doubt.  The lack of communication from Bethesda is partially a result of the vitriol thrown at them whenever they peep out from behind their doors.  Every tweet, post and message is responded to with the typical 'you suck and should be fired!' type messages.  Instead of keeping things constructive folks act on emotion and the messaging is blurred.  Stinks, but I don't see that changing on either side soon....they're reading but they won't respond.  Similar to the 'No Man's Sky' release when they updated undercover with no communication for a long time after release. 
---
Uh, I was farming west tek last night and not only were the bulk of the mutants level 68 but a considerable amount were legendary (a 2* outside and a 3* and no star inside). Typically I see maybe one per clear.
---
None of it is confirmed. Apparently because the weight of Bobby pins people are saying the new patch rolled back changes in patch 4 (below), which included a fix to a dupe method. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patch_1.0.4.13
---
Lol GG troll. You’ve effectively got me to reply several times without giving any insight to why your view is correct. I applaud you. 
---
Well, it's not like TSE's though. In order to hit like that, there's actually some risk involved. Like having to run around at 30% health. Whereas TSEs let have a shit build, be a shit player, still one shot everything. 
---
With Anthem around the corner and The Division 2 slated for early March release, I doubt they will recoup any users. 
---
I put my effort back into Destiny 2, (I want the forge weapons and armor!), until Anthem releases, also pre-ordered TDiv2 so I can play with my brother who lies approximately 15 hours away.
---
I lost interest in FO76 when I realized that the people who kept their B.E.T.A. levels pretty much ruined the game and economy from day one, then continued to surge ahead breaking all the rules and screwing up everything for everyone else.
---
Selling in game assets for Real World money has been illegal since 1999, and somehow these morons either didn't think or care about what their actions would do to their money source, and the others who played it as it was meant to be played.
---
What I don't like about fallout 76 is that pushed the release of ES6 and Starfield 3 years in the future. If the game would have been like new vegas in the aspect of being just a different game while we wait for the next. But they sold it like another big installment in the series and it is not.
---
It just works!
---
It's one of the better rifles in the game, but the hype was mostly around the plans, which were difficult to get if you weren't between level 15-44, as the plan for the Radium Rifle would start to appear instead of Handmade. You could server hop for the Patrol Duty event but even this wasn't guaranteed. They do appear in the world sometimes, I have found 3 legendary variants, including a two-shot non explosive, but even with about 200hrs in I have found maybe a dozen all together. I bought the plans last night just for the heck of it.
---
Seriously dude, what the hell happened to the sub? People are raging about very single thing
---
You may be doing something wrong. It doesn't take me 15 shots to kill a glowy boy with a non legendary recover. How many of those shots are missing? Maybe you're so used to the majority of damage being the explosive part, so you are in the habit of just shooting *near* an enemy? Are you using vats and crits? Headshots?
---
Lol u r dumb
---
The game is already a Beta sadly
---
A fucking automatic  Grande launcher cost 4k with hard bargain level 3 like what the FUCK!!!!
---
It feels like they don't even have a focus group. When they announced TS nerf, every single player said that the problem was E, not TS, and wow, didn't they realize it themselves? Anybody could tell them so, literally anyone who played FO76.  And still they somehow managed to stay ignorant and made that announce. This is beyond understanding. 
---
There is so many ways. If you don’t have a video showing what you was doing since you logged in then I honestly can’t tell you. Could of had a workshop though. 
---
Sources? 
---
They released a regression patch to a live service production environment. Someone should be fired or at the very least reassigned.
---
Imagine if after all of that grinding they nerfed your weapon that you built your character around.
---
Then step back and ask yourself what their plan is to make the grind last forever?
---
Melee or ranged?
---
It has been proven that you actually can.
---
I'm a melee-build, and yeah I've one-shotted other players before... by using a crafted combat rifle. 
---
Melee isn't crazy OP. Players are just very squishy.
---
So with plans pricing quietly increased, we're still capped to vendors having 200 caps. so much fun.
---
Gave you a quote and you kept dodging it. I applaud your ignorance. 
---
Yeah? I guess I stand corrected corrected, then! Hate it is happening for me, but glad it isn't the case globally. Still sore about Monster Mash, though. That and infinite loading screens and game crashes.
---
Bethesda didn’t develop (gameplay) ESO, they published (advertised, shipped copies) it. They’re handling both for 76, it’s not really a “Let’s not use those guys this time” situation, it *was* a “Hey can we make an Elder Scrolls themed MMO” situation a few years back.
---
I have to echo some of the comments here.  On paper, I see the logic ... increase the availability of plans via vendors, but make them more expensive.  Unfortunately, from what I understand there has been quite a significant amount of people taking advantage of exploits - and for those people, well ... dishing out 8,000 caps for a plan isnt going to be much of a stretch.  In fact, it plays into their hands more than anyone else, doesnt it?
---
I would have thought the safest way to deal with such changes would have been to introduce a new currency for the purchase of plans - similar to tokens you receive in other MMOs - that cannot be exploited (yet!) - when making such a substantial change.  I guess perhaps Bethedsa are of the opinion that horse has already bolted, and the time to consider something like this would be the next "new" content patch we see (i.e. when we see new plans).
---
I was never fond of the RNG nature of finding new plans or the server hopping to find your plan of choice on a vendor.  This "fix" however seems hasty and not fully considered.  It really does shine a massive spotlight on the already questionable cap limit on vendors - a cap that IMHO was more of a hang-over from previous Bethedsa titles than a specific design choice.
---
salty. I like it.
---
Also experienced this several times since patch on PS4
---
Said the same this morning. They need to get new content in asap otherwise people will just give up in massive numbers.
---
Thanks buddy. I don't grief, have barely done any pvp whatsoever and took my time planning and building my character just to have him nerfed so that he's useless. But you don't ise grenades and it doesn't affect you so fuck me, right? I have a hundredish hours in the game myself and much of it has been a bloody mess but i could enjoy it. I put a lot of effort and time into my character who definitely wasn't OP, that has been wasted. 
---
The changes they have made have broken the game *even more* though lol, it's not just that people "don't like" the changes. I encountered many gamebreaking bugs immediately after the latest patch. The game is a struggle to play and if you want to deny that then you have ya head buried in the sand. It's disappointing and continues to be so. 
---
I'm taking a break for KH3 anyway, but I don't know when I'll be returning as it seems with every update patch list the changes being made aren't good ones, with the exception of the stache limit. Not very assuring when it's a huge list of nerfs. So many more pressing issues that need fixing.
---
The game hasn't been too buggy for me lately though. 
---
It's not that it's slipped anyone's radar. I saw a post much earlier in the day about the same thing.
---
It's just a small and temporary thing it's giving it too much credit to consider it pay to win.
---
As for the slippery slope, we're very very far from endorsing loot boxes for pay to win. The current state is a non-issue. When it does become significant enough, then sure, up in arms comrade. Until then, it's just fear mongering and muckraking.
---
Don't be like those outrage Youtubers. Actually wait til there is a problem worthy of your outrage before crying foul.
---
It doesn't matter what I'm doing. I'm asking what you're doing, based on your claims. Avoiding those details makes you seem even more like a duper. Please provide details on your godlike build.
---
Clearly they’d rather just take the code for free “known plans” 
---
looks like
---
Doubtful the dev room is just a bunch of code, we're not in the BSP era anymore.
---
If anything, the whole damn map gets baked with each patch release and having to bake two versions as well as re-compile the map scripts (if any) and doubling the code base giving possibility for bugs to rise in the non devroom version etc.
---
Nah man this shit ain't just 12-go
---
No thanks. I love playing Fo76.
---
&gt;I find it amazing that Bethesda was able to unstack a single bobble head
---
That is surprising. I think the nerf to TSE had to effect every other TS and E weapon similarly because the code is all tangled together. So we've got TSE handguns doing less damage than machetes. I would have expected the Bobbleheads to be coded similarly.
---
Guessing that the Bobblehead code is new for '76 and the weapon damage system is mostly inherited from FO4.
---
Right? They need a PTR. Amateurs through and through. 
---
While true to an extent... when it comes to online games, Grind &gt; All to keep the community active as a whole.  That really fun thing to do is all fine and dandy, but if it's one and done, the player base is over and gone.  If the player can get what they want in that single time, there is no incentive to go back.  It's a tried and true equation for online games.  Make the players do the things over and over.  They may gripe, some may leave, but overall it keeps most of them playing.
---
They need to scrap the whole agenda on this latest patch and focus on new content. It will be the only thing to bring back it's playerbase. 
---
For them it's one step forward, a dozen steps backwards

Well, you hve to win in order for P2W. What are you achieving from the extra 15hp? It's next to nothing. There's no point in making much ado about nothing. 
---
notice?  they mentioned it weeks ago.
---
You are welcome. Next time read the patch notes in more detail so you won’t miss things. 
---
Autumn also brings mechwarrior 5: Mercenaries. 
---
The last one was mechwarrior 4: Vengeance/mercenaries and it was over a decade ago. I hope it'll be good.
---
It doesn't have to. Engineering principles, transparency, and accountability can help. Culture is also a big driver in how they handle failure.
---
No people in management need to be fired. Starting at Zenimax.
---
Interesting. I don't fully know how these things work so it's nice to get some insight.
---
Thanks,
---
It’s not up to us. 
---
Read the Into the Vault articles. We've known for weeks about it
---
That got nerfed, its only 60% less materials so its 2 ballistic fibers per repair
---
Please send me link. 
---
Great point. I do like the “Obsidian style” of story telling which is Choice and consequence. That aspect can drive multiple play styles alone. 
---
It wasn't good for the customers at the time though really :(
---
I mean she's just one person, I'm sure she's trying her best to pass along information. At least she's here posting/commenting, which is way more than most of the devs. Attack the ones not actively on here. 
---
No problem, this whole thing is pretty confusing imo
---
Probably had radworms. They are increasing all buffs by 50% right now. Not just negatives. So marsupial is making me jump twice as high with radworms on etc.
---
lol
---
Agreed. Does it have some issues? Yes. But i honestly dont get why there is so much complaining. Too many people who threw all their eggs in one basket right now i assume. 
---
i was in “caution” almost the entire time i ayed last night. def broken
---
they don't even need to put too much thought into it: split the game between pve and pvp servers. roll all nerfs back on the pve ones. disable legendaries or nerf them by 90% in the pvp ones.
---
done.
---
I would like a video apology from Todd Howard and Pete themselves and than explain what they are going to do? The truth. Not this bullshit about so many companies working on this game. Everything moving forward
---
So you're not meant to end up wanted? I may have had a stray round hit their build I guess.
---
Lesson learnt.
---
Are you living in a cave? It's been talked about on this forum every single since they announced it weeks ago.
---
Is 2 weeks not enough notice for you?
---
To be fair they said PvE content was in March since they apparently thought they could fix everything before that
---
Yeah that perk has changed now. It's 60% cheaper and also breaks quicker now
---
&gt;Thoughts?
---
I think you're a troll.
---
To me it is a problem. This is the first stat bonus available to buy in the atom shop. Is that not concerning? That is an issue to me.
---
I mean yeah they did say cosmetics only. So I’d say that’s where it veers off. But pay to win? I just don’t think it’s that out of control....now when they release golden atoms or some dumb thing that only has a price tag attached, we can go up in arms about it. But for now I think it’s okay.
---
Although the effect is neglectible, it is like you said a first step into an absolute no-go zone. This can not be allowed to happen!
---
Will do. Next time you reply to a thread please state your reasoning for your thoughts on why a nerf is unnecessary rather than just quoting something and accusing others of dodging 
---
I do believe him quitting Fallout76 but I am not sure about the gym thing 
---
So you think the TSE weapons were perfectly fine?
---
True, I was oversimplifying, sorry.
---
Move over NMS, there's a new King in town.
---
NMS is actually good though now. Seriously, go give it a go.
---
I'm certain this wasn't intentional but donning my tinfoil hat for a moment, *what if it was?*.
---
Previously when they weighed significantly less, bobby pins were a great way to "bank" caps. Now that they weigh 1/10 of a pound again, many people are probably going to be dumping them. That combined with the price increase on plans makes me wonder if this was intentional to get people to lose their bobbypin banks and hold less caps overall?
---
All the work...
---
The powerful rare weapons were duped into oblivion and sold to the majority of the player base. That doesn’t constitute hard work 
---
Having said that, I totally agree with the needing trend statement; I don’t like it either. I’d rather see some foresight in design instead of the rush to market crap. 
---
What are you talking about? This was telegraphed like two weeks or so ago. 
---
It's called a Skinner's box. 
---
They're are exploiting you.
---
That fixed it for us as well. Thank you.
---
I'm a melee build.  If you're upset that you cant hammer a flying enemy to the ground then sorry can't help you. Again, you have the option to kill all the scorched it summons.   They land more often than not.  There are some places they won't/can't land but they are in the minority.  People just don't know the mechanics.
---
Went to a stash last night and no search option just a few caps inside, went to the exact same stash this morning for the purposes of science and there was the search option, cap collector 3 was equipped both times so no idea what the problem is but only 3 out of 6 cap stash at Poseidon energy had the search option last night, couldn’t check the cooling tower stashes as someone had powered up the plant.
---
&gt;  You can't scrap the bulk items to break them down
---
Yes you can, according to multiple reports.
---
Yeah I'd be bummed to lose the game for a year and many of us would be pissed off but it'd be nice to get a game that fuctions correctly
---
"They know what they are doing" 
---
Thre is pure comedy in this line, it's brilliant. I want that slogan slapped across the game cover for an even bigger laugh..
---
&gt;But i honestly dont get why there is so much complaining.
---
There is no timescale on which a game that gets worse with patches can become a good game. No amount of patience, leeway or slack that can be given which results in a better game somewhere off in the distance.
---
Rest assured he’s not hungry...
---
This wasn't a mistake, they made it this shit on purpose.
---
It's not nothing when they introduce a stat bonus that you can buy. I don't care how small said bonus is.
---
The ultimate eye opener concerning Bethesda is installing the mod Enderal over top of Skyrim. That something made in some peoples' free time for free is that much better than Skyrim makes it clear that Bethesda has completely lost their way. 
---
It will be available on steam probably within the next month. Bethesda has got to be incredibly embarrassed. 
---
&gt;if you dope up on furry 
---
OwO Tell me more, senpai
---
I didn’t say nerf is necessary. Again proof that You didn’t read my posts. Please reread them.
---
Yay! A serious nerf for TSE. Now I can go back to getting my dick kicked in by all enemies again. The stress is real.
---
Anybody seen any brown bags. I need some caps. lol
---
&gt; They are just currently figuring out a number that they're comfortable with such that servers won't be affected negatively. 
---
They seemed to do just fine with the hyper-overencumbered dupers. They seem to be able to store 1000's and 1000's of items without real issue to the servers. What is an extra, say 400 lbs, to the legitimate players really going to cause? They have already implanted a 1500 lb over total-encumberance to help bleed the dupers inventory. They were sure able to give us 200 lbs within the first 3 weeks. 
---
No.
---
This needs to be the necks bug they fix.
---
Well there is a Armor Piercing Legendary effect then there is also Armor Piercing qualities for magazines. Couple them together and you are pretty much negating any and all armor you come across making a sneak attack build do significant damage with each shot.
---
as much as i'd like to see this game turn around and succeed, i think i agree. i'm still having fun with it, still playing. for a lot of people though, shit like this has shaken their already frail and fleeting faith in Bethesda and, at the end of the day, without players, this game will not stay alive. Games as a service works when you have a constant stream of revenue from new players, dlc and microtransactions. they plan on relying on these things. they want this game to last "forever." in no way is that possible with the mistakes and scrutiny that continue to barrage this project. it seems like Bethesda already has trouble putting time and resources into this project that is supposedly important to them, and I don't see them throwing their soul into it once the die-hard core base starts dropping like flies. since the beginning they have been under a microscope with this project. they know that even a slight misstep throws everything in a spiral, spewing out bad press left and right that continues to wear down on current and potential future players. I'd say content and transparency need to come quick, but again, I agree with you - it might be too late. they've already been caught lying about transparency with patch notes, and continue to mislead us. things like the increase of prices of plans are *huge.* that wasn't a mistake that was left out, it was intentional. we've been getting patch notes, followed by edits to those notes. they had said before that patch notes were going to be coming in advance of patches and maintenance via the Inside the Vault blog. we are still getting them same day, and still not as detailed as they promise they will be.
---
im not gonna do a dramatic rage quit and write a cringe letter on here (super popular for some reason?). im still playing and having fun. but for the first time, I'm pretty concerned about this game's future. even with all of the issues and negativity in the beginning, I was confident that they could pull through; the concept and potential of this game is *huge.* that doesn't mean much if you do everything wrong along the way. at almost a quarter year after release, it's looking bleak for the short term. I don't think we can rule out a no man's sky or FF yet though. both had extended periods of time that allowed them to realize those games' potentials and do them right, or at least better. The same goes for ESO. perception of this game dramatically shifted once they got their shit together and basically rereleased a year later. As others have suggested, I'd even appreciate if they shut down servers for an extended period of time if it meant they could fix this game's deep seeded issues.
---
i guess we'll see.
---
Wow! Insane how crazy that sounds these days 
---
WTF is with people repeating this bizarre lie that this sub doesn't take Bethesda to task for its issues? The only reason it seems that way is because this sub isn't full of berserk psychopaths who act like Bethesda is running The Holocaust: Part 2 like /r/fallout does. 
---
When Bethesda doesn't comment on issues, what would you have /r/fo76 do to "get behind" making Bethesda answer for their issues? And if /r/fallout is so much better, why haven't they ever successfully "gotten behind" something to make Bethesda answer on that sub?
---
Regression testing is for losers!
---
I didn’t say the nerf is necessary either. 
---
Except... Fallout 76 has no need for that. Fallout 76 isn't an MMO with a monthly subscription, or a freemium game. If half the playerbase left the game tomorrow, it wouldn't change anything about this game, except maybe to reduce the server load and reduce the number of instances required to house the players. People bought the game already, and they will play it if they get enjoyment out of it, or stop if they don't.
---
In addition, reducing the grind would make it far more of an option to start new characters. Playing through with a different build and a new playstyle. Experience the world in a new way. Or if a friend decides to start playing, you could more easily start a new character to play with them without feeling like you were losing or wasting hundreds of hours of work. With daily quests and random events, there's plenty of reason to keep coming back for more.
---
Some grind is unavoidable, and I'm not saying every bit of it should be removed, but there's too much right now. There's a point where we move beyond player retention and step into "Pride And Accomplishment" and Fallout 76 crossed that line a few blocks back.
---
I don’t know man I just pulled the trigger
---
aaaaand mods deleted the post.
---
I was planning to get this game today :(((
---
Is it still worth it? I'm not a hardcore player tho
---
That's like executing someone for robbery because they looked funny at your stuff.
---
Eso was a buggy mess 2 years in. Couldnt do dungeons because it would remove you from group upon entering, ect.....bethesda does not believe in QC. I dont think they ever released a game that wasnt riddled with bugs for months/years. The only reason people keep buying thier games is because the 3 franchises they have do a great job being something you cant get anywhere else. So people buy them, bitch for months /years and the cycle continues. Its insane. But it happens. 
---
My bad typo. I didn’t say the nerf is unnecessary. 
---
Way to discredit those who didn't buy or trade for duped weapons.
---
Yup, vendorbot Greg has them
---
insert bot comment 
---
Could not agree more. I think the furious effect is bugged, but I have no clue how Bethesda intended it to work. 
---
I'm working with stealth and the syringer at lvl 20 now. It takes patience and damn do you pay for your mistakes, but I was able to clear Harper's of lvl 40 mutants last night.
---
Winning an engagement without one-shotting  every enemy is challenging, and challenging is what the later levels in a game should be. 
---
As far as realism, whether your .308 should penetrate a super mutants skull. Well, we're already swallowing a pretty big pill with this universe full of robots and monsters, yes?
---
Ask your sniper character: would she give up, surrender to the new challenge or rise, adapt and execute?
---
We be prepared to be infuriated at the community because no one see's this as a big issue ITT...
---
I loved it at launch but I haven’t played it properly since around Christmas time.
---
It’s to buggy, all weapons felt useless and there’s honestly a sever lack of content.
---
The exploration is fantastic as is the lore but the sheer lack of actual quests and side content is appallingly bad.
---
Really wish it was possible to get a refund with how badly they fucked this up.
---
I won’t support them ever again after this.
---
Well they broke everything with this unwanted patch so I wouldn't count on March for new content. 
---
The fact that you say the engine is over a decade old shows this IS  just a dev bash. It's using an upgrade version of the skyrim engine with Quake netcode. 
---
I don't see how it makes it easier to look at. You're just doubling the amount of crap you have to sort through befasste now you've got the bulked scrap And leftover loose scrap in your inventory. 
---
Not yet, but it always starts like this. Just a little boost... Then it will be +15% xp, dmg, dmg mitigation... I think we have to prevent that now. But I see your point, it just feels we've been lied to.... 
---
I had the opposite happen thanks to the rad worms glitch. I'm hitting even harder this patch!
---
I never heard anyone complain about nerfing weapons in Fallout 4.
---
PvP is the problem.
---
from a pve perspective, yes. generally you play skinner box simulators to be as strong as possible.
---
How about 300 caps on PC?
---
Game went off the deep end my friend, i've defended this trash in so many threads. My game is so broken, i have it on in front of me and the quest markers are broken, im permanently invisible, it crashes 3 times when i was starting it up and when it put me in a world i was frozenin place and could only pull my weapon out and put it away. You call that a delusion? 
---
Just fuck this game off guys. Stop giving them chances. Let it die, Bethesda have screwed up. Or have they? Do they actually care at this point. The games an absolute failure.
---
I'm sorry for your lost chop.
---
R.I.P my dear Radium Rifle.
---
&gt;  It feels like everything nerfed is being done to because...
---
... people on reddit repeatedly complained about the way it was.
---
You shame yourself
---
reddit is kinda known for censorship though
---
Everyone that disagrees with me is a bigot!
---
Do the math... 
---
Absolutely. Shit if they keep breaking the game over and over again then I don't expect new content by next May
---
Mods?
---
Oh, okay then, definitely not a dork.Yeah.
---
There's actually a funny video of a guy taking 1000 bobbleheads and his 2se handmade is at 40k per shot and the queen takes 2 hits, regens , then takes 3 more hits before she dies. 
---
Yeah, that first kill, advantage goes to melee. Now turn it into an extended pvp grudge match. Come back seeking revenge, headshot him before he knows where you are. He comes back, headshot him again while he tries to get into range. He comes back again, headshot him while he tries to get into range. He comes back again, headshot him while he tries to get into range. SO MUCH FUN FOR THE OP MELEE GUY!
---
Okay like damage control? Before it goes too far. I can see that. Nipping it in the bud before it’s an actual problem. I see now
---
It had never entered my mind until I read your post that Bethesda might gate mods behind atom shop atoms, but now that I've read it I am absolutely certain that is our future.
---
Mother fucker do you think they have devs working around the clock on old Fallout 4 assets and reskins? The reason there is a steady stream of shit added to the atom shop is because 99% of that shit already exists and takes zero additional effort to maintain. 
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
There have been days where I triple load, but mostly just when I’m super bored 
---
I'll probably just get down-voted but this last patch has saved me some time while i'm out there in the map discovering. The tag on recipes/plans should have been there since launch. I now save on caps at vendors cause i know which ones i need. I am still low level (60) and still do not have any of the weapons that got nerf'd so that didn't affect my play at all. Bobby pins I only carry a handful already so didn't really noticed when they lowered the weight nor this time when they rolled back to the original weight. I only rebooted once last night in the 4 hrs i usually play, pre-patch it was 3-4 times sometimes more some nights. The perks that I have active seem to still work the same way as well. I just hope that they are the path of correcting all the exploits.
---
The TSE weapons could do a pretty staggering aamount of damage with the right perks applied. I'd have loved to have one. I had a 2 shot dbl barrel and even then I wanted it to be stronger. I'd love to be able to take out sbs with a few shots, lvl 68 super mutant crowds no problem and mobs of glowing ones easy. Now as solo I'm gonna have to go back to where I was with this nonsense even if I somehow got a tse weapon. I think had the duping not occurred allowing these weapons to become a dime a dozen proverbially speaking there wouldn't have been as many complaints about the pvp aspect.
---
 touché 
---
"can" it be done, sure... should it be done, not if they want it to work...
---
Don’t be stupid. Just because a problem hasn’t been fixed doesn’t mean they aren’t aware of it. You can complain it hasn’t been fixed fast enough, but the idea that they aren’t aware of some of the problems we’ve been complaining about flies in the face of the fact that many of the problems we’ve been complaining about HAVE been fixed.
---
Events mostly. Especially ones with ghouls or supermutants. 
---
So many armchair developers, I am SHOCKED that Bethesda isn't offering jobs to all the experts on this sub.
---
Can you make those three serums (Bird Bones, Healing Factor &amp; Speed Demon) for me too for 200 caps each?
---
Changing them to be all the same would be a rebalance, regardless if you meant it as one or not.
---
Explosives builds are fun if you build it right and play it properly. Just keep passive mode on....
---
No, you cannot. I have the bug-  I'm not reading other people reports and acting as if I know but it behaves; nor an I assuming I know all the variations of  the big affects the bug has on the game. Don't speak as if you know, when clearly, you do not.
---
While i smiled at your comment cuz its funny. This has got to be one if the saddest comments i have ever read. 
---
So if you treat someone like crap, call them names, say they should be fired, die, whatever. Its that persons fault for being sensitive that he left the room. 
---
You just said everyone should be fine with toxic environments and should learn to deal with it. I hope you dont have kids. Cuz they are gonna be fuuuuuuuuuucked up!
---
Thanks a lot for your help!!
---
Well luckily you can just break it down again if you need it. It’s a minor inconvenience and the trade off is you can’t accidentally scrap your mods. 
---
Other developers: „we pay to have beta testers“
---
Bethesda: „people pay us to test and mod our game“
---
Events don't work. AWOL armaments doesn't start an swarm of suitors still gives 0 rewards.
---
Make them weigh nothing at all
---
And also make the Tricent Hatchet paint weigh nothing too, because why exactly does *paint* increase the weight of the hatchet by .15 pounds? Sure, it's absolutely minimal, but c'mon!
---
&gt; Garb of Mystery
---
I didn't realize Garb of Mystery stacked with power armor. I had thought all non PA armor was removed once inside PA.
---
Yeah exactly. Like we did with the lunchboxes that have been in the code since like 2-3 patches ago. But since the community discovered it and made it really clear that they don't want them, they are too scared to release them now (IMO). Hopefully, this will be the same. 
---
My first login today after the patch had me stuck in chameleon mode for two hours with 0 stealth working
---
It's not about the tses it's about the perks that were nerfed for no reason 
---
&gt; But learning now that I'm going to have to find 30 lbs of stash/carry space just to deal with a bobby pin bug that had already been fixed broke me.
---
Do you have some kind of hand tremor?  Why do you need 300 bobby pins?
---
The live game is the BETA. The simple fact that 3 months after release and there are numerous dupe bugs, QoL bugs, and gameplay imbalances it's obvious their internal testing was only limited to testing game-breaking bugs and not the actual game itself. What better way to BETA test than to just release a barely-working game and have your customer base find the bugs? By the time all the bugs are worked out, you'll be able to apply that information onto the next iteration of the game and you're all set! Free R&amp;D and beta testing!
---
I think we play and feel similarly, you just may be a little more compassionate and understanding than i am of the situation. Griefers are annoying, but no one is taking out the MKII Oppressor from GTA, and i dont think they should have removed/changed half of what they did. Minus some minor bugs and stability issues (way more minor without the helmet), I really enjoyed how my game was going. Im a helpful player, always handing out free goodies and showing the way, but i generally like to play alone also. 
---
I got into a heated battle with someone over a workshop, one shotting me with his TSE, it pissed me off. But he took my workshop and all my caps but i initiated the fight. It pissed me off. Oh well for me. 
---
I hate that the game kinda centers around The Whitespring, but it is what it is. That being said, i hate the people with TSEs one shotting all the mobs. Oh well for me. I wouldnt play in that manner, but some do. And now no one can. And i dont think thats fair to anyone. 
---
ANY perks being changed is absurd. For those who have actually acquired them and built around those perks, i dont think this change was appropriate. For those who havent, i dont think this change was appropriate. Took 3 months to decide something was overperforming? I think they need to get some in-house game testers to do nothing but sit there and play the game.
---
Just, something isnt right. And even though i made this post during the update, and got backlash for it, it seems alot of this sub is feeling the same way, just without the backlash.
---
Thanks! I finally got adrenal serum and a bloodied sledge the past few days myself, but I'm not really built for them. I've been running a heavy guns-leaning build, but not maxed, more general purpose. I guess I need to investigate some of these max builds more.
---
As long as you don't pay full price and get it on sale for at least 40% of the original price then it's kinda worth it. This game is still not release ready though. 
---
Lol.  Problem is you are just complaining.  My guess is you are still playing the game.  Hell, you are actively contributing to making the game better and the community.
---
Do you really think they care?
---
"Hey our fans think someone else should be in charge."
---
"But we both made millions of dollars this year."
---
"I know, hilarious right."
---
It isn’t about nerf or buff, they just need to do it intelligently. What they’ve done so far is blind and shortsighted. Even I called how they’d F it up, and I’m not even a game developer. I just have played a ton of games that have gone through balance phases.
---
Zenimax did **Not** design the engine for ESO. EsO runs on a **modified** Havok engine Zenimax bought the licence to use and modify. Something tells me you have never actually played ESO (but I have¹) and let me tell you although on the face of it, eso looks like a shooter it really isn’t. It’s an ability based mmorpg with minimal shooting elements, it would be like play FO76 but without automatic weapons and capping RPM of all weapons to 60 or less. 
---
¹for at least 4000 hours, I’m level 50 758cp Argonian for life, 9/9 trait masters crafter (inc JC) and own apprentice/warrior Mundas stones. 
---
Cap stashes are items that are found in the world that when you pick it up it disappears and you get an amount of caps, similar to a bobby pin box. Cap Collector increases the amount that you get when you pick them up, it doesn't allow you to search containers for more (unlike Scrounger and Pharma Farma).
---
People who work in IT spend time on Internet forum, very suspicious indeed. Good work Watson! 
---
Do you want "Boaty McBoatFace"?
---
Because player voting is how you will get "Boaty McBoatFace" in this game, and other memes and garbage
---
It was abnormally strong compared to everything else. Being able to one shot everything but the SB Queen at range, without stealth, without buffs is not ok. Woth a garbage build at that. And it's shit for everyone else around who wants to get in on it. Going to a ghoul zone and trying to farm, but being unable to bc some guy is spraying a tse at everything that moves is bad for the game. It promotes solo play which was very clearly against the vision Bethesda had for the game, and discourages other players from wanting to do anything besides use the cancer weapons. This nerf should not have come as a surprise to anyone.
---
And their power wouldn't change? I seen maybe three people with auto grenade launchers, none with any other launcher. So your fun stays the same while everything else is in the same line. 
---
They were nerfed for balance reasons, just because you're of the opinion that they shouldn't have been doesn't mean there was no reason.
---
What's the bar?
---
I did a scorch horde even last night, killed 6 scorched I'm the galleria in the mire but died as I killed the last one. When I went back in the building there was only 3 meatnpiles and none had my legendary loot from.the 3* I killed. It's very fucking common at this point
---
This was just a few days ago, and I'm only level 30ish. Just going to the Watoga Station, where I eventually found them, was a harrowing trek for me. But worth it for the kickass brick house I built.
---
Read stuff before posting like you know the f’n answer.  
---
Unsure whether I’m being dense or not....
---
When junk items have been bulked, they’re not showing up as usable when crafting.
---
Is that a bug or has that always been the case?
---
online-only MP games where modders can't clean up bethesda's messes are a different beast from single player games with limited post-launch support.
---
like yeah, i know their track record. but the nature of *this* game demands a little more from the dev team over the full lifespan of the game. it's not unreasonable to expect them to be able to handle their shit.
---
I logged in for this patch, and was immediately disgusted. 
---
Instead of playing Fallout 76 I stood around the enclave bunker playing Grognak &amp; Ruby Ruins on my pipboy. I had a lot more fun doing that than anything else in this patch.
---
Weird grognak and silver shroud work fine as costumes over underarmor.
---
So by your logic people who stay silent are somehow at fault.  Nice, explains lots about the world we live in.
---
yup not to happy myself but hey my two shot combat shot gun is still effective but takes way more shots to kill stuff. My Bloodied Explosive Black Powder pistol is not very good now. Its sad, was doing 1k dmg now like 350 unfortunately. 
---
No ingame mods.
---
oh you mean you're just playing the video game? well that's a new and fascinating concept!
---
No, it hasn't. People are just freaking the fuck out because their TSE weapons are only really good instead of godly and their armor takes one extra ballistic fiber to repair. I'm not even fucking joking, those are literally the worst things the patch did and people are acting like Bethesda just murdered their dog. 
---
I did whitespring and the ghouls never spawned at all. 20 people came by. Stood there for abiut 45 minutes messing around on my phone and finally just left and logged out. Left a sour taste in my mouth. Getting hard to keep defending this game. 
---
Standard instabil memory problem.
---
Aida is nowhere near to be a good memory stability tester. You can go with D.OC.P settings+ ram @2933MHz. 
---
At [overclock.net](https://overclock.net), there are multiple Ryzen memory OC topic, the guys there should be able to help.
---
SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS 
---
650 hours since it was released? Is this your job? Did I math wrong or are you pulling 8 hour shifts? I thought my 4-5 hours in a sitting was overboard
---
they are also flying fucks
---
Doesn’t sound like an addiction especially since those are getting shown since the patch now.
---
Did you check to make sure the perk cards for damage didn’t fall off accidentally? That is a huge amount of damage to have disappear.
---
Yeah, talked with a guy who worked on a big MMO and he told me it was always a little harrowing to do work on the build going to live. As even a small mistake could break the build, as such they'd rigorously check every change. And mistakes were a really big deal as it was a live service.
---
What puzzles me the most is that Fo76 hasn't been rolled back to a previous build and how slowly hotfixes come out. I do get the feeling that the studio is a bit in over their head with this project.
---
You can get the Mistress of Mysteries dress FREE ingame.  Stop whining about Pay-To-Win.
---
You announce it, set a patch date and make it so all existing TSE weapons at that patch get one of the 2 perks and random roll another.  Not hard at all.  Real money trading for them was against the terms of use so anyone that did it for one and gets a crappy roll gets a lesson.
---
Hell they could even do it by weapon type so rifles can only roll TS and automatics roll Explosive (while making explosive cause the direct impact target to take 70-90% bullet dmg but aoe to do 110-130% as otherwise the 2 are virtually the same perk).
---
Oh yeah, I guess it was a bad suggestion.
---
So what happens when you try to scrap bulked mats?
---
I'm onboard with this
---
I can't even log in to the game. I crash at the main screen trying to join server. 
---
Get the countdown, then CTD. Happened 3x in a row. 
---
That's part of what convinced me to make this post. I haven't used any TSE weapons, and I never got around to trying a Missile or Fat Man build, but I also didn't feel like my experience was all that bad just because some other people found weapons they could have fun with.
---
The perk change in particular struck a nerve with me. 9 perk points spent on rifles for +60% damage, leaving not enough perception for Sniper, Tank Killer, Long Shot, and/or Concentrated Fire. It's an expenditure of 3/5 of your potential perks within a single stat (requiring an all-in maximization of that stat too) for only 60% damage increase... Yet at the same time it's basically required in order for your weapons to even have a chance at keeping up with damage. And now Explosives has been lowered down to that level?
---
I would have much preferred if it had gone the other way. Make Rifleman, Gunslinger, Gladiator etc. into 5-level perk cards that increase damage 20%/40%/60%/80%/100%. Bring up the damage that those weapons can do while also allowing for more versatile and creative builds.
---
TSE weapons were everywhere because they were viewed as necessary in order to get ahead of the grind. If the sharp difference between them and every other weapon is such a problem, then maybe there's a deeper issue responsible. Treating symptoms isn't going to fix anything.
---
Kid I acknowledged that I read it wrong that saw it as I saw it but didn’t pay attention to the explosives part I read it as all if you don’t have anything to add go cry in the corner like you know the fk’n corner lol
---
Isn't that exactly the point OP is making?  He's not attacking the community managers.
---
Thanks I'll take a look.
---
I spent a while last night going through my perk cards and whilst there are some great perks I would love to use - more often than not I cannot justify swapping out because of the impact it would have on my available carry weight or durability (or both).  Its a shame and I do not necessary point my finger at the perk system - but more other design choices.
---
I would love it if some of these weight perks were just made passive for all - but I realise its not that simple as this will have a knock-on affect.
---
Returning to the point at hand though, the ability to break up perk cards, return cards for some form of refund (with limitations), and a complete respec (again with limitations) should exist.
---
Agreed. People did not choose White Knight because "it was so good that it was mandatory". People chose White Knight because base armor durability is so poor that  if they wanted to use in-game time doing ANYTHING besides grinding armor repair mats, White Knight was mandatory.
---
Raising base armor durability will have the effect of White Knight being less needed. BTW, I read thus sub daily, &amp; don't recall seeing ubiquitous posts from players bitching that their armor was "too durable". *shrug*
---
&gt; This is the first stat bonus available to buy in the atom shop. Is that not concerning? 
---
Let's not overstate the issue. This is what I meant about fear mongering.
---
Let's clear things up here:
---
* The bonus isn't on the purchased item. 
---
* The bonus is only available when you meet a certain condition within the temporary event window (until Feb 4th)
---
* The bonus requires you to be in a team, with each member wearing a **unique** Unstoppable outfits
---
   * That means 2 people can't wear the same outfit, otherwise no bonus.
---
* The bonus is pretty modest. At most it's +45 health.
---
All Bethesda is doing is encouraging people to run around in a team cosplaying the Unstoppables. That's it. The bonus is modest. The bonus is temporary. The bonus isn't attached to the item so when the event ends, so does the bonus.
---
If anything, this should be seen as kind of adorable or cute, rather than "OOO! BE SCARED! PAY TO WIN RARGH!".
---
If this bonus was attached to the Atom Store items permanently, then yeah, let's have a discussion. Til then, calm down.
---
/r/fallout has basically became /r/NoMutantsAllowed
---
Yup, I suggested the very same thing a few hours ago. It is a good idea and a much needed one.  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaj4x/suggestion\_test\_servers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alaj4x/suggestion_test_servers/)
---
I think the reason is because it wasn't just nerfed it was absolutely annilihated, with no thought as to how this would effect players.
---
 I'm a sniper shotgun build and I've lost 75% of my overall damage now!! So I've got to rebuild my character but at level 150, how am I meant to gain these levels to rebuild? How am I meant to enjoy the game when I all my time has been wasted. The reason for such an outcry is because of the degree they have nerfed. I've went from 850 damage on my TSE lever down to 217!! How is that viable against a SBQ!? 
---
 I've left Appalachia and doubt I'll return as the hours I've put in have been stripped away from me. Each patch is more detrimental than beneficial.
---
U/Bethesdagamestudios
---
m8 if the subreddit is so full of posts about this that the mods censor said posts, and the sales numbers are in the tubes already.... its not really reasonable to go "oh no everything is fine nobody has stopped playing" its pretty clear theres an issue &amp; people are getting tired of waiting for next weeks screwup. I dont think anybody in their right mind would think this game has had a smooth launch, every week there was another 'scandal'... from false advertisement to the game itself &amp; crappy managing from beth.
---
Which is also arguably one of the best mobile games out there
---
Having a similar issue, which files did you have to delete to fix this? Thank you 🙏 
---
In my opinion the big issue is that equipment breaks ridiculously too fast. I understand the nerf to perk because it is never good to HAVE to have certain perks to play the game, so that makes sense. But the problem is they solved a issue but made the underlying bigger issue worse.
---
You're wasting your breath. Idiots like this think Bethesda has an entire team of programmers working around the clock recreating Fallout 4 assets and weapon reskins from scratch instead of fixing the game. 
---
Good news! You're already in the beta server!
---
Good to know 
---
On PS4 had “caution” the whole walk from westek to harpers ferry last night. Perk cards n regen armor were not working which is maddening cuz my build is now perk cards n mutations for health. I sever hopped n it fixed the “caution” chasing me everywhere. But the lag for these cards n armor to have effect “while not in combat” is just redick when phantoms can chase you across the map. I was very happy with the progress the of the updates n optimistic about the future. But between the seemingly constant push for this game to be another fortnite/PUB clone with fallout skin n now the generally disregard for quality control yet again just seems like Bethesda couldn’t care less about its customers. 
---
Fo76 is not Fo4. It is not a PvE only focused game and never will be, the sooner everyone accepts that the better.
---
I still one-shot most stuff with my TSE so I think it's a good nerf, can still one-shot trash but some enemies are actually challenging. This is the way it should be
---
Metoo lets go. Im tired of farming ballsitic fiber to fix armor that breaks to often
---
damn guess im just gonna have to keep going back over and over
---
I never once said the game wasn't broken. The delusion comes from milquetoast redditors thinking they know the best decisions for a team of game developers as if they know anything at all about development or the inner workings of a company.
---
I'll head there once i'm done with Kingdom Hearts 3
---
I dont know about you but i would want to beat up all the presidents as ghouls
---
This is the game as was intended. A survival game, not a power fantasy
---
Don't worry this is the shill/fanboi echochamber you are looking for. They have it locked down pretty tightly, and are only losing slight control of it at the moment. Things will go back to "normal" once the dust settles.
---
Do you seriously expect them to rebalance the whole game (including armor, enemies, workshop item durability, ...) to match TSE?
---
Now they will se only melee overpowered and bang, another nerf on its way :D :D seriously melee is not op, yeah you can kill enemies with one or two hits, but problem is you have to take hits too because you need to be right next to your enemy, also try to hit scorchbeast with super sledge when they are flying above you and still screaming attacks. I don't think its wrong, scorchbeasts are ok, except that visual blindness caused by their attacks, or maybe that enemy hard hit which makes you unable to attack for second or two, also melee is ok.  
---
Problem there is some legendary effects are less viable then others, for example that TSE, it is (or was) more viable then others because others are only useable at set conditions and have less damage, something like unyelding armor for melee, when conditions are met, you kill anything, maybe even scorchbeast, but still it's balanced, you need to have only classic armor, all 5 unyelding and be at low hp, so you trade survivability for power.  
---
As for weapon legendary effects, they need massive balance changes, maybe keep tse at it is after patch but still those 30% or how much plus to robots needs to be powered up, also others...  
---
As for enemies, yes they need changes but not in power or durability, that is ok, they need to be greater threat, give them special abilities, special tactics and it may be ok, but still you have to want to fight them in first place.  
---
I see bethesda as djinn, you get what you asked for, but not what you wished for (like in X-Files).
---
My impression from the doc and Todd's interviews is that most if not all of the Maryland studio was working on 76. I'm not sure there is significant evidence to the contrary.
---
I wonder if this is what the one dev working on FO76 thought after reading the feedback on his latest patch?
---
Thank you
---
When I logged in last night, the Early Warnings quest had advanced from "craft upgraded motors 0/5" to "select Motors Upgraded from Abbie's terminal." I was able to progress the quest and have finally moved to the next.
---
I appreciate the fix, really. But from a customer perspective, the ticket was open for nearly three weeks with no real response, which is frustrating. I realize that you personally aren't responsible for making sure tickets get worked, but if you could pass along the feedback, I'd appreciate it. Since tickets are the only way we have to "officially" communicate about issues, it's disheartening when we do that, only to be ignored.
---
Thank you! 
---
I found the actual enemies to be a bit too spongy, though I mainly fought them when around lvl 40-50. I remember one where I went through all my ammo and finished it off by punching the core. Granted, ammo woes are the life of a demo/heavy weapons character.
---
It’s just the nature of it. Some players don’t post till something moves them to do it. Just means we see a storm of them for the short term. May also have a lot more unreasonable screaming when people start posting about the next ridiculous thing that becomes popular. And there will be, this game is a balance nightmare.
---
I had this several times in the last week, before the patch. Dozens of 1\* legendaries in each run.
---
&gt; I repair my weapons once every 4 days
---
You clearly don't have a lever action rifle or even play anything remotely difficult. One fight with a couple of SB, a mirelurk queen and a few other random mobs yesterday (15-20 minutes of shooting) and I had a completely broken weapon. Keep in mind that was with ultracite ammo and lvl 5 gunsmith.
---
&gt; What puzzles me the most is that Fo76 hasn't been rolled back to a previous build and how slowly hotfixes come out.
---
I'm going to chalk this one up to them not having creative control of the distribution platform (ie. They can't just blast out whatever they want on the console ecosystems).
---
You'll still be trading, not everyone has 9k+caps to toss around for plans. You can still larp all you want as a trader for people.
---
Looks like that's exactly what I'm looking for, thank you!

Well it seems you're the one of the only ones finding this funny. I actually find it kind of funny what you're saying about people being on a subreddit for a game and talking about how they can make it better, it's interesting how protective you are of something you didn't really have any part in creating. Fanboyism is one of the worst things about gaming, people like you refuse to acknowledge problems amd are a hindrance to the game getting any better.. 
---
Wrong!! They were nerfed as an easy option to silence people who couldn't handle PvP. It wouldn't have been better to balance all weapons but instead they dropped damage of TSEs by 75% so now the majority of people's build are ineffecient with no way to cha ge this as we have no rebuild options.
---
 I'm not grind at level 150 to gain enough levels to arrange my perk cards because of this oversight of Bethesdas. If I did do this, guaranteed as I changed to a melee build, that would be nerfed also.
---
 Not to mention it rolled back a bunch of exploits, including duping so now all server stability is gone too.
---
 Great work u/bethesdagamestudios.
---
For me deactivating savemystuff, perkloadoutmanager and showhealth fixed it.  I don't know if there are already updated version ready to download.
---
Sod off tactics is a great game.
---
I love both FO76 and 4, but what is ironic is when I played FO4 I thought it had too much micro management and chores. Now I'm like- "Damn, FO4 was sooooo easy."
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Im so happy I decided to not buy this game when it came out.
---
I am proposing that we move heavy weapons cards to Endurance as well as adding the bonus damage from the stat of endurance.  I chose endurance for two reasons, first is balance.  I think the strength stat would be too powerful if it increased the damage for 3 weapon types.  The second reason is I think carrying a heavy weapon around all day would toll on your endurance. 
---
I dont think anyone was ever supposed to make 850 damage on his own. Bethesda didnt balance around these numbers.
---
The friend-game is the end-game. Where have I heard that old trope before? (Ahem, Bungie)
---
&gt;it promotes solo play which was very clearly against the vision Bethesda had for the game
---
the vision Bethesda had was for the players to shape the game. and it shows considering 99% of the content is solo-oriented or at the very least not locked behind parties.
---
and I don't see you complaining about bloodied builds. they can still "spray a bloodied explosive at everything that moves" since bloodied is essentially ts pre-nerf. or melee which can output 50K damage per swing when properly optimized. or sentinel/cavalier armor which makes glasscanons not so glassy.
---
Just goes to show how much of a crutch TSE was - people can't aim for shit anymore, don't know how to sneak, don't know the value of headshots or aiming.
---
NMS fixed itself with free updates and only improvements.  Yeah it was joke but it did salvage itself. The others not so much
---
Great observations. I’ll continue to look for my first TSE.
---
Bulk items aren't registering as scrap. Have to scrap bulk first until they fix it
---
Noted. And thanks for putting up with my interrogation :)
---
Not quite all the mods. I've yet to find any Recon Sensors for the helmets. Are they even in the game?
---
PC - 
---
2700x, gtx 1080, 16gb, SSD, Win10 latest 
---
Still get freezing for minutes at a time in certain areas, namely Poisiden energy (&lt;-spelling?) only fix is to change cpu affinity. 
---
New bug since patch, cannot run76 from the Bethesda launcher have to use the Fallout76.exe or I get an error suggesting file validation which doesn’t help.
---
Tried full reinstall including the launcher also no help.
---
You don’t agree that it’s over powered?
---
just read like 10 similar topics below...
---
All of your tantrums about TSE's are golden, keep them up. getting laugh after laugh after laugh.
---
Start a new character, clearly at level 150 you already play the game like it's a full time job.
---
It's not that you are wrong, it's just that... Well atomic shop is garbage, so i don't use it, or at the very least only with the atoms i win ingame, otherwise i dont care. Kinda like the no preorders rule, just have to be patient and not fill every emotional hole with purchase. Its simple: a game is not worth my money, i don't buy, seems simple enough but people keeps forgetting. I enjoyed 76 it was worth my money, now i just wait for additional content while playing other things.
---
The games fucking broken and a mess, what planet are you guys on? 
---
Great that’s what I assumed. Wanted clarification as I know things can be wonky with what is classified as what.
---
For me, it just isn't the same. 
---
You have always had to have your junk loose to use it for crafting stuff, bulk is just for selling
---
So how can a melee weapon do 1000+? If 8 players tackle a SBQ with over 45000 hp doing 200 damage a strike, no one could do it? It would be damn near impossible. They have broken it, pure and simple. 
---
I am by no means an apologist but from a Dev perspective it really seems like what they have done is try to fundamentally change the architecture of an application without rewriting the application. And when you have a massive codebase this is literally an impossible task to accomplish
---
Oh, they addressed this, at least in part, by making the prices for the previously rare plans ridiculously high.
---
So then it's a good thing they create a separate PvP Mode. Deny all legendary effects in this mode and let the PvE Players have fun^^
---
&lt;3 this and I love you!
---
Chores and Grinding. If it wasn't for my friends I would quit :(
---
What wacky, screwed up build of the game did Bethesda release on us? I was only joking about the “stealth nerf” yesterday and now it turns out there’s a real one? Anybody got a video?
---
Also having a really hard time staying undetected. 
---
And yet other game companies are more competent about it for their games 
---
.... doom was developed by Id. BGS Austin helped with some post release multiplayer for Doom 2016, and that’s all.
---
&gt;  explanation for why so many apparent old bugs resurfaced
---
AFAIK *one* old bug resurfaced -- the bobby ping weight.  Am I missing something?
---
Well, there's also the double loading screen thing getting less common, but frankly that seems more like a bug *fix*.
---
Yeah, like you say, if it's not that, then it must be having some setting in your character inventory to put things up for sale, basically a predefined list that shows up when players trade with you.
---
I’ve had the same with ammo and armour repairs, I’ve noticed it happens when one of the items required is literally the exact amount (10/10 steel) 
---
How to make sure this doesn't happen again:
---
1. Make a list of every bug or issue that has been fixed or modified since beta.   
---
2. Take your QA team and assign each person a section of that list.   
---
3. Have each person check the modifications on their list. ex: okay, I have opened my inventory, bobby pins weigh more again, that's an X on my checklist instead of a check".   
---
4. Go over all of the checklists, move those workqueues to a different QA person to re-check.   
---
5. Go over any things that are still not working.  
---
6. If everything is all clear, push the patch to your QA team. Have them check it again.   
---
7. If everything is all clear, push to users.  
---
Note, this doesn't prevent new bugs, there are teams for that too, this just prevents version problems and highlights errors that have already been fixed. 
---
I totally understand. I did Uranium Fever  3 times by myself last night and no one was around. I'm not enjoying this game as much anymore. 
---
Server hopping sucked bad. Where Bethesda fucked up is with making them all available at vendors. They should have made it easier through missions and mobs to get plans so server hopping wasn't required. The game should also check if you have the plan so you're not constantly getting dupe plans/recipes. 
---
I had to try that mission like 5 times because it was glitched and kept resting the bottle count. 
---
To me what it shows is a development team that is out of touch with the game and a lack of creativity. It seems like the focus is on extending the grind.
---
Some of the Atom Shop stuff is way off point, I'll concede. I'm not trying to be argumentative or anything, just pointing out that all the Americana stuff is the equiv of Egyptian mythology in the later-on Fallout universe. The flag is kind of cool to hang up. The armor skins and stuff are way over the top and not cool or practical in any way. 
---
Fallout 76 should of just been Borderlands 2... ***except Fallout.***
---
Yea... and you can't get the bonus without someone else on your team wearing a different outfit. That someone has to buy.
---
I played yesterday. I had two issues when I first logged in. Going to the Pipboy caused the screen to freeze and the radar stayed on (caution). Both issues went away. 
---
After that I played for hours. I know those issues will get fixed and they had very little effect on enjoying the game. Shit happens and it wasn’t that bad.
---
who knows? they have problems with the patches that repeat the previous errors, but if they have to add any object in the store, everything goes perfectl 
---
And while you’re at it make it so all the consoles are usable and not some ghosts keeping it busy
---
I can agree with this.
---
I decided to just finish up the platinum and move on, i can tell after 3/4 months that this isn't going to get better for a while, if at all. 
---
Will do :)
---
Well once (if) we get our vendor bots, people will flock to you to purchase your crafted goods :)
---
I don't have near enough caps to buy the really good stuff. I still have to grind and put the time in to find the stuff or the caps. It's definitely a stoopid patch this time but it doesn't have to be a deal breaker
---
Apples to oranges man.  I agree its a small boost.   And i agree it shouldn’t be available.  
---
This could be just BES treading the water to see our reactions on this.  And who knows, they could try to push more and more small P2W aspect and before we know it, its P2W.  
---
Pick up 10 bottles at the shooting range. Kill a death claw. Kill some ghouls. Point A&gt;B quests. 
---
The game has no depth and no choices. The system is designed to screw you over and make you spend the whole time finding junk to repair your weapons and armor so what do they do? Nerf the perks that make this stuff easier because the perks were "mandatory". 
---
So much wrong with that statement.
---
It's not even as if they even have people working on this shit right now. Most atom shop items are simple reskins and old Fallout 4 assets that no one had to spend any time on and what few new items there are would have been finished months ago and are just being released on schedule. 
---
Too late, bought shroud and inspector. 
---
Wish you would have posted soon, I would have definitely reconsidered. /s
---
I did Mayor for a Day something ... at level 40 or so.
---
0-0.... Funny thing is someone who was 76 last night on kill one got a TSE Minigun....
---
I'm hoping that bethesda DEV's sneakily implemented a loot buff... Though everyone on our team received junk last night lol.
---
Thanks for you comment and I wish you the best on getting that first TSE! Though you might want to cross your fingers and toes for a furious/bloodied explosive weapon!
---
Likely the artists who’s hearts were poured, had no idea what the execs intentions were =\ 
---
Feel for them ❤️ 
---
This isn’t p2p . They have little incentive to keep dumping money into this game 
---
True it definetely happens.  Not sure the hate and division isn't the reason for some staying silent on certain topics. 
---
the game is like a hydra, fix 1 bug, 2 more bugs appear 
---
There's a reason it's called FFXIV - A Realm *Reborn.*
---
They rebuilt that **shit**
---
I agree that it sounds ridiculous, and it was ridiculous to witness. I can assure you that it was post patch but you're free to make your own conclusions about how he did it or if its true. I suspect foul play, possibly if he had stacked bobble heads pre patch and logged out and back in post patch and still had the stack buff. Regardless if you believe me that he was cleaning house through slap damage, the point I wanted to get across was the whole reason he did it was cause my friend was lvl 15 and its his Only character and he's new to fallout and had zero chance to defend himself. Its just bs that his first 500 hard earned caps were whisked away to the purse of some asshole. It makes it incredibly hard to advocate for new players
---
Exactly, this is run of mill normal stuff for a modern online game in 2019.  Not secret patch notes until the time the patch is being deployed only to find out it has broken something else or a change the community feels is terrible.
---
The game is a multiplayer game. Meant to be played and be more fun with others. And in my opinion, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who feel this way, it is. The difference between Bloodied and Melee, and TSEs, is that you actually have to have to optimize to do that those things. Here's an example of a TSE build: Demo Expert 5. You're done. Not much else matters. Melee players have to get up close and personal. There should be a reward for that. Bloodied players run around at 30% health or less. There should some reward for that risk. 
---
Here's the problem - we have problems with just the fixes part. Introducing new content only welcomes new problems. Worse if we haven't fixed the major problems before then.
---
I'm about as ready for new content as the next person but we need a stable foundation to build off. As the most recent patch has shown, we're not even close to there yet.
---
WE NEED MATCHMAKING 
---
That's a huge "if" for a game that is already broken. They need to just give us private servers where we can adjust the scale of things and if vendors will sale all plans and recipes. 
---
I've always had to scrap bulk to use
---
I’m hype for the real creators of fallouts new game coming out
---
Come on...its bobby pins. Canary in the mineshaft? Don’t you think that is a bit dramatic? The game has bugs and issues. The game has issues that need to be resolved asap. I am sure that those issues will get resolved. I definitely don’t think it is worth rage quitting over and spamming how terrible the game is. If it does not meet your expectations then move on
---
You shouldn't have to make these types of suggestions to a major game company
---
Right. That was kind of my point.
---
This game is doomed to the never ending PvP nerf cycle.
---
But, we're the b.e.t.a testers...
---
I think they should just remove the hidden crouch feature, that way you’ll have to pop stealth boys in order to go hidden from the map. 
---
I'd say they're encouraging people to spend money for a temporary stat bonus. Since you know, that's exactly what they're doing. If not then why not add some other cool effect to the outfits? Why not a cool graphical change for each costume. A cool animation. If the stat bonus is so useless, then why do they have it in the forst palce? If it's so useless why isn't it something cosmetic? 
---
Haha loot? Try getting disconnected right after she's killed so you can't even loot. Fuck the queen i'm not doing that stupid ass fight anymore, she can keep those useless ultracite vents.
---
It wasn't stealth nerfed. It was in the patch notes.
---
You missed the in the future part of his post 
---
Yeah I think I can. I'll be online from 4-8 est tonight.
---
Melee is op aswell and will probably get the nerf hammer next.
---
And your numbers dont add up. The SBQ probably has more hp. At 45000 hp and 200 dmg a strike you could kill the queen alone.
---
No kidding. Sad
---
It's so easy to farm caps. It was a job to farm plans. Now, it's Just easy farming for caps until you have enough for a plan that you know for a fact, where to get it. Kills the aspect of searching the nooks and crannies and actually exploring the world. Again, this is just how some of us feel. 
---
1. Are there too many complaints on the sub? Yes. 
---
2. Should people be dropping support tickets to Bethesda as well as of posting on reddit? Also yes.
---
3. Are there a lot of frustrated players who are looking for help n recognition of the issues they are encountering? Yes again.
---
People are upset about the latest patch, connectivity issues, shady business practices n much much more. I am frustrated too with the lack of help n communication Bethesda is providing the community. People are just voicing their displeasure in the only way they know how, by shit posting on the internet. 
---
Well they cut corners more than lacking help.  Fallout 4 was never meant to be networked. Had they not, we wouldn't be beta testing, we'd just be hearing about the game being in development now. Hard to say which is better.
---
What rifle do you have? 
---
I have a sniper and all rifleman perks and my TSE Lever is at 257dmg 
---
have fun crying about your TSE build champ, we won't miss you.
---
For all those people saying you can just earn the atoms, well guess what? You can also buy them. For all those people saying its just a limited event, well guess what? It doesn't matter because your paying for a boost. For all those people saying its such a tiny increase, well guess what? Its still a increase in stats for money!
---
Dev rooms are pretty standard.  They just aren't normally accessible.  Many of RNG loot tables deriving from when a player opens a chest are based off a Dev room chest with the entirity of possible items.
---
For instance, say the dev chest has 50 items in it.  A player finishes a dungeon and loots the chest at the end.  On opening that chest a script is run that basically chooses 2-4 random items from the dev chest and "dupes" them in the inventory of the chest the player just opened.
---
This is especially noticeable in games where opening the chest results in a delay of the contents being shown.
---
TL;DR - Dev rooms are used not only to test, but also for game systems the player encounters when playing the game.
---
I have a golden rule in life: never trust corporations. Never, ever. Especially ones with track records like Bethesda. I saw the cracks as soon as the game was announced, and the cracks were wider and wider with each new gameplay footage released. Mark my words: this game will never be good and fixed. Bethesda are all about one thing: $$$  
---
Think about it for a second: did ES4 add depth to the ES series? Fuck no, they dumbed it down to appeal to a wider audience. Did Skyrim add depth to the ES series? No, they dumbed it down even more and didn't improve on the combat in any meaningful way. FO3 and FO4 are both mistakes on the series and betray the pre-established lore and messages from the previous games. Nuclear war being a terrible thing is one of the big messages of the original FO games, and FO76 makes it into a joke. 'lul, use nukes to kill enemies it's funny, haha.'
---
This game won't ever be anything but a cash grab, and I'd advise everyone here to never buy a Bethesda product ever again. But if you feel you absolutely have to, buy it used for less than $10 years after its release. Don't give those scumbags any money.
---
Do people actually buy atoms? Bought some stuff and I still have 5k from just playing the game.
---
The fact that Atomic Shop items are giving bonuses in game is a terrible sign of things to come. I like this patch, a lot of things that I noticed on my end have been taken care of. 
---
whats the dmg on your handmade, and which mods?
---
I think it was supposed to be a joke but the problem is you actually end up wasting time and not having fun like you do in a real DMV.  The joke went on for far too long.
---
I can vouch as well... Repaired weapons after first silo run and had to repair on 3rd silo run. That usually never happened till yesterdays patch.
---
What's with all these over-reactions regarding the Unstoppables event?
---
It's temporary, the bonus is modest, you need to be in a team with each person wearing a unique costume for the bonus to take effect and, most importantly, the bonus goes away once the event ends. 
---
If the event was months long, ok maybe that's an issue but it's 5 days.
---
All Bethesda is doing is encouraging people buy the costumes so that you can run around as a cosplay team. That's it.
---
It's kind of adorable if you look at it that way.
---
Just my opinion, but I disagree. If I didn't need to grind for mats or experience (I do very little of the latter), what reason would I have to go back to the Wade Airport 20 times (I do like that place; good for sniping)? The journey itself is the reward. If I could just explore and do the quests, with no grinding involved, I'd get bored a lot faster than I will now. Up until yesterday, there were so many posts by overpowered players saying they had nothing left to do, they were swimming in ammo, and the endgame sucked. This is basically true for FO4 as well at some point. Sprint through all of it, "find" an overpowered weapon, become a god in at most, two months, and yeah, you're going to get bored a lot faster than me. 
---
Were you replying to me?
---
That's interesting and not what others are reporting.  Could it be a weight limit problem?
---
If you practice the skills required to do something eventually you will get better at doing that thing.  I would suggest that someone who practices shooting all day would become more effective at shooting.  I feel that's not getting represented in game other than cards you can just swap out.  Melee is the only weapon type that receives this bonus damage so it makes weapons that are not melee less effective in comparison.  I feel like anyone should be able to play how they want but right now it feels like all non melee builds are less effective.  Look at the insisor perk it gives melee weapons 75% armor penetration where as Tank killer for rifles maxes at 36%. 
---
For unyielding and bloodied to work you have to take a hit to your overall health anyway.
---
Man you are really taking this personal. Don’t like it then stop playing.  Maybe put it down for a while and come back to it in a few months.
---
It's not bobby pins. It's regression defects. Stop focusing on what they broke and focus on how they broke it. Ask yourself 'How did something so basic that they have sorted out in a previous patch get reset to the old state?'.
---
You wouldn't find a miner saying 'Come on guys, it's just a bird. Don't you think you're being dramatic?'. And anyone with any semblance of understanding of development, QA or release management should see this for what it is. They were **lucky** it was just bobby pins because that means people who aren't in the business don't realise just how laughably amateur their entire process is.
---
I was thinking about switching my heavy weapons  character to something similar to this.
---
Yeah the nerf did hit hard but if you don't like melee make a camando critical build have all the critical perks, camando perks and some sneak too. It works for me just use VATS and target the head and shoot while spamming your crit button and her health will go down quick plus if you have sneak attack dmg too
---
I have no idea, this is kinda unprecedented or at least I've never seen anything like it before. It would be logical for them to put everything they can behind a hotfix to make the game stable and playable BUT their track record so far suggests that they absolutely won't do that. 
---
I suppose if I had to put money down on it I would bet on no hotfix.
---
I will not buy star field or ES6 for this reason.  Need to send a message: stop making the same buggy ancient game over and over just because it’s cheap.  Invest in an actual team and technology and a new game.  With 2020 production values and AAA quality, not a game that was considered buggy in 1998 PC standards.  I’m sure Todd loves to brag about how small the team is and how cheaply they are squeezing out their next turd.  
---
You know presenting EA as an example doesn't hold a candle really because everybody knows they only care about the money. And considering all the bugs that came back in this patch that were previously fixed...well lets just say they once again rushed it without properly testing their stuff...again. Just like F76. Bethesda should just scrap their entire QA team(if they even have one..sometimes i really wonder if they actually have one) and get some decent people in there.
---
Yeah, imagine all of the people following proper channels and getting ignored completely because their complaints are in private. Insane. Unacceptable. 
---
The only other mmo I’ve ever had to use a ticket for was WoW, and each time a live person has contacted me within 24 hours. A few business days, ok, but over a week? Almost a month? Over a month? That’s customer service that’s non existent. 
---
Yeah Bethesda has burned me for the last time here.
---
I used to be a huge Battlefield fan, I bought the games on release, bought the DLC loved the series. Battlefield 4 burned me. That was the last battlefield game I ever played. Hardline, Battlefront, Battlefield 1, Battlefield 5, I refuse to even play those games when they're on sale.
---
I don't care about future Bethesda releases anymore, I'm not going to look for news on starfield or whatever their next game is, the next elder scrolls game, or fallout 5. 
---
But yet they can't voice their opinion or they are big meanie haters that are crying and whining and complaining and should just go away. And the more you try to alienate people who have a different opinion to you, the more negative they will become.
---
Found what I was looking for, thank you though.
---
The bolt action when converted to a rifle is more accurate if i recall then the hunting rifle. The revolver can also be pretty nasty if you land head shots consistently.
---
Did 2 queen runs tonight, not a single TSE in sight or sound thank fuck, can't stand those things, 2 melee 8-10 gunners neither queen lasted more than 3 minutes till dead, no lagging no issues.
---
It's about the only thing in the game since patch that's run right.

~~regression~~ testing is for losers!
---
-ftfy
---
Can't argue with that but we are where we are.
---
do people actually play this game? I thought it bombed based on the reviews 
---
Yeah if they're wanted and you attack them, you should get no bounty. I shot someone who was inside their base with a TSE and the splash damage hit their walls...boom, bounty.
---
Hardly. It only lasts a week. It's an event. People will bitch about anything. 
---
Don't listen to him, he's been drinking concentrated moron juice.
---
For sure bud.
---
Dude .. my mistake .. when I read your post I got karma syrringe in the head .. endangerol is np :)
---
Well imo you shouldn’t be able to see players on the map at all in survival, maybe a flashing marker showing people the general location of a player if they are firing a gun or something but for sure there shouldn’t be stealth boys 
---
We need to be able to make mods. As in like what you buy from vendors.
---
Just add at the bottom of the crafting menu, Mods-&gt; Excavator-&gt;Legs-&gt;Calibrated (or whatever)
---
Yeah I’ve been trying to burn through plasma cores to get rid of them but the Gatling plasma is breaking every three cores now so I guess I’ll just drop them all. 
---
Hey, Bethesda! I think your reputation just broke. Hope you have the right perks to fix it!
---
Your weapon condition isn't as durable as before. It used to have a 90% reduction in lose, now its 60%.
---
Melee is the only thing in the game that works.
---
I quit last week, haven’t quite quit the forums yet though ;)
---
Wait...that’s it!  Complaining on the forums is the new end-game :D
---
YOU are in passive mode, not them. 
---
It affects the damage YOU deal, not theirs.
---
As for the one-shot, I don't know.
---
But people need to figure out what Pacifist Mode does, instead of repeating nonsense.
---
Sounds about right. 
---
does anyone know if there is still a bug that causes rank 1 of Luck of the Draw to proc more often than rank 3?
---
If you look at the people complaining about the nerfs to TSE and everything, they say people are whining about not being able to kill enemies in 1 shot. While a super high powered sniper rifle from stealth maybe should do this, that's not really the issue. The issue for me is when it takes 16 shotgun shells to kill 1 high level ghoul, in a pack of 10 ghouls. That's 160 shells.  For one pack. You might be in an area with several packs. 
---
I really liked survival on FO4, where you did a lot of damage and could drop an enemy with a well placed headshot, but they could kill you with a few shots too. 
---
It would just be nice if there was a balance. But since your weapons stop gaining power at level 50, or 45 in some cases, and there are no weapons that directly increase damage, with a few exceptions, you get bullet sponges. It's not so bad with the Queen, but when a mole man is sitting in front of me pummeling me while I pump round after round into them, it's less fun. 
---
 True, but I think we’re way past that point. Can’t roll back time. I believe small fixes and small content drops are the answer, rather that larger content drops.
---
It's almost like they're padding the game. Wouldn't know why they'd do that.  :|
---
All those unsupported posts that say they "accidentally rolled back the code that fixed the duping glitch".
---
Don't you think it is inherently a bit absurd that you had 561 damage when I have, for example, a Gauss Rifle that is boosted 10% for mutations (which I have) with 30% boost to rifle damage (across 3 perk cards) and I'm still under 300? Don't you think a guass rifle should do more than a handmade rifle? 
---
TSE was definitely excessive and needed to be nerfed. No legendary combination should be able to give you 6x as much damage.
---
That said, they really should've buffed other things at the same time. It feels bad for players when a patch just nerfs over performance without buffing things that suck. 
---
Not true.  Crafting would use bulked items before yesterday's patch.
---
Who is that lazy of a player that they keep buying plans that they already own? You do realize that plans can be found for free? With a bit of rng luck you can get all of the plans you want. 
---
What is wrong with grinding for caps and drops? That is literally what every MMO has done. From UO to WOW to Fallout. You grind levels, drops, and currency. 
---
Who wants to play a game with unlimited access to drops and currency? That would be a dumbass game
---
Yeah it's definitely late game laziness with me :)
---
I just kinda float around the forums. I don’t play much anymore, I’d just rather play something else. 
---
Might as well be hey?
---
Pretty sweet rifle I wont lie.
---
I'm heading over there too, thank you!!
---
Normally I’d discourage this, but...they displayed horrible sense with their first major needed nerf so...yeah keep it on the DL.
---
Wow, great job figuring that out!  Thanks for sharing!
---
Sorry should have been clearer. After level 50 you don’t get any additional SPECIAL points to raise your stats. You either get to respec one point or pick a new card. So of course people (who want to pay to win) are going to take any advantage they can get. If your team is trying to compete and everyone is past level 50 - the only way to boost your stats is with gear and new positive effects. Clothing that can only be purchased through the atom shop would qualify as that. So I could see people spending real money (after their current atom stock runs out) on buying gear that provides bonus. Just wait until a water purifier comes out that produces or stores double the water. I would buy that. Or a workbench that reduces materials needed to repair. I would buy that. 
---
Wouldn't y'all have learned from fallout 4 that the habe series was dying
---
So they will just have everything doing no damage whatsoever!? It's broken.
---
 This isn't a tantrum, it's an expression of wasted time, effort and a lack of awareness from a developer.
---
 Your argument means nothing. Try take on SBQ with no melee characters and see how far you get before you realise that health meter is not going down.
---
 I agree my numbers may be wrong but my argument remains the same, you actually give it more merit by increasing her health. So thank you. 
---
Actualy your theory on how he did it sounds possible and I agree that post lv 50s have no place attacking pre lv 40s 
---
I don’t think posting on Reddit is how you get a refund.  This is like the internet version of Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy.
---
It would change a couple of things even if max power levels remained the same. It changes level scaling by either adding more or less power to mid-ranged levels. It changes respec time by either requiring more or less cards to be gained thus more levels required to spec into it (or more or less levels wasted specing into it first). 
---
Demolition Expert also doesn't only just affect 1 weapon type. It's not a weapon specific perk like the rest you're talking about. It affects secondary weapons (Grenades and Landmines), all ballistic weapons with the Explosive mod, and launching weapons. So you're affecting all the scaling/spec effort for those as well.
---
It is a completely different perk type than Rifleman, Commando, or Gunslinger. It doesn't need to/shouldn't be treated the same for the sake of making the stars on the cards line up in the perks menu.
---
Honestly i have 6k and have bought the cowboy hat black bird paint,2 camp floors and the hunting rifle skin all earned in game
---
Jesus Fucking Christ. The store works perfectly because it's a simple store front releasing shit on a set schedule. Do you seriously think they still have an entire team dedicated to the atom shop manually updating and constantly creating new assets? They finished working on the shop and it's assets ages ago and it's been running on auto while they fix the actual game. 
---
Not just that, even the atom store items are untested and horribly buggy!  I bought the 700 atom bed and placing it instantly used up the remaining 30% of budget, and scrapping it didn’t lower it.  Had to rebuild my base because of a $7 bed.

Surely you mean Reece Simpson, a.k.a. Roll Safe, unless I'm missing some other reference.
---
Grind a few days, while those few days were working to put bread on the table for our families 
---
Pistols need something to make them more viable. 
---
The increased plan costs were bullshit without an increase in caps on the vendor.
---
It saddens me that I laughed and then sighed knowing it will go down this way. The game has so little content that their only hope is to make the grind so tedious that it's hard to do anything but grind for things. It's a sad state and inexcusable but this is what a company does to try and hide their game's lack of content.
---
I cant beleive you got banned. for this post
---
Quit bitching about this. It’s not a permanent buff, and 15 hp is not even noticeable by any means. 
---
You are absolutely right
---
I think part of the issue here is you're at point blank range with a sniper rifle. This is why I would carry a revolver pipe rifle as a back up. I would kit it out for hip fire accuracy.
---
Oh no, we've been fired :'(
---
&gt;  rich old white wall street Republicans 
---
Spoiler : Incompetence and stupidity has no color, no flag, and no party (or every single one of them, depending on how you look at it).
---
Let's not also forget level 25 player with a TSE double barrel can easily kill any level player as well, and that shouldn't be a thing.
---
Yep. Unable to play since patch
---
The issue with proof, for me anyway:  I never used video to  record pre-patch stealth. So showing the same location, build out and gear and stealth performance differences is something I can't do.  This is somewhat compounded by no way to measure stealth performance objectively, leaving me and others with the "what's going on?" suspicion. 
---
I just got a 3* on xb1. Will hold onto it until tomorrow. Categoricshoe47 
---
Also stealth is broken. Can’t get past [caution] on the HUD indicator. 
---
The biggest issue with more frequent patches to the client has nothing to do with what Bethesda wants to do.  The issue is consoles.  That's why we were able to get the patch in early Jan to PC a week before consoles.  And the biggest issue with patching with Consoles is... \*drum roll\* Sony.  Sony has rather tight restrictions on updates to applications on their platform and that puts a constraint on frequency of updates and the size of those updates.  (basically console updates in general are MUCH larger than pc updates, witness example this update...).  So not only Sony's restrictions causing issues a lot of console PLAYERS would be unhappy with more frequent large downloads, this could in fact (thanks greedy ass cable companies) cause financial hardship to some console gamers since data caps on internet land lines are a thing and multiple gigabyte downloads 1/week could cause people to encounter overage charges...
---
TLDR; if this was a pc only game more frequent smaller updates might be an issue but due to consoles there are many complex impacts which cause companies to not be able to do frequent small updates. 
---
Sen-si-tive!
---
No tears at all, as I've said on previous posts, I'm just gonna step away from the game.
---
 You're repetitive trolling tactics to get a reaction are getting tedious. Cheery bye! 
---
You’d think at this point they would have raised the limit or removed the cap (HAH, GET IT?) completely. 
---
There are still countless players out there struggling to even break 1k caps, and this part of the update did them players absolutely no favours whatsoever. 
---
Didn't Lot say something similar to Sodom and Gomorrah?
---
Which will be me I guess, I can't see farming being very fun.
---
Bethesda: We hear your feedback and will pass it along to the team!
---
Also Bethesda: Here's the nerfs and bugs you didn't ask for.
---
OMG! Didn't think about that! Thanks! 
---
I'll look into it. With the alteration of vats functionality from previous games I've strayed away from using it. Do you have a Perk layout or maybe video of the described build? Thanks for your comment! :3
---
At this rate, pulling a FF XIV might be a good idea. 
---
On PC?  Text chat mod?
---
New Super Sledge Skin, "Plus 5 to Strength while wearing this skin"
---
NP, a couple updated already so you might be able to update too.
---
You act all high and mighty when you've been using a TSE gatling gun for yourself!
---
 Looking at your history of comments, you've been just as involved as everyone else.
---
 Make a reasonable contribution instead of taking shots at others for doing so. 
---
I love Bethesda. I buy every emote. The dev team is doing so good.
---
Many games on Xbox and PS4 have dedicated servers and using a shitty repurposed engine that only supports 24/32 people was a development choice not a limitation.
---
Dude I had a Gauss Rifle that dealt 1500 damage. Find the right weapon and they're still useful. While I'm only dealing about 400 now, I still don't believe that you should have been dealing more damage than someone who had obviously been working on their perks. 
---
Can confirm was moderate n happy now very livid!
---
I can farm every cap from every vendor and get enough for 1/3 of one plan.  
---
Shit's broken and fixing it's just gonna break other shit. This is now a subreddit dedicated to how much of a shitshow Beth will put on until the plug is pulled because it's gonna affect sales of the next numbered Fallout game.
---
Lol so you need a safe space? It's a trash game and you need to accept that verifiable fact. 
---
Embarrassed to be a Bethesda fan right now. I miss the good old oblivion days...
---
The reasoning behind the increase is not the problem.  The fact that the increase in cap requirements was not accompanied by any means of increasing cap procurement is.  This game is so stingy with caps, it will take days to buy just one item in a lot of cases.  In some cases it will take weeks.  It feels like a shitty mobile game the way caps work except that you don't direct sell them (please tell me that's not coming).
---
OMFG. Well. That explains a lot. I'm so done. 
---
I don’t get games with RNG-based loot. I would always be on short supply of some sort of junk material needed to craft, repair, or modify something, but find so much more when I have a surplus. 
---
The silver shroud ghoul could have taken it? Hes been around. 
---
&gt; Does this mean jetpack plans won't be super fucking rare?
---
They are super expensive instead!  Hooray!
---
Can you please show me for reference? I'm open to changing my mind, but I'm not going to just believe someone on the internet. How do I know you're not the one bullshitting?
---
It's not about the buff being modest, or the length of time of the event. It's offering a buff that is available in the Atomic Shop. And it sucks because I really like the Silver Shroud and Manta outfits. 
---
Details?
---
I got around 7 hours in since the last update and I've had only some minor annoyances and a few old bugs come back but overall not a terrible experience like some are claiming 
---
I have well over 200 hours in this game and I'm sure I got a lot more since I still haven't finished the storyline and I'm still having fun playing in general 
---
Guess me and the 3 other players in the world will keep this game coming lol 
---
And the downvotes and upvotes in this very thread prove my point.
---
The rollback is just speculation. Let’s say that they did rollback the game to a previous version. There was probably a reason. Something may not have been fixable and they rolled it back to a point where it can be fixed. Maybe that is inconvenient but why care so much? Beth is the one with the money and reputation on the line. Not you.
---
I am sure they are sitting around and saying “hey lets fuck up this game today”. 
---
Most people with an ounce of logic would recognize that there is probably a very dedicated team working hard to get this game to where it meets most players expectations. 
---
The only important questions are:
---
Do you enjoy it? (Yes) just play (No) Leave
---
Is it playable in its current version? (Yes) just ay (No) Leave
---
Feedback is great. Constant complaining is annoying. There is a difference between “this bug needs fixing asap” compared to “Beth has ruined my life cause...bobby pins”.
---
You tell yourself that but we all know about serendipity etc. They will come for your (and my) builds, dont think otherwise.
---
Going forward BGS needs to stop messing around. It's no longer cute that your games are always buggy. It's no longer funny that "iT jUsT WoRks", it's no longer acceptable that your game graphics look like they've been ripped from a 90s game. You're one of the biggest studios in the world and it's about time you act like it. 
---
Bethesda employees: No one gives a damn that you comment on the sub. Stop insulting your customers and just fix the game. Seriously. If fucking Hello Games can fix NMS with their limited resources then you have absolutely no excuse. 
---
This ruined the game for me. I'de say its the final straw. I am lvl 171 and I still have trouble accumulating enough caps to afford these plans. I dont want this game to be a grind of making caps so I can afford mods to then NOT use because I have nothing to use them for. I'll just play something else that has a grind for meaning.
---
its bethesda
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHC1230OpOg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHC1230OpOg)
---
the day of launch the beta game only changed a file to official are you sure ? 
---
It seems Bethesda just has no balancing experience whatsoever. They werent prepared for players to walk around low health all the time to maximise their damage. They probably thought its too risky and people would just die if they tried. They werent prepared for everyone to walk around with TSE. Not sure if they thought about the damage of those guns, but at least they thought they would be rarer and not duped as much as they were. 
---
Bethesda now tries to backtrack and balance around these things and TSEs were the first victims. There are many things wrong about the balancing of this game. And the strength of TSEs was one of them. Now they are actually balanced. Compaired to other stuff they are still very strong. Some people walk around with a basic Handmade rifle and are totally fine.
---
Thanks.  I think that may be the issue.  But I’m think it’s just better to uninstall and move onto better things.   Farewell.  
---
I don’t know. What I hate is when you’re much higher level than another player, but they just melt your HP by using some TSE weapon. That shit is annoying. 
---
This right here. I could buy all 3 outfits right now without having spent a single penny on atoms. I'm sitting on a little over 5k right now just from regular playing. 
---
Sound like somebody is very happy! I like the direction too but not that much.
---
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
---
Another day older and deeper in debt
---
Honestly though, I can be honest with myself about it. I know my shit is OP lol.
---
So if a highly anticipated game comes out you wont buy it bcuz fallout 76?
---
Bro, Who are u trying to fool?
---
I didn’t like that episode, I’m done watching this show forever!!!
---
Play a sneak build all you want, use chameleon, cloaking or weightless armour, that’s fine, what I don’t want is a server where everyone is permanently invisible 
---
Wow, really? I run daily on PC usually 3 to 9 queens. I don't think I've EVER seen a queen kill for last two months without TSE's. 
---
I really wonder what build those gunners were using. Vats / Fire rate weapons definitely were being traded in volume before patch drop. 
---
Are you a PC player? Also could you list what GEO you are? All of my team is NA, and WE all had server issues. 
---
With the idiotic Nerf to TS from 100% to 25% why was there no buff to TS accuracy? If this is about balance... 
---
Amazing? Eeh.. I beg to differ.
---
https://youtu.be/v5aEip2NmAU where I got it from mine is slightly different because I have perks that help me when on low health like adrenaline reaction nerd rage and more.
---
This sub is for complaining about the patch only.
---
Jokes aside, your best bet would be to kill legendaries and doing the enclave events will be the easier option to get your commendations
---
Life is a grind. It's so easy, it's like breathing. 
---
Those who do not stray from the path, will never find something unique to call their own.
---
Sounds good enough to be made up at 9am
---
But they also had the highest amount of countering perks and mods in the game. Truth being told, I met a guy who I one shotted by my TSE shotty, I told him some tricks and next day, without exchanging any armor pieces (just mods on those pieces and perk cards) he was now suddenly able to live through few magazines of my TSE shotty.  
---
Seeing that they had greatest amount of stacking things was only part of the picture, as they also had the greatest amount of things stacking against them. Now all those stacks protect so much that you don't need legendary armor anymore not to care about TSE shotgun shots, and I have a good legendary armor... I do believe that this patch made the game harder for majority of players, and easier for me. I want it back hard please.
---
I’d enjoy it while it lasts, friend. You’re gonna have to spend a lot on Atoms to upkeep Bethesda’s servers ;)
---
Maybe, but I think you are overlooking the all rise.
---
Not sure if anyone else reported this, but I lost all but one Stimpack from my inventory.  Thankfully I have Super Duper and had a few bloodpacks to make more, but I know for sure I had more than one prepatch.
---
I’ve only ever made a fusion core run twice since beta, haven’t gone down past 20 of the things, I am an ultracite power armor user. What do you think is causing you to run out so fast?
---
All of you are not reading the main thing. This is a test. And you are all falling for it. The first person that responds to this gets 5.00 if microtransaction buffs aren't in game within 3 months. 
---
Does this work? I haven't seen this vendor at all
---
I know, I know they nerfed that TSE you paid 7k caps for, it will be ok Rakun.
---
Maybe bethesda should be good at their job? 
---
Unfortunately I’m one of the other still playing too.
---
Yup. I made sure to repair my rifle to 200% before I even went down to fight. 
---
Apparently many people are saying something with the new patch might actually be causing weapons to break much faster than usual, so it could just be that. Sucks either way.
---
Ive been legit looking for a TSE for a looooooooong time.
---
Ive had TS and E weapons and they took a nerf hit (big), so now, I really need to get a TSE 
---
But Pete Hines has vanished from Twitter. 
---
I know i use one. I'm also not complaining and completely support the nerf. 
---
I've got a quad ammo one and fully charge it does no damage. It'll drop enemies to no health but their health fully regens. Oh well.
---
I mean technically Howard "oversees" every game made by BSW.  Only Beth employees know how hands-on he is though.  Also the contributions from the other studios could have been as simple as an email explaining a texture or model decision, or as complex as taking over modeling or coding work for that studio.  Zenimax is privately held and they operate like it- we'll probably never know why the game launched as such trash
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer Are the developers self aware at this point that since they bent to the demands of  melee users the rest of life cycle of the product people are going to be complaining about what should be buffed and nerfed?  Has there been any consideration to just capping damage, a hard cap, a percentage of damage over base damage, or a percent of players health in PvP?  I am not sure where you fix things from this point, but I am pretty sure most of the community will not be happy with most changes.  A bloodied Melee can do 10,000+ damage, and the furious bonuses stack like crazy.
---
We may have not been able to save Appalachia from you, but we're damn well going to avenge it Duper.
---
I've done QA work, but not for games in the past.  Given a list of changes, QA will always zero in on what changes ie. test out those TSE changes, perk changes, etc.  What they won't do is go back and test old bugs that were previously fixed.  There's usually a regression done for basic functionality, but seldom will previous bugs get QA checked again.
---
Fallout USED to be an automatic buy from me. Now, not so much.
---
The combat one is actually a dev room item. Its a risk to even have it.
---
Well i can't really see where your coming from. Do you think this post has any chance of getting someone fired? I don't, it's just someone expressing their opinion. If OP was confident this post was going to get someone fired or change bethesda somehow then i would call them delusional. *Hoping* for change isn't delusional, though. 
---
Hey those people are still plenty busy "taking their time" and "not rushing" they're all probably still making their way to the Overseers camp to pick up the first of the Overseers Journey holotapes.
---
But the fanboys told me there would be no pay to win in the Atom shop.
---
Hmmm...but they are the same people saying they should make the game less fun and more tedious. Can't say I'm surprised. 
---
But I meant it's weird because of how much of a grind it is. 
---
They could cut the prices in half, and it would still be a grind, but a much more reasonable one. Spending 20% of the 25,000 Cap Maximum Limit on a single item is a little bonkers, even if it IS an end-game item.
---
That or they should just get rid of the Vendor cap limit so if you have stuff to trade to make back what you just spent, you can.
---
I also see that if I am near a higher level gamer, the enemy levels always change to a higher level. 
---
I've thought the exact same thing, 24 players per server is not enough to make trading viable. steal the grand exchange, put it in the game as a type of vendor, bing bang boom 
---
It happened all of the time for a crown or a single star enemy to not drop a legendary. However, random enemies can drop legendaries, and I also have never experienced a “missing” legendary item from a 2 star or above. 
---
Dude is being a cunt
---
It's not dead tho only thing that kinda bugged me was the nerf to demo expert but meh I'll live. The other thing that's hurting me tho is can't server hop to refresh ore veins now and servers are still unstable enough that taking a workshop isn't worth it
---
Your game won't even start up ?
---
Except that, the longer the player plays, the more likely they are to open up that atom shop.
---
The more they open it, the more likely they are to buy from it.
---
If they buy once, they are more likely to buy again.
---
So, no subscription is needed. Players continuing to grind wil more then likely at some point, buy something from the atom store.
---
The grind is necessary from the business standpoint. You my friend are focused on the short game. The CEO is not.
---
Is that what's causing this effect? It's ridiculous...
---
too many mistakes for a well-known company, as someone said in a comment it's as if they had hired monkeys for this game 
---
&gt;And in my opinion, it is
---
and in my opinion, it isn't. and Bethesda wants to please both of us, so there you have it.
---
&gt;Melee players have to get up close and personal.
---
&gt;Bloodied players run around at 30% health or less.
---
doesn't really matter when one can carpet bomb Whitesprings just as TSEs did before the patch and the other can solo the Queen in under 3 minutes, while both are essentially immortal thanks to sentinel/cavalier and the only real requirement is having a lot of rads.
---
you're not making sense. they're virtually the same level of broken.
---
What do you have to be at 550 carry weight?
---
like a child in the candy isle, ignore the tantrum
---
That's the thing before the (known) tag people were buying plans they already knew because they didn't know if they knew them yet. "A bit of rng" is an understatement.
---
Also in other MMOs like wow grinding for just currency is super inefficient. You grind for mats to sell on the auction house / buy mats off the auction house to craft things with and then sell (depending on profit margins) which is not something you can easily/realibly do in fo76.
---
Not before server wipe people duped like 10k nuka colas.
---
I remember when I was traveling along the southern border of the map and wound up getting chased by three Scorchbeasts (don't you love it when this happens?).  I knew I could get to R&amp;G Station if I ran, and when I did, who is waiting there for me?  The Flatwoods Monster.
---
Fortunately, two of the Scorchbeasts had dropped out by that point, but it was a pretty unusual and tense battle.
---
You should back your Opinions with facts otherwise you are just a whiny little bitch.
---
Yeah. Every time I go to Watoga and walk around the whole city at least five legendary robots spawn. But they are higher level. And this was before the patch so they might have nerfed it.
---
The only big down fall of the build is the ammo you use because of it being automatic but you can use a pipe rifle with .38 which is easy to find.
---
Well considering all my atom has been free I'm not doing a good job helping lol 
---
/r/whooooosh
---
I thinks it’s what ever you targeted last
---
It's whatever you were previously aiming at.
---
i have the exact same on my t60
---
This was really it for me...Been a supporter of Fallout for a long time but the incompetence  shown laey has sealed it for me. Im the last of my friends that played and now im done as well. Best of luck in the future.
---
This happened on Xbox as well, three full clips of a two shot handmade into a level 22 bloatfly, when the one I shot a few seconds prior died in one shot. Tried melee, shotgun, literally every weapon I had on me and it's health wouldn't budge.
---
At least the very basic smoke tests should have caught that. I don't think they have any Quality Assurance at all.
---
Sure if you have multiple miles all with 25K caps each I can see how that might be disappointing.
---
Might want to loosen that tin foil hat man.  I survived Fortnite Save The World for over a year of not being "pay to Win".  I am pretty sure this is not going there either.
---
You can also fight monsters and get legendaries, if you're lucky a few pieces or even one can fetch you those 5.5k pretty quickly, you could easily do it in 1 or 2 days.
---
If you knew game balance you'd knew you don't need any special and expensive equipment to be able to take few TSE shots and then shoot back. People confuse their own unawareness of perk cards and craftable mods with lack of balance.
---
For me it's not even that i disagree with the people bitching, it's just that im tired of reading it! Does the game have problems? Yes. Do i still fully enjoy playing the game? Fuck yes! Just don't need all the negativity
---
I don't mind but it won't be now.  Everyone in my team already went to bed and I plan to as well.  But might just as easily say you should test for yourself, it's not as if it costs you anything.  
---
Anyhow...  believe whatever you want.  I've posted proof pics of other debates (power armor stats) and still had people insist despite pics that whatever their pet choice was highest/best/whatever.  So I am kind of apathetic to proving myself on these reddits, people who know me, know I don't bullshit.  And anyone really invested in the question, should really check for themselves instead of relying on hearsay in the first place.
---
That should imply I didn't get what he was saying.  I get it.  Its just pathetic to need a safe space. 
---
I want to play,but I just cant after this patch. The game is becoming pathetic in its current state. This post is what I wanted to see but couldn't write myself. Thank you for this
---
"No one cares about your gaming experience."
---
Well that is most definitely a serious problem for a company that want to have recurring customers.
---
It will eventually  be a great game for whoever is left to play it.
---
Bla bla bla
---
Ah, OK. I thought we were talking a dmg nerf. They are cheap enough to repair and as long as you repair them to 200% it shouldn't be a problem.
---
They tried patch note before release in the past, they get crucified either way.
---
We're talking just PvE side of balancing not pvp.  PvP balancing gets weird in 76 due to level scaling, power armor vs non power armor and perk cards coming into play (albeit being able to be 1 shot by a tse weapon with slap damage regardless of perk cards of the user or level/cards/equipment of the receiver while in pacifist mode is kinda case and point for it being too strong in pvp too).
---
You think more people would be online after a patch! But NO there wasn't many people on last night.  I too defended Bethesda, didn't care about explosive guns but just having fun. Played last night and I didn't really enjoy myself. 
---
Vendor prices are ridiculous, I seem to have a slew of infections which I didn't get that often before. My Marsupial would not work at all. I was changing perk cards trying to find something that I enjoyed. It seems fusion cores last a lot less than they did before, there is a lot wrong. Their testers suck, don't they test shit before they release a patch? 
---
What's left to do now?  Moving on is what
---
RC
---
It is now a total chore to have to change and respec my character to have a halfway decent build. They break shit faster than dupers are our there breaking it. This is why destiny has failed many times and exactly why the division failed. Too many nerfs kill the game. They went way overboard now. Anthem here I come. (From a lifelong Fallout fan)
---
Twitter is more of 1-way communication. It's hard to engage in a discussion.
---
It's very much on the dev team and QA. Dev Team put up the build and QA failed to notice.
---
Why didn't they catch is not the issue we should focus on, that's something they need to figure out internally. The issue we should focus on is why there hasn't been a roll back or hotfix. They decided to let the "new" build bake. You either continuously roll forward or do a rollback. Make a decision.
---
No QA team.  Well in a way there is.  And it’s us.  And it’s free.  And they have our money.
---
Cool story bro. But its just untrue. If the game id good you will buy it. Period.
---
The junk pile is great for getting more screws. How the hell are you only repairing every 4 days?... even with perks that's not often enough.... Maybe if you use your weapons you will understand what the rest of us are going thru 
---
The latest, greatest patch did in fact break bulk crafting. Until they patch it in 1-4 weeks we'll have to break down any bulk to use it.
---
Doing a [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=bulk&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=day) would've saved you the trouble of posting and waiting for a reply.
---
did you try setting the priority to high?
---
I thought I read in the update notes that bobbleheads no longer stack. I'll go back and re-check
---
I've honestly been tempted to just uninstall it and wait a year. That's just sad, but then again, I installed Skyrim SE about a week ago and got about 200 mods running and having a great time.
---
Thank you! Real MVP!
---
Wow dude. I'll gladly get video showing me fighting 2 or 3 at one time and killing ALL of the scorch they spawn with them and those bats hardly landing. Im only upset because they hardly land for me.
---
Too bad I didn't take the video like I thought of doing last night. The whole reason why I made this post was because of that.
---
I guess you don't know all the mechanics either. Maybe you could go to the prime fissure and show all of us that we're wrong. All kill all the scorch to make them land. Consistently. 
---
Yup. Done.
---
I will never consider a Bethesda pre-order ever again. I'm not looking forward to any new Elder Scrolls. I don't have any interest in any Fallout game Bethesda creates. 
---
In my opinion. Bethesda killed a 20+ year old franchise and I find that unforgivable. 
---
have you tried throttling down your GTX.  maybe AA is too high, GPU overheating?
---
just my 2 caps :)
---
Im on PS4 and dont get that many crashes...maybe one in 4 hrs.
---
They're too lazy. 
---
Dude there are a ton of unique locations in the far off lands for example the lone tree on the top right of the map which is bright red 
---
Could work, Good idea :) shame there’s nothing in the game like this though 
---
If nothing works then everything works.
---
Unless you want to build and scrap weapons/armor to learn all the mods
---
I wonder how hard their heads hurt trying to pretend the problems this game has don't exist.
---
Enemies werent health buffed but stealth is being stupid right now
---
Being aware and caring are two different things.
---
Seems that is a known bug with high damage guns?  I heard it happening on other things as well.
---
Did StW have microtransaction buffs? I honestly only remember being able to buy specific defenders and other mats. I remember that one event where they let you turn your event coins into V-bucks. I stopped playing StW when a lot of people I'd queue with were AFK or just not helpful. 
---
Yes, 3* legendary creatures don’t always drop 3* loot, sometimes it’s 1*, 2* or nothing at all. Sometimes I’ll loots a regular corpse n find a 1* weapon or gear kinda like the game felt bad for fucking me over n over n gave me a pity prize. I am level 92 n have had four total 3* drops. The system is so bad I am constantly being given the same exterminator combat armor left arm I sold 6 times. (This piece drops at whitesprings by the 3* ghoul in the parking lot.) You would think more people would be bitching about this issue but I guess it proves just how broke the economy is in this game. There was a great post on here last week about drop rates n not so random drops. 
---
It should
---
No bro, you deserve this by buying this game at the first hand.
---
&gt;minigun 
---
Here is your problem.  The minigun sucks because of the damage reduction.  Gatling Gun or 50 Cal are both better against the queen.  Also try using a endangerol syringer before using your minigun and upgrade your minigun to prime if you haven't already.  Finally get someone to use a Cryolator which does serious business of making EVERYONE's life easier by freezing her in place.  Doesn't do a ton of damage but it multiplies everyone else damage by making sure more shots on target (if she's up in the air) or less damage if she is on the ground (possibly reducing how much she spawns?!?!).  
---
I think that is a good idea as long as the items that you need to craft the legendary mods are super hard to get rare items.
---
I am level 100 and I still use crafted weapons because I have not had a single legendary weapon drop for me that suits my build.
---
I don't really care because my crafted weapons can kill just about anything in 2-4 bullets. But I think it would be awesome to be able to craft something better.
---
Because stuff like that isnt obvious to **anyone** who played the game for more than an hour.
---
If the developers need so much feedback and work to realize even these most obvious of design flaws, then the cause is already lost.
---
&gt;The trade off is you're probably in rage
---
This typo is funny and true
---
People are allowed to complain when incompetence is shown front and center.
---
The bobby pin thing is a glaring reminder that they are half-assing their way through these patches.
---
It's been out for over 3 months now...they'll never make progress fixing the game if they are constantly breaking/reverting shit.
---
"it's not that bad" works for the first few weeks of a release.  Look how long it took to close the dupe exploits.
---
If they truly gave a fuck about the state of play, they would have had an all hands on deck from the get go, shut down servers and fix them. Instead they let them perpetuate for months. Now they implement an account wide cap on carry weight?
---
Why didn't anyone think of that as a bandaid in fucking November or early December?
---
You can give people only so much slack, eventually they'll find a way to hang themself.  Their nonchalance at addressing truly game breaking issues is the problem. 
---
Everyone is having that problem
---
I did the same thing but I only have one floor. I spent a good while trying to move stuff to have the space since apparently it took a lot. Then I moved my camera up and Bam! They go on the ceiling. I felt pretty dumb
---
+1 for [Dork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcho6wArwDI) usage. But absolutely agree.
---
Crippling depression from realizing he paid for a pre alpha that got worse after each patch
---
It's a bug. It was fixed with a previous patch and now it's back. Along with ridiculously heavy bobbypins
---
I guess that’s fair. It was kind of a shit post anyway.
---
&gt; I'd say they're encouraging people to spend money for a temporary stat bonus.
---
See you say that but you conveniently leave out the conditions in which you get the bonus. 
---
The people who get to benefit from this is a super niche group. On top of that, for the bonus as meagre as it is to be meaningful, it would be in team vs team PvP or team vs solo. In the latter case, how many solo players have complained about teams of griefers going around ganging up on then? It's really rare.
---
On top of ALL of that it's just +45 health. In some cases that's like 1 extra hit. Often not even that in a lot of cases. You weapon might be high enough damage that you may not even notice the difference.
---
So basically you're worried about a modest advantage that affects a super niche group with an equally niche impact to the player base and the only way to get that advantage is that more than 1 of you are willing to purchase said item and play within the 5 day window?
---
Maybe it's just me but we have bigger fish to fry right now. This is hardly pay to win. There's certain the "pay" part. it's the "winning" that I'm questioning.
---
First gold? Many thanks to the anonymous wastelander out there.
---
Ok, thanks for telling me!
---
There were a lot of item weight related fixes. Those fixes may have interacted with or altered older fixes. I don’t know exactly how, nor do I really care. It’s possible that some segment of code was forked prior to the previous fix, and Bobby pin weight was un-fixed. That happens sometimes. It’s possible that the new fixes had an unexpected reaction with some item weights despite including the code that previously fixed it. If item weights are calculated somehow, that calculation may have changed. If they’re fixed values on a table, a typo or a misplaced cell insert could do it. 
---
When you’re testing the fix for “Player shouldn’t be able to trade / pick up items when overburdened by x amount”, the weight of every individual item in the game probably isn’t on that checklist. 
---
I’m glad I’m not a video game developer. Lots of shitty hot takes from consumers who have no clue what they’re talking about. 
---
Next few months will drop more new games.  Fo76 wont last a few more months with no content.  
---
Cheers. 👍
---
Let me know what you see. Curious to know if addictions are actually worse than advertised. Cheers
---
If the game is good I’ll buy it. 
---
If Bethesda somehow can pull a miracle then yeah, I’ll absolutely buy it. 
---
If they release a game as half assed as Fallout 76, I will not buy it. 
---
If they don’t work on the Creation Engine to fix stuff that existed when Morrowind rolled out, I will not buy it. 
---
I nearly skipped Skyrim, and I completely skipped Fallout 4. 
---
Bethesda has not done their loyal supporters any favours will FO76, why is that going to change anytime soon?
---
Use your brain. 
---
While the implementation is less than ideal, and feel free to say it sucks, the concept of swapping perks as necessary is actually a pretty big benefit.  Especially with earning perks after you run out of SPECIAL points to allocate.  
---
This is a big improvement over games like WoW, where the process to shift your specialization points was really expensive.  Even when dual specialization came out, it was hard to do something specific for farming versus raiding.  
---
IMO, it sounds like that player found a pretty efficient way to make a grinding process a lot less time consuming.  In a survival style of game, even as lightly implemented as it is with Fallout 76, the ability to mitigate wear and tear as well as find efficient ways to gather supplies is pretty important.
---
I met a lot of gamers who have not enough patience to get even virtual money in the video game. Surprisingly, casual players don’t have this problem. To say that system is broken is always easier.
---
Seeing how much it tilts fangirls like you, it was all worth it.
---
Don't forget cooking food, boiling water, and managing your inventory because food and water weighs so much.
---
No, there were no Microtransaction Buffs, despite everyone claiming it was coming in the next few m ok nths for over a year.
---
I hope so.
---
Meanwhile i play 25 Hours a day....of course.
---
\+15 HP when in a team for a week is hardly a pay to win buff. It's a minuscule stat boost that came about like this:
---
A: "Hey we should let players Cosplay the comic book characters!"  
---
B: "Yeah, and we'll put in a silly 15HP if they're a super hero... wait for it... TEAM!"  
---
A: "Hey now, that sounds like Pay to Win?"  
---
B: "Meh, just do it for a week, that way no one is actually paying for anything they keep"  
---
A: "Good idea, what kind of daft players would think that's Pay to Win?"  
---
Give me a couple of days and I might be there with you too!
---
Massively agree with that. If you don't mind, I will add that to the list!
---
You mean the guy who has disappeared since launch, only retweeting tweets? :D
---
I played for a couple hours last night and was freaking loving the changes to the plans/vendors, because that's a QoL change I've been hoping for since release. Didn't see any old bugs except the bobby pin thing, which is a pretty ridiculous regression, but really only a minor annoyance for me.
---
I'm not going to pretend I'm outraged, considering I just dealt with the exact same situation at work yesterday where I had to squash a bug I already fixed over a month ago because sooooomeone must have not pulled the latest changes to a few unbuilt files. This shit happens. It just sucks that it had to happen in this situation when Bethesda is already taking so many lumps for what people perceive to be poor updates to an already poor game, on top of everything else that's occurred since release. Of course we're all just speculating and actually have no freaking clue what actually happened, so I'll wait for some kind of statement.
---
The thing that will make me throw in the towel is if a year after release there is no new zone to explore. I like Appalachia but I definitely don't see myself spending more than a year in it if there's no new content.
---
Same weapons are breaking faster than post patch had to repair all 3 I use today after repairing yesterday which never happens
---
As I said. They are only losing slight control of it at the moment because their shilling and vote manipulation can't quite keep up with a real influx of unhappy players.
---
"We understand your frustration with the recent patch and thank you for your patients as we work to correct the issues raised by the community. We are constantly working on improvements to the game to improve performance and content. Stay tuned!"
---
&gt;Like I said though, there are still requirements.
---
not really. the only requirement is soaking up rads. at least explosive requires/d a 5 card investment.
---
&gt;And if you didn't want to play with other people, why did you invest in a persistent, online multiplayer game?
---
because despite what you may think, this isn't a "full" mmo and can be soloed 100%. Beth made sure of that.
---
How about the QA team? When will you hold people responsible for how fucked up everything is?
---
I'm not upset about TSE I was expecting it and happy for it. I'm upset that they nerfed other things because if TSE. I have a pure demolition build, every type of explosive heavy weapon (not talking legendary affix) every grenade type and and the Nerf to the demo perk weakend an already weak weapon set. Just to balance out TSE. They said demo perk was over performing, I doubt they looked at it outside of TSE and actually at weapons that are actually explsoive. Explsoive ammo is hard to find, it's heavy, it cost a lot to crafting for so little back and the weapons that fire them are heavy and break easily. The AGL still hasn't been added back to the Bear Arms perk card making them weight 22+ pounds. There was no reason to mess with the demo perk or White Knight to be honest, Beth just has no idea what they are really doing when balancing the game. Buff of the enemy type weapons make people want to use them over TSE a trouble shooters should do more than the 30% damage to robots. Make me want to carry multiple of the same weapon with different enemy effects so I can do my best. Because hell yeah I'd carry a few different enemy specific weps if they were actually viable. Even with the TSE Nerf they still out perform enemy specific weapons.
---
My position exactly. 
---
Whether you choose to believe it or not, Bethesda have been going downhill for a while now. And that is the facts. 
---
I'm not saying there should be no progression. I'm saying that the game currently has a very poor work/reward ratio, which results in an extremely grinding experience. A progression system is fine, and even some grind is acceptable, and unavoidable. The problem isn't that grind exists, the problem is that the grind is all-encompassing. Reducing the grind could actually help with the problem of overpowered players who feel there is nothing left to do- by making starting up a new character a more enjoyable and less taxing experience, then those players would be much more likely to start a new character when their first character stops having things to do.
---
This might even help out with atom shop sales. My character can only wear one outfit, after all, but if I had 3 or 4 different characters I played, I might be tempted to buy a new outfit for each of them.
---
"Bobbleheads: Using multiple Explosive Bobbleheads no longer causes their effects to stack." What I don't get is if they figured out how to fix explosive bobbleheads why they left all the other bobbleheads alone
---
&gt;Let’s say that they did rollback the game to a previous version. There was probably a reason. Something may not have been fixable and they rolled it back to a point where it can be fixed.
---
This is hilariously (almost delusionally) generous. Why was it not in the patch notes if this was the case?
---
&gt;I am sure they are sitting around and saying “hey lets fuck up this game today”.
---
I'd almost prefer it if they were because then at least it would show they know what they are doing.
---
&gt;Most people with an ounce of logic would recognize that there is probably a very dedicated team working hard to get this game to where it meets most players expectations.
---
Most people with an ounce of expectation would realise that 'trying your best' doesn't cut it in a business.
---
&gt;Do you enjoy it? (Yes) just play (No) Leave; Is it playable in its current version? (Yes) just play (No) Leave
---
So if you don't like it get out?
---
Not really even games like destiny or smite can quickly throw in hot fixes whenever. Has nothing to do with consoles just a matter of whether it affects their micro transactions.
---
I played WOW since launch. Three months into the game players farmed currency and not necessarily mats. Three months into the game the economy was not established. 
---
I agree Fallout is not that type of game. Caps IMO don’t have that much value. I don’t think players 3 months into a game should have every plan that is available. Plans should be a rewarding experience. Plans are the only real carrot on a stick to keep improving your personal game. This is not a gear driven game. Unless the implement some system of unique item drops it will never be a gear driven game. 
---
Beth designed gear in such a way that almost any weapon or armor can be used at end game. Perks &gt; Gear. Plans are the only thing players really have to work towards. Now a big complaint is that they cost too much...
---
Wether you put more caps on vendors or lower the cost the results are the same. Easier to obtain plans.
---
I love how I agree with you but I get all the downvotes and you get all the upvotes. Hilarious... lol
---
I’ll be sure to treat it like the original  gjallarhorn from Destiny one and scream like a girl when I get it.
---
For those of you who don’t know what I’m talking about:
---
https://youtu.be/aFkVEOD0j_g
---
If you now agree with the youtubers Don you still feel like they were clock baiting people? 
---
In this specific case, id say all the negative posting may help to get someone at bethesda to notice, as annoying as it may be, its kinda better than the alternative of letting them think it was great and us being stuck with this mess for longer
---
I haven't seen a compiled list yet.  I'm hoping to find the rest of the Heavy Combat armor plans (base items, not mods).  What little playing I did last night located the Legs at Watoga for about 930 caps with Hard Bargain 3 and 4 Charisma.
---
Now I gotta find Heavy Combat Arms and Heavy Combat Torso.
---
I read Sturdy Combat Torso was at R&amp;G.  Eventually I'll have to get all those as well for Completionist.
---
"No, keep playing." -Bethesda
---
What’s your discord name?
---
Yeah I'd like to pickup combat and metal armor mods! I read here that they can be found at grafton station, but nope.
---
Glad to see it’s not just me.  Hard to not be frustrated with this game. Thing are supposed to get better over time, not worse. 
---
You mean where 1% of the players manipulate the prices and availability so the other 99% get f--ed over?!  No thank you.  I'll take the BGS economy anyday over that....
---
Microsoft and Sony limit the number of patches that developers can roll out, not sure if they even can at this point if they wanted to.
---
The only one from an older build that seems to verifiably be back is the bobby pin weight, other bugs returning is more or less rumour, haven’t heard any buzz over a new dupe glitch.
---
The fact that people still play this garbage is insanity.
---
It's your previously targeted limb
---
Are Todd and Pete on the space station or something? This is just like Fallout shelter as well. It was going to be updated “for a long time” which ended up dying after the major holidays. 76 won’t even make it to Valentines Day. Can you get tickets to E3 just to boo Todd?
---
I wouldn't call this early.
---
The rollback is almost definitely not speculation. Bobby pin weights were changed last patch, now they've been changed to where they were before, duping was fixed last patch, now it's back, fusion core generator rates were changed last patch, now they're back to where they were. In any sort of professional software development you very very very rarely regress you patch version and even then you don't do it without notifying the end use that you have done so.
---
I don't think beth is doing it on purpose. The same way that I don't think the guy with the wrecked car on the side of the rode ran into a telephone pole on purpose. 
---
Most people with an ounce of logic would look at this professional AAA game studio, compare it to other AAA game studios and realise that they are either working hard but are extremely incompetent, or aren't working that hard and are incompetent. 
---
No you missed the point. He doesn't want a new sub so he doesn't have to see it, did he say he was unsubbing from this one? No. He just wants to find a sub where people actually talk about the game and what they enjoy. Same reason I went from /r/fallout to here because every new fallout game the r/fallout just complains about it. Happened with 4 and 76 and although they're objectively the worst of the franchise, if I'm enjoying them, then I want to talk to others who enjoy the game. I didn't unsubscribe from /r/fallout because I still wanted to be part of the main discussion, but I also wanted a place where I could talk about the game without getting into a debate on the company of the game or quality of it.
---
So yes, you missed the point so /r/whoosh
---
it does appear that cores drain much quicker, they probably shit all over the the power user perk card.
---
Pacifist stops YOU causing damage to OTHER players. It does not make you invulnerable to player damage.
---
This is a weird subreddit. Everything gets downvoted here.
---
What were you banned for? You could try calling them out on twitter.
---
My suspicion is Zenimax management gave Battlecry Studios (Bethesda Austin) a hard deadline, insufficient resources, and a near-impossible mandate: a profitable Fallout GaaS using old technology never designed for online play.
---
Oh man it was so much fun! At first it was tough because I didn't have any colossus specific components, but towards the end of the demo I got a green one that increased my armor and shields by 700+ and gave me 10% more ammo for my heavy gun and 5% more dmg to my auto cannon and +2 chance of health pickups.
---
I Def felt a lot tankier after that. Best fun was playing with a Storm in the group. They have this aoe frost attack that primes the enemies and then I'd jump in and Hulk Smash them and they'd all shatter and go flying as my melee attack is a detonator and when you drop in with the melee attack it does aoe dmg as does the colossus detonator effect.
---
The game makes all the characters feel bad-ass
---
MONEH, if it cannot bring you happiness, can at least help you be miserable in comfort.
---
I haven't explored the corners yet, 200 hours and level 126. I also haven't finished the main story yet... No nukes dropped. Haven't built xo1. 
---
But I do read everything, need to catch up on some holotapes. 
---
I build a lot of camps, move them, start over, etc.
---
I explore the same areas hoping for new encounters. Try all of the events a few more times. Farm Whisperings for golf shirts.
---
I haven't found the carnival worker hat, if it exists. 
---
Don't believe what people spread around here.
---
If it was a previous build why is isn't the lever action gun reload bug back?
---
He can't because there is no evidence. It's fake news.
---
This just happened to me last night. Trying to get into the top of the world ski lodge to visit the vendor and I died twice trying to get through the mutants. Just to look at his new inventory. 
---
I’m level 75 and there were 11 level 68 mutants. 
---
E l e v e n. 
---
I would get ambushed by like 3-4 at once so when the stimpack healing perk (can’t remember the name) worked, it resets after like 20 seconds I think so they just destroyed me after the initial stimpack was used. 
---
The amount of ammo I lost and stimpacks used was insane. Plus I don’t wanna wear my pa during that kind of stuff because of all the stuff you need to repair it.
---
So, yeah. There needs to be a balance.  I could be wrong but I just don’t remember it being this difficult before the patch. Someone mentioned in here that it seems Bethesda is making it so we have to spend time in game repairing crafting and/or buying ammo almost as a distraction to keep us busy while they “fix” the game. When all it really does is causes us to come here and vent instead of playing. 
---
If that’s the case, it’s really disheartening and it takes away the magic, if you will, from what true Bethesda fans love about their games. 
---
Yeap.  Even in WoW with dailies and grinding for repairs, especially for end game content, the trick was to find ways to do things the most efficiently.  I appreciate that Fallout 76 allows you to swap perks to make the process as efficient as possible, but it still requires time spent towards resource gathering and finding those efficiencies.
---
If we should be directly e-mailing feedback to Bethesda then why do they have community managers taking feedback from Reddit?
---
Good thing i don't propose any changes to it then? And as i said elsewhere gating power can still be done.
---
Why defend an interconnected mess instead of streamlining them all and look at weapons finally?
---
And lastly it wasn't my idea to treat them the same damage wise with the argument that all else work like it. So let's just go all the way. 
---
I've been saying this since the TSE nerf was announced... nerfing isn't the answer,  but balance. A good pvp game has a counter to everything. And although I agree the TSE was OP, there is no need now that I need 2 clips to kill one ghoul when I have a swarm of them. Especially when I can 2 shot a ghoul with an axe. Armor and weapons need a complete overhaul as far as balance is concerned... we shouldn't be picking things that are viable combat options and making them shitty like entry level weapons.
---
I too can attest stealth is broken / buggy right now.
---
This is almost assuredly a side effect of the PVP stealth changes they made.
---
Bit hard to fire the people that bought your game
---
That would require them to be less incompetent. Never gonna happen. We'll be sitting on this shitty fucked up, roll-back version for at least another 2 weeks.
---
You got downvoted, a half-ass nothing response, and the other two responses that are more level-headed have been downvoted to invisibility. I still don't know what all the raging is about.
---
Missles, nukes, and even grenades need some love in this game.  I tried AWOL with a TSE yesterday and it nearly took the whole 15 minutes, until I switched to a vanilla sledgehammer dropped each robot in 2-3 hits.  I can only imagine how tedious it would be with a proper launcher if they’re underperforming.
---
I better be quiet lest 2-handed melee get nerfed.
---
It seems more and more like some "vault type experiment" as a way to purge items, caps, and player types. Maybe bethesda is taking the whole social experiment a bit too far.
---
I have 5 built at my CAMP.
---
Saw that plan not marked as (known) and couldn't help but laugh... 
---
Sometimes the hate train is the only train heading in the right direction.
---
FFXIV new director didn’t shut down the 1.X servers for the relaunch until after his team made great efforts to fix the major issues with the 1.X game itself. I don’t think they would’ve been able to pull off A Realm Reborn like they did without a good-faith gesture like that to show players that this wasn’t just a cash grab with their biggest licence.
---
I don’t think that Bethesda has that kind of good faith right now. If they shut down the servers without demonstrating that they’re going to actually fix stuff first- even if the hypothetical shutdown fixed EVERYTHING -would they get enough people coming back to generate the kind of word-of-mouth promotion needed to counter the hurricane of negativity surrounding the game?
---
That's why we wear armor in game.  Ever tried to knife a hunk of metal in real life?...
---
Thank you for this post. I am in the minority here but I do not have any problems with the game I enjoy it a lot. Maybe it is because I'm not a hardcore FO fan, and I'm not constantly grinding it out to max out my character. But even still I notice the game's bugs, and they do get annoying. But hey, isn't that every game? Yes, but I notice this game has it worst than others.
---
That aside, this is how you make a post talking about bugs, and a message to the devs. A very mature response- not "fuck this developer team" or "someone should be fired" (says the person who doesn't have a 2 year degree code). 
---
And it's easier to ignore the problem and blame the fans than admit the game gets worse every patch.
---
When logging in you need to stand still and not touch controls for about 1 minute.  In any case don't try to access the pipboy or map until you can move.
---
Fuck yes! i love a good pikachu meme drop!
---
&gt; It released with bugs that have existed in their engine since Fallout 3.
---
Get with the hyperbole!
---
It released with bugs that were present since pong!
---
Yeah and the silent majority just quit without saying a word. Can't wait until all of these big companies learn the tough lesson that they won't be fine when the majority stops buying their games. 
---
Did you trade with people instead of vendor? I get the most of my caps from people
---
They... Don't... Give... A... Fuck... 
---
&gt; That happens sometimes. 
---
That's what I say to my customers when I fuck up badly... Oh wait, no I don't.
---
The only real big fubar I can recall ever making is for the release of Thief - the game wouldn't save difficulty settings after you loaded a saved game.  A tough bug to notice, and forgivable.  The game wasn't great, all the same.
---
There is clearly more to it than "soaking up rads" but your salt over the nerfs won't allow you to admit that. Sure you can solo all day. But the effects if the tse weapons forced other people away from you when farming. Bc how can they even get in on it if they wanted to? I get that you don't want them to, but that's not promoting a healthy pve, multiplayer environment. In a multiplayer game. You clearly aren't a stupid person, and it's not hard to figure that out. So like I said, starting with tse was obvious. And everyone should have seen it coming. And the duping only exacerbated the whole situation. And sped up the process.

I love Bethesda

I think that [this](https://i1.wp.com/tmnt-ninjaturtles.com/assets/TMNT-mini-Shredder_front-2003.jpg?fit=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1) shredder better represents the size of the dev team.
---
I love Bethesda and I love Fallout and I love atoms they give me love
---
A safe place from the complaints? No. I have experienced most of what the community has voiced and agree that they need visibility.  A safe place from repetitive and pointless arguments over taking almost every single post turning it into one sides agenda vs. another, yes.  I asked for a content based sub, which I was directed to.
---
Sooo... Just wanted to add the actuals for how bad the Nerf actually affected what I was using (and again I felt they did need nerfed, just not to to the level Bethesda took it.
---
Ive been using Full Auto assault style rifles for most of the game, with most perk points being used to increase carry weight etc. for general grinding so I wasn't going for absolute max damage.
---
My Grinding perk Loadout damage wise was with 6 points in Commando (+45% automatic rifles), 3 points in Bloody Mess (+15% Damage) and Two points in Demolition Expert (+40% Explosive Damage) 
---
Explosive Assault Rifle - 129 damage
---
2 Shot Handmade - 158 Damage
---
2 Shot Explosive Handmade - 342 Damage
---
For doing SBQ events I used the same loadout damage wise but pushed Demolition Expert to 5 points (+100% Explosive Damage)... and yes I know I could have gotten another +15% putting 3 more points in Commando, but I didn't want to put the extra points into perception (mostly using Strength perks @15 and Intelligence @ 11.
---
Explosive Assault Rifle - 161 damage
---
2 Shot Handmade - 158 damage
---
2 Shot Explosive Handmade - 428  
---
(Keep in mind that the TSE Handmade full auto breaks way too fast to where if I wasn't at 125% or greater durability it would often break before finishing the SBQ and grinding for mats in the blast zone).
---
Now since the Nerf and having to respect... Commando 9 points (+60% automatic rifles) and 3 points in Demolition Expert (+15%) ... I ditched Explosive altogether because with ED on the weapon Nerfed from 100% to 20% and the DE perk Nerfed from 100% to 60% max and only applying to the 20% explosive perk I was using 5 perk points for just 6 more damage points on the TSE Handmade. So here are the new Numbers -
---
Explosive Assault Rifle - 61 damage (from a previous max of 161)
---
2 Shot Handmade - 98 damage (from a previous max of 158)
---
2 Shot Explosive Handmade - 106 (from a previous max of 428) .... This is literally now doing 1/4 of the damage...
---
... and with no free Respec to get to that.
---
So this wasn't just a Nerf... It pretty much totally wiped a whole class of weapons, and the perk loadouts for anyone who spec'd for using them when coupled with the breakdown rate and how much ammo has to be used to accomplish anything.   And it's not about wanting to "one shot" everything, just balance because I felt they should have Nerfed these to a degree as I initially stated.

I got the picture to work at the station in the Ash Heap. Flatwoods red rocket not registering.

My experience last night wasn't that different from my typical experience.  There were new issues, like the Bobby Pins, and inexplicably landing in midair during Marsupial jumps.  The servers were just as crap as ever.  Nothing like the game forgetting to recharge your AP during a Scorchbeast fight, right?  On the other hand, you have the vendors behaving logically now, and the (Known) plans thing.
---
But like most of the patches before now, I can't objectively say that much *improved* either, and that's really where the problem exists.  The game was clearly rushed out for the holidays and Bethesda has devoted all their time to getting it to where it should have been back then, but there's been zero new content to keep existing players occupied.
---
Even putting aside new quests, they can't be bothered to fix the lackluster quests like Protest March, Swarm of Suitors, It's a Trap, and the myriad of others that only work when they feel like it.  Instead, we get all this focus on nerfs to slow the game down.  Make armor break more often, make it require even more resources, hike the price of everything at the store, etc.
---
All that does is make the game more tedious.  A game that was already blasted by the majority for being tedious.  And even though we try to defend it - just take a couple perks of White Knight - here comes Bethesda essentially saying "No, actually, we intended for our game to be a tedious bore."
---
Rainbow 6: Siege immediately comes to mind, Elder Scrolls Online being run by Zenimax Online Studios is another that comes to mind. I can go on and on if need be to further drive the point home
---
A casual sub is a sub that replies "whatever" when their dom gives them an order.
---
Bye buddy I hope you find your dad
---
Exactly lol 
---
Seriously... I can’t believe they burned all the customers (me included) that pre-ordered or ordered at launch by dropping the cost of the game by a third and not giving them anything in return weeks later due to terrible reviews. 
---
Being bad at development and not caring aren't mutually exclusive fwiw.  They're doing a shit job but of all the gaming communities I'm currently involved in they seem to care the most by a mile.
---
Scroll up. The issue comes from legendary effects being removed for the sake of realism, while another legendary effects remains which is just as unrealistic or more unrealistic.
---
If the devs think that it doesn't make sense to have a game where flamers and plasma weapons don't have explosive ammunition for the sake of realism, that seems totally reasonable, to me. But not if they're allowing me to have weapons that magically turn 1 bullet into 2 bullets.
---
Def should have this, good suggestion.
---
Well I know what I’m testing this weekend during the public demo!
---
Vote manipulation. Jesus Christ, put away the tinfoil. They dont manipulate anything. They aren't "losing control". The sub used to be filled with people wanting to get away from the complaints from /r/fallout and the negativity there. So at that time, most of the positive players were here and it was heavily in their favor so they would vote positive things up and negatives down. But then everyone with a complaint came here, so now it's the opposite. As you said with the influx of negative players, there is now a vast majority of them. But you're trying to say that before it was positive because of vote manipulation? No, the majority just used to be different. I've been here since the first day this sub was made and I've watched the shift along with the subscriber count. 
---
Seriously put away the tinfoil, the majority population just shifted, hence why he wanted a new sub.
---
The last patch was the last straw.  Couldn't repair my weapon so I said fuck this and installed the division.
---
Of course.
---
Before Bugthesda buy the licence.
---
i agree, the nerf was not good, BUT, I think i know why they did it:
---
1) newer players stand a chance to get some loot (many TSE owners take over an event leaving the little guys looking for loot when there is none for them)
---
2) I have heard many players with TSEs saying the game it too easy! now they're mad.
---
I have seen 1 myself...very aggressive players now.  they want all the loot. People get pissed if somebody joins an event...like they own it.
---
If a low lvl is with me in an event and we are not teaming,  i'll usually wave for them get get a shot in before a legendary is killed.
---
Agrees with my only point... frownvotes me .... Says use your brain.....
---
Reddit in a nutshell
---
That doesn't explain why they don't do those on the PC however where they own the platform, though that could be due to the limited amount of people assigned to fix bugs. Or not wanting to mess with as many development branches. Who knows. 
---
I just wish they'd get whatever internal issues sorted out.
---
Yeah and the silent majority just quit without saying a word. Can't wait until all of these big companies learn the tough lesson that they won't be fine when the majority stops buying their games. I've looked at the charts, Franchise game sales, falling, falling sales. This game sold so poorly it was selling for less than half price within a month after release. Will they be fine? Customer confidence in the devaluing of a product they just bought is not a good precedent.
---
Please, I beg you to not get this game. I NEVER pre-order anything, but I love Fallout and ES, so decided that I should reserve my copy to get it on day 1 and jump right in. I played this game for the first weekend and basically find it intolerable to even play. I have not turned it back on since the first week. If I could get my money back, I would do it in a second without even thinking (this here is the issue with video games...there is no recourse to get your money back if it sucks, so companies drop crap games like this, get their money based on the Fallout name, and then don't actually care if it sucks).
---
Totally fair points. Myself, I've always been a one run and done Fallout player though. If I've fully explored the world (maybe repeatedly going to places I particularly like), and I've done all the quests, I hang it up happy. At the very end, I messed around with settlements and did radiant quests in FO4 for a couple of weeks, but that's it.
---
That sucks! I'm sorry to hear it's super broken for you. Here's hoping they fix this mess of a patch asap. :/
---
Auf weidersehn, goodbye! 
---
Evan?
---
Yeah, but... I AM trying to hit his head and let concentrated fire handle the rest, and its a huge quality of life improvement for me 
---
I have played around the same and still never got one.
---
I think having experienced players testing out the game in a BETA mode environment would be a good idea. Because I am new to the game, I don't really know what is bad or good. I am just enjoying playing the game. 
---
Oh look, another false equivalency trying to justify a temper tantrum. Real people possibly getting injured=/=your overpowered toys taking a hit.
---
Yes players did do that 3 months into launch (though I can't say whether or not I'm remembering that correctly since I was like 11-12 at the time) but a big reason for that is people were coming from Everquest which very much had that ultra-grindy mindset afaik. It's 2019 it's a well known fact that, in western markets, gamers don't really want to play MMOs where you have to grind for hours/days for minimal gain.
---
Personally it feels like FO4. Same bugs, same game. My biggest dissapointment is how tacked on the PvP or Co-op aspect is. But I'm not the biggest in-depth FO player, so take my experience with a grain of salt.
---
I agree. I have stopped playing all together now. At first, I was just getting bored. I can only justify wandering so much. I stopped all together after I wasn't able to make base blueprints anymore. That was the last straw. I would appreciate competent leadership that, at the very least, acknowledges that the consumers develop and emotional attachment to these games and its characters, just like a novel series or movie series. We want then succeed and, gamers especially, are willing to take a lot more abuse then most consumers, but there is a line. Bethesda, get your house in order. This will not just cost you revenue for fo76. It will cost you on future games because your customer base will stop trusting your brand.
---
Yeah that’s not Dave Chappelle
---
Maybe it wasn't their base, but someone else's? I've demoed a man's base to get him as he was wanted and never took a bounty.
---
The legendary drop nerf is probably one of the worst changes. Why on Earth are we being punished to play the game and get no rewards? That's just ridiculous, and only breeds farming behavior. 
---
 if anything a change to the loot table would've sufficed, instead to fix an exploit they hamstrung the players.
---
Diablo 3 learned this problem early on, we play this game for the loot, give us the God damn loot for crying out loud.
---
Totally agree that all the AoE weapons feel crippling under-powered, do use Plasma grenades but without perks they still feel weak. 
---
Have a Quad Tesla rifle (4x ammo capacity) with an auto-mod that's pretty good at clearing out groups but annoyingly the chain-lightning jumps to friendly targets too so it's un-usable if there's friendly players around.
---
Yeah i see, and it will change so soon! When people will see i am right about bethesda buisness. Many many account here supposed to be of normal users but is not. You can report me to say the truth, we are in democracy. What is not right for you, is right for me! When they will finish money to pay so many accounts here in reddit, we will finally see the real opinion of users! For sure i wont pay anymore any bethesda product! They will fall so soon..
---
TIL Bobby Pins are overpowered toys.
---
What system you play on?
---
This is a test. To see if a costume in the Atom Shop will finally get you to spend Atoms that people have been hoarding since launch. Bethesda in my opinion is going to do what they always and look past the fact that they are simply just good costumes and instead see "people bought the costume because of the buff" and it's going to continue until people are out of Atoms, then it will ramp up. The outfits will be so fucking cool that they'll almost justify paying money for them but at that point the buff may be significant or it may not be. I'm a former analyst, this is writing on the wall from Bethesda. 
---
I took over Poseidon and Monongah last night and can put this rumor to rest - they generate cores at a normal pace of 8 per hour not 0.8.
---
Can i have your stuff?
---
I'm not sure you understand. I'm not worried what you seem to think I'm worried about. I'm worried about where and when the "pay" for stat change briges that "winning" gap. You're cool with +15, let's see if they're cool with 20. We shouldn't have this at all , then I wouldn't be worried about it. But now every single time this happens the community is going to have to ask itself "is this too much?" Bethesda is pushing the envelope to see how far they can go and people be okay with it. I'm not okay with that envelope being opened. 
---
They got all our money, so maybe smart move on their part...the question will be if it will follow them on the next game and cause us all to really not buy it.
---
Genuinely don’t understand why we are being punished more for this game compared to other fallouts. If we can’t handle an unlimited cache of loot - don’t have it.
---
Include it at a later date. 
---
Remove junk and turn mods into something you pay for at a shop - the mods and attaching them. 
---
If you think they are the only ones taking feedback, then why do they have a direct channel for submitting feedback and bugs? You know, the place that it goes DIRECTLY to the devs and not through a middleman? You know, that Help.Bethesda.net page...
---
Then there will be nothing to work towards in endgame, and many people will have to rework their builds. Nerfs for the sake of nerfs aren’t fun 
---
I run a bloodied build. And I die a lot for those big numbers. Lol. It's a trade off. High risk. High reward. Tse didn't have high risk, except for the occasional suicide, it was just all reward. 
---
Wrong time to post buddy.  Due to the Uber nerf I doubt players are willing to help as it wastes a lot of resources for nothing taking down those ~~Skyrim dragons~~ bats
---
Thats a lie lol
---
Ok i agree, did i say otherwise?
---
Or did i say if ES6 is good you will buy?
---
He's complaining about people complaining.
---
* Comment by Some Poor schmuck:
---
          Please don’t yell at me! Bethesda is aware of how much they suck and they will address it in a later patch (probably by nerfing      purified water or something).
---
I'm glad you were able to move on with the quest! Yes, I'll let them know about your comment.
---
This might be one of those times where your ignorance of how something works makes you say some things that sound silly to people who do know how things work.
---
Okay, but this is an actual microtransaction buff. Albeit a small one. 
---
Nah. Solid foundation, still needs work. Point out a shared world game that released flawlessly with the current generation of hardware. I’ll wait.
---
Beta testers? You mean QA? 
---
Flatwoods didn't work for me either. Ash Heap has one that I got to work. Please add the locations that register or are bugged to this post. 
---
I m fine with melee as long as Tses get rolled back to their old state
---
what would we do without those keen observations of yours dribbles?
---
It's even more more obvious that kids love the taste of new Frosted Flakes. They're Grrrrrreat!

This right there... Caps should be 1 for 1...keep the 200 limit but if I buy a 200 plan from a vendor when they're at 0, it shouldn't add 60 to their pool...

4.  On both of my characters I am unable to sell anything nor purchase anything as the game claims that I have reached this new limit in items (1,500 I figured per character) yet on both characters, the stashes and characters themselves aren't over encumbered/over any limit. I can only assume that this is actually an account based restriction or that because of all my weight reduction based perks the game is not taking into consideration any of them and perhaps it's exceeding this new 1,500 pound limit. I've tried dropping an item to see if that would alleviate the issue but to no avail. I am still able to pick things up off of the floor and loot normally but I just can't buy/sell or trade items with other users.    
---

---
Because, when they weigh 0.3 lbs, there's not a whole lot of point of getting rid of them.
---
Also, it's not like outside of bobby pin weight that this was a fully functioning, bugless game. I'm just tired of paying to do chores on my computer.
---
You did say if ES6 is good I will buy - which I won’t lie, I might. I might not. I’ve always preferred Fallout over Elder Scrolls, Fantasy genre shits me. In saying that, Oblivion was my favourite game of all time. Period. You know it’s a clear problem when people preferred Oblivion &gt; Skyrim, and FO3 &gt; FO4 despite how terrible FO3 was. 
---
If that’s not a clear indication that Bethesda is going downhill, then I don’t know what is. Now in saying that, Elder Scrolls 6. There’s a lot of factors that’ll make me decide to buy or not. Setting. RPG elements (are they Skyrim good or FO4 shit?) have to be taken into consideration. 
---
There’s no clear indication that ES6 is going to be a godsend, and at the way Bethesda has been dumbing down their games as of late, I can’t see it standing alongside their previous titles as good games. 
---
All of this. And some of the "bugs" people are complaining about are actually not bugs. Like everyone freaking out about "MY BULK IS BUGGED IT WON'T AUTO BREAK DOWN GAME UNPLAYABLE NOW," even though it says right in the patch notes that this was part of the update.
---
I agree regression are ridiculous in a AAA game, but anyone complaining about the TSE nerfs I couldn't care less about. As an avid Overwatch player who has had every one of his mains systematically nerfed into the ground for the sake of "balance," I've come to expect these kinds of changes to multiplayer games, especially in the first year.
---
Since literally nobody that has any insight into the codebase has commented on what actually happened with the last patch, I'm not going to pretend to be outraged about Bethesda's "release process".
---
can’t you fabricate it again in the lair?
---
It's working for me fine.
---
Wow that is frustrating and I don't know what to recommend. Are you on the floor you're trying to place them?
---
Marsupial still works. I think someone reported that after drinking bird bones serum they could no longer marsupial jump so that may be the root cause of that issue.
---
Couldn’t agree more that base level repair frequency need to be decreased. If they’re nerfing damage we will be in battle longer causing more deterioration on our gear 
---
That's quite a stretch there from what I said.  You make a lot of assumptions.  I said looking for information, not good feedback.
---
Starts from the top, and the top is swamp monsters. 
---
I'm not complaining, I'm just pointing out the hypocrisy, actually I'm quite enjoying this lol
---
I’d be fine with that, I wouldn’t mind the game ending I’ll like Borderlands’ endgame where you’re incredibly powerful because you’ve worked for it
---
"10 unruly golfer ghouls". People must be really doing a great job at this one cause I've only been able to find those guys once out of 3 characters

I was talking about the link face put up about the delegates post , his/her title is incorrect , they aren’t deleting post that complain about the patch , they are deleting post that say “ goodbye never playing again” 
---
I’m telling you to use your brain because well, you’re not. 
---
Woah, at least hold out for IDthesda's Doom Eternal
---
Sorry it's been posted. I'll delete this now.
---
 Any plan that you started off with at the beginning of the game or from main quest rewards are bugged. Small water purifier, medium generator, etc.
---
Although I agree that the recent patch was handled poorly and that needs to be addressed, this post is full of misrepresentations and exaggerations.  If you are going to complain about someone else's work at least be factual.  I would not be surprised to see you making inflammatory click-bait videos on youtube in the near future.  Pathetic.
---
People are idiots is what the problem is. The UI is wrong about the bobby pin weight. Something that is easily testable by depositing and withdrawing them in your stash. but they have to complain about something. 
---
So you bang your wife, pop out a few kids and expect us to feel bad you cant play a video game?
---
"it sucks, but man, am I tired of listening to the numb ramblings of some of you."

They are probably kids who have no idea of how corporate strategy works.  Lunch boxes will come eventually.  They will offer them for free at the start for completing an event.  Then they will be tied to events and bought with atoms.  
---
The stimpak recipe might as well be replaced with T60 Helmet or Serum Recipe. It makes no difference. The fact that you chose to focus on stimpaks is your own fault - and clearly indicative of a larger problem when you've made more examples about new players that were inane.
---
Do I have to explain what an example is to you? Do I need to further explain why your example and further assumptions were bad?
---
I havent see a game this buggy since the remake of "Alone in the Dark"
---
There's also rooftops that have a little something. There's new locations to find and encounters to experience all over. Just have to wander.
---
I wasn’t on last night because my WiFi sucks and was chugging to install 3.6gb.  But I hear ya.  If an update takes away things you earned or grinded for hours for, got to be pretty frustrating.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that’s how FO76 was initially conceived, and that there’s a rough build of a co-op FO4 tucked away in Bethesda’s archives somewhere.
---
Thank goodness I don't wear any armor now. :)
---
Yes now I had to change my perks around and get back into power armor as that’s the only defense where I can stand the most damage is, as I also I spent all my caps on sentinel assasin armor and the hunting rifle to adapt to 2shot explosiv😂. 
---
Now I tried pvp with a 2shot explosive and looks like only my anti armor shotgun and my quad double barrel can kill people without power armor takes around a whole clip tho. I tried to pvp a level 220 as well to test it out and I actually survived a pretty decent amount and almost killed him tho he’s 90 level higher then me, he ended up whipping out the tse harpoon which killed me in a few shots (better than nothing I guess before the patch the harpoon gun was the only thing that could one shot me 
---
I'd wager your opinion on everyone shutting up and sending feedback to the official site is conspicuously absent from any of the patch note threads.
---
so even though you could break it down yourself, it makes it unplayable?
---
If your PS crafting stuff for low prices why buy a plan for 1 couch when I can do it for cheaper

Are you sure there is significant evidence of "most if not all of the Maryland studio was working on 76" beyond his word...?

Probably be on the verge of catastrophic despair.
---
yep always when going to watoga municipal center
---
I did not have time to read through your post. All I saw was WAHHHHHHHHHHHHH! WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Quit playing if you're not happy. Tell Mommy you want a new game since Easter is coming up. Maybe you can go back to Minecraft until then. 
---
Thanks you saved me having to read it.
---
Which event?
---
No, but a few hundred even couldn’t process a fraction of what hundreds of thousands can do. Come the fuck on.  
---
No. I’ve played every fallout game at launch.  
---
Yeah, but it’s obviously tied to not scrapping mods. Jesus Christ. You have to manually scrap bulk now. The horror.  
---
I am. And I will. It would be one thing if most of these complaints held up to any scrutiny, but they don’t.
---
Same for mass effect andromeda.  Social media shitstorm and abnormally caustic forums poisoned the well, game was abandoned by devs real early.
---
"Bethesda is banning modders so they can't work on mods so players, with their goldfish memories, will forget that typing to communicate is a thing if it's out of their sight for more than a minute. Bethesda taking advantage of gamers' poor grasp of object permanence!" Is basically the player base's chemtrails, lol
---
Lol, grind for three days for one of hundreds of plans.
---
This just in from Bethesda.. Todd is confirming water is still wet.
---
That analogy needs to be tweaked. It's more like a sick dog that you know can get better and will try to improve it, but instead of giving the care it needs you feed it chocolate
---
you cant get into the lair without the veil
---
I guess I don’t care what your opinion is to me the game isn’t a giant piece of garbage. I’ve got about 200 hours in the game which means I have more than gotten my moneys worth. I’m still having fun although I am starting to run out of things to do. You do you man if you don’t want to play then don’t play. But remember it’s just a game don’t take it so personal.
---
What, so they can be hamstrung by internal Bethesda politics? No thanks, let the modders stay where they are where they can develop in peace, and release when they have something good and ready.
---
That’s true and why I was hoping there’d be a video we could point to. Not a slam dunk but it’d be something. Changes like this tend to go on for awhile because devs can’t reproduce the problem reliably. 
---
I recall some posts recently that showed someone killing the SBQ solo with a stealth build and was amazing at showing how he could stay in caution the whole time, or easily get back into it with Escape Artist maybe?
---
I have a spare? 
---
#3 SPOT ON.
---
Yep!
---
Wouldn't it be nice if ... we included any of this IN the game!
---
Yah no matter what they go up a floor but it seems to only be certain items doing it, no big deal I just used a wall switch and it's working just fine 
---
If you put the economy in the player's hands, it's going to eBay. That's what *I'm* saying to *you*
---
Oh!! Didn’t try it! Sorry about that!
---
I did the SBQ last night with about the same number of people there and it took longer but was doable.
---
I'm not sure what everyone was using, but my experience using a TSE handmade (that was doing between 342 and 428 damage that's now been nerved down to 106 even with respec), and a Quad cap auto Tesla for the mobs and tagging (106 damage) was that after the event ended I got virtually no loot from anything including the mobs (literally got 7 rounds of 5.56 from the SBQ and nothing else)... not sure if it was a glitch or the new norm but it wasn't worth it after dumping about 3k rounds and breaking the handmade.
---
I love the fact you stopped at Bobbi pins and skipped #3.
---
Awesome, so not only do we still have to worry about accidentally spending caps on plans we already have, but now we'll also be wasting 3-4x as many caps in the process. QoL at it's finest lol. 
---
Does your head hurt when people ask you questions?
---
I 100% agree with you on this one.
---
I am seeing so much HATE towards this game, and that's what it is. It is HATE. But there isn't anything really about this game that I don't like. I don't enjoy the fact there aren't many NPC characters in the game that you can converse with and what not. But that can be easily overlooked. The game itself is stunning, the graphics are beautiful. Nothing like climbing to a tall mountain and staring out at the wilderness.
---
What happens when you fast travel to Harper's Ferry?

---
Sutton and Teapot didn't work for me but hey your mileage may vary
---
Marine Tactical helmet is quite common (I can sell you plan for it if you're on PC), Marine Armor Helmet is "developer room" item and shouldn't supposed to be in the game, at least for now.
---
Have you seen what you can get on eBay right now? What’s the difference?
---
Shhhh.. they’ll nerf it next
---
This happened because all the TSE players were enjoying the game like myself and didn't really feel the need to defend them and were ok with a minor nerf, no one actually did the numbers properly apparently. Because that's not what we got bethesda announced that they were reducing the effects of TS and E to 20% , while that seemed harsh I still thought my weapons would do around 500 damage per shot instead off over 1k. Which is still enough to too one shot most enemies except the really tough ones. However out of the blue bethesda nerfed the demo expert perk as well by 40%, what the actual fuck. So now my shotgun does 260 damage instead of the 1300k it did before. I agreed with a nerf not a dumpstering. No one said much because we didn't really know how the damage was calculated or how much it would hit the guns. I expected to do 500 damage with all my perks I got half that. Not only that but you make weapons like the missle launcher and fatman more trash than they were before.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can check but I believe I have a second one
---
This! I can even put up with a few bugs early on if the game is good, but the issue here is that the game is unbelievably boring. I played for the first week and have had zero desire to even turn it on again to try. 
---
&gt; Sprint Cycles are not tightly coupled to release Cadence 
---
I agree. You don't have to release at the end of a Sprint. And you can release any story that is complete.
---
&gt; Sprint actually have nothing to do with releases 
---
Sprints give you a reference point in terms of capacity. It forces you to think about the time you have and weigh that against the time required to complete a set of stories.
---
Yes, you can release a story as soon as it is complete so long as you are thinking and delivering in terms of potentially shipable increments. The idea behind creating a box, is to refine the team's ability to consistently measure their delivery capacity as well as forcing the team to flesh out conceptually how they will be delivering what is asked. It forces the conversation early so that we don't get into the cycle of build-ask-rebuild-ask-rebuild-ask. If all you're doing is delivering every day and when you ship doesn't matter, then you might be better served by using Kanban. On a separate note, the delivery team is not working in isolation. The stakeholders involved typically want some kind of idea of when they're receiving what they asked for. The cadence of Sprints gives them an easy way to see what stories are waiting on deck (with priority), what is currently being worked on, and what is being released. This visual aid prevents long conversations around what is in and what is out and when things are being released (which doesn't actually help the team deliver more code). If these types of things aren't important or are not necessary, then Kanban would may fit your working model better.
---
Defend what? Have you tested the bobby pin weight? I deposited 100 of them in my stash and withdrew them. My weight did not change. The UI says 0.1 but the actual weight is less.
---
There is no proof shown previous dup options were reintroduced other then word of mouth. And there is no proof shown fusion core spawns have been reduced.
---
And the TSE guns nerf is people just complaining because they like their OP as shit weapons. 
---
Is a video of someone pre patch literally one shot killing a level 50 Mirelurk Queen and 2 shooting a level 65 Scorch Beast. 
---
I can't use my energy or explosive weapons yet.....how is this a thing.
---
It's a business decision. They knew they had a ton of remaining issues and they rolled out the update anyway. 
---
thanks but im on PC
---
Oh they aren't getting anymore of my money.  Just like EA didn't get my money for BFV or anthem and Blizzard isn't getting anymore of my money for WoW and Ubisoft isn't getting my for The Division 2.  The real culprit is you.  And me.  And everyone else who kept buying the games.
---
1.4k caps a day?  What the fuck are you selling
---
I'm on PS4. I have one for sale but I dont know what people are paying for them since the update
---
But its a M79 Grenade Launcher. It really shouldn't be as weak as it is at level 15. No matter what perks you run or not.
---
Maybe. I guess it comes down to if you enjoy playing the game enough to put up with it. 
---
A statement about what? I played the game yesterday after the patch for about 8hrs and didn't get d/c or crash. I'd say they finally did something good. Maybe you can sell your copy to someone and go play something else that also has it's own reddit forum so you can still bitch about it. 
---
"The only real difference I've noticed is that people can't just walk up and kill me in 2 shots anymore without me hitting back."
---
In my 200 plus hours, I've never had this happen to me.
---
Feel bad? Nah. You read to much into that one.
---
Also they “fixed” it by making a bunch of weapons useless. Always nerfs, never buffs.
---
I feel ya... Fortunately I didn't suffer from as many crashes as a lot of my friends, but just the lack of end game content paired with the absolute destruction of the entire economy from the dupe glitch is what has ruined the game. Definitely no coming back for me.
---
So to test if people are going to buy costumes with buffs, they add a costume with something that's hardly a buff. By only putting 15HP gained while in a team how would they know if they sold the buff or if tons of people thought it was rad as fuck to be The Unstoppables.
---
My theory makes more sense and requires less tinfoil for my hat.
---
Waiting for video
---
Because as soon as I saw Bobby Pins I knew exactly what kind of misinformed meme opinion I was reading. The 'Oh jeez it's only lockpicking items why the big deal' crowd who can't look past it to see the *reasons* it happened are far worse than the impact it had.
---
I bet I don't have the caps for it anyways. Haha
---
I noticed it made bird bones more floaty, but like an odd slight stepped descent. Curing Rad worms put it back to normal...
---
Exactly what I did and I have had no desire to even load it back up again.
---
As much as it makes me pissy for my own, earned weapons (rip decent sniper rifle) it is kinda nice that the people who paid IRL money are extra screwed.
---
So your saying the a non legendary version of same gun did 3 less damage, sounds like FUD.  The changes should still have a bit under 2x base.
---
I saw probably 10 different comments in the dumpster fire thread last night where people basically said that the extra step of having to break down their bulk before using it was "the last straw" for them. So they spent 500 hours grinding materials in a game, and then spent the extra time/mats to turn them into bulk, but for some reason breaking it down from bulk again is the last straw. Shrug.
---
Fuck it, I'm out. The only decent 3 star legendary I got out of about 160 hours game time was a 3 star explosive/stalkers/DR when reloading gatling gun, which has now been heavily nerfed. The rest has been weightless wood leg trash and nocturnal boxing gloves. Between the nerfs and the server stability, which is still absolutely fucking shocking I think I am done. I gave it a fair shot but to reduce the few rewards players have squeezed out of this game is a pisstake. 
---
Or just buy crafting service from another player. Or even better: buy one plan and sell crafting services for others and then develop your business. Game incentives you not to play single-player fallout
---
Yes I made use. That isn't in dispute. It was either use or scrap anyway and more wad to be scrapped that I could possibly have used 
---
Ok.  Let me see how many atoms total are available not including daily/weekly. Might take a bit for the math.
---
I am actually curious, and this may back up my arguement, or yours.  Who knows.  I am willing to check
---
If you're in a team and someone signs out, mutations seem to be suppressed.  This has been happening for weeks.  Also, they are suppressed when you send an invite.
---
Yeah this gun must be buffed, I only got one a day before the TSE nerfs, now this gun is weaker than a Pipe type gun, absolutely useless by now.
---
I already said that I think this game cost very little to produce (sunk costs) and very little to maintain. This was a Fallout 4 port. Except for voice acting the game itself required very little development. 
---
Companies don’t factor in historical sunk costs into decision making. 
---
They could make the game F2P which I am fine with. A F2P after they fox the issues could make this a cash cow for them.
---
Yeah, that’s what I am reading now too. It’s such a shame. Thanks for taking the time to summarize all the horrible issues.
---
Before the patch was an EZ yea to say.   Post patch, i have to say wait for another update before u consider buying.  
---
Sounds to me like you really should uninstall. That will show Bethesda who's boss! Better yet, after you uninstall it, reinstall then uninstall again! They will be shaking in their shoes and probably make you the new manager. Then you can remake the game in your distorted image! Win win!
---
i can't find the page i used but i found a site through googling a while back that walked you through changing a ton of settings in the nvidia control panel that may also have helped. Good luck. 
---
someone somewhere certainly can make a change. The "omg i bet the devs think just like us but its managers making everything suck" posts are silly, if that was the case then negative posts calling them incompetent only help. They saw this game vastly undersold previous titles, got No Mans Sky tier press, and now the community is fed up as well. 
---
Good because I want to give the endagerol syringe a go. Now I need to google the karma syringe lol.
---
Thanks mate.
---
I enjoy the game when it works.... Not when I have to do workarounds because patches keep getting pushed without proper testing.
---
Upvote. I’m tired of the I quit post . Just quit no one cares . It’s not like your making a life changing announcement . 
---
Opposite for me, gotta get much more directly involved with everything again like when I was lower level.  Last night was the most fun I've had playing in a while - RIP TSE's, hello new grind.
---
Sell to players
---
It’s been obvious SBs and the SBQ especially have far too much HP and/or DR or too much damage reduction. I’m not 100% what it is, but there it is. Removing the crutch that TSE was now lets us see that the SBQ is unreasonably tough.
---
Btw I’m assuming all 13 players present in your example were pulling their weight and not hiding in the shed or using melee and lollygagging till she landed.
---
So they need to fix this. Enemy HP over all is too high(especially SBs and SUPER especially the SBQ), equipment durability is too low, especially energy and heavy weapons. If any specific weapon is weak as a joke someone please feel free to mention it.
---
Bethesda is gonna have to resolve all this eventually because this affects the overall fun factor of the game, and it gets worse the longer you play a character, not better.
---
Worse than I though. I can’t cook out in the wild unless I unbundle my wood. I can’t repair weapons/armor out in the wild unless I unbundle my mats ahead of time or access a stash somewhere and carry the bundles to be scrapped. Completely ruined the flow of the game for me. I’m done until they fix this.
---
Yep, I saw the deep pocketed marine armor for 2500 at a vendor and then found behind a level 3 locked door
---
I have no doubt that the changes they intended to introduce were tested, but it appears that the regression testing either did not occur, or was botched at some point.
---
Please. Literally the topic.
---
I am one 100% saying that. Go craft a level 50 hunting rifle,put a hardened receiver in it and look at the damage,its 160. My TSE handmade says 163. Both with full rifleman and demo perks.
---
It seems like a weird choice, there are so many other games that would be much better suited for PvP style play. 
---
Cool. Can I have your stuff?
---
The game is so unfinished that no one would ever NOT play on the beta server. So then the beta server would just be the live server but also with even less incentive to fix bugs or make the game work right. Everyone would just play there, then every bug would get forgiven as "it's beeeeta" until it ported to the 'live' server no one used 6 months later or whatever
---
Same. I tried. I really tried. But there's no redeeming this game. There's no redeeming Bethesda, either. 
---
I am honestly grieving for a developer whose products I have loved. 
---
Yeah, that's my thoughts on it too
---
Don't forget random perks that aren't equipped activating lol
---
Likeness rights!
---
Ran ok for me the first week as well...but it's boring as hell, so I stopped playing and have had no desire to try again. Really hurts since I would say that Fallout is in my top 3, if not number 1, series of all time.
---
Lol.
---
Right next to a post praising the game.
---
Get off your high horse.
---
They will be reliant on atom shop purchases to keep things rolling at a certain point. Losing all your players in the first few months is gonna make it a lot harder. 
---
You are discounting games that revolutionized mmos and were trend setters. 
---
Saying people don’t game like that anymore is ridiculous. Check out r/classicwow
---
I dont think its possible for them to list all the bugs, which is why they havent released a list. This is why Beth games require mod support &amp; they would be spending their time better working on that. Let the community fix bugs &amp; add new content as they have with every recent title before.
---
Which serums?
---
Lost. You lost interest.
---
Yeah thats the one, the tactical one :)
---
Yeah iam on PC but not on very often because of work. But do you know where the plan is suppose to spawn? 
---
You say one bad thing about the game and you are downvoted like crazy. Or you mention you want PvP.
---
Well, at least EA fixed their game before they abandoned it. It's still tons of more fun than FO76. 
---
I would love to see your play style of a pack of ghouls took you down heh
---
I really want to return soon but all the r/all posts I see about it do not give me hope.
---
Shitposting threads get stickied?  Funny, I don't see a single "I quit" or This game sucks" or "TSE sucks now" post stickied.  
---
Try again
---
What’s the difference in what your doing and what they’re doing?  Your in the sub clogging up good info with your Rant!  Why do you feel entitled to tell anyone anything?  Best thing you can do is shut your complaint hole. Your not special, there’s no reason you can post and others can’t. Take my downvote and like it you self entitled child!
---

---
Had a dude shot at me with fire bullets ? And when I didn’t react he destroyed my house with his gun in like 3 hits . The whole house . 
---
Sea Of Thieves has their pioneer program, works great (I'm a Pioneer). Bethesda needs to do the same thing.
---
I’m on it!
---
It's just that they should've nerfd the perk on the gun itself versus killing the perks. Plus they didn't nerf other builds that you can do even more damage with than the tse. Also, if you're going to fuck a perk card, you might as well refund my perk cards so I can redistribute them, since the perks no longer work the same way when I invested points into them.
---
They did not hype this patch at all, they didn’t even release the patch note till the day the patch came out. 
---
I mean I've been using this exact same lock picking mini game for 8(?) Years now, I carry 10 and have never dropped below 9
---
You can attack the CAMP, or used to be able to, prior to killing them.
---
An ancient engine and tangled legacy code is a "solid foundation?"
---
I'm truly sorry for these whiny crybaby gamers. I for one am happy with the game having 519 hours logged in. 
---
Your point about the goodwill they're burning really hits it home. A lesser company found guilty of the absurd bullshit these dudes pull would have crashed and burned by now (the dudes who made the ark pirate game come to mind), but these people man.... Customers love this franchise so damn much and have defended em since FO3, but right now they're just laughing in the faces of those that go up to bat in the name of having faith in bethesda. Saddening. 
---
You think it's shattered. I still love the game and play every day for 8hrs. Go play something else.
---
Many of these exploits/bugs have been known for years. It IS their fault for allowing those exploits and glitches into a day one game when they already knew they existed.
---
But why is it not powerful? "Heavy Weapons" are Heavy Weapons and should be treated as such, so this is confusing me very much right now as to why Bethesda isn't making Heavy Weapons act like their namesake.
---
I understand the duping and that is unfortunate but there are still a much larger section of the player base that earned theirs through more means. If they use a GUID for dropped legendaries then the server could determine if an item is a duplicate and remove the object. There are a number of ways to do this and since that the number of players in each instance of the world is limited, it shouldn't be a large burden on the server either.
---
This patch exposed the future path of this game.
---
I'm hoping off the hamster wheel now while I can.
---
Err, yes, I see I provided redundant info. Greg, hah! Gotta learn the names.
---
Some of the posts are funny though! Especially from people complaining about having to use stimpacks now because they can no longer one shot critters.  
---
Someone posted last night he had to take cover from a SB and use stimpacks because his TSE lever action no longer two shotted SBs. He even had to repair his weapon!!  Oh the agony!!!!
---
It's happening. Maybe to do with the amount of items in stash when scrapped 
---
I'm going to assume they patched an earlier code branch because they had too many changes in the current branch due to the March updates. They still need to roll this patch back.
---
I totally agree with you. Even though there is a lot of negativity surrounding this community I feel like there are also a lot of people (myself included) who genuinely love this game. Maybe there should be a fo76 positivity subreddit?
---
Just a joke about furry versus fury.
---
I’m afraid to think of what this makes a bobby-pin heavier than in the game.
---
They made multiple mentions of this patch since the 1st week of the month
---
No one used those to begin with because they were useless pre-nerf. People are using it as a feeding frenzy to fuel dismay about the TSE nerf.
---
Yes because I love needing dozens of rounds to take down one minor enemy so everytime I get back to camp I have to repair my gun and make another couple hundred rounds of ammo. Its almost as if people used those guns because in late game people dont want every living thing to be a bullet sponge. If PVP was the issue, then nerf it simply against other players.
---
Thanks for youre answer, i been there many many times but never seen the plan for the helmet, just for arms. But i guess i keep trying :)
---
Thanks for the offer but iam on PC.
---
Actually with this increase in prices I could forsee "service shops/vendors" becoming more common. Why spend nearly 6k on a plan for the 51b jetpack which I'm only going to use a few times when I can pay caps to have someone do it for me for a nominal fee? I'd be willing to pay 6k caps for someone to craft a laundry list of mods for a single PA suit but 20k? Even maxing out the vendors daily would still take 2 weeks and that's one suit.
---
...because they already have our money, so who cares if you move on.
---
You think having an issue with the fact that a patch reintroduced old issues is flimsy. Says it all really.
---
I'll lay it out for you, in business reintroducing old problems in new code releases is the second biggest fuck up you can make, regardless of the impact of the fuck up. The only thing worse is a fuck up that exposes you to actual litigation. Why? Because it completely destroys customer confidence that you have any control over what you are doing.
---
They fixed that. I used carnivore serum and other serums i added before and after work perfectly.
---
Oh shit, guys! u/Stone_Dead_Forever played for 8 hours! We’re done here. Pack it up. 
---
You don’t get every bit of info in patch notes. You get what is relevant to you as a player. How they fix bugs is irrelevant. All the player cares about is either “fixed” or “not fixed”. U fortunately players got ahold of a rumor and have run with it.
---
Yesterday I was dying for no reason, right around the same area (Poseidon). I didn't get any indication someone was one-shotting me, and I went from full health to none very suddenly... more than once.
---
I worry I'm getting to this point soon. Bethesda I say this with a lot of love in my heart: Get your shit together. 
---
So this is literally my only problem with this game. I post mostly about this game and I trade with other players from Reddit. Why is everyone so "hur durr" about this? Why does it seem like almost no one is willing to take a step back and look at this from a different perspective. Look at it from a corporate perspective and what do you see? I see a wide funnel that leads to microtransaction buffs. 
---
Lol, enjoy getting your stuff stolen, although that would be a good way to get your hands on a decent legendary and spread some salt stealing from players.
---
The double nerf to base explosive weapons has gotten so bad that I am now switching all my SPECIAL points to a stealth commando build. You want to know what’s sad?
---
NON-LEGENDARY Level 45 auto pistol outperformed the following:
---
With maxed out Demo and Gunslinger perks:
---
TSE western revolver
---
Bunker Buster 
---
Daisy Cutter 
---
SAD. 
---
No... this community is just a group of masochists who just keep doubling down on a horrible game, that isnt getting any better.
---
Can you find me the patch note where they say that bobby pin weight is going back up?
---
I played classic WoW and it wasn't as frustrating or annoying as FO76. 
---
If they’re okay with bringing previous bugs back into this patch, I’d say that time is now. 
---
I’ve found two in the Cranberry Bog.  One was on top of the steakhouse, the other in a flooded bunker SE of the steakhouse. 
---
Before this patch, I had just the tiniest sliver of faith left in Bethesda.
---
It's gone now.
---
They can earn it back by doing a Jan 29 Patch Post Mortem where they explain what went wrong and what they're doing to fix it.
---
Beyond that? Fuck 'em. They don't deserve any of our time or attention with the shit they're pulling.
---
I purchased the inspector outfit and vow never to team with fatdan1 so we wont have paid to win ! 
---
TLDR; YOUR PATCH MESSED UP ALL MY HOARDING, NOW I HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME MORE FREQUENTLY TO BE A TRADER" I wish i could swaddle you and rock you to sleep.
---
Nn diablo 3 they just buff all the sets into oblivion, they want players to run speed 150's ;) In F76 they didn't do any buffs at all, only nerfs.
---
Yup, there's a bunch of areas that as a lower level I rushed through because I was focused on completing a mission or was avoiding enemies.  Went back to Morgantown, walked the tram line and was delighted to find all the rooftop stuff I had missed when I went through there earlier.  
---
Plenty of feedback in that thread. And remember:
---
&gt;directly emailing Bethesda will make sure they get the feedback, and not clog this sub with the same stuff
---
This is why I don't normally pre-order. Esp this type of game from Bethesda no less.
---
I've already done that. I believe my incident number was 1,000,000,000,000,001.
---
m8 when modders can do in days what it takes them months to do as a AAA studio with a huge staff, there is certainly a problem. When things the community has been begging for for months or even years doesnt get fixed but other stuff nobody cares about gets tossed in, theres a problem.  
---
And lets not even talk about their communication when every Inside The Vault is "Were fixing some bugs, and new content planned in the next month or two!" and nothing else.
---
I tried crafting it but it requires the blade of bastet to craft it . Not quite sure what to do
---
Flower picking doesn’t work either 
---
Nope, thanks. :)
---
Oh, hells no!!
---
Yeah this happened to me just now as well. I started a new character and was trying to put sights on a 44. I put stuff into my stash and then it worked... No clue.
---
Wut?
---
Ohh.. I didn't know this. I loved this addition but I play as a second character to my husband's first since we only have one computer. I haven't noticed if it says I know any of his plans. 
---
Nah, didn't happen
---
&gt;What would make you happy as a player to make up for the recent (and let’s face it - overall since launch) issues with the game with patches, bugs, exploits, etc.
---
having devs that give a single shit.
---
Most of the time, I sneak with an instigating lever action rifle. During prime date, I switch to heavy weapons and All Rise.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egaWisiL694
---
They've got something lined up for PvE players for March, we haven't heard any details yet though. 
---
Yeah lets make all weapons capable of taking down end game bosses in seconds so we can puff out our chests and boast about how skilled we are at the game because that is such fun.  /s
---
It’s not really that much..
---
Fusion Cores are spawning at a normal rate for me.
---
Did you actually test this or are you just parroting what you hear?
---
This patch is garbage but you don't have to make shit up.
---
Sorry, can’t agree completely with that. With grenade launcher maybe, but not all heavy weapons.
---
It's stupid for Bethesda to not give them enough support tho considering it is officially a Bethesda Game Studios dev. It hurts their reputation.
---
I was just in Whitespring, non-blast zone and didn't think anyone was near me on the map.  Not in a group.
---
That is an unintended bug of the new patch...a bug. Not an intentional change. Calm down I am sure it will get fixed. Then you can carry all the Bobby Pins you want
---
Also items that are in bulk are not recognised and need to be scrapped before you can use them for repairs.....
---
Invitations, but yes I agree completely.
---
They have not shown any signs they can or at least that they even care.
---
It can definitely be done. And after yesterday’s patch I’d def say they could use a lot of outside QC. I def don’t think someone who actively develops and works on this game is playing it the same way we do and so things will keep slipping past them unnoticed. Some outside perspective before a patch goes public would save them TONS of headache and backlash.
---
Oh thats a new spot i never checked! Thanks for the tip! Much appricitated :)
---
Most underrated comment. 
---
You could have started an alt if you wanted that.
---
How has it broken? I run a stealth build and haven’t noticed any change.
---
My TSE Prime Gat broke in less than 4 minutes of sustained fire at the Queen yesterday lol
---
Because all the other bonus damage affixes had some kind of restriction.  Instigating only worked if the target wasn't damaged, Nocturnal only worked at night, Troubleshooter only worked vs robots etc.  Those buffs were also only 30% (except Instigating but you only got it once per critter).  Two shot was a 100% damage buff against every critter in every situation for every shot.
---
Any recent quotes about 76 from Todd Howard ? Pete Hines ? Any recognizable name ?
---
I don't know that there's anything that will make me a steady player of FO76 at this point. I finished the in-game content and if they add more, I might start the game again to see what it is, but otherwise, I'm done. When Starfield is released, I'll be interested to see how it looks. But until then? I have other games to play.
---
Here's the problem with that. During beta, I did not freeze. Never. This issue started after Beth did the very first patch. It isn't my settings. 
---
With the TSE Nerf all they did was nerf 2 effects out dozens that can on guns. They nerf'd no actual guns, even the nerf to demolition expert only the explosive effect when it comes to ballistic weapons. 
---
So with that in mind, what needs to be added to make guns do damage like melee does? Not something to just scale the damage; what is unarmed doing that can't be done with gun mods or current weapon perks that should be added?
---
Please do
---
No. Do not get this game. Bethesda does not deserve your money. I will never recommend this game to anyone I know after the current patch, it created more bugs and punished the players who put in a lot of work to become OP.
---
Or just start doing your job sometimes finally
---
Na but they are pushing it a bit lol.
---
I check there too! Thank you :)
---
Wow, that sounds logical...
---
Logic &gt; Emotion?
---
Xoxo 
---
If it's an early release of a patch before it goes live on standard servers, then I'd consider it "early". Regardless of how long the game has been out.
---
No, but it does use plastic, I think the increase was the addition of the plastic to the mix...
---
There is no proof of steal when trading. It’s a myth
---
Ah my bad, well I had about 245ish armour so still annoying.
---
Also seriously did I get downvoted just for that?
---
Stop stealing my post =(
---
Are you kidding me............. 
---
Respond to flare guns or if you say my name three times in a mirror real fast. 
---
every normal company does that with their multiplayer games
---
Lol. Is it too late for a refund? 
---
We all get a board and a wooden left leg armor and then we’re all even.
---
Well shit

I doubt FO76 is going to revolutionize mmos. It is what it is...a Fallout 4 port with new voice acting, FO4 mods, and multiplayer.
---
They took an aged single player game and tried to make it multiplayer. Considering that I think they did fine and I enjoy the game.
---
If I didn’t...I wouldn’t play it. 
---
I definitely would not be crying on forums
---
But then Fallout 76 developers wouldn't have any time to play Fortnite because that would require more work.
---
Yeah, I do that. Ghouls are like sitting ducks for sneak build.
---
All I can say is give up man and hope they keep their promise if the bag revives and isn't crap junk canvas bag unlike what was originally shown. I was in your same situation I kept updating the ticket it kept getting neglected I even tweeted support and they asked for my ticket number and then once looking at it basically sent a link which in short said that I was already given the 500 atoms even though I never got it/email for getting it. I got feel customer service is told to ignore the 500 atoms request to cheap out on giving us the free currency since they have to send us the bags. And none of the outrage about bag gate is there for Bethesda skipping on the 500 atoms.
---
The point of a weight limit is so we don’t hoard everything we find. 
---
They should really hire you on as a consultant. Thanks, Commander.
---
Xbox one,  cyclophile... so it looks like I can't use bulked scrap without scrapping it now... please fix. Also... I've been disconnected twice now within 20 min. 
---
Radaway until your rads are all gone. If you have the starched genes perk be sure to unequip that first. 
---
I have no issue with complaints. This is the internet and a free forum please, by all means express yourself. My only I issue is the the people stamping their feet, screaming "IM RUNNING AWAY" like a 4 year old who was told the can't have a cookie. 
---
I really would like to know, how many devs are still working on F76. They probably already shifted 90% of the devs away to other titles. Feels like that.
---
You do realize that most people are not mad because of the TSE nerf, right? 
---
Melee builds require fewer perks to be effective. They get more out of their perks than guns, like Incisor (75% armor penetration, all melee) vs Tank Killer (36% armor penetration, rifles only). They get a 30% DPS boost and 60% weight reduction combined in a single perk, and it encompasses all melee weapons. They don't need to worry about ammo, be it crafting, running out, or weight. No downtime via reloading either. Their damage scales off Str, which ranged weapons do not get at all. They get way more damage with no downtime, no ammo management, and way less investment compared to ranged weapons. The only thing that is comparable is stealth sniping, which requires even more investment, only shines in solo play, and is very bad against enemies that are alerted for any reason or beefy enemies especially SBQ.
---
Even their biggest weakness, getting in close, can be mitigated by a perk that falls into their main stat anyways and reduces all melee damage taken by a large 45%. For some of the more deadly enemies, getting in close is already preferable anyways, since the enemy taking a swing at you is less detrimental than some of their ranged options. 
---
I’ve seen suggestions from the community for the implementation of a public test server for PC.
---
This could be a step in the right direction from a dev standpoint to avoid issues such as the patch rollback.
---
A player only has \~300HP, tons of weapon/perk combos can do well past 1000 damage, Just a normal weapon and a normal sneak attack head shot can do it without anything special. Lots of people have significantly less than 300 Hp as well. 
---
Or pay people to test your game before publishing it. Gamers arent free testers.
---
Unironically as well...
---
I have to stop myself from commenting this on every single one of these posts lol

I’ve had 4-5 encounters with the vendor bot here, only 2 times at the Charleston station with a lot more hopping. I think the random factor is the same - just that so many people camp near the Charleston station and ruin the spawn.

Question for you, if you have pacifist on does the arc chain to players, and if so does it damage?
---
Is there anything there? Locations exist but there's nothing special about them.
---
Its always working, I love this mutation. 
---
Unintended bug? But you said
---
&gt;There was probably a reason. Something may not have been fixable and they rolled it back to a point where it can be fixed.
---
If they rolled it back they should know that rolling it back undoes changes? Right?
---
So either they didn't know. Or they did and didn't put it in the patch notes. They can't have knowingly rolled back a change and not know the change would be reverted.
---
I didn't have a TSE.
---
Why did my fun get nerfed?
---
They have already used hotfixes to address issues so I am pretty sure they how to do that and when to do it given their own internal  constraints.
---
I am well aware that bulking doesn't really save weight. but it's a cleaner way to organize what is currently in the stash by bulking everything and selling the excess.
---
I bulk to 10 of each resource. Exception for plastic, aluminum, adhesive, springs, screws, gears. ballistic fiber I'll horde till 50 bulk. For resources that can be sold individually: ultricite, black titanium, anticeptic, nuclear material, abestos, silver scrap, gold scrap, circuits, crystal shards etc., I keep 100.
---
Last night I scrapped near all my bulks and it shifted the weight slightly by a couple pounds. At this point I'm trying to assess how much of what resource to keep and which to bulk to sell. 
---
Oh wow. You brought up litigation. Lol
---
Like literally nothing.
---
Like an entire slot of the end game bosses' loot table is totally and completely worthless. You can't even sell it to a vendor. It is drop-on-the-ground garbage.
---
Really think about that for a second.
---
That's fucking hilariously bad.
---
I forgot I didn't have my gunsmith on, my 200% TES gat broke before I killed 8 supermutants at harpers. That is out of control.

This is the problem with parent companies and subsidiaries etc. The buck can be passed along and the profits keep rolling in. That's why I think you have to see things as the publisher or parent company as having responsibility. Like Take-Two, Zenimax, etc. but most people probably don't even recognize those names.

I don't use an ultracite receiver, either.

I have the same problem. Made a mistake of selling a \~5k gun for 20k nuka colas instead, because you know id have to manually open them to get caps. Did the glitch to deposit them in my stash and would grab them when needed. Now I cant grab any amount of them from my stash. Not 1 not 1000.
---
I hope that this teaches you not to get so emotionally invested in a thing that it blinds you to the reality of it.
---
This patch didn't make the game shit. The game has been shit. You're just pulling your head out of  Bethesda's ass and gaining some perspective for the first time.

Meanwhile, I've never had a truly gamebreaking bug in 76, but after the patch? I can launch to menu, but when trying to load into a server, CTD.

The stats are all over the place. Bugged perk cards, bugged serums, bugged diseases.

Almost impossible to work out why charisma is -1 or why marsupial suddenly doesn't work.  Sick of fighting to play this bug fest of a game.

It’s clear that wasn’t their only reasoning.  They aren’t automatically nerfing every popular perk.  Chill.
---
It definitely has taught me. 
---
And yeah, you’re right. The patch is what made me realise how shit the game is. 
---
Was your email in spam and did you see the atoms added to your account or did you have to input like a code to get your atoms? Because I'm wondering if mine ended up in spam and got deleted since spam gets deleted after 30 days and its been almost 2 months now.
---
Hey that's not true, they buffed my stash from 400 to 600!  So there....... okay that's like legit the only good thing that has happened.. and it wasnt even that good.
---
Here we go again…
---
&gt;The main problem of this patch is not that it has nerfed something. This upset some people, but most are angry for another reason. The problem is that this patch is installed on top of the previous version of the game. They rolled back everything that was patched with previous patch. People are angry because it's crazy. Seriously, this incident is unimaginable for a large company.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; If we assume that they use the version control system, where there are concepts of "branches", then it could have been like this: someone began to implement yesterday's patch fixes long before the previous one was released, in its own branch, without merging master to his branch all this time. And it was the version from this branch that went into release. If so, then these guys definitely should learn how to use VCS. 
---
I am having the same issues with my guns breaking much more quickly and power armour not spawing on me with fast travel. And legendary not dropping any loot and cant find them. Wth Bethesda...
---
Did the fight, area seemed weirdly un-nuked, got no loot at all, xbox. GG Beth.
---
it's a bad game, that's for sure.
---
I absolutely love Fallout 3, NV and 4. I played this with a friend of mine until about level 35. And then one night were playing, we kept becoming invisible, the enemies lagged the game so horribly, the enemies just rished me and there would just be 10 enemies flowing at me, the guns weren't hurting anything, my grenades  weren't doing anything, i was getting killed by players in one shot, my CAMP would despawn stuff, the game crashes.
---
Never playing again.
---
TSE Lever action (8 rifleman, 3 tank buster, 5 demolition expert) went from 780-ish to 200.  With a 2.5X on sneak, that's still 500 damage.
---
Explosive Executioner Black powder rifle went from about 750 to about 300.
---
TSE Dragon is now 530-ish.  I got it after the patch so I don't know what it was
---
So now it's a crime to have ever used one? Get out of here.
---
Uh... Didn’t you just say your kids are having a snow day and you don’t have the time to play the game?

The problem is they are stuck in the middle, they didn't go nearly far enough with the survival aspects to call it a survival game, it's way too easy to get food and materials, it's not a challenge that creates fun intense game-play so it becomes a chore. They wanted to appease both the survival people and the casual people, and ended up with a system that's bad for both.
---
The dupers will be selling boards on eBay for $30 a dozen.

My only advice is to trade using desks and such. I've moved stuff around by going on a "friend's" server, placing stuff in a cabinet then relogging with another character to the same server. Never had stuff disappear that way.
---
&gt; LMAO, you claim you know better, but don't actually do anything but blame Bethesda for your experience while claiming I must be young and a drone. I don't pay someone for the 5 minutes it takes me to remote into a computer from my phone and restart a server or whatever simple tasks I need to do.
---
LOL wait you can use your phone?  It's really incredible that you think that's impressive or sets you above...anyone.  Where does the money you use to pay for that phone come from?  Who owns the servers you're remoting into?  Oh shit someone pays you?  Someone...like...me?  Uh oh.  I really hope you're a child because that's really the only excuse for such ignorance.  I'm blaming Bethesda because it's their game and their servers.  I gave them money to play a game that looked fun in my spare time.  I didn't give them money for a disaster that crashes every couple hours.  I guess unlike you I have shit to do and don't have 4-12 hours of free time to play video games so that time is more valuable to me.
---
&gt; You have proven you know nothing when you talked about servers not being restarted for "months or years"😂 It is I who am not going to waste time on you. You clearly just want to be the old man shaking his fist at the sky "damn you Bethesda, damn you!"
---
It's really telling that your fix for everything is load balancing or AWS or just restart the servers more often.  You don't really know this stuff or how it's designed, you just work around it.  No wonder your uptimes are so low.  LOL "it is I who am not going to waste time on you" then proceeds to write several more paragraphs...holy shit get out of your shit floor tech gig and maybe try stand-up.  You don't know how to fix stuff, you just turn everything off and on again and pat yourself on the back for being really super smart!  Again, Bethesda made the game so I feel pretty justified being angry with them for not delivering.
---
&gt; The game isn't broken, I've been playing with friends since the beta with very few issues. My friends rebuilt their database when they had issues and most went away.
---
That's nice.  I tried to play 2 hours ago and got dumped to the desktop about 5 minutes after I set up a workshop.  This is after a patch that supposedly fixed these things.  But somehow this is all my fault.
---
&gt; But besides whining and crying, I don't know what you think you're accomplishing. What? Make the game look worse? There's plenty of YouTubers that get paid to try to convince people the game is bad. Then there's plenty of us who haven't had that experience, it's mostly fine from the beginning, and almost completely great to the majority of us now.
---
I know you're really hyped on your own bullshit but my OP was just that I want them to fix the base game before they add new modes and DLC.  You've really got an axe to grind though and I think the stuff you say is really funny/sad so I'm just stringing you along for the lulz.
---
&gt; But seriously, reexamine your life if you're sitting here trying to convince me and others who play this game daily that we can't be playing with no issue. You're wasting your time.
---
Not only am I not saying anything like that but you've got Beth's dick so far down your throat you spend the time you're not gaming defending a AAA that is obviously, objectively, broken.
---
&gt; The only thing Bethesda could really do to make my experience better is restart servers more often so they don't crash. Otherwise my friends and I are just waiting for new features or free dlc we know is coming. We'll still screw around a bit, we're just getting burnt out because we've got so many hours logged in this game, we've explored most of what's there, have every weapon we want, etc.
---
Again, it's really funny how your best idea is not to fix the problems-just reboot more often.  Even if this was a real solution why not send out an in game alert when the server needs to reboot like they do for scheduled downtime/maintenance?  Why not have a server browser?  It's almost like they didn't plan on rebooting several times a day.  LOL waiting for new features and DLC!  I know this is beyond your pay-grade but the public perception is that this game is an utter disaster and they can't even patch the game without breaking everything.  Not only has their post release schedule been upended but even if they wanted to, dropping DLC on the game would be a disaster.
---
&gt; But please, don't keep trolling the subreddit, you're not accomplishing a damn thing, just wasting other people's time scrolling through your comments no one cares about.
---
I made one comment in an old thread that was really tame.  YOU turned it into a diatribe about how stupid and angry you are.  Then I played you out because I think it's funny and you're easy.
---
Some people call me a revolutionary.
---
Really, I'm just jaded.
---
You should be glad they haven't doubled the range on the sonic blast or added a new 5 stage perk that reduces damage taken from sonic attacks 
---
Can I have you and your friends' stuff? I never had a TSE. Got any of those?
---
I understand those frustrations of having to repair weapons repeatedly. While I don't have an answer or better comment than this right now, I want you to know that I see this feedback.
---
Exactly. A bunch of armchair devs in here that don't have any clue how the process works. 
---
Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
Yeah but that's what they'd have to do if they don't want to nerf TSE.
---
Having either TS or E (perhaps E additionally nerfed a bit) might have been nice but that's not viable since TSE already exist en masse. Imagine the reaction if they took those away. And they had to fix TSE **fast** because it was preventing a huge playerbase from even considering to participate in pvp. So I can understand their train of thought - slap it down hard and then slowly work on finetuning it.
---
Perhaps they have overdone it for now (I can't tell because none of the changes affect my build) but I honestly think it's a bit early to say so. I have my doubts whether all the people screaming murder right now have actually properly tested the balancing changes yet. 
---
&gt; In F76 they didn't do any buffs at all, only nerfs. 
---
Charging Barrels mod: Increased the Gatling Laser’s damage bonus from the Charging Barrels mod.
---
Hmm...
---
gt phishntrips
---
I'll have to try. 
---
Interplay sold it to them.  Interplay retained the rights to an MMO version of the IP, but since they were doing nothing with it, Zenimax sued (and won) to get the rights to the MMO because anything Interplay might haphazardly release would hurt their brand.
---
What has been really bothering me is power armor stations.  Why is it so difficult to find a plan to build my own?  I have to stop any progress to find a power station, kill all the enemies at said location, waste more ammo sometimes, just to see if I have the resources to fix my armor.
---
And surprise surprise.  Most of the time I don't have the 1000 steel or 14000 springs I need to repair one piece.
---
They don't want to invest in content, so like most MMOs these days they're having us make our own

Are you new here? This same BS has been going on since launch. No, BGS is not going to shoot themselves in the foot by catering to the people that flock to forums to complain they don't like what was done. Yes, I am also upset and am not happy with the way the game is going. Yes, I am also upset they seem to have their heads up their collective bottoms. However, I am not so naive to think they owe me any kind of statement or apology. I chose to buy their product and it's up to me to decide if it is still enjoyable. If it's not, it's up to me to leave it be and spend my money elsewhere. You are more than welcome to say what you dislike and what you would like to see changed. You do not have the right to act like their product is your own and that you are entitled to dictate what actually happens with it.
---
Seriously, I wonder about most of you on here when changes to a video game cause this much angst, stress, anger and sadness. 
---
Yes, and No, respectively. 
---
Chains to (and off of) them, doesn't hurt them. Pacifist mode is a must when using tesla rifles.
---
Well, i have to admit that i haven't played D3 in a long while (\~2 years) but back then it was a constant buff and nerf of any class and/or set (except demon hunter of course, they've always been op ;-) ).
---
Thank you for the thoughtful insight on this. 
---
Don't get me started on Dogmeat and the lack thereof.
---
Haven't played it yet but it seems like they brought back a lot of issues they moved away from older Bethesda games. Bullet sponges? Weapons degredation? Why? There's nothing fun about that.
---
To clarify my TSE is a handmade with a hardened receiver, my lever action also has a hardened receiver. Max out riflemen perks and explosive perk my handmade now does 160 DPS vs 580 before patch. My lever action only has executioners so does not effect base damage. It’s doing 172DPS so the most powerful legendary gun in the game is out done by a regular lever action. 
---
I agree TSE was way overpowered and hardly used it other than fighting scorched queen. But they went too far, they cut more than 80% of buffs. I was ready too lose 50-60% power to rebalance. Melee builds can still do 1k dps how is this balanced?? 
---
Oblivion literally caught my wifes computer on fire. Those days were not all clear skies and roses either.
---
I've just realised this as well with my rifle build. I've had an unused all rise in my stash box and after the nerf the damage is very similar to my rifles and that's with the rifle perk cards loaded and no melee ones.
---
Oh look, "Just now"

---
It's great. They should have done this from the beginning.
---
I'll disagree a slight bit and say that I kinda like having the ability to reliably source some plans, but you're right about how it fucks over most players. Honestly, grinding for some plans felt ridiculous to me, especially considering that we had to run an economy ourselves. An economy, mind you, that I still believe is broken to a degree. But yeah, 1.5k in caps for a plan is way too high, especially for plans that are cosmetic in design 
---
Lol. Thank you but I'm fine, I have actually still been gaining rather than losing.

 &gt; Thank you for the thoughtful insight on this.

Developers are allowed to add items to their store while they continue developing their game. This doesnt mean development on other issues has halted. This isnt even an issue, just more ways for people to be dramatic on reddit. 
---
Solved! 
---
It was the mods. All better now. Thanks guys! 
---
Nope, was working on my base. Came up to me and took 1 shot and I died instantly. Im a level 101 I know how to play the game I don't know how people do that
---
They need to return White Knight to 90% (absolutely unnecessary nerf - if shit isn’t in line bring it up it down, nobody likes more material farming!) and bump Gunsmith up to 15% per level and have it reduce material costs of repairs by the same level.
---
Boom done. Now weapons last longer and material grind is less annoying, player satisfaction increases and they only need to address energy and heavy weapon durability individually instead of every single gun.
---
As far as I’ve seen, melee weapon durability is ok. 
---
I had this issue pre-patch so I don't think the issue has anything to do with the patch.  The problem most likely is certain enemies that ignore the stealth mechanics.  Specifically Molerats and Rad Scorpions.  If you agro either of these then stealth isn't used at all. 
---
My guess is that what is happening is that a Molerat (most common enemy that causes this problem) is agroed on you, you move far enough away that it stops chasing you but doesn't forget about you which causes you to stay in ghost caution forever.  OR they agro on you, are chasing you but because of some error in game logic never attack/surface either because you never are on the ground where they can surface to attack you or some other such thing.  
---
Note, I have also had enemies which are 'normal' keep causing me to be in caution or danger even after I was clearly away from everything.  More often than not though if I stopped moving entirely for a minute then the caution would slowly fade.  
---
The whole stealth thing has been buggy for a while.  Also Robots are MUCH harder to hide from than other normal things.  Again Fuck Molerats and Rad Scorpions.  Fuck them in the head with a bullet.  Twice.  
---
I stand by that statement. I don’t know how or why Bobby Pins got changed back. I think it was probably unintended consequence of the most recent patch.
---
It was fixed and it will be fixed again. The week or two weeks to fix it has no real importance to me. I don’t hoard Bobby Pins. 
---
If they did a rollback and that caused the issue then so what. It is funny bit not game breaking. What is even funnier are the players that are having such a huge issue dealing with it. 
---
It is bobby pins. 
---
When I load in a see an expertly crafted environment with decent combat and it’s engaging enough that I frequently have “I should’ve gone to bed a few hours ago.”  
---
Perfect? No.
---
After all its can be Anthem of BETHESDA. 
---
Sofi Tukker - Fuck They
---
:(((
---
Lucky break is fantastic. Just spend a bit of time wandering the forest with a melee weapon getting hit by low level mobs, and everything is repaired beautifully.
---
&gt; That video is pre patch, 
---
I know I was showing the insane level of damage that was being done pre patch. 
---
&gt; That's a nice analysis. But the nerf was still too much. If my lever rifle is now doing 234 with all associated perks, that's all 3 rifleman perks at rank 3, rank 5 of demo expert, so a regular lever rifle can't possible be doing that much damage, right? 
---
Regular rifles are not effected by the reduction of explosive and second shot hit. In fact the reduction actually makes other weapons much more viable.  TSE is still better but the gap between the two is smaller so a regular one isn't a complete and total waste of time.
---
This seems to be the logic people are ignoring in favor of complaining about their guns being reduced in damage.  TSE was OP as shit compared to regular guns making all other guns near worthless. The only way to address that is to buff all other guns which leads to massive power creep. Or dial back the over powered guns to prevent the power creep and stop players literally 1-2 shot KOing end game mobs.
---
If it can do that to end game mobs how much damage could it do to players if PvP actually becomes a thing like people have been complaining about?  Instant kill guns are fine for a single player game but an online multiplayer it is bad and online PvP it is even worse. 
---
If you have played any PvP games you know games do not allow a 1-2 hit KO weapon. And if they do have mechanics that can allow that they are very carefully controlled and limited.  You can't use your final smash as your main attack in Smash Bros. And in games like Destiny the heavy weapon ammo only spawns every couple of minutes in one location and only has 1 magazine load of ammo per pick up. And the Supers that you can use are time limited and requires kills and objectives complete to build up the charge. 
---
&gt; And to add on my super sledge does 187 with no perks, you see how that's not balanced.
---
Melee also requires point blank to hit. This means you can't avoid damage and use explosives without self harm.  That means in PvP I can shoot at you from a distance and you can't touch me until you get closer and as long as I keep backing up.
---
Because Melee requires point blank fighting which means you will be hit by ever round the NPC's fire you get a 5% bonus to melee damage per point of strength stat. Without it then it wouldn't be a viable build because you would take x2 the damage as players with guns for the same amount of damage given. 
---
And lets be honest here if you were going to fight a Mirelurk Queen level 50 would you use your TSE Lever Action Rifle or your Super Sledge? If you were going to fight any player that wasn't in point blank melee range would you use your TSE Lever Action Rifle or your Super Sledge?
---
&gt;  I do 100% agree the tse needed a nerd, no doubt about, I feel the nerf was a knee jerk reaction and done to hastily tho
---
No it was done to balance the game, make other weapons viable rather then being useless trash and to make PvP more viable so people aren't being instant killed by a gun you can use every time. It only seems like a knee jerk reaction because you are so use to the way things were. 
---
Oh cool thanks for the heads up!
---
Hopping in on this thread to let you know I've seen it. While I don't have a better response or answer to this right now I want you to know that you're being heard.
---
I disagree, they are angry about the following. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
You're actively deleting feedback threads on the Bethesda forums.
---
In what universe should we believe that you're taking any comments here seriously either?
---
I've tested everything I said.  Now please continue to discredit me.  
---
Again I ask what is the difference in what they are doing and what your doing?  You are throwing a fit because others are throwing a fit.   
---
The 4 year old euphemism is perfect in this instance. I’m not sure if this is intentionally ironic at this point, or if you are completely oblivious to the fact of what you yourself are doing. You have created a thread to bitch about people creating threads to bitch.
---
There is nothing noble or special About what you are doing. In fact you are actually on here complaining that other people are on Reddit complaining instead of using the official forums or the help page.  
---
Why are you entitled to voice your frustration and complaint, yet if others do its clogging the thread?
---
My quad was only doing 63 damage last night with 5 levels of Demolition Expert. I went to test it at West Tek and ended up having to run away at level 123........it was pathetic.
---
I think this is my cue to move on to a different game. I can't invest that much time into something only to have the goal posts moved. 
---
Best of luck to you in your future endeavors my Radium brother.
---
Dang so if I want to learn all mods for a weapon like lever action, handmade, radium rifle I would need to make 500 of that weapon, dam dupers have it easy.
---
I’ve never been so angry and disappointed as I am about Fallout 76. 
---
Indeed. I am really enjoying the nerf to the weapon power. I don't mind repairing the guns/armor frequently either, excluding my plasma and laser weapons, of course.
---
It just feels like I am being *punished* for using my gear, and that is even with the best perks.
---
I spent three hours last night hunting plastic. I ran out of shotgun shells so I hit Fort Defiance, Morgantown HS and a couple of other spots.  Made about 850 shells and leveled up in the process. 
---
Yesterday i did the AWOL Armametns twice.  Both times the 3* end enemy did not drop anything legendary. Really bummed me out.

That's more than I've gotten on my last (also my first) Queen kill.  Oddly it did show she had 15 lbs of nothing.
---
Heh, type mismatch.  I'm sure SPECIALs are integers.
---
&gt; due to the abundance of items you can easily find on the map you are never at any stage of the game struggle to find what you need so the entire survival aspect of the game becomes an inventory management mini game and a general chore. 
---
Todd Howard said that the game was "softcore survival". Sounds like it fits the bill.
---
Lol who needs stuff when you can just dupe everything 
---
&gt; I’ve been bundling everything to save space.
---
To repeat -- apart from Aluminium and Lead bundled mats take *exactly the same stash space as unbundled*.
---
It's simply a waste of time and plastic to bundle anything except Aluminium or Lead, unless you plan to sell it.
---
People are definitely leaving. All my friends quit today and it's because of bugs, not TSE. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
Not facts, your opinion. 
---
That would definitely be game changing! Trust me I’d love nothing more than to see the price of gaming go down, my argument was more from current day cost of operations for why games cost what they do! Here’s hoping efficiency can help cut time and costs for development in the future! Although at this point I can’t see the price going down now that we’re all used to that price structure. Share holders would just see that as “growth” lol
---
So significant I didn't even heard about it... Shame, after the patch Minigun is still... useless.
---
Melee builds a very easy to do and very damaging. I encountered a guy in the monster mash event who was able to one shot me with a Deathclaw hand when i was wearing full Ultracite power armor.
---
All you need is incisor, either the two hand or one hand dmg boost, and maybe the one that boosts strike speed. 
---
That I agree. But tbh I am just amazed their reasoning on the second part. 
---
I've been in denial for months.
---
/sigh 
---
Gods you really can't read the threads you link to it even the one I listed that was from Zenimax themselves.
---
and if you didn't have a workshop or teammates and didn't go wanted then you should of recorded it. Lots of people swear they didnt do anything even they just dont know how the game works. I'm level 206 and at level 100 i thought i knew everything about this game too. Boy was i wrong.
---
i still havent even SEEN one in my 450 hours of play, i just want to kill one for the atom challenge.... since i doubt it has any decent loot
---
I just noticed the same thing this morning as I was going through Big Bend Tunnel.  I couldn't sneak up on anything.
---
I worked in the gaming industry for 10 years, not as a dev though, but I got to see some insight I would not have known. Think of it all like a blanket, if you have 100 people making it, and 4 making changes, sometimes you pull on a thread and everything unravels. It's not black and white
---
Hmm...so you can’t say “devs are aware?” Not sure if I like the implication there. Can you let us know if their intended direction is indeed towards requiring players to gather/farm materials more?
---
The atom store is a different team than the team working on bug fixes and patches. I understand that it can be frustrating to see it updated when you're waiting for game play updates but it's separate from those working on the code. I know this answer isn't what you are looking for right now and I'm sorry for that but I wanted to at least say something on that.
---
1000 rad resistance is extremely much though. Plus the hazmat suit doesn't just protect against nuke zones because of the 1000 rad resistance. If the suit breaks and you lose the 1000 rad resistance, you're still protected from heavy radiation. Thus, the hazmat suits have some underlying coding that protects you from rad resistance beyond the 1000 it offers.
---
Cheaper? Really?
---
Games have been $50~ since at least 1990. That is $100 in today's money. 
---
They very literally have never gone up in price, and I think they are probably the only item in existence where this is the case.
---
Very interesting, and sorry its always been an issue for you. I dunno, stealth was wonky before with most mobs, but never like this, not for me. Also I share your dislike of mole rats and scorps aka the "you found me right away... again" mobs.
---
I've used grenades a lot. Like, going out of my way to make quantum nades and such. With the 100% buff, they'd do nearly 1k damage. A quantum made, albeit rare, probably shouldn't do as much damage as an orbital strike beacon. Fatman is still great, missile launcher needs a buff as a weapon itself, and so do the grenade launchers (their hitreg is something else lol). Hell, I run around with regular grenades and they still one shot lv60+ enemies if they're in the blast zone. I just don't see the issue and the complaints are unjustified.
---
My two primary weapons are basic models that I’ve upgraded myself.
---
Haven’t found a single legendary weapon so far that I’ve felt like using.
---
There appears to be a fair amount of lag on the hidden status bar when crouching.
---
For instance, last night I was sniping some super mutants and they began shooting back, but the indicator displayed [caution] rather than [danger] up until the melee mobs were very close.
---
Also, I've been hearing enemy alert sounds when the indicator remains on [hidden].
---
I have never once taken a workshop, I don't PVP unless I'm in a group (rarely) So again, unless they stacked a bunch of stuff I don't see how they can instantly kill you unprompted.
---
read the patch notes - it’s a feature!
---
Reading between the lines, they obviously took the laziest possible approach to “fixing” the mod scrapping issue by now only having loose material count towards crafting or repairing.  
---
Can’t believe it.
---
+1 for respec
---
Why cannot make exactly four kinds of servers?
---
||Normal|Survival|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|PVE|Weapons and armor breaks five times slower, no hunger, no thirst, bottomless «crafting bag» like in ESO, no PVP.|Current servers, but without the ability to shoot at players.|
---
|PVP|Weapons and armor breaks five times slower, no hunger, no thirst, bottomless «crafting bag» like in ESO, forced PVP.|Current servers, but without pacifist mode.|
---
And it might be that it is and they’re incentivizing being closer to the danger with an increased penetration perk. Just looks like to me that they are equalizing percentages across weapons and armor. If the latter is true it stands out on that principal 
---
Ah. Of course I am. You know all.

Fucking idiot.

---
Question: Why does one have to defend the company to enjoy the game? Seriously, why is this always a zero sum argument on here? Also, nobody cares.
---
And they have been for multiple times saying even here on reddit that this is open for changes.
---
how do they do that? specifically.
---
They altered the Two Shot Explosive Legendary weapon's damage so you could no longer stack the right buffs and literally 1 hit KO a level 50 Mirelurk Queen. As with every game that has ever existed when the game developer fixes an unbalanced weapon the people who use it complain. Game balanced be damned they want their OP broken weapon that turns end game mobs into shooting gallery ducks and unbalances PvP to all hell. Which they also ironically complain about how bad the PvP is in the game. 
---
They also complain that the fusion core spawn rates have been reduced from 10 to 8 an hour. Which offers no proof other then word of mouth.  And that previously fixed dupping glitches have been reintroduced. Again word of mouth without proof.
---
Given how many people seriously thought that FO76 was going f2p because a single youtube video talked about a single store in Australia was removing copies of the game form the shelf to be replaced with more popular games. So much so that Bethesda had to make an official announcement the game wasn't going f2p. And even then people were making excuses as to why that could be a lie and it really is going f2p.  I demand proof of any claims like core spawn rate and dup methods back.
---
Because they have been complaining about bobby pin but a simple test shows the UI is just  showing the wrong value. 
---
Well actually it's 2 for 2, though I asked the other guy to kill me. Even told him to keep the junk as payment and he refused.
---
if you paid for a certain number of months after the switch happened, then you got it down to 10$
---
I’d ask you for any screenshot or info on that post, but I’m guessing if it’s /v/ it’s long gone now right?
---
Yeah, def not worth it. Last time I got a 1* assassin’s machette from the SBQ. Got a 1* berserkers pitchfork the time before. 
---
Just got off sorry
---
It was never fixed lol
---
Sweet, me too. Add me if you want. GT is Belyal 
---
Weights you say? 
---
I disagree. The TSE *needed* to be nerfed. As someone who has gone through nuke zones only to watch enemies melt before I was able to land I hit them, I sure appreciate it.
---
I did a SBQ this morning and under a dozen of us defeated the event in under 10 minutes. I see no problem there.
---
Mine is fine.

Yea, you should try it with Strange in Numbers...I've had over 50 strength and Agility. Running across the sky. It's actually kinda annoying if u jump and forget that it takes 10 seconds to land...
---
I think this is a really good idea, Bethesda. While your patches do bring good things, they have a habit of rolling back old issues and creating new ones. By having a PTS, it'd held you avoid such things.
---
Every time I play, I take at least 2 workshops. Taking the workshops and defending give me enough xp to level up. Usually there's a nuke zone so I go there and have the Glow Sight perk that gives extra damage to glowing enemies. I farm all the ionized meat which most people do not loot. I have Hard Bargain 3. I sell all the meat and everything that I've bulked from the workshops. I always use Vault 76 for the free travel and my friends' camps are strategically spread out so I don't have to pay much to fast travel. I hit all the vendors. 
---
Cool story
---
Yeah got that one at lvl 40 unfortunately. I’m trying to get all the weapon plans anyway, this is the only one that eludes me.
---
Like i said. You just don't realize how the game works. Next time this "happens" please record it and post it. Sadly, like every other post about this, there is no evidence. 
---
I would like to see some more official statements rather than “we’ll pass this along to the dev team.”
---
It would be nice to have the reassurance of Bethesda taking ownership for the drawbacks and realizes the community of their game is taking a hit and they’re doing what they can to make it playable ASAP.
---
It’s been pretty quiet from their side.
---
You’re trying to equate that they made the game unplayable with a *minor* inventory “issue” if you even want to call it that. Yeah, hyperbole.
---
If you were to set it up. I would sub!
---
Don't forsake your integrity for another's incompetence.
---
with the way server is run the option for different modes is not out of the question in the future.
---
Some people are passionate about a franchise they love. The Fallout franchise has already come back from the dead once. We just don't want it to die again.
---
For an online game like this, I think they're excellent. 
---
All depends on the platform you are playing on surely?
---
Actually I too unsubbed... and yet here we are. 
---
I initially left because people refused to see flaws. Moaning about the “hate train against them”
---
Difference between us is that I was trying to make a lighthearted remark. You’re just being a dick 😬
---
I had to use stealth boy x2 and 250+ bullets to kill lvl 50
---
Oh, people say "invites" all the time now...
---
&gt;Exp is incredibly slow to earn
---
Exp is extremely easy to earn.  I'm lvl 66 and last night I played for one hour and gained a level by just doing my usual fusion core route.  As someone who usually stays low level for a long time because I only play sporadically it's been super easy leveling up.
---
&gt; caps are incredibly slow to earn
---
1400/day isn't difficult.  Selling chems is easy caps.  Hunt for things like civil war suits or ranger uniforms.  People complain about the 25k caps cap all the damn time.
---
&gt; enemies take way too many bullets to kill (not to even mention walking into an area with enemies 20+ levels above you and realizing that your 400 .308 rounds aren't going to be enough to clear it out)
---
Yeah that happened in early levels to me so I gathered more ammo, managed my perks better, made sure I was upgrading my weapons, modding them to cause more damage... ya know playing the game.  
---
&gt; weapons and armour degrade so quickly and take so many resources to repair
---
Again, manage your perks, collect resources, breaking things down regularly and putting them in my stash often, hunting for workbenches, managing my gear to make sure I had capacity for back up gear... again playing the game.
---
&gt; legendary weapons and armour are so rare (useful ones even moreso)
---
What? There's areas on the map where there's always the chance for legendary drops.  Do you want the game to just hand them to you?  Go to Watoga after Scorched Earth event and you'll find legendaries sitting in the blue suitcase no caps required because people got more than they can sell and carry. 
---
&gt; useful perk cards require such high levels before they become available, plans and recipes are so expensive to buy, and even fast travel eats into your caps. 
---
Have you considered maybe this isn't the game for you?  You don't want to do what's necessary to level up, you don't want to collect things, you don't want to put any effort into finding legendaries, you don't want to earn in game currency to buy things.  
---
This why loot boxes are a thing.  Developers have realized that there's a market of people who don't actually want to play the game, they just want to immediately get things with zero effort beyond spending money so they can create a "very easy" environment in games that have no difficulty setting.
---
You're welcome! Thanks for playing.
---
Going through your comments you’re a Bethesda sympathiser. Accept the fact that your God Howard fucked up. Multiple times. 
---
I never said they made the game unplayable.
---
Unyielding, radicool, and carry low health/rads
---
The melee nerf is absolutely coming. Just give it time. As for the TSE nerf, I have a TSE Gauss and I'm ok with it. As soon as I starting using it the scorch beasts almost instantly went from terrifying to simply annoying. I used to just stand in place and within a few shots down them pretty easily. I'm glad they're back to being threatening in my game...I just wish they'd drop better loot.
---
That is so unbelievably stupid. Thank you very much for informing me tho!
---
&gt;My personal fix for all of this was pressing the Uninstall button.
---
Another one would be melee. You don't need repairs, you don't need ammo, you're sitting at 100/300 carrying capacity.
---
Downside is you really notice the lack of content quickly unless you want to grind for a full set of Heavy Robot armor (for example).
---
Bethesda should hire Redditors for FO76 😂
---
The problem is at the leadership level.  Coders are given specs to meet, and they do that.  If the leadership did not spec that the dev room should be removed then it won't be.  If they did but had no process to verify it was removed then again it is a failure of leadership.  You can allow them to learn from their mistakes and move forward or you can replace them and risk the replacements repeating the mistakes.  Upper management needs to make some decisions and get the project on track and keep it there.
---
Enjoy not playing starfield and ES6 because you're a stubborn, dramatic jackass. 
---
I am building a pvp character and the day before the patch I got fireproof to level 3. Fuck me
---
Yup. Thats the solution.  
---
Cause I’m sure players want the 1* wooden armor or mr gutsy buzz blade i get so frequent.   
---
Oh and trading with players is soooooo EZ do as well...  i just have to take SS, post on a forum, play the waiting, bantering game then maybe get a sale.  
---
Minimal storage space to hold on to items also helps out tremendously...   /s if it wasnt obvious.  =)
---
As wonderful as these words are, I have to say that they mean nothing.
---
Bethesda's very reasonable goal is not to make anyone happy; it is to make money.
---
You vote with your wallet. Every dollar spent on a Bethesda product is a vote of confidence in the status quo.
---
Stop buying Bethesda games. Not because you are mad at Bethesda or want to hurt the artists employed there, but because you have no confidence that their products will be of a quality that will satisfy you.
---
I realize this is easy to say and hard to do. The popular impulse is to buy games based on their perceived potential and marketing hype, and it is an impulse painstakingly cultivated and reinforced by expensive media blitzes. It is no accident that you likely buy games based on how excited the preview media make you, and not based on how disappointed the previous games by that publisher made you. But when you buy games this way, when you vote with your wallet this way, you encourage games to merely have great potential, not necessarily great execution. You encourage companies to spend their own resources on creating hype, not substance. You reward them, in cash, for doing the very things you complain about.
---
Drastic change in the world of video game development does not require a heartfelt and very well-written plea to a publisher. It requires dollars to remain firmly in wallets, as votes of no confidence.
---
You know who looks smart in all this? The people who didn't buy FO76.
---
In a game where deaths don't matter at all, you can't talk about risks. In pve they have perks to reduce incoming damage and the slap mechanics make them advantaged (anyways it is always one-hit kill).
---
From the first day you could see how melee players could damage much faster the enemies, without requiring to look for bullets. And the problem of TSE was up only because of duping. In case there wasn't duping most of people would still ignore the fact that the combination of the two legendary effect was broken. 
---
All commando perks max and demo lvl5
---
&gt; This patch didn't make the game bad. 
---
Yes, it just showed how "serious" developers are about regression testing, quality control and how they listen to the community.
---
happens to me, and ive dropped 3\*s  and literally got nothing...must be a glitch.
---
I just bulk down to less than 200 stashed, then check my stash for anything over 200. That tells me what can be sold without bulking.
---
I'm pretty sure you're thinking of lead btw. Lead and Aluminum are the two that get lighter. 
---
The worry is if they are willing to gut a build that works that hard, anyone else with a half decent build is either not going to tell anyone about it or shit themselves wondering how long it'll take for that to be nerfed if it's popular.
---
Just what I want from an MMORPG is to be spending more time rebuilding my build rather than doing the end game content it's set up for /s
---
Or, I've got a crazy idea, why not actually just increase or better yet remove the stash limit. FOR FREE. What you said is not P2W, which are microtransactions intended to give players an advantage in game. That is an exploit, a glitch, and should not be counted as P2W. We should not have to *buy* something that should of been part of the game. Why would you even want to pay money though? I honestly do not understand why you're willing to pay $10 to be able to carry more, when it should be part of the game itself?!
---
You just needed to be using the magic rocket-powered sledgehammer. At least until that gets "balanced."
---
Great build out in the open but rolling solo inside of a building full of Super Mutants in close quarters and you are going to have a tough time.
---
Sniper builds are great if you play in teams or are just farming the Whitespring.
---
I am also searching.  If it could include un-perked prices for plans / recipes, that would be great!
---
Oh my body is ready.
---
The very first vote was up though, so that's all the validation I need.
---
Where do you find Queen Spongebob Scorchpants? Or is that only available in the Atom Shop?? 
---
Try me again when they come out and you’ll get the same answer. 
---
CTD (Crash to Desktop) = PC.
---
I could see that, I'm just trying to suggest ways to make weapons more balanced, I don't want the developers to take away the melee stat buff just add damage to all weapons scaling with your stats.
---
less than a minute since post, not enough time to have even read half the post and it was already downvoted
---
Didn't someone data mine the game and find some references to P2W exp boosting items and things like that? Could be another game, not sure. 
---
The mods are still available for a fraction of that cost using the same server hopping method as before, and they drop pretty frequently... I managed to acquire a few in a couple of hours of server hopping Watoga. Or, you can buy an install from someone who has the mod. 
---
Bethesda is trying to set up a situation where there's still a need for player vendors, which they hope to implement. If all end game recipes are available for dirt cheap, there's no motivation to have that available as a vendor. 
---
Well at least in one patch notes they said it was fixed and I haven’t had problem since until now. But I guess this patch brought back a lot of problems there was before. 
---
Totally not Fallout-related, but I feel your pain: you need two forms of government or state issued ID to get a new military CAC ID, and you can't use your old military CAC ID as one of the required two forms of ID, even though they have a record of issuing it to you, it has a microchip and barcode their computers can read, and they actually take the old ID,  insert it into their CAC Reader, and deactivate it. 
---
Lol at anyone trying to compare this to actual mmo. 
---
When you scrap bulked mats they break into the base material. So a bulked wood would scrap into 30 wood. You just lose the plastic. There's a perception that bulking reduces weight but for the most part that's just the plastic that was used up to bulk. For me it's a preference, that and I have 50 bulked aluminum, steel, and lead. 
---
For those that are reporting that their bulk won't scrap. I had no issue with this at a tinker's workbench. I don't know if that will make a difference.
---
\*takes seat in the circle\* My name is John, I have a problem, I've been in denial for months
---
There definitely some design issues. I agree with you. I think the big issue is how Beth sold this game. They advertised it and priced it as a stand alone completed game with improved functionality (multiplayer).
---
If they had sold it as “we are going to the same engine as Fallout 4 and try to make it multiplayer” I think the fans would have received it better. They also should have priced it to reflect that.
---
This game is engineered around manipulating and storing massive amounts if items (junk). That causes the issues with player storage. 
---
It is a bit convoluted. I think they should have reduced junk and used weapons and armor as the primary scrapping mechanism for materials. Weapons can be equipped, sold or junked. They are important items in the games. Thousands of coffee mugs that have to loaded and can be interacted with are not. 
---
Well at least they “balanced” the game so NPCs can better detect me when I’m invisible. Seems realistic 💀
---
The problem with this is that if you leave and turn the inside switch off, the keypad outside won't work, and if you leave it on, the keypad has a switch that anyone can literally just walk up to and flip to just open the door - it completely bypasses the keypad. 
---
I meant his desperate attempt to bring positivity to this chat board.
---
Ouch. Sorry, buddy. We can only hope Bethesda either rolls back the nerf a bit (unlikely) or eventually just nerfs everything (likely)
---
It happens man, everyone has to learn sometime.
---
It was Archeage for me.
---
That was an almost 200 dollar lesson.
---
I play across Xbox and PC. PC on ultra. 
---
Thanks for replying. Trying to keep it positive while giving feedback on the unintended consequences of the damage reduction

True, changes are a part of how online games work, especially in early stages. But the changes are meant to make the game more enjoyable, fix things and generally aim at making players happy. It's not the case with majority of the changes they implemented recently.
---
Ah yes. Give up on Bethesda and run into the embracing arms of EA and Gearbox. Two companies with an impeccable reputation of pure honesty and great standing with customers.
---
Nope i use borderless window. Will try fullscreen.
---
Also my problem isnt FPS, but stutters. FPS is okay
---
Don't kid yourself.
---
There is a a massive level of difficulty jump between making textures, writing a script or tweaking a swf to writing render, lighting and networking code.
---
As for balance now that TSE has been nerfed we need melee to be nerfed as well because it is unbalanced.
---
No, but it’s what you insinuated when you brought up regression defects and freaking litigation.  
---
Again, “most amateur AAA studio” is hyperbole. There are still people playing every elder scrolls title and fallout title that they are responsible for, that speaks volumes.
---
76 made me appreciate 4 100% more.
---
It’s not Bethesda’s fault you spammed whatever button to put the ingredients into the hopper, and now you’re going to just blatantly cheat because of your own incompetence? Smooth.
---
Unfortunately with pc it could be any number of things causing the crash. 
---
Vats is glitched not getting your critical meter filled per hit sometime. Also, 33 luck doesn’t get you back to back crit shots anymore
---
I had more fun last night helping lower level players that I had playing the game. :) Although some guy asked me if I could make him the Speed Serum. I'm like wtf! :)
---
strong yikes
---
How dare they not call of the lives of the developers and their families for this slight!  Hara-kiri is the only thing that will make it right!!!
---
Slightly embarrassed that I felt that clarification was necessary. 
---
Me too. Honestly.
---
But if we count everything together since launch, it is hard to stay positive. 
---
I mean Bethesda shows effort to make things playable and enjoyable. But it isn't enough if we consider the fact that Bethesda is no indie garage company. 
---
Should a company that makes a huge operational blunder be let off the hook just because some customers don't like to keep seeing criticism?
---
Fallout 76 needs more mirrored servers across the world. Bethdesa please invest more into network infrastructure, build a proper network stack and implement load balancing features. How are the protocols for when a player is joining a server? I found in the past that I had to server hop a few times in order to find a lag free server. Please help improve the user experience. The lag on the servers yesterday was horrendous. Corpse Item loots taking as long as a few minutes, rubberbanding for my teammates and I. 
---
This so much.  
---
Last night I dropped 50 of each Stimpacks, Radaway, Rad-X, and the same number of the dilutes into the cash register of WhiteSprings...
---
Not to mention I haven't sold any legendary armor/weapons in weeks, the weight/caps ratio is so horrible that anything that isn't going to get used gets paper bagged at the first train station I come across.  
---
I only bother collecting and selling chems to vendors, and I still have massive excess. 
---
No problem!
---
Just stop playing
---
I don't think I do. I think you're replying to the wrong person. Neither of your replies are relates to what I've been saying.
---
Lol for real
---
I saw a 4 man group yesterday on the PS4.  Level 230, 47, 29, and someone in the 60s I think.  They killed 4x Scorch Beast Queens in the course of just 45 minutes or so.  And the Queen would die about 4 minutes after the nuke landed.
---
There must be some sweet spot of players vs SBQ buffing.  Too many and the difficulty ramps up too quickly and makes under performing players a very difficult issue. 
---
&gt; Nobody deserves a complimentary respec as they didn't change your perks to something different they just reduced the values of those cards. It's not as if they changed Demolition Expert to "Now Increases the Caps Earned When Selling Explosives." Everyone is making it out to seem that it's basically like that when it realistically is not. Bethesda owes you nothing, if you want to respec, respec like everyone else has to it's really not that hard. 
---
You had me up until here.
---
It's customary for online games to compensate for nerfs, cause had this change existing from the beginning, it may have swayed people's decisions to other perk choices and builds.
---
As to HOW you compensate for the nerfs, that's when it gets tricky.
---
Demolitions expert cannot justify taking up 5 points in my loadout. They should have made it a three point card. 
---
And my missile launchers are still shit! How am I supposed to run with 7 missile launchers if they didn't do anything before and do even less now. Let me blow up a scorchbeast without using 100 freaking missiles 
---
I agree. I have voiced my opinion but would never go as far as to call for dismissal of staff.
---
 I too would like a clear direction, for patches not to roll back previous bugs and for builds not to end up devastatingly UP.
---
I chose to step away from my rifle build, currently playing Skate 3 to relax and think of where I wanna go with the game.
---
 Do I grind on my high level to change build or start again or do I take what I got from the game and move on?
---
 Either way, no one deserves to be called out to be fired from their jobs.
---
 Fine post wanderer! Take my up vote. 
---
Lol. It’s like saying “COD should just *add* a single player campaign to gain the single player community’s support.” It just doesn’t happen like that they should’ve used a new IP or a lesser known one to test, gather information and learn rather than releasing this joke.
---
No more TSE one shot kills eh?
---
This is so true. My end game has now become about searching certain areas for certain things, like a routine. When I first started this game, I played it like a normal fallout. Exploring everywhere, wondering what might possibly be in the next spot I check, hoping I find something epic tucked away, maybe surrounded by a neat little story told by the setting. That just doesn't happen in 76. You go to a certain spot for a certain thing, and simply hope it spawns/hasn't already spawned for someone else to take. Not to mention, I like to think that an epic area would give you epic loot, scaled on how hard it is to "beat" the area. See that robco factory? You'd think it'd be full of cool robot weapons and armour, and maybe something legendary since it's full of badass murderbots, huh? Nah, it's got mutants that drop wooden armour and fucken pipe weps lol. 
---
They are at least even trying to hire people for probably every single position at Austin right now

15 strength + 2x calibrated shocks on Excavator PA should get you close. Any additional strength gets you further
---
Lol, good luck to them!  Annoying the shit out me will surely get me to buy a fucking princess bed.
---
Why you just don't sell them? You really need only 20-30 bobby pins, because they collecting faster than consuming
---
Don't expect Bethesda to X9 reply to this post though.
---
Try using concentrated fire, critical damage boosts and crit modifier. You will be doing good like damage.
---
Thanks. Pre-patch I had 50 bulk lead, steel, and aluminum. I broke down everything else last night and broke down 5 bulk of the lead steel and aluminum.
---
Was pretty painful to have to pull out fusion cores to lug around to accommodate the extra weight it took up. 
---
I completely disagree.   This last update was a huge step backwards.   The turd is stinky and attracting flies.
---
I was never in denial, I was just suffering the server hopping and crashes and disconnects etc. while muttering to myself, while saying but I'm still enjoying the game, when I can actually play it and when I'm not trying to get some rare vendor plan or PA or whatever. But then I became one with the server hopping. It because a part of the gameplay. The loading screen was like my DoT on the Vendor boss and I just kept spamming it until I got my loot.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals a million times better. 
---
You didn’t read my whole comment. I can accurately state that, otherwise you would have realized that you’re telling me to do what I’ve already done.
---
If the devs knew what they were doing then energy weapons would have had a buff right now.  Instead they decide to nerf white knight for no logical reason.
---
There have been countless threads asking for better durability, before the nerfs.  They are not listening.  Passed to the team is just a report submitted via email or other communications.  Without proper project management this game is destined to fail.
---
One can say it already has.  3 months in and 5 patches, games worse now than it ever was.
---
Even No Man’s Sky started getting better right from the get go.
---
But now Meds weigh is reduced a lot
---
I'm trying to modify a Handmade, but it's not letting me use my bulked materials to do so. I have 1 excess adhesive and 4 bulk adhesive, and the game is completely ignoring my bulked adhesive. I transfer it to my person and back and forth and nothing. Wtf?
---
People didn't leave because of the TSE nerf, they left because of the following. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
 I completely agree with you. I have had a blast with the game. 
---
Just consider yourself lucky your build isn't a low str build, those guys got screwed over hard by this patch, the amount of points they need to respec is ridiculous.
---
Pretty bad when Bethesda makes EA look like CDPR
---
Complaining about the complaining ... irony meter is back to full.
---
I've tried making a restaurant in game, but with so little content to work with and with the difficulty of finding the materials now with the big hit to ranged weapons and explosives it's just not viable anymore. Unless some additional content gets added OUTSIDE THE ATOM SHOP I may just put down my controller for awhile as my cousin and brother both have and they were the only reason that I even bothered to play. May come back when the Dev team fixes the game to something more palatable and my fam decides to join me again in Appalachia. 
---
Right..... everyone is pissed off about all of the Nerfs, glitches, and added carry weight.
---
But Ned Flanders just realized how great the game is.
---
Worth noting that when using a Gatling plasma, it breaks in about 2.5 to 3 cores. I had one break from 100% in ONE core once. Anything that reloads twice and breaks is broken to a level of asinine that I'm not sure the English language has the proper words to describe it.
---
In all sincerity I would love to know how you got a Gauss Rifle with that kind of damage. I have one with the one star legendary effect for the 10% mutation perk and I just looked in my inventory at it, after repairing it to the full 200%, it is 154 base. With the 3 rifleman perks to boost it 30%, it's at 200 damage on the inventory window. 
---
Just wanna throw my two cents in to say that I've had zero issues with this recent patch. 
---
Things play smooth as butter, even with the perk changes. But I also never relied on stupidly overpowered TSE weapons so idk.
---
I don't mind at all about having the perks be "less efficient" because I don't care about efficiency. I care about fun. Oh no, now I have to use x2 of each mat to repair my gear instead of x1 with a maxed out White Knight card. What a tragedy. Also I run an automatic weapons build and I've yet to have a problem with my weapons breaking. Yeah they get low, but I'm almost always near a bench and I can just drop a C.A.M.P. whenever I'm too far (almost as though that was the intended purpose of C.A.M.P.s) 
---
This just feels unnecessarily salty, but, again, it's just my opinion.
---
They can keep that shit for free at that price.
---
Would you rather this place was a circlejerk echo chamber?
---
Take it as a lesson to avoid hype and pre orders. 
---
I'd be happy if I could figure out which armor set I'm pulling out of my stash. For a while I thought the last one put in would be the last on the container list but the proved to be wrong after a couple lucky guesses.
---
Tbh I don’t think they should let u drop quest item in the first place 
---
I'm pretty sure most of what's been released in the shop so far had already been finished before release and placed on a release schedule. Most of these designs takes several months.
---
I am not a melee person myself, however I can assure you melee builds can do thousands of damage with the right perks and mutations. If you look up some guides on youtube you should be able to find a good build that does it. 
---
The one my friend used is here:
---
https://youtu.be/Z3HbnMJJv0E
---
I'm level 34 and killed a level 50 Scorchbeast last night with a Hunting Rifle and an unmodified Combat Shotgun.
---
Git Gud.
---
So I can state that your assumption is invalid based on these 3 runs.
---
Run 1 silo was done by our highest level member who was 261.
---
Run 2 was done by myself which was alpha and I'm 154.
---
Run 3 was also done by me.
---
Of our team members its usually three people that run due to our experience and speed.
---
None of us cheat by using PA glitch through the wall. I've gotten 14 min runs just sprinting pass everything. 
---
From my understanding that queen difficulty scales off of number of players and average level. I really wish Bethesda Devs would explain why Queen difficulty changes to so often. 
---
I'm on Xbox, and mine broke for the first time ever last night, as I run level 2 gunsmith &amp; level 3 Lucky break, I typically repair my TSE Handmade (Primary weapon) to 200% 1-2 times a week (40 hrs of game play), but in it's currently nerfed condition it broke and could not be equipped in less than an hour last night, (starting at around 180%), then after 15 minutes of light use, I noticed my Furious Exp SG, is also about to break, (at 30%, down from 200%).
---
Most of the Handmade use came from a 20 minute long SB battle where I remained Hidden or in Caution the entire time (Getting full Sneak Damage), which took 2-3 minutes Pre-Patch, so the Idea of going into a Queen battle is completely off the table at this point, unless I'm going to hide in the Barn with the low level leeches.
---
Sure, pick the one nerf that made sense and was needed and ignore all the other crap.
---
I see why people are calling this pay to win, what if they release new atom shop items that grants a buff each week. So if the community doesnt stop that, this will be the route Bethesda might be going so if you want an edge over everyone else please buy the latest atom shop item. 
---
The salt is real. 
---
They really need to fix that. If they’re gonna demand we spend more time farming then at least make sure the loot system actually friggin works!
---
I’m glad I sold my copy back to GameStop. Lost approximately $45, but that game would get so frustrating it would literally ruin my attitude for the rest of my night. Get rid of it and see if your mental health improves. Mine did. 
---
Being in a team also f***s up stealth mechanism if your team mate is not hiding.
---
I was rewarded for doing the Order of Mysteries quest and reading everything, and was INFINITELY rewarded for reading all of the Westek and then Huntersville content. Such good stories.
---
A few, yes.  Better to hit the Charleston Fire Department and the fitness room at the Flatwoods motel, though.
---
&gt;I KNOW what passive mode does  
---
But do you? You can't even call it the right name: pacifist mode, which has a different meaning than "passive" mode.  
---
&gt;Pretty sure passive mode shouldn't allow that  
---
Ok, so you *don't* know what it does. Got it.  
---
I used Luck of the Draw for quite a while, but I found that even with 10+ luck and a maxed out card it only kicked in maybe once or twice in probably 500 rounds or more. I started using Bloody mess in its place.
---
Perks. It's all about the perks. I'll share them with you when I'm out of class. 
---
Spammed? I hit the button and my armor took the spot of a canister. It is bethesdas fault that it showed up to put in the hopper to begin with. I have a clip of it happening even. 
---
Get the luck of the draw perk. I rarely ever have to repair my weapons. I did an hour at nuke zone white springs last night and didn't have to repair anything. 
---
It could if they had enough damage that the 95% reduction was still 100% of your health. 
---
But there's no evidence that it's ever happened. No one has been able to record it in the wild or demonstrate reproducing it.
---
 It's most likely that people who think it happened have either tagged someone, got a bounty ( lock picking an airdrop is a common one) or captured a workshop and not paid attention after. 
---
I was recently accused of cheating after i melted a player with my TSE handmade, I run every damage boosting perk and had cranked Adrenaline up to the max prior to contesting his work shop. No amount of explaining would pacify the guy. I had a good giggle and a 100 cap profit.
---
I don't understand the logic behind your thoughts.
---
What do the majority shareholders care about other than profit, and if profit is tied to customer satisfaction why would they care about patches outside of making sure they make us happy? If the game devs were told what to do to make the game more enjoyable for maximum profit they wouldn't ever nerf anything in the name of balance would they? 
---
\&gt;The game runs smooth and pvp and pve is enjoyable now. 
---
Meanwhile, I can't fast travel or leave a building without getting disconnected, the game has been progressively getting worse for me on PS4.  
---
...so
---
No princess bed. But that race car bed is a different story!
---
The new patch and the bugs it brought back actually remind me of the time I first played when it was fully released. Honestly if these assholes with their duped gear can’t get over a rollback then I don’t think they should’ve bought the game at all. It seems they care only about actual gameplay rather than the world Bethesda oh-so carefully crafted and put us in.
---
My ultrawide support is broken again, it still let's me choose an ultrawide resolution, but all the UI elements are no longer on the right place. If I put my resolution back to a 16:9 everything lined up correctly. My 21:10 is just broken yet again, and no INI changes fix it like the previous times. I'm not done, just frustrated.
---
Are you sure you wouldn’t rather just make sarcastic internet comments? 
---
So you contribute to the bitching by bitching too?
---
Most people here either have no clue how a game dev (or any large company for that metter) works or they just choose not to since it's the cool thing to do.
---
How is this even a thing that you guys are aware of and are still working on? Like, just stop the spam attack garbage and up the value for landing frequency. Scorchbeasts chasing you around the map, spamming an attack that makes the screen wobble uncontrollably and never coming in range of being hit with your best weapon literally drain all the fun out of the game. Holy hell. 
---
For me, it’s an annoying attempt to inject “realism” into games that instead results in tedium, or an unrealistic hoarding of multiple weapons. It’s worth noting that F4’s survival mode didn’t feature weapon breaking, and yet succeeded in giving the player an increased “realistic” challenge. In F76, weapons and armor are far too fragile, and the methods of repair too taxing. And the message also conflicts with how the game is played. Combat is integral to this form of multiplayer, and enemies respawn. Yet when weapons and armor are that fragile, usually it’s a game’s way of saying “don’t just fight all the time.”
---
I think it’s multiplicative, not additive. So it would be 50% x 1.45 (stabilized) = 72.5% ignore armor. Which is still good but not 95%
---
Someone correct me if I’m wrong please 
---
yup. Done playing fair. Literally if the response they give is don't let the glitch happen, then the response I have for exploiting the game is the same.
---
It is most certainly not what I insinuated by regression and litigation.
---
Regression: Undoing the bobby pin fix.
---
Litigation: More serious issues than regressions. Including but not limited to data breach, gross malpractice and removal of service.
---
Right now Bethesda have a regression. The only thing that could be more serious is if player personal information was being leaked, the game was still being sold but actually unavailable, etc. The fact that it is 'just bobby pins' does not change any of this.
---
the only saving grace for Bethesda is that as a company that makes games they have a consumer base that is blissfully unaware, and willfully resistant to learning about, just how badly they have fucked up.
---
Actually yeah, its pretty similar lol.
---
Hey when can we expect the Roadmap? Your answers about any sort of new content is extremely vague, and if this last patch is any indication the bug fixes could take a long time. 
---
I dont give a shit, they make amazing games. No amount of your baby rage on reddit will change that. 
---
Did you willfully pay for the game? Did you play the game? You don't deserve a refund just because you have an attitude problem and the devs don't do exactly what you want. Don't be a baby, if the game is not fun for you, move on. There will always be things you pay for that disappoint you, you are not always entitled to have your money back because you're not happy (especially when it's due to your opinion).
---
The thing that sucks. Is if you are in the middle of the bush or in a building etc and something breaks. If you don't have a stash box you are sol
---
Nah, I'm all set. I've tried to give this game a fair shake and even defended it on another account numerous times.
---
You can quit, but don’t fucking dare tell us or Bethesda what to do.
---
It would appear so, I imagine there are multiple teams working on different things and for some reason this update had higher priority regardless of the regressions? 
---
Seems weird, they could have taken their time to merge the features properly to be compatible with the latest release version. It could be incompetence or a difficult decision (development is hard), I don't have enough information to judge them :) 
---
I just finished rdr2. I think I'm finally going to get into the Witcher 3 next.
---
Seriously?  How about addressing Bobbleheads stacking?  
---
You know what happened to the last company who had management failure.. They shut down. Just saying. RIP Telltale 
---
There are some really good mods on the nexus, that re-balanced fallout 4 and also removed bullet sponges, you should have a look at them Bethesda. :P
---
Does the smart fridge it come with a ghoul kid inside?
---
Bethesda makes EA look like a company that abuses its employees?
---
And every comment you make just continues to prove that a game company can run roughshod over basic business standards as long as there are a handful of useful idiots who still enjoy clicking the buttons that light up.
---
Whining to the Devs often becomes their real end game, like with Warframe. It's safe to ignore it.
---
Sweet. Go play something else that makes you happy and stop dragging down people on this sub who actually enjoy the game. Also can i have your stuff?
---
Need lead? Tin cans are the way to go. Find a place with a lot of those can chimes and disarm them for a bunch of lead. Most toys that aren't stuffed animals also contain lead.
---
Also keep in mind there are workshops and camp locations where you can put down lead extractors for lead ore. You need acid to smelt it, but Super Duper also procs when smelting giving you bonus lead.
---
Yeah but vats crits in melee aren't very effective. Pwr attack does more, and sneaking up to a enemy with melee is pretty difficult.
---
Just like you’re not entitled to make an insulting post because you disagree with the poster? And yet here you are saying someone has an attitude problem and calling them a Baby.
---
Not my fault that you can’t see that none of us got what we were told, and that it’s only getting worse as time goes on.   
---
And take note: even though the title said “should be allowed a refund” no where does it say that I felt entitled to one.
---
Buy Manta Man and RP as either shitty Aquaman or shitty Mermaid-Man
---
My husband and I did the exact same thing and preordered right from the beginning. We even bought a second xbox so we could enjoy the game together and be part of the beta. I have never been so disappointed in a game. I loved all of the other fallout games but this was a huge waste of time and money. 
---
Shit, better delete my comment! xD
---
Imagine thinking you matter enough to a stranger in the internet to tilt them or even be remembered after a comment. 
---
Thanks for the info. Got a source where i can read more? The patches seem to be creating as many issues as they fix...
---
Are you somehow under the impression that compulsive hoarders don't play video games or something?
---
&gt;Would you rather this place was a circlejerk echo chamber?
---
It already is.
---
What games have you been playing where this amount of incompetence/sluggishness is acceptable?
---
4 in 20 min. Reset my internet, hopefully it helps.
---
You can be a trader without the carry weight. 
---
But everything else in your post is 100% the way I feel too. Have a lvl 245 rifleman(9pts) and two handed melee (8pts) build. A few days ago I almost respeced the melee off my build. Thank god I didn’t do that because my all rise now does more damage than a TSE anti armor dragon. 
---
But repairing items is such a headache I just turned the game off until we hear something from them
---
Thanks for your response. I understand mistakes can happen, but these were not simple oversights. There's a difference between a surgeon botching a surgery because of an understandable mistake, and a surgeon leaving a sponge inside the patient. Like I mentioned in the post, these are the kinds of mistakes that simply should not make it out the gate of a studio like Bethesda if they actually cared, much less repeatedly happen. 
---
Did above, stepped back and dropped as many holo tapes as i could, logon to the terminal and it let me insert and download data.
---
...and the sticker is that i even reinstalled the whole darn game (47 + GB of it) post patch in the hope...
---
..thanks for sharing tho...i feel somehow more relieved that there is some kinda light at the end of the the tunnel ...
---
I was holding a gold metal for you. There.
---
Explosive fx lag the crappy engine so they're deterring people from using them
---
I am rifleman, yes. I was considering switching to commando, so maybe I'll go that route. Only 3 perk difference.
---
I don't use chameleon; I'll have to add that to the mix.
---
I’m genuinely surprised that with the patch rollback and the reintroduction of previous bugs and glitches, the Feed The People bug never crossed anyone’s minds...
---
Still it’s one of the reasons I don’t do it as much as before, and pay attention really carefully when I actually am doing it.
---
Maybe I wasn't clear, the Silo run doesn't have anything to do with what I was saying.  I'm talking about when the nuke lands (whoever did the launch doesn't matter).  If no one is there then the event doesn't trigger.  Once someone enters the area of the nuke zone and/or gets close to site prime that is when the event triggers and the SBQ comes out of the ground.  THAT person is the person I'm referring to as the level that matters.  In fact it might simply be the person closest to the site that the game picks as the event trigger person or something but hard to tell.  I have also seen level 2 people show up at fights where the trigger can fast travel down there when the nuke just clips site prime so no nuke zone to worry about.  In that example the level 2 person was running around with a syringer I believe.  
---
It uses creation engine. Has the fallout 4 assets, physics, and bugs and a bonus dev room.
---
Have my upvote LOL! 
---
20 bucks says you'll be back

I read that you had to hook a terminal to your keypad switch to make it work properly.
---
I too tried this when I first got my keypad switch and power door.  But I did not have a Terminal.  I just picked up a Terminal last night with the new Plan vendors.  I haven't spent enough time testing it out to see what I can do with it.

After about 5 hours of fighting issues after this patch, here's what I have experienced:
---
    A. Cannot press y to search cap stash about 80% of the time. I have level 3 of cap collector, and tried unequipping/equipping cap collector, but the issue persisted.
---
    F. Enemies still seem to randomly not spawn during Grafton protest march event. Event gets stuck on "locate the protest meeting spot". Enemies never spawn in, and I waste my time and caps. Sometimes, a few mutants spawn, but the event stays stuck on locate meeting spot and never progresses.
---
    G. Where is the stash increase you said was coming? Maybe, when you take everything fun away, you should add things we actually want.
---
    H. Where is the new content you promised? Survival mode is not new content. It's just not. You removed pvp slap.
---
    I. When will we get event timers on the map? Why is this not a thing yet? You nerf my ability to get caps, make plans more expensive, and still expect me to have enough to waste 20+ caps travelling to an event that's either bugged or ends when I get to it. I can't power up a nuclear power plant in 4:43.
---
I feel lied to. Fix the game, don't add new stuff when you have issues, don't patch an old version of the game, don't introduce more bugs, let us have fun. How are you guys commenting on here all the time, yet so out of touch with the player base? I bought this game because I love fallout and wanted to experience it with my friends, but all my friends have stopped playing. I love this game, but it is getting increasingly difficult to do so.
---
3 now. I quit. Game has become literally unplayable with plumber nerf.
---
This is why I wrote the post, a real post apocalyptic MMO done by a major developer was what we always dreamed of, I think that is why everyone is clutching onto this one so hard. 
---
ESO wasn’t made with the Creation Engine at all, this was the first time that Bethesda ever attempted to add online to its engines tools, so really they didn’t have anyone to call on. This maybe the reason why the Beta was used the way it was, because the really had no idea how their game would function online with real players, but still wanted to keep hype around it. Also why only pre order buyers could get into the BETA, because to Bethesda they already paid for it and didn’t think the backlash would be this bad.
---
Or cats, for that matter. Poor little guy is just trying to survive.
---
I had to change 0 cards, don't get any form of damage bug, haven't crashed, have killed two sbq and still 1 shot level 68 ghouls, I really don't have a problem this patch apart from dropping 100 Bobby pins on vendors 😂😁
---
Question: if stash limits are being constrained because of the number of items affecting server stability, why does the stash care about weight? Is a mininuke really 100x more difficult on server stability than steel scrap?
---
Suffice it to say, if it really is entity could that causes issues here, wouldn't it make more sense to make bulk items weigh significantly less than their corresponding scrap amount? If a player could free up a bunch of weight by transforming a large number of items to a smaller number of bulk items, wouldn't that be win win all around? I mean, you'd definitely see players go out of their way to bulk stuff if that cut the weight of their junk supplies in half.
---
The Atom Shop is what Bethesda truly cares about.
---
Had thousands of hours in skyrim and this worries me. I don't want to see TES go down hill. 
---
That's...pitiful. By the time I was lvl 40, I was able to kill lvl 50 scorchbeasts in just a minute or two with a non legendary Gauss rifle. No power armor, maybe using 5 stimpaks.
---
&gt; As soon as they announced FO76 I rushed over to the store to pre-order
---
There is your mistake. never pre-order
---
Have to agree. I've tried I mean really tried to like this game. Two builds different styles god knows how many hours of play. However I've found the relentless grind for mats and the lack of any real story have just left me bored. I know it's a sand box survival game. So it's probably these things aren't for me. It has dented my love for the franchise and I can't say I'm excited for any further installments. At least from Bethesda.
---
I use a non legendary lever action and have a 1* furious handmade.  I have yet to encounter a player I can't 1 shot kill with a VATS headshot critical and enemies die in under 3 shots.  
---
I am truly perplexed by the complaints on this sub.  I'm really tired of the entitled power gamers here.
---
Even if the condition rate is really bad, continuous fire is not a good idea at all. Luck of the draw procs each time you press the trigger, so if you hold it you effectively only have 1 chance to proc. 
---
However if you shoot in bursts you get a chance each time, which drastically the chance to repair itself. I know i doesn't fix the problem at all but it helps a bit.
---
A shutdown server is a stable server. 
---
Tyler county race track north west part of the map is pretty easy to take over and has aluminum,steel and junk you can farm there. Or you can go somewhere that has a lot of scorched and farm them and dismantle their weapons to get a ton of steel
---
Melee is OP now, which is fine... until that get's nerfed next. Wearing sentinel armor makes you invincible, until that gets nerfed. Why not just remove weapons and have us fight with words and emotes? but I'm sure that will get patched also when a new level 15 player complains.. Just nerf the game out of existence at this point. I've stuck with this game through all the hate it received, But you are taking away the point of playing after completing the story "if you can call it that" People spen 100's of hours obtaining weapons, armor, perks, ect.. only for you to squash em so new players can feel better. You do know the point of video games right? .... right? 
---
&gt;ep instinctively pressing the 'U' button at times of desperate need, always forgetting that we are currently living in a 
---
and yes, also changed keyboard a a matter
---
This is exactly why I quit. I'm going to play other stuff and keep tabs on 76s patch notes and hope they unfuck their game. I loved this game but now it's just too much.
---
Yeah the nerf is okay, I mean it sucks but it’s manageable. I’m still able to one shot all the ghouls at whitespring since I can stand right in their face now without worrying about killing myself. So in a way it’s easier. 
---
But with the nerfs should have come with adjustments to other things, I don’t get how they weren’t. 
---
Made me think of Deadpool. Break out the cream cheese spreader 🤣
---
Head over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals 
---
Everyone there is a million times more positive. 
---
Please don't make us wait for a full patch rotation to fix this.  This calls for a hotfix.
---
TSE needed a nerf.
---
Melee needs a nerf.
---
Pistols and rifles need a buff.
---
All three should be viable and balanced, one shotting shouldn;t happen at the same time.
---
Beyond that AI on enemies needs to be turned up a notch so they can be made less bullet spongey.
---
Nope, it was you. Started with your nonsense post replying to me. So poaaiblt you initally replie to the wrong person..
---
You're probably right. But it definitely makes the new patch all the more annoying though, with the changes to scrapping 
---
Vampires shishkibob with 40%faster swing makes me virtually unstoppable unless I'm being ganged up on by 10 lvl 50 gutzys and with the luck perk to weapon repair I almost never have to repair it but it makes SB a giant pain takes 5 minutes and 400 rounds of 556 to make it land before I can use it 
---
I hate dupers just as much as you. It destroyed the whole concept of a lore based game (along with PvP).
---
My point is that people like myself got their weapons legitimately......even worse is that I didn't even have a TSE. WhyTF would you or anyone else celebrate my mediocre explosive radium rifle being nerfed?
---
 If everyone does what you say, you will load into the game and find that your camp cannot be placed because the junk pile you built on is going to be take already.  Your solution doesn't scale and doesn't fix the root cause of the problem.  The problem is a game that is not anywhere near balanced when it comes to weapon and armor condition management.
---
Its 3rd person so that's cool
---
Its fixed
---
Monster Hunter MMO since day 1. I think you prefer the outrage it gives you a sense of purpose.
---
I'm onto elder scrolls online and hungrily eyeing resident evil 2 now. I think I'm gonna build my metal base tomorrow (only type I haven't built yet) then be done with 76 for a good, long while. 
---
Oooooohhhhh. Hyperbole, litigation and ad hominems? I hit the reddit trifecta. Glad I played today.
---
Dont do it. TS is trash. The recoil and accuracy penalty almost always negates the extra damage completely.
---
My stealth rifleman alt is still relatively low, uses PA for highbies and mobs.
---
And with all the constant game and dev changes going on, I’d like to keep PA &amp; FC fully charged.
---
Fwiw, I have mule PA for hauling gear and tank PA for work.
---
simple I use more then 1 gun - I carry 5x 90% weight reduction weapons - lever action rifle / pump shotgun / sledge / railway rifle / and 50 cal hunting rifle 
---
I then do a full repair on all these weapons to 200% and use the 50% reduction gunsmith perk and power patcher to reduce my power armor damage by 60% 
---
with what amounts to 4x durability on my guns I only use up small amounts of durability each day on each one 
---
also I use explosives on clusters of enemies which helps heavily with bullet sponges 
---
SO tldr I do use my guns I'm just better prepared - also my super sledge and hunting rifle don't use springs or screws meaning I don't need a lot of resupply on them and since they are very common ammo types I rarely even craft ammo - so maybe use your weapons better instead of more
---
Seriously. I completely forgot about the 200 limit earlier and bought stuff before selling.
---
So even the meagre percentage of caps they usually get grom my purchases didn’t go into their cap pool...
---
agreed! I see more and more angry and unhelpful comments here.
---
Its a downer when people are trying to enjoy a game, and come to this sub for insight/stories/info 
---
and end up with sarcastic/angry comments.
---
Post something positive here and you'll be in for a storm of haters...most likely this post as well.
---
Right back at ya!
---
Same, I had started picking up perks so I could spend time in a workshop and sell items and roleplay, but as I played more and more I realized that the game wasn't actually designed around that, and with the patches I simply can't even play the game correctly anymore.
---
I don't have a TSE weapon, my best weapons are a level 25 Ghoul Slayer/Power Attack Golf Club and and a level 50 instigating War Drum.  I supplemented the damage with grenades and demolition weapons but with the nerf to Demo Expert they are less worthwhile.  
---
I still suffer from Disconnects everytime I see a loading screen in game, seems that it WASN"T just players who were actively duping.  
---
I already started playing less, and moved over to playing DBD and going back to the SIMS 3.  
---
I've been up and down the tree a few times. The point is there's no point of going there after you've seen it one time. No tree specific enemies or events, nothing. 
---
That's cool. I killed a 3 star legendary in Fort Defiance, and got to watch it fall through the floor before I could loot it and vanish.
---
Had just enough time to glimpse a 2 star legendary chest.
---
Not to the extent it is now though, currently a level I had that was doing around 800 damage takes 2 shots to kill a level 15 ghoul at my camp
---
When did you submit the ticket? They can take up to 24 hours to reply, or depending on what ticket you submitted they may investigate it without replying.
---
I genuinely asked the same thing a month ago, my recollection was that “I was moaning” and just to stop playing. 
---
Was just looking for advice to maximise my fun. 
---
Strength should increase heavy and shotgun damage bcuz that's where the perks are
---
Until you get killed by invisible enemies that haven't loaded in yet attacking you. 
---
Yeah and when I noticed it happening, i tried to be careful but my stiff kept popping to the ingredient list and updating the order so when I was going to but for example the vegetable mix in, it updated the same second and I put piece of armor in there. Annoying. 
---
Oh, Hmmm never heard anyone speculate that. I'll give it go tonight and see what the verdict is.
---
I'm guessing its gonna be a nuisance to make sure random server peeps don't get selected as the median.
---
Gonna force our healer to camp nuke area I guess XD.
---
I think the only thing that will alleviate my worries is keeping in game buffs in game. And Atomic Shop purely cosmetic. I have 308 hours so far and I still have about 2k worth of claimable Atoms but it doesn't change what I'm actually talking about. Microtransaction buffs no matter how small they seem is not a good step. Atoms and challenges are designed specifically to funnel you into spending real money, even if it's a big funnel and you feel like you could circle it infinitely. Which I honestly have no problem with for cosmetic things. It's the fact that they are testing these small buffs with really nice costumes. Then they can turn around and say "You all wanted this, see? You bought this costume with a buff, you showed us you like Atom Shop buffs." It's a way to make you think you wanted this. 
---
Yeah but it’s still something new to see.
---
I'll give that a shot.
---
That’s a fair point that is applicable to most of the animals. The wolves, mutts, and hounds should instantly be aware of your whereabouts too. Can we please get a scentless mutation? Haha
---
I’m just glad that this freaking sub finally seems to have a more accurate sense of what this game really is, rather than sugar coating literally everything Bethesda fucked up on, and downvoting every comment that says anything remotely bad about the game. 
---
Unbelievable how many downvotes I was catching in here a few weeks ago for pointing out just 1/4 of these issues, (as if I was making them up and just trying to bash the game..) I wanted it to do good, but this game is a lost cause, seems to be getting worse rather than improving, and all of this makes me very concerned with what they’re going to do with the new Elder scrolls because I feel Bethesda has gone corporate and just care about profits at this point. They knew that this game wasn’t ready by any means, but they also knew people would buy it simply because it’s such a household name and has a tremendous fan base. 
---
ESO was pretty fun, really burnt out on the end game content though, very friendly community.
---
It'd be sarcastic if it wasn't true
---
Well I've got the full house on my bingo board with 'Dismissive Fanboys' so looks like everyone's a winner today.
---
It even affects [picklock](https://i.imgur.com/Chpemkc.jpg).
---
If you equip Picklock and Expert Picklock, your skill level is 3.
---
With all three perks equipped, your skill level will be 4.
---
I stopped playing Fallout and went to other games. I thought I could just wait it out, whats there for me to do that I havent done already, better yet what is worth doing that is rewarding? Honestly the most disappointing game I have ever played. I feel bad for watching the entire reveal stream, I feel bad for preordering the collectors edition. I was lied too, I was manipulated, I was a fan. 
---
Do you have any examples of "everyone complaining" about not being able to kill the SBQ?
---
So if I'm getting attacked I just die? Ok good plan
---
Why are you getting downvoted? It's not a glitch. You're not abusing the system.
---
It's funny that you could get that Fallout 4 or Skyrim feeling more out of their actual MMO, ESO, than with a Fallout with multiplayer.
---
Didn’t know this existed. Thank you kind sir. 
---
Just throwing this out there but maybe just stop playing?  Not being a dick at all but this is the realization I've come to in the past couple weeks and I actually thoroughly enjoyed the game up to this point.  We used to play a few hours on most nights since launch but lately, at level 60, neither of us even have the motivation to log in more than an hour or two a week.
---
I've done my time playing MMOs when I was younger where grinding for hours every night sucked, but in the end, had meaning because the grinding improved your chance for some damn near impossible fight with interesting mechanics and skill checks.  At this point, nothing in the game, not even the massive end-game queen fight is a challenge.  There's no motivation to grind because there is no content to grind for.
---
Last night we smacked the shit out of a level 68 scorchbeast in about 10 seconds flat with just handmade rifles and melee when it hit the ground.  What required hiding and power armor at level 30 along with a 20 minute fight is nothing more than trash in the wasteland now.  The complete lack of a level cap means it only gets worse as you progress and to this point, when nothing is a challenge, I can't even get myself to log in and finish the 5 questlines I haven't finished.
---
I logged in for the first time in a long time last night, MAYBE 10 minutes in, disconnected from server.  I will be probably trying again later in the year. 
---
You’re absolutely right, Bethesda Austin does not deserve all of the blame from this, they were just tasked with the hardest part of the whole project. They still had help in design from other studios, it seems the upper management might’ve been using it for R&amp;D for upcoming games using creation engine and online functionality, but still wanted a product to sell. That’s why there’s a lack of support in content and a focus on in-game stability, they’re working out the bugs in their engine, and not so much working on making the game any better. 
---
Well, [speak for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9m5uy/unpopular_opinion_dupers_saved_fallout_76/?st=jrjda6xz&amp;sh=908a11bf). I and others like me [commented on this issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/agzo5e/inside_the_vault_is_out/eeahvkx/?st=jrjdhy56&amp;sh=6cb265c3) well in advance of the patch. Many, many more voted through their actions by seeking out and using TSE weapons. You know - by playing the game in the fashion that gave them the highest entertainment value.
---
If you're wondering why you never saw comments in favour of TSE before, just sort this subreddit by "new" and you'll see that sanctimonious threads laughing at TSE users and blanket defending Bethesda outnumber the dissenting threads by a solid margin.
---
There's nothing sudden about this issue - this sub, and apparently Bethesda as well, deliberately make themselves deaf to dissenting opinions. 
---
You have to remember that in order for a significant number of people to find an issue with TSE legendaries, a significant number of people must also be using them.  When one camp gets their way the other is going to swarm online outlets to complain about the change ruining their preferred play style. I used to witness this with every balance patch regarding Air and Anti Air in every battlefield since at least 3.
---
Personally Exploisive and Two Shot where fine as is individually once item stacking got taken care of, the issue is that they where capable of being on the same weapon and they really should have been in the same legendary slot so it would be impossible to role both, but what’s done is done and the only way to really deal with it is to either need them so that when they are combined it isn’t overpowered or to change the spawn lists and wipe one or the other effect off every existing gun in the game. Not exactly ideal solutions either way. 
---
Then you have no idea what “pacifist” mode does.  But you say you do.  Yet you don’t.
---
Disappointment is right. I bought the game at launch and played almost every day for a month. By that point, I ran out of quests, had 3 suits of power armor, and a nice camp. I'm out of things to do, and it seems like any meaningful content is months away.
---
I'll check back on this game in a few months. Until then, it's not worth it.
---
now I imagine somebody face-planted onto the ground running around crazy like a plow....thank you for that mental imagery
---
I call bs, I kill bits in close amount of hits with a gatling gun, and it only deals a little over 100 damage. 
---
Infinite loading screens, players not wearing power armor stacking perk cards (bug) of the same cards but lower tiers (they unequipped but still effect ghost stats), can't move on load in when attempting to open pipboy, weapons not doing damage, loading in and losing your main equipped weapon into thin air, ammo disappearing on load in, rerolled version (not building on current patches for improvement) the list just goes on.
---
Slap damage is another thing that has come back in pvp. Be weary of groups of 2 or more pvpers, one has pacifist and will do full damage to you and the other will just run while you cant do any dmg to that player yet they are hostile. This just happened. Also, even when not claiming revenge, if you seek revenge once they will always be able to fast travel to you from that game session forward and kill you anywhere you go. 
---
Super fun. Guys. But no it's fine... it's fineeeeeee.
---
I have a terminal, I might try it. It seems really stupid to need to add another thing to make a thing that already has too much on it work. Just removed the GD switch - there's literally another door in the game that has just a keypad attached right to it. It makes no sense. OR - keep the one in the game and just add one without the GD switch so if people using the terminal method want to leave it, they can, and people who want a straightforward setup can make one moving forward. 
---
No it only charges to 5 unless you have a quad ammo legendary. 
---
Oh, yay, another Eye of Sulfuras.  Joy.
---
Put it on the pile next to my Bindings of the Windseeker, boys.
---
Wrrrrrooong. Tested this with a buddy for over two hours last night. My thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aldy0v/keypad_switch_and_garage_doors_please_bethesda/
---
We're not upset at the developers. We're upset at the higher ups who clearly place the atom store as a priority over the actual game.
---
how do you get to lvl 70 only to realize you don't like it? seems like a lot of time to put in to something you don't like. or did you just hope it would get better after each level...?
---
i know /sigh
---
There are aspects of this game that are terribly flawed.  But it has the best “world” for exploring of any.   It remains fun.  
---
The Atom Store is tied to micro transactions which is a revenue generator.  The team releasing items into the Atom Store is Bethesda the Publisher not Bethesda the Development Team.  The skins, emotes etc have were created by the Dev Team some time prior and are flagged by the Publishing Team as quick cash items to be released at regular intervals.  
---
any other apps running on your PC during play (maybe in the background--look at task manager)?
---
how much memory/CPU is consumed by the game?
---
Ok, so my current build. Cool. 
---
My apologies, ma’am. 
---
Dirty rotten cheaters got butt hurt when their duped weapons stopped being god tier is all.
---
I can one hit a glowing level 91 deathclaw with my super sledge , never used incisor before don't need it. 
---
 I absolutely hate when a game makes me feel like livestock in a slaughterhouse, I love diversity, I want the option to choose what weapon I use. Not meta driven garbage. When an update forces me to play one way, I quit. Last nite I had to put my guns away and grab a hammer , I logged out 5 minutes later. Guns all around need a buff before I will come back. 
---
I'm not a dog and do not appreciate being jerked around on a leash.
---
That's the last time they get money from us. Big mistake. 
---
I think the biggest issue is that bugs that were fixed in previous patches have returned. From what I've read, the plasma bug is back, as well as the high damage bug. 
---
I've seen some bugs in sneak as well.
---
Game balance is just that, balance. 
---
It takes time to properly tweak and adjust damage and perk statistics to make sure the right sort of level of fairness is attained, it might be too much, then too little.
---
Arguably some games that have been out for over a year still aren’t properly balanced, but this sub turned on a dime in the space of a day.
---
Passed on to the team and the team is aware.  Your comment means a lot to us and has been sent to team.  Here is an ending sentence trying to sympathize with you, when in reality I couldn't give a shit.
---
this will be the last game I ever get from Bethseda , I can't state enough how I keep hoping for the patch that fixes a lot of the issues people face and they just keep failing and failing at it.
---
The flooded trainyard? Yeah i heard about that spot! I keep checking there too. Thanks for the tip! :)
---
Ba dum tiss
---
With past patches you could maybe...sort of...make the argument that at least the game was moving in the right direction. If you want it to be 100% and it's getting there 3% at a time then it's fine. Just be patient and eventually it will get there.
---
Well this time it went -1%, and no amount of -1% changes will get you to 100%.
---
Guys it's time to abandon this shithole of a sub. The Filthy Casuals sub is alot better, and not filled with The best of GCJ 
---
Oh, apologies, you're right, as a paying customer, you should be able to complain.
---
Privileged?
---
You mean what games have we been playing that work as intended and gives patches / hot fixes that actually do what they say they do and don't revert back to old broken code?
---
Seriously since when did buying a game and expecting it to work become privileged?
---
I get that the wages would be better spent on a developer that knows what they are doing for fixes and content instead of someone else that will basically say the same thing as the current community managers but hell, privileged is a bit far, especially when people just expect the game to work.
---
I haven't launched fo76 in about 3 weeks. I really enjoyed it for a while, but its gotten to the point where its just frustrating to play, and no longer fun anymore. Cant stay connected to a server, server rollback to previous save state when I do get to reconnect, items not working, quests not completing, enemies just standing there letting me attack them, and many many others.  
---
I did my best to ignore most of them and tried and look past it. I assumed they would get resolved over time. But I've come to a breaking point and so have the rest of my friends where its just easier to play a different game. I really do hope they make a change, and maybe I'll be back in the future.  
---
The situation reminds me a lot of No Man's Sky. After 2 years I did come back and it was significantly improved in a lot of areas. Perhaps the same thing will occur here, but who knows. With The Outer Worlds coming out later this year, it's going to be difficult for fo76 to sway players back to their game even after significant improvements.  
---
thanks for hearing me out. 
---
And and and, the best bit, I haven't killed myself with my own weapons, patch is fucking great
---
When a legit build is making 2000+ damage I would consider that overpowered
---
might as well bail out to /r/fo76FilthyCasuals at this point. the salt build up in this sub is gonna reach /r/fallout levels soon enough...
---
I don't even have white knight for the same reason.
---
I check the vendor there :) thanks!
---
1. Ps4 2. HazelCircle 4 3. Cant add from phone
---
4. Was wondering around and came open a note saying something about a leather leg at vault-tec agricultural. A miscellaneous quest pops up. Went there and grabbed it but cant drop/break it down. Still labeled as a quest item. 
---
5. N/A didn't figure with a ticket.
---
Break down the bulk and have the materials on your character or all in you stash. Try that.
---
People have invested time and money into a product which is... not up to par. 
---
Not just that but for us who bought in day one - it’s shifty seeing the game fall in price so fast. 
---
Put it like this, is it any better when everyone is praising the game (on his sub) refusing to see any negatives? That’s where we were around lunch. 
---
These posts are no different than the countless “I’m having so much fun” or “to the people I met at whitesprings...” posts. 
---
Welcome to Reddit 
---
When will you be on?
---
I just hit 200 last night.  Still haven't explored quite a few places.
---
Yep noticed this as well
---
And what little kids running around to adopt like Skyrim? Oh my god. Theres Wedding bands and a whole bunch of players getting married allready. 
---
Melee nerf is incoming.  Be afraid.
---
Yes, Bethesda are aware. You have to manually scrap the bulk, then you'll get back the scrap. 
---
I think there are a few key things going on:
---
* The most recent patch was not tested properly, and in fact undid a number of things that had been changed in the previous patch.  This shows a continued lack of skill of the development team.
---
* The most recent patch has a number of nerfs that were not asked for by the community, yes we had an issue with TSE but things like Demolition Expert, White Knight, and Licensed Plumber were also nerfed for no particular reason. And while it's great we got the "Known" indicator on plans and that vendors now have a number of plans for sale, the price of those plans have skyrocketed - making the game more grindy than it really needed to be.
---
* Meanwhile there are still people waiting for new content, however they got there - either through rapid advancement with TSE weapons or simply by playing the game more than a few hours every day, they are at a point where they have nothing to do, and after this patch have grown bored.
---
* There is some concern that there is an event going on where if you are wearing an Unstoppables Outfit, you and your groupmates can get bonus health.  The majority of the outfits are in the atom shop only, giving a feeling of Pay to Win.  Something we were told we weren't going to get.
---
* There is still no in game support - if you lose an amazing item due to a glitch, you are SOL (Mama Dolce's for example) 
---
TL;DR:  Nearly 3 months in and Bethesda has been prioritizing stretching out the game by trying to slow the game down rather than adding content that is challenging (that could be a speedbump by itself), they are showing ineptitude with the patches, and seem to continue to prioritize making more money out of the Atom Shop than making an enjoyable gaming experience. 
---
I understand your grief but you are being a bit dramatic, a fully repaired gatling can do more than "one" run of West Tek... I run the exact same weapon build and it does not break that fast. I can probably do at least 2 or 3. Maybe you rolled a really shitty starting CND?  
---
That being said the gatling probably also has the slowest decay of any weapon, certainly of the heavys. Weapons damage far too quickly. A gatling plasma will break before you can finish anything. It might be tied with the flamer for shittiest weapon durability.
---
Yeah, was waffling between saying weightless junk and unlimited carrying capacity. Both are great.
---
This guy fuckin’ *gets it*
---
See my other comment in this chain. 
---
Also prices are going down because of competition. 30 years ago you had maybe 1% of the current total of developers. Indys have pushed the price down.
---
no, east when you are facing the south side of the station (facing Watoga High, not away from), there is a yellow or orange train car on the tracks just east of there that usually has an assaultron patrolling 
---
I farmed west tek a few times to refill if I am low on materials to craft the ammo.  The super mutants dropped tons of 5.56 for me. Although this was before the latest patch. Now it seems the enemies take too many shots from my other weapons to make this a viable solution. Now it seems I am just draining one ammo type to fill another. 
---
Same, came to this conclusion when I lost my Chameleon combat armor to a glitch. It was 2 stars and gave +1 INT too. When contacting Bethesda about it and providing video evidence, the response was short of "too bad so sad, don't let the glitch happen and you will be ok" 
---
If I do play this game again in the future it will be to exploit it and to show others how to exploit it.
---
But this is the opinion falling and falling...
---
Never taken a workshop?
---
Ok you have to be lying.
---
25 caps for a multitude of rewards worth more than 25 caps and CAMP plans and you literally just skip them while leveling past 100?
---
You are either bullshitting or just dumb.
---
Outrage over “nerfing” Demo Expert and White Knight is appropriate.  
---
How about you post a few examples of everyone complaining about that?
---
Well, yeah, but a release candidate shouldn't be a broken, buggy mess. Going gold straight from your RC is only acceptable if you don't have a ticket queue a mile long. 
---
Alright, I will link a Twitch account in a DM to you of a video of her TSE shotgun doing the EXACT same thing. 
---
Still want that refund.
---
# #quit76
---
I can probably dump about 2000 rounds of 5mm with a gatling before it needs to be repaired. I can test it later tonight if you're really curious.
---
This happened to me last night and I had to repair *everything*, but I don't ever remember seeing a message about a player attacking it. I also noticed that my camp was about to be hit by a nuke and I thought maybe that was the reason it was destroyed? I didn't really think that would happen, though. Does it? I wish I would have just tried the camp movement a few inches.
---
I have to disagree, I have more fun exploring Skyrim at this point. I've tried giving my everything to this game, I've backed it too all my RR2 friends and now my battle is finally ending and I might be restarting good old Oblivion at this fucking rate.
---
Jesus Christ this whole post is just you guys finding things that big corporate companies did and hate them for it. If you guys hate major developers so much why do you keep buying their shit?
---
Big companies want big money and they will do bad things to get it. Do people not realise this by now?
---
Witcher 3 is an awesome game.
---
We'll get four or five brand new accounts telling us how they just picked up the game and they don't understand all the hate. Someone will blame YouTube for everything because they're trying to get clicks, and they'll diminish any bugs they see as non issues. 
---
As someone else has said already, their reputation alone should be incentive enough.
---
That's not for you to decide 
---
Higher base damage for things like missile launchers, fatman, and grenade launchers would go a long way. Pretty much all the heavy guns need some love but the explosive launchers need at least 1.5x damage then what they have now.
---
Same for minigun or light machine gun. An attachment to add armor piercing would also be really beneficial as they devour ammo but have poor damage output. 
---
The thing about a heavy gun playstyle is it has TONS of drawbacks that would  balance out an across the board damage buff. It’s incredibly taxing on perks and special points just to make them usuable in anything more than a niche role.
---
* Demo expert 5 for the launchers is absolutely required. There’s 5 special points right there.
---
* Gunsmith 5 is also basically mandatory so they can last more than a few waves of enemies. Another 5 points.
---
* Bear arms 3 is a must if you want to main heavies and carry more then a couple at a time. Doesn’t help that you practically need multiple missile launchers or fat mans on you since they break so fast. There 3 more.
---
* Ordnance Express 3 is a must have if you want to use launchers or like chucking grenades. 
---
* Bandolier 2 is strongly recommended if you like using the harpoon gun, broadsider, or the heavy machine guns.
---
* Ammosmith 2 for crafting ammo. Which you will do A LOT
---
* Stabilized 3 goes a long way. I’d basically call it a required perk. 
---
That’s 23 perk cards and special points out of the gate before you even factor in heavy gunner damage perks, lock and load for reload speed, or anything else that might be beneficial. Personally I also use luck of the draw 3, grenadier 2, fire in the hole 1, and swap in weapon artisan anytime something breaks. That’s another 6 special points and 9 cards overall. It’s very taxing on a build. 
---
On top of all that, the cost for repairs and crafting ammo and grenades for these things is huge, making it a constant battle to farm enough  springs, screws, lead, etc. I could live with this fact as-is if the damage truly lived up to its potential. Especially for the Fat Man or Missile Launcher. 
---
Yes please. This can be a huge problem especially when you're using the Gun Fu perk!
---
All reddit is is downvotes. It's just fucktards being fucktards just for the sake of it. I don't care. 
---
I honestly think they just dont care about 76 and are focusing on the next skyrim instead so they can mess that up as well.
---
"Hey, you check Reddit for any new posts for us to ignore?"
---
"uh yeaaaaah. About that..."
---
Forever!
---
/r/oddlysatisfying
---
It’s because they wanted to sell fall out theme MTX
---
Before EA decided to cash in on loot boxes, horde the Star Wars license, cancel games in mid development, absorbing small studios just to shut them down and also keeping the KOTOR franchise in limbo they also made a name for themselves by attempting to extort money from players willing to buy used EA titles by making them purchase overpriced keys in order to unlock features already available if new. I wonder if these topics are still discussed in this r/gamingcirclejerk sub
---
Yeah thanks, ain't giving views lol. 
---
The damage values of weapons are the same as Fallout 4, except for the few weapons that are new to 76. These same problems of certain weapons being a better choice over other weapons have carried over from 4. These weapons were not balanced for multiplayer from the start.
---
In the case of grenade launchers and missile launchers their damage values have significantly been decreased with the recent Demolitions Expert perk and the fact that they've not balanced damage from a multiplayer perspective but from a singleplayer perspective from the start.
---
Or it's your shitty computer.
---
You’re right, especially after the backlash the community gave when microtransactions were announced, and why there’s still additional micro transaction lunch boxes still in the code of the game, they thought this would be a cheap cash cow, but no one bought it or there microtransactions so I’m guessing they already moved on to Starfield and ES6 completely besides the Austin studio.
---
I took a long break after i got lv51 in a week
---
I thought you had some cool new term I was unaware of :D
---
If chains with pacifist on but doesn't do damage, I just get spammed with messages that I'm not damaging due to pacifist. Tesla chains 5 times so 2 or more players being targeted by the arcs is a big drop in damage.
---
The timeline confirms to me something I already suspected.
---
76 was supposed to be a co-op mode DLC for Fallout 4.
---
FO4 was released in 2015.  FO76 was started that same year.
---
It's too bad, this would have worked out much better as a small scale (like 5 people) co-op mode where after defeating the SBQ - the Scorched disappear from Appalachia.
---
Agreed, they don't care about reddit comments, they care about money. Time to stop playing the game. Also don't preorder any games as well
---
You have to manually scrap it now
---
Yeah what's up that? My bulk junk not counting anymore either
---
I went through my stash and de bulked everything today just to make my life easier 😐
---
I honestly can't believe that Bethesda is that dumb. They already have a revolt with the creation club. If they gate off support for mods behind atoms they will lose everyone who stuck around and have the worse pr storm they've ever had on their hands.
---
So excited for Borderlands 3. I cannot wait to jump back into that world.
---
you can see for yourself if your so interested
---
Not everyone has been playing that long.  My 176 hours so far have all been in January.
---
I think it’s a strain on the server. It’s not calculating just your interactions, but the other dozens of folks playing. 
---
What about new content? We havent seen any of that either and yet every few days theres a brand new item, animations, assets made for the game instead of actual goddamn content. Im sure those teams overlap at least a bit.
---
Quit it with the apologies. 
---
Stopped pre ordering games long ago, its not like you can't grab them on launch day and get the exact same fluff. Pre orders were originally so that you could secure stock. now they just seem a way for companies to grab cash and sell different versions of the game.
---
I picked this up for my console at £30 half price 3 weeks after launch, and to be honest still feel that was too much. PSN don't allow Early Access game on the store so companies get around it by saying they will support the game and patch it etc...but what happens when that company is incapable of fixing the game, and who decides what is an acceptable time frame? 
---
Is once a week for empty vague posts called Into the vaults enough in its current state? 
---
Are patches like this last one every 3-4 weeks enough? Especially when it roll's back to previous versions of the game negating the last round off patches / fixes etc?
---
How is it ok to sell a product and still have it broken and buggy almost 4 months after launch and offer no feed back or information to customers?
---
I noticed more pvp pre patch on ps4
---
Not to mention big releases of other RPG/looter/shooters in the very near future. 
---
Putting out a patch that makes the community this angry, at this specific time, is a huge mistake that will likely reduce their player base to record lows.
---
Agreed. I’ve been high on anti armor since day 1, its a very good effect  
---
Max 5 demolition, max rifleman. A shotgun will do more specially in their face lol
---
None.
---
I played last night and didn't see a single wanted person in 3 hours.
---
The should have separated the two-shot and explosive mods to never appear on the same weapon. Demolition expert was never a problem.
---
just hopping in to let you know we aren't obviously being heard because changes are being done contrary to what the community has been asking. I'm not saying you have to adhere to demands but we tell you the game is a grindfest and you guys make it even more grindier. When are you going to fix range weapons and make them viable? right now my power armor + melee is still the best way to go. 20 bucks says you nerf melee now because I said that.
---
You can craft them already but they take a lot of flux and some other mats
---
Ive had the game maybe 3 weeks, and am plagued HEAVILY by infinite loading screen bugs. I had to restart the game about 8 times in 4 hours one day before this recent patch. Subsequent patches havnt really fixed it and its the only bug i have besides not game breaking ones. Im shocked no one else has it as some times its so bad i just cant play. 
---
Lol I have a 100  extra carry weight for a half hour for some reason when it goes away log out and back in and i have another 100 ..I'm able to carry 725 pounds ???
---
Abandon ship friends. Stop trying to bargain and move on.
---
No they aren’t.  And even then any 90% reduction that affected it would still leave me holding 1.8 as I have 180.  My own carry weight wasn’t affected at all.
---
what catlady house? how much plastic is there? i went to watoga school and got 155 plastic but i need MORE!
---
need it for making skeleton outfits to sell for my daily caps.
---
It's not a priority. Didn't you just read her fucking comment?
---
Scripting a video-game takes 20x more time than making a simple 3D model and texturing it on a modular store such as the Atom Shop. They can make dozens and dozens of new items for the Atom Shop while the development team can only fix 10-15 bugs during said period.
---
Patience. Game development is harder than you think.
---
You said this sub has “devolved into a mess of bitching and judgement”
---
You aren’t looking for discussion.  You are trolling.
---
That is like saying that because the car I drove four years ago has the same short block as the car I drive now its the same engine even though the car I have now has fuel injection, a turbocharger, and different cam timing and a more powerful alternator.  Yeah some components are the same but there are major differences so not the same. 
---
not on pc, didnt notice that many wanted players and i played a lot since patch.
---
Completely out of the scope of this post. 
---
I'm pretty sure its a display issue.
---
I was fast travelling fine with 195/190 last night
---
I like this idea, op and allways collaberate. But everyone hates this game and Bethesda will probably just make a bigger mess of it. Screw being positive, evryone just wants to kill eachother.
---
If this was just a new MMO with no franchise history it would be a ghost town and essentially dead. It is surviving ONLY because the fans love the Fallout world and have stuck by it.
---
Fallout 76 will become the Industry standard for how NOT to launch a multiplayer game. Previously held my No Mans Sky which i am told has become a great game as their dev them really did a great job fixing its many issues.
---
Do both. Give the problematic weapons a nerf to bring them down a peg, but dont just knock them off the ladder and make them useless. At the end of an RPG, you're *supposed* to be a powerhouse. Yeah you shouldn't be one shotting the final boss. That's just ridiculous.
---
But these amazing legendary weapons you fought hard to get, should be worth the effort you'd go to get them. Its clear that right now, 76's weapons aren't entirely balanced as it is. I think they *do* need to go back to the drawing board on many things.
---
Some guns are too heavy, some are too weak, some chew through ammo too fast, some break too easily.
---
My point is, things need fixing. Fixing everything by nerfing everything to the point of uselessness would be far less fun than buffing things to make more play styles viable.
---
My post was never about TSE. It was how i think they should approach balance. Make things more useful so you arent just stuck with two choices in the end game.
---
Me too. The game just continues to improve as far as I’m concerned.
---
Can do the same with my not automatic handmade but with rifle perks I only do this to save some ammo tho but in queen fight I go all out to the point where I do like 3-6 queens a day. It really doesn't get old its kinda fun to kill her;)
---
What about if I load all the way in and the game freezes? No amount of waiting seems to work and I am locked out of Charleston, it's train station, Riverside, the dry lake bed area, the capitol building and surrounding area. Works fine at the Giant Tea Pot and the trash site workshop. Works fine at the Widows peak location to the South. Works fine at the airport workshop to the North. Freezes in that zone. This was not an issue during BETA. I did all the Riverside quests without a single freeze. After the first official patch this freeze started happening. It's not my computer. It's something they broke in the first patch. 
---
I haven't tested and only have maybe 150 hours in-game but in other Fallout titles, radiation heals ghouls. so if you use a weapon with radiation damage it will be counter effective 
---
I'm pretty sure at this point they have zero testers and zero QA...
---
In other words: No, there was nothing there.
---
I doubt this. But I would be surprised if they support it for as long as they planned to originally.
---
Thank you so much for being open to feedback.
---
All of the energy weapons. It sounds like you are aware in general about the low damage and problem with their durability.
---
Are you also aware about the difference in how energy weapon damage is calculated? Please have a look here: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance
---
TL:DR - Energy weapons utilize their base unmodified damage when comparing to damage resistance, where all other weapons use their modified damage.
---
Additionally there is no durability perk for energy weapons.
---
As much as the fanboys may get angry at me I agree with everything the OP said. I stopped playing this game about 3 weeks after full release. I love the Fallout series but admittedly I am a gamer first and a fanboy second. I could honestly see the giant potential of F76 but it failed in so many regards for me. What we got felt like a F4 mod with a ton of bugs. I was hoping the patches and subsequent months would turn F76 into a solid multiplayer game that deserves to align with the standard you would expect from a AAA title but its seems things have only gotten worse. The fanboys may defend it (and trust me they do) but its getting harder and harder to call F76 even an average game in its current state.
---
I’m on ps4 
---
I agree, there is something broken.
---
I think I am understanding what Bethesda's trying to accomplish.  They are making a buncha high-maintenance game mechanics to make things feel more "survivaly".  I think the breakdown in this is there's so much glitch-survival work we have to do, that we're worn out on the "work" part of gaming
---
Get Lucky Break. Haven't repaired my armor in 4 weeks and across 30 SBQ fights.
---
Might come down to repairing each week now.
---
Can I ask why it was a bad thing that TSE weapons were so powerful? They're hard to find for one, for two you have/had to invest in certain perks while disregarding other perks that may be nice to have. I was never able to ko a SB in a few shots but now I need two to take down a lvl 10 super mutant. That's dumb. It's also rarely mentioned that they're not practical in close combat because you'll blow yourself up too. PvP isn't really practical either way, unless they get around to faction building.
---
There are loading issues that weren't present before yesterday. The bulk item thing while small is dumb.
---
As far as core spawns go, do people mean at generators or in the wild? I haven't been able to find a core at any of the places I usually check.
---
I like the game and enjoy it very much but especially yesterday, they're breaking things more than fixing.
---
I for one had no issues with what was patched yesterday. The things that were patches that affected me was more positive. I'm not level 800, I am still discovering the map and I can't solo a SB. I still have real challenges and I can't one shot NPC's. When the game was rebooting daily, I just log and come back to it another day because the $25 it cost me i've already got my money's worth!! I played one day of BETA and realized it wasn't worth the full price to go through the pain points yet. Bethesda owes me nothing since I already knew going into the game how it was based on reviews and the BETA experience i had.  
---
Was only on for 30 minutes last night. But in that 30 minutes managed to get in a sbq kill, ran to a couple of vendors and got a random Legendary drop by my camp. Is the dmg difference noticeable? Hell Yes! Is it the end of the world? NOPE! Only thing I really changed was my handmade TSE receiver. From Hardened (semi auto) to the powerful automatic receiver to aid in better dps due to fire rate.
---
Version control and git have made this a solved problem, fucking it up is just plain incompetence.
---
And don’t forget to check out the new additions to the ATOM store!
---
He's enjoying the game, and this sub has turned against Beth.  When the next patch fixes a bunch of things the mood will turn loving, again.  
---
Upvoted you both.
---
Loading screens yes, no floating enemies tho. I did get a level 12 ripper from a blast zone yesterday. So there’s that. 😑
---
Same thing happened to me, can confirm for xbox. Did a silo, picked up at least 3/4 and only one showed up in inventory. 
---
I'm melee on my main character but good try :)
---
Most of my guns weren't TSE, they were either TS or E. Both categories got screwed over majorly in this update.
---
I can only dump around 1000, before repair. Tested it last night.
---
Yes, it is ok...
---
https://youtu.be/yF4cvbAYjwI
---
alparecer can only have 1 officially, if you have an exedent when you disconnect and reconnect, the rest will appear on the floor without you being able to pick it up 
---
So now the big question is where do we find the Excavator plans.
---
I liked doing events and claiming workshops for plans.  It was an activity with a reward.  Even if I already had a plan, my friends and I would meetup occasionally and trade known plans.
---
I do however like the vendors being set lists.  Server hopping isn't fun, and that's what random vendor inventory encouraged. I am pretty sure the actual reason they did this was to stop server-hoppers, it's probably a significant drain on server resources. 
---
Instead, what should have been done is each vendor had a *small number* of set recipes, and everything else gets added to the loot tables of bosses and legendaries.
---
I have the same feeling walking past the toystore in whitespring and seeing the giddyup buttercup still there.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alcjfs/patch_issue_stealth_crouch_is_less_effective/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Honestly, the things that they are adding to the store are brilliant.
---
I just wish I could afford them.
---
Like this!
---
I'm a 94 and I use a lever action rifle I've killed well over 20 mirelurk queens (honestly only kill them in if they are in my way) but what I do is toss in nuka grenades to sweep away the small fry then depending on remaining hit points I charge with my sledge hammer if grounds even if ground isn't even I hammer it with my lever action rifle / shotgun / railway rifle / or 50 cal hunting rifle depending on distance and other factors 
---
also ultracite ammo is for scorched its designed to boost damage to scorched unless it was a scorch mirelurk queen you wasted ammo - also ultracite mods greatly reduce the durability of weapons also reducing its longevity - so while it helped with the SB it failed on the queen 
---
for SB I just dodge (what I can) their spam attacks then when they land I charge and smash them with my sledge as they have stupid amounts of bullet resistance but very little close combat resistance - since I'm a crafter / packmule I have +15 str making me very able to kill scorch beasts with a sledge 
---
that said the problem is you used 1 weapon where as I use several and thats how I repair every 4 days - I have a super sledge / hunting rifle / lever action rifle / shotgun / railway rifle each of which are 90% weight reduction weapons - I also don't sell grenades I normally can clear hordes without a single shot making my weapons easier to maintain 
---
So long story short its my play style that lets me do these things and planning not because I "don't fight anything hard" 
---
Except I literally said nothing about that, but okay.
---
Can't no one will join hunter and hunted and all the people on the survival server are running dupped OP items the used paypal cash to buy.
---
Yes, the Atom shop works flawlessly. Game studios love the micro transaction, especially when they screw the actual game up so much they had to reduce the game price just to sell it. Also the atom shop is need of a re-evaluation too, as everything in there is over-priced. And the don't make anything that works for the items I use but hey it is what it is.  I still a team of trained circus monkey could do a better job at updating the game and not breaking more than they fix. 
---
This is true ...sadly :(
---
Same here.  Completely uninstalled and reinstalled and have the same issue.
---
Ooh, tough guy. Take it down a notch, Chuck Norris.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=bulk&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=day
---
Maybe that's why you got flagged? I'm not even saying it's fair, or actually makes sense, but I guess maybe that activity could look more like it was done on purpose (I believe you that it wasn't) as opposed to scrapping it? Though I can say from experience that scrapping a accidentally/incidentally duped base has its "rewards", so if it is that they think certain types of use indicate guilt that is... Not fantastic.
---
It might be some other thing that flagged it, though if it's just that the camp got b accidentally duped that's fucked up.
---
I hope there is a lot more to the story than what I have seen, and admittedly I have not seen much so maybe its a lot deeper than I give it credit for, but it takes some good content to get my dollars more so than good mechanics and flashy bright colors.
---
A while back they reduced the number of cores in the world. It seems this last patch also put the fusion Core processors at the nuke plants back to 0.8 from 8 an hour. So it kinda sucks currently.
---
Why not complain? If something is not right, you complain about it. I have complaints, but I still appreciate their work. If nobody complained, wr would still have most of the issues from release build.
---
180 pins would weigh 18.  I transfer from me to stash, my carry weight doesn’t change, stash goes up 18.  I take the pins, stash goes back down 18, mine does not go up at all
---
Like Obsidian ? The last time they refuse to pay them a bonus, even if they had done the best Fallout 3D.
---
I have a charisma of 9 and I use to be able to share level three perk cards with my team. After the patch, I'm unable to share level 3 perk cards. I can only share up to level two now.
---
Same for my teammate. He use to be able to share his level one perk cards before the patch...but after no luck.
---
Not sure if I'm crazy but I'm pretty sure this is suppose to work as it did before.
---
I don’t know why I’m not having these problems. I guess it only affects some then?
---
I’m still one shotting level 62 ghouls at Whitespring with the TSE Lever Action. I was doing 934 damage, now I’m at 236. With all max rifle cards and only one point into Demo Expert. 
---
You can get right in their faces now and not have to worry about killing yourself. 
---
THIS. I FUCKING SAID THIS MONTHS AGO
---
Retconning happens all the time
---
(in a film, television series, or other fictional work) a piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events, typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or account for an inconsistency.
---
That's the definition of retconning 
---
Was looking good, until it became a Epic Games exclusive, and no one wants that. 
---
Shit, I haven't done the Pen, yet.  Found it, but haven't gone in.  Also haven't gone back to a fe places I wasn't tough enough to handle first time.   
---
Thanks for the remind!!
---
Oh, and I also haven't taken over each workshop, DAMN so much on the list!
---
FYI tagging redditors in a post doesn’t notify them. You gotta do it in a comment.
---
As for your idea, it sounds like the EVE Online council. Might work for MMO games but I dunno about 76. Tbh they just need to be willing to devote the proper time and resources to managing the game. If they are already doing that then somebody is screwing them up, maybe in leadership there. If THAT is ok, then I dunno what to tell them.
---
Well best place for assultron hunting is just west of watoga station. Also KH3 is a better game lol.n
---
Dude, my settlers are all in Sanctuary.  Red Rocket Inn is for Dogmeat and I.
---
Why can't it be neither? Why does it always have to be one extreme or the other? 
---
Also, get used to disappointment. Life is full of them and most don't come with a guarantee. If you felt your one-time purchase entitled you to dictate how the game is developed or how the company is run, that's on you. I have been gaming for a long, long time and I have wasted countless dollars on things that disappointed me. I never once thought I deserved a refund or an explanation. 
---
... I play on a PS4...
---
Don't even bother running the queen right now, the damage bug is back in full force. Half of you probably weren't even doing damage to her, so obviously you're not going to kill her
---
They nerfed the spawn rates January 10th. It was in the patch notes.
---
I only use batteries included and have over 50 cores.
---
Fusion cores needed, and I would argue still need, a nerf.
---
There is no reason for me to even pick up any points in power user.
---
I cannot speak for everyone but personally I have zero interest on a Beth.net gated private server.
---
Shit my The Dragon breaks after about 20 shots every time, fighting difficult mobs or not. And that's not even mentioning weapons like the gatling gun which I immediately dropped the first time I tried one after it broke 30 seconds later.
---
I literally have a sign on my wall in my camp saying that if you’re under lvl 15, feel free to find me on the map and hit me up for supplies 😂
---
Sometimes false rumors get started on the sub, take everything with a grain of salt after a patch
---
I might have to try it if I decide to reinstall the game. I steered away from Lucky Break because it looked similar to Luck of the Draw which never seems to proc for me. 
---
Small purifier is great if you don’t have a camp water source. 
---
I may reload Fo4 and recreate my current 76 character using mods.
---
More or less just a SUPER improved version of 76 without CAMP griefers.
---
Oh whoops. I dunno why I thought you were using a shotgun. My bad!
---
No it doesn't.
---
It translates to ppl are being hysterical over small temporary buffs.
---
No one has even tested 4 garbs of mysteries in a party.
---
Hope it helped
---
They keep nerfing XP, it wouldn't shock me if they keep nerfing loot too. 
---
How does it even come close to 30 levels lmaoo
---
The fact that they removed stats from Atom shop items does show they are staying away from pay-to-win.
---
But I can only just state the facts:
---
1 - you can pay for it
---
2 - It gives you a statistical advantage (even if a minor one).
---
In my opinion, I just worry that this is another can of worms, another dumpster fire that people will use to bash the game even further.
---
All this bad press has a bad effect on the game, and contributes to shrinking its player base. I want the game to do well, so I can play it for a long time :)
---
Like /r/Fallout?
---
ok
---
Can’t tell if the drag of all the chores is intentionally there to slow down how quickly you get through the content or just bad game design :/
---
Probably both
---
Upvoting 👍
---
But Two Shot degraded accuracy, so there was a counterbalance.   They should have left it alone.   The also should have left Demo Expert and White Knight unchanged.   
---
All they needed to do was “nerf” Explosive and eliminate bobblehead stacking.  
---
Go to west tek for steel, all super mutant guns etc will net you over 200 steel in under 10 min. As for lead, if you go to sugar grove, from the spawn point turn to your left and go to the rock formation, there are 4 lead deposits there, farm the robots inside for steel and lead, then go to all unowned workshops you have discovered that jave lead deposits and dont bother claiming or putting down collectore but rather just take whats in the deposit and server hop to rinse and repeat ☝
---
Even with that it really seems like they need better branch management.  If the March thing is that big, it should be in its own branch, and just have the patch branches merged in as needed.
---
I totally understand how it happened, and I'm not judging them too harshly for it, really just an observation. Branch off the commit from the previous patch, merge in the diffs from this patch, release, then merge into the March branch.
---
This is, of course, all assuming they're using a source control system and not just folders or something. 
---
561 damage was ridiculous.  You have some serious balls coming here and whining about that.
---
May have to switch to a Furious Explosive for your rifle
---
Greg in Grafton sells Excavator too.
---
While it is understood that these are separate teams, you guys need to start looking at it from our point of view. It's the same game, but the only thing getting new content is the in game store. What does that tell us as players? It tells us you just care about the money that we already spent to buy this game and support you guys and fallout. Start updating the game, and "suggest" to the team that's on the store to stop dishing out so many items, it will only further our displeasure.
---
The check in spot on top of snowshoe is called top of the world because it’s the highest point of the ski resort, the true highest spot in WV is spruce knob. 
---
Bravo.
---
What perk is grenadier in?
---
It would be cool to have it but at least be able to craft little repair kits or something that doesn’t require a workbench every few minutes. Guns are breaking too fast with zero way to repair them in the battlefield. 
---
I "literally" never used that word this entire post. And while I agree that a lot of things posted on this sub make no sense or are false, they should not ignore their community. I want this game to be just as great as everyone else, but if Bethesda could do it all by themselves this game would not have struggled at launch.
---
OK I get you are assigned tasks and management does nto want you to color outside the lines, but are you saying the QA department does not do regression testing?  That would inviting the mayhem guy from the tv commercials to come in and have his way with things.
---
BUT BUT BUT FREE DLC
---
.... where tho? not even a new event since launch. SAD!
---
The way Bethesda has them interact with you is a whole lot harder. You’re right though, the choices of their other games were all based on diverging paths, and it would’ve been impossible it seems with their current engine going online. The NPC’s and dialogue would’ve been a buggy mess, with a whole bunch of quests not working or NPC’s character movement completely bugging out. Most MMO’s have set pieces to tell the story, but 76 does not due to their limitations of their engine online. 
---
WAIT what!? You can launch the nukes more than once per week!?
---
Then you don't enjoy the genre of life sims and such. 
---
I'd suggest using a gun that uses ammo that drops all the time.
---
Handmades are bullet hoses and farming ammo at level 24 is rough
---
I noticed that too.  And it wasn't in paper bag so I was confused for a moment.
---
...bro you honestly just blew my mind.
---
Perception.
---
No, your fine, in your statement. Sometimes it does suck but a forced walk feels like real walking. To me it's immersive. My main is set up as a sniper so my game play is slower than most. No fast travel does suck too. It just makes me play differently. My 2nd character I can move and fast travel. I can play different on that one. It's set up more for playing as intended. Also, I play with my wife a lot so depending on her patience, I walk slow she runs ahead and melees. We just take our time playing the game at our own pace. Playing everyday I'm at 85 and she is 50. We are not grinding hard or 100+/200+ but have fun.
---
What do you mean a furious
---
Plasma gats can't use more than 1 to 2 plasma cores bofore breaking. It's made the gun pretty useless.  it should last longer than a paper mache model in the rain
---
That's the main reason I stopped playing destiny 2. It reached a point where the game was more chore than fun. It also one of the reasons I'm considering quitting fo76. It has reached a point where it is getting to destiny 2 versions but isn't improving.
---
It's not just heavy weapons that need a buff or energy it's all weapons. A 50 cal rifle shouldn't be out classed by a 308 or a 5.56 ( depending on legendary) Bethesda knows nothing of balance hence why the TSE issue is so massive. Right now the only real viable builds are still TSE or melee. You want to save the game start with balance then move forward. At level 45 a weapon should be just as dangerous as its user. I have seen the damage output of a low level weapon rival its maxed out non legendary relative. No more nerfs until the weapons are balanced then see what needs what 
---
Ok you can say that but all I have to offer is video evidence and that’s it!
---
Have to agree. The preponderance of issues that haven't been fixed, have been introduced, or have been compounded by subsequent updates have kept both my wife and I - long time Bethesda fans - from playing the game at all. Feel like buying this game for us was a waste of $100+.
---
You have 
---
1: skilled your Karma very low
---
2: Intelligence as well
---
3: ignorance at max level
---
You are right to scrutinize the info you see online. Good job for that but you said it in your comment you could log in n see the issues yourself. You obviously haven’t done that or else you would have notice some of the previously patched issues are now back. Yes, there is a ton of “Fake News” in this sub n online in general but that’s just propaganda which isn’t new to mankind. Discerning between real n fake content requires you to do the investigating n come to the conclusion on your own. You want to take everything you read online with a grain of salt good on you, but when your comment is giving people the impression you are calling them all liars for experiencing an issue that was fixed n now re-emerged makes you seem like a troll. This is why everyone is downvoting you.
---
lol my team was bitching about how their TSEs dont do 1900 damage anymore for like an hour, meanwhile im enjoying the 5 new perk card slots i have after perm-removing demo expert :) 
---
From what I've heard, Anthem is just Destiny with a different skin.
---
No idea what version you're playing but ever since the latest patch it's feels more balanced and stable. Grenades seem to work fine from my experience.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-P2qL3qkzk
---
Ehhhhh no I never got/played Destiny so even if Anthem is similar to Destiny that doesnt matter to me and the 20$ skin thing yeah I dont like it either but I never do microtransactions. And anyways they said that the prices were not definite so we'll have to wait till it comes out to be sure. You could chill with the assumptions and judgement, because you're wrong anyways. We're all here to play video games.
---
Played for 5 minutes.  Enemies I killed floated.  Tree limbs were floating in the air not attached to trees.  Perma froze when I tried to drink a water to quench my thirst.  I'll come back after the next patch to see how it is.  😩
---
And Bethesda the people with the tools do the same thing when they patch causing more bugs and other glitches. So whats your point?
---
I said repair your ITEMS not repair your weapons in first sentence - items also includes armor - I assumed people would realize these were 2 separate sentences 
---
my weapons I repair are - super sledge (no screws no springs) hunting rifle (no screws no springs) railway rifle / lever action rifle / pump shotgun which are what uses the screws and springs to repair but I use my sledge and hunting rifle on small targets letting me repair my costly heavy weapons less 
---
No. 
---
Would all three rifleman help or no?
---
So according to you, unless you work in a company, you should'nt be able to criticize this company ?
---
"Working on their perks" as if it's a challenge or effort?  Come on.
---
Do you have the perk that lowers the weight of chems?  Mine are heavy when I put them in the stash but very low when I have them on me.
---
you are preaching to the quire brother.
---
if they do it for free im all for it.
---
but having unlimited space comes with a certain server cost. 
---
i bet they got the money but they may not wanna spend it
---
Like the Creation Club? lol.
---
This game is comically flawed. I kinda wish Bethesda would just shut down the servers, spend a year finishing the game like they should have to begin with, and then reboot.
---
Thanks! You're right, they do have a place called Top of the World. Though it doesn't look nearly as cool at the tower in FO76 :-P
---
Now
---
Because it’s not what people want to hear
---
This exactly is why I am putting the game down for a few months to see if anything changes 
---
How is it one of the strongest when my build is designed for that and I struggle to exceed 250 when a melee characters build pushes over 1k? 
---
Well let me ask you this, what do you want out of it?  Like what are your goals in the game?  Also, keep in mind, I am very biased towards WoW and will compare to it, as it is my ideal of what an MMO should be like.  That being said, Oblivion is my favorite game of all time, so I also love the Elder Scrolls Universe.  However, if you too are invested in the lore and universe, you may be disappointed, as this takes place before any of the memorable events or characters are introduced.  So most content is dungeons, Cyrodiil PvP, or running Anchors, questing are most of the content.  
---
If you just want to quest forever, like in a elder scrolls game, you can do that, the quests are pretty fun, but at times can be tedious (especially if you are a completionist and want to finish the zone).  A lot of quests are fetch or mob quests, but some are pretty engaging.  The main story is also very interesting.
---
PvP, I didn't get that far into it, I only went to Cyrodiil a couple of times, it was pretty confusing, and I got ganked.  The battlegrounds in that game also were not to my taste.
---
Anchors and Dungeons are a grind.  You queue up for dungeons or just join in at your local anchor.  These involve just killing mobs.
---
I have to say, the funnest part for me was the dungeons and quests.  I think the downfall for me was that I did not enjoy the PvP and didn't fully grasp the class mechanics.  This meant that once I reached max level and was onto the legacy levels (or whatever they are called) it just felt like an endless grind.  It just seemed a bit too easy for me as well.
---
My previous experience was with WoW Burning Crusade, which was out like 10 years ago, so it was a very different kind of game then it is now.  It was very tough to level up, the world was ruthless, and shite was too expensive.  I think this shaped me to expect games to be like this, because when you win in that kind of setting, its far more gratifying imo.  In addition to the stuff I pointed out about lore in the first paragraph, WoW had a way of making dungeons that just fit right into the lore, like imagine seeing a movie, then you get to play the movie scene, sick!  
---
ESO just never did that for me, even though I love the Elder Scrolls world, it feels very disconnected from main events, which makes me feel like I am in a different setting.  The dungeons felt very generic and mostly devoid of meaningful story.
---
I guess I will put it this way, it is very fun leveling in ESO and there are many cool features.  But it is not very gratifying to play and will start to feel like a grind after a bit.  It is sort of like a fusion between a typical elder scrolls game and an mmo that falls a bit flat.  I wonder if they did that to Fallout..... oh wait
---
In my experience game stability was markedly improved.   I did not observe more or better legendary drops.  
---
It's nerf or nothing 
---
Yoooooooo me too wtf. I remember 2010 like it was last year. Get me off this ride.
---
Darn. That's a long time to wait! I already feel like I've done most of the quests and I really haven't put that much time in the game.
---
That is with a perk that takes 5 points too. 
---
No it’s not lol been there quite a few times but it truly is a thing of beauty to look at over the edge in the summer 
---
I did have hopes that it was just a poorly planned launch and they'd get their shit together afterwards but it doesn't look too good. 
---
AFTER alot of grinding
---
honestly the only real perk of junk piles is the screws - every other good can be farmed but screws and they are the most grindy thing to me which is why I build on junk piles 
---
Are you trying to punish them? The only way you can punish a company is punitively through the civil
---
Court system or by not purchasing from them.
---
If you don’t like it stop playing
---
Do any of the devs or ANYONE at Bethesda actually monitor social media and take feedback here?
---
I see devs in several other gaming subs interacting with the community but Bethesda has been completely silent since the release.
---
If they don’t start showing the community that they still give a fuck about their games they’ll lose us. Because if they keep up with this trend of banning modders that try to make their game playable they’ll easily go under if they keep pulling this EA shit on us!
---
I would love to have a craft mod that alters the dress into a suit. I prefer to look stylish while running around and the dress just clashes with my top hat.
---
Never wanted to bother with them. Got my xp from the story and nuke zones. 
---
It's funny how my 154 dmg axe does more damage than a 224 dmg missile launcher. I refuse to carry missiles or the launcher cause it's worthless but it was worthless in FO4. And mini nukes should take out whatever is in the area that it lands but it doesn't and never did in FO4.
---
At least we're happy! 
---
It's another legendary effect that no one used because Two Shot was better in a vacuum. Damage is increased for every hit on the same enemy. Furious could still out-dps a two shot on something like the Queen but two shot is good all of the time.
---
I agree with you, especially about the bugs in game. Doesn’t have to be nice all the time, but just look at the post patch threads each time something drops. 
---
You mentioned bandwagoning - brother the negative bandwagon has been there since day one. People still show up on the sub, and gain far too much attention for calling a game trash, while simultaneously continuing to okay something that obviously gives them daily acid reflux. That’s a cognitive disconnect I can’t begin to understand. 
---
Pretty sure after today I’m a filthy casual and I’ll move along. 
---
Ok buddy. Keep taking the Med-X.
---
Man, the rapper Tom MacDonald says it best in one of his songs..
---
 "Everything is now digital, where I'm paying even more and getting even less"
---
I hear you, I had a tickle party with some super mutants using my explosive double barrel yesterday, full perks on shotgun and explosives. My radium rifle (which is not perked at all) did better damage considering the reload time on the double barrel.
---
fuck yeah, I called him out this morning-- realized by looking at the timeline he been gone for months. Probably for the best, I wouldnt want to show my fucking ugly mug to the community right now either. 
---
For me, the nerf was helpful not because I wanted to have one of the weapons, but because it was always annoying for me being around anyone using one that would just one shot explode everything, throwing bodies all over and not letting me get any hits. I wouldn't mind each of those perks existing as they did before, but they should be in the same legendary tier without the ability to stack them.
---
I believe it was “slightly” over powered.  
---
I think it needed a nerf, but I only believe it needed about a 25% nerf not a 75% nerf to both. 
---
TSE weapons were really the only ones that made it worthwhile using guns over melee.  Now melee will be way stronger than gun builds.  
---
I think a small nerf to TSE with a buff to the other gun effects is what should have happened. 
---
TSE was strong to be sure, but the other effects are also rather under powered.
---
I really don't think its an over reaction. It's pretty justified at this stage.
---
I believe survival mode in FO4 is not much different.
---
A friend of mine had an explosive two shot shotgun that could kill an entire mob of high level enemies in 2-3 shots, with Scorchbeasts taking only a few shots more, without being loaded up on shotgun damage perks. You cannot sit there and tell me that Bethesda intended for that to happen. Furthermore, I have a hunting rifle myself that isn't legendary to begin with that can take out the vast majority of enemies in 2 shots max on an incomplete stealth build. Your game is in no way ruined.
---
Ultimately, you need a little of both.  And when you think something needs to be nerfed, you have to consider it from the holistic perspective of "Why are players doing this in the first place?"  Don't look at it as "These players are doing it wrong."  They do it because of *your design*.
---
White Knight is a perfect example of this.  Bethesda "feared" that players would consider it a mandatory perk because it was simply too good, in their eyes.  Okay, but ask yourself, why would players consider it mandatory in the first place?  Because the repairs cost too much.  Because Ballistic Fiber is tedious to find.  Because you changed it so virtually everything requires it.  Because armor breaks too fast, especially if you deal with Scorchbeasts.  All of this boils down to a simple reason: *players would rather play the game than deal with even more inventory micromanagement.*
---
Hence, a solution that forces them to do that will be met with derision, especially if you give them nothing in return for this new inconvenience.  You could have, for example, gone back to the original Ballistic Fiber requirements.  Made one piece of junk yield an extra Ballistic Fiber.  Or, you know, change the decay rate and leave the ingredient benefits as they were.
---
this game has been out for 3 months and not even a new quest. just the same boring quests I have done multiple times. I'm throwing in the towel. 
---
Bye Felicia
---
regular SBs are going down a LOT easier for me after the patch. with a  mix of 2S dragon, exp. lever action, and handmade. Though my handmade seems sort of shitty and inaccurate now all of a sudden
---
honestly I don't think its so much the devs and designers I just think the PR department should probably be reshuffled since 90% of the issues with these things is PR
---
Nah it’s like when you take a really bad shit and you think it’s over but then more shit comes out and ur like wtf 
---
Amazing that even after all this talk about the obvious flaws of the game and its direction, there are still people getting triggered about someone being honest on here.
---
How rare is it to get a furious?
---
they did. everyone is raging against TSE, not realizing that the immense nerf makes single star TS or explosive useless trash. the TSE are barely better than regular weapons at this point.
---
i fully believe that TSE needed a nerf, but this wasn't the way to do it. nerfing Demolition only further crippled already shitty heavy explosive weapons. two shot wasn't even the issue. if it were to be nerfed, 50% would have been more than fine. it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing thing. everyone is either "KILL TSE AND MAKE THEM COMPLETELY USELESS" or "NO NERFS EVER!" there is a happy medium that actually promotes balance, and it isn't completely neutering anything that is viable. im sure a lot of tunes will change if they nerf melee, which is now the most OP build in the game.
---
Option 3: Point out to other people the myriad good reasons why they should also find a more competent studio to support.
---
Weapons last 300 years into the future and are used with little to no degradation.
---
25 years after the war weapons wear out in minutes. Seems legit.
---
No wonder the USA lost the war.
---
In all honesty weapons IRL can wear out and going cyclic hits them harder but really. Now I need to use my weapons to farm for bullets and to use them to farm for repair mats and to use them to farm for armour mats. 
---
THE GAME IS BROKEN BUT I CAN PAY MONEY TO BE GROGNAK. 
---
I feel the same, except I worry about my mutations and how they boost my melee weapons from 200's to the 600-700 dmg range while in combat.   Having too much fun.
---
I submitted a ticket a few weeks ago and never got a response.
---
FWIW, I've noticed before that if I hit the shoulder buttons fast, you can sometimes get to a portion of your menu screen before the server seems to update properly. So, you'll get things like a stimpack graphic showing up for a frag grenade, for example. It wouldn't surprise if this is a variation of that, and it is why you can't actually sell the ammo for caps. 
---
So you’d be ok with the sonic attack if it was more realistic and it was able to penetrate every structure?
---
I don't think so, no redeeming Bethesda? I think people forget these guys created the games we grew up on. Not every game is going to be a 10/10 smash hit. They are worthy of the criticism they are getting, but no redemption? Nah dude.
---
Check out the division also.  Had a gaming session last night with 0 crashes.  It was so refreshing.
---
He says in response to a perfectly civil logical op that does none of the things that you describe. I think you are projecting there a bit mate.
---
Bot
---
When I can run a private server, things might be different. Hopefully. Or play offline singleplayer. At least give me that Bethesda. Not once has forced multiplayer interaction worked. Except for Journey, imo. But this is not Journey level quality, is it?
---
Ok there have been 2 patches in January. January 10th and 29th. The January 10th patch changed Bobby pin weight, fusion core recharge, and duping with boards. I have tested duping with boards and it DORS NOT WORK. Fusion core recharge glitch DOES NOT WORK. Only Bobby pin weight had been re introduced. We are not two patches behind of else none of the things I mentioned would be possible. If we were TWO patches behind like you say we would be running the build from the December 11th build which included bulldozing.
---
I am on ps4 but I’ll add you if that’s cool I need people to play fallout with I’m usually playing by myself or unless you always have a full team that’s fine
---
Which is why they need to "concentrate" on fixing the worst bugs first.  This patch had 72 items that I couldn't have cared less about.  Which to me says they're rushing fixes for "everything" instead of focusing on the worst things first.
---
If they dial back and focus on the worst stuff, they'll have team members left over that can give us content too!
---
Mufucka I got power armor edition and stopped playing at the beginning of december. 
---
Fuck dis gam
---
They hyped it as if you had control over what debris were removed. Sadly not
---
I don't downvote opinions but wow you're basically saying every aspect of W3 is bad and I can't take that seriously. You have to be trolling.
---
The specifics being - anything that changes
---
Haha! I would LOVE to make a church and role-play that shit.  Wish Beth would make a mothman statue! @Ladydevann  @LoneVaultWanderer
---
My stuff will be in the bottom of the patspsco river. Check the sub Reddit there is OP armor for swimming under water out there.
---
If they are funded for development for a while, they can recover.  There is no monthly sub, so a player can pick it back up 6-12 months later if it's been greatly improved.
---
If this game is in fact a serious investment in new tech for Bethesda and they are committed, I think they can get there.  It's just pretty bumpy due to the circumstances, but at least they were up front about this being a new and experimental project.
---
I honestly was on board with them stumbling and figuring it out as they went, I understood how hard it was to make a multiplayer game if you've never done that before.
---
That said, the game has been out since October. They have been making slow but steady strides towards correcting the issues but yesterday's patch gutted my enthusiasm for this game. It was clear that once vacation was over the people in charge of this game's development had either changed or they simply stopped caring.
---
I'm on the edge of calling it quits, not because the nerf, but because of how it feels very much like the things they change have very little to do with how the game plays. 
---
If i learned 1 thing on reddit it's how much of an echo chamber your community is. Please, i beg of you Bethesda - FOCUS ON CONTENT AND IGNORE THEM!!! THEY REALLY DO NOT REPRESENT MOST PLAYERS!
---
They're trying to ruin the game by erasing all difficulty! Compiling this petty trash really shows how worthless listening to them is:
---
We should have a Fusion Core regenerator plan
---
Graham is proof that this game would benefit from more NPCs.
---
Idk if this has been said already, but is there a reason purified water isn't treated as boiled water?
---
Passive mode should make it to where other players can’t kill you, destroy your base, or interfere with your gameplay at all.
---
Legendary effects should be craftable
---
Can we get a roof piece to make bigger warehouses roofs more consistent?
---
[Console] - Can we get the ability to store more than 50 photos?
---
I’m quite tired of having to constantly have weight reduction perk cards taking up special points just to be able to manage my carry weight
---
A machinist shop capturable workshop where you can take steel and convert it into a choice of gears, springs, or screws would be cool.
---
Nothing but nerfs and more bugs in an update is never a good idea. There is nothing “good” for the player. Only doom and gloom.  Especially when they’re dragging their feet on new modes and content, the updates need to have SOMETHING positive considering how likely they are to break more stuff than they fix. 
---
That was the beta beta
---
I am starting to believe this myself. They could have literally released a new DLC for Fo4 and turned it into a true multiplayer game and had a better player response.
---
I will continue playing just cause of my love for the franchise...but i dont look forward to playing this game as much as I used to. 
---
ITS MA'AM *screamed in a very manish manner* 
---
The two are not even close to comparable. 
---
I finished all the quests by the end of December, discovered most of the map, built 3 sets of power armor, and built a nice camp. I'm basically done with the game until more content comes out, and it makes me sad. I want a reason to continue playing.
---
You should get more upvotes for this. 
---
HW guy here, running with minigun and 50 cal and agree completely. I can go hours with my 50 cal blowing through about 4-8k rounds and still have &gt;50% left starting with 200% and gunsmith 5. 
---
Someone is being overly dramatic. Calling shenanigans.
---
I too think that it must be a pretty toxic work environment for the devs...
---
Name checks out 
---
Yeah, nobody asked for 75% of the nerfs, yet they still nerfed it.
---
I don't play Monster Mash.  Don't need to because my guys are level 130 and 170.  But it sucks for you.  You didn't ask for that nerf, nobody asked for it.
---
Hi, can you come up with anything original?
---
I was wondering why my helmet has a atom shop icon...
---
Are people at Bethesda not playing this game themselves to form their own opinions on what is and isn't broken? How can a new patch break past things? How can a company go MONTHS without addressing issues people have been having since day one? One of the things that this last patch was supposed to fix regarding a 'rare' issue where players can't access their pip boys literally happened to me the FIRST TIME I LOGGED IN AFTER THE PATCH. I have it saved in my Xbox clip library. This is not a small company. This is not a small game. This is not the first game. This is not a new engine. This is not even that different from the last game in any appreciable ways AND YET MORE IS BROKEN THAN EVER. HOW. HOOOOOWWWWWwwWW? But sure - keep pumping out cosmetic crap. 
---
I played the game pretty much daily since the beta. I picked up Battlefield 5 on a deal in December, and honestly have no desire to go back to 76 unless some new content comes out. I didn't think the replay factor would be so low this early. What am I going to do in the game? I can get more XP and level up, but I'm already a 100. I've explored the whole map, I've done all the events, I've launched nukes and fought the queen. Last time I signed on, all I did was jump from trader to trader looking for mods and plans and farm aluminum, springs, and screws. The end game is just non existent.  
---
Yes, i hate it because of the inconsistency. If it could penetrate every wall and trees and shit great, then they need to fix how spammy it is. If they make it so it cannot penetrate anything but your soul, also great. Just please make it consistent. 
---
Nah just adapting to the game changes, I actually find it pretty fun not begin able to one shot everything and having PVP just a little more stable. 2 days ago I was pvp people with my 2shot explosive and assasin armor now I’m im pvp people with my power armor with my anti armor shotgun and my melee weapons and still winning little harder but still at it 
---
Probably but at least you could interact more than an emote. It would be easy to set up pvp, trades or make friends than it currently is.
---
So you are advocating to spend your time convincing others not to play a game. Silly and a waste of time
---
holy shit batman, you missed out on having it maxed before the nerf. my lvl 5 demo expert only adds like 30 damage not worth it anymore; lvl 1 adds like 6-7 lol.
---
the only issue I have is an issue that appeared after patch 4 where the Ghoulish perk doesn't regen health when irradiated anymore tbh
---
Have fun when nobody is online dropping nukes anymore.
---
Oh, thank heavens: exactly what I've been looking for. Thanks so much for pointing us to this.
---
I said this before, but what we have now is alpha. We don't need beta servers, because current live game is just the alpha. With luck, we'll be in beta in about a year, and then maybe another year or two and we'll be ready for release.
---
Its called paraphrasing and you do use quotes
---
Sad, but true. 
---
I have a anti armor combat rifle on pc
---
I have been playing rdr2 I'm on chapter 4 now hadn't had one glitch or bug or disconnect have not lost one gun or piece of clothing all the quests have been fun to play and they all rewarded me properly not one complaint so far the game can defend itself maybe one day they will make fallout great again but not today that's for sure
---
I don't envy your position, and I know that you're limited in what you're allowed to say, but we need actual answers :/
---
We hear that things are being passed along, and that's all well and good, but we need to know that the people that make decisions are actually listening. We need there to be some way that we can actually figure out if we're being listened to, because with some of these things happening, it really doesn't feel like we're being listened to
---
The front page is inundated with posts about people quitting the game, calling for a change of Bethesda leadership, or complaining about the recent nerfs. So GTFO with that bullshit. This sub correctly upvotes constructive criticism, and errs on the side of upvoting a lot of empty bitching as well. If you're getting downvoted in this sub, it's because you've earned it.
---
No, you're right - they data mined lunchboxes with the store tag that gave exp bonuses, positive mutations, and things like increased jump height
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/a5l9f7/lunchboxs_appearing_in_fallout_76_esm_files_no/
---
I can agree that it was OP in pvp but i dont pvp with them, i dont pvp at all
---
I only use TSE guns because i dont wanna spend 15 minutes waiting for scorchbeasts to land and slap them with all rise (or server hop) nor do i want to use up *expensive* ammo shooting a ghoul. tse made annoyances when exploring go away easily, now its as tedious as it was when i was level 3
---
I’m with ya. For all the criticism Fallout 4 got for its simplified mechanics, lackluster story, etc., I got plenty of enjoyment out of simply exploring the world, finding all the little points of interest, and piecing together the stories behind each of them. 
---
On my first character, I blew through the main quests and by the time I got to the final quest to launch a nuke, I was around level 55. Despite the multitude of disconnects, server crashes, quest bugs, and invisible/invincible enemies, I felt like there was a decent amount of content. 
---
Then, I slowly cleared out my first silo and launched a nuke... and the server crashed. 
---
When I logged back in, the quest was complete. There was nothing left to do after that. I felt robbed. I’ve yet to kill the Scorchbeast Queen to this day - every time I’ve been on a server where Fissure Site Prime had been nuked, the Queen was already dead, or a pair of level 300+ players (who were most certainly using a combination of bobblehead stacking, mutation stacking, and overpowered TSE weapons) would vaporize her before I could even fast travel to the nuke zone. 
---
Was this supposed to be endgame? Grind hundreds of levels until you’re lucky enough to get that magical TSE weapon so you can kill the Queen, which doesn’t even drop any worthwhile loot? At that point, I realized the build I was using wasn’t at all optimized for endgame content, everything was a bullet sponge, and I was running out of resources to be able to kill stuff and stay alive. 
---
SPECIAL reallocation wasn’t a thing at the time, so I decided to roll a new character with the intention of taking things a lot more slowly. Instead of sprinting from quest marker to quest marker, I made the point to stop at every POI I came across, explore them thoroughly, and build up a collection of crafting plans. My new character is level 41 and I’ve yet to step into the Mire (currently on the quest to go to the Free States Bunker). Basically, I’m playing it like I did Fallout 4: by simply exploring and not giving a crap about grinding levels, plowing through quests, and farming events. And it’s fun!
---
Bethesda created a beautiful game world for us with Fallout 76, and I’m more than satisfied with how much is in it for us to explore. But as a game, it’s completely hamstrung by broken game mechanics, unstable servers, and awful balance decisions. This is becoming more evident as I begin exploring parts of the Mire, where enemies like Gulpers are total bullet sponges. Why is a level 40 enemy taking a dozen or more shotgun shells to the face to kill when I have an appropriately-leveled and modded weapon and a bunch of perks to increase its damage? Why is it that I can just hop into a suit of Power Armor, equip a two-handed weapon with no perks, and kill it in a couple swipes? It’s not the way I want to play, but just as in my first playthrough, it seems like you’re almost forced to go the melee/Power Armor route to survive. I hardly ever used Power Armor in FO4, yet in FO76, unless you’re using some highly specialized loadout with the appropriate gear, you’re basically required to use it in any of the late-game areas. It’s just not fun. 
---
Anyways, this post got much longer than I intended. I guess my point is that FO76 as an exploration and survival game is great, and I’m still finding plenty of little secrets and points of interest, as well as tons of crafting plans as tidbits of lore I missed on my first playthrough, which I find enjoyable and rewarding as a solo player. For all the other aspects - combat, trading, enemy scaling, events, game economy, loot, PvP, etc. - it’s just not fun at all, and every patch that nerfs the few things that made those aspects fun or at least tolerable while not adding anything to address the lack of fun elsewhere is just frustrating. 😕
---
Here’s what people don’t understand and why people keep crying about melee nerfs. Those people are using specific weapon types combined with armor meds chems bobbleheads magainzes. Essentially buffs out the ass. That is what makes melee characters “op”. But people with TSE were killing everything in one hit without stacking or buffs or even the appropriate perk cards for their guns. So what will nerfing melee accomplish?  The guns were OP without any necessary character buffs, melee isn’t anywhere near op without buffs.
---
TL;DR - nerfing melee is pointless cause TSE was nerfed because it was inherently  broken and OP.
---
given the confusion the current devs apparently have they might misunderstand your "joke" and put it as an request into the next patch
---
"People requested for nerfed food so they can farm more"
---
Ok...just bye then
---
My favorite is that bethesda claims they can't do anything about anything. you lost stuff to our glitch? can't do anything. People are duping? can't do anything. People exploiting the game? can't do anything. 
---
What can they do? They make no effort to protect honest players, and make no effort to punish dishonest players. I read somewhere they were taking a stand against exploiters but have seen nothing come of it. oh well.
---
That's what you're saying.
---
I'm fine with the bugs 95% of the time.  I do get crashes, I do get server not responding, I do have problems.  But I can still enjoy playing with my friends.
---
It's hard to enjoy playing with your friends because they're all QUITTING the game due to lack of content.
---
Nope, even when using a heavily armored enemy, like the Queen, in the damage/damageresist equation, TS still slightly comes out on top. But that's fine, because that's cheaper TSEs for me!
---
They should fire their customers? 
---
Yo can. Just not easily. No more 1 shotting yosef 
---
Either way they go whether they create a beta server or keep releasing updates, adding a feedback menu in game to report bugs or make comments would be very beneficial for the players and the developers in order to improve the game. 
---
I do however get a "Stimpack has worn off" message in the top left corner now. That's new
---
I think both suck
---
If you say so but my point remains that the old dupe method is not back. The methods that were previously patched for and so we are most likely not running an old game build as people have been fond of saying. Especially coupled with the fact that fusion cores aren’t recharging and the workshops still generate them at a normal rate, all fixes that were introduced in the same patch.
---
Eh I'll take my chances, clearly im not a good judge of character so im bound to find more toxic games lolol. I do think anthem is going to do better than fallout but after this burn (and EAs fails) I will have a very close eye on it till it's releases. The demo this weekend is supposed to have a ton of improvements. 
---
if you find it disappointing but want more Michael J Fox watch The Frighteners.
---
This game is nothing without friends. Change my mind
---
For sure, I find myself aiming for the head again instead of just hosing down everything, I really feel for the people who lost out on stuff but everyone kinda knew these changes were coming out weeks ago. 
---
Sure what do you want
---
Observations can be conveyed as opinions (it seems to me like you're overreacting) or as facts (you are overreacting). Just because its an observation doesn't make you immume from being called out if said observation is conveyed as a fact but isn't.
---
Line in the Sand. There’s a scorchbeast flying around and scorched attacking but sure, let’s target the surface to air missile because I’m standing right next to it.
---
Honestly I invite people a lot to my team just so I can fast travel to where they are and then I usually leave the team. I thought this was a common thing but I could be wrong 
---
Mentions and patch notes are two completely different things. But before the last patch they made patch note available before hand 
---
&gt;lack of any new content
---
What is the point of new content for a broken game?
---
It's painful but you have to realize we're in Early Access.
---
You can’t get 3 stat armor pieces...you can. Get 3 STAR armor but there is no armor that gives you 3 stat bonuses.
---
Sounds like you know nothing about the update. 
---
Why dont you uninstall your game and get off this sub. You wont be missed either
---
yeah but just because you cleared through all the content and "stuff to do" in a few months doesn't mean the majority of users have.  It's ok to go away and come back later.  Destiny had the same complaints... Why would the devs focus on stuff for a small majority of players who've already put in hundreds of hours?  Like you can't do EVERYTHING in this game, and complain there wasn't value there.  You also can't expect a whole dev team to cater a 5 month old game to 5 or 10% of the user base.
---
How much does Betheshit pay you, shill ? Or you are just a person with shit taste. S H I T
---
I had no idea cosmetic paints add weight, haven’t bought any weapon skins yet
---
While this might be true, i can also say for sure the most, if not all, of those recurring bugs would have been noticed by players. i mean, come one, who wouldn't see that bobby pins suddenly weigh a metric ton again.
---
I am unable to access any supplies from my stash box while at my C.A.MP that are bulked. All it recognizes are loose items, even if I place bulk packages in my inventory to build at C.A.M.P it doesn’t recognize them. In order for me to continue playing, my bulk supplies must be manually broken down, for EVERYTHING. Every bench of every type doesn’t recognize my bulk, and everything I have is bulked that can be.  
---
People got fed up.
---
100% Agreed.
---
&gt;under 10 minutes. I see no problem 
---
yes all agree the tse needed nerfing, but not by 210% combined! (ts from 100 to 25, same for explosive and then demo card) that no-one, LITERALLY no-one asked for, the demo card nerf crippled the old normal explo weapons even more, they are not even a option anymore.
---
I was talking about this with my gf who has worked in a bunch of corporate settings and her first response was something like: "well, they clearly did the math and decided to devote X resources to this, knowing that even though it could result in a broken product it would result in the return they were looking for". I've been thinking about that a lot. 
---
hmm i could have been fighting a 50 and you a much higher lvl, who knows
---
&gt;ople really be out here downvoting, it’s like they don’t want to kill enemies quickly  
---
&gt;Rep
---
They are down voting because  it's obvious that the butt hurt is so strong with the TSE nerf and the bobble head stacking nerf.  
---
I do just fine against high- level enemies  with a level- 50 instigating Gatling gun and a level 50 furious gatling gun stacked with heavy weapons perks, stablized,  adrenaline, bloody mess. 
---
Now you have to actually put some thought into how you invest your perks. I knew guys with TSE weapons who didn't have a single perk invested in rifleman and were one- shot killing everything. 
---
Bother = Click workshop, click ok, stand still for ten seconds.
---
You then just walk away with a multitude of rewards.
---
So much effort.
---
So you correlate aware of a bug with being fixed within your personal acceptable timeframes?
---
I don't think you understand the words you're typing out and what it means.
---
People will be upset anyways. There is always a vocal minority that will complain about something
---
I swear the power armors are made of more screws and springs than the main component. You probably need less black titanium for the excavator armor than you do gears. 
---
It's a full set of super OP assassin's cavalier armor and an OP Bloodied Super Sledge with +40% swing speed. You just need a full set of OP breath under water armor to find it.
---
1. Look at the damage on high damage + low fire rate guns or 2H melee weapons.
---
2. Look at your max HP.
---

---
"To the dev team: please remember that this is a Fallout game."
---
Bethesda has never known what a Fallout game is, you mispelled Obsidian, or Black Isle.
---
I don't blame ya.  My friends are BORED.  If they'd at least dribble out some new content, I could try and hype them up and say "let's go do this new thing!".
---
Yeah I can see where you’re coming from..
---
Don’t use stealth myself so something like that never an issue for me 
---
More like 50,000. A pack of 100 bobby pins weighs maybe 10 grams.
---
But they are not unviable. That's my whole point, you are blowing it out of proportion and want to reroll melee cause it is the next op thing but you can't.
---
If your key argument is that big balance changes should come with point resets state so, don't push you viable/unviable and put one sentence about resets somewhere there. 
---
I finished all the quests during BETA but now I can not travel anywhere near Riverside without freezing. Big chunk of map I had no issue with during BETA but after the first patch started this freeze shit. Still no fix. 
---
Mind elaborating? The issues I see are with major content additions and online function.
---
Often the community based 'expansion' type landmass mods can be buggy and noticeably less quality than the base game. Exeptions to this are not hard to find: Enderal, Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. Pretty sure Bethesda said initially they don't plan on adding landmass anyway, expanding on existing content instead.
---
Online play could be complicated given that everyone will have different addons installed. With private servers, sure a few of them will be a mess. However online games with mods have been super successful - Garry's Mod, Minecraft, Terraria, Arma 3, Civ V, ARK just to name a few.
---
With 9 perk cards....
---
just replying to the post.  Nice downvotes.
---
I’ve just been hitting up for honor like I normally do, I recently got back into far cry 5, love shooting me some cultists 
---
Ok...
---
Bruh if that's how you get spaghetti, Bethesda has been the country of Italy since Oblivion. 
---
This is a problem that needs more focus. I’ve been trying to bring this up several times since launch the drop rates on 3* legendary creatures is fucked. Sometimes drops 2* n sometimes 1* sometimes a drill, flare gun or equally useless tool n sometimes nothing at all. Sometimes especially in whitesprings whole loots other normal ghouls you’ll find a random 1* or 2* legendary item. I am level 92 n have four 3* legendary items 2 weapons n 2 pieces of armor. There are even people doing research into the supposedly random drops of loot. I’ve had the same 2* legendary exterminator combat armor left arm drop repeated for me from the 3* ghoul in the parking lot by whitesprings resort. Check out the unofficial comprehensive bug list from 
---
r/Aten_Ra.
---
I feel your pain, but disagree about the plans. The old system caused people to spend hours server hopping to find plans or mods. Now a player can stay on the same server and actually play towards a goal of buying a plan with caps. I greatly prefer this system to the RNG lottery or server hop grind.
---
I looked at the prices and think they are reasonable given how insanely easy it is to acquire caps in this game. People were asking for a max cap increase, so prices really needed to go up on \*something\* that people want. Plans were a good choice.
---
Keep your head held high slugger, the current problems will get fixedd and then community will find something else to sulk/meme/write a dramatic goodbye letter for no one who cares over.
---
You are one of hundreds, possibly thousands.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
You really think those are the only people that are pissed? Damn dude you need to wake up. 
---
Not true in any way.
---
You might no play on a PTR, but others might. They'd find and report bugs and you'd profit from that.
---
And a Testserver is usually reset back to it's original state after a new update has been released. With the possibility to copy (not move!) one of your chars over from the main server.
---
I think it appropriate to quote Bethesda from November last year;
---
“We didn’t want you to think the silence meant nothing was happening. We're sorry and understand this was not the right approach, and we’ll work to make a better bridge between you and the dev team at BGS."
---
This is not better...
---
Nah, it's seemingly only for the Tricent Hatchet (which I just found out yesterday after getting a handy new hatchet from a drop). The Chrome Minigun, Camo Hunting Rifle and Patriot Combat Armor paints (aka the other paints I have excluding PA paint) don't add any weight, so I'm wondering why is the Tricent Hatchet the only exception for some reason?
---
Just a heads up.
---
I'm at level 123 and after the recent nerf I'm still running on the same hamster wheel that you are. If you were a Fallout 4 player and you were under the impression that you would eventually become super powerful in this game.....you like myself were wrong.
---
Bruh🤦‍♂️ common.
---
I don’t like the state of the game or their crosseyed patch notes, but let’s give a little dignity to the people stuck working on this game.
---
Atomic shop content is like asking someone to draw a picture on a post-it note while the rest of the team is trying to clean, remodel, rebuild a bombed out and bug ridden Sistine Chapel while all the tourists are still inside. And if it’s like any other game, no money, no time, bad managers. 
---
Thank you. Nobody who is in a happy relationship cares. And nobody needs a Negative Nancy around.  Learn this valuable life lesson now: its better to move on than hang around as a malcontent.
---
Can you explain bulking a bit more? What happens if I bulk them?
---
Well it was LITERALLY a step backwards for the last update (lol).  I still like the (Known) tag and reliable plan inventories though.
---
How long do you honestly believe they have? How long do video games last? If you don’t hit the launch well you don’t stay afloat. Something you should know Mr 7 years of research. This game isn’t going to ever be successful, it’s a throw away so they can pocket more money for their next titles. 
---
Just work currently. Thanks for asking 
---
I've tried the division, and I have a couple bad memories associated with the game, so I'll just leave that one alone. Thanks for the suggestion though. Hopefully bioware, or more pointedly, the publisher, don't shit the bed on anthem. It looks quite interesting and fun. 
---
I think players need to test themselves instead of blindly believing each other.
---
My Bobby pins show .1 but i can fast travel at 195/190.
---
Its just a display bug.....
---
I’m pretty much done after the game glitched away a complete set of excavator armor. Why did I need that armor? Because of the insane amount of grinding for screws and shit to keep stuff in working order and the 100 lb bonus helped with that. Fuck all that.  Tired of hunting for screws and springs.  
---
The problem is that players tend not to report bugs they perceive as benefiting them.  I know of people that would join beta tests with the sole purpose of finding beneficial exploits and providing disinformation about them to keep them in game.
---
The history of multiplayer games is devs making balance changes (good and bad) and players crying that it will ruin the game forever. I guarantee that the devs will do this again, most likely next target is melee builds. 
---
It would be best if this sub had a mechanism for allowing rants and venting without flooding the page with posts no one cares for.
---
I have an explosive western revolver with all the necessary perks and I 75 shot a mirelurk Queen. 
---
It's not millions though. It's like 5k, mats and quest weapons and shit.
---
A solid game defends itself
---
I’m disappointed. I’m just not going to launch the game until this bullshit is resolved. I was actually starting to have fun as of the last patch. You know, when I could kill things with a reasonable amount of bullets. That two-shot handmade made the game fun and the content doable and now it’s suffered a 70% damage reduction. 
---
I think I’ll play RE2 instead. 
---
I saw pictures with \~2000 damage, at least I don't blow myself up anymore, well only once lol
---
So anyone who has your job also has an awesome computer. Next!
---
Only if I quit completely. And even then, probably not. I'll either re-sell it or give it to one of my friends
---
Goodbye forever.
---
You think melee isn't going to be nerfed?
---
u/Ladydevann  Any news on respec or the need to massively nerf melee now.  A bloodied Melee can do 10,000+ dmg now, seems like a bigger problem now that a TSE handmade has been reduced to 150 or so damage points.
---
True. People are going to trash talk you for using TSE as if it's a crime though.
---
By sayin I am sticking by it, i mean I am not totally abandoning it. I will play on and off but not nearly as much as I have been. Likely not touch the ATOM store unless something outstanding comes out.
---
I will play other games and check back into Fo76 often hoping it gets the love the franchise deserves.
---
Should i fall in love with another MMO...well Fo76 had its chance and I will always be able to reload Fo4 when I need a fix.
---
That could be enough.
---
The only reason I'm still on is because of the camp but even that is losing me. Was a big sims fan growing up with the building being my favorite part. It's great in this game too but it's just too grindy to get all the plans and the atom shop is a joke. This game could have let us really use our imaginations between the camp and power armor but they never gave it any thought. Theres just not enough variety
---
Lmao the fact that you think its for 14-years old proves that you have the mental capacity of a wet tissue. Go back to Fallout seventyshit buddy
---
They shouldn't be. Pull them from the shop and get them working on more content for the game. Even fucking costumes is better at this point. They are only separate cause of greed. 
---
I keep watching social media waiting for people to start saying "oh most of the worst shit is fixed yay!" and start playing again, but...
---
Pipe revolvers and Molotov’s are effective, too. 
---
Waaaah  your not allowed to criticise our game from the god emporer. 
---
Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to nerf explosives.... this patch is horrible.
---
huh?
---
Finally someone who understands how life works. 
---
I’d like ammosmith to let me convert existing ammo to something else, e.g. .38 to .44 or 5.56.
---
We can’t sell ammo to vendors and it takes up stash space. So we ditch or build a crappy weapon to use it.
---
Just remember that pin works better an night...
---
Still at work myself
---
&gt;The mobs become bullet sponges at higher levels, guns NEED to be strong to compensate.
---
And TSE isn't the only strong weapons in the game. 
---
Instigating and furious effects work very well against bullet sponges. The catch is that you have to be smart about how you invest your perks. 
---
The TSE rifles allowed you to 1 or 2 shot kill anything with very little thought put into perk investment. 
---
Sorry you have to actually play the game like it was meant to be played now. 
---
I feel like people are confusing two shot with TSE. This was meant to be about just two shot right? Yes my TS only weapons kinda suck now. 
---
But guys PvP servers are on the way! That's something to look forward too /s
---
One year max. If they don't introduce a major content drop to take away the public's attention of the bugs, or shutdown the game and pull a Final Fantasy to remake it, Fallout is dead.
---
I think the system is fine as it is because it's the same as Fo4 and nobody complained then. sure, "the online component", but that's exactly what pvp servers are for.
---
no matter how you balance them out, legendaries will always give you an unfair advantage. so just disable them for pvp servers or nerf them so hard the bonus won't make that much of a difference.
---
I believe this way you please the most number of people. pve players don't really care about balance, mostly. multiplayer-centric players like the other guy who's replying to me would just have to deal with it, since you can't please everyone. same with pve players who decide to venture in pvp servers, no legendary crutches for you.
---
I recommend Kenshi. Made by an independent developer who never sold out, and doesn't take orders from some Corp bean counter whose only mandate is to cut corners, cut content, cut quality so billionaire investors can make a few bucks. 
---
Triple A is a dead concept. Time to stop throwing your money at its corpse. 
---
F you and your TSE nerf.
---
Don't calm down people. Find a new game to play and let the melee boys have their PvP game.
---
I didn't say I quit completely. Not yet, hopefully
---
ANNNDDD there goes all my monies.. I can’t even afford to fast travel now.. I got too excited!!
---
I think we may have the same route, but yeah IMO farming legendaries is so much more satisfying now.
---
Thanks for your absurdly vague and out of place reply. You're so awesome!
---
People didn't leave because of the TSE nerf. They left because of the following. Not being able to craft with bulk junk, old duping method is back, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
Your idea of opening a shop and gathering all the stuff to sell, sounds really great. Really unfortunate that you got destroyed by Bethesda.
---
This is really saddening. Players try to make this game great, even when it's shitty and all. Spending love to the beloved franchise and then get rekt by Beth. Feels really bad. Thumbs up, for beeing great and passionate. 
---
Not many people see that in this post, but I think you’re right, that or it’s testing it for starfield. This was cheap R&amp;D used to test online functionality on the Creation Engine and then sold to test the online with real players, that’s why they went with the “Break it” slogan, so they could learn for future projects and have us as big testers.
---
&gt; nerfing two shot was overkill
---
No, it wasn't. Two shot was adding +100% damage in addition to scaling multiplicatively with explosive. The next best was ____ Slayer's at +30% conditionally against specific targets.
---
In other words no other legendary prefix was worth using. 
---
If having your weapons reduced from literally dealing 400% damage of normal to a more reasonable 150% has made you stop playing... maybe you need to play better.
---
&gt;  You want to take everything you read online with a grain of salt good on you, but when your comment is giving people the impression you are calling them all liars for experiencing an issue that was fixed n now re-emerged makes you seem like a troll.
---
When they provide no proof of these issues reemerging and when what seems like everyone and their grand mother is willing to jump on literally any reason to hate on Bethesda. I am calling them a liar. Remember this was the same sub reddit that was convinced the game was going f2p because of a single youtuber talking to a friend who worked in a single game store in Australia. That eventually prompted Bethesda to officially announce it wasn't going f2p with some people still saying it could be because they never announce that until it goes f2p. 
---
Could you explain why its a terrible idea?
---
I've been playing rdr2 too. I finished the story once, and I'm on my second playthrough currently. Haven't touched 76 since probably late November. The level of immersion, detail and replay-ability of rdr is just miles beyond 76. 
---
"Make things more useful so you aren't just stuck with two choices in the end game."  &lt;&lt; You nailed it.
---
[tHiS gAmE iS bAd](https://tenor.com/KjVL.gif) 
---
I will! And kudos to you being such an awesome person. Have a nice day!
---
NO ONE CARES 
---
Nah, this is a multiBILLION dollar company that employs hundreds of talented AAA artists and software designers. They could had fixed this game before launch. They didn’t, they don’t deserve patience at all. 
---
I think they were op for sure. I'm disappointed they shared it so drastically right off the bat. I think a 50% cut would have been perfect. I just will be swinging my super sledge more now 😂 seems like melee was always the developers main focus anyways I'm 76. I never used the power user perk due to the acceptable use rates with the cores and using the Sprint perk card. It seemed like since the updated I was watching my power levels sink like a ship. I'm level 174. So after all those hours it just seemed like I was burning them at a much faster rate then I've ever noticed. I don't have a reference of before the patch. Just caught me as odd ya know.
---
I really feel this is the true issue, I bet the developers are losing their collective minds right now.
---
Go to a tinkers workbench and go to “bulk” bulking raw material items enable u to sell them. Depending what u bulk will determine the price. For examples. Raw steel scraps are not sellable, but bulk steel is sellable. If u walk around scrapping and bulking what u don’t need ur get ur cap count up
---
Me too, imma play once more patches arrive, but for now, imma just continue my Legend playthrough of Yakuza 0
---
Aaaaand strawman.
---
&gt;brought Bethesda down from one of my favorite studios to one I have lost respect for
---
He never said Bethesda betrayed him, he said he has lost respect for Bethesda.
---
FairPlay. Upvoted for not just wanting the game to be easier.
---
It was fun for awhile but yes it got stale pretty fast, definitely a bit more challenging now.
---
What are people supposed to do if they're not happy with the state of the game, if not voice their dissatisfaction and concerns? 
---
Well I had the same impression but IDK I am doing side quests too yet I cant kill the guys in my quest line...
---
You’re welcome
---
I hope there is an official bug report with this pasted in.
---
I know that house.. it’s got all those plastic  bowls and cat corpses.
---
Good!
---
Today seems to be an exception. Before today what I said was true.
---
Hmmm as a WoW player lemme tell ya those hardly fix anything
---
Uhhh this community is more like fyre.
---
Devs are probably ignoring this cry baby community.
---
Where the fuck is sea of thieves? Lol. Similar situation and they are still sinking. Pun intended 
---
If you mean Fallout 5 as the real game, you'll be waiting longer than Elder Scrolls fans have since that whole ESO release thing
---
Nope no stabilized either 
---
just wanted to point out skeet shooter isn't really a necessity except for two-shots. their accuracy is terrible but regular/non-ts ones are fine.
---
You sound like a super.  Or maybe one of the Neanderthal whales who paid real money for an in game weapon that got nerfed, must feel bad to waste mommy and daddy’s money.
---
Yet again,  you can 1 hit melee enemies that are way stronger than that with an average build. You argument is pointless. I agree they were OP but so was just about anything and everything else. The enemies are too bullet spongy to justify this type of nerf and all the nerfs that keep happening. They get rid of melee and then everyone is fucked. Including yourself clearly
---
Yeah I agree with halifaxes.   I don't know what these people were smoking wanting to have weapons that break again.  It's bullshit. 
---
I know this isn't the right place to ask but I have lol 50 forest armor and I bought polymer mods and aerodynamic and custom fitted mods from enclave but the problem is that custom fit and aerodynamic mods don't show up to be able to put on my armor at an armor bench but the polymer mods went on fine. I can't find anything anywhere for 2 days of googling lol plz plz someone save me from smashing my bfs xbox. Also btw I have armorer perk 2 for armor mods so I assume that's all I need right?
---
For everyone 1 comment in here there would be 1000 who feel the same
---
I understand the issues with the current patch. I also think that this is not the last time that we will have issues with a patch nor the last time that people feel cheated because they spent time and effort to get something and new players no longer have too. I am not against people being frustrated. I am against these passive aggressive rant posts that fill the sub and make me regret coming here.
---
I love your vision of a fallout mmo. Made me smile, but sad at the same time.. As we may never see that game. 
---
Would like something Fallout 1-2 inspired. NCR, Enclave, BOS.
---
The tse is barely the issue anyone is talking about. Read more on what the patch actually changed, and widen your view a bit...
---
given how broken some aspects are right now with abilities and perks (PA Targeting HUD CTD'ing for example) I wouldn't be surprised if that is broken now too
---
I'd LOVE to grind in this game but its really not fun at all. 
---
I thought the nuke stuff sounded amazing at first but after doing it a few times its really not, at all.
---
Same here. Today was the day! Currently playing the Nintendo Switch Octopath Traveler. 
---
A lot of people quitting. Where are all the downvoter that told me to go fuck myself when I said the playerbase will just up and leave because of the bugs and improper development. Well I hate to say it but I told you so, get bent assholes.
---
I have basically the same setup. A level 68 supermutant used to die in like 3 shots, now takes 20+.
---
It wasn't really balance when you consider how slowly power armor decays versus non-PA. I can't remember the last time I repaired my power armor and I don't even use the durability perks. Several weeks ago at least. I don't know why they felt the need to bring white knight inline with power patcher (or whatever it was). They made the numbers the same but completely disconnected from the reality of how these perks affect the armor they're assigned to.
---
You bring up an excellent point! The early game was the best part. 
---
Exactly my point 
---
Why would he goes his stuff to you.  
---
Hate to break it to you, this is a lost cause. Nothing will change and just remember:     
---
     
---
 FOR THEIR NEXT 20 RELEASES DO NOT BUY INTO THE HYPE! DO NOT BUY THEIR GAMES UNTIL THEY GO ON SALE AND ALL THE SUCKERS HAVE ALPHA-TESTED IT FOR YOU.
---
I'm gonna jump back into FO4 or 3 for a bit I think and let the game get fixed some more. 
---
NMS?  Well, it's pretty casual unless you do permadeath.  But, man, if you want gunplay, it won't be as visceral as 76, but if you want exploration?  NMS hits that spot.  So much to explore.  And base building?  Man...  Base building in NMS is 100 times more in depth and epic.  I only wish I had turrets in NMS, but other than that, I can go nuts creating a giant tower or underwater base for days.
---
&gt; They are hemorrhaging users quickly, and it's hard to regain a burned customer.
---
What's the target audience of bethesda? 12-25 year old males?
---
If you've played 2 Fallout games from bethesda already, they don't care about you anymore, more lucrative fresh meat is waiting.
---
I mean, you aren’t wrong. It’s either a post like this, or a post talking about “muh TSE nurfed”. 
---
Not to sound like an advertiser, but regarding the "all powerful" part, I think I had an easier time doing that in WoW.  You can run old dungeons and absolutely shite on bosses that took the best of the best to kill.  You can collect cool transmogs (armor sets that you can put the appearance of on your current armor) from old bosses and flex to everyone on how you got the rarest gear.  I found that the more prestige looks costed IRL money in ESO.
---
Also I will give you a heads up that the enemies scale in ESO, so at no point can you 1 shot (at least I never could).  I agree though, absolutely loved the customization options in the game, better than any other game, though I wish the sets themselves were cooler.  I also loved the level rewards, though another heads up, that stops at 50.
---
Do you use mods?
---
Hooray to your path of recovery. No just kidding. Once a zealot always a zealot.
---
I'm pretty sure the girl from Bethesda who posts here uses a melee build. Obvious case if selective hearing on her part.
---
Coolio...
---
Good luck with that. Pretty sure by now 76 its being kept by a small team, probably an inexperienced one too, abandoned while the main focus shifts to their unreleased games. Bethesda didn't invest a lot of money into this to begin with, I doubt they will invest more money just to bring better devs to a game that they probably already moved on from.
---
People should move on from this too, you were all taken for a ride, and while you continue here, you will still be taken advantage of. Respect yourselves, say no, and leave.
---
Can we have some sort of official statement saying what's going on behind the scenes? Bethesda has made mistake after mistake with Fallout 76 and your fans have completely lost trust in you.
---
Post some sort of statement acknoweldging Fallout 76 is deeply flawed and that the company has screwed up on several occassions after launch. Give players who bought the game at launch partial refunds (and NOT in the form of atoms). Post another statement saying *exactly* what the plans for the games future are and make sure you follow through with them. Be as transparent as possible with Fallout 76 and all games in the "near" future (Fo76 has caused people to lose faith in Starfield and TES6 as well as just the Fallout franchise). If not, you'll end up going the Konami route.
---
Of course we don't forget Bethesda have made great games in the past but keep in mind thats exactly it, the past. People generally expected a lot more form Bethesda. It was sold to us as a AAA title but its barely even AA. It was a series of events that damaged Bethesda reputation in and around the game that has disillusioned so many. 
---
We were told the beta would be full access if we pre-ordered and the day before they told us it was timed. The game releases and its a barely playable buggy mess and it was not exactly even close to "16 times the detail" that Todd described. Of course there was the whole canvas bag/dark rum incidents. Then they bugged out their support site so everyone could see either others support tickets with their personal details. To make things worse they are still using the same Gamebryo for future titles when its clearly quite dated and they need to change.
---
To put it bluntly a lot of people regarded it as a bait and switch. A lot of people feel they were sold a blatant lie. They hyped up this game like crazy, got all the pre-orders in and then sold us a buggy mod for Fallout 4. That's why Bethesda may never have the same consumer trust they had before which equals less pre-orders and far more people waiting on review scores.
---
Here here, great game! Anyone bitching about it hasn’t played since the updates. 
---
# #Quit76
---
I appreciate the help, IDK if I will log in again to try tbh. I got mine off of SBQ first time I killed it.
---
It let's Bethesda know just how bad they Fd up.
---
http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/cut.gif please don't   do this "legacy crowd" shit,oof.
---
Categoricshoe47 join my gamr
---
I think that is a brilliant idea!! 
---
Not a single one, game is clean
---
I like the game. I’m not a bot life. I don’t even thing I have 150 hours yet on the game. 
---
So you guys have 2 incompetent teams working on 76 then? The atom store would be better if there was stuff worth buying.
---
Not trying to be “original” just displaying my opinion for note.
---
Ran selective boot with all non windows services and start up programs turned off. Never check cpu/memory load.
---
I certainly can. Im fine with zero new fallout games going forward. The lore is absolute shit at this point. Much rather hope for starfield and ES6 to not suck donkey balls then hold my breath for F5.
---
Just some cream
---
&gt; I think people forget these guys created the games we grew up on
---
I hate to break it to you, but those aren't the same guys who made FO76. Everything eventually changes, for better or worse.
---
Wow. So original. 
---
Okay. Bye. 
---
You know, that actually might be a reason for me to play it on PS4 instead. Thanks :)
---
People dropped the full price of a AAA title on this game.
---
Places like reddit serve to demonstrate to a developer how frustrated a player is - that is feedback and all feedback is valuable feedback.
---
Not all feedback needs to be constructive or sugar coated. 
---
In fact, it works against the game in the long run - Bethesda needs to see a communities true and unfiltered thoughts and feelings as to changes etc to get a proper feel for their core player base and plan accordingly.
---
It's totally ok to call a company out and should be encouraged.
---
I personally like to think that this community will ultimately ensure a better product when it comes to the next major releases as Bethesda (and other major AAA devs) see the continued backlash here and learn that saying you are listening to a community and actually listening to them are two entire different things.
---
Speaking of low effort posts.
---
you stock pile a lot of them if you do events or primarily use healing salves  for hp 
---
Irrational text block VATS targets my brain. Critical strike!
---
Dead By Daylight is awesome. 
---
(Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage) + ((bloodied + melee) or (stealth sniper + any weapon)) = fun
---
That's what eso does before new DLCs are released except you're forced to start a new char. I thought it was a good way to test and balance the game. 
---
Try completing the basic training quest 
---
with mild arthritis   and just a keyboard and mouse 
---
I feel screwed out of $60  because i cant advance in the quest line  without a military id  
---
Seriously. Take a whole year if need be. Take all the time needed to make the game what it should've been at launch. Months afterward it's still broken. It would be funny if it weren't so infuriating.
---
This is worth mentioning more than once.. stealth is completely broken. 
---
Do Hardened Masses get scrapped when you do a bulk scrapping like before?
---
But you are ignoring questions about the roadmap: do you have any idea when we can expect to see it?
---
I use non TS or E heavy guns, except TS cryolator (it sucks majorly but when facing enemies at level 25 it is a very fun weapon). Have no problems in content, and any rifle build outperforms me generally. 
---
Not sure why you’re being downvoted, crowns definitely drop legendary 
---
Yeah WTF, first it was a youtube hatetrain. Then a /r/Fallout hatetrain, now there is one here as well? How come everyone else seems to have problems with this game? What are they all doing wrong to not enjoy it?
---
I like how they put 700 hours i to it and think they deserve a refund
---
Ouch that sucks, would have been better not to know and assume it was a low level nocturnal wooden shin guard :(
---
\\¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I moved the perk point out of perception and put on a pair of glasses to make up for it. rounded me off to a cool 15 points in strength so I can't complain, just wish I knew it wasn't working before I insisted on being irradiated all the time 
---
I get what you're saying and I agree it would go a long way to ease the sting of the nerfs, but I feel at this point people could have been leveling various perks with their build to be able to swap to in the event something like this happens. Unless it's an entire reallocation of special points... But say for whatever reason a serrated machete is broken op like tse was stacking with de. If Bethesda were to take all serrated machetes out of the game to tweak them and also nerfed the perks to boost that power I feel everyone who exploited that technique shouldnt be compensated when they finally fix it. So if they are to compensate everyone for a respec now, who's to say that crowd won't also request a respec then? And then again for every adjustment to perks from here on out? Where do you draw the line and say this instance alone deserves a respec, but anything else no matter how small or large doesn't deserve a respec also?
---
The changes made were severe I do agree, but the niche builds are still more viable now than without those perks so I just don't agree that people should be compensated. That's my opinion anyway. 
---
The rest of us aren’t aloud to have fun anymore, why should you?
---
I do the same thing for shotgun shells! I think the hunt for ammo is the most fun out of the grind because I can do the events at each location. I would like to see more of this 
---
This is why melee is much more powerful than other builds. We could nerf it so that it doesn't boost the damage but I think it allows for interesting build decisions if it's left in.
---
If other SPECIAL stats give increased combat performance than we can bring other builds up to speed for melee. Like Agility needs to grant pistol and sneak bonus damage, intelligence for energy weapons etc.
---
..bluescreen of death, on PC?
---
Skin prices were leaked for anthem. $20 for a single one and it looks like shit.
---
Eh. You can pick up more than one but it's not showing you how many you have. Ever see one on the ground when you spawn in? Check your inventory and you didn't drop the one it says you have but there is one on the ground and it can't be picked up. Something is fucky with it. 
---
I didn’t bother reading it. The other complainers covered your concerns already...I am sure
---
No Man's Sky took time to get to its current state though. We can only hope that FO76 adds more pve content and mechanics.  I would love to see more interesting workshops, server rework and more interesting weapons and armor instead of the current copypaste.
---
I am low myself, but I can spare some.
---
No they don't because they ultimately get deleted so that the sub doesn't bog down. 
---
If the ultimate goal is to show Bethesda their mistakes then a stickied sub with all the rants would let them see the aggregate effects of the patch or at least how it effects the sub portion of die hard players that this sub attracts 
---
lol.
---
Wow, turns out I'm just really bad at this game lmao
---
If that were true they wouldn't be trying to convince others here to quit with them. Definitely a hivemind effect, ha. It's more than likely embellished more than a bit
---
Check out [The Outer Worlds](https://outerworlds.obsidian.net/). Not post apocalyptic but by Obsidian, so it may be better.
---
No problem bud..maybe make a thread in the market subs..im sure plenty of ppl here have extra like me..i also love chameleon..i was thinking about buying the recipe
---
I have better luck dodging them when I sidestep and circle around the mob vs just a sidestep. I do this by sidestepping and panning the camera so my character stays facing the mob.
---
By doing this I avoid 90% of attacks. It almost seems as though they spread their arms just before the position they targetted you in, so a plain sidestep leaves you in the extended radius of their arm spread, but by sidestepping and circling you usually end up behind the radius of their arm spread.
---
Another angry Ebayer
---
Well that about sums it up. 
---
now the devs are going to turn their entire focues on nerfing melee.
---
until everybody with everything maxed only deals 1 point of damage to the queens pool of millions of HP...because balance and it just works! Am I right? :D
---
I don't have the plans for it but that's a cool idea. It's a really stupid, clunky alternative to a simple disable-the-switch hotfix, but then again, it's Bethesda, so. 
---
People are now frustrated and want others to be frustrated. 
---
Move onto a different game company altogether.
---
Ahh yeah that makes a lot more sense, I'm actively not playing it but I will absolutely pick it up when they sort out all these issues (and hopefully release a single player/offline mode). I just see people constantly rattling off lists of negatives then end with "but I'm still playing" so I misread your comment as that. 
---
&gt; Should i fall in love with another MMO...well Fo76 had its chance and I will always be able to reload Fo4 when I need a fix.
---
Unfortunately for me WoW has lost it's flame, so I'm diving into my other hobbies and playing non mmo-games instead. I'm having a blast playing through Fallout New Vegas again and I'll replay a modded FO4 when I'm done. Rimworld, Divinity Original Sin 2, Witcher 3, Cities:Skylines, Grim Dawn, and Path of Exile are all on my list too - if you needed some good suggestions of what to play. Hopefully BSG pull their head out of their asses and iron out these kinks sooner rather than later, lots of potential in 76 but unfortunately for me it all falls flat giving the glaring problems. 
---
Releasing an idiotic patch is the same as corrupting game data?
---
I'm done with this conversation, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about or you're a troll. Not to mention a litany of legal reasons why your original idea wouldn't work 
---
I know a few people in this situation...
---
There are many reasons to not pre-order anything, but it boils down to you getting sold an idea and giving a company money for something that does not exist yet. 
---
The way software development works is that limitations that the dev team find as they build it will be a part of the software - this may end up affecting what the final product will be.
---
Don't pre-order anything unless you are ready to accept that you are buying marketing bullshit that may never be what they promised, at *some* point in the future.
---
Duke Nukem anyone?
---
And again next time they do it?
---
They clearly want us to do less damage.
---
Your build is bad and you should feel bad ;)
---
&gt; Can I ask why it was a bad thing that TSE weapons were so powerful? 
---
Because it isn't a single player game. Players stacking buffs to make themselves gods is fine in an offline single player but not online multiplayer game. 
---
&gt;  I was never able to ko a SB in a few shots but now I need two to take down a lvl 10 super mutant. 
---
You were not but others have been. The video I linked to another player showed someone with a level 46 Gauss Rifle. The base damage before perks was around 650-700 damage. Once he added the perks the damage jumped up over 1,700 damage. 
---
You must have a very low level one because my level 30 Hunting Rifle is also capable of pretty much if not actually 2 hit killing level 10 super mutants and it only has 94 damage. 
---
&gt; There are loading issues that weren't present before yesterday. The bulk item thing while small is dumb.
---
I've not noticed any new loading issues. And bulk items have never auto scrapped to be used for me. I've always had to scrap the adhesive I've bought to use it. What has been fixed is the game will now pull from my stash and inventory when crafting. Were before it would only pull of stash. So if I had 10 screws needed but 2 were in my inventory it wouldn't let me build the gun.
---
&gt; PvP isn't really practical either way, unless they get around to faction building.
---
Yea people complain PvP isn't practical and if they are going to do anything about it. Including introducing a PvP oriented game mode were PvP is always on. Instant KO weapons like that are a problem. It will be bad enough players will most likely be camping outside the vault to attack new players. But turning PvP into who ever fires first wins is shitty. 
---
&gt; As far as core spawns go, do people mean at generators or in the wild? I haven't been able to find a core at any of the places I usually check.
---
Yes that is what they are talking about. And I've always had a problem finding them. Because unlike containers that are unique for each person over world items you have to compete against all other players on the map.  That is why farming ballistic fiber is also a massive pain because there are only a handful of locations with them to spawn and you are almost literally fighting everyone over level 25 for those spawn locations. 
---
I sell drugs 
---
People had to have bought them in order for duping to be lucrative enough to keep doing it, but yeah no one would have bought a quad. Even still, maybe try aiming for weak spots? Can't one-shot a protectron in the face but I can if he takes it in the chest
---
Best course of actions would be to make weapons last a lot lot longer and increase the repair cost to balance BUT at same time give us springs and screws for taking weapons apart as well this would give us more play time while reducing some of the more meh grind of the game 
---
5x durability  
---
2x repair cost   
---
10% of a weapons materials should be salvaged on scrapping   
---
Hopefully they will, hopefully all studios will soon but noone can tell.
---
IMHO everyone is just waiting for a brave warrior who adds this in multiplayer games to see what happens, i.e. kiddos' rage vs grown ups who don't care and just buy a mouse for MP FPS games if they think it's an advantage (or trackball if couch-locked).
---
Would be great as better MMOs could hit consoles - and better control for MMOs in general (tried a few on xbox, not very good).
---
I dread to think how poorly maintained their code-base is considering how badly this patch is performing. First load of my character and I CRASH immediately to desktop. Is it a client-side or server-side issue? Who knows. My wife crashed 2 or 3 times in a row trying to load her game. We literally never crashed prior to this patch. It was once in a blue moon.
---
There is no excuse for this to happen, it's almost as if someone deleted the latest source code and now they're having to make a fake patch out of old bug-ridden code. I guess I could speculate all day given yesterday's experience. 
---
As someone else put it, at least put a BETA test server up, because that would show some level of common sense. It is painfully obvious they lack the sufficient resources to do effective Q&amp;A.
---
I know there is a bug with "Strange in Numbers" perk and groups.  If you invite someone to a group and they do not accept, and you're solo, that will sometimes shut off mutations until the person declines or accepts.  If in a group of 2 and a member leaves, but stays at the main menu, it sometimes keeps you in a group of 1.  That will disable mutations as well.
---
Unequiping the card sometimes fixes it, but making sure you are not in a solo group in the social tab usually fixes it right up.
---
&gt; Even with Gunsmith 5
---
Reading is important.
---
If they would make it like guild wars 2 ... separate then they could balance it.
---
I agree with everything you said, but damn man use some punctuation
---
Thank you so much for following up about this.
---
I would like to mention that if a perk like White Knight is "over performing" - which I infer means you see a lot of players using it - that probably means that it is necessary.
---
In my experience with &amp; without using White Knight armor breaks too quickly without it. This made White Knight mandatory and yes this was a problem.
---
However, if you reduce the effectiveness of White Knight from 90% to 60% this causes armor to break 4x faster. There should at the same time be an adjustment to the base durability of armor increasing it 4x. This would allow people to do battle without feeling that White Knight was mandatory while it could still be equipped for the convenience of less frequent repairs.
---
It would also be appreciated if you applied the same logic to Gunsmith, another "mandatory" perk. Reduce it to 3 perk points, reduce its effect from 50% to 30% and increase the base durability of guns by 40%. (Don't forget to adjust all the gun and mod recipes that require Gunsmith 5).
---
The company might not let them do this though. Happened a lot in Star Wars battlefront 2. 
---
Haha. Ok dude. People are saying much worse, I'm just suggesting that maybe they have something up their sleeve.
---
Everything is a grind unless its a 30hr single player experience game.
---
No shit dude, yet here everyone is, saying Bethesda as a whole can't be redeemed. This sub wants Bethesda to fail. 
---
&gt;Even with Gunsmith 5
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_ PLEASE! Let us help you! 
---
TSE is two shot explosive which is two shot but has two stars
---
&gt; Also KH3 is a better game lol
---
True, but I have a couple friends who play FO76 with me and despite the annoyances, it has been enjoyable.
---
i think carry weight is buggy again. i had 530 carry weight today, just wearing the excavator with motion assist servo torso mod and with 11 str.
---
Couldn't explain why
---
Yeah, it really does seem like a lot of these issues might be prevented by just having *someone* play test these versions before release. Might not have found the duping back, but the bobby pins.
---
But from a balance perspective at least, I do truly wonder if anyone involved in balance decisions is actually playing the damn game. There are so many bizarre choices
---
It shouldn’t take 4-5 shots to kill a single trash mob enemy 100+ levels below you.  Sorry, but that is not balance.
---
Why would they care if they lost players that are not actively subscribed to a game? You already paid full price for the game, they got your money.. So they can't sell you more clothes, I doubt that will drive them out of business.
---
Rad worms is doing way more than just buffing the rads you take by 50%, it is actually buffing/nerfing random stats and perks by 50%
---
Last night I had lvl 4 lockpick, was only recieving a 1.5str boost from the motion assist mod on my PA, purfied water was restoring 37% for awhile with no perks. Marsupial jump heights and weapon damage were all over the place.
---
Who knew one disease could break the game so well?
---
My game has started to freeze now and then after this patch. Just like when I quit to desktop instead of alt tab close. Super annoying.
---
We call that an ALPHA
---
see I use a mix of weapons so I tend to not need ammo as much and I use explosives I find to even the odds so I'm not as big of a lead need but I am a crafter and making weapons to scrap is a pain to unlock all the mods 
---
Get therapy.
---
Oh yeah good point. Thanks for bringing that up. People get frustrated dealing with the same problem over and over. Bulk bug is new though!
---
You have to understand that when we hear "you are being heard," at this point, those are completely empty words. 99.9% of our complaints and issues go unaddressed, and the ones that do get addressed are obvious issues that are weeks or months old and the "fix" breaks the game even more. The to-do list must be a hundred pages long at this point and the developers are still on page 1.
---
I appreciate what you do. I don't envy your job. I know you have no control over the competence of another department.
---
But when I imagine the BGS team behind FO76 and the state of the game, I picture a damage control call center with every alarm, red light, and whistle going off, CS reps frantically answering phones, while the developers are sitting in the back wondering why the square pegs don't fit in the circle holes despite the 10,000 calls pleading for them to use the circle pegs.
---
I've been playing PUBG a lot more since the winter map came out. And its servers are a LOT more stable than 76's amazingly. I still play 76 though for shenanigans with my friends who don't have PUBG
---
How many hits do you feel it should take to kill a level 91 Deathclaw with a giant hammer and enough strength to press a VW Beetle. Whatever number that is, do you think a regular melee character could take that many hits back from it?
---
Once again you failed to read even your own linked thread. Post 28 from ZOS_TristanK
---
&gt;Hi, folks. When we began development for ESO, we licensed the HeroEngine so that we could hit the ground running. We used it as a tool for things like area prototypes and design concepts so that we could begin honing the art style. HeroEngine was our whiteboard: a great tool to put our ideas in the game and seeing them while the production engine was in development.
---
The gameinformer article was a direct interview with ZOS. 
---
I’m upset that connectivity issues returned. I’m upset they haven’t fixed the issue with 3* legendary creatures not dropping 3* loot. I am level 92 without any TSE or even explosive weapon drops. The not so random loot generator is fucked too I’ve received the same 2* legendary exterminator combat armor left arm several times already from the same 3* ghoul in the parking lot by the whitesprings resort. These are the issues I n a few others have with this game that need to be addressed. Not weapon nerfs or buffs, not new emotes, outfits, n quests. Some of us never even had these weapons drop for us ever n are continually being given shit legendary effects on underpowered weapons. Like bonus in vats with melee weapons before you enter combat. Like how in the fuck do you expect me to enter melee range undetected to use this weapon? The system is broken n needs to be fixed before any new content is added. Overhaul the entire loot system because whatever they did to tweak it from fallout 4 to what it is now is nothing but a deliberate scheme to make people look for purchasable options to circumvent the loot system. 
---
Cause you state the reason for reroll is cause it is "inefficient" and you want to arrange it to the next op thing? No idea honestly how I got this sentiment. 
---
The Roadmap is: More nerfs, less fun, more tedium. It's all about the GRIND!!!!1111!!!!!
---
Its noon EST. 9 PST. The majority of America is at work or at school. The day has come, yes. It is no longer night time, correct. This early in the day every game, except for like, Fortnite , is dead. Im personally playing something right now i normally wouldn't play because server pops are so low this time of day  
---
I've been playing nonstop since release and I can confirm there's been several dips in the playerbase. nuked whitesprings is a great way to measure activity and it's been dead since the past weekend.
---
people said it's because of the Anthem beta? maybe that did it. people will need a good incentive to come back now.
---
Leaving fo76 for Anthem.
---
Hah.
---
Don't forget that for a quite a few players (myself included), disconnects are more frequent than they were in the beta. 
---
Take my upvotes!!
---
Grafton 
---
And when that happened you continued to play... It's a release on dopamine when you hear that legendary drop. The pillar into the sky. It feels great! Now it's empty in FO76... You don't even know if you'll get a drop.
---
That's because in 76 if a high level character enters an area before you......they spawn high level enemies. The storyline of the game forces you into these areas where high level players farm.
---
In Fallout 4 enemies always scale to you. In 76 you end up fighting spawns from much higher level players.
---
If you're at level 25 and you think it's insane that you're fighting level 68 Super Mutants....... you're correct it is insane and you're fighting spawns from a higher level player.

---
Its happened to me 5 or 6 times so far. 
---
&gt; They're not exactly reinventing anything here right?
---
Right. It's a cultural problem, I guess. 
---
These are some weird, not cool things about the game industry, but I don't know that any of them can be fingered as the cause of Patchpocalypses and the other BS we see. 
---
* More possibility for prima donnas to exist
---
* Pay generally worse than other kinds of software
---
* Hours generally worse than other kids of software (yay [crunch time](https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577))
---
* In my experience, there is often a tendency to drink your own Kool-Aid: "We're making a \#FranchiseName game, the players aren't going anywhere."
---
Beats me man. I miss the fun parts of working in games (the making up games part!) but I do not miss anything else about it. 
---
I'm already there. I reinstalled FO4 last night, patched and started loading my mods.
---
Because FO4 just works... With mods
---
oh yeah 
---
*Lets be honest ENEMIES ARE NOT OVERPOWERED*
---
I would also agree that most guns save for some are just fine now.
---
The biggies issue right now is weapon durability.
---
But the main point enemies are over powered.. seriously dude?
---
You can literally do EVERY SINGLE MISSION AND KILL EVERY SINGLE ENEMY IN THE GAME save the SBQ all by yourself.
---
One of the main issues on reviews for FO76 was that the enemies were brain dead and how they only need a few shots to kill.
---
So I hate people who say FO76 has over powered enemies lmao. 
---
Yeah I didn't think about it at the time, but this patch really F's over people who run player shops in this game.
---
I have a friend that purchased ANOTHER copy of the game just so he could dual box on his PC and have 1 guy as his static trader.  I'm sure his trader guy is over the weight limit so he can't get trades done now.
---
Yes the weight limit f'd dupers and that's good.  But it also f'd legit small traders and that's bad.  It literally took CONTENT away from my game.
---
I bought a trap plan from him a few days ago for 1,500 caps.  Really enjoyed getting that.  Bet he's not selling stuff now.  I bet he regrets that second game copy purchase.
---
The fact that your post got downvoted just proves how terrible this community is. That was a totally rational and objective comment. A third of the community will downvote anything positive, a third will downvote anything negative, and a third (at best?) actually looks at this continuing saga objectively, and they get downvoted by the other 2 groups. 
---
Here's a +1 for objectivity. Now to await my downvotes. 
---
Get your kid to do that part for you?
---
Unfortunately we live in a world where there is a large amount of people who feel it’s their duty to change everything to meet their own opinions regardless of how it affects anyone else. Reddit is a discussion board, not a downvote everything you disagree with board.
---
Nothing is going to change unless we can all have a healthy discussion about this stuff.
---
Stop shoving your opinions down everyone’s throat vault dwellers, accept others opinions and debate them in a civilized manner please. It will help all of us as a community to bring the real issues to light. If you’re too immature to handle that, keep it to yourself. 
---
Thanks for being real OP, take my upvote 
---
90% of the equipment is destined to the atom store, better have patience 
---
I have no reason to play with the explosive and 2 shot nerfs. Enjoy the game guys!
---
People's expectations are pretty warped. Played game since beta. I had a good time. Put down and moving on until substantial dlc. I know people try to play these online games endlessly but that's not exactly what happens either. Getting up in the business side of things is pretty stupid but just my opinion. Play the game and have fun and then move on. Or if your terribly offended by the company you would have never played in the first place.
---
Star field 
---
money 
---
all that anger now they think will be star field money later. 
---
I'd agree with you if the nerfs had been universal and fair. as it is someone at Bethesda is suspiciously favoring axes.
---
Yeah, I have two alts that I never leveled up (one looks like Robert Downey Jr, named Tony Stark, going power armor energy weapons build, another looks like Chris Hemsworth, named Thor Odinson, going 2H build :D).  I think I'll start playing them more if I keep playing.
---
This helps on XONE too.
---
Get a life
---
I drop close to 100 a day randomly across the map, like other person said hitting events gives plenty. Jumping to event will give you access to areas you may not have explored yet
---
Lol it would be a couple weeks until the "unofficial fo76 patch" that fixed 800+ bugs hits.
---
Plus the fact that those 100 missiles weigh 200 pounds, which makes Excavator mandatory.
---
&gt; And Gwent? What a shit game. Still don't get the attraction.
---
You n'wah
---
They confirmed that pricing is an iteration and they got caught so they're going to iterate again.
---
Hopefully it goes through some more QA before it goes live going forward. We as a community ask for these changes to be done as quickly as possible and also they push them trying to fight exploiters. Hopefully they test things internally a bit more in regards to bugs
---
Oh look ! Another little fanboys who don't appreciate that we criticize this shitty games.
---
Yes, every other post.... :-)
---
Yep i have the same issues. I dont bulk stuff anymore
---
I love how some guy posts a paragraph on the nature of observations in response to your mild disagreement. These people are crazy. Also, I expect all these people who “quit” will not be back here to post or be seen in game.
---
mine is acker1321 but I have my settings were people can send me a friend request so I’ll send you one when I get home
---
I always have way too many stimpaks. My vampire's weapons heal me in battle and my perks heal me outside of battle. The carry weight is a bit of a problem as I traded my weight reduction perks for combat, auto-repair, and mutation perks
---
You can just not play a video game you don't like. We don't need the resignation letter. This isn't a job and we aren't your co workers. Just go play something else dude
---
Me? Lol no, I never bought any, but I won't lie that I did thought about it after everyone had them and I did't but actually my first TSE was a pump Shotgun, that I trade for the current TSE 50 Cal.
---
Right. Because I can kill a ghoul with 3 mini nukes to the face makes it on fair level with everything. If I can solo kill it but expend all my ammo it’s a fair fight. Nice argument. Also the few shots was level scaling. Anything below 50 is laughably easy. Balancing is a wreck in this game
---
I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here;
---
I believe that the game needed to focus PRIMARILY on stability fixes and ending cheaters. Now, Ideally this is what yesterday's patch was to do.
---
Once those things are addressed, I'm all for new content and game balancing.
---
We literally cannot play because it crashes either on loadup or on start of events for myself or my wife. 
---
this is not entitlement, this is US not being able to PLAY the goddamn game at all. You may be lucky, but there are a lot of us who can't even load in.
---
Yeah, although people just need to be patient and calm about things, act civil and not to fly off the handle at everything they don't approve of
---
there are some smartasses here but i too noticed severe dips in players for a while and before i stopped playing last week i couldn't find more than 5 other people on a server even during peak hours.  it was weird and ghostly.  nothing like when i first started
---
oooh no, the big bad endgame boss is too hard to kill now? whatever will we do?
---
Is this because of the crafting material bag and dlc? 
---
I the bag is the single most useful item you can pay for. If you dont have it expect to be going to a bank very often.
---
I also get this bug and the one where you get stuck if you look at your pip boy. 
---
Didn't see any mention of that in the patch notes.   Bummer.
---
I'm frustrated too, and I want to be fair to BGS about it. Part of the challenge of the game IS the grind and survival aspects. Managing scrap, food, water and keeping it all within weight makes it more difficult but I don't mind.  It requires planning and a little strategy. It means that you can't just level up until you get the superlative weapon/armor combo and then range over the map like a god.
---
What I have a problem with is the ridiculously boring and affirmatively irritating content (like the DMV) as well as game mechanics that make the survival aspects nearly impossible to execute properly (like the low stash size). FONV got the balance almost perfect along with superb content and storytelling. They could have just re-released that game with multiplayer and I would have been thrilled. What they did release shows a real lack of intelligence.
---
Thank you for taking the time and reading through our posts and responding. Without the responses there would have been a much bigger outcry. 
---
The Dev process needs an overhaul. Before any patch or other release. There need to be Unit testing, System Integration testing and Regression testing. Some or all of this was skipped. It’s not ok to code a fix and put it out live without the three levels of testing. It shows blatant disregard for your clients
---
The modding community seems to be better at delivering content.  Which is sad.
---
I had the Known Plans mod from NexusMods and it worked BETTER than the one Bethesda put in.
---
I don't think they should abandon the development to the modders, but FFS go PAY some of them for their work and incorporate it into the game if it's good!
---
Ark did it, and people loved them for it!
---
&gt; It’s like they don’t even consider these things.
---
It's like they don't even play the game
---
Sorry.. I should really read through posts before I complain. 
---
Wow. Sorry i didnt read this after 50%
---
Ok
---
*herd mentality 
---
Yep, they need to do SMALL balance changes to everything.  Not huge whopping NERFS and BUFFS.
---
League of Legends gets balance right.  I might have a character that gets slightly nerfed or slightly buffed, but I never have a character that I'm like "FML teemo is unusable now".
---
And if they're going to do a balance patch, balance ALL the builds, not just nuke one into the dirt.
---
I'll probably get downvoted, but I was one of the people telling you all to abandon ship on this game back when it was in beta. And I'm not here to tell you I told you so. 
---
I love (or rather, loved) Bethesda games too, but it was clear from the start that this game was a cash grab and had very little passion behind it. I'm sure Battlecry's devs put a lot of hard work into it, but their bosses at the home office of BGS Maryland didn't give a shit and still don't. Obviously they never gave Battlecry/BGS Austin the support they needed to make the best game they could. Rewarding the management at Bethesda for their bad behavior just incentivizes it and creates a vicious cycle of progressively shallower and more cynical game releases. It *will* carry over to BGS Maryland in the future, if we let it.
---
Hopefully all of you who got burned by this game or by the constant stream of bad decisions surrounding it will learn from this and refuse to preorder Starfield or TESVI. Make them earn your trust back. Don't be swayed by the promise of a shiny new IP or your nostalgia for an old favorite. Your love for Fallout and customer loyalty to Bethesda is what got you in this mess in the first place. Bethesda has no loyalty to you, just an expectation that you will blindly hand over your money for whatever they put out next, regardless of quality.
---
Don't let them get away with a series of blunders like this again, or Fallout 76 will become the "gold standard" for Bethesda's future titles.
---
Here is an idea:  instead of balancing energy weapons by simply increasing  their damage, rebalance armor around damage types.
---
Armor should be really good at resisting ballistic OR energy damage, or kinda OK but not really great at resisting both.  It would probably help pvp balance issues and legendary weapons as well.  Imagine being level 65 and Leather Armor still being really useful in some situations.  
---
Combat would be the kinda okay for both option.  Marine would be better than Combat for both, but metal would always outdo it ballistically and leather  would outdo it for energy.  Robot, Raider, and Trapper would be slightly better towards one or the other but still easily outdone by either Metal or Leather in their respective categories. 
---
Energy weapons should have slightly better durability than comparable ballistic weapons, but require more and rarer junk to repair.
---
You \*CAN\* get past the laser grid.  Just have to have your Veil of Mystery on.  Or with you, perhaps, but I always where mine.  "Who was that masked man?"  "I dunno, but he shore looked purty in that dress."
---
What u playing next?
---
Aww, I came to say this
---
She's easier to kill with 3 people than 13. Bye tho. 
---
From the sounds of it they are probably low on QA resources or have outsourced it to to a contract company that is still learning the product and tools. My hope would be that they have sufficient automated testing tools or at least a decent testing kit of some type. However, it sounds like they are still in need of certain tools to properly manage the game data/player data 
---
No more pre-orders.  Hard stop.  It's not just Bethesda.  It's everyone. 
---
Who says you have to take the high road when dealing with a smarmy prick?
---
Just old and slow to make changes, and a bit stubborn.
---
I completely get that. Actions speak louder than words, and until these actions are implemented the words come off hollow. I truly wish there was more that I could say to this to ease those frustrations and pains. 
---
Well according to them they are reviewing it. I'm sure they dont want to bomb this like battlefront 2. So until the actual game and prices are released I'll hold my hopes high. So far their official statement is this is not the set in stone price. But everyone wants to kill it cause they've been burned by EA. I get it.
---
I'm not sure them bringing back all the bugs from before last patch and adding 2 or 3 new game breaking ones falls in line with that theory though. 
---
In compensation for wasting his time with this very well-thought post.
---
Fallout 76 is a SURVIVAL game.
---
I agree there should be a happy medium but you don't need to be disingenuous to get your point across. 
---
So what are we supposed to do? Shut our mouths unless we're dutifully thanking Papa Bethesda for shoving another bowl of shit our way?
---
I know you're not even gonna reply constructively to my comment, it'll just be another undeservedly smug, uneducated, "oh boi here comes another babby whining about his toy" shit post, if any at all, but I'd genuinely love to read what you sincerely believe should be the process of airing a grievance for a product which you paid money for that woefully underperforms and constantly "shits the bed" on almost every given occasion. 
---
I take ordnance Express. It's also a must
---
 Havent played it so idk.
---
When I was doing that quest line I would just pick up 1 and turn it in.
---
Lots of conflicting stories about picking up MORE than that helping.
---
Best bet is just to pick up 1 and turn it in.  Server hop and pick up another 1.
---
Jesus, what kind of abusive relationships have you been in to find this behaviour acceptable.
---
Tickets go unanswered and unfixed, people want to convey how upset they are, this is where they have to come to be heard it seems, so here we are..... adios.
---
The further east you go on the map the higher level the spawns. That is also where higher level players are more likely to be.
---
Yes, the crafting bag makes a HUGE difference. With premium you get access to all dlc, not including expansions if I remember correctly. 
---
However, premium gives you 1500 crowns a month. Well worth it if you’re going to play for any length of time. 
---
Which in turn allows you to buy the expansions :-)
---
He meant weapon artisan 
---
Same here.  When Bethesda said they were taking a risk with F76, I thought they meant in overall game play approach, not in the fact that they were releasing an unpolished, incomplete MMO experience. :(
---
Ghoul kid never leaves his fridge!
---
Sometimes it's about time.  Nerfing is one of those things you do a little on the severe side initially, then slowly restore the item over time until you find the balance. I wouldn't expect TS and E to remain just a 25% bonus nor do I think that White Knight will remain lowered unless they make a big change to durability.  This is why it's of no real concern to me.  
---
Balance is not a one-off.  
---
Good feedback is important here.  Real stats and play time will reveal the more subtle changes that need to be made.
---
Check the Anthem forum - enemies are disappearing and a lot of the same problems. The Destiny 2 release was a mess with barely any new content. Monster Hunter was unplayable on PC for the first month.
---
You just don't understand modern programming and you have no interest in learning how little you know. You're a bit too toxic for any artist.
---
https://kotaku.com/game-designer-says-developers-would-be-more-candid-if-g-1818729507
---
Yep, the patch broke bulk being able to be used for crafting.
---
They're rushing so hard to squash small bugs nobody cares about, that it's bringing more bugs into the game.
---
It's new with this "patch" if you can call it that.
---
My charisma is 3. Sob.
---
I've seen all the arguments, I appreciate your comment but I've read paragraphs similar to this one so many times. I'm simply on the other side of the fence, I don't agree whatsoever. 
---
If I'm able to turn on the game and become immersed in the worlds Bethesda create then I'm fine, no one can deny that they don't create some of the best game worlds. I've been able to turn on 76 and play it any time I've wanted to, it works more than you lead on. 
---
Creation Engine has been updated so many times just as other engines do, do you want to force them to use a new engine like ME Andromeda? A new engine will only create new problems. 
---
76 can only get better with time, ESO was similar and had a rough launch. Now that game is thriving. 
---
Bethesda are some of the worst developers I have ever seen in all my years of gaming. I love them to death because they are good story-tellers and writers but gameplay and smoothness is not exactly their Forte.
---
I mean Morrowind is an excellent example, it plays like shit, looks ugly and is one of the buggiest games I have ever played but based solely on Role Playing merits and attention to detail it was fantastic, probably one of the best games ever made.
---
What surprises me is how unready this community was for this in FO76. I always imagined most of us were Bethesda Vets and knew how horrible this was about to be, I guess I was wrong, you guys are only skimming the surface on how poorly coded these games are.
---
Go try Modding Skyrim for a year like I did and tell me how confident you are in Bethesda’s coders. Shit is a joke and they know it full well.
---
All percentage based bobbles stacked, just not +1  S.P.E.C.I.A.L. ones.  They lazily only fixed explosive.
---
Nerfing is a necessary balance tool and none of you know what you're talking about. 
---
I have 5.25” Floppy Wasteland sitting on my bookshelf....
---
i sold two friends on it and both were long gone by mid-december. i bought a copy for a third friend as a cheer-up gift, knowing he loved fallout as much as i do and couldn't afford it having just lost his job. dude put in over 700 hours into fallout 4, but he played 76 for all of 10 and hasn't touched it since. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You have to unbulk your junk to use it now.
---
is your skin made out of a thin layer of cotton candy and nothing else? because this is the most positive Fo76 community there is.
---
this game is in an awful state. no, laughable considering the last patch. everyone has either given up on it or just reporting on what a joke Bethesda is.
---
except this sub. if anything I'd say the reaction wasn't overblown enough. I'd be demanding heads to roll.
---
Remember the Fallout franchise has never been their passion or even their brainchild, the Elder Scrolls series will always be Bethesda’s main focus and passion project. I’m assuming Starfield also will be considering it’s a new IP made completely by the original studio in Maryland.
---
The person who posted this was banned from the subreddit, so I doubt it.
---
Maybe so, but the code is given to you when you create the switch, you don't create it yourself. 
---
Please buy a fork before death
---
I've got hunting rifles &amp; combat rifle that absolutely wreck, if you get the right perks they can be powerful
---
I do have a boomstick
---
Lol getting downvoted by butthurting duped tse noobs who can't play this game without OP shit.
---
Cool thanks
---
This was 2 months ago and clearly I said I was checking. 
---
Not gonna work. Basically you are suggesting turning water purifiers into cap machines. Because of the cap limit, people actually went and traded stuff. And players actually had somekind of point to logging in each day and clear out the vendors from caps. Basically removing the limit is chopping off part of playerbase. 
---
What is next? lets add legendary shop that sells legendary weapons. Boom another piece of playerbase gets chopped off. Why do we even like have caps, why not just remove it from game and give items out for free. Point is that everytime you dumb the game down and making it easier, you are making easier players to leave. 
---
Which is what I said. 
---
Yeah I’d work on that one. It’s about the only DR reduction heavy weapons get, and especially SM have a lot of armor. Requires PA, but... that’s the HW life
---
Thank you. I've been in your position before. It's probably more frustrating from where you sit than where we do.
---
I agree with this. Heavy weapons should be able to dish out a lot of damage, but have drawbacks like accuracy and ammo consumption.
---
Actually I believe their plan is to now only have it drop from the scorch best queen. 
---
It's new as of yesterday's patch.  Pretty annoying, isn't it?  You will need to scrap previously bulked items to use them again.
---
I'm not sure there's any official word on if this is a bug or not, likely one that came with preventing mods from being auto-scrapped.
---
No its not retconning is good because it gives us more info on the lore did this game add to the lore of the brotherhood yes it makes sense that years after the bombs dropped their would still be some satellite coverage would they use that to get in contact with people yes so once again i don't see a problem with it
---
I’d even call it a keystone HW perk
---
Still no idea what the fuck point you’re trying to make 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I was on it for several hrs yesterday and there wasn't too many people at Whitesprings nor did any nukes get dropped. But people were busy at the train stations. Because they can buy other plans and mods now. Went to Whitesprings and there were 2 players waiting for another to finish with the vendor bot. 
---
3770k,970,16gb,ssd,1080p,Win10x64. Worked fine before patch. I don't push its graphics. Not sure what I can do, maybe Ill need to live with it in hopes it will resolve itself with another patch. Any advice is welcome
---
bye felicia
---
I read reddit post with people pushing for the perk nerf too.
---
Bethesda should sure be looking at the shitfest and saying "right we need the best people to fix this, Todd call the A-Team" lol. 
---
Im a fan and just like yourself imagined a fallout that was truely grand...
---
Not all fans should be ignored when it comes to ideas for games, and i think before 76 (Maybe ? ) they were listening too much to the fans who were against the MMO concept ?, thing is there was also some fans who wanted the grand MMO (and still do) ,, And instead the devs should have gone and made a new MMO to suit all Fallout fans ,,, USA would have 52 states and that wouldn't all be PvP states, warzones? and they would have had Quiet SP questing for the lone wanderer aswell as populated areas for me to stand in looking good selling my wares... While listening to Karl Pilkington and Jangles the Monkey doing Wasteland fables and monkey news on a comedy fallout radio station.  
---
Maybe in 20 years we will get that fallout ...  :/ 
---
You’re right, they should have removed the combo. My one star guns now suck because of the OP tse. You seem to both acknowledge and ignore that point in this post, which baffles me. I have an explosive revolver that I found myself, and used because it fit my build (vats pistol), I did not make an explosive build. My guns now do about the same as any two handed melee, without any melee perks. Do you not see an issue with this? 
---
I understand that the bitching has reached an all time high, and some people are bitching because their 1500 damage guns don’t do 1500 damage anymore. I think that’s just stupid, but you have to consider the middle ground that was affected here as well. My pistol did 286... nothing compared to a TSE. Still got nerfed to 150.
---
Thanks for listening.
---
I disagree. I dont consider this a MMO since Battlefield has more players per map.  This game is like a different version of 7 Days To Die.  That's why I play it. 7daysToDie is my Favorite ps4 game. And this game reminds me a bit of it without going too ultra realistic on the difficulty side like The Forst does. Hate that. This game needs improvement though.  Not saying it doesn't. But it's still good and fun.
---
Ill test it out officially tonight and record my results. I'll edit my post accordingly if what I said is incorrect.
---
You appear to be immune from upvotes.
---
People have been complaining about genuine problems. You point out a very specific and poor example, i.e. bobby pins. I truly believe in the old saying where there is smoke there is fire. So many people complaining about the same stuff is symptomatic of a much bigger problem :/. 
---
You can't qoute one word, out of a full paragraph and say that's the reason. I said 'the majority of people's builds are now inefficient', that's a result of the changes they have made. 
---
Constantly in Danger even though I have Chameleon, Evasive, Sneak, and I'm on top of a fucking house - what sees me?
---
Juicewho?
---
This game will be amazing in 2039.
---
I unsubbed from him.Won't be watching his videos from now on.
---
Very nicely written. We agree on mostly everything.
---
This happens once in a while. I have also looted legendary items off nonlegendary mobs, so I guess it balances out.
---
"Does not support" does not mean "not allowed" it means the creation kit for 76 isn't released, but you don't necessarily need it to create the mods we currently have for 76 as they're mostly .ini edits. However, certain mods (like the lock pick bar) will get you banned as they provide a direct advantage to the game.
---
Bethesda, we speak your name.
---
the patch before last literally broke the servers, people were getting d/c'ed at the highest rate since launch, yet for some reason the outcry this time is over the top.  I wonder why?
---
Same, I mean I'd still play if they gave us an option for a respec. I am currently all around useless. 
---
I used to roll with a TSE shotgun pre-nerf. Guess I’m not really minding it since shotgun perks are under strength, you can pretty much switch over to melee without moving any perks at all (from the pov of someone who has maxed shotgun and melee perks).
---
That being said, I’m wondering if the nerf would’ve been accepted in better terms had it come with a free special/perk respec, considering it’s not as easy to move cards for a completely different build and it’s not feasible to grind it anymore considering the whitespring xp nerf.
---
So what you're saying is that they intentionally removed that feature?
---
I'll definitely do that, mate. It's kinda ironic that these games are literally built as social experiences, meant to be played with friends but I always eschew that aspect of it. Cheers. 
---
Melee is now 2 to 3 time as powerful....with out bloodied
---
I personally think the game will be dead in about a month or two. Unless the can pull something off in that time. There is no end game, besides farming and maintaining your character/camp, and with how much you have to farm just to maintain is getting tedious.
---
LMAO right?
---
That's what you get for not making out Magic Find gear.  Nothing like having to wear a complete set of armor just to farm other sets of armor.
---
I doubt that guy plays the game....he just waits for patch notes to read off and monetise 
---
The shareholders are the company heads. Bethesda/Zenimax is a private company.
---
I work on a system where we process millions of dollars a day so my context is different.  I tend to forget that some times.
---
As long as you don't forget to feed and take him for walks
---
holy shit, this is the funniest/pettiest shit i've ever seen
---
Waiting for the melee guy to come in and accuse you of buying your weapons and tell you that you were using explosive and TS as a crutch.
---
Yeah.  Same here.  I've defended the heck out of this game, but this is getting me close to join the F FO76 cult.  It is a basic basic function, guys.  Bethesda needs test realms for patches.   I'm just so disappointed that Bethesda can't seem to even do basic MMO game functions with each patch.  How are these the same people that make ESO?
---
man.. after 30 hours in the first week i gave up on this game.. it was fun but boring alone.. i moved on.. shocked it took you so long
---
I actually found this equation for Fallout 4 which looks to be what you're using:
---
*DamageCoeff*=Min(0.99,\[*PaperDamageDamageResist*×*damage reduction*\]0.366×0.5)  
---
You do not calculate further than the number you get from this... you are adding an extra %25 to your calculations for no reason.
---
Not sure if you dug a little deeper to ol Randy but not only if it his company (So yeah, he is associated with production) but he was tied up in litigation because, according to internal sources, the money Sega handed over to Gearbox for Aliens: Colonial Marines was diverted by Randy himself to fund Borderlands 2. He put A:CM on the back burner and when Sega threatened a lawsuit he had Gearbox create a demo for E3 and outsourced the development to a small studio. When gaming journalist reported it he denied it until the class action lawsuit. So in fact he is the spokesman of the entire company unlike Todd Howard.
---
But this is besides the point. The point is Randy Pitchford is a scumbag and I'm loving my Quad Handmade ever since the patch...
---
It's tedious isn't it. It seems like it must be a bug, though likely associated with the fix of no longer being able to auto scrap expensive mods that take weeks of server hopping to find; one of the more heinous things of all the things that had/have been happening. This kind of happening with patches is seeming formulaic, the happening of adding problems when fixing problems. Though if for whatever reason it has to be one or the other (which surely it doesn't), I'll take the not auto scrapping option.
---
Thread of the day right here, friend.
---
I have a lot of issues with my rx580, lowering graphics is helps as well but not entirely. I don't know what to do with fps drops and freezes myself, I've posted here and on of.forum but never got response on this problem. Like it's only me who have this nonsense. 
---
The lols starts when game freezes and all I have to do to fix it is turn off and on my monitor...
---
Maybe. We tried that once. Brought it right back onshore.
---
No mans sky was always great from day 1 till now... People are just tripping.. It was a space sim unlike any other.. i dont get the hate.. I backed it from day 1 and 200+ hours.. i still play it some time.. It beats minecaft to me as longest game i can still keep playing and not be board AF...
---
It's Sonic the hedgehog mode, run around collecting coins (caps)....it's super fun :-)
---
This is the beta server.
---
Only happened 3 times in 6hrs, but stinks when your in the middle of something. To make it worse, the game takes priority or on the top or something, cause cant get to the desktop or switch window. Have to restart from the ctrl alt del screen. Boots up quick, but still
---
I had it happen to me a few days ago in a nuke zone. This guy nearly one shotted the sbq and then started going after other players. It wrecked like 4 pieces of my power armor that had been freshly repaired.
---
...because you're too literal, and proud of it?
---
Pretty sure it's a bug, unintended side effect of the (welcome) change to not automatically scrap mods when you're crafting. As opposed to those bugs which are present because Bethesda seems to have reverting to an older code branch.
---
Yes it appears that way.. it's all part of the illusion. 
---
Yeah, just read this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/al6sfo/the_last_f76_patch_is_a_disaster_bethesda_now/
---
it really is bad..
---
Nah, melee is next on the nerf List 
---
I've seen it before the patch, haven't seen it yet after but I'm sure it'll happen again.
---
I spent a lot of time grinding to get what I had. My dog would see me turn the PC on and give me a look of disgust and leave the room.
---
I think this is my cue to go spend more time with my best friend.
---
If you were on the Xbox we could do the Coplay thing online and I would do it for you brother.
---
Idk, if you dont want to do survival "chores" then maybe don't play a survival game?
---
This seems to happen occasionally, but inwas never complaining about it. Sometimes qhitesprings bugs out after a nuke zone clears out and it spawns a bunch of level 50 protectrons or level 1 eyesbots.
---
Considering where it was in BETA and release... this is good progress. I would say this is about where the game should have been when released.
---
If they merge what was fixed and now broken again they might be ready for new content.
---
Xbox One S
---
Numerous issues since patch 5 29JAN19
---
1.  If equipping weapons of the same type to the radial favorite wheel, only 1 will remain, others disappear.  For instance equipping a Troubleshooters smg to slot 3 and a Furious smg to slot 4 appears to work while the wheel is open, but when opening it back up to change weapons, one of those slots will now be empty.
---
2.  I have a mysterious 60 pounds of phantom weight in my inventory that I can’t seem to get rid of.
---
3.  Numerous phantom enemies when playing last night.  Ie:  I am taking damage, can hear the attack noises, hear the NPC talking, but can’t see it or target it.  They meleed me and ranged attacked.
---
4.   Bulk items can not be used in crafting anymore.  I have 50 bulk gears but for crafting or repairs it says I have 0.
---
5.  Even with 5 stars in gunsmith, weapons seem to be degrading 2-3 times as quick as before.  Honestly it acts like I have no points in gunsmith in regard to durability.
---
6.  Tank killer seems to no longer be effecting my smg.  Notice no increase in damage or armor piercing when fighting enemies with or without it.
---
7.  Bobby pins are back to weighing .1
---
8.  Hunger seems increased.  My hunger bar goes from full to empty within a 10 minute span.
---
9.  My DR rating dropped from 387 to 287.  No armor broken, and using barbarian, evasive, and iron clad.
---
Disagree. TSE was always BS in pve. The problem is that some enemies have too high of an armour rating.
---
Well.. I hope they hotfix some of these bugs soon.
---
I deleted my characters and haven't touched the game in over a month. Maybe if they fix it enough I'll try it again but the updates seem to be running the wrong way. 
---
My friends didn't buy FO76, I did to try and tell them how it was. I can't recommend it atm. 
---
Pacifist is just the term they chose for those who opt out of PVP.   It should remove all PVP damage from players and their CAMPS.
---
Idiot opens up on a CAMP but does ZERO damage.   This will send the message that they’re wasting their time and that they should go elsewhere.   
---
If all they’re doing it for is to grief well,  that’s not a play style,  it’s a psychological issue.
---
My favorite thing from him was: Fallout Miami is adding post apocalypse Miami into Fallout
---
No, the opposite needs to happen. They need to take lots of time for QA, Feedback assessment, and content. They need one big silver bullet patch.
---
They need to maintain communication, and promise a big patch coming which they need to work months on.
---
FAST is not the answer right now.
---
Sure it is, complaints are complaints if they're suddenly warranted like the new ones are or the bulk old ones. With the attitudes about the game over the past 3 months could you not see the devs seeing the huge fuck up of clicking "skip" instead of "merge" in the single final build and then saying, "Well, they were going to bitch about something anyway, at least they have a good reason this time. Lunch?"
---
^
---
But when you have half a dozen lvl 60 ghouls swarming you it is a different story. Perks and game play play huge roles in surviving. I think people just need to tweak their play style.  I switched from rifleman perks to commando and my guns are doing great, I just go through ammo a bit quicker now.
---
And you truly believe it’s good that a 85 round clip is required on each enemy when they already travel in hordes?
---
Grindfest 2019....enjoy 
---
Keep in mind, there is more than one Bethesda Game Studios. The one that made the Elder Scrolls games and Fallout 3&amp;4 is the Maryland studio. The Austin studio made Fallout 76. I won't be buying anything from that studio until they prove themselves.
---
the game really needs a counter to str boost not melee weapons 
---
melee - perks +60% +15% bloody mess +80% 15 str mod - so melee weapons so a 100 point dmg weapon does 255 points of damage 
---
range - +60% +15% - so 100 becomes 175 dmg
---
which seeing a lot of enemies are significantly better at ranged weapons because of armor / weapon damage drop off that is around half damage on top of that 
---
what we need is at 15 points- dex gives +40% dmg rifles / int gives +40% to energy weapons / str +40% to heavy weapons / agility +40% to pistols as well as a better range of around 30% to give us a bit less drop off damage issues 
---
this would boost all weapons damage across the board but keep melee a bit ahead since they do have to run toward the enemies giving us comparable damage as well as expanding the players choices of weapons 
---
Just feels like a very drastic change to go from something like a +100% damage, all the way to a +20%; why not hitting in the middle and going with a +50% damage for things like the TSE. 
---
&gt;If I do play this game again in the future it will be to exploit it and to show others how to exploit it.
---
You're the exact kind of person this game doesn't need. Go away and good riddance.
---
Make sure you're not severely over-encumbered (like 1000+ pounds).  They added a hard cap on player weight now.  If you exceed it, your character can't move, trade, basically do anything until you drop below the hard cap.
---
lol, what. I need to try that
---
Yes, all you have to do is scroll through this Reddit and see, there are a lot of very upset people. Understandably so. I defended this game so so much, but even I'm extremely frustrated by the newest "patch". :/
---
What I don't get is they do this quite often in ESO and ALWAYS just refund the skill points so that you can respec as you please. This is nice because if you picked two complementary perks and one is altered, you can decide whether or not to keep its partnered perk.
---
Hopping was nerfed awhile ago.
---
Go play the game
---
Ohhh I did not read that.. is that new?
---
Yes I also tried changing from scope to not. Didn’t help. Happens a lot more with my gauss that I won’t be using anymore 
---
Some games I play like Elite: Dangerous and Payday 2 (which uses Steam Beta) called it a beta. Generally it's competitive games such as Overwatch, Rainbow Six, Battlefield, etc. that seem to call it a "Public Test Server". But I think it's really just semantics. 
---
Ok. I'm on PC. Tested it on Poseidon right after the patch dropped.
---
Not only does the Atom shop work flawlessly but notice how when you first start up the game and you see the menu pop up, you go to click on social and it turns into 'atom shop' under your mouse, and you end up in there despite not having wanted to go there. I hate sneaky shit like that
---
Any gun with vats is potent.
---
Thanks for the reply, like I said above. I hope they hotfix some of these bugs soon! It's really bad.
---
A bloody handmade with vats build is your best bet, things die fast.
---
“The team is aware of this issue” fuck off community managers. Lone went from being honest about their games on YouTube talking about good and bad what sucks and what doesn’t to this is the best game in existence. He must not want to lose his dream job but cmon they’re fucking sellouts. 
---
If you were talking about Grafton station, it's not there.
---
Are you shooting targets in the head? My 2se handmade is fine.
---
Also alt+tab might help when you some to altab to
---
Very well said.
---
5. How about a little new content? I mean, you wouldnt program in 3 closed vault doors if there wasnt at least a PLAN to open them at some point? Right? RIGHT?
---
Other weapon classes need to drop the weight reduction and get more fitting weights.
---
The unyielding legendary modifier gives +3 to all stats except endurance when at low health. You can wear a full set to maximize that bonus.
---
Yea, it came back cause this is an older version of the game
---
Is there anything worth grinding for that won't eventually get nerfed?
---
Its a shady practice.  There trying to temp us to buy in the atom store with perks.  
---
If nothing is said, im sure slowing they will keep adding “special perks” for buying from atom shop and eventually we end up with P2W.  
---
&gt;ESO wasn’t made with the Creation Engine at all, this was the first time that Bethesda ever attempted to add online to its engines tools, so really they didn’t have anyone to call on.
---
The Creation engine is the re-branded Gamebryo Engine which is the re-branded NetImmerse engine from 1997.
---
Dark Age of Camelot was a pretty successful (some say the best ;)) MMORPG in 2001 using the NetImmerse Engine.
---
They could have just called the ex-Mythic guys over at Broadsword to get some help.
---
It’s the only thing that is reasonable at this point. It’s like they are forcing a PA/Melee game mechanic. If they nerf melee, anyone who is left after yesterday’s disaster will leave 
---
Melee is perfect as is. 
---
You guys gotta consider PvP. Im melee pvp. 
---
I have no gap closer. I need to get close.  That means im charging people like an idiot. I need to 1 shot players or i dont have a shot. 
---
Im happy it takes 4 shots to kill me now.  That is a fine balance. Im doing much better since the patch. And im not OP. I DIE PLENTY. 
---
You have trouble shooting me 4 times while i charge 80 game feet at you?
---
How so?  I played back in BC and did end game there.  Right now I resubbed and rerolled a priest and am still leveling.  I am excited for War Fronts though.
---
Idk. I had a heave weapons build but i changed it to shotgun now. My TSE gatling gun isnt rly powerful anymore.  I went to whitesprings and i felt that Ghoul were laughing with the gun.. Upon  its durability is poor,  the  TSE shotgun does 2 to 3 shot kills to supermutant warlords, 1 to 2 shots a charred ghouls  and i dont have to repair it often. 
---
So conclusion: heavy guns and explosive weapons like missiles launchers and fatmans, are  weaker.  And they rape your inventory with their weight, their ammo aswell. 
---
No... that means they dont actually care, meaning the community is right to abandoned them, if that's true then they dont deserve the loyal fanbase from fo3, fo4, oblivion, and skyrim.
---
This isn’t the most positive community. There is another one but we ain’t telling you lot about it as you’ll just ruin it.
---
no way i had no idea 
---
lol, " shove microtransactions down people's throats", how? Theres a shop, you can ignore it completely... How is it shoved down your throat? I have never even thought about spending money on the shop, I use the free Atoms for stuff, but the shop is not even in my way or in my mind when I play the game...  Seriously, the game has issues(ALOT), but you people are ridiculous with your complaining. 
---
That's only one part  
---
What about trashing the effects of a weapon I worked hard to barter my way into?  It's just a TS gauss, not even a TSE.      
---
What about the fact that even with the "slap" pvp system a maxed out melee build can one-shot me when I never PVP?  That same melee build can be doing 2000-4000 damage compared to my piddly 800 per shot of TS gauss?  But now my TS gauss is only going to do \~500 per shot?!  Melee stays fine with ridonkulous damage but the primary weapon for my build just got nerfed into oblivion?!  
---
What about people that had a fully developed end-game build but now their builds are useless thanks to being nerfed?  Bethesda could offer a one-time free total respec (AND SHOULD!) with such huge changes to balance, but the response instead seems to be "Suck it up, go grind some more"  
---
You guys are blindly thrashing and flailing making changes while apparently never considering the full ramifications.  Quit being knee-jerk reactionary, stop, think, and make a coherent plan instead.  It's better to wait for a proper fix than to keep pissing people off
---
They're not this monster of a studio people make them out to be. So the game is buggy and for a while dupers we're screwing the game up. As of yesterday it's been patched. F;NV was buggy as hell when it launched need they forget. If anything like most MMOs it's best not to dive in right after launch. Be patient and wait till they sort things out.
---
What, it made it so I actually have to repair more as opposed to before where it was like once a week? 
---
I logged our and back in and i could move again but i quit because my regular none legendary combat rifle that should do something does no damage at all and i just quit
---
Yeah there's nothing wrong with bulk attacks, if that's what you prefer. I prefer loose stacks. Since not everything is bulkable, and even if it is, 10 bulk might be 100, or 150, or 300, it feels more uniform to me to just have stacks of 100 it whatever. Whenever my stash gets up close to 600, I bulk everything down till I have either 100 or 150 (for things I have tagged) loose, then do a vendor tour and sell the bulks (or excess of nonbulkable stuff). Easy peasy, no having to farm for plastic.
---
Enemies need more damage across the board. Perhaps high level ghouls could deal additional poison damage. Additionally, other enemies could deal bleed damage with their attacks, so you can’t mitigate all of the damage with regular armor.
---
I mean, even Fallout 1 and 2 were pretty buggy (maybe not on the levels of the recent ones, but they weren't all that perfect)
---
But yeah, Bethesda should actually fucking try to make good games instead of rushing out broken games after broken games on their engine they're so "comfortable" with, that they still can't get rid of bugs that have existed since Morrowind
---
I'm waiting for private servers.
---
Take your own advice. If you don't like the sub leave it. Why post your dislike? Just leave.  
---
They just nerfed that with the caps stashes. That was actually fun. Finding all the caps stashes and doing the rounds. Fun and rewarding. So you can pvp and not care about losing caps, or buy plans, or whatever. Now they want you to log in to sell an arbitrary 200 caps worth to 7 vendors every day, like it's some kind of job. That is a fixed style of play which to me is totally opposite of freedom to play how you want in an open world game.
---
I'm pretty sure Apple is already doing the experiment with iPhones. It's going much better for them.
---
It's fair to say D2 added 1 single new enemy - dogs? 76 added massive content compared to that and open worlds where we can role play and free roam.
---
D2 had single shot OP weapon problems - some sort of laser gun.
---
The graphics were a downgrade everywhere but most noticeably on your ships.
---
I used to go to the forums to laugh at how bad it was and how stupid they were for pre-ordering what was trash compared to Warframe. It was littered with "I quit this give me a refund" posts.
---
Meanwhile Fo3 had that broken walking animation so i couldn't stand 3rd person view; this is entirely the quality i expect from Beth. It's low but it's a complex play field that lets use role play lots - none of their new gaffs really change that.
---
Except....the old dupe method is back? That is objectively crappy. The rest is exactly what you can expect from Anthem and all.
---
Great, thank you. Though not sure why me asking you was downvoted haha
---
Halloween candy can't be mass deposited/withdrawn from the stash. Awesome when there's 1500 to move around.
---
Does anyone have a copy of the original post?
---
The game is still in Alpha. Real Beta comes out next year.
---
Alright thanks 
---
I'm fine on ps4.
---
Do you have mods? They need to be updated
---
When is the issue about getting trapped in crafting stations going to be fixed it seems a little better but still happens especially at my camp running Xbox one x only solution is to shut the game down completely and restart happens on my wife's account too as well as other people so I know I'm not the only one experiencing this?
---
&gt;You for fucking real son?
---
Well are you? Weight of bobby pins is just a number. It's not a bug.
---
If collector rate is 0.8 in hour, then that would be a bug, because it was prior declared as one.
---
&gt;You cannot craft or repair unless you unbulk junk.
---
That's a feature that can be called a bug too, depending how they intended it. 
---
However I don't remember seeing it prior to this patch? Are you serious about it being an old bug?
---
That's how mafia works
---
Xbox here, normal rate.
---
What’s WITH the random caps?
---
Pretty soon this game will be single player.
---
You didn’t see it? Well I mean if you didn’t see it you didn’t see it. Can’t fault you for that
---
I get these a lot at the ammo factory, as well as grafton steel. 
---
I feel like your use of the word exploited makes it sound worse than what was actually going on. There was a clear best build, designed by Bethesda, and people specced their character for it. It's not exploiting in the same way that bugs are exploited, people were just doing what was the most viable build. Now that build has had a massive nerf; -40% on explosive and like -75% on TS unless I'm mis-remembering. That's huge. 
---
I think it's on Bethesda to decide what is big enough to warrant allowing respecs. A lot of other developers do that and do it well. 
---
The optimistic build.
---
This place is my comedic relief.
---
I read about stuff here then go in-game and experience it.
---
Its never the same....ever.
---
Bold face liars being parroted ad naseum.  
---
Even the Bobby pin weight is imaginary. If ppl actually tested anything they'd notice their weight can go over their max and they can still fast travel.....
---
Oh dear, poor snowflake.
---
No no, only the radium has the low learn rate, the others are a walk in the park in comparison. If you're on ps4 I can help for sure :) 
---
How is this an excuse or even an explanation? Awww someone said something mean so now paying customers have to play "guess my nerf?" What is the logic here? 
---
Or it could mean they're so hardened to the whiny culture of the internet that when something actually goes wrong they just sigh and wonder how much of their day it's going to take up. 
---
That's also how you start dealing with IRL kids after the third one or so, which seems like a half fitting analogy.
---
Welcome to the good side! BGS deserves no excuses for this shit. 
---
Spoken like a true synth
---
Since assume makes an ass out u and me. Unlike you , I have responsibilities and a life so I haven't been able to dedicate thousands of hours to a video game, but I have been able to dedicate a few and during those few I have encountered many glitches and bugs with the continual random disconnects being one of the worst. 
---
Believe me, i know how it is, i went to it at lv 20. What i did was a placed my camp behind the building as close to it as possible, then built a foundation with the stairs with a platform at the top. I placed the stairs thing down the hill so u had go jump to get on it so gouls dont climb up it. Then i placed turrets on the platform. The gouls will rush out of the back doors and they will get killed by the turrets. But you will need to place bait for the gouls to attack. I did metal tables because they were cheap to repair. Keep in mind you will have to get a hit on them to get xp, so use a gun with expendable ammo and molotovs or grenades.
---
PUBG has one, For Honor, Dota. Plenty of games. I would love this. Also would be interesting if we could have our own personal world/server. I don't wanna have to fight other people for loot... it's all whack anyways. Everyone can one shot anything anyways, no point of looting with other people. 
---
He began with making hate videos to become relevant, then made praise to remain relevant. He doesn’t like or hate the game all he gives a fuck about is getting people like us to click on them and watch them. His tone don’t change cause the only tone he has had since the beginning is $$$.
---
I had this before update haha
---
Here Here! Lol
---
This is my biggest complaint as well - it’s hard to call it a “micro-transaction” when I’m paying close to $10 for one item. On top of that, you also have to compare the costs of those items with the cost of the overall game. I’ve seen some stores around me selling it brand new for about $30 - which makes the prices in the atom store even more ridiculous
---
That’s what you get for buying your weapons. You were just using TS and explosive as a crutch.
---
Same. I tried but recently it's started to become a chore. I find myself thinking 'guess I should play it's rather than 'can't wait to get home and play!' 
---
Hey man.  If you live near me, I'll help you beat that quest.  I'm in Nebraska.

I was ok with the tse nerf. But the fact that the repair system is broken pissed me off
---
Build all this as close to the building as possible
---
Respec would need to include breaking all leveled up cards. No way I would keep a 5 point demolition expert now. My TSE 10mm went from 213 damage to 69. Turn off 5*DE, and it becomes 63 damage. 
---
All I see is a bunch of opposing support from fanboys preaching Blind Faith
---
Please let me know if you find a game that scratches your itch, I play ps4 most but I do have a beast of a pc I use for other things and I might just join you! 
---
Or ten minutes
---
Or thirty seconds 
---
Or LOGGING IN
---
Hope you’re sitting down for this one...
---
1. The uranium extractor at Poseidon power plant will not place correctly and is unable to be used.
---
2. You should slowly start replacing the holotape treasure hunts, I mean “quests” with actual NPCs. Probably heard this 1000000 times but having dialogue come from an NPC is much more engaging not to mention the dialogue could easily be swapped since it seems like many should be coming from an NPC instead of a holotape anyways.
---
3. There’s a bug in VATS when multiple enemy’s/players are nearby using VATS causes hud to flash on and off for a few minutes making VATS unusable.
---
4. There needs to be an ability to either name your power armor chassis or have a tag next to it of the first piece in the list. Ex: “Power Armor Chassis (T-60)”similar to the new (Known) tag for plans.
---
5. As much as a player vending machine would be nice id like to see an Auction house or Auctioneer bot. Where you can place items for auction either on the server or create a server group for the auctions. In addition to this idea being able to load into certain servers or server groups would be helpful instead of when playing with friends if someone disconnects or the server is full we can say “Hey lets join NA Server 21” or “We’re all doing Scorched Queen in Server 34 in 30 minutes since it’s empty” instead of “Let’s wait for Billy to load in then we can all join after and hope it’s not full or crashes”
---
6. This may be farther down the line but I’d like to see more Raids like the Scorched Beast queen. Perhaps even make a plaza or area where groups of players can enter an instanced area for the raid so it’s not so bogging on the server. This includes the current Queen event where it gets so incredibly laggy fighting her as is it might be a good idea to have her in an instanced group as well!

Best Regards! Xbox One, vid3ogameaddict
---
Bummer. To each their own.
---
I have heard a reinstall helps, or rebuilding your database on ps4.
---
You mean... I’m NOT gonna get free stuff?!
---
I am the same exact way. I don’t see all the fuss about these little aspects of the game that all the sudden seem so ground breaking. After all these updates I’ve honestly seen no change in my gameplay except for added features. I don’t know if I’m just some incompetent gamer or if it really doesn’t matter as much  as people make it out to be
---
(Honestly I think over exaggeration is what is making this game and its community so toxic but that’s another topic)
---
Can I just say... fuck molerats.
---
Does not support means dont use any mods. That's like trying to use a flathead screwdriver on a nut. I know some people want to get an early start on it, but they said they'd are looking at mod support down the line, and probably dont want their future updates to ruin a years worth of work on current mods.
---
sad truth
---
I had 730 for a while yesterday. It's back to normal now.
---
It is a mystery.
---
&gt; holy shit, this is the funniest/pettiest shit i've ever seen
---
So what's funny/petty?  The fact that he has a disability?  The fact that his disability prevents him from completing some aspects of the game?  
---
I'm really confused.  As it stands, you are just coming across as a massive asshole.  
---
I'm not the one gloating because I know of a "secret" safe space.
---
Online or offline their games are still as buggy.
---
Whole your spending lots of time trying to survive......make sure to stop into the Atom Shop and spend some money.
---
After watching my friend one tap a mirelurk Queen with his deathclaw gauntlet, I can’t help but say melee OP. Also, the fact that any two handed melee weapon does about the same as my explosive revolver (which I’ve perked into), with 5 strength and 0 melee cards.... that’s bad. 
---
Also happens to me every time I reload into the world (initial enter, fast travel, load into instanced location etc.). Pretty annoying, but I've now built the muscle memory to put the pieces back on each time 🤣
---
"See? Fallout shouldn't be multiplayer" Their whole plan
---
I se your point. With some many people already using TSE it would create even more of an issue to just remove one or the other. I do hope they throw out some hotfixes soon to address the balance after this hit. I do still think that they could have removed E from TSE. there are already explosive weapons in game. if you want TSE get a TS rocket launcher or grenade launcher. Either way I do understand your point and agree that they could just be doing the initial knee jerk to stop a game breaking mechanic and will fine tune it later when they have more time.
---
Hopping wasnt nerfed a while ago. For items to sell to vendors i go get 30 straight jackets and sell them for 47 a pop
---
That's if you can even get a ticket submitted, mine get stuck in spinning limbo.
---
I couldn’t agree more. It was a very sad moment for me when I turned off my PS4, knowing I won’t come back anytime soon. I was – against all common sense – looking forward to the update. But after playing for 2-3 hours, I was just devastated... I just don’t get it to be honest. What’s going on at Bethesda, how the hell can you make bad decision after bad decision after bad decision and also have the nerves to tell you audience that you’re listening to them, when in fact you give them a söap in the face over and over again... I‘ll be back in March, in case the problems get fixed till then (doubt it...). I loved playing the game but I‘m done for the moment, as sad it is for me personally.
---
I like Borderlands but that game can't hold a candle to Fallout sir. Let's be realistic. Despite the bugs they're still legendary games. Now you know you're doing something right if despite the game being buggy people still flock to play it. Don't kid yourself. You'll but the next Skyrim and Fallout despite your bickering.
---
I had to do this section for my wife as well. This game isn't a platformer, why we are doing timed platformed exercises? Oh because there's no content. NVM 
---
I finally got some sentinel and it honestly gives me a fighting chance.
---
yeah, always have something, doesnt work for me when freeze, i do when I exit
---
Agreed, I used to rely quite heavily on 2 handed melee too until my swing speed super sledge magically disappeared from my inventory (not the first time a weapon has done this.)  
---
I also find it particularly annoying that one of the only reliably predictable enemy AI behaviors is that they'll run away from a grenade.
---
The strongest legendary effect in the game is now useless compared to non legendary lever action, they still reduced 80% of the damage that I find excessive. If you want to compare the same rifle it gives 100 dps more than a regular lever action.. not very much of a difference. It used to do 980DPS ( way too much) now 270.  (Way too low) they went from one extreme to another. No middle ground.  
---
Rifle builds have no special that affects weapon damage like melee builds do. So the most powerful weapon is now your melee. 
---
Heavy weapons also useless, basically melee build or nothing. 
---
So you also didn’t notice that levels past 50 in FO76 don’t linearly increase your character’s power ?
---
Bloodied builds are broken too, I’ll give you that.
---
In fact all those “stacking through the roof” build/exploits are broken and must be globally nerfed. 
---
You should be thanking me, I’m saving you from being nauseous.
---
I've been playing this game since the beta and I still haven't beaten the main story. It's great. It keeps me busy and I enjoy logging in everyday to collect resources and explore with my friends. Still haven't been everywhere on the map even. It's a Fallout game at it's core once you look past the terrible release and game breaking bugs. I love the Fallout world. I even bought the power armor edition and nuka cola dark. While Bethesda has upset me, it has only been a few months and software development takes a while. I still have faith in this company. Plus I'm amazed at the tech aspect of them taking the Fallout 4 engine and forcing it to be multiplayer. They had to change things to make that work obviously, but in my view this game is basically Fallout with friends which is what I've wanted since Fallout 3. I'll keep exploring Appalachia and hope you guys come back sometime. :) 
---
MMOs have several hundreds to thousands of times more content on top of the chores.
---
200+ hours.  Was hoping for 200 more.  But I'm out.  Scorched beasts are damage sponges.  And there are about 5 times as many now that they cannot be killed with good weapons.  Thanks Beth.  Already deleted game. 
---
Yeah I wouldn’t want that either. 
---
They released 76 just to show that fallout should always be single player. They wanted people to stop asking for a multiplayer version.
---
The fact that it's the game's fault. 
---
Can confirm, I have a two shot (not explosive) handmade, with all 3 rifle perks maxed, and it still takes way too much ammo to kill a single ghoul now.
---
You kind of seem like a Bethesda apologist 
---
and that has nothing to do with what I just said.
---
Nice work. Pretty in line with my feelings on the most important enhancements and gap fixes for how the game plays and its core presence based design. My /u is always open if you’d like to see my action bar customizing, perk card and item/container streamlining thoughts. 
---
The circlejerk rot is setting in deep.
---
No, sorry, I’ve been playing the game. And it wasn’t nerfed a while ago. If it wasn’t so tedious I wouldn’t need to try to farm caps to buy the absurd amount of recourses needed to complete everyday tasks. I don’t have 10 hours a day to play and it’s just too tedious with the way things are set up atm.
---
Excluding the suggestions of how to lay it out I honestly think your suggestion of laying out a beta server for this specific game is the most constructive suggestion I have seen made to help sort out this shambles and If I could give u gold I really would. Honestly hope someone sees this suggestion and has a very long think about how much good PR they would buy...
---
This game has been plagued by poor management decisions from the start.
---
The individual making decisions, so far as I can tell in research, is Todd Howard, the executive producer.
---
I’m on Xbox sorry for late reply. 
---
So I don't know much about NMS, only the past issues.   What's up with the base building?  I thought you were leaving planets to fly deeper and further out?  Wouldn't building bases be pointless, ultimately?   Just curious, as I've heard a lot of good thing about it, and I've been tempted to pick it up on sale.   
---
And yet going by bethesdas reputation atm they'll go and do that anyway in the name of balance, pissing off those already in melee builds and those who are currently trying to respec from tse builds to it
---
I just bought another item from the atom shop.
---
No, you said that players that can't pay their cap bounty should have an item from the weapon or armour tab removed at random - potentially their best stuff for just not having any caps. I then gave you an example of how horrible that could be, which you didn't address at all, and called getting a whole 10 cap bounty (lowest possible?) "intentional". Go back and read the thread, it seems we're not communicating properly here
---
Like I said, I wanted a nerf, but this was too much. 
---
They need a hotfix or a rollback ASAP. 
---
An official statement wouldn't be enough. 
---
Nope, no radiation damage with my weapons.
---
I bet I killed myself with my TSE shotgun than you did with your bloody build if that's how you're calculating and justifying risk vs reward
---
Tin foil theory:
---
Bethesda Austin has only ever made mobile games and had no idea what they’re doing when it comes to player economy, game balance, or how to make a game.
---
Their only experience is in making gimmicky games that revolve heavily around MTX.
---
Have met the guy in person...he's a slimy person who isn't honest. Yea I'm good 
---
It's sad we have to some times bring politics to a game. Fo76 isn't really that game, but I don't think your being serous.. 
---
I haven't encountered the returning bugs everyone's talking about, apart from the bobby pin weight. Though container/inventory/crafting lag felt a little worse last night.
---
We did get a lot of the quality of life improvements and fixes we've been waiting for in this update, like flagging known plans/recipes in vendors (I actually had to wait in line at several vendors last night), but it's been overshadowed by the old bugs that returned, and people salty about nerfs that we've almost all expected since day one.
---
Yep, I'm out. I've given this cash grab too many chances and a full retail price tag. Peace out, Bethe$da. I never did anything flashy, but I did manage to fix two of your most annoying sloppy mistakes in FO4. I'm done, because you're clearly beyond help, unless some gaming enthusiast billionaire angel investor takes the company private and kicks Zeni to the curb. 
---
Not sure how I feel about this.
---
I'm sorry but... wow. This is **pathetic,** you guys.  So we're asking the dev to test their buggy patches on us to fix their buggy game that we paid them for?  That might be the saddest, most apologist thing I've heard on this sub.
---
Thanks, bro. #appreciated
---
In theory the longer you play, the more likely you are to purchase something from the Atom Shop. If you blast through the game in three days and never look back, you wont see the new items and find something you just have to get. If you're playing for months and months, there's a much greater chance of them catching your eye with something shiny. Not a direct source of income, but absolutely related. It's how MMOs work, but most of them also have subscriptions so there's that incentive. 
---
they're only slightly better than a regular version of the weapon. so little that you could just ignore it completely.
---
meanwhile, bloodied and melee remain just as op.
---
Bloodied Melee can still do 10,000+ damage.  TSE Handmade that has 320dmg needs to be nerfed to 90.  Yeah sure, awesome balance now.
---
Yeah, never noticed this issue after they patched the "invincibility" glitch for mobs until this patch
---
i agree. I uninstalled it 2 days ago. It was a real pain. Not only because i spended 60 euros for almost nothing but also because my expectations where slowly annilhated from the first minute i played the beta to last monday.
---
The fact that they reput an old buged version for an UPDATE was simply enough.
---
Guess ill go back to fallout 3  
---
Also the only good thing of this game was his community. Thanks partners...  
---
Sadly I would have to agree with you
---
Is the team aware of the broken stealth mechanics now? Always in “caution”, easier to get spotted, ect.
---
What MMO are you talking about? I've never seen it. In most MMO's the chores are your punishment for dying. In FO76, there is no punishment for dying and the chores are 90% of the game no matter how well you play it.
---
I hope he makes a follow up video because it seems he did not play it much it or speak to many that did post patch. The issues players are experiencing are pretty overt 
---
Well not rly, i dont even grind anymore, not for legendaries or plans. Because u can buy those at vendors now. So all u can do is grind for caps or other players. The last patch made me kinda feel lost.  No need to claim workshops for plans, no need seek legendaries.  All there is left is pvp but most ppl are on pacifist mode. 
---
My issue is a level 50 non legendary hardened hunting rifle does 3 damage less than my TSE handmade. A legendary should be a decent bit better than that.  I'm not asking for 400+ damage like it was because yea it was to much. I'm asking for like 250ish because it's a fully modded legendary with two perks. 
---
Yup I had to repair my weapon pretty fast as well after just doing a few runs in Whitespring. It's absolutely ridiculous. I have to constantly repair my shotgun now
---
I was thinking of doing a stat overview of weapons.  
---
There are lots of tweaks that need to be done to them, but the same issue also arises with armor.  I'm not a PA user except in really rare occasions.  
---
Laser and Plasma are great except for their durability.  They are likely about where they need to be damage-wise.  You just can't use them for more than a few shots.  
---
Half (or more) of the melee weapons are underpowered, and a few are OP.  
---
And yeah, the list goes on.  
---
The thing is that most people look at them from an end-game perspective.  There are very few games where it doesn't boil down to a few select weapons that everyone wants.  The only way I see around this is to not only have a good balance to the weapons, but get the perks for them balanced so multiple builds become viable using a wider variety of weapons.
---
One of which is Donald Trumps’s brother Robert
---
I've played since launch, none of the updates of reset my progress...
---
&gt;  like most MMOs these days they're having us make our own
---
Uh...what? I haven't heard of an MMO focusing on that besides a fringe sandbox MMO that, let's be honest, probably has 10 people playing at best. 
---
You know where to get the jackets man? 
---
Weren’t they supposed to be releasing on PC first and then consoles a few days later for this exact reason? Of course they don’t do that on the one patch it matters.
---
Computer games are a way to keep the population distracted from important things like geopolitics etc. Some of them are intentionally bad, and intentionally mess up, because it helps channel peoples anger into something completely trivial.
---
I'd even spend a few special points if it meant I could travel to train stations for free.
---
And possibly weapons 
---
Your first line states that YOU are used to getting thousands of hours out of a fallout title....and now your back tracking on that?
---
Im assuming your a tween/teenager by your language and grammer, so your responsibities are homework and chores?? I mean come on lil buddy.
---
What in my comment made you assume I have no responsibilites? I have a 40/hr per week job, run my own company on the side, take care of 3 amazing fur babies and still have time for gaming, hobbies and keeping my house clean and updated.
---
Yea the disconnects sucked, but your attempting to make a mountain out of a molerat hole.
---
Agreed. Going back to FO4 and Sim Settlements. 
---
At least that team knows how to make shit work. 
---
Yeah I don’t agree with all of the nerfs and the blueprints being in every vendor, I feel it added to the game’s challenge (wasn’t much to begin with) and added an extra layer to the game that no longer exists since everyone can have every recipe now if they have the caps. 
---
They’ve essentially killed player vending and killed the need for legendaries if they’re all now subpar, what do we even have to strive for if the best isn’t really all that good? Melee is back on top and explosives are nerfed to hell and back. I guess bloodied is the new meta but I’m not down for that tbh.
---
Atleast melee has to be point blank range and deal with hits not registering, TSE weapons would destroy from way too far away. 
---
And bloodied is a way more risky play style. Much like the one shot builds on dark souls, you have to be super low health for the highest damage. 
---
Base building serves as a storage center (one of a couple actually) and a way to quick travel to resources you want/need quickly.  You can travel to bases via space stations, which are in every system you visit, thus if you run out of a resource and you built a base on a planet with that resource, you can just fast travel instead of wasting fuel.
---
You also need a base to complete vehicle missions to unlock land and water based vehicles to make planet traversal faster, but that is completely superlative and not at all a requirement to "beat" the game.
---
Literally, NMS is basically just space Minecraft at the end of the day for me.  I literally only play it to create epic sized bases.
---
And every gun build requires like 30 points. 9 just for damage.... if you’re doing melee, you’re going to have 15 strength anyway because strength directly relates to damage. It’s not such a big deal to spend 9 points to ignore armor, so extra damage, swing faster.... for rifles, 9 perks gets you 60% damage increase, that’s it.
---
No TSE is two shot and also explosive. These are two different attributes on the same weapon, which is why its two stars. My point was it seems like people are lumping every two shot into the TSE category they are not the same. 
---
Fallout 76 just leaves me feeling empty not knowing what to do next, wanting to delete and reinstall Fallout 4. 
---
Nah it was just a pre beta. 
---
Alpha was before that, at the time they were testing the alpha it was actually just fallout 4. 
---
It’s been 3 months and they still haven’t opened a single Vault, despite the fact that so many players are in the same situation as you (lvl 100+, explored everything, etc).
---
In every prior fallout, vaults were my favorite.  Each one was unique, with weird stories and characters.  Now I do the same dumb daily quests over and over.  I feel so stupid for making this game my first ever pre-order.  Lesson learned 
---
I knew it was a matter of time before these threads started popping up. Not surprised in the least. 
---
That's the dumbest argument I've ever heard. I kill MYSELF with MY super op explosive shotgun more than you die running around with low health. 
---
&gt;Before EA decided to cash in on loot boxes, 
---
Agreed, shitty practice. Hope it dies off soon.
---
&gt;horde the Star Wars license
---
No "hording" here. Disney was selling the licence, EA bought it. I'd say both are at fault for the state of Star Wars games.
---
&gt;cancel games in mid development
---
Every company does this. If a game is not coming along well, sometimes its better to axe the whole thing and spend the resources on something else. If they didnt, we'd end up with more dumpster fires like Andromeda.
---
&gt; absorbing small studios just to shut them
---
Ah yes, evil EA bought studios JUST to shut them down and take joy out of the world. Nope, had nothing to do with studios underperforming or their leads leaving before the acquisition. Nope, purely out of EA's malicious goal to kill video games.
---
 &gt;also keeping the KOTOR franchise in limbo
---
SWTOR is still active. Yeah it sucks that they didnt release a proper single player Kotor, but the series is still alive.
---
 &gt;they also made a name for themselves by attempting to extort money from players willing to buy used EA titles by making them purchase overpriced keys in order to unlock features already available if new
---
Ah, here we go. This is peak /r/gamingcirclejerk material here. This is why that subreddit exists. This is such a nonissue that I don't get why people are complaining. So far, "project 10 dollar" content has been completely optional. I did my first playthrough of ME2 without the content, and I had no idea it existed. The exclusion didnt hurt the game at all. This was just them rewarding players buying new, and to make some money off used (since used sales give them no income). 
---
And today, if you buy a "Goty" edition of any game used from any publisher... you cant use the code for the included DLC.
---
Also, "extort"? Really? 
---
&gt;When I was watching the Fallout 76 development documentary it said he was one of the main developers for Ultima Online
---
Are you sure about that? I never played UO, but I saw their (entertaining) postmortem talk.
---
Most of the problems he talked about when they basically went blind into this whole online thing were/are the exact same I see in Fo76.
---
If a core dev from UO's early MMO days is actually part of the Fo76 team, he either must have had an aneurysm or no say in anything.
---
I think all the issues are very frustrating my friend. I think the biggest for me was the re introduction of old code that brought many items back to being bugged. From Bobby pins, to the dupe glitch working again. Now that duping is back to its full potential we can almost guarantee that the bloodied weapons that are now god tier will be mass duped just like the tse weapons before them. 
---
I don't get how this sub can go from "Bethesda is working on the game, we have to be patient" to "BETHESDA DOESNT GIVE A FUCK. THIS GAME IS SHIT!!111" in the space of a couple of weeks.  One bad patch and you're all getting twisted panties? 
---
I abhor the circlejerk nature of Reddit.  It's a complete lack of critical thinking, individualism and open mindedness.
---
It can't and won't always be plain sailing.  They will make mistakes.  It's about how they rectify them.  They can't get away with poor patches, don't get me wrong.  But to give up on the game because of one? Extremely fickle.  None of the hysteria is helping them or us with the game.
---
&gt;Even the Bobby pin weight is imaginary
---
it very clearly says 0.1. I dropped 50 and my load was reduced by 5.
---
guess I'm just imagining things, though!
---
it's mainly what the other person who replied to you said, reintroducing old bugs, but it's also in terms of overall performance. personally, my game was running the best it ever had after the first January patch. i immediately felt the difference after yesterdays patch. repeated crashing, fr drops and freezing. it just kind of felt like the horizon was coming up and we were going to see more content-focused patches in the future, but with the mess that this patch was, it has some of us concerned.
---
Oops! Sorry about the spelling! 
---
Thank you for taking the time to reply, coming from games where teams routinely go silent at the slightest bit of controversy it’s refreshing to see the level of interaction seen on this sub! Maybe others have seen better, but I really haven’t and I really do appreciate your work and the work of other CMs.
---
Hope people stop treating you so harshly, in a way I can relate- used to be a waiter and had food thrown on me from dissatisfied patrons when I never prepared it- anyway wish u the best
---
And again thanks for the reply!
---
18 quintillion planets to explore. Sometimes folks find a little slice of the universe they wanna call home. Besides, there are stargates (call em what you will but them damn things is Stargates lol) which allow you to travel back regardless of where you are. 
---
Some build farms for resources and cash. Some just build. But if you want ANY vehicles outside of ships (ground/submersible) you need to build a base to a certain point of a quest line. 
---
yesterday i pulled out my fully upgraded shotgun, rifle, and railgun.  all were taking like ten plus shots to take down supermutants and robots even at medium to close range.  then when i pull out my hook (quick hitting melee) or hammer (slow hitting melee) I can take them down in three shots.  That makes absolutely no sense.  
---
&gt; Lead and aluminium are lighter in bulk. 
---
The only things that are. which is a bit of a shame bulk should be lighter for storage reasons. 
---
&gt; Also no one bulks stuff just 5 seconds before they sell it. You bulk in advance, and then sell what you can later. You may be left with bulked junk that you now like to automatically use if you run low.
---
I bulk items I have in abundance and then go right into selling them.  And if I've reached my cap limit with all the vendors I can then I just drop it or if I'm feeling generous drop it at Over Seer's Camp.  Because the only resources I'm ever actually needing to look for is adhesive, ballistic fiber, screws and lately springs.  
---
overwatch
---
fortnite 
---
destiny 2
---
RDR2
---
that's for starters, sorry to interrupt you slobbing on the FO76 knob pal. Let me ask you, wtf do you do when you log into FO76? farm uranium fever? SBQ? Nuke goodsprings? Is that still fun for you? it was my first 15-20 times. I doubt you are getting anything in Feb. and in March they are releasing a shitty battle royal mode. great, that's what fallout is known and loved for, battle royal mode. face it man, this game is dying, and soon all that's going to be left are the apologist.
---
The corporate management is certainly disconnected from the player base. I think the dev team is poorly led too. They appear to bad at their jobs top to bottom. 
---
Could be a mole, could be a boss who is sure they are always right. Something needs a look at though for sure.
---
What can bethesda do? Give the rights of the game to zenimax online and go the fuck away. Yeah zenimax is greedy but atleast they know how to balance and manage an online game
---
That shouldn't be the case and is being looked into. If you are able to stack bobbleheads, would you send me your info in a DM so I can send that to the team investigating?
---
Lol. Just realized the gist of the conversation:  
---
Me: Bethesda has stopped caring about complaints.  
---
You: Apologist.  
---
Me: \*blinks slowly\*  
---
The equation is to find the coeffecient by which you multiply the base damage. The base damage of a TS would be increased to 125.
---
Ps4 pro. Ever since this latest patch I cannot fix anything regardless of how many materials I have. It still says I'm lacking the correct amount. Says I need 3 adhesive,  I have thirty and cannot fix it. 
---
Guessing you haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2 yet, have you?
---
I also enjoyed the Fire Breathers questline a lot. And the first few Raider quests are funny, too. 
---
Circlejerk replies are circlejerk.
---
I suppose so, but it's awfully short sighted. If people would rather run 5000 events to try and get a full suit of t51 plans, I don't get it. That's still how it's done for building power armor unfortunately, but at least I'm not stuck server hopping if I want a t60 stealth boy. I can just go play the game, and be on my way. Rather than not playing the game, and just loading in and out constantly.
---
Yes I do. And no, I didn't.
---
It's called paraphrasing. And this post 100% does read like one of those "big corporation stopped caring :( im so sad".
---
Bethesda isn't your friend. They literally never have been. They made 1 game you didn't like and suddenly you despise them and everything they do.
---
This post was pointless and accomplished nothing but more manchild whining.
---
Okay...  bye I guess?
---
"oh yes," they say "we love playing the game too". Right....
---
Wish it was more serious if there going to make a whole new mode dedicated to this stuff why not go all out, I want it to feel the hype of  killing someone with a really cool weapon or cool armour piece
---
Sure but it is still to this day heavily flawed. they fix one thing and get set back on 20 different things they break in the process.
---
I'm not adding a 25% anywhere... If a base gun has 100 damage, its TS variant will have 125. That's the only addition of % I did.
---
I have and loved every minute of it! 
---
I'm not doubting what you're saying, but if you had a link to an article or other reddit post I'd much appreciate it.  Anything to better understand what has just been a strange set of disappointing surprises from this developer.
---
I really wish I didn't have to agree, but I do. I know no one in charge reads these our posts any attention to us or our wants, but someone needs to get shuffled around. This is a potentially great game held back at every step by glaring incompetence and it *has* to end, if only for their shareholders. I can't be the only one here rapidly losing the last of my tattered faith in Bethesda after this trainwreck of continued blunders.

I found a core in the generator at the elevator last night and in a couple PA suits
---
Can’t you see this game is just wasting your time?
---
Wait - seriously? Why?
---
Damned if they do damned if they don't
---
Last night someone nuked Whitesprings and every other ghoul had a legendary.  Nothing great but I got dozens
---
I am a pistol build with 5 strength, 0 melee perks. Any two handed weapon does roughly the same as my explosive revolver. Doesn’t that seem like an issue?
---
I agree that specific builds (glass cannon, bloodied+unyielding etc) is the main culprit, but to say that melee is fine is just not true. It shouldn’t be able to compete with the weapons I’ve teched into, especially since there is no ammo or reloading requirement, just need some glue and cans.
---
I'm sure you're better off with that level of nihilism.
---
You said "intended gameplay" - like we have any respect for their intent at this point.. what I noticed or not is completely irrelevant in regards to how completely ruined the game is now.
---
Dont you think that we should get our perks refunded when they make them crap?
---
Dont you think they should fix the AI on these mobs before making our weapons junk?
---
Is it a fun challenge for you to be blastet by flying monsters that give crap loot and xp and refuse to land?
---
I don't think you actually play this game.
---
Interesting, even though in order to play this game we have to pay for a subscription service?
---
That's a known issue with the new patch and they're aware
---
&gt;Defend what? Have you tested the bobby pin weight? I deposited 100 of them in my stash and withdrew them. My weight did not change. The UI says 0.1 but the actual weight is less.
---
Because I heard about this and I tested, at least taking 10 bobby pins out of stash, made stash 1 lbs less. So the weight in stash seems to be as listed, 0.1.
---
But I have to say I didn't realize to check my own carry weight, because I can remember only one number at a time. Or did I. I remember selling some and it vaguely remember it changed the weight by 1, when selling 10. Im sure about their weight in stash being correct, not 100% sure about in inventory. Plus if some perks affect it, which I might not have when selling to vendors.
---
However several boosters like alcohol and food stuff, were increasing way too much. Sweet pie increased my charisma by 4.2, intead of the listed 3. Normal alcohol boosted my streight by 2, not 1. My normal boosted carry weight is about 280, now it went to 300 or 305. I did upgrade one pocked piece into deep pocketed but that doesn't explain the abnormal boosts.
---
Oddly I thought I took screenshots but I don't seem to have any about them.
---
&gt;Is a video of someone pre patch literally one shot killing a level 50 Mirelurk Queen and 2 shooting a level 65 Scorch Beast.
---
It was quite entertaining to watch someone with at least explosive shotgun, shooting a milurk queen. He and I had to shoot it few mins. It was funny because the range at which he shot it with a shotgun, was absurdly long. Shotguns aren't supposed to do anything from so long range. It still did way more damage at that long range, than my revolver at normal range.
---
There's a spawn close to my camp and the player had build a camp right in front of it. Never seen any camps anywhere near mine, because mine is next to SB spawn.
---
It’s a slap in the face.
---
I agree all but regular armor. I can be setup to have as much or more deff then then with pa. They do need to fix the issue where the +rad legendary effect simply doesn't work.
---
I'd be fine with losing aid/food/ammo, taking condition loss hits on other stuff, or gaining significant temporary debuffs. I try not to die as a point of pride, but the current penalty is largely inconsequential.
---
Oh please, the majority of posts are from people complaining that the game just got too hard from the TSE and perk changes. They wouldn’t be able to handle it..
---
I personally only really play PvE and love raiding - class sets used to be so unique and enjoyable for me. Getting rid of those and replacing them with generic traits that just have a chance to proc for some amount of bonus damage really ruined it for me, in addition to the overall simplification of classes in general. All my classes just don't feel as fun to play and I feel like there is no set for me to focus on grinding for, besides hoping to get Azerite pieces with the right traits. Haven't played the new war front - but the last one was disappointing in that it was always just a matter of time till you win. They were super cool conceptually and functionally, besides the fact that you are 99% to win so it feels like any effort you really put in is wasted. Again, all just my opinions 🤷‍♂️
---
Hell yeah some real danger instead of this overprotective sensitive scared stuff
---
Add an insane amount of engaging and dynamic content
---
Lol. No, just saying it looks like you are trying to justify their garbage. I wasn't trying to insult you.
---
I shot one in the head sneaking for 10% hp. Like welp guess I gotta go back to ss. Ended up hitting it for 25% lol
---
NMS was pretty boring when it came out. FO76 has at least one end game thing to do....
---
I disagree with the title. Emptying multiple magazines into a random enemy makes me feel like my guns are trash, even if they’re current level. Forget pistols and energy weapons entirely. Explosives aren’t much better. Melee is the only viable option unless your entire build is dedicated to shotguns, at which point they’re okay.
---
and if you find something else you enjoy I'm sure they are going to nerf that too.
---
Its not melee its Str
---
\+80% boost melee damage at 15 points means that a sledgehammer can out damage a rifle without even perks 
---
what we need to do is have boosted damage for other skills to based off of SPECIAL 
---
Str +40% big guns / Shotguns  
---
Agi - +40% pistols  
---
INT - +40% energy weapons (plasma / laser / tesla)  
---
Per - +40% to rifles 
---
this would boost damage across the board to make things less tanky and open up more game play options. No nerfs required.
---
So have I. Twice they renamed the resources and then in turn removed all your upgrades to multi-tool, ship, freighter, house etc and they used the justification that they changed the name of the resource so you can't own the upgrades anymore. The last major update I logged in to check out also deleted my house because the planets were all changed. My ship that was maxed out on upgrades cannot survive a fight now, my house no longer exists, my freighter is empty... If you don't think that is lost progress then you don't understand what lost progress is. 
---
I was cool with the thought of vending machines for us to sell our goods, and maybe another 100 lbs of stash increase. The only good thing that came out of this patch is the “known” next to our already known plans and recipes. 
---
Everything else needs to return back to the last version time now, they need to take more time with the next serious patch. 
---
I found dense combat there
---
Dude, yes you are... let me bold the parts where:  
---
.5\[(100/92.5).^(3653)\] = .51 -&gt; .51(100) = 51 dmg
---
.5\[(**125**/185).^(3653)\] = .43 -&gt; .43(**125**) = 54 dmg  
---
You do not use the second 125. You are giving yourself another %25 damage at the end.
---
I don't know if you managed to get the plans, or if you're still looking to get them, but I'm on Xbox and will happily get them for you if you'd like/if you're on same console.
---
I agree with that.
---
Yeah this place is the drizzling shits.  Gamer entitmement is running rife and the hypocrisy is overwhelming.
---
Exactly makes it worthwhile at least hopefully they fix to op builds firdt though 
---
Show me a melee that can do 10k+ damage without stacked bobbleheads
---
inb4 you continue playing like everyone else who says they are quitting 
---
Bethesda, I beg you to put the weapons back the way they were and then never touch them ever again. I cant kill a single thing now,literally! Since you did the update, I ran out off all my amo and my weapons all broke. I'm running around with a shovel because the weapons dont have enough power to even want to use them.i quit, I'm gana go play other games till u fix this mess
---
after the patch? plan?
---
idk what you're even trying to say my dude.
---
Send a letter on your own behalf, I’m part of the community and you don’t speak for me.
---
You know what I suggested is that they nerf the values for individual guns. The 50 cal TSE wasn’t a room clearer but it did good damage, the Dragon that I have (TSE lvl 35) did 1500 damage and 2.5x that if I got a sneak shot but takes ages for a reload and breaks in like 5 shots. It was my scorchedbeast slayer. I would go and hunt scorch beasts and be methodical about my approach, aiming only for headshots. It wouldn’t kill in one shot but it would do great damage and make the rest of the fight bearable. 
---
Why treat that the same as an 8 round pump that kills everything in sight or a TSE Submachine Gun or 10mm pistol? Doesn’t make any damn sense. 
---
Just wanna say that it sucks you have to be the face of this mess.
---
Bethesda is a company that has been around for decades by now, and this level of incompetence from the developers and the managers doesn't reflect upon you as a community manager -- you're just doing your job.
---
Good luck, and I hope the devs can make your life a little easier going forwards. 
---
Anger is still an emotion, I objectively agree that many things were broken at the onset of the game. There were also many new and interesting features that we pushed without enough prior research on the part of Bethesda. 
---
There defense of Bethesda from many likely lies in the fact that there are many promising features and ideas in this game, we want it to be good, great even... And it could be, but the current direction (PvP release!?) and state of the game at release understandably make it hard to see that.
---
I think they're just scrambling to respond to the many differing viewpoints of fans but no matter what they do at this point there will be anger. 
---
Unarmed iron fist is still as effective, with the radworms bug/buff, it’s actually as effective as PA.
---
skeleton key
---
I cannot agree more with this post and all the people commenting. The end game is empty, it's just a shell of what these games used to be. It's sad to see this game studio and development team destroying it's self and it's reputation. Every update I pray for it to be better but every time they have an opportunity to make the game better they shoo themselves in foot and stick another middle finger to the true fans trying their hardest to stick it out. 
---
No. Before the patch
---
Thats what i am saying people are now upset they have to play game 
---
The royal 'we'.
---
No, I'm multiplying the damage of the weapon, before any reduction by armor, which is 125, by the coeffecient, which is .43
---
I can't believe that you think ageism is a viable arguement and that you live your life with so many incorrect assumptions about others.  Please learn to correctly interpret what others are writing and speak not of what you are ignorant about because your lack of education and human decency is showing.
---
How is the exploration on and in between planets? The base-building is new to me since I've never played the game, but I've been interested in the cool ecosystems and systems.
---
Also note that the legendary item rolls after regular loot, so it's not uncommon for drops to show up a few (or several) seconds later at least for me on PC. If they don't drop legs I always recheck a while later.
---
I'm not saying this was the case here, just informing people.
---
Inside the vault is just lies and leaves out tons of stuff... example: Demo expert nerf
---
It's like melee is the only viable build, why do they do this to us -.- 
---
I understand your message. Just thought I'd help in the only way I could. ☺️
---
Well that sucks.. Yeah I missed out on Legion for sure, I remember going to my dads and seeing him with ashbringer.  I was like "wtf how?"  Always dreamed of owning it.  Now I heard it is obsolete.  Or are you referring to the tier sets from older WoW?
---
you'd have money, but still no class 
---
WELL THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO MAKE MELEE WORSE, WHEN THEY CAN JUST MAKE YOUR GUNS BETTER???? DONT YOU WANT TO BE POWERFUL?
---
If what we are seeing with the nerfs, melee nerf will be the the next step in this game's evolution. 
---
I agree with that too, especially when my super sledge can two hit a ghoul and my tesla rifle takes several times that.
---
If I continue to play I just have to learn where every single caps stash on the whole map is now. Then I have to figure out the respawn timer, and if it can be sped up.
---
Ah, you mean 'your independence and progress in life should be come from your own hands and not contingent on what your neighbors do'?  See, it all fits!   
---
Yeah I had a TSE lever action and the little bit I played post patch was still 2-3 shooting level 50 scorched and supermutnats 
---
Imagine dying tho all your stuff gone - feelsbadman pride hurt, but then the feeling of risking everything after to get it all back man real excitement 
---
Sometimes I can clear that bogus "caution" by standing up then crouching back down.  Worked in Harper's Ferry just now at any rate.
---
Says the one who spends his time trolling Reddit to paper over his crippling insecurities.

keep a Gunsmith 5 perk card and then another Gunsmith at whatever number u need.
---
or do u need to bring Intelligence down to 4 or less?

Mods are updated as the game is updated. That's how it has always been and it will always be that way. Game updates won't ruin the mods, the mods out now are literally just fixing the things Bethesda won't fix. You're thinking of mods like driveable vehicles or adding modern weapons into the game, which cannot be done currently because we don't have the 76 creation kit. The mods currently available are more like the text chat, improved (local) gun sounds, map overlays, and inventory filters, nothing fundamentally changing the game. Quality of life mods to make it more bearable to play. Will most of the mods I use be obsolete in a year? Maybe, if Bethesda gets their shit together and actually fixes the problems, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
---
Yup, that abuse makes the meat taste better 
---
Just wanna weigh in. 
---
I'm a 10 year WoW vet who quit after the bullshit that is BFA -- if you are burnt out on 76, I can't recommend WoW right now. It's the same situation with a different game -- Blizzard not listening to feedback and putting in features players don't want.
---
Ironically, I switched to ESO in the last few months and I am having a blast. The solo play is incredible and the questing is without a doubt the best I've ever played in an MMO. Betheda may be fucking up with 76 but whoever is handling ESO is doing The Elder Scrolls better than Bethesda Game Studios ever could. 
---
Yea it kinda got to me actually. 
---
Yes this is true n I agree a lot of things on this sub get upvoted or downvoted when it shouldn’t while other important things are just ignored. That is on us as a community to voice our concerns to Bethesda. However, Bethesda choose to answer that question publicly because they want people to keep buying the game which people won’t do if they think the game is going F2P. Bethesda only speaks up when it’s profits are in jeopardy. They are fixing the issues everyone is complaining most about so we as a community need to collectively figure out those issues n let Bethesda know what they are so they can attempt to fix them. I don’t agree with really any of their decisions they have made thus far expect that I always wanted to play fallout online with my friends. Bethesda is at fault here not you,  I can see the points you are making n I agree the community needs to tone down all the cosmetic n end game complaints so that Bethesda can focus on the real game breaking issues. But the point I was trying to show you was that arguing with idiots is no way to make your point. You need to let them all bitch n moan until they find something else to birch n moan about in the near future. Just downvote their comment n move on you getting downvoted to hell doesn’t help anyone. Use your fake internet points for good fellow wastelander!

:(
---
How exactly do you define a circlejerk? Is anything negative about Fallout 76 a circlejerk?
---
That doesnt prove if strength bobbleheads were stacked or not. My bloodied powerfist cant even come close to that with maximizing strength in unyielding as well as all the right damage perks and adrenaline reaction. I call bullshit
---
I have never seen such a dedicator and authoritarian developer like Bethesda. You push out a broken game, you neglect it for weeks, and how do you start the new year? WITH A BAN HAMMER I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN THE LIKES OF GAMING HISTORY? no. . . You lied to us and then we forgave and accepted the situation you put your self in and trusted you to fix it. Then just like Adolf, Castro, Mao, and many other you send out massive unfair and destructive bans in the dead of night. Me and the others will remember this and for the first time we will have to think twice of buying another game from you. You dont need new leadership you need a new dam engine. 
---
If anything we could use another letter from ol todd, like the one we got right before launch that pretty much said "you guys are in for a bumpy ride".
---
I wanna love the game, but the issues plauging it are making it real hard for me to drop destiny 2 and warframe, and come back. Hearing "what went wromg, and what they plan to do" straight from the horse mouth would be nice.
---
youre now just noticing this? You quitting the game wont make a difference.You deciding to give them money or not does. You're part of the problem.
---
I do very much appreciate that! I think I will take a small break from FO76 for a bit, and play all the other games I’ve neglected. 
---
Then why is the first number only 100? You can't factor it twice. I don't know why that doesn't make sense... "dmg" is the paper damage of the weapon. If you're saying a weapon does 100 damage, then the TS version does 125. Yes? That makes sense... the full calculation is:  
---
 .5\[(**100**/92.5).3653\] = .51
---
.5\[(**125**/185).3653\] = .43  
---
But you are adding another 25% at the end of the final calculations of damage reduction that have already been applied to the 125% paper damage of the TS weapon:  
---
 .5\[(**125**/185).3653\] = .43 -&gt; .43(**125**) = 54 dmg   
---
You do not do this.
---
500 atoms!
---
Sorry 
---
Just shelf it for a bit until they patch and add stuff. Not the end of the world. Plenty of other games coming out to hold peoples interest. 
---
I am currently doing just that. Trying to make my way through RE2, RDR2, and Odyssey. Plus a bunch of other games are coming out soon. 
---
these need to be like 800
---
This is the absolute laziest form of game design. I’m not doing those missions on general principle.
---
I had actually been thinking that one of the reasons I still respect Bethesda is that they don’t try to cram platform into or stupid tests into the game, then 30 minutes later I arrived at McClintock...
---
Maybe they'll add a fixed version of the game to the Atom Store. They can call it "FO76 - Todd's Vision"
---
Lol. Now paints that should have been in the base game are only a 5th the price if the game!!!
---
So i dont take garbage.  Ok...  then what do i have to sell then?   U act like 3* god roll weapons drop like flies.   
---
Defend what? Your bitching about a reply where they say "look dude, they're totally different departments. It's not a choice of atom shop or bugs.". Thats a stupid thing to bitch about, and your statement of the micro transactions is idiotic... Im not defending shit, but its tiring to see complaints that are ridiculous...
---
My problem with it is that it’s just straight up boring compared to the other Fallout games. The grind is intense and without NPCs the game feels empty of character, like a junk collector/sightseeing simulator. I do have hope that the game will improve over time but with all the item duping the economy is already trash and it seems like with every update they just up the difficulty/grind. 
---
It has all the downsides of a typical MMO launch and all of the downsides of a typical game launch rolled into one. hehe
---
They should not disable PvP, some of us enjoy it.
---
Its the only reason i bought the game. Arguably, PvP players may be the only community left in a year. There isnt much pve content....
---
PvP is a revenue source. We have a never ending game. Your game eventually ends.
---
Bethesda will never abandon the pvp community. 
---
Bethesda is a front for a satanic cult that also deals in human trafficking/ritual sacrifice. They released FO76 to increase the amount of anger/hatred/depression in the FO community so they will be easier targets for abduction/indoctrination. 
---
You're totally fine, I was just trying to make a little light hearted joke. 
---
And thank you for that! Your kind words mean a lot to me, personally.
---
LMAO WHAT A JOKE OF A POST PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK MAKING A REDDIT POST WILL DO ANYTHING?????????? YOU SHOULD HAVE USED YOUR BRAIN AND VOTED WITH YOUR WALLET.
---
They do aspect you to give them some credit at that price lol
---
I saw it being offered up on my. Too scared to waste a perk point to try.lolz
---
This is exactly my issue. I will 100% stand by TSE before patch was broke as shit. I had more laughs and fun running around killing ANY enemy I saw while killing myself as well. What's left to do when you beat the game. BUT the issue now is that a level 14 robot takes more than one shot. 
---
np, I overreacted
---
Diablo 3 took nearly two years and a whole expansion to fix their loot problem. I really hope Bethesda doesn't wait that long.
---
yeah, 5 points for i think what works out to about 8% isn't good value to me when i could put them into the second levels of Commando or Rifleman and get 5% per point. The bigger issue for me is, do let myself have a lower damage in order to be a useful member of the community or do I just look out for number 1? Learning the Radium mods was a great adventure, just as I posted a couple of days ago, and I would never want that time back. But 2 days later I have found myself stuck in between a rock and a hard place.
---
"I don't know what paraphrasing is" - PeeFarts
---
I actually stopped playing about 3 weeks after release, but kept the game installed in the event they fixed it. Well after yesterday’s update, seeing so many people complain about old bugs coming back and the game being broken in more ways now, I’ve decided to uninstall and it’s going to stay that way. 
---
Bethesda, it’s not you, it’s me. 
---
I’m kidding, it’s you. 
---
Well when you have so many ways to increase damage of course players will try to stack them. With guns you get perks and chems which is why it is so week compared to melee. TSE was a way to give balance and although it was a little too strong it didn't need to be destroyed like this patch did
---
It’s pretty absurd. I actually carry four Gatling lasers with me to fight the queen now. That seems to be the right number to ensure you still have a weapon left at the end of the fight. 
---
Don’t be showing that premium loot. Bethesda my nerf the almighty legendary pin 
---
I know I'm not owed anything. It was my decision to buy the game, Bethesda isn't in debt to me.
---
Expecting something ≠ claiming to have the right to something.
---
Yeah getting a bunch of people on the internet who will whine and complain about literally anything to agree on a letter will work fine
---
"Jim" makes mods that make all the scorched nekked with with big rack, "Jim" has mush support from the younger crowd. Seriously all I ever see on the front page of FO4 Nexus is nekked, skin, and boob mods.
---
This ONE condition justifies going through the game oneshotting things.
---
If you believe TSE was OP then melee is also OP
---
Well yeah, them and FB! 
---
Certain mobs do have high perception like molerats and radscorpions.  They've always been able to spot me fairly easily, but there are still issues that have cropped up since the patch with other mobs that shouldn't able to sense us from so far away suddenly becoming aware of our presence from way too far away.
---
lol, I stand corrected. 
---
I’m going back to Vault 111. 
---
Wow so you're actually taking one of the QA/tester jobs here?  You know that this is honestly complete BS doing this - a company should have a team that either automates or has a full on script to things that should be tested/checked on each and every iteration of a game before it hits the streets...
---
The fact that we as customers have to do any of this for what is a company that has 32 years of experience in the business is rather sad and disappointing.  Its not our job - we pay for a finished working product - not some "it should have been released mid-2019" piece of dung this has become.  In the corporate world - if you released a product like this with this many issues and ones that reoccur when you release a new patch - you'd be out of business before anyone would take you seriously.
---
I actually agree. Have considered this as a possibility after seeing the irrational anger on this sub. They're plan is working. 
---
awww u better hang out with him
---
Could be? Unsure what Bethesda is planning 
---
Issue on PS4. When in Wendingo Cave, the game will freeze after shooting an enemy or entering the Pip-Boy.
---
Yeah maybe it's just the perk sets that really make it seem off to me. I'm fine with there being some "best" endgame weapons, but right now it seems that perks will trick you into building for weapons that just aren't usable.
---
I started taking pistol perks right before I started fighting scorchbeasts, and soon realized that all of those perk investment was wasted because pistols are just SO bad. And I pity the poor souls that invest 9 points into trying to make auto-pistols good...
---
It needs an update not another modification. Skyrim should have been released on a new engine they could have used for the next 10 years. 
---
which is why its 40% instead of 80% making melee still more effective 
---
also you forgot drop off damage / ammo / repair cost / weight that ammo and rifles have different from melee that balances the rest 
---
This is where I'm at as well. I dont have much time to play and I only have my one character which uses launchers &amp; grenades primarily and a melee for when things get too close so I dont 'splode.
---
Tested out the new damage doing some fusion core farming (turned on monongah and defended it for a few hours) and even my two shot fat man is kind of a joke now.
---
 Yeah its sort of easy to make a lot of ammo for one or the other w ammosmith &amp; super super when it comes to my 40mm or missiles but it just isnt worth the effort anymore. I'm not playing until this is fixed. What they did was lazy to address the TSE usage and not consider that people also use these perks legitimately for a build they like and have liked in previous titles.
---
The game will be perfect once everyone is running around in soiled underwear wielding a picket sign about how robots terk er jerbs.
---
Seems that filling a bottle give you 5 rads.
---
Once boiled drinking it give you an additional 5 rads.
---
So to make 1 boiled water and drinking it cost you 20 rads.
---
Not very efficient or even logical.
---
I want to play with my friends and not have to ask to shoot the mirelurk Queen, deathclaw, scorchedbeasy queen before they one tap it with their deathclaw gauntlets. 
---
They nerfed caps stashes this patch so good luck on that. That was basically all I did before I just gave up. playing FO3 now and forgot how superior those games are.
---
To be honest, I don't really count this as an mmo. Servers are locked to like 30 people instances, so my comparisons are toward like, STALKER, nether, Dayz, etc...
---
With that in mind, I'd say fo76 was fairly decent to play. The lack of damage outputs on energy weapons irritates, but it's still a solid survival-lite.
---
Idk, it just threw me off when you compared it to wow and ffxiv. Their target audiences are so vaslty different that using that as ammunition to call people playing the game lacking of standards got a big no from me, chief. 
---
Definitely a meme of a post
---
Hold on... after all that shit you want to work for Bethesda, for free? Wow, you guys are beyond stupid.
---
Okay so you'd like beta servers from where any progress won't carry on. But I doubt most people want that.
---
Try to pvp melee before you suggest a nerf. 
---
Theres no gap closer bro. I died so much before this patch. 
---
Ranged shouldn't be a 1 shot. Melee needs to be a 1 shot. 
---
How many times can you shoot me while i sprint at you in an open field?
---
They will eventually nerf everything because online gaming communities never stop crying 
---
where did you get your TSE drop?
---
I'm not trying to start a fight, I'm just giving the most reasonable explanation why this guy isnt gettting help. If your boss asks you to stop pooping in the womens restroom because now the women are uncomfortable, and you keep doing it, you might get in trouble, HR might get involved. 
---
I didn’t say shut it down forever, I said fix the game then reopen PvP.
---
Or they could pull the whole game offline.
---
PVP-ready players are sadly the minority in this game. They should fix what the most people are interested in first.
---
They abandoned the PVE community.
---
No, I'm not. The equation is used to find the multiplier that you apply on the damage of the weapon, after calculating damage resist.
---
An AA version of a 100 dmg weapon does 100 dmg.
---
A TS version of a 100 dmg weapon does 125 dmg.
---
So after calculations, you apply the .51 multiplier to the 100 dmg for AA, and the .43 multiplier to the 125 dmg for TS.
---
Hey there’s a guy 2 inches off center of my screen to the left let swing in a wide arc and pass thro them and miss
---
That lied through their teeth to get it out the door.
---
Could be the greatest game on earth now and I still wouldn't touch it. You don't validate shitty business practices.
---
Since they didnt put it in the patch notes im figuring that it was unintentional, though it wouldnt be the first time they left stuff out of the patch notes. But why would you add such a ridiculous extra step of tedium to your game on purpose? I hope they fix it quick
---
Now this I stand behind. NPCs would kinda be dope. Raids even. Stuff that will continue to pull us back in. I’m sure it’ll get there eventually.
---
Most of the tears are about the nerf.  They're not going to revert that.
---
I'm still waiting till its free or 5-15 dollars.  I've got too much to do in gaming at the moment anyway steady stream of stuff coming out I can wait till this game is close to finished being updated and play it like a Solo game, non of my friends wanted to play it so rip me. 
---
Witcher 3, Divinity Original Sin 2, Rimworld, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, FONV, FO4, Borderlands 1 and 2, Bioshock 1, 2, and Infinite
---
I dont mind those tbh. Its part of the survival experience 
---
Exactly. Idk why there is this ridiculous war between either making them completely useless or implementing no nerfs at all. There is a medium.
---
I mean not that they add anything that’s worth buying unless you are into the princess beds. I think they could monetize with so much better quality stuff than Gronak costumes and silly stuff. Power armor paint and weapons skins but yet they release them once in a blue moon. 
---
Now you just need to get a duped set of assassin's cavalier armor and finally you will be king OP.
---
Hate to break it to you but all decisions are made at a subconscious level. Our conscious minds then rationalize a reason for it.
---
Google subconscious decison. There is a lot of scientific research on it.
---
No doubt.
---
Wait until the TSE guys are getting one shots from bloodied melee builds rushing them with Assassin's Cavalier armor.
---
It's almost as if the whole TSE nerf was a diabolical plan cooked up by melee players so they could take over the world.
---
RD online is in a Beta stage and I play it all the time. The glitches are minor and go away after a few minutes. Haven’t played 76 though so I can’t compare but at the same time I’m glad I didn’t get 76
---
I lost a couple hundred 5.56 to feed the people yesterday :(
---
Agreed, I had a much higher level player flag me down in the middle of AVR Med center this week.  He kept following me and I felt like he was baiting me to PVP.  Then he IMd me and asked if I want some loot.  He dropped a bag with some super stims and other chems.
---
It was a really cool moment.
---
The dev rep did hint at that in one of the comments in the patch notes thread 
---
I agree with you.
---
A stealth stealth need?
---
Prior to the last patch it was possible to stack bobbleheads (at least the explosive ones) to gain huge damage buffs.  There was also an exploit that was patched that if you used the Curator perk, which extended bobbleheads usage to 2 hours instead of 1, and you logged off between 59 to 0 minutes remaining on the effect and logged back in, the buff reset to 2 hours.  Thus, you could stack 1,000 duped bobble heads AND have them last indefinitely.
---
But i never hit him so he one shot melee while dealing reduced damage.
---
You are holding a live service multiplayer game to the same criteria as a single player RPG experience. If Bethesda wanted a cash-for-time exchange they should have just made Fallout 5 and not gone exploring a new game ecosystem.
---
Once you stop it’s hard to play again, even with friends it feels empty and I constantly find myself looking at my phone. I can’t justify it anymore it’s a shit game and even with little expectations it finds a way to be a letdown.
---
Okay, I've been thinking about this. Here's the conclusion I came up to: I think Bethesda thought that they would punish people for being jerks by giving them bounties. But what they didn't expect is that two people could be jerks and collect each other's bounties. Henceforth, Greifers. The jerks outsmarted the developers. That's what I think happened.
---
Not retail. I'm kind of viewing it like No Man's Sky except they're quicker to fix things. Waiting until we see some new content before saying it's truly awful, ha
---
But when English is used to describe mathematics, it needs to be exact and precise.  Without good understanding of mathematics and the ability to describe it precisely, you would say questionable things like, "Half the class perform below average," or "80% of survivors in plane crashes read the safety rules."
---
(P.S.  On that last example, the fallacy is that 100% of those who died in plane crashes might have read the safety rules too, but they weren't alive to tell you about it.  So that makes it a bad mathematical claim.  In other words, it is possible that those who read safety rules and still died probably outnumber those who read them and survived.  Not the thing you would want to promote.)
---
Besides, melee hits hard because we are willing to use bloodied.  Once range figures out bloodied shotguns drop the queen in 10 seconds they might stop bitching lol.  Ranged SHOULD be weaker than melee. I don't think it is though.
---
I dunno.
---
Two affixes being on par with 30 perk points was rediculous.
---
3pts gets you 20% more damage. Tse got you 200% more damage
---
This is basically the opposite of a circlejerk.... you... need some schoolin'
---
Totally agree.  I want new  content tbh or boredom will kicking in soon. 
---
Totaly. All this sistems are obsolete and only make the game more annoying. I would have preffered harder combat, than fucking looking for damn screws and lead 20% of the time because all my weapons are constantly broken and I am out of ammo. And fucking managing my inventory for half an hour every game session, oh my god. Fuck. This.
---
It was running smoother and loadimg quicker. I seen about 5 people on my server lastnight. 
---
I have my ammosmith perk maxed out. Are you saying this converting of Ammo is working now or you would like it to work?
---
Is that the one where, when making/fixing a weapon it gives much better durability? 
---
I know I'm going to start replaying Farcry 5 right now in co-op. My play time in Fallout is basically going to be 0 since I'm at level 131 and getting bored with the game.
---
As a counterpoint, I seemed to be able to be less noticed while stealthed last night. I was able to take out large groups without being noticed using a silenced combat rifle. They would take shot after shot and just keep walking, their friends wouldn't react to the death. 
---
Though once noticed, "evasive" didn't seem to work as well.
---
Even with bobble heads stacked damage you can’t one hit someone in passive. This has been proven multiple times on here and YouTube. Slap Damage is capped. If your teammate flags for pvp it also flags you,. You can't be one hit unless you are flagged for pvp. Even at half health.
---
They jacked up prices on recipes (and destroyed the recipe trading market pretty much entirely) in an attempt to make caps relevant again in the player economy. Even though it's only a temporary measure as the second wave of completionists attempt to fill their plan/recipe lists with the previously fairly unwanted caps. Doing this at the same time as nerfing the previous stock trade item, TSEs, amplifies the effect.   
---
There will be a LOT of caps being traded over the next week or so, and a huge spike in caps leaving the player base and going into vendors. Spending the caps and emptying their (previously always hovering around 25k) balance means they'll be selling anything but top teir trade fodder for caps instead of holding onto them.   
---
A brief re-invigoration of the player economy before it sinks back lower than it was before. The TSEs worth only a faction of what they were prevously, and most recipes worth less than what you now can buy them for. No going out of your way to check a vendor for a cali shock or jetpack, no point now.  
---
So my tin-foil-hat theory is that it was short-termism to make things look good on paper for a brief period, even if the long term effects are a lot worse than doing nothing. Who cares about long term effects these days though,...
---
Yeah, legendaries were awesome in legion but I'm talking about raid tier sets - where you got a unique class bonus for having 2 &amp; 4 of the pieces. Most of them fundamentally changed the way you played your class, they gave me goals to grind for and felt like a massive reward for achieving.
---
All they would have to do is have marsupial and run and jump around until the melee person either stopped running for a moment or ran out of AP
---
Eh everybody knows about this game by now so if you bought it recently and we're disappointed your a little silly 
---
See that's what I thought too! I burned through 5 last night in a few hours just in doing normal material gathering
---
Whatever is going on with them, it will sure make an interesting E3
---
Random anonymous comments from individual people don't "prove" anything nor does it reflect on "this community".
---
Is this all you do, chirp around what others have already said all day?
---
You’d think a parrot would have an original thought at least once a day
---
Or Pete Hines disappearing from twitter.
---
Running at the SBQ with a limp noodle is "viable" 
---
The ~~fix~~ workaround is to plug in a headset-- you don't have to USE it... just plug it in.
---
At least it works for me, but I'd like to not have to have a headset plugged in all the time.
---
This. I think the game’s fun BECAUSE it’s a buggy mess and will probably stay that way. This whole sub turned into a “Fuck Bethesda” party when honestly the game is miles better than it was at launch. People just need to be more honest with themselves; If you don’t like it, don’t play it. There’s thousands of other games out there, you’re not gonna hurt Bethesda’s “feelings” by not liking their game.
---
No TSE absolutely never one shot anything above level 30. I ran a low powered one to avoid that. So the nerf made my only good gun worthless 
---
If thats what they use to stop duping it's a sacrifice I would be ok with. Ultimately no crashing would be nice.
---
indeed, and i can respec and i probably will. But then, I'm not offering anything back to the community which i love. I've met some amazing people through modding their Radiums and had a blast with them, done deals with hardcore pvpers who were being attacked as we traded a radium rifle, found other weirdos like me who cannot explain why they love this gun and been given wonderful gifts for helping "well of" players get their gun to it's best state. It's been super fun, but alas, potentially all for naught!
---
Oblivion. Loved all the cool relics you could get from the gods. Wabbajack!!!
---
I feel the same really. It's quite telling how just about every post in this sub isn't talking about what's going on in the game or where to find things... It's all about suggestions to make the game better, things to add, quality of life improvements, and ideas for additional content or balance suggestions. Kind of realized this the other day after the patch dropped. Rather sad that instead of talking about the game 85% of people are saying what the game should have to make it better... I'm done for a while or until they make weapons other than melee viable as well as include an endgame that doesn't revolve around rng on top of rng so you can rng some more. 
---
Ppl should expect it tbh.
---
Either they buffed whey enemy to be bullet sponges or nerf things down.
---
1 shots is not intended and isn't viable long term.
---
Any gamer knows this.
---
No problem it’s super good! Make sure you get all of the choices though 
---
Bandersnatch didn't have any Beta... seems that might have been a better option.  Oh right Christmas deadline... ***facepalm***
---
I preordered it for $80 buck and it was $40 the next week...what are you talking about? The game wasn’t worth my money.
---
Thank you! That is quite annoying, but I guess it does the job
---
How does one achieve that damage?
---
Most posts are people 'quitting' and trying to convince others to go along with it to "send a message" except that won't happen
---
The plans for it at the grafton vendor, or just some lever actions lying about?
---
&gt;but if you’re not happy wait until it’s at a point where it’s polished
---
Wow, people must be so entitled to be mad that they are being told, after paying for something, that if they aren't happy with the sorry state of it they just need to chill out and wait.
---
It looks like they built the latest patch on an old code base so stuff that was fixed, is now broken again.
---
I unbulked all my things when I noticed this happening, and now I'm stuck carrying so much junk because I can no longer distinguish the stuff I was keeping for materials from what I was supposed to go sell. Besides the fact that, yknow, now all my sell junk is useless because I can't sell it.
---
I could also swear my VATS hits aren't counting toward my criticals unless I shoot slower. What's the point of using an automatic weapon if I have to shoot one bullet at a time to get my critical. meter filled?
---
I'm still playing because I love it and I'm having fun, but... God. 
---
To add on: either put Demo Expert back as it was, or make it a 3 point perk card like the others.
---
It’s dying time for FO76. They had a chance to do right in this patch and punted. No one will wait until March for new content. 
---
turn around then
---
Just a bit of Devil's Advocate here... Demo Expert : You're getting 60% damage increase with 5 perk points (1 card - 5 levels)... the same 60% increase other weapons (pistol, rifle, shotgun...) gets with 9 perk points (3 cards - 3 levels each). 
---
I drop a legendary, get a screwdriver. Drop a regular ghoul, get a legendary 2* ripper. Issa mess.
---
Yea I have a melee build and its op but I want a variety in the player builds not just melee. In a sense I want a lot of good builds.
---
Probably patched it because I noticed it to
---
If they run pacifist that doesn't work
---
It was something about the split PMCs and community that really drove it. It was fun trash talking the other PMCs on proxy chat. A lot of the people also ended up feeling loyalty to one PMC which made it have that family feel between other members.
---
Still to this day me and other VALOR guys get along great. But if I meet any SVER guys, we joke calling each other scum but then laugh it off since its mostly in past lol
---
You and Bethseda need to reexamine yourselves.
---
That exactly word by word my situation. See you on the WWII !!
---
I'm not trying to criticize but you're saying piss off everyone who paid full price? Then abandon the game on PC and leave consoles to deal with patches?
---
Lol, yeah this happens to me too
---
this is absolutely right. if consumers don't fight back, then suppliers won't see an issue and will continue doing what works 
---
Thanks I’m so irked right now because of all this constant crap we get fed about how they “care what we think” they don’t care they just want to shut enough of us up so they can remake Skyrim for the new PlayStation portable coming out in 2021. 
---
I'd sure like to award you for this post but no currency. I completely agree for what good it's worth
---
I was kind of focusing on PvE balance. PvP issues are that player health pools are so incredibly small compared to damage numbers. I don't think any build should be killing people 1 hit. That's just bad design. PvP just needs a flat % damage reduction so that it's not over instantly.
---
I find I have no issue in PvP with my melee build. Though that's probably a lot due to a lot of really bad players.
---
The devs are at fault for lacking the attention to detail, to make patch amendments to the new code! 
---
This patch uses old code! Which is why somen of the old patched bugs are back, like fusion cores, bobbypin weight anf allegedly some duping methods. 
---
A guy was selling several hundred travelling leather jackets on xbox! Ridiculous! 
---
Lever gun plans in Grafton station. Handmade plans in Harper's Ferry.
---
Since the update the vendors show all plans you can buy (some are levelled so they won't appear if you aren't high enough). But they cost quite a bit now. 
---
As far as I know they can still drop as rewards, patrol duty for handmade, not sure about lever though.
---
Yeah. I need to know. 
---
I forgot to mention his sister. The nightmare of raising 2 puppies is offset by the ability to sit back and let them play with each other.
---
My only job is to make sure they don't find a way out of the yard.
---
It worked on my buddy when were testing this but either way not a ton of high levels run around in pacifist except in nuke zones.
---
Exploring is really great at first.  But after about 20 hours you start to notice patterns.  It's not as diverse as you'd hope; but it's a video game and not actually capable of the diversity we'd get from irl space exploration.  Mass Effect had a similar problem, and it was much smaller of a universe.  The star systems are plentiful and you can easily get lost in the map trying to find where you were (such as travelling through a black hole).  So it's massive in scope and size, but with that comes procedual "maps" and they do get repeated and you definitely notice patterns after a while.
---
If you are on the fence, get it during a sale.  You absolutely won't be disappointed for 20 bucks.  I bought it at release, played for a week and shelved it for a year and a half.  I now have 200 hours in it, so for 60 bucks I am not complaining.
---
And, if you still aren't sure, there is always watching streams to get a preview of how it plays.  Cheers man!
---
Yeah i noticed that too. Maybe the bug never was gone because most people were killing enemies with one shot LOL
---
I take some issue with calling it a "project". A game that you play $60 for should come with certain standards of playability. It's not a project. It's a full game that should have never made it to release with issues that are still plaguing it since launch.  
---
I wonder if we will get it tomorrow maybe with the Inside the Vault?
---
But real talk they do feel overpowered. I have no melee perks at all, but I always end up using heavy attacks on a melee weapon because it's better than all my guns.
---
Yup, we should all play pipe rifles and pool sticks, that's how the game should be intended.
---
With melee you don’t kill a whole area of enemies that other people are trying to tag for loot and xp. Also with melee you can dodge it and see the attacks coming in pvp. However with TSE weapons there is nothing you can do, you cannot dodge it or see it coming. 
---
Its the plans, thats where I got mine so I could build and scrap for the mods. 
---
Damn entitled people paying $60 AAA premium price for a game and expecting a certain level of AAA quality.
---
Wish I could find these too. Another example of patch notes being incomplete, leaving players in the lurch.
---
Were you on a team or owned a workshop?
---
Could have sworn I saw one like 5 hours ago /shrug
---
I was getting down voted to hell for posting this exact type of thread a month ago. Glad to see everyone is finally waking up to the fact that this game is such a dumpster fire.
---
Double the Atoms and make challenges based on what is being tested.
---
Can't believe people don't remember how it was like after Oblivion released and any post on their forum criticizing Todd's lies on the forums was deleted. Todd's dishonesty was one of the first big memes in my opinion. He would claim that features were in Oblivion that weren't added until Skyrim
---
They have more perks in general, but unyielding/radicool builds, serums, etc effect melee stats.
---
I'll have you know, it takes MULTIPLE hours of work to migrate all-ready existing resources.   
---
MULTIPLE.
---
oh and i forgot to say, much like your west tek story, my friend who is 80 (Eighty) levels below me was one shotting the mobs in Uranium Fever with a Powerfist and basically saving my arse from an even more embarrassing outcome haha
---
Interesting. Thanks for contributing to the conversation! Counterpoints are good
---
I usually do lay pc games so I just didn’t have the skills to do this. So here is my easy trick: Marsupial mutation. You can jump right through the waypoint diamond markers. Fall off the beam? No problem. Hop up past that diamond. 
---
Easiest way to get marsupial is to buy it from a player who has learned how to craft it. You can find a bunch of crafters on the 76 market and bazaar sub-Reddits. Or start drinking toxic water. 
---
Yeah, I hear ya. I had some basic mods on the first week. I mean we shouldn't even need Better Inventory to see stacked weight for things. How can we manage inventory when we can't tell what takes up the most carry weight? I mean I guess I should just be better at math.
---
I suggest you get a better rifle.  Mine isn't great but still does ~250 damage.  I kill most anything from range in 1 to 3 shots to the body/head, except scorchbeasts of course.
---
One of the best suggestions I've seen so far in r/fo76. Even the best QA team is never going to be able to find as many issues as even a limited subset of the player base, in a game this large, dynamic, and with such a variety of gameplay mechanics and character builds.
---
2 words, Game Changer.
---
 Sure hope that’s sarcastic
---
A rare spawn event in the Penitentiary on the south side of Toxic Valley.
---
Now if we could get the whiners and quitters to stop posting we could enjoy this subreddit again.
---
&gt;which is a revenue generator
---
is it really though? I've seen hardly anything worth "buying" in the atom shop, and what few items it was, I had plenty of challenge quest atoms for the "purchase". 
---
I get the idea behind the atom shop, but I have a hard time believing that what they're filling it with is actually driving real money atom sales.
---
I mean that just proves my lint more that not a lot of man power is being put into the atom store
---
People don't like to talk about that one. It was a different studio. But regardless it's clear Bethesda DID listen to the feedback from the release of ESO because 76 isn't a game with cooldown rotations and other MMO bunk
---
***YOU CAN FIRE ME, I QUIT MOTHERFUCKER.***
---
Claiming that everything should be the same % for "balance" doesn't prove the point I think you're trying to make.
---
Blindly applying a false sense of equality does not lead to equity.
---
To put it more plainly; PA has a higher durability than non PA... It degrades slower. The 60% increase in that degradation time is just as powerful (if not more powerful) as a 90% decrease for Non PA given the disparity between the durability of the two armor types.
---
That's not even taking into account how much cheaper the material costs are when you eventually have to repair power armor. 
---
I don't disagree with the disparate durability values of the armor types, but acting like White Knight was somehow unbalanced bc it didn't have the same % of Power Patcher is myopic. 
---
You know communications goes a long way. Seeing faces goes a long way. Hearing genuine words spoken goes a long way. Instead people are left in the dark, howling at the moon. Canned responses from "support". Nerf sledgehammer comes down wrecking our time and patience. Taking our toys. Taking our fun. This is our interaction. This is our reaction.
---
Yes we all know, and any weapons that would still have both of them would mostly been gone in 6 moths if they did that. 
---
Legendary nerf is not new. I complained about this  weeks ago and got down voted to hell.  Seems a lot of people spent a long time in denial and are only now waking up to the truth of how fucked up this game is. 
---
Bye.
---
I see many people are giving up.  I bet those people that love to play solo will be happy 
---
It's an important consideration if you want this game to stick around.
---
Someone is likely thinking or going to say that it's just people on the sub that are talking about leaving, but 2/3 players on PS4 have never hit level 25 and we're approaching three months into the game. That number hasn't been changing, which I'd argue is reasonable evidence that a lot of people dropped this game early and aren't just casuals taking it very slow. That could also be a positive thing in the long run - the majority of buyers who dropped the game before hitting level 25 could conceivably be lured back. But there needs to be a clear message about where the game is going for that to happen.
---
I bet he wasn't using it as an automatic, and he was using All Rise when the SBQ landed. That right there is the difference in ammo.
---
As a full on stealth sniper build I usually use around 600-800 ammo for a 10 minute queen fight, so his number is not out of line if he switches to melee when she's on the ground.
---
Yeah that one befuddles me. A friend and I cleared everything we could find in Whitespring, then server hopped and repeated TWICE. At the end of that he had 8 golfers and I had 6. 
---
I gave up on it too, hopeless game at this point
---
cool, thanks!
---
It was never possible to used stacked bobbles to one hit passive players. There are videos proving it didn’t work. More than likely you somehow initiated pvp and didn’t realize it. 
---
I'm convinced 98% of these people aren't happy unless they're bitching about something... and quite possibly are too used to near instant gratification. 
---
I'm happy with the changes... and Bobby pin weight? Seriously? LoL!!!
---
The NMS and  FO76 launches are almost identical imho
---
Can I has your stuff?
---
This community is AMAZING. I hope we can all play together again soon.
---
Literally the only good thing twitter is good for.   
---
at least we have a good enough sense of humour to laugh at ourselves!
---
To answer your question, the shortest barrel has the highest DPS. I don’t know about base stats, but I had a two shot minigun and with the standard barrels, short barrels, and trucks-barrels, it did 46 damage, 48 damage, and 50 damage respectively. 
---
Although the tri-barrel has two more damage, the rate of fire is almost half of the short barrel. 
---
You should find all the threads about from weeks ago and call them liars then
---
They inadvertently gave them an advantage.  They have mules with hundreds of thousands of duped nukas and just got instant access to every plan in the game.
---
damage mitigation works heavily against smaller caliber rounds though since 250 armor will eat 90% of a minigun but only 35% of a gatling gun cause it has more damage bypass it per shot
---
Say it ain't so.
---
Yeah, I've hit a stale point in the game and I have not touched it for a week or two. I keep coming to the forum to read about patches and looking for when the new content will drop. 
---
Moving onto other games for the time being. Got a backlog unfortunately.... balancing adulting and games is hard.
---
 Still love the game and hope (fingers crossed) it gets better. 
---
Wut? Are you leaving? Bye
---
To be fair, I got a 403 error when I tried to look at the atom shop a couple days ago.
---
You need to put it in your inventory and scrap it like you would scrap junk.
---
You just keep buying form the shop baby girl.
---
What happened to the competent game developer that stood behind the game and took pride in it, instead we get what will offend people less games, that are watered down, with no incentive for a game company to make something good, other then profits.
---
It's an event up at the penitentiary just west of Grafton Dam. It should trigger as you get to the main door. If it doesn't, change servers till it does. Completing it awards plans, handmade is one of the ones it can drop.
---
Keep an eye on the map too, it won't show up normally but if someone is doing it it will show up. That's how I got my plans for it, someone was doing it, I joined and got the plans 1st try (I was lucky though, more so the fact I actually joined just as it finished!).
---
I’m happy paying higher prices if that means I don’t have to server hop or constantly search containers.
---
They only fixed the explosive bobbleheads, not the melee one
---
food and drinks are everywhere and crafting disease cures is extremely easy
---
Maybe, but would you ever expect to craft more than 2?
---
Lolz I’m here for the comments.
---
Thanks for the laffs 
---
Controversial Opinion: I like this game. They made a bad update. They’ll probably fix it in a week. I hope they don’t do this again, but besides this crap update, it’s a pretty damn good game.
---
I’m level 57 so I’ve put roughly dozens of hours into and made my monies worth. I can bet most of you have done the same so obviously we’ve all found something to enjoy.
---
Ants are strong though...  like no joke.
---
None. They're different beasts, and both those games are campaign driven. If Fallout 76 fails it'll be because of its own mistakes. I still have hope though, even after I got mad that they broke the game again. It's not that big of a deal when I stop to think about it. 
---
When you put it in the context of that the decisions are being made by the same people who tried to pass off nylon bags and plastic covered bottom shelf rum as quality Fallout Merchandise then it makes perfect sense.
---
&gt; Used less than 1000 rounds each time
---
then you were getting carried,i used to use 1.5k-2k ultracite bullets with a tse automatic handmade that dealt 1k dmg per shot 
---
the ammo costs pre nerf were pretty bad now its even worse
---
Its our duty to bare witness to the great exodus. As some more of our fragile members of the community go off in to the west. https://youtu.be/UoVaK2NXmJA
---
True, there are a number of posts attacking the dev team. As far as there not being any helpful information, there is a thread on the patch notes. Inside there a ton of people are providing lists of bugs, failures and other issues - in a proactive manner. In my personal opinion, I dont care if the game has a few bugs (it's almost expected with open MMO type games now), I do epect that the development team listens and makes the appropriate changes based on community feedback.
---
I've got a couple hundred hours into this game so far. Until the patch yesterday, I was happy to overlook some of the more buggy features. After this update, the game is beyone frustrating. To be completley honest, the majority of the gameplay for me and a few of my friends was pretty bland as it is (finished all content available). I've had more fun moving and rebuilding my base for the past few weeks than actually doing things (like nuking the same two spots over and over). I kind of enjoy the nerf to TSE weapons, kind of. The feel that the enemies have a bit more of an edge brings back some of the ecitement.
---
Having to work through my junk pile for 5 minutes to scrap bulk, then repair mye shit, then rebulk to maintain storage space is unacceptable. Reverting weights on certian items back to pre-patch weights and increasing weights on others is also unacceptable. Honestly, I would rather have dupers back in the environment and have the team fix the game play issues than have them focus on making the game more tedious and frustrating.
---
If they took the time to check the patch before launching, and looked at the community feedback on the patch notes sub threads, they wouldn't have ahlf of these issues. Dedicate appropriate resources to fix this game and give us our money's worth.
---
Exactly LOL
---
But of course not, there's no way they can get a friendly interview so they're not going to go out and offer themselves up. They know every question is going to be about the dumpster fire that is FO76, how it happened, how Todd Howard could have been so wrong in his characterizations of the game, why the game continues to be a dumpster fire, and what the hell they're doing to get things back on track.
---
They don't want to answer those questions. And while I'm not trying to defend them here because *somebody* in Bethesda leadership needs to come out and start talking...can you blame them?
---
Oh no I don’t use TSE, but I have had a legendary 2 shot Gatling gun without explosive, this was allowing me to actually kill enemies at high level with my heavy guns build, as other heavy guns are horrible. Now it only does +25% increased damage which is ok, but it doesn’t make the build that I’ve worked for weeks for, feel powerful, which I should do at level 120. 
---
One day I logged off, and never got on again
---
&gt;Our conscious minds than rationalize a reason for it
---
That doesn't mean you're incapable of taking a step back and examining your feelings and decisions based on logical reasoning.
---
It's called critical thinking. It's when you don't immediately follow your gut reaction.
---
Please, enlighten me further on the intricacies of observations. 
---
Ya'll are way too dramatic, just play something else if you'd had enough.
---
Gee, I wonder why...
---
Plot twist!
---
He's exploiting the melee bobblehead stacking. Bethesda only fixed explosives, not melee, so the one shots that way are still possible 
---
Lol this subreddit and this post is a circlejerk. If you don't see it as a circlejerk then you're **part** of the circlejerk
---
Man, how f'd up is Bethesda as not even a company but as human beings for not even sending a team to help with this. They're leaving their own coworkers and employees out to hang. You know this studio will be eventually canned too cause of this. A complete setup for failure from the start.
---
I guarantee Starfield and ElderScroll6 will both be screwed by this as their employees see how this goes and knows the company doesn't have their back.
---
&gt; Find a place with a lot of those can chimes and disarm them for a bunch of lead. 
---
Camden park has a bunch of can chimes
---
You just don’t know how to play. When I group with someone we split up. You can get through more locations faster. 
---
No, it may have been a programming issue. I can unequivocally say that I was able to do so up until  this past weekend with no issues, except the scorched I ran into.
---
Others are reporting that the area is very small and very specific.  Another user just posted that they hand to stand under the gas sign to get it to count.
---
He will be back. Most of these people will be back LOL. Just like people keep buying EA shit, they’ll be back. And anyway at least this isn’t an EA game.
---
It shouldn't be.   Diablo is like that which is why you do 100 billion damage.  It shouldn't be too hard to test with perk cards and please message me if im wrong.
---
The photos worked for me at Flatwoods and Tea Pot, but I had to take several from different positions so the image has the entire building and the label on top is also readable. Have not tried other locations yet.
---
Picking flowers didn't work for me either though.
---
Agreed. Why should melee be the only weapon class that gets a damage boost just from your special stat?
---
Does he stream on twitch still, dude was putting in the hours like he had nothing better to do lol  
---
Gg
---
I’ve never seen someone one tap a mirelurk Queen with melee and I have seen some pretty busted builds. Granted you can shred it pretty quickly, but I’m sure you’d love to shred a mirelurk Queen like that, or would you rather spend 300 shots on it
---
 Bye
---
You don’t *have* to do anything. It’s a game, play the way you want. Just because melee is better (for now) doesn’t mean you should choose that.
---
So many people flock to the “flavor of the month” build in online games because they’re “better”, then they get nerfed. Better just to pick something you like to do instead of trying to chase the next top build. 
---
Melee will be the next thing to get nerfed because everyone is saying how it’s the only powerful build now. Then maybe everything will be balanced and they can focus on new content instead of chasing balances for all eternity 
---
Nope. A circlejerk is a bunch of people beating the same dead horse over and over and not providing any new relevant points.
---
For example:
---
Making a post saying you don't like a video game and that you're quitting playing it.
---
I have loved the whole fallout franchise, and this community has been amazing. I hate to say it, but after 170 levels I can say that you're grinding right into an endgame of more grinding and a final boss of server instability and build nerfs. There's nothing at the end of the game, it's a staircase to nowhere, with no end in sight. 
---
This feels like a worse version of what happened to destiny. People calling for nerfs because one weapon is stronger then the other the that weapon gets nerfed from the top then they got nothing better to do then complain about the next best weapon and it gets nerfed then so on till eventually everything is nerfed equally then they got nothing better to do but complain that a weapon they got nerfed is to weak then they buff it back and the ladder keeps going. Exactly what’s gonna happen here but the nerds are gonna hit like a semi ramming thro a daycare center.
---
Ahhaaha I been waiting for this post lol.  Ahhaahhaha.  It's so fucking true lol. Meanwhile people get one shot by bloodied weapons and think it's a TSE.  XD I mean how do they know this weapon that one shot them was two shot?  I call bs on this whole community lol
---
Nope, I play solo and am leaving until they fix the damage bug they reintroduced. I'm not going to waste time and effort committing to anything in the game when at any point my weapons can become completely useless until I leave the server and abandon whatever I was working on. Having somebody to play with would actually be better since at least it's less likely for two people to both get the bug in the same nuke zone etc
---
Gg 
---
WP 
---
I'd just play Warframe if I were you, unless you really want to experience a repeat of FO76.
---
I do it every chance I get - at the expense of plastic. I don't have the bulk list that actually reduces weight memorized, but by bulking everything it gives me an easier pool to grab from to see what I have in mass abundance to sell off, and for the minor xp boost. 
---
I haven't placed since the new update but hearing that I need to scrap these sounds awfully tedious. 
---
Ants are actually really strong for some reason.
---
Get a PC. I don't have any of those problems.
---
That is the Excavator PA bug, with the RW bug. It applies the 100 weight, logging in with it equipped ads another 100 and the RW makes it 1.5x, giving you 300 lbs of free stuff.
---
&gt; So much to explore.
---
Got to disagree. There is a lot of space to explore, but nothing to find. Planets aren't all that interesting. They're all so...lifeless. 
---
Post how this person got this.
---
I have all the relevant perks, except solar powered and adrenaline rush. I have the mutations. I run at 15/20% health. I have 4 Unyielding armors on.
---
My bloodied sledge and or bloodied power fist barely break 1k damage.
---
Even if I got 1 more unyielding, solar power and AR, there is ZERO chance I get to 10k damage. INCLUDING any drugs or alcohol.
---
I'm calling straight up bullshit on this unless you show me video proof of someone achieving this.
---
I'm calling bullshit. 
---
Devann your words still matter man. Those of us that know the reach of a CM know none of this has much to do with ya. If anything your our voice to the otherside.
---
Even the most loyal of us are really really upset at the moment.  But we all want the game to thrive and do well. Just don't think the game and the community can handle much more of the ways things have been going. :(
---
Every time I log in, I have to pull out my adult coloring book and playdoh.
---
... thats bleak ... impressively bleak.
---
Definitely go commando. It's so freeing!
---
Oh... You meant auto weapons. Disregard.
---
Wrong
---
March is when they are saying we will get content.....I hope.
---
Agree! 400 players on a server, ok valid argument. 20 players, your code sucks balls.
---
This is exactly the reason guns need a buff, especially heavies. There’s no reason why a level 50 fully modded minigun shouldn’t be able to kill scorched. But that’s where we are at the moment
---
The franchise isn’t dead. Even if 76 is a total write off, all the other games are still playable, and there’s the potential for more titles in the future. Don’t be so dramatic, it’s embarrassing. 
---
Oh if that was only true.
---
I think this was Battlecry Studios’ final shot at making something profitable for Zenimax and Bethesda, Bethesda handed them the keys to the Fallout franchise to see what they could do with it, but they were destined for failure for the start trying to use a dated single player engine for an online game. So yes, I agree with you.
---
So, I was 20 something and he was 80 something and I should have fought back?  Good strat.  Glad I didn't think of it.
---
Anthem *fingers crossed*
---
My knife has done much less damage than it used too do, sucks 
---
the new game I play is hoping for new content and fixed patches
---
I am losing so far
---
In all honesty, I make a decent amount of caps just from selling bulked junk (and drugs). Base is on a copper deposit and smelting and bulking nets me a steady income of caps. Cousins base is on acid deposit. I'm not setting the world on fire but I usually have to hit 3 if not 4 stations every time I'm playing to keep stash amount down. Not that big of a deal, just hit the station before doing whatever I'm doing in that area.
---
My dismay isn't really with the lack of end-game content or the bugginess, per se. It's the incredible mismanagement--and the fundamental lack of respect for the consumer that Bethesda has demonstrated in releasing the game in the state they did, in responding to the game's many issues, in community management and relations. Every facet of it has been a trainwreck. 
---
I have shelved the game for the time being. I may even return to it at some point... but it's going to take more than patching the glaringly obvious bugs to restore my faith in Bethesda as a developer. 
---
mmmm well formatted post.... uuugghgghghghh
---
1. The uranium extractor won't place because there large, red, tanks are in the way. Throw a grenade in the hole, should clear things right up.  
---
2. Leaning slightly no on NPC's. We have robots, lore says everyone died or got infected, but mainly I don't want to deal with factions being pissed off when I steal their shit because I need plastic. It's bad enough that all of Whitesprings wants to eviscerate me after I saved them from Super Mutants but accidentally scratched the paint on one in the process. I don't more of that bullshit.  
---
3. Ugh, that bug. It can also cause a CTD. Hit escape twice to cycle your map to stop it as soon as you hear that \*boopboopboopboopboopboop\*  
---
4. I worry that once they start tinkering with power armor it'll start weighing more than 10lbs with pieces on it. Either by design or by screwing it up. They already need to fix the bug that allows you to carry high level parts at low levels. But yeah, I'd like to see naming for all equipment.  
---
5. Mmmm, Auction house. Have wanted a public auction house since before the game came out. Could be easily tied to vendor bots. Might be buggy for the first few months since I don't think the game is good at reading cross server other than loading a player file. Also not sure what you mean by logging into server groups to join friends, you can already log into servers with friends from the social menu.  
---
6. I believe more raids are coming. I do recall reading somewhere that data mined from the new vault stuff included text the insinuated the doors of the vault would seal shut and asked if everyone was inside. So we might see locked down areas with longer play, like actual raids you'd see in WoW. Would be nice to instance them, but again with the cross server reads and the bugging, and the crashy crashy that'll come with it.  
---
7. There's tons of modders on the in-game chat mod and we all use other mods and haven't gotten banned. There have been several discussion threads here about how all the banning was being blown out of proportion and included false statements from those claiming to be banned from non-cheating mods. If they are banning modders, the proof is very isolated to a couple of Youtube channels reporting and everyone quoting them.
---
mmmm auction house and long raids.... uuugghgghghghh
---
Interesting...I want to see the Fusion Flea car in action.
---
Just got back into For Honor and damn is it fun again with the items gone and new content almost regularly.
---
It really shows you how much 76 is lacking in comparison to other games, especially those that fucked up in the beginning like For Honor.
---
I don’t believe that most of the players that say they are quitting are actually quitting. I wish they would.
---
My only Fallout friend is already bored because he thought it was about leveling up and getting the best gear. He never looked into the lore, he doesn't explore. He just sprinted from place to place so that he'd be able to discover everything and fast travel whenever he wanted. But he doesn't go in anywhere unless it's for a quest. 
---
I had that attitude for the past few months, but now that the damage bug is back it feels like there's no point. I won't run a nuke silo and don't even want to do dungeons when at any point all of my effort can go to waste
---
I'm going to have to agree here.. still blowing things away, one shotting everything short of lvl 68 super mutants... glowing ones take 1.2 shots to mow down... you just HAVE TO AIM now... the aoe explosion damage is negligible, but actually hitting them does some good damage.  So, work on aiming if you cant kill anything with a TSE post patch.
---
But, I'm honestly enjoying being able to be swarmed by ghouls and not have to worry about blowing myself up, I can just keep shooting, driving my health slightly lower and increasing my adrenal reaction damage boost.
---
You could convert it to a tuxedo, and that gold thing into a tie!
---
The eye of ra could be a ring or something gender neutral.
---
keeps me calm from being d/c every 15 minutes
---
Todd has always embellished and lied about features prior to a release. He did this all the way back for Oblivion and probably Morrowind too
---
15 minutes? I disconnect every 5 seconds.
---
I used to heavily defend the game and I still love it a lot more than most people, but I think people can be frustrated at this point when a product they bought and want to work just doesnt. 
---
Let me give an analogy that fits my feelings. 
---
I buy a car expecting that car to run. 
---
The blinkers dont work, it stalls and putters out multiple times, and the doors dont lock.
---
I take it back to the dealership. They fix the blinker and locks, the car still stalls and now the air conditioning doesnt work, the radio is just static. 
---
Again it runs, so I try to deal with it. Meanwhile the dealership is selling decals and fuzzy dice and cosmetic items for the car non stop (atom shop)
---
They tell me to bring it back in to try and fix it again. This time they make the car drive slower, use more gas, but the ac and radio get fixed and now my blinkers dont work again. They also add car seat covers but ignore that the breaks are grinding. 
---
You get the idea. Eventually you are so frustrated that you just want to rant and give up and buy another car. 
---
Bethesda has this amazing opportunity to be able to listen to the community about this game. We understand it's their first venture with online gaming. Most people are understanding about disconnects and server issues and letting them figure those things out. But they are disregarding a lot of players with game changes that no one wants. 
---
I'm not talking about the tse nerfs. I think we all knew those needed to be changed somehow. This community gave so many good suggestions on how to balance that. But they ignored those and nerfed the guns to a useless state. 
---
They dont listen to the quality of life issues people have. And for everything they try to fix, they break 5 more things. 
---
I dont mind if people rant. It would be nice if it was in a couple specific threads and not the whole sub but I do understand. 
---
I just read two posts about fucking quitters and I’m glad to see that you’re still hanging on :) You, good sir, are the kind of player that makes the game fun 
---
To be fair to the OP there has been an incredibly vocal response to the nerf.  I know it's a huge deal the way they screwed up with this update but there are posts after posts soley complaining about the nerfs.
---
Remember the cartoons where the marsupial mutation gave kangaroo legs and a pouch. Hilarious and I wish the attention to detail for mutations was prioritized in this game.
---
You don't see the issue with using 3 times more ammunition to achieve the same effect? SBQ was annoying to do now its not even worth doing
---
Yess! And make the trunk act as increased stash capacity!
---
I'd call being able to jump twice as high a physical effect. 
---
I see what you mean though. I'd quite like to mutate like the little animation you get when you log in who has grown a third arm. That would come in so handy at times!
---
No it's not.  Not without adrenal reaction and maybe instigating or some other trait.   Also, why shouldn't it be stronger?  I got one shot in a legit pvp match from a mile away lol.  Why the shit should I have to close the distance AND do the same damage?  Makes no sense.  D&amp;D gets it. My greatsword gets D12 and your bow does not :P
---
That's a bit of an exaggeration 
---
I mean.. we need a player base, and I can’t say what most are saying are wrong about all the issues.. but we need to stay strong in this time of mourning
---
Think of it as something to do when you are on the phone with someone.  I play with friend who moved away a few years back, so i don't see often, and we play for hours, sometimes not even on the same server, and just chat while we play.  
---
May work on a few naïve people, but anyone who is even slightly familiar with PVP runs around in Pacifist, only choosing when they want to return fire.  Which is usually, right after they gear up, drug up, and then light you up.  Or they flip over to their low level because they are bored and want an extended fight.
---
It was like that for me until I maxed out the sneak perk. Before the patch I could usually get two to three shots off before even going into caution. Though to be fair I have a piece of chameleon armor and a piece of +stealth armor as well.
---
You couldn’t be further from the truth lol. 
---
This!  It's been a good month since I've played 76.  I'm extremely close to deleting all 500GB of this game.  
---
So, next step.... 
---
Interested in both RDR2 and AC.  Which one and why?
---
I've seen those youtube vids... I played the VIP demo and was actually encouraged by how bioware responded. They acknowledged the problem, fixed as much as they could quickly, and didn't hide their mistakes. Also, I've never had a problem with microtransactions as long as they're purely cosmetic, and can be bought with ingame currency as well. Anyone getting indignant about a skin they can get for imaginary coins you get for playing an enjoyable game is inventing drama. 
---
If you hit me once just know I'll shoot back as soon as the first hit connects
---
Finding a t51 jet pack plan and fringing flux and materials the  putting it on a torso then selling it, genius. 
---
I wouldn't definitely drive a Fusion Flea.
---
Ehhh the anthem problem had some big issues, but once I managed to actually get in the game itself was quite fun. Combat was enjoyable, and the flying really makes you feel like iron man.
---
If bioware gets the bugs ironed our for launch, and takes the stink people are raising about the skin prices to heart, then anthem could be great.
---
Wood armor.. believes what Abbie said..
---
I’ve been just building my camp in new areas and taking screenshots
---
Can’t lose exp if I don’t gain any
---
I didn't think this could possibly work out well until I played the Dying Light DLC.  It would be, to quote the 9th Doctor, "Fantastic!"
---
I meant cosmetic and you know, but yeah it would have been awesome!
---
I can try to get a clip if my friend hops on tonight. It’s actually sad how quickly that thing goes down. Please watch my clip at the bottom of this comment.
---
I don’t want to one shot everything, and I’m not sure why people assume that when I complain about how little damage guns are doing. Pre-patch, killing a mirelurk Queen by myself was challenging but doable if I played it smart. Now, i do hardly any damage to it, it’s probably about 50 shots with an explosive revolver, including sneak hits and criticals with all the critical damage increasing perks. 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/thejsavage/video/68370156
---
Two shot pump action, explosive western revolver.
---
I agree, I thoroughly enjoyed this quest. Especially finding the Veil of Secrets, storing it for a while without giving it a second thought, and then being pleasantly surprised once I finally got around to accessing the secret passageway. 
---
Good stuff. 
---
its sarcastic enthusiasm, he hates the game
---
okay dork
---
Not solo. Go left and send them right. Or something similar. Focus on clearing the location as fast as possible. That way the loot is split also. You can still chat via headsets 
---
A while back I reached a point where I could easily one-shot everything with melee without having to use stealth. However I was very 'squishy.' Since then I've been trying to perfect my build so that I am as tanky as I can get while still being able to one-shot enemies with melee. Currently, that comes in the form of an instigating sledge hammer, 5 pieces of sentinel armor, and a selection of the most useful damage output / damage reduction perks.
---
The day a powder blue Pick-R-Up with portable stash box and mini gun mount in the bed shows up in the Atom Shop will be a glorious day.
---
Okay 9 year old
---
dude my ps4 controller has been pickpocketing my doritos..
---
thanks todd 
---
&gt; it doesn’t make the build that I’ve worked for weeks for, feel powerful, which I should do at level 120. 
---
Well yeah you grew used to the level of damage you had. What you "feel" like doesn't matter though - two-shot shouldn't have doubled your damage. That means your 1* two-shot gun was better by a large margin than any most 2* and 3* legendary gatling guns that weren't also two-shot or explosive.
---
Like a mutant's + 10% damage while aiming 2* gun, that's only +21% damage for a combination of two legendary affixes.
---
Or maybe you really don't like Schorched so you use a Zealot's +10% damage while aiming... a whole +43% damage against Scorched.
---
He don't want to cuz he wants to hide in the bushes from 19 miles away and also do the same damage as melee and be invisible while doing so and get sneak attack bonus.  Oh wait....maybe his head is up his ass hmm...
---
I picked up ESO and started playing with a couple friends and I have no desire to return to FO76. It's just not a good game at it's core. I'd be happy to give it another shot of they turn stuff around but as time drags on I think that it's less and less likely I'll ever return.
---
Actually 10 bro, and I’m really smart for my age
---
You played with ridiculously overpowered weapons this whole time and now you can't handle not being overpowered so you rage quit? Nerfs are a part of literally every online game like this. You adapt or reroll. I have a lot of difficulty feeling bad for TSE users that have to start learning how to play.
---
is the flux reaaaly that much of a grind though. I mean I have 20 of  each just by stumbling through SBQ fights.
---
Plus, unbulking counts as scrapping junk for X, for the weekly challenge, if you care about that kind of thing.
---
I overreacted with this last update, but my outbursts are really because I can feel really big potential for the game. I'm just impatient, and this last update really made me worried that they aren't actually listening to us. I'm sure they are, or at least they will. 
---
I feel like with how shoddy the combat system is in Fallout/Oblivion games, adding pvp to that is just looking to cause painful, buggy bullshit battles of attrition.   This gun nerf, kind of thing that might seem good for pvp, but it kills the enjoyment of pve players.   These are mistakes other MMO devs have made decades ago.  You can't balance pvp and pve with the same set of numbers unless you homogenize everything to absolute simplicity like WoW has done.
---
The crashes weren't bad for me other than the servers going down once in a while. Other than that, the game ran pretty well for me. The only reason I stopped was like you said, not much content. I'll come back once they add more stuff to do. 
---
Better safe than sorry but I've used every one of my serums with starched genes on and I never had a problem. It doesn't hurt to remove the perk tough. If you're on PC I can craft you one for the cost of the flux.  
---
If you reloged and they're still not showing then it's safe to say it didn't work.
---
&gt; You’ve just effectively made it less rewarding for people who actively hunt for plans. 
---
Uh... what? I couldn't imagine a less rewarding system than what they had before the patch. 
---
Yeah, it's really rewarding to visit the Watoga vendor 500 times and seeing T60 jet pack plans  a grand total of zero times. 
---
That's not "rare." That's not difficult to obtain. 
---
That is basically non-existent and impossible to obtain. 
---
Don't tell me how easy it is to find someone who has the plans and  craft it for me if I have the caps. 
---
That hasn't been my experience at all. 
---
And if  it's so easy, then why aren't T60 and T51 jet packs a more common sight? 
---
In hundreds of hours of game play, I  have not seen a single player with a T60 or T51 jet pack.
---
I have not seen a youtube video with someone who has one.  So don't tell me how easy they are to get. 
---
And with this new patch, they STILL aren't easy to get.  It's over 5,000 caps and building it requires very rare materials. 
---
Yeah, I understand this. When I run low on fusion cores I have to devote most of a session to powering up a power plant, then doing a predetermined farm run for 50/100 fusion cores while I wait for the fusion core generator to give me a few fresh cores. Last time I had to do this I had a tremendous feeling of disdain for the game. I have to devote entire sessions to finding batteries, which I have a limited ability to stockpile due to the limitations on my stash box, so It's guaranteed that another core farming session is on the horizon. Meanwhile, since the game crashes and the server disconnects at least twice every time I play, I feel like I'm racing against the clock since I could disconnect at any time and lose the workshop that's making cores for me. 
---
I need a new game; here's hoping that anthem isn't as disappointing as 76. 
---
Ok, bye

Not a bad idea, but we can't even get the weight of a Bobby pin to register correctly for more than a week.  I think that may be a bit out of reach.

I love how the LMG isnt even mentioned. This gun shoots bigger bullets than the minigun and fires faster than one as well. the ammo economy for it is the worse. you burn through ammo so fast and do only 16 MAX with all the heavy gun damage perks. a level 1 pipe pistol does that much. 
---
A gun that shoots .308 should not take over 75 bullets to half or quarter an enemies health when shooting them in the head. 
---
I am pretty sure a level 1 picket sign does as much damage as the LMG. 
---
I would love to use it, but it is probably the worse gun in the game.
---
Seeing the grounded mutation and no equivalent for ballistic makes me think they don't have any plans for energy weapons for quite a while. 
---
I didn’t know about that, I actually do care about that kinda thing!
---
Me too pls
---
My account will go in the grave with all my caps and gear. Have fun. 🤣

I was wondering the same thing. Completely specced out for bloodied and the highest I get is around 1,400. That's with all applicable buffs applied. 
---
Idk man I just want to have fun, and being powerful at the end of a fallout game is part of that, maybe instead of nerfing builds that are powerful and fun, buff the mobs that should be difficult to kill like Deathclaws, Mirelurk Queens etc. I don’t want to be stuck unable to kill scorched after a nerf personally but I do appreciate a challenge in killing boss enemies like the big monsters
---
hey i Just saw it a few days ago and now when i Want to try and Build it, it's gone. Fucking Bethesda fucking up shit that Wasn't broke...Again
---
HA ! I'm exact same ... every day until the nuke launches locked out at new year, then meh boring. Now its BlackOps4 for me, may as well do PvP right.

No, their most loyal players are enjoying the game.

I wish that place could be nuked and never come back. Grew to hate that damn place after Rose's quest line. So much traveling. And had went full PA so I was burning through cores so fast.

[Mr. Searchy](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=bulk&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=day) is your friend.
---
True to that but I just adapted, using power armor and anti armor guns and melee weapons now, looks like fallout 76 world is always changing just like the real world..
---
I’m playing it because I enjoy the game. I’m not an especially big fan of Bethesda games in general. I don’t know why you guys insist on writing off people that enjoy the game as obsessed fans. Is it that unbelievable to you that people can like something that you don’t?
---
"reloading your pistol" XD
---
I'll have to get some sons for that but ok. After that, boycott, for sure.
---
I gave you examples that the majority of the souls community easily agrees on, I assumed that included you, I was wrong, so I then provided more evidence.
---
You also keep neglecting the OP fucking melee while she's on the ground, All Rise with even just a few perks will out-dps nearly any gun build post patch.
---
Never did I say once in this post that I was dipping on the game. 
---
I work at a daily newspaper. Not a reporter, but let's just say my job is just as vital. 
---
I make mistakes all the time. These are mistakes that get seen by tens of thousands of people. It hurts me when I screw up, not only because it affects me but it also affects someone else. 
---
Thing is: We can't go back and reverse our errors. The devs can. And they're under more pressure than wr could ever imagine. That's why I haven't lost respect for them. We're human and we make mistakes. Sometimes they're huge. I've done huge mistakes. I do my best to not make another huge one. So can they.

&gt; Scrapping: Junk items that need to be manually scrapped are no longer automatically scrapped for components when attempting to craft.
---
Get your downvotes and one liners out boys, someone disagrees with you.
---
I have been getting the legendary drops from the non-legendaries. Killed a level 9 ghoul (IIRC) and it had two legendaries (armor and weapon, can't recall) in the loot, the actual legendary ghoul had radaway.
---
Honestly completely forgot it existed since I never use it. My bad.
---
...... ,,,,  I think you dropped these
---
And I also said that I was fine with the TSE nerds, did you read the post or skim through it?
---
I was happily married but then Todd came and seduced my wife, utterly cuckolding me :( plz Bethesda, make this game easier by quadrupling the damage output of all guns and making infinite resources and durability :) :)
---
What're you, like an eleven year old girl? You're going to play it to exploit it and teach others to do the same? Are you going to take your little ball and go home? How is being spiteful constructive at all? 
---
Those look like nerfs and atom shop things. I'm talking about content updates. Not hotfixes
---
This guy is full of shit. OP, not you.
---
Look at his post history. He is on a crusade to get melee nerfed like some child.
---
I never understood why people defended this game. Here’s still plenty of people doing it even today. I really wanted this game to be good. I had such high hopes for this game. I only stuck around for about 2 weeks before deciding I had made a huge mistake buying this game. This game is the sole reason I’ll never preorder a game again. I’ll also never buy another Bethesda game as long as they are still on this shit engine and the team is still being lead by the same people. 
---
My question to the people still defending this game:
---
I’m not trying to start an argument, but honestly, why continue to defend or stand by this game?
---
Its not that they messed up the weight again, its that they rebuilt this new patch from yesterday over an old version of the game where bobby pins were at their original weight. Also Duping and all the other glitches from that old version seem to be back. 
---
This was a rookie mistake and I honestly cant defend it because version control isn’t difficult. This game is starting to test my patience. 
---
Why would you not calculate it? The gun does 125. Hence, you put in 125 for the formula. Why would you not do this? When would you account for the extra damage, then?
---
I now, but people may overlook that if a new feature is introduced.
---
Okay. So that’s all you read then. So you should actually read the post before saying anything. 
---
&gt;I am losing so far
---
we all are unfortunately 
---
You don't speak for me.
---
I’m keeping hold of the game but as a level 30 trying to explore and do things, it’s hard when somebody who is level 130 rolls in and power scales everything. Feel like I’m tied to the forest.
---
I wanted to establish a shop and become a trader as well.  The uneven economy and nerfing made me realize it's pointless.  We were given the responsibility to populate a world with nothing to help us do it.  I now have zero desire to do so. :(
---
My gf and I had been planning for a few days to sit down and play again last night. It was so buggy and ran so poorly on her computer that we quit after about 15 minutes. We were both so disappointed that we couldn't play that we ended up having a long discussion about what other game we could play together. Extremely let down by Bethesda. 
---
Whatever makes the community happy again
---
rip in peace
---
Someone tried this on me last night, but I’m a level 140 pacifist. And I dont use mutations, 
---
I need that 2 wood and 1 plastic for my endless pile of junk in sanctuary that i never use on anything. However, they weigh 3 lbs while only giving a couple of useful stuff so they're a waste to pick up, unless you use mods
---
It's precisely because of this. They probably just switched off the ability of the crafting menus to breakdown any items that would yield the required materials. I wonder if it would even work on non-scrapped junk items..
---
&gt; Double Penetrating Roll for Torgue weapons was objectively the best
---
Yes, that's great!
---
But TSE shouldn't be unquestionably the best in all circumstances by a factor of 4+. That puts us in a situation where all other legendary drops are vendor trash and puts the devs in a situation where they have to balance content in a way that works for TSE weapon users who are dealing 4-6x as much damage as others.
---
I feel like they just needed to nerf the explosive damage why would the nerf the two shot to 25% when your technically shooting 2 bullets like where is the sense in it might as well just shoot one bullet
---
Tbf I was a fan of paragon - I wish we had these messages on that sub.
---
Fuckin’ beats me. 
---
Bethesda nerfed White Knight because they didn't want it to feel like a mandatory pick.  Luck of the draw shouldn't be mandatory either.  
---
Good points, agree with both of you.  In BETA it was new so for the most part players expected there to be issues.  Everyone was on a level playing field, so more willing to help each other out.  
---
Fast forward, game is still broken as if it was the BETA.  Players have already completed the end game content (causing boredom) so now with the market flooded with top tier weapons there is no point in grinding.  So to keep things interesting players started looking at PVP and  even now most agree that’s boring too.   So now you have bored players just griefing just to have something to do or they just quit.
---
Now Bethesda has a released game that still needs some major debugging and also have a good chunk of players ready for new content.  Players (won’t say all) don’t want new content that could potentially bring more bugs to an already bugged game but in the same breath want a reason to play.
---
Think personally Bethesda in a real conundrum.  Do we put out new content and hope for the best (if it fails loose more players) or debug.
---
I will say that this new update will definitely make you feel like you’re wasting time, but the developers have to add more content. It’s all anyone’s been asking for after less than 3 months. 
---
You use them as parts of recipes for crafting better food
---
Doesnt help that it is a day after a patch for it.
---
Something, anything straight from the devs mouth would be nice.
---
Destiny 2 has the devs for the various sections of the games come onto the update posts and explain things now and then.
---
Hearing it straight from the horses mouth would help.
---
I'm continuing to play, hoping deep down Bethesda solves the shitshow it's become, I have faith but it is starting to waver.
---
It seems to be one thing after the other with each further update, these problems  have more heads than a hydra, get rid of one and 3-4 more take it's place 
---
optimized bracers is bugged,it does nothing
---
I'll spend a cap or two for some mutations that someone who's leaving doesn't want. I mean, if you're sure you're leaving and won't play again, why let it go to waste?
---
I'll preface this by saying one observation does not a problem make. But I just got inside Defiance, status was Hidden. Moved a few feet in, got Caution. Turned right and went to the start of the hallway, Danger. That's happened before, and I backed off, went back to the doors. Combat music, then the mob rush. Ran out, ran in. Same, Caution followed by Danger. Then back to Hidden at the start of the hallway. I'm just looking down it, still crouched and hidden. And then the mob rush, here they come. No status change, no music. Lag? Dunno. I can relog multiple times to test further, but really that would be Beth's job.
---
Thank you for being here as the face of Bethesda, hope it isn't wrecking your sanity dealing with the toxicity on these threads and the plethora of issues that each new patch creates. I like the game and truly feel it could have been the greatest Fallout yet, could have been. The focus on PvP when it's supposed to be a co-op rebuild the world game is just wrong but separating them into different server's can resolve this. The nerfs on perks and weapons would have been totally unnecessary if PvP hadn't been a focus of this game. The list of bugs currently still in game is so long I doubt most will be fixed this year. The worst offence to us longtime Bethesda supporters is that there are bugs in this game that have been around in the creation engine since day 1, they weren't fixed then and should never have even showed up in 76, a simple perusal of the wiki's for those games and the bug lists contained therein could have saved the development team a ton of the grief that has been thrown their way. We as a community I feel do understand the difficulties of creating a huge game and do expect some bugs, especially from this studio, but not eliminating exploits/bugs/glitches that have been known for nearly 2 decades is kinda inexcusable. No other industry could get away with this, if a home appliance company released a fridge that randomly heated food it wouldn't take months to be fixed and certainly wouldn't persist for years in the brand. I look forward to this game finding it's way hopefully soon. Again Thank you for talking to us at least, my personal experience with the other forms of "talking" to Bethesda over the last 20 years has been abysmal, rarely a response and almost always a link to reinstall/repair files, FYI gamers are well aware of the steps and almost all will have tried them before posting problems or contacting support.
---
For Honor is the reason I hold out hope for 76. We've seen what a team can do with a good lead after a poor launch and overall poor reception.
---
&gt;I wish they would.
---
Brilliant, then your free dlc content goes bye bye too. Genius really.
---
The problem with this Idea is Bethesdas game engine that runs 76 cant really handle vehicles. Especially since the physics are tied to frame rates. The way the vertibirds snuck around this was by flying over the sky box so it didn’t actually load anything below fully. 
---
&gt;I liked having to hunt for them, 
---
If you enjoy visiting a vendor for the 500th time only to find that he still doesn't have jet pack plans, then that's your perspective. 
---
But I assure you that most people don't find that fun. 
---
Nor do they enjoy getting the same plans 30 times from the same event.
---
I love marsupials but I would get rid of it if it made me have kangaroo legs. 
---
Probably didn’t do this because everyone would be running around looking like an alien rather than a person.
---
I immediately got a mental image of Todd Howard laying on his stomach on a pink 4 post bed, clad in pajamas, kicking his unsocked feet in alternating fashion. He begins to write and his voice is heard in mental overlay form, "Dear Diary, today it just isn't working".
---
You need better people to play with...
---
Sure, my friend may snag all the clipboards, but we share our resources.  If he's short on steel, I cover him.  ammunition... we run different types and give each other what we find.  I'm good at finding chems, so I keep the group stocked on stims and meds.  One guy is good at trading, so he finds new weapons for us to try out.  If you've got a greedy survivor, cut him loose.
---
The engine is a buggy mess, the Dev's themselves aren't the problem.  They should have never tried to make an always online game based on this buggy mess.
---
I understand what you are saying, and will probably get downvoted for this. A lot of the people that are unhappy, aren't just unhappy about 1 thing in particular.
---
I only ever owned 1 piece of a TSE weapon, a 50.cal. I agree with most people, it needed a nerf, it wasn't fun being able to oneshot everything. But since heavy guns feels useless without explosive damage, I now have zero interest in the gun. The nerf was simply too severe. Needed, but too severe. 
---
And most people are also forgetting about the guns that are only TS and E, not both put together. 
---
My explosive 10mm smg went from taking down 3 max level super mutants with one magazine, to having to headshot every shot to put just 1 down. Again, I don't want to oneshot them, I just want the weapons to actually be effective. 
---
I also have an Anti-armor Explosive LMG, which went from 75 damage, to 33. It will take a full mag of 75 .308 rounds to take down a max level super mutant. The explosive damage was again the only thing making that weapon decent, in my opinion.
---
Those issues also affect missile launchers and fat mans. They weren't exactly great before the 40% nerf in damage. 
---
I think that all those issues combined, was just enough to push a lot of people already agitated by the company's bad decisions in the past, over the edge. Which is why you are seeing a lot of "I'm leaving" posts. 
---
I want to make it clear; I'm not looking to one-shot stuff all the time, that gets boring. But removing up to 80% damage was a bit much.
---
I'd expect no less than 80 hours of game-play from a game, with hopes that it keeps me engaged for at least 120, or more. I've got about 100 or so hours in FO76 and I'm level 69 or so. Even though I still haven't launched my nuke yet, I *am* finding it hard to find real end-game content. That being said, I do enjoy logging in, exploring and building my camp. Last night I pulled everything down so I could build with brick walls... and promptly ran out of concrete and wood. So, I have something to do when I get home from work tonight... find more fucking concrete.
---
All in all, yes, some things in the game are obnoxious and frustrating, but I'm a patient man and life's way too short for them to get me too steamed.
---
Loved them both. RDR2 I played through twice though, if that tells you anything.
---
I had the original Fallout game on vinyl. I was the original legacy fan before you were even born. I showered in Fallout radiation. I jerked it to the pip-girl animations. So I WIN.
---
It's just aluminum and lead btw. So not too much to know.
---
But I just use the bulking menu to see what I have too much of. I go through the thinkers workbench and bulk whatever I have more than 200 of, then I check my stash and anything still over 200 I know I can't bulk, but can sell without bulking so I just take and sell however much. 
---
Ooh the venom.   You talk as if you know how the game industry works!   Like how most artists and programmers are contact based and often are project to project based.  Most decisions fall on creative leads and project leads and are out of artist, programmer,  and balance team control.   
---
I hopped on yesterday after a long day at work; was excited didn’t get to play since the update came out..
---
I was not okay
---
Cant say ive had that many disconnects to be honest, no black screens, a handful of CTD's.  
---
Certainly less in this last months than before
---
I play a stealth vats sniper build and it hasn't affected the way I play either (except the wonky stealth bug after patch). My TSE lever action still does the most overall dps but my Instigating lever action really shines to open combat (especially in vats, TS accuracy in vats has always been garbage).
---
I'll definitely still use the TSE on SBQ fights since it has the prime receiver, but the instigating does fine for most all other fights, still one shots all but the toughest enemies.
---
Yeah I tested it with my buds already. My friends said it was because of the gloves but Manta Man works with the underarmor too you can just sometimes see the black clip thru the suit on the hands. So not sure why The Inspector does this. 
---
Gun bashes suck but that’s not melee. With very little spec into melee the All Rise is godly. 
---
One day I logged off, downloaded Seven Days to Die, realized it was the game I was looking for in the first place, haven't been back since.
---
I have not experienced this as long as I have my current CAC, and it is not expired. I have not had to renew mince 2017 so regs could have changed.
---
I love how you guys just took this and rolled with it without any proof. Yes bobby pins got their weight reverted. What else is proof that the entire version was rolled back? What specific bug from an old version that has since been fixed have you specifically encountered? Surely you wouldn’t just say this without any type of verification right?
---
Getting really sick of these sanctimonious "bye" replies.
---
Two shot used to do double damage. Now it's only 25%. I am literally shaking right now. I'm so angry I feel like I might explode. HELP ME BROTHERS.
---
enemies have been called bullet sponges since the beginning.
---
melee weapons are still OP af. it's funny that everyone is on board for completely neutering TSE weapons to the point where  they are mediocre and one-star TS and explosives as completely useless, but when it comes to the crutch that is accessible to everyone, those same people start clutching pearls. people would lose their minds if melee got a 75-80% nerf, which btw is a very real possibility. idk if anyone else has noticed that the word "balance" = nerf in Bethesda's dictionary, and melee is definitely in need of some balance.
---
Yeah you're right. NMS and fo76 both promised multiplayer at launch and neither delivered. /s 
---
I'd say because people (like myself) have become disenfranchised with anything to do with this game due to the pre-school level of QA that goes into anything they seem to touch in the code.  
---
Especially if we could race each other...imagine we are racing down the road dodging feral ghouls and getting chased by bloated ones. One spawns in front of you and you hover swerve into my Fusion Flea. I hover off the road into a ditch and explode in an explosion the size of a mini nuke. (Wouldn’t it be nice 🎵)
---
What bugs besides the bobby pins?
---
From what I've heard, they're busy working on putting out a fix this week or the beginning of next week. I'd rather them be doing that than perusing Reddit, giving out the same reply over and over again because ten million people have commented the same thing, and then getting based for "giving the same info over and over again." They can't win at this point so I think maybe letting the CMs handle it is the best option. What do you think?
---
Right now Xbox 76 is having server issues a lot of people can’t get online I’m getting a connection problem message saying vault tech is working on it.
---
Yeah I keep an explosive Dragon that helps but I try not to take on scorched solo, waste of ammo. Way more exp just clearing towns and super mutants. If I want to farm scorched I just sit at Fort Defiance and let the artillery fuck em up.
---
Screaming for nerfs just plays right into the devs hands. They have no content in the game. The final boss is server (in)stability and bugs. Nerfing XP gains, devolving QoL, and nerfing effective builds that were functioning as intended... all of these things slow player progress and creates a false sense that there's more to do in the game than grind and load screens. 
---
Had the same problem.
---
Honestly, I can't even defend this game anymore.
---
Very possible. Send a ticket to them asking for a fix. 
---
good lord you babies whine
---
First time I went there I started hearing  the music when I went inside, but it stopped when I entered the chapel. Just went back and  and crouched on the roof and waited and the music seemed to kick in at 11:00 PM. Then it stopped abruptly just after 11:30. Haven't found any signs of a man made cause for this so far, so I guess it's legit spoopy? The music is creepy af, that's for sure.
---
It would be called DayZ
---
Corporate greed... that's what happened.

No..you dont use quotes when paraphrasing...
---
http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/anderson/quotation.htm
---
You would. I realized what you were doing. You're correct and I edited my post.
---
also fuck the butthurts downvoting you
---
*76 is a beautifully crafted and detailed environment. With massive amounts of propping, foliage, and interactable items. The game has distant weather systems, volumetric fog, and nukes that look amazing.*
---
Wow man, the amount of fanboy that came out of that sentence is nauseating. From a distance, maybe, but a simple rock should not look as pixelated as they do in a multiplayer game launched in 2018. It does not have "16 times the detail". Its a terrible looking game up close. Even the nukes look shite so I 100% disagree with you there. Red Dead Online has a weather systems far superior to F76 and thats an example of the top of my head.
---
*I don't think you understand how game engines work. What you're suggesting is a step backwards, not forwards.*
---
Firstly I work in IT and I have a very good idea how game engines work. The argument I was making was that Creation Engine was so poor for F76 that it might actually be in their best interest to change. Of course they have to learn how to use it, of course they need to start things from scratch but it may be in the better interest to do so in the long run as the Creation engine is poor by AAA standards. Be it Starfield, ES6 or whatever, they need to make the transition at some stage and I am not alone in this argument.
---
*Do you think that this development process will have no downs? You are using one faulty patch to justify your biased argument. You and everyone else jump at anything you can to put bethesda down.*
---
I have supported many games in the past, a lot of them early access too, and no man, this is far beyond ONE faulty patch. Never seen as big a multiplayer game with as many exploits as F76. Heck you could use expliots from Fallout 4 (e.g. infinite inventory using pocketed armour).
---
*Either way, whether you like it or not, some people can enjoy the game for what it is and still have a great time.*
---
Honestly I don't care or not if people like the game, they are very much entitled too both opinions. Just don't take a big snake like turd on my plate and tell me its Kobe Beef. You are welcome to chomp it all down but remember you are still eating a turd.
---
Huh, I might have to try ESO.  It sure is pretty.
---
It isn't in the patch notes, because it wasn't an intentional change. 
---
It was extremely OP but got an extreme nerf. Hopefully the next balance patch will fix it. 
---
Meanwhile you guys should stop whining. You re upset we get it. Your toys will be fixed sooner or later
---
what they need to do is change armor on enemies from a static number to a "durability" so that as more bullets chip away at it the value lowers over time increasing the total damage for automatic weapons 
---
Its because they did not tie it to character name its tied to our account name. They need to correct this to make it work for alts.
---
But a good PSA regardless OP +1.
---
I understand the frustration but dv'ing "hey it's getting fixed soon" seems a bit...childish, for lack of a better word coming to mind. What do you think?
---
I enjoy the game. But can’t defend the company, they are doing a real shit job at fixing issues. 
---
&gt;They need to go play COD
---
I'm sure most of them have left to do exactly that
---
Yeah, did the trick, also logout takes a while now, was instantaneous before... man they did screw this one up...
---
^Thanks.
---
I said almost. Grand promises not kept, Dev fucking up pr, not enough launch content. Sounds pretty similar to me. 
---
Bump
---
That's sucks
---
I wouldn't even say that, I CTD'd from the atom shop trying to make a purchase.
---
I thought the battlefield community was toxic and whiny. Then I got on this sub......
---
it looks so cool and would be so much fun to use, but it is such shit. I rather use an automatic lazer rifle than the LMG. would kill more and probably last just as long
---
No Mans Sky died down after like 2 weeks. It's been 76 days and still every day new fuck ups are happening with this game. It was also Hello Games first non-mobile game, Bethesda are a AAA developer that's been in the industry since before PlayStation and Xbox were a thing.
---
This happens almost 100% time I fast travel anywhere. Always some right leg or left arm missing. Very, very infuriating.
---
180 Tato plants made me king tato 
---
I have over 300 hours. I’d say that’s more than worth $60. 
---
We're all still playing BETA, though...
---
Welcome to snowflake land! 
---
Oh yeah. Didnt think about this one. Scaly skin is at least for both dmg types. But grounded is really one sided.
---
Yeah the years thing was talking about bugs from fo3/fo4
---
I figured as much, it's honestly a simple oversight on their part. If it was a couple years back I would have expected better from them, but at this point, it's exactly the kind of thing I'd expect them to do...  
---
Thanks for the updoot.
---
When I cut a massive fart I usually try and sneak out of the room before anyone realizes it was me.
---
It's not all I read but it's what I chose to comment on. Your overpowered shit got nerfed and you cried about it online. Do you want sympathy that you can't one-shot everything and everyone any more? 
---
Yeah i'm feeling the same way, got 2 characters, 500 hours played and ive done everything possible except get all plans available in game.
---
Whoever is in charge of FO76 gets things moving , because currently we have had 5 patches and this game is still riddled with major flaws.
---
Survival mode sounds great which i might try out in the future when its available, but im worried it will just turn into more of the same.
---
In the mean time im switching over to Subnautica below zero early access. It just got released today so im gonna play that.
---
That is what struck me as odd. Every time I pick one up I see "2% food." My first thought was wow...I guess a man could live on salt alone? haha
---
My particular issue with this patch isn’t enough to make me leave but I’m PISSED about having to take bulk out of my stash and having to break it down again to use it
---
Yep in sad about this. Automatic weapons already ate so much ammo you can't use them without melee in your build as well for when you run out.
---
No they nerfed your duplicated TSE so you are no longer unkillable. 
---
You're a regular"glass half full" kinda guy when it comes to EA...
---
Ok, you must not be informed. Do a comparison of how many Star Wars games were released within the same time frame EA had the license and prior. You can Google that yourself. Yes, it's hording.
---
As for canceling games, sure it happens but not after they not only aquire the SW license but during far into post production, after a major fan buzz all which resulted to the studio shutting down and devs out of work. It's a habit for them. Aquire a small company with a buzz, shut them down and reallocate the funds for a mobile game. 
---
I didn't mention SWTOR. I specifically mentioned KOTOR. You knew what I meant you just needed to break out your game of semantics in hopes for a quick win. In case you're once again uninformed (which you clearly are) it was reported recently that BioWare has made SEVERAL attempt to pitch KOTOR to EA since they've had the license and they are not interested. So yes K-O-T-O-R is in limbo because of EA.
---
Ok, now you're just being silly. This is the reason why I mention the "license" issue as a situation of the past. If you recall back in the XBOX 360 era and the height of used games before digital downloads were common if you  buy a used copy of an EA title (pay attention, this is where you'll learn something) in order to play certain maps that are regularly available on the NEW copy for FREE (NOT the DLC) you had to purchase a license valued at the cost of a new game in order to play those. In other words your used game you bought was reduced to a demo unless you bought a new license from EA so yes that is extortion. BONUS INFO: GameStop doesn't offer refunds on used games. Only credit.
---
I'm sure they'll make it a $15 option on the store ... 
---
Wait... OP, are you suggesting the game isn't complete and ready for launch?! Oh no... If only there we're some sort of pre game launch that would allow proper testing of game function...
---
Not toxic just filled full of r/inceltears
---
This is how horror stories start in Nebraska. 
---
Didn't think the nerf to TSE was gonna hit this sub so hard.
---
This made my day. Thank you.
---
yeah i could imagine someone with all mutations introducing themselves  to someone who has just came out of the vault, looking like a super mutant ghoul kangaroo with an arm sticking out of their stomach
---
Man, I have to disagree, this reddit is full of 76 dickriders. You can’t be serious. This is probably the third “i’m sick of this game” thread that doesn’t get downvoted into Oblivion. 
---
I’ve said twice NOW three that I personally am fine with the nerds. What about that don’t you understand?
---
Tried that. Even having the mats non bulked in my inventory does not let me fix anything. 
---
Thank you for being an adult about it :)
---
People with TSE builds are upset that they've been nerfed, which is understandable.
---
Then there's the fact that this patch inadvertently reverted a few changes and glitch fixes, leading to questions about other things that might have come back (dupings return, however, appears to have been just a rumor, thankfully.) It also lead to lots of deserved criticism regarding QA, though a lot of it went way too far when it comes to how heated it got.
---
A fix is coming this week or early next. Look for even more ridicule then even though they put out a fix fairly quick when it comes to this team.
---
If you don't have either, how does your superior intellect suggest they pay for servers long term? 
---
Use that big brain to impress us all and name some large online PC games that don't sell things, require a subscription of some sort, or run ads to pay for server space and bandwidth.
---
I probably wouldn't have invested my time if I knew how things were going to turn out.  But at this point I'm committed to supporting the community that has formed around my mod.
---
It does but it erases when the game crashes, sadly.
---
Probably didn't do it because they would actually have to add some unique new content.
---
Dear SBQ, can we get build, armor etc for that? 
---
Well in my understanding people are leaving because two shot explosive is nerfed to the dirt, duper is dead now because the max carry amount actually have a limit of 2k or something depending on your carry weight, players that role play as vendor cannot have much inventory for sale now because of the limit, most of the rare plan can be bought from the vendor now so the plan trading market is dead. Otherwise I think the game is still playable just need shoot couple more bullet to kill enemy 
---
Yeah they have made me question alot of things lately regarding Bethesda lol.
---
But hopefully this can be simply fixed and hopefully they will consider beta servers for patches. Just so we can help them fix these issues first. 
---
Because they nerfed the TSE’s and now everyone can’t one-shot every enemy with their duplicated weapons. So people are crying because they actually have a chance of dying from enemies now. 
---
Yeah but you got a couple months out of that dumpster fire which is better than anyone could have hoped for lol 
---
The thing I don't understand is that why these mistakes were not avoided entirely. I know Bethesda compartmentalizes these games from each other but its got a MMORG already. Elder Scrolls Online has been running since 2014. At its release, it was plagued with many of the same bugs and lacking features that 76 is currently experiencing. You think buying a princess bed in the Atom Store with credits you earned in game pisses you off? ESO was originally subscription based, you paid $15/mo just for the privilege to play it. It had to same instability issues, lack of content, and yes even duping glitches. All has been addressed and fixed. They constantly add content. Sometimes just a new dungeon but also entire new land areas and easily as big as the entire map of 76 have been added. Endless quests and achievements as well as PVP (if that your thing). Player housing, massive storage increases, in game chat, and NPC vendors where you can place your items for sale to other players. None if this existed in the day on release. I was there. Ther game was a ridiculous leveling grind and much like 76 the only way to communicate without headset was a couple preset messages to send to a player immediately next to you. Trading was a nightmare because there was no way to specify what you wanted or how much they wanted for it. All of it has been fixed because the developers listened to the players. Why were these people not consulted? They could have at least given a heads up to 76's developers about certain issues that would come up. If they had consulted most of the game play experience issues wouldn't be there. Yes the game would still have bugs to work out but what game doesn't?
---
Nah this game had potential, Bethesda has just shown now in the months after they don’t understand how to manage a multiplayer game. Nerf the best guns so people have to farm more when the current content is already stale. One boss.... let me repeat that.... one boss. And to boot the cheaters once again profited for the like third time without being punished off the same cheat(I’m just gonna day it if you duped your a cheater), might as well condone cheating at this point. 
---
I can stand a bad launch, I can stand something DIFFERENT from the normal when it comes to fallout. What I can’t stand though is proof, over and over at that, of overall incompetence to develop a multiplayer game correctly. 
---
Beth isn't corporate is the thing. But regardless I agree, I just had hope in the beginning.  
---
I’m from WV and have a ton of friends who picked it up just because we really wanted to play a game set in our state and really enjoy it. We gave it a lot more of a chance than most would but ultimately we all left it behind. The atmosphere was good. The map looks great in a lot of places. Overall the setting was really good and appreciated by all of us but the constant terrible decisions just killed it for us. 
---
Take it back to the drawing board and flesh out a single player campaign with the world as is. Tell the story first hand. Keep the West Virginia setting. Make the whole thing feel alive and it could be amazing. As it stands it’s just half finished and half assed. 
---
maybe you shouldn't have duped so many
---
I stopped playing a few weeks ago when I complained about the inventory issues and everyone told me to suck it up.
---
Obviously this game isn’t for me.
---
The Ebayers are pissed that Beth broke their guns
---
In my honest opinion. The game was meant to be difficult. It was meant to force decisions on playstyle, junk hoarding, etc etc. but it's like the community just wants to walk around without a care in the world 1 shotting the entire map. I just don't get it. 
---
In my 600+ hours of gameplay, I've had one tse drop. If tse was as rare as it should be, the nerf never would've happened bc the guns would be rare. But nah. Community had to go make 600,000 copies of every tse weapon that's dropped. 
---
It's just irritating to watch a community ruin a game and then cry about it like it's bethesdas fault. 
---
I mean, I wouldn’t say I’m loyal by any means. I’ll play the game as long as it’s fun. As soon as I stop having fun I’m out. As it should be. 
---
God thing is sad to hear.
---
Someone PM me when the lawsuit happens and I can get a refund. 
---
Ok, so imagine you pay someone to build a wall for you at the end of your garden, cash up front.
---
A week comes and goes, the first set of bricks is laid. Another week comes and goes, a few more bricks get added. Ok, it's moving a bit slowly but hey, there's only so many bricks right? The wall will be done eventually if bricks keep getting laid, it's just a matter of time.
---
Then one morning you wake up and a bunch of bricks in the wall are missing. Suddenly you have no confidence the wall will ever be finished and you just say 'Fuck it'.
---
I killed a SBQ yesterday and didn’t get anything from it. I didn’t do much damage to it but most certainly got some hits on it :(
---
Ya, i dont see the need for a paperback that looks like it took about an hour to write and edit 😂😂😂
---
And dumbererer
---
When you have a terrible stomach ache, and take a massive liquid shit, feel better again and smile, only for round two to come after you’re done cleaning your ass. 
---
People are adverse to change, anyone who remembers the lunch king event thing from wow can attest
---
Melee Nerf is completely unnecessary. You know why? Range is a BIG factor. You try to melee attack someone using an automatic weapon. If they keep their distance, you're going to have problems. Hits hard in CQC but difficult at range. Sounds good to me
---
I used to take the sneaky route, but I've recently been running in with automatic weapons and it has been a blast. Even though I get overwhelmed quickly with this play style, but I guess it gives me a reason to use up some of my stimpacks.
---
This community is full of a bunch of whining snowflakes they don’t care about the good Bethesda does only the bad.
---
That I do not know just yet, I'll find out more when it's closer to being finalized.
---
Not even remotely the same, 76 was buggy and had issues but was playable from start to finish. NMS an interactive screen saver at launch. Literally had nothing you could do other than name planets/flora/fauna and fly around until "end game" was entering a portal that started you all over somewhere else.
---
Bethesda please don’t do this. I like my 13 pounds of bobby-pins and crashing client.  If it was bug free it wouldn’t be Bethesda.  
---
I would also like to say....  
---
....&lt;server not responding&gt;
---
....user has been disconnected.
---
I think I’ll take a break and come back in a couple months. Division 2 is coming soon so maybe even more time away. Hope I return to something worth my time.
---
I don't know what all rise is off the top of my head, but when it comes to the super sledge doesn't it weigh a lot? 
---
In most games I expect a gun bash to kill in 2-3 hits on a normal enemy, like scorched or ghouls(although not super mutants because they're so strong), while a normal medium sword would kill in 1-2, and a heavy melee weapon like the super sledge in 1-2 as well, but the the ability to hit multiple enemies with it at once. I just don't feel the melee weapons are as good as they should be from the get go, and if you have to have one of those two weapons then they're probably going to nerf both of them to make it an equal playing ground like they did with explosives  lol
---
Lol now people are crying over patches, let me guess the nerfed your TSE or even stopped your bobblehead attack wait or even put in motion a way to stop duppers lol you guys are funny
---
Hmm maybe i just didnt get far enough yet. Ill give it more of a shot
---
Tru dat but melee weapons havent been duped until they are red and sore and need a hug
---
I just blast any low level away doing this... you have a bounty plus you're hitting someone, and you expect them to stand there and do nothing?
---
I thougt got enjoyed for honor all the way honestly ^ ^ but they are a good example, an even better one is hello games for no mans sky
---
I've had the opposite happen to me. See a plan in the shop, it does not show as Known. Buy it, try to learn it "you already know this plan" then it gets the Known flag.
---
I'm just curious to where the 20000 people stopped playing in the last 24 hours came from and how did you manage to get 2000 hours in.   That's 8 hours a day for 6 months 5 days a week.
---
Does ammosmith let you convert existing ammo types, like .38 or .50 ball cap to .45 or .44 or 5.56.
---
If it does not, why shouldn’t it?
---
You should get outside more.
---
It's alright, we're not angry at you. Now, if one of the programmers or executives were to post, THEN I'd have some ban-worthy words for them, but we know customer service is doing what they can. Hell, this is probably worse for you than us; we can just walk away from this mess, but you have to deal with it day in, day out.
---
I'll say this as someone who's not all that upset and who never had a TSE weapon: 
---
they fucked up some perfectly viable builds (and re-introduced bugs that had already been squashed)
---
Missle Launchers and the like were already pretty shitty. Now they're totally useless. I feel bad for people who built a fun, unique build around those perks. Especially since Bethesda isn't letting people re-allocate SPECIALs or Perks as a compromise.
---
I also don't know why they nerfed things like White Knight. Just so people are forced to repair their stuff *even more*? 
---
Agreed,  we get it you got burned by andromeda and battlefront 2. Don't like the prices, don't buy it.  It's not going to have consequences for the actual game play. 
---
What else would you like her to do to demonstrate she "gives a shit"?
---
I can't imagine to be worse than Bethesda now.
---
&gt;so why put them in the stash in the first place?
---
I just had some there. I didn't put any on current patch.
---
As prior they were practically weightless, so they didn't consume any space in stash. But that way if I sell too many and run low or completely out(yep happened), I can have small backup. I don't hoard them so I usually have maybe 20+10 or so. Now because their weight has increased again, I wanted to reduce the amounts I have, by selling them.
---
At this point I'm just assuming they will fuck them both up, and won't be buying them.
---
Hundreds of hours? What game were you playing? I meandered through the main story, and have hit level 170, and was launching nukes and killing SBQ within my first 3 days of playing. Even if you assune I played without food, sleep, or bathroom breaks, I still hit the endgame ceiling within 72 hours. Spoiler alert: it was less than that, I take suuuuper long bathroom breaks. 
---
Tack on the relentless comedy of errors that is the last 2 months of updates, and compare that to the promises that were made to the community pre-launch, and how can anybody pretend to be surprised at the anger?
---
What we need is someone to answer our questions. not someone who transmits things especially now in the state that is the game 
---
Voices need to be heard for change friend
---
Well, again, you don't want 'most players' doing your play testing.  You want ones that know what it means to participate and are still willing.  
---
If I had the time I would, but I've done some in the past so I know what a pain it can be.  
---
Oh look, floating tree.  Stop, get coords, screenshot, make note, move to next.  Moved through wall.  Stop, get coords, get screenshot, attempt to reproduce.  Reproduce and note steps to reproduce, move to next.  
---
Not what most would consider fun.
---
If you load near your base and bring up your pip boy before moving, your character will be stuck. I'm on Xbox. 5/5 Today. 
---
I have no interest to workaround anymore of this garbage. 
---
Don't get me started on the Bobby Pin weight. That's the best indicator of how this dumpster fire has been managed by BGS. 
---
took twenty minutes lol, and the reason is to hopefully get a fucking message out to a group of thickskulled devs that people want this game to work 
---
my weapons are non-legendary (crafted).  my primary melee weapons are legendary.  perhaps that's the difference.  pretty sure my shotgun doesn't put nearly that much damage.
---
Yes, thank you L.D.!
---
lucky to get a half hour of play before a Dc, usually barely ten minutes on PC.
---
Something I didn't see OP mention regarding energy weapons: All perks, mods, and legendary effects that increase armor penetration ONLY affect ballistic resistance and not energy resistance, making it so they're completely worthless when using energy weapons and compounding the lack of damage issue.
---
Similar thing with Battlefront 2 imo. It launched as a bad game with an awful progression system not much reason to play. Since then there has been a progression overhaul which makes it so you’re gameplay actually matters and you have something to work towards. As well as that you can only spend money on cosmetics, which are still pretty easy to get without spending money.
---
I think Battlefront 2 is a pretty decent game now. I just hope Fallout 76 can follow the same path at this point. It shouldn’t of had to but Bethesda messed up.
---
Too much public math to figure out this game.
---
So that’s where all the legendaries have gone lol
---
I'm right there with you.  Starfield, ES6 and FO5 will need to be nothing short of exceptional if they want to win back any trust.
---
For those of you that still enjoy the game I have nothing but love for you, and I hope your dedication will light a fire under Bethesda's ass.
---
PvP is a disguise to draw out content when they don't actually have anything to add 
---
Wow, talk about blind. They were very much the same. But, nms for better and fo76 can too
---
2 days? How about &lt;15 minutes. Or better yet, my .50 cal machine gun can't even last 4 clips. Fully repaired, I use it on the SBQ, and I can't get to a 4th reload. That's less than 2000 bullets and the gun is useless. How the hell am I supposed to do damage to a 10k+ hp creature that replenishes it's health when you finally got it halfway? You don't. Simple. And now you can't even repair your broken gun because you have bulked your materials to fit them in a ridiculously tiny stash size.
---
We'll, I'm done. I really wanted to like this game, but the fun I finally had lately completely went down the drain with this latest disaster they call a patch.
---
I'm returning to FO4. You know, the game that got fixed by devs (Read: modders) that are truly dedicated, without getting paid to do so.
---
&gt; fairly quick when it comes to this team.
---
This is glacial in absolute terms.
---
Fixing the game would be a start
---
some people don't know how
---
I’m not giving up on Bethesda, I’m giving up on Bethesda Game Studios making online games. The main reason some of us stick for 1000 hours playing the same game is because we can tweak it, people make amazing quest mods and extend the life of the game. 76 is boring and short, you can’t mod it, you can’t make your own story. I just want another singleplayer game, until then, I’ll be playing more Fallout 4, which by the way, is still alive due to great mods. 
---
SAME 🤞
---
&gt; No matter how promising the announcement and game footage may look, I think they've already caused damaged to their pre-sales numbers.
---
The only pre-orders I'll do in the future, are from Gamestop.  With Gamestop, you can do a $5 pre-order and get a beta key.   That's how I'll be testing games in the future.   Bethesda taught me a valuable lesson, and I thank them for that.  
---
That should just make a lot of things worth getting, for all weapon types, so you have a nice choice between powerful things rather than just TSE 
---
Same boat man. I held on hope until this latest clusterfuck. Uninstalled this morning pending further updates.
---
She didn't relay any of the suggestions players made in the last 2 weeks about the Nerfs.
---
I was able to craft them both once and never since. Also can’t relearn the plans!
---
Firstly, live service models is not 'new shit'. Secondly, when you try it and get it completely wrong you don't get a pat on the head from the Brand Loyalty Brigade.
---
kthxbai
---
See that’s just a view of “new” areas when they recycled so much content
---
I agree, I've kill hundreds with non legendary weapons. OP is lying or has absolutely no idea how to play.
---
Yes I like the game more then any other that has released last year and so far this year
---
I’m fine with the nerfs 
---
Honestly... feels like when Destiny made all the legendary gear useless after their first season update. Demolition perk is all but useless, you get more from 2 extra rank in any rifleman than you do demolition maxed at 5 now. I mean some max enemies it's still fine 2 or 3 shots but others are just damage sponges now for anything ranged. 
---
I find this funny because you imply everyone’s tse was duped
---
&gt;	Nerf sledgehammer
---
Don’t give them any ideas about nerfing sledgehammers!
---
&gt; Gearbox
---
Aliens: Colonial Marines
---
Good god 
---
I actually like it better than Fallout 4 tbh
---
My buddy loves his lazers so all these nerfs etc dont affect him at all
---
And yet you cant kill a scorch beast...... lol
---
I was implying that they equalized those percentage  numbers in an attempt to balance solely on the number itself 
---
Dang, you must live in a cave then
---
Had the same thing a couple of days ago. Did the silo, just entering the blast zone and then crash. This shortly after a lootless queen did not have me in the best of moods.
---
If I can’t accept your opinion, which is completely subjective, that it wasn’t worth the money then I’m blind?? What even kind of logic is this? You’re not the authority on what is and isn’t worth something to everyone else lol. I have over 300 hours and counting. That’s more than worth $60. 
---
The community of this subreddit is pretty shit too tbh
---
What kind of perks you have there? I'm assuming you have pretty low health and a fuck-ton of melee cards equipped plus maybe a bobblehead or two
---
Same I never picked the game back up after I got Battlefield 5. The other day I wanted to install Sea of Thieves and the first game that was disinstalled to make room was FO.
---
None of the areas are even close to recycled 
---
1. Not exactly, if you look carefully after moving the trucks and debris that the green build outline is cocked at an angle while the extractor wants to be placed flat. Not really game breaking but annoying when you can’t utilize all the resources at the busiest power plant in the game.
---
2. True and true, but I’m not saying bog EVERYTHING with NPCs but I refuse to accept Rose as a chem taking mr handy. She’s in a room all by herself is it really that hard?
---
3. Oh thanks! It always happens when I do a queen run almost several times even
---
4. Server group as in... I may be in server 42 but this Auctioneer bot shows items from server 40-45. Might be out of reach for this game but I’ve seen it nicely utilized in others.
---
And thanks! I thought it was some good feedback and I’d love to see some more raids! The holotape chases are kinda a bust but I always enjoy a good queen run after doing the silo
---
And are you perked out for the weapon your using? I don't mean to interrogate you, I'm just curious. 
---
If you look at any spacesuit visor it really should not have a -2 perception debuff, I have worn a real spacesuit helmet and assure you it doesn't impede my ability to see things even in the peripheral vision, that is how they were designed. 
---
So I completely agree that heavy guns need some loving, but a 30 base damage minigun with Furious or Anti-Armor would *absolutely fucking shred,* way out of line.
---
Sure it'll still break in like 5 minutes (which is what needs to be addressed more, make luck of the draw work for automatic weapons ffs) but it'd be a little too strong.
---
You just know it, they’ll either make them expire every 24 hours so you have to farm for new ones or they’ll make you get out of your P.A to pick a lock lol 😂😂😂
---
Not gonna lie I've abused bobbleheads in the past. As a member of BA (Bobbleheads Anonymous) I can say the only ones that stacked were the explosive ones, I tried leader, caps stash, big guns, melee, unarmed and intelligence, 300 of each at a time. Explosive were the only stackable ones, and it's gone now. 
---
I wouldnt say that people are "snowflakes" but people want the game to be performing better and want fixes sooner rather than later.  Its easy to get caught up in the negativity and the issues but its always good to appreciate the people who are trying their best and keep moving forward even with all the hate thrown their way. Fallout 76 might not be a great game for now but with the amount of work I see them doing I believe the game will get better.
---
LOL yeah because 90% of them were duped. Everyone knows that. Don’t try and be like “oh I worked for my TSE”.
---
Such as? Vaults are already loosely in the game, anything else large they would add is more than likely going to be DLC 
---
No, it was just a confluence of events.  Neither my wife nor I liked the game, and we had been so up for it.  Shame, it looks, still, great, but I don't like it.  I'm an outlier, maybe.
---
Well, not scrapping mods by default is great, but, I do want them to "auto use" "Bulk" supplies!
---
People are reporting that the Fusion Core extractors are back to 0.8 per hour, instead of the 8 per hour they fixed last patch.
---
Sorry I missed your comment. Especially since they had it in Skyrim I feel like it would be easy to put in fallout. It could be a perk. It would also give utility to the otherwise useless perks that improve hip-fire accuracy.
---
Right you dont play stay gone
---
Ah! Thanks for the clarification. 
---
So you can go hammer the scorched beasted.
---
That nylon bag haunts my dreams holy grad, how do you deal with the trauma man? Any recommendations on a favored adult coloring book to help?
---
I never said I need to respec. I never said I wasn’t fine with the nerfs. I feel completely indifferent to TSE from pre to post patch. Stop trying to put words in my mouth. 
---
It sucked because caps farming is boring. I just gave it to someone I play with.
---
Yeah ,also Unyielding set with radicool perk
---
Maybe I'm being generous for sake of my argument about objectivity. Maybe. But it extends to r/fallout and beyond as well. There may be no better example of perception being reality than Fallout 76. "I want it to be good/bad, therefore it is good/bad." That extends to many things in life, and it all comes back to what I said about objectivity. The realist is a pessimist to the optimist, and vice versa. Know what I mean? 
---
niiiccceeeeeee
---
&gt;This patch was a good patch
---
I guess you haven't checked the weight of your bobby pins lately. Whether you agree with the need for a TSE nerf or not, it was fixed via bludgeoning when a scalpel would have done. Nerfing XP gains for legitimate gaming, broadly nerfing effective builds, and COMPLETELY screwing up QoL changes (I'm looking at you, bulk junk), makes this patch just another example of bethesda acting against their player base to slow player progress and hide the fact that they have no content at end game, and no announced plans for additional content within a timeframe that anybody is willing to wait for.
---
I’m enjoying it.
---
As someone who used to investigate and ban accounts in another online game, I would always advise to be highly skeptics of someone who claims they were banned for no reason.
---
I spent three years investigating similar claims and I can tell you the number of people who were banned for ‘no reason’ amounted to a grand total of zero.
---
Yes, I think their goal is to get people to pay $8 and they are tying in game advantages to the items to push that goal. Do YOU honestly think their goal ISN'T to get people to pay them $8 or something? Such an odd comment. 
---
There are much more factor to consider than this basic math. But lets say, they do this. Then some weapons become too strong and others still too weak. So the balance still not fixed. 
---
Agreed.
---
No prob man, I've had this happen to me where the legendary didn't have anything then the normal enemy, even ghouls, had the legendary item or drill if the game wanted to be mean to me
---
That's not why they did it. 
---
I was but then the patch messed up the game pretty hard only right part of it was the nerf the tse even if it was a bit much. 
---
No, there are no people left in all of humankind that are enjoying this game.
---
Does it make a difference if there are? Play something you enjoy. Life's too short to trudge through something that you don't like.
---
I’m having a blast 
---
To be fair, what's customer service supposed to do? It's not like they can crack open the code and fix it themselves. 
---
It's like Sean Murray after No Man's Sky release. 
---
I would hand over complete control to the reddit of course! 171,000 game developers and coders after all.
---
Stop thinking that you know what you’re talking about, because you clearly have no fuckin’ idea. 
---
What about a quest that has a living NPC
---
No. Y'all's constant screeching about nit picky bullshit is just embarrassing.
---
Loving it.
---
How do you love the lore of fallout it Fo76 breaks all of the lore?
---
Exactly! 
---
A couple need to be updated but most probably work fine. You may only have one culprit and might not need to disable them all. I discovered ShowHealth makes you CTD but all my others still work
---
Did you find those plans on a random encounter, or are they sold at a vendor now?
---
But only end game content
---
Goodbye mr. or mrs. entitled.
---
Have you ever played any Bethesda game before or are you just a sad fan of the classic Fallout games who arrived here after Bethesda purchased the IP? Bethesda games are fun because of modding/exploiting/glitching!! That’s why it’s been years and we still see dozens of Oblivion and Skyrim memes. If you get pissed because someone is glitching in one of their games it’s obvious your very first bethesda game was 76. 
---
nope i can't say that i am.  most of my perks have been invested in weight reduction and crafting.  i have only one or two perk cards in shotguns.  none in rifles.  and i'm not sure where the railgun falls in.  love it though.  of the three weapons it was hitting hardest for sure.
---
Poor billy
---
Not true.  I spawned at my base this morning, sat there until the base appeared around me, walked into my main building and then tried to open my pipboy, and the game froze up. 
---
Who would have thought that exploding ammo nerf would gather this much grief.  There are other guns in this game and the game itself has improved with each patch. I don’t understand why people are willing to give up on it because of a nerf.
---
Lol look at any objects in those areas and come back to me thx
---
I'm not so much annoyed personally because the vendors don't really sell any plans I don't have so I don't experience this. However, I will agree with you that the known plan mod was superior in every facet, including functionality. It might be worth considering on Beths part to just buy the dll from him/her and implement it since he/she did it right the first time :P
---
Yes reddit and YouTube knows best! They all have perfect ideas with no logistical issues at all 
---
There's a fair number circulating, but a quest reward melee weapon is enough to wreck everything so there's not much need.
---
I agree with your post, but it seems like you needlessly injected your politics into it due to your severe, undying hatred of Trump. Dare I say it, you may have TDS.
---
It was advertised to have pvp. Mmmmk
---
We could request the developers themselves come onto the subreddit and answer questions to solve this problem but until they do the staff team is doing the best they can. :/
---
balance to PvP, yet ignoring Melee damage and stacking melee bobbleheads....
---
What Bethesda didn't tell us was that the REAL survival mode was having our desire to play survive the updates.
---
Bobby pins
---
Make yourself a favour and go play Warframe, good game, great developer, even better community
---
Too bad it doesn't work if you have more than one character.
---
Most people don't seem interested in buying stuff.  And when they do, it's a pain to actually find them online at the same time, meetup, and complete the sale.
---
Though, I have done it a few times, like a guy selling me like 15 packs of Bulk Springs and me selling some Junk to somebody else another time.
---
Honestly I don't go anymore. I finally convinced my wife that it's not worth it. I can wait a month or two to watch on Netflix. Entertainment industry is garbage across the board these days. I guess I'm a different player. I played over 100 hours in the first couple weeks with Witcher. I don't fault anyone for liking the game, just don't feel there's enough content here to justify $70. 
---
What did it roll back besides bobby pin weight?
---
Red dead online has no content though.
---
rekt
---
I see people downvoting you, but you do make a good point. We paid $60 (well, i did...others paid less) and have probably gotten $60 worth out of it (though honestly some other games come to mind that might challenge that thinking). We aren't paying monthly, so aside from just *wanting* more... we don't really have a leg to stand on.
---
Disagreed. 
---
Why the downvotes? Constructive criticism.
---
86 the entire menu!
---
I totally agree with you.  As of yesterday my hubby, me and a friend who regularly played all said no more and uninstalled. We'll come back if they ever fix their shit and add more content. Were all levels 100+ and have been playing since beta. It infuriates me that they took a game we all loved and butchered it. All we wanted was Fallout 5 with co-op essentially so we could build up the world and fight together. Sorry that they let you down too, your not alone!
---
Everyones doing their best guys, lets all give three cheers with gumdrops and sugarplums on them! Oh god, give me that sweet sweet Karma, just shove it in me!
---
&gt;Please make the chainsaw a viable weapon please
---
Weapon Artisan
---
And the people that defend the game and devs in spite of all the flaws are like Baghdad Bob
---
Well, yeah but I'd like it just because it was a cool feature. Toggle it off if it causes problems.
---
yeah see, I did a lot of socializing once I realized how quickly you could fart through the main games content
---
yes I just used the word fart as a verb and will not apologize for my flatulent jokes
---
i know this is a bash bethesda thread but imo varied gameplay is not really a negative, that was probably my favourite mission
---
Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed. She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and thumb in the shape of an "L" on her forehead.
---
#RIPFO76
---
I should really go play kingdom hearts but god damn is this entertaining. So many posts on rising from drama queens that are *totally quitting the game* forever lmao. You’d think Bethesda mirdered their families with how upset they’re acting. It’s. Hilarious. 
---
I don’t know, ZeniMax has done a great job with Elder Scrolls Online, why would they let a bunch of newbies make a multiplayer game? Doesn’t add up 
---
Yes, it's a very different game.
---
I feel as if I would have all the requirements for this damage in place for about 4 seconds--just long enough to 1-shot a weak ghoul scout. 
---
but that's why i like fallout out, feeling like a god by the end of the game it has been this way since fallout 1 (start off weak end up godlike) now it's start off weak end up slightly less weak
---
Quite sad, ain't it ?
---
No it doesn't. 
---
I saw a post on this same sub yesterday that read "Bug fix, Bug fix, Bug fix, Nerf, Nerf... Where is the content?!?!?!" 
---
No one can ever make up their minds! Y'all just want more shit to poke fun at and will never be satisfied. 
---
I would make a bug free version
---
I think if the game is to have any chance of surviving, the first thing they need to do is communicate, the more detailed patches are a nice step, but if the game has any chance they need to come out and give us information on what they're working on, what ideas they have for the game, and from there slowly start actually working with the community instead of taking more steps backwards by adding a longer grind. Most of the things they have implemented have been put in to lengthen the grind of the game, and ti won't last. 
---
So go into options and change it under controls, that's the beauty of playing PC, you get to decide the layout of your keys. 
---
There’s a mole miner inside Bethesda? 
---
What was so OP about my two shot Missile launcher?
---
She'll let the devs know.
---
See you in 2 months
---
I agree, prior to the patch my TSE made certain fights way too easy.
---
[Absolutely](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/al3bfg/shame_the_scarf_clips_through_the_hood/?st=JRJK3KHX&amp;sh=21938b3a) 
---
Do you need something or are you just adding your unwanted comments? 
---
Oh, I have gripes. :) I just see your point.
---
It’s fixed...but just bearly. 
---
I am not finding any combat armor plans anywhere. Not even Light which I already know.
---
I'm level 140. 
---
I was until I completed all the quests the game had to offer...now I’m just farming for mats to maintain my character and unloading ammo into enemies only to be disconnected right before they die. Or the loot they drop is terrible
---
&gt; Next the are going to nerf melee because now that is the over powered weapon that is on the rise.
---
Ofc they are, you can still stack melee bobbleheads atm...
---
I'd like to speak to the manager.
---
With the exception of bobblehead weight, every single issue stems from online. What a fucking terrible idea that was. As predicted.
---
This isn't a game. It's a pure and simple moneygrab.
---
I cant go home when my electricity is broken that is normal cos of Scorchbeast constan attack. I am useing code door and live in cave where only entrance is barycated.  
---
So I have to travel to nearest train station get needed material scrap bulks and travel back to be able repair door and go in...  
---
I am also Heavy weapon user so crafting of ammo is crucial. So I need to scrap bulks and craft ammo... U know what I mean sure F.UCKING ANNOING
---
I saw it I’m a lvl 3X Stealth rifleman vs lvl68 legendary mutie doing rose quest.
---
Took awhile but handmade and sniping faster then he could stim, finally worked.
---
Welp, everyone is quitting the game so problem solved?
---
Sure you don’t have a mutation? 
---
I haven’t noticed anything too extreme. 
---
seeing how the hunter/hunted doesnt get much attention as a pvp option. I doubt survival will get alot of traffic. Perhaps the first few weeks, and it will slowly filter out.
---
F it, the pvp in this game is very poor (In terms of mechanics), compared to other pvp first shooter genres. Although, it's a good alternative to interact with in certain situations in the fallout atmosphere.
---
More pve content benefits everyone, rather than just the pvp playerbase. 
---
Lol no. 
---
Fix melee too. Fix absurd high damages you can stack from various things.
---
&gt;But there shouldn’t be any reason these guns feel so much weaker against the exact same enemies as Fallout 4.
---
So Fallout 76 should have same system as Fallout 4? No soft level cap. Player level NPC enemies. Yeah that would really work great on open world online game.
---
A dork is a whale penis... I wouldn’t touch that goo if I were you.
---
Bro I feel you my shit's not duped either stuff I get I gather around off random power armors I usually try to drop an appropriate set for the person's level I'm trying to give it to they're not 25 they're getting some pimped out raider armor
---
I love how everyone has a side and an opinion... and everyone is getting offended by the other's OPINIONS. Lol this video game is TEARING US APART.
---
Kinda funny, no dev response...
---
I think they know their game is in trouble, especially with now the hardcore fans (including me) frustrated and giving up on the game. Bethesda needs to seriously wake up because right now, they have lost a long time fan.
---
I have some rants if you’re willing to trade. About tree fiddy.
---
Mines always been like that. I have to stop and drink all sorts of stuff every half hour. This was since launch. Havent booted it up since the patch tho
---
I’m not crucifying you, just looking for discussion. And the reason players went for explosive build is because it was over-powered. It was appealing and really fun/cool looking, but when in a nuke zone, any greedy player with a explosive weapon could ruin your fun and your frames. I’ve seen countless posts and had my own experiences of explosive shotguns killing all the ghouls in a Whitesprings nuke zone in one shot. They were too overpowered. Especially relative to missile launchers and launchers. 
---
I’m personally glad about the nerf because I feel like I can do other types of damage builds, not just default to TSE shotguns. 
---
Yep - just reloaded FC5 in advance of this Evil Twin thing in Feb. Gotta love sweeping through as a new toon using ALL the weapons you gathered the first time around :)
---
Good. Vats is already damn near mandatory unless you want to do much lower DPS.
---
Yet, here you are 😂
---
Yeah but in that you just spend some gold and you get all your points back to spend on whatever. A complete overhaul and it really doesn't cost much. It just allows you to try different things without having to spend hours respeccing if you don't like it/ wanna try something else 
---
Yeah but that's because they didn't want to make the game too easy, now they're dumbing it down. It's sad, this should've been a good game.
---
They pretty much ended up giving up on making a exploration game with other elements added in and went for the “base building survival game” trope with some exploration and other elements added in.   
---
Overall the game is still very lackluster. If you want a base building survival game with exploration and other elements thrown in check out Subnautica. Is even recommend AC: Odyssey and Horizon Zero Dawn for exploration over NMS.   
---
Thanks for the mercy lol. I just get super annoyed at comments like that.  It did but I don't own a TSE only a few two shots and a bloodied exp bp pistol. The pistol is just sad now and the two shots even worse except for the combat shotgun which is still ok I guess. Demo perk is kind of useless because it was for that one pistol. However I still like playing so ill be ok. Back on the grind I guess.
---
If you think this sub is an accurate representation of all the fo76 players I’ve got a bridge to sell you. I’d bet a majority of players don’t even use Reddit. Shocking I know. This sub fosters mass hysteria in record numbers. 
---
Hold my beer!
---
They pulled off the weapon balance thing really well, with weapons feeling effective, yet a need to progress to more powerful weapons is always present. Which is what I feel this game should be like, whether that be through upgrading through crafting or looting mobs
---
Have you seen the power user perk? Supposed to slow down FC decay
---
Wondered if it was still available 
---
Thank you very much...problem solved by unbulking.  Cheers!
---
They've deserved condennation for months. Most of the people on this board have some kind of Stockholm Syndrome relationship with the game.
---
People complaing about "Bethesda broke my TSE" lol or how they cant dup anymore lol
---
LoL, the only think taking a break will accomplish is you are going to miss out on the fun that is left before the game gets balanced. 
---
this happens in every online game especially one that people say is a mmo, when its not a mmo. 
---
I'm with ya. 
---
&gt;if you build your character correctly
---
Hard to put that on people when the game changes.  People *were* built correctly for their play style.  Now they're not, through no fault of their own.
---
&gt;Why is "early access" bullshit?
---
Early Access is Beta Testing that you pay to get into.  10 years ago they let you do it for free.  It's a marketing ploy.  The convinced consumers it was a privilege to pay for you to work for them.
---
Brilliant marketing.  "Hey, how about we sell the game before it's ready and get the kids and consumers to do testing and pay us for it?"
---
&gt;The only people "losing out" are the insane assholes with no life who grind whatever newest video game for a hundred hours a week, 
---
The irony of someone calling people assholes for playing a game to much but jumping on paid betas... Sorry, I mean "Early Access."
---
I get that. It's tough when you are leveling. What you use is up to play style. My shotgun load out looks like this. 
---
-1 rank shotgunner
---
-1 rank expert shotgunner
---
-1 rank master shotgunner
---
-3 ranks skeet shooter 
---
-3 ranks enforcer (useful after the patch to cripple the enemy.
---
While skeet shooter, and enforcer, are great utility cards you still need to invest in some damage perks or you'll just be singing the enemy.  
---
"I'm quitting the game!  Good bye forever!"
---
\- keeps posting.
---
What a privileged comment to make, that helps in no way, whatsoever. 
---
Its different, power armor has much more damage resistance therefore breaking slower since the damage being taken in is technically less
---
It’s somewhat okay as is. For now, although all these bugs and exploits need to be fixed. I would love to see a re spec option and more things to do. Also more focus on coop. 
---
I consider the complaints to have been largely blown out of proportion by people who didn't have the shiny best guns out of jealousy. I mean you could see it in the posts, people claiming anyone who had a TSE got it from a duper, or was a duper themselves, and deserved whatever "punishment" they'd get. Now the posts are the same laughing at the nerf and mocking people because they think they've had some moral highground, when in reality it just fucked anyone who did it legitimately 10x as hard as the people exploiting. 
---
Requiring mod support is just sad and goes to show how incompetent a company can be. I always appreciate modern fixing games for us to enjoy, but this should never ever be a requirement, like it is in Bethesda games. 
---
It was exploit if you did it intentionally. And 47 turrets is pretty great.
---
Dumbfinity and beyond
---
I'll just leave these here. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx5U4dFI_I4
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVjQczD567Q
---
Yeah, well, some folks missed that. Good lookin' out
---
Because the nerf wasn't necessary. There are so many things broken in the game and the Dev's focus on the Atomic Shop and nerfing instead of fixing the countless broken things like crashing, disconnects, dealing with dupers once and for all and just simply fixing the broken things. 
---
What do they do, they nerf, patch unnecessary things and introduce countless new bugs.
---
Still worth that $60 to me bugs and all. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Power leveling was *not* the problem. Duping isn't even the problem other than its affect on server performance.
---
The problem is a complete lack of content. It's a giant map, which is cool, but it's so damn empty. 
---
Lmao who do you think this game was made for? 
---
Was the fallout community calling out for a online game? Nope. 
---
Did Bethesda think they could make a fuck ton of money out of casual gamers? Yep. 
---
I don’t think the hardcore fans were or are their target market. Of course they are going to keep making the game easier for casual players because that’s who they want to buy/play this game. 
---
My friends and I are just going to wait to see how the next patch goes. We won't be playing it until then unfortunately. 
---
Yea I’ve seen some of the YouTube vids and I totally agree might just have to wait for outer worlds 
---
for me all i get when turning on the xbox is a black screen
---
Which features?
---
Yeah, I ended up dropping a whole bunch a while back in a train station. Lost like 10 lbs. Not sure why they weight so much. Then again, bobby pins weight 0.1 again so...
---
At least you understand that without action this means nothing, but that's one thing the game has going for it. Good community managers.
---
All I was saying this whole time is that melee weapons are not as good if you don't spec into them, no melee mutations, and no perks. Yet I can use a SMG also without perks and it'll fare much better than a standard sword without perks ever would in close combat situations. 
---
Then again, I'm good at aiming and seldom use vats until the game starts lagging, in which vats is better in those situations. I didn't even state anything that could be wrong in the comment you replied to, it was just my opinion of what a game's melee system should look like, and opinions are just that, opinions. 
---
Yeah you’re still just guessing. 
---
Tell that to the people who nerfed TSE into the ground 
---
I don’t call +15HP “better stats”
---
I don’t see the team benefit of +60 HP significantly turning the tide of battle in 4v4 pvp. 
---
It’s a *weekly* effect to promote their atom shop. Marketing. 
---
Yes, you are paying. Winning? Not exactly. 
---
Ah, I see. Well, thanks for the heads up
---
I’ve been playing this new update for maybe an hour, camped at whitesprings and the first thing I notice is the ledge beside the pro shop which used to be a great platform for killing two dozen Gouls when they mob you, now they have figured out how to climb up on that flowerbed that used to be high and dry for most part.  
---
I dunno if gouls learned how to climb or they realized players had a fighting advantage and just removed it. 
---
Yes! That would be a great idea! If we could get even a few questions directly to the devs or they can fix/work on a few things we suggest each week would be great!
---
Just the other day, after I logged in and finally got past the load screens and black screen, I spawned in dead. Apparently there was a supermutant shopping cart turret that was blasting my body the whole time I was still watching loading screens. gg Bethesda
---
That's the problem. They don't prioritize bugs that only seem to affect some people, no matter how bad they may be. So the minority has to deal. I dealt with at the very least one bug a day that made it impossible to team up. Every single day since launch. I've lost faith they will ever fix Social bugs at this point.
---
See I'm  not a scrub that relies on OP builds.. Which is why I'll never bother to go through all the hassle to get my melee up to 10k. 
---
If they nerf melee I'll EASILY AND HAPPILY go back to my stealth sniper build. I like it better. It does SUPERB damage w just a Non legendary rifle. Only thing I hate is ammo farming. Can't wait to see what my 1* armor pen one does. Oh hell if I ever get a bloodied one. I'll be a hell of a lot safer then melee. Lol my 1*bloodied pistol gets up to 275 damage. Pretty sure a bloodied lever action will get to 350ish. That's fantastic. 
---
I'm sick of running around w no health. I didn't dupe to get the best armor set so I die, often. I'm constantly farming stimpacks now instead of ammo.
---
So, it won't bother me 1 bit. Not at all. 
---
I agree that some (not all) TSE's were overpowered. Like you were saying, the shotgun. That thing decimates anything in its path. they simply could have removed the TS modifier on all TSE weapons making them just explosive. I mean, if you get shot with not one but two shells that explode in one shot paired with the stacking and perks you won't survive. The two shot paired with everything made it unstable not the explosive itself. I agree with many of you guys and disagree.
---
Those repair costs though......now that they nerfed White Knight.
---
speak for yourself before making assumptions ty
---
Nerfed like everything else
---
last night I server hopped a bit in Watoga for mods, and more often than not, Phoenix was nowhere to be found. I had to run around the streets looking for him. Once, he was behind Watoga high school, another time, he was on the Northern side of Watoga in the riverbed, and another time, he was having a gun fight with a robot on the complete other side of Watoga. I had to run all the way over there to kill that other robot ( who was 6 blocks away inside a building) before I could trade.
---
Before this patch,he would still get attacked, but you could usually talk to him before he runs out of the building.. and he never seemed to stray that far
---
Yeah, but range is a big hindrance, you can't blitz to enemies like the old days. You have to get up close and risk damage. That's why it's fine the way it is. High risk, high return.
---
But their pay comes from the same pocket, the pocket that could pay someone to help fix their game rather then pay someone to make atom shop items, that’s an issue to me. 
---
NMS was pretty to look at but just a painful, tedious grind trying to find resources you need for the next step, and managing limited inventory. It’s the only game I ever bought and got sick of so fast I took I back to Gamestop to trade in to try getting some of my wasted money back. I heard good things but I really don’t get how anyone can stand it.
---
Yeah D3 loot table on launch was atrocious, clearly they wanted you to spend all your time on the AH/RMAH instead of actually killing demons for loot. So glad they removed them, made the game actually good. 
---
Up or down boats do not matter
---
But wait until they add micro transactions...then what?
---
This is an outstanding idea and then it would create a default road map for upcoming fixes reduce workload for Bethesda and create better quality content which everyone wants please Bethesda save your game do this for your fans
---
And tbh, PA is honestly not even as viable except in nuke zones due to the legendary perks on armor 
---
They dont. We do it all the time. People are too afraid to hit us back
---
The only thing keeping me playing is the C.A.M.P. system. I absolutely love building in 76. Now, I can do so much more by purchasing unknown plans. Other than this, I have finished the story; built up my character; collected all three star armor, weapons, and moded my PA; and more. There is literally not much else to do. I can explore more of the world, as I have not yet discovered it all; but I am always being let down by pretty scenery with no story. The only thing that will keep me playing is a good story or single player expansion, but all we've heard about is PVP. In about a month, I'd say, I'll be putting 76 down for good unless they showcase something amazing. Something that'll come out in a reasonable time too. 
---
Scrap everything. Scrap armor, scrap guns, drop all ammo and gunpowder and then make the biggest melee weapon you can. FULL BARBARIAN! GROGNAK!
---
**Fuck that.** 
---
 If you want to support people working in poor conditions that are the result of the companies on ineptitude, then support the government workers that were forced to work without pay during the shut down.
---
 Bethesda wears big boy pants. The PR persons that represent Bethesda here are simply doing the job they are paid to do. They do not deserve spite, but in no way, shape, or form do they deserve to be gushed over. They **do not fix anything**. 
---
 If you are searching for some way to lay out your own emotionally supportive world view on to this situation then you should find a different horse race. While games are entertainment for us, for Bethesda and other games companies this is business. If you want proof, go ask for a refund and see how supportive Bethesda is of your situation.
---
Sekiro comes out in March. I put in for vacation, and I probably won't touch 76 afterward. 
---
Yeah I’m w/OP.
---
you’re saying lvl20 can fight and win against a lvl80?
---
Could you post a vid where a lvl20 geared for lvl20 goes up against an 80, and WINS?
---
it did stop me from doing it,if im ever gonna do sbq it will be with my melee alt why even bother wasting my ultracite ammo lmao
---
I found Excavator at Greg in Grafton I think? I know I saw it on a vendor bot that WASN'T Camden Park. Pls don't kill me for being not as helpful as I could've been lol
---
The nerf has nothing to do with carry weight or blast zones. The nerf only effected how fast the armor breaks. 
---
60 percent is insanely slow with power armor.  If 60 percent  faster with regular armor, then  I can understand the frustration. 
---
So my question is really only about the rate of breakage. 
---
Also interested 
---
It never slowed time. It was a different swinging animation than standard if it killed the opponent. 
---
Ctrl + Print Screen saves a in game screenshot to your game folder 
---
It does work. No one ever attacks me when I'm wanted. They show up, look at me and then leave. 
---
What exactly are you after besides Excavator?
---
Let’s refresh. Your post stated, essentially: “Let’s pretend that whatever problems I’ve personally found to be negatively impactful to my enjoyment of this game (whether internal or external to gameplay) simply don’t exist; or aren’t consequential to merit a value. Now, can anyone tell me seriously, and without any other qualifiers that you enjoy this game? Additionally, I won’t illustrate any other criteria by which this game should be judged.”
---
Somebody responds: “Yes.”
---
I understand the sentiment of your intended argument, but please don’t assume you’ll receive the validation you are seeking, it just looks silly.
---
Let's see how much vats you can get for heavy guns lol. Rifles just have far higher DPS.
---
No because your explosive rifle just got nerfed and ou have 5 str which is a direct melee buff without any mention of rifle perks. So welcome to the club of everyone else who doesn’t understand how melee works and keeps calling it OP.
---
I can agree that power armor lasts longer than it should. I’ve put at least 15 hours on my T51 set and only repaired a leg which only fell to 90% from 200
---
Actually it looks more like this latest patch was built on the wrong version and accidentally rolled back a ton of fixes. The consensus as far as I have read is it is the patch from just before christmas that was released with the nerfs and "balancing" of the game as opposed to the one 2 weeks prior. 
---
Yes every range weapon are now useles. The explosion effect was pretty much the thing to have on you weapon not necessarily the two shot. I preferred single shot explo 50 cal before patch, it was good, not even op or anything. Now it's pretty much a pea shooter after all this nerfing. The numbers were way too high of an nerf. 210% less damaged! It's ridiculous. 
---
Print key. Screenshots then go into the directory where you installed the game.
---
Myself, I would have have spent a good portion of time to weapons balance since this is primarily a shooter.
---
I would have avoided legendary weapons and armor and focused on realistic damage and upgrade models. Alternately I would have modeled damage for creatures in that any weapon can take it down if fired correctly at the right spot. Instead of legendary, I would have designed the gun mods to reflect the specific damage model I needed for the players fighting style and would focus on ammo creation and ammo types to replace legendary effects like exploding bullets and armor piercing abilities (Like in Fallout NV).
---
Leveled weapons I might have designed differently so that any level character can use any weapon with offsets to prevent the weapon from using it full potential until the user reached that level like reduced damage, gun jamming or misfires, etc.
---
I'll give a link really quick to someone else giving a list hold on. This comes up from time to time
---
I’m just commenting that, while I have zero complaints about a lot of the items bandied about here, I like the last bit of your post. It might be more fun for me to run some of that lower end gear, save my PA and higher grade body armors and such for big stuff. Thanks for the idea!
---
Two words. Armor pen. 
---
Cool, I didn’t know if consoles auto matched. I didn’t know they would do like say 10 named worlds with dedicated characters like a lot of MMO, so you always play on the same persistent server when you login. Thanks
---
That's a lot of words for "git gud".
---
Xbox core services are down. Not a bug.
---
Putting baskets on people's heads.
---
The funny part is that you don't understand how games work and that a "bug that benefits the player" is not a good thing if its not intended. 
---
This post is ridiculous. You’re seriously going to praise a PR person for convincing you that your voice matters? That’s literally their one job.
---
Every single time one of you makes a post about how we should not feel *too* frustrated with the horrible state of the game and instead focus on how *amazing* some random representative is, that rep has done their job spectacularly.
---
Stop being so easily manipulated.
---
Gave that up a long while ago. I keep going back because of the nostalgia from the radio songs, but can’t seem to stay on the game for more than a few minutes. I’m just waiting for Starfield at this point.
---
I took part in a post-update queen last night, I think there was 7 or 8 people, I was in the bottom/lower middle of the level pool, and it was dead in 10 or so min.  Lots of gattling  guns, and 1 or two tse.(based on the sound effects and visuals).
---
I'm not saying the need a were a good thing, but it's not soooooo bad as you are making it out to be.
---
Agree 100% that's why I solo all the way .. where grouping does come into play is to swap plans, help someone build something at the camp. My friend built me a red rocket from the Atomic store before they nerfed the fact you can't place it others camps now. 
---
He also set up a stage at his camp and 7 of us got together and played in the band, this was GOLD and a lot of fun, we took pictures, we laughed, probably one of the best times I have had. If he needs materials, no problem, I got that extra 20 copper he needs to build something, this is where the strength comes in with friends. Generally I am not a party guy and sit and chat for hours, but this one guy introduced me to all his friends and I have been having a blast, this is unusual for me ..
---
But where it comes to exploring, looking for materials, I definitely go solo.
---
Also I have had a few friends come to my rescue with griefers, last night I was trying to kill some cryptid's, and this douche comes with his claw and kills it right in front of me even though he saw me killing it, I gave him a big fat thumbs down, so he start relentlessly attacking and harassing me. So my buddy shows up, 1 shots him and leaves, I take his junk to upset me and he continues ..
---
There is time for friends and there is time to solo.
---
it wouldnt be so bad if we had stuff to do while they are fixing bugs.
---
this game launched with almost no content, and it only took a month for me to start struggling for things to do. next week will be month 3, i dont know how long i can hold on. not wanting to abandon my friends is the only reason i still log in
---
Why should explosives be nerfed into the ground while Melee can still stack bobbleheads? Also, the melee guy would probably be in PA injecting stims every time they get so much as poked just because stims are stupid easy to find. That, and the fact that melee gets to ignore more armor a hit so more damage actually gets through each hit. If a Lever action had the same damage as a melee weapon, and both had their related perks for armor pen, the lever action would still do half damage...
---
That's the most sensible thing I've read here in days.  It's a disappointment for me because I can't work and therefore am not able to buy games too often but I just am not going to invest time into a game which really doesn't work very well.  So I step away after only a few days so I'm not wasting my time and getting frustrated.  Life's too short, I've started a new fallout4 character, should be able to get a few thousand hours back in before I can afford RDR2 and by the time I'm done with that, hopefully 76 will actually be playable.  People getting needlessly angry doesn't help one bit.
---
He can borrow some of mine.
---
..,,.,,.!!.!
---
Shhh, common sense is not "IN" right now. Its all about the "Outrage" and "pissy over everything"...
---
I really liked the first one and I don't remember why I stopped.  Maybe I'll login today and check it out again.   I couldn't get into Destiny.  
---
Besides the pvp mode, supposed to get other content also. Not sure if we are getting the Vault Raids then or not.
---
Yeah I was trying to get the power armor station blueprints and excavator power armor but came across a level 39 attack tron glitched in the floor so I couldn’t kill it plus I feel like in that quest they should give us some materials to craft the armor
---
Exactly. 
---
Its more than tse getting nerfed, even though that seems to be the thing op a d a few others keeps latching onto as a reason for the anger.
---
Its people finally getting burnt out on the constant bumbling. Yes there are a few people reeeing about the tse nerf, but for many, if not most of the people angry right now it was the issues finally coming to a head that is causing people to take a break or quit.
---
Melee always goes over 200 without buffs like bobbleheads or chems. It's even higher with mutations as well. Unlike any other weapon, melee weapons damage increases per strength point. So if you have each armor piece with +1 strength, you re gonna do mad damage.
---
I’m sorry that sucks. Lolz
---
But you gotta admit if it happened to anyone else you’d be dying..
---
It’s happened to me too lolz
---
Only once logging off before I died.
---
Definitely this. I've been back on Total War: Empire, CS:GO, and a little bit of Skyrim and it's just a lot of fun playing games that we're made with attention to detail, with a real depth of content. FO76 has potential but right now it's just not there. 
---
Speaking of CS:GO I pre-ordered the game in 2012 and didn't play until 2014. That game took a bit to find its way and I hope FO76 has a similar path.
---
I'm not holding my breath. If an apology were forthcoming it would have landed by now. 
---
I've quit/taking a break.  
---
Got to level 100 for the trophy after having explored everywhere, didn’t get the trophy, which is the last one I need.  
---
Don’t feel like power leveling another character just for one trophy, and I have no interest in farming for the very best weapons, so there’s no reason for me to play till stuff gets fixed and more content added :/
---
Same, freed up 52 gb of space in my ps4.
---
I didn’t really do much selling yesterday since as soon as I hopped on one of my friends told me to get on TF2, but I know that Watoga Station has the handmade plans, and Watoga Shopping has a buttload of power armour stuff. 
---
MIRVs have always been...unreliable, I’m sorry to hear they’re even worse now. Quantum nukas were always bugged to have 0 blast radius. In theory they can hit something if they are standing right in top of the grenade. It’s a bug that (surprise) got carried over from Fallout 4.
---
Since lv1 vs lv 200 is a fear for people, just have servers be for lv 1-10, 11-20, ...51-100, 101+. That should help. Not sure if it should auto join your corresponding server or for it to be manual, so you can go get destroyed by lv 200 people... if you're into that 
---
No dammit, I meant get and equip perks that were for combat, like adrenaline, not running around with lockpick and pharma farma forever.
---
I've been telling people, you can hand select a team of 15 modders and they will fix this entire game in a month. At times I wonder why devs at places like Bethesda and Riot are actually paid to do.
---
A negative public opinion turn around in the only safe space for this alpha test matters.
---
I think the most hilarious (or the saddest) thing about the TSE nerf is just how little understanding or logic went into it. Even if you ignore the big picture reason why TSE weapons are so desirable, the easiest way to nerf it without breaking so many things would have been to just make it so guns cant roll both modifiers. That way you don't get a two-shot, and while you expect this to be 2x the damage, it's only 1.25, and explosive to be worthless (and unintentionally make normally explosive weapons and grenades worse than they already are). They somehow went with the most complicated and worst 'fix' to the problem.
---
The big picture problem is that virtually the only way ranged/guns are viable in this game at max level is to have one or both of these modifiers to out-perform melee weapons that don't have the best 3-star modifiers. In addition fixing the entire class of energy weapons to be more viable should be as simple as increasing the base per-shot damage value and decreasing the durability cost per shot value. Why it has taken more than 3 months without something that simple being done is beyond anyone I think.
---
OCDecorator for Fallout 4, made basically all items (plates, food items, etc) static decorations you could place down. I really expected something like this, but probably on a smaller scale, to be available to decorate our CAMPs.
---
Nope. No decorations for shelves/ tables. Not even sure there's a point in placing them in your base at all.
---
What's the difference? both rifles with full perks,both with hardened receivers,one with 60% more damage from demo,explosive prefix and a TS prefix? Yet the hunting rifle without demo, without the TS and Explosive prefixes does 3,just 3 less damage? 
---
I did notice it, maybe they upped the thirst requirement for speed demon sprinting? 
---
A modest increase in the base stats of frequently used ranged weapons, and a larger buff to unused weapons, seems like a good way out of this.   
---
It's strange when my ranged character switches to melee, saves on bullets, and does similar DPS, despite my special and perks being in ranged. 
---
I don't know, the interaction with explosive bullets was a little too strong, it essentially tripled the weapon's damage output which is actually way too fucking good. that being said the perk itself was NOT the problem.
---
/u/Ladydevann I speak for myself and the community on the whole that we do appreciate you and TheLoneWanderer (sp?) for being out on the frontlines during this. True fans get the flak you're receiving and it is ABSOLUTELY NOT directed to you as people.  You and anyone else on the front lines during this fo76 mess are not to blame. We get it.  Stay amazing people despite all his crap.  
---
I've been in Development for over 9 years now and I know how things work behind the scene.  PLEASE do you're absolute best to bring this next request to the attention of the highest levels of management.  The ENTIRE Reddit FO76 community will back you up to be head of Public Relations for Fallout 76 because we know your heart, YOU WANT THIS TO BE THE BEST GAME EVER. We get it! But HELP us fans get full disclosure of what is being worked on.  What is being addressed?  What WILL be addressed? Is problem X being acknowledged? if so, what patch can we expect it to be addressed? 
---
We do in fact love you but "We hear you" has become a bit stale when yet another disaster like yesterdays patch (the bobby pin weight? bugs reappearing).  Again, YOU ARE NOT AT FAULT. We get that, but I vote that YOU be the foreperson in the PR fiasco because if we hear you say "We hear you" we know it's going to get done. When it will get done and addressed in a way that fixes are being made!  
---
Thanks for being awesome
---
I've always preferred instigating rifles
---
You don’t understand. It all starts with Bobby pins... 
---
(insert several paragraphs that explain how Bethesda is Satan and this game is the MMO equivalent to the fyre festival)
---
If you think of it as a buggy fallout 4 mod that you can finally play with friends and pvp it’s really not that bad. I think what people were expecting fallout 4 x 2 and were highly disappointed. 
---
We have dragons...i mean scorch beasts 
---
And in the present state of nerfing every viable weapon build because melee will be next our only choice soon will be shouting at things
---
I'm not talking about ZeniMax as a whole but the out of touch corporate suites that only see dollar signs. 
---
If you played Fallout 4 for example, and if you noticed the attention to detail when it comes to environmental story telling (that has nothing to do with quests), the research (both historical and environment) when it comes to the Boston area as well and the stylization of everything inspired by the 1960's, as an artist myself there's no WAY you can convince that game (as well as 76) was intentionally released in that state. It just doesn't happen. In a corporate world despite your abjections the suits in the top floor call the shots. It's better you bite your tongue and stick with this project you put heart into till the bitter end of get fired and risk not having any association with it. 
---
Oh hey I was in that group!
---
Good, your 10000 miles away.  Why SHOULD you do the same damage?
---
Explosive nerf is a separate issue.  Not all ranged are explosive.
---
In this case, the revenue wouldn’t go to Bethesda? Or only part of it does? Even that being the case, that makes me want it less if I know not all my money is even supporting the game. 
---
My wife and I are the same way.  About to buy a 2nd PS4 so we can play together.
---
b-but its just a dark cabal of internet haters out to unfairly and maliciously attack Todd Howard, known paragon of truth and the ally of the consumer!
---
Don't start demonizing the managers. They do the best they can with what they know. 
---
Its one thing to hate on a game, but when you start focusing on specific users, I question your motives, judgement and opinion.
---
Fired myself 2 weeks after release. 
---
Melee is especially strong when you stack a few very useful buffs, namely: incisor/str perks, lone wanderor, nerd rage, bloodied legendary effect, and mutations adrenal reaction and twisted muscles.  The big tradeoff is you have to run around with alot of rads so you get the low hp buffs.  Also have to pick a hard hitting weapon like super sledge.  You don't see many complaints about the combat knife or shishkabob.
---
You can do the same thing with ranged.  Lone wanderor, nerd rage, bloodied effect &amp; adrenal reaction have the same effect on ranged.  There are AA perks and mods, and two other range-focused mutations: eagle eyes and speed demon.  Get a high damage weapon like gauss rifle, hunter's rifle, black powder weapon, etc.
---
Stack above listed buffs and you will one shot just as well as melee, without the additional risk from having to go toe-to-toe with enemies while running with low hp.
---
Bonus is adding vats/crit-focused perks with high luck will out damage any melee build in theory anyways.
---
This is interesting, we could even make a list of questions for the developers.
---
The best voted, we look for some way that they can answer them
---
to be able to ask questions and answers to the wow style. the developers keep players informed based on the questions they ask
---
Yep, the new patch reverted the bobby pin weight to 0.1. This isn't the first time Bethesda screwed up configuration management. UFB.
---
I'm the same only with the division 2
---
I can only speak for myself, but I am enjoying this game very much. The most important and most fun part of any Fallout game, to me, has been being able to explore a wide, weird wasteland, and Fallout 76 allows me to do that. Am I happy with everything has happened since launch? No, of course not, but that hasn’t prevented me from enjoying the world and the game.
---
Often QA are responsible for finding bugs, but also are responsible for meeting deadlines that someone else sets. QA might want to regression test, but some manager somewhere is probably feeling the heat to move the patch to production. Especially in a case like Fallout 76 where there are duping problems and etc.
---
QA groups usually have none of the clout and all of the responsibility. They dont make the build that they test, and pressure from the rest of the company is probably intense.
---
* "Mgr: How long do you need to test the new patches and regression test?"
---
* "PC QA: 4 weeks, assuming the Xbox and PS4 QA groups are testing also."
---
* "Mgr: What?! You've got 2 weeks from this past Monday. XBox and PS4 QA are on other projects with deadlines. So your team is doing all platforms."
---
* "PC QA: That's crazy, only one person on our team ever did Xbox platform QA, and nobody did PS4. And all 3 platforms are on different release versions. We would need 3 months to do it all correctly, factoring in some code overlap but also factoring in the learning process."
---
"Mgr: Two weeks from this past Monday. The higher-ups already made the call. Get it done."
---
"PC QA: Guess we're ad-hoc testing with a focus on the most recent bugs only. And brushing up on the ole resume."
---
And the same bullcrap speech happens on the development side too, so they barely have time to knock the code out, much less do unit testing, integration testing, or double checking if they have the right code base. Their scrutiny level ends up being: "Does it compile?"
---
Anyway, there is no excuse for this kind of garbage, but companies do it all the time, everywhere.
---
Lol. Not the answer he was expecting.
---
&gt; the nerf means regular armor goes from never breaking at all to now needing repairs very rarely.
---
Except armor needed repairs very rarely before.
---
Did it with and without woodchucker perk, tried different servers, in and out of power armor. Running out of ideas.
---
If they want to commit to making challenging content and competitive pvp they'll have to
---
Tldr
---
the game became tedious, kill some for example scorched beast or even the queen (massive bullet sponge) I do not disagree with the nerf patch, but it has become tedious enough. It seems that many complain about hand-to-hand combat, it's completely broken 
---
Not anymore, Unfortunately 😢
---
It got better.  Still a lot of the grind though.  It is definitely more fleshed out than it was.  Like, a good example would be that when you bought it there was no exclusion of resources based on progression.  You were just as likely (more so if I remember) to have rare elements you didn't need yet.  Not anymore.  You won't see certain resources until you can travel to them with the appropriate tech.
---
Another difference is in the in game glossary/library and tool tips.  No more guessing what that resource does.  Hover over it and it tells you if it's for trading, crafting, upgrading or any of those in combination.
---
That said, if you found it tedious before, you probably still would.  It would just take you longer to get bored of the tedium as it's much more streamlined now.
---
aside from ultrawide support, and bobby pin weights, what else was newly broken or re-broken? 
---
This needs to be toggled. I prefer the way it was, it worked fine.
---
Please don’t give into the whining, some of us like the current difficulty of fighting the SB. 
---
Beta was a preview, hmmmmm I think that’s exactly what a beta is?
---
I did, but there's just been nothing to look forward to. I play Star Trek Online as well, originally on PC and now on Xbox. I've had maxed out characters for a long time, but I still go back and play because there's new missions every 6ish months. There's new gear and ships coming out regularly. You have to grind and work for a lot of it, but it gives you a goal. I played the same set of missions a good 3-4 times to get a full set of gear. In Fallout, I could fight the Queen 4 times and never get anything I want or need. There's no variation, no mission replay, no anything. 
---
You agree that Bethesda is “pretty bad at fixing issues”. That is literally all they have to do; fix issues. And they suck at it. You said so yourself.
---
What else is there to care about? What is this “good” you speak of that Bethesda does that should matter to us?
---
You see, I'm personally a fan of gameplay that's faster paced and higher risk. This patch may have balanced things for pvp but it doesn't fix the the core problem of the game being a slow boring grind. For me, the ideal 76 would be like my modded fallout 4 game where everything does 10x damage compared to the base damage values. Then for pvp I'd have the damage values completely separate from their pve values so that they could be properly balanced for pvp scenarios. Also, the game will always be pretty easy as long as the enforcer perk exists even without two shot and explosive weapons. But the reason that bethesda can't really make a high risk high reward system is because of their AI. It's garbage and doing so at this stage would make the game even easier than it already is. Like, I'm not sure about you, but 95% of my experience was just figuring out how to cheese the AI. Basically jumping is your ultimate defense because the AI is too stupid to reach you in certain areas. At no point during my gameplay, neither low level or high level, did I feel like I was being challenged, so when I finally got my two shot explosive weapon at around level 80 I was just happy to finally be killing things at a pace that felt acceptable. So in conclusion, I want enemy buffs, not player nerfs.
---
&gt; Honestly I think over exaggeration is what is making this game and its community so toxic but that’s another topic
---
Yeah, its basically what happened with the main fallout sub when fallout 4 came out, which caused fans of the game to break away and create /r/fo4. Same thing happened with this sub, only the negativity followed with it since  there was far more "outrage" with 76... now most of the people who just casually play and who aren't wrapped up in behind the scenes controversies have had to break off with yet another sub to get away from the negativity in this one. 
---
Like... yeah,  the game is rough and there are lots of things I want to see improve and done differently... but there is a massive difference between critique and wanting it to improve so you can enjoy it and simply searching for reasons to bash the game. Also contrary to OP's declaration, taking a break from a game is really no big deal and doesn't have to be a public spectacle. Getting frustrated or tired of a game will always happen at some point or another even with games you love. Not to mention I would bet good money that at some point in the future OP will jump back in with little regard for his current frustration, but we won't get a front page worthy rant post about that. 
---
Funny thing is I thought the atom store stuff had been done well before the games release and was just on a static timeline for release in the store.
---
Guessing this specific sub has a lot of younger players that have put tons of hours into the game, play several hours every single day and haven't played many other online games like this to know how these things tend to go.  It's a big part of their lives and they spend a lot of time thinking about it.
---
There another Fallout 76 sub that seems to a lot more casual and calm.  Guessing mostly older more mature folks who only have time to play now and then.  Much cooler heads there.  They point out the games problems (of which there are several) but don't start screaming at the top of their lungs that people should be fired when an annoying bug creeps back in.
---
Anyways...it depends on the sub you visit I guess.
---
So you had... a challenge?  I know that's a novel concept and unfamiliar territory for TSE users but get with the program, man.  You're already specced for rifle, just get a level 45 gauss rifle and you can take them down easily.  With my vats/crit build I can drop them with less than 10 shots.  And you might even have some fun when you don't kill massive enemies with a single pull of the trigger.  Or instead you could just complain on reddit
---
claiming workshops is pvp. 1 person starts a claim to take it from you, while others in group find you on map. they kill you. i just recently had this explained too. no notifications of detail that this is how it works.
---
just don't claim workshops.
---
Didn’t realize a part of a sentence means “the only thing I mentioned” 
---
i mean, 3-4 months is plenty to finish all quest lines in fallout 4 and to explore every corner of the map. not saying content is better or worse, just pointing out that a few hundred hours sunk into a game usually means you've exhausted the game of things to do.
---
i'm also a guy with over 2k hours on Skyrim, more on Oblivion, and way more together on Fallout 3 and New Vegas. i've even made my own small mods, etc. i totally understand the lackluster feeling of fallout 76 because i probably wouldn't have played it as much if it wasn't possible to play with friends (i.e. singleplayer).
---
but i just wanted to point out that there is a possibility you're viewing older games through rose-tinted glasses. after heavy playing, 3-4 months in of fallout 4, i grew bored too. and i didn't boot up the game for at least 3-4 months. but over the years, i've played it easily hundreds of hours. just not all back to back.
---
I think the big issue was they needed more time. Fo76 seemingly was pushed out to get in on the holiday buying.
---
But the big issue is even if  they pushed it back to... lets say feburary or march then it would have to compete with games like anthem.
---
Its just one big ol clusterfuck.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/  Much better community there for people enjoying the game.  They still discuss the same bugs and stuff, but its handled civilly from what I have seen.
---
You sure that wasn't exposed when they had a livestream with Logic, Ninja, and Rick &amp; Morty?
---
I always took them being bats, with echolocation, as the reason you can't really escape them. They could hear my heartbeat or minor movements, and given that they use a sonic attack that disorients you (arguably blinds you), they can attack from just about anywhere and mess you up.
---
Game should’ve came out in March then....
---
Probably misplaced the old version.....
---
I've got 1 point in Luck Of The Draw and almost never have to repair. 
---
Meh.  I'm taking a break until new content comes out.  Giving up though?  On a great game I've spent many hours enjoying?  Nah bro.
---
All Rise is a quest reward from the Watoga mayor chain.
---
It is a level 50 super sledge with 90% weight reduction.
---
Every build should be using it as a melee sidearm.
---
&gt;It's not that TSE shotguns were  overpowered, it's just that explosive shotgun builds are easier to deal with. Point at enemy, click, it dies.
---
Yep, totally not OP, just "easier to deal with". 
---
And that's totally true, compare to TSE gauss rifle, you might had to charge it before releasing, to oneshot some stronger enemies. It's so much more difficult to press a button and keep it downpressed for a while, only then releasing. Much easier to just point and click.
---
&gt;There are somethings that melee just can't handle that well but you don't hear melee players saying, "No fair, we can't hit Scorched Beasts with our current build we don't want to change in anyway because this is how we chose to play!" You just don't hear it.
---
I think it's because melee is OP as fuck. So why do you think it is? Melee players have more balls to face the challenges Fallout 76 sometimes gives to them? More skill?
---
&gt; This has left an awful taste in my mouth
---
Spit, don't swallow 
---
I agree, this is like the "Jar Jar Binks is a Sith Lord" fan theory, making Episode 1 semi-digestible.
---
1. Player healthpools should be 135% what they are now. 
---
2. Never nerf melee, it needs to be a 1 shot kill in pvp. 2 shots max. I gotta run up to you taking bullets. Theres no gap closer.
---
3. Adjust Npc healthpools and armor ratings so 2 or 3 bullets from whatever the new meta is takes down a lvl 68 bloated one, deathclaw or whatever. I wont notice the difference on my melee.
---
4. Cut SBQ health in half. 
---
I should be able to sponge 3 to 4 shots from a good player build if i am charging them with my hammer. (PvP) end game ranged dmg should be 2+ shots to kill a player. 
---
How many times can you shoot me while i charge 50 ft in an open field?
---
Pvp feels nice now that TSEs are gone. Im having more fun.
---
Last night i racked up a 500+ cap bounty , slapped on the manta man costume, blasted smash mouth (allstar) on area mic and ran around whitesprings getring chased by players. I had 40 stimpaks so i could spam them, turn corners, jump on roofs. It was a blast. Took a group 15 min to kill me. In the old days id be 1 shotted in a matter of seconds. 
---
Pvp is better after the patch. Pve issues can be fixed by focusing on changes to the npc enemies. 
---
Your comment hits a hard truth that someone at Bethesda needs to see. Out of all the rants and ravings this is the honest truth of what’s left of the game. And that part was to “easy”? I haven’t even bothered logging on since the day before the patch even because I knew it was headed this way. All we needed was fallout 4 online but this is disgraceful and awful for everyone 
---
no AOE too ,so if you get swarmed gg
---
Thank God. It shouldn't have been that high in the first place. Everyone bitches about how broken the game is, yet they cry when Bethesda fixes something that is broken that they like. "So many bugs! This game is broken! Fix the game! Wait, why did you nerf my broken gun?!?" 
---
You get ~800 every time you do the quest
---
You can't keep buffing everything.  It leads to power creep.  At some point something needs to be nerfed. 
---
Exactly 👍
---
I wasn’t trudging over it just discussing 
---
You realize the mod they were talking about was for 76, right?
---
I enjoy it too, immensely. But even I have to admit there are a few serious, fundamental issues. If not with the game directly then the developer and the way they're handling things. . 
---
Agreed. Extremely entertaining quest line.
---
it's only gonna be explosive bobbleheads, melee still stacks.
---
This is literally the only Fallout game I have not loved. Very sad what they did to this franchise with 76
---
Why are u nuking for? 
---
It’s typical reddit overreactions, people looking for some answer by posting an over dramatic “I’m quitting” post and pretending that someone actually cares about it

Speaking of Mistress of Mystery, what perk cards, if any, help the 10mm submachine gun?
---
The irony when you do exactly what you accuse them of doing.
---
If they shouldnt be adding atom shop content then what should those people be doing in the mean time? If they don't have the skillset for big fixing, then they would literally just be sitting idle. So it really is no different if they keep doing what they are doing vs sitting idle because what they do has no impact on the bug fixing.
---
Looks promising. Thank you!
---
A demo should be a preview.
---
A beta should be for testing and finding issues to fix.
---
Explicit, actual information. Failing that, an explicit, actual explanation why we can’t get any real information.
---
I was an undying supporter that pushed back the haters. At this point, I don’t care anymore. This game is an inexcusable shit-show.
---
I'm not so sure. In my experience if I try to melee someone they're dead in less than a second. I haven't even had to break into my phantom devices. But in all honesty I think that's more of an issue with the slap damage system. I get to face a whole new world of strife in the 'survival' mode that is planned.
---
Also, thanks for the input. I may not be able to give you a meaningful reply to your subject, because I'm actually not sure what CQC is.
---
To save space in your stash??? How are you defending this bug? 
---
I thought I got banned tbh.  
---
So you're just after all the plans for other PAs? Phoenix I believe has all the plans for all the T-series PAs.
---
what levels are your characters
---
Writing like he's some great revolutionary trying to change a country when he's just ranting about a game is delusional, lol.
---
It's deep end stuff. As a former mod of /r/ForHonor, this sub definetly is acting like how our users did before. We just haven't reached the point of trying to sue Bethesda and brigading every single thread on Fallout 76 on different subs, or harassing the shit out of mods with death threats.
---
Kinda funny how this sub was made because /r/Fallout was so negative. Y'all are the same exact shit with a different color.
---
I dont think you understand that the bobby pin revert to 2 patches ago isn't bad just because it's an annoying change, but it means that the devs don't have any manual code checks or automated version control or version merging implemented, or they just don't use it. This is a AAA title from a AAA company but it's being developed completely incompetently from a technical perspective, and not just a game design philosophy perspective. 
---
I'm also having problems with some of the more basic plans I know not showing up as known when looking at vendor inventories.
---
I have found a workaround that will at least let you access your offline Xbox games. Turn the console off. You need to unplug your wireless (or take the ethernet cable out of your Xbox) and then turn the console back on. Disable the wireless functionality and stay offline. Right now if you connect to the internet (and subsequently Xbox Live) the dashboard will be rendered completely useless and you'll be signed out of your profile and stuck at a black screen.
---
Ranged 10000% needs a buff.
---
I seriously doubt anyone would argue w that.
---
Nerfing melee isn't the answer. Thanks for being rational about it.
---
They absolutely should rework some skills to give more damage to guns. Or add food etc. Adrenaline rush and adrenaline reaction already work on ranged. 
---
Melee will always have higher damage though due to having to get into.... Melee range to do anything.
---
Pretty much been the way it is in every game ever. 
---
Some of them seem to already do this. Take Poseidon for example. Once someone is in the proximity of Poseidon, the one hour timer triggers. Let's say this person is only travelling through, resource gathering, etc and leaves the area. I join the server, see the event, and fast travel and join. From the vault it costs ~10 caps to travel there. Well, I get there, and the timer has 6 minutes because it triggered on that player being in the area. Waste of time and caps. 
---
I feel like they just need random event starts and when it starts a timer is shown on map. If they try anything else, they'll probably make more issues. Maybe a pop-up menu where if it's a proximity event and no one has started it, you can manually select to start the timer.
---
I'm a hypocrite, I know. 
---
It died when fallout 4 looter shooter Minecraft was made.
---
There shouldnt have been such a stupidly big nerf to guns in the first place. If have no pity for melee users. Melee was stronger than most guns pre patch and is now stronger than all guns.
---
Bethesda clearly wants a WV full of Power armor wearing, sledgehammer wailing players.
---
If thats the only viable weapon, fuck this game.
---
I hate melee with a passion bc i just love to snipe and really dislike Bethesdas clunkyness in CQC. 
---
Close quarters combat
---
Bethesda Studios please.
---
🅱️ick
---
They'll probably nerf Incisor. You know, so its in line with Tank Killer.
---
Same here. I mean I only got to level 21 or something like that, but couldn’t play anymore. It just got really boring I regret buying the game. I should of waited, but I had high hopes as I loved their previous games. I started playing smite, eso and overwatch pretty regularly oh yeah monster hunter as well. 
---
Same here, I really want to keep playing but Bethesda doesn't want me too it seems.
---
Im Sitting on a mountain of junk. Im melee. I dont make bullets. Got 200 ballistic fiber and 400+ of everything that matters for me. 
---
Sorry for your loss tho. 
---
does anyone get the infinite loading screen on PS4? I was good for about a week after the last patch now its once an hour
---
Funny, my 3 buddies and I killed her last knight in a group of around 12 in about 2 min longer than normal, so about 10 min. Wierd huh.
---
I have posted just a couple FO76 things on imgur. A few upvotes, but many immediate downvotes. I'm talking like, downvoted within minutes of posting. As if the very idea of someone trying to enjoy the game is offensive. I get that a lot of people aren't thrilled with the game, but no need to hate on people that are trying to just have fun. :-\
---
Probably a deliberate move on Bethesda’s part to make everyone hate melee now. There is 0 reason for them not to make bobbleheads un stackable. 
---
Tse shotguns were the problem. Why not nerf shotgun base damage. And/or nerf it's range. Tse rifles were barely keeping up with melee. Now there's nothing keeping up with melee. 
---
And no don't need melee now. You can't keep nerfing. Give us better options instead.
---
 1.make it so we don't have to server hop to farm legendaries. Don't nerf server hopping, add in a better option(look at Diablo 3 rifts) 
---
2.add in more legendary effects(or unique build specific legendary items or mods to increase build variety) there should be at least 10 viable end game quick farming builds. Even before the patch there was 2-3, now there's 1(melee) 
---
3. maybe allow multiple prefix effects on a single piece. (Assassins and unyielding together for example)
---
4.maybe make regular armor effects stack with power armor or add in legendary power armor/mods. You could balance this with a weakness to power armor (such as a weak spot or something) 
---
We need something to keep us coming back and nerfing is not the solution. Don't balance pvp and pve under the same rules.
---
explosive perk is what made guns viable, now we are back to what it was like for the first month of the game when everyone cried that they couldnt use anything but supersledges
---
even if you can kill enemies with guns, you have to burn through a lot more ammo and weapon durability so it becomes a massive chore... one you can avoid just by getting the power armor from the storyline and just rotate supersledges
---
They're working on a fix that's coming this week or early next week.
---
Same could be said about rockstar and all the literal game breaking bugs we see so many videos of.
---
No game will be bug free or even remotely bug free, they are vastly more complex then you realize.
---
You mention the Hunting rifle. Are you using it from stealth? I am killing level 68 scoreched conquerors with the crown (boss hp) in 2 shots from stealth, and my rifle isnt special. I only use the hunting rifle or the lever action rifle from stealth and I kill those with 2 shots. And I only have rank 1 rifle, rank 1 expert rifle, level 1 master rifle, bloody mess 3, and adrenaline 1.
---
What is the %discount for each charisma point? 
---
A beta is a trial, a test.  It's used to find issues that can be fixed before the final product is launched.  If the beta was used for anything, it was as a stress test for the servers.  There are many bugs that were present in beta that are still in the game.  Simple things that could be easily fixed.  
---
"Sixteen times the detail"
---
"You want me to shoot the cook?"
---
Critism =/= screeching
---
What went wrong with the fallout , is that they rushed to be able to invoice more money with the atom store.
---
Lol..fax
---
Dude you're so cool, real nail biting commentary here.
---
Items degenerating over time is a staple to survival games. Fucking Minecraft does it, one of the most popular survival games in the world.
---
Upvoted. We need to keep this up.  It's not just a matter of being weaker.  They are ridiculously weaker. 
---
A prime example is the ultracite gatling laser.  This weapon adds insult to injury for heavy weapons users.
---
Obtaining the weapon at all is a grind.  First off, you have to get lucky and have the plans drop for it at an event. 
---
Then, you have to gather the materials to build it,  some of  which are  fairly rare. 
---
No, I'm not asking for it to one- shot kill everything, but this weapon is marketed as a rare end game weapon. 
---
I would expect a rare end game weapon to make high- level enemies feel less bullet spongy.  3-5 shot kills would be fine.  As is,  a level 68 scorched required OVER TEN SHOTS with an ultracite gatling laser with charging barrels. 
---
That's ridiculous. 
---
And it breaks insanely fast. Also, with all three levels of power user, it drains fusion cores ridiculously fast. 
---
I will definitely go for that as soon as I'm level 50. The weight is why I currently stay away from that as a weapon. Thanks for the info! 
---
we can share game licenses between multiple accounts on the same console as long as the owner of the game has designated that console as their primary. 
---
If its a play anywhere game you can run 3 copies of it with 1 license as long as it has cross play (sea of thieves)
---
What isn’t broken?
---
I mean they were overpower as F so yea I think it needed to be addressed if they ever want it to be balanced.
---
I like the idea of heavy weapons being tied more to PA. I'd even be cool with them making bear arms contingent on being in PA. I would also like to see clarity as to what heavy weapons are as tesla rifle is under heavy weapons when crafting but rifleman, commando, and shotguns depending on configuration. I'd like to see the tesla rifle given a bit of weight, a dmg buff, and put under heavy weapons reguardless of configuration. Same with the LMG and gauss, give them to heavies. Disclaimer: I know I'm biased and too close to the situation;)
---
If it can do 10,000 damage, yes. No build should max out above like 1,000 at the very most. 
---
Bethesda’s rep is definitely hurt with me. I’ve gotten every game that’s ES or fallout ever so I mean, this was a major letdown. I pray that elder scrolls is single player, and not dumbed down even more then Skyrim was. Honestly I hope we get more of a statistical game like oblivion with some of the ui and gameplay elements of Skyrim. But idk if I’ll even preorder the next fallout title in all honesty lmao 
---
Bet this is one thing that will be fixed shortly.  I wouldn't panic about it.
---
&gt; they even worked a lore friendly reason for the shut down into the game.
---
I'm gonna hazard a guess and say that the FF universe(s?) are all a simulation and the guys running said simulation took it down for a month. I know it's way too close to the reality of the situation to be what they went with but I can't possibly think up another way they could make a logical lore excuse for having the servers shut down.
---
They need to change the direction immediately.  
---
Somehow strange bizzare concept was born in their minds.   
---
"Lets do the opposite of what game industry do"  
---
Instead of rewarding players lets punish them ...  
---
Take all the fun and enjoyment and forge it to tears
---
Let the grind will be hell let the rewards will be pitty let them die ...  
---
They're looking at PvP for how to balance, and since melee can still one-tap no matter what armor you use thanks to incisor, weapon damage and melee bobblehead stacking, they do need to look at melee builds.
---
Thanks! I'll check it out in a bit. 
---
I thought I'd commented on this a few days ago. Did you manage to get them to spawn? If you're on PS4 I can try to snag a plan for you. They have a 5 day respawn timer, so it isn't uncommon to run I to an empty bunker.
---
You and me both, friend.
---
&gt; *had* loads of potential. 
---
Just look at the amount of posts of people just jumping ship. Yeah, I think they could save this game, and I'll still be playing it for a while, but the potential of this game was back in beta and before. Every week is 1 step forward and, if not 2 steps back, something like 0.95 steps back. People are getting sick of that "0.05 relative" progress they are making and, with this last patch, blatantly undoing. This game should be *a lot* more fixed than it is and I think you're ignoring certain factors (e.g. the obvious limitations of the engine they are running it on) that literally limit the potential of the game.
---
Yeah, I hope they fix it. I love the game. But let's not pretend like this is just it's some juvenile hitch in the game's long career. They need to totally change how they are approaching it or this game will be effectively dead a few months.
---
I mostly play with my local friends, so I've a few thoughts to share.   
---
It is tough to do the story in a group, but I find that's true of most games with friends (e.g. Diablo). If you skip cutscenes and reading to keep up with your group, you'll miss the story. It's unavoidable. For that reason, do your story activities alone. As a group you should be exploring new areas, doing events, and taking public workshops. When you're solo, do your bureaucratic storage management and story quests. 
---
Public workshops are great for shared junk (and fusion cores). They're more valuable to a group since ownership transfers when someone logs off (or only some of you get disconnected). Hold a few workshops and you'll quickly have more of most resources than you can sell or store.   
---
As for combat, I find most combat easy solo or grouped. I'm rarely risking death in either case. The mobs do increase in size with groups, which I find more fun, but neither is really risky. It's mostly just about how fast-paced combat is and many resources I consume. The only time I find shared loot a problem is with the valuable glowing one flux components. Those ought to be individualized, but we still share a good bit in my group. 
---
Agreed. I think this feels closer to how I thought the game would be on release. I use to be able to blow through locations like West Tek quick and easy. In fact, it's been my go to location while respecing. Though great for leveling it was boring as hell. 
---
Now I have an actual reason to bring my team. Before the patch we would all go our separate ways when trying to gain experience. This was because everyone was one shotting everything. This meant we were splitting our normal experience gained in half as we take turns one shotting whatever popped its head up. 
---
Some of my friends were initially pretty shocked when they saw their weapon damage drop by 500 but after running a couple events they agreed that it was for the best. 
---
This patch essentially brought the game difficulty from easy to normal. No, you can't one shot the world. Yes, you may have to team up or change your strategy. At the end of the day I think this patch has pushed the game in the right direction. 
---
My only hope is that survival will turn the difficulty up to hard. 
---
yup as I said its a rough idea there is also the way the damage systems resistances work with heavier damage weapons able to bypass larger amounts of the protection then others which is why I said it was a ROUGH IDEA to get things started 
---
We maybe talking about different extractors then. I didn't log on to check, I just assumed it was the one near the driveway entrance buy the beacon. That's the one I always have issues with and it always just ends up being those red tanks.
---
With the server group auction house stuff, I get what you're saying now. It might be easier, and I'd rather see, the same thing I suggested on other threads for cross character storage. Just have the auction house a main menu item. The auction servers would only need to read your selected player's file for inventory and nothing would interfere with actual game servers. This would also let you browser the AH without worry of something trying to eat or grief you while you shop.
---
I've been rebooting my console like an idiot, before checking Xbox live status ahah
---
Apples and oranges. That would be like telling a painter to stop painting houses and go build them. That's not how that works.
---
It's just the latest Fo76 patch. It's gained sentience.
---
Well the 3 silos are similar just have alot of ammo,   lots of radaways, and lots of stimpacks
---
And its better to go to silos alone, less robots spawn there
---
Yeah, ideally, a ranged player will kill everything before the melee player gets close enough to attack. Inside buildings melee users have an advantage over ranged.
---
In PVP, I doubt a melee user will be able to survive sustained firepower as they run in a straight line towards the ranged user.
---
People get too focused on which number is biggest. They do not think about damage per second, just damage per swing.
---
I repaired both my armor and weapon last night. What’s wrong with it?
---
This is EXACTLY how I felt during the last patch. Everything SEEMED that the game is really going into a good direction after all and now we only need some new content to keep it interesting.... And yes maybe like ts from 100 to 50 and E from 100 to 50 OR a flag in the file that if a roll is two shot AND explo, the explo effect is only 25% what it is now. 
---
Literally no one asked the demo card nerf, not even the melee guys :D who tf pulled this out.. and the white knight... Why? 😀 It's ridiculous.
---
What is this defending and why you did it?
---
It is stupid, and it is not even written in the game. how could we even think it had to press the mouse multiple times...
---
I clock around 350hours last time I checked. I’m just playing differently from you. Tried sbq twice and decided it wasn’t for me. I bought and gave away the only TSE I used because i felt it actually made the game less fun.
---
We just don’t play this game the same.
---
It comes across as fanboy-ish when you completely ignore all the factual criticism even hardcore fans have had towards the game. Gushing over the graphics of a game that by most accounts are considered bad is a good enough example for me. 
---
*Working in IT is not the same as developing a game, an engine is a tool for craftsmen to build with, they don't make or break games. You wouldn't blame a carpenter's tools if a house fell down, you blame the carpenter.* 
---
Firstly "working in IT" can be ALOT of things but specifically I work in Product design so I understand the product/development life cycle very well. 
---
Game engines literally do make or BREAK games. If you have a poor game engine thats badly optimized then you will more than likely produce a bad game with lots of bugs no matter how good your development team is. Oh and I would blame the carpenters tools if he arrived with nothing but a spoon.
---
The bugs in F76 will not get sorted out as they are literally the same bugs from Fallout 4 from several years ago which weirdly enough were also not patched. So I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
*You say you've supported many games in the past, but here you are not being supportive and going way out of your way to make sure that people who enjoy the game know it's "shit".*
---
Going out of my way is making a ton of articles, posts and youtube videos bitching about F76. I literally replied to your comment because I disagreed with you. Simply that. You think its a massive campaign against F76 lol. Bethesda did that on their own. 
---
I am all for supporting games that are good but I can't in good mind recommend F76 as it sets a very bad precedent for the video games industry as a whole. They tried to hype a game through the roof and sell us a product that was no where near the standard originally conveyed to us. If you can live with that great, but supporting this type of game development just makes gaming worse as a whole.
---
Was in a fight with the SBQ yesterday and we didn't finish her. She went back to full health from 50% twice. I was really unsure if it was a bug or if it was supposed to happen. 
---
Update it’s Xbox live if your online or kn your Xbox turn it off and don’t turn it on till you read it’s safe on the Xbox reddit. Better safe then sorry right now it’s updating consoles and they pretty much only black screen till Microsoft fixes it
---
He's so brave quoting /r/Fallout users verbatism and acting like not supporting a company is a revolutionary concept.
---
God you guys sound like the dudes from the No Mutants Allowed board.
---
Mini nukes do less than all range.  Stop bringing up explosives in this convo lol.  Obviously they were just mega nerfed.   Secondly, as veteran who has shot a 50 Cal once or twice, I can confirm that I would not be running around hop firing it.  So if it's realisim your after then you shouldn't play games with radroaches.   A super sledge is no hammer. It's a god damn super sledge.  My sledge has a super heated buzz saw blade on it too.  
---
Maybe that's what Todd is hitting the devs with, so make it viable in the game!
---
No, that would not be at all feasible. I die due to bugs more often than the game's content.
---
Can't spell BAD without EA amirite? 
---
Praise Geraldo! 
---
Same here haha
---
I definitely crash more on my X than my girlfriend does on her S. She also always loads in faster than me too, which makes no sense.
---
They literally looked only at the two perks side by side and said “Y R deez not same?!” Clearly they missed the nuance of the situation. It isn’t even so subtle to say “nuance” really, but whatever.
---
It’s even dumber when you consider they did it to Licensed Plumber as well. How was that overpowered or even necessary to waste dev time and effort changing? Answer: It wasn’t. At all. Nobody cares. Pure waste. Someone over there needs to have a LEAD evaluation.
---
&gt; Hopefully they get their shit together and make it even better.
---
Why should anyone have to hope for a business to follow industry standards? Exactly how low is the barrier to entry for a game to have a 'can-do-no-wrong' fanbase?
---
&gt; Maybe help the team designated to fixing the game?
---
Like I said, do they have the skillset for that? Are they programmers? If not then that would be stupid.
---
&gt; Or instead of hiring people for atom shop items, hire more people to help fix the game.
---
The people are already hired, so that is a mood argument.
---
Perhaps hatred is due to the fact that they have returned errors that they have fixed previously, or from the inflated prices of the new plans or large number of bugs and load screens in console 
---
I have only had the workshop contested once. I have played since launch and really never see anyone at the powerstation workshops. Why put something in that isn't needed when there are plenty of other options. You have a better chance at getting the ability to combine lower charged ones together to get a full charge than a useless item like a FC recharger.
---
I agree they were stupid and I own one. The game will be balanced more and it has to be for pvp to work.
---
Hey, I'm with you. I logged in last night and had a good time. But this isnt really about the TSE nerf directly. Maybe some of it is. But normal explosive weapons, which were already weak to vaguely adequate, are now distinctly subpar. Fat man, missile launcher, M79, etc. I have reached the point that I'm going to stop lugging my M79 around, its not worth the carry weight for it or the ammo.
---
Then on top of that, they built on some old code so old bugs got rolled back in. Some people (Xbox and PS4 maybe) are having game locks. Apparently duping is back. Bulk materials dont work in recipes. A bunch of other stuff.
---
But some of it is hysteria. I saw someone claim stealth was completely nerfed or broken but for me it was fine. Someone else said bird bones + marsupial would cancel marsupial, but for me it was fine. Of course, all 3 platforms have different release numbers so they could have totally different bugs.
---
But I think for some people its getting to be too much. Especially for console players. I suspect BGS defect frequency and impact are an order of magnitude or so higher than what console folks are used to. I think people are losing their patience. Makes sense.
---
lvl 5 ripper? where?  
---
I bought the plans and could only craft a lvl40 variant.
---
I get more annoyed every day when they can only be bothered to add items to the atom shop and that's it.  If this patch released and they also gave us a new gun, some camp items or anything resembling new stuff with it.  People ( or at least I ) would be less upset.  I'm not saying give everything for free, but don't neglect the people that are still playing.  Reward your current base for stating engaged.  RDO, despite it's issues, is giving away gold bars just for playing.  Fallout 76 gives me nothing but contempt.
---
Dude your post and Comment history is nothing but complaining and asking for nerfs in multiple games.
---
Maybe you should play Farmville or something less stressful to you instead.
---
Literally nothing besides you complaining about video games. Holy fuck. 
---
&gt; You can't keep buffing everything.
---
Except you can with how bullet sponge-y the enemies are...
---
this seems to be their MO,   
---
just like their "solution" to modus duping was to just turn off the other terminals  
---
They are fixing the game now the fucking game been out for like 3 months with a holiday between those three months 
---
12 shots with a TSE shotgun??? Mine is doing it in one to two shots on super mutants. 
---
Bullshit. My regular hunting rifle can take down Glowing Ghouls in 3 hits with sneak critical, and a Glowing Rat with not much more.
---
Look at your perks and figure out what went wrong.
---
This is like thanking your car manufacturer for including a steering wheel.
---
Someone needs to file a missing persons report.  Can a community manager confirm he has entered the office recently? 
---
Point is they reduced it so much on any weapon, that it is no longer viable to go with a riflemen/commando or explosive build. Just call it fallout melee 76.  You can’t do anywhere close to the damage you do on melee. So it’s not balanced.. simple logic.
---
I'm not giving up, but I am taking a break. You're right, they made so many mistakes. One that has annoyed me is the auto scrap of weapons mods. Now they want to address it. This should have been addressed in BETA, especially considering that this didn't happen in Fallout 4. Not to mention it just made absolutely no sense to do in the first place. That's just one of many problems. I will still play though, once some more issues have been addressed. Namely the stash size. This is a Fallout game, a game where players are used to being able to store everything somewhere. Hopefully they get it together. Always sad to see someone go, but at this point I see where you're coming from and don't blame you. They have just made too many mind blowingly dumb decisions . Probably idiots in suits upstairs who know nothing about gaming, ignore the developers, and only care about money without thinking it through. I've seen it happen in other industries enough to see the signs. 
---
You can't fire that which does not exist. 
---
100% the same, dude. Downloading RE2 just now.
---
LMAO 
---
I believe the problem is tied to switching those characters. That you'd need to restart the game when you do that.
---
How would you have fun playing the game if nothing threatens you?
---
Nope. Too busy screaming and not actually playing the game
---
The point is we shouldn’t have to run a stealth build to be able to kill with a gun. 
---
This isn't an airport, you don't need to announce your departure
---
Maybe they are in the mouse maker's pockets....click and wear out your mouse, but it will fix your weapon!
---
All that time standing around waiting for someone to shoot the queen out of the sky finally paid off. You'll now be the best PvP player ever.....well except for that guy with a full set of cavalier armor... he's still better than you.
---
Did you never see the NoClip documentary? Every main studio under Bethesda worked on this. The Austin studio's main job was online and post-launch work. PvP was Todd Howard's push. There is a legit evil look of joy on his face when talking about it in the documentary. 
---
I imagine most of the problems stem from Bethesda building the game up their usual way. Instead of real QA or a beta, they relied on in-house judgement which was never going to catch everything they needed to. They also seemed to rush this out a decent bit, likely trying to make up for money spent pushing the system online. 
---
Lmao you people are acting like it's the end of the world. You know YOU PLAYED on the old patch that the current one is based on and there wasn't this much drama. If the game is broken af they work super hard to push out a hotfix asap. You don't need to give them "another chance" you need to give them time continuously to develop and bugfix the game.
---
Lol. Said the guy flexing back. I have one tse weapon. A 44 pistol I got from a gutsy at awol armaments somewhere in the 400 hour mark of my gameplay. Pre nerf, no other combo of perks and legendary effects could get to the damage level of tse. It NEEDED a nerf. Especially since there's 20,000 of basically every tse weapon ever found on all 3 platforms. 
---
They need to buff or change the way luck of the draw works. The need to press the fire buttons multiple times, while using a gatling guns which, sometimes even have a cooldown time before it shoots the first bullet  is weird...
---
Im probably going to start that if i decide to play again. I have a super low character with nothing to their name besides a baseball bat and a combat knife. I'll keep an eye out for some good builds. But i adore the combat knife. 
---
Could a mod pls pin this or something so we don't get like ten million "Ermagerd it's broked on Xbox" posts?
---
Bobby Pin weight back to .1
---
What a brilliant addition to Patch 5 
---
Shhh they most likely also believe that Bethesda stocks are falling and that this one game will ruin Bethesda when Bethesda has like two games coming out this month.
---
Is it empty though? Finding a note and reading through it gives practically every place a story. There are so many unnamed locations too, usually quite small but you can sort of figure out what likely happened there. I've found a spot I've walked past probably 3 times before and wondered how I missed it.. In the vast majority of games, if you stay on the "roads" you will get to see 99% of the game, in fallout I feel if you only stay on said roads you'll miss 20-40% of it. 
---
Game is 8/10 for me will still be playing for years to come
---
Wide screen support. Bulk items weights are incorrect (not sure if that was fixed in an earlier patch and then broken or just broken in this one). Just some of items I can think of based on all the threads. 
---
All the people asking for caps and gear.  What's a matter, don't like the grind? 😂
---
&gt; to the nerds who downvote me
---
They're probably downvoting you because it's was already posted all over the subreddit yesterday
---
Good post here is the real test of balance - a team of 4 ranged vs 4 melee in an open field.
---
IMO ranged wins every time more so if they co-ordinate on 1 target.
---
You have to understand most redditors are anti-social and hate teaming so in a basic analogue 1:1 dueling situation melee is obviously OP with mutations. If all you want to do is PVE melee is the way to go.
---
There might be 10,000 players on today but possibly there will be only one single 4vs4? Dev's do have a objective viewpoint but maybe you're all using reddit wrong if it's not a team hub seeking other teams do battle and RP with.
---
Probably upset dupers.
---
It's as if everything they touch turns to shit.
---
Anyone using the Disagree exploit on the "FO76 is great" quest will be permanently banned
---
Lol. 
---
The problem is less that they nerfed TSE into the ground than it is that they individually nerfed TS and E, as well as perks related to those, into the ground without giving players perks anything to compensate. I traded for a TSE .50 cal a few weeks ago and knew that it was definitely on the short list for a nerf, but thought the combination would still be useful. And, for reasons prior to getting the TSE, I was specced into heavy weapons and explosives.
---
Now, my 3\* auto grenade launcher (while not great, it's easily the best drop I've personally found) is useless, my grenades are useless, heavy weapons are still subpar, and the only redeeming traits that could make heavy weapons somewhat worthwhile are useless. At level 92, it takes me 3 direct hits to kill a level 23 scorched with a TSE .50 cal (as learned when I went to Camden to check prices on excavator plans).
---
Basically, it's not fun to spec heavily into 2 weapon types that should deal massive damage, only to feel the need to switch to a super sledge for hard fights, despite not having any points invested in melee. And that's where my character currently is.
---
If I decide to divest it'll be in a unique fashion.
---
So I have been a Bethesda fan for years and years (and I still am).  And I'm not even complaining about the content issues.  I like that maybe it's more of an exploring kind of game (like a NMS).  However, as a amateur developer (and I'm using the word amateur very loosely), they need to be taken to task on how bad the game runs.  The game locks up, doesn't render content (not folks bases but I mean it doesn't render Whitesprings) and just runs poorly.  I'm sorry as a developer, they did a horrible job at either designing the game, not updating the engine, not performing true/effective IV&amp;V/QA or all of the above.  
---
Gameplay boring?  That is an opinion.  Running shitty.  That is a fact.  
---
With what content? I'm just curious. We've done arenas, traded everything there is to trade, know virtually every recipe and plan and have already made 3 different characters with different builds. 
---
This is the correct answer comrade.
---
/u/DestinyHunter2018, lead the gamer revolution! Overthrow the chads and Todd Howard clones working at Bethesda offices! Rip up the establishment board by board! We have nothing to lose but our chains and tendies!
---
I never get lucky in games like this so I haven't found a legendary item worth keeping yet so I'm in the same boat nothing in this patch really changed my game play style or that of my wife and son.   In a week or so hopefully this sub can be a fun place again.
---
Cool!
---
This was indeed one step forward. The tiny change to "sticky" VATS targeting is another, one that they didn't even announce.
---
But yesterday's patch had many more than two steps back. The game is objectively being  made worse. No one can possibly defend reintroducing flaws that had already been addressed, like the bobby-pin weight. No one can possibly defend broken vendor robots in the Enclave. No one can possibly defend the breaking of the un-bulking function — a crucial aspect of weight management that has been completely glitched by Bethesda's *incompetence* in both coding and QA.
---
&gt; Point is they reduced it so much on any weapon, that it is no longer viable to go with a riflemen/commando or explosive build.
---
It's better than a regular base gun... Are you seriously not understanding this? Any TSE weapon is factually still much better than its basic counterpart.
---
Oh god the horror they made a mistake and patch 5 was built on a older version of the game its a fucking bobby pin get over it 
---
Same. I owned three workshops last night and no one attempted to capture any of them. 
---
Based on every other post on the sub about people leaving the game, I'd say they already introduced permadeath mode into 76
---
Thanks for the update! Respect. 
---
I’d rather have a not so perfect game now versus waiting another year for perfection but that’s just me. Bugs an all I still enjoy playing.
---
The developers who code aren't the issue. Management is.
---
This is the same problem I'm having. All my games and apps work correctly, except 76.
---
I have to do a hard reset to correct this.
---
and after all that trouble, if only I was doing some dmg with my lvl 45 minigun, TSE, which does 37
---
Bulk items are like that, I assume, because it’s related to the mods getting auto scrapped. 
---
Well are you accounting for the fact there are videos of people using melee to 3 shot the queen, the less people the less health and armor the queen has so if you factor for how much better melee is relative to it you see how bad it is. Also I crunched the numbers and with my proposed changes it would still be less damage on tse than before for me with my build I'd deal approx 1.2 k per shot instead of 1.3k with a tse lever action. If a flat 25% buff on rifles I'd deal around 900-1k per shot witch I'd still take.
---
But Jetpack doesn't exist for excavator :/
---
Even if that is the case...
---
If you enjoy the game play it. If you do not enjoy the game don’t play it. Everything else is just fluff
---
It's a huge pain in the ass collecting materials to make ammunition for your sledgehammer though, isn't it?  And all of the screws and springs it takes to keep that thing humming?  
---
Trust me, I know the feeling 
---
I'd say the mistake was made when they released an unfinished, buggy product that they can't fix. 
---
Nah, I just want the game fixed and balanced.
---
sounds like they need to have all of their major branches take a pause on starfield and ES and bail bethesda austin out
---
im sure they want to focus on big moneymaking games, but the absolute state of 76 is unacceptable at the moment. their reputation depends on fixing this game, people are going to be afraid to buy anything else from this company unless they can prove they can fix this
---
What would you use turrets in nms for? 
---
Division 2 for me, but I hope we can fist-bump in our separate hopes for the future.
---
Not working for me.. Menu appears, when I hit the home button, but I can't interact.. 
---
Ugh. Wonder if it’s affected by the same bug that made the Broadsider shoot straight down when the player aims only slightly lower than straight ahead.
---
It's balanced. No ammo needed, just a lot more healing items. Don't need a stimpak if you hit them from 100 yards away. And if you get swarmed by enemies you have to hit them one at a time no AOE damage remember? So you're taking even more hits. Stimpaks are expensive to craft
---
I understand the frustration and expectation, but 200+ hrs of entertainment for 60 bucks is a more than reasonable value.
---
Ive played plenty of 5hr and 10hr games that cost 50 or 60 dollars, had 0 replayability, and no one complained about.
---
I get the bugs, glitches, and general disappointment bc the game was over promised. But putting it in to perspective it's not like anyone was "robbed" in any meaningful sense of the word. Especially when most other games these days are locked behind a monthly paywall. I put more hours in to eso, but the per hour rate was higher (more than half the game is locked behind eso plus membership).
---
I'm not telling ppl to not be dissapointed or upset that fo76 has glaring issues, but the vitriol is hyperbolic if put in to perspective.
---
"gimme free stuff or I'm gonna scream"
---
I'm not a part of your system!
---
Fixing the game is a gesture. They could just say fuck it and shut down the servers for good for all the shit they get. The Elder Scrolls Online was a train wreck at first. Now people love it. Why can't people like you just give them more than a week to have everything fixed and stop whining for free stuff?
---
Yo dawg, So we heard you like rushed out unverified patches
---
So we added a rushed out unverified hot fix on top of your rushed out unverified patch
---
Hope you are happy ?
---
They just lifted my ban. Im never leaving. 
---
Im the goddamn voice of reason around here
---
I nuked it, Rose survived....
---
Not a mod, but I'm trying to reply to them as they come.
---
you’re exactly right. we kept it alive because we wanted to and we had hope. ik i shouldnt quit because of gun nerfing and im not, thats just the straw that broke my back. im to the point where i literally only get on for the social interactions with the friends i have made on the game. lately we’ve all been discussing which game we will all go to next so that our friendship stays strong because 76 is clearly on the brink of death.
---
Building off of that analogy, its also like people complaining that the sick dog isn't a cute little puppy like they would ideally prefer.  Two weeks after the sick dog passed they are still standing around pissed off that they didn't get to play with a puppy and directing their pissy fits at the sick/dead dog and its owners. 
---
A copypasted shack with an at best mediocre piece of writing is not content.  
---
Unless you're Bethesda Game Studios.
---
It is a strange shape. It seems highly uneconomical and unpractical.
---
I thought it might be somewhat based on some old thing that might have been built in -50-60 when everything seemed so abduant. A little bit space age.
---
Right. As in one last dude still playing.
---
All melee perks, bloody mess, 300 damage instigating war drum, still not one hitting scorchbeasts. My brother has an even more powerful melee build, still not one hitting queens...there is this thing called, exploitation and item stacking. Which might give you the false sense of all melee builds are OP. The truth of the matter is, nobody is original or makes their own builds and just follows someone else. So everyone EXPLOITING because that’s the trend in this game, can one hit a scorcbeast. Not a legitimate player.
---
Oxhorn streams it all the time on youtube 
---
Same could be said of this comment. Or the 80 other bullshit posts I rig through on this sub over the span of an hour or two. 
---
Keep in mind, my main character in fallout 4 with survival and I loved it at first, but I would concede that once you get a reliable source of food and water little more than a chore so I totally get the feeling
---
It’s a simple value fix. It isn’t like they aren’t aware. It’s part of a massive list of little fixes they never address.
---
Sound like you got your money’s worth. Bye
---
Or just like...a free respec when a bunch of perks get changed.  
---
Honestly, I think what you are saying for the most part is correct and it makes sense.
---
That being said they should not have released the game in the state it was released in, they should have either dedicated more people to it to reach the deadline, or have extended the deadline.
---
Now having failed to do either of those things, they should have dedicated more people to fixing the game. They have once again failed that.
---
max demo and go ultracite ammo, It will make you feel great again :D
---
&gt; they are trying to rectify the situation
---
They seem to be trying to create endless grind with little reward. Maybe, on paper, that works with their business model. It sure doesn't work with players.
---
I can't up vote more than once but yes! 
---
&gt;. And I would put money that the foaming mouth breathers wouldn't be near this upset if there wasn't a duping glitch
---
This is a big part of the problem.  
---
If the game functioned as intended, then you'd probably encounter someone with a TSE weapon once every three months or so. 
---
Thanks to duping, you go to Uranium fever in hopes of getting legendary gear and there's a douche there with a TSE one- shot killing everything in sight, preventing anyone else from getting a hit in and looting the corpses. 
---
Which brings me to another point: it's an insanely powerful weapon and I think Bethesda would assume that players would save them for insanely powerful enemies like the SBQ, scorched beasts, maybe mirelurk queens. 
---
Using them for regular use to kill regular enemies is kind of ridiculous. 
---
I have a TSE minigun and it's only used when the queen comes out because I really don't see any other need for it.
---
Durability and weight management make 76 a slog sometimes. I'm hoping those issues are resolved sooner than later.
---
I had this strange bug yesterday, the damage on my shotgun kept dropping, When I relogged it went back to normal. 
---
That’s what I’m saying in the post, that the Austin had the hardest job of handling the problems we are complaining about most, but if it is literally a retrofitted Fallout 4 code then how hard do you think each studio worked on this? 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I know all of the studios worked on the design of it, it’s a huge world, but they did not collectively work on the online portion of it, or the bug fixes post launch, this game has been put out to pasture already and I believe the only reason it exists is to stress test the online functionality of the creation engine. There is still glimmers of good gameplay to it, but there’s no vision or innovation to it, they even chose West Virginia since it was an easy area to replicate using the same rehashed assets from Fallout 4. So what you say about misguided/bad management I can also agree with you.
---
And one of their fixes made me unable to scrap them, it's like gee thanks. Had 20% of my budget wasted till they patched it again.
---
Agreed. I was in Whitespring this morning and two hitting everything I cam across with "All Rise" and 3 slugger cards. My Tesla rifle with 9 rifle cards took roughly 4 times the hits.
---
Perhaps the answer to the TSE is not to allow Two Shot + Explosive?
---
The fact that we're even talking about Betas four months after release is a testament to how much of a colossal failure this game has been and how little Bethesda gives a fuck about us. I'll be on Resident Evil 2 Remake, I uninstalled FO76 last week.
---
You use your time wisely, I see.
---
Well I'd like someone to be fired.
---
Have patience
---
Yeah, they are all DPS junkies who want to be the man or Chris Kyle. Melee had to take damage to give damage. Long range gets bonuses for sneaking that Melee loses in a mob scenario. I played for 3 hours last night on PS4. No drops no problem. Bulk glitch seems like how it should work in the first place. You bulk to sell not to store. Whatever... I'm glad other players are on level like above and OP. 
---
Sucks that you’ll have to sell everything but your socks to afford things.
---
Literally three months out fucking entitlement at it best uf it's not fixed right now it's dead to me 
---
Yes. I. Do. 
---
Do you understand that they reduced the damage so much it’s basically useless ?
---
I certainly didn't get my money's worth 
---
You dont have to for weapons with quicker reload. But the hunting rifle in particular is most effective with stealth, crits, headshots, or some combination thereof. But a combat rifle, radium rifle, assault rifle, and a handmade are all pretty good with non-stealth.
---
But in general I agree that they need to improve lots of weapon types.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Could imagine that the unintentional bug with bulk is aggravating but we all knew the needed TSE nerf was coming. Still have fun with mine, ha
---

4. This is a strange lighting glitch or bug when the light and shadow in the adjacent areas are displayed differently. It looks like a patchwork. As if some shadow details are not loaded properly. And the border between such zones is very sharp. This bug spoils all the fun of gameplay. Because I don't know how the game suppose to look actually.
---
5. Ticket number 190128-000976. It is closed now. I tried almost everything. No result.
---
I'm just an old terd sipping his tea 
---
If that's the way you see it. The way I see it is Fallout 76 is a huge beacon to the video game industry saying 'Look how incompetent you can be and people will still pay you and thank you for it'.
---
You'd be doing the same if you loved FPS games and every studio was just pumping out 'FortLame' battle royale clones because guess what, those games you enjoyed playing aren't going to get made anymore if the lowest common denominator is happy to put up with complete medicority.
---
It's time to pause, I've also been since the first days of beta, but there's nothing left to do, since the beginning of January I've stopped playing, waiting for some news of new content, but we have to wait  I do not know why they focused on preparing the survival pvp mode, when the essence of the fallout is the history and the secondary missions   have to wait 
---
Exactly. I couldn't agree more. I have 250 hours put into it and still log on about every day to farm up some weapons/armor to vendor and get my 1400 caps, but what you said about the events is a major issue. 
---
But at the same time, making it free to travel there would defeat the purpose of paying to fast travel - you could just fast travel to the event then go do whatever you actually wanted to do. Yes, you can do that with friends/group members in the game, but you have to be friends or grouped with them first (I regularly send group invites to random people at/near my desired destination, though). 
---
I think you’re misunderstanding the post. I have no ill will against melee or PvP. I’m trying to point out PVE, which is the thing that has a huge problem. 
---
PVP has favored melee since the fireproof update.
---
I'm not a game tester.  I got a real job in regular software.
---
I'm just not a delusional child who thinks "beta testing" is a job, and more importantly, knows that morons like you that play games can't do it.
---
Please, there are plenty of "gamers" in games QA that are fuckwits.  Stay out of it and don't add to the problem.
---
if u can handle the mobs..yes its fine solo
---
Yeah, I'm about there. I already kinda was, but goddamn dudes, how incompetent can you be? It's just a goddamn mess.
---
I gave up about two weeks ago.  FO76 is a game that doesn't respect or understand it's community. Furthermore, they ignore or don't understand what made the FO franchise great in the first place.  The updates have been painfully slow and inadequate, frequently focusing on issues that were non-issues to players.  There's so much better out there to spend my precious gaming time on.  I gave it more chances than it deserved.  I'm done.
---
200 hours is a pretty good time sink
---
And here is the self entitlement I had to deal with for 12 month with Save the World.  I will buy Atoms if they fix the game.  I don't need them to give me anything but a fixed game.
---
I think most people on the subreddit think you're pretty awesome tbh :)  It's just a pity whilst you have your finger on the pulse of the community, whoever is farting these patches has their fingers in their ears.
---
I think perhaps you're looking at FO76 with the rose tinted glasses. 
---
In FO4, there are multiple branching options for you to explore. Three separate endings, and frequently multiple ways individual quests can go. Dialogue is similarly branched.
---
In FO:NV, it's even deeper, with a lot *more* different branching possibilities, giving a desire to replay the game many times just to try different things. 
---
Additionally, FO4 featured the settlement mechanic, enabling the player to build interesting cities and maintain them, creating a different style of continuing gameplay. 
---
Furthermore, FO4 had more than *4 times* the number of quests and other such content to complete ([src FO4](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_quests), [src FO76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_quests)). 
---
Contrast this to FO76: 
---
* number of different branches and ways a quest can turn out: 0
---
* number of alternate dialogue branches: 0
---
* number of holotapes to find and listen to: greatly reduced compared to 4 or NV. 
---
* total number of quests: greatly reduced
---
* settlement-style building mechanic: greatly reduced 
---
FO76 isn't a bad game. It's just not a *complete* game. I'd play it more if there were more things to do. But there isn't. 
---
Well I’ve tried to farm these guns and was able to get one that had explosive ammo but not the other. I think getting both is extremely rare which is kind of odd that so many people have them. If they are duplicates then I don’t really feel bad for them. I have no idea if they are but I have played the game myself without cheat and never found both these perks on a gun or the ultimate one a shot gun. I’m level 110. I’ve been one shotted in power armor though from what I’d assume was one of these weapons. Maybe there some way to get them with out duping that I’m unaware of thats consistent so I hate to say that. 
---
I remember I made a post asking people to share their favorite legendaries they had for so far and even though the post gain some traction not one person linked a gun with both these perks which is kind of interesting. 
---
My enjoyment of this game went way up when I started playing with an Xbox controller instead of keyboard/mouse. I know I’m getting ready to face some wrath from somebody for saying that but it’s the truth.
---
Maybe not necessarily the diehard fans, but those fans that can't seem to grasp that there is a difference between a single player game and an MMO or the traditional MMO PVPers that can't seem to grasp that this game is not a traditional MMO.
---
The game is similar to TES:O in how it adapts the existing single-player lore, except TES:O appears to have been designed as an MMO first while this the other way around; the same sentiment of entitlement is found in both fanbases, though. Each act like these games are supposed to be designed for them, and when changes are made to benefit the entire userbase, these people act like it's a personal affront to them rather than a general quality of life improvement. There are so many armchair developers these days that it gets frustrating visiting this sub and the TES:O subs whenever patches are introduced.
---
I don't want free stuff.  I just want the game to work properly.
---
Of course tripling the team size would bring better results. It’s quite obvious 
---
As much as I hate the posts of “Well goodbye Fallout, I’ll be playing (Insert game title.) until you fix your game!” I completely understand them as of late. 
---
I’ll still hop on every few days for an hour or so just to float around, add to my CAMP of whatever. But I’m not going to be putting mad hours into it like I did the first month or so. 
---
I’m just burnt out right now, I need to just take a break. Maybe finish a series I’ve been needing to finish. Take my dog (her name is Jersey and she’s a very loving golden retriever) for a nightly walk when it isn’t -45 degrees outside. (Also that’s not a joke, the real-feel yesterday in my town in North Dakota was -45 degrees.)
---
Anyway, what I’m trying to say is if anyone is burnt out just take a break. Don’t force yourself to play a game that you know deep down may not make you happy, you’ll just resent it even more.
---
Disappearing. "It just works."
---
Hey hey! Sorry about the delayed response, but thanks for this! I tried just 4LC and its a charm :)
---
To continue that analogy that means that you're one of the idiots who voted for that 11-year-old-vocab man child when everyone who wasn't in the cult was screaming at you not to.
---
https://www.gamerevolution.com/features/349361-toxic-gamer-culture-causes-game-developers-stay-quiet-says-dev
---
I guess now you want to call for a shutdown on 76 completely until TSE's are brought back to make Appalachia great again? Oh look front page calling for everyone to be fired. 
---
Better fire the Anthem team too.
---
I'd imagine you'll be DoS ping spamming them soon, or duping which is the same thing. How about those stable geniuses who complain about not being able to RP vendors after the economy was ruined by dupers already?
---
That's the pinnacle of RP in our community; be a vendor guy. Top tier excitement locking children in concentration camps of non-imagination.
---
I bet they believe in trickle down economics, too. Let's give 150% of our trust and respect to billionaires and cheats, Murika!
---
Who the fuck drinks tea?
---
Yeah. They could have made demo expert not affected the explosive weapons affix and almost left the damage as it was and it would have been fine. (Maybe drop it to 75 instead of 100%)
---
Instead now we just have more *required* perks.
---
Patience wore out when they announced pvp mode for a story game 
---
Wood armor.
---
yeah, everything we enjoy as intended is too OP and not in line with doing chores. as soon as it's mentioned, expect it to get nerfed.
---
Yeah honestly I'm sick of the nms hate. Most people who are pissed off wanted mp and while he advertised an aspect of it he always emphasized it was aimed at sp with the mp aspect just being more for flavortext. I got pretty much what I expected out of the game with some differences but it was the game I expected. And most the differences were changes of magnitude I've seen bigger companies do and not get as much hate. I'm pretty sure the people wanting mp were pissed and when those of us said it wasn't a supposed to be mp they found other reasons we were supposed to be upset. Ones they normally wouldn't have made near as big a deal out of except they wanted everyone upset. 
---
I play on PS4 too, can I have some of your stuff if you do leave?
---
Same.  I was getting bored with the game, and looking for some side quests to do.  Found this and fell in love.   Probably my favorite side quest of any Fallout that I've played.  
---
Game ded according to op
---
Also, don't try and speak for everybody by saying "We".
---
Speak for yourself and say "I want."
---
In all fairness, the story and dialogue is pretty hit or miss, but I enjoy the overall gameplay.
---
I wish....... the odds of getting just one piece to drop are astronomical. Something like 1/2000 for 3* legendary kills. Nobody has a full set without at least 4 pieces being dupes.
---
If you have legendary effect and ammo in mind you should know that this nerf hits EVERYTHING that uses explosive dmg, my explosive build with auto grenade launcher that breaks afet 2 clips and grenades was broken into pieces so what im going to do now running with hunting rifle and tickling scorched queen maybe she will die from laugh .... 30min of battle to spend 1hr collecting junk to fix stuff doing that once in a while is not bad doing this everytime you want to have some "fun" not so much.
---
If your in a party do you still have to tag monsters for XP/Loot?
---
Extreme sentinal bases.  Mind you sentinels aren't really a huge ordeal but it would be cool to have some lasers on my base killing sentinels.
---
Plus animals can be aggro, but they aren't really that much of a nuisance to warrant lasers.
---
The nerf was too much. TSE weapons are all but useless now and sbq is nearly impossible. My build is now completely useless. The game is ruined 
---
That's not called exaggerating. That's flat out lying.  Neither are effective for trying to convey a genuine message.
---
We said it here many times, we play everyday and we see how shitty the durability of all the weapons are, but for some reason they still made a change which made the problem even worst. It really feels like they don't know what they are doing.
---
Had a T Pose super mutie fly up to me and kill me with it's glaring eyes this one time. Almost forgot to mention he was completely neked when he did.
---
Had 15k that I wasn’t doing anything with anyway... with hard bargain I think both were 5,200 or so.
---
Maybe, but I’ve been exposed enough to corporate bureaucracy to know it can cripple every employee’s ability to do anything.
---
Not trying to be the OPs white knight but at this stage in 76 there’s more cons than pros. Not much to praise right now.
---
What with this “loyalty” bs ? Is this a cult or a military organisation?
---
Pompous karma whoring
---
Maybe its a hot day in appalachia.. 
---
I had the same experience as well as my friends. We played for a while and enjoyed it for a while but eventually, we got tired of it. I got tired of constantly getting stuck in things. It was a running joke with my friends that something would happen and I would get stuck on something. Be it a glitch where I just fall halfway through the map up to my chest while fighting scorchebests or somehow get stuck in a shelf while fighting mole miners we finally just got tired of it all. 
---
Year sorry they have rage coming out in may i think qnd Doom at some point this year i expect a realease date at E3 and then all will be forgiven 
---
I am a PS4 player, and what I learned to do was sit tight for a minute or so and let the game load in entirely. I know this doesn't exactly help your situation, but this has always helped me. 
---
Have you tried dropping some junk?
---
Yea I thought that as well. I was actually pretty stoked that there’s a few things on the atom shop I want as well. That new bed is dope and I had been wanting a new one. To bad Xbox live is not working right now
---
Ok...... 
---
1. "You goons".. so now I'm a duper for disagreeing with you? Weak
---
2. I dont dont care all that much about the TSE nerf. Weak
---
3. I'm talking about the ultracite PA plans the we grinded the queen for, not normal server hopping plans. Weak.
---
4. It isn't the communities fault duping got out of hand, if there is an exploit inevitably someone will take advantage period, so it IS Bethesdas fault.
---
5. Yes bloodied melee can do 20k damage I have a build for it, but TSEs doing 1-2k is just outrageous somehow.
---
6. You say you havent had any problems since the patch that makes you in the tiniest minority of player which makes that claim anecdotal evidence. 
---
Fallout game says servers are down atm. Lot of reports of them not working. 
---
You'll forgive some of us feeling as though the topic is a bit of a beaten horse. Though it can be some mixed signals for those first coming into the series. 
---
I do not know what they thought of the pvp, it's totally ridiculous. Those who developed it seem never to have played a current game. 
---
&gt; Dude your post and Comment history is nothing but complaining and asking for nerfs in multiple games.
---
It's almost as if when things are going well I have nothing to add, but the moment things go downhill I'll get vocal. And what, there's one other game that I created a post about how it's broken for a character in a fighting game to have the ability to punish punishes?
---
Who the fuck doesn't? Dis da south. Sweet tea a way of life down here. 
---
Yeah. Xbox is down, it took a quick internetting to even get to the desktop.
---
Yeah i gave up too last patch, I imagine how you guys feel about this one that's 10x worse.
---
You must not be reading the sub. Lot of negative posts and many people with a simular experience to yours. The workshop is a big part of the pvp and claiming one is asking for the pvp people to engage you. Its a poor design but thats how the game is. After doing a few workshops in the begining i realised they really aren't worth the effort. I have way too many mats just from killing enemies and picking up everything i have tagged. 
---
I can tell you the old one works for sure.
---
I know this account is likely flooded with notifications, but if you do see this: This issue isn't restricted to end-game / high-level players. I'm a relatively new player and I'm struggling to keep my guns repaired too. I have to fast-travel back to my base every 1-2 location I visit so that I can repair or swap out my weapons. I'm still trying to beat the main storyline, but I have to spend the majority of my time micromanaging repair resources, ammo, and weapon durability.
---
You're not wrong, and that's what makes the game enjoyable to me. Climbing Tanagra town, for example, was great. 
---
But compare those notes, terminals, holotapes and interesting geography to the ones you can find in Fallout 4. 
---
It's like a quarter of the number. Fallout 4 has 4 times the content, despite having a smaller main map. 
---
*That* is what I mean by being empty. 
---
Once you've found all of those interesting little tidbits there is to find, there's not much else to do. And those interesting little tidbits are, sadly, widely spaced apart in FO76. 
---
I use a legendary weapon with an instigating effect. No TSE.    I do just fine because I have smartly invested in perks. 
---
TSE made it possible to one-shot kill anything with a lot less thought and planning.  So TSE users  are butt hurt about having to play the game like the rest of us have since day one.  Boo hoo for them.
---
An invisible bloatfly killed me slowly while my game refused to fully log out.
---
It worked when it first come out. Now it’s just a weaker frag that weighs more lol
---
my TSE shotgun went from 1200 to 340 damage, it needed to happen, its still fun to use. You just have to aim now, instead of spray and pray. 
---
Yes basic shotgun is pretty strong even without any effects, you could craft a lvl 50 pump with all mods on it and then all the shotgun cards and be pretty good on pve.. but my backup lever is doing 160 dmg which is less than what you get out of NON LEGE modded pump with all cards :D piss poor nerfing decisions.
---
I've only been attacked by one higher player. I've had so many good experiences though. At Level 15, I had a player give me a full Raider Power Armor set. Then I found where someone dumped a ton of plans at a low level train station (which is what I've been doing with all my extra plans now). And I've had players drop me high level guns. That's my favorite thing about it being a multiplayer is the majority of interactions are just fun. 
---
It took Hello Games almost 18 months - years to put it right though and get the game up to the same level of game play as what was promised and show cased before launch though.
---
Would it be acceptable if it takes Bethesda 2 years?
---
Maybe we should fix the gaming community too while we’re at it
---
True, complaining is a very half glass empty way to play.  I’ve stepped back and now looking into other titles while I wait for this one to magically piece itself together or burn down entirely.
---
Heh... Maybe I should give it another go.. I was like you. Bought at release, played it for lika a month and then shelved it since it was just a repetitive drag..  
---
I was still one shotted in pvp with 3/3 fireproof &amp; dense metal chest. By ranged attacks. Tse's and alike. 
---
After the patch its 3 or 4 shots to kill me. 
---
Pve can be fixed with adjustments to npc enemy healthpools and armor ratings.  
---
Leave melee balance out of this temper tantrum you ranged boys are having. (Not that its not deserved, yall got smacked down hard. Ive quit mmos for less)
---
But seriously. Leave us out if it. Pvp balance is now the best its ever been 
---
First hand experience or did you hear it from someone else? Give me some evidence, whatever you can.
---
Well that’s because I’ve two accounts. My main plussed account and my alt account, I long since mastered riding skill on all 12 characters and so when daily rewards started up in September I knew if I wanted to impress people with a level 3 Veteran I had to use my friends and family to set up an alt account. Then I rolled another night blade and decided to finally do all quests in all zone in order of release for the lols. So I’ve two accounts one with 758 cp which I just do crafting writs and another at 342 cp which finally finishing Reapers March before I go to Coldharbour. 
---
this game will be dead by summer if they wait so long lol
---
All but the purple penis man suit was in fallout 4 .. free v.v
---
Yeah. The whole system went down with Xbox Live. Just goes to show how much Xbox Live is integrated into the core software. But your XBox's hardware isn't broken, so don't worry about that. 
---
&gt; And it's MULTIPLE games. Look at his post/comment history.
---
That ain't here, so do tell how it matters? Do you have personal experience with those games? If so, keep your comments about my stance for those other games on those posts.
---
I'm just answering the question "why should ranged have as much damage as melee". My arguement is a valid one.
---
im hoping my suggestions threads get upvoted only because they are community suggestions not just thing I WANT . that is a great idea on making a poll with questions for the devs . i might do one if this does well 
---
There’s no way I’m touching the game again until the stash is increased to at least 3000 since I have about 2000 weight on my character because of the infinite weight glitch. 
---
Isn’t it strange how glitches made this game bearable? 
---
Just saying it looks to me like you aren't having much fun. Wasn't meant as an insult. Just an observation. 
---
With consensual survival in the beginning
---
The losing progress is a bummer especially when you stop mid questline or get a server disconnect. Don't get me started on the server failing to save progress on the brotherhood of steel DMV quest. I must have gone out for junk mail like 4 times
---
It's not speed demon for me. I have no mutations.
---
This is gonna get a lot of hate, but you are 100% right. People will be upset whatever they do. 
---
Sorry you had a bad time there man.  Not everyone is like that.
---
I regularly fast travel to new spawns (aiming for level 30 and below) to give them free stimpacks, meds, ammo, weapons, armor, etc.
---
Not everyone in the game is here to ruin your day.
---
And still have zero reply from Bethesda about my account..
---
Not its not. Take the budget away from the atom shop and move to the bug fixing team and get more people.   
---
Each patch shows they dont do a good job testing their patches.   Maybe more people can help with that.   give us a PTS server and we can test the patches.  Something...
---
Atom shop shouldn’t have even been introduced in this game in the state it was released.  
---
Im not a hater of the game, i like this game, ive defended this game.  But its getting to the point that i just cant defend them. I wont bash them, but i cant keep a blind eye anymore.  
---
Okay so what WOULD prove something or be a reflection of this community?
---
Or is that just auto-vom?
---
That's the joke
---
Yep. After I filled the lighthouse with biofluid, he just appeared downstairs. I was going to kill him, but he didn't show up as red. So I decided to snap a few pics!
---
Same happened to me few weeks back and I have no intention of going back. 
---
Agreed, and frankly I'm waiting for the modding to get opened up so the community can take what's actually a decent engine (aside from perk cards, which were dumb) and base map and start doing interesting things with it. 
---
how in any sense am I flexing? you're the one telling people to play AN OPEN WORLD, SURVIVAL, SANDBOX GAME MEANT FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES properly. I don't even use tse and haven't ever gotten one. it might be bc I don't play this or any other game as if it were my only reason to live 
---
i'm not comparing the two... like i said, i totally understand the lackluster feeling. but after "heavily playing" a game, it tends to become boring. getting boring of fallout 76 is understandable, but i think it's equally understandable to be bored of fallout 4. despite being so, i ended up playing fallout 4 a lot, and over the years racked up a few hundred hours.
---
i think it might be a little less for fallout 76, but give me a few years and i'm likely to return to this game a few times. same as with fallout 4. or any other good game for that matter.
---
the point here is that at some point after playing fallout 4, you ran out of things to do and shelved the game, but you always came back to it. isn't it likely you'll do the same for fallout 76? or do you already know - at this point - that you'll never play fallout 76 again?
---
that's what i mean. like i said, "not saying content is better or worse", i'm just saying the novelty always fades
---
And I’m going to guess that many are bugged. I haven’t even completed the one you get for coming out of the vault.
---
Seriously, I have seen many reappearing Bugs which where fixed in the last version. For example the explosive no damage bug (fast regenerating part of the healt bar).
---
Does a BETA server help if they can't manage their files? They had good, working fixes and messed it up.
---
I would say we need someone at Bethesda who is able to listen, would be very good if he/she plays the game. Balancing is a mess, perk card organization/switching is annoying, everywhere massive nerfs instead of buffs and improvements. Some problems are obvious and simple solutions are possible without consuming more than 5 minutes. Just editing a few stats. I can't see how it's possible to have the same underperforming energy weapons after 3 months. Same goes for weapon breaking after 2-3 clips... a shame. This is a change of a few fucking numbers, no magic.
---
Haha what? Lol 
---
It DOES save space, and an extra step for crafting maybe but try building a camp when all of your junk is bulked.
---
It doesn't work at all for certain weapons; grognak's axe specifically.
---
The problem is you are saying they are responsible for most of the development which is unlikely. Putting the game online and handling post launch stuff is their job. The actual vision and general design was likely still very much handled by Maryland and Todd Howard. Basically you may not be trying to, but you are currently putting the blame mostly on Austin when they are likely still trying to fix shit other people broke with an engine they likely still don't have full familiarity with in comparison to the rest of Bethesda. Not trying to give them a full pass. The latest patch is on them. Its clear they needed more testing and should have waited till next month to release it. They also need a more open discussion about gameplay changes players need/want, especially before enacting them.
---
AWOL?
---
Diapey raider. That's cute.
---
That's Bethesda Studios nothing to do with the team behind Fallout 76. People generally don't associate them with each other and just because the next Doom might be good will not mean people forget about FO76.
---
What are you apologizing for? Not having common sense?  Do you honestly think next time you will research it more or are you doing this for internet points? 
---
I'm almost positive she did, but she cannot force the devs to implement anything.
---
You could just ask yourself what you think sounds fun to do and ignore the meta. You know. Just do you, be unique, that kinda thing.
---
Just don't use Barbarian with Class Freak if you have either Egghead or Herd Mentality as it has still not been patched and will confer no bonus.
---
And a roadmap like FacePunch with Rust.
---
Maybe don't go on the sub about a video game if you don't want to see people talking about the video game and its current state. Crazy idea, I know. 
---
Ok. Got you... you're just trolling. Nvm then.
---
No idea what you are talking about...
---
are you trying to use an empty power armor chassis?
---
Need a longer pause for................Delighted for more horror effect.
---
By the way I’m coming to finish the job my fellow soldiers failed to finish..
---
what, you mean you don't want a pvp only server that not one single person asked for? 
---
The odDs are 1 in 2 million. 
---
1/2,000,000
---
BTW: I have a 3 star bolstering sentinals +1 Per combat armor chest for trade if anyone has a unyielding cavaliers piece. 
---
yall aint worth it
---
I dont think i have the power to issue a refund, youll need to talk to my manager but hes at lunch right now.
---
Thank you. I know this will get blasted but I just want to contribute to the hivemind. 
---
Hey there friend!
---
You can just buy the power armor station in Watoga. After the patch every plan is available. If I'm mistaken though it's definitely at a different vendor but I'm pretty sure it's Watoga. 
---
That's exactly what I'm seeing.  Wasn't happening this way before the patch.  I go in there twice a day to farm.  This morning I had to server hop maybe 6 times to get a version that had most of what I was looking for.  All but one of those times, same thing.  The one time it didn't happen someone else had clearly been in there right before me because one of the things I was looking for was gone from every place they spawn.
---
Then uninstall and go find something else dude. I haven't seen my bloodied melee get over 1,500 so please fill me in on how it's done. And I see the point is still whooshing. So Ima leave ya to it my guy. 
---
Oh and you goons was a generalized statement not intentionally directed towards you, but if the shoe fits my guy, wear that shit. 
---
i completed this last week and got no reward for doing it.  it just said Quest complete and never gave any rewards.
---
Not going to admit to duping that's for sure. And sure as hell not gonna provide a video or something like that as "evidence". But I can say I witnessed it yesterday. 
---
You must be one of those snowflakes that gets upset when someone has an opinion other than their own. :/ I'm sorry about that.  But hey the world is full of us! :)
---
I'm hoping Anthem is good.
---
Then I want a new Mass Effect or Dragon Age.
---
I'm not defending 76 at all either. There are definitely things to complain about but it's going overboard now. And I've always said from day 1 Bethseda deserves all the criticism it gets. 
---
I read your asinine post.   I wish I could get that time back.
---
No it isn't.  Your answer is that it's not realistic.  Tell me about the last time you or anyone in existsnce got hit by a shishkabab?  Or how about that time a guy shot at you with low health which helped him do more damage.  I bet if I look through your post history I'll find you calling for the TSE nerf lol.  
---
Yeah ive been doing this for days with no luck. Just hoping from workshop to workshop taking and defending nonstop for hours.
---
The +15 boost is only going to last for the first few days of February.  
---
But even so, it is a boost, even if it is temporary.  I can see both sides. 
---
Personally, I would prefer that Bethesda refrain from offering store-bought items with boosts, even temporary ones.
---
What is that? A positive opinion about fo76?! BLASPHEMY!!!
---
In all seriousness I wish there was a sub that wasn't filled with so much whining and desperation for upvotes, so us who enjoy the game can talk about it. 
---
I'll be patiently awaiting her pat.
---
Thank you! I bought replacement ones and removed the perk and it’s all fine now... I think
---
Got him, thanks for posting :) 
---
True, but also majority of player has left because how easy and dull the game is. I don't think it is smart move now listen this leftover playerbase, rather should focus on fixing problem that made majority players leave even tho it is against current playerbase wishes. 
---
That would be great if this was criticism. But it's not.
---
Well I've always seen this game as more of a multiplayer development system for Bethesda to test and possibly implement in other creation engine games as a side gameplay. Don't see how this can be so frustrating to people - supose Beth tried to sell it way too high and we all expected a game that surpased FO4 instead. 
---
What the game really seems to lack is an endgame. I'd want event bosses, dungeon bosses, and world bosses, especially at the endgame group level (the only endgame boss we have now is the queen). And of course a lot more quests and NPC's, but that'd also be a lot more work. PvP players would get separate servers from pacifist players.
---
You guys would hate most of my balance changes:
---
* Double enemy damage.
---
* Triple queen damage, but halve queen health.
---
* Halve player melee damage.
---
* Halve perk bonuses.
---
* Double level XP requirements after 50.
---
* Halve the legendary "swing speed" and "sentinel" bonuses.
---
* Cap special to 25 each.
---
* Halve the marsupial height bonus.
---
* Limit camp repair costs to only common mats (no flux/crops).
---
* Reduce weapon/armor decay and repair costs.
---
* Level-up perk cards (except the packs) won't be available until level 50. Instead you'd have to find them through exploration and quests, limit 1 on repeatable quests.
---
* Legendary enemies would be much rarer but have 4x health (so everyone gets a chance to tag them for loot). No more finding 5-10 at once at the golf club. Bosses and dailies would be the main source of legendary loot.
---
* The scorched queen would be guaranteed to drop a 2-3 star level 50 item.
---
If people are upset by the current state then what do you expect? I agree it'd be nice if they kept things to one or two threads rather then creating new ones to give their own take on why they're upset but it is what it is, they can say what they want and people obviously arn't happy. 
---
Yeah cause Bethesda Over Nerfed .
---
It's been done every patch, I say it every time. But some knob end just says it's your fault or you're imagining it and they go for 6 months on a SIP of boiled etc etc :-)
---
There aren't 10.  Maybe 6 and all of them being available in one world is not guaranteed.  Also go to all the military "outposts" in Cranberry Bog.  There's also spots in Watoga with the bags.  There's a couple in Huntersville, one in the vans at Westek, one in the military camp right beside it.  Several at Camp McClintock.  Seriously though, anyone whining about ballistic fiber just isn't trying.
---
Yes, the clown costume can be found, there's a halloween shop towards the north (I think near where it tells you to kill one) that had the clown outfit
---
ikr, and I bet ya bethesda so lazy instead of human  npc they will either have em all dead with robots roaming around, or they will do an overseer thing where they are still alive and only wanna communicate through leaving behind holofuckingtapes
---
Ebayers had their guns broken.
---
Sure, go to this sub a few weeks ago.
---
I've seen people looking for the BOS combat armor upgrades and are unable to find them.
---
I'm guessing the answer to that question is yes.
---
For most of the armor mods other than that, Treasure Maps are your best bet anyways.  Basically free plans and you get a lot of variety.
---
LoL
---
Don't regret it. It's trash and they should be ashamed. They need to put Elder Scrolls 6 on a new engine or it'll be more of the same shit. Just a buggy mess. Not to mention all the other bad decisions they made like about the bag, the bottle, and as far as I'm concerned, even banning people for finding the secret dev room in the game. 
---
That's on them, not the players. PVP is barely even a thing from what I hear. So unless someone does like the bobblehead glitch to Insta-kill you, who really cares? They let mods into their single-player stuff, and this wasn't even that. It was stuff you could get in the game! And not really the problem when it comes to griefers, either.
---
And several other things. Over promised, under delivered. And God do they need a new engine more than literally any other dev I'm aware of. Could even just switch to Unreal because then they'd have better graphics at least. Doesn't seem like they have great engine guys. They've never owned the Frostbite or CryEngine or even Source type of engine. It's never been very impressive. I don't even know the name of it. I even know the name of the shitty Ubisoft Anvil engine for the worst AC game I played. That was more impressive just based on crowd sizes and it was far less buggy for me, at least. I think I encountered 1 stuck parkouring forever bug and simply exiting out and reloading back in fixed it.
---
Cooking Station.  Have fun.
---
No it's right when it hits below half health for all the regenerating legendaries.
---
*sigh*
---
You know, about 8 years ago, most games you bought didn't crash to desktop regularly.
---
That was like, normal.
---
This game is *barely* a working product. I'm honestly astounded at how many apologists defend the amount of basic issues with this game, most of which have been present since FO4 and never addressed.
---
It was satirical idiot. I think nothing should ever be nerfed.
---
How did you do it/ what did you use? Everything I tried was just barely touching him and he just regenerated 
---
i didnt expect MP at all.. i knew what i was buying and loved it.. i got it because it was one of the first games you could go planet to planet with no load times.. thats why i got it.. it was amazing for its time and still is
---
I tend to agree with you.  But if they hadn't announced so early you wouldn't have known what you were missing.  And it would have been a better game at launch.  Being honest it pains me to see what the release of this game has done to the internet's opinion of Bethesda.  It didn't need to happen this way.  
---
Let them quit just give me their caps first
---
That's the exact one he showed doesn't work. I'll link to it.
---
It just reallt do be like that 😔
---
Of course! There is a horror house in the very north. East of the red rocket. The clown costume spwans there sometimes. Just server hop
---
5k caps to trade
---
Destiny 1 had no story. None, literally. Destiny 2 had nothing to do at max level. That is why I compared Fo76 to both of them.
---
Your first quote isn't a direct quote of mine, so I don't have much to say about it. You're arguing that a mechanic that allowed players to simply hip fire in the general direction of movement, safely from the top of a bus or large rock, and one-shot something is the same as needing a build that requires a decent damage reduction and attack to do the same thing in a longer period of time. I can't agree with that. With the TSE build nerf they nerf'd two out of about 60 mods that could be on half a dozen weapons. If you want to discuss exactly what melee needs nerf'd (perks, base weapon damage, etc) I'll gladly have that discussion.
---
As to why people don't complain. Because it's easy. Why complain about simple mechanics when the alternative is more complex mechanics? Both my melee build and my gunner build can run all game content just fine with no struggles.
---
It takes my melee longer to kill things like Scorched Beasts or Super Mutants on roof tops because my gunner can shoot them from a distance and Bethesda didn't see fit to give melee characters a 20-40 foot dragon uppercut.
---
On the flip side it takes my gunner longer to wipe out 15-20 nuked ghouls because I'm not 1 and 2 shotting them most of the time like the melee build does.
---
Neither struggle, both clear areas in roughly the same amount of time, the melee build is just simpler to manage and requires less thought.  Safer should equal more time and effort. Sniper/Stealth build, longest time, lots of effort to position right. Mid ranged shotgun or full-auto build that you can either run and gun or sentinal, less time, less effort. Having to run to a target through hails of bullets, then run to the next, then the next, etc; that's a lot of effort right there, you shouldn't also then be required to go 10 rounds and pop 5 stimpacks per enemy. You make it take more than a couple of hit to take out higher level enemies with melee and it just doesn't become viable. 
---
Try to nerf melee for yourself. Get a lower level weapons, drop half the damage mods (or however much you feel should be dropped) then go to Wes-Tek or a Silo. See if when it takes 4-5 hits per enemy at point blank fixes melee at all.
---
it's xblive, it's down
---
I don't think they fully understood how fast people blow through content in MMOlite games trying to get to the endgame. In a single player game you have no reason to play at anything pace other than you're comfortable with. 
---
Isn't that what fo76filthycasuals was for?
---
I wish I had 4 friends to justify the bonus but they all quit. :(
---
As a Rifleman player, I can even say OP is right, and your argument is not quite as valid as you think.
---
This is kind of right but not quite. It was seemingly never going to be DLC. It was purely a test to see if they could even get it online. The issue is once they knew it was possible they rushed for a full game instead of doing further tests using FO4 and its player base. Would have been a whole lot better had they done so.
---
I already quit since mid December, after some vacations now it's lol time unless new patches comes
---
How is it screeching? You are the one making the claim it's screeching...
---
i disagree its not right in many aspects. yes people need to just stop crying it gets old fast. however it shouldn't be wrong to get hyped over a game. everyone was under the impression we were going to get a full game not the bones of one. the major amount of bitching is because most are tired of the half ass broken games being released now. we pay full price for a game we should get a full game not a beta. the gaming industry is really fucked right now we need companys to perform more like rdr2 fully make your game and take the time to get it right. yes bugs and issues will still happen there's just unpredictable shit, however there's no excuse for a completely fucked game at release.
---
If they have right to complain then we have the right to complain about their complaining 
---
Are they one of the biggest? 
---
That’s what I was about to mention the total workforce
---
I bought conan exiles from one of the monthly humble bundles for 12 bucks. Liked it so much i run a server and have 5 friends that bought it and actively play in it. I personally haven't bought the dlc's  but my friends have and are content with their purchase. Its bundled as 10 dollars and gives you entire new tile sets for your base, Comparable tiered weapons and armor, character customization,pet changes and even some craftable decor. Fallout 76 10$ buying power will get me one floor reskin and most of the way to another. Its clear with the fleet of product marketing that came along with the news of this game that we gave them delusions of grandeur.
---
Do you think a game should provide you with more than 500 hours of entertainment? You have basically played this game as a full time job for 3 months and only had to pay 60 bucks
---
I will enjoy the game no matter what. On A sort of unrelated note anyone else feeling like 2019 is going to be the year of controversy
---
There are multiple board methods 
---
A very dramatic and vocal minority is steering the conversations

I giggled at the image this put in my head. Lol

---
At least we agree on something.
---
They need to be more thoughtful with the nerfs and buffs.
---
Look at League of Legends.  Slight buffs and nerfs to ALL characters during the same patch.
---
Next patch, more slight nerfs and buffs.  Until everything is a viable build.
---
Yes, you can find clown costumes all over. Most outfits in the atom shop can be found in-game, though much dirtier, torn and tattered. You can buy the costume and hat at... Cap'n Kidd's! At Whitesprings or find it randomly in the world. May be a guaranteed spawn somewhere so you won't have to buy it with caps either! Hope that helps
---
I just put "16 tons" on repeat.
---
Careful, you might be called a whiner for wanting features that should be standard for 2018 games.
---
That's a good one!
---
or give a shit.
---
You don't need to defend the company or the game. Just come to the game back **if** they get their shit together.

Ok. So which one is live so the devs can know which one it is and re-fix it?
---
There’s a lot of stuff in the game that needs to be address. I guess the problem with melee is if you nerf it to much it becomes worthless. What they need to do to address that with snares and crowd control. That’s how they fix it in other MMOs. Maybe a weapon that stun or slows you down.
---
Say that when a guy running at you in PA stims instantly every time you get his health to half and then he 1 shots you with a hammer.
---
Bye felicia
---
Most of these players did it to themselves. They broke their own game.
---
Don't worry.  It gets better.  Good luck to you.
---
I understand that. Hood is like a whole other world.
---
The western is also single action so it shoots slower (I think)
---
I agree with that, just as I have the right to complain about your complaining about the complaining... Oh god we're stuck in a loop
---
Same for me! Plus Anthem is a very very hesitant maybe. I’m gonna let the first adopters give it a try and if it isn’t an EA-powered mess I’ll join in.
---
The game is significantly better now.
---
It took about a year for Division to get to a state that could be considered fun. Several LARGE updates, and I think they did a refresh again within the last 3-6 months. The game is significantly better. I still log in from time to time to do some solo play. I'm going to play the wait and see game with 2, 6 months and if it appears to be in a good state I'll dip a toe in.
---
Maybe it's time for the janitor's to have a go at fixing it then?
---
This is what I'm experiencing as well. As far as I know, it's not marking plans that my main knows but my alt doesn't as known.
---
No, the simplest thing that could have been done would be to make it impossible to repair a TSE.  Their numbers would quickly diminish.
---
sorry, didn't know you ran others' lives. I should've assumed that when you tried to tell people to play a game the way you want them to play it. I'm not posting like I'm "hot shit," I need you to understand that you are part of the problem and you are the hypocrite 
---
Sounds like an invisible scorchbeast. Best solution is a server hop.
---
I never paid attention to their blank state.  Other than the carry weight early on.  Once you get some Pocketed or Deep Pocketed equipment though, the STR increase doesn't make up for losing those on Carry weight from your normal armor.  I roll with 5 pieces of Deep Pocketed.  So an empty or non-modded non-Excavator Power Armor reduces my overall weight.
---
I don't recall them giving any defense if you were a blank chassis.
---
Wait... Are you being sarcastic? 
---
*ugh* Eight years ago was 2011 and Skyrim was released. The biggest video games weren't as complex.
---
I'm not an apologist. I am just in the camp of: If you don't like it, stop complaining and find something that makes you happy.
---
Maybe actually proving to the community that something is actually being done behind the scenes, or our problems are actually being passed along. For all we know, this empty PR speak is nothing but that; empty. Start showing us some screenshots of internal emails PROVING that communication between the community manager and the dev team is actually happening, not just supposedly happening. 
---
The current state of this games community pretty much sums up what type of quality of a job the “community manager” has been doing... a poor one. 
---
*like Slocum's Buzzbites
---
Just punched him twice with my bloodied powerfist, just have to power attack, stagger him and then he takes damage 
---
Not being bothered by minor glitches like Bobby pin weights and bulking issues is far from being “cult” like. Not everyone is as sensitive and easily worked up as others.
---
Oops lol thanks 
---
'I bought this rotten meat. I ate it. I didn't die. It is a working meal.'
---
Yeah I think it was the server behaving in a very weird way. Seems to be ok now but given what's happened it wouldn't surprise me if something like this happened.
---
Alright
---
You pre-ordered.  That makes you a fucking dumbass.  That condition can't be fixed.
---
I have little doubt that it will.  
---
Yes, it was a rough launch and had tons of negative press, but everyday I see brand new vault dwellers emerge (my favorite in game interactions are talking to players that are in the high teens/low twenties to get their perspective on the game and it has been almost universally positive) and the developers have been diligently working to improve the game.
---
Well at least you understand your words mean nothing in these cases.
---
And to add, FO76 is a freaking job, I think I work as hard if not harder in the game because it takes so much work to do anything. I never felt like this with FO4, everything in FO76 feels like a chore.
---
honestly though I wouldn't be surprised if that theory would be true when you look at that Bethesda gave it upon a smaller just-bought studio to manage FO76 while their main studios....are mostly idle or idk?
---
The game has problems but I think it has so much potential and if it utilized right it’s going to end up being pretty amazing.
---
Here's something small they could do that would help the end-game boredom :)
---
**Normal AWOL Armaments** \- Hard but doable both solo and in a group. Some chance for death. Crappy rewards.
---
**SUPER AWOL Armaments** (spawns 1 out of 4 times AWOL would come up) - Quadruple the enemy health, double the enemy damage, make it 6 waves instead of 3. Give BETTER 3 STAR GUARANTEED REWARDS and chances at rare plans. You'd have to be high level, bring a group, and even then it would be a tough fight. 10-30 stimpacks later / broken weapons / broken armor, you'd get some nice rewards, and feel justified that you should go farm stimpacks and materials again to make sure you can do it the next time it's up.
---
It should take ONE of your coders a WEEK tops to put this in. It's not changing anything in the event except some variables (health, damage, number of waves, rewards). If they couldn't do that in a week, it's not the coder that's the problem, it's the engine.
---
Easy fast content. It doesn't need to be completely new systems in the game. Find a few content things you can implement in each patch. Metal Wall Powered Doors (so my metal base doesn't look weird). A new random encounter thing (a bunch of skeletons in a circle with a reference to Fight Club). A new event which is basically an old event but scaled up in difficulty. A few new small things in each patch make a BIG difference to player happiness :)
---
Radworms disease is doing something to mutations, like multiplying both positive and negative effects.  If you don't have that, check if you have any other diseases or addictions, maybe others are also messed up.
---
Do you know what would be perfect for this game? make camps close to others, to be able to have our mini cities, at least with 4 friends to be able to make a mini base each with their own camp
---
Having our own mini megaton would be great, it would give a lot of life. We even have some special object in our camp that shows the location of our mini city.
---
It would make sense, it would be to rebuild apalachia
---
Yeah but the costumes are actually pretty sweet.  Finally found something I wanted in there.  Ka Ching for me
---
That's what I've been doing, waiting on this game to be fixed. 
---
I installed Green in the Commonwealth mod and started my first survival game - it feels and plays completely different than vanilla FO4. 
---
No, maga.  But your still a duper. We just agree on one thing.
---
Looking at the entire world, they are in the top 25 if not top 20 biggest, thats with companies like microsoft, apple, google etc taking top spots
---
More meaningless, generic PR speak and more ignoring of blatant issues and criticisms from the community. 
---
And so would their fan approval 
---
Sounds like your talking about guild wars 2. 
---
Honestly every Bethesda game has been like that. Remember PS3 Skyrim? 
---
Probably.  They are usually in other rooms down the hall, across the street, etc.
---
Last night I got stuck going into PA. I had a total of 2 PAs out(had to pick the right one to do work on). Ugh
---
Wow dude get over yourself, there are those of us who still love the game so just like stop playing without advertising, that would be great thanks bye
---
PS4 and PC are different baselines, It seems they screwed up the PC patch more than the PS4 patch. 🤦‍♂️
---
I had previously had an equal ratio of legendaries that dropped nothing and normies with legendaries.  That changed 
---
It's so random. I took workshops for weeks and only got daisy rugs, metal box and metal shelf plans over and over again. If you're on xbox I can buildxbone, or try and hold on to a spare if I get it. I usually dump all my plans in flatwoods,
---
You mean Starfield? I've wondered about how they balance both also. I think they're only publishing Rage 2
---
I'll do my best. What it means tho, is that you can't farm cap stashes any longer, since you can't search the same container twice, untill they reset.also, they nerfed the HELL out of the amount of caps you can find. This also means Cap Collector is virtually worthless now.
---
The blindness is both sides of the same coin. 
---
Yeah, I've just gone back to Fallout 3 again. When the patches do more harm than good it's time to take a step back and evaluate things.
---
K bye
---
Just an FYI....I have not logged into 76 in two weeks. Now that this hot garbage patch came out I uninstalled. Until I have an actual reason to play the game [more end game content] and BGS stops the fucking nerfs and fixes actual issues, it will stay off my hard drive. If I worked on this game I would be embarrassed. Maybe BGS should hire the dude who made Stardew Valley. 
---
Holy cow man, paragraphs, bullet points.  Spread it out :)  I do a lot of TLDR sometimes but I put it in formatted....lol
---
You mean, it did not crash, so its a working product, right?
---
Its literally an early access game with an AAA price tag for now and the upcoming few months. But I do hope, the future is brighter...
---
Melee build gtfo. I have a melee build myself and were using explo weapons for a backup, now you don't have any effective range weapons anymore. Noone asked for demo card nerf. Literally no-one. 
---
Amazing how none of the trash community managers are commenting on the fact people are leaving? Bethesda needs to not waste money on "Community Managers" without looking at other companies and seeing what they do. These fucks don't interact with us, they pretend to. They just hop in and drop useless anecdotes to make us feel better, to act like they're doing shit. Meanwhile they feed us the same bullshit of "Devs are looking at this" 
---
Nah, you've made the game **better** for dupers. The **only** thing that's been done to hurt them is the carry weight cap, and for people selling legendaries on Ebay, that doesn't even effect them.
---
yeah? is that why we haven't seen Pete Hines fucking ass since launch? 
---
You can make adhesive? Why do i not know this? 
---
Been a few posts I believe of people asking for a roadmap of the new content and when we are getting it. Doesnt look like they are ignoring that.
---
Ya I think I've played my higher player right now. Going back to my lower to play around. A lot of people dropping plans now because they know which ones they have :)
---
Yep. We gotsta slow down that damned innovation. Make Bethesda Great Again? 
---
If they used older builds on newer patches then I have to question the ability of their devs. How do you mess up this bad? Where are the Beth Devs who actually know what they’re doing? Bring those people back. 
---
When I repaired my gear last night. It took 2 of everything instead of 1. Gasp. However will I find 1 more of these items. 
---
I do agree with the legendary perks tho. Explosive should've been a primary perk. 
---
But hey, since you're so knowledgeable and good at video game developing, maybe you should submit an application to Bethesda and go give em a hand fixing this shit
---
&gt;Edit: bust out that normal pipe wrench and record a video for me to see how OP it is. I'll to the same with my bloodied shotgun.
---
How does that make any sense? Pipe weapons are the weakest in the game, it'd be a better arguement if you wanted to challenge me with a pipe pistol or something. Obviously a shotgun will beat a pipe but it probably won't beat a rocketed super sledge. Especially if I tank your shots in power armor.
---
Inb4 their "fix" is to make unlocked plans global to all characters on your account (I actually would start a new character for once if they did this).
---
Its what the guy I replied to has been doing for most, if not all of these posts.
---
Well if it is such a minor change then why fucking change it?
---
Having to pick up any number of extra items is fucking grindy. It adds absolutely fucking NOTHING to the game play. By the time you're running max White Knight you're pretty much done with discovering the map so it isn't forcing you to explore it is forcing you to mindlessly repeat yourself. Grind.
---
But carry on stating how effective the change is even though it isn't any more effective but because it "just works". 
---
At this point, I'm over all the damn excuses. This is some shit that should have fixed pre-launch. They need to be making concessions and getting results. 
---
Accurate
---
It's not actually "stealing" ammo.  They are messages that always appear when you fire a weapon but are normally hidden.  Collecting items while those messages are "there but hidden" just makes the message visible temporarily.
---
No ammo is actually lost.
---
You might be surprised at how seriously some folks here take this game.  
---
Think some folks should try going outside more often.
---
Having recently restarted and just reached level 20 on my third play-thru.  The high level helpers need to make themselves known before they destroy everything and leave the low level with a reward, but no challenge of the event.  Random encounters are great, but I do not want everything cleared for me.  
---
On the other hand, the fact that players are hitting more than Whitesprings and Prime with nukes makes for some GREAT low level panic around Morgantown.  
---
This playthru is 100% co-op with the GF.
---
Very short lived glory here. It was the 1 good thing about the patch, everything else they did has broken the game...
---
Problem is, the points these posts make are all the same echo chamber....
---
I'm sure she will, whether thy'll listen or care is another thing.
---
Intense
---
This pissed me off. Its one thing to have a single vendor bot be unavailable because someone is using it. That's fine. But modus has like what 4 different purchase terminals scattered throughout the bunker? They should set it up so each section acts as it's own vendor. An even better solution would be if each was an independent vendor with their own cap supply. An extra 600 caps a day would be very sweet.
---
Until they nuke nerf Melee.
---
I think Junkies Explosive will be the next meta.  Oh no, they saw this post!  \*Nerf Launch Detected"..........goodbye junkies build!
---
The Lone Wanderer
---
Yeap, reasons... give me a reason to use my TSE minigun that does 37 dmg.
---
No disagreement there.
---
They won't go there. Adventure mode is suppose to be just how the game pve/pvp is now. Some will go to the PVP but I don't think it'll be very popular 
---
takes one to know one r-tard
---
Wood armor is such garbage I totally forgot about it.
---
It should be lousy against energy and ballistic but insane towards melee.  Like blocking with a wood arm should negate 90% of melee damage.  And it should provide a stealth bonus slightly worse than shadowed leather.
---
Whic reminds me, does the game consider melee ballistic, or it's own category?  Cause if that's the case I'd have to rethink a lot of what I thought.
---
Makes sense. I figured the bugs and AI enemies wouldn’t be balanced properly to implement a good permadeath mode. I’m not even convinced anyone could deliver a truly solid permadeath experience that isn’t super frustrating. It’s a fun idea though. 
---
For real 5 level ups literally wasted
---
Which one is revinant?
---
15
---
For Honor puts me to sleep zzzzz
---
Just.  Just love yourself.  It's okay.
---
Sokath, his eyes uncovered!
---
You can play now and you already have one, basicly.
---
Even if they put out new vaults, they have shown that the studio is clueless. They don't listen, they tell us what we want. I am done, on to Anthem. 
---
Also, Bethesda, please don't change your studio's name, I want it to be easy for me in the future to never buy one if your products again. 
---
Bye. I hope your pay day is enough to actually play RDR2's online p2w game.
---
Well I’m saying like I can’t see what loot you get so your pretty much on the honor code of sharing legendaries if your with unknown people.
---
Is the problem that Melee scale with STR?
---
Then why not have rifles scale with PER, Pistols with AGI, energy with INT, Heavy with STR etc.
---
Problem with melee is there are so many multipliers due to STR stacking, Twisted Muscles, Drugs etc and these all multiply off each other which inflates the damage even further. 
---
Maybe its time for a new issue/bug mega post.
---
Meh, it's the internet, I'm used to it. I get people's hatred of seeing things for real money. I want the stuff too and I don't want to pay for it. But my rational is like with any games with shit for sale, that stuff's not there for me, that stuff is there for people with tons of disposable income that keep the game free to connect to.
---
Xbox core services are down.
---
They need to add pvp type gear that made to soak damage like they do in every other MMO 
---
That's why I've been using my sick day for some trench warfare.
---
Melee doesn't need the extra damage from strength or give perception/agility damage bonuses to rifles/pistols
---
I just realized I havn't played this game in over a month. I have lost all my interest in playing with the perk card nerfs, making enemies more bullet spongey,  not making durability of items any better (actually they made armor break faster now), and how piss poor energy weapons are, and I keep hearing that they pushed this latest patch on the WRONG version of the game so all the old bugs from the past patch are active again. I just can't see any reason to come back and there is only content being removed, we need new content added if we ever expect players to come back. ATOM shop items are not the content we want or care about.
---
There are 171,273 people here. If you seriously think a handful of anonymous (they are anonymous, you don't know any of the people making them) comments or downvotes reflect on the entire group - you're just flat out wrong. 
---
&gt; But you're proving my point whether you know it or not by defending the community when it's clear there is a very toxic element involved with it.
---
No, you're point is WRONG in every sense of the word - my words don't reflect on ANYONE but myself. I'm baffled you honestly think what I said was "very toxic" at all actually and moreso baffled you feel a handful of people reflect on almost 200,000 people in this group. That's just idiocy. 
---
I am not bored.. Yet,  red dead is my next stop aswell.  I just dont feel ready to start something new atm
---
Oh hey, political reference. I can tell you're fun at parties.
---
Isn’t that.... her job? Why should we be appreciating somebody for doing what they are literally paid to do? 
---
Can I get an appreciation post for dragging my ass to work this morning? Lol
---
I don’t have any good legendaries and I still don’t have anything interesting left to do. I’ve done the hardest content and all the major quests. Meta chasing never interested me because it just involves doing the same boring thing repeatedly. I can’t imagine putting over 1K hours into this game since launch because I’m bored to tears after only 120 hours. 
---
I'm going  to try it tonight.  I remember kind of liking it.  
---
I did the same yesterday after seeing that the patch restored a bunch of bugs from 2-3 versions ago. This more-or-less proves that BSW has no idea what they're doing and / or just doesn't care because they have our money.
---
I ended up giving all my shit to a guy who helped me mule items between alts a while back (because my IRL / gaming friends refuse to play this dumpster-fire of a game).
---
This game is proof that Bethesda just doesn't care about making quality content anymore. They prefer to bank on the fact that gamers will buy their games simply because it says "Bethesda" on it. 
---
Bethesda is dead to me. And good riddance. Hopefully enough people follow suit so they are taking a hit where they'll notice (their wallet).
---
Same 
---
Online games are basically live services that should literally provide you with years worth of content. Obviously that gets built up over time, but even at launch there should be enough content to discover and replay for months.
---
Good point. I imagine splitting the player base wouldn’t help either. 
---
Ah thanks.
---
Yeah I figured out what it was for just not what the actual letters stood for. 
---
It works for me. I play it and I enjoy it. I have crashed exactly once.
---
**They need to do this poll IN GAME.**
---
All developers should be doing polls like this.
---
Instead they guess and wing it, then when the community as a whole riots, wonder what went wrong.
---
They disabled all but 1 of each modus vendor because people where using them to dupe.
---
Ill be on 30 minutes after this post is up
---
They used to give about 60 defense.
---
Meh.  Let the kids have this place.  r/fo76FilthyCasuals has more level headed folks.
---
Here’s my perspective-  
---
Yes and no. Once you have your build optimized it becomes much more rewarding to farm in groups (not including actual teammates, that’s always pretty solid). Trying to “race” other non teammate players that have optimized builds or duped gear tends to feel bad when you’re under equipped.
---
Here’s what I did though as a almost exclusively solo player- once you get your build to the point of being able to confidently traverse the mire/bog/divide pay attention to random spawn and unmarked locations (if you come across a legendary enemy after the firefight subsides look at your map), I have a mental map of the ones that regularly spawn legendary mobs and this keeps you from “racing” other players for loot, as most players tend to focus on the big 6 or 7 locations.  
---
Hope this helps.
---
That’s kind of what I’m doing. I recently got a switch and have decided to play games on there instead for a while. I still keep track of what’s going on with 76, though. Just too see how it’s going and wether or not it’s improving.
---
Just picked this up from a vendor for 64caps, is this what you're talking about?
---
https://imgur.com/a/6gz2eel
---
Elaborate the scorched earth nerf you speak of?
---
I don't think you fully grasp the meaning of the word 'honesty'. Anyways it's just as annoying to see all the people praising the game for all its flaws and acting as if those who don't enjoy the numerous bugs/are understandably outraged by the many bethesda screwups aren't allowed to have a viewpoint. 
---
OP has every right to decide not to play anymore if he feels he isn't going to enjoy the game later, with consideration to the direction this game is taking.
---
Driving, sorry. Google it.
---
This quest is bugged an gives me 0 rewards. Tried on different worlds different days.
---
That’s spot on. That motto might’ve worked for them when they were industry leaders in creating immersive open worlds. However, that was years ago. Nowadays, other devs have caught up and are doing even better job at it. I love Bethesda, but they have really disappointed me with all the controversy surrounding Fallout 76.
---
I think so if it helps cut the rate of like these down and consolidate into one place.
---
Hey, I agree on most of this, but yet I still hold out hope for it, maybe it putting in too much faith? Idk... but at least come back for the dlcs or whatever comes next, they may be bad too but why waste money on the game if you ain’t gonna use it, you know?
---
Last night I wanted to give another player 3 bulk steel(via dropping). It only let me drop 2. 
---
\&gt;Having to repair your weapon after visiting one location is completely ridiculous.
---
Why is that ridiculous? It takes like 30 seconds to drop a quick camp and make some repairs.
---
Are you using multiple weapon systems to extend your operating time?
---
That's very generous of you.
---
Why do you need to carry 40 bobby pins?
---
At least it's a good game, tho.
---
I didn't read the patch notes yet... did they add camels?
---
I just dont bother killing the SBQ because this has happened with me aswell.  Dont wanna waste ammo on buggy enemies that gives shitty loot anyways 
---
Best Comment So Far!!
---
Then it should have been released as a Fallout 4 expansion, not a standalone game people paid $200 dollars for the super special legendary collectors edition. Is an expansion pack worth a $200 collectors edition? Even a $60 price tag? Considering they slashed the price 50% within a month, even Bethesda doesn't see it as being worth $60.
---
Would the title be Fallout 76 A Rad Reborn?
---
Agreed on all points, though I’d characterize the part
---
 &gt; It is perhaps a little excessive in light of explosive weapons that don’t have the legendary effect.
---
...as more like “beyond excessive and completely tone deaf and indicative of the dev team’s misunderstanding of core mechanics of their own game.”
---
I'll edit my comment to make my intent a little more clear.
---
Its the mod that made it so weapon/armor mods unscrapable 
---
"While I dont have any answers at this time, I can forward my sympathy and your disgust with the state of the game to the developers. "
---
That’s not a bad experience that’s how workshops and pvp work? I get that it sucks you’re a low level and trying to get fusion cores but that’s how the game goes workshops are one of the best ways to get certain materials. It’s not toxic or griefing to play the game how to was designed 
---
That doesn’t seem like a fair comparison. 
---
The recoil on the hunting rifle does not make it very viable in a multiple enemy scenario, where the handmade will do much more damage per second.
---
Actually correction, when you making bullets it doesn't show what it will scrap to make it. And on other note, I don't think there is any ppl that have complained about BULK mats being auto scrapped... Are you new by any chance??? 
---
The complains were that your jetpack mod got scrapped when repairing or crafting something :D 
---
This guy gets it but the melee-bois will be upset. Not only do they have the best perks but they want to nerf everything else.
---
Guns lack Armor Pen perks and take forever to kill non-squishies. Anti-Armor guns with Pen mods can do a decent job but the base damage is still so low with every +dmg perk that the game forces Headshots(+sneak attacks) to do anything most of the time. 2 Shot fixes the poor base damage and can overshadow the Armor Pen problem but I still feel like Headshots are required. I never owned a 2Shot Explosive so idk. 
---
Guns are still OP in PvP with just Armor Pen from my experience\~ just throwing that out there in case people think Melee is OP there as well. With 0 Shotgun perks my 2Star Anti Armor +Fire Rate Shotgun quickly 2shots fully armored players my Lvl from a medium distance but it's damage is awful from that same distance against enemies for some reason. I just carry it to cripple Scorchbeast. My full Gunslinger alt is complete ass compared to my Melee main. Not cuz Melee is OP but because the guns and their perks just plain suck. I have to carry multiple different types of Pistols cuz they break quickly, and effectiveness vary VS certain enemies. Melee I just have a Fast Armor Pen and a 40% Power Attack Armor Pen weapon for stealth kills and they just work for everything. Pretty sure my Power Fist has over 100% Pen if that even does anything. Now if only there wasn't a bug where my physically 100%-sure-that-it-actually-landed-directly-in-it's-face punch registers no damage.
---
I never said I agreed with the theory. I work retail management and that's a very, VERY common method people try on us. 
---
Sounds like a plan
---
I’m
---
It seems excessive at first, but we love playing games and we love playing together. The best thing we ever did was get 2 ps4's. Have fun! 
---
I have gotten most my legendary items from non legendary creatures 
---
there are like 3-4 board methods all done differently lol
---
I guess expecting an actual working product nowadays is entitlement. There's a difference between 'hokay, there are some bugs' and 'holy fuck this game shouldn't be released at least for next 6 months while we polish it'.
---
tl;dr 
---
High expectations about mechanics, game play, story-line, community, code, and stability on both the developer's end and players' ends
---
Looks like you managed to completely and utterly miss the purpose of this post even with the extensive context.
---
Absolutely. We tried to make the best out of an awesome concept and held on for better or worse but it got to abusive and the lies got too out of control and the controlling don't even get me started! 
---
Gee sounds like my kids mother.. im moving on to better and more balanced gaming. Im going to start seeing Red Dead 2 on friday we have our first date. Hell i might even go back to Skyrim or Fallout 4 who knows at least they know how to treat a man. 
---
Hahaha but in all seriousness i feel ya its a kick in the $130 Aud over priced promise. 
---
Lesson learnt
---
Do not pre order Bethesda
---
Some brave soul's gonna have to test it and report it. I'll salute whoever does.
---
**Regular armor breaks MUCH faster than power armor.**
---
**Ballistic fiber is MUCH more rare than any power armor repair parts.**
---
I too never repair my power armor.  Sometimes I forget to repair it long enough and a piece will break.  Then I'm like "ooopsie, time to check the repair on all parts".
---
I repair regular armor EVERY day.  Sometimes multiple times during the SAME day.
---
They didn't need to nerf it.  They did it to create pointless grind for ballistic fiber hoping people didn't notice there's no CONTENT in their patches.
---
Judas was also paid with silver.  Don't let it go to your head.
---
Slightly late to the party my friend, here's the big rage thread all about it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajftuz/do_not_allow_current_characters_into_survival
---
You are helping some and if people follow your advice you are hurting others.  I already have my camp not load in about half the time because other camps are too close.  My camp is on a junk pile and many times the other camps that prevent me from loading in aren't even on the junk pile.   What you propose will make this worse for me so I'm going to tell you that I don't like your suggestion and I explained why I thought it was bad advice. 
---
We should be figuring out what would solve the underlying problem and all get together and ask Bethesda to do that instead as a concerted front.   When I see threads that support ideas that are for things I think should be implemented, I add a note to them saying that I support this.  It is clear that Bethesda is reading and paying attention to some degree.  If enough people call for the same thing, it seems like they will at least consider it.
---
I would rather effort be spent on calling for ways to make the game better / fix problems than telling people how to try and work around the issue, especially when your work around has some significant flaws.   Just because there is enough junk piles for everyone to maybe have one, that doesn't mean that 24 (hard limit of 30) won't all be going for the same 6 piles in most cases because that is where they have theirs built.   It's not like you are guaranteed an instance where your camp can be placed down.
---
I was too angry and too tired of exactly this, so I didn't find it in me to write it like you did. Really, very good post. Hope someone actually sees this and does something about it.
---
They literally rolled back this patch to a previous version lmfao that's why Bobby pins got heavier again.
---
What a fucking joke.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't want the game to fail either! I've stuck with the game this long because of all the untapped potential I see in it as well.
---
That's a really good point about the teams. I remember thinking last night that I might need to team up now instead of just blind shooting my TSE and killing mobs without an ounce of effort. Definitely on my list of benefits the patch brought.
---
As I understand, there is Zenimax, under it there is Zenimax Online (ESO creators) and Bethesda (Fallout)
---
One after one the player base is realizing how shit the game truly is. 
---
No. Each counts for 1 level. You have to have all 3 equipped for get level 3. 
---
Right, couldn't agree more, but then what defines a suitable amount of content? 1000 hours? 2000? Should you be able to play 24/7 and never run out of new experiences? 
---
500 hours in less than 3 months is like 5+ hours per day. I think it's pretty unreasonable to expect content creators to keep up with that. That would be like dropping an operation anchorage dlc every day lol 😂 
---
Missed the point. I think Bethesda ought to exempt the explosive effect from the demolition perk and have it only apply to explosive weapons like the middle launcher, fat man, etc.
---
I’m defending that the nerf was entirely necessary. They overshot it a bit. It was too much of a nerf to explosive but not by much.
---
ope. if you wanna unlock lvl 3 you need to have all 3 equipped.
---
The nerfs on this patch made it unplayable not to mention the vendor prices.  Good bye 76
---
DayZ is my gold standard for awful development. 
---
You’ll have to equip all three cards. 
---
Oh I hate that the most! Endless spinner!
---
I did the same.   Grind my eyes out for the caps to buy the three tse weapons I have now.  Only to have them nerfed to poop.    Honestly, I really don’t know what is best now.   Same as before.  Bloodied tse paired with adrenal reaction.   Which is not really my style.  
---
Ran*
---
Same, was working after patch for a few minutes. I may have had radworms, then removed radworms with disease cure and no more jump height +
---
I don't agree or disagree, but I just find that funny because it's -55 here and we're not allowed to be outside for longer than 10 minutes here lol
---
God it would suck to be your dog ...
---
“I want you to sit” (patch 1)
---
“Boy .... I want you to sit” (patch 2)
---
*pump shotgun*
---
I’ve never finished the dlc so I think I wanna check out nuka world 
---
Mut fruit, tato, corn (and one purified water)
---
2 of each - makes vegetable starch which breaks down to adhesive
---
Thanks for that. Too many people here post incorrect info and just leave it there gathering momentum and YouTube clicks.
---
It's right that you admitted this and It's right that you get a positive reaction. 
---
You should eat a snickers.
---
What are they? So they can know and do their best to patch them out. 
---
Be brave, young Wastelander. I'll fight for you if you get banned for saying it lol
---
It seems like someone branched off that older version and they just published their dev build instead of merging and testing it. My guess is that management is micromanaging the Git process and doesn't understand it. Not uncommon in the industry when you move outside FANG companies.
---
this was honestly one of the best gaming experiences i ever had..and with this latest patch..i dont really care to play it really..i had trades lined up...but dont think im going to log in until this new patch is fixed..they dont want us to enjoy the game anymore..they even downgraded white knight
---
That’s a good explanation and I was gonna get fallout 76 but why is there so many people complaining that it’s shit?
---
I’ve said it all along. This game won’t change enough to please the people who never liked it, but it will get the No Mans Sky/Sea of Thieves/Destiny 2 treatment. There will be positive news articles written about it. How the game has changed so much and how you should really come back and try it again. In reality, it will be very similar to the game at launch. 
---
I own all of the games mentioned, and it's just my opinion, but I think all were better than the gaming community made them out to be at launch. I also think they are not that much better or as different as the gaming community now makes them out to be. 
---
So yes, Year 2 and Year 3 will be filled with many puff peices.
---
PS: I enjoyed my time with all except No Mans Sky.
---
Lol he says to the 42 year old.
---
The game has Perks which completely negate effects. Yes or no?
---
White knight was nerfed for no real reason. Yes or no?
---
You're just salty someone pointed out the flaws in your logic. Yes or no? 
---
Doubt it. This will probably just be a spin off that was remember being bad but fun for a little bit 
---
Really, the absolute last thing this game needs more of is more frequent gathering, repairing, higher mat requirements, and more inventory/perk management. Who in their right mind, after playing this game for a few hours, thinks to themselves "you know what would make this better? If I had to repair my armor more and it cost more materials that are hard to farm!". It's not a fun mechanic after a point.
---
&gt;But hey, since you're so knowledgeable and good at video game developing, maybe you should submit an application to Bethesda and go give em a hand fixing this shit
---
I want absolutely zero part of any team which apparently can't implement build version control, version merging, manual code checks, or proper internal QA/test servers.
---
Make sure higher level players are not in the same area. 
---
I tend to stick to lower level areas and it seems to be a little faster progression, 1 and two hitting enemies is nice, its also less of a burden on resources. 
---
I'm level 30 now and I feel I'm starting to level faster now as well as get a good grasp on some beneficial routines. 
---
You know I put it down and was waiting for it to get better and by all accounts it's only gotten worse. I mean are they even listening to the fans at all?
---
Cheers guys. 
---
Currently battling with my Perk Points. :-(
---
No Community Manager in their right mind would ever comment on that publicly, especially if they want to keep their job. That is just utterly ridiculous and selfish to say. 
---
I just read someone leveled up and maxed out on 76 and now there is nothing to do and they get on just to get screws and some people don’t log in for months that’s why I’m confused?
---
Admittedly, I don’t use explosive weapons but my friend does. I think the explosive legendary effect ought not be affected by the demolition perk. That way they could rebuff it to its old state and then make standard explosive weapons, such as missile launcher, be effective again.
---
I've never bought anything from another player and it doesn't effect my enjoyment of the game whatsoever. 
---
I've never even hit 3000 caps on my characters. 
---
I think quadrupling plan costs and making all the plans available from vendors is a great solution. 
---
If you already have every plan and all the caps, I'm going sit here and raise eyebrows. 
---
In my eyes, you are either illegitimate or you need to take a break.
---
Yeah for real. My lvl 35 explosive shotgun is still doing a ton of damage and I'm not even fully specced into it, no idea what the whining is about. I guess if you can't 1 shot literally everything it's underpowered. Game is running fine, no crashes or disconnects for me yet. Oh and I can actually see what plans I own already and vendors have so much more shit to sell, I was able to buy the plan for the handmade rifle with no issue instead of dealing with server hopping like I see so many people whining about. Wait what are people complaining about again? Bobby pins weighing .1 again that will likely be fixed shortly?
---
Cool I've been looking forward to 4d gameplay
---
Ok I’ll make a $60 game that literally displays a screen of dogshit when you pop it in your PS4. Glad you’ll get your money’s worth out of that, as it’ll be a working product. I’ll call it Dogshit Simulator 2019. Naturally I’ll release a new version every year and shut down the servers of the previous year’s game when I do. Btw to get on those is free but you have to buy extras like flies buzzing around if you want.
---
Now do you see how silly your statement was?
---
I think you should re-read it. 
---
i basicly lost all my money because i invited somebody to my team and then it decided to get out of my power armor while in a nuke zone so i got over flooded with radiation in seconds so i lost all my flux witch is over a 100 and that is a prety big amount of money for me and i probably lost my excavator suit too because it is fallout 76 witch is a realy fucking bad game...
---
Yep it affects perks like good doggy etc as well lmao 
---
I agree! 
---
I'll hop in time to time to kill some shit or get a plan or two but I'll be waiting patiently for a new patch/content drop. We should be getting that roadmap that they have been talking about. Excited to see what they having coming. 
---
In the mean time, I'm trying to work up the courage to get back into RE2.....don't want to face Mr. X. :(
---
I have heard the reports of single caps found inside them. I just had one with 36. I think it’s bugged. No cap collector or anything. Also, they are trying to eliminate all sorts of server hopping farming necessity. I’m not sure how you were normally searching them multiple times but it sounds like that was never something that was intended. 
---
You say “balanaced for pvp” when the biggest most helpful thing they could have done was removed legendary WEAPON effects from combat. Please feel free to think on how much that alone could have helped the situation, but instead of anything like that they do what THEY want and we ask them NOT to do. Their opinion is only one that matters in the end so all of our pointing shit out only makes it easier for them to ruin the game 
---
Yeah the spinner happened, but even after that the loot loaded. But no legendary. They finally popped in about a minute after the other looted loaded.
---
thanks ill make sure to update my post
---
"The fuck just two-shotted me?"
---
What a profoundly stupid comment.
---
FO4.
---
I find it funny that melee players complained about TSE one shooting everything but melee has been the problem all along.
---
Nerf TSE but melee falls under the same logic for a nerf.
---
The 200-cap limit at vendors feels even more constraining because of the one-transaction-at-a-time nature of the new vendor system. In Fallout 3 and New Vegas, you could set up a whole transaction before committing to it. In 4 &amp; 76, each item you buy or sell is a separate transaction.
---
Say I want to buy a gun for 1000 caps. I only have 750 caps on me, but I also have 10 stimpaks worth 25 caps each. The vendor has 200 caps.
---
This wouldn't be a problem under the old system, because I could put the gun and the stimpaks on the same tab, as it were, and the 250-cap differential between the price of the gun and the contents of my wallet would be offset by the stims. I'd walk away flat broke (but with a fancy new gun) and the vendor would now have 950 caps.
---
Under the new system, I'd only be able to sell 8 of my stimpaks to the vendor, and even if I went away and sold the other 2 to someone else, I'd still need 50 caps from somewhere else. And afterwards, the vendor would have 0 caps.
---
Completely re-doing the barter UI to restore the FO3/NV-era functionality is probably out of scope, but there are three much easier changes that would still make trading in 76 suck a whole lot less:
---
1. Increase the vendors' cap allowance from 200 to 1000 per faction per day.
---
2. Allow vendors to keep 100% of the caps we pay them.
---
3. Allow vendors to keep caps even if it puts them over their daily allowance. That is, if I spend 250 caps at a vendor who started with 1000, that vendor should then have 1250 caps available.
---
I hope that makes sense. I know it's a lot of math, lol. Hit me up if anything's unclear :)
---
I'm well aware of the context, you however are not.
---
Same. Pretty disappointed. The whole Fallout 76 thing kinda went like my previous relationship: Pretty excited before the "beta" but then the bugs came up one by one, lies were stacking up on the daily and an outdated engine turned out to be just not made for me. In any case, it was fun while it lasted but alike war, liars never change. And Bethesda lied, too. :)
---
Less than a week hopefully.
---
Hey mate you are not alone, obviously. I was not interested in Fallout 76 until a buddy of mine convinced me and I bought it on sale. From what I got Bethesda was trying to go for the MMO category and just give that endless grind, but without the reward. I only dumped 30-40 hours in the game and had to say almost every aspect was disappointing. Bethesda just needs to put this one on the shelf or put in back in the oven for a while, either way I doubt they care. 
---
I mean honestly, was not some of the patch hype because they were going to give us a FOV slider? Is this what we really are to expect from a huge developer?
---
It is might be a good way to go about things. If you have people on the other end that actually use that information to solve issues and make a good gameplay. 
---
I have to disagree here. Even individually both TS and Explosive were FAR superior to everything else in their effect tier, explosive being the more severe of the two.
---
Combined they were beyond excessively powerful resulting in a 6x damage bonus compared to the best possible alternative, an appropriate anti- prefix and better criticals, giving an only situational 1.95x damage buff. Or in the case of bloodied with better criticals at low health 2.985x.
---
This math makes it obvious how ridiculously overpowered explosive was by itself when it alone  with Demo expert gave 3x damage. 
---
If they did that, they would just have to listen to people complain about C.A.M.P. budgets being too small again....
---
The station at Valley Galleria counts as the one by the super duper mart. 
---
Yeah my odds were roughly based on the possible rolls of a 3* armor piece not including weapons and of course we all know that 3* legendaries still rarely drop a 3* so maybe someone else has an accurate # on that actual 3* drop percentage.
---
But yes it sounds realistic that the true odds would be less than your odds of hitting the pick 6 lotto.
---
You don't feel like a cheater collecting duped armor?
---
Mainly solo player here too. So no, I'm not happy. There's no point of playing with regenerating enemies. I really like this game, love it even. But the patch released yesterday was just too much.
---
 As a solo player, attacking a group of 8+ super mutants, doing no damage, getting nowhere isn't fun. I don't run power armor, so my standard armor takes a beating. Now I need more mats to repair everything? It was balanced IMO to begin with. The condition aspects of guns and armor. Now It's just too top heavy and silly.  
---
It's upsetting to have to put something away that you paid for and actually like and want to play! 
---
So yes. I will begrudgingly be taking a break until some issues are re-addressed. Then maybe we/I can enjoy my/our money spent again. 8v( 
---
I wish this kind of thing was more common. Props to you. I generally assume at least half the people posting bugs are just doing the same thing: Seeing it on another post and repeating it without verification.
---
It would be good for a lucky build, something like cheating death the icon could be vault boy hiding from death \^\^ behind something 
---
Hey man, if there are people into looking at dogshit, you're in for a treat! Good on you. It'll be even better if you get a following and build a lore around the dogshit. 
---
I will agree that it is quite ... sad. Indeed. Hence why I wanted to launch this discussion up and have Bethesda take notice. But since its not on the first page. They wont :(
---
[What this one you?](https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/one-armed-man-applauds-the-kindness-of-strangers/article_19caaa3d-f56f-5a67-8861-c838a240a5a6.html) :)
---
What weight of Stimpack do you have now? Mine hasn’t changed after patch - 0,1
---
you get like a 20-40% buff for 2 minutes i forget the amount but its a huge buff and its as big if not bigger than nerd rage. You can 100% get that high damage and you dont even have to use the chems or bobbleheads unless you really want to. 
---
He tried to. I killed him. The only good ghoul is a dead ghoul.
---
I have a shotty/Melee/mutant who uses both armor types, a pure auto rifle mutant who refuses to use PA, and a PA non mutant Heavy Weapons BA.  They are vastly different levels 192- 23 - 12 and I enjoy them all.  Maybe when all is said and done, this game will become a challenge and I'll have a reason to create a science build.
---
And another time while I was getting wood at the logging camp 
---
Today I saw many old bugs and a few minutes ago I noticed the good old explosion-no-dmg bug is back. I take a break. See you next update.
---
No just that. But anything in life you don’t support or agree with. You just don’t support or buy. 
---
So what is your position at bethesda since you seem to know what there plans are? Still hoping for f2p?  
---
RDR2 might be a good single player game, but p2w = bullshit grind to get into your wallet. which is a bad game. unless you like games made so grindy you have to pay not to play.
---
Then the devs should shuffle those guys onto the patch team until the game is in a better state. We’d all be more inclined to give you more money if the game wasn’t in its current state. At this point it’s just leaves a bitter taste for us. 
---
I'm about to try sinner with game pass. Looks cool very dark souls esq
---
White Knight being nerfed, adding PVP game mode that the community is overwhelmingly meh on. T
---
Can I just say that this is the flaw of any multiplayer game like this? I wish this model would die. 
---
Working through content isn’t content if that makes sense. The reason MMO work is that they’re so massive and you paid a fee every month to play so there is a ton of actual content to run through. But like destiny “runs” etc are awful. 
---
Are you happy with the way bethesda has handled volatile situations? Are you happy about patches released? Will you pre order rage 2 or any future bethesda releases based on your experience with fo76?
---
Oof. That makes me sting lol That editor needs a pinch om the arm lol But no. Thanks for the laugh
---
This was such a good read! I just got a nice radium rifle, and I want try it out. Would you care to help with some mods? I’d be happy to provide caps and mats
---
That makes sense. The way the code is tangled up, I'd expect its non-trivial to make a change to one bobblehead only.
---
This is why a TSE handgun now does less damage than a sword. Just fixing the TSE shotgun is too much trouble, so they just nerfed everything.
---
A idiot who shopped on ebay for a ingame item like there is literally a marketplace for this shit and most dupers if you are nice give that shit away for free hell i shared some radaway with a guy he dropped me a tse gun and gave me a bunch of serums 
---
Yes! Manhunt that guy until we get the fix for .1 lb Bobby pins!!! 😂 And maybe some other things...
---
I gave up a while back. Too many bugs, too empty of a world and the pvp is boring
---
I think they did that as a way to collect caps back from players or else everyone’s getting more caps everyday it will make caps worthless eventually and new players won’t be able to afford anything in player trading  but it’s also kinda stupid cuz most higher level player/duper already have all the plans learned . So it’s pointless 
---
Agree, it’s not lack of content but it’s a lack of interesting content that builds to lacklustre conclusion.  I tried hard but having no NPC’s really dried out all the content they put in.  I find positives in the innovations they tried.  I hope they learn a lot for their next titles.  I’ll buy any good game, but for now I won’t pre order from Bethesda.
---
I have been active, too. I bought this broke ass game. Where is my appreciation?
---
I two shot them... Where did you get your K-Mart TSE from?
---
Haha, that's actually pretty close to what I'm doing. I've got a tribal char that only uses spears, pole hooks, etc, and primitive pipe weapons.
---
I'm trying to avoid any communities that are ready to commit Seppuku a day or two over a controversial patch. So, whever you going, i'll be heading the opposite direction.
---
Are you online right now? I was under the impression the servers were down for everyone on Xbox.
---
thats not being brave and ive never been a snitch lol
---
Not sure how you're able to play. Xbox core services have been down for at least an hour now.
---
I loved the game but I think it's just ran dry on a lot of people. Personally I have kinda stopped playing it. I'll come back time to time, maybe after a patch or too see if there's anything cool in the atom shop. It's sad too see it like this, I wanted it too be cool, I really wanted to have a fallout game with friends but the bad press on it just drove them away and the few that did get it didn't like it, and I see why tbh. I really hope Bethesda can add more to it down the line but for now me and from what it looks like many others are done with 76. :(.......au revoir et bon voyage 76! 
---
No Man's Sky updates have been free as well. I don't follow you.
---
It's not a true survival game though. It's just the game with PvP all day everyday. If they did a true survival, you would get one life to live and then when you die your character is gone forever.
---
If it fixes cheating it's worth it 
---
Fingers crossed they learn their lesson and fixed their issues by the time elder scrolls 6 comes out
---
Nice job removing the post Mods, lmao.
---
Next morning month tbh
---
I know. It's hurts my soul thinking about it. If you watch the NoClip documentary it's clearly a game everybody involved was wonderfully excited a sharing with the world, and they either (a) thought releasing 76 early to millions of players, rather than working another few years with the hundreds in QA would "Break it early" &amp; allow them to fix it quicker &amp; better than keeping it internal or (b) wanted more time but it wasn't financially viable to lengthen the development cycle / some of the team were due to work on Starfield.
---
I subscribed to the subreddit to have cool lore conversations, and make content suggestions the Devs might see / appreciate, but the vitriol is abhorrent. I'm not blind to the flaws, either with some aspects of the game or the canvas bad situation, that have left a bag taste in players mouths about Bethesda, but there's a point at which it becomes redundant &amp; self congratulatory. 
---
It's like fucking black Friday 
---
I'm on xbox: ChrisB OMG
---
I say that and I heard good things about We Happy Few and Ashen also..
---
For some reasons "hey jealousy" came up instead. I'll have to see if i am familiar with jealous again. Because alice in chains is now playing. I have terrible adhd with songs.
---
Have you ever actually observed 'anything in life'? Ever seen a protest? Ever read a negative review? Ever voted?
---
*Maybe so, but that doesn't invalidate a differing opinion.*
---
Actually yes it can. If you can't accept the factual evidence and simply ignore it in the conversation then it certainly can invalidate your opinion. How can someone take your seriously otherwise if you can't weigh up the facts of the matter but instead just tell people they are wrong. 
---
There's a map that explains level you should be to go places I don't have it but I've seen it yes a higher level would help but it's how you want to play if you want assistance people are out there but levels happen explore and have fun don't grind that kills people 
---
Done with the queen for a bit myself. I just can't justify slogging to craft all that ammo and then as a reward have to slogging again to repair my weapons so that I can defend myself while scrounge for more ammo materials.
---
I play games to escape the monotony of life, not emerse myself in a world where bullshit is magnified a hundred fold.
---
My guess is you will soon be able to buy ammo containers in the atom shop.
---
I think it partially has to do with perk cards not working correctly anymore. Lots of other folks have posted saying the perk cards aren't appropriately applying their benefits/bonuses, so your weaponsmith ones might not be working anymore. Haven't tested, that's just a hypothesis, but with this game, I'm pretty f**kin sure something is broken. 
---
Yes I’m 53 years old.
---
You're ignoring the implications of the math here.
---
TS alone was 2x damage. Explosive alone was 2x damage without Demo expert, your proposed solution. Both of these still VASTLY outperform every other effect.
---
Making them impossible to roll together doesn't do anything to fix the problem that they were both far superior to every other legendary effect. 
---
Mate what do you mean the Witcher 3 ain't perfect
---
The burden on resources is really the fallback to fighting higher level enemies. Its not too hard to just stay back and take potshots but having to constantly scrap for ammo so im not bone dry after every encounter gets tedious
---
I consider it as the only buff for this horrible patch xD take advantage of it when u still can lol like grape mentats
---
He makes it sound like f76 is making you pay for everything 
---
Yeah, but how much did Bungie charge for it?
---
I loved Destiny 1, and I put a lot of hours into Destiny 2 vanilla.  And when I ran out of content, I was happy just collecting and customizing all the different armors and guns.  Then I ran out of vault space, as one does in Destiny.
---
Bungie's response?  No QoL updates until after the first **paid** DLC.  If I have to pay extra for QoL updates, then what the fuck are the microtransactions for?
---
When 76 came out I didn't have high hopes for Bethesda.  I mean Skyrim is *still*, shipping with ridiculous bugs and glitches, even after the seventh rerelease.
---
But then we got extra Stash space less than a month after release.  So I give Bethesda a lot of credit for that.  I'm done with 76 for now, but after the first content drops I'll be excited to give it another look.
---
Meanwhile I hear good things about the current state of Destiny 2, but I have no plans to check it out because I'm not going to keep sinking money into it.  I'm not ok with how they triple dip their customers (iterative releases, paid DLC, and microtransactions) and then they're stingy with updates.
---
The only enjoyment I get out of 76 at the moment is the CAMP system. I log in for about an hour to mess around with that, or grind some atoms, and that's it. 
---
How 76 has been handled has my mind made up that I'm not buying the next Elder Scrolls title first party. Bethesda isn't getting my money again until they earn my trust.

“Wide.” Not that big. Also enemies in this game had a tendency to spread out. By the time I’ve maneuvered around and convinced enemies to get close together somewhat making a mini nuke worth it, some other guy with a rifle has killed the same group and the melee guy is already fast traveling to the next location to farm.
---
With less sarcasm: it isn’t worth the trouble.
---
What were you wearing for a mask?  I tried a Marine Tactical helmet and it didn't work, but the Urban Scout Mask did.
---
Incase you can't find the RR next to a Super Duper it's at Big B's Rest stop, not Watoga, I made that mistake
---
Dude, grindy? And Fallout 76 is not grindy?
---
My position in bethesda is confidential.
---
oldschool runescape 
---
Then how can you make a statement like:
---
&gt;But anything in life you don’t support or agree with. You just don’t support or buy.
---
Without any perks? That is very generous 
---
I don't think you've thought this out correctly.
---
Two shot is one of the most OP perks in the game.  Bloodied can be even worse with the right build.  And instigating is double damage if they're at full health.
---
Two Shot, Bloodied, Instigating would be the new meta until it got nuke nerfed.
---
They need to make SMALL balance changes to the perks over time to bring them all in line.  Not just nuke nerf one, then nuke nerf another one.  League of Legends does it right, and Bethesda can too.
---
Welcome to the club 
---
Pfft nevermind
---
100% agree
---
Sorry for just now commenting on this post, I did not see this in my mentions (Had a massive amount of posts and messages in my inbox on here and the forums to reply to so if anyone else has tagged me and I did not respond yet I apologize! I am still working through these all.) But yes, I will pass this message along. Thank you for the honest and constructive feedback on this.
---
I gave up too. I bought AC: Odyssey and haven't looked back.
---
Bethesda can't seem to stop tripping over it's own feet long enough to fix the game.
---
you can't determine the worth of an action for someone else
---
servers are up again. Were you going to buy anything?
---
But it requires a revive so it's completely situational? 
---
Its clear these guys don't because they would have caught half this stuff here.  I don't disagree but honestly with how bad this has been and the fact that the lists of bugs are the size of novellas - its clear their QA dept is crap, their testers are not gamers in any way shape or form and the fact that bugs are being reintroduced is pathetic.
---
Me too 
---
F em in the a 
---
More than the sub. When I was playing actively I was trading. I spent the vast majority of my time running up to people and talking with them. Most of the people I talked to felt the game was not worth 60 dollars. For every person that says they're enjoying the game online, there are at least 2 people complaining about it. With that, even people who found enjoyment in the game (like myself) still feel it wasn't worth 60 dollars.
---
So while I have not done a proper study per-se, this wasn't pulled out of my ass. This sentiment is reflected freakin' everywhere. Bethesda knows it too, hence their thinly veiled plan at avoiding refunds by using their own shitty launcher with their own refund policy.
---
If you haven't yet, look up how the Damage Resistance stat actually works in FO4 (and I assume here). 
---
When you do, its blatantly obvious that anti-armor is the best effect for minguns, considering you're basically doing slap damage to anything with more than 40 DR (ie fucking everything).
---
It's sad that the fans are exponentially better at theorycrafting than the devs.
---
I got plenty of legendaries last night.
---
In fact I got three two shot weapons (after only seeing two...crossbows...the entire time playing the game beforehand).
---
The trolls are trolling hard this week.
---
Happy birthday to the ground! LOL
---
Thinking back on it, I feel like what they should have done was simply make it so lvl 2 is what the current lvl 3 is (basically what the old lvl 2 was already) and make it so that lvl 3 only gives benefits to armour repair discounts. That way you're not compelled to get lvl 3 in the card for your active build (since it doesn't benefit armour decay any more than lvl 2 does) unless you want to have that discount.
---
If you have rad worms that now affects all mutation effects. Positive and negative. 
---
Upvoted this because you have your opinion. I'm mixed. And see little reason to defend it, because all those with the opinion that it is a good game, will always defend it. I just like this shit show from both sides. (As i am on both at times...)
---
Yeah but you’d assume the names was relevant?
---
Then again I do go to r/awww hoping for hardcore porn
---
&gt;you can't validly criticize games if you aren't literally a game dev
---
Who are you to praise the game if you aren't a game developer? What games have you made that gives you the authority to say whether a game is good? Cut it out with that bullshit, man.
---
Some of this shit doesn't require 10 years as a games developer to realize it's bad or has problems or bad decisions have been made. If you have knowledge of general software development you'd know what they did was a massive fuckup and belies huge problems with how its being developed at a basic level. Industry standards and best coding practices are there for a reason, to prevent (partially) the shitshow we got with this patch. Changes which make the game less fun to play don't require you to be a game dev to understand.
---
Jesus, man.
---
That's true, wider area of damage. But I have plasma grenades that do (or did, I haven't checked yet) 200 damage. 
---
The question still remains then how did they screw it up specifically that way on PS4?  How is it they gain 100x gravity in the stash?
---
Say what you will, but I like MODUS. Of the the Enclave characters I've met (outside Arcade Ganon) he is the only one I think is actually trying to the the right thing.
---
Agreed. Melee needs a nerf. It’s easier to counter than a TSE weapon though. The TSE problem was more pressing and now we ought to turn our attention to melee as well as rebalancing enemies.
---
No ill download them / it of them interwebz for free. I don't condone piracy but at this point id rather support a pirate than Bethesda, at least the pirates are honest about what they are doing.
---
That's if i even bother with another Bethesda game.
---
Even thought it seems like a crappy pitchfork, the Manufacturer's Defect seems like the best one for this scenario. 
---
Yep, have to hand it to her.  She's trying to put out the fires pretty well.
---
Doesn't help that the devs aren't doing in-game surveys to find out what people really want instead of cherry picking items out of reddit and using their own imaginations as to what we want.
---
Aw downvoting me because you were wrong? So sad.
---
I agree. I played the game at launch, enjoyed it about as much as FO76, dropped the game after a few weeks, THEN returned a year later, and it was a completely different game.
---
I wholly blame them taking a publishing deal with Sony, for it's initial failure. That, and the fact that they had probably the worst luck on the planet lol.
---
Great idea.  I’m in!
---
I’m so regretful I have time to come to the games subreddit to farm upvotes with the same generic complaints people have had since release 
---
cool beans man
---
My walking cane one-hits level 62 charred ghouls. If a regular scorchbeast lands with half health it takes like 5 seconds to finish them off.
---
Nice answer indeed.
---
Alexa, play Marty Robbins Big Iron
---
If you have rad worms that now affects all mutation effects. Positive and negative.
---
So if you’re running speed demon that’s probably it. 
---
Im not sure if its the same issue. In the morning I usually do a quick transaction at each vendor and come back after work and finish them up. I noticed last time around that that regardless of my morning transactions two of the vendors had already reset back to 200 caps. So yea something wonky is going on. I would check back as the HF vendor probably has yet to reset. 
---
It feels like they are punishing the loyal.
---
I am trying and failing to get into it too bud, think the servers are down ..... againnnn
---
This is why I want the jetpack destiny xp I can fly doesn't matter the ap Regen I know how it works... Also good job man 
---
Hahaha, yeah pretty much. I just stopped worrying about curing diseases since they happen so often. 
---
I imagine this isn’t intended but that seems to be what’s happening. I can jump way higher with marsupial now too, for instance. 
---
Be warned, I bought a plan yesterday for a small water purifier that did not say "known" but when I went to use it the title updated to include the "known" tag. So some issues exist with the tag. I really like this addition though, especially with the update to vendors.
---
Do you have melee weapon perks on though? And possibly also melee mutations? 
---
Nope. 3 xboxes currently running in my house. Everything seems fine. 
---
When all the game really has to offer in it's current state is farm WS/SBQ, that decision did seem questionable at best, especially with the nerf to event xp. 1 hour 12 minutes also seems like a super arbitrary number... 12 minutes? Really?
---
Frostbite in 10 minutes or less isn't fun?
---
Thank you :)
---
I did very slight tweaks to some pictures to make certain spots to stand out.
---
The nuke is unedited. Love this picture. 
---
This guy doesn't read.
---
Hunters 3k
---
It's literally Warframe.
---
Watch a video, it's Warframe with 4 frames instead of 30+.
---
Might want to give the free version a try before you hand over $60+ for EA's clone.
---
&gt;If I don’t like the New England Patriots then I don’t watch their games or The Super Bowl. 
---
And if you really don't like them, say you disagree with their hiring practices or something? Maybe you decide that other people should be informed of what they get up to? Maybe so those other people also don't watch their games?
---
&gt;With games and media they judge their product by who is engaged and consuming there product.
---
So why stop at just yourself if you really disagree with the product?
---
Because you cant appreciate someone who is doing their job really well. Man no one should be appreciated for the work they do even if they go above and beyond. 
---
Pete Hines, "It Just Works!"...
---
Pete Hines you are twit...
---
I don't have a problem running the game on my gaming desktop. She has a 1 year old gaming laptop with a built in ssd. This game is just not optimized for every bit of hardware, and for a AAA release I shouldn't have to bang my head against the wall to make it work.  Her game lags, she randomly speeds up and turns without doing anything (which I imagine is somehow a remnant of the old fps locking issue), and she otherwise experiences the same in game bugs as everyone else. I get you are trying to be helpful, but it is a bit shortsighted to suggest I rebuild her computer so that she can run this poorly coded dumpster fire of a game, and still be emotionally drained from the game breaking bugs that exist aside from technical issues.
---
Just turned mine on. For some reason none of the xbox systems are down in my house. 
---
&gt; Anyways it's just as annoying to see all the people praising the game for all its flaws and acting as if those who don't enjoy the numerous bugs/are understandably outraged by the many bethesda screwups aren't allowed to have a viewpoint.
---
Okey, but my comment isn't about people praising the game, let alone *for* its flaws, I am talking about the people who are playing and enjoying despite them. If someone casually plays the game and isn't balls deep in the "controversies" that the outraged TROO GAMERZ are REEEEing about, there is no lack of honesty in them saying they enjoy the game. Exactly where is the lack of honesty in that?
---
Additionally, just because someone says they enjoy 76 doesn't automatically mean they think its 10/10 perfection and they are shill or drone or whatever the fuck else terms /r/fallout loves to use. The vast majority of people playing and enjoying it would all provide you with a list of things they wish were better or different- but for the sake of getting a better experience. And if those people want to discuss various things about the game, its pretty shitty to constantly be hounded by the outraged haters who just keep jumping to the next sub that is created to get away from them in the first place. 
---
Yeah I'll keep trying. Havent tried a server hop yet. Gonna give that a go shortly too.
---
I was merely making a joke on the wordplay, I do imagine some nerfs are coming to melee. 
---
So that's what it was. I mean, I was regenerating a lot of AP thanks to Rejuvenated and Well Tuned, but it's funny that a disease increases your stats like that.
---
I wonder if it's specific to diseases that affect percentages to the character, such as the 25% damage taken increase from blood worms would increase effects by 25%.
---
Normally somebody would say, "I hate to tell you that I was right," but I don't at all :)
---
It was glaringly obvious what this game was going to be. The fact that you people continue to buy the same shit from Bethesda over and over is ridiculous.
---
You guys had to learn sometime, I guess
---
I'm afraid the numbers don't lie.  Berserker adds 50% base damage + another 32% for Explosive (with full perks).  That's 82%.
---
Currently Two-Shot + Explosive is 57%.
---
I could be wrong, but I'm fairly certain on the math.  I've also put my directly compared the two in inventory. :)
---
I gave up in December. What a shitshow. 
---
1 in 2 mil is the odds for getting exactly the 3 piece armor you want. There are 7 seperate rng rolls that lead up to it. 
---
Sure i can increase the odds if all i want is the specific 1st and 3rd star effect. If i dont care about the 2nd effect, armor type or if its heavy combat. 
---
How am i supposed to know if its duped? I got it fair and square  i feel like a winner!
---
I literally have seen zero cavs + unyielding pieces flooding the market. They are rare still. I assume the piece i got was not duped. I dont care if it was tho. Im no fuckin white knight.  Most of you would consider me a "greifer". 
---
If ur complaining for anything but the TSE nerf, i agree with you. If ur solely complaining foe the TSE, then i call BS
---
i found one in the savage divide to the left of sugar grove and another one in the cranberry bog, fighting me along with 2 scorch beasts and an army of scorched 
---
Fair enough!
---
Same on Xbox
---
i know you're just trying to be witty, but this game will die if people aren't playing it. it's a lose-lose if enough people start leaving that it positively affects your gameplay.
---
The atomic shop has experienced bugs but I would suggest it's largely that becuase you're literally just dealing with a non-game thing. This is the equivalent of complaining that Bethesda had a functioning website when their game has glitches, the two don't really make much sense to compare. 
---
Plot twist
---
They only send an intern that kicks u in the shin once
---
Haha. Maybe my build is fked but I was doing 2k+ pre-nerf. 
---
Nah I'm good just was giving you a heads up but thanks. 
---
People were getting legendary drops often? Ive been playing since the beta, ive killed a ton of legendary everythings, and so far i have received like 10 legendary items... half of them being on planks or meat hooks...
---
I'm going to have to watch the documentary again, but I believe he said he was one of the people that worked on the online part.
---
Beyond the TSE nerf, a ton of bugs and problems came back into the game, it seems that for this patch they used an older version of the game. Basically, they took one step forward last patch and just took two steps back. Its even worse considering it takes them 2-3 weeks to fix things, so actual game content will only continue to be pushed back
---
Guy gets hit by a crap firehose and thinks "at least people won't notice that lunchtime ketchup stain on my shirt".
---
LOL Bravo Man, Bravo!
---
I believe this bug may be caused if you have the Classfreak perk on. Try removing it and see if the positive effects come back. I get this bug all of the time when I'm in a group, share the perk, then the other people drop group.
---
Oh. Shoot. You're right. TIL
---
The game is fucking trash. I don't blame you at all. 
---
ESO took year. It came out in April 2014 and in March 2015 it became Tamriel Unlimited, ditching sub and it was in state where community was pleased. 
---
From my point of view I understand that graphic artists/animators/modelers are not working on code so I understand this.  
---
I think the frustration is, NEW CONTENT would use these team members abilities, and I feel the community would be encouraged by a post from Bethesda that said something like:  
---
"We realize we need to do better and work to improve fo76.  To that end we are tasking all staff to work on new content for the fastest possible release.  This unfortunately means the artists and modelers who work on atom shop items are being retasked to help polish the new items in the upcoming content and thus the atom shop will have fewer or no updates until the next patch is released.  We appreciate your patience and look forward to all the amazing things the atom store will bring to your fo76 experience after the next patch releases"
---
I can only pray.
---
This is a stupid argument.
---
You were doing between 500-1k damage, from range, to multiple enimies.
---
Melee has to close the gap and can only single target. Also has to have extremelyow health to event attempt to get that high damage. 
---
If you are to stupid to see the difference then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you.
---
However, I agree they nerfed TSE a bit to hard. 
---
I'm confused about why they ever promised to open vaults.  This are like 5 or 6 vaults that open before it, and generally in a geographic area vaults open about once a generation at the earliest.
---
&gt;TS alone was 2x damage. Explosive alone was 2x damage without Demo expert, your proposed solution. Both of these still VASTLY outperform every other effect.
---
You're so close my dude. They outperform the other effects, I agree! Maybe the other effects could be made to compete with TS or E separately. Together, they are disgusting, so the solution is.....?
---
This isn't in a vacuum, because power changes to ranged must be considered with how powerful melee is. If you nerf the only viable modifier or combination of modifiers into the ground, how much better is it to just go back to faceroll melee time?
---
&gt;Making them impossible to roll together doesn't do anything to fix the problem that they were both individually far superior to every other legendary effect.
---
It absolutely, inherently does. Now you can balance each separately without having to worry about how they interact with each other in an almost multiplicative way, and without messing with too many other aspects of the game (demo perk cards or gun perk cards etc) or weapons classes.
---
The problem with them rolling together is instead of having to consider how powerful TS is + other (non-E) modifiers, or vice-versa, the balancing is inherently always around the TSE combo because nothing is even close in power scaling. If you remove that power scaling, you no longer have to balance around one edge case--which is still the case! 
---
Yeah, I'm not playing at the moment (launching a nuke was enough for me). But getting rid of the armor perk would have been freaking annoying. Regular armor already sucked button compared to power armor. 
---
Why are they nerfing things? That's what I don't get. You can do that after you create a stable game that is fun. 
---
I've used both, and I agree with you, plasma grenades are way more useful - more flexible because of the weight, since you can carry six (roughly) for one mini-nuke, and you don't have to worry about blowing yourself up as much with grenades vs. Fat Man. 
---
Great post! I completely agree.
---
People are angry because Bethesda shot the cook instead of properly balancing the game. 
---
It's a culmination of things, man.  This subreddit was the last bastion of positivity for 76.  People will accept flaws, mistakes, and bugs all day. 
---
When you combine those issues with people feeling like they got royally screwed over, screwed out of their time, and left with useless builds after hundreds of hours of play, you can expect good will to be flushed down the toilet.  
---
Same happened to me and I factory reset my Xbox. That uninstalled FO76 ,which I'm fine with at this point. I mean when a game update fools me into thinking my Xbox broke it's time for that game to go.
---
I can't defend this game and frankly i almost to quit playing Fallout76 entirely....
---
Do you happen to know "how" they implemented Agile? Did they have a coach guiding them? How many Agile professionals did they hire to help the group migrate to Agile? How much funds did they devote to migrating to Agile? The methodology itself is simple. The mindset is difficult to grasp.
---
I understand where you are coming from.  But....  They are actively fixing hundreds of the problems. So instead of making a big scene about it just don't play for a month or so and then try it again just like you would any other game.  I don't disagree with the problems you've stated but I have had over a hundred hours easily of game time and the majority has been fun.  So even if I wanted to complain the fact is I have more than gotten my $60 worth and the fact that dlc will come for free is awesome. 
---
I actually got a drop of calibrated ultracite shock plans (Pre-patch)... got all happy, made some Ultracite Legs, then looked at the MATERIALS required to make the Shocks...  
---
 5 or 10 of some Pure Flux or another? Ah crap.  Don't have that. 
---
I hear it may even become a regular winter occurrence, hooray! 🎉 
---
☃️😵☃️
---
Haha, your post made me laugh. But yes exactly this! I only disconnected once last night. Explosive and two shot combo is still way, way, way OP. The knowing plans tag is freakin awesome. The whining really comes down to one-shotting everything like you said. Some people you just can't seem to make happy.
---
How much
---
Fallout 4 released over 3 years ago... I felt like pointing out that some issues have been around for almost 17 years would have been nuking a dead brahmin...
---
I'm quitting for the time to because of the lack of content but I'll come back when there's more 
---
We are only a little more than 2 months out from launch. I have played many MMOs since Ultima Online that suffered major issues in balance and bugs after launch. WoW is a prime example, took several months for Blizzard to get that game in shape. And every expansion introduced new balance issues and bugs. It is part and parcel of the genre's development. 
---
This game will smooth out in time and I am patient enough to wait. There is no subscription for this game, and I feel that I have gotten my money's worth already. If Bethesda fails to keep moving in a forward direction, then I will look elsewhere for a place to kill time. But I played for about 6 hours last night after the patch and did not notice anything game breaking, took a tad bit more ammo for me to finish my hunting rounds. Granted, I play a sneak sniper and ocassionally use grenades. I do not do nuke zones, because I prefer to not play in PA. Didn't have a single disconnect, no lag. Was actually one of the smoothest play sessions I have had in a while. 
---
Only thing of note after the patch was the number of bags laying around whose contents would not load, especially near station stashes. I would assume these were the result of people dumping stuff that took them well over the 1500 carry weight.

I had this issue even before the patch, but after the patch it often coincides with getting stuck in my power armor and my headlamp no longer works in first person.
---
Wood is pretty good for stealth sniper builds, so I've heard. My only issue with it is how frequently it drops.
---
My TSE is a double barrel and my BE is a combat. Maybe it's the weapon type but also last night I couldn't get the BE combat shotgun to reliably produce the same number, idk what it was. Will try again tonight. But the highest I could get it nude and all shotgun perks was 408 to the TSE's 415
---
So the problem with the game is the players. 
---
I think Bethesda is hiring, btw.
---
Probably emergency patch
---
The hate/bashing would keep it from being a constructive discussion. Plus, the complexity of the code likely is keeping them busy tracking down the cause of the reported issues. 
---
 That said, I agree - having them give us some details of what they are doing would be great just so we can feel that we are being heard.
---
Everything being explored is gone now. There are systems with no outposts etc.
---
I think I have seen a few of these "i'm done" posts. I definitely understand where a lot of people are coming from with theae things as some things have frustrated me, but overall I am still enjoying the game. I think the main difference though is that I don't get to play very often. Finally hit level 27. I am still having fun, but most of the people making these posts are high level and have done everything there is to do. Not defending bethesda as there are definitely problems, but I think the majority of players have not sunk as much time into the game. I don't think Bethesda is as focused on giving you guys new content. Though, I was expecting something new around the 3 month mark as they are treating this as an ongoing game. A little disappointed that this update ended up being that survival mode tbh, but I might give it a try
---
That's the second step! :D Right, Bethesda?!?!?! :)
---
Never said thanks to a bus driver or waiter? 'Manipulated' for saying thanks lol you sound fun.
---
I use anti armor on gunslingers so I lucked out there, but I used a TSE pipe sniper which used to do 1500 damage. It definitely was op, but they went too far with 70% overall reduction. It does 409 damage now lol
---
I'm not storming anything.  Not even a little bit.  They can, and will, do whatever they want to do with their game.  I'm just looking for the next ride before this bus drives straight off of the cliff.  
---
I noticed the only people who stopped signing on from  my friends list were the ones that typically complained alot (over the smallest detail) that I only added because  they initiated the contact. So its a relief, I don't have to  deal with the cry babies anymore!
---
I'm sure the CM's are frustrated/stressed themselves. To read these posts and only be able to respond with "passing this along" is not a fun job. To me that can mean one of two things and neither are encouraging. Either they are dealing with the typical corporate bs where they are just not getting any constructive info to pass along or they have been told explicitly not to say anything damning (transparent)- just comment regularly to show you're there. 
---
It has those all those drawbacks, and more! All for the price of your time and sanity!
---
This post is about PVE, not PVP. 
---
If you truly want to argue on how to best approach making game balanced for both PVE and P, A damage buff for guns all around fixes that.
---
Right now, a base hunting rifle takes about 10 shots to kill me. A TSE takes Seven, if you’re on the head. That’s UNACCEPTABLE.
---
My powerfist kills all enemies with 1 Swing, and in about 10 seconds for somebody running Sentinel assassin.
---
That’s pitiful levels of “balance”.
---
The queen is impossible in groups with guns only. The scaling goes up too High too fast. Now our friends with none of that legendary stuff, can’t kill the queen. 
---
Now we have a separation in game play. 
---
That needs focus. PVP is secondary.
---
Yeah, everyone can see where he's coming from now that he doesn't have the chameleon effect.
---
sounds good, will you be on in ~ 3 hours ? little busy at the moment 
---
First of all I'm melee build and have no TSE since I've never found one. But nice try. 
---
I did notice that bird bones was much more noticeable in power armor also so that makes sense. Hope they fix it without breaking everything else.
---
Agreed with everything. If you want a mod that does this for FO4, see this:
---
[Power Armored Gunplay and Heavy Heavy Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35186)
---
It makes power armor remove recoil and sway from guns, makes heavy weapons weigh far more and do way more damage, and the minigun has so much recoil it's almost unusable without power armor.
---
Now that I'm done self-promoting: the problem isn't just the heavy weapons themselves, it's Bethesda's approach to enemy resistances and how that impacts high fire rate low damage weapons.
---
Notice how almost all non-explosive heavy weapons are low base damage and high fire rate. Yet the only one that isn't is the gatling gun, and you've rightly pointed out it's the only one that is practical and doesn't need a buff.
---
For some reason Fo4 and Fo76 has enemies that go up in damage resistances as well as health.
---
A lvl 50 scorched with no shirt has way more armor than a level 1 scorched with no shirt. As well as way more health. A high level super mutant will take 10% damage when a visually identical lower level super mutant will take five times that damage.
---
This is done across the board as each enemy variant gains health and DR and ER. Look at enemies in Fo76edit or Fo4edit/Creation Kit.
---
As DR exponentially reduces damage dealt, automatic weapons go from great early on to useless at higher level.
---
Bethesda should've completely rethought how they did damage resistances. There was no logic to it. DR was treated as a second health stat. DR is what causes most of the bullet-sponginess in late game, not health.
---
All that accomplishes is filtering out automatic weapons at higher levels.
---
The early Fo76 patch to make automatic weapons do +20% damage across the board was useless.
---
When I was playing around in the CK, I found the best way to make the minigun balanced in Fo4 is to make it ignore DR. That sounds crazy, but I tried it and it is as if that was how the minigun was meant to be. It is the same against level 1 raiders with no innate DR but does 4 times more damage against mid-level enemies with 30-50 DR before armor and 8 times more damage against enemies in the glowing sea which go up to 100DR. As enemies went up in health anyway, it was still challenging to fight enemies in the late-game. 
---
I think this is testament to how bad the approach to damage resistances is.
---
Having said that, energy weapons will always be at a disadvantage as heavy weapons because armor penetration perks and legendary effects don't work on them.
---
In the game files ballistic weapons deal regular damage, energy weapons are listed as dealing 0 damage but having an on-hit effect for spell damage of type energy.
---
The legendary anti-armor mod adds an enchantment, that adds an effect to the player, that adds a perk, that uses an entry point function to 'mod target damage  resistance' and multiply it by 0.5. There is no entry point framework for target energy resistance modding. Fallout 4 had the same problem. Regular damage and spell damage are handled completely differently, there is no way energy weapons could be given percentage-based resistance penetration.
---
Just so you know, anti-armor is useless on purely energy damage weapons, similarly the 'stabilized' perk doesn't allow them to penetrate energy resistance either.
---
Also completely agree on explosive heavy weapons, a missile does as much damage as a melee hit. Carrying the heavy ammo is totally not worth it.
---
As for the way weapons degrade, it seems to be based on the amount of enemies you hit, which is utterly ridiculous. It needs to be completely reowrked. This simply can't be reconciled with explosive weapons which are all heavy weapons, as splash damage will quickly degrade durability.
---
I had a missile launcher that I almost completely broke on a single mirelurk queen because I kept hitting a load of mirelurk hatchlings she was constantly spawning which took massive chunks out of the weapon's durability. Yet when using it on a single target it seems slow to break.
---
Think you lot are going a bit overboard with this whole thing, I doubt Todd Howard is 100% to blame, maybe the shareholders have some blame too 
---
This is part of the new patch that has destroyed the game. You can find more details on bethesda's website or this link https://fallout76.enjin.com
---
I'm on the phone looking at them now but I really want to peek at them later on my monitor , I might need to steal that nuke for my screensaver rotation ( it made me laugh when you mentioned what  perks worked best  for  photography , I used to play a game called city of heroes and for taking the best pictures or videos you wanted to adjust your characters height scale to the smallest you could get and make sure to take fly this way you could get these really great angles on other characters )
---
No, just launched a nuke.
---
You’d think so but it’s hardcore fanboys not as much casuals.
---
Well done post.  👍😉
---
I feel bad that community managers are stuck getting the full force of the hate when management, higher ups and the devs make the call on what gets fixed and when and what gets added. Their job is to communicate with us and give information to the development and management teams... not to fix or code the game. 
---
Still wanting it? 
---
As a Toledo (Little Detroit) native I can substantiate this statement.
---
Pay what you will.
---
Bethesda will charge you what it takes to make. We can’t expect them to operate at a loss. 
---
Everyone’s a critic, but precisely zero of you and the rest of us armchair critics have a comprehensive idea of the finance-raising, commercial and technical challenges that go into a project as complex as an MMO on a complex creation engine with a myriad of interplay between many game mechanics and a buttload of balancing, never mind cat and mouse with exploits and exploiters. You have **no idea** what it takes to make, so you have precisely zero input into the what it should cost conversation. Don’t want to pay what it costs? Don’t. You’re a consumer, that’s your prerogative. But what it costs is a product of what it cost to make, and nowhere does it say that fallout and Fortnite or whatever $45 early access title you have in mind cost the same to make. The chances of that are nil. 
---
I agree Bethesda didn’t communicate well enough that this game will follow a model of post launch development. 
---
nuke silo is maybe the only painful part, and not the whole silo, but the fix reactor in time section, when you cant just slowly stealth the whole area. And its only assaultrons that are hard. I was doing it in stealth and shitty armor. I died to assies only and can agree here. 
---
But on the other hand, you can do exactly this part in PA, then stash it back 
---
I bought that one. "Kitchen Stove," I think. Which is just a prop, instead of "Cooking Stove."
---
I want these.
---
Dude, you missed the best experience in the game!  Go back up, put your PA on and jump off!
---
One other item of note, you HAVE to equip the Berserker weapon to see the actual numbers.  Looking at it in someone else's or even your inventory won't work.  Also, when equipped, the Berserker weapon skewed the numbers of other weapons.  It's very odd.
---
Quit with this “mass exodus” garbage. It’s simply isn’t grounded in reality, but rather a byproduct of internet sensationalism.
---
Yep, i clocked over 2k hours just in Fallout 3, after a month of 76 i went back to 3 and my heart melted with the joy i felt and i noticed what a shallow husk 76 is in terms of being a fallout game :(
---
This is true, but I haven't played nowhere near 500 hours, maybe about 100 hours and even before that I did everything that this game had to offer. I feel like this game really owes me at least a couple more months of good playtime, but I can only launch so many nukes or rebuild my camp so many times before it's just stale gameplay. When Anthem hits I will probably take a break and come back when I see they have more content, and stop screwing up my builds by changing cards so drastically.
---
IDGAF, I just wish we could sell plans. If we can buy them, why can't we sell them?
---
You're delusional. If you advertise a product (a game in this case) and people buy it but it turns out to be nothing like advertised (remember 16 times more detailed? I do) and plays like an early access title with game-breaking bugs, massive stability issues and more then you can be damn sure I will complain. I did \*not\* pay for an early access title. I was looking forward to what was supposed to be coming but instead got a low quality Fallout 4 mod. The world may be beautiful but it's empty and buggy.
---
You don't think people reported bugs in the 'BETA' test? That's laughable in itself. It was not a true beta test, very few games these days do true beta tests. At best you will get access to an older build to help stress test their servers. The fact is many bugs were reported but reporting it doesn't mean it will be fixed. If you want to push that aside for a moment then please tell me how the Lever Gun reload action, a bug that was never fixed in Fallout 4, was still present until recently? It was known about for literally years but still present. If this doesn't show you that reports are ignored then nothing will.
---
Last point. You are so keen to get rid of people who you disagree with or have them go away. Anyone that bought this abomination is entitled to their opinion. 
---
I am contributing to say, even with properly building people aren’t one hitting that shit without exploiting, melee isn’t OP, exploiting is OP
---
Yes. I'm on right now with my team, GT is ActualGarbage68
---
Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, FO3, New Vegas, FO4 and now, Fallout 76.
---
Out of all those games, what does Fallout 76 have that none of the others do?  Online play with OTHER PEOPLE.
---
I don't give a fuck if you glitch the fuck out of the games you play with yourself on your own computer. But, why exploit a system where it might effect another player?
---
I made a write-up using Cranberry Bog enemies, hold on I'll give you a link
---
409 is still insane tbh.l, my anti armour dragon does about the same and how long does that take to reload?
---
But then again I have anti armour and tank killer on so most of damage hits home directly.  
---
My AA lever action rifle does around 200 damage and one shots almost everything from stealth, especially with criticals.
---
My main issue with the latest patch is that when I open VATS it’s completely random as to what body part is targeting initially AND they changed the order they cycle through.
---
It used to always target body first then go to head.  Now body is after head AND I’m usually targeting an arm or a leg randomly at first and have to go through 3-5 body parts to get where I want to target.
---
I can't keep friends playing the game.
---
I lose friends faster than I acquire them.
---
They're not leaving because of bugs (all multiplayer games have them), things are too OP (melee still is), or small QOL stuff (the mods actually did a better job with this than the studio).
---
They're leaving because they're BORED.  Yawning.  There's nothing to DO.  It's like you're playing single player Fallout in tandem with your buddies, but they beat the main quest and QUIT.
---
We need CONTENT.  Dial back the bug fixes and pick the 20 worst ones to work on.  Make sure there's CONTENT in each patch we can get excited about.
---
I also just hit 60 and had a bit more than 10,000 caps after fast-travel expenses. Same deal as you, diligently vendor hopping every-single-day, looting super-mutants, and doing events.   
---
I spent 4,000 on mutation serums from other players. Spending 5,000 on each of the one or two endgame mods (Calibrated Shocks and/or Jet Pack) doesn't seem that bad to me. I think I'm going to go down to almost zero caps, but it seems I'll be close to having everything I need for a long while, and could try to sell modded parts back to others to recoup some of the expense, though I'm sure I cannot compete with better stocked vendors. 
---
Nah its nice to see plans ive never seen in over 2 months of normal play. Though i cant afford most of them. 
---
When you spawn in, do not bring up the pipboy. When I spawn in I can move freely and do just about anything, but if I bring up my pippy within like a minute of spawning in, I'll be frozen. You've got to give it a couple minutes to fix itself.
---
I'm only assuming to know your issue here.
---
I bet it’s because there’s a new dup glitch in the bathroom on the plane
---
Not the joke I was making. It seems like "the devs know" is posted on pretty much every concern posted on this sub, but how many months has it been? The game is only getting worse, not better.
---
My comment was making light of the fact that it seems the only thing the devs have done is say, "yeah we know" and haven't fixed anything. Now, I don't want to blame them. I believe it's probably a leadership issue at Bethesda.
---
&gt;So much negative press and criticism, you think that would light a fire under their team to prove everyone wrong and strive to make massive improvements.
---
Legitimate question: Is this how you go about your day job? Is that how you feel in situations like this?
---
Like, when people piss on what you/your team was able to do with your timeline/budget/whatever-other-constraint, does it "light a fire under" you to do better next project...or is it just frustrating because people outside of the process clearly don't understand the limitations you're working with?
---
Not trying to be a huge dick here, just...the reality here is that this a *job* for the dev team, one that I'm sure they're passionate about and I'm sure they're pretty disappointed by the reaction their work is getting, but a lot of people across a lot of threads are questioning their abilities/work ethic/whatever with virtually *zero* perspective on what jobs like this are like.
---
They *are* making improvements. The put out a fucking *patch* yesterday with improvements this community has been asking for for weeks. They made some changes you don't like, they reverted to an earlier build which you make assumptions about, and they haven't released the specific "improvement"  that you wanted yet and all of a sudden the sub is having a goddamn meltdown. Just because it wasn't enough/wasn't what you wanted/whatever doesn't mean they haven't been putting out improvements. The game has been out for only *2.5 months*.
---
I'm fine with whining about specific things you want done, but shit like this and the approximately 10,000 posts about "I'M QUITTING" is just an unproductive bore.
---
Cap collector DID not get nerfed, nor is it broken, but it does work differently than before. It now works more like the Can-do and the Pharma Farmer perks.
---
Each container has a base amount of caps, and with the cap collector you can search for more caps. One thing I noted is that if you swap cap collector in while nearby/within visible range of the cap stash, you have to leave the area and come back for the search option to show up.
---
Another thing I noted is not all cap stashes behave the same, some I was able to take the base caps + search for more, one was empty, but I was able to search it for 300 ish caps, and a couple had 300-600 caps but I was unable to search them. Im curious if this is due to other players though looting but not searching, or searching and it not loading. Im gonna do some more tests tonight to see if those same stashes behave the same tonight.
---
The best part is cap stash container are always present now, which makes it easier to find even if someone else or you have already looted it. Where as before if someone had looted the stash, the container disappeared and if you didnt know it spawned there, you never would unless it wasnt looted when you were there. You can also use the perception perk to find them if they havent and even if they have been looted. Before you could only find them if they hadnt been looted.
---
&gt;we just got her to regen before running out of time.
---
Because some noobs showed up to your event at the last minute, that happens every time some one shows up, she regens and gets tougher. 
---
You're welcome and good luck.  
---
But I can still one-shot a lvl 91 deathclaw
---
I had a 1shot fest back and forth between another player, both of us were melee. Eventually I switched to my gun I had no perks with and to my surprise still instantly killed him, and then he instantly killed me with his gun making the whole use of melee rather pointless aside from saving ammo, which I have plenty of anyways.
---
I have around 350 Armor idk how much he had but it wouldn't matter much, it's all meaningless in PvP. All players are squishy and if they somehow aren't then Armor Pen will bring them back to squishy.
---
Its literally not their job to fix the game.... its their job to communicate with the community and the staff team of what we want and what needs to be fixed. They arent the ones going into the code, or or working on the servers. You could say their job is to listen, respond and pass along information...
---
Send more nukes.
---
Then just keep submitting tickets to Bethesda n keep posting eventually the problems will get noticed. I agree that this shit should be different n I wish it was different but all we can do is keep putting our voices out there n refining our message until it does gain traction. Post about the problems you encounter n try to avoid talking  to those who are pissed off that their character is now garbage. They are upset they wasted time n possibly money on creating an OP character that now is nothing but average. I am currently sitting in my camp looking at the ammo bench saying I have all the required items to craft some 5.56 ammo n it isn’t allowing me to craft it. These are the issues that need fixing the real broken shit. 
---
Yes. 13 points strength (9 in damage perks, 4 in defense), 3 points bloody mess, 1 point tenderizer, 1 point adrenaline. And the twisted muscles mutation for another 25%. Here's an [old screenshot](https://imgur.com/IrqANQW) but the damage number is 158 now instead of 138 and it's now spiked for bleed damage.
---
I don't have anything bloodied/unyielding. I know those builds go much higher.
---
You guys seeing our feedback isn't helpful. You've been seeing our feedback for months. This last patch pushed a large number of daily players away. Is this the goal? Be honest with us, what is going on over there?? Do you guys actually care about us, or was this just a paycheck and no one was ready for the responsibility of an online game? Have any of you PLAYED a Fallout game? Because this is becoming less Fallout with each patch. Fix the game.
---
please adjust the scorched beasts If they were annoying before, now they are a nightmare, bullet sponges too annoying with a devastating attack 
---
&gt;But the old adage Action Speaks louder then words.
---
So all those people who call for boycotts should just go and do something instead of talking about it?
---
Well in 2017 inplated on xbox and it was buggy as all get out
---
I'm not. Thinking of either starting witcher 3 or replaying torment. 
---
We're looking into a fix for this with the hopper as well. I don't have an exact date just yet, but it is on the list.
---
Holy cow, 460 to 164?  Was it a TSE?  Or was that just the explosive perks?
---
I'd prefer randomised plans over overpriced plans any day. 
---
This is why I said budget.
---
They are not giving the bug fix/patching team more budget. 
---
Thanks for advice, got the suppressor today))) Just after TSE were nerfed like 40 times down)))
---
I guess they are just going to leave it as for now, at least a week I bet. Seems like a bad idea but what do I know, I'm no professional AAA developer. You do you, Bethesda.
---
You can always argue that it's not grindy FOR YOU. You can say that just about anything, and on any subject. It is exactly that for a lot of other players, tho. And since they nerfed the living shit out of durability perks, arguably, it just got grindier.
---
I'm rocking enforcer, shotgunner and level 3 demolition, and it took me 10-15 rounds to take out a level 65 albino deathclaw. What am I missing?
---
Discussing is fine,but at some point talk is talk. Actions need to back up the talk.
---
nvm peace
---
....I was referring to the guy you replied to, not you.
---
Lower your shields.
---
Yep, patch related. It used to default to torso. 
---
I can keep a secret, it's the people I tell who can't. :)

Finny, kinda looks like the SB is taking the selfie.

Oh by the way:

That’s supposed to happen, she is a three star legendary and they can regenerate 2-3 times.
---
Usually you don’t see it on other legendaries as they die too fast.
---
I saw the bug too though.
---
Good job Bethesda, you’re right up there with high schoolers at writing code and right up there with pre schoolers at using source control 
---
Lol yeah, can I get a refund for that power armor paint
---
Some people made the best of the game despite its issues. Others jumped on the hate train early and excessively and want to have their "I told you so!" moment. 
---
I am not ashamed to say I have, for the most part, enjoyed the game despite its shortcomings. However, we continue to see questionable game design decisions and mistakes in a game that really just doesn't have the quality, content, or player base to stand up to it. 
---
&gt; Just remove the duped items from the game!
---
They can't track them.
---
Yes if I did my job and the overwhelming view was that it needed improvements I'd certainly at the very least be sure the content and changes made were 100 and without issue.
---
Also its not unproductive. I've stood by this game and defended it for months now ans they continually F it up over and over. They need to see we've had enough. 
---
Hey, at least that's some CONTENT :)
---
I can tell my friends "Todd came by and knocked me out while I was fighting the SBQ".  They'd say "You SAW him in-game???"  I'd say "No, he was AT MY HOUSE.  Kicked in the front door, punched me in the back of the head.".  10/10 would enjoy that CONTENT again :)
---
That is literally the only reason i wanted to run the queen in the first place
---
Wait... Did you forget Expert and Master Shotgunner?
---
With just standard mods I had a double barrel doing 110 at level 25.  That's 220 per double.  But, you know, had to get close.  
---
And I hadn't even BEGUN the shotgun tree.
---
same. 
---
I know right?!?
---
Well you replied to my comment not his. 
---
People are just much more fragile these days. :(
---
This is definitely something to consider. 
---
I'd also like more events.  And they could add QUICK FUN content by doing this:
---
I need to replay Witcher 3 I was 40 hours in and got hit with that delete save bug on Xbox that erased your save on console and cloud. After that I lost the energy and desire to play Witcher 3. I need to go back and play it. The best game this generation in a lot of people opinions.
---
Your endless devotion to this game won't get anything fixed. The devs love dumb fucks like you who would play with a moldy turd and screech at anyone who trys to tell you you're playing with a piece of shit.
---
You can use your return money for some play-doh or some adult coloring books.
---
if you have spent any time reading here you know that can happen and what to do about it.
---
&gt;  Ah the old balance for pvp and screw up pve problem. 
---
literally 99% of all balance passes. 
---
Bullies need someone to pick on. They might dabble in the new mode, but will quickly tire of lack of defenseless targets to annoy. They just need to make it so that pacifist mode means u do 0 dmg to players and they do none to you. But then the griefers will just find new ways to make themselves a pain in the ass, like blocking doorways etc. 
---
25 euro all over the internet, sometimes can get it even a little cheaper with discounts
---
Black Friday prices had the game down to $35 in some places (standard edition), and it pre-ordered and launched with a $60 price tag.
---
That’s exactly what it feels like. 
---
it's pretty rare to log in and immediately get attacked.    
---
the respawn locations are specifically chosen to be away from enemy spawn location.  
---
It's conceivable maybe some other player has trained some enemies to the location but I'd guess that might happen once every thousand times you log in.  I've never had it happen to me personally.
---
You’re close to a logical equivalency. It would be like getting undercooked or rotten food every time you eat at the restaurant and then leaving a 4 star review because the waiter made sure your water glass was always topped off.
---
I felt the same way when I got Destiny 2. Turns out I just needed a break from the genre, not any specific game within it.
---
Legendary in general is totally buged. Some with no star have the legendary prefix and drop legendary loot, some dont, some have stars not dropping stuff. I had a ghoul drop even 2 legendaries. Bug or feature 🤔
---
&gt; and the TSE combo reaching its full overpowered potential. 
---
I think its really just the TSE shotgun that was ridiculous. And not necessarily the overall damage, but the range.
---
The lower-end TSEs, TSs and the Es are all now absurdly under-powered compared to melee.
---
And energy weapons are a joke.
---
Don't nerf things until they're ***useless and no fun to use.***
---
https://i.redd.it/hkz23vv0zz811.gif rise up gamers
---
I'm of the opinion that legendary effects shouldn't ever be providing a non-situational damage bonus of double what you can do without them. A legendary effect should add a reasonable bonus or fun mechanic, anything else means that until you get that appropriate legendary enemies will either be needlessly irritating to kill without these ridiculous damage boosts, or pathetically easy with them. Neither is a good place for the game to be.
---
You also still don't seem to be understanding the math though. If neither TS or E are edge cases, which they aren't with the nerf, the power of their interaction isn't meaningful. Most other interactions become just as powerful.
---
There is still the problem of the primary effects tier being overcrowded with decent effects though, and the secondary tier only having explosive and better criticals be worth a damn. That is something that needs to be fixed. 
---
But, we've all stopped getting SPECIAL points by now, we've all launched nukes, etc. Don't you feel like you're just going to buy all the plans you want and then have nothing to work towards? 
---
Try clicking in the vent in the map. It will "fast travel" you into the event. That happened me today. I got to the island and it didn't start. I click the vent in the map and essentially jumped to the same place and it started. If you left-click on the event in the map (on PC) sometimes it doesn't let you click "Join Event." You have press ENTER once the option is up. I know, I know, it's a lot to get through to just join an event, but I need caps. There are plans to buy! LOL
---
I have a jack of all trades build, so I was only doing 400 dmg before the patch and just under 200 now. 15 shots is crazy though. It feels balanced to me 2 shoting lvl 65 glowing ones.
---
Not true for some guns. My explosive lmg only did 72 damage, now it does 19.
---
Yes shotguns have always been strong option, especially levelling up.
---
I had a issue like what you are seeing. If I tried to look at my pip boy  before the game completely loaded I would not be able to move. But I could still look at my map. I had to make sure everything was good before I did anything and that fixed the issue.
---
I went through about 5 different error messages before finally getting in! Once in the game it was very buggy though with textures not rendering and my latest checkpoint not loading.  Keep trying and it should hopefully work for you. Good luck!
---
I was just able to log in /out from Xbox.
---
True the hate bashing is getting out of hand so it may not help. Maybe in-game surveys or just posts for what their weekly goals are would be great. 
---
I just recently realized the death tambo was a tambourine

If you're on PC now is never a better time to jump back into Fallout 4. The Sim Settlement developers just released Conqueror, which is basically something I've wanted from Fallout 4's settlement mechanic since the beginning; faction controlled and built settlements that you can take over with your own group. It's only for the raiders right now but will be expanded in the future. Modding is still going strong, and I've still barely touched the vanilla content :P
---
I tried to play last night for about 5 mins.  I logged in and look at the map for about two mins.  No missions, only two beginning events, so nothing really to two.  30 seconds after that, the game crashed.  Ok, well that was weird. So, started the game and logged back in.  Decided to move my camp and make a nice cozy house.  So, I fast traveled to a spot I was at before.  Enroute, the game crashes so hard it totally restarts my xbox after making this horrible noise.  
---
Sooooo..... this game is so bad it can physically damage my counsel.  I'll log back in after the next major update in a few months.
---
I found one at the golf course below the golf club just below south west gate there’s 2 golfers bodies there with a golf bag I see a lot of Flatwoods monsters and moth men there I had my base next to it and saw them a lot mainly the moth man but the Flatwoods monster to
---
To go from 100+100+100 is 300%.  
---
To go to 100+25+25 is 150 %.
---
That's literally halving the damage.  Or 75% reduction in the increase.  Where's the 210% come from?  
---
This hours to dollars comparison has got to go. Its a red herring at best.
---
Some people are lucky with cards and others with the ladies others like you accel in grammer we all shine a lil different than each other I won't judge you for that,shine on you crazy diamond 
---
Alright then
---
Yea i went at the farm south of Watoga station and was like "welp...fuck this noise"
---
On the plus side, Shadow of the Tom Raider is fun so far
---
Even through all of it I still enjoy FO76 and don’t regret it but you absolutely should have gotten RDR2 over basically any other game in 2018. 
---
I did.
---
It took me two shots to take down a level 15 ghoul, level 109 and maxed out rifle man + demolition. Same lever rifle, I was shocked at how much it got nerfed lol
---
Woah! You guys rock! Keep up the great work! Better buy the devs more energy drinks!
---
Idiots like op dont understand it. Im sure bethesda has a threshold and if player users fall below that then the game will be abandoned.
---
Hells yes.  There are already players that grind the atom rewards like crazy.  Give them some rewards to help make the game better :)
---
Tbh tho TS was my minigun's only saving grace, but real shit people are complaining way too much 
---
But, here’s the deal if This thing actually happens..
---
You get to choose how you play, adventure vs survival AND it should route you to pve or pvp.
---
but IF you decide to be a jerk and lie, stating you want to pve but REALLY bully lowbies, my hope as soon as you do slap damage, you get whisked away to pvp land.
---
THAT will stop griefers. Because in pve land all they know is everyone below them WONT FIGHT.
---
BUT, as soon as you’re in survival mode, you don’t know how the levels go, OR how mean folks can be..
---
I grabbed an LMG from an enemy, figured I was gonna start running Appalachia like I was Wehrmacht, 1942, rolling the steppes.  
---
It was shit.  So disappointing!
---
&gt; The end game is just non existent.
---
You say this, but then you also say:
---
&gt; I played the game pretty much daily since the beta.
---
&gt; I can get more XP and level up, but I'm already a 100.
---
&gt; I've explored the whole map, I've done all the events, I've launched nukes and fought the queen.
---
Buddy, you've gotten hundreds of hours in this game and are complaining there is no end game. You beat the end game, you're done. Games don't go on for an enternity.
---
😂 
---
I am not seeing the discount on PS4

You average 5.5 hours a day playing this?  Dang.  That's dedication. 
---
Yuuuuuuuup!!!! 
---
They absolutely consider these things, look at the White Knight Nerf, armor wasnt breaking fast enough for them.  Ttk is a factor they consider when adjusting weapon damage, more time more durability loss.  Chasing your tail (get mats to repair so you can get more mats) is the only end game, they know this and extend it through nonsense like this.  Make the smart choice, jump off the wheel.
---
Xbox live service connection being crushed under the weight of tens of thousands of super heavy Bobby pins. Tonight at eleven.
---
Thats probably the saddest part about this backlash. But LadyDevann really keeps it up. Her latest comments are different, adressing how mad everyone is. Im sure atleast the CMs understand us, still i cant understand the devs at this point tbh. 
---
Cheers, it took a while but I got on :) 
---
That would be nice. I don't think Obsidian would screw it up as much as Bethesda. Though prior to 76 I was a huge Bethesda fan.
---
Hm, hadn't bothered mathing it. I submit to your mathematical superiority good sir. Have my upvote.
---
(Seriously though, instantly spotting that is rather impressive.)
---
But, it is their job to fix the game? Their job is to communicate, but where is the communication? just because you think they are listening, doesn't mean anything.  Like I said, I could listen all you want, doesn't mean I'll do anything about it. You don't praise a company for listening, you praise them for taking actions, which, where are they? No actions that I see. 
---
doesn't work at all for me.  Other people report the same.
---
Without his one shot wonder, what does he have left to live for!? Oh the humanity!
---
Has Bethesda done anything you’ve correctly predicted?
---
  Well, as a player with no "mules" and only a few thousand caps, I think they've reduced what was (to me) a vital part of the reward pool. I enjoyed recieving a plan I was searching for as a reward for a quest or for putting in the time to explore. I was thrilled when I finally got the Handmade plans from doing an event. 
---
Thanks /u/theBiggestAss for the “idiot” remark.  Very constructive. 
---
I think this guy is stuck in a logical loop fallacy
---
That doesn't work because it's a different scenario.
---
In your scenario I would complain to the waiter. I wouldn't be a twat to them. They didn't cook the food and I understand that. If they genuinely did their best to fix it but the kitchen weren't giving them the right things then I would say thanks for trying but I'm leaving.
---
If somebody in our group was being a dick to the waiter; I would also tell them they are being a dick.
---
You're saying we should be a dick to our waiter. I disagree with you hugely.
---
Those are some very good points. 
---
Update- looks like they're back again.  Weird.  
---
I'm in, so are we talking like a discord server or what?
---
It's definitely a hard and mostly thankless job.
---
But it's as important if not more important than the development side.  If you don't know what the customers want, everything you do will be a disaster no matter how hard you try....lol
---
Not sure if you are serious, but either way, nice shots.
---
Wasn’t any need for a personal attack man, maybe ya should chill out and not be so quick to anger over a video game?
---
OP made nothing more than a simple joke post, which with how much toxicity is in this sub, is honestly pretty funny.
---
Yeah sadly my recent players list on PS4 only shows BFV which I haven't played in a month.
---
I’ve been playing the game on and off since Christmas (mainly due to school and events going on). I’m only around level 20 and I’m aiming to make a rifle or sniper build. Honestly with all these bad patches Bethesda is pushing out, it’s making it harder for me to want to play the game with the time I have. 
---
Also I’m sorry to all of you that have invested so much time on this game to be repeatedly put down. Can’t imagine how annoying that must be.
---
One of us is going to have to go back in time and kill the other now to break the cycle. Its the only way. 
---
I absolutely agree with this. I also have a suspicion that played into the decision to release only through Bethesda launcher and not Steam.
---
So your suggestion is to include something that is already available in the game?
---
I really believe that they know nothing about any of the real word examples of these guns. The fact that you only need one point in strength to use it is funny.Real life weight is 84 lbs. The barrel alone is 24. A good way to change damage for the heavy weapons would be by crafting different ammo.  Armor piercing, incendiary, tracer stuff like that. 
---
Yes my want calibrated and jet pack. Maybe get jet pack first and I'll fly to each vendor from there on out! Woohoo!
---
No game is ever perfect. People are talking about how great RDR2 is but you see glitches in there all the time. And people just make fun and enjoy those “funny” glitches. Although it is a great game, why don’t those glitches get just as much flak?
---
I will also be the first to say that fallout needs a lot of work. And that is ok. This game has been a huge leap of faith for Bethesda and I think they are handling it as best they can. People don’t understand that they really do want a good game for us.
---
Also, can we talk about how much Bethesda has been communicating and fixing/updating the game? People rarely comment on the fact that they are putting in a lot of work. It’s not going to please everyone. And that’s ok, but that’s no reason to publicly bash a game just because you don’t like it.
---
What is even more interesting to me is that this type of behavior is exactly the same across any subject. Especially politics. Everyone thinks their opinion should be taken with the highest regard when the reality is is that some opinions really don’t matter.
---
I know the game has issues but I don't have a melee build and never had a TSE. My build is a sneak / sniper or a close up shot-gunner. It all depends on my mood.
---
Some days I even go full combat knife and sneak. 
---
Maybe you are referring to SB and SBQ in particular, then yes my combat knife doesn't help but my rifle damage with crits do make a difference on SB &amp; SBQ. Maybe because I never had a TSE I am used to fighting the SB for 10min and the SBQ for a little more depending on the amount of players joining in.
---
Also not a fan of automatic rifles or energy weapons so maybe those builds suck, I don't know.
---
see ya
---
I know right, instead of two shots with my gatling gun.. its 4! THE HUMANITY.
---
Well, after you jury rig a wii controller to steer your car for three months, getting that steering wheel installed will make you feel grateful nonetheless
---
Yeah.  You can tell I’m just teasing. Lol. Thanks. 
---
You gotta sit back and enjoy the drama. And maybe its a wake up call for the devs. Altough i doubt it. 
---
Games with micro transaction stores should be Free 2 Play, companies like Bethesda are trying to eat there cake and have it too.
---
Yes, taking a page out of blizzard might have helped Bethesda here. I’m glad the nerf happened but it was a little too much
---
I've had 3 level 80's land on me in whitesprings had robots to help me but it was stupid 
---
Who wants more nerfs? People want buffs to make it so the other weapons are just as viable. The enemies are already damage sponges, it doesn't need to be made worse by making melee just as weak.
---
I think they need to concentrate on developing content rather than trying to recoup losses with ie. Jackets. I also miss the story line and interacting with npc's. Being an ass in fallout 4 was fun and sometimes funny. Being an ass in this game is just griefing. 
---
oh wow. *you're* that someone, and you did it!
---
if im nitpicking, could use some video evidence as icing, but still dope that you did this. im surprised and disappointed that this hasn't gotten more traction, or that others haven't done the same. its crazy that cringy "im leaving" letters make the front page, but stuff like this is buried. you should also include your full perk build btw.
---
thanks for that.
---
Stop using 'we' when you're talking about your own opinions. I play the game because I enjoy it as it currently is, not because I 'want it to be good'. I don't know who would play a game they don't enjoy in the hope of it getting better... that would be stupid. You could just not play it UNTIL it gets better. 
---
Either this sub is getting crustier or a bunch of dipshits from the Fallout reddit are coming over trying to kick up a fuss. And frankly, since this whining shit happens every patch and then the community goes back to being normal, I think the latter is as likely as the former. 
---
A lot of the community likes gunplay and the most popular of the guns got hit with a 75-80% nerf.  Its not a progression issue because Melee is super powerful, it is just some people don't like melee, and there isn't good melee play in fallout like in other games.
---
Thankfully I happened to already be in watoga when the patch dropped, so I at least got to spend 16k caps on plans and pimp out my blackbird t51b before all the other bugs dropped upon me
---
That's really shitty what they did with the White Knight perk then.  Damn. I wouldn't want them doing that to power armor.  No idea why they did it to regular armor. 
---
Dude, people admitting their error rather than just ignoring their mistake may be expected in the real world, but not online.  You earned it for your honesty and sucking in the pride.
---
This.
---
Sorry, it was a random encounter weeks ago. :(
---
That's when bethesda spit in my face. Last time i buy games from them. I can easily play SP games without too much trouble.
---
&gt; Agree, it’s not lack of content but it’s a lack of interesting content that builds to lacklustre conclusion
---
No, I think it's also lack of actual content. The conclusion (if you can even call it a conclusion) is extremely underwhelming, but most of the individual beats from start to finish are pretty decent. 
---
But there aren't all that *many* beats. It's like... a *quarter* of a game. 
---
He had not remembered that kings are very difficult to kill! I had only thought of the scorched beasts, another bullet sponge to the list 
---
I figured it proceed on damage like how durability lost is based on damage. I do damage it has chance to proc. That would explain why it seems to proc on my sledge and fat man a lot more than my AGL or mini gun.
---
They should boost the damage of the fat man like crazy but make it really really hard to get ammo, that'd be more fun
---
rad worms
---
&gt;but even at launch there should be enough content to discover and replay for months.
---
According to Steam, I've played Skyrim for 450 hours, plus another 467 hours for SkyrimSE (free for those of us who already had Skyrim). That was also a $60 game. And with new mods all the time, it still holds my interest. Fallout76 is relatively empty, and I can't mod it to add content or fix the clumsiness of its user interface.
---
I think Judas posts in /r/Fallout, always slagging us off.
---
Nope. The plans are straight up free at fort defiance now. You can just read them off of a terminal.
---
Yes this one. Come find and crash my Ironman.
---
True, especially a $60 beta with a large micro-transaction store. But, you can earn the in-game currency which is kinda nice I guess??
---
I thought my Xbox one x was broken too.
---
&gt;I really am trying here
---
You're doing your job, why aren't others doing theirs?
---
5 strength really isn’t a lot. And I’m a pistol build, you seriously think I don’t have pistol damage cards equipped? I figured that would be obvious. “Pistols are inherently weaker weapons”.... isn’t that proving my point? The thing shoots fucking exploding bullets and your baseball bat hurts more. You just killed your own argument.
---
Saying I don’t understand how melee works... it’s the simplest build out there. You max strength, slugger/iron fist/gladiator, martial artist (plus 40% swing speed legendary LMAO), incisor (ignore 75% of armor, rifles only get 36%), maybe blocker, possibly the +40% power attack damage legendary. Your build is now extremely strong and you still have 45 perks to hand out. Haven’t even mentioned mutations yet. Talons gives 25% extra unarmed damage + bleed. Twisted muscles gives 25% melee damage.
---
If you want to go further, get unyielding armor, bloodied weapon, nerd rage, barbarian, radicool. Low health with rads, +3 strength per armor piece (5 pieces =additional 15 strength which directly applies to your damage output), 5 strength from radicool, 35 strength easy. Plus the bloodied weapon extra damage. Nerd rage gives 20% additional damage and 40 DR. Barbarian is +4 DR for every point of strength up to a max of 80. 4x35 means another 80 DR only because they capped it. 
---
Not saying everyone does that but don’t say I don’t understand how melee works. Also, being unarmed can be even stronger than one/two handed because of the speed so idk why you’d compare it to a pistol.
---
You sort of need a working game to have a playerbase.  Nice try though.
---
16 years. Light weight.  Gamin since Pong.
---
We are aware of this and are working hard to maintain it.
---
I just bought Subnautica : Below Zero and wait for it to download. Can't wait to play it !
---
Wrong. I bulked all my junk last week and freed up 50lbs. Also I dodnt downvote you. Lol.
---
Same frackjuice here
---
A working hotfix? Or a steaming pile of shit hotfix?
---
You talking about that dude that takes mutations and stacks the effect witha  team mate... yeah totally sure that's intended. 
---
thats mutations not melee thats the issue. 
---
It's a product that we as consumers have a right to criticize or support. I think that at this point in time, all the complaints are warranted. BGS fucked up.
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals  
---
I like it, more upbeat and positive 
---
Thank you, this saved me a headache.
---
Yeah, what about the post made you think that? Just curious. 
---
The problem is that it *says* it has 400/500/600 (faster firing legendary) RoF.
---
But compare that to any other gun and it's obviously way off.
---
The Atom Store content has probably been in the pipeline and on a release schedule.  I doubt it's being worked on to the cost of bug fixes and patches.
---
Does your main have any characters on that account that are also over the weight limit?
---
I've been hearing anecdotes (read: rumors) that the weight limit is imposing penalties account-wide?
---
no u
---
I mean it makes sense I guess, radiated worms crawling through a mutants body would most likely give them boosted abilities. 
---
I blame dark souls.  Hate me if you want but that is basically the game that started this "punish the player with the environment" trend.
---
Wish i could upvote you more. Degenerates don't just hang around the Butcher. I spent a good hour last night just doing some quiet hunting, and got a good stash of hides and meat. Was heading back to find a butcher, and passed this goon going in the opposite direction, but didn't have my gun out, show aggression or anything. Next thing he's turned around and knocked me off my horse to steal it, and my shit. Have to shoot him to stop it, so he spends the next 15 minutes deliberately coming after me to just shoot me in the head. I'm like "F**k off! All i want is peace. What's his problem?" In the end i just turned it off and went to bed with a good hour wasted. 
---
im gonna get far cry new dawn (doesnt come out for a couple of weeks)..its a dystopian environment as well..i also got metro redux recently 
---
Actually, it was a way of duping, so now only one terminal per Modus vendor works
---
I know, just found his phrasing funny lol. 
---
Lmao thank you. ActuaGarbage69 was taken 😂 we're full so send me a message when youre in and where to meet you
---
The shit you're trying to force as "negated effects" aren't mother fucking core gameplay features.  No one gives a shit about breathing underwater or negating radiation from food to even use the perks in the first place, they're fucking novelties.
---
White Knight was nerfed because unlike your dumb fucking ass Bethesda actually has all of the data on repair frequency and armor degredation rates for every single fucking person playing this game and obviously saw a trend they didn't think was good for the fucking game.
---
But no, that obviously can't be right because like all of the other fucking armchair devs here you obviously know better than the people actually in charge of the game.
---
Dude, if a few hit points (rather than piles and piles of stimpaks and perk crossovers) is the difference in you succeeding, then... wtf?
---
On PS4 if you are appearing offline, PlayStation does not track your recent players. It might track recents that way if you appear online! 
---
I found a low level queen at Freak Show on my way to fort defiance for the first time.  A level 38 walked by and it spawned the queen at such a low level.  22 or something like that.  
---
if you targeted a head last it remembers the target, if you target arms or legs it remembers 
---
a surprise, but a welcome one
---
Think you took some good shots, or about the seriousness part?
---
50?
---
Go look at the hot posts in this subreddit....
---
I'm kind of in the same boat to a degree.  I found my 1st excavator pa mod plan in the wild &amp; was so blown away.  Now it's jusy go to "X" &amp; buy it. 
---
 Seems to discourage exploration in my mind, but maybe i was actually one of the only ones to do so &amp; EVERYONE else just server hopped anyways.
---
the complaints have been transmitted by a bot, now let's forget about the problems with new objects in the atom store

gtfo outta here, there's plenty of evidence all over this forum. I am not PAID to fucking report errors, in fact, these motherfuckers are lucky that someone had the time to make an account and start reporting them BEFORE they lost their temper. 
---
Have fun with your shit eating grin, im sure bethesda has plenty more to stuff in your open mouth!
---
&gt;:D
---
Dude you are so deluded... How can it be otherwise? You actually think a majority of people enjoy this POS? Even after they slashed the price before XMAS? Next level fanboyism here.
---
One of my treasure maps has it as a landmark, but I never found the spot. I know there are two of them, but only one has high tension power line towers near it.
---
I had thought that Rosie would have been much more...invested...in Jackie's fate, than in the fate of the Raider leader who turned Wendingo, considering their relationship. But the most emotional response for a quest end was the Raider, unless you count befriending the Deathclaw.
---
I've heard that, with a Perk, someone did befriend a Deathclaw. I wonder if the quest has a different ending if you actually accomplish that.
---
QA team should try to kill SBQ every time balance is changed
---
ESO thing was at launch that it was being compared to Skyrim, those why people were like "This is nothing like Skyrim". After they stopped comparing it to skyrim, they realized that its new genre and when you take it as MMORPG it is not half bad. Similarity could be pulled with F76, where it is being compared to F4, while it should be taken as new genre and it should focus on players that play online gamers, rather than players who play offline games.
---
Zenimax Online, creators of ESO understood, that ESO aint gonna be game for Skyrim fans. At first ESO game light on content too. It had basically only two armor styles to chase- Imperial and Dark something, but  unlike from F76, they understood how mechanics should work or how the game generally should work. They didn't just put one big monster and called it an endgame. Well they recycled dungeons, that you played as low level, into heroic. Made bosses bit more dangerous. It wasn't really much, but it wasn't so random either. I mean healer still had to heal and think what he was was wearing or what skills he used. If they wanted to success healer could just come half ar#ed, sit in corner and get rewarded. You sucked at healing, you got kicked out of the party.
---
It was year later, when they dropped monthly sub and game started to shine. Game was polished and they started to show new dungeons and content that is coming. Few months later content started to roll out.
---
That's a knee slapper right there!   (sorry, not sorry)
---
If your on Xbox Warhammer Vermintide 2 and Starnge Brigade I heard was fun to play with friends and you can play them free if you have Game Pass.
---
There is some good games in game pass.
---
Also the Auto-Grenade Launcher is STILL not considered a heavy weapon by the Bear Arms perk and weighs the full 22.5 pounds with or without it.
---
Ok buddy. I must have had you confused for someone who complained about nerfs online. I didn't realize you were so indifferent you had to cry about it in this post.
---
Some amount of nerfing would have been fine with me, and I think most people.
---
Ladydevann just commented in another thread like 10 min ago that they're hoping to have a fix out by the end of the week, or early next week and will be making an announcement shortly
---
Some idiot dev thought that a tiny radius by the price sign was going to be obvious enough, rather than one covering the whole station building and lot.  Only thing that saved me on this challenge was a fellow redditor's post.
---
We've seen this requested so much its just a repost at this point
---
People are "crying" about the backstep on bobby pins, but it's really the magic wand being nerfed.  Isn't it.  
---
Great post.
---
I remember when The Secret World came out and they had one of those point stores for outfits (and tons of glitch filled quests), I got this fancy hat I liked off their store and it had a clipping issue with hair for like a year until they fixed it.
---
They are trying to force people rage quit so they can finally shut down the servers. They might have fooled me of $60 now, but they lost many future sales.
---
The nerfing, the lack of content, the grinding, the slow output of fixes, the a-holes blowing up bases just cause(but thats not Bethesda). I still enjoy playing it with my S.O. but without him playing I don't play online, so its strickly all or nothing 
---
I feel bad for ladydevann, she's been frantically going around trying to gather info for hours after the patch and I'm sure she caught plenty of  hate despite not being the one responsible for this update
---
Thank you for putting that in that right order lol
---
Yeah, they nerfed the demolition expert perk card.  I definately understand the nerf on the explosive legendary effect, but not the perk card that gives launchers and grenades bonus damage.
---
That gold .44 skin looks like it will be coming soon after all. I hope the patriot combat armor skin returns, the 1-day limited time item removals are BS.
---
Yes! I didn't think anyone would catch that ,quite an astute observation young man.take this imaginary hat and wear it with pride

Bethesda,

I am a long time Fan Girl and am very disappointed in Fallout 76. I have put in thousands of hours into all the Fallout's and this one really falls flat.
---
I am unable to become emotionally invested in Appalachia. There is absolutely no reason why I should care about this place? Sure, I can Nuke the Queen and end the story, but WHY? There needs to be a WHY. ( I know the story line, but it falls amazingly flat)
---
There are so many half baked wonderful stories in the game with no follow through. The huge monster in the bottom of one of the caves, is great and fascinating, but all we get are a few notes. Why can't we kill it?? Or find out what it is, how it got there? Rose the robot is a great story had someone followed through with it. Why not have the player find her story?  We know she was once a real person, how did she become a Robot? Why did her boyfriend turn her into one/or at least put her personality in one? How did he do it? (I know we find somethings about her, but it could have been a very excellent side quest.)The named cat, with the note to be fed, he should be a home companion option. Making a robot for a home companion would be wonderful or a mutant dog. There is nothing to tie me to this world except my cool house and my stuff. There are so many avenues you could have taken with stories and without NPC's to pull the player into Appalachia.  I am a Dungeon Master and can think of a million stories to throw in there that would be interesting and not need any NPC's. (please don't think I think the writing is bad, I feel it is unfinished)
---
My perks don't work half the time. Changing the perks is ridiculous. Some perks should be permanent. Like Green Thumb, if you learn it, it should be permanent and you shouldn't have to remove it to pick a lock. Same with lock picking, once you learn it, it should should be permanent. Now anything to do with damage, weight, or special attributes like sneak, night eyes etc. I can see you would switch them out, to keep people from being OP. but crafting should be permanent and not count against your specials.
---
My inventory/stash is also a problem. Every time I log in I wonder if my stuff will still be there or if I will be missing 90% of my Caps. Sometimes some of my junk disappears, like all of my wood or steal. Sometimes a cool gun will disappear, but almost every time 90% of my caps disappear. My Loader Power Armor disappeared and I had to rebuild it. I have bought plans that I still can't make the items, for armor, home, aid, drugs and guns. Plans should be sell-able, so we can have/get different plans to build.
---
Also the loot sucks for events and Legendaries. We killed the Queen and In the entire  hour I was there I received 5 of the exact same Armors and nothing but 2 stimpacks and a hide from the Queen herself. That is ridiculous. I spend hours collecting junk, making bullets, fixing armor and weapons, and when the encounter is over, I have 5 Nocturnal Combat Armor Left Arms, and I can't sell them all because there is a cap on caps at every Trader. So what is the point going to kill the Queen or any event?
---
PVP is broken. Pacifist should mean that if you shoot me, you do no damage and cannot be killed at all, unless you are wanted. Not give the jerk level 175 while I am level 12 a chance to kill me and take my junk, despite me never firing back. Or even better, make separate servers for PVP. People are jerks and I have been hunted down and killed about 10 times in 1 game by another player, until I server jumped. No one should feel bullied in a video game, when most people play to escape shit like that.
---
Also who are you listening to on these patches? Because it is not me. You have punished me with this new patch. You have made my well balanced character worth nothing. Dropping weapons damage because other players are jerks, only punishes people like me. Making perks worthless only punishes me, it doesn't make the game more balanced, it just breaks it more, especially when a level 1 mole-rat breaks with one bite your level 50 armor, that you just fixed moments before. You built a game were OP characters are the only choice and now with the new patch this is especially true. 
---
 I see no point to continue to play the game. Do you think I should continue to play? Would you continue to play? I paid $71.99 for a game that makes all my time I have spent useless and worthless. What would you do? I will also say, I will not buy another Bethesda Game until months after it's initial release as to not waste my money again. I am a single mom and bought this for me and my son to play, we saved for it for 2 months and for what? Nothing is the answer.
---
This is what I would do.
---
Make PVP on other servers, that would take away a lot of your problems.
---
Stop fucking with the perks. Start fucking with the people who dupe/cheat the game.
---
Beta the patches, so we as your consumers can tell you where and how it is broken, before we get our hopes up.
---
Maybe even pull the game until it is finished and fixed. I may be speaking for myself, but I would wait to play if I knew it would be the fun wonderful game it could be, and it can be.
---
Stop making Bobby Pins weigh .10, that is beyond ridiculous. I weighed 250 bobby pins and they weighed ounces not 2 pounds. 
---
Stop making the baddies harder, and guns less damaging.  We play Fallout to level up and kick ass, not to grind until we rage quit or write a very long letter on Reddit. 
---
Start giving better loot. From level 3 safes, treasure map loot to Legendaries and even the scorch-beast queen. 
---
Add some cool stories (For instance, if you wander enough you find were SuperMutants were Created, why not find some Super Mutant who has all their memories of their past life.) (I know some of that is from Fallout New Vegas, but still cool.)
---
Add some puzzles instead of fetch missions. 
---
Make the Housing Budgets bigger. (This is personally mine. Loved building and decorating in Fallout 4, and would like to do it a little more to my own home)
---
I am not a coder or a DEV, but I know Fallout is more than this. And please, don't get me wrong I have had great fun and made new friends, but the bad is outweighs the good, and this needs to be remedied or you will forever lose faithful players, like me.
---
M
---
&gt;  You are beyond delusional
---
I'm delusional because I don't think a few downvotes reflect on the 171,247 people here? Really?
---
&gt; your resorting to insult in an otherwise civil discussion show your true colors.
---
But I suspect calling me delusional isn't an insult to you? I'm calling what you said stupid, because it was utterly stupid and in no way/shape/form correct. The fact you think some anonymous downvotes and comments of a few people somehow reflect on ALMOST 200,000 PEOPLE is just lunacy, get some sense. 
---
The only people crying are the people duping TSE and idiots dumb enough to buy TSE off of dupers. Let the babies cry.
---
Thanks for the (Known) tag.  It will be very helpful.  However, last night I purchased a Large Generator plan thinking it was new, which had no Known tag, but it was already known when I tried to read it.
---
Another delusional individual.
---
I believe Bethesda said that they would bring private servers and mod support to the game sometime this year.
---
It’s not an exploit.
---
They need to stop the 100% focus on bug fixes.  Fixing 100 bugs and introducing 20-30 more old and new bugs back isn't helping.
---
My friends are leaving because they're BORED.  We can deal with bugs.  Once you've done the quests and killed the queen 30 times, there's nothing to DO.
---
Content doesn't have to be huge new standalone systems.  They can do small content boosts with EVERY patch.
---
thx..but im on ps4
---
I feel like a piss baby attack coming your way. Good luck, you need it.
---
Ah well. I still want to see it happen, sometime after Bethesda fixes everything they broke with the latest patch.
---
a graveyard of games picked up during steam sales and humble bundles. 
---
I researched every known dupe for a big post I made about misinformation here a few weeks ago, I was actually surprised how easy it was to find info on them. I never knew about the modus dupe before that but it was mind numbingly simple
---
No doubt some of us got our money’s worth. Doesn’t change the fact that this game’s endgame is lacking. Nothing to do but walk around and kill the same mobs over and over. I’m level 140, I’ve done all that there is to be done.
---
I’m moving on, you should too at least until Bethesda fixes their game AND adds new content. This game is such a bug fest, it’s been almost four months now and still no sign of new content. Just “fixes” and modes nobody asked for. Who the fuck plays Fallout for PvP? This franchise, imo, is suffering an identity crisis.
---
It seems that Bethesda has forgotten what made Fallout special in the process of making it a mainstream brand.
---
No Problem. PS has some great games also!

1) PS4

4) The issue occurs when I log back in within Watoga. I haven’t been able to leave, so I don’t know if it is related to the location or not. My character freezes on a blank pipboy and I cannot exit the screen shown in the screenshot. I have been able to leave the screen once when I was killed by passing enemies, but my game crashed shortly after and I was put back in the same situation upon logging in. 
---
Thought the most recent update might fix it, but it still happens. I’d really appreciate a fix because it is actually preventing me from playing the game at all. 
---
5) NA
---
Also, please comment if anyone else has experienced this issue/ has a fix for it and I’ll try that rather than waiting for the issue to get fixed in a patch.
---
&gt;Yes, except for when something else would come out that would grab my attention briefly.
---
sounds like a break to me. semantics, i guess. just trying to understand what you mean when you say you played a game heavily for years.
---

The game is messed up... The only people who enjoy this game are people who haven't played any of the other games on this generation. The quality is super low on just about anything. Nobody would play this game if it didn't have the Fallout brand. Nobody.
---
2 shot lever action is basically a bobby pin now.
---
I mean, if they want to whinge and bitch that's fine. But it's the fact that they cling to the corpse they want to flog. Almost as if they have nothing else to live for. I honestly saw a comment on here comparing BGS to literal dictators. It's beyond stupid.
---
This... Is literally how legendary weapons work now.
---
There are 3 perk slots, and X perk will only go in X slot i.e. Two-Shot in 1 or Explosive in 2.
---
True as it may be, I think it's in an alright place. With the right perks and attachments, _I think_ it can do 90 something damage per shot. Despite the slow fire rate, it beats almost all other heavy weapons in dps.
---
Ammo is already kinda hard. I rarely find it in the wild and it takes 10 components to craft including 10 screws. Also they weight 6 pounds a peice.
---
"We'll look into it" and "I'll let them know" isn't exactly being active. No answers, no explanations, no apologies. Not really doing much. 
---
Yes im fully spected into sneak but i actually never tried to do that. I wasnt succesful to hide from ghouls or mole miners in plain sight. Need to get a chameleon armor piece. That might help.
---
I was thinking about some repsec into taming creatures but im on 3 CHA so thats not viable really. 
---
I'm  just teasing, you seem like the type to do his research.
---
So its okay for everything else to be made useless? Now you are feeling qhat the rest of the pwople who dont want to hack and slash are feeling.
---
Yes, thank you for copy and pasting that you let the dev team know. 
---
The title?
---
Nice. We sure needed another bug...
---
I have to give you massive credit for coming to the community and clearing an error you made. This is beyond brave to do.  I hope more people follow your lead when rumor becomes fact. 
---
Ebayers also drive us closer and closer to loot boxes as they establish with Bethesda that players will pay actual cash for in game content instead of getting it by playing the game.
---
Dude no one cares if you leave the game. Just go, theres no reason to pretend you're important enough for people to care what you are or are not playing.
---
Whaaaah!
---
Damn. I must be lucky then, I only get the big tanky girls 
---
LOL dude i know the feeling. I was checking my bros account and omg his TSE handmade does like 150 dmg or some B.S. I was trying to Xfer some stuff and a scorched beast came and bullied us. The handmade couldnt do anything. It killed us, destroyed my base and flew off.
---
But i do have some extra tire irons and rolling pins if you need one hahah. seriously i cant even sell things on my mules atm. Been saving almost all items for when player vending comes out and now i'm being punished for it. One of the main reasons i loved fallout was because i could be a hoarder and hold on to everything.
---
“Can’t effectively use all weapons” this is the problem. I shouldn’t be able to do any damage with melee if I’m not a melee character, yet melee still does similar damage to that of ballistic weapons with the appropriate perks, but doesn’t require Ammo or reloads. 
---
yes the original plan was for next year...but the state the game is in it's better just to do it now as the community will probly fix the game better then Bethesda can
---
Probably depends on the crowd. I haven't bought anything yet but I have seen a few players that have and looking at the #Fallout76 tag on Twitter I see a few people buying items from the Atom store.
---
When the Bethesda loyalty recedes, you feel no pain.
---
Thank you for the comma, bruh.
---
Buh Bye
---
Glad I never bought it
---
It bug's me as well for some reason when people say it the other way round :)
---
I prefer random plans too. With random plans, I just ignored them and played how I wanted to. I generated money. When I would get lucky and see a plan I wanted, I could afford it. Now I grind on profit-making stuff and set up water farms and stuff I dont enjoy just so I can buy a plan.
---
But thats just me.
---
This is my fav quest so far too. And I liked the rewards. Still wearing the mask :) 
---
And then BAM tambourine man gets nurfed for making too much noise!
---
I've launched my own Nuke SOLO, done all the story missions, killed the queen several times over.  What's after that?  Not much I think.  Is there and end gamde to the end game I'm missing?  Like with all the nuked flora?  Can't figure out what all that is really good for.
---
And yet everyone seems to forget SW:TOR - the best single-player MMO to ever be made.
---
Infinite money, largest IP that ever existed, one of the best development studios in the industry, and they still managed to fuck it up so much that they were F2P in a year.
---
Wish somebody over at bethesda austin could do that same amount of research :/ not like there aren't tens if not hundreds support tickets about those methods already anyway, but still
---
Honestly i dont mind selling items, its the prices that get me. What bothered me about your first comment is the assumption that the only way to keep the servers up and running is to sell items or have a subscription service. It's just not true. I invest with Zenimax, Bethesda is a subsidiary, they make ridiculous profits every year. If you do a little research and see how much profits these companies are actually making you might change your tune. But anyway, good stuff and happy gaming!
---
I don't know the maths, but I'm guessing it only adds damage to the explosive effect, which is what? 20% of the weapon damage? Something like that.  Maybe someone smart can break it down.  
---
Say hi to the rest of the Beth team for us.
---
Trust me I love the fallout world that's why I played the hundred dollars to pre order this pay to play beta.live and learn m8 live an learn
---
I agree with you generally. I’m just saying that FO76 is a unique case wherein it has a *much* shorter cycle, because it had so little content. 
---
Whatever the profits they made they hurt the Fallout brand. This game will negatively impact the next Fallout game and maybe even any future Bethesda game.
---
&gt; I have to carry multiple different types of Pistols cuz they break quickly, and effectiveness vary VS certain enemies. 
---
I was just saying in another thread that I must be an outlying piece of data, because I like this. I like having to have different weapons for different enemy types. Every RPG I've ever played intended you to do that. My gunner mainly sticks with a rifle with a Perforating Magazine and the Tank Killer perk. But she has a laser rifle with a beam splitter, beta wave for fire damage, and an aligned barrel those pesky robots in Watoga. 
---
I don't know, I like the variety. Each gun feels like a new "skill" I need to use to defeat that enemy.
---
Nevermind ignore my social akwardness, thanks for the compliment. :) 
---
Did you ever discover the part of the IP history were interplay was going to use Masthead studios to make fallout online?
---
Cause had they been allowed to do that we would have been ROYALLY FUCKED.
---
Look up EarthRise, i was a backer of that game and it had massive performance issues that was the engine that was going to go into fallout online. 
---
We dodge a bullet like you have no idea.
---
i will get xbox in the summer tho
---
Thanks!  I'll have to give it a look.
---
I think the old ranged weapons not hitting anything consistently bug is back, I've seen posters mentioning the same thing emptying clips point blank and meh for damage.  I had the same thing several times yesterday/today trying to kill lvl 14 supermutants with my newly found 1.25 shot lever rifle w/ 170 dmg, took about 6 shots to kill each one jeez.
---
Sacking bobbles still exist. Just cant stack explosive. Melee still stack lul..
---
Yes, the update broke bulk being usable for crafting and repair.
---
Unbulk everything.
---
They took that  3k+ post to heart  and shut the game down. WE did it brothers and sisters, we've risen up!
---
I actually thought on that specific combination of perks and was part of the reason for why I suggested the change to bloodied (which if I was unclear I mean you only deal more damage for X number of seconds after being dealt damage).  With bloodied changed in that way it means you must be in combat which takes away the ability to stack stealth, bloodied and 2 shot.  Instigating in this case being t3 was where I mentioned in an edit that min maxers would find extra damage but there be fun perks in that tier to take instead.  By splitting it into 3 tiers it also opens up a lot more levers (i.e. a tweak could be to make instigating procs require it to be fired before combat starts making bloodied and instigating not function with one another) where if one combo is overperforming a single perk can have numbers adjusted instead of nerfing player perks or mass % changes like the current TSE nerf.  
---
Quite simply in the case of TSE even after the nuke nerf it STILL is by far the best perk combo in the game for any non melee weapon (and I guarantee melee weapons are next on the chopping block if not power armor).
---
Point still stands they are both weak in general. 
---
I've played hundreds or thousand of hours in every fallout game (including Tactics), pre-ordered fo76 as part of a xbonex bundle, and have yet to play the game. I just know I'm going to be disappointed... 
---
I've enjoyed it so far, about 70% through the main story
---
I got to like level 17 and lost interest. Have been following the game still to see if anything pulls me back in but all it's done has made me more uninterested. Total bummer
---
I still love Bethesda but it looks like this game wasn't a great idea 
---
They messed up with this patch
---
I would propose the opposite, personally. Remove STR scaling on melee weapons, and instead make all melee weapons deal damage as if the wielder had 15 STR.
---
FO76 promotes diversity of playstyle. The gap in DPS between an un-specc'd build using a rifle, and a specialized build using a rifle isn't nearly as big as in previous games. The exception to this is melee, because Melee scales off both perks _and_ your STR (which is high anyway because you need perks). If all weapons scale off a SPECIAL stat, enemies will be balanced around specialized builds and made harder - which will indirectly make it much more difficult to kill enemies with anything but your 'specialized weapon'. But by increasing base damage and removing scaling, this would close the gap between 'Melee builds' and 'Firearm builds' without nerfing melee. Because - outside of heavy guns with high resource costs - melee _should_ have the highest base DPS in the game due to its range limitations.  There's an argument to be made about Bloody/Unyielding and so on, but that's an argument about the gross imbalance of legendary prefixes - not melee itself. At the end of the day, melee should be something that _everyone_ can fall back on when something gets too close for comfort.
---
Bethesda's design decisions suggest that they want people to use weapons appropriate to the situation, instead of seeing us push for our specialization 100% of the time. A melee build should gun down approaching enemies to whittle them down, and break out the slashy-slashy when enemies get close. A rifleman should pop heads from range and weaken enemies as they approach, then perform finishing blows on those weakened enemies with a sword or shotgun. Look at Demo Expert - the nerfs there suggest that they're going this route. For better or worse, Bethesda wants to close the gap between the specialized and the non-specialized. STR scaling still exists because it's a relic of past fallout games, and an 'intuitive' stat. Stronker mussels = hit hardur. You can't shoot harder. That's reality. Except in a multiplayer game, balance should always come before reality.
---
Unpopular opinion, but the demo expert nerf needed to happen. _Now was 100% the wrong time to nerf it_, but it's necessary to properly buff the base damage of explosive weapons. If Demo expert stayed as it was and explosives were later buffed, then explosives would be slightly overpowered in the hands of the specialized and slightly underpowered in the hands of everyone else. This levels the playing field a bit for future buffs, so that everyone can feel satisfied when they huck a grenade.
---
Imagine what we'd have if everybody else at the studio was that passionate about their jobs
---
The game failed 
---
Melee is the most powerful build in the game unless you’ve got a strong sneak sniper build, I’d argue it is overpowered, but in that sense more weapons should be nearing its level of power instead of melee itself being nerfed.
---
Playing melee definitely still has its dangers though if you aren’t careful
---
Buddy, have you played an MMO before?
---
Here
---
Game hasn't been in the launcher since yesterday, this isn't related to the maintenance or the server shutdown today. My copy is just fucking gone. 
---
Stop clicking on his videos if he bugs you lol
---
True, but pvp is another mess. And right now, if u are not melee, it's almost hopeless. If you are, it's a 50-50 thing. Not sure that's the best way to earn caps. And junk is all over the place, but you still need to collect it. Repeatedly. Often.
---
I've never seen a worse group of self-righteous entitiled children as this sub lately
---
hmmm interesting...fucked up hitbox?
---
Feel free to use them. I might do a follow up post but that i want to be a much larger one. Its funny it seems so easy to get nice pictures but you really gotta look for those locations. The Monorail Elevator for example. My first photo was from the bottom of the elevator just looking upwards. I really didnt like it so i went to the hill near it, got some distance and included a nice view over the edge with the elevator. The only thing bothering me is that i couldnt really point out the height of the elevator. One of my favorite places overall. 
---
I was but I wanted to call what you said stupid a few more times first. 
---
RIP
---
Yeah, I can't think of things for my friends to do.
---
This Friday I'm going to lunch with my friend who "used to" play.  Normally I'd try to draw him back in with "look what they did in the patch, this is so exciting".
---
I can't even bring myself to do that this Friday.  Maybe we'll talk about politics instead........it'll be less painful.....lol
---
definitely..im actually getting it to play FONV..because i heard that it is unplayable ps3..but im excited to also play the xbox exclusives also
---
I know that emoji is supposed to be a facepalm but it looks like someone who has a bad headache rather than someone who is facepalming.
---
I'm totally cool with that.
---
I don't PvP and my outlook on life is if you want something someone else has go buy it yourself and if you can't afford it......well tough luck. I don't feel like playing a dick measuring PvP where the guy with the most money wins, so I don't PvP at all.
---
I still don't see how you could favor the TSE nerf. TSE had literally no effect on PvE and if anyone was butt hurt about losing a PvP match to a TSE.....there were plenty online to buy for yourself.
---
Cool, did they drop the refund's in brown bags at the door or...?
---
I'm not sure what masculinity has to do with it, but yeah..
---
Problem is that people bitch and moan about tse and now bethesda was forced to change it for the worst. If people keep bitching and moaning about things they will get nerfed. So my guess is that melee builds are going to be nerfed next as people keep one shotting people and crying. So keep complaining and make the game better (sarcasim).
---
As our shit head president would say make fallout great again!
---
I guess I got my money's worth.  But "finishing" the game isn't even exciting anymore.  
---
Players have been great.  But the narrative is so.... so repetitive.  I found myself skipping through terminal entries, just waiting for whatever I needed to flag.  Those tapes became a pain in the ass to listen to because they were all the same.  And the crazy robots are not funny anymore.
---
There's just no story.  Chase the overseer.  That was the plot in 3, but then it went somewhere.  NV, it went somewhere.  4 it went in multiple directions depending on who you sided with.  But this is going nowhere.  Goal: Follow overseer, see nukes, say wuzzat, and push the button.  
---
 Community influencers responding isn’t Bethesda responding.
---
My two teammates and I jumped down first and she was here with some Kings. She was level 50+.  And when we killed her we were looting the corpses.  I was happy cause I got a marine helmet and wetsuit in her corpse. 
---
Then the level 38 walked into the area and everything spawned again while we were still looting. Only this time she was only in her 20s.  I didn’t get anything good for that kill. 
---
=(
---
Got disconnected(PS4), but don't know if those are down.
---
All smart assery aside, tell me how to get 20k on my bloodied deathclaw gauntlet for 1-2 hours. 
---
That is cool! I will have to give my crit crippling  shotgun build and................ I just remembered I sold my quad combat shotgun 😭
---
The ones that bug me:
---
\- Favorites don't save if you have 2 of the same type of gun on the dial now. You have to reset this every time you login.
---
\- Also, sometimes my pa is equipped and working (I can tell by stats) but it'll show a piece missing in the hud when entered. You have to click on the piece to fix and then it's back to gone when fast traveling.
---
\- Fallout.exe crashes when I quit to desktop again. Not a big deal, but it was fixed in the previous patch.
---
On PC
---
Yup, this is true :(
---
Realistically speaking, it makes sense. We were all extremely hyped seeing the patch notes, he probably started the video as soon as the patch notes dropped and uploaded it right after if not before the maintenance was finished. It took us some time to figure out how much more the update broke, which merits another video. 
---
Already stopped ages ago but they keep popping up in my feed and he bold letters the title on his thumbnails, so, well.
---
I liked the Fire Breathers too but wish it were longer!
---
Now there's an understatement! Hopefully they can roll out some hotfixes fast!
---
well I would immediately contact support, find proof of purchase or whatever you can and tackle it immediately. You uhhh might also want to check the email associated  with your account .
---
Yeah. I started a new alt that I wanted to try an actual pipe rifle build with. I managed to find a level 50 2S pipe that someone vendored to the Flatwoods vendor. Got it for like, 75 caps. Put it in the stash to look forward to having it at level 50. 
---
Patch comes out, nerfs 2S and licensed plumber. 
---
*Sigh*
---
Welcome to to the YouTube Algorithm. If it ain't popular, it ain't getting recommended.
---
Lets do this, im ready
---
I've got three of them if you want 'em. They're paper weights to me.
---
yeah so broken and impossible to play, lemme tell ya...
---
Mutations would help, marsupial to jump to new areas, and the speed demon one to get around faster.  
---
Can you elaborate on this? (always in caution is a perk btw, Escape Artist)
---
Wow great idea!
---
When did I tell people to be *'less pissed about their shitty food'*?
---
You're still defending being a dick to the waiter btw. Yes, if I thought they genuinely did well in the situation and tried for me then I would thank them for their effort. Despite somebody else fucking up.
---
What happened to these TSE weapons that everyone is offended by?
---
My final straw was the loss of our mule character my husband and I used. We both are collectors and wanted to keep all the unique quest rewards.  I paid for a 3rd account  to specifically hold all that stuff and now you are telling me I have to trash everything I've collected?  It is sad. I will watch for future updates that hopefully fix what is broken but we dont plan on logging back in. 
---
And I agree with you. I used to love walking up to a low level character and dropping stuff for them to use or helping with quests. Most of the people I came across were wonderful. 
---
He's one of only two or three channels I have blocked on YouTube.  I highly recommend it.
---
I’m not impressed by a community manager responding and “passing on” information. The people developing the fucking game need to see this shit first hand.
---
yup i have also been getting in power armor without its frame looking all silly,,,,
---
Thank you for looking into this.
---
I believe they said explosive secondary effects would be 20% of the base weapon damage.  100 base damage +20 explosive would come out to 120.  Demo perk now increases explosive by 60%.  Or 20x.60=12 for Demo.  100 base +20 explosive +12 for Demo... 132 from 100 for an exploding bullet weapon.  5 perk points for 12 points of damage is pitiful.  
---
Helll, Warhammer Online was Gamebryo, so it wasn't new territory for the engine.
---
I see, wanted the last word. Like a child. By all means continue white knighting. 
---
Regurgitating opinions just to say, "look at me".
---
Fuck rule 6
---
That was added weeks ago.  You can choose to redistribute a SPECIAL point instead of choosing a new card after level 50.
---
"a friend of mine"
---
The only reason I'd be interested in talking to Bethesda's support is for a refund. Since I know I'm not going to get it, my solution is play games that are fun and pretend I never wasted my time on this. 
---
Umm I was just on
---
QA is probably as frustrated as you are. They catch all the blame, they feel all the responsibility, but they have ZERO clout or power in most companies. If QA tells management its going to take 4 weeks to do it right, management will give them 1 week. Its rough. And appdev are faced with the same problem.
---
Blame upper and middle management first.
---
/no I'm not in QA :)
---
It's honestly beyond pathetic. No one cares if yall are done playing a game, stop acting like you're important enough for people to care. 
---
All you're doing is clogging up the sub with your whining and making people have to scroll for forever to get to real content.
---
Besides if you really think you need to tell people you are done playing there are plenty of other post a out there doing the same thing. Just add a comment instead of creating a duplicate post.
---
This is meant with no ill will, just saying it as I see it:
---
Why would anyone post on the game forum that that are leaving said game for anything more than attention..kinda like the old, if you leave me I will kill myself routine, if I was going to leave a game I don't announce it, from my view its attention seeking and nothing more
---
Step 4: Have a nuke land on top of your "protest".
---
damn...good one!
---
i mean... thats literally their job. if they were this active on days not immediately following the shitstorm of patches then it would be something to note
---
Im having the same issue but on pc, the only thing im able to do is fast travel and sometimes it takes care of the problem but other times i crash to desktop. 
---
GT: Carmown
---
It was a week of grinding (if you were lucky) to server hop until a plan you wanted showed up, though.  You would rather stare at a loading screen for a week then play the game and make shopping runs?
---
The argument isn’t that it is perfect, the argument is that it is better than the old RNG “stare at a loading screen for 80% of my play time”
---
At first but then after spending weeks of grinding caps and never find the plan i needed no. 
---
When your on AERODROME as an attacker, pick the AA tank, stay a healthy distance away and pepper the enemy. It's the only map where an AA gun dominates. 
---
alrighty
---
1) don’t use guns
---
2) don’t use armor
---
3) have not been “nerfed” by this update 
---
4) me and the rest of the community are still pissed
---
Move along.
---
You’re just jealous because you don’t have friends. 
---
Ah sorry! I just suggested that because it’s worked for me every time. Shame that it doesn’t work for everyone :(
---
No, after 5 hours of Post-Patch play, I can assure you they have not Nerfed Legendary Loot Drops, that was done in the previous patch, so 20% of legendary enemies have been dropping no legendary items for a while.
---
What they have done is severely Nerf the amount of Legendary's that spawn in the first place, I've only found 2 post-patch, but I haven't been to White Springs since my TSE Handmade now takes 7-8 shots to kill a level 40 robot and breaks after about 100 shots, WS doesn't seem like a safe place to be for a Stealth/Rifleman at only level 110.
---
While Survival Mode is something new, I don't think it's something anyone wanted or asked for... Adventure Mode PvP didn't seem to do anything substantial to begin with.  :shrug:
---
If it is truly like no man's sky, then walk away from the game. Check back a year later.
---
Why spend your valuable time testing an early access game to get it to a "finished" state. Let the people that are paid do that, and come back when you hear positive things.
---
100% agree.
---
They should be doing a stream right now apologising and explaining what went wrong. Accountability, not buff Todds stealth boy and start posting new cos play shit on there twitter or releasing new Atom store fluff.
---
Magazines containing holotape games are consumed on pickup.
---
Hahaha you have a better chance converting him to Islam then getting him to play this game....which I cant even log onto a damn server.
---
You must not watch CNN.
---
That's a good thing.
---
Well I wasn’t aware of this. I knew getting a % damage towards something meant you wouldn’t get another percent damage but I figured past that it was fair game towards getting any other effect.
---
I just figured it would be more interesting to have more specialized guns such as an explosive, extra damage towards ghouls, and a bash damage gun as opposed to a two shot, explosive, bloodied that just tears into everything in game. 
---
I’ve been over encumbered for a whole month 
---
Wow ok thanks I cant afford any of that, thank god fitgirl repacks exists
---
There some good Xbox exclusives. They just wasn’t as popular or reviewed as Sony’s Exclusives.
---
I would recommend Quantum Break Recore Ashen Dead Rising 3 and 4 Ryse son of Rome had good story and plot twists just QTE action. There are other games I’m forgetting.
---
Wouldn’t it suck if this update broke the game even more.
---
The beta did its job lol. Aged just fine.
---
INT is 15. It’s a TSE levee action which I know breaks quicker than others, but lowering the damage (which I’m fine with) by so much makes it break even faster. It’s ridiculously tedious going to repair it every 30-45 min. I couldn’t imagine how fast it is without gunsmith, it’s a must have card and I thought they were discouraging “must haves”. 
---
I quit when I decided that I couldn’t handle the constant inventory management because of the severe lack of stash space and I refuse to play the game until they add more, it’s fucking ridiculous.
---
I never said it was in a bad place... It's the only heavy gun I'll use lol
---
I believe it's 92 per shot yes, though that can he increased with prime receiver (at loss of fire rate).
---
I never subbed to him but he always has like 3-4 videos at the top of my recommendations.
---
it just works!

Sorry! I don’t know why my phone auto corrected “mule.” Sure, is there anyone who isn’t excited to receive a new plan from an event? Wasn’t buying serums recipes from MODUS the only way to get them in the first place? Instead of RNG it’s just very expensive.  Prior to this I server hopped 39 times looking for serum recipes and never found a single one. I ran out of gaming time for the day, hah!
---
I feel like it would have said "vs players" as the assassin's prefix is already pvp legendary gear
---
Is your friend Jangles the Moon Monkey by chance?
---
Who didn't see this coming? I thought it has been clear that this community will never be satisfied. This community is literally entitled to have everything they want, when they want it, how they want it. Zero compromises. What happened to society that people feel that the world revolves solely around them?
---
We don't matter.  We're only players.  The only customers game publishers care about anymore are the so-called "whales" and their investors.  The rest of us are just cows to be milked.  
---
I thought the pricing of Creation Club content was a bit overblown, but worth it, if bought in bundles and/or on sale.  The Atom Shop's pricing is appalling.  
---
What level are you, by chance? How many hours in?
---
Honestly im just trying to enjoy the game before they ruin it with balance, EVERY online game gets ruined because at some point they need to make more money out of it and they need the players to keep coming back
---
Criticizing is one thing. Whining like a bunch of two year olds over a game is another. Not too mention it's almost every post and it's pretty much the same few things over and over again. 
---
First of all.  76 I play casually enough I'm not sick of it.  Good thing.
---
Secondly, at Forsaken I decided to stop sinking money into Bungie too.  I don't want to pay 120 dollars or better a yesr for a game I'm not get 120 dollars out of.  Unfortunately my ship has sailed. 
---
Sea of thieves is also fun
---
Ran out of meaningful things to do. Camp sizes are too small and I can't put things in it that I found outside.
---
Atom store is expensive AF and I can't even put the cool things I bought in my friends camp. What's the point if I can't share my stuff? 
---
I honestly would put up with the bugs and blue screening if I could just build a larger camp and make a store that I could make a profit at. 
---
Big time.
---
No the durability of base items didnt change. 
---
Some of the OP perks were nerfed though so that could be your issue. 
---
How many hours did you get though, you act like there's nothing, but I'm 40 hours in at level 32. 
---
If you played legit, then you probably got what 200-300 hours? Is that not enough?
---
Hell, if they had done everything else the same and just SAID "by the way, this is still in development, expect bugs and balance changes" I think they'd have avoided half of the shitstorm 76 has riled up.
---
I've noticed the same lately,  vendor has a 0 cap limit showing, but if I try to sell something worth a few caps it forces it to refresh and show up.
---
Can i have your stuff
---
It's not their subreddit, but okay
---
I am in software development, so I understand that this can be the case. If QA has identified issues and gone unheard then that is definitely square on the shoulders of management. However, I see a lot of bug reports coming from players that seem to be previously unidentified, and some (lever action reload animation which was fixed recently comes to mind) have been around since fallout 4 so if that wasn't tested and reported knowing that it has been a past issue then QA is dropping the ball.
---
That said, you are right. Management should be the ones falling under the most/first scrutiny.
---
But you shouldn't have to attach the wii steering wheel in the first place.
---
I usually go for Site Alpha.
---
Mmm hmmm yeah ok. 
---
What a stupid comparison. 
---
Bungie added paid content 3 months after launch. It cost 40+ dollars Canadian, and only included half of the content you paid for. Brilliant. If BGS tried this people like you would have crucified them"
---
Now with multiple "expansions"? You can't even get all the DLC for the same cost as a full release game brand new. 
---
Where was this said?
---
That's what I was thinking! I just think that the release of this particular sword is the ringing of the bell that it's happening soon. 
---
That was good. And probably yes, which is why it wasn't there when he checked.
---
Ha! I’ve literally crafted over 120+ torsos in the last 4-5 days as this was the only (torso) mod left to get (I have buttressed limbs), and..... NOTHING. Just gave up on it, spent thousands of caps buying mats so I can craft faster, waste of time! It’ll only happen now when I scrap any Marine parts I find in the game.
---
Mine went from waiting to under investigation yesterday. 4 days since submit.
---
I didn't say no one was leaving
---
Same on PC
---
I wish. That bastard won't even talk to me.
---
Our "shithead president"... I'm sure you would do so much better. 
---
Ok so you have the keycard, you need the passcode from enclavedb.net or similar.
---
Every silo is the same, you don’t need hacking three or lock pick three but they help.
---
You can face tank it as melee, bring adhesive and aluminium for repairs.
---
For the nuke zone just nuke fissure prime but be prepared with hazmat suit/ power armour and radx and glowing blood bags and rad shield if you have done the questline
---
When the game is still a buggy mess plagued by hackers and a ruined economy but there are 2 less bugs than before uwu
---
Yeah I noticed the same. It literally didn't change anything about it but the name. Means they're trying to sell it in the atom store now?
---
&gt; white knighting
---
I don't think you actually know what this word means, because me pointing out your ridiculous thinking isn't that. Oddly enough thinking a tiny fraction of a group somehow reflects on the entire group is childlike too. Imagine thinking a subsection of a group being violent somehow made the ENTIRE group seem violent? Yikes. 
---
What huge monster at the bottom of which cave? 
---
You implied it.
---
I havn't played since the latest patch, heck I don't think I even played since the patch before that! I'm just "waiting" for a super update that fixes everything
---
Put in several hundred hours and never had a bad experience with other players in FO76.
---
Played many MMOs over the years and couldn't go a session without running into at least one asshole.
---
People can force hours into bad things, I played for Honor for 1200 hours, 76 for about 3-400 hours, and the division for 700ish, doesn't mean all those games are not trash but just that some people really try to give a game a chance hoping they will fix it all "next patch."  
---
And yet they never do.....
---
Who and what tf is a "Juicehead" ? Lol
---
Until yesterday i had a phantom speed demon mutation. Had 6 mutations including bird bones and marsupial for this exact reason. So i went on to try to cure the phantom and obviously it was the last mutation cured. I got reaaally lucky with the mutations i got back thankfully. Have both bird bones and marsupial back plus healing factor and some other neat mutations. Im not risking getting empath or herbivore now. So ima buy it on the market. Got an offer for 600 caps. Its a lot but i want it riskfree. Im really unlucky sometimes.
---
**Nerfs and Buffs**
---
1. **Take a page from League of Legends. Do small balance nerfs and buffs.** They do nerfs and buffs in all the time. But they're small, gradual, over time. Just as important...........they do a balance to ALL the builds when they do nerfs and buffs (so TSE gets a bit weaker, Energy Weapons get a bit stronger, Melee is a bit less OP, Heavy Weapons get a durability buff, etc.....all in the same patch). In League of Legends there isn't a massive nerf to one character that's so harsh I say "FML not going to play Teemo any more, he's trash now" or a buff so good that I say "Holy cow I'm changing to an Ashe Main".
---
2. **If people are NOT complaining about something in the game, don't nerf it.** Looking at you there White Knight card. I haven't seen ANY posts that say White Knight needed a massive nerf. Why? Because people enjoy that perk, and it doesn't hurt any play style. Same thing for the XP nerfs. Some people want to bring up new characters and find the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time too grindy now. Pretty much lay off any nerfs people aren't actively asking for. Adding to the grind of the game doesn't make the customers happier, all they notice is their beloved White Knight card or XP gains suck a little more now.
---
Repeatedly and often, and for more than crafting guns and armor. C.A.M.P.s need junk too and then you get vendor trash.
---
If having junk on hand is a problem, why are people complaining about stash size and weight limits?
---
PVP is more than a run up and attack someone thing. this isnt WoW. Pick your targets, capturing a workshop flags you for pvp full stop. hunt them acrosed the map. if you dont mind them getting the "first" hit attack someone out of the blue and see if they will respond in kind. just be sure the level is high so you are getting caps that are worth it and dont get a large bounty and blow all your caps.
---
I am not a pvper so I cant really suggest much in the way of tactics. so my cap grind is stuck at 1400 a day and what I get from any quests/events i decide to do.
---
Not sure, they are pretty close. 
---
Even pre-jan29 patch the power fist looked almost better than my All Rise. But, as usual, lack of any mods, no legendary slots, and having to take weeks for a crafting plan to appear with no loot drops, makes any ideas, but grinding more, useless.
---
Yep exactly!
---
It's almost like nerfing multiple variables of the same problem is completely moronic.
---
Huh.
---
Yeah I do, It's actually called "Dirty water" if you drink enough, you're bound to get Radworms
---
Semi-automatic and sniper-like guns are stupidly underpowered. Nerfing TSEs has just made this more apparent. Honestly, all the guns in-game could do with a buff, or the mobs could use a nerf, one or the other.
---
Welcome to reddit
---
Let's help each other out. I have it for chest piece I believe 
---
Its mutations and bobble heads that are op not melee or tse weapons
---
I've only been a part of the /r community for a short while, seems like a lot of nice people here, but the constant whingey butthurt from TSE owners who all "legitimately found one", has been overwhelming since yesterday.
---
It's tiring already. It wouldn't be so bad if they actually left the game, like every other angsty, angry post states. 
---
But you know they won't.
---
Ymthats right. Kind of the who point I said Bethesda.
---
Yes, bc they had hope that Bethesda would actually fix their broken trash heap. Alas, hope is lost. 
---
Yeah that was why a lot of people were turned off by it
---
That game ended up getting cancelled didn't it?
---
I neither said not implied it
---
I managed to get into the presidential suite on xbox and can't wait for that to open. I know what's in there is old news though I'm just really excited for some new content!
---
Yeah no key cards dont expired
---
No need for hacker nor lock pick lvl3
---
And all you really need is the code
---
Where's the problem?  
---
Fallout *is* becoming better and at release it *did* look like the best patch ever.  And yes, there *is* massive backlash. Do you blame the news for having a good story one day and a bad the next?
---
The cards do not expire, only expire the codes that are no longer needed, there is a page that gives the weekly codes The 3 silos are the same. At this moment, the queen seems invincible. dont launch in prime 
---
I could help as soon as I get home in like 20 minutes 
---
I'm happy it kept me recommending CallMeKevin though.
---
Bobby pins are 0.1 units of weight in inventory on my end like FlikTripz. However, my in-inventory bobby pin weight didn't change until I put all the bobby pins into stash and took them all out. Just picked up and then subsequently dropped 20 pounds of bobby pins.
---
I haven't played it in about 3 weeks, there is no endgame content and the story caps out in maybe 8-10 hours
---
So am I....
---
I haven’t had the physical side effects no but I’ve had a kind of wild life. Never good enough pay never livable always stressed always scared always sad. Get me off before it gets worse.
---
the fact that we cant tell one power armor from another in our inventories proves no one at bethesda really played the game, it must be the dumbest thing ever, looks like i'm putting in a FN magic show just to find my x-01
---
Bethesda slapped their fan-base in the face.
---
u/gregkot I was going to try to explain this to them but seems you did a heck of a better job than I could ever do.
---
People reward what they want to see more of.   Nothing wrong with that.  Just keep up the integrity.
---
&gt;Just shut the game down and fix it guys.
---
Yes please. Do a full re-release if you have to.
---
u/LadyDevann
---
lmao, so they shouldn't post anything because people ar eupset about the patch? grow up people, christ.
---
It's most likely a bug due to them digging in the files trying to fix more bugs but instead is actually just basically rereleasing the bugs
---
Just reminds me of this when you mentioned old frank haha
---
https://youtu.be/0rdtIT_iah4
---
Atomic store updates need to stop completely or be made free of charge till this shit show is fixed imo.
---
I know its another team that makes them (apparently) but Bethesda should continue to profit from such a broken and buggy product.
---
just the armor pieces or the mods as well?
---
&gt;I just figured it would be more interesting to have...
---
"Interesting" combinations exist, they're just not as good.
---
You can't have a "two shot, explosive, bloodied" as two shot and bloodied are both 1* affixes.
---
There's a chart on the wiki, just give FO76 legendary affix a Google.
---
No. Maybe a poor choice of words, but not something to nitpick. It's a subreddit about their game. Nice strawman argument. 
---
You see to be the only one who thinks what I said is ridiculous, so what does that tell you? 
---
Yup, Loved the demo, the community seems solid, and the devs have impressed me so far with their willingness to listen to the community and their consistent and open dialogue.
---
Any chance that we can get any info on the QA process for these patches? Something explaining why so many of these issues are making it into patches and not being caught and addressed before they cause issues for players?
---
Because I think we all know bugs happen and there's always going to be things slipping through the cracks or that were never caught due to it only occurring in a very rare, specific situation, but hot damn does it seem like most of the patches get compiled and pushed out without even cursory QA. At least they're not bricking machines or anything, but the amount of bugs that make it through is pretty astounding for a AAA developer with a major IP.
---
I kindly found a user who crafted it for me around 2hours ago lol! Didn’t really want to trust someone as it was a 3star Unyeilding Sentinel, but the guy was great. I’m in the UK so I’m off for the night, but I’ll be back on in around 9 hours, if you want to add me I’ll craft it for you, no problem. (PS4 by the way) PSN: dj-mike-h
---
I blame the way Juicehead does it.
---
I launched a nuke solo. I’m pretty sure the silos are all the same, but I may be mistaken (I went after Charlie). Hacker 3 is not necessary, but it does save a lot of time. Make sure you have lots of ammo, strong weapons, repaired power armor, and lots of storage space. You basically need to disregard as many enemies as you can and focus on the objectives. Also melee weapons like the All Rise saved my ass over and over. 
---
I'm not completely sure. I played during the beta and lost track of it after the beta ended. 
---
This could be an amazing game if it were managed correctly, but each decision Bethesda has made is worse than the last, and I’m fed up. 
---
Since it doesn't get mentioned as much as other issues, there is now the tedium of having to scrap bulked junk to craft and repair gear.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alfr6d/psa_known_plans_patch_is_bugged_if_you_use/
---
We don't seem to be having the same conversation.  I didn't say the game is perfect or there are not legit issues  people should not complain about.  There are plenty of "maintenance"-type activities that I agree are not fun.
---
My point is simple: **tse was way too strong, now it's still very good.**
---
There are a ton of posts claiming tse was "over-nerfed" and it's now crap, this is simply not true.  People don't seem to have actually tried playing the game with tse post-nerf, the complaints are just a knee-jerk reaction to gamers hearing that their favorite weapon was nerfed.  I have a tse, I tried it last night and I still kill everything just fine.
---
Also, the challenge is just not there.  Apart from my own explosions and the very rare pvp encounter, nothing in this game feels like a legit threat to me.  That's playing as rifle build or melee build, both of which I've tried.  The SBQ even is only a threat in that she isn't getting killed in time, she can land right on me but I'm never worried about getting killed.
---
A well balanced game should include some chance I will die.  This game is too easy.
---
Problem is your assuming it wasn’t caught. It could have been reported by QA and then one of the producers decided that they needed to push the patch anyways. 
---
Remember QAs job is to report it after that it’s down to development to prioritize it on someone’s work load so it’s fixed. These guys aren’t making the best design decisions what makes you think their going to make good choices on if a bug gets fixed or a patch gets released?
---
I can confirm this as well- just got it there 
---
Sort those things before launch. Like during a beta.
---
Nope. Full access to my account and the launcher, nothing from bethesda. Just a big fat "buy now" button. 
---
Haha you suck
---
Maybe it's like the cannibal perk?
---
I did but the first post had about maybe 80-90 upvotes. It was getting enough attention that Bethesda themselves addressed it and other people were following it. The post was misleading and while I can edit the body as a whole the title would’ve been misleading no matter what. This way I can remove that and try to apologize to the people that took my word as fact. 
---
Man SoT was a shit show, I plan on coming back to 76 when DLC drops which is more than can be said about SoT.
---
Umm. No. 
---
Yep, agree completely.
---
If they'd focus all that drive on the 20 worst bugs (crashes, can't log in, etc) they'd get a lot better results than trying to slam 100+ fixes in the game (with 20-30 new bugs created).
---
Meanwhile, you can't play.........and my friend won't play.  And this sucks :(
---
That's more than what I got, I didn't even get the loot window on the 3 star, but it was probably a lvl 15 wooden arm with +10 to radroaches anyways.....
---
Me too, I really didn't expect to feel like this just a few days ago when I was anticipating the update with joy.
---
Seriously, roll this thing back. Take a few weeks or whatever to actually apply the patch to the once  current game version, and fix the issues with all these nerfs. Try a real fix. Roll back the explosives nerf, reduce the nerf on 2SE, and buff the absolute hell out of energy weapons.
---
I mean, real info is what we all want. But most people in the sub seem intelligent enough that they should know for a fact that she's not allowed to divulge information she isn't explicitly told to talk about. It's frustrating for me too, but completely out of community managers hands. 
---
They might appear to be gone if you bulk packed them. Items will not auto scrap if in bulk now.
---
Oh nice, does it stay without the perk? Did some tests yesterday with a instigating/tse dragon and ts/tse handmade, no crits enabled.
---
If it sticks to heads without the perk, that would be sweet. Might be able to get a vats headshot in the air then. I never use it cause the perk takes away from damage in my setup. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg)
---
&gt;For an example, go back to a   
---
&gt;true RNG: rolling dice.
---
I firmly believe you have a way better chance of getting a desirable outcome in a dice roll than you do of finding a  T60 jet pack plans pre-patch.
---
My condolences.
---
Well clearly your way to experience the game is the only correct way. Heil Hitler.
---
God forbid players want to interact and trade with each other in an MMO.
---
I server hopped a few times. No difference. Then I had a blue screen crash (I'm on PS4) about 20 mins ago and after that he had his 200 caps. So not sure exactly what the problem was but the game crashing seemed to solve it at least 
---
Logging in and out works. 
---
And yet we still get hundreds of hours in each.  
---
Gauntlet has 1 mod, extra claw
---
Fist has two mods, heating coils and puncturing 
---
In my example I compared extra claw gauntlet to puncturing fist. Both wepons i currently own. 
---
There won’t be a hot fix, probably be 3 weeks out before we see the next patch.
---
I just realized there are no human enemies.... what the fuck 
---
And so it begins...
---
Yeah its almost as bad as the entitlement that Bethesda show their customers isnt it!
---
Entitled to 6 - 12 months to get the product up to the standard that is the norm for a AAA full price game...jog on
---
I agree and disagree.
---
You shouldn't need a combination of the two most powerful legendary properties to make ranged weapons competitive with a melee weapon whose only legendary property is that its weight is reduced.
---
TSEs are overpowered compared to all other ranged options, and the fact they could end a fight before the target even realizes they're in a fight is overpowered/unbalanced. TSE's needed a nerf, but this went too far.
---
But as things are now, melee is really the only viable endgame build, which is ridiculous, especially when your big boss is a flying creature that you only get to smack with melee weapons for part of the fight.
---
Were it up to me to re-scale the damage of the weapons...
---
Assume TSE on a decent endgame weapon would do 100 damage (not an actual value, but just a reference point for comparison)
---
All Rise would do 85-90 damage
---
Non-legendary but fully modified, max level weapons would do 75-80.
---
You shouldn't have to have a weapon with the two most powerful legendary effects to be viable in the end game, nor should melee be the only viable build, but both should be somewhat better than a non-legendary ranged build (but not so much that such a character is worthless in endgame content).
---
My $0.02
---
It's all coming from upper management. That November release date was clearly way to soon but they needed to get those Christmas pre-orders. Now they are trying to push updates as quick as possible just to look like they are doing something, then they can spend the rest of the time working on Atom shop items. Realistically I doubt Bethesda have a big team working on the game right now anyway since there really is not much saving the game.
---
Nerf to event xp, nuked area xp, white springs ghoul xp. Are they sure they want us to level anymore?
---
bobble heads need to be nerfed because they are stupidly OP in a online fallout, thats using only 1 of them for damage. 
---
thank you 
---
Think it's just Bethesda "trying" to please too many different groups at once. As you said, a more stable base game is more desirable to me than small QOL fixes right now. QOL is important, absolutely. But maybe a more narrow approach would be more productive. Just a small area of fixes at a time. That way, if they break something the game would be tolerable with one area affected. Instead what we are seeing now, crazy issues in different areas. Perks, weapons, caps, carry weights, armor, repairing and scrapping. The list goes on. Nerfs shouldn't happen until there is fair stability, and again, one thing at a time. 
---
If they had simply listed patch notes a bit earlier, maybe that would've made them a bit more hesitant. Then they could've seen the incoming shitstorm before it hit. I understand many people want this game "fixed". It's not that easy, and a lot of people have different ideas of what "fixed" means. But we need a solid base before perks should be touched, let alone everything else they've fondled. 
---
Totally. The lack of NPC’s with meaningful stories has totally destroyed the fallout myth is for me. You normally come out of the vault and begin to find other survivors, clawing and scraping to stay alive. You help them, you become part of the world; you feel invested. 
---
Fallout 76, you chase ghosts that have left a trail of holotapes around an empty map while talking to robots. It has been a huge let down. 
---
No worries. I gotcha, fam.
---
Also, thanks for making the post. I'm glad somebody acknowledged those guys. I'm so glad I don't do their job lol
---
Ah ok that’s weird hopefully a bug and not a design choice 
---
I’m still going
---
This subreddit is full of entitled whiners who want their unbalanced OP toys back instead of learning to get good. 
---
If you quit, literally no one cares. Just play a different game if you want to, lmao. 
---
Quite true.
---
Yes concentrate on bugs not nerfs.
---
What? I'm just saying, in other Fallout games non-legendary weapons were great, but in this game they kinda suck ass.
---
I've dropped hrs hugely after this patch. Not because of the nerf but because vendors have all plans and that makes trading dead...which sucks 
---
&gt; There are a ton of posts claiming tse was "over-nerfed" and it's now crap, this is simply not true. People don't seem to have actually tried playing the game with tse post-nerf, the complaints are just a knee-jerk reaction to gamers hearing that their favorite weapon was nerfed. I have a tse, I tried it last night and I still kill everything just fine.
---
i wrote in my post that shit now takes 3 times more ammo to kill ,what about it isn't overnerfed? its not a knee jerk most guns are TRASH and making everything trash doesn't make it suddenly good 
---
Yup, I share concerns about EA ruining anthem, but so far haven't seen too much of their poison. And cosmetic microtransactions that can also be obtained through ingame currency have never bothered me. If someone wants to shell out $50 for a skin they COULD grind for, more power to them. 
---
In response to comparisons between the prelease of anthem vs. fo76, I think the big difference to me is the open fialogue I mentioned earlier between devs and community. The howard did a lot of talking and promising before fo76, but didn't really engage with the community. I see something different from the anthem team, and I have hope it will pay off for them.
---
Title edit: ***$60 dollars of entitlement***
---
Hey, instead of rehasing FO:NV again, there's this great new MMO based on the Fallout world.
---
It's called Fallout 76. You should try it, I hear it's pretty rad!
---
I love the game.  I still want to play the game.
---
It's my friends that are quitting.  Each day I see more and more "offline" in my friends list.  They're bored.  There's nothing to DO.
---
Pretty soon I'll have to follow them to another game.  I don't want to go :(
---
I think I'm with you. Gonna go pick up KH 1.5/2.5 this Friday and play through that before getting KH 3.
---
Check this sub periodically for content updates
---
Ooh! While we're talking about repairs, could you have the folks take a look at Grognak's Axe? With the Weapon Artisan perk, it never goes to 200% durability, only 100%.
---
I feel like you need some salve for your vaginas. If you got over 30 hrs out of the game that’s less than $2.00 an hour. If you can think of a better way to entertain yourself for that price let me know.
---
Fucking Commies.
---
I was playing a bit ago and tumbleweed blew past. Interesting element they added. 🤣😂
---
can i have your stuff?
---
This comment says more then people might think.
---
Same. Unsubbing/deleting as of today.
---
I have a bloodied power fist. Just 1* sadly.
---
Servers are still online and they are adding new stuff to the game
---
[https://fonline2.com/en/](https://fonline2.com/en/)
---
Gawdamn son!  Isn't breaking the game enough &amp; now you want them to break something else!?!?  
---
They're only human, let them get a little restn
---
Hey man good on you for owing up to it.  If the sub can’t accept your apology then what’s the point in anybody trying to give one?  We have to encourage the right action as much as we condemn the wrong one.
---
Plus you’re still doing Bethesda and the community a favor by calling out misinformation, giving us a better chance of figuring out and dealing with problems rather that bitching about imaginary ones.
---
Lolol the dedicated try to silence the truth,  its okay I was like that once too. Eventually you'll wake up.
---
Bright side ....not much left they can break?
---
It no longer respawns for server hopping either. I have no idea what the respawn rate is 
---
You mean... Assassin's Armor? Cause that already exists. 
---
If they are gonna mess the good weapons up then they should lower the health of basically everything to make it possible to kill things. My TSE lever action is now doing less damage than my grognaks axe even with most of the perks for rifleman. Thats bs. They should fix the important stuff instead of making people stop playing by nerfing the fuck out of the weapons.
---
I went back to platinum fo4. Playing it right now. 
---
If I am reading this right, you are complaining that some items on the atom store are being labled at a reduced cost for a limited time and then put back to their regular cost after the sale is up?
---
Some items pop in for a limited time and are not in the regular store, like the black power armor paint, some items are on sale for ~~600~~ 450 atoms for a limited time.....is it really that hard of a concept to grasp?
---
I'm going to keep playing because the TSE nerf was caused by Dupers and griefers, and sheer power of them. Now the game is available to be played closer as intended. The bugs are obnoxious, but a gun doing more damage than a Fatman in one shot is more obnoxious. 
---
Ah I haven't found a legendary power fist yet lmao
---
At least we can grind more now
---
I already had the handmade plans.  Traded a guy 750 caps for them.
---
I used to be a Power Armor mod merchant.  Now with all the plans in the vendors my Power Armor merchant days are over.  All that trading, all the rare items I gave up, just to get power armor mod plans, wasted.
---
I don't see the upside, sorry :(
---
He's S.p.E.C.I.A.L
---
Running fine for me. North America
---
Maybe. But it's a message saying Vault Tech engineers are on it or something to that effect
---
More like months.
---
Yes I will wait for a demo and 1 month after release will I consider a purchase...might go to a gaming cafe to try before I buy.
---
well improve on something
---
Sure, it used to take 1 bullet and now it takes 3.
---
Good job owning up! Need more people like you.
---
Get that kotaku shit outta here....
---
Or you could just learn how the game works and still do find damage without relying on an overpowered tse weapon, just stating.
---
I was never able to get into a nuke zone because it crashed. The previous patch (on Xbox) finally fixed that. It was awesome to finally get into them. I had missed out for so long. Now they're broken again :(
---
How so? Do you think the wording is fudged and this is player and humanoid bonus? Either way, if this were a lvl 50 weapon it would be a decent secondary. 
---
Literally like 70% of my post was pointing out the compromises that have been made. 
---
If you were promised a sports car, but ended up with a pretty and sleek looking car that has a 8 cylinder engine but only ran on 4, couldn't make it over 40mph, and had nylon seats instead of canvas would you be satisfied?
---
It has nothing to do with being entitled. Entitled would be us going to Bethesda and saying hey guys the game works great, bugs are at a minimum, basic mechanism work and feel good buuuut.... I want to be able to have a deathclaw in a pink tutu and a top hat named Billy that follows me everywhere I go and I am gonna be pissed if I don't get it.
---
We aren't asking for that. We are asking for an entire class of weapons to be usable(energy weapons), we are asking for support for ultra wide monitors which is an industry standard and has been for a long time, we are asking for a game that doesn't launch with more bugs than an EA title, we are asking for more than a single end game boss fight that is basically just a slightly more difficult version of a mob that pops up everywhere in the game.
---
If that is too much to ask from this game, and this is the quality of product I should expect from games going forward then I will talk with my wallet, but... Can you honestly sit there and tell me that you feel like the game is in a good place?
---
That ks dude, my problem was I was carrying 54 blank tapes
---
You underestimate them
---
na
---
Yeah, no bully pls.
---
I’m North America too, XB1
---
Assuming ok n XBox? Their servers borked around 2pm and haven't recovered yet. 
---
I just managed to finish rebuilding my camp from scratch again today after Bethesda's newest patch ate it.
---
True. 
---
And that, in itself, is BS. If you make a flash sale for 'limited-time' items then most would expect those items to be gone for a very long time at least.
---
I'd like to introduce you to the r/wow sub
---
They get all their news from Reddit. It's basically Reddit.
---
ya, I had a Census Violence in the eastern bog today and there is just no way.  3 waves of half-dozen glowing enraged anglers each, absolutely impossible to handle them solo and keep the robot clean.  He died at the beginning of the third wave.
---
Despite my full rifle 15 PER build, there were zero tactics available to protect him. 
---
I started playing a pokemon mmo after some osrs. There's supposed to be a ton of major fps and single player rpgs coming out this year. Anthem, Outerworlds, Halo, Doom Eternal?, Cyberpunk 2077?
---
The people raging are bomb throwers and two-explosive weapons users. They aren't able to instantly vaporize everything in their path now. 
---
I think a better question would be, "what went right?"
---
I only had an explosive radium but the nerf absolutely murdered it. I can't deal with Nerfs in a grindy game like this.
---
I've got no kids but 2 dogs who hate when I play. I love loot games and Diablo 3 on Nintendo Switch is probably where I'm heading.....I just can't stand to pay $60 for it when I've already bought it on Xbox and PC. The switch will allow me to play while the dogs are outside and I can make sure they don't eat the neighbors dogs.
---
PSN is txcowboy69, won't be home for a few hours though but I'm down to help.
---
what? .-.
---
Im not abusing any weight glitch, everything is stored in stash, although characters might slightly overweight after trade
---
Are the materials all in the same location: inventory or stash? Put all in one or the other.
---
Are the materials in bulk? If so, with the new patch, bulk has to be broken down to be used.
---
what to say you are goddamn right..... but isn't it time to play some finished games? i sticked to RE2 and its very nice :) i am huge fan of Fallout universe but from Fallout 4 that fallout universe disappearing and in this 76 there was only Vaults and Brotherhood of steel left xD don't get triggered i know there is a Enclave here too xDD 
---
but to the core of my message :) there is a lot of good games new or old but definitely better than Fallus (phallus) 76 and remember that every item you buy in atom shop bringing more shitty games in future.
---
Let's take a look, who knows. There are 2 possible methods that I think are possible: 62.5 dmg per bullet, or 100 and 25 dmg. The math would be:
---
.5[(62.5/185)^.3653] = .25 -&gt; .25(62.5) = 16
---
Then multiply 16 by 2, because 2 bullets, and you get 32. That's less than base nonlegendary dmg, so I think we can safely assume that they wouldn't be stupid enough to do this.
---
So, let's trying 100 and 25:
---
As we already know, we get 40 when we plug in 100. All we need to do is calculate for 25, then add:
---
.5[(25/185)^.3653] = .24 -&gt; .24(25) = 6
---
So that would be 40+6=46. Who knows if the damage resist is calculated this way or the first way I mentioned.
---
I'm not bitching about the Nerf, I'm bitching on the knee jerk reaction they gave it. All they really had to do is make it to where both perks couldn't be on the same gun, but instead they hit the panic button and just made them really bad.
---
Saying you quit &gt; Actually quitting 
---
Big oof on Bethesda’s part 
---
Trust me. If the game wants challenging content ( a grind) and competitive pvp (to quiet down the crybabies) then they'll have to nerf melee (the only true power build there ever was). Just give it some time they're still making updates. Parentheses for the Pessimists
---
If they really took the time to develop an actual fix for these issues and patch the correct game version (from 2 days ago) it could take a while..
---
They only want to patch over issues by nerfing everything. They need to roll back the nerf on explosives, reduce the nerf on 2SE, and buff energy weapons. Hell, melee could maybe even use a small nerf..
---
Actually...I will use this moment to plug r\\SkyrimTogether as they are finally in closed beta for multiplayer Skyrim :D
---
Well...its kinda hard NOT to respond when your house is on fire.
---
This bug springs up now and then, go and store all junk in your stash and attempt again
---
wait, what are you even texting about? 
---
It could be, but sadly with this game you can't rule out that it's yet another oversight. We can tell assassin's stuff got modified (it's down to -8% instead of -15% per piece for the armor), so maybe they just forgot to update the effects on the sword to say player instead of human. 
---
collecting/using junk and managing your storage of said junk is part of the game cycle. take it away you are are left with an open world shooter and not much else.
---
 personally I think it comes from people inability to shift from the "infinite" storage of the single player games and expected the same here without realizing multiplayer games have a different rule set. afterall if you should never have to collect junk why did people hate the dupers so much? But that is just my opinion feel free to ignore this part.
---
Make sure all your stuff is stored in your Stash (not split between stash and inventory).  This bug was from a while back and is still active.
---
New "bug" is that they made it so Bulk Items (as well as the Mods, which was intended) cannot be auto scrapped when crafting/repairing anymore.  You have to manually scrap them.
---
A. Don't be a dick
---
B. The space i referred to in the inventory for the unused power armor. 
---
C. The fact that i didn't need those perks until NOW. Yes i have points. Ill use them to get the perks. But that wasnt the original question was it,
---
D. and again i reiterate, Don't be a dick. Its a discussion thread about a video game not a political option. Don't get "neck beardy"
---
K thanks
---
Honestly,  all weapons need a drastic nerf. TSE are still too strong. I also recommend adding 1000 defense points to each piece of armor and 6000 to PA. Enemies should be capped at inflicting 1 damage. PVP should also be the same as far as damage inflicted. After PVP, opponents must emote hugs to each other and if they don't they will be fined 1000 caps.
---
Nerf melee! Also, just nerf everything to make sure no future nerfs are needed and you can stop F**** us out of our builds.
---

---
Had it go off a few times at queen events, use a gatlin also with stabilized, the whole bit. I pretty much keep shooting so I don't know if that's true. But who knows, maybe it did go off between reloads.
---
Since the patch I keep seeing the serendipity animation too, and I don't even have that equipped.
---
I read a comment from Ladydevann a couple hours ago saying they have one planned for the end of this week to address what they broke. 
---
I cannot provide a source, however. 
---
Sorry, but no.
---
YES! YES! YES!  I just thought about this doing the dishes.  "You can only have fun if you do it the exact mathematical way we at Blizzard, your Overlords, say you can!"
---
I still have never gone back to Blizzard, and I loved Diablo and Diablo II... good ol' days.
---
To hell with the damage, I go blind when they hit me with their sonic attack. And some of them spam it literally non-stop. How can I kill these things if I can't see them to shoot them?
---
Delete the extra. Apparently Bethesda misreads it as duping. I haven't seen hard evidence yet, but in this atmosphere of panic, why risk a ban?
---
It’s a new feature. Just like downgrading white knight to make you stuck at farming junks in order to prolong the game time. 
---
My expectations are not at a level where I can be disappointed further
---
I am online (PC) at the moment and I have an extra Green Asylum Worker Outfit and an extra Brown Asylum Worker Hat. 
---
Send me a friend request: **jyeary**
---
Yeah don't place down items if your budget is over 100%.  I think this triggers a response you won't like.
---
Because honestly I hoped my small contribution to their salaries mattered, but it doesn't. I probably won't play it ever again.
---
Oh you're right. I forgot besides saying
---
'Ill let the devs know'
---
She also occasionally says
---
'the devs are working on a fix that will be out soon'
---
Different.. but not really
---
u/jackpotjamieuk seems to have been banned for this too. That’s actually pathetic.
---
That is correct. But you see, I am also trying to bring to the forefront the issue that an item is labeled at a reduced cost *and then removed* only to be brought back quietly not long after. If I had spent the Atoms on a limited-time labelled item only for it to return again, I would be annoyed to say the least. 
---
All items are in the 'regular store' as soon as they are added. Limited-time items can show up again, they are not separate from the store itself. I have issue with items going on sale to only come back later, at full price.
---
Yeah, I found out I had a lot more than just an extra base in my storage. A shit tonne of stuff that I just took like 10 minutes to delete.
---
Does Venezuala have the atomic store though?
---
Perhaps that's because you use plastic to bulk items. So that's what cleared up the extra space.
---
The number values are there.
---
I'm just taking an extended break. I played a lot at the beginning and enjoyed it for what it was, so I'm putting the game on the back burner to see where it is in 8 months or a years time. Did the same with No Man's Sky and it's such a different experience now. I'm not saying that excuses Bethesda's awful launch, but sometimes that's the way things are. I did jump back in the other day to see what all had changed and the performance was much more stable than it was last time I played, so there's that at least.
---
I wouldn't be surprised tbh
---
The only Heavy Combat armor plan I saw in Watoga last night was Legs.  I'm still looking for the Arm and Body location.  Will check more spots tonight.
---
However little people care about our gripes, people care even less for pissy complaints like the one you just made. Like you are personally slighted because someone on the internet complained about a game you play. Get a grip.
---
&gt; I have to question the ability of their devs
---
Have you never played any of their other games ?
---
Uhhhhhh my base duped alot too.
---
I had 400 concrete and 100+ of every plant.
---
I think you're leaving out Some facts here.
---
Good faith and QoL improvements. Good joke, 10 out of 10, would tell again.
---
i noticed this myself 2 or 3 patches ago, with the plasma gatling gun - if you swap back to it like you say it just doesn't break
---
No 
---
Fallout 4, for all its other faults, is heavily replayable.  I haven't picked up '76 because I've been burned by the pre-order curse before, and I just keep seeing reasons to not pick it up.  
---
Lol, your point about outrage culture is on point but I don’t think they are actually going to hurt themselves or anyone else. It sucks getting burned by a game purchase, especially when you thought it would be something you would enjoy for a long time. I gotta say though, the feedback on this game has been particularly dramatic and sustained. IDK if it’s due to the nature of the Fallout fan base or if it’s because the game is particularly bad. I tend to lean towards the latter. 
---
Are they going to come to our homes and nerf us personally, or will they send minions?
---
Tank killer needs to be redefined for automatic rifles and non-automatic rifles. The bonus needs to be double if you are using non-automatic rifles. 
---
This would be a simple fix.
---
You will be.
---
You will be. 
---
I made a post about this yesterday. Explosive is only +20% to damage and demo is now only +60% so because its multiplicative that means a fucking 5 point perk only adds 12% more damage for weapons with the explosive affix. It's not worth it to use that perk anymore its broken.
---
What do you guys think?
---
I don't think this game will ever be fixed (to AAA standards).  We have the Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield around the corner.  Putting resources into Fallout 76 is the least of Bethesda's concerns.
---
Fallout 76 is not the Elder Scrolls Online--a game which had a rocky start but managed to turn it around.  Fallout 76 is broken beyond repair.  The entire foundation needs to be gutted and reworked.
---
You can upgrade it to a chefs rolling pin and give them a real beating! xD
---
will you send a video of you eating your shoe?
---
This exactly.  Some of us are smart enough not to blame the code monkeys but a large majority would probably just jump down their throat.  We don't need answers from a dev, who isn't going to answer any better than the CM.   We need them from THE dev, the project manager or whatever its title may be.  The guy that makes the decisions, the guy that can actually give answers rather than puke PR lines out.
---
Re-reddit?
---
This guy gets it. Also, nerf melee.
---
This. The outrage is regarding the TSE but they blame every other patched thing just to try and justify it.
---
this community is toxic
---
Well I'm going to be playing KH3 for a while, maybe they'll get their shit together before I'm done.
---
Way to alienate the players you have left, Bethesda :/
---
ok good for you so I was wrong, so why are you here now? Just to have something to bitch about? No? instead you have been bitching about another game..Anthem...but hey at least you get to do it somewhere, but to your credit, I agree with your views on the metoo movement, have a good day/night
---
Time to go back to the tin can farming at the top of the world 
---
Haven't thought of WoW in a long time. Stopped after WotLK. They dumbed it down, got rid of the gratifying stuff(a 40 man raid where everyone needed to be on point), and made it less skill oriented and more grind oriented. Might pick it back up again if they release a vanilla version again. 
---
I was part of that... they made some mistakes no doubt but there was never a moment that I sat around in game thinking is it worth doing anything?
---
They had lots of classes with awesome story telling and unique play-styles. I finished them all.  Leveling never seemed a chore...maybe a bit when you where leveling your 8th character, but oh the narratives was great and you just had to see them all.
---
The starship part was not a open galaxy like I would have liked but it was ok. (SWG did it perfectly)
---
Sadly F76 was released with not even 10% the content of SWTOR, but then as much as I truly love Fallout it is nowhere near as recognized as Star Wars.
---
I would say Beth should do a Fallout Movie but they would likely hire M. Night Shyamalan to direct and we would have something worse than The Last Airbender.
---
Yes omg did you play anthem beta?? The game mechanics are f-ing awesome fly to swim to fly is so smooth!! 
---
If games were priced that way we would have $70, $80, ect. games as standard price. But people won't pay that so publishers look to microtransactions for the additional income. Also, if this game was released as a $40 early access title I bet things would be so different. The game would be in a similar state but people wouldn't be soooooo fucking pissed off about it. Bethesda likely would not have permenantly blemished their reputation had they done this. Fallout 76 is a trial for Bethesda in the multi-player market. I bet they're burning their beloved IP to keep people around to keep testing. That way starfield can learn from 76 in a way a new IP just wouldn't. 
---
Good ol Kotaku. Couldn't get past the headline. Takes the most minor complaint made regarding the blunder of yesterday's patch abd complaints on Reddit and stirs it up like like it's breaking news. Bunch of smug assholes over there. Journalism is dead.
---
Agreed.  I haven't fabricated a weapon to use in ages.  I've only made them to break down for mods.  It cracks me up when I find a fully modded Sniper Hunting Rifle for the damage to be horrible.  Scrap time.
---
And a bloodied rolling pin doing more than a missile launcher is ok?
---
licenced plumber nerf - unclear
---
i dont see where this was a problem or "overperforming" the weapons are much weaker and the only advantage was the higher durability, we ate the cheap repair cost in farming the extra bullets we need to use.  now anyone who had one slotted is gonna search for an AR/hunting or appropriate pistol. 
---
Is your tse really that bad ? My handmade still kills things really fast just not as fast 
---
Yes I did.
---
&gt; All the Bethesda staff are doing the best they can ....
---
That's the worst possible indictment you could make, actually. If this is their best, then they should be fired and replaced. Because this is not remotely professional, not remotely businesslike, not remotely competent. It is the exact opposite of those things.
---
Video game communities are like terrorist organizations, you never full wipe them out, someone will always be playing until they shut the servers down
---
So enemies in most video games, including this one, have what are a called "weak points" as in, points where they are weak to attacks. In the case of super mutants their "weak point" is their head. You will find that most enemies have some kind "weak point" and you will be able to dispatch them faster if you are able to aim for these areas.
---
&gt; If they don't have the skillset for big fixing, then they would literally just be sitting idle. 
---
Well, if they're modelers, texture artists etc.  They could simply be re-assigned to create more props/content for the existing game world, which might get BSG some positive publicity...
---
Why are you doing workshops for mats?
---
I get 100 lead from the charleston firehouse gym.
---
Then i hit up pleasant ski resort and grab all the cans for another 60.
---
🤣😂 definitely this 
---
what is the "truth" then since you are apparently so knowledgeable and wise...
---
Couldn't agree more. But it's Beth, man. We are screwed.
---
With their hyperinflation, at least their prices would match
---
Bingo, there were many solutions to this problem. They chose one, and let us deal with the rest. Demolition should cost 3 instead of 5 because it is now equal to the old demolition 3. Duped items should have been deleted because they can apparently tell if you have duped items, to which they also said they can remove said items in the event of an unban. TSE weapons are still very powerful, and are about what you would expect from end game. More content in the next few patches will make endgame larger and more enjoyable, with level +50 weapons being available. 
---
I hear ya.  It took 20 to 24 shots from my combat rifle to take out one level 68 super mutant today.  There are definitely a lot of ways to solve the problem and I'm good with any idea that will make all play styles viable.  I only have +30% damage on my rifle since I keep my lockpick perks equipped.
---
But those people aren't in vaults they're at Top Of The World. I personally would like to see an adult Freddy wandering around with Miss Annie after a vault opens. 
---
Thank you! Forgot about that one. Good to include. 
---
I'm getting more and more frustrated by the day. Sorry to here someone else now dealing with it. I have no advice because nothing works 
---
The Boxing Glove is the best one, jk, the Deathclaw does more damage but the Power Fist has mods that can add energy damage and armor puncturing, I prefer the Power Fist 
---
I paid money for a game. I'm entitled to a game.
---
I haven't. I picked it up right before I had to leave for work. 
---
That's OK.  I'm sure they'll tell us, **"We're Listening*****^(TM)*****,"** and they will promise to, **"Communicate more frequently and transparently*****^(TM)*****."**
---
*Again.*
---
You know.  The standard video game developer get out of jail free card when you want to calm down fans without actually having to \*actually do anything.\*
---
I'm saying the modifier on the weapon should've received a nerf, not the perks that made explosive weapons viable, (perhaps remove modifiers from perk bonus pool.) i'd love to use 'nades but they weigh too much for what they are
---
Molotov are good to tag a few mobs tho 
---
Dudes write a book
---
No bamboozle?
---
No way. 230 hours into the game and I’d never seen Lever or Handmade plans. By the time I learned that they locked out after certain levels I was already beyond that point. 
---
Sure, the prices are high and that’s a bit of a shame, but at least I can now get the plans I want. This system makes much more sense to me. 
---
where were you 10 seconds ago!
---
That's good to know, I was appearing offline!
---
If it takes longer to level, it takes longer for new players to reach the endgame and realize the issues that many of us have already realized. 
---
If I was still level 20 I'd probably still be having a blast, ruling out the breaks from the most recent patch of course.
---
Oh, I know of that one. Made a post about it :)

For me there's stuff like that, pwease, the teddy bear tea party in the middle of a field and so on. Also, some of the holo tapes are brutal, particularly Colonel in flatwoods, storage closet lady in Morgantown Airport, Abbie in general though he has some adorable moments of levity and the whole Order of Mystery's questline.
---
Some of this stuff I personally think is better than stuff in the previous games. It's just a shame it gets lost in the mire that is this game.
---
[I mean Deej the community manager](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeeJ_BNG) for Bungie did it for an entire year when destiny 2 was getting completely shit on with horrible dlc's, bugs, crap end game, etc. The games state was so bad they called in all the top streamers and youtubers to look over their content plans, give suggestions and tell them what to do next. So it was kind of easy not to respond while his house was on fire
---
It gives me conniptions
---
I was able go go through said shift, with some difficulty, I admit, but it was doable. What they are doing now is making it much worse, and for no good reason at all. Point me in the direction of fun, in this game. Seriously, I am not saying this to make a point, but as a genuine request. I just can't find it anymore.
---
You'll definitely see me on Anthem :) literally made that decision after the patch yesterday

The whole country is an Atomic shop.

You can get money in country (Atoms in game) but it ain't worth nears as much as if you bring in dollars!

3 million bolivares ($0.46) for a kg of carrots, after they lopped off 5 zeros from their currency and a 3,000% increase in their minimum wage.

That's okay, I trust you &lt;3
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
It broke the game for everybody. It's best to just leave it alone at least until they fix it
---
I am not following what you are saying. The only reduced cost limit item I have seen was the christmas stuff and that hasnt been back (and I wouldnt expect it back until christmas comes around again)
---
I have yet to see and limited items come in to atom store as a normal item but i will admit I dont watch it like a hawk.  though now I wonder if it is even labeled a limited item and just that the item is available for a limited time.  
---
currently the only limited time item i see in the vault tech combat armor paint which is a normal shop item that is on sale and will (presumably) go back to its usual price once the sale is over.
---
I'm SO sorry, man!
---
If it's a background change, it can be hard to notice. If a change was made to make say something 20% stronger, they would test it, do the math and confirm the change took place and then maybe follow it up with further test cases to find if it causes any unintended issues(this is large guesswork, but sometimes there can be logic to where to look), and complete the task. But then weeks later the change is accidentally reverted, you don't have a task for that change anymore and it doesn't make much sense to be constantly checking this one thing over and over with every build because it's not feasible. You might do that for a Major A-class issue, but not for balance changes. So how would you really notice the change reverted. You also have to remember that not every member of QA knows every bug that is occurring. Some people might not ever see an issue and the guy next to them might see it 20 times. You might even start writing a bug for something that has already been bugged or even fixed but not regressed. And also, not everybody regresses their own issues. So you might be the one who found a bug, but you might not be the one who later regresses it when it is fixed. So even if you see a bug that has been fixed, you might think it never got fixed, because you weren't the one to regress it. And sometimes an issue could be so prevalent that people assume that it has already been bugged and it goes unchecked for longer than it should. Sometimes a bug can just disappear between builds. 
---
Overall, it's kind of like expecting a bouncer or a doorman to recognize every person who came and went from a building and retain that information for months on end, even though 5 different people watch the door at different times.
---
IMO though, this whole thing sounds like it could have been an issue where someone submitted changes that overwrote someone else's and it went unnoticed because they were fixed and regressed in the last milestone. Or possibly just a mix-up when compiling and packaging it all up when sending it out.
---
I actually may have a better one.

Had my base duped multiple times in the past, never got banned.

These things happen a lot when folks are rushing through, trying to meet their sprint deliverables, or under a lot of crisis/pressure. People don't get fired for these things unless it's a reoccurring thing. Teams put in place process to mitigate these issues and improve the process if things slip through.
---
I'm a technical project manager now so my role in this is to ensure we have a process and roll forward. Sometimes during these crisis we discuss impact: not all users will notice the issues, others will reach out to customer service, and some will see but keep quiet. Overall, it's a big deal and the best course of action is get in front of the issue and make things right. That might be a series of hotfix or a larger communication to users. 
---
The former is most likely the scenario, they should say something as soon as possible, and because they haven't I'm guessing they're still fixing the issue so that they can provide a time to resolution. Basically it's hard to communicate out without an expected resolution because without that detail it makes the message somewhat useless. Saying, sorry guys we goofed and expect a fix on Xx/Xx is a lot better than, sorry we goofed and will let you guys know when we have a fix. 
---
&gt;Well everyone is making it easy when they shit on every single game company out there. Up until a year ago, Bethesda was one of the most beloved companies, yet they are crucified for putting out one "bad" game.
---
Bethesda has been criticized for years for what F76 is the boiled-down essence of. Also, I think we've reached the point where you don't need quotation marks around "bad". That's not to say you can't love the game however; I love NBA 2k14 (500+ hrs) despite it being a super shitty port.
---
&gt; If CP 2077 comes out and is a mess, people will turn their backs on CD Projekt Red. 
---
Unless the promotion material and shown gameplay were a horrible misrepresentation, I'd really doubt that.
---
Tumbleweed......distant bells.....crow squarks....
---
I had this bug happen to me also a few weeks ago. I didn't known what was happening after I placed my CAMP and was unable to build anything new. Then I noticed I had a whole second copy of my CAMP in the stored tab eating up the rest of my build allowance. If I was subsequently banned for this I would be furious.
---
I tried to make a post similar to this one about a month ago and all I got was people calling me angry idiot and a bunch of hostility lol
---
I'm glad a lot of the hardcore Fallout 76's fans who refused to accept or listen to any of the criticism or reviews over the last few months are finally starting to realise that maybe, just maybe the people who were critical from the start had a very good point.
---
There is still a few plans only available at Grahm but that’s it 
---
I'm sorry, I just assumed that if it takes you around 40 bullets to kill them that you might be aiming at their feet or missing them entirely.
---

2000 hours? That would be over 25 hours a day. hmm. 
---
Same I play solo on a team....herd mentality.
---
You've missed the point entirely, taken what I said personally because I can only assume I hit a little too close to home for you, twisted it into your own context, then accuse me of creating a pissing match when clearly attacked me and insulted me personally on top of it all, and now you're trying to tell me what I think. Your opinions are not facts, and you're the only one here trying to push them as such. You are a PERFECT example of the toxicity that exists within this community, proven only more true by your reactions and continued insistence on having to be correct and denying reality. I have no more desire to allow you to waste my time. 
---
4lbs of plans is only 16 plans 
---
From what I remember, it's at the bottom of one of the fields. You have to scroll down to find it.
---
Yes they are nerfed, I made and experiement, my economy was build on mothman eggs, so I tried to go further and have a detailed look, this are my finds.
---
.Mothman eggs, and also tato plants, muti plants, etc are now respawning every 25 - 30 minutes. No more server hoping like crazy. Are now treated like a container with a 30(ish) minutes to respawn again. Tried for 3 hours and that was consistent. 
---
What in the hell happend with Bethesda complete pachnotes!!?? Im really thinkg at this point, FO76 are being runing under a office full of apes with typewriters.
---
Hope its helps in this grindy fest dark nerfed times. Sorry about my english. 
---
If there is an enemy in the area, the caution status seems to pop up more than it ever did. It’s not always on, but on more often than before. Certain enemies seem to spot me way easier. Mole rats seem particularly good at this. As soon as I hear the sound of one spawning underground I seem to be instantly spotted. I don’t have any hard stats, it just feels considerably different than before and enough others are commenting about something being up. It’s gotta be something. 
---
Welcome to Red Tear builds from souls. We don't call them OP we call them a risky move. 
---
/remind me in 2 years
---
The game works fine for some of us. No glitches for me. Nothing broken. It all works great.
---
People lie on the internet. A lot.
---
I’ve had my base duplicate stuff on more than one occasion but it hadn’t occurred to me that Bethesda might see that and ban me for it. That seems inconceivable but I wouldn’t put anything past these people. It’s pretty clear that they are completely incompetent and poorly led. It’s kinda epic to see a company fail so completely. We are in the middle of a debacle that will later become a meme. 
---
I'll see you Feb 22 xbox jetstar4
---
Thank you for your outstanding service in the field of grammar, your country is proud of you son
---
Yes, but they aren't people that may currently inhabit one of the still sealed vaults 
---
2,000 hours would be over 25 hours a day since release. 2,000/ 77 = 25.97
---
I think it's a little different.  Bethesda wants our business not the other way around.  Gamers are pretty much saying "if you don't fix your shit, I'm leaving you."
---
The analogy he used would be the same as Bethesda saying "if you leave us (stop playing our game), we will kill ourselves."
---
But anyway, yeah this game is blowing major dongs right now.
---
Yes it is. In general range weapons are really weak at the moment. Literally everyone were using at least explo weapons, not necessarily TS but at least explo. Nerfing the demo card and combining that with a explo nerf, weapons are now doing fraction what they did before. 
---
The whole community would have been pleased if there was like a TS from 100 to 50 and E from 100 to 50 but what was the demo card mess up??? Just uncalled for. And ts is always a bit inaccurate so I don't even understand the nerfing need. Used single shot explosives already before the nerf. Now the TSE over nerf combined with poor accuracy from the ts it's not even a option anymore
---
Okay pumpkin, sorry you can't handle reading complaints about a game you voluntarily play on a forum you voluntarily visit.  
---
I agree this was probably the best add-in with the patch. But would it be possible to make the known plan go to the bottom of the list or the unknown plan above the known. Having to scroll through 50 known plans before I can even see the ones I don't know is annoying.
---
While this is all true to a certain extent. The company profits 10's of millions of dollars every year for the 10 that i know of. Plenty of cash to keep servers up and to have a game that works like they intend it to. There is where the problem lies. Gamers like you defend the shitty money grab practices and it has now become the standard in the industry. And in turn investors hold the company leaders to that standard and officers start flying out windows
---
I haven't played the first 75 yet.
---
Not only saying it should be cheaper, but they thought the game was complete and released as a complete game. Along with a cheaper price, they should've made it clear the game is still in development. 
---
Oh is that an issue, I thought it was just me... I'm camped near there and ft to that blank screen often

no need to be fired.  im sure a company like BES can easily reassign them to another job, or train them to fix the bugs.  yes it will require time to train if need be.  The patches they release fix 1-2 things and break 5-6 things.  maybe they are better off hiring/training and get this game back in shape, then keep pro longing the fixes and lose their remaining player base.
---
Look up videos of people glitching into the vaults, guess what? Everyones dead! 
---
To further this talk, no one is slighted becasue of the game we play they are annoyed by the continued whining about something cause its not fixed yet, or about a mistake made...not sure how you got thru life without making mistakes but I havent , made many today, so come of your high horse, wipe the tears and move forward
---
I constanly had this bug. I did like 95% damage to a scorchbeast and it went back to 75% heslth. This bug is stupid now with the nerf it hurts even more. 
---
That is what I am hoping for but I might not have any friends left to play. This is becoming a niche game.
---
But retains the point
---
Thank you for your outstanding service in the field of grammar, you make your country proud son
---
For me they did well like maybe 2-3 patches before and ever since then they've been sliding. Less accurate. Less useful information in terms of dev notes (though recent one was ok in this specific regard, compared to the one just before it). More stealth changes.
---
Like honestly, how hard is it to track every change that's made. There needs to either be a system in place tracking it or a culture of reporting changes, no matter how major or minor to the person writing the patch notes. It looks like they have neither. 
---
I mean we're all human. We can make mistakes but some of these "mistakes" and omissions are glaring.
---
We trusted Bethesda when no one else did and they failed us
---
Lol yeah tOxIcItY, how dare I disagree with your stupid point! I must be toxic! 
---
Its probably the limit of 24 players per server. The map is huge so Unless its whitesprings or a popular event like uranium fever you don't see many other players (yes I'm on ps4)
---
Yeah, probably quitting modding them soon to move points for damage but we can 100% get your radium into tip top condition. Add me and we'll make it happen!
---
How do you show proof if you’re banned bro? Cmon now 
---
You're making a clear statement about the sample (people downvoting) of the population (subreddit users) being non-representative.  But you don't KNOW that that's the case in the same way that he doesn't KNOW that it's a perfect representation.  
---
The downvotes are definitely indicative of the voice of the sample that submits votes.  In fact, Reddit explicitly accepts them as the voice of the community because downvotes get people handicapped, or their posts obscured once they become weighty enough.  
---
Obviously the actual representation is somewhere in the middle, and not exactly either of your opinions.  But reddit is agreeing with /r/MrSinister55.  Downvotes and upvotes ARE representative, and the more of them the more representative of the community's position.
---
Most of these issues are b4 the patch.

My favorite was when the mage bound every key on his keyboard to Arcane Blast and literally rolled his face back and forth on the keyboard and topped DPS  😂
---
Yup. Thank god we have a useless scrapping perk to go with all the scrapping.
---
Who said anything about none stop.
---
They nerfed hopping anyways so stuff doesn't respawn anymore.
---
But hey, do your mindless grind if you want. I never do the same thing repeatedly anymore and I'm pushing 500 steel/lead/gunpowder.
---
I haven't ever felt the need to do lucky mine and you can pull 700+ ore out of there.
---
With super duper that number skyrockets
---
I don't understand all these posts, I'm on XBL right now. just finished the back on the beat event with two other random people 
---
That's fine. Maybe it isn't easier for you. But it is easier and more convenient for me, so I bulk my junk. Different strokes, etc.
---
True, although I use vats against them so never noticed too much. Also theres a PC mod that reduces it.
---
ahh then its not really that big of a deal
---
Also! Why am I able to two or three shot a dude in XO-1 power armor with a 10mm while I'm wearing a tux? A dude in power armor with a gatling laser should require a squad of handsome tuxedo wearing dudes to take him down. 
---
With patrolman sunglasses, of course.
---
If you play in a certain style, you might be virtually unaffected by it. But right now anybody using powerful weapons, bulking resources, carrying around bobby pins, swapping perk cards, playing on multiple characters, or trying to build CAMPs is experiencing new and returning issues, some of which are gamebreaking
---
the wasn't the issue post patch...
---
I'm aware?
---
The christmas items were a logical limited-time seasonal addition and removals. Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit is not.
---
As the Vault Tec PA paint may never be seen again. That is part of the problem with no news post to explain how the store is handled. It could reappear in a month and back at regular price, in which case the limited-time discount is good but you have no way of knowing if said item will ever return, if it does.
---
Yessssss, congrats mate! I know, my tse went from 360 to  98 damage yesterday. They needed to be nerfed but not that hard!
---
I'm aware of this
---
Goddamn it, it's JuicyFace, I was hoping for Rick Astley. You know what, I'm just going to listen to Never Going to Give You Up anyway.

No its about 19 hours a day if you count beta testing! Its not really 2000 but it damn feels like it
---
I habitually and easily take down scorchbeasts with an anti-armor silenced 10mm pistol on a sneak/vats crit build in short order. I should not be able to compete with a gatling in this way.
---
&gt;Your first quote isn't a direct quote of mine, so I don't have many details to give there. 
---
Technically I wrote and posted it, I just dressed it up as quote, to draw an allusion and comparison to what you said.
---
&gt;. You're arguing that a mechanic that allowed players to simply hip fire in the general direction of movement, safely from the top of a bus or large rock, and one-shot something is the same as needing a build that requires a decent damage reduction and attack to do the same thing in a longer period of time.
---
It's not a mechanic, just values, just the amounts of damage any TSE did. The quote wasn't yours, but the point was. You said melee is easy. The most simpliest of defination of what is OP, it's combination of powerful and easy.
---
&gt;If you want to discuss exactly what melee needs nerf'd (perks, base weapon damage, etc) I'll gladly have that discussion.
---
Not really. Im not going to write anything to Bethesda anyway, so I don't like so much of too theoretical talks. But since practically all high level guns got nerfed, as they relied at least on TS or E, well, suddenly melee which was pretty strong to begin with, got major a buff. Relative buff, since nothing is in vacuum, there's always the enviroment around, and pretty much everything else got nerfed hard.
---
But little about it, since you seen serious and honest. The base damage of melee seems fine. Significantly higher than guns, but okay enough, considering you don't have range or rate of fire. I think the problem is combination of unyielding, bloodied and str linked to melee damage. Great melee perks like insicor don't really help either, but those 3 I think are the main problem. 
---
And seeing how Bethesda dealth TSE, if and when they are nerfing melee, I think they will do it in similiar fashion, nerfind hard each contributing effect/perk alone, instead of only addressing the most offensive combinations. Which will suck because it will then affect all other funny builds and combinations that hurt absolutely no one.
---
&gt;You make it take more than a couple of hit to take out higher level enemies with melee and it just doesn't become viable. Try to nerf melee for yourself. Get a lower level weapons, drop half the damage mods (or however much you feel should be dropped) then go to Wes-Tek or a Silo. See if when it takes 4-5 hits per enemy at point blank fixes melee at all.
---
With what? I don't have melee. Most people who like melee won't be the ones calling it to be nerfed. That's very obvious. So I don't have melee perks, I don't have specials to grab them(I do have points to take any cards I want), I surely am not supposed to compare 0 star melee weapons I could quickly find or craft, into good 2 star guns I have. Plus I don't use PA outside of nuke zones, Im pretty sure melee hugely benefits on higher resistances than what armor can provide. Plus one of the biggest complaints I have about ordinary armor, is it's significantly smaller radiation resistances. Any time any of those stinking bloating ghouls hit me even once, I take permanent damage in form of radiation I can't quickly heal. Im okay with armor having overall weaker resistances, because you can pretend the better sneaking and possibly mobility are trade off. And again, I have mostly vanguar armor so that's not comparable to melee builds.
---
The people abandoning the game are doing so because they can't handle issues. Staying with the game and helping it become what you want is more "adult" than saying you won't come back. If people ditch everything that goes different than what they want, they won't get far. When the game is all fixed they'll probably come back, even though the whole time they were not playing they were insulting the game and devs. If it doesn't suit them perfectly they run away.

I am confused as to why energy weapon ammo requires 3 perk points in Batteries Included to reduce the weight by 90% but ballistic weapons only need 2 points with bandolier. This is even more reason for folks to defer to ballistic weapons, beyond all the other nonsense that already exists to sway the preference.
---
Understood, but first off there is no way to measure actual downvotes - the post in question is firmly upvoted.
---
He said "The fact that your post got downvoted just proves how terrible this community is." and I disagree ENTIRELY with this position. As said, the comment is absolutely upvoted and there is no log of how many downvotes, and the fact there are almost 200,000 people here means a small handful of downvotes absolutely don't "prove how terrible this community". And a third thing, disagreeing and downvoting aren't terrible things, I disagree with him saying that - and he resorts to telling me I'm toxic, however I don't think my disagreement is toxic - I think he was factually wrong and stated my reasons why. 
---
Downvotes aren't counted, they are anonymous, and literally ANYONE can make them - subbed members or not. I fail to see how they represent "the community" in any way. 
---
That does seem like it would be a good move for Bethesda.  Especially since they already dipped their toe into that pool in Fallout 4.  And even moreso since the best Destiny apps were made by the community using Bungie's API, Bethesda is so familiar with community-driven content.
---
Don't try stopping the incoming melee nerf! I have seen your mind, and it is dark!

Limited time sales are probably more likely an effort to create a marketplace between users for "rare" ATOM store items. This is the same way many games operate and even though its plain old artificial scarcity they're probably going to create a marketplace for people to buy and sell their rare ATOM store items and Bethesda will get a cut of the money spent.
---
they broke that too with this patch, bobblehead perks no longer stack, specifically patched for that reason...

I really like Odyssey, and have been playing it lately instead of fo77. I've gotten 20 hours in and only 10% of main story finished (I do side quests and explore the map a lot). It's a really immersive, beautiful world. The story is good as well, I just get so distracted

All of your duped TSE are useless and you suck at PvP now, right? Good riddance. 
---
I think it's super easy for none of that stuff "to have life" if you aren't supposed to be there. I have watched the videos, and the only real information I took from them is that the sealed vaults have interiors and that and some point during this games life they should open. Just because a bunch of bodies were in there doesn't really mean anything for now since it's not a part of the world that is supposed to be open yet. Just like a bunch of the stuff on the reward terminal could change. I also could be wrong and there could be a big fanfare for a vault opening only to find everyone dead inside as well. Both are possibilities from my perspective.
---
I’ve been doing that. I get the following error upon trying to start up the game. “Vault-Tec engineers are hard at work getting our servers back online!” (CommunicationError) (3:0:8444249301319680)

Most people complaining aren't doing so regarding TSE being nerfed (most people agree it needed it). They do not like the *way* it was nerfed. The way it was done completely destroys builds that use grenades/missle launchers/etc
---
A lot the complaints also center around the white knight perk which has nothing to do with TSE.
---
I haven't even really seen people complaining about the carry weight (although we've constantly complained about the low stash space)
---
And stealth is broken. I played for an hour last night and was never able to successfully hide. Only [caution] status. 
---
1700 hours of it and I'm still in love with that game. Looking forward to div2. And a huge plus is to see how they have always listened to and communicated with the community. 
---
In the beginning of the B.E.T.A. period they read my support ticket and responded within days of it being made. Not every case is handled so quickly, if anything.
---
I noticed the same and made a post as well. Not sure if intentional or an issue from the roll back update.
---
Also recon scopes don't show lased targets when aiming down sights anymore.
---
I'm still sticking with it. What the game needs is people to stick with it so it won't die. If you just quit on it, Bethesda will see it floundering and kill it off as soon as they make enough money off of it to pay back all the time and effort that went into making this.
---
But hey if you're set on leaving...how about you give me all your crap :)
---
I honestly don’t think they give a shit. I don’t think they plan to invest the time or money to make it good. Clearly they were content with selling a bad game and I don’t see evidence that they are committed to doing what is necessary to turn the ship around. I think it was a pure cash grab thrown together with the most minimal effort needed to make a decent profit. It’s even more obvious when you think about the liquor, leather jacket, and “canvas” bag they sold in addition to the piss poor game. 
---
I never saw the rocket girl labeled as a limited item. and again the current item is a regular item on sale at 30% off for a limited time, I have seen nothing to suggest it is going away after the sale is over.
---
yes its bugged, they fucked up the search and half the containers wont let you search them.
---
So the perk card is not as great right now
---
yet your all still here grying in the forums...smh is laughable, when you stop with the game you stop with the forums and announcing on the internet is attention seeking, nothing more
---
I loved the division for the opposite.  I loved the visuals and the NYC setting.  But the incremental slow grind to improve my weapons was disheartening.  I would do several quests and maybe get a mod or materials to craft a mod that MIGHT improve my DPS 20-30 points on a 5000 dps weapon.  
---
Well shit, that was some grafting for little gain.  So once I'd done the stories, and all that was left was levelling equipment, I quit.
---
No one can be alive, there's fucking a forest and mirelurks in one, lava in another, and tons of fire in the last one
---
I haven't stopped playing it but it has been a few weeks since I fired it up, too busy playing my sale games, well spintires mudrunner. Can you believe I played a level for 3 hours and only travelled 13km, boggles the mind.
---
Walk into the light, all your childhood pets are waiting for you there!
---
As an noob level 47 grenade user (not TSE) I feel like I wasted time putting points into demo exp. 
---
From my personal experience the real problem is that enemies are too bullet spongy and that ranged weapons aren't comparable to melee weapons at the end of the game.  
---
TSE was way overpowered but the nerf went too far in reducing damage to the point where melee is the most viable build you can have.  It's really hard to have a truly viable ranged build right now and people are right to be upset about Bethedsa taking the nerf too far.  The nerf was needed but they used a mini nuke to kill a bloatfly here.
---
They have their world designers to do that work. Or maybe those people are one in the same, so either way, nothing is changed.
---

Dude they are using a 15 year old engine lol go after them for being cheap I don't think their devs are stupid they are told what to do and they do it. $$$$$$$$

Because the FTC isn’t even close to someone who would care. That’s not their domain.

It's got a lot to it, it just doesn't throw its features in your face so it's easy to think there isn't much to it. 
---
lol. i was thinking the same thing.  its basically saying the same shit with different words.  
---
Oh great, didn’t fix that huh.  Stopped letting me patch before this one, just been praying never have a bug that stores my camp since then
---
I'll have what he's having.
---
Hmm... maybe. If the net benefit was there.
---
I mean the non breakdown of bulk junk is real annoying but not a deal breaker. The bobby pin weight this is less about the weight thing and more the principle of being so incompetent that you undid a previous fix, which then begs the question "what else was unfixed?". It's more of a hit to confidence in a game and company where confidence is at an all time low, even with the most ardent fans.
---
I don't know about today but yesterday was a great day for me in terms of server performance and stability, so I don't know about roll back but I get where you're coming from though.
---
Im level 58. For a weapon i have 10 perks which effect the damage on it, it dropped from 390 damage a shot to 115 damage a shot. thats a little more significant than just bitching about not being able to one shot, considering i have another gun thats NOT legendary with  113 damage with only 3 perks that effect it, and was not effected by this patch.  the entire relevance of the stealth sniper explosive build is rendered pointless.  
---
not so much a fan as a realist, I like the game, other don't, if I do not like a game I move on not continue to bitch that it doesnt meet my standards

Yes its sad, this patch its pretty fucked. Im still playing, lots of places to discover the hidden stories, but everyday its harder to focus on exploring and enjoing the world when i need to repair or craft ammo every hour and farm the mats for that. They are going in the wrong direction. I just my point of view, have around 300 hours already and hope they fix this mess pretty soon. 
---
Definitely feels as if they want people to specialize in certain weapon types/perk builds but then go and penalize some people who found some synergies in the perks.  I get they want to make PvP balanced, but their nerf bat is harming those who just want a PvE experience and it doesn't sound like they intend to change that once they have their Hardcore Mode servers up.  Just wish they had more back and forth about these kinds of changes before just shoving them into a patch.
---
Automated testing is really only done when testing performance. You can't really automate someone trying to break a game very well.
---
I did for a while. Now I'm sitting on over 3000 atoms after spending 1000 or so. Nothing in the shop is appealing to me, though.

Ah, I see your problem. I think they’re in the Dev Room, you should try there.

I'm not saying it's bad because it's not fun for me. It was bad WAY before that. It's bad because...well...just read a couple of random posts here. As Im sure you have. You seem like a very reasonable person, do you actually consider FO76 to be a good game? I never did, but it was fun for a while. It isn't anymore, so I suppose I will take your advice.

4. Photosynthetic Perk is not providing health regeneration during day. I watch my Pipboy clock go from 8 AM to 10 AM and did not receive a single sliver of health back. I'm wondering if this perk was broken after last weeks server wide "night" event ended, as the event added regeneration during the evening.

It is for those who grinded the queen 30+ times for those plans

K. Have fun crying about all the people on their internet that say things you don't like.
---
The mods would have to be very active in the threads.  
---
Im loving it. Play for about two hours everyday or two. Its a nice break from school and crap. Lately I've been playing more of a raider role tbh. Today I wanted plans and quest rewards so I took six workshops. I love how artillery tears apart their turrets.
---
No more stacking bobbleheads is a great improvement! :)
---
It doesnt matter that the atom shop team is different. Take the resources from that team and allocate the to the team that pushes out fixes to help fix this broken ass game. Dont act like its impossible, or that there isnt anything that can be done. This is a conscious business decision which clearly displays your companies lack of care for the people that bought this game. How stupid do you think we are?
---
So, do you consider also any negatives or should Bethesda just turn God mode on for PA users with heavy weapons? I see it can be frustrating with the weapon breakdown and damage, but seriously, they also must have a downside. Like low ammo availability, tuned down movement speed or extreme repair costs. Like to increase vats accuracy is the opposite of what I would consider heavy weapons to work like :D The game lacks an option for non PA users like me as it stands right now, your changes will only make things worse.
---
Also, if you buff heavy weapons, you should look on pistols - then we can maybe have one day a fair balance between heavies, melee, rifles and pistols. 
---
Will do 👍
---
No but like it was way before they even said bad things about glitches. The stash glitch got patched fairly quickly. Also tons of people will now have millions of stash carry weight which "slows down" the servers. They have to let people get things out of their stash or they will never fix the server instability
---
I did see it with my own two eyes, and people called out the absurd regular price of that item and the discount not being much better for pricing. This current 'regular item' may never appear again, that is the basic issue at hand.
---
Great response.  Thanks.
---
The games inoperable? That's fucking crazy how I'm playing it right now then.
---
Oh shit! There is 12 other people on my server. HOLY SHIT SO INOPERABLE!!! 
---
LOL what a joke this sub has become. 
---
I think I should start a new one. 
---
As a sneak/ rifle build... I'm gonna need to see this video.
---
Even in sneak with headshots it takes me forever to kill anything.
---
Well, it is useless since you can't build up another crit in the same VATS round.
---
you'd think after the 500 other posts saying literally this exact same thing people would stop posting this worthless shit.
---
Yeah, I had that same thing happen today as well. Same type of ghoul too. First I was surprised he was "legendary" but had no starts next to the name and then he dropped no legendary loot. I guess it's better than getting an Assassin's Wood Chest-piece though...
---
If it’s a legitimate bug that needs to be fixed, then it can be listed. 
---
This thread just taught me about anthem, I’m looking forward to it now.
---
"anyone that disagrees with my is a blind fanboy"
---
One memorable early Skyrim patch, it was unplayable on PS3 for a week before they fixed it. Just saying, this kind of situation is not unique to FO76. Maybe try a different game until after the next patch?
---
You’re using twice the ammo now so maybe you didn’t notice... or it could be true I’m not sure 
---
The crit bar never fills up after the first crit unless you re-enter VATS. That's the problem.
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
You should quit then shit post. That's the reddit way
---
&gt;nigh
---
The FTC's equivalent of the BBB Online complaint portal doesn't require pretend-lawyer-speak.  Could have done without any of the uses of "said", the repeated use of their full name (technically the parent company's name), and any of the claims that can be easily refuted (no effort at all to fix issues, when there is documentation covering hundreds of minor changes over the 80ish days since release across multiple patches).
---
If you did it under the help.bethesda site then you log in an click on your ticket. If it's even still open my first ticket was closed with no answer when the game first came out.
---
It's the lack of great npcs and enthralling storyline that separates this from this from the other fallout games. Like op says this is a chore not an epic adventure in a wasteland of wonder
---
Thank you for the info. :( this means there is no way to collect all magazines.
---
Same. This is the first time I watched the spokesman at all the press briefings since I enjoyed all the other Bethesda games so much and was looking forward to this game especially (I forget his name but everyone claps a lot for him). Working for a large company I saw his messages as a man who used to be purely passionate about delivering quality games and a man who was being asked by the stakeholders to sell the game as best he could regardless of quality. He tried to rationalize the weak points and pretend that because he made us aware beforehand that the game wasn't perfect then the community would cooperate. Thought it was a load of bullshit I was seeing through but figured I'd try the beta out and give it a chance. Refunded through Amazon the day before full release thank God. He is a company man trying to make money for the company and trying to pull a blanket over the consumer's eyes, I'll never trust him again and hope no one else does. Hopefully the company can refind it's way or license the series to a smaller group of developers who dont have profits hanging over their heads as the driving force. Definition of a shit show. 
---
Oh sure yeah anyone duping TSEs, obtaining TSEs from someone that they know duped it, or stacking bobbleheads can go to hell and they haveno business complaining about anything. 
---
And there's the answer, worked like a charm.
---
Im just providing information for those who didnt get it. Didnt mean to offend anyone, cheers.
---
memo. Play daily as well but I'm still missing the rpg part of the mmorpg. It's literally mmo.
---
Ok thanks 
---
It doesn’t crash all the time for me. Just played for three hours earlier today and stayed connected the whole time. I dunno what to tell you. 
---
The entitlement and crying in this subreddit is getting to me.
---
Complaining about the way fusion cores work with no perk investment is unbelievable. Why even have perks or any other functional build customization in the game if you just want everything to be amazing for free?
---
Uhhh if you say so. 
---
That doesn't happen to me.
---
*Fool me twice...well...heh, you aren't gonna fool me a second time.*
---
Clarify for me, I always thought that legendary +stars, meant that legendary enemies do get to heal up to the number of stars they are.  So a three star legendary can heal up three times.  Unless you do more damage during the healing process.
---
It's a shame, but Bethesda has shown with their actions that they don't care about this game or the community that supports it. 
---
Ah great, my VATS is so good I can’t hide because I will spot myself every time. 
---
I feel your pain. They designed those doors the dumbest way possible.
---
Hey no problem! By the way there're two links.
---
Yes, but there's this "...now what?" 
---
I have the same amount of time in FO4, and as soon as I finished it I started a new character. Same in 3 and NV. Yes, this is an open world type game, but in similar games I've played there is stuff to do even after you max out. Star Trek Online is the one I've referred to in other comments. You can max out your character, but there is still stuff to do. Missions to replay, stuff to unlock, etc. 
---
Idk maybe it has to do with your luck stat, my best cap stash was 755 pre patch.
---
They need to just massively boost heavy damage, especially explosives, and also significantly increase their weight and their ammo weight so they're not something you use lightly. Make them something you pull out for the big stuff. Maybe add in a natural damage multiplier for use on boss type enemies. Scarcity is difficult to achieve in a game like this with trading, crafting, and world hopping. Easier to make it difficult to use and require prep time to load them out. 
---
What? Mothman eggs? I haven't even heard of those. Where do they spawn?
---
I love all the drama in this sub lately.
---
yea thats odd. I noticed my dmg lvls were fluctuating yesterday on everything. I am mutated so I thought it was related. 
---
yes you nerfed the only way of farming caps
---
now you are stucked to getting the 200from every vendor and then you CANNOT get more.
---
If you try to farm something, you can basicly play the game 1-2hours and then you are CAPPED.
---
This is a flawed design which just sucks to be honest.  
---
You shouldnt punish players for enjoying the grinding aspect of the game and allow them some way of still selling their junk or farming caps with another method!!!!
---
Roger that. Have fun out there in KH. 
---
Dude, you should make commercial for marshmallows. And starting fires.
---
Yeah. He jumped the gun and posted after reading the patch notes. I thought it was awesome myself after reading the notes, but later on when I was playing I realized that Bethesda screwed this up hard.
---
Juicehead didnt take the video down, but changed the title, but he did post a new video that addressed everything thats been going on.
---
I think its less a case of fanboyism and more a case of jumping the gun and wanting to believe that Bethesda was doing the right thing. (Which it almost seemed like they were up until yesterday. Srsly dont know what clown show they got to make this patch. (I suspect they farmed it out secretly)
---
I didn't know. Literally, the only good thing I got out of this game was joining reddit. So, I'll do that next time I guess?
---
no sorry I might have replied to the wrong comment, I am doing it from my messages and trying to multi task which I am not good at :)
---
Of course a game is going to get boring after you play 500 hours in the span of a couple months. Just about no one plays that much lol 
---
I Am Legend will become reality
---
After /u/bolsey made a stellar post with pictures of every CAMP plan available I decided to collect all of them. Naturally, I sunk a dozen hours and only had 5 left when the patch came, and now they are *significantly* easier to find and didn't receive a price hike like many of the other plans did... But oh well, at least those last few will be easy to find now!
---
You need a slogan to bring attention to something. 
---
Heh good luck with that.
---
Im honestly waiting till I get new headphones, Gamer Headphones this time, and then I am gonna try find people to play with
---
Should be ok now. The Xbox issue was resolved.
---
The FTC doesn't care that a game launched and is disappointing. It's hardly the first time it's happened and it won't be the last.
---
Besides the being part of a team part.
---
K bye.
---
Thanks for your helpful contribution 
---
Cheating.  It is plain dirty cheating and dirty cheaters should all be banned.
---
just by the mothman museum lots on the floor near the mothan statue
---
Hahahaha it was a great beta. But dont listen to bad talk bc the beta is a 6 week old platform and improvement have been made since that release. But omg it is awesome and playing with your friends is fun too!
---
Its so depressing what they did to my fav franchise of all time. Fallout was the only reason I owned an xbox. 
---
There are just no words
---
I hope Bethesda is paying attention and this sort of post motivates them to get their act together.
---
That is, if they're even capable of it. I'm not even sure anymore.
---
That is actually hilarious and awesome
---
thanks for looking into that  issue
---
600 in stash while 1500 on a character seems just wrong somehow....
---
&gt; Juicehead yesterday, minutes after the patch: Fallout 76 just released its best patch yet!
---
I saw this yesterday lol, like dude... really? 
---
Patching an obviously older version and then releasing it is not going unnoticed. I can't honestly think of a time a well known established developer has done such a thing. This is an event the gaming world will never ever forget.
---
My lever action that was 338 per shot that I grinded to get does nerfed damage... why even be level 130 if all your cool guns you EARNED are now shittier than a junkies shotgun
---
Agreeing to the ToS before playing probably hurts your chances of anything to do with the game itself.
---
Canvas bag  is a different story.
---
I can't even begin to ridicule their decision making without loosing it all together.
---
No. But thank you for your concern of the well being of my fo76 stuff while I'm away. You're the real MVP.
---
Your not wrong lol
---
Because instead of working on new content, they've been spending all this time fixing a broken game. It never should have been released in its original state, and they've essentially bled all goodwill they had because of it. 
---
If that’s the case why the fuck serve them clicks if they’re just copy-pasting our information anyway? You got a girlfriend there or something?
---
That was a different game, the one op is on about is a modded fallout 2, I'm sure some Russian guys are doing it
---
Now I'm sad. Because I realize that's exactly what they always say. 
---
thx nice work in searching :) personally i cannot find that info after Phallus 76 release .... but if its true the whole studio segment should be closed because this is what we call shitty work.
---
Yes I went through 10 cores yesterday and I played less than pre-patch. Makes no sense at all. Previous two weeks I've played A LOT and had 20+ cores. No reason I should go through half that in less 8 hours when 20+ lasted 2 weeks.
---
he wants a less derivatively racist slogan
---
Ahhh gotcha
---
TOO! Dont think headphones is going to make the game better. I play the game on a Dolby atmos system and yes it's good but it only improves sound not game replayability.
---
Absolutely, me too. Aside all the bugs, I have big problems with the economy. For an anti-social player like me the whole "Others can mod stuff for you" aspect doesn't work. I **refuse** to spend hours fast traveling around just to farm and sell stuff to vendors to get caps like some of you do and I'm broke. And the paid fast travel system means that if you're broke the game stops being enjoyable, I have to walk to the other edge of the map to do a quest, or at least until I manage to get caps along the way and fast travel.
---
Fast travel should be **free** (terms and conditions apply)
---
On the cancerous Epic store? No thanks. I'll wait till they release elsewhere.
---
Are you still planning on making an official post about the patch bugs today?
---
Bullshit. Stop generalizing people that disagree with you. I have every current console and a beast of a PC. I’ve played all the major releases and I still enjoy this game. I would play this game if it didn’t have the brand. I’d be a hell of a lot more forgiving of the bugs too lol. I like survival/base building games. I’ve bought some real stinkers but I’ve got 300 hours in this game and I actively enjoy it. Sure it can be shitty sometimes but it is what it is right now. And I think it’s fun. 
---
The community interaction from Bethesda is terrible and many things could have went better for sure. Just wait for Dying Light 2, you won't have a single regret. That game will fill all voids.
---
Elder Scrolls Online. Developed by almost the same company. There you have a shared bank and a personal bottomless bag for resources for all characters.
---
Just today I wondered why they should not implement it in Fallout 76:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alayox/crafting\_bag\_from\_eso\_an\_example\_of\_how\_resource/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alayox/crafting_bag_from_eso_an_example_of_how_resource/)
---
True, but you can always automate variables outside of normal numbers, by giving odd inputs to the code underneath in the engine. for example what happens if we pass in a larger then realistic value to X in relation to the output of Y. Now automating every possible situation is impossible, but you can catch some glaring issues with a wide net of test cases. This of course requires a very in sync QA team with the Devs. You don't find this very often in the wild as a lot of big companies tend to try and cut cost on QA testing by squeezing by with minimum resources or outsourcing to companies that will do the same. 
---
That being said I agree with you that automating unintended uses of a system is not possible in all situations. Although based on current server stability and performance issues I'm not sure what automated capabilities they have.
---
Come on, don’t tell the guy about our SECRET FUN FALLOUT 76 SUBREDDIT called r/fallout76safespace or he might go there and ruin it!
---
I mean no one in the community cares...
---
I agree with you its not that hard to get caps selling other stuff but i would like that this was on the patch notes, how many more changes there are that we already not known?
---
so true.
---
I honestly like the game but they removed the only source of caps (cap stash farms)  
---
So right now i sell to all the vendors, which takes about 20minutes of gameplay, then im playing something else.
---
such a bummer
---
This community is trash though.
---
:') This was incredibly kind of you, thank you for this sweet post!
---
I posted something similar earlier today. The nerf to damage does require more rounds to be fired but that does not fully explain the rate at which weapons are breaking. If the second bullet is only doing 25% damage than the first bullet then it should only damage the weapon 25% as much as  the first round.  May just have to revert to my old 1* instigating lever rifle. 
---
I will keep that game in mind I just downloaded red dead 2 and 7 days to die.
---
Entering a pipboy too quickly will freeze your character. You have to restart the whole game to get back in and wait for a considerable time
---
Resource nodes no longer respawn on a new server. Not sure if this was intentional or not but it sucks. 
---
Plans say they are unknown in the vendor inventory, but mark as known once in the pipboy. This happened with a water purifier for me. 
---
Trade slider no longer stops at 0 cost. If intentional this is an awful change. It makes trading with your team take 5x as long if you accidentally scroll past that zero. 
---
Bobby pin weight went up again. 
---
Bulk resources now need to be scrapped before use. This makes it hard to fix missile turrets and weapons and armor on the go if you have no stash near by to break down bulks. Some of us keep everything bulked for easy access to sell at vendors. 
---
Random occurrences of phantom damage or instant deaths with no enemies around at all. My team mate kept dying. I did not. I'd revive and theyd die again immediately. 
---
Hits on enemies dont register once again. This seemed to be fixed last patch and is broken again. Even melee attacks are not doing damage. 
---
No! FredGravy1997, a real life, unpaid player of the game makes the quests now. Make your own quests. Bethesda fired all its writers. FredGravy1997 and his bro ButtSecks14 are the new lead writers. 
---
Form a coalition to grow the largest corn farm in west virginia. That is your quest. ButtSecks14 is a visionary.
---
This type of mmo genre is basednon delayed self gratification, mmo dont start until end game image leveling on wow classic and no content at 60. Most people would complain even though they sunk in a 10p hours
---
I played yesterday and it was working. All my suits are fitted out.
---
Are you saying if I change it there’s no way to change back?
---
I read it all... did I misunderstand you?
---
Error: 404 response not programmed
---
&gt; level-5-creation melee weapon
---
... No idea what you mean there. But you seriously don't think it's a bug? Really...? You honestly think it's not a bug where over-repairing a weapon suddenly gives the weapon 20x more damage than before, and the damage gradually drops lower and lower as the durability degrades? It's 100% a bug, especially when it's not a feature or mechanic that was ever announced. This effect is in no way intentional.
---
Can some one post the article here? I dont want to give those Activists any clicks.
---
Good catch.
---
Nothing racist about making Fallout great again.
---
I don't think anyone would accuse you of attempting a legit debate when you think "stop crying" and "stupid" are strong, well reasoned retorts. Go hang out at r/fo76filthycasuals if you can't stomach people giving actual feedback to the devs and the player community.
---
Yeah, and?
---
maybe works similar to plants and mothman eggs ill try tomorrow and see.
---
You gotta be shitting me..
---
One always spawns on top of the watoga Civic center next to the pa spawn and helo/vertibird. It was part of my power core, vendor watoga run. Some other good mats too including ballistic fiber and adhesive.
---
Train station, se corner roof of high school, n to camp on roof, n to Phoenix, w to pa in middle of city, w and up the fire escape to roof of Civic center, e across bridge then n to where i mentioned above then back s. If you have marsupial, Bird Bones, and speed demon you can make the jump to the emergency services helipad. Either way into the emergency services, up the stairs to almost guaranteed legendary, and then up to roof for another core.
---
Except she hasn't commented on any of the threads that *really* matter, like the 5k+ thread today about how it's time for a leadership change. Whoever is in charge of Fallout 76 really needs to be removed from the project, and the new person needs to acknowledge how badly they've fucked things up so far and present a roadmap for unfucking it. We all know that won't happen, but if they actually want to turn it around, that's what it'd take - not a PR flack offering vague promises that someone is listening.
---
Hello Games did go dark for a while but did eventually deliver something that pleased a lot of people and unlike the other guy said they never really owned up however Bethesda have repeatedly lied to us since launch and n this case literally 2 steps forward and 3 steps back..... For the love of Christ they doxxed customers a few weeks ago....
---
It's not immediately apparent, but each of these doors has TWO power connection points.  The second one is usually imbedded above and inside the doorjamb.  So you just connect a trigger of some sort to the second power connector, like a pressure switch, and then the door will open from the inside as well.
---
r/foundthemobileuser
---
I cant find any heavy armor either. I have Robot and Combat arms and the Leather set but all before the patch.
---
Haven't played it. Why can't you progress?
---
Right there with you. An average of two disconnects per session, with loss of health items, weapons or even my whole camp, is just too much for me when Resident Evil 2 and Walking Dead Final Season are waiting.
---
We need private servers and mods. Let the community fix Bethesda's fuck up, as always.
---
My lever action tse broke yesterday after the patch and i was like wtf just happened? It was at 800 damage now its at 240 damage rating.
---
I went to repair it and it said i didnt have the items to repair it when i clearly did have more than enough to repair it! Somethings definatally fucking wrong here!
---
Yeah so you can only change 1 point per level, so it takes days or weeks to fully respec.
---
It wasn't massive making that one though. Still ubisoft. 
---
Super mutants especially.  They even yell ‘retreat’ which implies this was designed?  Assaultron legendary ran today.  The shame....
---
What he said.
---
RDR2 is amazing! Just don't go near the subreddit for that before finishing the **entire** storymode.
---
Same. On a break till we get it figured out 
---
Reaching out on this. u/JackpotjaieUK can you also send me a private message?
---
I do, pick up the cores from power armor. This isn’t my first rodeo. But the whole point of the thread was “what happened to them” and “where are they”. I already explained, I didn’t need the perks before. Perhaps that’s why they were changed. So I will add those perks as well. It’s no big deal. 
---
Everyone in this thread has been civil, you are the only asshole. If you don’t like the “crying and whining” why post? 
---
I bought a headlamp red tactical AFTER the update at MODUS terminal yesterday.
---
I've had this occur on Xbox -- but for me it only seemed to be when I opened the Pipboy too soon after loading in. My choices were to either log off and log back in and briefly wait for everything to settle or be killed (fast travel to somewhere if necessary) and let some random mob rip you to shreds. Upon respawning things were functional again.
---
Nice! I’ll have to check that out.  
---
Did CTD give you an STD?
---
Different experiences of the game, I suppose. I do hope you continue enjoying it, but for me that is quite impossible to do so in this state.
---
They need to care considering dlc will be free and they only making money on the atom ship. Of they dont keep us around they won't make any money. I have spent a lot if money on the atom ship. And if they want more of my money they need to get there cral straight 
---
A bit early to "out the dog down", look at Sea of Thieves or (God forbid)No Man's Sky... 
---
Not just Bethesda.... all "Triple A" titles. They're all doing this, but Fallout76 is probably the worse of them. Hell, I'm a Blizzard fanboy, but I won't even buy Diablo4 until I hear its not f'd up after all this "fallout" with Warcraft/HotS/Overwatch.
---
All these companies are acting like EA and we should treat them thusly until they stop trying to screw us, the customers.
---
if it appears after equipping something different / death or relog, then definitely not every time.   
---
Keep in mind that I did not use it all the time, just after a couple of times I heard about this bug, I thought that it was worth trying to lay out all ammos and take them back - and it worked. after that I shot several times at the mobs and realized that it was not worth it. at least for me.
---
I’m just speaking for stealth in general. The entire mechanic of stealth is broken on all levels. It’s an issue they have been well aware of, but again they don’t address it cause they literally don’t know how to fix it. Basically completely avoid stealth builds.
---
I don't usually carry stuff except my loadout. I can see that's not an option for hoarders, but there's really only a handful of worthwhile legendaries. so you don't need to worry about having 50 units free.
---
and if you can't kill something in 9 critical Dragon hits, then you might as well give up.
---
Is the fcc even open this year?
---
with the latest patch on PC the cross hair reticule now works in reverse when a gun is not sighted.  Meaning when you are moving it narrows to simulate "more accurate" and when you stop it widens to signify "less accurate".  This is the opposite of how it was before the latest patch.  
---
I believe it's a visual only thing as guns seem to have increased accuracy why standing still and not sighted, and  decreased while moving and not sighted, the only thing is the crosshairs reflect the opposite.
---
Full heavy leather set showed for me in Grafton and Charleston! 
---
There you go. All of you can unquit the game now.
---
Thanks for the confirmation on that, will compliment your account and PS4 usage when I report you to BGS for it.
---
This would happen to me. I had two bases when I went to build my camp in a new location. Not understanding why I had to buildings stored. 
---
Thanks for the update BGS
---
Yes we are! It's getting finalized by the Dev's right to ensure correct information.
---
Same here, sniper build. Have found explosive, and two shot, but never together. Still doing well 1 shotting mostly everything. It's all about that head shot. Too many people did builds around an OP setup and now complain cause they actually have to play the game. 
---
This is a solid positive in this patch. I also like that my mic activity reports lower left via text. I don't like people hearing me cough.
---
Well put have an upvote!
---
&gt;I agree. You don't have to release at the end of a Sprint. And you can release any story that is complete.
---
Unless you haven't gone full Agile because management can't get their heads around not having a waterfall approval process for releases. &gt;.&lt;
---
yeah figure out how to manage your dev team so you dont rush to merge builds together without testing
---
I won't say that I'm totally shelving the game.  There are many changes that I'd like to see, but with hitting high levels, finishing all of the quests (the ones I can find at least), I'm just bored with nothing to do.  I'll play a few Events, maybe a daily or two, gain a level, but after that I'm left wondering what I should do next.
---
I'm sure I'll login on occasion to level up or remodel my camp.  Don't get me wrong, I'm unhappy with the patches, unhappy with the bugs, the stash size, the nerfing of equipment, but at this point I need additional content.  They promised a "games as a service" model, that we'd get regular updates.  We haven't got any additional content, and yeah it's only 2.5 months.  I feel that they should have at least made some official announcement about new content.
---
I don't want more events, or dailys, I want story based content.  If you want to be a live service or "games as a service" then you need to be that.    
---
You still aren’t explaining what the actual problem is you’re complaining about. If stealth is broken please explain how. Seemed to work perfectly for me until yesterday. 
---
I neither duped or had the privilege of owning a TSE, and I agree completely. Their poor oversight has driven away players of all stripes.
---
Complete incompetence on Bethesda's and Zenimax's part. 
---
Windows must be pretty clean at your office.
---
I don't do the queen cause I don't want to crash but I can confirm the level 91 deathclaw runs from a fight. People have suggested that it behaves like a radstag and that it's probably not suppose to be there at. 
---
I have observed that if a legendary is among a mob it will run away and hide. The Super mutant variety will even cry out "Run Away". 
---
No Man's Sky has way more than two devs, and it took multiple years. 
---
I approve of him being a sport about it lol 
---
Scorched Queens loot table still drops bad legendaries! Been doing her since the patch please look into her! Shes the hardest encounter and should give good rewards!
---
I have a level 100+, a level 79, and a level 30 something. I’ve been here since launch. Got any other random justifications that you need to make to help you swallow the fact that people can like things you don’t like?
---
At least its being sorted and that's the main thing. 
---
Wait how are the dupers back?
---
"Isn't currently accepting trade requests" option would be nice too.
---
You are about to get a variety of fun responses.
---
Can you test what haplens when you apply it?
---

---
Because lul...lul never changes. 
---
Can confirm. Zilch.
---
Any chance of a "producer letter" style post so players can get some details on how the current state of the game came to be and what y'all are doing to make sure things improve moving forward? Not just talking about new content, but processes/procedures that will go in place to actually make sure builds aren't shipped broken like this, maybe why the team decided to allow existing characters on the upcoming survival servers etc. etc.
---
Because the "We're passing feedback" posts from the CM's are great, but they can only do so much and the lack of real concrete info on the what's and why's is deeply concerning.
---
Again, I'll reference Star Trek Online. Free to Play, though I bought it back in the day. I have almost 2000 hours in game on PC and Xbox, across multiple characters. New content every 6ish months. 
---
No. I wouldn't complain, because I would have beat the game and then started over with a new character. I ended 3,NV, and 4 thinking "that was a hell of a game. Time to start a new character!" The single player game would have ended, but I can go replay as a new character and make new choices to change the story.
---
Right?! This fixes *everything!!!*
---
Wii have a new idea now that the two shot guys are nerfed lets nerf the melee builds
---
I've been having issues with it since the last patch. I have the full perk, shadowed Armor, a silenced sniper, and two pieces of chameleon. Yet enemies always seem to come right to me after I snipe one enemy at near max range
---
Watoga station iirc
---
Writing the perks differently, your armor takes 10% of default condition loss pre-patch, and 40% post-patch. Hence 4x. 
---
That 10% is why White Knight was so good: Your armor broke 10x slower without it. Many people would have read it as closer to 2x.
---
Just about- I built my General Purpose Character (Big on Weight Reduction etc. for Grinding) around full auto assault rifles and with 6 points in commando and 2 in Demo Expert (upping Demo to 5 for SBQ nukes) I was getting the following Damage
---
TS Handmade: 158 damage 
---
Exp Assault Rifle: 129 damage (161 with 5 points in DE)
---
TSE Handmade: 342 damage (428 with 5 points in DE)
---
Post Patch with a respec to 9 points in Commando and no Demo Exp (because now the max 60% on the 20% of added explosive damage only amounted to 6 damage points on my TSE Handmade!) I'm getting:
---
TS Handmade: 98 damage
---
Exp Assault Rifle: 61 damage
---
TSE Handmade 106 damage
---
So my best weapon (which was OP because I wasn't even maxing out the perks for it, and needed a partial Nerf IMO) has now been cut down to literally 1/4 of it's previous damage. While I have a 3 star super sledge that does 252 without using any perks at all and I had to burn a bunch of perk points just to get that... and also since the patch I've had to dump an insane amount of ammo on a level 50 non legendary whatever (I'm almost level 150) multiple times totally at random and have started having my carry weights and damage stats also change for no apparent reason (heard that diseases are now really messing with stats both good and bad so I'm at the point of not being able to trust anything I build or use will give any consistent performance).  
---
It's enough to where after playing this game far more than I should have since it came out, and keeping a positive attitude that it will get better.. I'm now finding myself just not giving a shit and taking a big dislike towards Bethesda in general, which is Sad because I've been a Fallout fan for a Long Time.
---
I've installed today Fallout76 and played with my GTX 700 (2GB) and I have a lot of texture problems. How did you configure the game? Do you have the same problems than me?
---
Don't suppose you could sneak in the ability to name power armor.....
---
look at lucky hole mine, explore, find the secret passages in the mine. its a cool story there hidden.
---
And I just said I would play it. I really like it. I’d like it more without the bugs but I’m sure we’ll get there eventually. 
---
You should probably do a bit more reading in here about the issues that caused this blowback. The issues you just mentioned are the tip of the iceberg.
---
Required perk investments, ammo, high DR but a low ER unicorns to name some.
---
And then that's only talking plasma (pistols). Laser pistols are not only quite weak, even worse is how fast the break. So lasers are completely off the table anyway.
---
I got level 40 explosive ultracite laser, I just looted it like a day before patch, and now it's so great it's been dropped off the loot table! 
---
Because it's ultracite, I have only about half of the mods so I don't yet have sniper barrel for it to increase damage, and it does whopping 28 damage. Pre nerf, it was 36. It has high clip, about 30, and I need 2 clips to kill most enemies.(this is post nerf, as I tested it and other guns I had on me quickly) And it breaks down really fast. I have TS level 50 laser pistol, but prior to nerf, I got tired of trying to use it anyway, because it's so weak and wears out so fast you can't barely use it anyway. Only usable laser would be TSE, and that got nerfed really hard. Plus you'd have to repair it constantly and no one does that. Maybe you could try to use AA-E laser rifle but really, it's still bloody weak, and wears off so fast.
---
Level 25 TS handmade does 56. I have perks for both pistols and rifles, maybe +30% both, as well as little for explosives, level 2 I think that's now 30% too. Level 50 TS plasma does 42&amp;46. Haven't tried it in practise yet, I think it's already better than my handmade. But level 50 TS handmade is probably better.
---
If stuff like that were feasible and useful, people would do it. Oh and techncally, because of the rifle perks, you would use plasma rifle anyway. Everything weights, though plasma rifle doesn't weight that much. But energy weapons don't have piercing effects from magazine like ballistic guns.
---
But hey, maybe in future Bethesda will make energy weapons worth something.
---
Thanks, you guys have a very delicate fanbase.
---
There's no upside for them coming here. 
---
Constant weapon repairs killed the game for me. I can't stand any game with such aggressive weapon durability.
---
Watoga Railroad bot had them yesterday.
---
Hey op with that attitude its bound to backfire. If they dont fix the bugs most people will eventually stop playing. Then guess what happens? The game gets shut down for lack of users. Then you'll care. 
---
have you looked into the disappearing items? several reports in this very sub of people having items just vanish.
---
hahah stupid is a real thing, its a actually word, even thou the PC culture thinks it cannot be used it can, and to me this is stupid, so keep ranting, I am out...looking into the mirror and cry about your game problems repeatedly, you will get sick off it after while too
---
Agreed. FO76 is an utter disaster, and the idiots at Bethesda are doing nothing to correct their complete failure of a launch. The patches are a joke. What we're seeing is a special kind of stupid, and the only way to move beyond what's happening is for people at Bethesda to get fired and replaced by competent managers, etc.
---
There is no excuse for a company with Bethesda's resources to make these mistakes.
---
Same.  Full Heavy and Sturdy Leather at pretty much every Responder Vendor.  
---
&gt;There you go. All of you can unquit the game now.
---
Why, because they fucked up so badly they somehow managed to release a patch alongside and older, broken build of the game?
---
I mean, I want to know how this even made it through certification for Microsoft/Sony, because this is a hilariously stupid mistake.
---
Very strange, i did see " red tactical headlamp " in MODUS's inventory after the patch yesterday :/
---
Yeah, ignore the fact that bethesda has responded to many of these posts. 
---
Fucking idiot.
---
How so?
---
I want to love this game, but the state of this game for most of its players is dead. All of us have been continuing to push on , no matter how bad it gets and ignoring it’s flaws because we want this game to be good. But they’ve removed any hope of having a decent weapon that doesn’t break in 20 minutes and nuke launches are so tedious and underwhelming they are almost not even worth it. And now I hear the next content update won’t be until March? Why won’t the dev team get their heads out of their asses??
---
Do some research. There are a bunch of quitting posts that have be downvoted into the ground.

Yeah I found Graham last night and he had diddly squat. Seemed like same as before

You guys really gotta stop pretending that you’re speaking for everyone. You’re not.

Ah I’ve never been to Watoga, I’ve only just entered the divide. Thanks though :)

\*pass that along to the team (Jokes aside, I'm sorry I sound like such a broken record. It's hard to give more varied responses that convey that.)
---
Completely obliterates the point of perk card packs and makes it so 1 bad perk choice ruins a character.  No.  
---
If anything crafting, lockpick, repair and hacking perks just need to be 0 cost passives as everyone just swaps to them as needed anyways.
---
Do you want to fix your issue or do you want to just keep having your tantrum and making up problems to be mad about before they even happen dude?
---
And yet, this comment looks almost the same as the one you are criticizing. It seems like you make a fine fit for this subreddit.
---
Reposting from an earlier comment I made, because still relevant.
---
So the thing about scorchbeasts that makes them really annoying to kill is that they abuse every game mechanic possible, and honestly aren't that much tougher than other enemies on a basic level.
---
1. they fly, and this is a big one, because damage drop over distance savagely lowers your damage output against them, if you have a rifle with 200 range, and the scorchbeast is 600 Bethesda meters away you are dealing \~1/4 damage (200/(200+600))
---
2. armor mitigation is based on damage done, so your 137 damage rifle, I'm going to round it to 150 and assume 150 damage resistance on the scorchbeast for math reasons, would be dealing half damage, same formula as range, BUT range applies first, and although I can't confirm for certain, it appears that the damage resistance stacks against your reduced damage, take the 1/4 from earlier and your damage drops to 37.5, which the armor reduces by \~1/5 instead of 1/2, meaning damage drop off stacks insanely fast against them when they are flying.
---
3. their hitboxes are awful, their wings only have hitboxes from their shoulder to elbow, the rest takes no damage, combine this with their erratic movement and they are very hard to deal consistent damage to in the air, and crippling their wings without concentrated fire or some other perk that simply breaks their limb instantly is something of a pipe dream. Their head has a similar thing going on
---
4. visual audio interference, do I need to explain why their screaming is the worst
---
All this adds up to make them inordinately difficult to kill in the air. But the thing is, as soon as they land you can walk over and shoot them in the face point blank with impunity and they die in 30 seconds without any particular weapon, build, or strategy, I've killed them in less time with a pool que, this is also true when they get frozen mid air and you can walk under them and shoot them while they are static. Their only slightly tougher, if not, than a high end super mutant, and I would rate them less tanky than a behemoth or mirelurk queen, but those are huge, easy to shoot, and don't hang out as far from you as possible. Add to that the fact their melee and other ground attacks aren't that powerful, and you get a very annoying enemy that if the first thing they do when the spawn is land you don't have any issues, but if they decide not to it's absolute hell. 
---
**Replyshare**
---
Once again, something was only said once enough people complained.
---
I really do hope so. I dreamed of a game like this since fallout 3. But having to log in and out several times a hour because of a glitch it's ruining it. 
---
The end game is boring as hell and PvP is no fun at all.
---
I agree with you, but in a slightly rephrased way. 
---
By making an MMO Bethesda basically reached out to a younger audience, and indirectly to a less employed audience for whom the title cost is more of a sticking point than to us older geezers who have jobs and who honestly couldn’t care less if it’s $60 or $80. So I get (and you’re right) this matters to many people who are on this game. 
---
What I’d rephrase your point to is “a cheaper early access marked title would be **one way** to communicate to the audience that this is a continued dev post release thing, and result in them setting expectations accordingly (and sidestep all the bad juju).
---
I’d argue it’s not the only way though. Have a walk through IKEA and look at how they communicate. 
---
We do X that you’re not used to. (Expect you to assemble shit yourself, for example). **This is why**. This is why it’s good. This is why we do it, and it’s why it’s good for you too. 
---
They bring you along for the journey. And if you do that, you can achieve the same goal even without reducing price (in case that isn’t an option due to how much effort it takes to get to launch day to begin with).
---
If I was king of the making Fallout 76 universe, I’d follow the same road Todd did, but communicate much more vigorously about how this titles development and growth will happen over time, why it’s best that way, why shipping a subset early is best, and invite people to make a more informed decision (as well as building up better credibility and trust with my audience in the process). 
---
Haha... 3 fixes
---
I hear you, but this is typical.  Players get much more vocal when they are angry.  And kids who are angry really don't want to hear anything constructive, they wanna throw a tantrum and get validation for their feelings... which posts like this do not achieve so prepare to be down-voted into oblivion.
---
But there are some constructive posts that get through, I think.
---
Also, people not angry at Bethesda aren't in here, they are playing the game.
---
I have played since about a week after launch, and since I have limited time to play I just hit lvl 60 about half an hour ago. 
---
I have also been stuck in a loading screen for about ten minutes, and the only reason I haven't just closed the application is that I got distracted by Reddit. 
---
I actually like the game despite its many, *many* flaws, but damn it makes it difficult to stay on sometimes. 
---
You have to scrap the 'bulk' junk and then you can use it for crafting etc.
---

I went through an episode once where we accidentally deleted the entire file system of a headless HP UX environment. That was fun. I think that should go at the top of my resume...

But it's not the game he promised himself deep down in his cockles, maybe even his inner cockles....the sub-cockle region!

How about fusion cores I have 80, at this point I’m just giving hem free to low levels.
---
Dunno about everything else, but this one I downvote 
---
yea it looks like they moved on New Zealand after 76 release :D no this is just thing to remember for all bethesda future games :) aka no more dosh for you Todd.... no more
---
100% of the people who no longer play, quit
---
I believe it's the the lucky hole mine. It's a bit tricky, go past the door with the touch panel lock on your right side and take a left turn kinda hidden in a crack in the wall. This path leads to a room with a cult follower's costume. On that path there are some vines growing on the wall in the tunnel with another path behind it with the creature.
---
So you should be able to go from shotgun specialization to melee specialization just by swapping out a few cards. 
---
I don’t see how that’s dumb to not allow perk swaps 
---
Not if you are in California, you can still bring a class action
---
That's not a Doxx, that's a massive mistake. There's a huge difference.
---
Yeah, its got to be rough for them :/
---
Fix V.A.T.S!!! Shots sometimes don’t even fill your critical meter. 33 luck no longer lets you chain criticals if using critical savvy.
---
You’ve screwed enough builds up already. Let’s not let a bug break another.
---
Lol. No need to gun a concept down just on account of a recent failure to realise it.
---
I think your choice of a joking subject is deadeye accurate.
---
Good day to you, mister!
---
I've already called law enforcement to block the road off, and have SWAT on standby.
---
Not even sure about playability
---
U/BethesdaGameStudios_ you guys really need to lay it all out on the table and make an open letter to the community about how you failed them with fallout 76 and you’ve gone past the point of being able to redeem yourselves.
---
A decision, that in hindsight, I also should’ve made the moment I realized that they added dragons to Fallout. Because Skyrim. 
---
Just bring your bowie knife to an Experimental MIRV fight. You'll be fine
---
Other stuff has been showing up with atom shop tags- looks like part of the buggy patch dumpster fire.
---
Snowflakes are the ones that melt down at the thought of other people having a different opinion.
---
I've been trying to get rid of him for years
---
I just hit the wall today with the last "patch', been playing minimum two hours per day since beta. Beth has destroyed Fallout. 
---
I want the legendaries I happen to have on my mind when the SBQ dies,  WTF BETHESDA &gt;:(
---
I can't talk for others but I got my $60 worth.
---
If you don't like the game don't play it. If you like it play it.
---
Bethesda will make decisions based on who plays and who doesn't. If no one plays then they will shutdown the game and that will be that.
---
If people keep playing then they will continue doing what they are doing now.
---
I still play it and will play it for the foreseeable future. Do I see a need to justify that decision, not really but here goes.
---
I enjoy the game and play it because above all else it helps me relax after work. I play it like I play stardew valley. 
---
I plant a few things, hunt a few things, cook a few things.
---
Tweak my CAMP a little. Get all my power armour sets out and admire them and put them back because I am not a PA player. I just collect them but use my excavator PA for farming.
---
Go out and kill things for loot. Go out and farm resources and in March I will do a little PvP and get killed a few times and maybe kill others a few times.
---
I also join random events with random players.
---
If I am the only person in the world playing this game after this week then that is fine, I will play it until they shutdown the server.
---
Not at all, I'm mostly amused at the depths of this kind of incompetence. I don't think I've ever see a developer, much less a AAA developer, push out an update that is for an *old* build of the game and rolls back all kinds of existing fixes.
---
This is a first for me, and I've been playing MMO's and online games for decades. Maybe I'm forgetting about something, but after the dumpster fire the game's been since launch watching Bethesda continue to make unforced errors and make things worse is depressing.
---
I'm not even playing due to the issues, I'm just on the sidelines hoping that they can get their shit together and start delivering the kind of quality that players deserve.
---
Your decision would be more impactful if you had to decide on crafting bonus to ammo vs just maxed at rifle perks 
---
Fallout 76 is not an MMO buddy. 
---
It's a multiplayer light survival adventure action game. 
---
An immidiate clue is the lack of monthly subscription fees, a limited loot pool, and the fact that it was never promised or advertised as an MMO. 
---
Fucking internet. 
---
You're right. Removing that last straw with unbreak the camel's back :P
---
Certification is really only for compliance. Make sure button prompts are for right platform. Make sure the game doesn't corrupt the OS. Make sure achievements work (which often is ignored). Etc.
---
Got 20 if your still looking
---
Keep up the good work! 
---
By the time the game shuts down people who enjoyed the game will have moved on to the next big thing. 
---
Actions speak louder than words.
---
Just do it.
---
Yes. You just have to scrap them. Collect the bulk junk items you need, go to a workbench, and scrap them. Not using "scrap all" but just selecting one type and pressing whatever the scrap button is on your platform.
---
Sidenote: I do not understand why people bulk their junk unless they are trying to sell it.
---
It does not reduce the weight of the junk (except for lead), and it uses up plastic. You can test this for yourself if you'd like. 
---
Rise up gamer
---
I don’t know much about the details but I’m pretty sure it was meant that the CAMP duping was being exploited.  Like putting 50 turrets outside Golf Club for example.
---
Sorry but gotta disagree. 
---
As someone who only buys maybe two games a year I live by the dollar per hour mindset. When I pick up a game it has to last me the course of half a year at least. 
---
I don't buy games often because I only buy games I know will be worth the cost and offer value to me in return.
---
It's not so much about dollar to hour for me. It's more hour/value. 
---
My dream job would be a vide game idea guy or a film idea guy, thank you :)

I respect your decision, and while I also was hurt by this last patch, I will most likely leave this game no matter what happens. It’s a combination of hope, enjoyment, and perseverance and I believe many in the community hold the same. I’ll see you back in Appalachia soon hopefully friend, and if not, I’ll catch you in the wasteland. 
---
I hope you’re not bothered by me tagging you a few times today. Im hoping you are able to communicate the frustration of this subreddit to whoever is over the dev team. Today isn’t a “normal” level of angry players, this is the worst I have seen it.  The worst part is that so many of these problems could’ve been avoided if a reasonable amount of play testing had been done before this patch was released. The quality control must improve. 
---
More people need to ask for this.
---
Don't forget consoles though! :) 
---
Because your talking about different guns with different stats.  The legendary traits are percent bonuses onto of those base stats.
---
The other versions of SS supported Xbox.  Haven't checked the new one yet.
---
in fact they said that before release :DD "sometimes its just doesn't work" Todd Howard on Phallus 76 release :D i was so stupid... i didn't see that coming :/
---
I'm sure they will be addressing this shortly. Right after about a billion useless updates to the Atomic Shoo.

The nerf to Demolition was a shock and not expected.  It took my TSE weapons down to just a tad above a TS weapon.  I agree a nerf was needed and when I calculated the anticipated nerf from the announcement earlier this month, I figured the results would be acceptable, but I did not anticipate the Demolition perk nerf. This was too much and I hope Beth will reconsider especially since the explosives weapons are rather putrid as well with this nerf.  Please reconsider taking the Demolition perk card back to its original level.
---
That’s a stupid idea.  You want to be locked into one play style?
---
I'm getting fired from a game I pre-ordered and paid $200 for great
---
All i can say is it’s a good start that has sooo much potential in a coop world, if only they’d focus more on that instead of pvp
---
How’s this considered a nerf by talking about making game build decisions more impactful
---
I noticed it as well on Xbox one not sure what caused it assuming some coding in the new patch.
---
Thank you for your hard work! If you ever need regression testing I can help for free :)
---
The servers lagging could cause damage that you don’t realize you’re taking on.
---
Serious question, how can y'all support this game still?

Yeah, I know it's not for generic bugs usually but it's just frustrating seeing how poor some of the patches for AAA games are while still getting through. I've worked on a number of smaller titles over the years and we've frequently had builds denied certification for pretty trivial things, having to go so far as to have the developer/publisher aggressively negotiate with Sony for a day 1 patch waiver because the game was denied certification due to one lingering Japanese character in one sub-menu for a non-essential NPC or something trivially stupid.
---
Where did I say a larger team makes a better game? Or that the larger team should be firing out updates quickly? I'm speaking more so in terms of budget and size of the team overall. I understand Brooke's Law. 
---
So, the mistake I was making, was attempting to use the "scrap all", which does nothing. You literally have to scrap one bulked set of a material at a time, close the scrap screen, check your junk, and it's there in raw form. whew!
---
So it’s stupid because you can’t comprehend making build decisions?
---
Yeah, this is a huge positive but the fact that this patch really set back the last two patches is a real kick in the nuts. I mean I have to scrap my bulk items to use them out of my stash. If this patch would have not messed up things that they already fixed the whole community would have been much more positive about it.
---
&gt;general putdown for anyone that complains about any subject.
---
Same problem with same item here too
---
There are some ski racks outside and shelves inside at the raider vendorbot that usually have some swords on them-- it's pleasant valley ski resort
---
Great suggestion! I'll make sure and pass it on to the devs!
---
The fact that they haven’t shut down the servers to fix everything THEY fucked up yesterday is mind blowing to me. 
---
If they would have accidentally gave everyone unlimited junk, or 3x damage they would’ve fixed it in the blink of an eye. 
---
So why have those perks at all then?
---
The mutation issue also needs to be covered... 
---
I upvoted you and downvoted OP.
---
I hear what you are saying, games take time to get good... but if that is what you are saying, then they should have waited to release it, lol
---
Link to the new sub please, good sir?
---
How about fire a few of them since the shit they're putting out is exactly the opposite of what the community is constantly asking for, and hire some more fucking devs to fix this game. Its honestly bull shit at this point. Im tired of sticking up for this game when you have zero quality control over it. If you're community manager isn't it your fucking job to correspond what it is the community wants with the teams working on this game? When has anyone asked for a fucking princess bed? When the fuck did anyone ask for you to nerf the only perks in the game that make it playable in the first place? Wouldn't want us repairing our guns that break every 3 gun fights too easily because we'll run out of shit to do if we're not constantly trying to find the shit we need to repair the shit we need. Next patch updates: introduced 10 new items to the atom store theme is "Absoluely Not Post Apocolyptic in any Way". How can you all be so fucking oblivious.

End of this week, early next week is the current target.
---
Yeah, you probably had a lot of people not attacking. I dropped a nuke and about 8 of us dropped her pretty much as quickly as before. The nerfs are fine, coming from a TSE Rifle user 
---
I know. They should too. I was just presenting a counter-point cause there's a ton that were downvoted to hell.

The links I provided weren't even comprehensive. I just picked the first 3.

You aren’t wrong. But what made you think that

OP is talking about the keypad being on the inside of the wall. So essentially you're using a password to get out of the house. They need to reverse the side the keypad is on or make 2 versions of it.
---
Yeah except most of them aren’t even complaining about issues they’ve actually experienced. Most of them are just parroting the same exact shit and acting all righteous about it. 
---
"slept for 7 hours and have over 100 men..."
---
Well if that isn't the definition of public relations 
---
I did the math earlier, the difference between a minigun dealing 14 damage and a gatling gun dealing 79 is that it takes 25 bullets from the gatling gun to exceed the damage of 500 rounds of minigun against an enemy with 100 armor, and a minigun dealing 28 and gatling gun doing 158 the difference against an enemy with 55 armor is still 500:42, and that comparison dramatically favors the minigun as the armor is less than the gatling gun's damage reducing the value of that armor by a huge margin.
---
That is why TSE was OP, multiplying your damage by 4 reduces armor effectiveness by a factor of a bit less than 4, meaning you deal close to 16 times more damage in best case where enemies still have more armor than the damage of your gun, and at worst it's still about 6-8 for most weapons
---
can you have them revert these dumb ass nerfs as well?
---
I only wish i could have interacted with them fully in-game. But yeah, agreed with the voice acting and storyline for the free states 
---
Thanks for the update. Just be more careful next time.
---
The only time they have ever offered compensation is when they were getting threatened by lawsuits.
---
Bethesda has definitely burned its fan base with this one. That being said, I'm not giving up yet, simply taking a break. With Metro Exodus, Rhe Division 2, Escape from Tarkov, and anthem coming out, I have stuff to play. 
---
The last patch added some minor content, but nothing much. I got the ultracite plans fro Taggertys terminal in fort defiance. That killed maybe 20 minutes because I walked there. 
---
See you in a few months FO76!
---
also on a serious note, mutations are randomly not working from time to time. 
---
So, we aren't in favor of "act now, due process later?"
---
Did two devs just downvote this, or does someone only read the title?
---
Sorry for the time delay but these are the ones I got so far

TS weapons were basically double damage, which crapped almost every legendary damage perk.  Even now it's what, 20% bonus against everything ?  While specific damage ones are only 30%.   Same for explosive, should have been a flat number like in fo4 because it makes the gun aoe.  Folks are going insane on the sub for them bringing those in line with the other legendary damage traits.
---
Same. RIP Appalachia. I would of loved to play this game had it been created properly.
---
**PS** \- Miami is looking DANK, but it still is Bethesda. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtAjvtJhf8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPtAjvtJhf8)
---
thanks
---
I’m referring to the endless stream of posts speaking for “the community” all over the place. Obviously. 
---
My heart sank as i learned the details of the camp mechanics. All i wanted when this game was announced was the  ability to build big settlements with other people ,and defend them or take them from others. 
---
&gt; Also, there's a +15 hp per team member thing going on if wearing a superhero outfit, which are conveniently on sale at the atom shop for 800 atoms. You can get one of the outfits in game, but it's a fairly long questline.
---
despite so many dismissing this away, they are going directly against their promise of "Micro transaction will be cosmetic only, they will not affect game play." Yes, it's not that much HP. Yes, it's for a limited time only. and Yes you can get an item that does similar from a questline - but that doesn't matter, they have directed contradicted their promise and IMO that is the start of more and more atom store "limited time perks" when you buy things.
---
I have stoped playing since the last patch because of the lack of content. I understand that they have to fix a LOT until new content arrives. Reading this makes me a bit sad, but give them time. I am sure if they keep working on it, it will be a good game in a few month, but I also understand that some people wont wait to long.
---
Yeah. This game is absolute garbage. No enemies in sight then from 50 miles across the map you get hit by an ememy or fuckin 3 scorchbeast spawn at once.
---
These are things more people need to be saying but we live in a shelter snowflake society and nobody wants to own up to their mistakes or hear the truth.
---
A good and valid point, thank you.
---
I am aware of that, the point is that the stat bonuses  should make the gun with them have better damage period but it doesnt unless you count the 3 more damage the handmade has. Even a non legendary handmade has less damage than a non legendary hunting rifle both with hardened receivers, the bonus stats should make the handmade far superior  in all aspects but 3 damage isnt that.
---
Ah everywhere I just looked there was empty, a lot of people around on my server tonight.
---
Thanks for the tip, I’ll remember it for later :)
---
okay mr expert developer.
---
I definitely agree with the idea that adding so many plans to vendors ruins the whole grinding/trading aspect of the game. And I mean, considering how heated this sub has been just in the past day alone, especially with how many people have said they’re done with the game, It’d be hard to think that there won’t be a lot of non-bug changes in the next patch (which I’ve seen is supposed to be coming by the end of this week/early next week). I’m not gonna get my hopes up, but I think this whole situation could be a big wake-up call for the devs to get their shit together. At least it should be
---
I love how you copied the comment and then asked them to delete it. Hilarious.

Lolz

I can read can you?

You wrote and I quote
---
It’s not the levels you should worry about, it’s the difference in gear. You’ll have a good buff and he will be nerfed. He will likely have way better gear though.
---
You said  that levels don’t matter it’s the gear. good gear buff will nerf his gear.
---
I asked you to prove your hypothesis against what the OP said.
---
Unless of course you meant to say anyone opponent taller then you will be better geared, 
---
WHY say 2 mutually exclusive things?
---
They nerfed a good franchise and now it’s shit 
---
That's an execution issue, not a communication issue. The build is fucked, I'm not arguing otherwise. It's fucked on a level that surpasses just about anything I've seen in other games short of deleting itself (which happened to a Japanese MMO that released a  build that was corrupted and then found out their backups were also corrupted and they no longer had a game...).
---
But Bethesda are out and about despite that. We may not be getting tons of *good* information, but the CM's are active in threads acknowledging feedback/bugs. It's better than radio silence, which is largely what we saw from Bungie at this point in Destiny 2's life. I was making the point that there are a lot of similarities between the two games, but that at least Bethesda seems like they're trying...at least on the communications front. Even if their trying is essentially fucking up spectacularly.
---
That's great. 
---
If you didn't cheat I feel for ya, if you did you have nothing to complain about, I'm also a cheater by the way.

Oh god not another one of these post

You didn't use a period either.

---
Can we also get a respec option?  When you drastically destroy many perks people have invested again its really not fair to ask them to wait weeks or months to level up and fix a problem that was created by you. 
---
&gt;Lose everyone when Anthem comes out. 
---
Ah yes, the already messed up Destiny clone by EA. How could that possibly go wrong?
---
You'll grab cod? You're complaining about weapon rebalancing and grabbing CoD? 
---
You may want to reconsider that choice. 
---
The game launched incomplete. Half the maps are assets flips. 
---
And gun balance? Get used to mastering a new class of weapons every 3 weeks. The game launched and assault rifles were broken, they killed at close range quicker than SMGs did, the actual 3 hit or 5 hit kill range or whatever unintentionally beat out SMGs. 
---
Then LMGs got a buff.... And I loved that. Close range, mid range, using it at long distance and getting reliable kills with just a few absurdly accurate shots..... Then being able to just spam ammo at a wall to get a kill as well 
---
Then they added that new hacker class and I bailed. Completely fucked any balance. 
---
This cod entirely fucked up anything good that was BLops.

The fucking entitlement coming of this post is awful.

Huh, a couple weeks ago I randomly remembered this game. I couldnt think of the name at the time, and forgot to google it. never played it myself but it sounded interesting. thanks for reminding me of the name, and apparently not to play it.

Repairing weapon isn’t a problem.

---
Scrapping Weapons for Material, you’re telling me there isn’t a single screw in these weapons?! 
---
Andddddddddd how long loot takes to respawn. 
---
I have 2 hours to play, I can’t be repairing my rifle 30 minutes out of that 2 hours. I’ll hit mods for 35 mins, rifle will break. Must farm for 35 minutes than repeat process until materials are dry and I don’t want to find new farm locations.

FUN FACT: Bethesdas terms of service state that "you are not allowed to EMBARRASS another player"

So ya. Dont embarrass anyone or you might get banned too

Welcome to the internet. Lol.

I love reading about the fragility of the modern game.
---
Ah, you're sniping with a handmade?  That's a little different, as it's not actually a sniper rifle.  How many bullets can you fire in the time of 1 axe swing?
---
If you want to one shot enemies, you shouldn't be using a fast firing weapon.  The fact that you can't one shot with it now doesn't suggest that it's broken now, the fact that you could previously one shot with it suggests it was broken before.
---
If you want to snipe, look at either the hunting rifle or the gauss.  Or potentially look at a Instigating handmade.  I don't think the instigating handmade would quite put you into oneshot territory on max level supermutants, but it'd probably put you in two shot territory.  Which is balanced for a semi-auto rifle.
---
crafting and lockpick hacker etc should be passive or a separate cost like a passive cost based on your special so 2 different costs same special value
---
I will be obliviously completing the story before i look for anything on the net. The way a game should be played 😁
---
100% Agree. *comes here to bitch about people bitching about things that are broken* /hypocrite
---
*downvotes you for calling them out on it* /just like everyone else
---
fuuuuuck that. People have a legitimate claim to be pissed about this shit game. It is literally the worst quality game I've ever paid money to play - and it's from one the best game studios in the world. I was literally just playing it and the SBQ wouldn't take damage, couldn't craft from bulk items anymore, I was overencumbered from the hundreds of bobby pins I decided to keep instead of dropping, and my game crashed before that because I had the audacity to open my Pip Boy after ONLY standing there for 20 seconds waiting for the shit to load. Something has to be done. If you have no solutions other than to trumpet that you're leaving because you're sick of whining then fucking just goooooo. 
---
It's fine when there is a neutral - optimistic view of the game and feedback can be shared back and forth on a weekly or monthly cadence, but you can see the cracks when disaster strikes. 
---
That's what there trying to work out
---
There are so many good games out now, and coming up, that I  find it hard to log in and play. I had such high hopes too. Got friends to play (and that makes me most upset). Bethesda banked on their complacency and low effort being covered by a lack of competition and modding community.
---
The former is no longer valid and they are being passed by in the genre, and the latter is no longer able to fix their mistakes.
---
I'll keep an eye on it, and hold out hope that maybe by the end of the year it can be a game my friends and I can enjoy regularly. But I'm not holding my breath.

urbandictionary always has people trying to sneak in their own definitions. there's a reason why the one I linked is the first result.

It means I have to spend ability points on things that should NOT by any means cost me permenant ability points! Sure, why would I not spend 3 points on hacking when I already need about 500 bullets to take a super mutant out? Why would I even consider investing these points in the (nerfed) perks that can help me battle the ridiculous durability loss of items?
---
Comeon man get outta here
---
Not sure on melee but I’m certain my Plasma Rifle damage was cut in half....
---
I eventually found heavy combat legs at one vendor and sturdy combat arms at another after several server hops.
---
They are still random.
---
Hey but It would great though if it slid both ways. Because the vendors carry so little (even after I clean him out of springs and acid) that I usually have to get down to single digits.

Well there is a reason.

You don't have any core efficiency perks.

"Just because something was broken as fuck and invalidated several core perks doesn't mean it should be fixed."

Heh, sorry, I was just saying. I love RDR and I do like Fallout 76 (in fact I find more fun, bugs in all, in FO76 than I do in the online portion of RDR. I'm willing to go back to RDR2O once they add in some good open world stuff. What's frustrating is several people have suggested some really cool stuff and they've ignored it for more PvP modes (which they have plenty of) so far. The open world feels empty and there isn't even much to work for (give me more horses to buy and hell, more stables to put them in for example). And there's not much open world activity. At least FO 76 has a pretty good story to work through that for me will justify my money (I don't need it to have constant end game but I always planned on playing it for the quests as a SP anyways, I was resentful it was an MP. But so far it seems fun to play as an SP game). RDR2O has a few story missions but then that's it. And I dont' want to have to keep replaying the same missions over and over and over again. Hell, even the few open world activities all seem to be the same few.  It has potential and I hope R* starts adding open world stuff (and sooner than they did GTA cause it took forever for them to start focusing on open world activity on GTA). And their proposal for further anti griefing measures is the first ones they've done that make me feel that they actually might not want griefing (at least not in RDR).
---
Yep, I'm trading this game and Fallout 4 tonight to get Resident Evil 2. I don't expect to get much, but whatever. Something is something.

One week for a 'hotfix'? My God...

Also, this fucking title reads as "I am interested in this game so everyone else is too!!!!"

Who's even downvoting this comment? It's meant be a joke. People on this sub are as bittqer as viniger.

Just because it's currently the popular result, doesn't make it the best or most correct...
---
Also remember to sell your 200 caps of items first, because the vendor will get ~25% of the caps you spend back available to buy more things from you, so you can actually get a good amount of caps back and have a good place to sell junk.
---
Nah we like the perk card swapping more importantly there’s no respecification system. So if you fall asleep on your controller and picked the wrong card basically you hindered your character. I personally don’t have time to make a new character every time I screw up my build and take it all the way up to 50. I don’t think anyone does that’s has responsibilities outside the game. Can’t pay the bills with caps unfortunately.

This happen to me last night. I dropped a gamma gun but it stayed in my inventory. Then I look up and three people are shooting gamma guns at each other (low lvls as whitesprings) I realised it duplicate the gamma guns. The area was just nuked so idk I think it was the lag. After 2 mins the gamma gun I "dropped" disappeared.

so thats what happened. fuck that. i didnt have a red lamp for my Exc or 45 yet

same, there is something addicting to building your own base in a game.  I would forgive the glitches if they can figure out how to put more players per server and allowed multiple players to create city's.  that is what I was originally expecting. a way for people to create a kingdom to rule the post apocalyptic world and create wars between groups. now that would be a game.
---
N.A.G. ? 
---
Isn't "Twisted Panties" a mutation?
---
Here is the thing.  It's true that ff you spec'd everything right the TSE weapons we better then melee.  BUT, the sad truth is that EVERY OTHER WEAPON SUCKED.  Now they have brought the TSE weapons down to the useless level with everything else.  This leaves just melee as the stand out damage dealer.  I fear they will again "balance the game" by nerfing melee.  This would not leave them a viable product in my opinion.  
---
As is, we have a melee game with a cap grind meta and daily cap grind limitation.  So essentially progression is now based on the number of days you log in and do your daily cap grind.  If this is the game they intended to make, they should have made it freemium on Iphones.
---
Whose fault was it? Bethesda's incompetence caused tickets to be viewable by everyone. It's either malicious or inept. Pick your poison.
---
Just take the patch back and fix alllllllll the issues before introducing it at all fkn NOOBS
---
&gt;At least No Man's Sky owned up to their mistakes and made their game immensely better and that is a two person Dev team.

Lack of end game is one thing, but Bethesda handled literally everything wrong with this launch. It was a PR disaster. FF14 sucked at launch. As did ESO. Granted, the revamp for FF took about 3 years, the ESO revamp took about 1 year. They eventually became top notch MMO's. 
---
I'm not saying FO76 can't do the same, I really  hope Bethesda turns it around. It has plenty of potential. But with the way they've been handling everything, I won't hold my breath. 
---
This game needed to come out November 2019.
---
Never purchase another game from them? I’m pretty much there now....
---
I’m honestly very disappointed to see everything in this thread. I’ve been a fan of these series since I got Morrowind. I didn’t care for ESO(don’t really remember why, but I sold it 2 days after I purchased it), but wasn’t so off put that I was ready to breakup with Bethesda. I own Fallout 3-76, Morrowind, Oblivion, &amp; Skyrim(which I bought for 2 consoles). 
---
Now, I’m almost done. Putting out a buggy game is one thing, terrible customer service is a completely different issue I’m not willing to put up with. Guess I’ll lose 2 of the series I adore, and just wait for Borderlands 3. 
---
It wouldn't be a surprise to anybody at this point
---
The environmental storytelling isn't up to the level of other FO games. This whole project was rushed, and the storytelling is one of the areas where it really shows.
---
I think the real reason notes and terminals aren't listed in the official guide is because they knew they didn't have enough staff to complete the project before release and they didn't want to paint themselves in a corner.
---
If anything we should be finding more notes and direct clues about the dead  because such a short time has passed. But almost none of the corpses you find are searchable. And none of the skeletons are searchable, but prewar notes survived into FO4 🤔
---
piss poor decision making
---
Yep. You are simply looking at another point of imbalance and failure.
---
Role players
---
Welp, at least we tried.
---
All the issues this game has had both actually in game and from the general marketing and support would be fine in a vacuum but it's not in a vacuum it's constant fumble after fumble with no real uptick to break them up. Large multiplayer games launch all the time and sure they may have launch week issues and 1 or 2 annoyances like microtransactions but this game launched with issues that were known and had user patches in the previous title...
---
I'm only stressing this because I don't like to see people defending Bethesda in any way simply because they don't deserve it and if given the opportunity to keep shoving mediocrity down our throats they will where as the past has shown they have the capacity to be and make much better than this.
---
I 100% agree unfortunately. A year ago I’d have called Bethesda my favorite studio hands down. Watching them fumble with DOA PvP features that very few give a shit about 3 months later is very telling. Also further supports the theory that this is just another attempt to jump on the battle royale skin shop games as a service bullshit, in a fallout suit. If that’s true, they should be ashamed and I hope they pull their head out of their ass by starfield. Either way this has been so disappointing. 
---
She's been a trooper through all of this and so kind. 
---
Interestingly enough, people don't want to play a game when they don't feel rewarded.
---
...did you read the OP from Bethesda?
---
&gt; It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing Patch 5. The team is working to identify how this happened so we can prevent this from repeating in the future. 
---
That's pretty conclusive that they fucked up and merged with an old build rather than the live one.
---
I only have marsupial currently and I’m not sure I could play the game without it now.  
---
I've been defending this game to people more die-hard loyal to Bethesda than I am, but I can't anymore. One more patch for me to fix this nonsense or I'm done. 3 of my friends have already quit. 
---
Yeah but the super mutants yell, “run away run away”. So it is hilarious , Monty python and you can chase them down. Luv it. 
---
&gt;  I have a TS, not a TSE, so the nerf doesn't really affect me.
---
Quote from the patch notes. 
---
&gt; The Two Shot legendary effect’s damage bonus has been reduced from +100% to +25% of base weapon damage. 
---
So you do 75% less damage now, depending on how it's calculate with weapon perks. Regardless, not sure how that doesn't affect you with a TS weapons.
---
The fucked that up as well, they show as know on all characters on your account making them misable on alt's.
---
It's almost like they have no clue what they are doing!
---
Idk about giving up, but I'm definitely playing it less. It's not about the bugs, only a few of those were bothering me, or other players, only encountered a few true "jerks". Weight management between stash and toon inventory is driving me nuts.
---
ESO was a game that was terrible at launch (by most accounts i read). When i finally tried it 2 or 3 years later, I really enjoyed it.
---
With Elsweyr dlc being released in upcoming months, that's prob what I'll be playing.
---
And before anyone says 'eso inventory' sucks waah
---
my main (and primary+secondary alts have) has maxed inv and bank is maxed too, so I'm not too worried about that.
---
 May resub to eso plus if i decide to do a LOT of crafting, and to avoid having to buy somerset and elsweyr dlcs (own all the other prev ones).
---
fo76 will get some decent fixes and improvements over next few years, or I'll just get bored and go back to it, i found the game okay *for most part*, i liked how power armor was something easy to find and not gated behind a long irritating mandatory quest, just somewhat boring, weapons break too quick and at qorst worst times. We dont have clans or guilds (in-game and integrated into UI), like it is in eso, neverwinter, etc. 
---
like I just said, there are plenty of sources to satiate your need if you google "snowflake" + "safe space" and filter it by date- the earliest being 2015 I think.
---
I feel like you're deliberately avoiding gaining any further understanding of probability.
---
This is a bug I can get behind. I have 3 sets, and it was a lottery getting the right one. 
---
It was nerfed. Not the weightless trait, the truthfullness of descriptions in the game.
---
They are now only 60% true, at most. 
---
Don't worry, it's a feature, which just works.

Did Jon Jones draw it?

I paid $15 USD. I’ll admit it wasn’t a super legitimate method, but regardless, it works. I was curious as to if their security was that poor (hint: it is). 
---
Prove it.
---
Yeah, even in teams that have QA, one of the major responsibilities of the principal developer and BAs involved in any change is to examine exactly what code (tables, variables, whatever) a change is going to touch, and identify what ELSE is affected by that code.  What else uses it, what else feeds into it/from it.
---
This is meant to form the base of unit testing. 
---
Full regression - testing things that are MEANT to be unrelated - is something that gets performed when the changes aren't clearly understood or are especially comprehensive/significant.  
---
Without detailed, up-to-date, well-maintained automated tests, full regression is an incredibly burdensome affair, which is why it's generally avoided outside of the biggest, most sprawling updates.
---
Clearly these guys have a lot of issues with their BA/Dev/Test processes to miss something like this.
---
I play on PC.  After uninstalling, I had to go to "My Documents\\My Games\\" and delete the FO76 directory.  I then had to go to where I installed the Bethesda Launcher and go into the "\\Games\\" directory and delete the FO76 directory.  After doing all that, I went back into the Bethesda Launcher and reinstalled the game.  After this reinstall I was able to successfully load into a server.
---
It means someone is getting tuned the fuck up in the wasteland. ;)
---
How is Battlefield V? I heard negative things about it before then never heard about it after release.
---
&gt; The game has been out for only *2.5 months.*
---
Jesus, I'm actually at a loss for words here.
---
I've had that problem on most scorched earth runs since the game started.
---
and YOU get an upvote, and YOU get an upvote! 
---
As broken as it may be, they still put out a game that myself, along with the vast majority of us have spent 100+ hours playing.
---
 Can't be all bad. 
---
I like the theory but we can only speculate. Honestly think a revamped AI would be a material change to include in the patch notes; then again they do miss important bits in said notes. Think its more likely that a) stealth mechanic is not working as it should due to error, system issue or intent or b) we've all lost our minds and are looking for problems. As a TSE user I have no axe to grind, no grief to spew on the forums (nerf was needed, sadly demo users got hosed) , as such I think A is more likely.
---
Genre:  a category of artistic composition, as in music or literature, characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 
---
Mechanical genres and content genres are both genres.  
---
A merge of internal builds is the same as they accidentally patched back to an old build?
---
You fucktard. They could nerf TSE without nerfing demolition expert. Demo expert effects grenades which are expensive to craft. Demo expert also costs 5 points. Even at the previous strength, fatman and missile launcher etc were not being used because they are far too heavy. Nerfing them more is absurd. 
---
Nerfing the legendary mod only would’ve solved the problem just fine. Combining that with a demolition nerf fucks over a lot of other people who were already playing with very average explosive weapons. 
---
Hey Cody, which platform are you experiencing this bug on?
---
We've seen all this before. It's like the combined fuckery when FO3 launched, FO4 and Skyrim, all combined into one glorious clusterfuck of fail. I place the blame on one lying sack of shit worm who had sung the same song over and over.
---
If we're giving credit where it's due, who's going to take the fall for breaking on the game?
---
You can read, but that doesn’t mean that you can actually understand what it is that you’re reading. It’s called Reading Comprehension. 
---
Something you clearly need more time with. 
---
Your just mad it’s ok.  If a bad patch is that disturbing then everyone’s life is going well
---
That's easy, they lied to customers why expect them to be honest with Microsoft and Sony?
---
Aha, now I get it.  My bad. 
---
Yeah they are, same with Magazines.
---
Hey may be referring to the Empath not being affected by Class Freak. That's currently the only one I know. 
---
Can you hotfix on consoles easily? I thought they had a approval process to go through for releases? 
---
Metro baby!!
---
there's no such thing because all it takes is for bloodied to look Bethesda the wrong way and it's gone, nerfed.
---
Sorry, was a little unclear.  My handmade is my close quarters gun.  This is the scoped weapon.  Still 8-9 hits to take out a gutsy.

---
I'm on day 2 of not playing.
---
It would be great if we could view stats of how many players are online. I bet Bethesda is shitting a brick right now wondering why the sudden drop in players 
---
You guys are a meme you know that right?
---
Try playing with an explosive build, and keep your calm for more than 10 minutes. Congratulations, you have now utilised a bloodied melee build. In real life!
---
I would do Origins first. Simply because if you do Odyssey and then Origins I think you'd be disappointed. The combat is improved in Origins, the enemies are better (they scale to your level so it's always interesting), and the world is amazing. Honestly the way you can shape the world is really good. Origins is fun...but you don't have as much impact on the world. 
---
Yes. Not all of us are kids. 
---
How dare I expect energy guns to be usable!
---
Lol you need more sleep if you keep dozing off when picking perks 
---
I’m slowly getting over the eggs, but the load times are glacial - ridiculously slow.
---
Bug was still around even before this patch. I unloaded my automatic combat rifle on a super mutant and he healed back to full once I reloaded.
---
The alternative is believing that the ripper, a weapon the crafting of which requires the highest level of the relevant perk (Makeshift Warrior 5), is intended to do 5 damage when other weapons at that tier do 100+. Over-repairing the ripper brings it's damage up to about 70, depending on perks, etc. That's not a crazy level of damage--it fits right in with the other melee weapons.
---
I am playing on pc yes, whats your ingame name?
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I wasn't even aware of that. That sucks.
---
Fixing what you broke is a first step, now to add any new content OTHER THAN NERFS AND ATOM SHOP BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!
---
Is this serious or satire?
---
Simple. Go to any of their communities.
---
ARK is a goddamned shitstorm.
---
Conan Exiles... lol
---
RUST was a shitstorm the second they removed character creation.
---
The Forest has been a mess since the start (love the game, but seriously, look at the negative reviews)
---
7 Days to Die... another lol
---
Minecraft has been a journey from hell for the devs and, years past 1.0, has issues (and I love Modded Minecraft, I have easily thousands of hours in it)
---
Destiny 2 has been a fucking MEME since launch...
---
Or old bugs to make it back into latest patches, whilst Bethesda are busy testing ...
---
Lol good point tbh.
---
I get it on PC, at least.  When I set the price for someone during trading, I'll use the mouse on the slider to drag it to 0, and sometimes end up at 24999.
---
Hey FalloutMe, we hear you. We've been reading posts in the subreddit and reporting a lot of those issues to the dev team. But if you have any big gripes you believe could have gone unnoticed, could you please let me know about these and I'll report these to the team as well
---
Came here to say that. We paid for the privilege of testing their beta 🤦
---
Personally I'm a fan of the simulation idea. Sure there's references to characters in 4. But there is nothing about Scorched,  or Stranglers or Mole Miners. I think our endgame is that this is a simulation or we will actually wipe these creatures out and they will just be forgotten about.
---
if Joey triforce is worried, I"M WORRIED TOO.
---
Just repair your weapons, bro. Be a solution maker, not a problem reporter. 
---
It's not like guns from WWI and WWII are still serviceable if someone didn't apply a constant stream of random trash to their repair. 
---
And stop playing games you whiny titty baby. This is no longer about games. Just repair your weapons.
---
(I am so joking and truly apologize if I offended you!)
---
I hate that you’re right, I loved playing this game but it’s just doesn’t have the same appeal as when I started. I have moved back to playing Dark Souls 3 because it’s less frustrating. 
---
those are the only new issues that I've seen arise in this patch with verification.
---
Look at some one with bird bones if they are running the charisma mutation perk they can fly.
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/11/12/bethesda-promises-new-vaults-opening-in-fallout-76-after-this-weeks-launch/amp/ they promised vaults for a week after release.. they've really just dug themselves with this game
---
I'm curious, what have you been playing since your ban?
---
Same as here, when will you be on? And what is yours so I don't give them to an impostor.
---
ambivalent as in it doesn't bother me one way or the other.
---
I’m 55.  Takes me back ;)
---
Maybe he is talking about this :
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al6mf1/psa\_rad\_worms\_now\_increases\_all\_player\_effects\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al6mf1/psa_rad_worms_now_increases_all_player_effects_by/)
---
I imagine that they outsource most of the rest of it, making a new stash box skin or whatever is ultra low skill stuff that you can ship off to China and have 1 or two people implementing on site.  Even rigging costumes doesn't have to be done in the studio.
---
Take your time and don’t rush it.  The server performance and lag needs looking into - is this due to people trying out old duping methods the patch exposed again or something else?
---
He means when you open trade to set the price. It definitely happens on pc. When you go left it doesn’t stop at 0 caps. It underflows to 25,000. But 25,000 won’t overflow back to 0. So you have to hold left again and try not to pass 0
---
Hmmm
---
those pushing for the perk to be nerfed where mostly doing it for the TSE weapons that could exceed a dramatic damage bonus. but since that is the only damage perk (besides bloody mess) that affects those weapons, it is also a  nerf to a collection of weapons that are not as useful as they could be 
---
I’m sorry. Everything from sneak attacks doing non damaged, to being detected while chameleon stealthed, to not be able to reintance stealth, to just not being able to stealth at all. Mind you all possible stealth perks assigned. Every mechanic of stealth has been broken for me at one point or another since launch.
---
Same here. Was lucky last night to get to loot the queen. But nothing else. 
---
My Bad, you are totally right. Thought there were two Free States vendors for some reason.
---
You don’t have to be a developer to know that if they ruin something in favor of the players it gets fixed a lot faster than when they fuck things up for the players. But keep being naive. 
---
"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you give me the loot now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you. "  --Cindy Lou Who
---
Hey h-t-, is there any more info you could share on this? It would be really helpful to know how these items could have disappeared so we can recreate the steps
---
Yeah, Gutsies are actually really tough.  One of the toughest normal enemies in the game.  You were just spared the agony previously.
---
Are you shooting the core?  That's their weak point.  Most other spots on them will cripple them, but leave them with tonnes of health.  And the "legs" get in the way of the core shot alot of the time.
---
Saying "They are back" is a misnomer.
---
They never left.
---
Honestly I've just given up on Bethesda. There's been a trend in their recent games and, as much as I'd LIKE TES6 to be good, I doubt it's gonna be.
---
Yeah, put some lipstick on before fucking us over.
---
Laughs in no man's sky
---
Please uninstall the game and shoot yourself.
---
Saying it's doxxing is merely for effect. It feels like doxxing. It diminishes the end result by arguing semantics. If your private info was released without your consent, what difference does it make when the intent is completely unknown?
---
Mistakes happen, but how many mistakes does it take before people truly start to question a company? This company knows what they are doing. They received help from several studios. Zenimax has been running ESO for years now. Even privately owned forums can keep private messages and tickets private. This is a billion dollar company with several studios and branches. This is basic stuff they get wrong and they aren't new to it.
---
One weird side effect of yesterday's patch is that it seems like non-Excavator armor has some part that may be linked to the Atom Shop (Bright Headlamp?).  So, now I get the Atom Shop icon on one Power Armor Chassis, and I know which one is my T-60. 😋
---
(But seriously, you have to let us rename these - it's silly).
---
That's exactly how I played it.
---
&gt; TS weapons were basically double damage, which crapped on almost every legendary damage perk.
---
Only for specific types of weapons. Shotguns benefit the most from TS, while it's an almost unusable thing for sniper rifles. So while you're right in some aspects, you're very wrong about others. Explosive was by far the bigger offender in that it wasn't even a primary legendary affix and after you included the demolition perk, it was the highest damage increase you could get on a legendary weapon @200% increase. A TSE weapon did 600% damage per shot in an aoe blast and that made the accuracy problem less of an issue. A simple TS weapon often didn't hit the 2nd or even the first bullet so half the time it was a dps loss. Your double damage claim is under perfect circumstances and those never happen.
---
Good, play games worth your time instead of that rushed garbage 
---
&gt;Simple. Go to any of their communities.
---
So we're using community reaction as a gauge for whether or not a game is broken? In that case, Fallout 76 wins **hands-down.** It's the laughing stock of the entire internet, and even your own sub is full of people who hate it.
---
I was a hardcore anti duper pre nerf, now I'm in favor of it. If Bethesda is going constantly move the goal posts in this game I really see no reason to not buy duped weapons and armor online every time Bethesda moves the goal posts.
---
More like 40-50. 
---
I just got it last night from the thunder mountain workshop. I have gotten it there a few times
---
To be honest, it is probably better if you start an official post dedicated to do just that. No one person can help you do this, you need everyone on board here. It's good that you care enough to ask, tho. I hope this is a first step in the right direction, but right now, you gotta act quickly.
---
give us unique responses or i will lose my miiiiind, GAMERS RISE UP WASTELANDER
---
They just keep piling on the dumpster fire.
---
This is a known issue and a hotfix is in the works
---
Are you aware of the rad worms bug yet?
---
I noticed that my wheel menu was screwed up today, but in a rather specific way.  I had two different Combat Knives - one Instigating, the other Exterminator.  The Instigating in slot 1 shifted to where the Exterminator was (slot 6, I think), and the Exterminator was completely removed.
---
This makes me wonder if the wheel stores the type of weapon, but not the effects.  So it sees a "Combat Knife" and figures there can only be one.
---
I did have my Gas Mask with Goggle disappear from out of the blue.  I can't rule out the possibility that I accidentally scrapped or sold it, though.
---
Yeah that part does suck don’t understand why they added that extra step. Makes no sense 
---
I did 
---
I think most people are upset about all the nerfs. Some of us spent about a hundred hours on a build that we'd be happy with, only for Bethesda to make the build shit all of a sudden. The least they could do is offer a free full respec if they're going to drastically make perks and weapons less powerful. 
---
They also nerfed XP gains even more. It feels like instead of adding endgame content, they're making the grind of getting through the game take way longer. It's lazy, and aslap in the face to anyone that has been defending them.
---
None, because they're 100% focused on trying to fix 100 bugs each patch, and adding NO content.
---
My best friend already quit.
---
My other friend I play with all the time will probably quit soon.
---
My friends list gets emptier by the day.
---
They aren't quitting because of bugs, nerfs, QOL, etc.............they're BORED.  Balls deep stone cold BORED.
---
Awesome to hear!
---
Oh well if random complainer 10 told me to quit, I'm sold.
---
At most.
---
It takes zero effort to keep scrolling! 
---
I love it too, but I think it is important to critique what you love when it has flaws. I fully believe Bethesda can and should get this game to reach its full potential 
---
The one being discussed on Bethesda.net FO76 forums since this patch. Kinda sad you don’t even look there. If you did, you wouldn’t have to ask.
---
I'll take a look into this. Hope to have an answer for you tomorrow!
---
This isn't a simulation, otherwise there wouldn't be the Enclave or BoS
---
Thank you for this duke - I'll mention to the team that this isn't just isolated to PC
---
It's pretty bad 
---
Because the devs dont know what those weird symbols mean next to the numbers after the sideways 11
---
The thing is, though, single player games like F;NV can have bugs and get a little bit of forgiveness for it because it's an isolated experience. Online only multiplayer games NEED to be tighter, and 76 has been, by far, the most broken game I've seen in a long time. And let's not even get into the anti-consumer business bullshit lmao 
---
So they fire the people they already have, and probably have had for a while and hire new people for a completely different job and spend the next few months on training. Sounds about right...
---
  I gave up a week ago. This patch was like putting a padlock on the exit gate.
---
  Like, was it that hard to fix laser weapons instead of looking for MORE ways to turn this game into a grindfest.
---
  I bought this game at full price because of my faith in BGS. 3 months later and it still feels like an early access game.  It's sad because this company was one of my favorites but now I won't trust them again.
---
It has flaws , but it’s not the worst fucking game of all time 
---
Dont bother it will be nerfed soon
---
It got better and worse........i now picture the devs as monkeys that are fingering their own arseholes while beating themselves in the head with a claw hammer and somehow striking fucking gold and completely destroying any credibility they had left in absolutely perfect unison........its made some things absolutely brilliant and totally fixed but then things that had absolutely nothing wrong with them are now completely faaacked 😂😂😂
---
RUST was the laughing stock of the entire internet for almost a year...
---
ARK still is (despite things being a lot better now)
---
Conan has dissolved into the ether because of physics penises and griefer nonsense
---
Destiny 2, well, news says enough
---
7 Days to Die was crushed by a lot of unfortunate events because of how the devs didn't give a rat's arse about the negativity for over a year
---
The Forest... thank god it has a finished story, but the gameplay has been another journey through hell
---
Minecraft is Minecraft which has an insane level of divided ideals
---
I just got a replay from them, actually. Who knows.
---
They need to add a weapon called the dupers ban hammer. See ya
---
Seeing the comments I'm really happy to hear that I'm wrong, I'm hoping I just haven't found the right guns/builds. To add I also haven't had TSE myself, haven't had either on their own either
---
I mean, you can use the fact that something is a first time for them, and that would normally be a valid observation. But this company also releases new games with the same problems that date back many sequels. Problems that modders have fixed on their own, and Bethesda continues to ignore with each release.
---
So doing something the first time, and doing something a half dozen times. Neither seems to make much difference with this company.
---
I would even be fine if they felt like they needed to still keep it level locked so you couldn't take all three points immediately or whatever. Just anything to get rid of the mess of all the extra cards
---
Losing all your offline games for an online game ban(regardless of whether it is justified or not) is completely fucked.
---
Hope your able to get your account back man.
---
Serious question.
---
Why would you make a post complaining about something that you had absolutely no personal context or confirmation to back up?
---
I wondered why my T-60 had an icon next to it. 
---
Excellent advice! I'll be sure to try and walk/run to  places more often.
---
I'll definitely have to partake in a few more Messenger and Horde events too!
---
I guess I've been so keen to complete quests, that I rush the places, but that's my fear of being disconnected from server!!
---
Once I get over 2500 caps, I'll probably forget I was even struggling. 
---
Thank you for linking that zouille. Having a look into that thread now
---
What up. Don't get down on yourself. You deserve that silver. You made a mistake and owned up to it in front of us all. I know nothing about your previous post but i do know from this one that you are a solid dude. Keep it up and Happy Gaming
---
Doesn't do much damage? Im not sure what kind of weapon its considered. I would think rifle, but laser weapons are still crap anyway. 
---
I had a TSE character I wasn't using.  He's level 130 and I don't even have a full set of legendary armor for him, that's how little I care.  Can't go back to playing him now.
---
My main is a level 170 Melee.  I'm waiting for them to nuke nerf that one soon.
---
After that I'll have 0 of 2 viable builds.  I'm not creating a 3rd character to chase whatever the new META is.
---
"I was just a random mule character for my 100's of friends!" Uh huh ;)
---
I don't give a flying ace if you believe me or not. 
---
Point is I shouldn't be locked out of unrelated products.
---
I put a targeting HUD in my power armor and started crashing WAY more frequently. I took it out and the crashes went away. Not saying that caused your crash, but I thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Oddly enough I have the Opposite problem, I can't get in non excavator PA because i'd be over-encumbered. :(
---
Like Jim Breuer in Half Baked....Whose coming with me man? Whose coming anyone?
---
Nah just some common decency really isn't it, they didn't even come out and apologise for the weak ass patch not having any QA whats so ever.
---
Now hes back in here cutting and pasting generic responses after expecting customers to be alright with having to wait till next week, almost like they are entitled to treat there customers however they want. Whilst posting that cos play shyte on there twitter acting all innocent as if there isn't a problem.
---
Bethesda are a bit of a joke really aren't they, reckon there is even a QA team or is it just another lie?
---
If you have to compare it to 'the worst game of all time', things are pretty grim coming from a AAA developer.
---
You mean Bethesda broke something while attempting to fix an issue? Impossible!
---
But yeah, I haven't touched the game since the patch so I don't have an actual answer for you. :(
---
wow thats a straight up insult,
---
reroll the patch, fix your shit and patch in april if you have to but wow...
---
installing fallout 4 (cant wait to try horizons + sim conquerer and ofc miami)
---
At least the community can.
---
too bad bethesda wont profit from that, i'd rather donate 5 euros to a good mod
---
I did more than that and I don’t care specifically because they were the easier and most predictable loot compared to legendaries, serum recipes , and ultracite pa mods 
---
I mean the significance in back end numbers, not significance of reddit posts.
---
I had reported this when it first happened using the feedback on Bethesda's support page.  Is that where we are supposed to report bugs or should we just do it here?
---
Weve got a guy in my discord that we all pool our resources on, anytime we need something he just logs onto the mule and we get what we need. 
---
Resources ranging from extra mats to extra legendaries someone might need for a build some day. Nothing goes to waste. Its totally possible :P
---
What are you lot, fucking amateurs? *We will look into how this happened.* Is it your first time releasing a patch... FFS?
---
Here's an idea, pull your heads out of your asses so you can see your monitors more clearly.
---
Your testing the hotfix but neglected to test the patch. If you did test the patch then you need to fire your testing team because there obviously tested another game.
---
Start acting and producing results like professional developers.
---
What weapon you got?
---
After a server hop? If so, yeah. This is how it is now. Sorry.
---
Y u do dis?  
---
:'(
---
It's the only thing he's able to do in a situation like this, why do you have to be a dick to someone who is doing his job?
---
The ole bait and switch promise to make the game better and managed to create some serious issues while simultaneously bringing back old problems just wait until you try to craft and it won't unbulk your mats FYI the rarest resource in the game balistic fiber is now required to craft and repair almost all armor
---
Probably broken knowing this game 
---
All you need is anti armour and you can one shot anything except the big enemies.
---
Upvoted because DBD
---
You can look at my post history. I've defended this game. I even made a post about how much I hope yeah Bethesda knocks it out of the park to shut up the people saying that it would suck. But man with the nerfs on top of everything I feel like I haven't been treated well as a consumer and I do not want to continue spending my free time supporting this game. I uninstalled this morning and have been playing Kingdom Hearts 3 and have had a great time. I truly regret giving I up but I can't keep kidding myself, Bethesda is not being transparent or communicating like they should. 
---
As one of the people who has given him items out of my own stash to hold, I know he is telling the truth.  We had a crew of over 14 people playing 76, and we all would stash things with him due to the dinky ass stash sizes. 
---
Fallout recipe for viagra 
---
You don’t hunt the mothman anymore, you can *see like the mothman*
---
Believe me, melee is the next one getting nuke nerfed.
---
After that, they're going to come for your sniper build.
---
Pretty soon the best META for the game will to be run around naked and punch things with your bare fists.  It'll take forever to kill things, but at least the resource grind will be manageable.
---
haha, cute.  How about you fix your dam game?
---
bloodied swing speed sledge and BE shotgun. I'd try sledge first.
---
Thank you for reading through this all. I really do appreciate it. I hope that everything that’s been discussed today (in this post in the many many others) can be passed along. Thank you for being active 
---
Doea everything have to be a dramatic proclamation?  They made a bad game,  their other games were better.  Companies release stinkers every now and then.  Just move on and spare us the whining.
---
Nice one. Just keep having fun.
---
ah yes but was it just a generic cut n paste that said they were about to report this issue to the team, or just to clarify so there not mistaken before they report it to the team ....lol bethesda
---
Lol yeah.
---
Reminds me of the No Man's Sky comparisons. Why would you want the game's launch to be compared to the most disastrous game release of the generation?
---
Yeah good point.
---
I'm only purchasing bulk Ballistic fiber every few hours, even with CHR at 15+ I'm paying 285 caps.
---
But I'm trying to respec to have more resilient armour, etc. Lucky Break will be my saviour!!
---
Not sure why you commented two nearly identical posts to me but STO is not really comparable. An MMO going f2p is a last ditch effort to squeeze out any last available revenue by pulling in players and offering mtx. 
---
Fo76 is too new to complain about the lack of new content. Not a single MMO in existence put out "new" content within 3 months of original release. I'm not sure what new content will be available for 76 3 months from now but even if there isnt any the game still stands on it's own as is. If you're bored of it already that's fine, you played it a lot it sounds like. I got bored of Destiny 2 after 10 hours and I got it for free via PSN.
---
If you've played a game for 100 hours and are complaining about lack of content then you should really check your entitlement because the per hour cost of entertainment is a bargain. Most people put 20 to 40 hours into a single player title and herald them as the second coming of christ.
---
I know they put a good amount of capital into it, so they would more than likely have a coach.  The problem was the training of the frontline staff.  For them it was like flipping a switch.  Since they couldn't stop projects, it was "Okay you have two weeks to learn this and execute it on your next project effortlessly".  
---
I read through some of the documentation and such and you are right.  It is difficult. I'm too set in my ways. Glad I moved upward and out of there lol.  I can see the benefit though with a proper implementation.

So, those of us that actually like most of the new build and are very happy that OP TSEs got the nerf they needed dont have legitimate points? I'll tell you that I haven't had any issues with the game since patch and I'm hitting and killing as well as every. Is that legitimate? I'm very happy I can find plans that I've been looking for since the beta...is that legitimate? 
---
Go ahead, downvote me, my esteem is not predicate on Reddit.
---
While your comment is true, there are also only so many people who can work on a coding job before adding new people makes the efficiency go down, instead of up.
---
Hey mate, thank you (and everyone) for sharing info on this bug. I've just reported it to the team and shared this thread with them too.
---
Sometimes I kick them when they're down and I don't even feel badly about it.
---
You cared enough to post.
---
So you care.
---
Ok pal.
---
Community manager ignoring the big issue cut n pasting responses is not doing his job at all.
---
Bro, nobody gives a shit what game you are playing now. I'm glad you found something that you enjoy.
---
I kinda wonder if that is even legal. Sure there is likely something in the TOS of 76 about banning you from that game but does it mention banning you from all other games that you've purchased? 
---
Try making a new account with a new email, or hope one of the community managers here can help you. I can't think of anything else to do.
---
Agree
---
Yeah, I won't have any problems following that agreement, what were you up to though ;)
---
They give players no fucking credit.
---
It's the exact same story with Mass Effect.
---
The original Mass Effect had complex, engaging RPG systems.
---
ME2 was a Gears of War clone.
---
Hmmm, I wonder who is making Anthem...
---
It looks amazing sir, gave me some inspiration to tune my own build! Thanks for sharing!
---
I was running a TSE gatling gun and it managed resources really well. Sure, I had ammo to worry about, but if all you do is run silos you never really need to worry about lead. If you're low on steel, just clear out poseiden or run uranium fever once for plenty of gun steel. Now that I'm running melee, I'm realizing it's a really hungry build that needs a lot of healing and chems. And my stash isn't liking it either. Before I could get away with running lots of weight reducing perks and maintaining DPS. Now I can't afford the points to run most of them and I keep much more in stash.
---
Sorry, I donated all my caps already. I do have some spare adhes...nope, gone. Sorry.
---
I loved that storyline so much that I ran around using the Garb/Eye/Sword/Pistol until level 47.
---
Why dont you just realize you had a bad and unpopular idea and stop telling people that they are 'mad' or cant 'comprehend' the game. The game came out months ago, stop redesigning it from home.
---
all those 100 person fallout 76 "guilds" you here so much about.
---
Just did I’m loading up fallout now 
---
nope its the normal red tactical headlamp e
---
Made the same comment yesterday and was downvoted immediately. People just don’t wanna hear it. They’d rather whine in hopes of getting what they want. 
---
feel free to keep up with my BAN POST ;) ill update it when i get my unban JUST FOR YOU
---
Lol 45 here
---
Cause was fairly obvious - poor software config mgmt and code merging practice plus lack of regression testing - all of which falls in software development 101. FFS. 
---
Check your email, you may have been a cheater and earned a ban
---
And armor.
---
Good gosh armor "costs" a lot now.  I will grant, I always had Rank 2 of White Knight, but now with that, it still routinely costs *4* Ballistic Fibers to repair something.
---
For a perk that Bethesda didn't want to make "mandatory," that's an absolute joke.
---
Hey all, thanks for reporting this. We're discussing this now and actively investigating. 
---
Why would they?  They don't play it.
---
You do realise the moment people agree on this topic, it's nerfing time?
---
I actually liked the lore in FO76. Reading through the journals, listening to the holotapes, and checking out the aftermath was cool. Like the guy who started a cult because he was bored. That was my favorite. 
---
But yea, I loved the bug in FO4 that allowed me to build a camp out of the drive in movie lot and have people move in. I really missed that.
---
Well, bye.
---
There are no professional developers left at Bethesda, its clearly a bunch of inbred hill billies mashing keys and jerking Todd off from time to time for a pay rise :/
---
out of arguments so you resort to the childish option? fine, but keep in mind you don't know what that word means.
---
and yes, I got that from the urbandictionary article as well. too bad it's not how it was originally used online back in 2015(?)
---
Right?  And even settlement building which should have been a core part of the experience is so terribly limited.  You should always be able to say, I want to improve on my camp, but for me you’re out of budget with just the essentials, so no room to expand and tinker.  It hurt their bottom line too, why buy lots of camp items when you’re maxed?  And why the heck do the atom shop items cost so much budget!  Always more than what they are replacing, so I’m maxed, scrap a bed or light to replace the fancy one I bought, and can’t even place it.  It’s stupid. 
---
And all downstream of the horrible choice to build on what is cheap and easy for them (creation engine and their associated tools) vs what is best for players or even long term for the business.  Just short sighted, cheap, and lazy.  And the worst part is they made the same choice for Starfield and ES6. 
---
embarrassing folks i guess lol
---
Do you believe everything that has happened is acceptable? This is a large company that has prided themselves with having a good relationship with their customers. Stating valid complaints is not crying. Perhaps you have lower standards for what is acceptable?
---
I'm about ready to start that one myself. 👍
---
scorchies/sbq tend not to go down with just that, and if your attacked by more than 9 enemies at once, good luck
---
I've got about 200 hours of Fallout 76 archive footage on my twitch account and nearly all of it is nuke zone farming because tha'ts the only thing worth doing in the damn game.
---
:( Sad but true
---
Like, the stability of the game is FINALLY where it needs to be no crashes freezes or lag but well quite literally everything else was broken in the process.
---
MODERN ERA "billy the kid" still flies 
---
I'm worried that it took them three months to find a way to add one word of text next to vendor items, yeah. XD
---
Hey ravenze, yesterday I let the team know that the community finds issue with energy weapon damage (and also durability - which the team is working to address in a future patch). But was there something specific about ammo? Or is it just the damage of energy weapons in general?
---
that's not a lot to go on.  What about the two duping methods (one old and one new).  What about the instant 1 shot kills?  What about all the crashes?
---
It’s like GTA4. Lifeless. Depressing. I want to like it because I’ve invested a lot of time making this character and built a settlement. 
---
Oh I hate this guy, always stretching out any news and making content already made by other people. Always changing his mind about things like the wind
---
I mean now that I need to re-spec my character and all of my weapons suck. I'm cool with buying a duped OP melee weapon. At level 123 it seems lame to have to start from scratch.
---
Thank you for bringing this up, we're looking into reports about this and actively investigating.
---
Heard it was Camden park haven't checked though
---
I think he was talking about when sometimes you drop an item, a bag doesn't appear as if it got dropped through the void of the game world. (I say void since dropping another item is a futile attempt to retrive the lost item since it's obviously out of the radius to group the bag contents) 
---
The current workaround for this is to drop a bobby pin or something and then target a bag to dump stuff in.Then it's a different issue of if a person picks up that bag too early and THAT stuff disappearing into the void but I think it was mentioned in the last patch. "Paper Bags: Fixed multiple issues in which transferring items into an empty paper bag as the bag was despawning caused those items to become lost."
---
It wasn't clear if this second fix addressed the previous issue.
---
Save face, lol It’s rediit. What face is to save on a game forum?
---
the last poster I said was mad said I was right. 
---
Maybe head your own advice and stop responding because you don’t agree with a posters idea in an attempt to save further face and trying to prove a point in a matter of opinions where neither are wright or wrong.
---
But I love you the same.
---
oh god a streamer
---
R.I.P. Glowing Ones D=
---
/u/Ladydevann and /u/LoneVaultWanderer, can we make sure this gets into the hotfix your team is working on? This is a pretty massive bug that needs to be addressed ASAP.
---
Think that's was what the QA team said right before the said fuck it and stamped the patch as ready?
---
I knew stealth was broken within 5 minutes of starting my game last night. I’d be surprised if they are doing much testing at all. 
---
Checked both watogas and r&amp;g to no avail. thanks anyway! 
---
Do you see the irony in your response? "I'm not interested in this game so no one else is!!!!" 
---
Also your comparison is terrible. Anthem is more like if Warframe and Diablo had a love child. 
---
The game is amazingly fluid and well put together. If you don't enjoy that's on you, but it is looking to be amazingly fun...and without the litany of issues Fallout has had since launch.
---
Well those are pretty vague lol. I tried verifying this but I couldn't find a copy of the TOS, got a link?
---
word . it just goes to show you .that a AAA game publisher is ready to bend over for whoever cries the loudest 
---
Great news! Thanks for the reply.
---
And I thought I was negative
---
OP build is Excavator armor, hard farming iron ore and selling steel to everyone since they're going to be repaird 85% of their time in game and won't have the steel or resourced to repair it. 
---
Idk. Mods can be found at Welch and Lewisburg for sure.
---
Sorry to hijack the op but has anyone found shielded plans?
---
Can you please fix the Stealth Boy Mark iii while you're at it? It doesn't work at all.
---
What next, he goes on a soccer thread and complains that he can't run like the other players? News flash: **as you age you will no longer be able to do everything that you could when you were young**. This is **reality**. Your feelings are **irrelevant**.
---
had it happen earlier with my marsupial perk
---
Based on the [datamined patch notes](https://github.com/despotak/fallout_76_patch_notes/blob/master/v1.0.5.10.md), fusion core generation has not revert.  Please don't spread misinformation based on an unverified thread with no proof.
---
In fact, this has recently been [debunked](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al8oto/xbox_1_still_getting_8_fusion_cores_per_hour/) based on in-game monitoring of the fusion core generator producing the correct 8 cores per hour.
---
Every vendor now sells it including the Ammo kiosks.
---
I’m all good now thx 
---
End of the week or next week?  That's not a "hotfix."  I'm already back to playing 7Days to Die to check out the new Alpha 17 - which is better managed btw and more content.
---
This patch pushed me over the edge.
---
I was thinking the same thing, but truth be told, I think the ghost town servers kind of speak for themselves.
---
You'd probably see less hate.
---
It's going to be quite the chuckle fest when they nuke nerf melee, stealth, and bloodied builds.
---
My 170 Melee Main isn't going to like that one bit.
---
They need to do gradual SMALL balance changes like League of Legends.  I never see a nerf and say "teemo is unplayable now" or a buff and say "Ashe is so OP, she's going to be my Main".
---
Wouldn’t that qualify as instant tho
---
@cookiestar
---
Tanking a bad product so the next launch isn't to badly effected isn't unheard off.
---
 u/LoneVaultWanderer,  can you look at and/or comment  [on this thread?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alcjfs/patch_issue_stealth_crouch_is_less_effective/)
---
Aimed at LadyDevann but I imagine the team's busy today.  Issue is perceived or real stealth performance issues. Problem being we can't measure stealth, only report what's observed. Having it checked and debunked or confirmed would be great.
---
https://bethesda.net/en/document/terms-of-service
---
https://bethesda.net/en/document/code-of-conduct
---
Yeah, this is a feature, bro.
---
One of many features to this game.
---
Enjoy!
---
(That sucks...)
---
What QA team?
---
That is a valid point. 
---
I feel like part of the problem is people don't fully understand what a community manager does. Also how many CM's are there? O\_o
---
carry on sperglord
---
166. Out of curiosity, why?
---
Funny, they said they were releasing their own "known bugs list in the the coming days" ... that was december 11th.
---
I care about the game, not the moaning of people who want to quit.
---
Frankly, there are a lot of repetitive "I can't defend this game anymore, I quit" posts cropping up in the last 24 hours. Reading the recent reports about election meddling and botting, I don't count it as a stretch that people who hate this game are fabricating these posts and/or the many upvotes they're getting. Which isn't to make the insane claim or implication that people can't get fed up and leave of their own volition. It's just not reasonable to me that this sub would go from chill and balanced to hateful, stupid, and hyperbolic within a week or two's time. Particularly when the top voted posts were historically reaching 1-2k, and were usually positive/wholesome/funny, and now we have 3-5k posts that are cynical and stupid? How did that happen? 
---
It's not exactly hard for a group of imbeciles whose mission is to disturb the fun of others to come over and click that upvote on every shitty thread they find. 
---
Anyway, I'm not gonna descend into believing/endorsing that this is how it is. But I'm left wondering because this rapid shift away from reason makes no sense to me. xD
---
All I can say it's strange how I've seen old bugs fixed ages ago, to return. It's strange.
---
There's nothing wrong with a multiplayer fallout or even a MMO style. That isn't the issue. There has been a litany of issues 
---
Camden park had a bunch when I stopped there. 
---
Hahahaha
---
I [disagree](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alcajw/if_you_want_us_to_do_lower_damage_thats_fine_but/efd3xat/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alc57y/nerfs_upon_nerfs_upon_nerfs/efd471o/) [not](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3flg/did_they_just_bring_back_all_the_old_bugs/efaoemc/) [commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al37fu/serious_bug_with_bulk_everything/efa9yle/) [on](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al49cj/dear_bethesda_i_think_your_new_patch_screwed_up/efazpqm/) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al3kb1/bug_fix_bug_fix_bug_fix_bug_fix_nerf_nerf_nerf/efb0eng/) that matter, granted the comments aren't that helpful but there's only so much a community manager can do. 
---
Its all the filthy casuals fault!!
---
scorchbeasts are a whole different subject and one that I quite literally like to avoid altogether. but you're right, yeah. I was thinking more in a pvp environment.
---
and you shouldn't be using a Dragon as an assault rifle to begin with. you're supposed to stay hidden.
---
What's your opinion now?
---
Hrmm...  interesting, you mean you prefer the brick on the outside?  Not on the inside?
---
Holy shit, didn’t even notice this...they can make KNOWN plans shared visually but...can’t actually make them shared between accounts? What kind of assbackwardsfuckery is that?
---
Also noticed a few more bugs you may want to look at.
---
\* As of 1/29 patch, your player name shows up in the team menu as if you are an additional member of the team  
---
\* As of 1/29 patch, having a weapon on your favourites bar while having a different weapon of the same type in your inventory will sometimes equip the inventory weapon instead  
---
\* As of 1/29 patch, Unyielding no longer grants +3 special under 25% hp, you have to be less than 12% and then you only get +2  
---
\* As of 1/29 patch, can fast travel to any player (unclear if this was intentional) 
---
It's not even jumping the gun. It's literally reporting on the patch notes. This sub is ridiculous.
---
Read my comment a little more closely. I said "the most broken game I've seen in a long time," not the most broken game I've seen. The last time I've seen a game this broken was that one fucking Assassin's Creed, whatever it was called(you know the one I mean), and I remember thinking to myself "I really can't imagine things getting worse than this." If only I'd known then what I know now. 
---
Anyway, if you're not experiencing bugs lately, fine. Good for you! Really! But you're in the minority on that one. And, quite frankly, FO76 isn't anything close to an MMO, and even if it were, saying "Other games launched and weren't good," just isn't an excuse anymore. Have higher standards than that. 
---
I think it just seems like this because all the people calling for a TSE nerf got what they wanted, and so it's really just all the people who *didn't* want that now speaking up, not the same people. People tend to only speak out (or at least, speak out the loudest) when they have grievances, the people who wanted TSE to be nerfed now have no reason to speak up about it, but people who liked things the way they were now have a new grievance to air, you see this a lot especially in online games, and is the reason why it seems like you can never please everyone.. it's easy to forget it's not always the same groups of people speaking out and making psots
---
steel is retarded easy to get
---
Zenimax game? Did they just cut and paste the ToS from another game as well as the assets?
---
I thought it was worrisome no one in their game design department drafted and implemented this before they even launched the game 
---
You know like ... taking a minute to think about how to discern know plans, or power armors and so on 
---
It's probably the same bug as radiation defense not working at all on some pieces of armor. The game appears to occasionally just flat out ignore some legendary mods.
---
Its reap what you sow
---
We really appreciate both the feedback and the kind words. We're definitely listening, aware of the issues, and actively working on hotfixes. Thanks for your understanding, folks.
---
Yeah fa76 got stale really quick it took about a week or less to do almost everything the game has to offer. Hell it took me months to do most of the things on fa4 an I haven’t hit lvl 100. I don’t think I’ll be playing fa76 till next year 
---
How are the CMs ignoring the big issues? They have been responding to a shitton of posts, on all sorts of issues.
---
Are you aware of what is going behind the scenes? Are you thinking about what their bosses are telling them they can and can't say? Are you thinking about the time they spend submitting tickets and reports for the posts they are responding to?
---
Of course not, you're busy being edgy.
---
Guess I'll just go buy an rtx 2080 while im at it! 
---
/sarcasm
---
&gt; yesterday
---
#**THIS HAS BEEN A HIGHLY, PUBLICLY, REPORTED ISSUE SINCE** ***BETA***.  
---
There is **no excuse** that this was only addressed to your team *yesterday*.
---
/u/Ladydevann why don't you comment on this thread?  You keep saying you are a community manager responsible for communicating with fans.  So what is Bethseda official position on this post?
---
HAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH 
---
Arw you hitting x for transfer instead of just checking the pop up window. 
---
This happened pre patch. Sometimes you have to look in them and you'll see the resources properly. It lags a bit though 
---
We've recently posted about this, and the fact we're working/testing a hotfix as we speak for it (along with other issues that we're aware of).  Basically a merge of internal dev builds didn't execute properly prior to releasing the most recent patch - the team's working on identifying the cause so we can stop it from happening in future.  
---
You can check out the full post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alie1l/hotfix_coming_for_issues_introduced_in_patch_5/?sort=new) if that helps at all.
---
I like to imagine it's one poor soul, trapped against his will. Living in a filthy cell, only interactions with mice and a daily email from the higher ups that just say "FIX IT"
---
And lose durability on my PA parts? That's insane! 
---
It WAS the Hunter's Hood and the Traveling Leather Coat. The Hunter's Hood was removed from my inventory even though I bought it from a legit source, but hey, can't let people have a god damn hood in this game, right?
---
I already signed up for ea access so i can do the demo. Feb can’t come soon enough
---
I don’t even think they have something like an „active players counter“ implemented for themselves 
---
I mean with the state and workload(?) of coding ingame, i would be surprised if they had time to code something outside of the game 
---
If they're going to put conditions on unlocking accounts, they need to have the staff on hand to deal with people trying to meet those conditions.
---
Can you see what ive done on there? Lol
---
I carry 5.
---
Having a look into that thread? Have you been paying attention at all to the last 24 hours worth of posts? 
---
I have and seen that mentioned at least a half dozen times. What kind of community manager are you?
---
Wake up!
---
Yeah that’s why I said they don’t deserve the hate further down the post, but I wrote it due to how this sub became endless cries for Bethesda as a whole to listen to us, when the truth is only a small group of developers of fixing this train wreck, and they don’t have the means to accomplish what we are requesting, let alone fix the major bugs that have existed since launch.
---
What I realize is that again this is a fucking video game and not a fucking full time job. People are allowed to stop playing a game and then, and here's the shocker, pick it up again when new shit gets added!
---
The game has only been out for three fucking months and you're acting as if they should have been dropping dlc expansions weeks ago.
---
Bethesda knows exactly how many people are or aren't playing the game, a bunch of whiny drama queens on reddit isn't their barometer for how healthy the game is. 
---
why assume the 2 players you came across are dupers....
---
i have a tse shotty and i dont/never have duped or mass crafted.
---
People will use what they like weather or not it gets nerfed. 
---
if your really concerned make a melee op build and have fireproof perk and dense armour :)
---
no, people asked for a server split so there was pvp only ones, and then pve only ones.
---
no one wanted pvp only servers while nothing is changed to the existing ones. 
---
I think corn soup will be nerfed soon
---
Im 99.9999999% sure theyre talking about things like that group of people following around that guy around and harassing him and calling him gay and to kill himself. I highly doubt they care if youre talking trash, as long as its not personal, and thats not millennial, basic courtesy has always been around so we can put that bullshit blaming millenials to bed.
---
was banned on the 23rd . responded . got a response less then 24 hours later. said it would take 7-10 days (didnt specify weather or not they were business days or whatever)i believe today is day 7 no more responses by email. im locked out of my bethesda account . cant play anything that runs on the bethesda launcher right now . its utter crap 
---
&gt; There was no win for Beth here.
---
The easy win for Bethesda would have been to release a game that had multiplayer mechanics in mind from the start, none of these problems come from anything but Bethesda's own failures.  They create their own losses continually because they don't have a clue what a win would look like.
---
I use it as an opener, instigating on them is INSANE for fight open damage, even on SB/SBQ.  Personally though, I only play pve content, as do a large number of players, things need to be balanced differently for pvp/pve, that's why I personally think it should be an 'arena' type thing where the faction you fight for determines what gear your 'given' for the arena, that would allow it to be much, much more balanced imo (pvp that is)
---
We really should get a PTS server to fully test updates before they hit the live game. 
---
I recall Grafton steel steel extractors capping at about 40 steel each. Empty the extractors every so often.
---
Also, if you need ammo, consider moving south and take up mining with excavator power armor. Hornwright site 3 has lead and steel in abundance with no worries over PVPers.
---
Thanks for that.  Dang that would have been cool! 
---
What good is an apology gonna do to you? People would still be complaining. 
---
None of the people up in arms will be happy until the game as fixed, and there's still a fat chance they still won't be happy. 
---
And some of us really appreciate the games you've created and will continue to create. Keep up the great work! 
---
As if the higher ups would say "Fix it.". I cannot imagine Todd Howard ever say this. Instead he says things like "That's a nice picture of a bunny, let's charge 5$ for it." or "Please try not to fuck up for 2 weeks, then we can finally introduce the loot boxes."
---
You are not stuck, unless you make yourself believe that. However, I do hope you find it worth the time spent playing.
---
What about duping?  People have bots setup duping 24x7 since it was found in last patch.  They just going to let that keep going ?
---
In all seriousness did you not find the other secret passage and the ridiculously freaking thing?   You'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen it.  Just take a peek at the walls of the tunnel that led to that room.
---
I run nukacrypt :) Its actually 500 people.
---
Maybe they have robots who read and write to the forums, and also decides the patches.
---
what platform?
---
You completely missed the point of my post
---
Goddamn is that song good. His word choice and melody paint such a vivid picture
---
Someone downvoted this?
---
I support your decision to live in your mother's basement for the rest of your life. But I will gently suggest you get out there and make a move. Date a girl. Get a job. Go for a run. Lean into the distress.
---
Cheers to that One Guy!
---
Nooo....
---
Gary? Is that you Gary?... Gary? Hi Gary! 
---
lmao
---
Not only the glitches and stuff which I can overlook. It's the way they have not communicated appropriately, released a game that is graphically outdated (remember this released within 2 weeks of red dead), released a game that had the same bugs that were in the previous game, provided faulty advertisement, patched and nerfed and brought back past issues. It's like every day there is something. I was sick of people shitting on 76, I won't join them but I do see their point more
---
At the current moment PvP in Fo 76 is built for griefers. When they destroy camps they get nothing except a wanted status. Regardless of how little it costs to repair camps it is still to much when I have to farm rare components to rebuild my camp. 
---
Items dropped into stash do not benefit from your perks.  So fusion cores that weigh 1.2 in your inventory will weight 3.0 in your stash.
---
I always put things into my stash that I either can't live without if I die or that do not benefit from my weight reduction perks.
---
That said, Patch 5 seems to have introduced some bugs having to do with weight reduction perks and items, so I would try unequipping your armor with the -20% food/drink/chems/armor perks and see if that helps.
---
I don't believe in short cuts mister. If I can't figure out the code myself, I didn't earn it.
---
Sheesh.
---
Fixing tse?
---
Can confirm first hand on xbone. Learned about it from YouTuber on PC. Assuming it's on PS4 also
---
Lol bc Bobby pin weight is what’s important here...
---
PS4
---
Yeah, I think they were onto something with this.  I didn't care about settlements in Fallout 4, but give me a fun and easy way to build *my* house and I'm all over that.  And even though you can't build within named locations, it's still far more flexible than 4's predefined lots.
---
Every now and then, I find really neat places for CAMPs and I *want* to build more.  I just wish the budget wasn't so tiny - so I could keep my "forever home" (if only as a blueprint) while still building in other places.  One of the things I appreciate most is just seeing other CAMPs - especially where the owner put in a modicum of effort to make it look nice or blend in with the environment.
---
Please for patch 6 do some work on the tamed animals. I Have 10% of my camp budget locked and even attempting to  tame a new animal can't replace it. (glitch caused it pacified my tamed animal and disconnected, this left it perma pacified and when it died it glitched no longer respawning and locking 10% of my budget.) 
---
Thanks! Stay warm!
---
Thanks for the upvote mate, much appreciated. It would be nice if we had a Firebreathers themed PA paint. Hopefully someone from Bethesda may see this and consider it. I'd be highly stoked if they did :D guess all we can do is cross our fingers and hope. 
---
Someone has max rank White Knight perk today.
---
It’s funny how you put that you can’t contact them because you can’t get into your account. 
---
The way they did the suspensions is crazy. 
---
We can’t log into anything at all. 
---
You want to go to the merch store and spend money? Nope. 
---
You want to see what orders you’ve made or have pending for things you’ve paid for? Nope. 
---
You want to contact them about buying stuff or anything for that matter? Nope. 
---
Shouldn’t it just be that we can’t log into the game?
---
I have to wait the 7-10 days they said it would take to even try to buy limited merch or the t shirt of the month. 
---
If they had a normal beta and done it earlier, they could have fixed some of the issues. Who does a beta right before launch and only makes it active for 4 hours every couple days?  I should have kown then
---
I've killed a lot of legendaries, the only legendary item I ever picked up was a ghoul slayer leather leg.  I assumed they weren't in this game.
---
Exactly as I feel.
---
nope . no reason .just the generic response everyone else is getting accusing me of multiple things. see the full post here where i posted screenshots of there emails .[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aja2yu/psa\_bulking\_items\_could\_get\_you\_banned/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aja2yu/psa_bulking_items_could_get_you_banned/)

Oh god not a little bitch
---
New bugs or even old bugs with every patch :(
---
No problem, looks like you replied to the post I orignally saw this from.
---

Whatever you guys do, dont accidentally manage to just patch out the buffs (and leave the debuffs)
---
Thank you setablaze, it really helps to know this info about xbox one.
---
I'm incredibly sick today, I need something to do besides cough heh.
---
Xb1- I have 0 clippings issues and I love it. It truly stands out in the wasteland.
---
It's up there.
---
Are you kidding me?
---
At this point, I'm convinced you don't even know what Reddit is!
---
This has, quite literally, been mentioned in 10+ posts.
---
Wow! Just Wow!
---
I agree, when the game was talked about at e3 I was against it, then when I finally tried it about a month after release I like it, but they have a lot of work to do
---
&gt;Every game has glitches, but Bethesda games always have more.
---
That's the whole point of this post. This game is a mess and I'm tired of it. I've put many hours into this game and I'm just over the crashes and the constant issues. No game studio should release a game in this state. 
---
You also seem to forget that you don't hold the same opinion as others too. There is a lot of hype brewing for Anthem and I know for sure a lot of people will be leaving this game behind if they haven't already. 
---
Anyone that praises this game is delusional, biggest steaming pile of shit ever released by Bethesda. 
---
[From Merriam Webster](https://i.imgur.com/z3yVchY.png) while it says "especially as a form of punishment or revenge" it is not necessarily always the case like here...
---
Yea, and the minigun and gatling laser deal the least amount of damage amongst heavy weapons (like the ripper, drill, chainsaw, mr.handy buzzblade, etc amongst melee weapons), yet over-repairing those weapons doesn't increase their damage, and no amount of damage buffs make the weapons remotely decent in comparison to the 50 cal lmg or the gatling gun. If over-repairing them did increase their damage, they would probably be brought into line with the other good heavy weapons, like the ripper. 
---
Its. A. Bug. Just because a bug doesn't make the weapon completely broken, doesn't mean it's an intended feature. It's just a fortunate accident as the weapons are tremendously bad otherwise.
---
Can't believe ur still subbed if you think the game is garbage
---
&gt; It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing Patch 5. 
---
^---that is not the same team as QA in most cases. 
---
boo
---
Heals less, satisfies no thirst only hunger. Requires double the corn per soup. And it now needs salt.
---
Scratch that, eating it makes you more thirsty now too. 
---
Yes, non-legendary guns suck.
---
And trying to farm good legendaries is a pitiful exercise in futility.
---
Hence the reason why the black market exists and TSE dupers were rampant.
---
Hint, wait a week and see what the new META is, probably Anti-Armor Explosive or Furious Explosive.
---
Wait for another nuke nerf on AAE or FE.
---
Be sad.
---
Repeat forever.
---
This whole issue could've been fixed with
---
1. SMALL balance adjustments to all the builds.  Small nerf here, small buff there.
---
2. Making it so you could SCRAP legendary items for a 5% chance to pull 1 modifier off that item.  You could then go attach it to any weapon or armor.  Now you can grind your own gear to your liking and you don't need TSE to be the meta for the whole dang game.
---
I have a keypad built into mine, but after I open it there is no clear way to close it, I can’t use the built in switch because the game for some reason won’t let me flip it
---
Tracking that much instance data is likely causing the servers to choke now though - it’s a lot more overhead keeping up to 24 dirreent instances vs just a global instance.
---
&gt; but it’s more grindy then fun at that point.
---
The guy plays fo76, he'll be fine.
---
Because 3 interns made this.
---
Aside from the usual nerfs and bugs. Apparently, the wrong version of the game was patched negating previous patch, and the changes with this patch highlighted problems people have wanted to see more progress on since launch. 
---
Perk changes highlight the need for a better respec option. Price hikes for the plans highlight the annoying vendor cap limits. Weapon nerfs highlight the lack of weapon balance (and the poor respec option again). Requested content (stash box increases, camp budget increases, player vendor bots, passive perks) doesn’t seem to be coming soon..,
---
I think it’s just mounting frustrations, which may or may not be addressed in the near future, that are overwhelming some of ‘last straw’ posters.  
---
Looking into it now. Thanks for linking this mate
---
An innocent player would not try to defend them selves to an internet stranger.
---
The outfits look good.  I’m not really into them though.   I’ll take BOS and enclave skins over those. 
---
You know I just remembered they were apparently fixing the Rad Worms effect because it wasn't working right, I kind of like this new broken though!
---
Took you long enough lmao
---
Oh yeah, that would like real nice hey! I'm a huge fan of the colour red and would like to have something like this in game. I do know there is the red rocket themed pip boy paint.. I think it is, but in my opinion its not very nice and I don't like it.  
---
But something of this caliber would go down really well, I think. 
---
15 shots.
---
That's why I sold my Instigating Dragon.
---
Even if they weren’t, you didn’t explain what the bug is and how it happens/what it affects. 
---
Oh hello riomaik, I remember you from r/fallout! (I have been banned there for 3 years now) 
---
I wasn't a big fan of fallout 4s micromanagey settlement systems either, but liked the concept.
---
Imagine if they made the game open source on Github?
---
That’s too fair of a point
---
If you're launching a nuke, try to invite one of your friends to the server, or to even team with a random. If you get disconnected, you can then pop into that specific server. 
---
Thanks for letting me know mate
---
It was a firefight!
---
Bro do you even pkay the game?
---
Glad you took the time to reply. I appreciate the feedback, and I'll be sure to factor in your input into my next post. Thanks!
---
Taking ownership of an issue is always the best way. Posting Cos play tweets and ignoring your customers is never the answer.
---
You'll be happier moving on.
---
why say should of gone free to play from the start.
---
Bethesda just needed to delay the launch by a month or 2.
---
Either way its still a fun game and there is plenty of stuff to play.
---
It does not, as far as I can tell. I really wish it did. 
---
To be fair, community managers often have very little control over the dev work that goes into a game. I act as a community manager for a non-gaming site, and I can totally sympathize with some of the canned responses. You're acting as a middle~~man~~woman.
---
OP doesn't use the exact wording used in the TOS, went and read it and it goes on to describe what it means. Considering distress is a broad term i understand where youre coming from but its a legal document, they leave it broad because if they dont and something happens that they would be expected to punish but cant because they used a word that doesnt technically mean it they can get in legal trouble for it. I do see what you mean though.
---
Well there's always the Final Fantasy XIV comparison. They don't call it A Realm Reborn because it sounded cool. The game was such dog shit on launch they ended up pulling the plug and going back to the drawing board. Now THAT was a mess. Sure 76 has had a rough couple of months but it takes time to polish a multiplayer. All MMOs end up launching in a bullshit state. And yes Fallout 76 is an MMO. A vanilla one with barely anything to do but it's an MMO none the less.
---
Im past that, im looking for a code piece in watoga
---
People are mad because they're idiots and bought a Bethesda Fallout game expecting it to be a bug free masterpiece that worked perfectly from day one.  No one held a gun to their heads and forced them to buy the fucking game.
---
I was in passive so their little 123 couldn't even kill me. I think the lvl 200 probably had duped legendary armors that maybe made him unkillable like sentinel or cavalier assassin armors. And yeah they were being dicks for no reason at all. 
---
Thank you for a quick hotfix!
---
Merging branches does suck sometimes. We use Perforce at my work, and I merge at least a couple of times a day from trunk. However, giant merges after a big branch gets copied up to trunk can be a huge PITA. I know you guys are working as fast as you can. If you honestly don't have time to write regression tests (writing tests also sucks...), maybe go ahead with the suggested patch-testing server to benefit from free player QA? I'm sure you would have many volunteers. Crowd sourcing is proven to be crap, but I'm sure that some of those players would give quality feedback. Enough to make it worthwhile.
---
Broken is the new functional!
---
A lot of time people who communicate with the public are pretty limited in what the actually \*can\* say, so they don't inadvertently promise stuff that can't be delivered (and all sorts of other reasons). It's really not this guy's fault.
---
That's fair. Hearing about plastic being needlessly used for stuff like this just makes me cringe so hard as a shotguns build. I can never get enough of the stuff. 
---
Having the same problem here. Every time I get into the game, my All Rise stays on the fav wheel but the Super Sledge is out.
---
My wife gets motion sickness having to whip around and look at things while sprinting. The entire section is sprinting in several directions and jumping. It was literally making her sick. 
---
None people are lieing.
---
It says nothing about duping methods re-introduced (the old one, plus the new one).  But instead of speculating, maybe there is something that could communicate that out clearly?  Like some type of community manager that could confirm or deny it will be fixed in next patch?  oh, I guess not.
---
Fair heh.
---
People yelling at community managers in this post and sub is super cringe 
---
Basically, something or someone screwed up and either several pieces of old builds got added into the new version or an old build got the updates that should've been on the build from the Jan 10 update. That's my hot take.
---
1) What platform are you playing on? PC (please include system specs) AMD FX-6300 3.5GHz Cerberus GTX 1060 Ti 4G onboard 16Gb DDR3 1866MHz RAM Windows 10 Pro 2) Bethesda.net : Trillian69
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable) Video : https://streamable.com/c6921
---
4) Description of the issue : Weapon Issues : I tried to kill a number of different mobs using a Tesla Rifle, a Gauss Rifle and an explosive .45 cal sub machine gun and though damage showed on the mobs it instantly went back to full health Challenge Issue : I have taken a number of photos at Red Rocket stops and the weekly challenge is still showing none. I have picked 10 of 2 different flowers, specifically Aster and Wild Carrot and neither shows as being picked.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable) Don't think this needs a ticket.
---
To clarify, my recent report was yesterday but the team has known about it for a while. I'll keep making reports when I see new posts in the subreddit and have reported the same issues previously too.
---
Someone? Nah. Something. Pvp in fallout isn't even a thought for me. Just an inconvenience. If I wanted pvp, I'd go play an actual pvp game. 
---
I blow myself up with my own gun isn't a risk man. It's just being dumb. 
---
Oh, well it does give the reason in the email:
---
&gt;exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication
---
I guess your only recourse would be to reply to the email and say that you believe your account was flagged in error and give an explanation of why.
---
try linking some CM's into the thread through a comment (not mine they will ignore). 
---
I've read a couple of threads where they appear to have helped...i say appear as i don't even believe they are actual people at this point, the amount of content and ignorance they show towards customers is unreal!
---
What platform are you on?
---
I swear to god the end game content is fighting scorched beasts naked with pipe rifles. 
---
Same same. Ballistic fiber.
---
Of course I would. It was a joke because of the Nerf hammer.
---
That's OK, gatlings break in 20 seconds anyway.
---
Yup decon showers not cheap to repair 
---
QA doesn't merge and deploy builds. And I guess I am in the "know" I work at an IT company, working with and handling defects in our software.
---
So where are you getting your "In the know" info from?
---
Same. Give me a little cash and the beta and I will find out how to break it. 
---
I'm not sure if this is of any help, but I don't use the launcher.
---
I just run the FO76.exe from the game folder. Sure, the game asks you for a login, but it's also one less thing tying up resources on my system. That being said, you need to run it to keep the game up to date, so if you're outdated, I'm sure you're unable to connect to the server.
---
I have the same problem with the marsupial too, maybe healing factor as well but I need to confirm it first.
---
It's a fairly decent sized budget once you get the idea of how much budget each think takes up. Like about 2-3 lights are about 1% of the budget and the normal weakest turrets take up I think 10% while missile turrets take 15%. So as long as you dont use turrets you can build a decent amount. Also if you haven't figured it out yet the turrets are truly awful and a waste
---
Yeah, the changes to how stealth works in PVE has been drastic and have essentially killed the fun for me.
---
Lmao if you were banned or console banned you would of got that enforcement thing when you signed in. I'm banned til 6th of february for communication
---
wut?

Well apparently not since you're commenting here

That's the problem I'm having.
---
"hardcore camp stuff"
---
Are you being serious rn 
---
I was once like him... 76 leaned me out for the better. 
---
You can dox yourself nobody said you cant, the point of the word is for a very specific type of leak, intended or not, which contains private personally identifiable information? Even still why are you defending Bethesda in this argument of semantics? They don't deserve your defense.
---
No but you should wire it through a terminal so it’ll work the way you want it to
---
Never leave your decontamination station out. All I can say until they fix it.

Assaultron head:
---
The Assultron head uses all your ammo in one shot, with out the damage of each ammo. That's not shooting as well as any weapon. That's worse than all other weapons. 
---
-Plasma Weapons: Plasma Goo Bug Many corpses are rendered unlootable with endless "Loading" icon.
---
-Tesla Variations: Mainly (only ever seen used) to ensure "hits" in group / raid settings. Weight of weapon is ridiculously high for something made primarily of plastic, and damage is terrible. FO4 it was an excellent Idea, but only ever used in game if a mod adjusted damage.
---
There's a bug-roundup thread from a week ago.... That'd be a MUCH better place to start rather than asking endless users for their preference.

Radium Rifle:
---
    To unlock all the different mod types the player needs to scrap this weapon by the hundreds.
---
Reporting on patch notes before any issues are noticed in game? It's not like the patch notes say, "Oh yeah, a bunch of shit is messed up." I get that you have a hate boner for the guy, but come the fuck on dude.
---
1. PS4

2. pi-rightponderer

3. N/A
---
4. Recipes and plans that are unknown by my secondary character but are known by my primary character are tagged as (Known) for my secondary character. Can still click "learn" to learn the plans and recipes, but the issue negates the whole point of the tag.
---
Wow. As someone that is still enjoying the game, it's pretty clear that this community is no longer fit for me. Take care everyone. 
---
You forgot the mention the guy drilling people in the butt at whitespring.  That guy contributes.
---
PC? Had the same problem. If you have the mod Save My Stuff, that's what caused it for me.
---
Take care
---
PC, forgot to mention that, sorry.
---
yep, not so much damage and long charging up to level 5 + self radiation damage.
---
Bird Bones can help. You can also stow/draw your weapon just before landing to cancel out the animation. That said, I'd be down for a leg mod that either reduces the stagger or increases the height required for the stagger.
---
This has happened to me on the past 3 or so base moves I have made. Not really upset as I just broke down both plans wanting to start fresh. It actually kind of helped me out as it gave me extra built walls/floors/foundations/etc. to build my new base! I just scrapped anything that isn't very useful or overboard like workbenches, extra doors and such (don't necessarily need 100 wood floors either, ha!). The bug 'blessing in disguise' I have looked at it!
---
So they merged it before QA then? or after? 
---
Thank you for both the transparency and for working through this stuff. Very much appreciated!
---
And 7000 active on reddit
---
... but how many are (able to) actively playing the game?
---
Thank you for letting me know about this dan
---
I have quit...  but they already have my money, so why would they give a shit?
---
Seems more like a lukewarm fix. Hotfixes should come out sooner than a week later. 
---
I'm on Kingdom Hearts 3 now. Super stoked. 
---
I'm so let down by 76 I wanted so badly for it to be the fallout I have always wanted.  Uninstalling today sucked but I just can't play it anymore.
---
Ah rip yeah with big stuff I never throw the receipt away.
---
[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/algzkj/rad_worms_bug_post_jan_29th_patch/) illustrates it pretty clearly. 
---
This is literally one of the only situations where the obsessive grinding this game demands is actually helpful.
---
On a serious note, happy to hear it helps you out, I can only imagine it ain't easy dealing with.
---
Almost there boys
---
ya. i already did this . no one else has been getting a response . and if they have they are not sharing it . 
---
And i don't want a personal apology of this guy, but hes a face for Bethesda whilst hes acting as a CM for them no?
---
We at Bethesda are working very hard........bla bla bla BS 
---
The fact remains that this is a PvE game.  No one PvPs.  Some of us have put 300 hours into this game, trading and saving caps for our endgame weapons.  A level 161 character should absolutely one shot most shit level enemies.  Do you really want to get into a firefight with a level 20 supermutant?  Having to shoot them 10 times to take them down? 
---
I'm all for a nerf on PvP.  Level the playing field.  But taking away from high level players who have spent months getting to that point?  On a PvE server?  That doesn't make the game better.  We don't want to grind more. 
---
Monkey at a typewriter 'It was the best of times, it was the blurst of time'. Todd Howard beats him 'stupid monkey'
---
If this is how they react to everything, their lives must be utterly exhausting. 
---
I get a 3-4 second delay when I crouch before the indicator appears. And it's often incorrect, showing caution/danger when I'm alone. Before the patch it was instantaneous and accurate.
---
Happens on xbox too
---
It's weird cause you can choose which version you want but it chooses the current patch. They totally could have the option for a BETA version.
---
Grahm. I dont know if it changed from the patch tho
---
I suppose I could write a bot....
---
I can verify that bobby pin weight is back to 0.1 each. I do not recall the bulked item problem was present previously. I have personally not seen any evidence at all that the core production and duping are back, just rumors.

I'm not lying when I tell you that not even those form a problem.

I agree with pretty much all you said. As a standalone Multiplayer game, Fallout 76 is bad. Like, chewing glass and jalapeño peppers bad. The only thing that would keep it afloat would be Fallout Fans, and 76 is, to put it mildly, not appreciated by at least half of us.
---
I understand, but I've played through the games multiple times and some.how.he always has something I've never seen or missed and I'm like well shit look at that! Damn how did you figure that out Oxy you ol' bastard.
---
Thanks for confirming Deno - I've let the team know that this isn't an isolated issue 
---
It probably wont trigger when you get to 7600 hours anyways ;)
---
There is a perk in intelligence called contractor or constructor or something along those lines that decreases the material cost to build so the decon shower is dropped down to about 2-3 of each flux. Unless they changed it in recent patches it works when you repair things as well
---
Bought mine for grahm yesterday for 182 caps, was surprised they were so cheap, haven't looked yet to see if it worked,
---
Yeah I tried it, it works, thanks. Sadly I made the mistake of storing the door, and now I can’t place it again. Rip my next hour of free time
---
I was smiling the entire time playing. Game seems like it's going to be amazing already.
---
&gt;the countless hours it takes to get them
---
But it dosen't take countless hours to get them not anymore.
---
&gt;t in TSE weapons I payed caps I earned for. Bethesda development shouldn’t be let within 10 feet of the disc of a multiplayer game never mind make one after this game. Total and co

How is everyone spending dozens and hundreds of hours in a game they hate?  Either you enjoyed that time, or you spent that time doing something you didn't enjoy. ????

I feel your pain. 20% of it.

I've heard better defenses from GTA 5 DOJ role play videos.

Interesting. Let's hear it then. What's the exact wording?

---
Yeah I assumed he was using a duped set of armor like that and didn't bother fighting. As others said he prob also has 0 caps so you wouldn't get anything even if you did.
---
Mine's working but weird sometimes after the patch. At peak height my character was switching to a running animation for a second, as though I stepped on a ledge mid-air, and then it returns to the falling animation.  A relog fixed it though.
---
still wrong. but you do you.
---
Todds Anus?
---
Thought you would go with "The dev room"...
---
The pumpkin patch can be tough. There's a fissure site nearby, so the SB will pretty much always be hovering around.
---
why do you have 189 bobby pins? you only need like 10
---
thing is, bethesda's games couldn't , I REPEAT, couldn't survive without community fixes mod. ever since Morrowind, and hell now there is cult classic still waiting for Daggerfall Unity, has been fixing the same bugs all over till Fallout 4. I think, bethesda's really that arrogant egoistic to use unofficial patch mod to fix their own fucking game, now with FO76?? heh don't think modding community would help them... 
---
You SEE the comment but what does that mean for the community? A majority of your fan base thats holding on hope for this game, and still spending  time and money deserve a better or more detailed response. This has to be brought up the Bethesda chain of command and some direct answers need to come to us. Alot of people have their help tickets SEEN but never answered from the company so seeing does nothing for us anymore.
---
While I understand the pretty justifiable frustrations people are having, sometimes I remind myself that there is someone on the other side of that screen and hope you are dealing with this ok. It is not an enviable position.
---
Thanks for your understanding. We're definitely making sure we look into how this happened so it doesn't happen again.

Why, this ginless grinch wastes your ballistic fiber.
---
i played for 290 hrs..a lot of those hours grinding for legendaries..and only a few days ago i got my first tse drop..so it took me nearly 300 to get 1 tse drop...and even then it was a laser pistol lol
---
No radworms for me, but i have this issue.
---
I have a red tactical headlamp for my T-45 helmet, and apparently it's a mothman themed item now.
---
&gt;One day I met a level 4 who had 64 TSE pump shotguns on him he got from farming white springs.
---
oh, boy.
---
Yeah, I get what they were trying to do.  I just don't think they got there.
---
To me, the Workshops in 76 are a better expression of that idea.  You can take a Workshop and use the resource extractors to get things you need.  The Defend objectives are predictably timed and not obnoxious.  And I believe the game acts out the whole attack, rather than using a lame RNG system to determine who won.
---
Because the settler NPCs in 4 were such clones, it made the whole process feel impersonal.  In 76, at least I'm getting something out of building all this stuff.
---
You my friend.... are hilarious.
---
That's a silly reason to nerf the weapons of people who got them legitimately.
---
fireproof + dense is enough.
---
So in your definition, it's only P2W when it's permanent? You can't P2W for just a week? Are you daft? What's stopping them for doing this every week now? They're trying to use a loophole, it's bullshit pure and simple. Once again Bethesda proves they lie, and once again one of their fanboy's is here to defend their bullshit. 
---
Only if the dev's are in there.
---
You can have it. I'm on PS4, Eastern Standard. Send a pm for gamer tag.
---
I don't mind the TSE nerf but boy does that melee need a nerf as well. Went on a nuked White Springs run with a friend and the tables have indeed turned. He was 1-2 shotting glowing ones with his Deathclaw gauntlet while I was desperately trying to keep up with my TSE pea shooting Gauss. 
---
Can u hook me up too? 
---
Ah, I see you lack the ability to multitask.
---
Much luck to you, brother. May you wander to complete satisfaction and have an easier time afterwards as well.
---
There are a number of different methods you can use to bring power upstairs, but I’ve personally found it’s oftentimes easier to have a generator above and bring power below. Conduits are much easier to wire through floors up to down than down to up. 
---
You have to scrap the bulk now 
---
I’m level 7.
---
However I have spent countless time dealing with crashes and mostly server disconnects. Change my internet settings (which were  fine to being with) uninstall reinstall (three times), contact Bethesda (countless times), looking at help in the forums etc.
---
Huge waste of time.
---
Begged for a refund and nothing.

Bethesda could care less about me so why should I even care again about them?
---
Good to actually know what type of company this is.
---
Way too many good games out there to play than to even deal with this again.
---
The team is actively working on it as we speak, but we want to give you as much transparency and honesty as possible regarding timeframes. As soon as we have a more concrete timeline we'll absolutely let you all know.
---
Isn't the dev room geographically placed near goodsprings? It probably already gets nuked on a regular basis
---
I'm starting to realize something that is completely obvious: people have fun in different ways!
---
Personally, running around one-shotting every enemy and player I see would be incredibly boring and possibly even aggravating. I would consider that balance to be bad and the lack of challenge a design flaw. 
---
However, clearly there are other players, such as you OP, who enjoy  simply blowing things up. Playing a game that I would consider "easy" is perfectly fine for them.
---
It is unfortunate that both of these types of players cannot be satisfied by Fallout 76. Other games have managed this, such as World of Warcraft, but it took them years to get to a point that they could even remotely cater to both groups.  
---
I had 200+ and it was annoying for them to just change it that fast while the one for it haven’t even lasted a month(afaik) mainly because it ruined my carry weight 
---
They f'd up the patch. You need to scrap bulk for it to be usable
---
posted links in description 
---
I see lack the ability to be constructive to this post. 
---
Wait, are you saying TSE users need to have...a...build? Get outta here you joker!
---
As much as I don't want to believe you, this game is such a cluster fuck that what you are saying could be true.
---
Interesting because I didnt have the issue last patch and I also used auto rifles. 
---
not to mention the nerf of the perk demolition expert which lowers tse damage even further..my tse combat shotgun..(that someone gave me)..went from 720 damaģe down to 220
---
ill need your psn name.  
---
Buy plans for only 20,000 atoms.
---
I feel like a chump for preordering this dumpster fire, I played enough to get to level 65 and quit early on when they were still huge bugs and stuff in the game, there was really no draw for me to play after 60ish idk why but i stopped and haven’t come back yet don’t think i ever will great game Bethesda :(
---
"they might not make it to 7600 hours boss..... let's nerf their weapons to death so they have to play longer."
---
But for any 1 I use, there are 4 I'm not, and if I'm in the middle of fighting a Scorchbeast, I'm not going to have time to go back and rejigger my cards.
---
It's just there for you to track how much play time you have across your characters. It's not rocket science
---
Thats prob It I think I did have rad worms. 
---
Yes I'm going up to down but how can I get power from one conduit upstairs to one downstairs without building them down the staircase?
---
Just called having a backbone, give it a go sometime.
---
Vendors share caps. You have to sell to different faction vendors to get money fast.
---
I get this off and on, though most recently it's just the Torso that would never equip. Went on for a couple of days last week.  
---
Seems like it possibly correlates to having extra power armor parts in my inventory. Like I noticed it started happening and then realized I had gotten a spare t-51b arm or something as a quest reward. As far as I know, when I got rid of the extra arm it went back to normal.
---
Pc in Australia, I've been to queen runs where she dies in 30 seconds, there's a vats build out there where a guy solos  the queen in 2 minutes with a std combat rifle and combat shotgun, no gun perks and the guns are only 50 and 70 damage, it's insane
---
I can confirm this! Just recreated it twice and experienced the same results 
---
Only seen Wally last time around
---
maybe theyll split it with you.  
---
Wooow I feel your pain, I’ve had two of my best pieces taken from my inventory, both were charmelon 3* with weapon weight reduce so I was very cross because i had a full set of beautiful weapon weight armor. Do you know where I could acquire the hunter’s hood?
---
Gotcha. Bowie knife OP. Will start petitioning Bethesda to nerf it asap. Should take them 4 months to get around to it.
---
Honestly the nerf was too much
---
I completly agree, after the last patch when they made some of my weapons go from doing 1200 dmg to 500 and some from 500 to 130 im done. It took me so long grinding nukes and getting caps to buy the rest, to eventually get most of the best weapons in the game so everything wasnt a bullet spounge. When i got on and seen they literally destroyed my shit i exited the game and wont touch it until maybe years down the line. Its a huge let down, ive been supporting them even though of all the bugs and hate but im done. Its rediculous, the game needs balance not hard core nerfs, gives you nothing to look forward to getting end game. Goodbye fallout 76, you tryed. 
---
I’ve never had a TS rifle before so can u pls enlighten me on how it’s useless for sniper rifles? I was hoping to one day find a TS/instigators or TS/bloodied The Dragon for my sneak sniper build
---
Bethesda why did you kill da memes!
---
All i hoped for was to kill someone with a teddy bear. Plz put the junk jet in the game.
---
Save meme.
---
Let me live. I haven't lived yet.
---
I play xbox my gt is JoshuaEM2005.
---
Am I the only one who farms sentry bots for cores? The ones in Whitespring give 75% or more 
---
How can I see what you have?
---
Man, you people are insufferable. Do you just sit there while Bethesda shits in your mouth, and be sure to say thank you after as well? 
---
Maybe one day you will realize you are not helping the cause you seek, only deluding yourselfs into believing there is nothing wrong at all.
---
Dont @ me.
---
Greg’s mine supply?
---
"now"
---
pfff
---
Thanks for the feedback - we're working as hard as we can to make sure there's transparency for you all.
---
One is near the top of the savage divide.
---
is it a "fuck up" or just a game design change that people had a tantrum over
---
The fact that you expect anything consumer oriented to come out of a corporation is a joke. 
---
Any one who talks about losing respect for BGS or being disappointed in them or any other major corporation is a naive fool. 
---
Corporations give zero fucks about their fans. Zero. If you think otherwise, you're out of your mind. Even when they seem to care, fans aren't the motivation. It's money. Always money.
---
GIT BLAME
---
They nerfed TSE "builds".  My non-TSE weapons are still working perfectly fucking fine and kill shit no problem.  Just because you can't one shot a room full of shit any more doesn't mean EVERYTHING got nerfed.
---
Here's photos of the Red Rocket challenge I took today, Jan. 30 2019

Well, I was managing them before. I kept the number under 25. Once the weight reduction occurred, I stopped checking. So I accumulated a few in drops from legendary ghouls.
---
Can confirm this issue is present on Xbox console as well. So I assume it’s present on all platforms. 
---
No, fuck that. They need to QA their shit like a real developer.
---
That's not accurate, I think even you can sort that out. 
---
Thank you for sharing your opinion. I am sorry that you feel the way you do and that at your age and with a life time full of wisdom you have nothing better to do than get mad at reddit posts and make trollish statements about millennials. Hope you have a nice day/night.
---
That is a shame....
---
Lol yeah that was the only way for them to implement a feature that tracks your progress /s 
---
You’re a special boy aren’t you?
---
That’s what I did, but It wouldn’t let me flip the switch so I couldn’t close it
---
I would LOVE TO! If i wasnt banned from the game currentlylol  . im on PC also. 
---
that they actually work now? that was in the patch.
---
THIS GAMER KNOWS HOW TO RISE UP
---
I don't understand why so many people were expecting multiplayer Fallout 4.
---
Could explain some of the decision making on thier part
---
Calibrated shocks already sounds like something that should help with the impact tbh. Or explosive vents, that would actually give purpose to the thousands of ultracite explosive vent plans everybody leaves on the ground.
---
Any guns/armor/mats u can spare?

---
This is a link to the build 
---
I have a spreadsheet and also if you look at post history
---
Could be part of it I'll try removing it. I seem to crash every nuke zone but usually I get to play it for more than 2 kills.
---
Anytime mate
