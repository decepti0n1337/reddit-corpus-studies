Cheers. All good now. My fault. Thanks for the assistance.

Because it is p2w, you are so stupid lololoo!!!
---
There's like 3 interesting legendary effects and that's it, but more cool things with them aren't needed?
---
Read the cards.  Each has 3 stars and tells you what percentage they are when full
---
I have a lvl 35 explosive cryolator in my stash from back when they still were in the game
---
Just because he's dead, doesn't mean he didn't live on long enough to do more things that we could eventually stumble upon (ie: isn't released yet).
---

---
Just sayin' :)
---
Also lets not forget about the still-powered time machine^(\*) in the Cranberry Bog. We could literally rip him from the past and put him in our time, still alive! :D

I noticed that a while back, it's a fun feature, shame the robot counter doesn't change...

Now that would be great! Although it would be flipping a lot with the constant killing of the robots lmao
---
Just north of Harper's Ferry is a junk pile. https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2184
---
There's a giant power pylon just uphill from it that has open water, so if you put the camp in the right spot you can get the junk pile and enough water to throw in 3-4 big purifiers.  
---
Just down the hill is a spawn point that triggers high level wendigos and/or anglers, and the bridge south of that has a high chance of spawning either a hermit crab or a bunch of high level mutants.
---
I never said everyone with high end stuff is a cheater. I did say people can be good at the game, or they have duped stuff.
---
This is a silly thing to do. Everyone complains about the mutations, legendary effects ect. This would only solve the problem of powerful duped weapons for maybe a month or two. Then everyone would be super high level again with crazy legendaries. Best thing to do is make a SEASONAL game mode similar to Diablo 3. Every few months we get a new character to work on while still having our original adventure/survival characters. 
---
TL:DR let's not restart because it's silly, take the diablo 3 path instead 👌
---
For that price it should come with a group of super mutants who do free installations because they are working to pay back their vault tech university student loans.
---
The lamp shall light the path to glory!
---
Yeah but he is above the calibre of say P.AM. or a lot other AI and Bots we have met. he has actually developed his own opinions and feelings, learnt from previous experiences and has been able to reconcile with his trauma. I think it's a little unfair for the guy to just label him off as a bot and make it seem as he doesn't have as much character as other characters in the Fallout Universe.
---
Now if only I could tame something.... I had a sloth once, but after he passed away I’ve not been able to tame anything else, game wont let me, all conditions met.
---
Only the Brightest and most glorious!
---
This is basically what legendary effects are... Pretty sure theyll eventually have more, considering there are 5 stars but no ones ever gotten more than a 3 star.
---
Everyone starting a new lvl 0 character seasonally sounds good to me.
---
No problem. I’m getting lots of hits on my dating apps. When you’re ready to get back out there I recommend RaidersOnly.com or PlentyOfGulpers.
---
Imagine using a feature that's already there.  IMAGINE IT.  Go ahead.  Do it.
---
Just because they have more character than other AI, doesn't mean they are not also AI though.
---
But there's a free version in game. Assuming this is a joke though. Good one, you half got me lol
---
I just see there being a problem with there being so few interesting endgame items to chase. Once everybody gets the legendaries they want, (not that it is easy only being able to roll a lousy 3 a day) they had better come up with some killer playable content or people are going to get bored again super fast. I personally love having awesome items in games that take a while to earn and feel powerful and crazy to use after.
---
Precisely, people find a way to dupe in seasonal? Too bad that character is getting deleted soon anyway and you can't keep the gear in adventure.
---
Can’t we just get a super mutant construction company to do the work for us? I personally am tired of doing all the heavy lifting! Those damn mutants have such big muscles make them do it! 
---
Make the wasteland great again!
---
Or have it one way. You can transfer items from a survival character to a adventure character but not the other way.
---
No I understand that it is AI but the subtext was that because it's AI and therefore robotic it's not the same Calibre of NPC we have recieved from previous Fallouts
---
If seven dollars is so much money to you that you're concerned about where it goes, then no.  You shouldn't be buying video games.
---
I already had 0 karma this is my first post so eh 😂
---
I fucking love this story so much.
---
Calm down. Make sure the Grapshics is set ti Full Screen and NOT the Windowed mode ;)
---
It's not really pricey when you can get 5000 atoms for $40 instead of 4000 atom for $40.
---
Go ask them, we know nothing more than you.
---
...aaaaand in next patch they'll nerf power fist to deal only 25% of the current damage because they don't want to buff deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I scrip assassin's crap all the time
---
and bodies hanging from chains on the ceiling.
---
Cap increase when? They're balancing this game and releasing content in fear of dupers which really sucks. I'm 100% positive scrip cap is also so low because of dupers. Really sad honestly.
---
Guess it's time for you to spread the love around...be Appalachia's philanthropist! You'll get a statue built in your honor lol.
---
Could be possible easily. There's already a bind on pickup mechanic - try dropping the camera and it'll tell you that it will be destroyed and not dropped. Could still sell them to the conscript machine too I'd say. But yeah, 4+ stars for end game content, with 3 star gearing though the conscript system. That sounds reasonable. Probably at that point there would be updates to the legendary vendor or a new one for the higher star equipment - possibly a second currency.
---
Mine looks like the pictures
---
From what I’ve heard you can’t tame some creatures anymore and I think deathclaws and sloths are  on that list. I do know they made it to where you need another perk card to work and you have to walk right up next to them. It won’t work through aiming at them anymore. I miss my deathclaw.
---
RIP Little Claw and condolences on your sloth may it Rest In Peace!
---
F
---
It’s been an issue since Fallout 4, unfortunately.
---
It's like saying "what's to stop someone from making a tower base with vendors at the top, filling them with low priced junk and waiting for someone to make a big purchase. Then when they get ready to leave just log out and have your friend cannibalize them when they go down from fall damage. then you get your junk back and caps."  
---
there will always be a way to skirt social norms, but adding a way for thieves to think twice is always a +1 in my book. Not to mention that bounties are dead. there is no penalty for being a \*richard cranium\* in adventure anymore.
---
Wrong Event, it's not Heart of the Swamp that gives those out. Unless they changed that in Patch 9.5?
---
The one you're thinking of... or if changed in 9.5, the one that originally gave them out... is called "Death Blossoms" and it's only available in The Forrest region (where as Heart of the Swamp takes place in The Mire).
---
Usually we get 5 when someone completes that event, but why I even questioned the plausibility of it being added to that event in 9.5, is because recently I ended up with only 3 in my inventory... Which left my scratching my head as to where I would've gotten just 3 from. I pay enough attention to what I loot that I'm 99% sure I wouldn't have picked them up intentionally. Mainly due to not knowing about their usage in the Diffusers until /u/kayakbob75​'s post, below lol
---
When you still can't get over 100 caps.
---
No joks, ur just dumb! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 if u can pay for in game advantage thats p2w!! 😉😉😉😘😘😘🤣😂 lol this dude is so dumb @everyone downvote him!
---
Came here to say this.
---
Wait, thats illegal
---
The lowest you can go is 1
---
How have you passed rock bottom
---
And is it possible to learn this power?
---
I think I had read once that shielded raider underarmor plans have a chance to drop from Savage Divide events. I could be wrong, however.
---
Log out and back in and see if that helps.
---
Could be a rendering issue.
---
Hrmm. I don't think mine is right. I'm on XB, so nothing should be changing mines appearance, but I mean **bright** white.
---
Only way I would support an increase in stash is if they charged us say 25k caps to increase it but 200lbs.
---
I am! ::begging, pleading, crying, praying::
---
I dont think class action is the right way to go here.  They neber promissed a bug free game, in fact rhey promissed spectacular bugs and a period where they would learn to work with the new sytems and grow with the game.
---
I do think change would be a good thing for the industry though. It could come in the form of a third party rating system that could certify certain games as "bug lite" or from consumers refusing to buy game that we didnt have proff were ready for release. Mabey we could push for legislation that required extensive beta peeiods before companies could take money from consumers or not buy games that don't do this.
---
As it stands fallout 76 was and is what they claimed it was. Change in the industry would still be a good thing.
---
Have all colours on ps4 and all available to purchase
---
So your the guy taking all the golf balls!?!
---
I would say charge us 25k caps to increase it an additional 200. Some people would pay it and some wouldn't. That's a nice cap sink
---
I think they meant they don't count as *human* NPCs, which was the whole hook of Fallout 76 to begin with. In the same way that BIV is a robot despite having a very animated personality
---
Wow
---
The Top Shop
---
"We're the Tops"
---
(Outside Top of the World station of course)
---
It's an ok game with many problems/issues. Get over your fucking whining.
---
But I’d think the app would be available to everyone, like it was for fallout 4.
---
Yes, altogether you can have 3 cards totaling 60%
---
I tried. It's still the same glaring white :(
---
That’s literally what Sanjay is
---
too many times ..
---
kill on sight ..
---
Twice by mistake. 8 more times by "mistake"
---
Yea, it’s been said already but there’s a damage minimum you have to hit.
---
I’m not the one whining.   But thank you for your feeble attempt at a comeback.  It will give me something to laugh at later.
---
Sure does
---
I dunno about that one, I think MODUS clearly has a higher qaulity of writing, including background and current characteristics that would definitely earn him as equal or greater to a lot of other fallout series npc. I know he isn't human but definitely ranks among the other sentient AI
---
You sir are the MVP, thanks for the heads up!
---
I see you too are a man of culture
---
I find if there are a large amount of players taking her out the circle will appear more often. I just go collect elsewhere. Kill more baddies and return. Always loot. From months ago to today.
---
I haven’t even hit a thousand yet
---
Read your title.  Read your text.  No misapprehension on my part.   Now take your class action bullshit and shove it.
---
Yong is a twat that recites other people's reddit posts for money on youtube
---
There are teleportation ladders in game but you mean one that shows a animation to climb?
---
Imagine repairing all and it’s greyed out because of a crap mutfruit plant you never use....

Lvl 61 deathclaws have never been tamable.

 "The first half ***or*** even all of vanilla WoW" 
---
Look up what the word 'or' means please.
---
[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/or](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/or)
---
I happen to have enjoyed Vanilla WoW, and I felt the first release and several patches were very rough. Towards the end of its release and before the first expansion it became good.
---
Not everyone agrees obviously.
---
But I am not stupid enough to think that someone saying "tea or coffee" is meaning they are going to be bringing me both tea and coffee.
---
again, no one is disagreeing with that, but MODUS is definitely *not* a flesh and blood human NPC and still is classified as Artificial Intelligence, no matter how well written and deep the character of MODUS is.
---
I don't know why I hadn't tried this much befire but I just ran through nuked Whitesprings in redular armor using diluted Rad-x and Radshield and I barely took any radiation.
---
If getting overwhelmed regularly is what's stopping you from doing this, try doing a long, mid, and close range attempt, try and take out  or damage severely the higher levels with sniper or precise rifles. An automatic gun to clear mobs, or thin them out at least. And finally a good knife for close quarters to deal with the leftovers. A good set of armor wouldn't be a bad idea either.
---
really, i wasnt know that.
---
That doesn't answer the question
---
Just kind of a thought,  but what if MODUS fabricated all of these notes and stories about himself (itself?).  He may be locked up just as Mr House and just playing the role.  
---
Just saying,  if that's the case I have a mini nuke with his name on it
---
I like that idea
---
I might
---
People have said this. I had other Power Armor chassis and I put them down and none  of them were it. I'm hoping maybe next time I log in I just magically find it named something else bu tI am pretty sure it was gone.
---
Thanks
---
Right, I forgot about the sentry bot. Ironsides, I think. As for MODUS, I must have missed that.
---
Two good points you make!
---
I agree that he is not of flesh and blood, I just disagree with a lot of the communities sentiment that He is just another robot npc quality
---
Have you finished all of your badges yet, though?
---
You're genuinely upset over pixels in a video game...?
---
Exactly!
---
Wait. Is that what they're for?!??
---
Nah the damage of the enclave bunker and various holotapes and the whole backstory to the whitesprings definitely portray him as being truthful, you could say that he fabricated that but then again why would he need us to help be able to repair him back to near full glory?
---
Guilty :-(
---
Yes, how could you have gotten enough badges to “pay” for all the possum merch???
---
Either that or shooting Ferals in the mouth.
---
Not a new idea, been posted here already many times, and won't fix anything for more than a week. 
---
More importantly, none of the questline bears repeating.
---
I don't think anyone is arguing that he is "just another robot npc quality" just stating that he is *classified* as an AI NPC for the purposes of Fallout 76, which had the hook of no flesh and blood *human* NPCs. Just because something is in the same category, doesn't mean they are just like the other characters in their class
---
Thank you
---
Early on keep it real simple, easier to move and rebuild even if no blueprints. Move w main quest, Forrest 1st, maybe asheap, you can skip toxic valley if you want, and Savage Devide is imho the sweet spot. Everybody hates them but so easy, build one foundation put a stairway on it and build your camp off the top of staircase, ugly but utilitarian.
---
    When you buy a legendary from Mrrmmnrm or whatever, it is Always  top lvl for that weapon or armor, 45 or 50, so you've a while to wait.  1000 point scrip limit.
---
     Do events. Beware of too high a lvl though, no Encrypted or scorthed Earth for now.
---
     Pick a main weapon class, stick to it perkwise. Just like all old games too much hunt and peck and not enough planning leaves you with lvls and lvls of Respec to have a good endgame experience.
---
     Treasure maps, and workshops for plans. Scrap alot of your favorite weapon types to get the good mods (silencer)  Anti armor rocks as a stat, mod or legendary.
---
   1000 other things but see you in the wasteland.😎
---
$18? 😂  I'm good.
---
I'm also on xbox and mine is the correct silver/chrome color.
---
Wait but people do actually complain that tho, there are dozens of threads and comments that suggest there is no qaulity npc just robots (there is definitely subtext to that) and they feel they can only relate to Grahm or the purveyor
---
No it doesn't but it's always so much fun to say.
---
I imagine that because they extended the deadlines to file a ticket the date was pushed back the delivery date will slide back some as well.
---
That's a good point. I did the quest line twice and the thought of doing it again isn't pleasant
---
oh they are. I'm trying to find the neon letters myself
---
The one way link would be a great idea but an idea I thought of would be to complete each mission you have to drop or rather place a beacon at the top of a certain area within the quest location so that way people can’t complain “how does he know it’s done”
---
I am fine sir!
---
Nope, I'm good.
---
It took almost 25 minutes for mine to finally render the right silver texture. Not sure what was going on.
---
Shoot me a message on xbox  if you see me on, my gamertag is same as username.. I will see what u got for sale and maybe try to help you out on pricing.. I like the idea of just trading but there is to many untrustworthy people in the game.
---
If you read what Todd said, he explicitly admitted that we got something *worse* than Bethesda originally described. That means Bethesda had full knowledge of releasing a broken, incomplete product for full price while originally saying *the week it released* that it would possibly be "rather buggy". Any of us playing from the very start knows how bad it was, and with no compensation.
---
Again, *like the game or not* (and I do moreso than not), *there are laws against this corporate behavior* and Bethesda is not only getting a *huge* pass on their irresponsibilitly, but paving the way for the entire industry to do so at will.
---
Happened to me yesterday except it was the insult bot all I heard was "Target acquired" and I shot the daylights out of him
---
Doesn't change the fact that it was a hook of 76. Todd made a big deal of it at the E3 conference, with the idea being that the other players become the Human NPCs that you trade with or take on as a companion. It was a huge part of the marketing.
---
Later on it was discovered just how empty it felt without actual human NPCs, but again, this doesn't change what the initial hook was.
---
Campfire tales, Cleanup Kiddy Corner, Bug parts quest.
---
Nope, I feel the same. I’m usually wearing an outfit that covers my armor anyway
---
If you think people aren't gonna be posting their canvas bags all over social media when they finally arrive, you are wrong. Why do you think this game wants you to take pictures constantly? They want those pictures on social media to attract new players. The canvas bags will generate articles when they finally arrive, expect Ars Technica to write something like "the fallout 76 canvas bags are finally here! But was it worth the wait?" or some other clickbait title.
---
You got badges for those? I’ve only gotten badges from completing the challenges.
---
If using solar powered perk itll decrease when the sun goes down. Happens to me when im just on the brink of being over encumbered
---
I'd be good with no legendary gear or mutations in survival and actually be skill based
---
Well I basically Baught all available power armour skins and paints and go figure I’m lvl 220 now and I don’t use power armour anymore... so how’s that for wasted money eh !
---
More or less impossible to "find" . He is like a radstorm, an un natural event.  Follllowed by the sweetest moo moo in the all Appalachia.
---
I think that sounds alright toi
---
Why
---
4k bucks lol.also ppl gave me items for free.!
---
That's odd. System?
---
People been getting mails saying that duffle bag is almost ready and will be shipped soon
---
dailies and campfire stories. There is a chance to get bage
---
Yes
---
Really? Crap. What kind of chance? Lol
---
I love how creative ppl get with the camp feature
---
I never disagreed that's a hook? I'm just emphasizing that people are down playing MODUS as just another robot npc therefore are not able to empathise and sympathise with?
---
If u have one for sale I will trade a tse handmade for it it’s the last camp plan I need in the game
---
Lol, that's all I've ever done with mine. Never thought of trying to signal other players with them showing on the map 
---
Might be useful in survival to call people in for a fight????
---
I play survival, and was using a non legendary handmade. It did well again non legendary armored ppl. I ditched 4 legendary handmades with various effects as I dont like relying on legendary gear to win..
---
No, I don't think I will.
---
4 to go. 3 are super random, like find ustoppables comix, plasma grenade plan and deathclaw hide. All these things are super rare. Musician is bugged and cannot be completed
---
Got it. My mistake I thought OP was talking about the enclave underarmors  👌
---
Are you getting your daily 1,400 caps from the npc vendors?
---
Different ways to do it—some more sustainable than others. 
---
I found a plan (that I won’t mention otherwise the gods of Nerf will surely do their thing) that allows me to amass three different junk items that are easily farmable. If I run out of aid items I don’t need or clearing out my stash via bulking I can craft a bunch of not-to-be-named items. 
---
5 minutes most days I can get my daily 1,400 caps.
---
I love this story. Humerous, poingent and very RPG. Read like a short story from Elder Scrolls. Nicely done. 
---
This story has made me wonder if this is the new form a griefing from the Raider type of Fallout player? My theory is that since we've had the Vending Machines our camps are now shown on the map. So, the antagonist players have new targets for their nukes. People are now bombing camps for the "fun" of it. Thoughts?
---
Sigh. Didn’t know that.
---
Well, I’m level 121, so clearly it’s not impossible.
---
Lmao i love it
---
Ok, what I mean is does it say anywhere at all that a season model is being considered?
---
now you know
---
enjoy your ban
---
:(
---
I was in the middle of a fight with a Behemoth when he showed up. The Behemoth promptly turned around and smashed him into oblivion. 😁
---
The cringe nuke just hit
---
Just more blah blah blah
---
And again, *no one* is downplaying him by saying that he is "just another" AI. They're saying he is an AI, which by the very definition he is. That doesn't mean he isn't extremely well written, he is, but he is still an Intelligent being that was made Artificially (the very definition of AI). Absolutely no one has said that you cannot sympathise or empathise with him, but at the end of the day, he is still an AI.
---
Not all changes need to be to damage when they can also modify the weights to be more in line with each other.
---
This. I'd play Survival mode every time I turned the game on if this was how the mode functioned. There is still hope! The game mode is still technically in BETA?

No it's not impossible :)
---
&gt; Survival is in beta still.
---
What you replied to.  They go on to say  
---
&gt;When it gets out of beta I am expecting a season type setup where everyone starts the season at lvl 1 and each season having rule variations.
---
Which is their hope/expectation. Nowhere do they say this is what the official word is. Beta, however, is the official word.
---
Hi level 121, so clearly it’s not impossible., I'm dad.

There's like 1k chillin in a suitcase outside of white springs station

I’ve never been over 700-800
---
You’re right, I thought you were looking for urban/forest operative’s mod plans. But I think I’ve seen the casual mods at Harpers Ferry vendor bot before.
---
Yeah, try changing your local consumer rights.
---
I have a spoiler for you, billionaires have more weight to their actions than consumers do.

Wait til they can stop game crashes

Deserved it

I think they should charge 25k caps for a 200lb increase
---
I've had my mire church for a while now, but this is giving me some ideas on how to use that last tiny bit of build space
---
The little guy always gets screwed, so let's do nothing about it. Brilliant logic.
---
They drop from raider events.
---
I got mine from uranium fever
---
My favorite is how you can still walk inside of the giant nuka cola bottle at the plant. 
---
Or how molemen keep spawning underground.
---
Well a primed gatling plasma has a tiny bit more raw dps than the .50 cal, and a larger magazine (350 vs 250), and I think slightly better range. Recoil on it is also pretty reasonable if it's set up correctly. Spin up time sucks though. It's literally something I'd just pull out when I can push pure dps on the queen when she's grounded.
---
Um... the combat rifle already has a family of .38 receivers... Both semi and full auto.
---
Well there was a guy who took only four shots at the queen but was wondering where his three star loot was. The only thing he looted off the queen’s corpse was four bullets.
---
I am a beta player, and ues the game was launched in a bad state, worse than Bethesda intended. This does not change the fact theat we we're warned. We also chose to keep playing the game even in the state it launched in. I dont think we have any grounds(or reason) to want to sue them over this. If you do then go ahead and try, i wish you good luck.
---
Checked and it says fullscreen, really not sure what's giving it 30fps at this point as for all the settings are the same as they've always been
---
Stupid question... ultracite gatling laser is separate from the regular gatling laser, and can also be primed right? Like a normal UCG would use regular fusion cores, but when primed uses ultracite? I've never even seen an ultracite gatling laser. Ever. Haven't seen plans, haven't seen a legendary.. nothing. Are these dev room specific items that were gotten out with exploits?
---
This weapon is godlike for a survival weapon, it's basically dupe worthy if everyone couldn't access it anyway
---
You can do something about it. Try and change your local consumer right laws.
---
Or don't buy the games until you do.
---
Hopkin Greenfrog?
---
Also the first point is most important. So rifleman 1 expert rifleman 1 and master rifleman 1 all equals 30%
---
Taking all 3 cards to lvl 3 doubles it to 60%
---
So if your spreading points 3 cards is 30% and 9 cards is 60%
---
No I understand what you're saying, I think you are a bit confused. There is a small above ground part of the ship, to the north. That opens with a code.
---
There is the main wreckage in the centre. No doors, but possible it could later be edited. (This is what you were suggesting might have something to do later. And I hope so because I'd like to explore the ship not just get an entrance to some underground cave system where the astronauts made camp)
---
But to the west there is a piece sticking into the side of the crater wall, that even seems to have a unusable keypad/button and looks very much like it was created in a way to look like an entrance going underground.
---
I'm all for this.  We would have to find a satellite to "borrow" but I think we could get one, we know that there are still some satellites in orbit and working 25 years after the war, the question would be could get access to it's systems and can it send a message or signal.
---
Likewise, I built a base there and it took me 4 tries to get it how I wanted it.  I wanted some steps going down so I could walk down to the acid deposit instead of jump in the water and it's waaaay harder than it looks to position.  Also, large water collectors near there are also super painful to position close enough to the steps so you don't have to go swimming to collect them either.    
---
I instead moved it to the junk spot near top of the world by the train station, and lots of people use that one too. I think the biggest problem with the acid deposit spot is the fact that since it's in the middle of the map and near water, lots of people build close enough to it so you can't spawn in with yours, even if they don't build on the acid spot.  I ran into that a few times when I just clicked join anyway without my base and found people weren't even building at my base location, just close enough to cause a collision (which is way farther than the green boundaries).
---
With contents like "This game that had a shitty launch and did not deliver bags just now delivered bags." Are you saying any press is good press? Because having yet more reasons to bring up their fuckups is not much of a PR win.
---
You wouldn’t that’s why they’re  obtainable in survival. Hence why the sole survivor had 10% more damage towards players. Speaking of survival rewards I wonder if we’ll get armor ever. Maybe they should have weekly challenges in adventure to get weapons too?  I know
---
Most of those damn scout challenges are lengthy and seems like a good way to engage players and give them a reason to put more hours into the game
---
Casuals? So you are a professional gamer? "Working" 40-60hrs a week? NOT living in mommy's basement? Actually paying bills like a mortgage, or groceries other than Cheetos and Mt. Dew? Living off the fat stacks you make while "working" at Fallout 76?
---
You're in component view not what's in your inventory. That's why you see things you don't have. You can use that view for tagging items for search if you don't have them in your inventory. I think but I'm not sure the numbers in the brackets are just like an index code for the item. If you go out of component view to your inventory view you'll only see what you have
---
You selling it m8?
---
Press right bumper to switch between views
---
😂 😂
---
But wait people actually do downplay him as an npc when people say they can literally only relate to the purveyor or Grahm two characters with next to no backstory and lines, it's completely unfair to say no one complains, I know in the beginning I shouldn't have said he isn't an AI but my argument is clearly not about if he is made of flesh and blood or not, it's about the subtext in which people engage when they complain about how empty fo76 really is. There have been plenty of comments and threads since launch that complain about the lack of an npc they can relate or care about little to none of which actually count MODUS as something to be able to relate to. Just because no one names him as a character you cannot relate to doesn't mean that the sentiment isn't there which it absolutely is. Hell I'd argue MODUS is the closest AI to experience mortality AKA the human experience in a way that has actually changed the view of him.
---
Any chance the flight helmets act like a gas mask?
---
You're waisting your time here. These people are totally okay with getting fucked in the ass with Daddy telling them to bite the pillow.
---
Uninstalled Nvidia experience
---
GPU driver is up to date
---
No mods
---
Verified game files
---
Still locked at 30fps
---
Is it weird I'm kinda disappointed that I'm yet to discover a death trap camp
---
And this line of thinking continues to dodge their existing, not speculative, legal obligation to the consumer under existing laws. Something is right because it's right, not because of whether you like it or someone has more money.
---
Is it in your vending machine?
---
Get a photo of your badge at lvl 76 if you haven’t yet.
---
This. Seriously seven bucks, like a pack of smokes? Or a fast food meal? Jesus. Yes a video game worth even 2 hours of enjoyment is worth that.
---
Do you also say "ring a ding" to visitors?
---
I understand that, but long number display is what I'm suppose to have in my inventory.(Which I don't.) I just think it's a bug displaying 4294967289 for acid.
---
Yeah, not often but they all drop them. Some say at a 10% drop
---
I bought the game twice, just so I could use Tricentennial skin on my laser rifle lol
---
It's the last magazine I need. Was googling for a screenshot and found this thread. I obtained most of the rest from player vending, despite them not counting toward challenge completion.
---
Completely agree. I'm hesitant to buy anything, even with free atoms from challenges because they're only good for one or two things. 
---
They should've had some basic armor/equipment/power armor skins with basic colours available as quest rewards/vendor unlocks and had the cool stuff in the atom store.
---
They never admitted to charging full price for a broken product. Your headline is clearly misleading click bait. I'm not saying the game was perfect or even that they did the right thing releasing it early in a beta state when it wasn't ready. However it was still playable and I have been playing since release date so clearly not as broken as some people make out. Filled with bugs of course. What Todd howard has admitted was different practices leading up to release and more beta testing etc. So taking a class action for misleading click bait just makes no sense to me
---
I thought I did a lot of events. Apparently not enough. Lol
---
Did that super mutant have wings and also appear scorched?
---
Get ready for console kiddos to downvote you for some reason I don't understand. 
---
I would be happy if they could figure out a way to ez the pressure thier old ass systems run this game on... But a suggestion to improve PC will be met with contempt.
---
Was going to move today as well, going to hold off now. My current camp is under attack all the time and those dogs and mutants hate my generator with a passion. Sometimes I come home and the generator and nearest wall are destroyed, while the multiple turrets on just the other side of the wall are untouched.
---
I agree. This would be a cool idea. If they made a mode where it is open PVP, everyone must start with a fresh character, and there are NO legendary effects. A mode like that would be EPIC!
---
Alright I fixed it, for some reason my Nvidia control panel changed my monitor to 60hz instead of 165hz
---
Still doesn't make sense why fallout was at 30fps but now it's a lot better, 30 was just unbearable lol
---
What level are you and what system are you on?
---
Cosmetic only? Or a chance they act like a gas mask?
---
 Oh for sure. But I think most of us have ended up screwing up mutations.
---
  I have been doing it for not long, but long enough to keep the Starched Genes as a permanent thing.  ;)
---
I play on console, this is the reason I ask for the chat system. A few select games on console have a chat bar and I would like if this game had it especially.
---
Xbox, 31
---
I spent awhile trying to figure out was Kansas Stew was...
---
Yes they act as a gas mask too
---
Not in component view. It displays the index code for the item. Go back to item view to display what you have in your inventory
---
You can have Preston, just leave Danse for me.. ♡♡
---
Todd Howard openly admitted that the release was even worse than originally stated, whether you are with him or not.
---
You are a rarity then. And im with you. Online game without chat is weird.
---
Yes same here, more than six, some three star some two star but most came with bashing. Really wish I could bash the purveyor with them.
---
I did too. I was like.. *here?* bro... :(
---
I had this happen to me too. Admittedly, it wasn't a targeted strike, I'm near the whitesprings station. So I guess I knew that hazard, but heck it was devastating
---
😢✋
---
😭👋
---
I named my shop "the zetan probe" you can spell the name with the fraternity letters
---
Thanks for the heads up though, I want to see this game grow.
---
Yea this has been a sorta known issue is it sonetimes will keep giving you the exact same star in a category.
---
I was waiting for my 100 pre war money when i got attacked by mole rats... I just heard him say "well if you dont want it then fine". 
---
Only time i blasted him and still didnt get my prize.
---
Any post pointing something out is downvoted. It sucks because we need this to be seen
---
My Bloodied explosive gauss rifle gets up to about 1500 damage
---
Please do, I would love to see it.
---
I'm not denying that but when you use click bait headlines like saying broken when no Bethesda employee or Todd howard has said that you're clearly misquoting to incite a rage. That's my point. If your headline was Bethesda admitted the game wasn't in the state it should have been I'd be agreeable. But talking class action with misquoting and out of context statements is as bad as them releasing a buggy game.
---
I would argue that vats cost reduction is the best for a vats sniper build
---
I just dumped a bunch at 10 ....
---
I’ve always do that emote just to spice things up for me and other players around lol
---
BE is far superior to TSE, at least after they nerfed. You just get a much larger boost with bloodied and the proper build. I would say if not bloodied, go for an AAE one, it will outperform TSE.
---
You are safe then!
---
See, that's the thing.
---
Just thinking and talking online about it does nothing. 10-15 years ago these practices started to emerge and consumers opened their wallets to it.
---
And all along the way thinking and talking has happened but no action.
---
The last EA game i bought i was bad company 2 and that was multiple years into the shift.
---
Instead of talking the talk, walk the walk, which is why i suggest trying to change the laws not talk on the internet about buyers remorse and playing the victim card.
---
Devs know this already. Gamers just talk the talk and rarely walk the walk.
---
 I traded in my 3* AA 40% Speed Lightweight Shiskabab that did decent damage with the extra flames, because it was too slow. Its a Medium weapon. I have of course 3 Martial Artist as a serious knife user, so it was very fast by normal standards. 
---
 I summon a horde in The Golf Club and get into my corner and drop em' all with almost no damage. I can't do that with slow weapons, they'll overwhelm me. So 300 a hit at 3 a sec will drop em' all at my feet. 
---
Today was very good for Legendaries. ;)
---
Ooh virgins... Don't worry we're gentle :/
---
Lol OK, in your world nobody will write good things about the canvas bags when they arrive so it doesn't matter when they get here.
---
Lol
---
I would love them to explore a mode where death is permanent. Griefers, dupers, and twinkies hate the idea. But I would love to try and finish every quest and start grinding Events and whatnot knowing I have NEVER respawned. Think about it. Is it just the threat of imprisonment that makes people behave in RL? Or does the threat of losing your OWN life make you hesitant to be a dick to others?
---
USELESS MILITARY KNOWLEDGE TIME: 7.62x51 is a NATO round, which was used in the M-14 and M60, and is still currently used with some versions of the SCAR (heavy), sniper rifles, and the M240 MMG. 7.62x39 is the round used in almost every version of the AK assault platform, including the RPK.
---
There's *also* a 7.62x54 which has literally been in use since the Boxer Rebellion. It gained the most fame in WWII, used with the Mosin-Nagant 1891/30 sniper rifle. Currently, it's still most commonly used with Dragunov sniper rifles and the PKM, Russia's equivalent of the M240.
---
7.62x51 is nearly synonymous with the .308, and both rounds can be used in weapons chambered for one or the other. The 7.62x51 cannot be used in a weapon chambered for 7.62x54 (and vice versa) however, since the 7.62x51 is a rimless cartridge.
---
The shotgun barrel also scales with rifleman perks, so its a good shotgun option to a rifle main weapon
---
this was the worst sub to come to for support, you're in a sub full of fans of the game. if you want your opinions to be validated go to r/gaming
---
Im kindoff hoping the add more types like Salt my fucking god i would pvp for that. But they could move a few closer to the power substations were you get free power
---
Can you elaborate on “charlien is bugged” I ran all 3 last night and had no issues 
---
What platform? 
---
What happened??
---
 can we kill enough robots to bring their population down?
---
Only one way to find out....
---
I forgot to mention...
---
The coordinates for the mouse is not at the tip of the mouse icon, it is closer to the middle.  
---
The incredibly stupid slider bar for working with  multiple quantities is anti-user friendly.  The rate at which it counts INCREASES after a certain point (around the 30 mark).   Dumb, Dumb, Dumb...
---
One can try to use the mouse pointer to Grab the slider mark to move it to a new position, good luck though, remember that the mouse coordinates don't match up to the point?  
---
They SHOULD have had a system that allows keyboard input, AND; a Plus above each digit, and a Minus below each digit; AND allow one to either press the Up or Down key to increment each position.  
---
Instead we get a slider bar circa 1988.  
---
I can go on and on...
---
Can confirm for xbox to I just saw it
---
No.

Nova-  FALLOUT NEWVEGAS DLC CONFIRMED
---
Yeah, it's at least $7 good.  Even if you chew through the (relatively anemic) main story, you'll get probably 10+ hours of fun out of it, and that's not counting all the stuff that has the rest of us putting in hundreds of hours.  Or, well, you can spend $7 and catch a matinee movie.
---
good read, sad story. rip your frog
---
Mods, in gaming, mean a packaged file that adds or changes content.
---
Yes, one is modifying the game from how the developers wish it, but not doing so makes the game unplayable.
---
Quad, fire rate, faster reload or reduced weight if not running bear arms.
---
 They make a better T Shirt and Slacks I'll buy it. 
---
 Otherwise I'm good as I like my Plague Rider X0-1 skin, not that I wear it much. Gets me home when I'm heavy, and is perfect for some situations. But I go through cores so slowly.
---
The bags came with a signed picture of todd yes
---
Go and scrap the objects you cannot afford to replace. Then you can resume use of the auto-repair.
---
PIONEER SCOUTS OF AMERICA (P.S.A.)
---
Will you folks *please* start using spoiler tags?
---
There are a few crews that hunt out the codes every week when they reset. You can get a mission for it in the enclave so they can pick them all up pretty quick, usually within 15-20 minutes of the reset they have them all.   
---
Afterwards the code prices are put into nukacrypt and it spits out every possibility, and those crews go to work on them, they have been getting pretty lucky lately and the code has been right at the top of the list, but if you ever notice a code unsolved until Wednesday that’s because there where just too many options and they need to wait until one of the key-letters come up in the enclave
---
It's the last one I need too. I have several duplicates of others from player vending (collected on PC for display, not the badges).
---
Yeah, sadly
---
Guy, you’re acting like a cunt for no reason.
---
While it's in beta, it should be as it is because otherwise it'd take FOREVER to test high level type things.
---
Once the beta is over though, I totally agree with everyone starting from the beginning and with no ability to bring characters from one game mode to the other.
---
Excited by this line:
---
"they will have a lot to talk about at E3 when it comes to Fallout 76."
---
Thanks for the great explanation, holy shit.
---
Mine was extra special, it said "Love from Todd, sorry for the wait xx"
---
The insult bot got me recently 😂 I’m melee and took a swing but he was a touch put or range.
---
Still digesting your reply, thanks.
---
I don't see a new rug in my build menu, and I purchased the Golden Years set.
---
Wait, *can you set off a nuke anywhere?!*
---
Anyone interested in executioner +10% damage while aiming max level Cryolator? I’m on PS4. 
---
I use executioner buzzblade and executioner super sledge on sbq fight late phase. I’d use this Cryolator also if I were into heavy guns.
---
Is you is , or is you ain't , my constuant
---
She’s a commie. Why would she do that?
---
I haven’t gotten one.
---
Pro Tip! Ive found tons off of Scorchbeast Guano piles. Check around Watoga.
---
Don't shy away from higher level players who drop loot bags and try to give you supplies! Most people I've encountered in the game are awesome and are really happy to help!
---
Licenses and registrations often expire.
---
Your PC can have any back story you please. There is nothing stopping us from going as far as selecting a pre-war M.I.A. character and assuming their role and identity. Unless proven otherwise, if they potentially could have entered 76, they're fair game.
---
Don’t buy skins until this is fixed
---
Couldn’t you just log off?
---
Believe me I have been. Also around the outside of defiance.
---
I haven't seen mine yet.
---
Why? Maxson has no idea what is going on and officially BoS will not establish a presence on the East Coast for another 100 years give or take.
---
Unless everything in 76 is declared non canon it dosen't make sense.
---
Speaking of that, it's kind of dumb that you drop a wad of money on a skin and then have to expend in game materials to craft it. I feel like Atom shop stuff should require zero additional materials to craft.
---
Never carry more than 100 of anything that isn’t ammo so you establish the discipline of not becoming a hoarder.
---
Do your daily / weekly challenges as well as the Tadpole / Possum badge challenges... you’ll get around and see the sights.
---
Do team up.  Whole game reinvents itself with a partner.
---
Once you do the Enclave quest line, launch a nuke.  It’s a fun experience you can most easily do solo; just study a video or two ahead of time and learn the shortcuts to launching in under 20 min.
---
Do visit a train station every day to get your 1400 caps and dump your unwanted legendaries. For 150 scrip.  Timer resets I believe every 20 hours.
---
Do the Horde quests in the Cran Bog or Mire.  I still use these to farm legendaries at level 305.  RNG gods granted a 50 cal Bloodied Explosive 90% weight reduction drop off a 3 star mirelurk 5 days ago in that event.  Don’t miss it.
---
Cool cool stuff like Scorchbeast Mixed Stew and Mirelurk Cake with Bloodleaf Aoli, and just give them away to randoms.  Awfully nice way to say hello.  
---
Don’t pick up a bag of junk from a dead person in PVE.  It’s not cool and not conducive to the FO community spirit.  It’s just dangerous enough out there already.
---
 
---
Check the Atomic Shop weekly for the freebie.
---
And build the camp you’d want to visit if you were  wandering nearby.
---
Yeah it sucks a red rocket for sure lately. Especially after the update that was supposed to ''improve'' it.
---
Try out the different weapon styles as you see them. There really isn’t a main focus to this game, you just kinda do stuff, so don’t be afraid you’re doing something wrong, it’s hard to do things very wrong in this game.
---
People play this game hundreds of hours circling repetitive tasks. There are people that repeat content hundreds of times, for no real benifit
---
I wasn't paying attention and didn't realize I was about to be nuked.
---
That’s actually not true. Just today I was able to use the repair all function to repair what I could. Totally new to me.
---
Glad you got it fixed
---
Try to have you C.A.M.P somewhere close to water and supplies as it will be a huge benefit. So you can store supplies quicker and leave more room in your inventory.
---
1st valut problems?
---
Joking aside, that would really suck 🙁
---
I might have it - let me check real quick
---
A fallout themed peace sign would be pretty to display

[removed]
---
I have a couple of you're on xb
---
What are the buffs/ debuffs on the armor plated backpack?
---
You do realize if they attempt to fix it they will likely mess it up and make your explosive laser lose the 2nd star.
---
They arent suppose to exist in the first place. They arent going to fix what shouldnt be around.
---
Have fun.
---
This is definitely one of those games that the grind is what you make of it. If you try to rush levels, gear, or reach whatever you consider to be "endgame", it's going to feel like a slog very quickly and your interest will wain. Take your time, do what seems fun at the moment, party up, and levels/gear will take care of themselves.
---
I like how they made the INDIAN dude the tech support guy.....
---
I have an extra one. My GT is Rippleshanks
---
How can they mess that one up. I don’t think that will be the case.
---
It had a .308 receiver in Fallout 4 and 76 is using all the same assets. It'd be trivial for them to do this
---
lol this just happened today and I recorded it because it's pretty much a meme now that he shows up at the wrong time

---
They spawn in many other places in the mire as
---
Well....
---
If they were gonna to remove the second star, they would’ve done it when they took the drop away from the game
---
And I understand that. But I know for a fact that I'm not the only person that hops on the survival servers  and gets their ass handed to them because I'm not equipped/ set up for pvp. I'm only there for weekly challenges.
---
If paint from atom store can make a star disappear, imagine what could possibly go wrong when they touch the projectiles.
---
How? It’s Bethesda, you really don’t want to jinx it.
---
I was on the same fucking server, this happened around 11:00 PM Est. Standard right?
---
Thanks, I knew it had to be something along those lines
---
Kinda like Symmetra from Overwatch
---
She's:
---
* Indian
---
* A hero who's focused on advanced tech
---
* Used to be in the Support category
---
The jokes write themselves
---
All guns all ammo types. Wacky gunplay where your INTELLIGENCE is the limit.
---
Or just give us more ammo types to bolster the market. Pistol conversions for 9mm, 12.7mm and .45-70. Rifle conversions for .45-70, 7.62mm, BB. Add a Nail gun that shoots nails as the pistol counterpart to Railway Rifle.
---
Seen a fee weird special encounters lately...
---
A guy named Willy who advertises special tickets for Uncanny caverns....only a few lucky people in the world will get them.....he’s dressed in a top hat tails and a cane as well. Looks like Gene Wilder...
---
A robot named Rachel who needs a recon scope for a special mission.
---
Huge pack of dead Brahaim.
---
Well, if the do end up taking the star away, at least it will confirm that it would’ve been a bug after all and I would be okay with that. But as it is, they all still have the explosive effect on them and they all look like rubbish when firing
---
Are these rare? I find them all the time....what are they good for?
---
Welp thems the breaks sadly. Most online games that have a pve/pvp meta have this issue.
---
I have good luck with wiring. Let me know if you’d like some help some fine.
---
\+91 DR but cuts the carry weight of the pack in half.
---
They were first gonna collect tickets from all who wanted replacements, from there it would take 4-6 months. Last date to send in a ticket was 3rd of May. It has been 1 month. Expect bags between late september to early november most likely.
---
I got the collectors edition myself, but did not send in a ticket. From my time with the military I had several canvas bags of that type, they had slip-pockets on them for ID/content slips, so I just printed a West-tec slip and put in and I was a happy camper. Not an option most had though. I hope they get their bags, but there is still some time to go.
---
If you’re ok with a normal looking laser and don’t care about the explosive effects, normal gatling lasers are everywhere. Heck if you’re on PS4 I’d be happy to take your eyesore away and give you my nocturnal version with extra bashing and 90% weight reduction (only weighs 8 lbs like a feather).
---
He gets blown away even if he does not surprise me.
---
There was a unique on that took 5.56 in fo4. Can't remember the name tho, probably because it was really unremarkable
---
Bloodied, 40% extra power attack damage, take 40% less damage while power attacking
---
 You have to go to the military wing, and talk to the computer to start it up.
---
Not really something you can store in the servers without taking up a lot of space. That’s why a lot of games have sounds that tend to take up lotsa space.
---
Yeah floating camps look dumb as hell
---
There is a set of 3 flight helmets that act as gas masks in the shop right now if you’re interested
---
and with canvas being a legendary material, it's gonna be years before they manage to farm enough materials to craft a bag.
---
Damn man......damn
---
Same although that's cause I never have fusion cores so it just takes space in my stash waiting for the day I can dawn it like fucking iron Man
---
I would use atoms to pay for both more CAMP budget and a 20% increase in CAMP area.
---
lol
---
I'd be down for this. Would benefit everyone and discouraging "floating" bases would probably help with the servers.
---
I hate every responder other then Sanjay. He's cool as fuck and I love em. Now Grafton mayor on the other hand can eat both my assholes.
---
I was actually planning on nuking Top of the World here soon, as it's something different and new to me.
---
But, I'm the nice guy, before I throw the nuke, I'm gonna check to see if anyone's camp is nearby, and highly suggest they either relocate or server-jump. Or stick around and have a "blast" with us, and help rebuild. 
---
I've been thinking of places that are hardly nuked, as it's usually either Whitesprings or Cranberry
---
I do think it's pretty funny that no matter how many layers you put between enemies and the generator, they know exactly what walls to aimlessly shoot at until they eventually get to it.
---
Gonna have to disagree here. The entry process to 76 was heavily controlled. We know this from the overseer's personal story. We also know from the security terminal in 76  they shot anyone who wasnt supposed to enter the day the bombs fell. 
---
Unless your pc was somehow disfigured beyond robotic facial identification the militay bots in McLintoc would at least recognise you as inactive duty and would know your rank. There would have to be a similar but different quest for reenlistmemt, as well a different quest to gain the rank of general if you had already achieved that.
---
I guess with enough handwaving you could get most anything to work and im not trying to tell anyone how to play. I just like to work with the lore the game does provide. And to me that means I can either be a very special non military non us senator or above pre war person, or be less than 25 and thus have no prewar life at all.
---
Yes but it will always be like that, nomatter if there are dupes or not people will call high leveled players with good gear cheaters or dupers.
---
Nothing personal, thats just the reason why this looks like whining.
---
And i am NOT saying you are whining, just to clarify
---
They’re part of the leatherworker possum badge. You have to scrap 5. First one must find them.
---
me either, just the chair. a couch and the table.
---
Damn people just racist on main.
---
Sometimes, move the item you want to wire to a new spot. Then wire it, and move it back to when you want it with the wore attached.
---
I mean its the only game i play and i have 470 hours clocked.
---
I’m pretty sure i enjoy the game. 
---
And yes it would not be 12 but the absolute maximum of 24 more mobs, i think the engine can handle 24 mobs more.
---
Renaming my turrets "Beaver Destroyers". Best name is best.
---
Nicely done! r.i.p.it!
---
I agree. I spend hours building nice, complex camps just for it to be destroyed by a single Mongrel or rad rat pup, then I have to spend all of my materials repairing it. Repairing all the things I've built when I come back to do something just takes too much time and materials, a real pain in the ass. It's not fun, and a 'soft core' online survival game should be fun. Don't get me wrong, I really love this game, but camp destruction is such a pain  in the ass and I think we can all agree on that.
---
But keep PVP Camp destruction, it's always good for everyone when you destroy that one player's camp who follows you around, gun bashing/hitting/shooting you while CONSTANTLY doing the 'irradiated' emote.
---
I see. So in your world, we didn't just watch more than six months where every last mention of the game came with a scathing statement of how shitty the launch was, nor did we see every mention of canvas bags being about how Bethesda broke it's promise, and somehow that's not the direction they'll take, probably along the lines of "Bethesda takes 1 year to do what it promised to do at launch"?
---
It's great that you have the scathing nerd thing going and all, but to be honest, if you're going to be an ass, can you at least be an accurate ass?
---
I've actually acquired a lot of my plans from player vendor camps.
---
It was quite a puzzle, but I'm happy to share how I got it! 
---
I found the trigger conditions for the scientist corpse inside its corresponding quest entry (FormID 0031C70A), which is found in the REObjectNode (FormID 00063129).  [This condition](https://i.imgur.com/XaKnUbG.png) This means that whenever an "Object" RE is triggered, it checks for the trigger's distance from the Object Reference (0008CD54 which turned out to be Mama Dolce's) and then compares it to the minimum distance allowed. 
---
The object referenced by the Comparison Value, "REDistanceFromLocationGlobal [GLOB:003E156D]", is also referenced by [8 other random encounters](https://i.imgur.com/U3es2zw.png) (plus one cut from the game, "Police Chase") Examining this object entry reveals the distance to be 120,000 units. 
---
With a bit of math, I translated those units into pixels.  The map I was using was 4943x4943 is roughly a 1/117 scale of pixels to in-game distance units (not the Mappalachia maps, which are 4096x4096).  I divided 120000 by 117 to get the pixel radius of 1025, placed a point at Mama Dolce's, made a circle with that radius centered on that point, and there you have it!
---
I also didn't use Mappalachia to determine that the point was Mama Dolce's.  Interestingly, the map used in The Whitespring Bunker and train stations is a near-perfect representation of the actual cell grid used by the game.  I was informed by eckserah and confirmed that each cell is 4096 units wide.  So, any XYZ coordinate values in the ESM can be divided by 4096 to give you a rough location on the cell map. The 0,0 coordinate seems to be somewhat off-center, but [this](https://i.imgur.com/kRzHQAw.jpg) is the closest I've been able to get it.
---
Yeah I understand that. Not a big fan of rushing. It’ll all be there later
---
Soz for the weirdos giving long answers because they think they're smart. OP is referinf to Roger Maxon, who Macon from fallout 4 is a descendant of.
---
Same here!
---
Thanks for the video buddy
---
I think so. It was getting late. First nuke was in the southern ash heap, 2nd was on hemlock holes in the toxic valley. 3rd was south of top of the world. Xbox?
---
I really hate that one song that sounds all gloomy and like someone farting really loudly.
---
Wow awesome reply, big thanks. I’ll make sure to do these things.
---
If you get the spinning wheel of death, hit x to bring up the transfer screen and put something in, a 308 round or a piece of junk, then back out of the transfer screen give it a second and check again. That seems to unstick the wheel. 
---
Waiting until she turns into a meat pile seems to work also.
---
"Needs support" I NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AFTER TRYING TO BUILD TODAY!
---
I feel like OP specifically said Maxon because they want people to complain that "maxon isn't born yet" so they can be on their high horse and say that they were referring to Roger Maxon. Smh
---
Stay crouched,move fast and don't cause a bunch of noise shooting some scorched.
---
Last week was crazy. Sneaking thru the bog i came upon a bunch of ppl fighting. Just keep on sneaking and gave em a wide birth. They can only respawn at the trains so use that info.
---
Ditch most of your aid and drop off or forget about junk.
---
All of the pvp for that damn workshop and i finally got to a mission i could do... The other guy seemed to just want the prize too! Bit tense but once he threw me an invite i was so happy.
---
Use the frowny face.. Had a few ppl move past me after i put my weapon down. Lots of us just want the prize haha
---
Sadly without dialogue options. It’s just not the same when they go all monologue on you.
---
Can't trade or sell in this sub, chief. You should remove the post or they may ban you.
---
Vats headshot. Took out two dudes who were camping v76 when I fast traveled there to get to Tyler dirt track for the workshop challenge. They respawned and tried to run, I hunted them down for good measure. Spawn campers in beginner areas can gtfo.
---
Much like every story involving making wishes with a genie, you really need to be hyper specific with Bethesda these days.
---
Let me try...
---
" **Let us restore the satellite uplink to the west coast BoS so Elder Maxson can give us quests that aren't bugged and that have rewards that are worth the effort."**
---
Ditto.
---
Lol, I kind of want to mimick this but I imagine that much of that stuff is premium cosmetics.
---
Good chance they let you keep it. I did a refund of atoms on an item because I believed it used false advertising. And they refunded the atoms and let me keep the item.
---
I'll guess you'll just to wait a day or 2 to see
---
I find it annoying as hell that if your base gets nuked and you have frog jars, you can't 'repair all' until you have collected more frogs. I mean it makes sense but ugh I wish we had a 'repair most' option. I could repair all but the frogs.
---
Someone nuked my base today too. They snuck behind me in the silo, waited until I tried to put my keycard in, put their keycard in and launched on my base then asked me if I was going to take it like a man. 
---
The good news is, floors are not destructable and my entire camp is made out of floors and pre-existing structures.
---
Well, for your concern, I actually have a job 40+ hour a week as well as bills as anybody else, AND my dude is level 198 with a bloodied explosive variant of almost all guns (including some legacy) as well as a full sentinel assassin suit, and I'm never hurting for caps, or struggling to make the daily limits... So I guess what I'm really saying is that people who have jobs and still complain about kids putting hundreds of hours more than them, or being rewarded because they can, are just shitty gamers.
---
Ars Technica just published an article talking about the redemption arc of fallout 76 and how it's improving. You need to move on from the shitty launch. If you wanna debate about how journalists are treating this game, try to keep up to date.
---
true on the synths, false on the no institute, tho currently its just a bunch of scientists building a new lab, it'll take afew years before they become the institute of synth slavers
---
Found mine at Water Park, though I did have to server hop for a little while to get it. [Tourist is leaning against a car in the parking lot] (/spoiler)
---
I've seen your profile. You're either a duper yourself or a munchkin.
---
This person gets it. I usually buy junk legendaries for scrip. Nobody wants your one-star mutant's wet noodle, but hell, I got caps to spend and scrip to earn, I'll buy that junker off of you.
---
I camped near the watch tower N/E of top of the world for over a month. Daily I would climb the tower for the cap stash and viewing south from there you can see the random spawn location.
---
 I do not believe there are categories of what turns up at these locations. I think based on your level it will change. In the beginning lots of scorched , Chinese agent with the mama dolce key, witch, civil war soldier, and super mutants. 
---
Near the end it was more often death claws, tank with gutsy‘s and an assultron. Even raider Power Armor.
---
So I rarely join a group and the reason is I use lone wander perk card.  I will always help out people though and give out stuff, kill an enemy whatever but I dont usually accept invites. I tend to act like The Stranger and just show up to kill an enemy that's kicking your butt and then run off doing whatever I'm doing.  Things get easier once your build is set and your weapons are better but the early game can be brutal.
---
I found one the other day on PS4 I was going around there camp trying to find there vending machines and thought they were upstairs so I went up and right before you get to the door there is a small gap between the top of the stairs and the door and you fall on to spike traps and die I didn't see it the first time till it was too late
---
Well, at this point, they’re still considered the survivors of CIT.
---
I sell a lot of low end but useful legendaries (1 star aa, low level anything useful, and so on). I also sell junk, especially things like screws and springs. Finally, ammo I don't use? 1 cap each, sells like crazy for stuff that's not .38
---
Don't buy. Check!
---
My bad though I was posting to the market.
---
Seeing you didn't agree to any of the trades, do you still have the BE handmade rifle? I've got tons of trades to give (like instigating power attack damage power fist with 50% melee damage reflected lvl 50 3 star, vampire's explosive harpoon gun with 25% less VATS AP cost, lvl 40 3 star and tons more)
---
 i was a couple hundred caps away from max and didnt know there was a max. someone bought a tse the dragon and a few of my good plans
---
Um fuck that no dying for me today thanks for the warning
---
Yeah, I figured best on the way it was titled. :)
---
I have a two shot ffr and I really like it.
---
Sorry I was away if you're still available just shoot me an invite, mine is XBattlexBuddyX
---
Are you selling?
---
indeed, weird how we know all this stuff but cant interfear with its future huh? or even fill in the gaps of HOW they became the way they are.
---
Yeah I thought I would get lucky doing the same. After hopping about 50 camps I noticed almost everyone was selling the same things
---
I'll take it off ur hands for 5k or trade
---
She’s actually quite the conversationalist, but she’s only fluent in Molish.
---
I feel ya, I've made many a mad scramble for a vendor. I dont put anything in the machine that will put me over the top, have had multiple purchases push me over tho
---
That would enter p2w territory.
---
I wandered into an empty golf club, intently listening for the sounds of waking ghouls. Then the bastard snuck up on me.
---
He didn’t leave that clubhouse.
---
I can help you out my psn is YoungSpud-san
---
You thought wrong. The notice has been there since it was added to the shop.
---
Its kill on sight for me.
---
I would *swear* I lost fusion cores when I died during a SBQ fight earlier tonight. I figured I had to have somehow  imagined going from 10 to 2 in half an hour, but maybe something is up.
---
Or a drug like berry mentats.  But 5 min to highlight dead enemies.  Get those melons involved!  This way the tax on the system is limited.
---
My turrets do nothing until I'm hurt. Super annoying tbh.
---
I have never seen that....where is it?
---
Wait, those are player dropped... is there a recipe for them in game? Because not going to lie, the idea of dropping bottlecaps in my santa armor next holiday season sounds really appealing, but I'm having no luck learning more via google.
---
It had a .308 receiver in Fallout 4. I don’t get why they removed it.
---
Delano grange far right side middle of map!
---
The only winners in any class action lawsuit are the lawyers. You screw over Bethesda for 2  bucks and some change in the mail.
---
Hey thanks man. I'll add you
---
It was months ago, but it was literally just "we'll take this feedback to the devs". It might happen. It might not. It'd be idiotic to NOT do it, because right now survival mode is 100% dead on PC. Like, last Satuday there was ONE survival mode server all day. Couldn't get a different one after like 20 hops.
---
I understood that reference
---
So I'm finding I'm afraid. I'm still hoping to find others my level range (20-30) who want to do things 'traditionally' but I guess I may end up needing help from higher levels tagging their kills again if things don't get smoother. As nice as it is to find somewhere cool (I discovered Vault 63 today and it was fun to find the way down, even if it wasn't especially well hidden) all the weapon maintenence, ammo gathering/making, and then spending an entire play session to not even get two full levels and totally run out of three ammo types is the kind of thing that will kill my interest in continuing. Better to swallow my pride/preconcieved notions of not taking the easy way out than feeling I wasted my money on the game.
---
Cool see ya soon
---
He never lied. Everyone seems to forget or chooses to ignore the fact that from the get go they said it would be a work in progress and asked for the players to help mold the game into what we wanted.
---
\+karma thank you I really appreciate it!
---
I can help, just add me - P_Shepard
---
"Todd Howard is not exactly a fan favorite at the moment..."
---
Who the fuck is this pretentious fuckwad? Name me some other people that have released more than 6 games that I've enjoyed.
---
"a game so broken and devoid of content"
---
No, that's just your empty soul. Is Windows bug free? Fuck, are Intel processors bug free? Name me some bug free computer shit.
---
I'm not saying your title is click-bait, but this moron's article is.
---
So easy to jump between subs that I didn’t even notice and just wanted to get it up quick.
---
There’s supposedly an end to sickleman, in the bottom left of the savage divide on a mountain there’s a lone house with police cars outside, inside the house is the skeleton of a woman holding a sickle surrounded by hollowed new decorations, might be the end of sickleman there
---
When you put in so much money on something. Um yes..
---
Closed
---
Cool I'll add you too
---
Well either way it was a waste of money
---
So, I'm happy to report that the Corvega backpack is a fair bit skinnier than the standard backpack.  Arms don't clip into it when you run.  It does seem to sit a bit low on the character's back, but I like it overall.  Goes well with my current Metal Armor torso too.
---
I've never duped. And I'm 27 years old.
---
Dont feel that way like you wasted money, around your level I felt like christ will the ever get easier....and will I ever be able to conquer the wasteland like in fallout 4.  I gets better and this game is really enjoyable. Hang in there bud
---
In my sniper build, I use the Overseers Guardian and Kiloton rifles as my main weapons.  
---
And the railway rifle for fun.  😉
---
It would be cool to play the Atom Shop music
---
North of WSS on a billboard, up the railroad tracks-I believe it’s easiest to get to from Beckwith farm, heading west towards the train tracks

Even says it on the tool tip for the arms. That and the bonus carry weight on re-log bug are the only reasons I bother hanging onto the thing.
---
\+karma
---
The little lake/pond near vault 76, next to the lumber mill. Also the billboard on the cliff to the east of 98 Nar Regional.
---
How can you "not deny it" then turn around and completely deny it? It's exactly as stated, and it's exactly what Todd said: They released the game in worse shape then they let on, and they knew about it beforehand without disclosing the extent to which they knew it.
---
I'll do my best. You never know, might be a few people in the same boat see my post. Appreciate you chipping in, as I did wonder if it was Lone Wanderer. I use it too, I just swap it out for Inspirational if I manage to team up, but I guess it is a pretty big drop in performance looking at what it does.
---
Your filling the blueprint limit, you can make one for your main building and others for outdoor builds.
---
You guys are epic gamers, now where tf would I find a Rabbit and a Squirrel? lol
---
I just tried and ran out of room long before I got my whole house, which is not large.
---
What does your age have to do with anything?
---
I am not starting over at this point. But I won’t stop others from doing so.
---
I'm taking the statement directly to the stakeholders, which is us. It takes more than just one person. This is literally walking the walk to get others to walk, too.
---
I'm crying rn 😭
---
People are a bit skeptical of random group invites.  Greifers have been using the invites to get people into PvP to jack their scrap.  It's not really personal but we have gotten very cautious when we get a group invite.  If you have voice chat that might help you by asking if they would join up with you rather then just a random invite.
---
You a pc player? Im about to be on and ik all the locations for them.
---
Let's not mention that some defence events spawn enemies into the ground. Looking at you Thunder Mountain!
---
I can't deny the shitty returns, you're right about that. I believe doing nothing is far worse in the long run.
---
You should try visiting Prickett's Fort sometime.
---
Same but it took about five goes. If I didn’t have to delete these pictures as soon as I took them (curse you PS4’s pathetic storage!) I’d have a lot of shots of the Bog!
---
Change servers
---
I got the Shielder Raider plans from Uranium Fever.
---
3 rabbits will spawn on top the Enclave bunker entrance at Whitespring, and usually there's a couple squirrels
---
Hey! That’s me and my crew!! This is awesome!!!
---
You sound like you put yourself in financial despair over an 18$ skin. Sorry your special skin isn't so special anymore. I'm sure you have bigger things in life to worry about and if not then I envy you.
---
I ran though it after the changes and even having done it before on my character it felt different.  The original felt like the main fight was outside, this made it feel more like a siege and a true battle.  The new lore made it feel all the more deep and really showed the magnitude of the threat and really enriched the story.
---
You are taking things out context and changing wording that's what I'm arguing. He said they were doing something new and from that knew they were going to face difficulties and unfortunately they came across in the screen. But all online games have had difficulties on day one and it's not how it starts but how it becomes with Bethesda fully supporting it for years to come to see it become the best it can be. So your out of context comments only focussing on one aspect of what he said and changing the words to suit your argument is what I'm arguing. Again I admit the game wasn't perfect but if you're going to try and quote something use actual quotes not out of context with words changed to suit your only your arguments.
---
Murgle at Welch!!
---
The part where it says " self recorded idea ", this needs alot of server space if you want to be able to share that holotape, with others.
---
you did not reply to that comment. you replied to the one I quoted. How am I a cunt that you can't thread for shit?
---
I haven't actually sent any blind invites, as I know in most games it's rude. Generally I try emotes, then voice chat on the off chance they have it enabled, and I've asked around on the bigger Discords. It's not as if I've had no successes after all, it just feels like most people do prefer to go it alone, which is understandable given most are high level already and others want to go at their own pace.
---
They haven't done anything with it, at some point some new quests or content will involve the space station.  Haven't you noticed there's a LOT in game that doesn't have much to it yet?  It's coming.
---
Thank you for the response. Honestly even though i have recognized some of the locations I have just never bothered so I didn't know if $500 was a deal or ridiculous. You've cleared that up for me!! LOL  Guess I better go make some adjustments!
---
My main building won't fit :(.
---
I'm actually going to boot back up, restock my ammo and aid items, so if anyone wants to play my username is this one without the date.
---
It's frustrating
---
It’s called a thread fucktard
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Thank you for the response. I had no idea so I trusted you guys to help and you have come through! It is appreciated.
---
yeah!
---
I know it's kinda unrelated, but how do you capture a frog in the frog jar?
---
Pm dm what wver the fuck its called on here for user name. Or plot twist i betcha they are the same user names.
---
Is there a way you can have two for your main? Like upper/bottom floor? Other then that I can’t really think of a way to make more space....or take things out of the build. Sorry I couldn’t help more.
---
Thank you for the response. Clearly, based on the responses I've been getting my price is WAY out!! LOL, thanks again.
---
Comparing what he said now to back then is a stark contrast of the depths of Bethesda's deceit. He did not reveal the extent of how badly unfinished the game was when they released the "final" product, and now about it was worse than they let on. No one should be defending that behavior, especially with paid merchandise. Releasing unfinished work as finished has legal consequences, and he openly admitted that they weren't honest about the state of the game at release.
---
Here's your car, we'll work out the tires issue later (and other stuff we're not telling you).
---
Here's your admission to college, but you can't take each of the requirements (and other stuff we're not telling you).
---
Here's your dining set, but one chair is missing for a few months (and other stuff we're not telling you).

Accepting this as "regular business" is to actively take part in their wrongdoing.
---
Makeshift cafe up the hill from Welch train station.
---
Yes. That is what I am trying to explain. If you want to reply to the "thats what they are sayin" comment, you have to hit reply on *that* comment, not the one above it like you did here.
---
You are welcome. feel free to hit me up for any other basic tips and tricks you are having difficulty with.
---
Thank you for the response.  I am clearly over-priced and I appreciate the input.
---
It was the last scared thing in the game and they sold it again. And your right, I'm a broke college kid.
---
It's all good I just thought a blueprint would be able to hold the size of your building, but apparently not.  If you don't want to build to your full potential then a blueprint will work for anyone!  It's a shame.
---
But then how will we pick up all the bags of fools that bring junk to Encryptid, kappa
---
Took me maybe 3 or 4 mins for this one was easy enough but you’re doing a service for helping people
---
&gt; **Are people antisocial or am I just unlucky?** 
---
Does it have to be an either/or thing? Why not both?
---
Lol, good shit sir, nicely done.
---
You’re out of your mind, friend. Sure, we can build fusion generators, power armor and miniature nuclear bombs, but refrigeration technology was beyond even pre-war science.
---
I know right!? I stopped using the blueprints and now just don’t move my camp.
---
Two different schools of thought on that one.
---
My opinion is to get all three at one point.
---
The six extra cards give a very small boost and strength cards are already tight.
---
The damage is already solid, so unless your vying for pvp, just go for one each.
---
If pvp, it’s probably worth losing the utility for full cards, but then again, heavy weapons builds really aren’t the best pvp stuff .
---
You called me a munchkin. I thought that meant a child.
---
Well what's the main effect? That's kinda important to know
---
Thank you for the response. I'm getting people say 20 / 25 for some , 50 for most but as high as 100
---
Forgot about that one. In that case, vats crit damage would be an interesting option as a second star as well
---
Thank you for the response. It's appreciated!
---
I wouldn't care if when I moved my camp that sometimes it makes 70 little blueprints and I need to start all over.  The only reason I move it is to fix my destroyed items without using resources.
---
I think your frogs better off, the living conditions of those "habbitats" are abysmal, my frogs live in my stash box where they can climb amongst my belongings. #Freethefrogs!
---
They really didn't change all that much in terms of layout and assets but for few changes they did make made all the difference. Totally changes the feel for the location.
---
I frequent it less regularly since it's less convenient to hit up the workstations and beds there but for a new character going in, it's definitely an improvement.
---
Thank you for the response. I've been getting a good response and maybe it'll help settle pricing across the "market" LOL!
---
bra how do u have so many caps i haven't even gotten past 400 and i  trying to save up for a jet pack
---
Pretty sure it’s the house with the guitar sword that by Vault 76.
---
Nothing click-bait about calling a spade a spade: Todd knew the game was in worse shape than they admitted, but released it anyway as a full-price top-tier title.
---
I play, and I like playing, but I know I'm playing a giant fucking shadow of what was promised when they tried to patronize us with, "please be patient with some bugs" and charging full price.
---
 At level 34 Ammosmith a 2* card. becomes available in Agility. That allows 40% more for 1* and 80% for the 2* card. 
---
 At the same level the Intelligence Chemist 1* card gives you double anything at a chem bench.
---
As you grow up you'll learn to not be so upset over trivial matters. In due time man...you should be glad other people have the opportunity to get this skin. I personally don't think it's worth spending 20$ on atoms to get so I won't be getting it.
---
Thank you for the response.  That makes sense. 50 seems to be the average "high" with people wanting to pay 25 for some.
---
Thank you!
---
LOL! Bought Atoms! 
---
Nice one :)
---
2 rabbits on the hill of the enclave bunker and 2-3 squirrels at the gate to whitespring closest to the train station
---
Well when ur dry to sell let me know
---
I don't actually team up, because I don't want a thousand small letters stuck to my walls...........
---
Anything else?
---
Craft a frog jar at the chemistry bench under science projects. Then find a frog in the wild (whitesprings pool is a good place to start). Press A/X to grab it instead of killing it. Then just craft it as an item in your camp.
---
Thank you for the response. Thar's a good price. Feedback I've been getting (well, you can see for yourself) is anywhere from 25 to 50 with 100 as a top
---
Is this.... a russian bot?
---
Yeah why can't I milk the Brahmin? lol I've only been able to do two so far.
---
I completely agree. I think Bethesda pushing the PVP in survival is a big mistake, just let it happen organically. There are two camps it seems, people who want to jump in specifically to get in PVP encounters (death match type) and people who want to enjoy the game without the disappointing design choices (subjective opinion of course) of adventure mode.
---
Thank you for the response. Good information, thank you. I'll factor that in. Check the other responses!
---
Litterly everyone agrees with the score board thing! Hiding in a building cause i heard a PA guy walking around on the first floor was intense and very much the way i like to play.
---
I mean, if you really want something, you should buy it when you can. If you're just buying everything for the hell of it, then yeah wait for the vaulting sale
---
Thank you for the response. That seems to be close to the average response. I appreciate the feedback,
---
...every time you die.
---
Thank you for the response. You're bang on the market average (see the other responses)
---
Go slow, explore everything and soak in the lore. Rushing the game through power levelling just rushes you to an end game that can be slow and grindy. Enjoy the lower levels while you can.
---
Also, don't use ammo when you don't need to. Melee is quite good and sometimes more effective than guns in a lot of cases.
---
I thought this by like the 2nd week. It's almost like someone forced them to add Fortnite type mechanics into a Fallout game...
---
Thank you for the response. Apparently that is a good deal. Fair anyways (See the other comments)
---
r/subsiwishithoughtifellfor
---
There are some things you can do wrong. Remember that you have to equip your perk cards for them to work, to echo a recent post that made me laugh. And if you use Pharma Farmer or another perk that gives you more loot from containers, you have to actively search the containers with a button press, Y on Xbox. I was damn near level 40 before I noticed that.
---
Because somebody already milked it. Either server hop flatwoods
---
OR
---
build a fertilizer in a camp/workshop. Milk the cow. Store it. Place it once again. Milk. And repeat.
---
I don't understand the idea of this post. 
---
You think that Bethesda is cynically holding back expanding camps because of greed. 
---
And you're ready to fully embrace and reward that behavior.
---
Yeah, this isn't going to fly with this community. Pay2win isn't a good thing to encourage.
---
Players can create vendors at their camps, stations let you trade legendary gear for "scrips" which exchange for more legendary gear at Pleasant Hills station, and there's giant fucking sheep beasts terrorizing the bog.
---
Happy travels!
---
Thank you for the response. Give me a day and check out the vendor north of Top O'the World just a short drop off Skullbone Vantage. I'll be dropping the price tomorrow based on yours and the other comments.
---
I think you've just been a bit unlucky.  I don't mind having someone watching my back when I'm out farming legendary items or just wondering around looking for interesting things the devs added in or things I might have missed.  Only get a bit disappointed when people try to copy what I'm doing without understanding why I'm doing it, just as an example if I'm looking over a tall cliff in power armor trying to find a way down for you don't come up to the edge and fall off, I'm in the armor as a safety measure.
---
Sheep beasts?
---
I'm not sure how I feel about this :p
---
IF YOU’RE IN MORGANTOWN, go ahead and activate him so he can check in on the storage rooms.

lol no you're not playing shit. giant fucking shadow of what was promised...do you not get enough attention or are you paid to lie? 🤣
---
I cannot help but hear Kevin Kline voicing his character. Think of a slight twist to Mr. Fishoeder of *Bob's Burgers*.
---
Too true on the time part - I maybe play 20 hours a week? And a good 1/3 of that is just messing with my stash - manufacturing, bulking, selling to vendorbots - to make room for more goodies.
---
That's a wonderful insight/outlook on the 90% weight reduction. I honestly never understood it if you could have a better stat to make the carnage unstoppable... but this makes a crap ton of sense. If all the weapons I dropped into my mule last night had weight reduction... I probably wouldn't be in a mule situation.
---
It still shocks me there isn't a perk for Rifle weight. They can get as heavy as a Gatling gun easy. Fingers crossed a perk revamp is coming soon 🤞
---
Once upon a time there was a Great War. It was so great that everyone DIED. ^(the end)
---
They only asked us to be patient with some bugs *after releasing the "beta"* - which we all bitched about at the time because *it wasn't actually a beta* but a stress test - then released the "fully completed" game (same "beta" we just played hours earlier) immediately afterwards regardless, while now saying they were in over their heads with a shit show off a release *and knew it*. Just because they can make it better later doesn't absolve them of doing it wrong from the start.
---
Nothing is being misrepresented.
---
And then there’s that little girl’s corpse at the creamery that kinda got me a little bit
---
Make vegetable paste, and sell them. Or do event missions
---
Nah, camp damage is a fantastic cap sink.
---
It's just something you will have to deal with.
---
You're still lucky. You have a common interest that she "gets' ///my GF can't understand why I enjoy it so much and never mind explaining the timewarp difference of 5 minutes "real" time vs 5 minutes of game time. .....As long as it didn't go like that one episode of "Big Bang Theory" where Penny gets grungy LOL
---
Earlier I was climbing up to Top of the World, encountered a level 91 glowing deathclaw.  Ran back down, into a squad of level 48 super mutants.  Juking the deathclaw and mutants trying to get into my power armor when Prize-Bot comes up and gives me 100 pre war money.
---
Yeah, I always do that too on that version.
---
You have demolition perk maxed out. That helps with damage.
---
Extra emphasis on the ew
---
How do you tame the animals?
---
Nice ad hominem. Have any arguments?
---
^(Who else could it be?)
---
Eh, there's enough on the ground that having one on the roof for sniping is worth having.  So many on the ground will just get in the way of each other.
---
Prostitution
---
Finally something I’m good at
---
Ah yes, my second favorite thing to do in fallout, eating the random corpses spread around the wasteland
---
If you’re on PS4 hit up drcjmartin. He runs a medical office in game and he’ll help you remove mutations and has all serums to replace unwanted losses
---
You need wasteland wanderer and animal friend maxed out
---
LOL...isn't that ALWAYS the way though? I start to sweat when the bad guy is at maybe 20% health and I have gone through 80% of my ammo on the only gun that'll do damage (knowing too if i stop, they'll regenerate and then I'm pooched) .... so there I am, blasting away, trying to do math in my head about damage ratios!! LOL ....ah .... the math we never thought we'd use!
---
Im not managing to sell bufftatts ect at 15 caps. If I see them at 10 I buy them, if Im low on particular kind. And I rarely see.
---
I usually go for plans I haven't learned yet, ammo if I don't feel like making some myself, and occasionally legendaries
---
You can buy caps if that's what your into.
---
You say tato, I say /TRADE/-oh!
---
I’d rather not spend real money
---
You wanna address any of the points raised in my first post?
---
Well, people watch TV and read books and listen to music, too. All without any benefit.
---
Craft and sell stims with super duper and chemist on. Easiest way to get materials for crafting is to farm ticks at lumber yard below Vault 76 and moonshiners cabin and server hop
---
Butt stuff for scrip?
---
That's how it's done!
---
Munchkin; a type of gamer who wants to "win" no matter the cost. They don't care about roleplaying, they dont care about storytelling, they dont care about other players, they just want to OP as fast as possible even of that means buying, bargaining, or bullying their way to "be the best". They're the type of person who expects to have a bag of holding and a vorpal sword at level 1. They're the gamer who will pay exorbitant amounts of money day 1 to have all the twink gear in games like COD or Battlefront. They want maxed stats, OP weapons and armor, invulnerability, invisibility, and the ability to one shot everything.
---
This is GRAFTON’S MAYOR speaking. ^(Who else could it be?)
---
Yeah I originally did a shotgun explosive build on this character and I stopped playing for a bit back in January due to being burnt out and then I started playing again a few weeks back and I knew they had nerfed them but I didn't realize how bad till I started using them so I decided to switch to heavy guns after I found a vampiric 50 cal and now also Gatling and minigun and I am leveling up to get the perk cards for it now and if you don't mind me asking what's your build like?
---
You didn't raise actual points, you made ad hominem and false equivalency errors then doubled-down with a tirade.
---
Reference?
---
Your welcome. Umm their is more than one server bud. The odds of me landing on same server as you to be able to check out your camp are slim to none. 
---
If you'd like to sell them to me, I'll definitely buy. But we'd have to temporarily add eachother as friends to be able to join on same server. 
---
That being said, I'm on ps4, what are you on? We might not even be on same platform lol ...
---
You can't really run out of recall circuit boards to buy.
---
pretty much if its not combat armor or leather most armors need love 
---
really you should be able to get the scout armor schematic from the enclave computers I mean they know how to build power armor and all the other stuff but not the more basic armor? it just seems goofy
---
Brutal. But fuck Paul Tassi.
---
Thanks brother
---
Oh you'll learn to regret those words and not be so dismissive in the future. Lol
---
6 months was plenty of time, even if they needed to find a new manufacturer.
---
Aren't people allowed to have opinion? It's easy to bash an opinion, but not easy to come up with your own. The game still needs a lot of work as it was released prematurely, but can't deny that recent updates do improve the game. For 20 bucks (or maybe less now?), it's really a steal especially for fallout fans. That's all. Cheers.
---
I heard that some people had been updated on the progress of their canvas bags of the last month through help tickets from Bethesda but not sure how reliable that info is
---
I agree. Early on it’s rough being solo, but by the time I hit lvl30 I was somewhat established. I’m not sure how many PC players there are by comparison to console. 
---
Some of the challenge new players are having is that too many players have alt characters. Many of the top level players have starter a mule account and a third character cause their getting bored. So us mid level players are Leary about helping out others that might not actually need it.
---
Well, while this does solve the problem of duping, it undermines the struggle actual players put in to farm gear. I spent more than 150 hours building an amazing pvp character, just to be able to not use it. If this happened, I would honestly quit. All my hard work gone in an instant.
---
I had an opposite experience:
---
So Im in survival mode and there is a 26 and 3 by my camp that both get gunned down by turrets. Leave their bags alone and i even revive the level 3 as he wasnt dead yet.
---
I store all my turrets so they can use my facilities. I even drop two 1* legendaries for the level 3. (26 is gone by now) Go to my fermenting table and the level 3 uses a pitch fork on me. I die.
---
Wondering why he was so bold, he took my bag of not so many goodies and left. About 10 min later, I put my turrets back up and I hear one of them rev up. This level 3 bastard is back, and my gatling gun + turrets do not hesitate. Obviously he goes down in a second. I grab his bag of goodies (had a lot more than I) and go back to my base. 2 more times he stops by and I burn him down so fast, stealing his bag twice more. Overall, a net gain! Anyway. Just thought it was interesting at the aggressiveness, even though I show a little kindness in Survival. Guess it goes nowhere in the wasteland of West Virginia.
---
I wish I didn't know this, now theres a non zero chance of me wasting a large amount of ammo shooting his corpse over and over.
---
Well I want to be OP sure, but I also do care about roleplay and story, as well as interaction with other players, hence my posts arguing for the validity of raiding as a roleplaying part of the game.
---
I think everyone, to some extent aspires for power, especially in RPG games, otherwise there would be no real goal with your character's own progression.
---
If people were truly the opposite of these so called "munchkins," then there would be alot less fuss about nerfing things and balancing the game from the "PvE only" crowd.
---
I got updated 
---
Source:got an email saying they are getting ready to ship it
---
Buying atoms is for supporting the game. You want new updates? Buy atoms ;)
---
I can... but I honestly can't agree with their point here. If this were truly the case, making players choose - wouldn't a shared stash space amongst 5 characters make more sense? There is no muling at that point unless you've boughten two copies. Which from a business standpoint, isn't exactly unheard of. They really couldn't be so oblivious to think players wouldn't take it into their own hands to double their stash... 
---
That aside... after writing the above... it actually makes me really grateful it is the way it is 😂 Thanks for the smack of reality Chaos 🙂
---
its in the cranberry swamp.
---
I really do hope so, I thought being in a world with blood-hungry players that were a hundred levels more than me would be fun and keep me on my toes - and it does, but other than that theres not much to it, its not like I could scare them back. Now that I have experience I know Id prefer everyone starting out even.  
---
PS happy cake day!
---
Alright then, you made baseless claims in several posts and can hold Bethesda accountable by stomping your feet and not buying their games from now on 😂
---
Someone stole it.
---
Across the creek from the Overseer's camp is a random spawn point and there are cats pretty often.
---
I'll choose for myself as I decide, but thanks for the suggestion.
---
👀
---
So you were the one that did that!?
---
r/talesfromappalachia
---
I'm 100000% in favor of this.
---
Ah the complications that innocents never consider!! Ya we can pretty much forget ever meeting LOL ...I'm on a PC, but tip of the hat to you on a PS4, at least you have a decent sized screen :)
---
How is it a cap sink? I've literally never used a single cap to fix anything.
---
I got you:
---
[https://screenrant.com/bethesda-e3-fallout-76/](https://screenrant.com/bethesda-e3-fallout-76/)
---
Check out that second to last paragraph. Couldn't be more cringe-worthy or out of touch with reality.
---
Go to camp mcclintock and enlist. You'll need a driver's license from the DMV in Charleston.
---
 Tell J-47 we said hi! :)
---
You got scammed. I don't know how much longer you need to wait until you accept it
---
how is having more space to build your camp pay to win? especially if you are using caps the in game currency?
---
I had to move my base because my HMG and Missle turrets ignored a regular radroach spawn and I got tired of constantly fixing those three turrets because of one stealthy stealthy boi's destruction.
---
Sure, are you on PC? ...as it was just pointed out to me, between the number of servers and platforms ..... anyway jimmi700 is pretty easy to remember. I'll look for ya! (Unless you're using a diff handle)
---
Wow, I can have like 400 5.56 per time on sale, because I just dont have the stash space.
---
I've always wondered does it and shotgun shells sell well, but I don't have enough room to really measure it. 
---
I mean in sense as on trading subreddit they are both sold below 1 cap so Im not sure if it sells well ingame.
---
Bethesda said that?
---
Ive had this happen with regular scorchbeasts too
---
This would be absolutely awesome, Maybe include some of the other golf courses.
---
Nooo not moo moo
---
That’s some brutal shit
---
Explosive energy weapons were removed from the loot tables quite some time ago due to their strange interaction with the effect. They said they would be retooled, and returned to the loot pool at a later date if my memory serves.
---
They took his ~~Job~~ Frog!
---
Dey terk his Frawg!!!
---
*Der derk de Derg!!*
---
I’d definitely wait till it’s completely done. The game still has some pretty nasty bugs and glitches so starting it before it’s all the way done could cause some issues.
---
Yeah I have exactly the same question? Are the craftable? I've seen players buying and sometimes selling plasma explosive plan, but I'm not even heard a bottlecap mines to exists.
---
Although being so rare that I've not even seen anyone want to buy one, makes me suspect it's dev room item.
---
I've already done the DMV quest though. Can it be done twice?
---
Energy weapons were never supposed to have explosive effect in there loot pool.
---
There is no way to fix the weapons as they were never intentded to work this way the only way to fix is to remove all explosive energy weapons from game.
---
This is what happens when people dupe
---
Capitalism is the only way
---
i feel every time i log in..there is a scorchbeast attacking my camp
---
If you've completed it your good. Go to mcclintock and enlist and train to get your military id
---
Isn't that the quest where you run the obstacle course etc?
---
If you look at game companies that failed / bankrupt, they spent lots of money on dev, features addition, bugs fixes, etc BEFORE the game was actually sold to public. I think Beths know this and do the opposite. Hype it and sell the game first with gift bait, then fix or add later :) It is not ethical, but that is the way most game businesses are being run to be PROFITABLE.
---
Yeah, and some shooting
---
I understand what you mean, but I’ve been downloading for 7 hours. My internet is not good.
---
That's the problem. I've done those quests already.
---
7.62x54r
---
But 12 days ago you were posting about how stable it is so idk maybe you just enjoy the smell of your own farts.
---
Again I'm not saying they didn't do anything wrong or anything like that. What my point is that your title clearly says "admission" and other things out of context and inaccurate because what they said is different to how you try and interpret their actual words and the create misleading click bait titles. You're focussing on what you wanted them to say and then talking class action with changed wording and false admissions out of context.
---
While I agree on the need for type-for-number, speeding up the gain rate on a slider after a set amount is actually normal. It operates under the assumption that if you're going more than X, you're probably going much further than X, and speeds up accordingly.
---
Take all your plans.  Which take up weight and sell them. 50 to 100 caps each. If you have super duper and chemist make chems and sell em.   Go around other camps. Buy cheap serums - don't pay over 400 and then resell for 900...
---
In my opinion you could play the game, crate a new character, and go to travle around Appalachia, I spend all my game hours in FO76 and I can say taht I love it! You maybe find some issues like frozen game or game crash but that also depends on your connection ;)
---
Then go backtrack to see what part of the quest you left off on.  Obviously you didn’t fully finish
---
I never even thought of doing that. Thanks for the idea!
---
you sir made a tipsy man happy, good luck on your quest with your slimy adorable friend.
---
Same here! Never want to see campfire again
---
I love giving wanted to asshats taking my ammo factory.
---
Suffer beotches.
---
There were more than a few upgrades that didn't make the cut unfortunately.
---
I'd kill for something in a pipe weapon that used shotgun shells.
---
Thanks will keep in mind
---
Very well put. It definitely does put it into perspective what the trading life is like. This last Sunday I traded out all of my lead, plastic, screws, and steel - three times. Once you get a keen eye for the good stuff, it's freaking everywhere. Before I got into trading, it wasn't uncommon for me to run out of a material even though it had the magnifying glass.
---
You put much trust in the system! I can't do it. I once dropped 3 semi decent, super fun legendaries because I was over encumbered and they were heavier than - . Ran up the road to kill a sheepsquatch, came back, and the bag wouldn't load.
---
I literally sat there for a good 5 minutes just staring at the bag waiting for them to pop up. Started moving my head off &amp; on the bag, holding a few seconds in between. Nada. Finally said oh well and left it. Now I fight over encumbered all the time 😂
---
They need a weapons pass to add mods and continue to buff damage , as well as, making that damn perk be pa or non pa... the rest can come or go.
---
Bought it just 'cause.  Looks awesome.  Now I need to make a set of T-61 now...
---
Not bugged, but is particular.
---
I usually make caps by grinding at Westek and Harpers Ferry and selling off weapons. Works best when you're high level though.
---
T-61? I've never even thought of mixing armor..
---
Who you callin antisocial punk?!  
---
Now get off my damn camp and leave me and my alt alone.
---
OMG Those Liberators are a pain in the azz --- especially when u try to solo this while being swarmed by about 10-20 of those things at a time.
---
Your primary source for caps is vending bots. 1400 daily. Vending is more about extra as well as having a convinient way to get rid of stuff we don't really need ourselves.
---
Agreed. Had to shift around a bit in front of the entrance for it to hit.
---
Maybe you scraped your id
---
Yeah, I kind of agree. I sometimes luck into people being willing to help with stuff, but at least on PC, there's no real good way to contact people in game, so if you want help you have to toss out a bunch of team requests and hope someone responds. 
---
Even if you're trying to "help", this morning I did the Path of Enlightenment by myself, and was holding the Mothman so people could come take a picture for the weekly, and only one person showed up and he didn't have a camera or a mic. 
---
However, I'm mostly a solo player because I prefer Fallout that way. But it would be nice to have a better system in place to contact other players.
---
One hopes
---
Even if the quests are greyed out? Do you think it will start over again?
---
They just featured LucioBall on Overwatch, that's fun too.
---
Todd says challenge accepted
---
Dang.... what did you give her? She all over you lol
---
But seriously, thanks for the heads up!
---
Those are functional? Huh, didn't know that
---
If that's the case, can I get a new one?
---
I dont think so but i honestly dont know
---
That's the one that goes peeew peeew peeew?
---
Once survival mode comes out of BETA:
---
-Make adventure and survival two separate characters
---
-Make survival characters start over
---
-No legendaries
---
-No mutations
---
Also my opinion is to change from the top 3 people that have been alive the longest show up on the map, to the top 3 highest level players. I think it would play a lot better that way.
---
There should be seasons, and every season should have a seasonal modifier.  
---
Could be boring, like 2x caps drop.  Could be interesting, like all headshots are critical hits.  Could be interesting, like X spawns are always Deathclaws.
---
Go to area, kill with melee weapons that don't cost ammo to kill with. Clear and collect everything. Sell at nearest vendor. Move to next area...
---
Survival has some sort of bug where itll continue to put you in the same server, I experience it ok console as well.
---
Stuck ?   Shit, I’m lucky to hit 30
---
Damn I want those plans!
---
... holy shit... are you having a stroke, mate? type five smiley faces for yes.
---
Try a staple of 6-15
---
Havent heard of that yet. Is it a paint for rifles? Or...
---
I'll give that player a miss - I've seen that IGN - I hate that sh#t.
---
Yup. Best time is when you have friends to back you up.   I played mostly solo so it tooks some time to level up.  But if you use all the team perks you can all level up at a much quicker rate.
---
I've passively brought in about 4k this week just from my junk extractor and world scrap. Anything above my set limit on each item gets sold. Excess screws, springs, ballistic fiber, etc go in the camp vendor. The rest goes to the robot vendors until I hit my cap limit for the day. I leave my whole camp unlocked and I still always come home to a full extractor. Also I horde purified water at my camp and vendor that, too. It's not Scrooge McDuck money, but it's easy peasy.
---
Noticed they seemed to prioritizing targets at range a few times, put it down to line of site.
---
Personally, I'd love to pay a few atoms for a gas mask I can craft and isn't pug ugly, but then I'd have to see another week of people REEEEEEing over P2W for something you can literally pick up almost anywhere.
---
Excellent idea. Now we just need two CAMPS next to each other. Each one builds a giant soccer goal. The space between the CAMPS is the play field. We can start with 3v3 tournaments. Once it catches on, we’ll have enough teams for a World Cup. This is perfect.
---
You have earned a nickname 'cow killa'.
---
Not on PC .😑
---
[deleted]
---
Did they say when?
---
My problem is the exact opposite, my chat settings reset to zero every time I log in.
---
Most I've had is like 1500, I don't know where the caps are flowing from
---
They are already fixed, they decided to remove them from the loot pool several updates ago, that was the solution. Thank dupers for the recent surge of explosive energy weapons.
---
What do you mean you leave it unlocked?
---
So no more Funky Cold Medina at prime? Well noted, thank you.
---
They go from one extreme to another.
---
Heavy weapon week gets a shitty vats (unusable ) bug killer, melee gets a god tier.
---
Wtf
---
My opinion (and I'm not even going to read the article), is that anyone who goes to SCREENrant for GAME reviews... is not the sort of people I'd want in FO76 anyways. lol
---
I don't care how many of us love movies/tv shows, as well as gaming, and are aficionados of either/both categories... You're targeting the wrong crowd by publishing the review on a site that isn't meant for it. To be, that kinda implies dude has an agenda or an ax to grind against FO76 or Bethesda. 
---
That's just my 2 caps worth... :)
---
Smart move to block them! Now everyone will! Haha!
---
Noice
---
Not so much caps, but more with atoms as you mention in your OP, because atoms can be bought with cash.
---
I think you have to wait till it's fully complete. Being that it's online game and incomplete data means you could maybe take advantage of glitchs,. I imagine that it won't allow you to play till it's completed and then downloaded the latest patch.
---
Nice, isn’t it?
---
I had a legendary glowing ant do most of the work on a legendary glowing something or other deathclaw the other night.   Sick
---
One Always spawns in the bootleggers shack. The basement area it is behind a Lock level 3 tho
---
It's a different type of hunting rifle.
---
Not 100%
---
That's why everyone puts it at 2 stars so they don't get new ones
---
Well everyone's gonna have some dead cows
---
You have to kill 50 enemies anyway. I was able to repair it 3x and kill 50 enemies all at same time. It doesn't actually have to break, just needs enough damage for you to repair it. So after killing every 10 scorched or so, i was able to repair.
---
It's valid, but your title isn't a good one.
---
That quest is out of the way, long, and annoying.
---
It’s def worth it to some people
---
Caps vs time.   Caps wins
---
You can use the same crossbow to get the three repair requirements. Use it as a melee against a couple low level enemies and repair again.
---
Except that practice is explicitly forbidden. A finished product is a finished product, and Todd openly admitted to knowingly selling a product that was far beneath what they were pitching. You can like the game, I do. You can play the game, I do. You can want more content in this game, I do (certainly another hot-button issue). So, at what point do we also roll over and accept explicit wrongdoing without adequate amends - *whatever that may be, not the point*? It is unreasonable for me to accept your contentment with Bethesda's failure as the the bar for ending grievances.
---
It’s 3 per day after day one.  Do the math
---
That's the main problem I've found with survival mode. The only thing that can really be done with it is essentially a big deathmatch to steal Aide and Junk, then hop to a normal server to sell it off.
---
Good?  It’s god tier.  Someone in bethesadas dev team has no idea what they’re doing.
---
Only in the last week I have had this issue. Only about 2 weeks ago I never had an issue with queen loot i could do damage with no problems. however within the last week I pumped even more rounds than usual into since I crafted more for my normal sbq weapon. When it goes down though there is nothing in it when I make my way over to it and this last time it happened to my friend too but he was near by it and saw stuff in it but also was disappearing in it and was able to grab the weapon before others.
---
I mean, we still take quests and events from Sanjay and ither dead dudes via pre-recorded messages. What's the difference? It's not like we would be directly seeing Maxson.
---
Fix it good and weapon artisan are both max level 3 cards that allow repairing an item to 200%, they have no impact on weapon durability loss.
---
Ouch, I don't quite have that but I have a bull's tolerance. After I had my wisdom teeth pulled, the dentist prescribed me some of the strongest painkillers available. Since they were so strong, you absolutely couldn't take more than one dose per 4 hours. Within two or three days I was already feeling pain before that period ended, and it lasted well over a week
---
Should be a slightly used crossbow on the archery range. Even if it's in pristine condition 10-20 shots should wear it down enough to be repairable.
---
Noice, thank you!
---
 I've got keypad doors locking the whole setup, but my machines posted at the windows so they're still accessible. I've also got 1 locked inside themed as my bar restaurant. Only food and booze.
---
So strange... Mine never degraded to a point where it would need repairs. Granted, I made it a level 50 and stuck around low-level areas so I could take out a whole bunch with ease. Might try to make a lower-level one and see if it breaks easier.
---
You might not find this too helpful, but honestly, level 9 is pretty low. I think it's reasonable that you're struggling to find building mats at that level. As you continue leveling, you'll find more and more, to the point that you'll have more than you know what to do with.
---
Literally. You'll get to the point that you're just getting rid of stuff because you have too much, and not enough room to store it. You'll bulk it and sell it to vendors. Or try to sell to players, but everyone has too much of everything.
---
I'm not trying to make light of your situation, but as you continue, you'll find that you've got more materials than you can make use of, sadly. I'd suggest just enjoying the fact that you can only do what you can do with your camp. Keep exploring and leveling, the rest will come. Let it be what it is, don't worry, and enjoy the world of 76.
---
That said, if there are specific building mats you just can't find, list those, and I'm sure someone can help direct you to a location for those.
---
Point is when it comes E3 time and people like this actually make a paycheck with garbage writing, and that these sorts of articles show up if you search like Fallout 76 + E3 or whatever, notice the url, and Screenrant is one of those sites that's gonna be highly ranked, this is the kind of drivel people will see. Basically just lies and conjecture.
---
Well, we do have what seem to be very limited ranged Nukes.
---
(not sure of the true range of the weapons)
---
Not a bad idea, thanks!
---
I would also like this
---
That's odd. I've seen the plans but never found a ready crossbow over there. Still, I'll check again!
---
I’m having too hard of a time staying alive, which is why I picked a tricky place to put my camp so I can kill scorchers to level up and build stuff but it’s not working out, thank you. I will definitely try what you recommended. Hopefully it gets easier lol
---
I would just make a small wood house and focus on leveling.  As u progress in the game u will get materials
---
grahm has them but its not guaranteed you would need someone to hold him while you jump in and out to reset his inventory
---
This is a joke, right?
---
Take my upvote, although this is sarcasm, some people on this sub acted this way a month ago with repair kits!
---
Nope, no joke lol 🥖
---
You sure?
---
I had that same thing happen at that power substation down in the cranberry bog outside watoga!
---
Theres a challenge that u gotta kill like 76 scorched. Do that and should damage the crossbow enough
---
My favorite thing to do as a seasoned player is provide a great experience for new comers. To find them in over their heads, fighting something beyond their means and getting their ass handed to them, and to be able to step in and support them in the fight. And maybe drop some lot for them too :)
---
Skin color ain’t shit to no stags
---
You guys made me smile! My fiance and I started cracking up! Thank you!
---
Thanks for the heads up, I missed Blackbird the first time.
---
I’ve always wanted to get a picture of a nuke coming straight down on my head.
---
Ah never mind, I was thinking of another plan that I farm near there lol
---
Are you on PC?   
---
If "Yes", continue to next line. If "No", I can appreciate how that'd be annoying!
---
Do you have any of the .ini (settings) files --specifically Fallout76Prefs"-- in "Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76" set to Read Only? If "Yes", continue to next line. If "No", I got nothin' then, sorry. :P
---
YOU FOOL! lol Of *course* it gets reset every time after you've changed it in game, as it has been unable to write those changes to the settings files! ;)  
---
Go remove their "Read Only" flag and all should be fine after that. If it was done by any of the Settings Tweaker programs or guides found on Nexus and you don't now how, it's simple: Go to the folder I mentioned above, Right-Click the file(s) and get "Properties" (on each individually), it's on that first window that opens up. Untick the box and click "OK". You should be good to go now.  
---
Files to check: Fallout76, Fallout76Prefs, and perhaps also Fallout76Custom (if that one isn't there, don't worry)
---
FO76 is actually the first game from Beth in the FO/TES series that doesn't have a typical Launcher (BethNet is different), which means that if you've modified those files, traditionally you've had to set them to Read Only or that launcher will overwrite your custom settings... As such, 76 doesn't overwrite them, even if you've change settings in the game. It simply searches for the matching string and modifies it, leaving everything else intact. 
---
I know this because I have mine modified **heavily**, with tons of extra commented-out lines, and mine are not set to Read Only, yet they remain intact... even after updates :D Kudos to Bethesda for that!
---
It's slim that it's your problem, but it might be. Hope it helps, if so.
---
My spot too!  Lol
---
I agree with 3, but I feel like the first two wouldn't really work.
---
For 1, Heavy Weapons are supposed to be unique. You don't just start off a game that's supposed to be a long burn and throw someone the equivalent of a .38 death machine. Part of the reward for playing is building to the point of getting better gear. It's the same reason why there isn't a Level 5 Handmade or Level 5 Ultracite Power Armor.
---
For 2, it's a simple Balancing function (Not to mention realistically practical). Heavy weapons are exactly that. Heavy. They're low mobility, high damage, and usually high fire rate. I run a Heavy Weapons build, and my damage output doubles that of some other builds. 
---
You want to take the build that doubles damage and give them a smaller frame, less maintenance (Not needing to scrounge for Fusion cores, etc.), and double their mobility? It would be the same as reverting back to when you could one-shot the Scorchbeast Queen with the more ridiculous TSE weapons.
---
Not to mention that a 40lbs Heavy Weapon that has immense recoil even when in power armor would likely snap your wrists. There's a reason why firearms that big are usually mounted.
---
The fact that the armour mods for this and for Marine armour are completely vague is just laziness on the part of the programming staff.  It costs them NOTHING to type in Torso, Leg, or Arm in the space for the name of the thing ...... when we can't look at the code and see what it is supposed to attach to.
---
The fact that the producer of the game hasn't called the programmers out that made the lazy ass error, and made them fix it in 6 months of complaints, when it would be a 10 second repair, shows just how little the producer cares for the user friendly aspect of the game, verses its sales figures to NEW players that don't yet own the game.
---
That Ant was a beast. He ended up killing the glowing deathclaw lol
---
Make sure its not being repaired over 100% condition. My buddy used an improved repair kit, so took forever to get down from 150% condition to repair it.
---
When you get to whatever parts missing it’ll probably kick in.
---
I mean, we’re talking Bethesda level coding here, so no promises.
---
The end user will not know when the rate kicks in and by how much.   Also, it takes  some time for end users to adapt.  
---
Changing the rate after a while is just cover for not knowing how to do a proper interface.
---
Class Action or New Industry Standard is my (admittedly false dichotomy) framing of what happens - they're either held accountable or they're not. If they're not, it's just one more log on the fire of getting away with something that is expressly forbidden, watching it become accepted practice despite existing regulations. Maybe it's more federal regulation instead of a class action, like with loot boxes, I don't know. But if nothing else comes up against "... Or New Industry Standard", that's exactly what we get. Nothing else was taken out of context.
---
I'd like a NPC companion like Old Longfellow (FO4) or Raul (FONV) they were great company and were useful.  Random talking NPCs with no role except to populate the savage divide wouldn't really add much.
---
Apparently that writer doesn't know that there are still a LOT of people that love and play this game. He just seems like one of those people that gets triggered when they hear "Fallout 76" and immediately feel the need to shit on it, even tho they've probably never played it.
---
ok so forget tbe atoms then, secondly I fail to see how having a bigger camp gives anybody an advantage especially in adventure mode. I came up with the idea while playing with my buddy, he has 3 mules full of caps and nothing to buy, we both enjoy building and we have both filled our camps.
---
Amen 🙌
---
I hate walking to camps and seeing inflated, proud of their stuff, prices. I always wonder how much they actually sell? I'm with you 100%. All bulk is 5 caps less than the quantity it has, junk like screws that can't be bulked - 0-1 cap, maybe two for the screws if I need caps. I vary on plans with categories - more common than a molerat(2c always), fairly common, and kind of rare - anything above that I stash away for a rainy day - I then have sub categories like armor, camp, aesthetic, weapon to make pricing easier on my end without over thinking. Ammo is all 1c each, minus 10mm, fuel, .38, and .44 which are free.
---
The bug that got me was going from 12k caps to 500 caps and back, multiple times in one day thanks to public market forums. Ton of fun for me, but it's definitely not for everyone; over encumbered a lot until I found a buyer etc. It was manageable - was doing good for the week I had under my belt.... then I seen a Vampire Explosive Gatling Plasma for trade and now I'm here. Hunting for my Ferrari, but first I need good bait 😁
---
Finally hit paydirt.   I took a 200% repaired tse dragon and kept shooting her in the face.   That and an anti armor combat shotty.  Thanks for the advice guys.
---
That's great to hear about the scaling, and I would love it if level 20s could be useful. I still doubt their ability to survive long enough to actively engage anything long enough to kill it, but welcome anyone keeping the mobs off me. I never hated anyone who tried their best at the queen even when I begrudged them for bumping up her DR.
---
Thanks for the info. I hadn't noticed the change. We've always just killed her.
---
I think pvp should started whenever someone says something stupid, oh wait that means you would be in constant pvp with everyone. If you dont want to lose your junk store it or dont die , its the wasteland cupcake
---
I've never seen anything spawn broken.
---
This is the true end game activity for the game. Finding a noob and giving them a helping hand
---
Nice
---
Drop by my Vend-o-Mat ("Almost nothing over 50 caps!") just across the river from the Overseer's Camp (it's on the left side of the road coming down from Vault 76, right next to the bridge. Can't miss it), I leave souped-up low level weapons, armor, and various other goodies in a vending machine for free. Help yourself to the veggies, water purifiers, and rad shower out back!
---
I also like to leave suits of power armor outside from time to time, and I'm happy to craft weapons &amp; armor, no charge.
---
Helping new players has been one of my great joys in this game, and I'll keep doing it as long as I can! My name is Lionneserra, I'm on PC.
---
It does get easier. The card system is pretty weird, took me a while to get used to. Make sure you're equipping the skills you select. Check out https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks if you want to try to plan ahead.
---
I really loved melee in fo4, so I went with that in 76. Glad I did, to be honest. It can be a bit tough at the beginning, but you don't have to worry about ammo. Try to plan out what you want to become, and shoot for having that by level 50. But you probably won't quite get there, it might take another 20 levels of picking the skills you need that you didn't get randomly from cards.
---
Once you push through 30-35, it starts getting easier, as your build falls into place. Check out the resources online so you don't end up in places that are too high level for you. At lower levels, stay on the western half of the map, mostly. Sleep in a bed and play a musical instrument for the buffs, try to keep well fed and hydrated.
---
You'll end up with way more food, drinks, and stimpaks than you can use, eventually. This game seems to go from "shit this is kinda hard" to "this shit is really easy" very quickly.
---
Btw this is a joke
---
As a wastelander with a set of scout armor marinating in my stash...
---
I agree with this post!
---
Murgle is always at the old coffee bar outside of Welch. And there's a dead cat upstairs in the house at Wixon homestead.
---
Okay. That’s your fault, not Bethesda’s.
---
It's the brotherhood recon rifle I believe. Its worthless unless you want to do distant thunder a little faster
---
Hard Bargain and selling Purified Water.
---
Take a Workshop or build a bunch of Purifiers in your CAMP (The Junkyard South of Poseidon is A+) and mass produce waters.
---
4c a bottle, you'll make like 200 bottles an hour if you crank out enough Purifers just using the resources available at the shop and the water areas around the Junkyard.
---
\-You need bear arms 3 to reduce weight on heavyguns if you're going to be using, taking and scrapping H.Guns down for upgrades (you are). 
---
  
---
\-Bullet shield up to level 2 is nice, i dont use ANY of the heavy gunner perks, though i probably should and would if i got rid of some cards in chem weight reduction. 
---
\-I dont really run pack rat while im killing, only after the fights over and i need to leave. You should consider a pre-fight phase, and a post fight phase and have the pack rat card set in the latter phase.
---
I personally use Stabilized 2, Bear arms 3, Bullet Shield 2, Bloody Mess 2, One Gun Army 2, Gunsmith 5, Demolitions 4, Fire in the Hole 1, Grenadier 2 (the one that increases radius of explosives) Power User 3 and Power Patcher 3 (for your power armor and core usage)  \[plz note i could potentially put in 3-5 more points if i were to pull my chem weight cards out and just 'deal with it', or found some more legendary weight reduction affixes on armor\]
---
I run a 'gauntlet' of heavy weapons that i rotate depending on how bad the situation is. For easy messes, i use "The Resolute Veteran' Gatling gun. Little harder messes i'll use an LMG or the Two-Shot .50 Cal. For flying scorched beasts, Ill use an Anti-Armor Quad Barrel Missile launcher with Targeting CPU-- fire and forget. I Carry a daisycutter with a merv... for shits and giggles. And for the really hard to clean messes, like the SBQ-- ill use my AAE Gatling Plasma. That baby will chew threw ANYTHING with some high voltage hefe, a tesla mag or some psychotats. 
---
Full- Disclosure, I have recently switched to melee and i enjoy being out of my power armor very much. 
---
My Core stats are: S - 15 P- 3 - E- 3 C - 13 I - 15 - A - 3 - L - 4
---
Thanks a lot.
---
I hope so. I just feel like I suck too much. But I’ve had a few people do missions with me because at least I don’t die and have someone to talk to along the way lol
---
Agreed
---
I saw a video that explained why they won’t to this. 
---
Hey, but at least you have 500 AtomicPoints to spend...
---
“Making chems that are none of your business” I’m concerned but it’s none of my business so 😂😂😂
---
I like to collect plans and weapons!
---
If the end user can't figure out "hold down button, thing go faster," just like most modern systems designed to handle large numbers on a slider, end user needs to put the controller down and throw out the spraypaint they've been huffing. The problem isn't the slider, it's that we don't have an alternative method to just type in the number,
---
there needs to be some kind of karma system, ie you murder someone you get bad karma, you kill someone in mutual pvp then u get nothing, and maybe if you defend yourself after provoked you get good karma. they could easy implement a flyout that asks if you wish to engage in pvp. there’s so much more they could do so it isn’t just hunger games all the time.
---
The setting up vending didn't even occur to me honestly... but I have a hard enough time keeping this stocked as it is. I love that idea though, way to capitalize!
---
Have you tried not playing video games all day and attacking /r sternshow posts over small anti-left details that completely detract from the point?
---
Did you by chance already learn it, or are checking the wrong terminal? I didnt need my ID when I did it
---
You do know you can initiate a claim from anywhere inside the shop then just break whatever is in your way right?
---
I don't think body positions are synced for everyone, pretty hard to play a sport when the 'ball' is in a different place for each player.
---
You might have to go 1080ti and get a better CPU.
---
nah im too busy being a muslim lover who hates america.
---
It's not completely random ...... there is a manipulation in the random generator to make certain outcomes less likely that makes other outcomes become the default.
---
Wood Armour is dropped somewhere between 20 - 30 % of the time in spite of there being about 15 different types of possible armour types (including light/sturdy/heavy variants of Combat, Robot, and Leather Armour, plus Marine, Trapper, Urban and Forest Scout, and Metal).
---
As others suggest, some servers are more generous than others ..... some servers are just crap.  Server Hopping is no longer frowned upon  ... its an essential part of the game.
---
You're welcome
---
Does it give you the debuff to perception like all the in game gas masks?
---
I always seem to get insult bot and I always seem to notice him right before "target acquired". So I just listen to the insult without harming him. 
---
^(Then as soon as he turns around, I reclaim the dignity he stole from me.)
---
No, you can still tame Deathclaws, I tamed one after the last patch. Dunno about Snallys though.
---
I feel like the shopping meta had changed and the gold rush is over... but I still hit every vendor that looks like they won't suck on every map I'm on.
---
What I want:
---
Plans or recipes I don't have and want at reasonable prices.
---
God tier .45 weapons &amp; Vanguard Armor
---
Holotape games
---
Cheap Nuka Colas, Dog Food, Disease Cures
---
Quest items for super cheap (Stingwing Barbs &amp; stuff)
---
What I don't want:
---
To spawn inside your foundation or locked camp.
---
Common plans at stupid prices (no more Buzz blades please).
---
Side note:. If your vendor camp pisses me off, I'm leaving shit on your bed and/or killing your cow.
---
I knowwww and I’m SO DAMN EXCITED
---
Last weeks weapon should of been this weeks. Last week it was a struggle. Taking the workshop became a pvp area.. And then i took my 20s ass to the bog to sneak for hrs. Used stealth boys for the first time. 
---
That was absolutely what i expect for a free weapon.. And it kept all the pvp death match types to a couple predictable areas.
---
This weeks weapon is holy cow good and i got it in 20 mins in the forest... Trains are going to have snipers all week now im sure of it lol.
---
This is a violation of Bethesda's TOS and will most likely result in a ban if you're caught.
---
I'm hoping I can stick with just one, but it all depends on the buyer in my case. That's awesome you were able to drop it though, if it weren't for my treasure hunt I'm not even sure I would have ever made one to be honest.
---
I've seen quite a few places that offered things at a reasonable price,but more often than not, people are delusional with their view of an items worth. 
---
I've got a camp that looks like a bar, and on the second floor are my vending machines. I've got plans and all sorts of shit around 50 caps. The majority of the legendaries I get I sell for 50 - 100 caps just to constantly have cashflow for the scrip sharks.
---
Definitely not atoms. Caps, sure, whatever. Or they could just increase stash space to 1k and call it a day
---
Awesome! Thank you for the Info!
---
That's a great idea to keep someone from stealing ur ammo
---
AGH I CANT WAIT TO FIND A TESLA CANNON OOOOOOH YEAH AND ALSO MY FAVORITE CHARACTER, RAUL!
---
[](/focusedstarlight)I like to call my version of it "God dammit that legendary fell into the staircase again, time to try to blow it back out."
---
Don't feel bad if you aren't a gaming prodigy! The truth is, if you are having fun, and sometimes get that feeling of goosebumps when you come across an incredible view, or survive a fight you never thought you would, that's what gaming is about. It isn't about being perfect, or never making a mistake. It's about the exploration, learning, growing, achieving. Even if those achievements are personal. Make it about you, not about what everyone else is doing.
---
*Cha-Ching*
---
Now that's capitalizing on opportunity.... now I've got the idea of a lvl 50 with weight redux perks and unyielding armor with weight redux. Great.
---
I got an email about a week and a half ago saying the bags was ready to be shipped. 
---
I'm not bent out of shape for a fucking bag. If the helmet was nothing like it was advertised I'd be pissed. 
---
I already know when I get my bag, the nylon bag is going inside it, and both are being stuffed up inside the helmet because the main selling point was the helmet.
---
👉 (_!_)
---
I just got to level 9. I set up my CAMP unit down by Flatwoods. The town is safe and has things that I might want in a camp.  I use the benches, beds, etc in the town. The unit just provides free fast travel back to the town .  Looking around for a real base location for when I understand the game better and know whats important in a base location.
---
Blast city on him and the insult bot. Always talking shit about my mom.
---
Generalize people all you want, once again my post wasn’t even political, do you even listen to stern? Have fun building your base looser
---
Thanks for the offer want to see if I can get a little more.
---
All hail Prince Hops!
---
Well it's a good thing  no one here buys them then.
---
Were we visiting the same airport? Because the one I recall had two floors accessible by wooden stairs and what not plus a basement. The refurbished interior is vastly different than the old one.
---
Yes, but everything in this world has a balance, you cannot have one without the other. The problem is not everyone has the same opinion as you. Some people think it is FAIR because they DO enjoy their game. You cannot have class action lawsuit in small numbers and especially the money involved is very small (like 60 bucks per?). No lawyer will touch this case even with a pole of stick.
---
Was that your camp?
---
I climbed through someone's window the other day and left a note on their bed that said security protocols. All the doors were locked except that one window lol
---
Wasnt what i thought it was when i bought it terd muncher, and whatever anyway
---
Savage level over 9000
---
This now makes me want to bring my team build into this little shindig I've got going 😂 I just really haven't wanted to 'gift' myself a great weapon/armor set on a main character, it almost feels like cheating even though my solo main has some fantastic guns the other could use.
---
I would agree. It appears that FO4 has an instance where Nate's service is remarked by historically-programmed military bots. Perhaps only characters at least as prominent as a veteren war hero get such coincidental conveniences.
---
There is an instance in Beckley where the bots will recognize players holding execute clearance for Hornwright. The bots appear programmed to ignore these credentials to, because what would an executive be among protesters for?
---
Yeah, it was one of the first things I spent atoms on. I too thought it was more of a light (like the various posters that act as lights). I ended up swapping it out for the picture of a beagle. No regrets. 😋
---
i havent listened to this watered down bullshit in years. my base is the shit.
---
Yeah, I had read you couldn't anymore, either, so I was pretty happy when I did. It was in the Bog, kinda between Superior Sunset farm and Drop Site G3.
---
Was growing very frustrated earlier trying to snap words together with neon letters.  Very.
---
I haven't learned it yet. And can you access the terminal to the right of the Fort Defiance main door?
---
No, your base is garbage just like you
---
I use to put on sell bulks of everything. But I wont be bother selling it cheaper than I can get from vendor. Whats the point😛
---
Nope, just not true at all
---
What you might be referring to is if a game has a an NPC class and the objects could be that.  But that would just be the developers arbitrarily naming a class something.  NPC refers to non-player characters and could refer to a character in a text based game or any other (narrattive/design) character non-player controlled.

---
Yeppers think it was in patch few months back. OP prob forgot :)
---
Oh man. Yeah. And a few skeletons I've seen around surrounded by toys and holding teddy bears. It hurts the heart.
---
At least they didn't go so far as to put little baby skeletons in the strollers that are everywhere...!
---
How do you get this weeks weapon? I only play survival but have never got any of the free weapons.
---
Go pick out details that you don’t like on random subs that your not even active on and throw a fit about it
---
New Industry Standard it is. Or new regulations. But it won't be nothing, and I'd rather work towards the better.
---
Power-armor is arguably on par, if not better, with non power armor so how is it a balancing thing?
---
Its in the weekly quests. Super ez this week for a bloodied deathclaw.
---
Haha😉
---
Must be super bored.
---
Maybe you should pay more attention to what you spend your money on then.
---
Nice! My camp is up on Seneca Rocks so I doubt I would be able to send one back to my base anymore.
---
Move your camp 1 foot, rebuild without the actual repair costs.  
---
That is only true if it'll let you place your stored build, else wise your just rebuilding.  
---
Pretty sure my decon shower gets broken I'm not spending any flux on that, I'll just move.

Screenrant is trash. Have you seen their naruto lists? "Top X characters that can beat Naruto: #1 Sasuke" "Top X characters that can beat sasuke: #1 Naruto" and people like Shikamaru and some of the sound 4 make it on those lists lol.
---
Maybe i have enough and its not that big of a deal, but maybe bethesda should make it more clear so i dont stop spending my money on their crap and maybe you should get a girlfriend and quit worrying about my complaints to bethsda loser
---
I think the leather possum badge should count for multiple badges if only because of that deathclaw hide....
---
What they dont know wont hurt em. Hahahaha seriously though..game changer.
---
keep in mind players have almost zero control over where people spawn so in general fucking with people a destructive manner because the geniuses at Bethesda are lacking any foresight or QA is a "dick move"
---
Not really. You can go to most farms on the map and get what you need.
---
i have tatos corn mut fruit for emergency adhesive.  
---
i ise green thumb when i harvest so repairing my plants is a growth industry. 
---
i repair for 1/pick 2, +1 vegetable every repair.
---
Aside from the punch bowl, everything in there was normal items. I don't think any were atom shop items. Just scarecrows, candles, lanterns, and benches.
---
I think so, helps with making beer and food.
---
Also I don't even see how people would even get legendary weapons there. I never find legendary enemies in that place. I'm lucky to find one.
---
Whoever sold their fasnacht beret for 15c during like the first day of player vending. I owe them my life.
---
Ive got better crits on 3, ive passed on grim ripper and got starched genes instead. Dont need strenght as much as my mains stats are 14 Per, 14 Ag, 14 Luck than 3 St (reduced junk weight perk) , 1 End, 4 Ch, 6 Int. that setting gives me all the perks I need.
---
If only you could on PC :/
---
Where you on xbox??
---
I do love watching the fights. I like to take potshots when Super Mutants are fighting a Scorchbeast,too. Not really strong enough to take down the SB, but I get easy XP when it kills the mutants I tag, haha.
---
Thats a good question, would be awesome if it does, but i doubt it
---
The hunger games is the good part tho... The cap farming is the part that keeps most away.
---
Not knowing if the guy who ran past you wants your 12 caps and you potential junk is the fun part. If you dont want to spawn/die then move off somewhere and farm you delicious xp or quests. Stay away from tge forest trains lol.
---
Pvp players tend to end up at one or two places anyway and just keep killing eachother.
---
I have no idea what this means, but it's hilarious. Upvote for you.
---
It's so easy to make it super creepy because the environment is already doing half the work for it.
---
If pictures and a text disclaimer aren’t enough, would you like them to add a giant flashing banner saying it is under armor? Were you upset when you bought a power armor skin and you didn’t get a full suit of power armor with it?
---
I would like just a plain map of Appalachia
---
You funny.. I thought the same thing about the plague mask... but does the flight mask ask a gas mask?
---
Just use the crossbow as a weapon bash item and it'll degrade faster. Also if you do path to enlightenment you can weapon bash the wise mothman. The crossbow will take condition damage even if the mothman takes zero damage. Great if you repaired a weapon above 100%
---
Equip the cards Green Thumb, Chemist, and Super Duper. Green Thumb is the most important, but the others are great too.
---
Plant a ton of Corn, Mutfruit, and Tato. Craft Vegetable Starch, sell it.
---
Harvest Bloodleaf and Sootflower. Just go to the Overseer's Camp and follow the water stream down south picking everything. After Flatwoods, the stream dries out. Turn right and continue harvesting until you get to Hillfork Hotdogs, turn left and continue. The Bloodleafs are always on or near water.  
---
Back to your camp, craft all the Healing Salve you can. Sell it to train station vendors (equip Hard Bargain if you have it).
---
I do this 2-3 times a "day" (when I play) and can easily get 1000 - 1200 caps. Each run takes about 10-15 minutes.
---
Yeah Gun Fu its a must, 2 stars in that for me and Adrenaline just 1 star.
---
Yes a giant flahing banner would be nice, next time i agree with someone else's post il be sure to make sure i mention that
---
Every time I encounter a massive empty warehouse I get sad. Like, if you're not gonna fill the space, make a smaller building.
---
I've seen extra disappointing ones where the building itself seems cool, but they obvs blew all the camp budget and had none left for decorations.
---
I personally call it “Too lazy to walk all the way over to get the 5 hunting rifle rounds practice”
---
If not permanently, at least a quest or event!
---
Are there any mods for scouts armour?
---
They're very very illegal. You won't get in trouble just for having them or being able to craft them buttttttt they're 100% dev room.
---
I just did a quick test, the military ID cannot be dropped, scrapped, or stored in stash. Did u previously have access to the very top floor of defiance?

I think your expectations might be a tad bit unrealistic.

Make sure you see the text box labeling the location in the top right when you're pointing your camera.

Homie, I stopped playing fo76 months ago or whenever anthem dropped, last time I checked my main lv355? with alt characters \~200-2... then gave up on playing xbox in general, life happens.  
---
Anyways I would farm nuke zones and would average 6-9 nukes in a sitting since I had friends who were just as active, and were efficient at clearing times. Solo silo-runs were fun(\~12m), queen(5m) still had a decent drops. As soon as they made it so you could buy all the serum plans the magic(RNG) was gone and we moved onto IRL projects. Hope that helps homie.

I took it from the side where you spawn at.. worked for me.. not if you walk to the front for some reason
---
They're so valuable because they're dev room.
---
There are NPCs
---
You can get them at the enclave bunker in the armory.
---
Just make sure he doesn't get damaged!
---
**I've got enough repair work as it is.**
---
I think you must be really bored to be so concerned with my outlook on the tactical outfit.
---
Right? An event where you dog fight other scorch riders over the wasteland would be pretty epic.
---
Raul will now be a Power Armor paint you can buy in the Atom Shop.
---
On a bench behind the vip homes. Close to where the corpse of the mistress of mystery helper is
---
One of my favorite little details in the game.
---
Should have set it in the campfire
---
How can I be bored with you around?
---
yeah, better processor for sure. 2080 will run it fine, might as well while prices are decent. 1080 will too.
---
Farms are nice for being able to brew and craft vegetable starch. Of course for food too.
---
You don't necessarily need one if you're okay without those benefits. You could always visit other's camps for them or farm non perishable foods too.
---
I know right? I should of stopped responding a long time ago
---
*you guys are getting paid?*
---
And the reason for the change was the exact behavior OP experienced.
---
Same here, and I’ve wondered this as well.
---
The advice always seems to be sell everything you can to a vendor as they have a 1400 daily cap amount, but when seemingly most items are not more than 10 caps, that’s going to take a long time.
---
I concur with the beer thing. Just a couple plants is all you need to do the daily Biv challenge.
---
I want to see Piper **in pain.**
---
Yes. Isn't that where you get ultracite power armor?
---
Well I’m glad you didn’t. Thank you for the entertainment, man.
---
You play survival? Whats you gt? Lol
---
Chat up Wallace about it.
---
Technically yes. I meant human/ghoul NPCs. 
---
Rose was the closest experience to a NPC like other fallout games.
---
did you bychance just leave a server where your camp wasnt available?
---
I .. I really don't get it.
---
The skin looks cool. It's a reference to an awesome aircraft.
---
You're telling me you don't care that it's cool, only that *you paid 18$ (worth of atoms)* and someone else didn't?
---
.. I guess "status symbols" are a thing, but goddamn if it blows my mind when anyone takes them seriously instead of wanting them just because they're cool.
---
way worth it for me.  But I utilize a huge amount of soups/juices and make caps with selling adhesive and purified water.
---
Eh I don't know I kinda only bought it to play with a friend but that didn't work out... 
---
And the game itself is quite boring to me... 
---
I don't know how it is now but when I played the game there were holotape missions and destroy this and kill that missions. 
---
Nothing that interesting, I mean I preordered and only played the early access for like two hours before wanting to blow my own head off for preordering the game.
---
Awww lol
---
Haven’t tried out survival yet, too busy wandering around, picking up garbage and seeing the sites. My GT is Steel Warrior 3, but I’m out of town for a few days and will probably be hooked on the new Destiny content for a while when I get back.
---
use turrets off the ground and you will save a lot of repairing mats.  Should probably use perks to make camp mats cheaper too.
---
Nice, thought maybe i could hunt you down, guess not :/ ever want to get mopped join me gt cl88t
---
Nice picture
---
Plants also bring a bit of life to the CAMP, I've seen some very immaculate gardens but I'm too lazy to emulate :p
---
Dare you to do it in only the tac-ops suit.
---
No. Wait till the price drops.
---
Can happen if someone is looking at your vendor when you leave the server
---
I mean, I’m pretty sure it’s relatively synced as of rn, since I’m pretty sure gibbing a corpse with Bloody Mess makes it explode into body parts for everybody else too
---
Spoilers: your 'victim' moved their CAMP and got the shitty thing back in less time than it took to destroy it.
---
If you want to be a better troll and have apparently only just discovered there are doors on the ammo depot, let me give you some advice on what to do next time:
---
- Find a friend on the server so you can rejoin.
---
- Server hop.
---
- Place down a fast travel mat inside the depot.
---
- Rejoin your friend.
---
Now you'll spawn _inside_ the depot and you can do a dance emoji or whatever dumb stuff you Fortnite kids do.
---
Hmmmm nice detail!
---
Agree with 3.
---
1 would be a cool idea. I'd love a low end option for heavy guns to burn .38 instead of valuable ultracite ammo on small mobs
---
2 is a hard no from me. Heavy Weapons are ridiculous dps, probably the highest range dps around and probably higher than some melee builds. Being forced to use power armor is fair imo.
---
Well im a sneak sniper build so sounds like a fun challenge i may pull off if a mole rat doesnt get me first hahh
---
Fact : robot vendors buy serums for 500 caps with max perks &amp; charisma.
---
There's nothing to think about.
---
I got all serums recipes and they sell like hot cakes at 750.
---
For those who can't afford it or whine about prices : Keep on being poor.
---
Hell it makes going to the theaters seem like an absolute rip off. 560\~ hours and keep rolling here. Some movies I've loved, watched em multiple times in theaters, but nothing film will likely come close for a loooong time
---
Son of a biatch.
---
\*takes out wallet\*
---
I have heard it is not from people who use them regularly.
---
I failed at a quick google, can you use survival items in adventure?
---
It's only available as a legendary from the purveyor. Still, it's nothing special unless the effects are good
---
same here. I was at the southwest corner, close to the street, looking at the front of the building.  Worked first try.
---
as creative as trolls can get :D
---
You're good dude don't sweat it. Something lost in the text that wouldn't be in person.
---
Yeah but they have a kind of memorial service in one of the trailers in Flatwoods, which is kinda worse in a sense...
---
Riot gear. Responders were cops, firefighters and EMTs who then recruited from the general population. It would make sense that they’d have riot gear available and here’s your chance to get a New Vegas looking armor set while still being lore friendly.
---
What platform?
---
what are caps?
---
..... but you just hammer down all the concrete behind the doors and have your friend wipe the wanted.
---
I've never had more than 2k caps
---
I locked MYSELF into a camp today. It was just off the train station near TotW. I was exploring and shopping and the Mr Gutsys from that little raider camp on the highway were shooting at it. The turrets were making short work of them but the door faced that way so I closed it, locking myself in in the process. 1 cap to fast travel to the train station lol.
---
I ran into this same encounter in the mire last week! The sheepsquatch took the radstags down pretty fast though
---
At the least you can grow corn and make corn soup. Its very good for both food and water. So easy. ;)
---
You shouldn’t. Just happened to me today. I moved my camp an inch and it saved my camp as 80 different blueprints....
---
The bane of every Vault dweller’s existence.
---
wow! good find.  That will make a bunch of bullets!
---
Its also a big game... Its suposto have that grind. You need 2 main weapons and somedays you just log on farming up lead or defending all the points you can. Spend caps! Player vendors have tons of ammo and you really dont need all the plans or the caps.. You need ammo. And yes in survival i creep all over the place. Once you set your build you will be much better off but.. 20-35 im finding is a rough spot where you dont have the op perks and enemies are scaling. My name is the same as Here feel free to add me ill play with you. I dont really have any plans when i join.. I just kinda check on my shop the walk out the door and see what where my feet take me lol.
---
Without a player reset after a period of time things will just end up like they are now where AA/E and B/E with assass+sent/cav run around with every mutation possible plastering everyone of every level. It will once again ruin the survival experience. 
---
There are only ever 1 MAYBE 2 survival servers up at a time and hell right now there is a near constant group of 4-6+ people that run together with that exact gear set and kill everyone for hours at a time until the server just dies and they leave for the day if you are lucky but they do the same thing nearly every single day. If the servers were 100 people it would never fill because of how bad PVP is with those weapons and armors available. 
---
No seasons dooms survival to the same fate it has now which is just awful. The most fun PvP I have had was myself a level 9 chasing a level 12 through morgan town taking shots at each other until finally I got them into a bad position and downed them. A near 20 minute running gun battle at sub level 20 has been the single most fun engagement I have had in the hundreds of hours of PvP I have done so far. 1 shotting people takes away the best part of PvP in games like this and that is using the world around you to seek an advantage so you can outplay your foe. Nobody outplays a 1 from kangaroo jack unless they 1 shot them 1st. Snore.
---
They don’t even change the texture, they just stretch his NV texture so it fits PA
---
Except that the problem IS the slider. 
---
They could have used a modern interface option instead of an option from the early '90s.
---
No, that rarely happens where my camp is now. I did hop from pve to survival then back to pve about 10 min later but thats the only noteworthy thing.
---
 I could not get it to work. So I snapped a pic of a Scorched walking in the door and boom.
---
Ah i see. I didnt notice of anyone was there but ill keep an eye on that
---
Hot damn that was a helluva read. I hope that guy who messaged your wife gets what's coming to him.
---
I loaded game last week to find and out my camp loaded into already nuked place and it destroyed everything in my camp and shredded my hp with rads then killed me.  Not able to repair anything at the time because if I loaded into camp I was instantly killed.
---
Ended up having to reload world a few times to get a not nuked one and I don't even have mats to remake my camp due to being almost brand new so I just kind of stopped playing since last week when it happened.  I'll get back into whenever, lol.
---
The event marker bugs out and appears in random places. The actual event is at blackwater mine, near whitesprings. 
---
Next time you see it, fast travel directly to the event rather than walking. Should take you to the right place.
---
It’s always in Blackwater Mine which is next to the Whitespring Station in the center of the map.
---
After the event is initiated by talking to the protection at the entrance of the mine, the event marker moves North of Whitespring. If you fast travel to the event after it’s moved, it will transport you to the door inside the mine just outside of the room with the uranium extractors.
---
No plasma granade plans to have known places they can drop, have been little bit trying to get them myself. Or did you mean bottlecap mines?
---
Like I said I haven't even seen anyone to even wanting to buy one. When you are active on trading anything that's ingame, gets sold or asked for.
---
it showing in the middle of th emap like that is a bug the actual location is blackwater mine east of whitesprings
---
Ah, thank you. Such a pain in the butt.
---
Whoa....
---
That's the other sing next to the bridge. The other sing doesn't do it.
---
I’m going into Survival for the first time later today, and I’m a little nervous. Just want the deathclaw gauntlet. We’ll see how it goes 😬
---
100% agree
---
Had I not been playing since beta I don’t think I would have had any clue. Hope that helps! It is definitely good for leveling and legendaries. :)
---
An ideal survival server experience to me is a bi-monthly reset where legendary effects do not work on players and mutations do not exist. Mods in of themselves are already really powerful additions to normal gear and I think that is enough for a world where PvP is a main point as of now all that happens is a team of XxLuLOneShotxX types farm everyone until the server dies and they leave.
---
your first introduction to how this game works. :D
---
I remember a post like this few months back
---
Some, like myself dont consider any of the current NPCs to be real NPCs, except maybe rose. This is one of the bigger gripes in the game (yea I know), but the wasteland DLC looks to be a 180 among other 180s the ga.e looks to be taking.
---
That would be cool but I was looking for something that is already in game as BSG seems to have little enthusiasm for adding stuff. I think the marine armor fits with an organization that was born of cops, firefighters, emts and I think maybe national guard. IDK they have power armor stands and seem to know their way around it and advanced robotics so their would have to be some military personnel. 
---
Anyways I would also like Raider armor needs an endgame version that has colors inspired by the surviving raider faction that the robot on the top of the world runs. Leather armor should have something better than shadowed to increase it's sneak appeal, metal should have a small chance to deflect or return energy projectiles, wood should have 3* version but also automatically count as weightless, trapper should inflict damage to melee attacks, and robot should do something cool like make all robots non aggro until you fire first or give you the option to have a eyebot pet. 
---
I just want more from the armor in this game so more people would distance themselves from PA.
---
Maybe PA is on par with average legendary armor, protocols are a hell of a drug. But if you have a god set, or even just a good set, of legendary armor and you don't use heavy guns, it's almost never beneficial to use PA. Like at all ever, short of blast zones. With backpacks, PA doesn't even have the carry weight advantage in some situations.
---
Daaaaaaaaayum son.... honestly...wtf runs through their mind? I mean, you'd think it's just common sense, but some people are just scumbags in game and in real life.
---
Nuclear winter is natural thing, when you send so much nukes, so don't blame me, blame america!
---
Seriously, did I already post about this? I guess that is a possibility, but my guess is good minds just think alike.
---
How do you leave a note ? I have to try this hahaha
---
Bullet Shield is terrible. First it's strictly inferior to Barbarian. Then if you're playing PA heavy weapons (for Stabilized), your DR will be so high than an extra 20 DR will reduce the damage taken by less than 1.5%. You'll almost certainly take less damage by using the +5% points on the heavy gunner perks. Blocker is worth considering though, depending on playstyle.
---
Bear Arms is fine if you're not minimaxing. You can always go halfway on the heavy gunner perks as a compromise. Try 5-7 points and see whether you'd rather have more damage or carry more junk.
---
What about the mr. and mrs. Handy in a loop? That had me for a solid 15 min. Lol. of course not
---
PSA Unarmed weapons like a deathclaw gauntlet don't count toward the challenge of killing a human like creature.
---
I usually make sure one alt has 20-25k and then the other has anywhere from 5-15. I usually spend big on an item when my main character has 20-25k 😎
---
Grahm is the only place I’ve found them!
---
Apparently Watoga was planned to be a PVP battle ground. I've heard this talk from a few people I've played with.   
---
   
---
Just imagine how cool that would be. Watoga as a PVP wilderness. Two vendors, lots of places to hide plus trying to keep the robots off your back.
---
He is dead, like when you find dead brahmin with dead traveling merchants around her. This is just bug, when one of traveling merchants get model of deathclaw instead of human.
---
Ok
---
Are the hats required?
---
It’s AA
---
Don't know if it's always been that way, but it's my understanding if you pick something up, it will carry over to any server you join. It will remain gone from anywhere between 20hrs to 72 hrs. 
---
 And if someone else already grabbed it on that server, you won't see it until it respawns.
---
So if your'e looking for something specific and all you see is a different plan. Leave it be, don't pick it up and then server hop. Each time you hop has chance to refresh that plan into something else in it's pool. But again, this also assumes nobody else grabs it on that new server, spot could be empty on that new server. 
---
So basically don't pick up unless it's what you want, else you'll have to wait up to 72hrs.
---
I don't know. Already 2 guns use that caliber.
---
It and marine need lots of love and buffs. They are suppose be the most advance armor before the war yet they shit.
---
Hey man just because you, or anyone else for that matter, want to play PVE doesn’t make you a wuss. I dipped my toes in pvp and it wasn’t that great unless you had god roll armor and weapons and now even more so. So I stick to adventure and it’s a blast. I don’t know anything about you and I generally hate trolls but I agree 100% that dude went WAY too far! Either way if your on xbox  you can play with me and my buddy’s 🤷‍♂️
---
Gives a +10 accuracy to revolvers
---
no you have to get this in survival mode
---
lol i know right
---
The cap mines.
---
Plasma nade plans drop rarely from... it was either Ash Heap or Toxic Valley events. Idk, one of those biomes no one ever visits late game.
---
no problem glad i could help the community
---
no problem glad i could help
---
W
---
yes sir its a good weapon no doubt.
---
i show it in the video,i dont recall what it is offhand but its really good though.
---
lol good weapon and a fun challenge imo.
---
Imagine a weapon with instigating anti armor bloodied executioner's explosive... how good that would be
---
It could be argued it's the complete opposite. Capitalism = America. If we have 15+ Speed Demon Serums for sale, sounds like we're on the right track to rebuilding America!
---
yeah me too its always a good time in the wasteland when you bag a new weapon.
---
i got you, dont know why it would get down voted by people are like that.
---
I would just like 2 or 3 presets, one for farming/repair/crafting and the other 2 for fight (PA and none PA).
---
PA has a jet pack, flight similar like that can only be achieved by being highly mutated.
---
Yeah that was definitely sad.
---
On another note.. I love finding the weird little messages spelled out in the alphabet blocks sometimes. Like there was one place in Fo4 that was at the top of a cliff beside a building, with some skeletons below, and the blocks said "DO IT".. it was a suicide jump.. pretty dark, heh!
---
Why can't we just get them of deathclaws we already take their hands!
---
Same.  Good natured ribbing is one thing, coming after relatives in the real world, that's another.
---
Hell, even my buddies in my old WoT clan would BS with each other, but it was in good fun and we always respected boundaries.  Christ, it's just a video game.
---
You just drop something from your notes like any other item. I believe I obtained that one somewhere in the ash region
---
just drop it like you would anything else.
---
Hear hear!    
---
Upvoted.
---
Sure, but can you *use* it in adventure?
---
Yeah some people just dont know when to stop.
---
Oh, didn't realize that.
---
 I got one but it's like it's only good effect is weightless. And who cares about that when it's not even junkies.
---
craft a lvl 15, shot that thing a few times and repair it, you dont have to wait until it is completely broke to repair it.
---
You sir are awesome. I think Gold and silver givers are the best among us.
---
I got the same email last week.
---
Yes!!  The bumper sword was cool, and what was that small rifle..the rat slayer or something? I always liked that too.
---
 Of course making shot gun shells from coins was awesome as well
---
They drop in the wild. I found shielded raider under armor at a raider camp in the divide on a shelf. My atom shop tatical suit dropped in the wild as well as casual under armor shielding or something like that. 
---
I got them through events as well. I explore pretty heavily and will sometimes spend 30 minutes to 45 minutes in one location going through everything. My fiance does not like watching me play anymore. Lol!
---
I want a LMG that shoots cannon balls kappa
---
Seriously ? There are some fucked up individuals out there 😤
---
December Child
---
Survival is "survival" not some fucking Call of duty, get out!
---
Yeah
---
I like its skin
---
I think Bethesda said something about potentially doing this d I am the track but I haven't seen it mentioned in a while
---
Giving them away would be communism haha
---
"thank you for choosing BOT STOP!"
---
1400 is one day pool of vendors, but if you are under level 30, i get you stuggle to get some caps.
---
Pretty sure it's completely useless then, armor piercing effects do nothing for energy weapons unless the ultracite gatling laser is for whatever reason an exception
---
In all seriousness do they act as gas masks though?
---
It's my understanding the sale notice show's what remains, not what is sold. So the caps received is deceiving. Check your vending machine or stash and make sure you actually sold the items referenced. 
---
Like if you had 2k bullets. Someone buys 100. Notice says 1900 and you get 90 caps. Which is accurate.
---
Bulk your scrap using plastic.
---
Don’t really understand people in the comments that say they never had above 1k caps unless they don’t have time to play. Just sell stuff to vendors daily and you’ll get max caps fast.
---
Damn can't wait to get a firkin' bloodied power attack damage deathclaw gauntlet for just cooking some meat!
---
My CAMP is right by Site Alpha. I feel like most post won’t nuke silo for some reason. My theory is backed on skooma. Who knows!
---
I kind of agree with you but you could have phrased it a tad bit less aggressively...
---
They are rewarding game companies for lazy incomplete game design and pure lies... 
---
That kind of thing shouldn't be rewarded with money, it should be discouraged so that they have to give us a good complete game with no lies, that should be rewarded, stuff like Fallouts 1, 2, 3, NV and 4 don't lie, are complete games and are probably the most entertaining games i've ever played in my entire life! That should be rewarded with our money, not glitchy buggy B-Team huge games with little to no content (to me at least) but most of all! The lies! The lies man! that's what pisses me off about this game...!
---
So many lies ranging from Bags to Rum to Detail... 
---
And it's also why I'm a bit hesitant to buy TES VI and DOOM Eternal...
---
Although I'm pretty sure DOOM Eternal ought to be fine...  Right? Yeah it's doom... They wouldn't fuck up doom... Right? Please tell me I'm right...
---
There's definitely a bug for ammo purchases.
---
Same thing happened to me. Now it seems to be working again. But I have had every problem I see mentioned in this post. So I agree it's broken. My brother commented that they took the Fallout 4 build system that worked and broke it for 76. That way it works like the rest of the game.
---
What I meant by wrong was like... I dunno, Path to Exile, where it's very easy to build a character that just sucks and you can't really come back from that. In this game you can take weak perks, but it's not nearly as easy to create a true hot mess. Sure, after 50 you're gonna swap stuff around, but in the meantime it won't be like your character just doesn't work. :P
---
It’s a visual bug when they buy something they already have, let’s say ammo, it will show you they bought all the ammo on their inventory. When the actual amount the bought and you got caps for. So for example they buy 100 5mm rounds for 1 cap each. You will see 90 caps pop up and go into your cap pool. If they already have 900 on them. It will display that they bought 1000. Their previous 900 plus the 100 they just bought. This is the same for junk, aid, anything they already have.
---
Cool! Thx!
---
4 each of corn, tato, and mutfruit. 6 carrots. 8-12 pure water production, and easy access for dirty water to boil and make soup.
---
Make adhesive from the first 3. It'll keep you well stocked and maybe allow you to sell some. If someone destroys a plant you just get a little less adhesive and a couple of tato juice instead. 
---
The 6 carrots will make 15-18 soup with green thumb and super duper. That's enough to keep you fed and hydrated as a speed demon  for at least a couple hours. By the time you need more they regrow.
---
Before launch I thought I understood why they wrnt with no NPCs. But having played the game since day one I think it was a mistake. There is no difference between an immovable robot NPC and an immovable human NPC and although the lore gives reasons why most humans were wiped out, some straggled survivors still fit the story and would have made for a richer experience I think.  
---
I kind of hope that FO76 remains the "online" Fallout platform for a while and that over time more factions, some of the non-robots, get added to the world as it's story progresses.
---
Now that I'm getting the proper mods and such on my guns my AP costs are way lower, meaning maybe I could take Better Criticals. I'm currently saving levels to take the auto rifle perks so I can be a little more useful in SBQ situations. I feel terrible using a lever-action there.
---
Manage your junk properly. When I play for 6 or so hours, I find I usually accumulate enough "bulk" junk to get about 800 or so caps. Then I just burn weapons that I've got all the useful mods for
---
Yeah I know the pain. Got that setting now as well. I have manage to get from purveyour 3* explosive handmade. All neccesery mods with silnecer. Change for auromatic perks on Prrception and to be honest it deals some decent damage. We could really use perks loadouts so changing them could be swift in the fight.
---
Here's a simpler question.  Why did you start a brand new thread for this when there's already been at least three of them today alone.
---
Well they are still around.
---
Good news it was fast... bad news they forgot I was scheduled to be knocked out and started with laughing gas and Novocain.... and I realized about the time they started on the wisdom teeth I was in for a bad day...
---
I’m using both an 800mg and a “booster” med that makes it so my metabolism doesn’t burn it in seconds... it’s working but the worst part is that moment when it’s burning out and you got an hour still before the next dosage.
---
Complete bullshit. Go back to your facebook groups.
---
Only because if they removed them a lot of people would bitch especially those who paid real cash for them
---
That isn’t fixing the ones that are currently in the game at the moment. That’s just a preventative from people obtaining them again
---
If they refuse to carry out the order they can (and, according to US law) be removed and replaced.  If your "failsafes" consist of the military breaking the law you're fucked.
---
1080Ti doesn’t run a consistent 4K60 on this game unfortunately, maybe the 2080 does but I don’t have one to know for sure
---
I just hear the same 4 songs it seems like! I just turn off all radio and listen to the in game music now.
---
Haven’t seen it drop anywhere
---
Vendor is your best bet...
---
If you sent them your information that means you have some form of contact information, or at the very least should be able to find the email or number for their support.  So should you...
---
A. Use that information to directly contact someone at Bethesda and at the least maybe get a form letter acknowledging the current status.
---
B. Go whine about it on Reddit.
---
So be highly mutated then? The drawback is negligible at base, and nearly nonexistent with class freak.
---
Jet pack can do some cool things in combination with Marsupial/Birdbones and Strange in Numbers, but in practice Marsupial is almost always enough to get you where you need to go without bothering with a jetpack.
---
Sometimes yeah. Sometimes I’ll use the work bench window glitch to get into peoples houses then play their musical instruments until they come let me out.
---
I tried looking u up. Didnt find anyone named that? Look for mine. Getmyshotgunson
---
So you guys cryied out comeback of  semi rare paintjob which only old players have and now you complayin it is expensive, when it have same price as it has? Comeon i did 14k atoms just by playing, stop comparing atoms to $.
---
If you pay $ to support bethesda, you will get atoms, if you play you will get atoms. You can't compare $ to atoms in any fking vaulue, because it is two different things.
---
I do stuff like this all the time. Specially if I just wasted 15 caps to fast travel to a camp with 15 non legendary weapons!
---
I agree with everything except changing the armor back, i like the armor better now. Camps being indestructible is ridiculous for a mode called survival. Butni still have a lot of fun i  survical mode overall. Pve does get a little dry after time
---
Death is the preferably alternative to communism.
---
It's an item you just drop.
---
 Well I have seen on her people selling them sometimes so I thought I would ask around.
---
Petrov made the right call, it's not at all clear he broke any orders -- he did his job.
---
&gt; General Yury Votintsev, then commander of the Soviet Air Defense's Missile Defense Units, who was the first to hear Petrov's report of the incident (and the first to reveal it to the public in the 1990s), states that Petrov's "correct actions" were "duly noted".
---
To add to this, definitely get some ranks of hard bargain if you’re already past 50.
---
It could be actualy pain to model, because of clipping. Making new models on this engine, or even recolor take some time.
---
I've killed a few people by blowing up the bus while they walk by lol
---
There's also some mines in the way back that go off too
---
The mysterious veil acts as a gas mask too.
---
I like the detail that this was included in the launch briefing -- it told the missileers to make sure no digits other than zero were entered into the PAL.
---
This would be great. I would love to have the service rifle again.
---
If there was that level up daily changed for "0/1 level up". I would say it was best day in last 3months.
---
Is blackbird in there at the moment?
---
Guys he is looks for plans to make the stuff not mods and not the PA itself.
---
Unfortunately he was killed awhile back :( 
---
Now that vending is here, it’s hard to keep animals alive since players spawn in enemies more frequently.
---
Nerfed 1 month ago fyi... prolly cus you posted this  ;p
---
Agreed my favorite thing to do is build and it’s a bitch probably from foundations don’t need to touch ground so if they aren’t things don’t work
---
Maybe smth is wrong in your camp like rediculously high prices or players teleport inside yourcamp, but the doors are locked and no other way to get out, that's what grinds my gears the most.
---
To me, yes. Non stop whiskey for my alt as my man doesn't yet have any of them, and plenty of adrehesive for both. When I have a lot, I sell it 1c. When I have less I sell for 2c. I'm never out, although it's not super difficult to get from junk either.
---
I also like to have a bare minium of few melon teas, as it does slow healing.
---
I have the crops spread out in groups. Like 2-3 units of several crops in one place. And then like 5-7 places for crops. I don't have enough of flat ground to have 2-3 of each in a group. I usually just lose few of them and can repair it easy.
---
&gt;And also have to deal with people just taking the food?
---
Like option one. You don't have any crops because you don't have any. Option two, you don't have any because some player collected them just prior. You got nothing to lose in having crops. Because the third option is you have, because you have and no one has collected them in 5-10 mins.

I don’t care for the explosive effect. The point of the post is it’s not shooting lasers.
---
Petty as it may be I was a bit miffed when I saw the Blackbird paints for sale yesterday.
---
Upgrade Hard Bargain all the way. (3 stars) grape mentats and a beer will usually get me 5 caps per purified water. I sell about 150+ purified waters and whatever chems and grenades I don't use daily. Usually nets more than I need so I just stash what's left for later.
---
New quest lines, new events, player vending, survival mode. There’s so much that’s been added. Lots of bug fixes and quality of life things.
---
If u have ok weapons &amp; rights perks in use its about 3s to kill 1 if they are in range for a gun . Should not be a big issue imo
---
Grow some!
---
Is this for the first part of the quest?
---
The tax is 10% but it always rounds up. 
---
So if you selling something for one cap, the tax would be 0,1 cap,  but it rounds to 1.
---
So you get 0 caps.
---
I've heard about all the songs for 76 just that one specific song was in the beta and now it isn't and it's killing me cause my uncle heard it 3 times and I never heard it yet lol
---
If you mean that tadpole challenge, yeah. I still don’t have it done.
---
I blow his ass away anyway. Can always use the scrap.
---
Players duping weapons has nothing to do with it now shooting lasers
---
Can’t argue with that aha
---
Awesome! 
---
I also need mine done and am on Xbox as well. I can hop on in about 15 mins if you are good for that?
---
What are you talking about? It all depends on the context tea or coffee is said. Maybe its a question. Tea or coffee?  Maybe they're saying, I dont know what I have, either tea or coffee. But in what context does it make sense for someone to say tea or coffee and then just walk away?
---

On occasion when I alt tab to the desktop then re-enter the game window it will lock at 30 and the only way to fix it is to restart the game.

Sure, just hit me up when you’re on.

My bad, I would have sworn I got them the first time I did Heart of the Swamp, but it might just had been a coincidence. I like that swamp event but unlike most events I've never got any other player to help and that takes a bunch of explosive ammo, so I usually ignore it. I'm probably just wrong and It only drops from Death Blossoms.
---
Guess I'll start farming the plan for the diffuser to make use of those free stamen.
---
Do it!  -  The Emperor
---
Honestly if it was launched with what it has now people would have liked it a lot more.
---
Survival mode is pvp so if that's your thing than it makes it waaaaaaaay better.
---
I’d love human NPC, rumours have it that the wastelanders DLC will bring it 🤔
---
If I visit someone's camp, and they have locked buildings that I can marsupial my way in, or if their shop inventory is pitiful(who sells non-legendary common weapons?!?) I always leave a propaganda flyer.
---
It doesn’t make sense why they didn’t include it, considering pipe shotguns are the most common zipgun
---
Grab all + tank killer !
---
Expose them.  No mercy.
---
Actually scratch this, I just noticed I don’t have aqua girl
---
What do you need aquagirl for?
---
Every time someone on our team has asked where a body went each person has reported a different position.
---
Most multiplayer games avoid syncing ragdolls since it's a lot more complex both in terms of bandwidth/server performance and getting it to work right with varying latencies.
---
Those that do, do for very clear gameplay mechanics - mostly for reviving in team based games, though many games with revives don't do ragdolls on a revivable player, they just animate to a downed position (and non network ragdoll sync on fully dead).
---
And those that do try to sync ragdolls it's more obvious because it looks different from traditional ragdolls - they kind of only run synced physics on a chest position, then the rest of the body flops around that.
---
How many atoms?
---
Level 186 and I still don't have the perk cards I want and still have no idea what some builds are like.  
---
But I can tell you that 15 str is a must for quality of gameplay (nobody like being overencumbered and dealing 0 melee dmg).  
---
And to be able to use certain weapons like shotguns and heavy weapons (esp energy) most effectively, many perk cards can be required.  For example, using stabilized, batteries included, demo expert, and power user to get best use out of an explosive laser gatling costs FOURTEEN int.  
---
Your build will have to suit your playstyle obviously.  But understand that most builds require major sacrifice, either in damage output, tankiness, VATS usage, or convenience.  
---
I prefer str, int, agi, and luck, with every special at least at 4.  I would sacrifice INT for more Agility or Luck if i didn't have god-teir heavy weapons to use.  Or for Per for a rifle build.
---
Google translator didn't help me to understand what you wrote.
---
1800 same as old dayzs
---
Thank you 👌
---
To not die in water since it’s irradiated. If you go down in water the rad tick kills you.
---
And add the homemade shotgun!
---
That seems pretty dumb that you can’t get the challenge done without a perk card. I assume there is another way to do it
---
Agreed! Give the Enclave some love!!!
---
Upvote from me!
---
I have 5 corn, 5 tato, 5 razorgrain, 5 mutfruit and 5 melon.
---
Tatos and corns mostly cosmetics, aswell the mutfruit. I have a cow for that too.
---
The grain, when I have time, Pi turn them to soups.
---
And the melon, uncooked, it gives the same amount food and water as any of the soups. So, as a speed demon, I just rip them an consume them.
---
IDK, might get it. I was a beta player and missed it but now it doesn't really mean beta player anymore. Still looks sleek though
---
Vault dweller struggles.
---
Waaaay too much for one skin.
---
I got all the camo stuff for like 800 combined.
---
I wanted the skin so bad but it is a bit much for it.
---
It is just black power amor now, Plague, or any other horsemen skin is better.
---
I’ll cough up a serum for a few hundred caps. You can’t collect weapons, bottles, and other crap to get a few hundred caps?
---
I got 14k atoms in 600hours, so 2k is not so much, but i am glad they reduced prices by little.
---
This one paintjob should stay at it's price, because it was icon for veteran players.
---
#PRIORITY RESPONDER MESSAGE
---
Oh man that's a big question. Lots of stuff. (ignore my misspellings as I can't remember exactly how each is written)
---
We can recycle legendaries and get "scrip" and use it to buy random, but slightly/somewhat better legendaries than normal loot.
---
We got Arktos Pharma event with decent legendaries to fight. Decent challenge too. Not just go to place X and fight boss monster there. But not too complicated too.
---
We got encryptic event that spawns super tanky 3 star bot to fight. It's fairly easy to do it, but sadly a lot of players don't seen to know how to do it properly, and it's so old event now they clearly aren't learning. And without doing it properly, you practically fail it always.
---
Then we got the sewer event, I don't think that's really big or fancy.
---
I wouldn't really count camera and the assosiated challenges. It's mostly hunting for petty atoms IMO.
---
We can build vending machines on your camp and sell nearly anything we have to other randomly visiting players.
---
Then finally Scouts. It's more about visiting places and doing small things. Lots of small things. Like really lots. But the reward backpack is kinda neat and worth it.
---
Oh and Bliv and it's daily things. Not seen players be super excited about it, but it's something.
---
Actually there's like 2-3 quest(lines) too but well, it was a big question. Some of them are one time but I was thinking mostly about the repeatable ones. Since after a while that's what you are going to be doing.
---
Thanks for the ammo and company. Admittedly the whole Angler thing didn't work out, but it looked amazing through a scope. Ended up having to take cover in bunker. :D
---
Thank you. :)
---
If you’re in PA you really need to have stabilized perk. Second of all, those endurance perks are not worth the point, invest in fireproof rank 3 instead, or even lifegiver. Last of all, ditch vats as AP costs for heavy weapons are insanely high and drain a massive amount of fusion core charge
---
So to you, it was ok to KNOWINGLY take a mules junk? Possibly his whole inventory more than likely, aka a JUNK MULE!? That’s a dick move bottom line.
---
It's a great gun @ the SBQ event with a prime receiver on it.
---
They were upset Blackbird was for sale again
---
Cool thanks!
---
Rewards scale to character level. You could technically get any PA plan, but they’re overall pretty rare. Be prepared for a load of mods/camp plans/armor/weapons/junk
---
I really do miss the ability to type to people in other games. Tonight for example Mrpickle above was nice enough to join me for a bit, but my computer is too near bedrooms to speak over mic after a certain time, so we were stuck with emotes.
---
No it's like the other guy said. The game displays how much the player who brought it, has after the purchase.
---
It's kinda odd to display that, but that's what it currently shows.
---
Ya next time somewhere more reasonable for a couple of 20s.. I tp to you and its in the mire?? Lol the hell. Mic is wank as my dog decided to chew up the cord. But hit me up tomorrow well run the ash and hopefully the imposter. I play medic i play medic at that thing.
---
Thanks for helping me understand. 
---
To be honest, I am too kinda sad, every new player can buy it now.
---
Petty as in 'caring too much about small and unimportant things'.
---
Miffed as in 'peeved'.
---
What I meant is that I shouldn't have cared; in fact I should have been the better man and be happy for the people that have been asking for these to come back but I wasn't.
---
I felt disappointed instead.
---
Disappointed both in the devs for actually bringing them back and in myself for falling for the 'limited time only' fallacy.
---
But again a fool and his money are easily parted.
---
B. You should bring to light the mistakes the company has made.
---
For a "Triple A" gaming company getting the bags made how they were supposed ti and shipped wouldn't be a problem. Bethesda are just seeing how many corners they can cut on the bag.
---
Upvoted the post but downvoted this. It should be more hilarious. Imagine if you could hit the top view of this sub for a while.
---
I’ll sell it to you for 1999 caps
---
Lol that backfired...
---
I don't see that as a problem, just a creative solution to the challenge
---
Oh damn that is an incredible shot! It's like an official loading screen pic, I love it
---
I was around when it came up I just missed out on buying it.
---
They should have the skins saved for players who accessed the shop while they were on. That way it doesn’t look like they pressured people into buying it..
---
Yup. We all got mugged off. It's our own fault to be fair, trusting a company that rereleases Skyrim rather than work on games to be released.
---
Needless to say I wont be buying another Bethesda title at launch. I'll wait a month and the price will drop twice as Bethesda wont release a functional game at launch.
---
I kind of want this, since it'd be horrifying
---
Yeah its separate, obtainable from the purveyor with legendary effects since the latest patch. Also the standard and primed UCG shoots both green lasers, and UCG stronger than the regular gatling laser, i think the regular has about 20% less dps on long term, compared to the .50cal. So the UCG gatling laser deal about 25% more damage compared to the regular GL.
---
 Honestly dude, and this is coming from a raider, don't wait. This individual has your irl information and has already attacked a member of your family. 
---
Something like this is way, WAY over the line. I report for racist diatribes in game, but this is a clear definable risk to you and your loved ones well being. Its literally no skin off your ass, and as you've pointed out this individual has a history and its already under legal order to behave. 
---
I don't care if that this is likely a kid like you mentioned. I've been in legal trouble as a kid myself and turning a blind eye does nothing.
---
TL:DR call his probation officer and nip this in the bud ASAP.
---
I can buy that i guess. At this point I've never tested, so can't be 100% sure either way. All i know is i definitely get caps and do believe it's a visual bug.
---
Funny thing is... the other guy you state is right is also being downvoted like myself... Guess it doesn't matter if you're right, if people don't like what they hear.
---
Funnily enough, people do tend to pvp in the towers, but not the Watoga ones because it costs so much to fast travel way down there.
---
 If you go to a survival server, there is a high chance you will find people at the top of the Hornright Industrial Headquarters in Charleston.
---
Well I sell mine for 35 max
---
Isn’t that the amount of adhesive that you have in your inventory? What have you been up to bud ?
---
You have a source for 2? Has someone done a dps chart?
---
Keep in mind the DR calc. Damage x RPM is not at all reflective of any real DPS (not to mention the stats in-game are wildly inaccurate as far as rpm goes).
---
The only reason they've become slightly more usable recently is because they _loweres_ the RPM and _raised_ per shot damage: that's what's allowing us to scratch high level (read: more armored) targets with the Minigun. Stabilized is actually kind of moot if you can find AA or even just boring explosive....
---
Lol I see your a man of culture and sophistication.
---
ive made some adjustments to the build setup, since VATS for power armor AND big guns is a bad idea due to AP and Fusion core drain i removed vats perks in favor for more useful stuff. friendly fire for if you have a flamer and want to heal allies effectively while not using your own stimpaks. bear arms because using only 1-2 guns is boring IMO. and added mutations.

---
Im assuming most people who got it bought from the vendor 
---
Cost me like 1750 maybe add some hard bargain on
---
It's a really popular Nuke spot as well as the scorchbeast queen usually what I do if I'm good on stable flux I just grab all the raw flux I can as well as the high radiation fluids and mass, put the hard bargain perk on and take some grape mentats and sell it all and make some good caps off of it
---
Maybe
---
I was just popping in for the Scout quest. I didn't plan on finding all the anglers in the worldmap in one location, took me by surprise. :P
---
I don’t think so
---
You've inspired me to get my own pet.
---
Yep, absolutly how i feel about this. I would just add, i am sad that comunity cried this out, instead of aceppting fact, that this one skin is for "veteran players".
---
That's... a very cynical and yet thought provoking answer.
---
Did you click into the machines? I just did all that too and found out my machines emptied themselves
---
Ah thank you, I didn’t even think about doing this. Very helpful :)
---
No he is wrong. It’s still a little buggy about triggering but it’s the same for everyone. You can only do one activity a day for 3 tokens. No questions asked. But it is SEMI easy to buy the items. I think I paid 5k for the full mr. fuzzy suit but I still try to get my 3 tokens anyways.
---
That's what I thought, but the numbers are way to large for it to be anything I have on me currently or ever have had.
---
That is not a bug, it's a feature.
---
Your camp might need repairing.
---
It should have different servers for different levels so a server for level 100+ and a server for level 0 to 20
---
Only if the Enclave get theirs from a previous generation Sgt Dornan, in person having been sent by vertibird and extra grumpy, and the Responders get Preston's great-great grandpappy. But yeah, in actual fact, there is no reason that Maxson can't relay orders direct once he realises his refusal to let certain measures be used puts certain events entirely on him and he needs to personally direct the fix-its going forwards.
---
Not one single person is going to spend 45,000 caps on that outfit
---
But like.. also why?
---
My machines have emptied themselves three times in the last week
---
No items in a machine removes you as a vendor location
---
Gotta admit those skins look good though!
---
For a Triple-A title, they've barely added anything.  If you add everything they've added since launch together, you'd have less than one Fallout 4 DLC.
---
Sorry, you repaired it. Missed over the bit. No idea. Sorry again.
---
Bring to light?  You SERIOUSLY think that the fucking bags are still Bethesdas deep dark secret?  Youtubers are STILL churning out new rants about the fucking things.
---
I don't know if they changed it, but my teammates dropped them in a bag and I picked them up and it counted. They probably changed it.
---
Strange, how unfulfilled promises keep arranging new videos...
---
super low level employee is much better.
---
Oops I was not aware that turning off light and spreading fertilizer on the bed was destructive.
---
true. its not fun, but ppl dont get the RPG part here....
---
I didn't say you where but in general
---
Strange, how turning to youtube and reddit for the usual canvas bag circle jerk doesn't actually get anyone anywhere.
---
No... wait that isn't strange, it's exactly what you'd expect.
---
so theres nothing I can do? its been like three hours
---
Oh my god...you guys were right. How the hell did it empty it's fucking self? This is actually shit. Wow
---
..
---
A+ Bethesda
---
You were right.
---
"As you all know I became a bounty hunter"
---
No dude. Just no.  Your whole post just gives off this 'guyz I'm so popular in fallout76' vibe. Urban dictionary?  Grats bro 10 people recognized your name. Literally never heard of you or anyone. Nobody is popular in this game get over yourself.
---
Big combat armor wants to see it buried.
---
This has happened a couple times but not by that much for me. Thankgod. As soon as someone buys something expensive like that and it takes me anywhere over 20 I back out of the server to be safe.
---
Without leaderboards as they are now, survival mode would be even more useless/boring/pointless, because you won't be running to each other. Even now, only time you get action is when you hit the top 3. All other time, you see no one on the road. Leaderboards are only reason right now to jump into survival mode, but even then, 90% of time you play in adventure mode, because everything there is faster and the challenge rewards from Survival mode just aren't worth.
---
i dont know - t'was a joke referring to the game's frequent unpredictability and janky user experience.  Its not normal for that to happen, but almost everything else is in this game.
---
Its an acquired taste and I hope you can eventually experience it.
---
3 times in a week?!?!!! Oh i hope they fix this soon thats just crazy!
---
Ok then, why aren't youtubers and reddit circle jerking over other games? The reason they keep going for Anthem and Fallout 76 is because they released an unfinished game with extremely expensive cosmetics, (around £16 for blue power armor...), fraudulently sold a bag that was not as advertised, same with the rum. And people still eat up the bullshit here.
---
These videos are warranted, as these companies keep screwing up. If they released a good game, there wouldn't be so many videos pointing out the constant flaws in the game.
---
But sure, its circle jerking.
---
1) Level restricted items in a multiplayer adventure game with a cap at 50 is slightly silly and double silly paired with level restricted perks. Some real factors that would have a true impact on level 5 handmades would be resource constraints. It's difficult to find 5.56 and even more difficult to try to carry the mats to make it back to the tinker bench. 5mm is only slightly easier. To top it all off, you'd be missing Tank Killer, Stabilized, Bear Arms, etc, etc.
---
Let then eat cake (I mean, have miniguns) for the 7 seconds they can use them ineffectively while providing a way to learn about the perks for their final build.
---
2) But does a laser Gatling have recoil? Plasma? Surely if an eyebot can infinitely float on nuclear magic there is some explanation as to why a laser gun should not "tear your arm off" and a handmade (literally handmade - one model is missing entire pieces of the receiver) rifle has laser accuracy and no recoil.
---
High fire rate in Fallout 76 literally translates _to lower damage_. It's built in to the mechanics. For the same reason a Minigun should "tear your arm off" it should probably include some inherent anti-armor or some form of bonus damage. Speaking of busted mechanics - ever try to cripple with a Minigun? Strangely a shotgun works wonders with fewer projectiles per second but something that's supposed to shred limbs away _from the operator_ doesn't. If it's believable to theory craft the reasons you can't physically fire one then where's the theory craft that I can survive 100 x .50 high powered rounds from a high fire rate but die of 2 x .50 at a low fire rate (hunting rifle)..... or even a fire axe.... :\
---
I would be perfectly happy if there was a real mobility trade off. Root me in place while firing with an invisible bipod for another 10% damage buff, please.
---
Just from the thumbnail of the video it sums up a fair few video games that have released in the past few years.
---
YongYea literally just made a video about this and it was so stupid cause at no point did he make any attempt to contact Bethesda to ask for an update. But some people in this thread already said they got updates that they are shipping soon.
---
THE MOST annoying thing anyone can do!!! No one wants the bullshit assault rifle you get off a random super mutant!!!!!
---
2\^32 - 2. What you get when you subtract 2 from 0 in 32-bit unsigned arithmetic. Component view is supposed to show you the total of each junk component you have, including what you'd get from scrapping everything under junk. Without knowing what junk you're carrying, I couldn't guess why it's not working correctly.
---
I think the problem is that there are 2 groups of people in survival mode. One group is treating it exactly how you said, it's a deathmath race to fill your inventory with junk and aid.
---
But the other group on survival are just people attracted in by the 20% xp bonus and have zero interest in pvp at all, which is completely unfair to the guy trying to get to the top of the survival leader board and has to kill a lv23 character that's number 1 to take his survival points.
---
I play survival to hit the #1 spot and hold it as long as possible. If the number 1 guy is already at 10k survival score on a low level character, I really don't want to kill him because there is no challenge but there is no other way to pass his score. Survival should not have any xp bonus because it attracts non-pvp lowbies to get murdered whenever they get to the top 3.
---
Yeah he done that like twenty times already and probably jerking off on the 900 hours guy fiasco again for views. I didn't click the link since don't wanna give him or other so called youtube critics any money
---
Honestly he just kinda keeps bringing up the same point, but he’s right.
---
Todd Howard hyped up this game, made it seem super interesting, and just like every other company since the beginning of [from what I can remember] late 2017, just toss out a horribly half-assed game because they wanted to make the publishing date.
---
I thought the game was good, but with how main game breaking bugs, unbalanced features, and just absolutely stupid designs that shouldn’t have been there, it couldn’t be any further from being able to be called a decent game.
---
It was almost physically unplayable for 2-3 weeks.
---
They publicly apologized and slashed the price the first week, effectively fucking over anyone who paid for the $80 version, even though they fucked themselves because they sold the pre-order pack as SOMETHING THAT COULD BE BOUGHT BY EVERYONE, making it **NOT** a fucking pre-order bonus.
---
They try to remedy by making all future DLC and content free, yet they can’t even at least make it work properly before they release it....
---
The list goes on.
---
For sure. It's disgusting how companies think they can release a broken buggy shell of a game and promise to fix it as time goes on.
---
I really wanted fallout 76 to be good. I wanted 16 times the detail. The only reason I played as omg as I did was because my father always wanted to play a coop fallout, as did I. It's a shame as I'm worried for the future of gaming.
---
Hot.
---
TURN DOWN THE GOD DAMN MENU AND ATOM SHOP MUSIC!!!!
---
Thats fair. I guess some people like their games companies to have them by the scrotum. You do you.
---
Stabilized really is a balancing problem. If heavy guns are end game and legendary armor is end game....... You'll have to discard all of your unyielding, sentinel, etc, and backpacks, etc, for mediocre PA.
---
For the "but but but BIG GUN" crowd please couchsplain how I get stronger, faster, and smarter by wearing trousers and not PA.
---
yeah I've heard a lot about the bugginess of the game but I took a chance on it. Hope I can get to actually play it
---
Do you not understand the concept of a circle jerk?  Because I really do not want to draw a diagram.  They keep churning out these shit videos about 76 because it's a cheap and easy self sustaining system.  
---
And for FUCK sake stop with the rum already.  I don't know why it has to be explained but BETHESDA DOES NOT MAKE RUM OR BOTTLES.  The rum was a totally separate third party company that bought the naming rights and there was NO controversy, just a bunch of idiots that ordered the shit with nothing to go on but a photo and then freaked the fuck out over the material it was made of and couldn't comprehend the fact that pre orders of specialty goods get delayed all the time.
---
I got attacked by the box crowd when i pisted about their bases looking like shite but im not allowed to place a wall on a floor where i want it because of restrictions
---
Thank you for understanding the point I am trying to convey.
---
Yes, it has been said countless times, I do agree. But it needs to be said until people stop buying these types of game. If people stopped spending money on these cash grab games, companies will be forced to actually make better games again.
---
As hopeful as I can be for the new Elder Scrolls, something tells me it will be littered with microtransactions. I hope I am wrong though.
---
I leave poo bags on people's beds for the following reasons:  fast travel into their foundation or locked house, their house is locked, but I can get in through a window, or(mainly) overpriced items.  It's my endgame now.  my poo bag consists of hardened mass, random burnt comic, tp, and glowing blood.(I've got the hemorrhoids) Sometimes I leave a burnt lifestyle mag, oil, and cream instead.
---
nope to atoms, im ok with caps tho
---
It’s happened to me so many times! Encumbered or not it’s totally random for me at least. I e even had it give me no option to respawn a couple times. That’s aggravating.
---
All they gotta do is literally make a proper sequel to the elder scrolls series. they can even add the Creative thing they added to Skyrim and Fallout 4, I don’t mind that. If they add anything that Skyrim didn’t have, they’ll be in for a world of hurt from the community.
---
False, they keep churning out these videos as more problems arise. It's not circle jerking if they report as new issues arise. Like creating the problem of repairs not being as effective and selling repair kits. But hey, lets not forget that "only cosmetic atom store purchase" promise they also broke.
---
Well why did Bethesda advertise their Rum in a special glass bottle and charge a high price for low quality liquor? They should know the quality of their goods and adjust the price. But they wont, as they tried to scam tens of thousands of people with that and an inferior bag to what was advertised. That's false advertising there and fraud. 
---
If you want to draw a diagram of people masturbating each other feel free, just don't send it to me.
---
2 handed or "unarmed" (actually fist weapons like the power fist).
---
The selection and damage output of 1H weapons is mediocre. The down side of fist weapons is that you can't use them in PA. 2H does everything.
---
Incisor, Martial Artist are your staple perks. Blocker, Dodgy, and Serendipity are also great.
---
Look into Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations.
---
Well, I'm glad it came back. Being a BETA player myself and having missed out on it, I'm glad I have the opportunity to not miss it this time.
---
It goes over excavator PA, meaning every single dip, every curve is used in making a Raul skin
---
I bet you look quite dapper in that tux though.
---
New player here, ran into him the first time the other day while traveling to the top of the world... Needless to say I did not receive my "prize", but he certainly did.
---
Death Claw do not drop their hide.
---
It's a rare container pick up. I've received the most from just searching junk piles that you find at workshops, in world, etc. Don't use an extractor - just search it.
---
Other players mention green footlockers as a good source.
---
I'm hoping so. I was until 76 a big fan of Bethesda  even if it took fan patches to get the game stable. I'm hoping that ES6 is the next blockbuster game that destroys the competition. Skyrim truly is a great game, and I have only played Vanilla.
---
I bought two backpack plans for exact 15,000 caps...hope it's not you :O.
---
uhm what? i think you dont get how MMOs loot works. instead of asking that rethorical question you couldve said thank you instead. troll! i mean are u really that behind to think that i can actually "loot away" that camera? i dont know what region you play on and the possibility of me gettin on the same server and looting that camera tho it doesnt make sense to have 2 is basically 0. really wish that you never find one for being that impolite, you kid.  
---
go troll somewhere else....this is not dota, this is fallout. be snappy somewhere else
---
What does arktos mean
---
That dude probably just had sentinel armor. The top pvp guys have full sets and even after the nerf they are crazy effective!
---
i also dont see camp space as p2w, stash its a little in the gray line if you ask me but I know many will consider it as p2w. 
---
with that said if they add something like this to the atom shop  specially after the repair kits, it will start too look like we are heading to the p2w route. 
---
if they do it with caps im ok with it, unless they add caps to the atom store.
---
Workbench glitch or power armour glitch(es) are my new best friends. I swear I have more fun trying to get into people's locked camps to shit on their beds as I do doing an event.
---
Their should be a buff or an achievement linked to it, like if you  activate 10 players C.A.M.Ps you get a small sneak buff or chameleon that lasts 30 mins or whatever...
---
Also i get some from the behemoth
---
its a new event i havent done yet
---
Multiple people firing Gatling lasers and such at him later on joined in 7 other players couldn't kill him with concentrated fire. That's broken if that's the case
---
Where did you find your plasma grenade plan?
---
Nope.
---
S15 P1 E15 C4 I5 A11 L5
---
I have a fist build so no power armor, if you want powerarmor probably need a little mor in Intelligence
---
In Strength apart from your weapon perks i wold take Blocker, Incisor and Martial Artisan (I have Barbarian too because no power armor)
---
Endurance: Vaccinated, Fireproof and Radicool Ghoulish (Ironclad because no power armor)
---
Charisma: Lone Wanderer
---
Intelligence: Makeshift Warrior
---
Agility: Adrenalin (1 point because it is always good) white knight and dodgy (i have Evasive for no power armor)
---
Luck: Bloody Mess and Starched genes
---
Mutations: Talons (only for unarmed), Twisted Muscles, Groundedn and Scaly skin
---
I'm pretty frustrated about not being able to place objects under the 2x1 stairs, objects either can't be placed, or teleport up on top of the staircase platform.
---
So far the only exception I've found is the CAMP device itself...
---
Where is said camera? Or is it just photo mode and I’m dumb...
---
He really likes to drive the point home. Then walk backstage, grab a sledgehammer and drive it home a bit further.
---
Said that he does make valid points and invites some sobering introspection.
---
This is not just the 'triple A' industry's doing. We consumers did at some point willingly relegate creative and innovative gameplay to obscurity in lieu of more lavish, intricately decorated, expansive beyond boundaries, moorishly detailed... backdrops.
---
We just cannot have enough of form over substance when it comes to the entertainment we consume.
---
And investors/shareholders don't give a flying fuck about what we consume as long as we consume and keep the digits in their Dutch bank accounts rolling. In a sense they deferred to us when it came to being the judge of what 'quality' means; turns out we collectively chose... poorly.
---
I must be lucky, my mole miner gauntlet counted lol
---
Yes please, I don't want to be forced to use Power Armor to get the benefits from Stabilized, no other weapon type boosting perk card forces you into a certain armor type(not counting unarmed ofc), and the other Heavy Weapon perk cards like One Gun Army/Bear Arms/Bullet Shield/etc don't care about what armor you use.
---
It's like if for example pistol perk cards forced you to use normal armor because Power Armor has fat sausage fingers that can't pull the trigger.
---
You gotta find a broken camera on a tourist corpse and that unlocks it as craftable at the tinkerer bench
---
There is literally no way I could rebuild my camp 1 foot over. lol
---
If you mean the weapon reward from the challenges, yes you can
---
I was up there for a while, it's a great spot. But yeah I'm not sure how pets work there.
---
Idk but 75% chance of avoiding 15% times 3 is 75%. That’s nuts! And then if it’s assassins it’s 8% more damage per piece so that’s even more insane! Idk for sure of coarse but I’ve seen people eat my bloodied explosive lever, 700fps that normally melts anyone in 1 or a couple shots, and one shot me. I haven’t done survival or any pvp since the nerf on the armor though. Just a theory 🤷‍♂️
---
I have a thought/question on the same theme; does the xp bonus, but even lower likelyhood of teaming up with others and the lack of convenient fast travel, balance out? I keep swapping to Survival for the 20% xp bonus and just walking through whatever locations I find and murder everything. But it occurs to me that I won't randomly meet a level 1000 who will let me tag their enemies after an event, I'm having to walk everywhere even if I have a map-marker, and that very occasional time someone decides to murder me for existing and a chunk of asbestos, might be eating into that 20% extra XP and not be any faster at all.
---
it does already, go to your camp machine thing, and it should give you to option to repair all.
---
Seen every dc hide in green footlockers
---
Army installations are your friend
---
I mean if that's what it is that man is a good trader. He took a lot more than we laid into him and couldn't scratch him no damage at all
---
yeah it depends from your needs. For 100+ levels i had an adhesive farm. Then i didn't need it anymore (plenty adhesive from junk gathering+robot vendors+player vendors). I only need corn and razorgrain for my whisky, which i gather in ridiculous quantities with a fast travel in Silva and Billings Homestead at Forest area. Now i don't have a single plant in my camp and the space i won went to building and decorating. But yeah, it depends from your needs.
---
I decided I just do my scout dailys and campfire tales so that I can be free of all those grinding shenanigans. 5 badges so far. hoping to get a fridge mod before christmas
---
I had  like 24,856 caps and someone bought an unyielding cavaliers and only got 154 caps I sold it for almost 4K
---
Good bc i have shit loads of missile turrets
---
yeah the one in game that is free has negatives effects. they said " let it have possitive effects"  im guessing they are reffereing to the atom shop one then it will be p2w.
---
I guess he didn't make it to the next game...
---
if you need help doing anything, hit me up my game tag is the same as here.
---
Try the middle mountain cabbins. In the middle one, 2 out of 3, a broken crossbow appears on the wall opposite of the door (little to the left).
---
yeah, load up, add ppl to you team in the main menu or after you are already logged in and you go to play. 
---
I do have to say listening to Holotapes can be a bit.... sometimes while you are in a group, but it is fun either way
---
Lol. No the video is shit.
---
No. It is simple and very fast. 
---
Go to one train station. Kill everything in small radius. Sell everything you  find. Repeat this in few other train stations. Some train stations are better than others. I think in less then one hour you have your 1400 caps. 
---
It is always better if you can increase you Charisma before trading. Use beer, charisma perk cards, mentats, armor pieces.
---
It's like that from the beginning - it's said you have to 'find' them, not buy ;) Jokes aside, it's really time consuming challenge - I'm 268 lvl, 900+ hours of play and still miss challenges for at least 3 magazine kinds (Tumblers, Scouts, Tesla and Awesome...), everytime just 1 issue, but still...
---
It is stable so I'm not sure what your talking about. When you have Forbes magazines saying as much that's all the proof I need that I am correct because that guy hated the game at launch. If it's not stable for you then something is wrong with your setup.
---
Agree.  Nothing worse than coming back to your camp and some SBQ was hovering over it farting on it for 10 minutes.  No need for this in the PVE side.
---
At a very minimum give us a nice alert when our camp is taking damage so we can leave the server lol.
---
They target generators first.
---
as a person with a floating base... I would love to make an ecstatic build.
---
Yeah, the joke is on us to be fair for buying into it all. It's a strange state of affairs currently the gaming industry, what with the upcoming potential ban on loot boxes (not in fo76 I know) it will be interesting to see what direction companies decide to take.
---
Understandable, have a good day.
---
We have fall damage in this game? Thx for the heads up that's good to know! Jokes aside, with bird bones mutation, people just don't take fall damage so armors with fall damage reductions are not that highly sought after
---
If I could get it with +Are and no fall damage I would pay a small fortune for it. But that's just me.
---
Fuck man, that's on some bullshit. This is a well worded warning 2 the  unsaid asshole. Take heed yo, u went way too far...
---
Well, there's quite a many places to get stuff for caps. Many of us pull the 1400 caps daily, and with nothing else, you can always buy some recall boards.
---
yes, Raider PA plans are from Toxic Valley maps.
---
Yea Paul is annoying but it was amazing reading him admit that fallout 76 isn't the failure he thought it would be. That guy predicted that Bethesda would abandon the game and now we have them seemingly making 76 a big part of their E3. So it's great news for all of us who actually enjoy the game.
---
Survival mode should be a complete separate character and permadeath or at least  have a limited amount of lives. So when you die you start out at level 1 with nothing again. No gear, no camp, no armor.
---
Handmade weighing up to 23 pounds depending on the mods which is insane
---
I laughed at the concept of a camera when we had photo mode  but it's so freaking awesome.
---
this shot is fantastic too. it's gorgeously framed and not nightmare fuel to me ahah
---
Need a yellow spandex and you could be basically wolverine, i dig it.
---
Rare outfits, maybe a better \*\*\* armor with the stats i need, stable flux, 5,56 ammo (i need to stop, i have over 11.000 ammo now...), bufftats, building/crafting materials that i may need. I think that is. And i always want to see a new camp :)
---
That Robin guy opinion is that the game is in worst shape now than it was at launch and at E3 two of the options he had for the game was Bethesda to make it free to play or abandon it. It's a bit delusional.
---
Oh ok
---
I already met someone in survival where we had an intense fight. It was in the Cranberry Bog and I came out of the forest and saw him in the open field and fired. Sadly, he jumped at the moment I pull the trigger and missed so that he saw me. He fired and nearly killed me. Luckly I was able to go into the forest and hide for a while. I heard him passing by due to his PA but it seems he didnt check the compass so he wasnt able to find me. In fear of losing stuff, I returned to my camp, because I only had like 5 Stimpaks left.
---
For a non PA player, the ability to jump off of literally anywhere makes you a superhero.  Go to the top of the monorail near Watoga and jump, you'll die without armor regardless of mutations.
---
Zealot's (Explosive) Prime and then Executioner's (Explosive) Prime (below 40% health) work really well against SBs due to the +55% and then +88% bonus damage.
---
This was the paint I was using on my T-51b for the longest time until the Nukashine came out. But since we’ve had two power armor paints return, I’m seriously hoping for the mosaic tiles to come back too.
---
I love you.
---
True. But most people don't do that
---
a gold star for you!!!
---
 so not forest?
---
I love helping people. sadly, everytime I try to leave stuff they run away...
---
i undesrtand updates...but every week?¿ camon kids, stop protect companies, the game is good but not normal every 3 days a update. i desire the day i start the launcher and cant press play directly, without less time waiting updates. a day like that will be fine. all of us pay a lot to play this game, will be good dont stay login time all weeks. put a patch every month but no every week, or dont sell out a very bad game, like a shit. 
---
a lot of games are services and no need updates avery day, stop defend enterprises, its time to complain for our rights. I pay to play, i dont pay for updates, i pay to start the game and enjoy, y dont pay for waiting 7 gb of update. 30 years ago games are finished when you buy it, new generations conform with all...pay por all...cosmetics....boxes...pay to win....pay dlcs...pay expansions...pay all kids pay all....
---
id be so amused by this...
---
I love you so much. hahaha
---
Sounds good 👍 getting a little boored with the guns we have
---
I first thought this was an item ID number in their master list
---
I didn't get anything useful from forest maps, while already got 2 Raider PA plans from Toxic Valley maps, even though I only have 10 of them.
---
2 pieces of 'Acrobat' armor give you 100 percent fall dmg reduix.   For non PA players it's a must.  Just wondering how rare it is/ what it's worth.
---
and I thought blowing up parking lots was real end game - this is next level.
---
appropriate
---
Wherever the market forces take them.
---
They are not going to abandon very profitable practices, however predacious, unless we consumers put a zip in our wallets.
---
I am not a great fan of government intervention, call me naive but we individual consumers should be the driving force for the industry to self-regulate.
---
Yet we keep buying into mediocre, unfinished products and vague promises, making excuses for them and willingly keep financing them with recurrent spending.
---
This is us basically saying 'more please and without lubrication this time'.
---
My guess is those elements were discovered after the split in Fallout's timeline from our own. Not sure when they were discovered, but that's my thought.
---
this is pretty creative. I'd laugh...
---
You're welcome!
---
Thought everyone kept a suit of excavator PA in their inventory. About rarity, I can say they are a bit rare since people just vendor them or turn them in for scrips. But can't imagine them going for over 1000 caps unless other two legendary effects are godly
---
They should do more with it its cooler than the trapper
---
update 12:30am pacific: I'm still on the same server, and will be on for another half hour or so. If you can get here, please leave your GT so when I log out people have another anchor.
---
As for votes give it some time.
---
Its ok if he hates the game and spews vitriol about it at the drop of a hat. We know what it is and can see the potential still to come. If he chooses to diagree with us, the people who love and play this game, after all we can't force him to be right. So i say let him play in the corner with his crayons and we'll crack on rebuilding America and having a blast doing so.
---
Highest I've ever seen is 30k or so. The guy held almost every good workshop on the map, and just kept bouncing so you couldn't pop him easily. I was impressed.
---
&gt;I am not a great fan of government intervention, call me naive but we individual consumers should be the driving force for the industry to self-regulate.
---
I totally agree. But at least with the government they have to listen, they don't listen to anything we say. Hopefully that will change soon though.
---
And I also agree on the buying of unfinished products, I too fell into that category with 76, and swiftly learned my lesson.
---
NY. N

---
Yes I can confirm putting on the Responders skin removes a star from your weapon - happened to my buddy.  He submitted several tickets to Bethesda and they have basically said too bad, nothing we can do about it.  He lodge another ticket saying he paid for atoms with real money to buy the skin, and still they say they can't do anything.  It also doesn't render properly if you have a suppressor fitted - it appears bright pink. Shoddy, very shoddy.
---
every bandama works that way ;)
---
I keep myself near starving and dehydrated to buff my bloodied unyielding build, but in order to keep some AP and have it refill faster I keep corn soup on me at all times.
---
I'd like to think that they never get one! Shame on you for paying extra monies for some plastic trash and pre order.
---
Game is great tho... Got to stop paying ppl for sex you are not getting. Ya know what i mean?
---
🤦🏻‍♂️ ever have one of those moments where you realize you could have kept your mouth shut and not made yourself sound dumb?   Lol - me right now. Wow. 
---
Thank you VERY MUCH for the tip, I didn’t even realize until now. Off to loot army bases.
---
Running melee build I'm almost constantly killing glowing enemies, yao guais and sheepsquatches - all those meats giving you 10% to melee damage. Also doing myself cranberry coblers and collecting canned meat stew for 5% XP bonus each, which stacks with well rested.
---
I think like 99% of people went deathclaw hunting when they saw the challenge. I did, too.
---
It happens. :P
---
...and Whitespring music. I have music set to Off because I spotify while I play. Got to pause y music when in Whitesping, pause it when on the initial load screen and p[ause it if I want to visit the atom store. Which considering I have "music" "radio" and every other sound setting besides sound effects and footsteps set to zero, is very annoying.
---
Noticed that as well. Even weeklies this time aren't a fucking chore at all. No more stupid hunter/hunted crap at the very least :D
---
Thank you!!
---
Does a sequin dress also count?
---
Confirmed fart sniffer
---
Well if thats all you played then i guess skyrim is good. In realty is another version dumber down for consoles and fast selling. Skyrim was the worst entry in the ESO series (tho admittedly much better then fo4).
---
Truth is that games like fo4 doubled the number of fallout players so for half of the people you ask have no other reference.
---
They are both failing series that keep gaining numbers. Time to look to outworld and cyberpunk for the next take off rpg and dabble i. The looter 3 button games that our favorites have become.
---
Unless you already have the protected under armor plans learned you can't get them anymore. They were a quest reward that was messed up
---
Wait how can you leave notes in somebody's camp?
---
Yao Guai Gauntlet is in the game already, Arkthos Pharma drop the plan.
---
Anyone else thing this was super cringeworthy to read?
---
He types like hes some super insecure beta male.
---
***I will make you my personal project and not stop until you’re lying in a cell in the fetal position crying for your mommy.***
---
Better tip that fedora, edgelord.
---
im down, im try to get that new backpack skin. my GT is the same my name here. hit me up when you want.
---
And now I am f*ckin scared
---
Xbox one s here, same issue not crashing really but just either stuck on loading screen or black screen .
---
Started having these around the time the nukashine update came out, PARTICULARLY if I have my super sledge out and try to enter west tek .
---
Re-launching the game didn’t solve it , strangely enough it wasn’t all buildings , only particular ones and almost always with my weapon out :/
---
I wear one piece all the time and carry the second piece, which doesn't have a primary effect for my build, for large leaps. Serendipity is also pretty good at saving me.
---
if you want them to count you need to find them not buy them.
---
I do see your point about Skyrim being the worst in the series. As the games went on they started "holding your hand" as regards to quests and such. I did enjoy Oblivion and though I didn't play it as much, Morrowind too.
---
Yes I love it. It's canvas and also a in fact... A bag.
---
Wait is that Sanjay?
---
I feel like I should lure a protectron to him to guard his corpse.
---
Wow, this actually made me want to get the game for some reason. I was going to preorder it, but cancelled after the beta. Is it worth playing yet?
---
Dogfood and canned coffee/sunshine oil. I rarely see people selling the coffees and once someone was selling oil which ruled. But I make a ton of it. I also love berry mentats and if they are 10-12c I'll buy a few.
---
Morrowind was a Revolution cause of its world... But dumbed down from previous scale and entires.. They make these games to sell on a box that is outdated 1 month after you buy it. Promise.. Nothing will change. And its not new or new to the industry.
---
They are awesome.
---
Sadly it no longer feeds the entire server though. :(
---
I used to run it repeatedly because of that.
---
What mods are you running?
---
Cranberry relish for 10%exp, stims and rad shield... Rest is depending on need for challenges.
---
None
---
you can see how many  you have out off x amount (50/76) but i dont thing it tells you which ones you are missing.  im not sure if they have all of them but I know i have seen plans, recipies in the challenges section.
---
the fact the gas mask can't wear a helmet with it pisses me off so much, an army/combat helmet is fucking perfect with it, gives it a whole badass 'helghast' feel to it.
---
Quad instigating two shot explosive shotgun would be my fav
---
May try the campfire tales event every now and then to push it a bit.
---
Same cap/badge roulette as the dailys but it's a bit at least.
---
I like Quad Bloodied Instigating explosive FFR 250DR while reloading Harpoon ;)
---
I'm not against stabilized perk working out of PA, but if so, heavy weapons should slow your movespeed, slow your turning speed and have some hardcore recoil.
---
I suggested something like this as well. Maybe not so drastic to start literally from scratch but losing one level everytime you die and maybe the last weapon/gear you used before dying sounds punishing enough without being too disruptive.
---
Paraphrasing here: "Anything Todd says, I'm just going to believe the opposite."
---
Clean Leather Jacket: +2 charisma &amp; audio notification when near caps stashes.
---
I don't trust him, I'm 16x less likely to trust him again. Tell me lies roast me sweet chicken thighs.
---
The launch of the game and events outside of the game reeked of upper-management arrogrance; I think the shitstorm has somewhat seceded?! And the poor devs had/have to bare the brunt of that.
---
I was in awe of the shitstorn that surrounded this game since the beta and the following few months; every few days something else seemed to go horribly wrong for Bethesda, as if they had drank Lead Champagne and fell through the game world.
---
The game was launched at least 6 weeks too early. I bought it then for €30, and as it turns out I'm really enjoying it and it's the only game I've been playing since late December and I'm coming close to 600hrs now. It's certainly been scratching that Fallout itch for me.
---
I disagree with Jim that the game is shit, but pretty much everything else he said is hitting the nail on the head.
---
Wow...that would be the teaser we deserved a month ago.
---
Awesome snap!!
---
One-shot gun , that is if a scorched doesn't interrupt and shoot the super Mutant that you were about to shoot
---
Blu print it
---
Nope but I'm still patiently waiting
---
I really wanted High Voltage Hefe, Ballistic Bock, and Tick Blood Tequila from the new update to have punch.
---
But alas I'm not even sure any of them even work. :'(
---
That sound crazy for a harpoon gun
---
I got called in by a few friends to help against someone who did it to them.  They also called in some BoS guys to nuke his base in retaliation, but he ran off the server before they got done in the silo.
---
You know who the real dingus was?  The BoS initiate who targeted their nuke.  We chose to instead hit the queen but the idiot missed and HIT ONE OF THEIR CAMPS.  Luckily, it hadn't been repaired yet so there was no additional loss, but with friends like that...
---
Technically: yes
---
When you move your CAMP your old one becomes one or more blue prints you can place down at the new site.
---
But what usually happens is you can't place it down because of terrain or other bugs. This is one of the reasons why players create the low foot print CAMPs - you know, the ones with a piece of foundation and a staircase leading to a floating house.
---
They need to up the cap
---
100% I'd love to wear the combat helmet cosmetic with it.
---
Wifi warrior? Playing on console?
---
Playing on PC. Full connection. I figure this is probably just typical Bethesda
---
Uhh just use rads, no reason to do what you're doing. You're gimping yourself of well fed well hydrated and food drink buffs
---
I still don’t know who this dude is....
---
How do i blue print it
---
Went from r/wholesomememes to r/trashy to r/prorevenge real quick
---
I'd add hard lemonade and company tea for mad ap regen. And scorchbeast stake for the damage resistance.
---
Bring up the building menu and it should be button x if your on ps4
---
I remember a guy selling a Mutant slayer's handmade for 3k caps
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
I compared a B25 Prime 50 cal to a B25 Prime Auto Handmade.
---
I gave each one the best mods for damage (Prime. Heavy Barrel on the 50 and Perforating mag on the Handmade), and I set player health to 19% to benefit from the below 20% bloodied threshold.
---
I assumed Rank 3 Bloody Mess, Rank 3 Nerd Rage and rank 3 of all the gun specific damage perks (Normal/Expert/Master Gunner/Commando)
---
I assumed rank 3 Stabilized and Tank Killer, respectively as well.
---
I assumed adrenal is being used for both, but discounted Strange in Numbers for both.
---
In the end, with all that, the 50 cal fires 11ish shots per second at about 340 damage, for about 3900 raw dps. It has 45% AP.
---
The handmade fires 9ish shots per second, at 295 damage for a raw dps of about 2770. It has 61 or so AP.
---
The 50 cal starts with a roughly 30% lead in dps over the Handmade if the target has 0 DR, which gradually degrades to a rough 23% lead over the Handmade if the target has 300dr.
---
The gap in dps becomes even greater with more damage buffs (such as Adrenaline, Bobbleheads, Chems and Tenderizer), and the same is true if we switch to BE as to abuse Demolition expert.
---
Are random encounters once per character or do they loop/reset serverside? Might as well ask in here instead of making another thread. I'm missing a lot of them, when I would like to be taking screenshots, because I'm usually on my way somewhere, fighting, or fleeing for my life.
---
Nope it just you. Nice try tho? Link a youtube nextime and post in fallout and you will get the votes you wanted. GL
---
I watched the video. It is full of subjective views and I assume personal hate towards Todd.
---
He openly admits that he played only the buggy launch and never tried any of the new additions. Also Bethesda never released bugfree games the same as any company. I have never encountered any game breaking bugs so far, but have seen them on other users.
---
Also the emphasis in Todd and voice changing for every other word is not something that I like and will not make any argument better.
---
I got my moneys worth from the game 300 hours ago and if I find the game frustrating I will stop playing for a week or so. But the itch brings me back sooner or later. I don't need other npc or players to keep me entertained.
---
The guy appears salty that the business model of one company is changing and they used MMO strategy to obtain more money. For years I played many MMOs and used Skyrim and Fallout for breaks, so I know this stuff.
---
But looking on number of his videos, he is salty about everything. So his subjectivism doesn't match mine.
---
Sorry. Mixed it up with first level of the perk.
---
Might have to blu print it in sections but at least it be easy to put back together
---
I'm not seeking votes I was seeking a fix. Most dirt hills around the marsh i fall through, the concrete is normal.
---
If you you're only looking to bash on me and not be constructive take it somewhere else.
---
literally how?
---
Thanks man, it was nice playing with you!
---
Hail to the king, baby!
---
Fair response m8 and yeah a good valid point
---
I ran into a legendary glowing Mirelurk *Deep* King the other day at the X3 Quarry and he nearly wrecked me.  I stimpak'd myself and recovered from my wounds while I was looking at what loot he dropped and then he exploded and killed me for real.  I'd gone several days now without encountering the exploding enemy bug, but it sure as hell surprised me when it happened again.
---
i agree, on xbox the first few weeks prices were good and what i think fair, but as off late man ppl are going a little crazy with prices. I understand legacy items or rare ones, but i have seen wood/leather 1\* 1k+ or fusion cores at 250c, and serums at 1,5k a little crazy if you ask me.
---
... Everything about this shit lame af...
---
They added a few patches after launch because people were pretty much doing things like hopping morgantown highschool all dayy all night. Granted, only certain number of items are marked for anti hop. A lot of stuffs are still hoppable, I think.
---
I usually get around 100fps on 1440p, so I noticed right away when I saw 30 lol
---
Remote Play.  You can connect to your ps4 remotely from anywhere as long as your wifi is decent enough at both places (where your ps4 is (at home) and where you are playing from).
---
At least you can still find them. I think,and i could easily be completely wrong,that they don't spawn after lvl 250.
---
In your case i suggest to pacify,or not ,and come up to them. The tame button should pop up when you're next to them.
---
I think you cant 1 shot anymore... No matter what it brings you to 10% so you can react. Dont quote me but my lvl24 sniper with nothing special has put players in that range many times.. But never a one shot. Never been one shot either.. Comando tho feels like it.
---
Me too, 30fps gives me a headache -_-
---
Lol big combat armor 😂 along with big explosive weapons manufacturer they dominate the market
---
You can use a Vita for this, or there's a remote play app on PC you can use to the same effect. You can even use your ps4 controller on the PC one.  I THINK the app is also available for IOS, but I have no idea how that would work unless you can use your controller with it as well.
---
The real prize is the friendship he brings, and knowing someone cares.
---
And you guys shoot at him. For shame.
---
Oh, he was a 50 glowing deep king, wanst aware there was a diff
---
Its just a stronger variant of the normal Mirelurk King I believe.  They hurt real bad.
---
you and i have a different understanding what "stable mean"
---
Lol its the id number. Never used console commands?
---
I mean I love a good whitespring kaboom as much as the next guy, but getting somewhere you shouldn't be and leaving stuff in supposedly secure buildings... Its a shame we can't graffiti or otherwise none damagingly vandalise stuff...
---
You still can. Maybe reset the game.
---
No, no, no. You have to buy them. And they're nit called caps, they're Atoms. /s
---
Aha, thank you
---
If trying tight after you load into the game and you can't it's because the world hasn't fully loaded yet. Give it a minute or two and try again
---
Agreed power armour really needs some love. I can't even get inside power armour without being over encumbered. I don't care about buffing it's other stat's but at least make the power armour comparable in carry weight
---
[https://youtu.be/wRM3KGhD93w](https://youtu.be/wRM3KGhD93w)
---
Wow, then Bethesda did a great job fooling you. 
---
Ignoring the small (but welcome) lore additions, all they did was:
---
* Block off most of the exterior and interior door ways so you only have a single path through to the Firebreather's terminal.
---
* Added the couple of new rooms at the basement level
---
* Added the security lock to the upper floor which forced you down to the new basement content
---
* The terminal-locked storage closet was moved to just outside the room it was in.
---
I might have missed one or two little things but otherwise the core layout is exactly. the. same. 
---
You're just being fooled into thinking it's drastically different because the pathing and lighting are different. Kudos to Bethesda for fooling you. It just didn't fool me, is all.
---
Compare let's plays prior to the change and walk through the airport. The same rooms are (mostly) in the same locations. They even have all the workbenches and vendor bot in the same locations, albeit inactive (RIP little buddy). I did precisely this because I had a weird feeling that, in terms of layout and existing assets, it's mostly the same. Not that much actually changed.
---
Don't get me wrong, it certainly FEELS different. Not arguing there. Just saying, much like a metaphor for the game overall, they reused a vast majority of the assets. The changes you see are mostly just smoke and mirrors.
---
+karma thank you for your help too!
---
One skin is not worthy of 85,7 hours of gameplay.
---
we all said it at launch time but now, after playing over 350 hours im sure i got my 60 bucks and then some, I do agree game companies shouldnt be realeasing half done games or games buged to hell like FO76 was at lunch.
---
quad explosive furious executioners bloodied 50 cal
---
Wait, when you repair armour is it possible to get over repair?
---
Armorer never repaired them, Fix it good is the perk you need.
---
Love a bit of misty sunlight! Great pic
---
“Fix it good” does. That’s what I use. Never used armored for over repair before.
---
Burnt mistress of mysteries mag, cooking oil, dirty rag, and dirty pillow. 
---
That is all
---
I found mine at the Colonel Kelly Monument.  I believe you can also find one at the Philippi Battlefield Cemetery.  There are other places as well.
---
At the Colonel Kelly Monument, you want to look for a tourist's corpse at the top laying on a bench facing the statue.  I had to visit it several times.  Gave up and just decided to server hop until one appeared.
---
Once you find one, you will need to go repair it.
---
A scam is when a dude from New Delhi calls to say my computer's fucked. This is just shitty business.
---
im  sure they will, the map is much bigger than the places that we could actually go to.
---
i just use bird bones, cant remember the last time a fall did me in. of course i don't go hanggliding from a mountaintop without my hangglider, lol, so im usually ok. i usually scrip armor with fall damage buff,  should i be selling it??
---
I’ve always thought about a TSAAIQE 50.Cal

---
It's a shame for sure.
---
I come to sacrifice myself o great beast of the old gods. 
---
Take my soul into the void and let it swim endlessly for all times.
---
My bad. Have been offline for weeks and had the wrong perk going on. Thanks!
---
Pick your poison, all the robot helmets count, the assault gas mask looks sweet, especially with the drifters coat, the order of mysteries veil, the enclave masks. Is there Some other vibe your going for, like a stalker style mask with exposed cylinders? 
---
They could introduce a perk named something like "bucket head" that allows you to wear power armor helmets out of armor.
---
My mistake. Works fine with that one
---
If you have friends on the server, log off and then wait a bit and log on again. Now you have a CAMP close to the action.
---
If you don't, server hop.
---
It's not much work for the target, but much work for the agressor, mostly without reward.
---
I have most of my characters CAMPs near Morgantown and have had to log off and back on a few times. Two or three I think.
---
Yes with "fix it goo". I had wrong perk because of the long offline time
---
Umm... what this guy said. Armorer never assists with repairs.
---
You can craft over-condition stuff with Armorer (though it's really your Intelligence doing the work) but not over-repair them with it.
---
Mine simply fly you off the cliff when you're done not buying anything. And it does free of charge.
---
Every time since the first encounter.
---
PSA robot armor helmets count as gas masks
---
Yeah, I have heard the game has improved somewhat, but I wont go back to it. I feel I played enough of the game to warrant my moneys worth, and what they have added isn't enough for me at least. I just wont be buying another Bethesda game until the prices drop drastically from now on. Fool me once and all that.
---
Assuming it's not a mod ini configuration issue (if you're using mods), sometimes I find if I fast travel as soon as I login, it doesn't work. 
---
Just leave the map, wait a few seconds, and go back into the map and try again. That usually works for me.
---
the pixelated tree branches from 2005 is the true haunting factor of that picture
---
well as we seen limited doesnt really means that, at least for BGS
---
but ussually they would have a timer when they are not permanent, if they are permanent they usually just say new item.
---
It's a bug it's happened to me too.
---
Why not use rads? Well hydrated gives ap boost
---
That is high level troll!
---
That's nice opinion and it is cool, that bethesda actualy reduced price at new paintjobs.
---
Maybe the challenge is bugged?
---
&gt; **Please make Backpacks count while in Power Armor** 
---
Please don't. Backpacks made Excavator PA less essential for hoarder types. With the way that it is, it makes non-PA scavver builds totally viable.
---
it is to make a proper seal between the mask and your face, at least in the real world it is. one off the reasons we have to shave in the military.
---
It's bugged sometimes.  Fast travel to a location then you should be able to after that.  At least that's the only way I'v been able to when this happens.
---
this has almost 1k upvotes because .. ?
---
Or we are having a different experience playing the, game. I don't know why the game would be stable for some and not others other than internal factors in our setup. I can play the game as long as I want and not crash or run into many issues. If others aren't as lucky as I am then I'm not sure how else to explain it.
---
Nice one bruv!

For at least the food/drink side of things, check out [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/food) and work it out for yourself.
---
Different builds and playstyles have different requirements and preferences.
---
It's not personal hate towards Todd, but how he conducts himself, blatantly lying to the consumers just to get that tasty cash.
---
Can you think of another "MMO" that has failed as hard on launch on console? 
---
I also don't blame him for coming back to try the new stuff. Shit still smells like shit no matter how many colourful air fresheners you drape on it.
---
The fact that they also create problems to sell a solution shows they don't care about the gameplay, just more ways to get money from the "cosmetic only" store.
---
He also knows that it's not the devs fault that these decisions have been made, which is why he keeps repeating Todd so you know not to trust him. E3 is coming, and I for one am excited to see what lies he tries to shovel down our throats next.
---
Those all seem like human like things so its prolly bugged
---
I think this game needs new weapons for sure. 
---
If they add them though, I hope they make adjustments to damage values for existing guns and make the new ones viable as well, because otherwise the legendary pool will simply become diluted with more guns for the scrip machine.
---
I've seen someone selling the rewards so you can definitely get it, have you tried killing an actual player maybe? What weapon are you using?
---
Raizorgrain (0/1)
---
basically it boils down to I want to add more decorations to my camp and it might be a good way to help regulate the in game economy.
---
so?
---
I agree, they could even have some of the other vault swellers become NPC's, so it still fits in with the Lore, but also brings life to the game.
---
I have logged in several times with my CAMP in a nuked area and nothing got destroyed. You must have been loading in just when the nuke hit.
---
Try refreshing your ini files. That seems to be the problem with people who use mods. 
---
I get that you don't use mods but still could be fixed the same way if yours is out of whack.
---
The technology isn't there yet. Please be patient.
---
Sorry but it's obvious just a skin
---
because fast traveling into their foundations is surely the CAMP owners fault. 
---
tbh i‘ll gladly take the hardened mass
---
This 100%
---
If I were in this situation, knock on wood, there'd be no waiting. I would immediately inform every appropriate authority figure I can reasonably contact.
---
Not even simply for the safety of my family and I. If a person is really this unstable, they could snap in a similar fashion on *anyone.* Potentially even *their own* loved ones.
---
Seriously. OP if you're reading this, do not wait. Do it now. The longer you wait, the more unnecessary risk you invite.
---
Is it me or are people more demanding with prices since player vending was released? I meanI used to spend 3880 caps on a mutation...
---
Aaaand you just got downvoted because you said the very bad word... "PvP".
---
Jesus, these snowflakes.

Who would ever write this?
---
I could be wrong, but seems like something someone insecure would write about themself.
---
You can lock them to keep others out. [Here's the basic idea.](http://www.gamersheroes.com/game-guides/how-to-lock-extractors-in-fallout-76/)
---
The owner never spawns where the visitors spawn. You have to have someone else fast travel to your CAMP to see where they end up. It's usually where you first placed the CAMP device.
---
Sorry to say that but it means you are a loot addict...

I hope Cletus have a straw hat and a side by side shotgun.
---
You can do shielded lining for casual?
---
He's more sensational that he use to be but mostly agree, even if he can rub people up the wrong way.
---
He has a very good point that with Todd's attitude about how it's not about how the game launched but what it'll become and that they expected a ton of problems on launch = never preorder a BGS game ever again because they simply don't care to put in the time and effort to fix it as much as they can prior to launch.
---
It's the "fix it in post", "just photoshop it" kind of attitude.
---
Actually nothing should be above 1000 caps... especially at the rate in which they give us free atoms... I receive less then 20 per day...
---
just becuase you dont experince no crashes or many bugs, doesnt mean the game it is stable, you are lucky.
---
 I really dont understand why you keep bringing "your set up" game crashing to desktop/dashboard, or straigth up server not responding is not "my setup problem" is BGS problem, specially when I can play anyother game without problems. if my pc/console is broke or TV/monitor and/or I have internet problems then yes it is my setup, but anything other than that it is not.
---
You find a broken pro-snap camera on a body as the others have said, and it triggers the quest Bucket List. Just Google it and then server hop at one of the body spawn locations, thats the easiest way tbh.
---
Big billboard north from ws ... theres a farm north of it. Has multiple cats

For sure. While his character may not be to everyone's tastes, he makes valid points.

What hole did you crawl out of?  Go back in it.
---
yeah, you and me both. 
---
i was just giving me 2 caps lol
---
This is almost exactly my build. Great to see other people approve of this as well!
---
The irony here is you got fooled. What you learned or actually failed to learn is that a few minor changes can drastically change what an area looks like.
---
The new airport looks amazing and noting like the old one in my opinion. The old one was terrible and hardly seemed like an airport interior. But now I found out a lot of it is the same. So my takeaway is that Bethesda did a good job at using minor changes to cause a massive facelift.
---
The change is night and day and you're the one that got fooled
---
It's a bug dude. A seemingly unimportant one since they haven't bothered fixing it for a while. First noticed it a while back.
---
Holy shit, all that and zero useful info, why even comment. They are permanent, only the blackbird and vault tech outfit are limited.
---
Right now I have more carry weight outside of my excavator power armor with calibrated shocks. How does that make any sense? Power armor is already the worst armor in game. It doesn’t have legendary effects, requires fusion cores, and staggers you when you land and makes you sink in water. All while standard armor has so many options for legendary effects you don’t stagger when you land from heights you can swim and stealth eiaser all while being more tanky and avoid larger amounts of cc and damage due to a large portion of perks not working inside of power armor. At this point it’s a glorified hazmat suit.
---
I use just 1\* for 5% more damage, 3\* (with 7%) is just not worth it, in my opinion.
---
absolutely agree. Welcome mats should be implemented in F76!!! Hopefullly Bethesda is reading this post ;-)
---
I Googled Kralnor never heard of him before this. I see why you would think so but in truth I put this in to provide myself a link for those frequently asked lowbie questions on how to get money, get past the leveling hurdle (especially around the level 20 area's) and to address the issue of running out of heal aids. It is an easy to overlook perk card slash gameplay strategy that I overlooked myself for probably 400 or so hours. and if you dont like green thumb I don't care you can stay :)
---
Try using a different weapon on a scorched or ghoul
---
Was thinking the same . But is it a flat dmg increase after the 1st shot hits ?
---
You can use your controller for the vita and phone as well.
---
I used a mole miner gauntlet at a super mutand and my friend used super sledge and both counted...
---
You still wear the backpack when you get into PA as shown in the animation. For crying out loud, just make it to work universally, PA or not.
---
I didn't do any tests, but from information on the card it's enemy is gain 5% more damage for some time after initial hit.
---
It's mentioned in-game that the civilian survivors were learning how to make leather clothing and armour - responder-level gear seems to be more of what the underequipped group of civilians had available, it would be hard to access to some of the most elite personal protection equipment available in an area without a marine/naval base within walking distance, these people were struggling to make bunless cramburgers
---
hi dickhead,
---
the same thing can be said and asked about your comment. 
---
bye dickhead.
---
Well it really depends if the people on the servers you play on have heavy gunner builds. I know I’m starting one up from a 2h melee build and I’m in pretty dire need of it.
---
Servers seem to have set legendary effect drops, it generally a good idea to farm a few legendaries to see if purveyor will put out good loot.
---
So what you’re saying is they didn’t change much apart from all of the things they did change? Big boy over here not being fooled by something that isn’t designed to fool anyone. Aside from “ignoring the small lore changes” - what you just described are pretty significant changes.
---
There is a stairwell down to the sub-level opposite the door that is keycard-locked (leading upstairs). Head down there and you will find it :)
---
Ok let me know I might have something u want
---
That's what's I'm saying it can't shoot lasers woth an explosive effect attached to a weapon.
---
Think about it lasers don't explode things they melt things 😊 they like a light sword
---
Ok, thank u . Got to test
---
My god...
---
I'm hoping that you just catastrophically misread what I've written in all of my comments, cause the alternative... Wow. Just... wow...
---
Let me help you out a little here buddy by quoting what I wrote earlier.
---
"They really didn't change all that much --&gt; in terms of LAYOUT and ASSETS &lt;--".
---
My god, do you actually realise that we agree that the small changes made have made an impact?
---
Here, again:
---
"...for few changes they did make made all the difference. Totally changes the feel for the location. "
---
Aside from the few changes listed, the core layout is exactly the same. Most of the assets are exactly the same.
---
I don't know how I can possibly dumb it down any further to help you to understand. 
---
Do you wanna, like, start over dude? Cause you just erected a Burning Man sized straw man and that had nothing to do with what I'd said, originally or subsequently.
---
"quintessential bad boy of Fallout 76" had me cracking up
---
The whole Mama Dolces is a Chinese cover. There's one in FO3 too.
---
Give us the ability to fix other people's camps.
---
Wouldn't have to, could maybe give you some XP, wouldn't take away from the PVP experience. But the option would be nice. Most of the time I enjoy the PVP, but sometimes I walk by a camp that's taken a ton of damage and wish I could help.
---
We all came out of the same vault (since there's no other human characters) to rebuild - feel like people might still occasionally want to give other fellow dwellers a leg up.
---
I've just been farming mole miners to get black titanium to make my first set of excavator armor.  Selling the weapons they had has made me over 1000 caps in two nights of play, that's without even trying hard.
---
(I do have hard bargain 3).
---
And there we go with everyon saying bugged.
---
Have you first tried changing weapon to an actual melee? Like a sword,knife?
---
That's a goddamn nope right there good sir. Sheeps  McGee finds me constantly no matter where I am.
---
When they added that cool outfit last week with firefighter skins I farmed 500atoms in one day and i have done 90% of challenges already.
---
I agree. I also wish the Alien Blaster would get done love since it's pretty unusable atm
---
I’d like to think he escaped in the mayhem and is now mutated and will be Beth’s new quest beast called night of Cletus frawg!
---
?
---
 Im sorry I dont have neither the time, nor the friends to find an alien figthing a naked guy in Toxic Valley for 10 atoms. Also, I would love to see that challenge list that made you 500 atoms in a day... that or play 7600 hours for 80 atoms.
---
The fixer is automatic only if you put automatic receivers. Trust me I used the automatic aspect to burn 15k of ammo.
---
I love The Fixer if you're specced into it.
---
I use rads as well but I have noticed high damage output from bloodied weapons when near starving and dehydrated.
---
My first time at whitespring golf club was killing high level ghouls with a half-optimized melee build (half optimized was because I didn't have all the slugger perks and strength points at the time - I swapped by build about 4 times - first a slugger, then heavy gunner, then shotgunner and the final decision was a stealth commando - now with an optimized bloodied stealth commando and optimized bloodied stealth rifleman I can shred any trash mobs like ghouls and super mutants and kill scorchbeasts in 6 shots each)
---
Ok, looks like I have to dumb it down for you too.
---
The context was in terms of layout and assets. That's mostly the same.
---
&gt;A scorched-infested hell hole, blood on the walls, bodies on the floor. A vertibird crashed right through the roof of the building. The responder-bot vendor, lifeless on the floor. Haunting notes and holotapes accompanied the resting place of many responders. These small changes really set the scene for a fresh-out-the-vault dweller in a way that the previously dull and lacklustre Morgantown Airport did not. It actually made me want to invest in reading terminal entries and notes. To listen to holotapes, and to follow the story. It made me realise how lifeless, and how hopeless the Appalachian wasteland is. 
---
Here's the kicker, almost every single thing you waxed lyrically over existed before the change. The only change you described that actually is different is that the vendor bot is lifeless. Everything else existed pre-change. 
---
Yes, the lighting is different. Yes, the feel is different. I haven't disagreed with any of that at all. Same too with the added lore. All nice. 
---
It just absolutely boggles my mind how people just can't see it's mostly reusing the same layout and assets from the old airport. That's all.
---
Great idea. Up up up.
---
Your solution worked when I deleted the files from my documents/fallout76 folder.
---
Odd that that would do that since potentially that could allow potential exploits being able to go under part of the map
---
glowing resin. which you can farm literally anywhere lol
---
Why does anyone that follows the lore get down voted so heavily? Lol. 
---
We're not gonna ignore 20 years of well written lore for a poorly interjected tale to add them to 76. Like maxson was sat in his room under lockdown and skyping people essentially lol.
---
It is what it is. Just glad that it fixed your issue.
---
Ehm, I'm a specialist and say these are at least from 2002
---
There's plenty of resources, and since vault 76 only had some of the brightest/smartest  residents it's kinda contradictory to kill fellow dwellers as in a role-playing kind of way if you'd ask me
---
All the down voting towards people who know and uphold the original and proper lore obviously have no attachment to the original games, and if your first fallout game was 3 or 4 (lol) then your opinion is worth nothing.
---
Why do people think I'm not. I have radicool and 80-85% radiation at all times. But bloodied weapons do more damage when also starving and dehydrated. Well fed and well hydrated only prevent me from getting the diseases that count towards my plague walker mutation.
---
true. even MediEvil on playstation 1 had better 3d trees. god i loved that game.
---
You sir have contradicted survival mode.
---
Check what kind of receiver it has - if automatic then Commando perks should buff it, if non-automatic then Rifleman.
---
Or a weapon inspect for console, not sure if you can do this on pc? Makes sense though as you can pick up weapon skins
---
Quad Two Shot Anti Armor Faster Fire Rate Explosive Gatling Laser would be a wet dream come true.
---
Ballistic Bock works, I use it for big boss types like a the SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquach.
---
And they somehow prevent diseases when swimming.
---
The best part of this would be if we could finally get Bethesda to separate heavy weapons from other ranged weapons at the legendary vendor.
---
I hate getting those heavy (yes I know that modded rifles are way heavier than cannons in Bethesdas world) things when I really want rifle sized weapons.
---
Just had the exact same thought! I know where I'm going later.
---
Why shouldn't they ; )))
---
Hopefully it's not as obvious as it sounds 0_0
---
Because it's a rifle.
---
You are too creative for your own good
---
&gt; Right now I have more carry weight outside of my excavator power armor with calibrated shocks. How does that make any sense?
---
Overlooking all the other absurdities (that one included, granted), how does it make any sense that you can fit into your power armour wearing your not-making-any-sense equipment that allows you to carry all of that AND allow you to carry both your personally carried items AND a power armour frame and it's carrying capacity ontop of that?
---
&gt; Power armor is already the worst armor in game. 
---
Except that it's king in terms of giving you armour AND rad protection. Armour could give you the protection but not the rad reduction. Rad suits give you the rad reduction without the protection.
---
Have all the legendary effects you want out of PA but good luck in a rad zone or if you happened to be unlucky enough to get ambushed by a mob of thicc ghouls.
---
&gt; At this point it’s a glorified hazmat suit. 
---
Given the above, that's just hilariously nonsensical.
---
I like that you can't have your cake and eat it. That it's a choice. Otherwise, why not have all perk cards active simultaneously too? Equally ridiculous.
---
So it will probably stay in that vending machine forever.
---
This post was never about the “core layout and assets.” It was simply about the changes that Bethesda did make. You described all of them in your replies, yet glossed over them as if they didn’t exist. You then took it upon yourself to introduce your own context to the discussion and then proceed to massage your own ego.
---
As for my “lyrical” description in the post - it was one that described the atmosphere and the feeling that the location gave upon arrival, and not a reference to the changes specifically. 
---
It seems that you need it explaining more than anyone else.
---
In my post I referred to the “small changes” they made and then went on to describe how that affects the way the player sees the story in early stages of the game. 
---
People know that the assets are being reused, and of course the location still closely resembles the original layout. It’s the same game and the same location.
---
I'm sorry bro, and have a good day mate!
---
I think building the siren will.
---
Try it. Put a bandana over your mouth and go swimming in toxic disease laden water. I bet you still get sick.
---
To be fair, there are three stairwells that all seemingly go to the same place but the third one leads to a closed off area.
---
Yes, got some spares on xbox
---
i have to yet come across a legendary handmade so i would buy. you wouldn‘t believe the shit people buy. they buy my perfectly preserved pies for 666caps and whatnot. so yeah, what‘s wrong with the price? i‘ve seen worse.
---
Everyone sees your gamer tag whichever that is. I’ve thought how it’d be better if we could pick which name shows.
---
yeah, somethings like that really make me want to leave some toilet paper and fertilizer.
---
What else can it be? I'm not saying anything you have is broken but it could be like a bugged item that causes a memory leak or settings. I don't know what it is or common the problem just that not everyone is experiencing it. So it has to be some difference in how the game runs on our various devices.
---
76/76 mod melee weapon  (just moding dagger from Unmoded to unmoded and back, it is nice bug)   
---
76/76 move camp   
---
20/20 take picture in mire region
---
20/20 take picture in ash heap region
---
76/76 kill scorched with some kind of weapon i don't remember i didn't have completed yet
---
Few daily and weekly challenges.
---
How could i remember them all? :D
---
Red dress and bowler (not bowler hat) always, and just,  worked for me.
---
Bowler? What’s that?
---
Ah, so the helmet is bugged. Yesterday I tried to apply it and failed. Now I wont bother...
---
There is no skill involved in pvp in F076 in it's current state, none whatsoever. It's whoever has won the drop lottery,have the knowledge of min maxing their build and also have mutations.
---
Also V.A.T.S is essentially aimbotting.
---
The only way to make it work is if they even out the playing field by having one set player level, removing legendaries, VATS and mutations.
---
But of course no one wants that because they lose their "advantage" right?
---
It’s a hat, same as the ‘bowler hat’ but without the ‘hat’ in the name..
---
Cue creepy sound from The Grudge
---
Go get calibrated shocks for your armor of choice, bam 100 lbs extra carry weight.
---
You can and sometimes I do. You can only fix things that you see some small rubble of, like a generator or a wall. Other stuff disappear completely.
---
It's a shame that some aren't experiencing the game running as it should. I wish I knew how to help.
---
But you know that Fallout is a game, and generally not very realistic one?
---
Spare plans or military IDs? Can the IDs be traded?
---
Who says "beta male" unironically?
---
Oh, Duke Nukem...
---
You and me both
---
Okay thanks!
---
Nearer to .308 cal
---
yeah, at least for X-O1.
---
I can understand that, even if it something like that. I can still do nothing about it, but wait for BGS to fix it. At least on my case it on console.
---
I don't think there's a single 1* legendary that's worth more than 1k.
---
I always use Enclave officer outfit and hat - it counts towards the challenge and you don't look like an idiot in dress (playing as a man).
---
True, but as with many things in the world of Fallout some features of some items make little sense or are at least poorly named. The black powder rifle is for example a musket but has rifle accuracy, bandanas keep you from getting a disease while swimming, the drill is a viable weapon, and so on.
---
But both rifleman and commando perks refer to “rifles”
---
Yes, I tried to put the mod on the X-01.
---
I totally agree with this, remove camp damage in adventure. I want to build realistic looking buildings, not floaters lol. CAMPS getting destroyed is just annoying and frustrating. And it forces players to build turrets which take all your pathetic camp budget, this then restricts everyones builds. Get it gone :)
---
And that's why the receiver is modifiable from semi-auto to full auto.
---
I hate fighting those things, they usually tear me up worse than the Col. Gutsies.
---
Nope
---
I used a machete on a scorched and that worked
---
Thanks all, indeed all i had to do was close my map and re-open. Feel stupid now!
---
Spent about 12+ hours looking did events hopped around the map changed servers and right when im about to log out a day later theres the tourist.
---
what a pain to find i also looked a little during the weekday mornings.
---
What console do you use? I'm on Xbox one S.
---
Try again later. Someone shooted down the cargo and it exploded. It has to be respawned.
---
On one char I am a General but never did the DMV quest. What the ****?
---
Yeah my too, I was doing good for a while not seen crashes just visual bugs here and there. Then it all changed not just me my buddies have the same problem as well.
---
Would server hopping work?
---
I would love this, but I would also think that it would just be structures (walls, roofs ans such) that were indestructable. Turrets and defences should still be able to be attacked. Probably also doord, and crops, even though I hate it when scorched for some incomprehensible reason attack my mutefruit trees. Molerats, sure, but why super mutants, do you hate corn?
---
&gt; This post was never about the “core layout and assets.” 
---
Yeah, I know dude. I'm going to quote you here since it seems relevant.
---
&gt; Give it a go and let me know what you think! 
---
I did precisely that. 
---
I didn't attack you for having the perspective you had in your OP. In fact, I agree with most of it. 
---
Don't get lost in the weeds here. Read the original comment posted. 
---
The only thing that stands out that seems to bother people is that I said, and I need to emphasise this because it seems to be lost to a number of people (not just picking on you), that in terms of the layout and assets, not that much has changed. 
---
&gt;People know that the assets are being reused, and of course the location still closely resembles the original layout. It’s the same game and the same location.
---
Look dude, I'm glad that you get it. Really I am. Based on my experience, that's just not true. You're very much in the minority. 
---
Not just in this post with the other commenter that doesn't seem to get it but with past posts too closer to when the change was launched.
---
I don't get how a lot of people can't reconcile that it's mostly reused AND also feels different and is also an improvement.
---
Dont know. It should.
---
that is true, need to take them off the hit list.  that is the main reason I like leaving hardened mass, because it works great for the prank and gives the person getting pranked a valuable piece of junk.  much better than giving them corn.  If I'm out of hardened mass, they get glowing mass, out of that, they get nuclear waste and concrete scrap.
---
okay thank you
---
you‘re a good sport. on PC or xbox?
---
So why are you here...?
---
Welp thanks boss not only did you give me a really good laugh you caused me to wake the wife cause of said laugh. o7
---
The Treasure Trove
---
Cause I'm selling treasure maps for FREE
---
supposed to be a rare drop from events in the Ash Heap.  I think mainly Breach and Clear, but I've lost count of the amount of times I've done that one and have yet to receive those plans.
---
I had this the other day... ft into their foundation... rise up and into a room that is rendering... glad that I didn't get stuck look round for the vending machine... all I find are 2 l3 locked doors leading out... 10 seconds later the owner appears... I run to the doors r emote confusion and look at them... not blessed with any sort of common sense this person then walls me up in their hallway... I FT to the next camp to spend my 25k... their loss.
---
The display name, which you can change, is what will be displayed in-game. The account name that can’t be changed is what you use to log in.
---
if it makes you feel better, i read that the HUD isn‘t as good as it was in Fo4 and it only works about 50% of the time. i‘m using the vats overlay now and the 10% more hit chance for my sniper build is really paying off. i still can‘t hit shit even with my PER on 14 and 95% hit chance because vats doesn‘t slow down and mobs only need to run past a tree for VATS to break, but whatever lol
---
You didn't miss out on much. If you looted his dead body there'd just be a middle-finger emoji.
---
this a problem on the ps4 as well.
---
Bathrobe (WS vendor), patched suit (Watoga mayor), Patriot suit (tricentennial Edition), red Dress (WS vendor)
---
Probably all "fancy" suits - but not tested yet.
---
In case of the daily - only the legendarys with ⭐ count. Not the obviously unlegendary (Legendary)
---
I'm kind of disappointed there wasn't a patch on Tuesday... It's been 2 weeks and there's a lot of bugs that need addressing.
---
Woahwoahwoah... Are you telling me i look like an Idiot in my **bathrobe** while drink a white russian...?
---
I have no idea how but the only mod I can apply to raider under armour is shielded. I don’t remember ever getting the plan so it must have been right when the game came out or something.
---
Yes.
---
If you run with the gun killing mirelurks, yes, kinda.... ;)))
---
I wont move my CAMP until they change it so i dont have to place it again... I take pictures in the mire and ash heap but they dont count, does it have to be in a specific place? Are those chalenges repetable?
---
Every time I get the notification that a nuke has been launched I will check the map to see where.  
---
Never assume you are safe, because assumption is the mother of all f\*ck ups.
---
Yep. Lot's of cool ideas in this thread.
---
Used a regular found combat knife on a lvl 3 ghoul and it worked.
---
low level guys need stuff too!!
---
I sell 2 or 3 low level weapons, sometimes non legendary,  (along with all the 3* stuff the purveyor keeps giving me)
---
Yes, this is why.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/an-abridged-list-of-the-most-beneficial-and-easy-to-prepare-cooking-recipes/
---
This isn't an indie developer. They said content will be free, and no amount of atom sales will have any bearing on that. It's just a little extra money in their pockets.
---
Assassin’s Quad Bloodied Explosive Swing Speed guitar sword
---
You’re right. I did say that. The only problem I have with you is the way you speak to people. Nothing wrong with your opinions.
---
Yup
---
&gt; Edit: you also make valid points about the Division 2s launch. In comparison it really made Bethesda look terrible. 
---
Yeah, and rightly so, though the credit really goes to MrMatty.
---
They shipped us something that was incomplete, by a team that was clearly inexperienced, unprepared and somewhat incompetent. Not just the devs but the PR, product management and support teams as well. 
---
Given the statements give by Todd during the interview, we shouldn't expect anything to change with future games.
---
Never, ever, ever pre-order a Bethesda game. That should just apply in general but especially so for Bethesda.
---
Nope only repeatable are daily a weekly.
---
https://youtu.be/tWLgSaAayDA
---
I shall find this video by MrMatty and watch it, thank you.
---
Pre ordering now is such a minefield, I will stay away for sure.
---
Maybe he was caught in a bad romance?
---
Nice. I'll check that. Love these Fallout details.
---
i put on my poker face and just danced. it wasn‘t even loud
---
That's fair enough. I can accept that. 
---
Though to be fair to me, I was the one being attacked for, as you'd admit yourself, a perfectly sound observation.
---
IMO, instigating levers and hunting rifles are worth more than 1k, but that's about it.
---
I would drop 1000 caps per token personally. I've only seen them for sale at one vendor. I'm up to 274 tokens, I think. still got another 176...
---
Which is why I said “as far as I can tell”. I wasn’t sure.
---
If you know some other locations, would you mind telling us?
---
Sounds lovely. A lot like John Denver would sing it :)
---
Bathrobe worked perfectly for me and other player. We were at my camp and took the photos.
---
I don't trust Todd, but what my eyes see and what I can feel and touch. After the rocky start there have been many fixes and improvements to the game, which is integral to every MMO. 
---
I was on the fence for repair kits as well and even more than you, however tried to use the ones I got in game and test them out. And they aren't even viable without the perks. And with the perks, fixing equipment is camp is not even a chore, even more realistic than combining weapons in previous Fallout games.
---
As for your remark about failing MMOs on console. There the bar is set so low that F76 should be considered successful. Most of them don't even launch.
---
And please understand that I do not give a sheet about Todd. I enjoy the game, I want to know what developers think and the outlines of the updates in the future and if I don't like them. There is always an exit, let's not make everything a Brexit. Because if someone listens only on the salesman and purchase the product, they are the one to blame. But if the product is improved without you investing in it, other than your time, test it, then criticize if you like it or not.
---
Seeing his other videos, Jim should not be trusted to buy a pack of toilet paper to wipe his behind. Salty about everything and playing games he openly dislikes at least for views. No, his views are tainted on a terms he would have a hard time to even outline and no ammount of filters will make his content watchable.
---
Everyone knows that.
---
What I’ve learned:
---
I wave.  If they wave back, and don’t immediately run off, then I will drop stuff, follow me emote, then hit the gift emote.  If they are really new to the game, they might not see the bag.  I throw a light on it, and point with rifle.  If they still don’t get it, I will shoot at the bag if they aren’t close to it, or shoot straight up then put the light on it.  Usually they get the idea, grab everything, and heart/thumbs up.
---
Also I mainly only do this for level 10 or less now.  Usually by level 10 they have their legs.  Except plans, I will drop those for peeps I help defend workshops if there are no low levels on.
---
One last thing:  sometimes a low level is someone’s alt.  They will be aggressively running around and probably don’t need or want help.  Don’t take it personally.  
---
Peace.
---
There are some workarounds, if it wont let you delete "piece A" check and see what other pieces its touching.  It seems like randomly the game will decide "piece A" is essential in holding up "piece B"
---
\[A\]-\[B\]
---
What I find works is adding something to piece B and then trying to delete piece A again.  
---
\[A\]-\[B\]-\[C\]
---
And now that B is anchored onto C, it doesn't need A to stay around, and you can usually delete it now.
---
\[B\]-\[C\]
---
The only issue I've had is if I've tried to build a tree house, no matter what I do, sometimes those floors just won't delete.
---
That's just his like opinion, man
---
Woah, that changes things!  Didn't know that!
---
If there is a lone piece not removable, try to add more to it, and each time you add something (a foundation for example) go back and try to delete the initial piece.
---
I've been thinking about changing my display name. I wanted to be consistent with Reddit, but everyone I play with is on discord and my name there is just "Appa"
---
An Explosive melee weapon? wow
---
I'll break it down by category of what you're going to need
---
Unyielding: will boost your stats (including strength which plays a part in your melee damage)
---
Bolstering: if you're not trying to be just a glass cannon then this will help. Gives up to 35 extra protection the lower your health is
---
Cavalier: chance to reduce damage while sprinting. I imagine as a melee build you'll be running like a mad man so that should help. 
---
Pnuemonic mod on chest: keeps you from staggering which will keep you moving 
---
Perks:
---
Nerd rage: extra damage and survivability while low health
---
Serendipity: chance to straight up ignore damage while low health
---
Dodgy: actual ignore damage spending Action points to do so
---
Fireproof: excellent in PvP where everyone is nonstop with the explosives but also reduces scorch beast blasts to nearly nothing. 
---
Mutations:  
---
Adrenal reaction: basically a second stack of bloodied applied to every weapon you're holding. 
---
marsupial: as everyone else has it so you may as well have the jump to get in there
---
Speed demon: some may disagree but I find this to be the best mutation in the game. Yes it mostly helps with reloading guns but you sprint so much faster which has helped me out of so many situations its rediculous. 
---
Scaly skin: you lose out on some so but with unyielding armor you're basically getting it back anyways. 
---
Twisted muscles: absolute must if you're stixming to straight melee. It buffs you 25%
---
That's fair, I guess many MMO games on console fail. I haven't played it on PC, does it stack up well compared to other PC MMO's? I ask as you seem more knowledgeable on the subject than I.
---
I do disagree about your point on Jim playing games he openly dislikes though. By having a game critic play games they don't like will help to highlight problems a fan of the series would not see. It is also good to review both games you like and dislike for the interest of balance. But that is just my opinion of course. 
---
What new content has been added as of late? The reason I wont pick the game back up is I feel I have done everything there is to do. And with the constant nerfs to weapons and perks put me off even more, as it seems like they make the game more difficult/tedious to cover up the fact there isn't much to do when you reach then end, which doesn't take too long.
---
Well, I kinda understand him - I hate when people have they mic active all the time and I can hear how they chew, drink, listening to some music in the background etc. It should be use for communication, not listening to your crappy music...
---
More weapons and more mods for existing weapons, especially those that are lacking (looking at you 10mm sub).
---
I can agree with that but I think it’s too much of an overhaul of the current armor system. It does seem there’s room for more legendary effects, at least 2* worth, so why not do a faction star? Each faction can have several possible legendary effects available through quests of course, and a set of faction armor could be viable without being too op. The Responder’s star could be a % chance to keep a stimpak when you revive someone, raider could be improved drug use effect etc. 
---
FWIW i never wear power armor anyways lol
---
I'm gonna build right here.
---
On this fissure.
---
Agreed!
---
I mean I think it has to be pretty common because no one is doing arktos or whatever it's called and you'd think everyone would be doing if you've done it before because it's pretty fun and has good rewards. There's a guaranteed 3 star legendary boss at the end. It's never crashed on me and every time I go in there a few people will join me, like one or two, however it's never enough to gather the the mats to max out the friendly monsters it spawns to defend so I'm still not getting the full experience. I wonder if it could be a bugged item that causes a memory leak.
---
Even just a few metal supports could do wonders with the look and feel of those places.
---
rip console players but now i have a collection of hundreds of interesting pics, lots of them are in the middle of a fight or something, others are places, etc... all my pics have stories now before it was just some wacky bug or me trying to look cool with some outfit but now i see them and remembering my old days in the game, it's awesome!
---
then use the mute button, it’s not that hard. normal people can only listen to country roads or the two shitty melodies on the jukebox so many times before they go crazy, you know? 
---
and it‘s reasonable to shoot me and tell me that he‘ll find me again and again? lordT
---
Old way used to be farming raw flux and selling it. Now that they nerfed it, I have been making and selling marine tactical helmets. 3 rubber, 1 glass, 1 plastic.  Put on super duper and go to town crafting. Takes 45ish, I think, to wipe out nearly all of the 1400 cap limit. Takes me about 5 min to do, from crafting to selling them all. The Civil war top hat supposedly sells well, and requires only a single piece of cloth to craft, but I have had no luck in finding the plan for it.
---
All but the last part. 
---
I'm at least glad that they don't break stealth, though part of me kind of wants that to happen too. Throw a wrench into a stealth mission/encounter.
---
text chat? you mean the mod? as it only works with people who also have it installed, do you happen to randomly find ppl using it?
---
I miss text chat since beta but didnt want to take the risk of using it xD
---
I think a pipe shotgun would be nice, like the ones for fallout 4s concept art.
---
Log out to desktop and back into the game, same thing happened to me. First kill after logging in I got the reward.
---
This does work sometimes, but other times trying to add an items gives the dreaded "intersects with an existing object" error
---
I can't stop laughing at the urban dictionary entry. Can't tell if the author is praising or insulting your name. So sorry your wife was contacted by a creep! Yuck.
---
yeah, the mod. i would‘ve stopped playing if it wasn‘t for it. i wonder how people find events with likeminded people without it, but i‘m also glad not everyone uses it. filters out the idiots, as it takes some brains to install. 
---
there‘s global, local, trade and party chat. pretty amazing.
---
Or, you know, you could be less obnoxious and more considerate towards your fellow players. Just a thought.
---
Execute order 76
---
Why I should do something instead of you? Why don't you turn on Push-To-Talk in you PC and use microphone only when you have something to say? In my opinion you acted like a dickhead, not the guy who was annoyed by your behavior. So in real life you're one of those morons who turn the music in his phone on speakers and ask people nearby to mute you?  Stick you head outside your ass and behave...
---
It's pink, not red. It's found in a portaloo at Quarry X3
---
Yeah that’s why I started spending a little more time daily .
---
Agree with this. If it makes sense in context e.g. you're holding a rave somewhere, sure. I'm sure people could let that slide. 
---
What the OP described seems obnoxious and inconsiderate.
---
Doesn't excuse what the other person did either, to be fair.
---
Yup, same server too. I left once the 5th nuke was launched. It was aimed towards my camp.
---
This is great...  Thank you for you're time . 
---
So the cavalier is a perk on the armour ? 
---
This chest mod ,how can one obtain it?
---
Gonna spent some points in those  perks you mentioned . 
---
How do I mix the armour ? More Bolstering than unyielding ?
---
Thx for info, I'll look there. BTW - do you want to sell it? Or trade for yellow (if you're on Pc)?
---
I got ambushed by 2 of those beasts at the same time last night  to too far from my camp, came as a surprise to say the least.
---
Thankfully I happened to have a nice Vampires 50 cal on me (from the purveyor, I'm not built to properly use heavies yet) so I was able to stand toe to toe with them.
---
Thx everyone
---
i was chased by two dudes lv 3 and 4 when i arrive to the responders camp in flatwoods i wave  them and they chase me with a pipe weapon and a machete lmao i just run until they stop following lmao it's was kinda fun
---
what wasn't fun is that i was building some shitty shack in a corner near some rocks and behind a tree to use some workbenches because the overseer camp and the other you are an easy target but then somehow apparently i got 1st or something in the server because i was just hiding building and some lv 200 dude came to my camp an killed me from behind lol but hey! at least he closed the door... xd
---
Much like the game, I think we're going to have to keep grinding for it on the sub and in the Bethesda forums until we get confirmation that it's coming.
---
Thanks for doing your part :)
---
As a workaround, place the object on a mat, and drag the .at under the stairs.
---
That's nice. Real nice. Holy fuck it's amazing!
---
I missed the blackbird paint all the previous times it was available, definitely getting my hands on it this time.
---
I quite like the backpack too, but I'm still stuck on the revive an ally part of the tadpole quest so I can't get it progressed.
---
imagine the pipe fiesta!
---
You must have been offline in the weeks the camera came out. It was pretty much all that was discussed. The main trouble was finding the dead tourists that had them. Even today all the scout quests have camera sections that must be completed...
---
Then I've already done most of those...
---
For the underarmor for the atomshop yeah.
---
I craft and sell food to the vendors everyday with Super Duper and the charisma perk that increases prices on things sold to vendors.
---
I get anywhere from 280-330 caps a day and it takes maybe 7 minutes to gather supplies and craft at my camp.
---
Startled: 0
---
Blown away: everytime
---
he stepped over a line that he or none should, never bring family into it. with that I can also say you are a better man than me. I wouldnt wait for nothing, I would gone straight for his head. 
---
also your impact was so huge on FO76 that after 350+ hours in game play and months of me been here this is the first time I heard about you. so no your impact was close to none or very minimal (sorry to bust your bubble).
---
ouch i got downvoted rip me lol
---
I wish (and I know many will disagree) that legendary effects are disabled in survival. Otherwise its a big bloodied, TSE mode
---
and that those weapons hurts you a lot if they break so everyone use pipes for everything else and boards with nails xd
---
True, those are good.
---
I have this as one of the first pictures I ever took.
---
During B.E.T.A I was walking through the woods near Sutton I think. Looking for plants to make disease cure. When out of nowhere he showed up and shouted. Causing me to panic and shoot. It wasn't till I went to loot him a saw the name and was like.
---
" Oh, you were friendly... Oops "
---
First and only time I've ever seen him. I think he's still upset at me. 😅
---
How do you have hundreds? On Xbox it won’t allow me to take any over 40 :(
---
Ahhhh... The cliffs above the northern entrance. Great choice!
---
Sometimes having a Moth joining me there.
---
I was looking for one as well, it's now impossible to get it cheap in the US unless you find a physical copy in stores. (Which is hard since most stores threw them in the trash months ago if they had any left.)
---
but how we resolve the awkward moment after a  event ended? we just aim to each other with fatmans and walk away slowly? lol
---
91 is a weird number lol
---
Given the Combat Armor right leg still weighs 2lb more than the left in Fo4, I wouldn't hold my breath for any kind of fix.
---
But it's comfy tho lol
---
I literally have green thumb on all the time because I brew a lot of alcohol. I’m just not as enthusiastic as you about it is all!
---
Once again, you claimed you also did tests on it and when I asked you for the numbers you just went silent and never replied. So sorry if I don't believe you.
---
Yeah it is. You can actually get it as the 2nd star on an unyielding piece too so you get both. I would start out with 3 unyeiding/ 2 bolstering split with the cavalier only being applied when you can find it as a second perk. Maybe go 2/3 if you Find you want more defense still.  The chest mod can commonly be found by scrapping mostly though the marine one is very hard to get any mods on. Takes a ton of scrapping. You're going to want PvP 50 brotherhood of steel chest and heavy leather limbs with those legendary effects if you can find them. Those have the highest damage resistance overall as far as armor go in the game.
---
K, will wait and see, as this is a very recent change that happened less than a week ago. So it will be fun to watch you eat crow.
---
I frequently shit on camp beds if the camp has high prices, but this is not my mark.
---
Begin again.
---
I would love to be able to put the doorway wall up with my stairs.  It looks stupid having to leave the  one wall out because for some reason the wall and the stairs can't stap together.  So I have 3 walls around the foundation but can't place the last wall because even though it looks like it should it won't with the stairs attached.  If you take out the stairs the wall will go in but then the stairs won't attach so it just looks stupid.  I find that if I have more than that one foundation I can't place my camp if I want to move and have to totally rebuild.  They really should fix the camp system and don't even get me started on trying to put up fencing in any kind of square as have of it wont snap together and will most likely bury itself if it does snap.  So frustrating.
---
Make this only for melee plz. I don't want to be forced to kit my handmade out with the heaviest stuff.
---
Thanks for the tip. I always seem to be swimming in purified water, so carnivore sounds like it will cover the food needs nicely.
---
My sledge worked too.
---
i think you're just being unlucky, i mean i play on xbox so I can't be sure about pc players, but on xbox I've made many friends who(those that didn't drop the game) still play with me daily
---
just make sure you don't give up! also recommended placed to make friends: whitesprings, nuke zones, events, or even greeting the visitors at your camp!
---
What if they made a group event quest for the board?
---
Like a bandit bot that you sign up with to be part of the "game" it then shows you the names of others playing and everyone involved hunts each other down. Last dweller standing get a nice prize and caps.
---
While those uninvolved can go about their way.
---
1. It hardly ever procs with gatling laser. it isn't hearsay rumor or guessing for me. out of maybe ten times I have actually manage to get shots off I managed to get a stagger off once.
---
2. I agree with increasing the drop rate of caps in survival. 
---
3. most of the fallout population are not geared for pvp and fall into the loot pinata category. so for cap farming players TSE works fine. its against the top tier players where the advantages fall off. 
---
4. I wish they could have taken a page from Guild Wars 2 many of their builds were cross compatible with pvp and pve and crafting was in a seperate pool of skills altogether.
---
5. Agreed on the stealth boy nerf, but breaking out of stealth wont help if they don't also increase the time to kill.  
---
6. It is to me. even from fallout one getting the first set from brotherhood of steel. power armor is a big part of the fallout universe and needs to be more viable if they want people like me to pvp. I wouldn't take workshops if I didn't need the fusion cores.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw7njb/the\_way\_of\_the\_vamp\_laser\_gat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw7njb/the_way_of_the_vamp_laser_gat/)  this explains it better.and this.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/) Essentially I hate crafting and inventory management my whole playstyle is built around avoiding those two things. so I'm in a catch 22 when it comes to taking shops. I don't defend them simply because I cant very well and its just more efficent to rebuild. my game time is limited I cont care to waste it on a meaningless battle that will only result in losing more caps and even more time. If I manage to survive the first hit I do try that first time. but I don't go back, there's no money in it for me. 
---
7. \-
---
8. This is a rough guess so don't shoot me for being innaccurate but out of a 24 hour total of game time on average I get attacked in my shop in adventure mode about once or twice. given server size of 25 players or so and the number of server I end up going to during that time period I would say I share the map with about a hundred different players at that time.  So I'm guessing a very low percentage of the fallout population even does pvp at all, out of that percentage that does do pvp I only had my camp attacked twice by pvpers in about a thousand [h](https://hours.SO)ours. SO No not everyone would destroy a camp because they could, in fact almost no one does, only the really douchy or salty do. People who destroy camps (or used to) are a very small toxic unliked portion of the community. its not normal and no no one does that we all have an inner voice when were being stupid and mean for no reason and most of us humans don't do that sort of thing. if you cant understand why you probably never will. and no there's nothing wrong with us. were not weak, we just aren't Assholes. The fault lies in the missing inner voice that seems to be lacking for that small portion of the human population. If you don't have it  you are broken not everyone else.
---

11. out of the small portion of the pop mentioned in 8 almost that entire segment of the population wears those stupid outfits. I automatically deduct IQ points when I see it and assume whoever wearing it is most likely a douche. not every mascot head wearer is a toxic greifing douch but almost all toxic greifing douches wear those stupid mascot heads. I see a correlation. I would probably have less of a negative reaction to those outfits if the people wearing them weren't cunts 90% of the time I interact with them.
---
Yes my lord.
---
Ps4 here. It's a static spawn, the portaloos are down a slope in the bottom corner of the quarry. That's one of the easier costume pieces. Good luck getting all the nurse outfits, leather coats and jumpsuits ;)
---
Totally dude. You misspelled Maxson btw :)
---
Agree. I think that soon it's out of beta there will be a set back and also survivor only chars.
---
I also think that the beta as it was rolled out was to test the mechanics with top gear players to get the most/best references.
---
Its annoying that the card has a pic of power armor, I didn't know for like 4 months.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I'm so tempted to dive into all those other mutations and just run class freak now. At least it would put a new spin on the game. I love the three I have now. There are always people in camps selling them for 500 or less.
---
The sheilded plans can drop from the Rose questline which bypasses the normal terrible method of obtaining these. I have the feeling it was intended to drop everytime but is bugged
---
...
---
Good..... good.....
---
Actually, can I get my cards activated all the time!  Lol I forgot to change my cards 80% of the time anyway....
---
Yup, same, On PC it like it should be, but on Xbox it's white, very strange...
---
I see that same with one of my excavator skins, its silver on the PC but white on Xbox...
---
Or just as you've snuck up on half a dozen supermutant primes and warlords losing your sneak attack advantage for you and prattling on about terms and conditions while you're being introduced to the business end of half a dozen miniguns, ah good times!
---
Thank for info - I've already have all possible outfits and clothes, including all asylum worker colors and all event outfits (both leather coats, tattered field jacket, both western outfits, camo jumpsuit, responder fireman outfit+hat, VTU baseball Cap, all jumpsuits from savage divide etc.), set of Mr Fuzzy soiled costume.
---
sigh... that's why we told you to stay at flatwoods sam! you didn't fail all the military test to venture alone in the mire what were you thinking?
---
**no offense,** but you just began acting really edgy towards the end. Very edgy and cringy. While the guy is a dick for messaging your wife like that, the easiest solution would've been to block the boy and install cameras somewhere in your house. Alternatively, build a real life Enclave bunker with ultra-secure doors and stuff, and wait for him there.
---
But yeah. The end of the post is just cringy and edgy.
---
While this would be awesome, properly balancing the current weapons first is more important imo
---
pc, that's why i said rip console players u.u
---
Eh, fairly excessive when you have calibrated shocks on your power armor. Wouldn't reject it though. :)

Got it.

I used to play at launch and we could loot and server hop, then loot again.
---
72 hours. Got it. Thanks.
---
Thx alot .... Gonna check this evening what kind of pieces I allready have . Can I send you a pic of my pieces later on so you can judge what to keep ? Are you by any chance on PS4?
---
Most people just keep a PA chassis or at least a set of excavator PA to farm ores and for the added carry weight when fast traveling. I dind't even know people actually cared about the acrobat armor.
---
Yep, I figured. Because I used to do this.
---
Came back to Fallout 76 because I heard a lot changed and still had it installed.
---
Loving it so far.
---
More overpriced garbage, great
---
Yes, I got the same feeling. Could be the ego from all that PVPing, I know that happens.  COD kids easily throw a tantrum every time they die. Presumably because they're used to getting all these awesome "47 man killstrek, mom!!!" things. Too used to getting them.
---
The threats at the end were just edgy and cringy, borderline childish. I'm dissapointed and cringing from the threats at the same time, still.
---
DAE PC MASTER RACE?!?!?!?
---
If you're worried about 7 dollars then don't buy games and get some food, dude !
---
I never even knew this guy existed to begin with. OP could also be in the middle of a publicity stunt. Then again, he's known and hated by people for PVPing in 76, stopping at no methods.   
---
GTA tryhards don't stop at methods neither, they *will* use the worst methods if you kill them even twice. source; experience with them
---
Top 10 anime betrayals
---
What kind of creature did you kill? I'm at 0% and neither mutants nor ghouls are working for me. Or does it state animal in english version?
---
The guy sent me a friend request and I ignored it so he nuked my base. Classy
---
That’s how it’s done
---
It should be the same as shooting someone when stealing from bag. Maybe they should get a bounty.
---
The post is cringy and reeks of "edgy" to me. Could be insecure, but dude, do you even know what *beta male* means?
---
It says human-like creature I believe. I killed a lvl 3 feral ghoul, with a combat knife I found in world because I didn't have a melee weapon on me. If it's not working, try  hard restarting the game and system.
---
Same

Don't know why you're getting downvoted. This post is just r/iamverybadass or r/iamverycool material.
---
Yeah, atom store.
---
Damn man you can't store photos can you. On PC I can store old photos and make room for new, I have files full of crazy pictures from this game
---
I am actually.
---
nice pic, it has a feeling that it can be a poster for a horror film.
---
That pretty good mate also I forgot to say that a might fine collection you have you must of grind for those
---
Yea for some reason reg unarmed melee aren’t working. I had to use a fire ax on a scorched, my DGC wouldn’t register the kill.
---
Yea I was pretty mad about the excavator skin. Not silver at all.
---

---
It is not dumb to think a death claw hide drops from a deathclaw.  I haven't started that badge yet so I'm glad you made your post.
---
1st thing I would have done would be to go hunt death claws as well. 
---
I hope that gets changed in the future to where they can actually drop their own hide.
---
Be careful what you ask for... everyone will go back to PVPing in Adventure mode and we'll have to hear more o.0 bitching about dying while owning workshops. Personally I'm willing to give survival PVE a week to get to level 50 again and get some weapons and armor but then I better be able to find constant fights. The only end game enemies worth killing are other players. Everything else is a cake walk.
---
Ahh okay that makes a lot more sense! There was so much shit in a cluster there I was just tossing grenades in and once the dust had settled I found that body in the pile and was confused.. lol
---
Even so I would assume you were only trying to fool me into letting my guard down.
---
The ID that cones out of the machine when you finish the training.  It kept giving me extras till I had 20.   Yes, you can trade them
---
Then this doesn't concern you. Butt out.
---
Yeah level means nothing in this game. I was in survival mode and this level 15 was begging for me to come at him, I did and he was indestructible. At level 15 he already had whatever he needed to be unkillable . He just stood there and emoted thumbs up while I tried everything in the book. He was testing his build on me. Since then I'm wary of all levels lol
---
I used this all the time when the camera first came out. You could strategically fling yourself all over the map without killing yourself, but it would often make the game crash
---
Please let me put calibrated shocks on my socks.
---
Could you clarify? What is shown on the map or floats above your char in the game?  I thought you had character name, such as on the ID card, and user name which is everything else (map, floats etc)
---
I see what you did there
---
I'm located on the cliffs to the east of Whitesprings. The view is glorious every time it gets nuked.
---
He should try making videos about things he enjoys doing rather than repeatedly sharing his perpetual disgruntlement.
---
No they don't... the scoreboard can't go away unless they replace it with a way to find fights. The only way to consistently find them now is to scour the map for death bags or go kill all the ranked players to become number 1 and hope they come to you.
---
What did you sell for 15k ? Once I hit over 20k I buy .45 ammo or serums that are below 300 caps.
---
All non believers will be cleansed in Atoms loving glow
---
The display name is what EVERYONE sees, in game, on the map, on the friends list, and all that. Your character name only shows up on the character screen to help you remember what character is what. The account name is only relevant as it’s your login information.
---
He does, some games are actually good on release. He even acknowledges things are good that he doesn't enjoy, such as Sekiro.
---
It doesn't happen organically except on rare occasions. There's a big PVP fan base that want to find one another.
---
Metal supports are breakable, so never survive!
---
Wow and I thought I had problems with the Kingdom of Gadlantis. You win buddy, so far every asshole I have met has not been a cyberstalker. Lucky, me

Got it, was confused thinking that my character name actually showed to people. Thanks

---
I think it's hilarious when my insanely buff tattooed bearded character runs around in a glittery red dress.
---
And seems like three-quarters or more of player vendors do that. WTH?
---
I leave stuff there often.
---
Unwanted plans/ammo/junk.
---
And thanks for sharing this diary post with us...
---
That's pretty frustrating.
---
Sometimes people will leave items for other people in random station boxes. I know I do.
---
Lol. They meant to put it there man. People often put their excess junk, ammo, etc for people to find when they visit the train stations. I do it all the time.
---
They approved the product, they allowed their names, licenses, and brand to be shoved on a subpar product regardless which can and will directly reflect on the value of the brand and company. 
---
This is why Nintendo and a lot of other companies have a history of being hyper selective who can use their licenses.
---
PC.
---
You do realize there are more players of fallout 4 today than there are of people playing fo76 right? So a 5 year old single player game has more active daily players than this current online game has.
---
I don't know if I'd call that "a LOT of people" playing.
---
What weapon are you using? Improvised weapons like deathclaw gauntlets don't count, swords and axes etc do.
---
Is available for a limited time at a time.
---
Been there myself.
---
Everyone can be fooled once, just don't let it be twice and it will be on them.
---
/r/thatHappened
---
Virtually no one wants you to spend 25k at their vending machine, anyhow. How many people you think are playing with 0 caps in their pocket? Also, no one spends 25k at a single vending machine. Just doesn't happen, unless they're an idiot. Quality weapons trades aren't done through vending, and anything else is overpriced. If you're telling me you're buying 25k of junk and aid, I'm telling you you're lying.
---
Find the trick or treater near Dyer chemical. You have to server hop sometimes to find her. There's an intersection near Dyer and there's a spawn point there. You find the trick or treater in the road, she has the halloween witch costume plans. For a little cloth and plastic you can make witches costumes to sell. With high charisma (grape mentats /beer /sweet rolls etc help) you can get 47 caps per outfit.
---
Also, the asylum has straight jackets. They sell high too
---
Used to impulse-buy many limited time stuff. Ain't happening no more since there's no point. Glad I didn't buy all of the 4 horseman PA skins. I know they will return someday
---
Limited time only =/= one time only.
---
Never seen that BOS graveyard! Awesome
---
Uh, it was intentional? people often leave items at the train stations because they have a vendor and high traffic.
---
I save up my .38 ammo and find noobs down in flatwoods, the heart emojis they give me when they see I'm not trying to kill them but giving them 2-300 rounds of ammo brings a smile to my heart. You go shoot the shit out of those robots young level 3, and good luck to you, you're gonna need it 🤣
---
Your playing the wrong game for death match.. Best i could suggest is that you guys find a place thats known.. Make a place known for constant pvp.
---
I have had real issues with stairs in my building. It will not let me put a ceiling above them. So the spots where my stairs go to the second floor and third floor have holes above them because I cannot put a roof or an upper floor tile. I have attempted to cheese this out with walling the above tile off but it will not let me fix it.
---
And here I thought they made a mistake... And I did not want to profit from their mistake.
---
Could be a good Faschnacht type of event
---
Some people have overpriced items just so that it looks like they have more stuff of interest when people browse the map. I mainly sell chems, serums, flux, some other junk, and fusion cores, but someone tipped me to the notion of having a piece of armor and a weapon in there, just to pique interest from afar, but have them overpriced, so no one actually buys them. Someone shows up to see what armor I have, but buys my serums instead.
---
That said, this morning I came across a dude selling various 1-star bloodied melee stuff for 4000+. I think he genuinely thought he could get the caps.
---
New to the game, I juked myself apparently.
---
Kinda, sometimes when there is challenge to level up while wearing Asylum outfit my guy also looks like drag queen :)
---
I could easily say you're playing the wrong mode. You play it your way and I'll play it mine. Also, there are a lot more people like me that enjoy the PVP and really have no desire to grief in adventure.
---
Instigating is OK. Bloodied is decent when used right. Furious is solid in a handmade, or anything else with a decent rate of single shot fire, or some melee weapons.
---
People in PA are extremely vulnerable, just sayin
---
No you couldnt. Were playing survival... You want to play pubg
---
Yup. Had the same problem. I jumped out of my power armor and it worked. Have to be out of your power armor to complete the event.
---
Now you know. If you find junk, ammo, grenades, plans just sitting inside a train station container. It's for whoever wants to take it
---
I leave excess items in the Flatwoods Church Overseer’s Stash Box.  Figure it might be a cool surprise for a new player. 
---
Hell, I wish there was one right outside of Vault 76. New player walks out and has a bunch of plans and stims and ammo right at the start.
---
There are too many people in survival who just want to spawn camp. It's so boring. And lazy.
---
Omly when your a top jumping squirl with 3 star weapons for a build.. When your little fish the jumper is a 2 shot.. The PA is a 7+ 😬
---
I've long since grown bored with CoD and PubG and Apex Legend and Fortnite are silly. I like PVP in this game now that PVE has grown boring.
---
I see it was on for 14 days. That should give you some time. 👍👍
---
I got the blackbird paint, but that's because I hadn't seen it and it looks sick. I don't care about availability
---
Yeah blue suit cases are a unofficial free box. Mostly things like missiles. I normally leave 5mm and propaganda flyers.
---
I know.. Just like the ppl who play dayz and never leave cherno.. Looked down upon by the whole community.. But you know thats where they do thier thing so you stay away☺
---
Life taught me that.
---
Really grind all the challenges, they're not too hard to do with friends
---
Fricking edgelord
---
Are you talking about the non playable mutants... or the players who run around with more mutations the anyone.. haha sorry I didnt read everything... still upvoted ya
---
Agreed, I really like their voicelines, also scorcheds, as they bring life into the game
---
Super Mutants
---
Yo PC brother! There are a ton of us who play in several loosely-knit circles of friends and acquaintances. We're in eastern Europe, western Europe, and all over the US, so we have a pretty wide range of active hours. Feel free to add me, I can get you hooked in. IGN: andrewbadera
---
(Most of us are fairly high level, but a) we don't mind helping new players out, and, b) sometimes we spin up an alt our selves that needs leveling.)
---
I know 2 weeks. But some challenges really hard now a days.
---
Oh I know.. I was just being an ass..
---
Us high level players do that all the time to get rid of unwanted items and leave them for others that might want them.
---
!remindme 6 hours
---
My best advice for people looking for the camera is to go to each location instead of server hopping. It’ll take around 200 caps (probably more or less idk) but it was worth it in my opinion. Server hopping just isn’t reliable.
---
What about drinking 25 different alcohol beverages? Each of them have to be different.
---
And in Biv's case, a cyborg, albeit one with very little meat left on him.
---
remindme! 6 hours
---
If I was to have all of them it would break my build completely.
---
But yes they did do a great job with the mutants.. I like when they dont see you and watch or lisen to what they say and do... I agree
---
There are many more challenges other than dailies and weeklies. Try farming those
---
Start buying at vendors, do but dailies, and brew

A perk should not be necessary for this. Bethesda should just make a “loot all corpses in area” command.
---
I know but many people go for all 18 anyways
---
You could take him lol
---
Hell if i was you i would claim white springs... You know regular ass survivors are going to come that way. Piss ppl off and become known as no mans land.
---
Ill brave in for a quick snipe on a raider then be on my way☺
---
This would really help open the map up to building in more locations for me...I've been stuck in Whitesprings because I can't quite give up the safety of it. Other builds I've done outside get smashed too often or spawn scorchbeasts which are just not worth fighting so I end up server hopping a bunch. :/
---
I'm not asking for respawn/die/rinse/repeat like Cod and I can live with starting over and losing legendary weapons and armor. What I can't live with is going 3 hours without finding someone else to fight.
---
Don't watch Yong.
---
So much server hoping..
---
Im kinda surprised they didn't limit them,  if only to be able to have the limit scale after 50. Give us a little more progression.
---
Watching youtubers has got to be the biggest waste of time I can think of. 
---
 They are only there for the young sheeple who don't understand how to think for themselves.
---
The top hat has dropped in price, that marine tactical helmet you're doing is the easier way now. 
---
Of course, when you can buy one Serum plan, all you have to do is sell 3 serums to the vendors in one day, it's basically easy mode.
---
Then... Survival is not ever going to be your game. No matter the game. You can hope for that br ppl are talking about.
---
I'm there most of the time but usually not right at the station. I think most people believe spawn camping is still a thing when in reality it's now the other way around. Spawn immunity provides a huge opportunity to kill someone before they have a chance to kill you. Maybe the solution is to have a reason to fight eg; holding something that is worth resources.
---
We used to be able to get 60 a day.. now I'm down to 20 to 40
---
Bethesda ideally wants stash to be infinite. The restrictions are required for server stability.
---
Already did most of them.
---
The keycard is hiding in plain sight. Had my friend not already found it I might have missed it
---
I think it can be, look at all the people asking for faction PVP? That solves a ton of these issues.
---
Wait biv sells alcohol beverages?
---
I dont know about this spawn immunity.. Never been the case when i fast travel. But your right. Trains are fairly safe this last week.
---
Is there a filter on this photo? Looks like sepia
---
I don’t know many people with every mutation. Also if you have every mutation it’s kind of pointless, some you definitely don’t want in certain builds. But if they think having all mutations helps them out in some way why not let them keep them? Don’t I don’t see how that affects you, me or anyone else.
---
You realize the McRib is a limited time item and it comes back all the time. I think you misunderstood what limited time means.
---
Yeah. Why did Bethesda have to make them harder. Instead of leveling up once and getting 10 atoms you have to do 3 other things while you leveled up.
---
Did you know that golf clubs also give plastic? And steel and rubber. The shopping baskets also give plastic
---
Four times in the last week it has reset the stock in both of my characters, at different times. My stash is very rarely at 800 max.
---
Normally I do a scrap run and then scrap the lot and change it to bulk packs, I sell cheap and it moves out of stock quick.
---
It has happened on both my melee character and ranged one, I wish there was a way to type prices not the crazy slider.
---
The slider is a huge headache to use. This is stressing as it takes a long time to reset the prices indeed.
---
Are there really that many spawn campers? It's not something I encounter very often at all.
---
Wont ever work in a game that's 24/7 spawn camping is just too real. Youd have to work the whole thing so ppl start at the same time. Team or solo. You absoulty cant have ppl camping where ppl spawn or its down the tubes instantly.
---
If you don't load into the game at a train station and just spawn in without a weapon out you have 30(ish) seconds where you don't take damage. That's long enough to get out of range, prep and move back in to fight. If someone is on top of the station just rush without a gun out so they can't VATS, get close, kill. Then get the hell away before they do it to you.
---
If you haven't cleared out your weapon type/creature type kill challenges those are very lucrative.  Ie "kill 76 scorched with a blunt weapon" etc.  The 76 count ones are 40 a piece and you can quickly do these in the lower level zones if you're in a hurry.
---
Also, dont hold me to this, but by reintroducing multiple previously "limited time" items in the last few weeks its shown us "limited time" doesnt mean gone forever just gone until they need another influx of cash.  If you dont hit the deadline you should see it again in a few months so dont panic =)
---
Vary the spawn points.
---
They *clunk* added backpacks *clunk, clunk*, for *clunk*, those *clunk, clunk* who really *clunk, clunk, clunk* don't *clunk* like *clunk* wearing *clunk, clunk* power armor. 
---
:)
---
Right.. sell and earn 760 worth of caps in any one AREA of the map... kill 76 scortch with EACH of the weapon types...
---
Kids.
---
  OTOH, some of the most polite and thankful players I've run across have been in that age bracket.
---
Its not even enough time for ppl to pip boy eat food/water decide on thier plan. 100% no map markers is the only way to go in an open map
---
Dayum good luck bro. Gotta grind really hard since about half of dailies are really difficult to complete nowadays. Or you can just go and grind some real money
---
Yeah I can stand inside the bus when 5 grenades go off. No problem
---
I am interested in seeing other peoples views on things. Also some youtubers have been covering various important topics recently, such as the crunch on employees being forced to work 80 hours a week on games, and more and more cases of abuse from their employers. 
---
Bringing to light things like that are never a waste of time.
---
For the record, this is exactly the kind of discussion Bethesda needs to see.
---
Any combo of an Alien Blaster id be happy
---
You limit yourself. Why would a melee build use eagle eyes? Or a sniper build use twisted muscles.
---
They are designed so that you don't take all of them. And if you do then that's your own fault.
---
They added lots of stuff.
---
There is this cool Google thing that they have where you can actually look up the website and find all the information you would need there.
---
I currently have my bag and helmut sat on my window seal on display, with just the west tec logo from the bag poking out undernesth the helmut, i didnt even notice the change in bags but hey ho, i got 500 atoms for free and am getting a second bag
---
I mainly wish with regards to .308 and 10mm that we could mass produce them on the level that we can .50 and 5mm. I also wish Guerilla in Agility counted for all Submachine guns but that's just me wanting things to make sense.
---
I'd rather just read the article that they are using to make their video. I don't need some kid telling me their opinion on the subject when I could read it and make my own.
---
I had my first big camp in Morgantown. That came on every time I fast traveled or logged it. It was the #1 reason I moved.
---
I would say get of your adrenaline and glow sight perks. They are both decent perks, however your bloodied character is would benefit from the Barbarian perk under strength. I would also try to fit adamantium skeleton into your endurabc perks. It’s reduced limb damage, which is super helpful.
---
I prep at my base, drop junk and keep enough aid to keep me going. I tune my AP and off I go.
---
Im cool with it.. Just seems most ppl want a little spice in thier boring adventure.. Not to be hunted down on a map by a guy who leaps on top of buildings. That run in is exciting when it happens naturally. Not when its like Ro2 1 tap at spawn cause your commander wont move. Lol
---
I feel your pain..I've returned to my camp at White spring and been left with just a wooden frame and sod all else.
---
Not going to read all that right now.. I shall save it though... but the quick idea is that is almost like the scout badges.. but with RobCo??
---
Samsquanch
---
Love this ider, you are almost handing it on a plate to Bethesda, lest hope they pick it up :)
---
Yeah. But blackbird is a awesome skin. I don’t think they’re going to bring it back for a while tbh. Remember this was only a at launch skin that not many people got because it was out for only one day and costed 1800 atoms. But now they brought it back due to such a demand. However the Only thing I’m a little bit disappointed with is that it’s 1800 atoms. I thought it was going to be discounted for 1400 like any other normal power armor skin.
---
I’m not giving Bethesda more money lol. If I buy more they get greedy more.
---
I've thought the same thing. My idea was to allow as many mutations as you have endurance points.
---
Prepare for downvotes.
---
Well if its faction.. For one. No trains no bases you get 5 spawns on your side of the map
---
Great Post, well written and entertaining, thanks.
---
I'm sorry for your loss, but the person launching Nukes may have just been trying other locations, a few months ago myself and a few friends launched around 20 or so Nukes in one day, just testing locations that we didn't normally see Nuked, and I got some Hate mail for it.
---
I get that the leader boards aren't working. I hunted down the level 1 last night and he was level 28. I still killed him but left his bag alone because all I really wanted was his points. I'm sure he didn't want to be hunted down and honestly I didn't want to kill a level someone 1/4 my level. All I'm saying is that if you remove them, put something else in it's place to encourage conflict. I would even fine with it going back to most kills.
---
That works.
---
I see, you are not interested in what others think, much less young sheeple or some kid. 
---
So what are your views on how Fallout 76 has been handled? From the rocky launch through to the constant lies for the game and its false advertising of its merchandise?
---
I got rid of all of my mutations when vending machines came out and only bought the ones i want. I did have most of them before
---
Be best if we could get rid of vats/mutations/and stealth. You move like a human from the vault and its skill no auto aim.
---
Yes and no, it has quests yes, but you unlock a HUB for your camp where you can create a robot, and different robots so different things. 
---
Some roam your camp, others follow you and lend a hand in a fight if you need it and some you can summon to fight for you, or summon a Workbench or stash to your location to use. 
---
The radio also lets you fast travel to places you set, including your camp by simply pressing the radio and pressing "My CAMP"
---
I played F76 for about 300 hours. I meet this robot like 3 times.
---
yeah, but on PC it is :--(
---
How do you get your pictures to show up on top of the post sorry I'm kinda new here to Reddit
---
I guess you are kinda right in that regard. I am just always kinda thrown off by what you do when you are completing missions for them. Like when you protect that little eyebot as it repairs military radio installations to set up the scorched detection network.
---
I'm assuming you don't use VATS? You're pretty solid if so.
---
If you plan on using VATS, you might consider dropping 1 rank of Glowing Sight for Concentrated Fire in PER. You'll be able to cripple limbs and headshot for more dmg. Dropping 1 rank of thru hiker for 1☆ Gun Fu, will auto select the next available target in VATS. Makes it easier to deal with incoming mobs, as you can just run a string of headshots.
---
Ahh I see.. I read alittle further... it's a workable idea that for sure
---
Man, I wish he had gotten more love. The imposter quest was pretty damned good, I was hoping that there would be a second part about the actual sheepsquatch, not to just have him randomly plopped in almost entirely unannounced. 
---
I also really want to find out why they aren't apex predators 175 years in the future, it absolutely skull fucks deathclaws.
---
Eep! Pervert!
---
Yeah, I’m highly suspicious of the factuality of this post. There’s a lot of /thathappened and /iamverybadass to it.
---
Thanks, I'm going to work on what you can turn the Token in to get now. 
---
I was thinking Junk, Ammo and also some Unique Plans like the Taxidermy ones, but with robot heads instead of animals and incests, and a plan for Power Armour Torso's that increases how long Fusion Cores last by 30%, but doesn't stack with the Perk.
---
He had an "accident" several times after he ran up yelling at me while I was sneaking into a Supermutant encampment.   :(
---
For now I have 3 (healing factor, marsup, speed demon). I am thinking to get one of the food one, but thats all.
---
No. What's the point in getting it if you don't have it visible?  
---
Oh, and by the way, the new Corvega backpack (Atom Store) looks amazing.  
---
(I know because I have one!)
---
I disagree with this, at least in regards to adrenaline. I too run a low health rifleman and adrenaline is great for mobs of enemies. If anything, I'd say get yourself a piece or two of powered armor and ditch the thru hiker and action boy/girl perks and dump those 6 points into the rest of adrenaline and 1 point of gun fu. If you want better carry weight, just use the regular backpack instead of the armored one which yes has better dmg resistance but lowers your carry weight by 30 lbs.
---
Just store them to your Live, transfer them to One Drive. Drag and drop to Computer...sure it not easy but I have 100+ photos and I play console.
---
That is the longest post ever. You had me at Mr Handy.
---
Good for SBQ. Probably not regular play. I believe everyone else is doing extra damage, not just you.
---
I have Tenderizer1 equipped.  I just accept the stated 5% on the card.  Haven't tested to see if it really makes a difference, but it certainly doesn't hurt.
---
Don't tell me, I'm on PC
---
Same thing can happen when I play Rocket League. I don’t even humour them, I just leave. It’s nothing against the kids but the tone of conversation is usually all over the place and screeching can be unbearable so why put yourself through that headache.
---
Yeah. They seem to like to kill each other over and over again until someone else shows up
---
Actually, I just replied to a player in a different post who stated he/she was a sniper build and used twisted muscles... which I questioned and he/she eventually explained.
---
Apparently it makes sense to use for some sniper players...

At least wave at them after you do it.   
---
I usually jump up on top of a train station and wait for people...

Barbarian would only give him 10 DR/ER at the cost of DPS. You're better off making sure everything is dead before it gets to you. Same thing with Admantium Skel, popping a diluted stimpack removes any cripples, without having to burn 3 perk points.
---
Sorry it's so long, there is a Tl;DR for some of it. 
---
Basically get Robots to do stuff for you like protect your camp, come to your aid or drop things like a Workbench off at your location (with cooldowns) and also a Radio the can be used for setting fast travel markets down and using it to quickly fast travel to places like your own camp or where you've set a marker, instead of having to go into the map, and then scroll to find where you want to go, or where a friends base is.
---
What kind of errors/crashes are you getting? Is the game itself crashing and if so how?
---
Are you getting blue screens of death? If so what's the error code say that pop up near the bottom of the blue screen?
---
Ah hit reply to wrong post 😛
---
I like that my base can be attacked, it adds immersion, the feeling of an hostile environment and a purpose to my turrets. I agree that pyramid Camps are horrible though, they shouldn't be allowed but at the same time placing objects should be simpler as often pyramids are used to quickly dispose the CAMP on a difficult terrain.
---

this is what I used to figure out what I wanted. I hope it helps.

---
I understand this, but outside of the lore, it is endgame armor, it should at least beat is precursor in ballistic, if it is going to be good ballistic, but there are armors better, why bother wearing/adding the armor in the game.  It's easily the hardest to obtain by yourself, and at level 50.  they should at least increase its level or something, same goes for the rest of the Ulracite weapons.
---
I had instigating and +50% limb damage Railway Rifles, they were just great. If I had one with both in 76 I'd be so happy
---
All good points.  I rocked a 1* instigating through something like lvl 80.  I could 1 shot almost everything in the game which is why I say it's worth more than 1k.
---
Buffs. Dog food doesn't give +20 carry weight like grilled radstag does or +3 SPECIAL like Scorchbeast parts do.
---
I do.. haha I find groups of people... say nothing on mic.. no emotes.. walk up WHILE they are fighting.. take some pics then fast travel away.. haha maybe that's why I feel so.. dirty
---
i agree with this, i run excavator/t-51b
---
If you server hopped for it you were just wasting time imo, besides you did it way back on the release of the camera. Now that every spawn location is known, it's better to just fast travel to every location.
---
I've had very little troubles with playing the actual game itself. I have played since Beta every day. There were some small hiccups that bothered me in the beginning but just like any game that gets released nowadays there's going to be hiccups and bugs. I'm not the type of person that will cry, whine and freak out because I know they will eventually be fixed.  The technology is far more complicated these days with these new games to get it absolutely perfect on release.
---
 So as far as the game itself I am absolutely in love with it.  I have a lot of fun every time I turn it on and play which is the most important thing for me.  Just like any game of its kind it gets better and better every new update.
---
Now as for the merchandise with the canvas bags and all that I think they really dropped the ball with handling those issues.  If I was one of those bag recipients I would be fuming because of the false advertisement. 
---
I am not a bag recipient and I was still angry at the way everything was handled. 
---
As for the constant lies I am not sure what you are referring to as I don't pay too much attention to what developers have to say after the no man's sky fiasco.
---
 They are just trying to promote a game that they are passionate for and care deeply about.
---
 I do wish they would go about it a different way and not lie though.
---
 Like I said I'm not one to cry, wine and pout because things don't go my way.  I don't dwell in the past and keep bringing up things that went wrong in the past. 
---
 I'm more of a how is it right now and how is it going to be in the future type a guy.
---
I will on occasion leave a bag with Fertilizer and an I.O.U. Toilet Paper note, if I have a reason to do so.
---
Helped a couple of low-level players complete the Quest this morning.  No Rewards . . . not even acknowledgement that the Quest was finished.  :(
---
How did last week treat you? Lakeside cabin took me 3+hrs cause of 3 to 4 ppl holding it down.
---
Day later im under lvld i. The bog looking for some quest i can finish and its a war outside of watoga.
---
I think the missions to get the free weapon really made survival great. It was hard to do.. And on the other side if i just wanted to explore i knew i was safeish. Even had a stand off then emotes and me and dude teamed up to get the final part done. Was the best iv ever had in survival and it was all due to the mission layout.
---
Yeah, I took a picture of some people at the purveyor's den and they turned around to look at me. I just ran off quickly. I'm wearing some gear specifically to check off people's challenges for this, but I feel like some people probably don't care to check this challenge and won't understand why people are doing that
---
It just makes me feel like Dala from the OWB dlc
---
[Drama Queen](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Drama%20Queen)...
---
Check your regular challenges. Unless you already did this before, there are likely some easy atoms that you wouldn't normally get but that won't take you long. Scrapping 76 power armor parts, scrapping 76 clothes/hats, killing certain enemies with certain weapons, etc
---
I think yall should only be able to have 1 at a time.. YALL DIRTY MUTANT FREAKS
---
When the camera was just released I used to run fullspeed up to random players, take their picture and run away screaming (scared emote). Fun times...
---
Also in Fallout 76, X-01 hands down the best power armor to wear for protection, I like that they balanced them out more, But his is the hardest to obtain, from a game standpoint outside of lore, it should be better, or atleast a quest line you can do to make it better.
---
That would disproportionately benefit melee builds, who already have stat dmg scaling, weapon reduction, and the best armor piercing.
---
Unfortunately I did a lot of them. Still have some but in my book they’re really hard to do or atleast require a lot of time to do.
---
Nothing to see here. Say goodbye was right.
---
Why sell legendarys either. Scrip comes in handy too.....
---
My alt was working a 1\* instigating until recently, when I traded for a 3\*\*\* bloodied and a 3\*\*\* furious using caps off my main. Leveling that alt with the 1\* instigating was soooo much easier than the mostly non-legendary childhood my main had.
---
They actually had them in the B.E.T.A you can see it in this video
---
https://youtu.be/mvkofYrhPcY?t=405
---
Problem is, people abused the hell out of it, they would put it right off the edges of cliffs so people would just fall to their deaths, they would put it in pits of spikes and other traps, they would put it in places people couldn't get out of so they'd be stuck
---
So they just scrapped it.
---
I've been scouring reddit for some form of concrete information but I've had no success running the ash heap events either, I run full unyielding armor as well so my stats are about as high as they can get.
---
I've completed a P.A and H.Weapon build as well......

---
I got community feed back previously and changed a few things. I downgraded Tenderizer from 3\* to 1\* - freed-up 2 points in Char to place in Endurance. Basically for a loss of 2% in Tenderizer I gained more Endurance. Refractor is there for endgame stuff and going around smacking up Assaultrons in Watoga etc. Adrenaline is a damn good perk to get rocking imo. Bandolier I've left at 1\* as I can fast travel to base and craft more ammo when needed and a 45% reduction in weight ain't nothing to be sniffed at a pinch. I'll be carrying over lvl 45/50 heavy weapons from my current build as I like the ones I've currently got :)
---
I wanted to say USEFUL legendaries, but that’s subjective.
---
You could do that in fallout 4. I had built a huge house with several sets of PA on display
---
Yes. They are coming. Todd personally ordered a nice mat for our camps. Just like the canvass bag. It will take some time to make. Let say 6 months.
---
You have more patience than I do.  Whenever this happens (and it happens entirely too much for a game like this), I instantly leave, and block them all from their XB1 profiles.
---
Yes I agree. So annoying fast travelling to someone’s camp for a load of stuff you can pick up anywhere. Same with recipes apart from those that you get from events etc. I know that there’s low level players that maybe want a gun that’s got all the mods but yes stay in Flatwoods not right near Watoga.
---
4K for a 1 star anything is insane 
---
Almost as bad as a person I saw selling purified water for 20 each
---
It’s south of Huntersville. Fast travel to the mountain icon to the right (I forget the name off the top of my head. Something peak), and follow the road towards Huntersville. It’ll be on your right.
---
I’ll click the like button on this. It’s that “awe really?” moment for me when I fast travel to a player vending machine to learn that the 27 pieces of armor are nothing more than regular non legendary armor or clothing outfits.
---
Bethesda needs to make categories designating a piece of armor as armor and clothing as simply apparel. That would save me sooo many caps wasted on fast travel fees.
---
No, but he unlocks recipes for you to craft more of them
---
Or whitespring! Lol
---
\^This I feel it would make for a more involved endgame and make sure these items were rare and truly epic.
---
I loved looking at my many sets of power armor on display in my base in Fallout 4. 
---
Now with all the many paint schemes and armor configurations I’d love to have them on display for a quick jump in and go approach and to show off my fave, Nukashine paint for the XO1!
---
Oh. How much they do for?
---
Seriously. But really? Why keep it? All the stuff I “learned” was from scrapping EVERYTHING.
---
Same here, I had several sets, I made an elevator just so I could dedicate a whole floor to displaying them, had a mod that gave me big daddy (bioshock) looking power armor, that was nice to be able to display them, be nice if it took up camp space or something instead of keeping in the storage box.
---
Lol yeah camped on the green with their 1 turret and spikes.
---
I will say my first and most frequent kill is on a bloodied build... Those guys melt to a pipe rifle... Or a landmine haha.
---
Not yet
---
PvP is kind of pointless when there aren’t any real consequences for dying or reward for killing.
---
If someone thinks a 1 star anything is worth 4K then my 3 star bloodied auto handmade is probably worth 100K
---
I mean cmon now get real 
---
I have a 1 star vampire auto handmade w/larger magazine and suppressor and while I’m not interested in selling it there is no way I’d charge 4K for it and it’s a great weapon
---
Shit, I gave away a 2 shot auto handmade and a 3 star mutant Gatling plasma to a lvl 20 guy last night for nothing.  Trying to help a brother out.
---
So maybe the icon preview could show legendary armor and legendary weapons as headings to distinguish from normal.
---
(And yes, apparel and armor need to be separated)
---
\&gt; Excavator is bs for fighting 
---
Can't say I agree. 
---
I've been in excavator full time since L47 (now L96).  
---
I normally run solo, and melee nearly everything except SBs that don't land, or don't land within easy reach range.
---
The only thing that has give me a problem so far have been the high level assaultrons in Atlas observatory, and a 6+ angler swarm @ a defend the workshop event in the Bog.
---
I guess they are there early  on because they want to level up quick. But seriously guy, you don’t necessarily need a vending machine.
---
Dude you're helping no one. Check your reading comp skills. No one in this thread is justifying 4K for a 1\*. Go find a new place to proselytize, thanks.
---
I want an Ironman camp
---
Sometimes I'll hangout in my underwear , outside someones house and take pictures through their windows.
---
Agreed! That ability to mod your own gear with the greatest of misc choices is priceless... especially when your trusted gaming buds aren’t online to assist.
---
Also Grahm selling 1-2 deathclaw hides
---
All I can say is you are not the only one with this issue. 
---
Carrying select stash for the miner miracles quest last evening, get killed, zero places (again ZERO) to respawn to. No other choice but to log out. Hop back in and all select previously saved stash to work through the quest has evaporated. No bag left behind just nothing. Not the first time this has happened either and this is just flat out frustrating. If I’m doing something wrong then bad on me. But when you get killed and can’t respawn because the map has zero landmarks available to select, to me this is a serious bug.
---
He had little to much radiation
---
I just kinda think it’s overused. Haven’t used a tse since i sold one of my tse dragons (or dragoon I forgot)
---
Caps are pretty easy to get.  I sell them for 550 each all day long.
---
My prices aren't the best, but supply and demand reign in Appalachia.  :)
---
So you'll be more likely to buy atoms.

Jonesing? WTF?

---
Still sounds stupid.
---
Yeah I know that but just..... why?
---
Nice, thanks
---
I got mine from the sheepsquatch event in the savage divide. Where it ends is a small shed, it spawns a number of different plans but ones a raider under armour upgrade

They can’t even get the current assortment of guns to work properly... and you want more?

Too

My camp was nuked 3 times on one server
---
The first place a new player is going to go is the overseer's camp.  That is were I leave stuff for new players.
---
This is the problem I have
---
I’m lvl 199.  I’ve got 2 decent armor sets and several excellent 3 star legendary weapons. I have all the serums I need.  I’m also not a uniform or plan or hat collector.  So I have no need or desire to shop for a lot of the gear for sale. 
---
These days I’m mostly shopping for meds or chems or bobble heads or (at times) ammo but I have a shitload of that stuff as well. 
---
Bethesda needs to allow for more things to buy and sell because I have a feeling a lot of higher level players have little use for most of what people are selling.
---
Allow us to sell or trade perk cards.  Or a XP bonus item (similar to bobble heads).  That would be a start.
---
I cooked them for the next 20 minutes
---
There is a good one in fo4s promo pics on steam.
---
That's the reason. Because they want your money.
---
Edit: I also leave stuff in the blue suite cases.
---
I don't mind them selling that stuff that will probly never ever sell.  Most are probably fairly new to the game and don't really understand the ins and outs of the game yet.
---
 Now if there was some kind of way to differentiate between vendors that have legendaries and vendors that are selling Commons that would be ideal.
---
I spent 3800 on a one star bloodied LMG yesterday. It's definitely the high end of what I'm willing to pay but that thing was worth it. Completely shreds everything.
---
I sell all types of equipment to all types of players. There are more players than just the level 150+ ones looking for perfect 3*s 
---
Just depends on what you goal is at your vendor. I will say, it’s annoying when the super high level individuals have fuck all at their CAMP. Why even set up a CAMP south of Watoga if you’re only gonna sell crap above market value? Probably just for the lulz, I guess.
---
I think I ride a fine line with this. I usually have a handful of three star legendary weapons and armor, but I do stock non legendaries. That said they're stuff like the bear arms, sheepsquatch weapons with mods, and I sell those cheap. I also sell a lot of aid and outfits, but they're cheap food or serums, and now rare outfits like the clean versions and hard to find asylum worker uniforms. I think that's pretty acceptable. I've been super annoyed traveling to others' camps and finding out that their 2000 junk is all asbestos or all their meds are easily found ones with no serums in sight.
---
I don't have any thoughts on it since I decided to cut out unnecessary negativity in my life  on outlets like these.
---
Thanks for the tips... The fireproof is there to protect me from the SB spam attacks seems to help pretty good, i need the blocker because i don\`t pay enough attention sometimes. 
---
I\`m looking in to armor with weight reduction on it.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed comment. As I said before, I am curious to others opinions, as they can shed light on things I haven't picked up on or noticed.
---
I am also glad you still enjoy the game. May I ask, after all the hours you have in the game, what would you say you enjoyed the most with the game? For me, as silly as it is, I really enjoyed the photo mode. Disregarding some of the sillier emotes, some of the pictures you can take in locations look like concept art, and I found myself trying to get good photos of every "milestone" in the game.
---
Silly I know, but it really worked with some of the locales.
---
I wasn't playing when they introduced that camera. Is there a quest to get it?
---
This should help you. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b37ybg/a_complete_list_of_all_apparel_in_fo76_outfits/
---
I\`m going to try it, just swapped out Concentraded Fire for the Glow sight, only have a Rank 3.
---
They are always flying around my substation camp north of Watoga.
---
Run a big circle around Watoga.
---
I started going for all of them just so I could say that I did. But it wrecked my build and made it unenjoyable until I could wipe them and start fresh. Now I keep it at I think 5. Marsupial, Bird Bones, Speed Demon, Healing Factor and Herd Mentality if I remember correctly.
---
Unyielding armor, lone wanderer, nerd rage, damage cards, incisor, martial artist, serendipity
---
Basic pillars for bloodied melee. Go forth and try not to die
---
This is how I play almost 25% of the time. I've switched the R2L2 to R1L1 and vice versa. I most do scavenging in this mode because when there's more than a few players in the area and two of them have explosive guns it gets a little laggy. I also play Elder Scrolls Online like this.
---
I'm building a mad scientist myself right now, focusing on non VATS auto-energy pistols and explosives.  Dense chest + Fireproof and Adamantium Skeleton to fight off my own explosives.  Eventually all guerrilla perks and max adrenaline, max demo-expert, bloody mess.  Speed demon will be needed eventually - and probably egghead for flavor.  Two ranks of grenadier and one rank of fire in the hole under perception.  I'm at lvl 24 on it now and it's a lot of fun - completely different game play experience from my stealth VATS sniper "Hunter" build.
---
I’m not talking about outfits at all. I sell outfits too. Rare and otherwise? It’s the weapons and armor that can be found literally everywhere (and crafted by most people) and people are putting them in their machines and slapping a price on them. New players, I can understand. But anybody, really, over level 50? Doesn’t make sense to me.
---
I found one in the green lockers at the waterpark
---
what platform are you on? My camp is pretty different. Then again all my camps are
---
Yeah I used that one for inspiration. However, Bethesda made it more difficult because you are limited to 50 lights so I used like 45 light boxes and the rest I used for lighting in other parts for my C.A.M.P. 
---
Would love if Bethesda could increase to limit of lights so that I can more accurately recreate the light box Vault Boys in Fallout 4.
---
Class Freak reduces the negatives by 75%. It will not affect your perk card usage at all though. I don't know that egghead is ever worth getting, it just doesn't seem to do much all (I have it though). So the only thing you are losing with Eagle Eyes and Bird bones is -1str each (affects carry weight, 5 pounds per point of strength, and melee damage). Having Marsupial though, gives you an additional 20 pounds of carrying weight (counter-acting the previous str loss) and the jump is a game changer, especially for stealth builds.
---
On my stealth rifleman build I use the following mutations:
---
Eagle Eyes
---
Bird Bones
---
Marsupial
---
Carnivore
---
Healing Factor
---
Speed Demon
---
Have you seen the "REDRUM" spelled out at Torrence mansion by new gad?
---
We have a PC discord , we play every night. There's a core group always on too. Hit me up for an invite -- we are very friendly and nice and stuff
---
Jacobstown is one of my favorite Fallout locations. I guess I have a soft spot for non-human people  like non-feral ghouls and intelligent super mutants.
---
I also enjoy how much more personality they have in this game. It seems like Bethesda is moving away from making them mindless orcs, and I'm all for it.
---
useful info, thanks.
---
You used Facebook with gaming... what you expect?
---
As long as you can buy or acquire duped or OP gear it won’t matter.  You are kidding yourself if you think moving people back to 0 would level the playing field.  Not when I can go on the internet or EBay and buy that BE weapon or the ass/sent or cav armor.  
---
I got killed by a lvl 4 guy in survival a few weeks back.  When I met up with him we did some trading and dude had like 12 top tier weapons and all the fixings.  
---
It happens 
---
I enjoy survival if for no other reason than for me I play a different style in that mode.  In adventure it’s more run and gun and blow shit up w/AAE shotgun and PA but in survival it’s much more a sniper stealth build.  The only thing I wish that they allowed was us to run multiple perk builds similar to how you can blueprint your camp.
---
I'm on ps4
---
I'm sorry if you are at my camp and I log out... but I'm not going to lower my mile high club, sorry ; )
---
YOu need to say that in the post title ; )
---
This is the shit I wanted from a Fallout with online gameplay.
---
Serendipity, dodgy, and nerd rage are the key perks. Twisted muscles, adrenal reaction, and talons (if unarmed) are the key mutations (along with the ubiquitous marsupial). Bloodied will get you enough damage. The harder part is staying alive.
---
That's kinda the point of stealth
---
Soo glad to see others on the same page, I'm still using the same rifles I been using since 2015, we seriously need some new ones.
---
That worked for me! Thanks!
---
The fridge backpack mod is unlocked in game.
---
It’s not just 150+. I’m 108 and I’ve known for a while. For new players, it’s ok. Everybody wants to participate. I see that. Higher level players, 50+, when legendaries are already an intregal part of game play should know better.
---
You will come up short 500 atoms or so
---
I love seeing peoples camps. Definitely a lot of drug use on fallout lol
---
I enjoy building new and different camps. I generally redesign mine every few weeks. I've had a pirate ship built on water, a maze and a umm...fully staffed strip club lol
---
The maze didnt last long as there was a noticable decline in vending sales lol
---
If you are getting CTD’s, look in your application logs to see what the error is
---
&gt; I'm gonna be brutally honest. In my opinion, trolling is just being a dick.
---
I'm not justifying the other guy messaging his wife or anything(assuming this whole post is true) but I file this under "play stupid games, win stupid prizes".
---
hahaha
---
He's talking about a refrigerator you can place in your camp I think.
---
I have a 3 star furious LMG.  I actually busted it out yesterday and gave it some run.  In the right situations that’s a fun weapon.
---
The eyesores don't minimize anything, though. People FT'ing in bring enemy spawns when they pop in. I've had scorched and dogs and the like spawn inside of those 100 foot tall elevated things while i was going through a vendor machine.
---
Ha!  Your right, again I was a bit tipsy when I discovered it.  However, I will present one mystery to you while you are there and I hope they didn't patch it.  One of the signs on the chainlink fence there, the sign is completely different, size shape and everything depending on which side of the fence you are on.  How is this possible?  [Here's the only explanation I could find.](https://imgur.com/gallery/BwaTj)
---
So the rumours are true...
---
Probably lol.
---
How bout we all agree to sell what we want.
---
Again, goes back to what your plan is for your vendor. Right now, I have 120 slots filled at my vendor. 30% of that is reserved for the whales and the rest for everyone else. 
---
No reason why you can’t have something for everyone if you’re far enough in the game (I’m level 95 btw). 
---
I make about 4-6K in caps every day I play (I average about 2-3 hours when I log on) by following this “idea.”
---
Ok, this idea is brilliant, and seems like you have put so much effort on it, though there are some parts which need to be edited. I absolutely loved it, and if they accept this, I'd be so happy.
---
yeah, know it since release, but didnt want to take any risk. after 400h played, I think its time to.
---
Also todays pcgamer article has bethesda talking about mods and they literally say they have a top 10 most used mods list.
---
So if they had to ban text chat users I wouldnt see em making those lists and saying that those mods are a good indication of what players want into the game...xD
---
I will give you 25k caps for it and my TSE Handmade 👍
---
Rollin' in dough
---
I have something in my eye.
---
Is there a way to something similar with Xbox? If I could play 76 on my work break...
---
They are me rollin....
---
Whales? What’s that?
---
Yeah, this seems nice
---
Not bad with the limit we get.
---
I'm an 8bit artist from fo4 and was so excited when I found the lightbox plans. Then truly disappointed with how many I could place.
---
Drop item. . . Did this with a "You've been insulted" note the other day at a camp up in the far north boonies. His stock was awful for the fast travel cost, so I left him/her a present.
---
Yes my friend and it is mine, mine, all mine.
---
Once I found a lead pipe with stats like this. It was Mutant's, not mutie slayers, but it gave the other stats like this.
---
SBQ dropped it a few days ago...

I did not know about golf clubs. Thank you.
---
not enough caps in the wasteland
---
Excellent shot....
---
Wish Reddit allowed multiple photos in a post....
---
I have some great ones also, its one of my favorite things yo do when gaming.
---
Oh I guess I just didnt know notes existed.
---
Yes, however he has already established his character as an antisocial, possibly drug addled murderous old coot so his inevitable swing towards building trap bases and cannibalism will not shock whereas... 
---
yup I'm still salty about it... 
---
Sigh...
---
Oddly enough, I've been hoping a mole rat or something actually gets inside my camp and has its way with one wall in particular.  My camp/bar, The Wendigo-Go, is a brick build and I like the asthetic of using walls with holes in them instead of doors in the interior.  I'd accidentally repaired the wall and can't get it back to its destroyed state. :/

Wow awsome do you have your build planned out by any chance i was thinking something like this

What weopons is in your plan for endgame
---
thanks
---
Come visit my CAMP on PS4, name is Magness1993
---
Man, that challenge is so bugged, in a good way. It gave me credit for pics taken that were not possible- player was the wrong level, not wearing PA, etc...
---
I'm glad i got it over with the first day it was out, but, man, it's jacked up.
---
That would be kind of funny, could lead to some interesting situations.
---
Dude I cant believe you have that! I'd give my left nut for that tbh.
---
Nice thanks I'll try that out
---
I imagine it’s coming eventually. They’ve mentioned displaying items from your stash in your camp. You can see the beginning of that interface in the fermenter and camp shop. I don’t think it’s imminent though, but maybe within the next 6 months? 
---
Regardless, I have one set of each kind of power armor in my stash, ready to go.
---
put the camo paint on it, give me the chefs hat, and set me free upon an unsuspecting wasteland!
---
There was talk about reshade when the game was released and most of them were about banning users that used it.
---
You could ask Bethesda directly.
---
 For me one of my favorite things is the base building and vending.  I know the vending is fairly new but it adds so much more socialization and the game than before.  Since FO4 I have been addicted to base building.   I even liked it in fallout 3 where you could personalize your megaton house.  It adds that special personalization and connection to the world.
---
Just like all other FO games the exploration and lore reading has got to be the greatest aspect of the game for me.  Almost every area has a story to tell. It explains what happened there in the past and sometimes even what will happen in future.  I love exploring every nook and cranny of places and finding things a not so observant vault dweller wouldn't notice.
---
 There a definitely a few aspects of the game I hope will change or just get better.  I do enjoy my time playing though and am super excited for the updates to come.
---
Hi there! Perhaps the players buying your overpriced knickknacks are simply buying your stuff to spread Caps around?
---
Good luck. Sounds awesome.  Let me know if you find it works. I love flying.
---
The base building is quite good, even with them needing to keep builds small due to other peoples bases being on the map as well. There are some fantastic builds since they added the option to change server if your spot was taken. We set up along the road from Point Pleasant, like a small market before you enter the town.
---
I get GAS certificates and invoices for back dues so I pay the dues in lead...to the face...and get some lead scraps back...yeah, profit
---
It's pretty much going to be the same as any Bloodied build, except you're putting Gladiator into your Strength tree.  So, the Strength tree becomes quite tight.
---
Because the Meat Hook is a naturally weaker weapon than other Unarmeds, for it to really outshine the others, you actually need to take multiple ranks of each Gladiator card.  If you just take the first of each, which is the most efficient way, it will be comparable to a Deathclaw Gauntlet or Power Fist.  So, you're looking at a potential maximum of 9 points wrapped up in Gladiator, 3 in Iron Fist, and that leaves just 3 for something else.  Incisor, because the Meat Hook has no options for armor penetration (unlike the Power Fist), or Martial Artist (you swing faster).  For that reason, it might be wise to take Rank 2 of each Gladiator and see how it goes.
---
There's also the fact that this entire build is based on a quirk which is, in all likelihood, not supposed to be there.  Personally, I think a build around the Power Fist would be a lot more resilient.
---
Yes it is. I use it during Impostor Sheepsquatch fights and it definitely lasts 2 minutes at rank 3.
---
What this guy said :)
---
I've seen Insult-Bot about 3 times, but Prize-Bot countless times, not sure how many hours I've played, let's call it a shameful amount.
---
I totally dig it. You definitely put in some thought. Hope Bethesda takes notice.
---
I think forcing people to consider the safety of their C.A.M.P. site is a fair game play element.  There has to be some sort of challenge and problem solving involved, versus putting your C.A.M.P. wherever you want and not having to consider anything.  Also part of the game is gathering resources, so they need to give you reasons to collect wood and concrete.
---
Also making the game easier and removing an element that challenges players in order to avoid looking at unattractive camps is silly.
---
Right, but wouldn’t make the hood down the new model? Cause this pic was out a couple months ahead of the outfit. I guess they could have done it waaay before also. 
---
Plus the outfit itself already clips in the back and if you’re wearing under armor.
---
Way of the woods, Bubs
---
ok, the hunger games IS the good part. the cap farming is what is annoying.
---
Sometimes the queen and king effects stack up pretty fast. One day, a 1 second worth of sludge killed me from full health. The other day, 3 max lvl kings and my health drained a little each time. I'd think there is a bug when their effect ends up overstacking, like the integer overflow we see with junk components, and you get a -4 billion health drain.
---
I have a "No Restroom" sign right by my vendors and my stock is sub-par. 
---
I'm surprised no one has left chocolate thunder on my sheets yet.
---
I found the plan for making the witch's outfit from a spawned dead trick or treater.  It only takes a little cloth, plastic, and rubber to make one, so I continually grab as much of these three items as I can.  I equip Super Duper and craft them in bulk, then go to a train station and unload them.  With just a fully-ranked Hard Bargain perk equipped, I get 23 caps for each outfit.  This goes up if I use grape mentats or other buffs.
---
In addition to this, I also clear the enemies from every unclaimed workshop I pass, regardless of whether I want the workshop or not, since it rewards you for doing so in caps.  I also equip a fully ranked Cap Collector perk any time I find a cap stash as it always you to search a caps stash and always find extra caps.  I also kill all Grafton Monsters I come across since they always have caps on them.  To make my caps last longer, I also have Travel Agent equipped, which cuts the cost of fast travel.
---
I was walking around near the vault, when I stumbled by a camp. Then a kid started talking about his camp on the mic. He was only 8 🤣🤣 That’s the only run in that I know of with a kid that young. At least this game isn’t as bad as Fortnite..sooooo many squeaky screaming voices....
---
Yeah would be dumb not to have them in this game
---
I had the same thing happen to me. A LVL 42 was shooting me I turned around with a two shot explosive handmade. Not a single HP of damage. Switched to my grognaks axe not a single HP of damage. Pretty annoying.
---
Sure is
---
yes... I know the feeling ;)
---
I try to keep 15000 max. (I buy a lot of stuff just to test it)
---
I put a siren attached to my door so it went off when people stepped on my pressure plate.  9 times out of 10 when I got back to my base, someone went up and turned it off.  LOL.   I got the message and removed it.  Players do not like rrrrreeeeeEEEEEEEEEE!
---
You can't keep everyone happy sadly, but what parts would you edit? :) 
---
Always up for some constructive criticism.
---
I’d love to see the plasma caster again, but unfortunately energy weapons are still crap compared to ballistic. Which means the current weapon choice is even smaller! I rarely see anyone rocking an energy weapon besides the plasma gattling.
---
Cool showcase video! You still need to come check out my camp sometime soon. Out of all the ones I’ve seen in your videos, it would be the most interesting and colorful one hands down.
---
I just wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
12k caps and a romp with my gf for it
---
That is the coolest shot I have ever seen now the question is did you kill after after or did it kill you
---
i fully support this post...
---
5.56 and shotgun ammo are almost the ONLY ammo's that I see constantly moving from my machines @ 1c per. Only other that I've noticed moving consistently is 5mm.
---
Not us!
---
Sounds interesting
---
They should introduce gravity.. Watch all the eye sore CAMPS crash to the ground.
---
I disagree 100% because this is a good way to buy more raider armor to scrap. Raider armor plans are elusive so being able to craft pieces to
---
scrap in an attempt to learn mods is valuable.
---
Term used to describe players with 20,000 + caps or in real world terms people with allot of money to spend ( ex.’people who can afford Mclarens or Bugattis)
---
Super mutants whisper of the chef that serves Death that he grinds their bones to make his razorgrain flour but it’s just been whispers till now.
---
I like how solar powered you are!  While super important to any scientist build, I would recommend running with a different perk than scientist as it really only comes up when crafting - Nerd Rage is a great INT perk.  
---
As far as endgame weapons - I'm going to feel it out as I go.  I think that Quad or Furious would be great for the first star; limb damage, increased fire rate, or 10% aim damage for the second; and move faster while aiming or damage resistance while aiming would be good for the 3rd star.
---
Never go over what someone can buy in one or two items.
---
Rip. I'm in a similar position, at 800 atoms right now and finished most of the regular challenges. I already got the blackbird when it first came out but I missed a ton of the cool PA skins recently, like the war rider or blood raider because I didn't have atoms
---
Ummm  ummm give me a sec I’m thinking.
---
Yeah I am focusing on Enclave events, but I kinda just happened to kill a legendary. I'm going to chalk it up to a bug. Thanks.
---
I’m not understanding what you want in terms of more direct contact. The devs already post patch notes in here, and respond to people sometimes. Do you want them to PM you??
---
seriously. can’t afford 25 caps to check out a vendor? take.your.broke.ass.home.
---
I genuinely would like a Tesla Cannon, since we genuinely dont have a large number of pulse based weapons in the game. It's limited to Grenades, Mines, and legendary effect weapons.
---
Haha I love wacky builds
---
Have you considered applying at Bethesda for a gameplay designer position?
---
I did send you a request on psn but atm I'm re-doing my room so I probs won't be on till the weekend.
---
Sorry I’m only taking right nuts. Maybe next time.
---
Same boat as you - I never played melee until FO76.
---
Made L96 last night - here's a few things I've learned:
---
2h weapons are generally slower but have higher damage.  
---
1H weapons are generally faster, but do less damage.  
---
However, a fast 1H can do more damage than a 2h in the same amount to time.
---
Some 1H do the same or better than 2H
---
e.g. - a fast switchblade does 85, grognak axe does 180, but the switchblade hits 3x in the time it takes grognak to do 1 hit. 
---
255 vs 180 in the same time span.
---
Blade of Bastet (medium speed), does 180 and is also AA, 
---
Same damage as Grognak AA, but faster.
---
The Gutter is a non-legendary assaultron blade, does 177 and offers health regen (like vampire).
---
Mole miner, deathclaw gauntlet. death tambo are 1H and do high damage, but cannot be equipped in PA.
---
As such, I usually use 1H weapons, but have a couple of 2H for fun.
---
High strength helps a lot.  If you are in PA, motion assist servos add +2 Str.
---
Bloody mess 3, incisor3, martial artist 3.  
---
Al least 1 of gladiator and tank killer
---
Glow sight3 (great for WS nuke zone runs), ghoulish and fireproof.  
---
Vampire weapons help offset the damage you receive working up close and personal.
---
Carry an auto-rifle and have a couple of perks for it.  you'll eventually need it.
---
Have you thought about Caps Stash farming?
---
I’ve been having “phantom structures” where ill delete something, get scrap for it, not be able to interact with it, but will still be able to see it
---
It is even weirder that we cannot know what part the mods impact until after we bought them.
---
Gotcha. What’s your psn? I get a ton of requests from the market and randoms so I may not have noticed.
---
I have the same exact problem, I also have the problem where items will suddenly vanish and I have to relog to see them again
---
So, the “rest is for everybody else” you mentioned, what items do you mean?
---
I agree, coupled with the fact that defenses don't work half the time - I support this 100%.
---
So annoying coming back to my C.A.M.P. to see my crops ravaged because my 6 turrets fail to notice a single pup going to town.
---
And with 40% swing speed I’d be slinging the dough.
---
It takes about 3 seconds to click your c.a.m.p. and hit repair all so I'm not sure how it takes too much time. I do however find it infuriating if I'm short on a material, especially for a fusion generator, but anything is pretty annoying.
---
I don't farm because doing the same thing repetitively gets boring really fast for me.  I just genuinely enjoy playing the game; however even without farming, I still have more caps than I know what to do with by prioritizing the types of junk I pick up when I'm wandering the wasteland and then spending 5 minutes at the end of my play session crafting and selling to NPC vendors to get my daily caps.
---
Maybe it was a message that you are out of toilet paper.......?
---
Guests that have to bring their own TP...just not acceptable
---
That's actually pretty cool
---
Hey thanks i will make that switch it makes more sense
---
no i am just debating on pistols or rifles for endgame
---
thanks for all the help
---
To the wastelands I go but first I need a dingy apron and a chefs hat.
---
😆
---
I had something similar happen the other day. 2 low-level players came near my Camp fresh out the vault. And they were both kids. And they were freaking out over everything. They were so worried that I was going to die [bloodied] which was funny. 
---
But they were really demanding. Like they wanted me to make them God tier weapons.
---
Change to the 50 cal receiver on that, it hits harder and the ammo is cheaper!
---
I have a 3* Instigating Rolling Pin and it is my Prized Possession
---
I only run marsupial and grounded..
---
Im not offended by it.. but I always chuckle a bit when someone posts their nukes&amp;dragons link and have every single mutation they can..
---
I would rather not have to run starched and class freak.. 
---
there are other perks that I consider to be more important to have in my build so I prioritize those over CF and a gaggle of mutations..
---
that said.. to each theri own.. bethesda allows it so why shouldnt people use it if they feel like it benefits their playstyle?
---
This was supposed to have been added last month, but Bethesda being bethesda, failed to do so.
---
And that refrigerator mod knocks your extra carry weight down so much and can't stack with the salted perk
---
I found mine on a tourist in the parking lot of the water park.
---
What's your next build? I didn't get a chance to see the maze. But the strip club was top-notch.
---
That one Vault girl really popped that Ass for 4 caps
---
Of course not. I mean just like we're doing here.
---
A bunch of game devs troll Reddit and comment from time to time. Hearthstone is an example that comes to mind but there are other.
---
The yao guai gauntlet is different than the bear arm. It's a giant bear claw strapped to your arm, kind of like the deathclaw gauntlet. I was disappointed when I found out the bear arm was a skull instead of the claw.
---
Same here.
---
That’s just one kind of armor... but I see your point.
---
I miss the old days of survival mode where it was extremely high risk and high reward. I never understood why the cap and aid payout was nerfed as hard as it was.
---
Obviously saying people can't do it won't happen but I agree with what some others have said that we should be able to show legendaries better before spending caps popping all over the place.
---
Now that being said the next problem you face is people trying to sell legendaries for way over what they are really worth.  That can be frustrating as well but I know that is part of the gamble of searching camps.  In the beginning of player vending I found quite a few really great deals from people just trying to get rid of stuff.  These days most things are either overpriced or on value but only if you really need the item they are selling.  It is really rare to find deals these days that are work reselling or scripping.
---
It has gotten to the point where I will check out player camps if they are really close by or if I am in the mood to get camp ideas.  Otherwise it's just easier to post on the trading reddit to get what you really want.
---
I go to some low levels camp, but out the shop. Last night I even threw in a instigating explosive sub machine gun.
---
"He wields the Foe-Hammer! The Beater, bright as daylight!" exclaims the first super mutant you unleash this upon.
---
Honestly the only reason I'm going for pistols is the aesthetic.  I like the idea of the mad scientist with wacky hand held devices, and rifles don't look right to me for that.
---
Asking the wrong guy. I only explained the “whale” term.
---
depends the hunting rifle is good for damage per shot
---
better would be the gauss rifle
---
if you go for dps the combat rifle would work fine or the radium rifle
---
a good allrounder is the lever action 
---
but in the end it depends on your legendary drops if you get hands on an instigating rifle youd be fine i use an instigating gaussrifle (absolutely demolishing)  an instigating plasmarifle( hard to stay sneaky though) or an instigating lever action (really good)
---
I thought this was real :-(
---
Damn Anglers, "Let's make an enemy that has both an annoying ranged attack and can be deadly in close combat. Yeah, also they come at you in groups!"
---
I wish the ENB guy wasnt such a twat ... reshade is okay, its just an overlay.
---
I wasn't ever able to at the munitions factory one. You either slide off to the side, or pass through it. There's no collision mechanics to allow for a place to stand.
---
I tried building platforms in, under, and around it, to see if I could get it to carry me, or glitch into it as it took off.
---
They're basically just fancy clouds. :(
---
For sure. It's so damn hungry though. I'm gonna have to use it on a rotation with my gatling gun and .50 cal so I can keep up with the ammo production on .308s.
---
And clan of the legendary rolling pin rolls though the wasteland dough rarely seen.
---
*LMG cries*
---
I believe the only mod it has right now is a prime receiver, yet it has a sight, barrel, receiver and a magazine mod slot
---
Because it's illegal to advertise something that doesn't exist. Just like it's illegal when they released christmas emotes 50% off for 12 bucks when it was never 24 bucks to begin with. 
---
All the backlash for the bag is justified since they advertised one bag, and didn't get it for 200 bucks, and then they offered 5 bucks of atoms (which you can't even buy the in-game canvas back for 7 bucks), and the situation got worse when influencers (people that said good things about 76) got the actual canvas bags. 
---
If that's not enough to fathom the trouble, then you have very low company standards xD "Yeah, let's advertise apples and just send them bananas, this guy won't care. "
---
I only sell legendaries in mine but you guys do what you want with yours. If I show up and all I see is non-legendary weapons, that's no different than showing up and only seeing legendaries I don't want to buy.
---
6 and a half months later, no mention about canvas bags at all. Let's see what they do at E3
---
Once I realize someone is one, I immediately leave.
---
That were just speculations. Not a Single mod got someone banned so far.
---
Oh I completely agree. It's not killing them, it's the nuisance factor. You know, there i am merrily building something then BAM! some idiot scorched is suddenly over by my reactor blasting away. I have to stop, get out of build mode, go kill him, fix whatever he broke, then think ...."Now what was I doing"?? LOL
---
yeah i was just giving an example, yet in my case it holds most true. finding raider pieces for like 25c is totally worth it. i’ve played over 900 hours and i can only craft raider sturdy legs so this helps eliminate some of the grind for me to obtain plans. 
---
i see what you’re saying tho. for me, i look for cams with junk... and it’s super frustrating to get there and find out al they had was 25,000 pieces of scrap cork.  i imagine seeing a camp with 90 weapons only to be 90 pipe pistols has to be obscenely annoying as well.
---
Once the vendor pool became shared, I started making caps more frequently. At level 15 I already had 2k. 
---
I literally pick up almost anything that vendors will buy. Especially at low levels, just pick up all wild flora you come across (some don't sell, if the value is 0c don't pick it up). 
---
When I FT to Flatwoods for example, it costs me 6 caps. But on the road to the store you will encounter about 10 soot flowers and 6 slit beans. If you have the flora perk, that's 32 caps right there (10 x 2 soot + 6 x 2 silt = 20 + 12 = 32 caps)
---
Build Water Purifiers at your C.A.M.P., I have four industrial purifiers running. I only need to carry 10 waters for myself, any overflow I sell, I think vendors pay 5 caps a piece. 
---
Also certain junk will vendor for a cap a piece, like antiseptic (I'm swimming in Stimpaks from farming Super-Mutants at the WV Lumber Yard). 
---
Chems also sell for a lot, I run Travelling Pharmacy so for all intents and purposes are basically weightless.  
---
You can also just clear all enemies near a vendor and even if you're over encumbered just keep picking everything up. Then dump the items - this only works now because of the shared vendor pool.
---
I was hoping posts like this might spread some subtle hints (though admittedly I wasn’t being very subtle) about what people are mostly looking for. Or in this case, what they are not.
---
Something to think about:
---
If you are using a Vampires Gatling Gun you are basically immortal while you have something to shoot. You can face-tank anything and come out at full health (or damn near to it).
---
If you are wanting to be the "tank" for your group you can tweak a bit more. There really is no "support" in this game. Maybe once the instanced raids go live, there might be, but there is no aggro management like in other MMOs.
---
Flamer weapons while fun to play with, but are not a good long term anything. The ammo consumption is ungodly and not sustainable in daily use. Could be wrong here, but I believe the Grounded Mutation gimps the flamer as well.
---
Blocker is pretty mandatory for any tank/support build. No other perk does more for less in a group setting. Dodgy is pretty good too. Luck of the Draw is more QOL than anything else, but Heavy Guns break.... a lot. LoD prevents that from happening.... a lot.
---
I know you said only using 1-2 heavy guns is boring, but it just is kinda the nature of gear selection. You may carry around 4-5 when you start, but as you find what you consider to be the "god tier" guns, you will end up dropping everything else.
---
There is a reason everyone runs around with gatling guns; they are the most efficient heavy gun out there for the ammo consumption.  A couple weekends ago, some friends and I ran 20 SBQ fights back to back to back, etc. Took 13 hours. I went on every single silo run and fought in every single SBQ fight. I used just under 25k rounds of 5mm the entire day.  If I had taken a mini-gun, I would have ended up using over 187k rounds for the same thing,. .50 cal would have been closer to 80k rounds for the same fights.
---
I personally carry 2 heavy guns: Vampire's Explosive gatling gun (silos, trash, I want to live no matter what), and a Bloodied FFR (faster fire rate) Gatling gun for bosses or anything "spongy".
---
Use what you like, switch when the benefits outweigh the costs, but keep in mind, you have to keep feeding whatever gun(s) you bring along :-).
---
Hi There! What level is your character at?
---
Maybe like a jason mask, predator mask etc. 
---
I wear the assaultron mask but it doesn't count as a gas mask.
---
I want those helmet paint jobs
---
Look at me. I am the stash box now
---
Psn Papertattoo
---
If I remember, when I got mine last year, it was new in box and it was $135-150 or somewhere around that.
---
Within the last few days, I acquired an Anti-armor +25% faster fire Gatling and a Quad +25% faster fire auto Railway gun. Both great drops in theory. Both trigger this bug, where some enemies become one-hit-point immortals. They die quickly when I switch to melee. It's strange since the gatling isn't even that fast of a fire rate.   
---
Does anyone know if Bethesda has acknowledged this bug?
---
lol, sorry.. posted it on my phone, something must have happened
---
Fallout could never measure with a PC MMO, because the concept is different than most of them, it really depends how much you are willing to abstract them. One thing is constant though ... The Grind is unbearable to reach end game gear and when you do, you have to take a break or wreck everything with your op character in preparation for the next addition or nerf. And nerfs, pardon me "balances" are constant.
---
And one build will always fare better than the other.
---
So far it is not as different, but people seem to like fantasy style MMOs and Fallout was a niche game even in the single player only category.
---
But the negativity surrounding it before launch, e.g. the lack of human npcs, environmental story telling, 24 players limited worlds are turnoffs to many MMO players. I was already invested in FO3  and 4, so I quickly jumped on the hype train.
---
And the hype train was a rocky ride, due to the many that crafted theories and was salty when they weren't correct. Way too many YouTubers who did that before launch. But I started formulating an opinion after the Greenbrier event. I was already invested in the game and since the launch date was close to mine and friends birthdays, we mutually gifted the game to ourselves.
---
About reviewers, I am ok for someone who dislike the game to review it, but it will not be accurate if you have opinion, before that. But to pass a verdict on an online game for the first few months is like his video of the 900 hours guy, outdated and fact lacking. No man sky was trash and now is a gem to the players who play it. FO76 was playable for me, on the limited time that I had, since launch. And when Wild Appalachia started it got even better. I enjoyed crafting alcohol, even created a build based on that, had some great photos which I captured with my camera. Felt like a squatter crawling through the Burrows and enjoyed the Imposter Sheepsquatch quest line, to later be amazed by the real thing. Player vending opened my eyes to the possibility in camp building and that a square box is not a proper living space. The Purveyor added an alternative to dumping poo bags with legendaries to the newbies and made the grind a bit better. Also the Pioneer scouts, provided some alternative to power armor in terms of carry weight and challenge wise took me to places I didn't explore yet.
---
So daily if I have a two hours, I enjoy different events or challenges and dailies in where ever my journies take me.
---
Also I dabbled in the Survival mode, which was fun, but time consuming for new character.
---
Exactly. I think a lot of people don’t really have anything worth while to sell, yet they just want to participate. Which is cool but I’m spending tons of caps fast traveling. I’m not even going to shop in the forest anymore. Lol
---
Uh... weren't Snallygasters once human? If so I don't think I'd be able to saddle-up as it were...
---
I don't know. You might be able to do it via PC since you can play Xbox games on PC from what I gather
---
Sadly you are right and it goes far beyond the actual game. People often have an unrealistic view of an item's worth but that is often reflective of what it is worth to THEM . Other folks are just greedy and then there are those, who like me, don't have a clue and are taking a wild ass shot in the dark..... except I'm honest enough to ask y'all's opinion so i can make changes. I would like to see your place. if you're not on PC maybe you could past a few photos. Of course if you ARE on PC what is your handle and i'll look for you because those are awesome prices!
---
Well, I havent decided yet. I have debated stealing your church idea...with a twist. 
---
Maybe a trap house. Idk inspiration has yet to hit
---
I am beginning to think we PC people are in the minority
---
The Mutants call “beware the white dust storm for it there the Beater will be found”.  It’s may be more like mumph white storm bad stupid human.
---
who cares if it's pay to win. you gonna beat the game with +1 perception. how stupid. People have gotten to  sensitive
---
don’t judge a book by it’s cover! my camp is in the forest and i sell cheap shielded armor, serums, and pain-in-the-neck-to-craft drugs, and stupid cheap mentat and all the good beers! haha
---
hehe nope but i did buy the canopies, the giant stone logo statue, and the awesome tuxedos set
---
That sounds like the beginning of a good "around the campfire story" .... details?
---
Like a month or two ago, received a 2nd email from Bethesda that I had to verify my address on [Bethesda.com](https://Bethesda.com) within 3 days days or the bag would no longer be sent. Still have not received it or heard anything else since I verified the address.
---
Sharing is Caring in the Wasteland :)
---
I apologize for having no idea who you are as you claim to be famous to someone.
---
First off - no excuse to message your wife or say horrible things to her, family is always off the table no exceptions.
---
But I have to say, if you are trash talking and trolling players being all edgy etc. then why would you use a Facebook account that has personal information on it or at all links to you as a gamer. If you want to piss on players and troll/bait them etc. etc. then make sure that you keep that completely separate from you as a person online otherwise if you push people too far you're going to get someone doing this. Just as you now threaten this person with taking away his job and going to jail because he went too far, perhaps he felt in some way you went too far and sent a nasty message to your wife (not that that is in any way excusable!). 
---
Block them, make sure you don't put personal information that is attached to your nasty or whatever in game persona and walk away. Coming on here to make public threats etc. rather than just sending this person a personal message and then making an announcement about now being a 'wuss' and only playing PVE (thanks for that from those of us who just like to play PVE BTW)  to a bunch of people who have no idea who you are really seems like an attempt to get some attention.
---
TL/DR - person message family bad/don't know who you are/don't really care about personal announcement
---
I try to just sell things that people could really use OR that I know they might have special affinity for (like vampire explosive). Of course, i know that’s totally subjective, but at least I put some thought into it.
---
Not sure about classification but there is a skin for it. Or at least there was in the atomic shop, not sure if its still there but its got sheepsquatch (goat head basically) skin for it

---
My mad doc is ALL about the pistols... for the same reasons as  you. Giant, ridiculously oversized energy pistols just... "look right".
---
Because it takes money to pay the devs who fix the bugs and add new content, it takes money to run the servers we play on...like it or not, money makes the world go around, my friend.
---
Any of the random encounter locations has a Chance of spawning one. Just try charlston Station... if not for the mothman than for the vendor bot. Its a win win .
---
Completely agree. I had no idea that console peeps were limited that way. I must have a gig of photos since I've been a photo-bug since Skyrim days
---
The point still stands though that No Mans Sky wasnt just trash, it was peddled with outright lies and fixed down the line. That shouldn't be how games are done.
---
Oh that's good they said they are making final preparations for shipping. Hopefully they were able to verify your shipping address!
---
I also use an instigating gauss, 
---
(with covert op/rifleman/tank killer and bloody mess maxed)
---
It truly is a beast of a toy lol.
---
Hi There! Next to West-Tek is a Military Camp with some intriguing machinery and a reference to the Crashed Space Station that may get linked in to a future quest.
---
They're all pretty easy to make 3 of a day.
---
Good question
---
It's part of the Battle Bot event.
---
Not to brag but i probably have over 100 shots just of my heavily modded French sweetie from FO4. Yes ...i am a lonely ...lonely man LOL
---
I do care, anyways don't know how talking about p2w has to do with been sensitive but oh well I guess you are right how stupid is your comment.
---
I have the same bloodied
---
Dont need luck. Ammo is always in demand. 2 points of agility into ammosmith, one point of intelligence into scrapper, and three points of luck into super duper. In an hour you can easily make like 10k rounds of 556, sell for 8k. Repeat.
---
Even nukashine?
---
Joelyish
---
So far, I have bought dense trapper torso plan from Watoga BoS vendor and dense leather plan from Watoga statin vendor. It is obviously RNG and if anyone has dense combat plan and wants to trade or sell it, let me know.
---
I feel like a lot of people are hanging on to what was said at E3 announcing this game, and get mad when it’s not 100% exactly what they said it would be. Even though they said it would grow and change with the players.
---
Games are rarely what they announce these days. (See Anthem) 
---
As far as the solo aspect goes, you can finish the main quest and quite a few side quests with no help. You may have to deal with consequences of other players in the area, but still solo able. I played my second character completely solo unless it’s an event. 
---
The end game is where I see the biggest problem because everyone asks “what’s the fastest way to level to 100” followed by “level 100 never seen a TSE” followed by “bored what to do now” 
---
This is where it seems like they had to make a decision. 
---
There was much backlash on having NO end game, so to slow you down and make content that you couldn’t just buzz through they add in the team up aspect. 
---
This isn’t for just content either but also fits with the atom shop. Challenges were so easy in the beginning I saved up close to 4k atoms twice. Now with the camera you need a friend to get that free money.
---
Roger that
---
and lived to tale the tale to the kids :)
---
I actually still have a character in the forest. I’m talking point pleasant. She gets my overflow items to sell. And NOBODY ever goes  there. Lol
---
You're posting your thoughts on a public forum: is it more reasonable to claim that one unknown person is persecuting you across the internet, or could it be that your points aren't being as well-received as you'd like (there are 180,000~ish members in this community and we each have the ability to upvote and downvote)?
---
Thats what they said but i'm not holding my breath..lol  Hope yours is on its way!
---
The Civil War Top Hat also counts :)
---
I picked mines up from the Harper's ferry bot for about 900 caps.
---
Left my L5 Somerset Special and 100 .44s in there last night...
---
Want to really blow your mind?  300 blackout is a cut down 5.56 case with a 7.62/308 round stuck in.
---
Yeah, i heard someone else say they got it in watoga. Ive found all the dense mod boxes (except combat) at the watoga vendor
---
glowing pustules
---
Awesome...thats the kind of thing im wondering. If its worth checking all the vendors. Thanks
---
I think once they're airborne they dont have collision, so you fall through.
---
I did outline that I was talking about players who didn't trade with others for their caps. More so, players who primarily didn't get their caps from the reddit or player vending.
---
Kind of. You have to find a tourist with a broken camera on him. To FIND a tourist is a little harder but think of the spots a real one would go to pre-war. Once you have one it'll let you fix it at a Tinker's bench but not before and it has to be the right kind of camera (I've had dozens of broken cameras but not one off a dead tourist yet)
---
Perched on the turret of the castle north of the purveyor... Lewisburgh?
---
Also ran into one (literally) after heading north from the farm with the sheepsquatch event to the train station at top of the world. my path crossed a road and it was just in the bushes on the north side of the road.
---
Sorry I can't remember the exact names of places!!
---
It will be tiring.
---
Frankly, having played some survival, Ive encountered players twice. The map is huge and you cant fast travel. You'll see, it gets boring.
---
I have actually managed to get a spare hunters coat, and the clean space suit yesterday.
---
I remember the first time I was hopping for the hunters coat, took 3 days for the vendor bot to show up once.  So far Ive spawned him in 3 times.
---
Its like the game knows what your after haha
---
Oops sorry. :)
---
Plans, junk, chems and cheaper equipment.
---
Go into more detail if you can please.
---
That rings very true with how poorly they manage their patches too.
---
As Todd said, it's not about how it is now but what it will become....
---
Me too. I love taking photos and actually risk getting killed to get some shots LOL
---
LOL ... good point!!
---
Yes, she tends to cluster legendary effects one after the other. I got 4 bashing damage and 2 Mutant's Explosive right after one another. My current hypothesis is that picking up items temporarily boosts chances for the legendary effects and item type. On the bright side, this is how many have gotten many TSEs in a quick succession.
---
Therefore, I suggest once you see 2 bad items or effects in a row, scrip them and hop servers.
---
Not scaly skin!!!! Coal is a pain.
---
Great shot. Classic horror picture!
---
I'd definitely keep checking Harper's ferry and Watoga.
---
i have a second one in stock recently if op wants to buy it and happens to play on ps4 👍🏼
---
I agree its worth bringing up and talking about.  Maybe things will get better over time as sellers realize people aren't buying certain things.  I know I have stopped trying to see certain items or reducing the price on things until they start to sell.
---
U can price it at 25k if u want
---
Personally I think Carnivore is best. Bone is easy to find on Muties, fertilizer is easy to make from meat that expires before I consume it. Fluorescent flux is plentiful at nuked WS.
---
Ty, looks like I need Red (pink) and blue Mr Fuzzy mining helmets. Any idea where to get blue one?
---
My sister use the Castle to display her collection of PA suits. Has the halls lined with displays.
---
I think the Purveyor is Berkeley Springs, havnt tried the castle yet, so will definitely give that a go.
---
I'll try the farm too.
---
Thanks for your help
---
I sell those things too. The post just mentioned common weapons and armor.
---
You can price items however you like up to 25K.
---
Early on, seemed like I was always low on adhesive, so I started a small adhesive farm.
---
Not that I went back very often, but it was there if I needed it.
---
I moved and greatly expanded my camp when player vending came out.
---
The new location is  much more convenient to where I'm exploring, so I do get back there a bit more often to utilize the farm and resource node.
---
Wasteland ID theft.... I like it :)
---
I agree. Would make more sense - lore wise, as well.
---
Better yet, you should unlock legendary effects by a prestige/ranking system.
---
Want Mutant Slayer perk? Kill 1,000 lvl 50+ mutants, etc.
---
odds are the level 3 was a teen, they seem to have no respect for anything
---
hold on, theres one of them outside my house now! get off my lawn!
---
not a bug.  You take soooo much damage, there's no chance of respawn.
---
I'm with this guy. That fucker sounds unhinged.
---
I agree to that and there is no doubt that games should be handled better that many of the recent titles. That and the greed in Bethesda's executively are the only points where I agree with Jim.
---
Everyone involved in this story seems like trash to me.
---
I buy every hunting rifle, minigun, gatling gun, handmade, and 10mil I see to scrap for mods.
---
it does leave a mental scar, doesnt it?
---
I have 2 small water purifiers at my camp, 1 is locked, but the other is free.
---
I figure 2 water is enough to get you to 3/4 full (ish), and it refills fast enough.
---
i love it!!!!
---
So, I've *never* found the plans.  I've heard players say they can drop from Treasure Maps and Megasloths.  Even heard one who said they spontaneously acquired the Metal one from scrapping.  But I can't vouch for any of those as I've done plenty and have never seen them myself.
---
I have, however, acquired Dense mods for pretty much every armor.  Most of them were acquired from the inner Grafton vendor prior to Patch 9.  The one Combat Dense I had before then was acquired from the BoS vendor in Watoga.  Since Patch 9, I haven't seen any Dense mods for sale outside of the sporadic Marine Dense at the Watoga vendors.
---
In 500+ hours of playing, I've come across the Combat Dense Mod exactly *twice*.  In fact, when people debate whether or not Combat is truly the best armor, especially compared to Marine, I have to bring up that Marine Dense is a lot easier to come by.
---
What annoys me is all the people who have locked their entire camp up, not even a workbench and stash for the overencumbered sloggers to use.
---
See I'd love the ability to make legendarys crafted items where as we buy the parts to make our own weapons and armor rather then the random system - I think it would not only give crafters a big boost but also give players a greater level of customization and control at end game
---
Consider what you can mod. Hunting rifles are plentiful and you can learn all the mods easily. LAR etc less common. You need to craft and destroy or farm plan locations. 
---
I went from hunters to LAR... they are twice as good...
---
My ears ring when I think about it
---
I wish having a certain number of simultaneous mutations made you look like a super mutant.
---
I didn’t even know there was a thing lol I just walked out of white springs front door after shopping and found a dead guy on the hood of a car with a camera. I’m like “Nicccceeee”
---
Man OP, either you pissed off somebody or you asked the wrong question because the downvote fairies are all over this post.
---
I used the mothman area to find mine
---
I just got the chameleon recipe which requires violet flux and fiber optics..the flux was easy to get but I got 200 fiber optics from the market subs..now I have so many serums..no way was I gonna try to grind for the fiber optics lol
---
Looks really good considering the limitations! 
---
Also, my head is naturally that shape and unfortunately I have the same hair.
---
Bought mine from the Watoga train station maybe three weeks ago.
---
If you play sneaky an Instigating Rifle is a one shot machine, as said by others. Gauss does the most damage but is big, slow and clunky and frankly more than you need for most enemies. My L25 Instigating Lever kills most enemies in one head shot so imo my L35 and L45 versions are OP! Instigating Gauss is way OP with sneak bonus.
---
It got really lucky with that death beam, I was in "caution" and invisible popping off sneak crits like no tomorrow then he just turned and melted me out of nowhere.
---
Ya, I’m all about that. Make it so you can’t craft legendaries until level 100 or something like that. Would make end game a little more exciting. Now, the market is stupid inflated with 1* and 2* legendaries with a pretty good market for 3* to boot. Kinda makes it all pointless
---
Is this worse on console?  I don't think I've seen it happen on PC.
---
Oh, Yes! It had a red tricycle right next to it! (That's from The Shining too) thanks for reminding me of it, got a big laugh from that one. 
---
I need to look through my pics.. I usually snap one when I see these things, if I think of it.
---
You can check out my camp if you’d like..... it’s a giant superstore with an upstairs piano bar. PSN: Wardaddy9874
---
I’m online every afternoon
---
Oh snap, I do have one of the repair perk cards equipped.
---
That almost sounds rude LOL ...words normally shouted from a darkened hotel room? "CLETUS MA WICKKIBALS"!!!!
---
Level 121 at the moment.
---
I have thru hiker maxxed and armor that reduces the weight of food and water. My purified water weighs .05 each, so I typically carry around a few hundred to hand out to newer folks and have it hotkeyed so I am never thirsty.
---
I’ve found the plans at many different robot vendors. Never found through a treasure map.
---
*broken prosnap deluxe as the regular prosnap is not reparable.
---
Add me, Ill give you a tour!
---
Oh ok I’ll accept the invite later today. I should be on this weekend too so come check it out if you’re on
---
Yeah i actually have 3 of the marine dense mods , cause i keep seeing them when im looking for combat. I just pick them up. My good armor is combat tho....so the search continues.
---
And i check the grafton vendor to. It just sux having to pay to fast travel from watoga to grafton every time i switch servers to check
---
Got mine at the giant teapot
---
That is a tip worth remembering..... certainly worth trying!
---
Is that better for than crafting and scrapping? Especially the hunting and 10mm which I think everybody has.
---
The mountain range left if Abbie’s bunker that borders the savage divide and more is my camp location had many encounters there recently

---
Cool. I'll get to it later
---
I say it is, because all I know who play PC games are adults. Never known too many kids to play pc.
---
I'm a big fan of sugargliders, but they should not be kept as a pets. 
---
(Just taking advantage of the whole "say what you want" thing)
---
I sell low level (there's always a full suit of armour and at least 1 melee and 1 ranged all level 1, but good enough to last you to level 5-10 happily.
---
1 cap per level on sub level 20 stuff.
---
My camp is near vault 76, within audio distance of the 'haunted' cabins.
---
not to mention it could be an amazing cap sink since Bethesda desperately wants all of us to remain poor.
---
I like talons. Uses fluorescent flux, acid, and bone. All are easy to get.
---
I’m pretty proud of mine. It’s a pre-existing “structure” that I’ve never seen anyone use and it’s been a lot of fun. On PS4 D-Wall317 if you wanna check it out!
---
&gt; Make Heavy Guns more accessible. Make a heavy pipe gun, like a belt feed .38 pipe machine gun, that can be used at low levels (10-20). 
---
That's be really cool. A lower level (maybe 10 or 15) option for heavy weapons users would be awesome. I'd level a new character just to use it. I'd also like heavy weapons perk cards available earlier. Everything else can be taken starting in the 1-20 range, but heavy weapons get the shaft. You start needing perk cards to keep up with bullet spongey of enemies starting at around level 15, and it only gets worse as time goes on. 15-30 can be a real pain for heavy weapons users, and no, I don't want to waste perk points on weapons I won't use after level 30. My solution so far has been to use melee weapons in power armor instead, but that just isn't as fun to me.
---
&gt; Stabilized. As a player who dislikes power-armor I feel cheated that I'm required to use it if I want to use heavy guns. 
---
I'm conflicted about this one. First, I like the idea thematically. Maybe you could get that armor penetration, but not the accuracy boost? This is one of my favorite perk cards in that it fits thematically, functionally, and lore wise. Using most of the heavy weapons in Fallout wouldn't really be possible even for the strongest humans without power armor to help dampen the recoil and steady the aim. The other issue is that if this becomes the case, heavy weapons will be come the de-facto best pvp weapon overnight. Say goodbye to variety. I'm fine with it as is. I just wish they'd make the armor pen work for energy weapons.
---
&gt; Unfinished Weapons. The Light Machine-gun, really, it has no mods at all.
---
Agree. Same could almost be said of the .50 cal too honestly. It has a heavy barrel mod that is a straight up 10% damage upgrade, which makes you wonder why it isn't on there to begin with, and a prime barrel option. My biggest issue with the LMG is the cost to fire it though.
---
That's fair. May I also ask you what your favourite part of FO76 has been throughout your playtime? Mine was the photo mode. There are some bleak looking places out there.
---
His last post was 71 days ago. He truly crawled out of hole to post that shit.
---
Ok. Someone the other day posted how they keep seeing them at robot vendors...wth
---
Yeah Im on ps4 and 1/5th of my allocated pictures are a fight between a SB and MLQ that I witnessed.  Im not sure I will ever erase those.
---
There's a longer discussion that could be had regarding this.
---
The point was less about specific answer to the same questions. More that there are plenty of unanswered questions that could do with some response/clarification.
---
The article made out like we don't understand how things won't work out the way we think it would. How else are we going to understand if they don't explain it to us? That's all I'm asking really.
---
AFAIK, General is Enclave, not BoS. 
---
(thus) 
---
the DMV quest isn't required for Enclave ranking
---
Yeah I'm really curious about how many more polygons can the game handle, if everyone display all their stuff in full glory. The laggyier the merrier 👍
---
I have 5 of 7 plans and all came from robot vendors. 4 different vendors for the 5 plans.

It wuz those Chinese sum bishes wern't it?

I misremembered the stats for Ultracite and I agree that Ultricite should have something more going for it.  I would give it something like 515/480/480/1475 to make it more end game worthy.
---
And btw, I have never found them in watoga. Other vendors. So many have a chance.
---
Photo mode and exploration, which go hand in hand. And different builds, to push the limits on achieving stuff.
---
I thought he'd one-shot them for sure, but he didn't. I was impressed, haha.
---
I had to do the same recently... i got way too tired of joining a new server 10+ times to get my camp placed. That spot’s nice but kinda overrated. I found a nice little U-shaped rock alcove that descends into a pond, southwest of Fort Defiance. I like the spot way better and it gives more room for crops!
---
Thanks, will give it a few run throughs
---
Squatches in the mist
---
Also enamel buckets have plastic but not the undamaged ones
---
I think the return of this skin is actually really good because it removes all pressure to buy Atoms for a limited time item. If there’s something in the shop you like but don’t have the Atoms for atm, just keep grinding and save up and that item will be back eventually.
---
Not for me
---
Ahhh...well at least now i know im not wasting my time traveling all over to check. Thanks
---
Are you able to do this on Xbox? You’d be very welcome in my camp to review it.
---
You can price them clear up to 25,000, but note:
---
* There is a 10% fee on every transaction (so you really make 22,500 Caps off a 25,000 Cap transactions).
---
* The amount of Caps you receive can't exceed your normal 25,000 limit.  Anything beyond that is a loss for you, even though the buyer pays it anyway.
---
But ti become a general you have to do first enlist in the military and for that you need to do the training. Doesn't that also require the license?
---
Going on 30 hours now and no response to my ticket ,...
---
I ran into the injured super mutant this past weekend in the Bog. He was being accosted by a friendly (to me) scorchbeast and I felt kinda bad for him. He barely survives the sheepsquatch encounter only to run into another apex predator immediately after. So I figured putting him out of his misery was the right thing to do.
---
No filter.
---
Probably a bitter Anthem player lol
---
I'm on about the mats, running all over looking for specific items is time consuming.
---
I just put the Imgur link in the description and it did it automatically
---
I got a good one for you I’ll post it later today (;
---
This post is old, but I just searched "kotaku" in Reddit to see if a post like this existed.  Such a trash move to make articles from Reddit posts and I see it all the time.  Kotaku is annoying.  I'm not clicking their dumb click bait titles anymore. I.E. "The Internet Reacts to New \[game\] Trailer, Whatever That Was"
---
All time is limited, my friend.
---
I use it because it’s a rare Damage-related option in Charisma. What else are you going to use when you take Hard Bargain off? Travel Agent and Tenderizer. But I have no idea if it actually works!
---
In 600 hours I've run into like one kid. Everyone else was at least 16+, and the 16 year old sounded like a 40 year old somehow.
---
Limited time means "available for a limited time". As in, they will go away after a while, but not necessarily forever.
---
Sounds fun
---
I bet the noobie that found that thought they hit the jackpot.
---
Nice, I have a Bloodied +SS/+1STR
---
Sadly not, I'm only on ps4
---
I love this idea but Im nervous as to whether servers can handle the load that having more moving parts would create.
---
If they can I’d suggest having a Mr Farmhand you could build to tend crops and empty extractors.  It would make workshops even more useful.
---
Nice lol not ganna lie ive had the black hawk paint since it came out.
---
But that was when...
---
Fusion cores replenished themself and backpacks didn't add +120 carry weight 
---
Only time i pull out the PA is to use the jetpack.
---
To infinity and beyond!
---
No i didn't use it.
---
I actually had my friends kill it while I tried to get some action shots, lol. Can’t waste lighting like this!
---
I use an instigating Hunting/Sniper Rifle for most things, when I know I will have time for the reload, also carry both an Instigating Handmade and an Furious Handmade for special situations.
---
Instigating Gauss if I know I'm going to need to pack more of a one shot punch.
---
Im using lone vanderer . Cant really justify it with a bloodied build since i 1 or 2 shot most enemies , exept bosses . I can imagine its good in bigger fights if it affects ppl around
---
yeah the forest is probably no one’s go-to haha. the way i see it, if someone comes to my camp in the forest i kind of owe it them to offer some of the better items. i actually don’t sell any weapons because i would only sell 1-3 at a time and that is only useful for a small # of players. so at least when they get here and see it’s shielded armor etc., they at least don’t feel like they landed on a crappy camp.
---
Yeah, personally, I have doubts that the mods (other than Marine) are still readily available.  I check the Grafton vendor maybe every other day and I haven't seen anything since Patch 9.  I did acquire a Leather Dense Mod rather cheaply from a player vendor yesterday though - not sure how they came across it.
---
Random spawn locations .. top of the world has 6 or more spots for armor plans .  
---
Scrapping armors. 
---
 I was told some you cannot learn like this but was pretty sure I  learned bos legs like that found the chest mod and learned bos arms by scrapping armors.
---
I think the only way to get it to work is you have to of had found a camera from the dead corps first. It's only works if you lost your old camera and I think I have 25 in my inventory. I'm gonna put 1 out in my vendors machine everyday until there gone for free. My in game name (ign) is ...ace26041 my camp is about the middle of the map by Arktos Pharma if yours broke
---
I wasn't interested in nukashine, but yeah couldn't afford that either even if I was interested in it.
---
I sell stable violet flux at 100-150 a pop. Can farm a few hundred in a day. At the medium price range, 200 x 125 = 25K, maxed in a day. Also other random junk, like plastic, rubber, cloth, etc, all goes for 1-2c each on PC. Steel sells for .5-1c each but I use that for crafting ammo. Lead goes for 2c each. It adds up very fast. The key is to trade with other players, not just vendor stuff, but even vendoring is very profitable. Once you get a serum recipe, you can craft 3 of those per day and get 1400 caps from a vendor every day on every character. 1400 x 5 = 7,000 caps per day. I've maxed out my caps in a week after a big purchase (literally 5x characters at 25K caps) and had to start putting them on my second acount.
---
There was an interview with the Devs released today and they are actively monitoring which mods are popular to implement them into the game. So it's unlikely, as he said, they'll come after you for a legitimate mod
---
Caps are easier to get than screws, adhesive, and whatever else it takes to make 100 of any weapon
---
Instigating
---
So you want them to spin Automatron from Fallout 4 into 76?
---
Same! Just hit it yesterday, been playing since Beta but a casual player. About to hit lvl 100. Thinking of going to Whitesprings to buy some fancy CAMP decorations
---
Right. I feel like the vendors have all the same plans, except one or two, every time i check. Thats why i was really curious if people are still finding them there
---
This is why i enjoy reading and sharing on these posts. One, it's slightly comforting to know that other people sweat over small details as much as i do ... i don't know .... is a really common neurosis no longer a neurosis? I also love the fact that i pick up on great helpful hints and factoids completely at random as people mention them. Like instead of suffering after a huge camp attack. just rebuild by moving. I also didn't know the reason WHY  "they" couldn't place my camp was because someone else was already there before i logged on ... just never thought about it - guess i'm too used to glitches ...maybe? Anyway your camp sounds awesome! Are you on PC because if you are we are neighbours.
---
If a mod got someone banned they'd be complaining in the mod comments section for the mod on the nexus, you can bet on it. I haven't seen a single post like that over there.
---
said the person with caps to spare
---
Oooooo what an incredible shot!! Mind if we share this on the Fallout twitter today?
---
Fame seems hard to come by in 76. Was this the guy with the ORIGINAL boxing ring at the Whitespring that got minor media attention?
---
Thanks! I don’t mind at all!
---
Same.  That said, if you store the whole thing and scrap the blueprint, you can just rebuild with all of your old pieces - all magically repaired.  It sucks.. but the neat thing about camp building, is that they get better each time you put one together.  :)
---
I think the bot stop has my favorite voice lines from any event. I miss the pre nerfed bot stop days when you got like 20 muties per wave running at you.

Yeah I'm especially surprised some of the building parts like junk walls never made it into 76.
---
Nice shot! This makes me think of Black Philip, the satan goat, from The Witch.
---
I'm considering moving again now. I don't like the spot I had to shift to in order to stay in the same general area (I'm right on the Forest/Ash Heap border and now I'm more Ash Heap than Forest), but I haven't found another place I like better. Ah well.
---
semi because i use less than half the bullets than i do when i use an auto. that may be due to the way i play, though.
---
Take your time, don't rush, read everything, do everything, explore, do NOT rush, the endgame for Fallout 76 is pretty nonexistent for right now, so enjoy the journey, meet new people and maybe kill them (If on PVP server), find the perfect spot for your C.A.M.P and be proud of it
---
F76 is an amazing game if you stop and smell the radioactive roses.
---
Oh my god, how did I not think of that... there needs to be a subreddit just for camp artistry lol
---
Amazing job!
---
I found one by accident, when doing the event at the Phillipi Cemetery. It will be right in the middle of the path, on the ground.
---
I’ve also heard of it being found at Wavy Willard’s leaning on a car in the parking lot, and somewhere near the Mothman Museum. They will always have a unique name like “Anne” so you’ll know you found them.
---
My two shot Gauss, fully modded. Just want the suppressor 😁
---
I look forward to it!
---
Share pics? For science of course.
---
Shame, good luck with it though mate, it’s a great idea.
---
All hail Lord peesack! May he urinate forever!
---
I really appreciate it, thank you
---
Sentinels meant you couldn’t move, all you had to do to beat it was take cover out of their line of sight, everyone thinks having the armor is no effort, but it isn’t. I have a full set of sentinel assassins and I still get shredded in about 8 seconds by a single missile launcher turret. The nerf may not seem like much, but the 75% is for each effect and I don’t personally think it’s even 75% because again the missile launcher turret can kill me. The counter to strong armor isn’t to nerf it, you need to learn the counters.
---
lmfao
---
I did that to one of my posts and I didn't see it
---
bloodied is the best for this
---
Collect lots of junk, bulk it up, and use Hard Bargain + Grape Mentats when you sell it.  Go to West Tek and collect Assualt Rifles to sell - over 100 caps each.  Sell chems that you don't use.  Use perks like Pharmasomething to search for extra chems and Cap Collector to find extra caps in "Cap Stashes".  Learn the locations of the cap stashes and make a "route" to collect 5 - 6 of them, use "Cap Collector" at each one, and if you have very high Luck, you could get over 500 caps for each route, I'm not sure, but I think they respawn about once per day or so?  I can't tell because I don't know when it's not respawned yet, or, it's not there because another player got it?
---
It's not that hard to get 1,400 caps per day from the Train Station vendors.
---
And so begins the ballad of Cletus Base Blaster, who traumatised by the loss of Prince Hippity, set about systematically bathing the homestead of every vault dweller he could find in nuclear fire.
---
The fact the liberators flavor text wasnt in Chinese made me a little disappointed, but other than that and the lack of a sentry bot or our very own biv, this is an amazing idea
---
Aid was fine in my opinion, it took a long time for most people to get their stealth boys, but caps were perfect.
---
What I'd prefer is for survival to actually be about.. survival, and then if they want to do arena deathmatch to appease people who purely want to pvp and nothing else, then that will be nuclear winter. Or the other way around. I really don't care.
---
They can just reduce the robot spawning in watoga a little lol
---
Depends on the range I’m at. Out in the open semi, in close quarters like Westek auto.
---
Came out of a Nukashine haze to Mothman standing over me. He took off when I drew my weapon. Who knows what he did while I was out.
---
All photos taken on PS4 are saved, you just can't see them all in the in game photo gallery.
---
Ill check the event viewer once i manage to install the game again i already downloaded it 2 times took me 3 hrs each time the download finishes but nothing happens just keeps downloading lmao wth been up all night trying to fix it.
---
Full auto feels good, but is super wasteful, semi isn't as fun but usually hits more
---
I think I ran into you the other day. Didn't realize you were royalty. Sorry for what happened.
---
Uh, wut.
---
I wasn't sure so I checked in game. I cooked tato soup and bloodleaf tea and both showed up in my effects tab as active effects when consumed, so I would say yes they seem to be working.
---
Combat armor -- for that ball jointed shoulders look.  Ugh.
---
You cannot vend, trade or drop the broken prosnap deluxe.
---
I cut power to my camp If I'm selling something that will exceed the cap limit when bought.
---
"PvP" in this game may as well be synonymous with "Troll".  It deserves the downvotes.  Never do you see actual even fighting, it is always some high level asshole picking on a sub-20 person going about their daily life.
---
Great story. This is exactly the kind of post i enjoy reading and what i like to share of my own. Stories are after all, the oldest form of communication and entertainment ... the original history and fables of mankind. 
---
One thing though, and I've heard it repeated many times on this post. You need to find those responsible and make them pay. 
---
Burn them, burn them with fire, burn them all. 
---
We feel your pain Cletus and you are amoung friends. Hippity shall long have his story retold around campfires across the wastelands. Tales of loss and redemption always strike close to the heart and heroes never really die.
---
Yesterday I've done the challenge and I skipped this one and made other 25 (there are 26 alcohols total counting for that challenge). Maybe you miss one recipe?
---
I have a Instigating Dragon, with +50% limb dmg ad reduced VATS cost. I call it Anklerender.
---
Can I join?
---
You have the recipe for the cranberry moonshine?
---
This is awesome. I kinda want to drop random dragons in your camp as a sign of respect.
---
I also really enjoy spending 1000$'s from my mom's bank account on a game and then being extremely toxic!
---
That's a pretty neat tool. I want to dig into it more, specifically where it shows the DPS because I wonder if that's 0 DR calculated. If you look at the generated chart it seems to be.
---
You identified exactly what I was mentioning - the "DR gap" lowers as the per-shot damage increases. Comparing 0 DR damage is absolutely pointless. 300 DR is what you should be looking at since that's the DR of most players and high level enemies. After 300 DR it's diminishing returns for the target and that's probably why the tool creator stopped at 300.
---
I would ask that you do a vanilla (ie: skip all the extra damage buffs for now) and compare what the usual bonuses would be for a character. For example, **no stabilized** (since the topic is PA being required for it) against a handmade with a powerful auto receiver, stinging magazine, and tank killer. You can add the rest back later, but we can keep it simple for now.
---
Minigun vs Handmade. You should find the handmade wins at high DR on per-shot damage.
---
Just for fun, add Stabilized. **The handmade wins again at high DR**. Toggle to 
---
If we want to stack damage modifiers I would question just how many headshots you're scoring with a Minigun vs a Handmade rifle and what the accuracy and engagement range is that you're expecting. Is it point blank?
---
Try a lower RoF big gun like Gatling and compare. Compare a hardened handmade. Now compare the .50 Cal sample at 300 DR.
---
According to the tool, the DPS for the handmade is 138 and the 50 is ..... 96 without stabilized and 118 with it.
---
The end result should be that it's clear the .50 Cal sample you performed upheld your opinion but does not reflect the entire class of weapons at a reasonable performance for end game characters.
---
Finally, I would ask that you try it yourself in-game.
---
You have to remember that Bethesda made a similar mistake with combat armor in FO4 (one of the pieces has a different weight to the others) and they still haven't fixed it.
---
That’s where I see him most too
---
Yeah I don’t have the cranberry moonshine recipe, done all the others except this tequila one
---
I did use some filters in photomode for this to make it look more dark at night time than usual hopefully my picture looks good for you all
---
What  legendary/version of the combat rifle are you using?
---
Its a 60$ game, its not toxic, its pvp mode, I never do this in adventure mode
---
I can get over 100 caps at one single "Cap Stash", if I'm lucky.  I use the "Cap Collector" perk and boost my Luck stat up with something like Unyielding Armor (and extremely low health) plus various chems can increase your Luck.  If you make a good "route" with a half dozen cap stashes along the way, you could get over 500 caps per day from stashes alone.  
---
I get most of my caps from collecting Assault Rifles at Westek (off Super Mutants) or collecting "Junk" and making "Bulk" junk to sell at Train Station vendors + use "Hard Bargain" and Grape Mentats, Beer (+1 CHR) etc...  
---
I also use the Pharma-something perk to find more Chems at each Bathroom Mirror and First Aid Box etc., then sell my extra chems.  
---
I used to sell tons of Legendaries I didn't want (most of them are useless crap) but now I turn them in for "Scrip" instead.
---
I have a character that specializes in semi and a character that specializes in full auto.  The play style is significantly different for these two characters.  If you're looking to maximize DPS, then go full auto.  If sniper and one shot kills is your thing, then go semi.  You will need to make a lot of bullets if you go full auto.
---
Dear God, my niece is like that (she's 11).  First time I loaded her player into the world she wanted to talk to EVERYONE in hyper chipmunk voice...I took the headset away from her, lol. She's calming down but still gets SUPER EXCITED when we find something or someone new.
---
If you're on PC I'm 95% sure I've got recipe for it from BIV yesterday - can sell you this.
---
Or better yet let us trade them for atoms or special loot
---
&gt; I have been wandering around with this armor forever despite it not being one of the best armors at all,
---
But it *is* one of the best armors of all -- lighter than BoS heavy combat armor, but nearly the same stats.
---
Nevermind I got it lol thanks!
---
If you're referring to what I wrote in the latter part of my message, then... well... All I've done is given you a "POI" and don't feel I've really *spoiled something*, per-se. My goal was to pique curiosity in those who hadn't yet stumbled across it --for either those who had not yet made it out that way, or by some strange coincidence a high-level player jut hadn't found it (*kinda hard to miss)*\-- and give them something to look for. However, I can appreciate that just stating an object of any kind can be found somewhere could very well qualify as a spoiler, and as such will edit to tag it just in case you were indeed referring to me. As such, my apologies. :(
---
If you were referring to the entire comment chain in general though, to be fair, I either didn't know about or hadn't made that connection, regarding the body being Sanjay. In that instance, I'm in the same boat as you, but given literally how trivial the character is (no offense to anyone, particularly the voice actor), well, I shrugged it off. Granted, my character is lvl 170, but even his eyebot Radio Tower Repair event (forgot its name) didn't really make me wonder. For that matter, I can't say I even knew it was a person, as opposed to just being an AI that churns out recorded dialogue strings for various conditions... heh
---
What's your GT? I'll buy one from you!
---
Lakeside cabins ended up being easy because there was no fighting on the server I was on. A bunch of us just took turns taking it from one another. Later that night it was a huge war zone so I can see how it could have taken some time. The bog was also a war zone though the event I did everyone was nice until it ended then all hell broke loose. I was so comfy that I walked away to use the restroom and it ended in the 2 minutes I was away. I was vaporized lol. I respawned and joined the fight.
---
I am and that would be great, thanks. IGN is the same as here
---
Yeah. I don’t even care if I get the points back. I’m just tired of endless scrolling
---
It is a long standing bug that the "find such and such place" challenges are completely bugged. I've got every single place unlocked as a fast travel place on the map yet I don't have a single "find x places in this section of the map" challenge complete. Even tried using low level alts to see if I could get it by discovering the places again, yet no luck.
---
What really pisses me off, is that the "Hard Bargain" perk doesn't work at player vending machines.
---
And, unless they changed it, from a very long distance.  Farther than they’d normally aggro on you.  Something in that generator aggro special code is or was broken.
---
I'll be online in around 3h from now, so I'll add you. My IGN is also same as here, the price would be 800 caps.
---
I've collected 25,000 caps twice so far.

I  can get over 100 caps at one single "Cap Stash", if I'm lucky.  I use  the "Cap Collector" perk and boost my Luck stat up with something like  Unyielding Armor (and extremely low health) plus various chems can  increase your Luck.  If you make a good "route" with a half dozen cap  stashes along the way, you could get over 500 caps per day from stashes  alone.
---
I get most of my caps from  collecting Assault Rifles at Westek (off Super Mutants) or collecting  "Junk" and making "Bulk" junk to sell at Train Station vendors + use  "Hard Bargain" and Grape Mentats, Beer (+1 CHR) etc...
---
I  also use the Pharma-something perk to find more Chems at each Bathroom  Mirror and First Aid Box etc., then sell my extra chems.
---
But beware!  The mods don't tell you which piece they can be applied to and some can't be applied to *any* piece!
---
I know its 60$ i meant for microtransactions like you've done
---
Hahaha, i dont suppose you remember where you were?
---
When i did drank nukashine for the quest, i ended up in a monorail train in the cranberry bog... at level 14.
---
I nope'd out of there quicker than a molerat
---
oh really? I must have been mistaking looking at the stats then!   
---
the only thing I know is that when I changed my armor to Sturdy BOS I got more protection.  
---
So its weight is one of the pros?
---
Thanks, I’ll try to start doing some of these
---
Too make your life easier I would plan a build and really focus your lvl ups on that build this is not like previous fallout games in that aspect. A good build can be the difference between playing the game on easy or extreme difficulty.
---
you cant max out more than 1 of any given card...
---
Got night person or solar powered, or any of the perks that increase your stats based on time of day? That is probably what it is. They aren't in the strength perks they are perception I think.
---
Anti Armor
---
Go to your status effects to confirm but in my experience this is a timed effect.  So with corn soup it lasts for 30min on my character.
---
40% Swing Speed
---
I believe they were very helpful in fo3 as you relied on vats in that game and using ideas paused the game but in 76 unless you do crits there is not much use for them
---
+1 Strength
---
It's a one time only I know this cause I remember using up all my AP while I was running to a quest marker and I drank a Nuka Cola quantum and my AP went back to full instantly
---
I don't see stuff selling from my vending machines either - I don't know if I've sold a single thing?  
---
But, I've collected over 25,000 caps TWICE so far (I've spent at least 30 - 40K caps and have about 25K currently):
---
More detail please? Are you going full stealth with Auto rifle perks then? I've got a Ninja that I'm considering guns for as a sideline, and this is intriguing.
---
That's fine with me since I just want to get in there, do what I need to do, get the gauntlet, then get out.  If I run into people, it is what it is and I'll deal with it.  I just want the gauntlet!
---
A couple of weeks ago I realized that my 4 points in Charisma are too many because I haven’t used Lone Wanderer for ages. Just don’t need it, enemies aren’t tough enough once you have your build sorted. I’d probably use it again on a low level character if I started another play through.
---
\*shrug\* you're in survival mode, You do you.
---
Stupid Question:
---
What’s casual under armor? I have never seen it in-game. How do I get it?
---
Level 115.
---
Cool thanks
---
&gt; I just love pulling out my tse minigun and tearing apart people's houses, its really fun to watch everything blow up
---
I can totally see that
---
I use an instigating gauss with rifleman/tank killer etc perks and Full auto for tse handmade with commando perks depending on what I’m doing or my mood lol.
---
seriously one of the best features in this game and using them as load screens!!! genius.
---
I can't believe some people are still complaining about PvP when it has been removed almost entirely from Adventure.
---
Mine does, or did up to a week ago, ill hit belching betty when I'm home to double check
---
Why would I spend 1000$ on microtransactions
---
That sounds like a suicide machine for a Bloodied build lol
---
yeah i don’t understand picking up items we don’t want just to scrip them for more items we don’t want. i’m salty because i have not received a single item from Purveyor that I would use.
---
Well yes, as already noted a bit long winded but very clever, well thought out and probably only needs a name and address to work as a resume to go work at Bethesda!! Hell, I'd hire you based on what you've done here! 
---
Actually just in case they've missed this post (I'm sure someone from Big B reads these) you should seriously send this to them. It's that well done. (IMHO)
---
Yeah you can, can only use one though
---
Thanks that good to know
---
There are downsides and upsides to each. I do whichever I have an overstock of, but I never use violet flux. Usually something that uses crimson flux.
---
Yeah I just said that because the way people talk about it, I imagined it as an endless deatchmatch... and frankly its anything but.
---
You should do it
---
Yea I truly wonder, Does ANYONE buy that shit!? And if they do, why?!
---
You dont have 3 maxxed out through hikers, once you get enough of a card to get all tiers (so for some cards that is just 1 of it) you cant pick it any more and any you get from packs just vanish into the ether.
---
Yep, especially if they have turrets
---
If you are on PC I'll hold them for you to transfer them, I'm sure you could also find someone on ps4 or xbone to help you mule if need be also.
---
Pretty smart tbh.
---
Full auto goes through bullets at an alarming rate, better have the scrounger and crafting perks maxed out! You have to practice some serious trigger discipline to avoid having to build bullets every day. I have a full auto LMG and it eats 308 like popcorn. You can't just hold the trigger down unless you want to see 1000 rounds gone in seconds...
---
People can enjoy this game how they like, and if blowing up based is how they do it that good for them, if you don’t agree with someone you don’t have to instantly call them toxic and calm the use micro transactions. Other than repair kits which don’t honestly help that much there aren’t any micro transactions, so stop being salty
---
True also , but when running at 19% hp its pretty good. But if i would run full hp its not needed at all
---
Make the experience easy on the eyes as well as on the wallet. :)
---
Um, in case i wasn't clear  .... YOU ARE A FREAKING GENIUS!
---
Rush through the main story quick as you can, try not to get sidetracked, you have to do it quick as possible it's not super long so it shouldn't take you much, but when you get done with that part the real fun begins! You want to hit 50 as quickly as possible. All gear is capped at 50 I believe, and I'd save your perk cards and points until then, that way when you hit 50, you can spend them how you want your build to go. Otherwise you will need to wait every level to change a card or ad a point to your special after already getting all you can
---
r/falloutsettlements
---
On that video, in the corner, it says something about "Lucky Miner" event though?  So it seems like they are from the event to me?
---
Do you have that amazing South African accent? Or can you speak Afrikaans? Ya'll are interesting as hell to listen to for some reason.
---
Why would you destroy someones base?
---
Its survival mode
---
Try killing gulpers, my friend got 2-3 in like an hour by server hopping at gulper lagoon
---
 I've collected at least 50,000 caps so far (perhaps much more, no idea how much I've spent but I know it's over 25K and I have 25K caps again now).
---
I  can (sometimes) get over 100 caps at one single "Cap Stash", if I'm lucky.  I use  the "Cap Collector" perk and boost my Luck stat up with something like  Unyielding Armor (and extremely low health) plus various chems can  increase your Luck.  If you make a good "route" with a half dozen cap  stashes along the way, you could get over 500 caps per day from stashes  alone.
---
I don’t know, but A LOT of players are doing it. Also, it’s all in their stash. All that  useless weight. Wow.
---
A new vita
---
I've been trying to find these forever. I sadly gave up the search, then one day while in Whitesprings,  what do I find in a suitcase????? A deathclaw hide.  Woo hoo!!! I now have 1 of 5.
---
This is probably an unpopular opinion here so be gentle. As some one who has played a lot of fps games some issues that I see needing fixed with pvp in this game are unfortunately at the core of the fallout franchise. Vats builds dominate pvp but are a literal aim bot. Chameleon and stealth boys need to be on a cool down. Berry mentats are a glorified wall hack. Tesla rifle is way too op for a crowed control weapon. Until these issues are addressed I don't think pvp is going to take off the way the developers want.
---
Try using heavy weapons before you talk about using ammo fast, I love my explosive 50. Cal but man dose it waist
---
There’s a mountain between Red Rocket Mega Stop and the cabin above it that usually spawns a deathclaw and an egg if you’re looking for hide, or you could just server hop at deathclaw island. That would be a lot less time-consuming than searching poop piles 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Check out the Modify Armor/Weapon combat challenges. They easily granted me around 400 Atoms just by applying and removing the armor/weapon paints. Once you  do it for weapons the challenge will ask for blunt/edged/one handed and then two handed weapons :)
---
I tried that but got pissed when 4 Gulpers fell through the ground and I couldn't loot them until they were meat piles.  I think Bloody Mess was the reason they fell through so i might try that again without that perk.
---
What the fuck did I just read, a stream-of-consciousness psych eval?
---
Furious
---
Thx for all the replies. :)
---
Deathclaws don't drop their own hides for some dumb reason.  Otherwise I would do this.
---
The only thing about Muties in FO4/FO76 is the lack of intelligent ones. Yeah I know it's a west coast thing but I love Graham and Strong and I wish there were more of that!
---
Actual DC’s don’t drop them.  Because that would make sense.
---
I use chems to make my daily quota at vendors with ease. Get travelling pharmacy in Strength, Pharma farma in Luck. Hit up places like Morgantown Airport, Fort Defiance (personally favorite farming spot for chems), Harper's Ferry, Arktos can be a good spot for lower levels (not the dungeon) and that place in Charleston where you get the vaccine for the scorch plagued early in the main questline, forget the name.
---
If ya know how to make grape mentats, all it takes is mutfruit, mentats and whiskey, and you should easily make your quota with plenty of chems left over. If you have Chemist in Intelligence and Super Duper in Luck, you can hit up tick locations and craft blood packs from their blood sacs and turn them into stimpaks. And sell those.
---
Grey Tortoise. Great Tortoise never changes.
---
I would like to see a limit on how many dollars people could have - say, 100 Million for an individual and 10 billion for a corporation - once you reach the limit the rest are given away.
---
... yes?
---
Platform?
---
I  can sometimes get over 100 caps at one single "Cap Stash", if I'm lucky.

---
Casual underarmour are t-shirts and slacks, military fatigues, flannel shirt, and jeans, and the underarmour options sold in the atomic shop (the highschool sports uniforms, the black tactical underarmour). You can find casual underarmour at Responder vendors and as clothing in the world
---
I’m not saying the “fix it later mentality” isn’t bad, but I actually think The Division 2 point is actually a terrible point of Matty’s video. That isn’t really a valid comparison to make. The Division 2 had the advantage of being a sequel. They had already gone through all the difficulties of making a live-service game with the first Division, which was bad at launch just like the many other live-service games that was mentioned in the interview. It makes way more sense that a developer who had already gone through the fire of developing a live-service game would be able to do a better job the second time than it does to expect an exclusively single-player RPG studio to completely nail a transition to an online game without any issues on their first try.
---
For real?? Honestly, I’d never paid any attention to what I was picking up off of them except for the gears. I guess I’m not really surprised since it’s Fallout. 😂 What do you need the hide for?
---
Especially people who turret farm in pacifist mode
---
You forgot to put “*Speaks Chinese*” on the liberator.
---
Prepare to have your mind blown. How to max your caps on 5 characters in less than 3 weeks:
---
1. Buy a mutation serum. This is the hard part, as they are expensive unless you can get it from a player. To get funds for this I suggest farming mutants for plastic / steel / rubber with Scrapper on at West Tek or other areas, and selling any legendaries you get there.
---
2. Farm or buy materials for that serum. Choose wisely - some are easier to farm for than others.
---
3. Craft a bunch (like a few hundred) with Super Duper on.
---
4. Have a friend help you transfer them and distribute evenly over all 5 of your characters.
---
5. Log in every day on each character and max out your vendor caps by selling 3-4 serums to hem for 300-450 caps each. Hard Bargain / Grape Mentats helps here. This is 1400 caps per character per day.
---
6. At 1400c per day, you'll cap every character on caps within 18 days. 3 weeks and you have 125K caps.
---
The materials bought from players cost significantly less than what the serums vendor for, so even if you need to reinvest some of your earnings, you'll make profit overall. The time investment isn't huge - 15 minutes per day is all it take to log in on each character and max out vendor caps. Anything else you make is just extra.
---
Here's an idea, once a player passes level 100, and most likely have all the perks they're going to need for a build, let them start trading duplicate or unwanted cards for something. More XP in case they're still building, maybe a few Atom points. Even caps.
---
Or just let people delete them. Whatever. But holy crap, do something with the clutter.
---
What are those good for?  The Fake Sheepsquatch event?
---
That's awesome!  That's one more than me.  I'll have to add suitcases to the list.  Gulpers, Scorchbeast poop, Super Mutant meat piles, Yellow Crates, and now Suitcases.
---
Resist the urge. Seriously.
---
Learn not to care about those things. Don't give in to this type of superficial coercion. Realize how manipulative (and pejorative) this business practise truly is. And keep in mind the actual price tag.
---
Don't get worked up. Just ignore it! It doesn't matter. At all. Enjoy the game for what it is.
---
What are they for ?
---
I've dug up robot, marine and leather dense PLANS from treasure maps, so I have to assume that the combat and metal ones (the two I have yet to learn) are also available from the dig sites.
---
If your doing PvP Full Auto is the way to go. PvE I use a semi.
---
I have seen and used the same method with serums before. I can make and trade Herbivore and Chameleon Serums
---
So it is nearly as expensive as the entire game....
---
Yeah that's a pretty good shot, like an actual pro photographer took it. My photos look more like cheese adds for Power armor or war time photos taken my a meth head.
---
I always use hairtrigger or tweaked automatic with any faster fire rate legendary
---
You have to scrap 5 for a badge.  I think it's the Possum badge,  Leatherwork.  They are next to impossible to find.
---
I'm sitting on 80+ improved repair kits (free from SBQ event) and the number just keeps going up. I can't use them fast enough. I'll be dropping them soon to free up carry weight. It's such a non issue end game. And they're really just a convenience thing during leveling. I've never used a regular repair kit. F that noise. I don't spend money on the atom shop.
---
IIRC, its enlist, train at mcclintock, get the certificate, do the DMV quest to get a military ID, go where you need to register for BoS, do whats required to register, then you can get the plan.  
---
Its not a drop - you have to know where to check for it after registering.  
---
you do not need a military ID to get into the Enclave bunker proper.
---
I did find an old thread here that said yes, you have to complete mcclintock to get into the military wing.
---
I can imagine that, sure. 
---
Something that puzzles me though is why so many players run Bloodied in the first place. Of course weapon damage is highest but other than once in a while, when do you need Bloodied-level damage? 
---
Even at full health and base weapon damage my max level weapons waste L68 Mutants, Scorched and ghouls. 
---
Just to make things interesting I’ve started playing around with lower level weapons. Atm I’m using a L15 Crossbow! It’s Instigating so most of the time I’m still one-shotting top level mobs but things do get fun if I miss my sneak bonus. 
---
I imagine than a Bloodied Lever at 20% health would just mow down anything so easily it would take all the fun out of it. Not so? Not at all wanting to argue, genuinely curious here.
---
We don't know. Watch the E3 presentation and maybe we will know or perhaps an Inside The Vault as we get closer.
---
I'm only level ~12 and saw my first legendary. 
---
A level 50 legendary sheepsguy, that crawled out of the ground and then killed me. Fun times.
---
There's one other intelligent super mutant in 4 that escaped from the enclave. The nightkin were cool, we do need those back.
---
Yeah but I actually collect limited time power armor skins. I was thinking once they add PA displays someday I can display a power armor paint mueseum
---
Honestly man, it’s just the luck of the shot. I take and delete a lot of photos and they don’t all turn out like this haha
---
I always get so mad when strangers give me so much cash that my wallet is too fat to fit in my pocket!
---
I've got 2 so far and I had stocked up legends that took 3 people 15 days to break down lols
---
though I really like my Furious exploding lever action so I feel it was worth it
---
That skin isn't worth the 18$ they want for it though. That is nearly how much the game itself costs. Just wait for it to go on sale, or download one of the mods on the nexus that makes your PA look like it for free.
---
Either this, or turrets need to engage enemies at a meaningful range. I can't put my camp between Summersvilla and Lakeside Cabins anymore because super mutants keep shooting up my camp from so far away that I have to use a long scope to see them! They are literally not rendered on my ps4 unless I look at them through a long scope, but they can take out all of my terrets and crops with laser-accurate shooting from so far away that my camp doesn't display for players at that distance. It's just annoying and adds nothing.
---
Also make it to if youre plants are outside in the "winter" they can die
---
I love the like 4 guys who down vote any suggestion to try and hide them
---
Possum badge challenge to scrap 5 deathclaw hides.
---
Well I doubt they'll speak about that
---
You mean your three Scorchbeasts? ;)
---
I have found them in the green footlockers, burlap sacks, creatures killed in the mire(this one is  super rare), and in super mutant meat sacks. Hope this helps everyone's searches.
---
I thought it was just my kid! Confession time...
---
I play with my son who’s 13 and, while he’s branched out from Dad and made friends of his own in the game, he still begs for junk....all the time. It’s embarrassing to hear him on his mic asking for screws so he can finally finish Miner Miracles...
---
I’ve been casually dropping hints that no one likes a mooch but anyone with a kid this age knows that you have to make them think your idea is their idea or they’ll do the exact opposite of what you want.
---
Why not just start everyone equal and disable level ups? Also no legendary effects. Everyone stays equal and relies on skill only. Then again that takes all the perks out of playing survival. Xp boost and the weekly challenge weapons to carry over to adventure would be gone.
---
So right, forgot to say remove mutations..
---
In it's current form it's really showing off of who found the greatest mods and add-ons.. not that your skilled.. Of course there are those that are truly skilled but we will never know in it's current form.
---
Yes.  Its viable.  I have a sniper build.   Level 220+.    Yes.  You should get a few mutations when you can get class freak maxed and starched genes maxed.  The mutations that are 100% neccessary are.  Eagle Eyes, Healing Factor and Marsupial.  Camelion mutation is good,  but if you can get armor with that effect is better.  
---
I usually sneak everywhere and use an explosive silenced sniper weapon.  3.5 damage bonus.  Love my level TSE for this.  
---
I use marsupial to jump onto ledges so enemies can not get at me and i snipe them.  If you are in an area with other players, please put your character in pacifist mode.  People have a bad habit of running in front on me and i dont want to trigger PVP with a Tank at close range.  Never worked out for me.
---
More and more extremely good points about this nonsense. Hopefully someone might see this and re-evaluate their plan because I’ve been on for 10 minutes and have gone to 2 camps like that!!! And one had .38 and 5.56 ammo for 3 caps a piece! What are you guys smoking with these prices!!??
---
.50 mg too, just has the heavy barrel.
---
Every suggestion helps.  :)
---
That's all I ever hear as well, so I definitely appreciate it!  Makes me feel a bit more confident that I can get in, do what I need to do, then just get out.
---
I think damage per shot is more useful for maximizing the number of weaker enemies that can be neutralized by one shot.  But for bigger, tougher enemies that dont swarm, damage per second is more handy.
---
Yeah but you should be able to glean if it is in a different time period.
---
Wow, I had no idea... thank you.
---
I agree. I just wish- given that they seem to be more intelligent and have more personality than the Vault 87 or Institute strains- that more of them were non-hostile. Or that, alternatively, there was some sort of quest line in which we'd encounter the mutant in charge of their army. Would be cool if in the future- in the Wastelanders expansion maybe- we could kill the leader of the super mutant army and as a result they splinter and small communities/factions of friendly mutants start forming.
---
Where?
---
You guys are perfectly entitled to downvote, but can you help me as well? Any information would be appreciated
---
There is a Google sheets list on this reddit somewhere that has that with all mods included. You can try searching and see if you find it.
---
Each one might specialize in a stat but compromise another stat. Not 100% sure but I feel like I heard marine is the best all around maybe. I use combat personally for all around durability and I don’t see myself changing that anytime soon.
---
I kinda figured it would be a massive hot mess so the lack of syncing would be a bonus.
---
it... it really doesn't cost that much.
---
you got to pull the trigger tighter.. your pew's are becoming peeew's
---
Sounds fun I just got a Bloodied Explosive Mini Gun. I would just laugh if it was my camp it's  just part of  Survival Mode. Just like in Adventure mode the Scorchbeast that spawn sometimes at my camp and destroy it that's just part of the game.
---
For each playthrough, I always built an Iron Man-style Hall of Armor for my collection.  A big box, four stories tall, with armor displays all around the edge on each level.
---
Would definitely be an ideal way of introducing BoS radiant quests into the fold for some faction cred.
---
I have frogs in my stash, I believe three of them. I stashed them because I found them in the wild,  option was "catch a frog" or something like that. They don't spoil, like hunted meat does. I think they're beautiful and unusual critters.
---
Why not go to the spot that you have to "make friends with a Deathclaw" for Rose?
---
Also randomly in Whitesprings grounds just past the laundry room area.

0.0 
---
This isn't how the world works for some very good reasons.
---
Marcus is one of my favourite characters in the series. 
---
How cool is it that he and a BOS paladin (forget his name) met and fought each other, but decided it was futile and out of their friendship formed a community for all. 
---
Also love how the car is in NV, which must have been how Marcus made it into the Mojave.
---
A few, but he also gets blown away regardless because he's obnoxious and usually gives me trash I don't want or need.
---
Yeah that is it. That event isn't worth caps.
---
I hate to say it, but posting these detailed ideas ensure they won’t be implemented.  Unsolicited ideas are usually ignored on purpose to avoid the possibility of someone suing for IP theft or copyright infringement or similar.
---
The more detailed, the more it has to be avoided.
---
Very BAD reasons, actually.
---
another cry baby. Pay to win - who cares
---
We really need better communication. Take top 3 mentioned items each week (start with the top 20 all time since this has never been done) and just give answers:
---
Designated fast travel points:  what does Bethesda think?
---
Perk card loadouts:  what does Bethesda think
---
Better view of what vendors are selling:  what does Bethesda think?
---
These same concerns keep coming up because communication with the customer sucks.  Just say “we have to balance fast travel mats with walking into a trap.  We think It’s a “be careful what you wish for” scenario, so tell us what you think via this poll right here...
---
Something, anything, even nixing perk card loadouts because it doesn’t fit their “vision” of the game.  Just throw your customers a bone on occasion.  If refrigeration is coming to the atom shop, or not at all, explain why (such as:  we think spoiling items is a part of the core gameplay, so we want this to be limited).
---
I’m hoping that they are holding back a lot to give some thunder to E3 announcements.
---
oh okay thanks! 
---
I also rock the CB armor atm because it has quite equal stats in DR and ER.   
---
I just wanted to know if I could make my built a little stronger somehow.
---
I just havent had any luck with treasure maps...and im all out of em. If i had more id keep going, but most people want quite a bit for them now
---
Oh cool. Thanks! I will try that
---
How does he have so many bloatflys on the CAMP?
---
Hmmmmmmm true I hope it involves a quest or new section
---
Uncle Leo in Fallout 3 was so cool, and I felt so protective over him. You could be awful to him, but I never was. I lost hours and hours of gameplay when I found him dead in an encounter and had to revert to an older save lol.
---
You sir, ARE then a truly skilled pvp!  and you do scare me!
---
&lt;every one stands to salute your REAL skills&gt;
---
I hope I don't run across you when I sneak into the survival servers for my lil' challenges.
---
I would pay $5.99 for this DLC.
---
Do you enjoy the economy and multiplayer aspect of the game? Cause otherwise this game is a hot pile of steamy trash, and this is coming from someone who loves this game and cant stop playing.
---
You can get a recap on google, as the only “story” in this game is terminal logs and holotapes, which you might as well save time and read something off google.
---
Do you think the bots have a database of all military service members or network access that still works to an outside network that does? That seems highly unlikely given that they are working off of ID cards.
---
That just indicates that Lucky Miner is that player's active quest.
---
eyy looks nice man!
---
No idea, maybe he found a static spawn for them or just kites them back to his base?
---
Thank you kanye, very cool.
---
-If you use your perk points before level 50, do not max out any of your cards. You’ll regret it later trust me. 
---
-remember you have to equip the cards. 
---
-scrap weapons when you find them. That’s how you learn to upgrade what you use. (If you use a hunting rifle, scrap other hunting rifles) 
---
-put the vendor in your camp and put like 1 bobby-pin or something in it to sell for a lot of money. Your camp can not be destroyed by griefers if you have stuff to sell. 
---
-scrip your legendaries that you don’t like/can’t use in the machine until you are level 50. That way when you finally reach the level, you’ll have a lot of points to spend at the vender in Berkeley. (The best legendaries are level 50) 
---
-SCREWS AND SPRINGS!! 
---
-save the making an excavator power armor until you’re level 40+. 
---
-save the mayor of watoga quest till you are level 50.
---
I'll try to farm them from Deathclaws.  From what I've read on this sub, Deathclaws don't drop Deathclaw hides though.  But it won't hurt to try.
---
He just got 3 or 4 explosive weapons all at once
---
Yeah but they weigh a pound each!
---
Doesn’t matter as it doesn’t count if you get it from a player, you need to ‘find’ it..
---
Lol no I havent sold my backpack mods
---
Swing speed!

Plenty of YouTubers make lore videos.

widgeontv is one.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
There's a load screen in game that pretty much states that CA is "second only to power armour".
---
What jet pack you need? You on xbox?
---
I thought they did, not 100% sure as I don't go after them on purpose lol
---
My experience with the "Heart" is... you don't need to use anything special in terms of weaponry. Particularly now, as it's been rather nerfed unfortunately. 
---
The chance of a Legendary add being spawned is super-low (at least when doing it solo), the number of adds per wave is like 2, 2-4, 6, 1 (Boss) &amp; *maybe* 2-4 adds...
---
The boss so far for me, which I think even counts the one time I joined when 3 others were there, I don't think spawns as a Legendary anymore and is just a typical "Boss". Either a lvl 40 Strangler Grafton Monster, or a lvl 50 Strangler Mirelurk Queen.
---
Even then, the event is VERY scripted... I mean more so than any other, because it limits the damage you can do every hit on the Heart in order to ensure that there is A) enough time between waves to not glitch and B) so that you don't just 1-shot it lol So whether or not I'm standing next to it and punching with my Bloodied Power Fist that (with no Melee/Unarmed perks, except Radicool which I use for carry weight lol) does &gt;500dmg, or using my lvl 35 "Instigating +10% DMG while Aiming" Hardened Handmade (with 8 Rifleman and Adrenal Reaction) which does ~111dmg... The amount of health I take off is the same... The long and short of it is: There's a max amount of damage you can do per-hit, so using something fancy isn't necessary. 
---
My tactic has thus been, before the event kicks off completely to simply jump up onto a root "spire" that's high enough to keep me out of melee range **and** is far enough away from the Heart to keep me out of range from the Radioactive Spray it releases *OR* just use PA and not worry about either. Then I shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot until it PHYSICALLY has closed and not taking damage (I ignore the event text), at which point I take out the Adds. It opens, rinse, repeat x2. Then you're on the last bit of health and "blah blah there's a tremor detected, look out" which is when the Boss spawns... **but** I keep shooting the Heart until its dead and *then* I go after the Grafton Monster/Mirelurk Queen, finally cleaning up any further adds if there were any.
---
But yea, it had gone from a guaranteed 3 Legendary Items event through the spawned Legendary Add, Legendary Boss, and Event Reward).... to a guaranteed 1 Legendary Item from the Event Reward (usually armor, and IIRC just 1*). 
---
**TL;DR -** They nerfed the event and it's super easy to solo if you're a lvl 70 or more (as I figure by then you'll have decent gear, especially now with Murmgh and player vendors), but the only point to do it is for the now solitary Legendary item (maybe 2 if lucky) to Scrip, and for the ***minuscule*** chance at getting the infamous Leather Coat that can drop from any Mire Event (which after dozens, I've personally never gotten). Just bring 10 Stimpacks, an Antibiotics, maybe a Rad-X or just your T-60/X-01/Ultracite PA, and something cheap but hard hitting like a Hardened Handmade/Lever-Action or Railway Rifle with 100-150 rounds of ammo... You should be fine. heh
---
&gt; only fix is backing out of the build menu and reentering.
---
If you do backoutand retry is there anything you still can't do?
---
&gt;... see and odd foundation or a wall piece stuck in mid air for no apparent reason
---
I think this might be the answer..---^
---
No worries. Ah likes what ah likes.  Not necessarily a frog fan IRL, but they're so purrty!
---
It is highly unlikely that ALL military records are held by Modus. The way fallout computing works it would require an insane amount of holotape to store all of that in a bunker where they were far more interested in more important things that enlisted personnel.
---
what i would do to have a gunner sight on my Ma Deuce
---
My all-time favorite super mutant line: "Heeeere human, human, human! I have a treat for you!"
---
where was the person "turret farming" ? they have made it so you cant do that behind the gold club...
---
odds are the person just had turrets to defend thier base from random baddies
---
I’m sure it’s common knowledge but you know if you have the small letters plan it has words like weapons, armor, chemicals, etc. 
---
Back to your request, I do believe neon would be awesome! Maybe allow us to pick the color as well?
---
Depends on your build
---
Those wall would not stand for long... they were pacified... this is wierd!
---
&gt;...placement restrictions on building parts ...  
---
&gt;  have been made stricter
---
ahh.. That is clearly understood. thanks.
---
Yeah because screw giving people a reward for innovation and work amirite
---
Isn't that Adventure mode without pacifist on?
---
Survival seems to be a conceptual misfire. The combat style is more suited to small arenas, a sort of Thunderdome style skirmish.
---
What they should have done is introduced this as a mode where everyone starts over, food is scarce, water is scarce, medicine is scarce. Hunger, thirst, and disease are more debilitating. Basically, all things we imagine when we think of a survival game. If anyone has played The Last of Us on harder difficulties, you know what I mean.
---
The biggest problem I have with Survival is that build and loot imbalances ruin it. I would have preferred the kind of survival where are more drawn out, leading to sustained injuries, the sort of event where even if you win, you may have had bones broken (leading to slower walk speed or poor aim), or you're bleeding (leading to gradual HP loss over time - and perhaps new crafting items like med kits, heavy bandages). 
---
But in it's current form, a half-second battle with someone using PA and explosive weapons has little intrigue for me. Now, I'm not saying this kind of Space Marine combat doesn't have a place. It could have been a separate mode, or possibly integrated with the survival I described, but as a sort of gladiator ring that maybe you come across in the wasteland and fight other players who have been given similar, balanced weaponry and armor. Thunderdome style. Two enter, one leaves.
---
I really hope something like that is added. I like robots and robot building, and something like that would be great.
---
You can kite the mobs if you turn and shoot while running.
---
I sent bethesda a message saying I’ve been playing since beta and it’s still the 24th of f*#!ng October please can you fix this... didn’t get a response
---
How do you plant inside? Without glass walls?
---
Okay thanks for the info I will put it in storage.
---
I thought they made it so houses were invulnerable even in survival?
---
or do you mean you have already aggroed the owner?
---
Out of curiosity, has that been tried? I know buying things you have to collect won't work for the challenges, but this challenge is to scrap a hide.
---
Nuclear Winter is coming.
---
I played a LOT of Destiny and Destiny 2 on PS4. The best PUGs I ever had in those games included someone under 14. The worst PUGs I ever had in those games included someone under 14. It's a crapshoot. Like adults, there are nice kids and asshats. I think the big difference is that when they are young, they generally don't have enough life experience to have much of a filter on what they say and do, so when they tend toward asshattery, it's cranked up to 11. Still, I have had some really good experiences playing online games with "squeakers". It just depends.
---
Same here.  It only makes sense.  It was probably an oversight they weren't added.  The hides are rare so maybe they do drop.  I have next week off.  I'll go Deathclaw hunting.
---
Is it right next to Site Alpha? If so I was there the other day.
---
Nicely done.
---
My one encounter talking with a younger player went well. I was at my Camp, he was there shopping, and he politely asked if I had any Fusion Cells he could buy. I was saving mine for myself, but figured why not I could spare some and sold him 100-ish for 50 caps.
---
how do you even know what they have purchased or not purchased?
---
Enclave bunker vendor 👍
---
"The only good bug is a dead bug!"
---
I always have extra bone and rotten meat.
---
Yeah I tested it with someone
---
What is then? I got 10+27 of them because all the time I got nothing else to buy. 
---
I buy 3 star weapons from players for 1k whenever I can, which isn't often.
---
Ya I know, but they lack the p'nash I feel like a waster run shop needs. And no descriptive words, that's really what sparked the thought for me. I have a discount legendary bin but can't delete nearly enuff things to even write "cheap"... I may go abit overkill on decor :P
---
You can't make a paint for all armor types, that's not the way modeling works (well, *maybe* solid color paints, but I'm not too sure about that either).  They could make a style that matches for each armor type, but that isn't one skin, that's a whole set of skins, and that's a LOT of work.
---
? that is not at all what i asked...
---
Bummer. Those hides seem so impossible to find
---
I still want a drill that "scares" robots away and sends them fleeing.
---
Them Carnivore is your answer!
---
I've picked up a couple of legendary ones along the way, two were garbage but one is a Quad, and sure enough you can load up 4 times the number of charges...that's a lot of fun.
---
I think it's other effect is improved bashing...kind of funny running around beating things to death with a severed head though.
---
Oof
---
Worth testing again to be honest..
---
I always opt for damage vs. fire-rate. Just for ammo efficiency sake. I mean until a certain level I was crafting ammo constantly.
---
im the kind of "all-around" type of player
---
I personally spend my caps on holotape games from other players.
---
If you’re on Xbox, I’ve got a bunch of them and you can have one.
---
Oh I forgot bloody mess
---
I haven't played through FO3 yet but I love friendly Muties, it was my favorite part of finally playing NV.
---
Well, down the hill or to the west of the resort you can make camps. You can still pull the ghouls to them, just gotta turn and shoot a few times to get them to the base.
---
The story is terrible and badly executed (boring). 
---
 Events, exploring, looting, fighting the critters of the wasteland is where it's at.
---
You are better off watching a recap video from a YouTuber.
---
I haven't noticed that one yet! I might not have been way off track then. thanks!
---
I've seen the odd one in player vendors but if you check out the Enclave Armoury vendor I find that one pops up fairly regularly for sale. Just need to be sure and check it out now and then until you find them if you don't find one at a player.
---
Seems wildly off topic.
---
It doesn't matter how far the base is. You can keep the aggro of the mobs if you keep shooting them
---
I was just thinking this. Thanks for the reminder!
---
I’d still keep one repaired one on hand JIC you lose the one you carry on you
---
Yep, go past the homes and that putting green or go past the service entrance around to the VIP homes. Same spot.
---
Do you keep high health? Are you more melee or longer distance shooter?
---
Legendary armour, weapons
---
Plans/Drops for the new events people no longer show up for &gt;&lt;
---
I've had this problem since launch... I find this issue is more prevalent when objects are closer to the foundation of my home. Like for instance, if I have a trashcan or plants close enough to the building, it won't allow me to re-select them for editing/deletion. I'm stuck with leaving them as they are, and repairing them if destroyed or moving my camp. I've sent in bug reports and screenshots in the past, but I've had no responses.
---
"but anyone with a kid this age knows that you have to make them think your idea is their idea or they’ll do the exact opposite of what you want"
---
Not everyone knows, just the smart parents.
---
Ahh thanks! I've had issues with finding them at enclaves, was hoping there was a more reliable location or even better, a player would be selling them(and cheaper than the enclaves 6k for it)
---
Yea, that may very well be what I was remembering. I know I've read the terminals you're referring to. Still, though... in the back of my head I still feel like I may have read something that indicated the US deploying them for the reasons I mentioned, pre-war.
---
Maybe I'll try and dump all the Terminal related files from the FO76 game archives, then process them through Notepad++ to point out which ones mention those bots specifically, and read through them. I know the Quest files are *partially* readable with the Strings generally in English and not coded, but I'd assume the actual terminal files would be in plain-text files (pretty sure the subtitles are, so it wouldn't be a leap for these to be as well).
---
No, Adventure mode isn't challenging from a PvE standpoint. I'd like a challenging PvE mode. Challenge doesn't have to = pvp. Ever play FROST or Horizon from Fallout 4? That's what we want.
---
I just like to steam through enemies lol. And i hate farming ammo. But it gets booring sometimes
---
I just love the scout armor so much. So I wanted to see how much protection I would miss out if I went back to using it. Without having to buy it first (since not all parts are buyable at 1 time, unless you're lucky)
---
If they had locked water purifiers and were selling water at 20 each, I think I’d spend the next couple of hours kiting enemies to their camp.
---
Yea verily, may thee soon be granted the pleasure of hefting the Vampire Dragon to thine shoulder...
---
They are start pvp. You need to be able to defend yourself. That being said, you shouldn’t have lost many if any resources as workshops give you some materials to use without using your own. Also build a stash and store your junk as you get it that way you don’t lose it on death. But I’ll be honest I’m level 315 and I’ve never captured a workshop for the resources they give,.
---
I am genuinely happy that some younger folks are playing this game. Kids don't bother me at all,  you get a chance however briefly to see something through younger eyes again.
---
Workshops flag you for PVP, at any level. Once you initiate a claim, even a level 5 could contest it and attack you.
---
Of course they're usable. You just got beat down by a high level layer who wanted it.
---
I held three workshops for about three hours the other night, just harvesting copper and lead. And then... along came a high level player who decided he wanted one.
---
That's just how it goes. When you know you're outclassed and outgunned... sometimes it's best to just cut your losses.
---
my endurance is 7 and im a semi-auto rifle build :D
---
Hey any chance you can link your build and talk about what pistols you are using, armor, mutations and any other advice
---
Demolition expert has no effect on legacy weapons.
---
i didn't claim my first workshop until lvl 131.   
---
for the most part, you are left alone...but there are people out there that will punish low levels for taking workshops.  It just sucks that you can't really defend yourself against these guys...but that's the game.
---
Backing out only fixes the "intersects with another object" error, it does not fix the "cannot remove" bug
---
It seems like a lot of posts critical of 76 get a bunch of downvotes early on, but usually recovery shortly after.
---
Yea it usually happens sometime after the nuke over whitesprings clears and more ppl hope to refresh the enemies. I love it when you get the robots, except most or all legendaries are protectrons with wheels and are fast. And when you kill them they explode, makes for scary suicide bombers. But it's hilarious when they all try rushing you from the downstairs steps and they slowly waddle up at you
---
Never. I have spidey senses.
---
My level 5 2 shot a level 100 in pa with a regular hunting rifle on survival. PA is really underpowered there. It needs a buff badly.
---
fuck tse aae is the way to go
---
Do you keep your health maxed?
---
That would do it lol .... yeah if over repaired will definitely take a bit longer. 
---
If just repaired normally, you can repair every 10 shots or so. Even on low enemies. Doesn't really take much to get 1% dmg on the weapon to be able to repair again.
---
Well I was born and raised here. So yeah SA accent and lol yes I speak Afrikaans 😂
---
&gt; p'nash
---
😂
---
The word you're looking for is panache.
---
Heat lamps or sky light bruh I mean they can spoil why not implement the actual winter weather a fallout 4 mod did it
---
Yeah. Marine is supposed to be the strongest armor there is short of power armor, and yet nobody I play with uses it. It's combat armor or bust.
---
Semis are easier to control, unless you are able to exercise good trigger control for bursts of no more that 3-4 shots on full autos.
---
Pc🙏🏼
---
Antibiotics, Stimpaks in general.
---
I'll buy Mentats and Whiskey if I see them really cheap for crafting Grape Mentats.
---
I'll also buy Calmex if not outrageously priced.
---
I play solo.  Before the survival mode was released, there was a contingent that 'role played as raiders' ( i.e. - griefers ).  I ran into a couple of them and it wasn't fun.  Since then I've role played as a 'lone wanderer' and actively avoid other players.  
---
Because of this I'm not sure I will ever get my backpack because of the 'revive an ally'' requirement ( which I think is BS but it is what it is ).  I suppose I should try teaming up again at some point.
---
Bobbleheads are always being bought everytime I put them out there. I sell em for 50 caps
---
Workshops are possible PvP zones so occasionally someone will exercise that option. They aren't level dependent themselves. Not sure how you lose caps though. Fast travel fees?
---
Have people tested this or is it rumor?
---
I held two at level 54 for about 4 hours last night. Only set up junk extractor's no turrets. No one bothered me.
---
I got a great laugh from this challenge. I was lucky enough to have my husband follow me around and let me take very odd pictures of him. (Posing naked in front of vault 76 then fighting a liberator).
---
I mean how can we go into winter with the same god dam date
---
I didn't even bother submitting my ticket for my replacement bag. I didn't even know the bag was part of the package. I bought it for the helmet.
---
My homeboy Graham and Moomoo always brighten my day, so that's a +1 from me.
---
I would buy rad-shield and rad ant lager
---
Very well tested.
---
Whats LAR ? Lazer anti rifle ?
---
lost caps every time I died
---
I really wish it happen more often
---
Awesome! I'll have to check it out! I'm also on PS4, so I'll add.
---
Well I feel silly. My explosive gatling laser could use other perks to do real damage then.
---
This essentially answers my question, and I figured as much, I was honestly just surprised some high level would give a shit when they could easily just world hop...
---
Sometimes it spawns Liberators. The drops are usually low level one stars but it can be fun too.
---
TSE does suffer from accuracy, but it can be boosted with Demolition Expert.  AAE can't be boosted (and not sure how well it combines with Tank Killer for rifles), but it does hit more often.
---
It's a bit of a trade off.
---
PER: Glow Sight for glowing ones.
---
END: Revenant if you’re reliably revived - +25/+50% extra damage can be HUUUGE.
---
CHA: Tenderizer, Strange in Numbers if you use Adrenal Reaction.
---
INT: Nerd Rage if you can stomach sub 20 health.
---
LCK: One Gun Army for staggers and limb cripplin’
---
You don't have to collect Deathclaw Hides for the challenge. You have to scrap them. Do you have any evidence to back up your claim? Just curious because what you're saying doesn't seem to make sense with regards to the way this challenge works
---
There's a bug where if a foundation is too low or too high it will lock everything in a place.
---
Move the camp so everything is stored.
---
Place 1 foundation.
---
Attach a stairs.
---
If you can store the stairs after attaching, you are good. If unable to remove stairs due to "structure would be inaccessible"... Move camp and start over and adjust the height of the foundation block and try again.
---
Thanks, some great ideas for me!.
---
The sheepsquatch isnt real this is clearly a yao guai on its hind legs
---
I found a much easier way to get the max caps each day without the need for flux
---
1) simply head to huntersville, which is inbetween whitesprings and watoga, but alot closer to whitesprings (which is important)
---
2)clean out all the super mutants. they drop guns and caps, normally takes about 2-3 minutes to kill them all
---
3) server hop, repeat, you only need to server hop 3 times
---
this will net you about 900 pounds of loot
---
4) Walk your overencumbered ass back to whitesprings, it only takes 4-5 minutes as its not that far, there is a nice pass in the mountains that leads directly to whitesprings train station
---
5) profit! sell the loot! with hard bargain 3, some alcohol for CHR boost, grape mentats etc etc you have now reached 1400 caps in under 20 minutes
---
You could go to other places with lots of super mutants like WesTek,  but the slow walk to somewhere to sell the loot is too far away
---
Huntersville is super close to whitesprings so this works great
---
No, read below, I’ve corrected myself.
---
Why cant AAE be boosted? It is also explosive.
---
Yep. You can check for yourself, the weapon damage doesn't change with or without it.
---
When you die to pvp, you lose caps equal to your level.
---
I'm seeing similar on PS4.  
---
Not just WS, but also at (insert name) train station.  
---
Both the vendor bots and legendary vendor machine take some time to load in.  
---
Perhaps coincidental, but also take a long time for my (admittedly, long) list of active quests to appear and fully update the items that are x / y.
---
That's amazing
---
Thanks for the reply. Brings up another thing I've been curious about. How much of a difference does level make in PvP? I know build will of course have a lot to do with it, but does a level 20 have any chance at all against a level 100? What about 80 vs 100?
---
u/coldestgoose
---
Makes sense! During all the hours playing I've never walked into a nuke zone after it has already faded. All the enemies being either diseased or legendary is a very interesting side effect of nuking.
---
Look, we all speak from a place of ignorance sometimes and this...this is your time.
---
But you can't max out more than one of a card? I wanted a collection of all-animated perk cards, but I know for a fact it will not let you max another set, animated or normal, once you already have one maxed.
---
i really hope you are actually a Fallout 76 / Bet Austin dev just venting what plot's / functions  that are coming to us, disguised as a normal player / user, lol :)
---
Good to know.  So then bloodied mess would definitely be the way to go then assuming that bloodied mess works with legacy weapons?
---
The only time someone has ever contested one of my workshops was the ammo factory pre-nerf. I think you've just been a bit unlucky.
---
did not know this, thanks
---
I'm about to check now to see if my suspensions been lifted I hope so
---
So you're definitely going to get one of those pissing fountains made in your name, right?
---
Vampire
---
Fire Rate
---
That’s cool. Though I get all of those weapons to scrap off of corpses after a battle. Even the Gatling gun off of bosses.
---
Patrolling the Cranberry Bog makes you wish for a nuclear winter...
---
Yes, it works with everything.
---
heck, i would even pay some atoms to get a  Automatron dlc for Fallout 76 :D
---
How is PVE any different in Adventure or Survival? It's the same easy to sleepwalk through mobs. The only danger is me and others like me (or you). Please don't get me wrong, I love this game. However, the lack of end game content means PVP is the end game.
---
I'm 248 running a Bloodied/Unyielding stealth Commando build. I inquired about your level as I know that when I was at that stage acquiring the mutations, armor, and weapons I wanted was paramount. Your setup so far looks really solid; remain fluid in your outlook on your SPECIAL and what points land where as your needs will change. 
---
As an example: my SPECIAL used to be S4, P8, E2, C6, I6, A15, L15 and when I hit my 200's I started to transition from Rifleman to Commando. My SPECIAL atm is S2 (Bandolier), P12 (r3 Commando, 1CF, 2TK), E2 (Good Doggy, Radicool), C5 (lone wanderer, r1 Tenderizer), A15 (r3 thru hiker, gun-fu, r1 Sneak, Escape Artist, r3 covert op, and either Mister Sandman + r2 Adrenaline at night and r4 Adrenaline by day), L14 (r3 Bloody Mess, Serendipity, Class Freak, r2 Starched Genes, r3 Better Criticals or Tormentor depending on type of fight).
---
Basically, what I'm saying is don't get too hung up on your build and remain fluid because I believe you can min-max and tweak as you go. As another example I got a great Vampiric Shotgun 3* drop for me so I ranked up Enforcer for the crippling effect which now makes me infinitely more useful in Arktos. :)
---
Doesn't work that way. You have to find the tourist for the quest to trigger in order to repair the camera.
---
They go to the person that killed you. If you don't have enough to cover the debt you get a debuff. I've never had it so I don't know how bad it is but I doubt it's good.
---
Well, they're molemen, so...
---
Cool, thank you for the info!
---
The gold must flow.
---
Thanks,  [Added to Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Armor &amp; Underarmor](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bx3o7l/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_armor/)
---
It's fairly close. On the little blackberry icon on the map above site alpha.
---
Pretty sure they are making these items “limited” because they are taking them out to make way for the nuclear winter stuff. (Hence the chill out theme) but that could just be me hoping they release it soon.
---
I've had to learn that lesson multiple times.
---
Ahhh yeah, /agree
---
That’s a great idea. I’ll give low level players some items as well. I’ve noticed a lot of level 10 or less running around watoga. They must be a second character with high level weapons and jumping over everything.
---
I find damage using hardened plus perks that increase critical damage to be the most efficient build.
---
If, at any time, someone a few levels higher than me can just come along, kill me, and take everything, I wouldn't exactly describe them as "usable" 
---
Knowing what I know now, it's not worth my time to use workshops until I'm a much higher level, I.e. they aren't usable until I am a higher level
---
If you have to "find" it couldnt they put it in a random static container?
---
The wing fragment does work if you buy it from a player. The trick is that you then have to take it to a vendor bot, sell it, then buy it back from them. I did this just the other day and it worked fine.
---
I laughed until I was in danger of peeing a little, so well done.
---
Thanks, man. I really appreciate that. This is like the third rework for Floopwood so I'm glad people enjoy it
---
I found a bunch of  lights and lighted sign just stopped glowing/being illuminated last night for no reason
---
all my power nodes to transmit were still active
---
I had to move the items to another wall, where the worked ok
---
then i moved them back to the same spot they initally didint work
---
then they worked again!
---
weird!
---
that had never happened before last night in all my 5 months of playing
---
My Precious lol
---
I thought you were giving a guide on a existing content. Got me excited and depressed.
---
Unfortunately this would be heavily abused and people would be placing XP farms everywhere.
---
I've noticed the same thing with my melee weapons. So i know for a fact my weapon doesn't miss lol 
---
When i used my sledge I'd hit with 600 or so dmg before, would take 3x or so hits to kill a scorched beast. I can get around 1500 dmg now and it still take the same amount of hits if not more... since my output is at least 2x as much, you'd think number of hits would be reduced...
---
My bobbleheads are between 100-150 caps and they barely move. Maybe I need to decrease my prices.
---
pfft, say hello to my little friend, **ghoul slayers gamma gun**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Thanks! See you soon. I'll have a link later to the vendors this evening or you can just swing by
---
Like trading? You can trade up to 25k.
---
I've seen liberators once and eyebrows a few times always with low level gear sadly.  But the slow marching of the protectrons gets me to laugh.
---
The one that still haunts me to this day is one of the "silencing the voices" locations from FO4. Some family calling out for help over their ham radio. You know the whole time you're tracking it what you're going to find, but when you open that bunker and find a skeleton next to two tiny graves....
---
*shit, man*
---
I was referring to the time machine bit... thank you for tagging it! I've already come across Sanjay's body so that wasn't new to me.. and as you say would not have been a big deal if I hadn't.

Granted the time machine is not that big of a spoiler either and not a huge deal... my comment was kind of the result of a buildup from a few different posts. One spoiler was pretty bad so I was already a little irritated... I honestly should have said that to them and not you! Thanks for being cool about it. :)
---
I would search the subreddit for this same question. We’ve been getting it a lot lately.
---
Major bug fixes. There’s still some server drops, but it’s definitely less frequent.
---
They added a bunch of dlc content that’s pretty cool, but challenging. Like Backpacks are totally worth it, but the Pioneer Scouts quests to get them is insanely long.
---
They also added repair kits to the Atom Shop, so you can fix your gear without collect like 50 ballistic fiber.
---
I have been trying the unarmed melee build. I find it really fun, but have had a little trouble staying alive.   
---
Do you utilize stealth to stay out of combat, and if things hit the fan, is it just relying on serendipity occuring to keep yourself alive?
---
Alright.
---
I gotten the shielded lining for raider armor twice now. It drops from the Census Violence event as a rare reward.

I thought the lore regarding them was pretty sloppy in this game. Huntersville, in particular. I can buy the military running experiments on soldiers with at remote research facilities (such as in Fallout 1), but dosing an entire town with FEV? This isn’t something which might have subtle, and plausibly deniable, changes on the civilians, and West Tek and the military would’ve known that. It risked a public relations nightmare and the kind of scandal that could’ve shut down the FEV project. Utterly nonsensical.
---
True- But it is so freaking loud!!! I’m thinking of changing back to 308 because of it.
---
I'm still relatively low level... 36. and I can't recall, offhand, exactly what I've done, but...
---
I built this character as a "team based medic" type character, but I SERIOUSLY nerfed myself, by maxing my CHA and INT way too early. So now I find myself mid 30s, and unable to add any perks to those two skills.
---
So, my advice isn't gonna be the greatest, to be honest. I'm honestly thinking of rebooting him.
---
AAE is far better especially if you use VATS. Also my ammo expenditure goes way down when I switch back to Riflemen, go bloodied and use a BE Handmade (or AAE for that matter).
---
My friend and I might've been the asshole who did it. Was this on xbox?
---
A true kings pee is always clear.
---
Throw a suppressor on it and it helps!
---
You sir are a god! 
---
I love the humor in your creations just a pity some of the copycats seem to just be malicious ..
---
I wonder if they’d level the drill to 45-50 too, that’d be sweet.
---
Aside from the very satisfying BONK-smackdowns from powerful shovels we got legendary ultracite gatling lasers too, ie green laser lightshows from the faster fire rate effect.
---
Queen of the Hunt daily? That's where I fought my first Mothman. Probably has a chance to be any of the other 'cryptid' mobs though.
---
Making caps is so easy. Just sell everything you can.
---
I had this happen last night. All level 1 eyebots. Scooped up nearly 20 legendaries. PS4.
---
You lucky duck
---
I turn of proximity chat in all games and the worst games are the ones with no mutw option. Honourable mentions go to any game that allows you to mute pre-load screen. Dissapointed jeers go to those that force you to listen to people, even while trying to stream ( Thanks now peole have to edit out racism and profanity if that is not thier thing)
---
I have an AAE handmade and it's boosted by demo expert........lol
---
ah ok i see what you are saying
---
Hey, suit yourself... but, as I stated, I harvested 3 workshops worth of copper and lead for HOURS... I'd say that's pretty damn usable.. and my build is near useless in PvP. 
---
If you define "usable" as "I get to keep this forever and every fight must be winnable by  me", well, then... you're just "that guy" to other players now.
---
It's a PvP game mechanic. That's what they are.
---
Stability is way better than it was before.
---
There is Biv, a robot that gives you daily quests that include making and or drinking tons of different types of alcohol.
---
There is also backpacks now and with it comes the entire pioneer scout questline to earn them.
---
Stash capacity is currently at 800.
---
There is a new "boss" fight where you fight a really powerful imposter sheepsquatch, which is an assaultron.
---
There is a a bunch of new quests involving finding said sheepsquatch, a main quest and a good bit of side ones.
---
There is a new creature, which is in fact a sheepsquatch.
---
Survival mode is out but PvP in this game is still awkward.
---
They added a place called the Burrows, which offers a pretty cool underground area to fight ghouls in.
---
They added a legendary weapons vendor, where you scrap unwanted legendaries for new ones.
---
They added a repeatable dungeon under Arktos Pharma called, "Project Paradise", where there is a lvl 100 legendary enemy at the end.
---
And also lots of but fixes, I think I named most of the noticeable changes.
---
Ive read heavy metal armor gives the most protection
---
i do get a little frustrated when travelling to a vendor that list "23 weapons" and i get there and they are all non legendary normal weapons
---
Ive triggered that event once when i first discovered it. But since then ive tried many times and failed.
---
Ive walked to it, FT'd to it, server hopped there, but no luck
---
May your end be infinitely better than season 8.
---
That Nukashine set would look real nice next to the bar.
---
Wuss in the wasteland, raider in da sheets?
---
Find a junk pile and build your C.A.M.P next to it then place an extractor on the junk pile and lock it check back every 15-20 minutes you will get a lot of useful junk to build and repair with and also sell.
---
Make sure Pacifist mode is on
---
Play with a mic I help a lot of lower level players it's easier with a mic.
---
White Spring is a good place to level up and get legendary weapons.
---
Doing events is a easy way to get aid items, plans, and armor.
---
If you get stuck or need help ask most players will help you out.
---
You could buy the mods themselves since unless you plan on selling them you won't need to make more than 2
---
Maybe we should have an ability to rate the vendors like a google review. Prices, stock, items. If you sell crap people will be able to see on the map view before they commit to spending fast travel caps.
---
Because a Batlle Royal frenzy seemed a better ideia to them :(
---
Try a refined 50 receiver if you can craft it.  
---
Refined does a bit more damage than hardened 50 receiver
---
Sell everything
---
i agree those non-legendary weapons are cool for vending as they are kinda new and rare-ish
---
Liked it the first time 
---
Loved it again
---
Bethesda, please see above \^
---
good call
---
Bloodied
---
I'm the other asshole who might've done it. We play on xbox. Just want to see if it was us.
---
Swing Speed
---
Maybe I'm too new and dont understand.
---
I may have the materials to craft it, but I just dont see the Tesla coils for my x01 suit. Furthermore I was hoping maybe players would sell the mod/plan/BP cheaper than the 5.7k it says on the wiki
---
I guess if you're already 50+ but anyone trying to do the quests on a newish toon every cap matters. I'm constantly broke af trying to keep ammo and stims
---
LOL ... hey well done!!! All props to the original 8 bit vault boy!!
---
Faster Fire Rate
---
90% of legendaries i get go right into the scrapping machine!!
---
9% i put in my vendor as they are awesome rolls i know peopel want i.e. bloodied,anti armor, explosive, instigating, furious, sentinel and the like
---
1% i keep for myself the really really good stuff
---
When you buy the mod(not the plan) you can attach it to the armor for free even though it lists required materials.
---
U should sell diluted radaway since many people use mutations. But stock up on the basic too. 
---
Stimpacks, super stimpacks, psycho, purified water etc.
---
yeah i usually scrap every piece of normal armor i get to roll the dice for a "learned" mod
---
upgrade to chefs and add blades.
---
Don the chefs hat, and have a rocking and rolling good time.
---
I like my 3\* rolling pin.
---
Oh alright. Well I'm after any iteration available to me, maybe under the 5.7k pricetag. I may just be hopeful being I've not seen it pop up in the shop, and mutations seem to he awfully cheap
---
That also might have been me
---
Is someone there? LOL ......... agreed!!
---
Pb &amp; j? Or ham. I'm thinking about a nice egg salad right now.
---
This happens after someone has run on the ghouls a few times. After you go a few rounds with the eyebots they turn into lvl54 commie blenders.
---
Man I miss the ballistic fist so much
---
Type I have awful luck it seems lol
---
No I dont think you're missing anything, just can't inspect when you're trading directly with another player.
---
I killed a mole miner with a super sledge.
---
Solid work thank you.
---
My camp is a 5 story Jumping Maze with free vendor loot if you reach to the top
---
Mutations used to be really expensive but once people recouped their investment and a lot more competition came in prices dropped like a rock. There's just not a lot of demand for pa mods other than jetpacks.
---
I wish I was better at taking criticals.  Really need to work on this skill.  I'm giving up a lot of damage out there.
---
&gt; Please don't get me wrong, I love this game. However, the lack of end game content means PVP is the end game. 
---
And that's a problem, because the vast majority of people that play this game don't really enjoy pvp. There needs to be better pve content. I'm not trying to say that you shouldn't have any pvp mode. I'm fine with that. But those of us who don't see the value in pvp would like challenging, meaningful pve content.
---
Damn, and the jetback is the mod I'm least interested in. I'm a melee guy through and through. The rad explosion when I take damage and the Tesla mod seem like a natural fit for me
---
yeah im pretty sure thats the one where your blood from getting shot gives you rad damage
---
Grats
---
If you're on PC I'll pay 500 caps/unit. Still need 3 and I'm getting tired of killing gulpers.
---
I'll try and swing by to check it out this evening, my PSN is Emerald\_Talon
---
Im presuming its because my CAMP is a jumping puzzle maze.
---
It's not that either, object IDs are not that long. It's an integer overflow. I don't really understand the details but that's the max number of an item the engine can count and sometimes there's an error that displays the number. It's just a display bug.
---
Also chameleon doesn't always work. I have to remove and reapply my chameleon piece to make the effect work.
---
It happens all the time. I've been in PvP and seen people just crouching in a field thinking they are invisible. I've been killed many times cause I thought I was invisible.
---
I’ve lucked out and no one has ever taken a workshop of mine. I’m only a level 22. I have only ran into two ppl who were jerks. Fingers crossed that I didn’t jinx myself now.
---
You can only have one. I bought 70 or so from a player vendor and poof... not cool. Stupid arse bug or INteNDEd feature that needs changing.
---
Okay, man. I'll add you when I update the post later. Thanks for checking it out
---
Every time I find one, I always forget a couple minutes later and accidentally scrap it.
---
In the production room there are terminals, all plans are in there.. granted they are expensive in comparison to mods but if you play in a group regularly then if you each get different plans you can help each other out.. unfortunately this is only as far as I can assist being on PS4
---
Yes I do. I ain’t much into the bloodied builds
---
Oh *God!*
---
*shudder*
---
Hadn't thought of that one in a while. That was just brutal, gah...
---
Then it's just a matter or server hoping or checking every day. Just make sure to check the military wing and production wing vendors.
---
Ps4
---
I play solo sadly, the few friends I did play with left the game for others and I'm just now finishing my character, alone lol
---
That plateau near the munitions factory. Remains of  a makeshift religious gathering.
---
Yeah but the range gets tanked then.
---
LAR = lever action rifle
---
Where...... is the thing I mentioned in the spoiler-tagged portion?
---
It's east of "Abandoned Bog Town" (the workshop). It's hard to miss. At least, so long as you're not expecting something like a TARDIS... lol
---
You can stack up to 4, you will receive more exp and more rewards...
---
They can still implement it for other modes I don't see how that matters battle royal can be good
---
Same with the big bend tunnel.  Start at the east end and kill the scorched to the west end. Lewisburg station is close by.
---
I will give his junk a good home. And I did not knowingly do anything. It was just some mid level dude who died to me. I did not know anything about him.
---
after lv 50 it doesn't matter thst much anymore, maybe just how much the higher lv player plays the game and knows what to do.
---
The people calling for a character reset forget that the people that have the gear play a lot and even if they were forced to switch to a new character they would be left in the dust by the heavy players.
---
Yes there is an issue with heavy geared up players. It is best resolved by balancing weapons, armor, perks, mutations and mutations while providing reasonable damage scaling.
---
That would be more sensible than taking choice from players.
---
Thanks guys

They have had to be removed from the body of the post due to character limitations
---
I find it hard to decide my favourite between the two, but there's something special about three. Four was a massive leap in the wrong direction imo, but I still enjoyed it.
---
Go read patch notes like the rest of us had to
---
People will try and tell you that the more you "collect" the better reward you'll get. Coming from someone that's turned in one and only one tech data at a time, I have all the BoS paints except Initiate and Sentinel. Took about a week of casually grinding the Enclave.
---
Thanks again! I'm at about 3k now so I'm getting there
---
Thank you friend!
---
Bethesda stated with the last update that display cases has been pushed back as they work out stability issues.
---
Bobbleheads, magazines, junk and PA are expected to have their own display.
---
My unpopular opinion to be downvoted by the people that use them is that god weapons need to be nerfed for PVP. Not Environmental mind you, but at least PVP. They need to balance the game to where it takes like no less than 2 or 3 hits to kill max power armor people except in case of maybe strong sneak attacks. It's just too hard to have a good fight against one shotters, I don't want to trip I want to dance
---
I believe it is if you have not done the quest you can have as many as you want once you do the quest you can only have one
---
I'm baffled how many of the bugs are results of misconfiguration in the data files. Why does it take this long to get the missing properties added and the wrong ones changed, especially when their address is made available like your posts? 
---
I did some small modding for Fo4 and Skyrim via the editor and could see how convoluted it is to do things via the underwhelming GUI there. Is it that many developers modify the same files required for this fix, ending up in conflicts all the time? Would many of these changes require to redownload a large chunk of the game again (consoles)? Could their game editor be unable to do such ESM level manipulation and they are limited to some GUI? And lastly, I saw a lot of CUT\_ and TEST\_ entries in the ESM. Would it be too difficult to simply not have those in there, saving on size (and they could use the DLC/extension approach to put in their tools on their dev side)?
---
IE Gauss for long range heavy hits, bloodied handmade for up close / rapid fire
---
Huh? Am I missing something? Please explain.
---
&gt; I searched every site I could find and every single discounted copy was sold out.
---
Discounted game sold out.
---
E3 almost here with new information about content updates.
---
hmmmm.....
---
Can you make stinky meat pies with it?
---
This game and Destiny 2, in particular,  have taught me: if the voice squeaks, GTFO. 
---
The other day this guy invites me to a team and a party chat. “Eh why not?” I say. 
---
Noticed it may be a squeaker, or a girl... maybe both, and they asked if I could help them launch and nuke. Against my better judgement I say ‘yes’. Well, a switch to my heavy gunner character later, ‘we’ are in the last room.
---
Squeaker: “These super mutants are tough!” ........ 
---
“Well wait,” you might say, “there are no super mutants in the nuke silos.”
---
Yup, they weren’t even in there with me.
---
I hope Nuclear winter is infact a new game mode like de F4 winter mod and they add that Battleroyale mode as like a mission/event... These are my hopes...
---
Which might I add, is complete and utter bull that you can't.
---
To be honest, once your'e past level 50, their is hardly any difference. You don't gain extra HP or anything really. 
---
It's mostly the experience and knowledge of how to play along with the obvious - the more you play, the more likely they are to find that god armor and weapons. 
---
That being said, a level 20 can most certainly defeat a level 100+ with the right equipment. Highly unlikely they will ever have the gear, but it is doable. Some of the older players who start new characters make it a point to hook up their new builds with good gear.
---
Be-e-e-e-g if true
---
If you like the Combat Rifle in this build, get yourself a Fixer And eventually the plan to craft higher level ones. It’s become my main gun, I only pull out a legendary handmade for big things like Arktos bosses and the SBQ now—situations where staying undetected is pretty much impossible.
---
If you read the original post you’ll see he addresses this, he layered the walls with paintings
---
i agree with all the other suggestions so far, but dont forget radicool since you will usually have rads help maintain your bloodied status
---
also, as with all builds, "bloody mess" perk card gives that sweet 15% damage boost
---
adrenal reaction and talons mutations will help as well quite a bit
---
Srsly, the bad reviews on 76 were mostly fabricated by people that didn't ay it. It really wasn't that bad, iv played since beta.
---
Walmart has Steelbox version and regular version for less than $30USD
---
Thats a really good idea lol
---
should have mentioned that in the first place, then everything is clear here
---
Why world hop, though. The workshops are literally a PvP area in game. That's 50% of their entire purpose. 
---
Expecting a player to hop worlds just so you get to keep your workshop... makes zero sense.
---
I read that as.. good for bosses and other bullet sponge mobs
---
no?
---
Agree with all of the above, pretty sure he is a rare random spawn....so check those spots....
---
Funny cause I never seen him or  engaged him till about 2 weeks ago, then found him just north of South Mountain Lookout , at that random spawn.
---
Shame cause his fight style and animations are very cool.....
---
He still lost to my Black Diamond *3
---
Got another mothman wing!
---
And some cool pictures of him.
---
ah ok, thank you very much! i appreciate your reply
---
But how much free space do you have?
---
agreed!
---
Oooh, that is \_lovely\_.
---
Bethesda wants to create seasons in survival where players have to create new survival characters every season.
---
damn why the downvotes for asking a question!?!?!?!?!?
---
what are you talking about?
---
I love when people are hellbent on wrecking my base and can't. Wind up tossing Nuka Grenades, using a Fatman, and inevitably relogging so they can take advantage of rendering (which odd enough, must be player-side than server-side.) so they can shoot through my walls/foundations. I always learn something from folks like you.
---
Some day, we'll meet in the wastes.
---
Gamestop disc for 12 bucks
---
Theres like 10 big patch since i last played and i only wanted to know the bigger stuff
---
Not doing as bad as u thought eh lol
---
I get really annoyed when I go to someone's camp and they're just selling random non legendary weapons and armor, even seen people sell max level non legendary items. It's really annoying. But there was one camp I came across that had a vault boy card board cut out and they wrote on it "FOR LOW LEVELS" and THAT, I thought, was pretty damn awesome. They had listed stuff for either suuuuuuuper cheap, I'm talking the highest price was 20 caps. All the weapons were free. Loved that they made it clear who their target customers were
---
After level 55-65 when you have all the perks you need everyone is at the same level. A level 60 can be the same as a level 600
---
Thanks for the info, question however.   
---
How confident are you it is not people using Recon scopes or Berry mentats to bypass the Chameleon effect&gt;?
---
Who are any of you people?
---
I did make a new character cause in the beginning I lost so many caps. My new char is completely different then my old melee guy. And I have some good armor and an ok weapon all procurred with this new char.
---
I am generally higher up on the kills board. I can't dominate but I'm hard to kill.
---
What I'm saying is the people who put the time in will have better gear and be better players. No matter what. And the ability to go into adventure and peruse people's stores is handy. We don't need new characters. I don't want to grind to lvl 60 again.
---
Ah, okay! Then go read patch notes and inside the vault posts. Or do a search on the reddit. A lot of us are tired of people coming here asking about the game instead of researching themselves, so...go do tbat
---
Why don’t you walk it then? It’s not our fault you’re broke 😄
---
I had to hop quite a bit. After I found the first one at the giant teapot, I found three more in the wild in the same server. I was so annoyed, so I kept all the broken prosnap cameras to give to people who are having issues finding their own
---
I also get a Instigating swing speed +1 str Shovel from the vendor. I was so happy about this. But a furious drill? Really?
---
That would be f*cking awesome haha
---
Hey friend, it's me... Powerful Automatic Receiver!
---
I can shoot fast and strong... I even have near identical perk benefits!
---
Just give me a chance
---
got me thinking here. I cant transfer one or more to my stash. just wont let me. ???
---
Am I missing something. just me or, how does one get 70 onto a vending.
---
possibly other reply is correct,once past a certain point. ?????
---
This is basically what Rust has turned into as well. A bunch of toxic screaming kids who are too young to be playing the game. I wish parents would goddamn monitor what their kids are playing.
---
Fairly confident I could make atleast 80%+/- of the "low hanging fruit" changes in about a week, with Access to the Creation Engine (maybe CK) and XEdit.   
---
Countless hundreds represent the "Low hanging Fruit", broken links, missing keywords, broken COBJ's, broken leveled lists, etc..
---
I wasn't asking lol I was replying to that player.
---
Too late... Bethesda should have done this on day 1 but instead allowed players to use their characters and move them back and forth. 
---
If they said you had to start a new character, they could have avoided any chance of duped items being sent to survival servers and allowed for a fair playing surface for all starting out at lvl 1. 
---
Survival isn’t exactly survival if you can go back to a safe place and repair and farm material in adventure mode... that’s pretty weak...
---
Also makes no sense for anyone new or low level to go to survival server knowing full well that higher levels are just waiting for them to spawn in as we’ve literally have read here on Reddit only to lose caps and most their aid items... why bother?
---
Not sure elsewhere but here in the UK just got another 'alt' account for £9.99.
---
And they don't seem anywhere near sold out.
---
Honestly, unless you plan to stand in your camp all day to collect, seems hardly worth it. 
---
I have a resource collector at my camp producing 20 steel scrap, but i hardly even collect it, i just leave it for my visitors. 
---
I always have a surplus by just playing the game, exploring and collecting supplies in my travels.
---
Very nice
---
Or another game mode like survival and all other modes get snow or blizzard like storms and a backpack heater mod
---
170gb
---
Player Vending went live too, you can build vending machines at your camp and stock them with items for other players to buy. your machines need to be powered for your camp to be seen as a vendor camp on the map, you can also view other player's generic vendor camp lists marked in green on the map by mousing over them, you'll see what catagories a player has for sale. You can fast travel to a player camp and interact with their machines to browse the content.
---
Vending Machines are build from the Vending category in your camp menu. You don't need to buy anything from the Atomic Shop to unlock Vending but there are premium paint skins for the vendor machines there.
---
The Cap Limit is still 25,000 so if something you sell would make you exceed 25,000 caps, you will lose caps on a sale in this manner.
---
Lastly, you lose 10% of any sale you make to the radioactive nether, selling ammo is currently bugged somewhat as sellers are reporting not getting much when large sums of bulk ammo is bought by a another player.
---
Or if your camp is a Jumping Maze Puzzle like mine =P
---
I always swap to melee when I see one come at me with a board shouting 'GOOD FIGHT HUMAN'. They deserve honorable melee combat.
---
Yep. Well, depends on your build.  
---
Bloodied on low health is always better (+80% damage or more)  
---
Junkies with 5 addictions is always better (+50% damage)   
---
Berserkers with no armor is always better (I believe that's also +50%)  
---
But for a weapon with no "negative requirement", a potential +45% damage on "all" shots against big targets is pretty nice. In comparison, Anti Armor is ~28% and Two Shot slightly below 25% (since it apparently doesn't include reciever damage boosts). And Instigating/Stalker's don't really fit the situation.
---
No. You can only have one tech data on your character at one time HOWEVER if you have them in your stash prior to starting that quest I believe you can pull one out at a time (not sure). 
---
If you have a tech data and you find another, notice now you only have one? 
---
I’ve tried it picking up 2 more on top and unless RNG is a factor, it didn’t make a difference getting items completing it.
---
ooooh i might try that one to chAnge things up!!!! thank you!
---
I didn’t know it was like that in survival. That’s a pretty good idea tbh. And the fact that someone can avoid 115% (or something crazy like that) of damage 75% of the time is nuts!!! No wonder a single piece of assassins/sentinel sells for 20k!!
---
But you already paid the caps. Lol But that’s cool they did that.
---
Beware of the Legendary Scrapping machines I would hate for one of your Dragons to have an untimely death.
---
P.S Wavy Willards Water Park will not be bending the knee.
---
Yea think he could avoid 100 percent of your damage 75% of the time (in theory) as long as he is standing still. And jumping counts as standing still I guess.
---
What would cause your volume to stop working I've tried everything now playing with it and it sucks

The combat shotty is the most versatile, I think you can get the plans from Phoenix down in Watoga.

Workshops are slow at building resources, it is much faster to get them in the open world.  The only times that I use a workshop is for challenges. Then I claim them and allow it to fail the defence mission.   You can claim a Power plant hook up a generator to the fusion core extractor fail the defence mission and still collect cores. Steel, lead, acid are available in abundance outside of workshops and you do not need to refine them to make them usable. I am level 210.
---
i agree, its supposed to be a BETA but they haven't changed anything for a while now
---
Is White Spring where that golf course is?  If so, shouldn't that wait until you are a higher level?  Those ghouls kick my ass every time I go there. 
---
Also, where can I find a junk pile?
---
Combat shotgun, is the best non legendary shotgun, due to how many modding options it has.
---
Considering that you can get an extra 200 carry weight while wearing excavator, and extra 100 on all others (if you have calibrated shocks), this is not a good suggestion. Either get deep pocket armor and the high capacity backpack mod, or stop hoarding stuff
---
Did you check to see if you actually have the .exe and the archive files? If you do, maybe copy them to a temp folder on your desktop, and quit the Beth net launcher. Then place the files and launch from the .exe, see if you can sign in through the game instead of the launcher. Also, make sure you have the latest version of the launcher in case you missed an update.
---
I got one for answering the question lol idk man people being people.
---
i'm not blaming anyone, just advocating for server hopping over fast traveling
---
Prior to picking up the quest they are treated like normal items, so you can pick up as many as you like and they stack, until you get the quest for them then they change to quest items.
---
something needs to change because as it is, survival is not doing so great
---
im all for season resets and new characters needed, maybe they can make a 6th character slot just for survival
---
Four was my first foray into Fallout, and honestly RPGs in general. Looking back I definitely think it's one of the weakest stories in any of the games and highly flawed but it still has that special place in my heart. I have a lot more fun with the story in NV and what I've played of 3 was fun.
---
Thank you kind sir!
---
\+40% more power attack
---
 Mine has never failed to work. Its on Heavy Combat if that helps.
---
Yes correct from what I've seen on both of my characters.  Up to the point of getting the quest they stack and you can put them into your stash.  If you have 40 on you when you get the quest bang just 1 is in your inventory.  The ones in the stash are still there, take one out into your inventory and it may not start the quest but often you can put it in a world container and pick it back up and it will work.  My second character the quest marker and event never shows up but I can still go and turn them in.
---
Cool! Good to know!
---
Meat Hook
---
When your picture is ready to be taken, just take a screenshot on Xbox and save it that way too if you have run out of room
---
I literally never even noticed that about my left arm haha thank you for the info
---
I've thought the same thing too though, definitely wish it got more love.
---
 I just want serums. The rest is easy.
---
Bought the mod from Grafton Station 3 weeks ago
---
That is so evil. Much respect!!
---
(How do you spawn bloatflies like that??)
---
There are players out there that purposely jump to workshop "defence" just to kill the player owning it on the off chance they have junk on them. So be aware of people around you during your defenses. If you see a level 100+ jump to Billings Farm, per se, to "help" I'd jump away and let him defend for you if they are there to help (you'll get credit even if not present). Or wait for it to become a retake the workshop. This doesnt allow other players to directly jump to the location.
---
Best thing to do is if you do take a workshop, is don't spend much time there. Loot what you need dump the goods into a stash and jump away. I usually set up a stash box at the end of my loot route right next to the extractor.  
---
Also, if you see a defense pop-up make sure it says "prepare your defenses" because that means it's a regular defense. If it says "repel the invaders" or something like that (can't remember the verbiage) then thats a player trying to take it from you.
---
Yes i was
---
i recommend you see a doctor if your wood is floopy

Mr Herder + 3 named Brahmin, speaking to him spawned a level 80 legendary sheepsquatch
---
Thanks for the comments all! Helps me get good stuff on my vendors for you guys. Fair prices only.
---
Ok thank you
---
Maybe. Did you nuke the southern ash heap then Hemlock holes in the toxic valley then the area around top of the world?
---
I've experienced this damage boost transfer between targets when they bunch up (Semi-auto Handmade with FFR). For example, target 1 dies after 6 shots and my 7th shot hits target 2, taking out a large chunk of its health. Then the 8th shot takes out a noticeably smaller chunk.
---
I only glanced at the sender/receiver stuff when trying to figure out the limit for my damage calculator. I can't remember exactly, but maybe the hit event and resetting the stack can get interleaved with damage application in a way that enables this apparent damage boost. If the server is somehow involved, the latency may be of play here too.
---
 The storey is fascinating. Its not at all obvious and you will have to look around. The east side of the map has many bits of that storey scattered around the place.
---
I find alot of wierd stuff in the super mutant gore mounds (whatever they are called) 
---
there are alot in Huntersville
---
good luck!
---
isnt that the point of the possum challenge?
---
 Its BoS Heavy Combat.
---
New resource altogether would be super cool. And maybe a few more  sites 😉
---
lol one set of BlackBird PA paint is $18
---
so id say $7 for the whole game is not bad
---
Why diluted radaway?  Can you take those with mutations and not lose them?
---
Cuz if that’s the case I learned something today!
---
[My surprise ](http://imgur.com/gallery/F8xnv3d)
---
That just leaves the sh#ts.
---
It looks like it's not for you, fair enough no point buying something boring. Peace out.
---
I hear ya.. only reason I had it fast was I have it as a saved post!
---
I can get on today at 5:30pm ct
---
Ok, i can probably be on then too
---
Don't forget to check under the mods section...much cheaper than the plans and you don't need the materials to make them.
---
Yes if u use normal radaway u will loose mutations. Diluted radaways prevents that.
---
gotcha.   the rewards get less and less as well.
---
The point is selling rifles to vendors and junk to players :P I sell stuff like antiseptic and leather and rubber at 1c.
---
Doesn't matter if you have a disc or a digital version, they both contain the full version of the game regardless. As to DLC, Beth stated that you won't have to buy any DLC ever. This does not include The Atom Shop, which is Premium/Optional stuff.
---
They don’t drop from Deathclaws unfortunately.
---
I forgot all about Huntersville.  I'll check that out tonight!
---
So you’re the one meaning I can’t find the cheap serums I’m looking for?
---
Gauss is technically ballistic, even if the ammo is under energy
---
i giggled at this
---
I sometimes find them in boxes in Fort Defiance.  I wish I knew that I needed 5 since I have sold a few.
---
It's just a matter of button mismatching. The devs could easily remedy this by using another button for the &lt;filter&gt; option, why not move that to L3, and have R3 function as &lt;inspect&gt; as everywhere else?
---
Isn’t The Fixer a shotgun? Get someone to craft you a level 50 version of that.
---
pretty sure that line came from the Fallout 4 loading screens... they just borrowed it.
---
They made it a separate item. I think you just have to craft another if it’s missing. 
---
I think it looks better with the clean spacesuit helmet, anyway.
---
Oh yeah I forgot micro transaction was in the game, well maybe i will buy
---
Are you using VATS for the shots? Two shot has a tendency to miss with the second projectile and thus you don't get the full damage benefit.
---
i noticed that as well and upvoted it to counter act the shenanigans
---
Those are rather fair prices I think. I'm sure you'll have people jump on here and tell you that you could make more caps but you know what, if you're selling stuff at your prices then seems to me you've priced it right :)
---
I do the same thing.  But if you keep one, sell it!  You'd probably make a fortune from people looking to complete that badge.
---
Looks awesome! How much budget did you have left for decorations? I am thinking of doing a similar build after seeing this, can you recommend any quiet out of the way places you found to be useful?
---
build a workshop, build only the essentials(extractors)  and farm for as long as you can, store your junk.
---
if someone comes and takes it server hop,and if you need more resources, do it again. most of the resources you use on a workshop are from the workshop, even the caps you use to claim it you just got from eliminating all the enemies so i still think it's worth it.
---
Yeah I noticed and thank you :)
---
I bought mine and use them to in addition to selling junk to vendors if I run out of room, though currently I'm selling mine at 493 caps each if I remember right.
---
Hard Bargain, Grape Mentats, Beer.
---
I'm going to start using sweet rolls in this too.
---
This does not count Charisma from gear which I don't have at this point.
---
Damn it, I dont think it was us then.
---
Ooh, pictures?
---
I'll have to check that out tonight.
---
Oh, every season, tf is this? I can get it that they will restart survival and force people to play new characters, but if I got to grind the story, events, missions, dailies all the time nty.
---
That’s what I do. But it doesn’t complete picture taking quests
---
Glad to hear I'm not the only one.  My charisma is garbage, but I do have Hard Bargain maxed out.  I wonder how useful a 12 cap beer would be in all of this.
---
You on ps4? I sell most for 250 caps
---
10 to 1 the lever is armour piercing. the 44 does not have a mag so no peircing, unless legendary like somerset special. armour penetration goes a LONG way,but not listed under the damage stats.
---
Wow! These are awesome.
---
And here I struggle getting my tv settings right. This is some next level shit.
---
Good prices. Its all over the place. I paid over 800 caps for a serum after I got tired of looking. Found a 400 cap one a bit later, on another server. Hi ho. ;)
---
Damn your valid questions!
---
I'm sorry!  I keep telling myself I will stop, but I need those caps to feed my family of bush kitties back at my camp.  And my ever growing chem addiction.  I'll gladly sell ya some ^(at minimal markup.)
---
But, I haven't gotten an update on my ticket about it, so some of what yong said can be true.
---
My team mate and I will do chameleon checks as we approach targets. And I can see my teammate not chameleoned. And she can see me not chameleoned.
---
Then we cycle the armor piece on and off and we good.  To me I always look chameleoned. But to other players I don't.
---
sorry. life got in the way and I didn't make it on. maybe tonight... Though I should mow... :-/
---
I am, but my comment was mostly a joke. That said I may look you up.
---
1 charisma point.
---
I decided to brew a 12 pack for myself via the brewstation
---
No, Liberators are always high-level spawns for me (ok, lvl 42, so not max level, which is a shame), only eyebots spawn as lvl 1 legendaries. Good that the scrip machine doesn't care what level the loot is, and the better low level legendaries either go into the Overseer's Camp or can even be sold for a surprisingly lot of caps. You know, mules need protection, too! :-P
---
 The Lever has no AP mags, so no.
---
Haha thats cool just add me then when were on together we can sort it then
---
Didn't even realize this until he mentioned it. When I finally got my 2nd character working with your help, I noticed I was able to see my main crouched in the corner even though I have 5pc of chameleon on him. Switched back to my main and it was showing the chameleon effect still but to others and probably enemies, still visible. I thought that this was something to do with being on friends list. But then my main would be invisible at other times. Didn't put 2 and 2 together until now. So with my newb character being super low level right now, doesn't have anything to do with chems or weapon attachments.
---
So you have teammates who can confirm your hidden. That's what we do. And most times we think we are hidden but I'll look and tell them they aren't invisible.
---
Is an anti-rifle a pistol?
---
1 man! alone! betrayed by the friends he once loved! 😂 keep checking player vendors, or server hop until you find the mods you require to save caps.. that’s how I built up my X-01 before the plans were put into the vendor.. Tesla bracers came up quite often but naturally I wanted the stealth mod lol
---
What if it only showed the top 3 excluding you. So you never know your position on the list, but others do. Then you would never know when to be more on your guard.
---
It’s hit or miss really and to be honest,  I wish I had their sense of joy at what many of us take to be mundane aspects of our characters every day life.
---
Is my TSE powerful?  Yes.
---
Is it awe inspiring in its destructive capabilities? After 120+ hours of using it,  no,  it’s just efficient.
---
Hi . Those are the pieces I currently wear. I don't yet have any of the perks you mentioned but I have the mutations

---
Yeah I do miss the unofficial patches like they did for skyrim and fo4. All of this would be fixed super fast if there was one of those right now.
---
I know it's not a traditional mod, but it includes modifying the .ini file which a lot of people here have been referring to when talking about mods for this game
---
 The .44 is a pistol I take it? TS is crap as its so inaccurate. That said I have a TS Auto Grenade Launcher, the one weapon it does affect badly.
---
Lol of course. Grr
---
I'm pretty sure several vendor bots have the chance to spawn the plan, but it's one slot out of all the possible armor rolls or something because I hit lots of servers and vendor bots every day and still don't have the plan. I've gotten several box mods, but not since patch 9. I'm really looking for combat armor and raider armor dense now, it's about all I don't have. I also hate how every vendor has a dozen night vision scopes on hand. They're totally useless in the eternal 6pm. I swear Beth looked at some data set and was like "why aren't people using night vision scopes? They must be to hard to get! Let's put them everywhere!"
---
Thanks for your answer!

It's a rifle, Not a shotgun.

I was able to get an AA faster fire rate lmg and it chewed up a lvl 50 scorchbeast pretty fast while it was flying, only problem is I don't have mods for lmg so if I could add bigger drum mag and maybe stability mods, since hitting scorchbeast that spam yells is a pain.
---
Alright wastelanders. I made this post at 1 in the morning and my device auto corrected “so” to “to”, I’m not actually a dumbass. Peace!
---
Thanks for saying that, I really appreciate it. I had very little left for decorations, in fact what you see is a full budget. I used to have a Brahmin and a modest crop farm, but now the barn is simply a generator room and bed with personal computer so basically a bed and breakfast. I do have signs and posters up to give it *some* life but otherwise only a little decorative budget.
---
I definitely think you should attempt a build like this! I've only seen 4 "towns" including this one, so be sure to post it up. The other three were actually nearby mine, so it seems the Forest has the most flat land. I chose this spot because of Snaptail Reeds for brewing nuka dark along with a lot of other plant spawns with a critter group spawn right by and plenty of dead logs for wood.
---
You want a flat spot, there's a few vids on YouTube of people pointing out nice flat plots for people to throw down a camp. Mine is kinda built into the hill there. Depends on what you want your surroundings to look like. Are you gonna build it so large that you won't need resource extractors? New Gad is good for a Mad Max desert feel

Yeah I probably find one every 30 or so runs so don’t get your hopes up.  Check every container as there are a ton.
---
Where did people get that outfit from? Was it special edition game thing?
---
I forgot my "shopkeeper" statues! There's enough for some decorations, sure. More than I would think. Would have to take them all down to really show how big the chunk is. Maybe when I make a town crafting video!
---
Maybe next week then.  I'm off so I'll have time to be patient.

I took a photo of the 'Injured Super Mutant' and thought it was an interesting random encounter. I remember he something about a white fluffy thing attacking them.

It was a flagrant case of review bombing, started with an organized group in Metacritic, then followed for the flock of miserable youtubers who were not invited to the preview party (99%) and the toxic NV parasitarie circlenerd.

Good thing you're on PS4.  I'd be swinging by to buy you out.  Ya know, once I have caps again.

Thanks! I’m going by what I’ve seen them at other vendors for sale... some almost double for armor over mine.

Many I’ve seen aren’t upgraded or even repaired, more like garage sale “as-is”...

Thank you so much! That means a lot to me. I'd be ecstatic if Bethesda was able to see my photos.

I’ve been having the problem of when I move my camp, it’s breaks down the stored building into individual pieces based on everything that’s on one concrete foundation. It’s fucking maddening and it’s kept my camp in the same place for two weeks now, because none of the pieces that are stored fit together either, which forced me to store every single piece and build it from scratch. Not doing that again until it’s fixed.
---
We're you banned? They do not reply to people who were banned
---
Yeah, but why would you build something like this that looks nice when you can build a giant box in the sky supported by a single staircase?

Nah, they felt shoehorned  in,  and they are awful too fight, extremely tanky.

I was really thinking 300 and I though 350 was too high but you’re right, I’ve seen many for 800+ and way higher for them.

Other than the cost of the recipe, flux is about the hardest thing to come by and that’s not difficult at all.

That one points gotta be worth what, ten caps a serum?  I'll be experimenting with this tomorrow morning once the robots come back from the bank with more caps for me.
---
holy crap now I NEED to know what OP said originally as he has since deleted it
---
It's for PvP. Lone wanderer 10% is the best charisma option period. You should only have the necessary points for rank 1.
---
as I mentioned I had a hard time doing damage/surviving multiple enemies. Can you recommend where to level up around 23? Also, any recommendation on weapon/ammo/mods to use this low? I see everyone mentioning melee builds but I like sniping/using vats
---
this is actually an excellent way to not burn through stable flux. Just go around engaging in some good old arbitrage.
---
You think there's a bot?
---
Damn, you just made the best comment. I love going to shops and when I see someone with a metal skybox I die inside, and it's not from radiation. Like what're we doing out there y'all

Go over there personally with a pitchfork?

I can top that.  I have a 1* level 1 troubleshooter’s pool cue.  I’m asking 45000 caps or a TSE gatling plasma.  Don’t try to lowball me I know what I have.

I don't have a Twitter. I suppose I could make one and take Bethesda. Thank you for the tip!

White Spring is the golf course the enemies will spawn at a higher level if higher level players are in the area but that's the good thing get a fast firing weapon tag the enemies and run for your life it's the easiest xp you will get just make sure someone else is there to kill the ghouls.
---
Just Google Fo76 resource maps I had my camp on the river in the area of Sun Shine meadows workshop just follow the river upstream from there and look for a junk pile with barrels in it. This spot is a really good location for a camp.

yes.

A well known shit talker. Someone who has no skill but thinks very highly of themselves. Man sized child who looks like an oompa loompa. Also know as the cause of tsunamis when swimming. A person who is not so bright. A very semi kinda known player in fallout 76 know for having no skill, talks shit, and claims to be the best when he wont even fight anyone. For further definitions refer to the words douche, trash, master skinflute player, asshat, peterpuffer, oompa loompa, and quief.
---
You missed that question on the test. It was so easy you must be an apexihod to get that wrong.

You were suppossed to fight me yesterday and never showed your acting like an apexigod

Maximum damage output in boss fights, as well as against other players. Damage mitigation can make bloodied hp levels a non issue as well, I run bloodied full stop, and I die WAY less than when I ran full hp.
---
Pretty sure the oy mod for lmg is the prime reciever.
---
Pretty sure that's wrong. Diluted radaway can also remove mutations if you're not using Starched Genes.
---
For an even more split feeling, I would lose the foundations connecting the buildings. It would make them feel more separated.
---
How does that differ from player vending machines?
---
Good info, what armor pieces do you have&gt;?   
---
Some people have reported issues with marine armor
---
Limited time, not limited item....
---
Thanks for this info...  
---
What armor pieces do you have? (Types I mean)
---
Thanks! Was wondering if I could space it out even more. Appreciate the tip. Maybe I could fit another building or two then...
---
Except Bethesda hasn't merged up most of those fixes, even the easy ones.
---
yeah i 1000% have noticed sometimes im NOT getting what im supposed to be getting!
---
i sold a 3000 weapon
---
i should have gotten 2700 caps
---
I got 1400!
---
wth?!!?!?
---
I was of this assumption as well. I thought for a second a loophole was found and I could take back 2 points of luck and drop starched genes.
---
That's true but... hate to say it but a certain move in the past makes me skeptical about the word *ever*.
---
Not that i wish for but also you'll never know.
---
My party members have always been able to see me but I still appear invisible to non-party members.  Perhaps it is not a bug so your party can see you easily?
---
They seem to fly at 50, but maybe cause you can take them to a vendor for 100...
---
I don't use em, so I'll take em to NPC unless I've hit my caps limit for the day then right into the vendor.
---
Heavy Combat Armor
---
The 2 of you are so full of shit. Spewing your own opinion like they are facts. The real fact is thousands of players played the game for themselves and stopped playing because of the terrible state of the game at launch. Todd Howard just admitted that the game had many problems. I've played on and off since mid December and anyone that says this game didn't have serious issues is lying their ass off
---
I repeatedly stabbed myself a bunch with spare radaways, those burn through your food/water pretty quickly.
---
I went to Big Fred's BBQ Shack then hopped over to survival.  The foxes outside count as critters, and there's a cooking station inside.  I got 3 of the 5 challenges done in less than 5 minutes.
---
It’s a rare drop from forest events not a world spawn afaik
---
It would be god tier if it had swing speed and +strength, its a damn good weapon, but not a god tier.
---
*shrug*
---
Um ok.
---
That's awesome
---
Diluted is good cause you don't want to strip away a ton of rads if your a low HP/high rad build
---
Both Game Stop and ebay have second hand copies for sale
---
Same,  an entire floor of my six story spectacle island building was my “hall of armor”.
---
Well to be honest, if I saw someone using a "no PvP" emote on survival, I would be inclined to kill them all the more so.
---
Doesnt spawn
---
No it was an atom shop item that’s been retired for now- they will most likely bring it back later
---
Yea I dont see the diff lmao
---
We love it when people like you get on the server. It's fun killing people who try to avoid PvP in a PvP mode. Lol
---
Is it possible furious explosive would reset stacks if the splody bits hit another mob?
---
you sure showed it
---
Wow. This one comment is super informative. Thank you! Can you elaborate on 80% damage increase for bloodied? It seems like bloodied typically leads to much higher damage increases than 80%.
---
Its kind of disappointing to say the least. If one or two guys can run through code and fix the stuff, what in the hell are they doing at bethesda? I hope there will be one of those patches for fo76, but with how often bethesda is putting out patches, itd probably be like chasing a kid whos lighting matches and throwing them on the ground and its your job to put out the fires.
---
The community manager also cleared once that they aren’t banning any mod users.
---
That's my thought process.  Its like buying a sure fire stock.  It will just take a little bit of time to get my returns.  Some times I almost feel bad, like I'm robbing non-mutated people from getting the chance to buy some cheap ass serums, but I'm sure once I have my swimming pool full of caps, I'll sleep better at night.
---
 Acknowledgement Is First Step Towards Recovery!
---
I actually hit up vendors and offer to buy 30+ for 125-15 0 to do the same
---
Some weird stuff spawns there.....
---
Lots of robots.
---
That makes more sense. Thanks
---
Well done Floopian.
---
This information is extraordinarily helpful.  Thank you.  The lack of mechanics info I can find in this game on the wikis and other sites is frustrating.
---
Thanks for finding info on this.
---
So you can use the ingredient containersssssspread around the factory
---
I think there's either a bot or a user that goes around downvoting everything Fallout 76 related, yes. May have been people downvoting the comment, too, who knows. Just saying one possible cause of downvotes.

There is no mods unfortunately, i use mine alot and its always a tad gutting.
---
Instead of traveling all across the map to different vendors you would a one stop shop for all your needs. It would allow players to put their own swagg in their space they decide to open the shop. And it gives fallout a even more social aspect picture players joining up making their "insert favorite faction" Marketplace. I do enjoy traveling to other vendors and i hope that doesn't change but it would also be great if i could step in "Morgan Airport" and seeing it populated by follow players and the creative shops or buildings they come up with
---
I'd say NV has way more in terms of fleshed out environment and choices than 3 but 3 will always be my favorite. I actually have difficulty with some choices in NV unlike I did in 3
---
I’d pay $20
---
I only want it if I can hit a switch and have it come out of the floor like the bat cave!
---
Where does the 28% extra damage for AA comes from?
---
Solid advice.
---
Funny. A friend and I did the exact same thing about a week ago. We rewarded the players with the GAZ certificates (now meaning: Great Awesome Zettlements) you're free to use the idea ;)
---
Great Roleplaying and good initiative!
---
Hey would you mind linking your build and discuses your armor, mutations and any other recommendations i was thinking of making a combat rifle build
---
I almost exclusively get hunters and chameleon armor. Weapons are different on every server. Yesterday at a nuke free whitesprings I had about 8 legendary weapons in a row. All bloody or antiarmor. They’re 1 stars but still it was like clock work for a while. Just my two caps.
---
I’d love to have some robots tailing me around
---
No green stuff there.
---
I don't believe swing speed would be much benefit on the drill. I'm pretty sure it would only affect the initial punch motion of putting the drill into the enemy, not the spin rate of the drill itself. That's how swing speed works on Buzz Blades and Rippers, anyway.
---
OMG I LOVE THIS IDEA, I love the camp system but most spots have enemies that smash up my Camp so I end up putting it somewhere where spawns don't exist. Heck if they made Camps better I might come back to the game.
---
Ah, I got ya. But can I not give them a fixed camera to use?
---
Instead of only having them at your camp, have them in other places. Not everyone ventures into the mire where I camp, for instance
---
They can also be found in junk piles.
---
We should be able to hire super mutants to do our bidding. Seeing as how they are always carrying Caps it wouldn’t be much of a stretch to have a Super Mutant Bounty Hunter club in the wasteland. 
---
Dog the super mutant bounty hunter
---
I did the same thing, with the perk that boosts food by 25%.
---
Took like 20 Rad-Away before I was even close to starving again.
---
Whitesprings has been kind of nuts the past few days for me as well. Seems like damned near every other enemy was dropping a 1* to fuel the scrip machine.
---
You literally are spewing your own facts with thousands of players. Where is this player count? SteamChartz doesn't have Fallout 76 listed, yet.
---
Most complaints were about design decisions. Like being online or no NPCs. These are artistic choices made by the dev team.
---
can you expand on the regret of maxing out your cards?
---
i'm having trouble understanding special and perk cards completely as it is TBH.. like i want a bit higher 'A', yet most the cards aren't appealing. so my 'S' is at 6, while others are at like 2 (some 1)
---
I got 7 legendary left arms in a row. Maybe it’s trying to tell me I need a new right leg.
---
One of these days, I'll be free and clear and no longer feeling the need to buy ten egghead serums at a time.
---
I know it costs caps to claim a workshop. Didn't know there was a death tax too.
---
My mouth salivated at the idea of buying them for 125 caps each...
---
I agree, with the notion of separate survival and adventure characters... keeps things nice and even, no using mules from adventure, no having a warehouse full of ammo and chems and crap in adventure that  you can dig into whenever you wish...
---
But a new one every season? Can you provide the source of this info? I'd like to read it firsthand.
---
Using adventure to farm everything then hopping into survival is cheese.
---
We need this
---
Fireproof will make that missile worthless. Adamantium Skeleton so you can't cripple. I'd guess:
---
Fireproof, Dodgy, Serendipity, + PvP armor set (including dense chest mod) +Cola. I've also seen some interesting things with BioCommesh and chems.
---
SB(Q) is an animal, the prefix for that is *Hunter’s* not Zeolot’s!
---
You may be moving faster than the game on your rig can load load and render the environment around you.
---
What?! You mean it wouldn't be a god-tier drop from the SBQ?? lol
---
Use semi auto with faster fire rate. It’s the best of both worlds and no dmg drop off with the right mod
---
You shall rule from the "Junk Pile Throne"
---
I'm on an Xbox one s
---
But 7 players firing all at once with decent weapons? The queen can't even tank that much damage
---
Such a bummer there has been no word on this issue.
---
I really wish these would get fixed to be usable.
---
I’ve had all level 1 Insult Bots.  I’m seeing a therapist now.
---
Yeah speed demon makes you so fast the game rendering can't keep up sometimes lol
---
Sometimes you can run into locked buildings before the the doors load. It's best to use in short sprints to prevent this. You can't just run from one town to another.
---
I like the idea of being able to build your own robots by becoming a robco engineer, but there are two things: first the reliance on daily quests to get these tokens might become infuriating as I have to wait to obtain more of these tokens, so if there were some other radiant quests that reward these tokens with no cool down on them, that would be more intuitive. Also, making these robots similar to what they are in automation (starting with a frame, then attaching modifications and what not) would be cooler than just having preset robots.
---
Damn, I've been kicking myself! I've already found/scrapped 2. Then I found a vendor selling 3 for 1k each. I thought that was way overpriced. But in retrospect, it was totally worth it. Damn.
---
I too lived through it and cannot believe how many people were on that bandwagon
---
one thing I like about having a flea market type spot for vendors to gather would be the ease for checking prices against other vendors..as a buyer, you could see who had the best prices on a certain something, instead of having to do all the travel.
---
..and as a seller, you might get a better idea of what the market is asking..
---
I have a bloodied explosive mini gun and I play on PS4 it was working for me yesterday. Could it be your tri barrel?
---
I wish the game supported the export/import of a camp blueprint from one player to another or selling the blueprint in a player vending machine.
---
Maybe even with a browse feature to look at interesting camps and such.
---
Some players, like me, are not strong builders and get tired of living in a square wood shack.
---
I've heard reports about this, but haven't found one for testing yet (or found the time, but that shouldn't be too difficult). Definitely sounds plausible, though.
---
When you said Top of the World I immediately started thinking that we're parked in the same spot and yeah, we are. Sounds like you made a really nice build there. I just plonked down a little two story house at the top of the cliff and called it a day.
---
Literally broke down like over a hundred combat chest pieces at the most inexpensive cost possible and broke em all down. Ended up learning every possible mod with dense (arguably the best mod for chest) being the last one. I almost thought it didn’t exist
---
oh you know I didn't even know that
---
yeah I hopped over on my camp and a squirrel spawned right outside it, bob's your uncle
---
100% with him. I've gotten to elder and I always turned one in at a time. The desk at the enclave and the colored cabinets at sugar grove are the best farming places. Contrary to popular belief once you take anything including tech data out of the container, it will go on a 24 hour cool down before it can be relootable. So dont take anything out of a container unless it has tec data in it. On average, it took me about 15 tec datas to rank up on the paints.
---
You're forgetting the most important thing, you must chant the hymn of the heavies whilst thou powders thy ball sack. Only then are you ready for the wastelands many perils.
---
I just really like this hat and 15c is a steal compared to the 3k-5kc I see it going for now. It's the only reward I was missing from fasnacht (besides the ultra rare masks). This little yellow hat has brought me much happiness in this trying wasteland.
---
I seriously didn't care about the bag at all, I only submitted a ticket for the canvas one because I figured I might as well
---
I've seen this too; looks like sometimes the first hit on a 2nd target gets the damage bonus, then the reset happens. Seems a little glitchy ... but either way it doesn't change things much. It's only really useful for a single hit on one target, after getting to stack to full on another.
---
Also why the "no build" zones exist.
---
now if only there weren't a 1400/day cap screwing all this up the game could have a real market based economy
---
I got super frustrated too and figured I'd burn a little time trying to do something about it. There's just too many things to test, and honestly I tend to get sidetracked by the actual game... :P
---
You and me both. Even broken and busted it is fun as hell.
---
I keep reading about the 28% DMG from AA and I dont understand it. If I remove 50% of the targets armor, I cant say in percent how much I gain from AA as long as I dont know the opponents armor class in natural numbers.
---
If a opponent has 600 armor, then I remove the 50% AA, then I have 300 Armor. So AA should be very hard hitting.
---
If a opponent has 60 armor and I remove half of it, it has 30 armor, so the AA effect dindt increase my damage at all (well a tiny little bit).
---
Or do I completely misunderstand the Anti Armor effect?
---
Syringer. Most under-appreciated weapon in the game.
---
Turrets definitely need an aggro change. They need to react, for starters, to any damage to any part of the camp. And for sure if a mob can hit the camp from extreme range, the turrets should have the range to hit back.
---
Not gonna lie, I’ve gone to take people’s workshops just for the sake of doing it. Or if I have a friend in queue to join I’ll go take one hoping the guy might hop lol
---
Ok Gotcha.
---
You want to just place a generator and vending machine around the map. That sounds fine. Would definitely save players money on fast travelling.
---
Anthem is coming on the heels of Andromeda and a lot of people were skeptical of 76. Both had a lot to prove so that's why people were focused on it. And also why people freaked out waaaaay more about them
---
When we meet I'll kill you a blow up your base!
---
Lol...everytime i have to scroll through the 900 plans i know, and of the ones left theres always a few night vision scope plans
---
Dies to my 3 star knife........
---
That's the best effect there lol.
---
People are still able to browse and buy from your machnes without power. It just prevents your camp from showing up as a vendor location.
---
Why should there be a keyboard input?  Most of the playerbase is on consoles.
---
I posted something similar a few months back. While I totally understand wild animals attacking resources as a food item. Why the hell is a random mongrel dog so aggro against fences and walls. Animals and enemies don't attack generators that are static in the game.
---
Yes that would be amazing. Im hoping somthing new like that will apear in the new game mode.
---
Personally I would prefer non lit low budget cost signs that don't strain the system.
---
We do absolutely need some way to mark vending machines. I feel like the sale sign was a missed opportunity to provide the type of machine on the thing itself.
---
Even when just farming Whiteapring the game just feels super choppy. Is there a way to remove just one mutation at a time?
---
I found him in the summerville lake bed, just northeast of New Gad.
---
You know game companies have multiple teams working on multiple teams? Games were being worked on while they released Skyrim, 76 and ES6 as well as Starfield for example
---
Ok, i was also wondering this. It IS possible to get through scrapping??? Cause i also have every perk imaginable at max level and know the combat armor plans. Did you make them all low level? And were they just regular chest pieces or heavy?
---
so what you're saying is my 1\* furious plasma gatling is pretty ok?
---
Wish the stack count went a bit higher. Good job on the testing, nice to see exactly where this weapon stands.
---
Tell them you have some compromising pics of Todd with an Assaultron ( The FO4 dominatrix ones)
---
They are talking about gunsmith, makeshift warrior and licensed plumber all of which contribute to weapon durability.
---
5% build budget is kind of.. harsh.  :P
---
Absolutely not. There have been hundreds and hundreds of posts in this sub about the many problems and issues 76 had. 
---
There used to be between 20-30 thousand people using this sub. Now the number of people active rarely goes above 4k.
---
I believe there are only two mods for the LMG. Only one can be learned through scrapping. 
---
Don't recall the original author of the research but saved a link for additional information.

---
It's mostly the material gathering that's the hassle for me. I'm thinking of making a town building video of the steps to take. What kind of content would you consider helpful? We gotta get out there and rebuild America!
---
brb.. going poop surfing
---
I wish you the best of luck.  If you have extras they sold fairly well for me at 2000 caps.
---
I need three more as well. 
---
I found one randomly in the burrows, in a an underwater container accessible after turning a valve. (If you know the Burrows well enough, you should know what I am talking about. Let me know if you find one too). I keep checking that same location and have not found any more since.
---
Thanks for the info. Just curious but what kind of things will the robot due at my camp once I’ve completed the the mission??x
---
Oh. Well, bugger. If I'm lucky, they'll release before the holidays then. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Yes, I have Tricentennial paint on it. I will try take off the paint later and try scrapping again. Thanks!
---
Psn or xbox
---
Come across a lot of kids lately. I think they are carrying the game. imho. Main impact on me is I've had to watch my cursing
---
Psn
---
The red band gives us away
---
Well thank God. I don't want to be swarmed by 100+ Arachnids.
---
It'll kill my framerate.
---
Somebody get Todd Howard on the phone
---
Here's something what I went on my second playthrough; with a point to spare however you like.
---
- Heavy Gunner, Bear Arms, Stabilized, One Gun Army are pretty.
---
- Because you'll be in power armor, Power User will count down on fusion core weight. Bandolier means your 5mm for Mini/Gatling is weightless. 
---
- Fireproof, Lifegiver, and bonuses from Rejuvenated will complement tankiness in PA.
---
Mothman omelettes give cha as well
---
There's always a way into locked houses. 😜
---
I had an experience where a buddy of mine and myself were doing our thing questing and looting and whatnot and we ran into another higher level player. 
---
The guy was pretty cool at first sharing glowing ones and we were all having a jolly good time. Well then my camp got targeted by someone's nuke, I'm talking dead ass in the center. I figured it was someone who was a tad salty that I hit their camp with my whitespring nuke. No big deal, we'll server hop and find another world to nuke. 
---
We get into the next world and this guy goes crazy taking all the workshops, killing lower level players for the fun of it. Let me tell you, the messages I got from this guy makes me think he might've had a few screws loose. 
---
We promptly quit the world and blocked the guy but man oh man you never know who you're going to run into out there.
---
Was going to say, I'd like something less obtrusive. Like the veil, except actually making sense that it works. Or hell, that plauge doctor mask would work for me.
---
Not sure, that gun with that barrel has been working fine for weeks and weeks, but I'll try swapping it.
---
You need 5 for the leather working possum badge. If you have extras I sold mine (before I knew I needed 5) for 2000 caps each on ps4.  They sold fairly well.
---
Thanks for the details!
---
She has it elevated so glitching into a workshop was  no go.
---
Just had to sneak behind her when she went inside hahaha
---
I don't know if it's been fixed but can you power armor glitch into the house?
---
yep I think it's +2 vs +3 for sweetroll
---
Some jerk is downvoting all the posts here. Im not sure why.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong. But I'd say a lot of the times things were once very rare and demanded high prices, or like in this case they hope someone will see it in their Vendor and think oh my that looks rare and has tons of caps to blow. Some people think it's a numbers game with a lot of their items. Someone has to eventually come around that's willing to pay my absurd price is their mentality. I know this because I've talked to several people and that's their explanation. In reality the Fedora is a slightly rare thing to pile on my collection, memorabilia for a certain time in FO76 like the Faschnat (However it's spelled) masks now and my extras will be sold for not more than 250 caps.
---
if you are on PS4 id love to know who is selling them for so cheap, ive been wanting to try some mutations
---
I’m using a suppressed armor piercing non legendary combat rifle. I find it as good as the handmade because the ammo is much more available.
---
You're just cutting your daily income in half. What you should do is sell the serums on to other players for 300-400, and dump your worthless trash on the robots.
---
I was thinking about rewarding people with something but I dunno....this entire concept is still in its infancy so it defo going to change and that change will be influenced by the people who watch the videos.
---
very fair id say!
---
The lower the level the lower your chance at learning the mods are but sometimes quantity beats quality. I made most of them low level in the LIGHT category. Don’t do heavy cuz you’ll waste a lot more resources. The mods are the same across the weight levels or whatever. Every so often I’d say make a higher level one for increase chance but bulk the hell out of the cheapest ones. And yeah I almost gave up because of how long it took to learn but it is possible.
---
Bring back the Bozar! My life is not complete without a 10 round burst sniper rifle.
---
Yup. Level 3 sneak with covert operative and commando perks.

remember you can sell the serums to actual robot vendors for more than that!

* Missing a shot does not make you lose stacks.

THIS is what i was wondering! thank you!
---
I will give you one, but I am in France on business trip.  Be back on 14th.  GT Old Ranger 275
---
This is ridiculous. I cannot believe people are still complaining about this type of thing. Its a fucking wasteland people. NOT the sims. Why dont we all just play house, and remove all weapons and armor from the game too?
---
Yeah, just apparel, and hairstyles, so we can all go butt fuck in our camps and ignore any real threat. You know what? I'm tired of getting shot at when I collect supplies, and wearing armour really detracts from my character and his fashion sense. We should remove enemies from the game too, wouldn't it be so much better if players could focus on looking good, instead of functioning? Ffs. Gtfo of here with this shit. We need real fixes.
---
Like CAMPs being destructible on survival
---
Like the issue with legendary affixes being removed
---
Like literally anything else other than making it easier to play house in your little camp.
---
Thanks man! I'll keep you posted! If I can come across one before then I'll let you know!
---
The cushion mod helps with fall dmg but not by a lot
---
I'm not sure how you'd do it, but they should be more intimidating than they are somehow. 
---
Just saw the Red Star thing on YouTube and they really captured it.
---
I've done some basic tests regarding this. And the small metal letters cost basically the same budget  as neon and any other wall mounted item. That's why I suggest the whole words. That way something in neon like "Ammo" which takes 4 neon letters as is, and therefore takes up 4 wall items worth of budget will only take up 1.
---
Its an effective increase of 28.9% due to the way the calculation of damage dealt vs damage resistance works. There’s other posts that get into the math but that’s the gist of it.
---
In short you end up dealing **effectively** 28.9% more damage due to the enemy’s reduced damage resistance. It doesn’t show on the stat screen but you do more damage in real time than if you didn’t have Anti Armor
---
That’s a simple explanation at least
---
I'd prefer selling it for an overpriced amount
---
Where are you finding this active number?
---
Red star?
---
Off topic but related, killed the queen last night and noticed a combat armor chest on the ground. Hovered over it and it had a star before the name and said take under it and the A button so I tried but I never could pick it up. First time seeing something like that.
---
No plans but if i still have the gun in my vendor you can have it, wont be for a few hours though
---
That's what I wanted to do =/
---
Wait... What?
---
Assaultron Dominatrices?  Where is this? Are there pictures?  Is this a mod or dlc?
---
I need to know for, uh, for, uh, um, asthetic reasons?
---
Honestly the fact that Todd didn’t address the canvas bag or the nuka dark rum is what pissed me off the most. It was full on false advertising to make more money on cheap shit products. Game launch bs aside. I lost a lot of faith in Bethesda that day
---
Lol. So you’re chasing the name you see as number 1. 
---
He’s chasing another name that he sees as number 1. Maybe your name. 
---
Everyone running in a circle. Chasing a different “number 1”
---
__YOU'VE YEE'D YOUR LAST HAW__
---
ohhhhh is that no one was buying my armor with the reduced weight perks
---
That's ... actually maybe a bit misleading, let's see.  
---
The armor reduction formula is supposedly unchanged from FO4:  
---
DamageReduction = 1-0.5*(AttackDamage / DamageResist)^0.3653  
---
So the amount of damage reduction a target has due to armor, is not a fixed percentage based on armor. Rather, it's a sliding scale where the damage of the incoming shot also has an effect.  
---
**Table 1**  
---
Weapon with 200 damage per hit, vs various armor values (showing 2 decimals):  
---
Damage | Armor | Armor% | Damage to hp
---
----------|----------|----------|------------
---
200 | 100 | 0,36 | 128,81
---
200 | 200 | 0,5 | 100
---
200 | 300 | 0,57 | 86,23
---
200 | 400 | 0,611 | 77,63  
---
**Table 2**  
---
Now, if the weapon has Anti armor (50% armor pen), it looks like this. 5th column is % damage increase vs no armor pen (the table above):  
---
Damage | Armor | Armor% | Damage to hp | %dmg increase
---
----------|----------|----------|------------|-------------
---
200 | 50 | 0,17 | 165,93 | 28,81%
---
200 | 100 | 0,36 | 128,8149 | 28,81%
---
200 | 150 | 0,44 | 111,08 | 28,81
---
200 | 200 | 0,5 | 100  | 28,81%
---
So funky as it sounds - nomatter the damage of your weapon or the armor of your target, 50% armor pen will always lead to a ~28,8% increase in actual damage to health.  
---
But this also means that the % modifiers on the other damage boosts can't really be compared, since higher damage values also "pierce" armor. So let's repeat for 5-stack Junkies (because 50% is an easy value for calculations):  
---
**Table 3**  
---
----------|----------|----------|------------|---------------
---
200 | 100 | 0,25 | 224,07 | 73,95
---
200 | 200 | 0,42 | 173,95 | 73,95
---
200 | 300 | 0,5 | 150 | 73,95
---
200 | 400 | 0,55 | 135  | 73,95  
---
And having just done that ... I knew that a 50% increase in outgoing damage was doing to lead to more than a 50% increase in damage to hp, but damn. Now swap 50% Junkies to &gt;80% Bloodied and things really kick off.
---
It can vary based on their starting DR value, like if it’s lower than the damage stat on your gun. But in essence that’s what happens. Anti armor is best on targets with higher DR. When they have really low DR it doesn’t do as much because your damage punches through regardless.
---
Unfortunately I had a similar night to yours last night. Could not get into a silo or arktos at all. I'm talking after a full restart of my router, and hard resetting my system, clearing my cache and all that. 
---
It just kept force closing the game back to my home screen. I had to have tried a dozen different worlds and every silo. This was the case not only for me but one of my friends as well.  I'm hoping for better luck tonight.
---
I try price items I make slightly higher than what I can sell them to a NPC bot to discourage arbitrage by other players. Otherwise your suggestions for legendary items seems reasonable and similar to mine. I'm not trying to make caps really, if I have excess I sell it to others as service rather then profit. In the bad old days I used to unload these items for others to take in containers near the NPC vendor bots.
---
I personally think of 4 as the best one, but I'll gladly admit the main story was weak as shit. I enjoy 4 because I think it was a huge improvement in gameplay and world design, but the main story was just such garbage. I run D&amp;D games, and the story makes a classic mistake: it gives you a vital, immediate mission and then punishes the player for forcibly pursuing that mission like they should rather then checking out all the actual, fun things to do on the side. Whole thing could have been fixed if the PC &gt;!was aware of how much time might had passed, and focused on what \*happened\* to Shaun with the expectation he's long gone instead of actually trying to find him.!&lt;
---
But that golden helmet doe
---
Yep! I’ve got a Furious prime LMG I use in queen fights myself. It ain’t bad
---
Had someone buy 26 serums from my machine the other day then proceeded to buy 19 bulk lead and also what's up with the violet flux I have been selling out at 250 caps a piece.
---
For free?
---
It seems like some jerk is downvoting everything.
---
When this problem was previously occurring it was not limited to one weapon type, and the only fix was to swap weapons, I carried 2 Identical TSE Handmade Rifles and would just swap them each time it happened.
---
It may have been a server specific issue, I was encountering several Glitches last night on a Server that had several nuke Drops, then this morning while doing a quick WS run, many of the Ghouls were using StealthBoys or something cause they were invisible until I killed them.
---
Amazing work. Thanks for doing this. This is the type of stuff we need more of
---
Dirty tan suit and patched suit dont count?
---
Do new versions of the PA edition include canvas bags? I'm thinking of upgrading just for the bag.
---
bah ha ha ha. Well, it's better than any of my attempts, and I'd be glad to see it out in the wild, so good job!
---
Does that make you the King in the North? Or is the Toxic Valley north of the Wall making Morgantown Winterfell?
---
Morgantown does not deserve such honor, couch burning college destroying bastards.
---
Per shot. If there was a mirelurk king on my ass, I'd need the extra half-second to proc Escape Artist and regain my sneak bonus anyway. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Save word "appalachia"
---
Yeah it was new to me. Some Indie Company or something made a Fallout New Vegas themed Short Film like 20-30 minutes. I stumbled upon it last night. It brought me back to Fallout New Vegas and I almost broke it out and started playing it. Fallout 3 had its theme and so did 4. Fallout 76 has it's thing too. But New Vegas man, that's the best Fallout Environment for me to date. But anyways, please go watch it if you haven't seen it. I'm actually going to go watch it again.
---
Its called Fallout Red Star, just YouTube search it.

No mods the Assaultrons in Fo4 at least to me looked like Dominatrix.
---
I find hitting the asylum great for caps, find loads of Chems, straight jackets that clear out vendors in no time, and if you’re lucky you can find an asylum worker uniform that people will pay a lot of caps for
---
You could try selling your body to lonely vault dwellers.
---
So, I started letting my 6 year old son play Fallout 76, and I'll team up with him to help him out.  Let's just say it's frustrating.  I can't imagine having to deal with someone else's kids.
---
Oh that! I loved that
---
I fixed this by wiping out the save files. Next time I logged in everything magically worked.
---
Yup. As long as you're not swapping to hit different targets with it, you're good. Oh, I forgot to include: swapping to a different weapon, shooting a different target and swapping back IS allowed - as long as you can get it done within the 10 second timer.
---
What you said makes sense and I can understand it. I feel your price would not be unreasonable, I'm just swimming in them XD. That being said, I have started seeing Faschnact masks being listed for 500+ and the plans at 1000+ and I am still shocked about that.
---
Not sure if I can put links here. Here is a vid of 50 cap stashes :)

---
High levels would still be waiting even if everyone started fresh, and theres been new dupes since survival dropped, so anything gotten there would have been spread just as bad.
---
Marine tactical helmets still sell for a ton and are really easy to make. Other than that, just do a run of west tek or harper's ferry or something and sell the assault rifles from super mutants. Or if you can make mutation serums, 3-4 will clear out a vendor for the day
---
If you have the perks that let you search containers that is some easy caps. You can get 1,400 caps a day from vendors  and selling chems / food items is an easy way to do that. Also farming Westtek since usually it spawns super mutants, and htey drop caps when they die.
---
It's complete RNG, before the Purveyor existed, I have farmed legendaries for Months and placed everything worth selling on Vendor Characters.
---
Over time with a large mass of Weapons &amp; Armor, you begin to see just how even (and Random) the distribution really is.
---
my main problem is at no point in his video does he say he made any attempt to even find out if anyone at all has gotten an update. instead of asking bethesda for any update, or even searching to see if anyone has he just says, "well I haven't gotten an update so no one has" attitude.
---
tfw you have plans for jack bc you’ve never killed sbq :(
---
For free, im not a million percent sure wether its been sold or not yet, but if not you can take it
---
It's not Radaway, it's Rad-X. If you take Rad-X, you don't "lose" the mutation(s), you lose their affect for a little while (\~1 hour?). For example, you take a Rad-X (full strength) and you have the marsupial mutation, you lose the abilty  to jump high for a limited time. Taking diluted Rad-X doesn't affect the mutations.
---
Way better than I could do.
---
I'll play with ya. Add me: ImperatorVox
---
Oh damn that is so good!
---
I have the Scarlet Sniper outfit, and while it counts as formal wear for the level up daily, it does not count for the weekly with legendary kills.
---
Thanks a lot for the explanation. I need to dip further into the formulas but yeah that sounds correct. You convinced me to stop buying AA weapons haha :D At the same time my damage is usually low so it does not "pierce" much by itself.
---
TSE - two shot explosive
---
RNG - random number generator
---
AA - Anti armor
---
Most abbreviations are referring to legendary effects on weapons.
---
In general, the damage formula rewards higher damage values. For example, a 100-damage weapon will do 2.57x more damage than a 50-damage weapon, not 2x. This is important if TSEs are evaluated as multiple sources of damage, and they probably are.
---
No-one's properly tested TSEs, as far as I know. It's not clear whether they count as two, three or four separate sources of damage, and all of those are possible. TS has two projectiles but counts as a single source if you hit with both. If you could estimate roughly how much more damage the lever rifle is dealing in practice then I may be able to figure out how it works. The ShowHealth Redux mod would be ideal, but it's not an option unless you're on PC.
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
The West-Tek unique voice lines are ^(amazing)
---
But, I swear I seen someone with double mag.
---
If it's still the same as for the camera dailys then both should count.
---
Pond with a boat at the bottom of the cliff? It was a pain in the ass to line everything up to fit just right so I could have a deck off the bedroom overlooking the pond plus a deck of the bottom level that is situated right on top of part of the pond with stairs to wade into it. If I feel like a radioactive swim.
---
Right and I do! I do a a lot of flux farming but you can only sell 2-3 serums to vendors depending on what cards you play. If you have 3* hard bargain on I can only sell 2
---
I suppose the OP might have forgotten Tank Killer.
---
I refuse to shop somewhere if it's a low-effort sky/floating build.
---
Plus they're super tasty!
---
Until one shot accidentally hits a scorched that ran into melee range of one of the people and crossed in front of you. Then stack resets. But it's great while she's flapping about.
---
Ah, thanks, I thought I saw someone with double mag on their gun since mine only has a single on the left side. I wish Bethesda would add more mods to weapons would make using different guns feel fun to customize.
---
What were you selling the serums for?  I can't get anyone to buy them from my camp, and I think I have them priced at 400 caps.
---
The % outgoing damage increase obviously depends how low you go (as you know) - around 80% is probably where most people don't like going lower. But that's for pre-armor damage. For actual damage to health, it's even better due to how armor works in this game.  
---
Damage | Mob armor | Armor % | Damage to hp
---
-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------
---
100 | 100 | 50 | 50
---
180 | 100 | 0,38 | 111,56  
---
So ... damage on your ends goes up from 100 to 180%, which is an 80% increase. But since higher damage values pierce armor better, you end up doing 111,56 points of damage vs 50 - that's a ~123% increase.  
---
There's a reason why damage boosts in this game often feel stronger than the numbers suggest; because higher damage not only means higher damage, but also weaker mob armor.
---
I have had serums in my camp (and still do), but I don't get to play at popular times so I seldom have visitors.  I think I've sold one serum, and I have them all for sale at I think 400 caps.  It could be lower just to try to move them.
---
That is true, funny thing is he got free power armor edition and idk why they would give him one if they didn't bother flying him to the whitesprings event in WV.
---
Hi, I've checked and must have sold it, sorry.
---
No. The game isn't ALL about ratios and mechanics. It's also about shit that's just... "cool", shit that isn't always about max this or min that...
---
If that's the way you wanna play, then you have your answer... it's the powerfist. If you want the cool factor of the gauntlet... then figure out how to drop weight somewhere else.
---
No worries thanks anyway
---
I noticed cores burning faster. Period. Just more noticible using the JP. That's the reason I sold mine and switched to Emergency Protocols. But, ah, that eats em too! Just not as fast. It's a government conspiracy, I tell you!
---
This. Building around a meathook is both building around a bug, AND dumping a LOT of perks into 1h to get a small benefit over just using a DCG/PF. Not worth it IMO.
---
Right next to the subscribed number? 
---
I'm not trying to say the number of people on this sub is an accurate way to tell player count but it does show how many people have stopped using this sub on a daily basis and that number is in the thousands
---
Just wait until you get Escape Artist! Also: use The Fixer for now, TRUST me. The perfect mid level weapon.
---
4’s gameplay is really strong, but it’s hard to roleplay with only 4 options per conversation and yea the story is not good
---
Awesome idea

You drank too much Nukashine possibly?
---
-60% spoilage rate I've found to be more than enough, and I like having an extra 3 points for another luck card instead of GWS.
---
ah gotcha! savvy business sense this one has!
---
That would be great! Thanks a bunch! My gamer tag is:

---
Could we make Eastern Regional Penitentiary Winterfell or Grafton and Watoga Kings Landing
---
Yeah I feel you. 
---
I just hope everybody sees the fun in it. 
---
We thought it was super funny and we would love to see someone else turning up at our camp rating it. 
---
But not everybody plays the same way ofc
---
The server is called survival. Not deathmatch. And you can PVP at workshops in survival FYI. If you want to be marked then you can PAY CAPS for it and make yourself wanted.
---
May I remind you the survival server is next to dead? This is a whole RPG game too, mind you. That's next to impossible to do for the average player. Hence the survival server being dead. It's not survival, it's 100% inevitably die. Use the wanted system, it's not like you people don't dupe for caps anyways. 
---
P.S. Do you have xbox? I'd love to fight you.
---
Varmint Rifle?
---
I'd have given the mod more credit if it would be available for Power Armor too
---
Sadly not... I wish it was that case but nope...
---
Bloodied itself is +80% damage below 20% hp. You can get it up to +95% but then you die when Well Fed wears off. People usually stack it with Adrenal Reaction (+50% below 20% hp) and sometimes Nerd Rage (+20% below 20% hp). Those all stack multiplicatively for a 224% damage boost.
---
I'm actually running AA on my stealth sniper main ... it's been feeling alright. But then the other day I ended up sitting alone in stealth vs an Alpha at Project Paradise. It couldn't see through my stealth at all.  
---
So I sat there ...
---
* 3-star AA pibe bolt action  
---
* 9 rifleman + 4 gunslinger (they both work on pibe bolt rifle)  
---
* 3 bloody mess  
---
* constant stealth  
---
* vats crit every 3rd hit  
---
* ballistic bock active  
---
* overdrive active  
---
... firing at the thing for like 2 minutes, watching the health bare slowly crawl down.  
---
Then some dude showed up with what was probably a bloodied+explosive weapon of some sort, and took the last 50% health out in 5 seconds flat.  
---
So ... maybe it's time to surrender and get a better weapon mod :)
---
Or you can sell scrap steel and lead to other players, you can make a big profit
---
They don't drop their own hides.
---
They seem to be rare loot from containers.
---
Sand wich
---
I got an email last week that my shipping address has been verified and they're getting them ready to ship. I had to reach out to them to get that info, though.
---
They are very slow to respond, and won't respond at all to support tickets that report well known issues.
---
If they do respond to support tickets regarding missing Items, it's only with a canned email stating that they do not have the Tools to replace Lost game Items.
---
This. I've ben snagging two star weapons since scrip launched, daily, and have yet to get anything useful. Whenever I do get a good combo, it's on a weak ass weapon option (thank you for the Vampire Swingspeed Pool Cue, I'll... yeah, no, to the grinder)
---
1) Kill Super mutants and mole miners
---
2) Sell their crap for caps
---
3) Profit
---
225 caps each
---
Happened to me today in grafton
---
1.cake
---
2. I’ll keep that in mind
---
Not going to lie, I almost want to level a character to use the Alien Blaster (FC Modded) just to see the look on people's faces.
---
No
---
I kind of like that actually. It's like a server wide game of hunter/hunted.
---
Don't believe so, reward from Encryptid is where I got it. First character was lucky got it first time, second took about 7 completions before RNGsus was kind
---
Unfortunatly not. The Fixer plans drop from the imposter squatch event
---
Wouldnt be elder maxon it would be someone else, elder maxon was a kid in fo3 200years post bombs then fo4 is like 10 or so years after that but fo76 is only 24 years after the bomb so elder maxon wont be born for about 176 more years and wont be have command of the BoS for many years after after that somewhere between fo3 and fo4
---
I have never played with anything sustained over 15. My best is hitting 25ish
---
I didn’t think it worked for anyone
---
 You will need a Dense chest. ;)
---
Dude how about just clean underwear?  For reals man nothing worse than having your skirt blow up in a screenshot and it's just ass streaks.
---
That could've worked but my issue is that you were so locked into a pre-designated story, which isn't necessarily bad in the case of any of the other Fallout games but this one took it a step too far with a pre-determined wife/husband and son. Part of what makes RPGs fun is that you get to have a say who your character is and FO4 was just way too linear and short at that. You go to the Vault, wake up, your S/O dies, where's Shaun, Shaun is Father, decide, the end.
---
Personally I would've made the story more psychological and closer to Far Harbor which was superior to the main story for me. Draw some inspiration from Westworld and Blade Runner, noir with a technological flair and questions on what it means to be human in a post-Apocalyptic world where humanity doesn't matter anymore. Of course I'd leave it up to the player but there could be genuine questions about yourself, are you human or synth? Does it matter? That should've been the story, not finding my son I never asked for.
---
Sigh, so that probably means in the next few months they are going to be adding something to the Atom shop that either lets you make fusion cores from other ammo(the ammo converter), or something that reduces their use. 
---
This is the same exact thing that happened to durability of all items a month or two prior to the release of repair kits.
---
I hadn't been to WS in over a week, popped in for a run and scored a 3* bloodied meat hook and a 2* instigating shotgun. I had quit the place previously because it had been dropping trash...maybe you have to lay off for a period? Just my paranoid notion of RNG in game?
---
Someone has been finding them in containers in Fort Defiance
---
If someones bought it already, ill give you 500caps towards finding one
---
I'd be okay with 4 options, but they'd have to be actual options, not just variations of a yes/no toggle.
---
LOL. On PC its no problem at all.
---
Agreed, it's not fun it's just annoying and should just be removed, floating camps should also not be allowed, they're ugly as hell.
---
my personal build is more inline with a loner explosives setup
---
this is what i normally use  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f336f3b&amp;d=s01sq2s32sr2ls2lt2ic3s12s22eh2l71lu2pq1p10a02ip2sb0c72cu0cr0ib4&amp;w=cm1&amp;n=&amp;m=9fce851023h4](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f336f3b&amp;d=s01sq2s32sr2ls2lt2ic3s12s22eh2l71lu2pq1p10a02ip2sb0c72cu0cr0ib4&amp;w=cm1&amp;n=&amp;m=9fce851023h4)
---
They don't. People have checked. Please, save yourself some time. :)
---
I'm with you there, my 7yo can barely grasp the concept of "don't run in guns blazing." So many times I have to bail his little ass out of the shit.
---
Just the other day we were doing some father and son raiding on peoples workshops and he goes running in again, shooting at everything like turrets, and I'm like "Fuck son, you're going to get us killed!" He actually got the dude though, while I was popping drugs, he was doing all the work.
---
So I guess the little shits can be good for some things at least.
---
Compared to past games they suck.    
---
Other Bethesda games had way better npc banter and it made the game feel a lot more alive:

Why they don't have actual conversations is beyond me.  Sure there's occasional random encounters but the rank and file Supermutants are way too vanilla :(
---
A good example is what I did, I max out gunsmith but now if I use that card I don’t have much room for my power armor cards (there’s ones about fusion cores which can be hard to come by) and a few other ones in different specials. I ended up with 14 in intelligence because I wasn’t paying much attention to what I was actually doing and now I’m having to respec points to use other cards. Now I have a level 5 gunsmith I’m not using and had to make a level 3 instead to make room for different cards. 
---
Side note too: as you level up further, there’s no need to keep the ones that double armor repair, weapon repair, double ammo making, chemist, and a few others equipped when not actually using. Pretty sure that’s one reason my intelligence is overly high. Now I just take what I’m not using out to replace it with what I’m gonna use for those 5 minutes and then back again when I’m done. (Same for hacking and picklocking)
---
Yay to Flea Markets and change the title of this post to get big upvotes!
---
Fully staffed? O\_o elaborate?
---
No.  You farm what your able to stomachs, then you just pay for the rest. 
---
It’s the most painful grind in the game, so it’s you either waste your free time and burn yourself out or you play regularly and pay.
---
If you want it badly enough, it’s worth it.  If your a cheap ass looking for more welfare handout level vendor gimmes, then you do without, because honestly, those idiots that undersell to ruin the economy are so not the types to put the effort into getting even one of these pieces anyways.
---
are the asylum hats worth anything?
---
Players use workshops in adventure mode for PvP, it's what they were designed for. The game warns you of this with a message when you claim one. A player coming to claim your workshop probably wants to just fight you, not use the workshop unless it's a really useful one (Munitions factory for example).
---
It was never fixed in the first place. It's harder to trigger, sure, but you can still get it pretty consistently with some weapons
---
I guess skinning a Deathclaw is something we don't have the skill for, does that make my Deathclaw rug a fake?
---
Herding cats on Reddit again? Have they ever all lined up on time?
---
I get that you don't like this happening, but the real discussion needs to be productive solutions. Like having parenthesis at the end of weapons and armor categories that indicate the number of legendaries in that group.
---
still bugged
---
Get the Marine Tactical Helmet plans. It only costs 1 glass, 1 plastic, and 3 rubber to craft and you get about 28c per helmet. With super duper on you get a ton more when you craft them. And they weight next to nothing. I have over 90 in my inventory and I clear the vendor out daily.
---
Also use partyboy perk to give 3cha for your beers.
---
Got another one last night at encrypted. It still drops kind of regular, more rare than the basic outfits and fedora though.
---
Yeah, but it's just steel to replace
---
If you need one later tonight I will hook you up.   I get my kicks by making it and the BOS rifle for lower levels
---
Boom!  Added it to the shopping list.  I'm only about lvl 24 so far - but I'm having a blast with the playstyle - I go through so many more resources than with my sneak vats rifle build - but the fast paced intense combat is so much fun.
---
I don't have that many crashes compared to others, but they should really optimize the game. I should be able to run this game at a constant 60fps with my RX 580 8G (most of my setting are customized using the ini files, they are considered to be around medium settings, I also disabled grass), but the FPS drops substantially at certain areas like Harpers Ferry and in certain situations like when fighting the scorchbeast queen, even if there are no minions. I also get stutters every 10-20 seconds while traveling. My guess is that the textures are unnecessarily big (who needs a 4k cigarette?). I say that because I could barely run the game with my older 4G GPU at max texture settings, and lowering the texture quality reduced stuttering substantially with my current 8G GPU.
---
dont forget the grenade apw, favorite weapon in nv. 
---
We need 25mm grenades back. 
---
And more wep that use .32. 
---
also heavy wep that use something else than 5mm or 50 cal.
---
In games like diablo where lvls and loot is pretty much the game... You have to start a survival character from scratch and no shared items... At the end of the season or ladder as its called it turns in to a reg character if you want.
---
Also the loot is better or more unique so its a trade off.
---
Its how most loot grind games work. Plus its months not like a week or something
---
I haven't HAD to repair armor in ages, I did repair my legs the other night as they were at like 80% &amp; figured why not (sitting on tons of BF). White knight is in play, and it's excellent. 
---
My weapons do degrade, but I'm running two explosive guns so I fully expect it. One breaks during SBQ switch to the other. Or use one of the 19 improved kits I've stock piled.
---
This conspiracy nonsense is getting out of hand.
---
Gulpers have them in their loot table from what has been said
---
Yeah, that's my biggest fear now. I go lie down in a bed for well rested, go afk to grab a snack or take a bio break, and come back to find I was nuked. I used to figure I was safe. Guess I'll need to make sure I turn off my vendors and crouch to stay off map if I'm gonna be out of earshot of the TV when I take a break.
---
He begged me to take him on the Scorchbeast Queen quest (he was level 24 at the time), and I told him no, he's too low level, he would die pretty much instantly (he didn't have any good radiation gear).  But hey, I'm good to go, so I fast travel there for another run.  I'm running around killing scorched spawn when he starts yelling at me to help, he's going to die.  So I had to bail him out of a few combats and stimpack revive him a few times...but in all fairness, he did stimpack revive me once as well, which I really didn't expect him to be able to do yet (since I've barely gotten him past building level 4 machine gun turrets at my camp).
---
When he attacked the group of 3 high level players though, I pretended like I didn't know him.
---
How do you folks get these images on to Reddit? I can screen capture fine on the Xbox, but don't know how to transfer from Box to phone...
---
BTW way, I agree, the camera feature is excellent!
---
I just watched road warrior for the first time a few days ago and boy howdy is my character getting a major overhaul. Shame that there is no sawed off shotgun in 76 :(
---
Most commonly found in green footlockers, scorchbeast dung piles and super mutant blood-bags. They do not drop from Deathclaws. Insane, but true.
---
Because PVP isn't fun?   
---
In this game as it stands now you either have a "win button" build that will easily take any thing off meta, or you don't, and the first will win in 90% of all cases 1v1.
---
My main character is in the mid hundreds (140-160 I stopped keeping track) I have a tse 50. and a build around it I could walk up to any workshop some one under level 45 owns and take it with almost guaranteed success. I don't because why would I? Anything you can get from one workshop you can get from another, and the more people who have bad experiences with the mess that is pvp "balance" the more people who will either quit and hurt the game, or keep playing but ignore the battle royal mode when it drops which may be worse (because corporate stupidity) for the games lifespan. 
---
Next to no one likes pvp in this game which is why the PVP game mode, events, and radio stations are so empty. They need to just remove PVP from adventure mode no one will miss it, and those who do can just play survival, that is why it exists.
---
 My setup with 3 Fireproof and a Dense Chest allows me to put 40mm into the floor at my feet and suffer no damage. I laugh at exploding cars, grenades and missiles. ;)
---
OK hear me out. i just got Reddit. how do people have badges next to there name like responders and enclave and raiders?
---
i think the Mr. Fuzzy helmet is an old issue
---
Quality work.
---
Nope. You go to 76, walk down to the farm, hit a scorched and it’s done.
---
Hardest part was finding critters
---
It isn't a conspiracy when there are literal posts here that people literally counted the amount of ammo they went through from 100% durability on the weapon to broken and it went down like 25% faster.
---
But hey, believe what you want.
---
Exactly! Some civility... 
---
To each their own!
---
Exactly. Everyone is on edge and paranoid
---
Well fuck
---
Did you find the minigun in one of the mining companies high rise penthouses?
---
If so, then there is a uniquely skinned minigun (explained by lore), but once you pick it up, it turns into a normal minigun.
---
Yeah, I figured I was safe. Not too close to much of anything worth nuking. But with vendors it's become easier to target camps, I suppose.
---
[Maybe something similar to this?](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=56375ff&amp;d=sg2p02eh2c72ic4ab2af1an2ao0a51ai1a30a00l71l12lt2lv2lk2lu0s01cu2pe2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=59cf)
---
Pistols are tough because they need the damage bonuses from sneak attacks, but that takes away points from the damage cards. A better build might only put one point into each of the three damage cards and everything else into gun Fu and adrenaline. I don't have the time to do all the maths at the moment, but I would build off that.
---
I've gotten a couple from junk piles.
---
No the hats are super common so worthless really, just the uniforms that are a good find, some uniforms are worth more than others, from what I remember Forrest will sell for loooaaads, brown not so much but still looking at over 1k
---
If your on Ps4 and looking to get a higher level Fixer I can craft you one for free also I don't believe you can scrap Fixers.
---
Would be interesting to try at least. See if it sticks.
---
It seems to be prioratised by enemies, and is a waste of budget on how they get destroyed by absolutely everything! At worst they need a bigger health bar, at best they need to be invincible like stairs!
---
Be sure to visit your subjects while wearing a bathrobe and tinfoil hat sire. Long may be reign.
---
Pretty sure you'd lure an alpha bloatfly and kill off the non aggressive spawn?
---
I connected an external USB to my PS4, copy the media, and then uploaded them to my PC. You can also share them to your social media account and then save the photo to your phone that way.
---
I played the first two when they came out and tactics later on, but there's something about 3. Maybe because it's the first 3d fallout. The vista when you first leave the vault is amazing. 
---
An all time classic in my opinion.
---
I left shortly after my camp was razed (after I got my junk back) since I needed to rebuild.
---
No one forgets any of that.. Thats the nature of ladder. Sometimes your in and its all you play other times you say fuck all that work and play regular.
---
This is quite litterly how every loot+lvls works. And in every case the loot is more rare or unique so in the end if you didnt play a ton.. You prob got some stuff you cant find in adventure mode and that char is now adventure. So at that point you trade or move items and keep or delete that char.
---
This is a cute idea
---
Do rabbits count as critters?
---
Good, maybe they'll learn! We're rebuilding America, not making trash piles! Make Appalachia Great Again (not affiliated with MAGA)
---
I read a reply on another post that they had contacted Bethesda and they asked the person to verify shipping address since they were preparing them, so take that for what it’s worth.

I haven’t seen anything official about it, but if you ask the angry YouTubers, they’d tell you it’s time to go burn Bethesda down since they may not perfectly make it within 6 months.
---
If you do arktos regular, you can get a full core off that robot in A. Been selling my extras, they go fast.
---
Unfortunately no. Your best option is to use radaway diluted and pray... keep using until the desired mutation is cured. Then go buy some serums to replace any mutations you lost and still want.
---
That's a douche move.    
---
New players can actually use those serums and there's a million easier ways to make caps than spending a fortune fast travelling and searching camps for cheap serums.  
---
Protip: spend that time killing enemies that have guns, gather all the guns, then take them to the closest vendor and sell them with "hard bargain" rank 3 equipped.  I guarantee you will earn 1400 caps per day faster without screwing over every noob on your server and you will also find legendary items while you are at it.
---
Yep. I'd figured no one would waste a nuke on a camp without much around it. I was quite wrong. Now I'll have to make sure to hide it if I'm going afk.
---
I've scrapped quite a few, and I'm able to do nearly every weapon mod in the game, but the only thing I can do to the LMG is a Long Barrel mod that only slightly increases the Range, while also decreasing durability.
---
I have heard that there is also a muzzle Break Mod for it, but newer seen one, and the one I use regularly has an 85 round Drum magazine, but that's how it was equipped when I got it as a Drop from a SuperMutant.
---
ill build something better when they fix the camp
---
Longer than expected. Arranging large scale manufacturing is itself a nightmare, probably had production issues at this point, and sending it to some before others would just churn up more shit.
---
Herding cats? Is this a euphemism for something?
---
I suppose it's possible. Just looked like all the locations that had been nuked had camps in them, so I'm thinking it was intentional.
---
LOL. The Pistol, does better DPS. Well than a normal one anyway.
---
OK, I'll try that. Thanks! Wish there was s more direct route...
---
Except the forest.
---
I still need to get around to playing the first two and tactics. I just love the feel of the game good weapons in dangerous locations the feel of Megaton it feels amazing
---
Definitely this for long term vendorbot income. It’s the money making method that basically replaced the civil war top hat. 
---
But also player vending pulls in tons of caps if done right. If you still have left over Fasnacht stuff, it sells for a decent amount of caps. Go to grafton station and buy the three BoS combat armor plans, sell them for 500-1000 caps each, people will buy them. Also at the enclave bunker you can buy x-01 military paint at the production terminal, then flip them at your vending machines for3-5x the cost if not more. Server hop to get as many of the mentioned plans as you want
---
and then... I log on in a rainy sunday… claim every workshop in the forest... and sit on them all day long.
---
THAT is why you can kill and take another workshop.
---
.50 is best, then "refined" .50, then hardened .308.  
---
If your .50 is worse than hardened .308 it's because you don't have the correct version of .50.  
---
The other benefit of .50 is you can craft 180 per pop before superduper with ammosmith.
---
I don’t think so. The best thing would be to get your rifleman perk cards to increase damage.
---
try the 50 refined receiver.  
---
If not so equipped, add a stock.... 
---
The one that looks the same as the one on sniper rifles adds a couple points damage.
---
For the most part, anything that does not try and change gameplay (that is game systems) should be fine. I've been using a few mods since February, mostly ones to make hard to see things easier (like making meat piles glow so I can find the fuckers after a big fight).
---
You have Yes, Begrudging Yes, Sarcastic Yes, and asking for more money
---
Didn't read all but some great ideas :)
---
Robots in fallout 4 made the game so much more fun honestly
---
Go to the fo76 page and then press the three dots at the top and press change user flair and options pop up
---
Do you remember the owner's name? Add him/her as a friend and server hop to him/her when online?
---
Maybe you’ll “come to” near a vendor with something better than that...
---
Hippity liked his jar. Nice and safe from the predators where I found him. Hops has taken well to his jar, too. Though occasionally it'll bounce around when he gets restless and needs to take a dip in the pond.
---
Thank you for your most important answer
---
Attention gore mounds, deathclaw hides are NOT valid currency.
---
NO NAME3 FOR THE VENDOR
---
What code?
---
Jesus. Y'all make me sick, taking the struggle away from them is doing them a disservice. Giving advice is one thing, but free loot and experience farm is taking away from the game experience for them.
---
They get a cool legendary drop finally after killing a hard as shit enemy, but wait it isn't special at all because of the thirty other guns players have just given for zero effort.
---
I keep a two shot auto grenade launcher in my stash til I get a couple hundred then I go blow shit to hell for a minute or two.
---
Yeah this would be the situation to maybe consider a faster firing receiver. Haven’t tested it myself but it may make enough of a difference to be worth it
---
He is talking about ESO, they claimed all DLC would be free as well. So they stopped releasing "dlc" and started releasing "chapters" instead.
---
The Refined .50 mod does more damage. I personally run a VATS Critical Sniper build and make use of the Critical .50 mod. They buffed the 
---
.50 mods a couple of patches ago, so go hunting for one of Refined ones, and I think you will be pleased. I forget right now where and if you can buy them...I am not playing right now, so I can't check.
---
There are some out there. I know a YouTubed named Miz Tracey does them on XBox and I’ve talked to a guy through this sub that does them on PS4. He posted a video here earlier today
---
What level?  I read somewhere L30 is as high as it goes.
---
That's how the pros do it too. You take a lot of pictures and keep the best.
---
Thanks for the help I'll check it out when I get home
---
Might want to relocate. My old camp occasionally got hit by scorchbeasts and other critters of varying danger. This one has, so far, been relatively calm. Just an occasional mongrel, ghoul, or liberator. And always from the same area, so a single turret can usually deal with them.
---
How/where did you get the plans for The Fixer?
---
I'd rather just give them advice, and if they're in over their head, point them to a more level appropriate area.
---
Give a man a fish, teach a man to fish ideology.
---
Agreed. I never used to even think about them, and now they’re another thing I have to manage. Dropping the charge on all the ones you find at random to 25% is part of it, but they definitely drain faster.
---
I've placed 50 some odd camps, and each time I totally start over because I like building. That being said, there's no way I'm going to totally start over because a wall got destroyed. Literally the most I've ever had to rebuild is a few walls and turrets. 
---
This is my current build: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GcInBAj6NA 
---
I can't imagine rebuilding to save some scrap. Just the placement inside the pylon took a while to get perfect.
---
Damn right they're none of your business.
---
In that situation, fast travel to the nearest known location and walk back.
---
I sold a few for 50
---
AMEN to that. I want my place everywhere and scrap everything and cheat terminal! I like to build in pre-existing structures and this game HATES that shit
---
Awesome.  I'm looking forward to seeing this build in all it's glory even more now!
---
Yes, I have an addiction for jumping from server to server farming stuff. It really is random for the most part. Sometimes it can appear that it's dropping specific items for any number of speculations but that's just the randomness doing it's thing. They program the level lists used for legendary items to have a certain chance percentage of a drop. When you start seeing a lot of the same stuff it's because it's drop chance is higher than other items. This is also why you see a lot of crappy 3* items. Certain effects have a higher chance to drop than others. All items are then randomly pulled and applied to the item as it spawns. So essentially it's controlled randomness to a point.
---
Just a normal ham and cheese. Was good though honestly very satisfied.
---
Sorry couldn't resist the low hanging fruit.
---
Mine is working for the excavator. Might be specific to the XO-1, I know that poor thing's had some problems.
---
You mean the cd key?
---
Nukashine hat and flaming shishkabob.
---
Ah, I haven't checked recently I think I'm thinking back to prior patches. Thanks
---
They’re also in toolboxes.
---
I actually forgot about him, I was referring to the escaped institute scientist that you have to cure.
---
I'm talking about Roger Maxson, the founder of the Brotherhood and the one who you can hear on the holotapes in 76. Arthur Maxson, the one you're talking about, is a long descendant of his.
---
It goes as low as 20 and as high as 45 or 50
---
yeah like the ugly scratched nuka quantum paint which is supposed to fucking glow, i‘m livid 
---
gotta figure out how i can port fo4 textures to fo76 so i have less headaches
---
Just FT out. 
---
But I agree, at the very least they could have an open door upstairs or something so people can get out.
---
I was able to keep my marsupial mutation without having to re buy it. I didn't know that taking a rad away only got rid of one mutation at a time. So I only had to buy one mutation (I only want to keep healing factor and marsupial) ... It's too bad I didn't know that though and bought the two. Lol. O well. I can sell the extra marsupial mutation.
---
it would be really cool if we could "export" our character, and get a listing of everything they know, have, stats, perks, etc.  Then people could put up web pages that analyze that dump and tell you things like this, what you don't have, what you could do to improve your build, what your stats would be after changes,  things like that.

I don't think weird builds are half to do with enemy spawns as you think-
---
and a better solution is to just store the camp whenever you leave, problem solved
---
(not saying this about people with elaborate builds, but the people supposedly building weird to prevent damage)
---
Ooooooh
---
Or just don’t go there lol
---
Once. I went to sugar grove, and was fighting a gutsy with the death-gun weapon, and I ducked behind the rocks near the entrance to give the stimpack time to work. Lost track of the gutsy, turn OMFGWUT"CONGR"BLAMBLAMBLAM.
---
Neat
---
How far away were you? The range falloff might have been killing your damage. Also, i don't see tank killer in your perks list. That would have made a huge difference as well would it not?
---
My house is all open but I lock my one door just because people always ask
---
Figured it out after downloading it 3x the amount of gb being downloaded changed to amount left and it bugged out showing i had same or more amount already downloaded the launcher was not finished downloading even though it said it was done. So i left it downloading and it installed just fine.
---
Thanks!
---
So awesome of you to do this. I only found a tourist because of a post like this on here. And I still haven’t found one naturally myself so I can return the favor.
---
The egg salad despite not being a crowd favourite was amazing. I added some fresh onion, green pepper, little bit of garlic, and fresh sliced tomatoes.
---
I fast travelled to a location where I haven't really discovered a lot yet. I didn't think about it to be honest, I didn't think I would be wanted for breaking out. But you're right, should have just fast travelled back.
---
Maybe it's me but I can't imagine anyone needing nocturnal anything ever. Sure the benefit at night is ok, but the ding during the day makes it not good.
---
You also could have server hopped.  I would suggest you think about your situation before taking actions like that.  This is nobody's fault but your own for not being situationally aware of the predicament you're in.
---
I applaud the ingenuity (truly Jigsaw-esque)... yet decry the extent to which this is truly disturbing...
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
\*sigh\* lol
---
Closest thing we have to the TARDIS would be the STASH... but try as I might, I can't come up with anything for those letters, at least that sounds good and makes sense scientifically :P

~~All I got is "~~**~~S~~**~~quished~~ **~~T~~**~~ime~~ **~~A~~**~~nd~~ **~~S~~**~~pace~~ **~~H~~**~~oarding"~~

~~Or if you want to provide some leeway (though, the 'and' representing a letter kinda hurts that), then one could go with: "~~**~~S~~**~~queezing~~ **~~T~~**~~ime~~ **~~A~~**~~nd~~ **~~S~~**~~pace~~ *~~for~~* **~~H~~**~~oarding"~~
---
Scratch all that! This just came to me, so Final Answer, as I like this one best! **"S**^(uperentangled) **T**^(ime) **A**^(nd) **S**^(pace) **H**^(oarding)**"**
---
*^((superentangle/ment seems to be almost a synonym for quantum entanglement, but has fallen out of favor as a term, with the latter being preferred.))*
---
Very informative, thank you!
---
I meanreally naming it should work like i name mine personal t51, x01 and excavator
---
Just name the ones you want to keep 'personal [T60, T51b, etc.]'
---
“We like your idea. We’d like to use it. Please sign this waiver allowing us to use your IP in the game.”
---
Seems like worrying about a lawsuit would be the least of their concerns should they decide to adopt anyone’s ideas.
---
Great! Confirms a lot of things I had assumed. Now, the big one, how does a furious tesla work? Does the first enemy get the stack? Or do they all? Or is it bugged and each arc resets the stack so the prefix is worthless? I have one and just haven't had time to test it as I only use it for campfire tales and a nuked WS golf club.
---
You can name PA just like you can weapons. Inspect it in your inventory and then look for the option to give it another name. I've renamed all my PA so I can tell them apart.
---
This is awesome ill try to come by as well and bask in its glory! greywoods001
---
 Metaphor for trying to do something impossible, like getting a consensus of behavior on Reddit.
---
I don't think it chooses based on your specific character's needs or based on what gear you use/store etc, but I am convinced there is a pattern or some kind of seed. I have 447 hours in the game and have not found one, not even one, double weapon. Multiple quads, but never a double. I've noticed getting many weapons/armor of the same effect in a row, and while that could just be RNG, it's a very consistent trend with a select few effects. I've started keeping track, and I'm seeing some odd things. Assassin's showed up six times already, which makes sense given it shows up on both armor and weapons, but stalker's came 5 times even though it only appears on weapons. Too small sample size to confirm anything, but this supports the pattern I've felt for weeks now
---
Placing wires to power things is a nightmare as well. You can pull a wire from a machine or source, but connecting it to another object takes 2-3+ tries. Often times you have to exit build mode and re-enter it. It was even worse before I realized I didn't have to use the spacebar (jump) to connect it as E or Enter work as well. Somehow seeing yourself jump around when you're trying to connect wires is just the most infuriating thing ever.
---
True. In this context though I’m thinking, is the game seeing I’m in stealth mode a ton and help the sandman perk and blah blah, then making a judgment about what it can give me that will compliment all those aspects.
---
regular .50 is better than refined, by a tiny amount ;)  
---
I don't know what you are on about stocks, they have nothing to do with damage.
---
I didn't want to go there. I wanted to be outside. I don't decide to spawn inside, man.
---
That's what nukes are for.
---
Np, I've scrapped my fair share accidentally too
---
Cool.  May take you up on that if we cross paths.
---
God people who defend the repair kits are so dumb. It literally incentives Bethesda to reduce durability of all weapons and armor and yet morons will still defend it.
---
 A great deal of the problems the game has is that consoles are not really up to it. So  they cram the game into them anyway as its so lucrative.
---
 None of this is my fault. Its you console people, who want it on your toys.
---
I you didn’t do anything wrong. What happens is that you spawn in the camp at the exact location they placed their C.A.M.P. machine facing the same way they were when they placed it. Knowing that, it’s easy to take it into account, but when you fast travel to your own camp you spawn about 20 meters North of where your camp machine has been placed regardless of where it was originally located.
---
I like to cripple a whole line of them and come back and finish them off one by one with  melee
---
Hell yeah love this sandwich positivity going on right now.
---
Great! I expect they should email everyone soon hopefully. After so long addresses might have changed for some buyers.
---
So if there aren't any higher level players in the area, I should be okay to be there if I'm a lower level character (&lt;10 that is).
---
Next time I get on, I'll try and find that place.
---
&gt;  I'm hoping for better luck tonight.
---
This is what I'm hoping for.. We know there are issues and I have faith they will be fixed.. but stop rushing things.. we proved we will wait ...
---
Wtf?
---
Still waiting myself, thanks for this info 👍
---
Ok thanks!
---
Are you willing to periodically say "Diplomatic Immunity" on voice chat? :)
---
I have a Fallout 4 mod with Nightkin in it, whooo they are wild and fun and tough
---
Sure. 
---
Here’s a link to my current build. It still needs a few tweaks but it’s been working well for me and I have fun with it. Mutations are included there too.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2e755da&amp;d=sv0s00po1pg2ph2pp2pi2ej4eh1c72cu0ic4a71ar2au1ao0a00a30an2l71lt1li2lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=1259fec
---
It should be noted, a stealth commando build is not a one-shot build, but most things do go down in 1 second or less. You will use more ammo than a sniper, but much less than a heavy gunner. 
---
For my weapons I have 4 that I rotate between:
---
The Fixer is primary. It uses 45 ammo which is readily available and enhances sneak, so probably 80% of the shots I take with it are sneak crits. I might save a bullet here and there with the executioners handmade, but I just don’t care. 
---
When going against boss type enemies or chaotic events like SBQ or Arktos I switch to an executioners handmade with limb damage. I also have a furious explosive handmade that’s good for the first part of big bosses, but I swap to the executioners once their health is down. 
---
The fourth is a bloodied explosive laser rifle. I don’t run bloodied but with a beam splitter this thing is insane for pvp—on the rather rare occasions I use it. It’s utter garbage for everything else though. While totally OP, it breaks after a couple hundred rounds (from 20%), so it’s not realistic outside of survival. 
---
For armor, I avoid power armor as much as possible and have a mix of different armor pieces. I’m currently trying to build a vanguard set with increased sneak and/or AGI and a mix of weight benefits.
---
Eh, I would just be happy if when I "repair all" it would bring everything in my CAMP back up to 100% instead of just the broken bits.  I wish turrets did more damage too, or that we could upgrade them to fire incendiary or explosive rounds.  I also wish the Contractor perk made repairing your CAMP cheaper.
---
Yeah go figure.
---
You... could just fast travel to the closest location... and be out less caps.
---
YOU PICKED SOMEONE'S LOCKS... no shit you're wanted.
---
What chest armor do you use and where did you find the plan/mod?
---
Oh wait. Sunshine Meadows is just over by the Agricultural Center, isn't it?
---
That's it I'm going to the mire and slaughtering every last gulper tonight
---
Very close actually. Oh and yeah I've got tank killer. Honestly, I'm doing pretty good against most stuff. Level 80 scorchbeasts go down in less than 2 clips. It's stuff like high level Sheepsquatch, and then the really big quest monsters (Imposter Sheepsquatch, SBQ and the Alpha) where my damage feels insufficient. So that's a fairly small portion of the game.  
---
I haven't found a good instigating yet ... dare the day I do, cuz' my weapon weights are already adding up.
---
The only way to operate
---
If you want to lose your wanted status, just hang out near a train station naked, someone will take those caps from you eventually.
---
They craft up to lvl 50. I carry a lvl 50 fixer with me as part of my arsenal
---
At player vendors buy caps bobbleheads, then find a site with cap stash locations. If you run for all of the stashes it's easily 6-8k caps
---
I don't understand what you're saying? I haven't played long enough to know I would get a bounty by getting out. If I'd known, I wouldn't have. I also didn't break anything. I don't understand the whole situationally aware about predicament thing. It is just a game, it's not a big deal? I'm not going to go sit in a corner for not knowing something about a game, and I'm also not going to do it because I for some reason didn't think about the obvious solution. I assumed people were wanted for either breaking someone's camp or killing them or something.
---
Did they increase build size? I could hardly make a provisioned two story house last time I played.
---
Ya'll know what this means right? 
---
The West Virginia runs around naked.  Imagine how tough they would be if they actually wore their hides...
---
I completed I am become death at lvl 33 so your ok in my book
---
Ok thanks
---
Glad I saw this, I scrapped 100 or so recently and nothing unlocked. Nice!
---
Th galleria would be perfect for this and that's one of my fav places. Always reminds me of 80-90s mall movies.
---
I can pm you my psn name if you want
---
It depends on weapons and / or friends, the lowest i have seen that lunched a nuke by he's own was a lv9 :D
---
This is just beautiful
---
VERY COOL. So tell me how does these work? How do you hook them up, and how do you change the colors? I'd apprecaite the info
---
I sell Serums for 250 each, but only make them when I have excess Flux.
---
Weapons &amp; Armor Vary a lot depending on the perks:
---
* Good 3\* Explosive weapons, (Check Reddit for recent sales) I set price around 70% of average.
---
* Cavalier's &amp; Sentinel's Armor = Base Price +2000-3000 depending on Type &amp; Prefix (Assassin's or Unyielding Combat &amp; Marine sells best)  
---
* Weight Reduction Armor Pieces are priced similar to above, with the Weapons Weight reduction pieces being the High end.
---
In general I try to set my prices to something that I wouldn't mind paying for something I wanted, and I'm a bit Frugal.
---
If you see other players buying lots of your stuff and putting it in their machines, then your prices are probably too low, but if you're happy with what you got for it. then who cares what everyone else thinks.
---
I have received messages telling me my prices were way to High, and another moments later thanking me for the great deal they just got from my vending machine.
---
I got that mission around the same level. Just didnt do it till around level 100. Its do-able at that level if you have the gear for it. On my second chatacter i went in with some stims, mothman omelets, and a troubleshooter's melee weapon and didnt really have too much trouboe with it. Id suggest finding a decent group to run it with you though if you dont want to have any troubles with the robots.
---
Oh my god I'm dying.  That's evil and hilarious.
---
I have played with other kids before, but the group in my story above were among the worst. Others I played with were respectful and didnt scream all the time. I just happened upon those 3 first before all the others.
---
The enemies will spawn to your level I constantly see level 9 ghouls.
---
Yeah, should have done that. For some reason that just didn't occur to me at all. But I also didn't know that I would get a bounty for that, I thought it was for breaking a camp or killing players or something. But it would have been nice to have had a way out. It was pretty empty in the locked room I spawned in, so maybe it was a newer player or something.
---
Thanks for the info. Been trying to figure out the best and most efficient weapon for the Queen for a while. I've got a BE 50 cal, a FE 50 cal and a prime TSE Gatling I've been using. May convert the FE back to prime now that flux is easier to come by.
---
&gt; First stop providing new content and focus on the stability of the systems
---
The issue there is people will get bored, the game certainly has a lot of bugs but there won't be a game if it doesn't have any players.

That all ended up with them having Cheat Engine installed a well.
---
And just FYI wearing my excavator power armor the damage with the explosive perks is at 330.
---
Interesting... I'm not sure if it was in one of the houses or somewhere by Fort defence. It was definitely the gilded painting, I know it well cause a while after the beta I got one of those from a Scorched by a queen fight. This minigun looked exactly like that one I got in the past. But maybe the gilded paint is also on the lore Minigun. If I got some time I will check this one in the tower again
---
Oh I gotcha. It through me off for a second because people have been complaining that the animal friend perk hasn’t been functioning properly, hence cats not lining up. :)
---
It is a pointless request, I know, to get people to agree, or even accept what I write as being THE way. I guess I got really frustrated after fast traveling to somebody’s camp and finding a level 5 pipe pistol and Freaking syringer for the 200th time. I guess I just want people to put a little bit of thought into what they put in their machines. I know, herding cats. :)
---
Good idea hopely Bethesda sees this
---
Get the red flight helmet, I bet that looks real nice with the rocketsuit
---
Right down the road
---
I did the exact same thing, its a shame because its a really good weapon especially the 2 shot ones, the ammos a problem too you grind for 2 hours for 5mins of shooting
---
Oh I know. I encountered people who contest workshops just to kill whoever has it. I have also encountered low level players that think for some reason they can fight someone higher level than them and I mean like a lvl 8 attacking me at lvl 225 and full BOS gear. 
---
Then again I am guilty of some of shenanigans of my own like wearing a piece of chameleon gear and contesting a workshop just to play to hide and seek with the owner.
---
[check our our community ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBbzY1mPTcvecWLWReQtjw)
---
Selling all the mole miners weapons after urianum fever. Get 300-600c depending on how many spawn.
---
Nice job never knew you could do that
---
I don't think they have... I had a 5 story house before with a steel extractor and Brahmin, and that takes up a good amount of budget. Maybe you had too many decorations or foundations? Even making a larger house can eat up a lot of budget, most of these buildings are four squares by two and some are two by one. I think my largest is the barn, and only because it's tall enough for a loft too. Also there used to be a bug where wires didn't delete unless you specifically deleted them before scrapping what they were attached too. The wires would turn invisible and still eat up budget
---
Instigating is really much better for PvE. Think of how often you have even the slightest bit of radiation. That eliminated the instigating effect. You're much better off in PvP with AAE weapons, Faster Reload Speed, Faster Fire Rate, and things like that. If you don't 1 shot someone they have a great chance of 1 shotting you back.
---
Not sure why someone might need more than 3, but you can always place them down at the same time to temporarily negate their weight on your inventory.
---
Yeah I learned early on that picking a lock is bad. Someone had a workshop and my first day of playing I didn't know what that meant, and I was just wandering around looking at shit, and I picked a lock to a container and suddenly 5 cap bounty and me going wtf and then a high level FTing in and killing me and taking my loot. Lesson learned lol.
---
And why would I need to do that😂
---
And yet you felt it proper to come here and air your complaint against people locking their doors.  They didn't do anything wrong, you did by picking the lock.  Now you get to pay the piper for your actions, not for theirs.

hehehe nice one!

Way better than being negative about a game, that there is a good chance anyone who reads this currently plays. Sure things could be different, but so could every aspect of life. Why not just slow down and enjoy things for what they are. Like a beautifully crafted sandwich, not only is it pleasing to the senses, but it has purpose to satisfy your hunger.
---
No one is asking for fallout to be like fortnite. Any battle royale mode asked for has been more like a minecraft battle royale than fortnite. There should be more of that PvE stuff and a shit ton more of the PvP and survival stuff too.
---
Still no change on my ticket since March... Can't take this long to make a fricking bag.... You can guarantee it will still be shit
---
Ok, then here's what I do. I use my instigating and other high damage single-shot weapons for the things I know I can take down in one shot. Or I use my inst gauss to soften them up. Then I switch to my TSE Handmade to finish it. Or, in the case of an SB, I just use that from the start since they are so hard to hit. The lower damage but higher rate of fire seems to let me take down the tankier enemies faster than I can with my snipers. I also do this when I lose stealth. Or I'll switch to shotgun if they get really too close for an exploding weapon. I have action boy in unless I know I'm going somewhere where I'm likely to lose stealth (westek) and then I'll put in enforcer instead. So if I am found, then I can cripple legs to keep from being bum rushed.
---
You dropped your tin foil hat.
---
I was thinking of making a post similar since I am starting a melee build.  I am doing bloody fist melee build.  The thing I am seeing as a down side is flying targets...Like SBQ, SB, and cargobots for nuke cards.  What do you guys do for those kind of targets?  Also open to suggestions on builds.  I found one on the interwebs but not sure if it is the best.
---
Xbox?
---
You can rock the Mistress of Mystery Veil? That's yellow. =P
---
They made things use less budget. Like lights, walls, roofs, turrets ect
---
Yep. I had seen a previous post about someone getting a reply from Bethesda so I went back to my old support email and asked for an update. They replied that they'd verified my shipping address and were getting them ready to ship. No info on when though. I've seen a couple other people get this same email too.
---
We need more PvP modes. The survival beta at the moment is a total failure in terms of PvP and player enjoyment.
---
Ah, that makes a lot of sense, thank you. 
---
But I should have just fast travelled back, for some reason that just didn't occur to me at all, and I honestly didn't know that I would be wanted for opening the lock to get out.
---
Builders wouldn't do this if we could plop down a flat building on an area that was not pancake flat...
---
Right now this is the only type of building that you can move without a complete tear down.
---
Last time time happened to me buddy locked me in a room in his house. After i picked out he tried to kill me (i think he was trying to take back the bulk i bought from hos shop but idk). Needless to say he was not ready for a TSE 50. Cal machinegun to tear through his base like its confetti.
---
This is exactly what griefing via locks can result in.....people should remember that whenever they go to do it "like do i really want a pissed of and agressive guy stuck in base?"
---
Someone came by and killed me, so it's all good 🤘😎
---
When I change stocks, it tweaks the damage a bit.  
---
As you cycle through the options for stocks, watch the comments change - wording similar to Better bash, better hip fire, better recoil....  The dmg value goes up/down a couple points depending on which stock is selected.
---
IIRC, changing one of my rifles from 308 to 50 added about 10 points dmg, and the stock added 3-4 more - so changing to regular 50 and installing a different stock made for about 15 more dmg over the 308.  Changing from regular 50 to refined 50 added about 5 more.
---
Yea np my dude. I found him on my first try (no bs i was actually at wavy willards for the tadpole challenge that needs the camera) so i figured the least i could do is share my ungodly luck
---
Exactly - it needs to be only certain objects. Some of it makes sense - animals coming in an eating your crops, mutants after your resources and generators, wolves coming after your brahmin. Those things should be capable of being destroyed (and doors, logically attempting to allow enemies to get inside your building).
---
However, having one scorched enemy spawn a half mile from my base and just sit there shooting a wall for 15 minutes... that just doesn't make sense. Why is that mole rat attacking a steel pylon? Did my chemistry station anger that wolf somehow? That shit doesn't make sense and it's just annoying. 
---
If anything, I think it'd be better if they ignored most of the crap in your camp and targeted items by trying to path to it. Yeah, some people will find a way to screw up the pathing or make parts of their base invincible and avoid the system. But maybe it wont look like a staircase to the sky as an end product.
---
Awesome, I'm doing similar with Ninja and melee weapons but want to add some ranged ability. 
---
Does Commando work with SMG/10mmSub?
---
There are lots of quiet places NW of Watoga even has level 91 Death claws stopping in to say hi!
---
What about defense? If I did that a mole rat would spawn in each building and destroy everything
---
Blackbird was available only once and was limited mostly to someone who was patiently sticking to the game from the very start.
---
Since it is re-released now, it's worth nothing as it is no longer a limited stock, but yet another paint.
---
Technically this translates into nothing really being exclusive in Beth world.
---
Whining could bring anything limited back into the stock.
---
My encounter with him was... "They say beauty is on the inside, too bad for you your inside is filled with RADs"
---
Oh yeah I do like messing with workshop owners in chameleon as well lol.
---
It's already in the game files, just be patient
---
I mean if he only wants some scratches and tickles we could get along
---
But shooting a hunting rifle at a wall doesn't make sense, so why is there a scorched constantly doing it to my base? 
---
The system can easily be improved and still be a challenge.
---
Adding and submitting.
---
This is solid advice.  If you claim a workshop, once the "Prepared for Attack" notice pops up, keep an eye on the world map for players suddenly appearing close by or heading to your position.  If nobody shows up, finish off the "Attack" and split.
---
If you have decent gear, you should be fine
---
20/30/40/50
---
So true.
---
Yeah I am right there with you, but a poster or any of the little metal signs are far less budget than any of the letter items. I don't know why but that is the way of things. They can even be fancier than the letter items.
---
My best friend is 30 and he also begs for junk lol
---
We should at least be able to export the plans and recipes we learned to our new characters we make, but not the mods.
---
The creatures always spawn on the outside and they have to run around to the center with the stairs to the raised platform. Plus my customers usually help out and I have some friends who always pop in to hang out in the town so it feels a little more lively and they take care of them too. Remember, extermination is everyone's job!

Yeah, where did they get that "radio version?"
---
I can only hope
---
I carry 2 handmades for different purposes. The instigating uses hardened but the tse uses tuned. You can even flub on the perf mag and go stinging for the extra ammo per clip, but found using cripple and long fights- quick hands is good enough, keep the perf mag for the aa.
---
You can always use the endangerol styringer too. Quick hands usually procs at least once in a boss fight like arktos and gives you 40 rounds that clip. The fight doesn't last long enough to care for much more.
---
Instigating is the king for high health builds, far as pve imo but sucks for the boss. Bloodied doesn't have any of these problems, carry a hunting rifle, handmade, dragon whatever it can one hit anything outside of a the mirlurk queen and sbq. Even scorchbeast are one hit.
---
I was carrying about 14 on me when I got the quest.
---
They all poofed...and all I had was the single diamond marked one you pick up at the terminal.

I'm usually on during weekends. I'm down to help you with anything you get stuck with (quests/enemies/builds). SN: MoonlightCowboy
---
I sell serums at my camp for less than I can sell them to robots. I don't have any problems making 1400 a day at the robots, selling guns from scorched and mutants, so anything on top of that is just gravy.
---
I went to white springs for those recipes but the robot didn't have the blackberry honey crisp, cranberry meatball grinder, or the reared venison. Is there any other place I can get these recipes?
---
Another reason jetpacks aren't worth it. Marsupial is good enough in 99% of situations. I usually take 2 power plants for like an hour and a half and then have enough cores for about a week or two
---
Concentrated Fire and Covert Operative will increase damage by 5x for head shot sneak attacks. Also consider critical damage perks. Black powder weapons have high base damage, critical damage is based on the base damage of a weapon, so it only seems natural.
---
Maybe have a 10mm or .38 pistol with aligned mods and red dot sight for AP reduction. Build a critical with a silenced pistol, swap to the BPP, and one shot the bosses.
---
That is my best guess. I dabbled in a BPP for awhile until Bethesda removed one shots.
---
Is that a definite? I got one from a SB last night (doing surface to air at survey camp alpha). Also got a heart and lung from the same corpse. The only other one I've had was in aaronholt homestead
---
Looks awesome Floop!
---
There isn't a compendium if that's what you're asking. But if you don't know what someone means by someone, ask.
---
Bloodied is a legendary effect that can be on weapons. The lower your health, the higher the damage. It seems like it would be bad, with low health, but if you use stimpaks and perks that help you die less it's one of the best things in the game.
---
They don't always spawn on the outside, sometimes they're in the barn already. I lied. I still don't mind unless they take out the Genny. My visitors *are* usually helpful
---
Unfortunately no. I tried last night with a low lvl buddy. It doesn't let you trade or drop the prosnap delux. 😒
---
Calling people that do that "builders" is being generous.
---
Ha, I've played for about a month now and I just figured out how the workshops work the other day. I didn't know about the locks though, I play hermit style and haven't really interacted with anyone, so I didn't know how the bounty thing worked either. I do now though 😂
---
Good point! Thanks
---
I see blackpowder as a nice add on to any build rather then the base. I use em as panic buttons. Or opening stealth shot
---
Unless you want to be a pirate.... Then you get a bunch of them (they are fairly light)
---
Seems like maybe AA was intended to compliment low damage high ROF guns.
---
It always feels like my AA 10mm SMG and AA LMG are very effective and hit harder than any of my other AA guns. I don't like AA at all on stuff like the hunting rifle or the shotguns.
---
Sort of like how Instigating is poor on high ROF low damage guns but is excellent on slow firing high damage guns.
---
Hahahaha just watched it 😂 did you shoot him every time after he said it lol
---
Thanks Frogo! Appreciate you checking it out, man. Sorry there isn't a basement and you can't pop over to hang out

Totally understand the frustration, and sometimes it gets the best of me, but when cooler head prevail I can't / won't bad mouth the staff regarding this, mainly because I know from working for large corporations that the "Process" alone can cause what should be a 10 minute fix turn into a weeks worth of meetings and reports.   
---
What would be awesome is if they took this and others work, and used it to quickly push through and fix many of the issues.
---
Good place to store those weighty Mini Nukes.
---
A noise...
---
I had several times on PS4 last evening that I had to completely stop the program and restart, (froze up 3 times, server crashed 1 time, and got the lovely blue screen program death 1 time),  so this is going on cross platform.  I will also say that there are still multiple issues with trying to run Project Paradise.  I agree that it would be great to fix these issues as it makes playing in this amazing world so frustrating.  Unfortunately the fan base is super hungry and will tear through any new content almost the moment it drops.  The game is loved I do hope everyone can agree that stability should come first.
---
I have plenty of plasma for him!
---
As long as you can manage to hit one target at a time with mobs.
---
Was instigating nerfed or something to 50% extra damage? Because I swear it was double damage at full health targets. Not 50% more
---
Yeah there really has to be a balance here. An MMO lives or dies on continual content.
---
They could buy some time with a repeatable raid style dungeon I think but otherwise they are going have to keep providing constantly.
---
How have you handled some of the context with him?
---
My oldest daughter is 5, and we just started getting into Minecraft. She's been on my lap a couple times in 76, in places I knew were safe (no mobs), but otherwise I'm a little leary on getting to the more aggressive stuff. I'm sure she'd like adventuring more, but I'm not quite up on child development regarding things like Bloody Mess and meat piles and all that.
---
is this code for water sports? asking for a friend ( not R Kelly)
---
Right there with you OP on the community support tools. Man they need them bad.
---
Really?
---
I should probably have put a smiley or something in the post, yes. To me it was mostly funny and confusing. As I said, I didn't know that I wasn't allowed to pick the lock to get out. If I'd known, I wouldn't have. But I didn't. Just got killed so the bounty is gone and all is well. 👍

This has happend to me with eyebots but my favorite was when all the ghouls were still asleep and sliding across the ground and attacking me when they were just lying there

Partly indeed.

But we'll see where Beth takes us. Only started to lower my expectations as they still sorting the game as it seems.

Yeah, I saw someone selling one for 5k on their vending machine.  I must admit I was tempted.

Dude. Line space!

---
Happened to my buddy the other day. We couldn’t figure out if we just got too high and used them during crafting or if they disappeared.... I’m pretty sure they disappeared though because we were out doing events for like an hour an a half prior to noticing the lack of screws. PS4?
---
I mean, why bother locking?
---
Did you drop them? Or put them in your box
---
I bought a new PC as my previous system running FO4 at mid was not enough... Still was not enough until recently with 1070ti and Ryzen 2600.
---
How does it work with shotguns? Will a stray pellet on another target reset the stack?
---
Yes ps4. I started noticing when I’d scrap a ton of stuff that SHOULD have screws and only got 1 or 2
---
I had a similar experience.  Never again.
---
I was at my camp one day and got a party invite.  I accepted thinking they wanted to trade or get a free fast travel.  He arrives and sends me a party chat request, ok fine, I accept.  There's no way this kid is more than 12 but we trade out our useless ammo and he offers to build me X-01 if i have the mats. Score!  So I follow him to his CAMP and he makes me the armor.  I pay him back with mats for his own stuff and whatever else I can think of.  For the next 2 hours he asks me to follow him around grinding junk.  I follow along because I'm grateful for my new armor, but he's just getting more annoying as time goes on.
---
"Got any screws?"
---
"I'm really low on aluminum."
---
"How much do you want for your bloodied sniper?"
---
When it's finally time to go he sends me a friend request and I'm too nice of a person so I accepted it.  For the next week, every time I turned on my PS4 I would get party requests and messages even if I wasn't playing FO76.  When I actually was playing I would accept but all he wanted to do was grind more mats. The final straw was when he was using the annoying Youtube meme compilation style talk and actually pulled up a fucking sound board of the sound effects.  No way in hell am I going to sit there and listen to dank meme sound effects while trying to play my game. 
---
Log out, block PSN, never again.
---
this one time I bumped into a decent kid who was struggling along at a low level. I asked if I could tag along on his quest. I was just looking for pioneer pics and collect junk. talked him through some of the basics and the whole time my daughter (9) has watching and talking loud so he could her he in the background. 
---
LOL, "tell him hi", "go right" ..."hammer to yo face"
---
They're probably less useful on console but on PC you can hotkey an item like coffee or quantum and just hit the button for an instant AP refresh.
---
I pvp a lot easy wanted level and because people ask
---
Sheepsquach is easily my favorite mob in 76. This is a dope shot :D
---
I take offense to this but at least I built mine inside a overhead power line support structer.
---
I noticed when I put them in my stash or scrapped something that should have them
---
I wish Taggerty was still alive so she could give us quests; I liked the connection to Maxson being part of the FO76 BOS story, but being on your own makes for some cool potential in what to do with this version of the BOS.
---
*insert bubblegum joke about loose screws here*
---
Ha, maybe he learned from it then?
---
I don't know if this was a trap, it was very empty in the room I was locked in, but it could also just be a newer player or something. But at least now I know how the wanted thing works, and also that I'm not allowed to pick locks to get out 😂
---
screws fall out all the time. The world's an imperfect place.
---
If you want someone to read what you write, you need to utilize commas and periods.

Any thoughts on an additional bot that you could customize strictly for dueling other player's bots and betting caps on the battles with a possible level system for the bots when they win?
---
Always a way 😎

It's a trade secret.

The only legendary we've seen there, IIRC was infinite durability. That's not really helpful for pvp.

The Fixer is an item reward toward the end of the Lying Lowe quest. Sadly, the one you get is a level 30. The plans themselves are an uncommon drop from Encryptid. Not exactly rare, but you’ll need to run it a few times for sure. Then you can make a level 50.
---
Temporary is such a lovely flexible term, innit?

I got one from a junk pile

Afaik
---
I love that you get an insult note from the robot.
---
I think you are correct.  I am continuously encumbered and never get more than one respawn point when I die.  The only time I got a "random" respawn point was after dying four times in a row - ended up inside a nuclear blast area w/o Power Armour on and immediately under attack by multiple irradiated Anglers.  Fear the random respawn!
---
I've been lucky with super polite kids.  There was this Aussie kid, probably no older than 12 who was looking around my shop.  He bought a hazmat suit and some plans, and then saw a tricked out level 10 hunting rifle I was selling for 20 caps (I always keep some low level gear for sale cheap since I live in Flatwoods).  He didn't have the caps, so he got on his mic and asked if I'd be willing to trade it for whatever junk or ammo he had.  Since my character is a woman, I was always referred to as "ma'am."  Long story short, I hooked him up with the gun and about 500 rounds for free.  Those of us who are older should do what we can to teach young gamers not to grow up to be toolbags.
---
If we want to go down that path why do they charge at players without any weapons when the world is filled with a bounty of weapons?  Why don't they collect caps and buy better weapons from vendors to really fuck your wall up?  Why don't they pick your locks, go into your C.A.M.P. and destroy your generator directly?
---
If you're looking for immersion, they're infected with the scorched plague and have lost their minds so their attacks are going to be poorly thought out.  If you're looking for a real answer, their AI is limited and developers aren't going to program them to have a well thought out attack plan with your C.A.M.P. so that's why they're shooting at your wall.
---
Gotta let someone kill you to get rid of the wanted status.
---
Could always fast travel somewhere else to get out without picking locks.
---
Rabbit season.
---
Yeah so... my thoughts are that if power armor is buffed for pvp and put on par with the current sentinel meta, everyone will just use that instead of trading for GG armor. So I don't think buffing PA to be on par should be a thing. Buffing it a little maybe yes, but not too much. Then, legendary effects should be added to it, similar to regular armor. This seems OP at first, but if you look at the DR numbers, Power armor is only slightly ahead of regular armor, and regular armor also has the benefit of added explosive damage protection, which power armor does not get (which is incredibly dumb both in terms of lore and since it had that in Fallout 4). It seems very backwards to me that power armor is the class cannon while regular armor with the right legendaries is the tanky build for pvp.
---
It's honestly like Bethesda just really hates power armor this time around.

Anyone know it there's a cool down period on the quest itself? That is, if I'm repeatedly getting water and ammo, is it because I'm going after it again too quickly? Or is just RNG?

Thank you!  I swear there should be support groups for people plodding along these challenges.

If I could get legendaries, I would definitely do it.

I did quite a bit of testing on Both a 1\* Furious Handmade &amp; 3\* Furious Explosive Handmade, and came up with 40% on both, after hearing from many that it was 50% I decided to test it myself. I used a Mirelurk Queen for my Test target, and tested the 3\* FE with both the Hardened and Automatic receivers, so really 3 tests.
---
I find the Furious to be well suited for use on Big Bullet Sponge enemies, but for stuff you can take out in 1-2 shots, Instigating, Anti Armor, or Two Shot is still better.
---
Don't feel bad.  In the old days, stuff like that and other helpful hints would have appeared in the game manual.  Oh, well . . .

You can hook one light box up with a single electricity line. Once you have done that you can connect that line to the other boxes. Keep in mind that you need a fusion reactor because it costs 1 electricity per box. 
---
Once all the boxes are hooked up in your own order you need to go out of building mode and stand in front of the boxes. After that a pop-up will appear on each box, allowing you to change the colour. 
---
Hope that helps!

Well it didnt keep line breaks but i think you can get it

You have to weigh the risk of accidentally dropping half of a fresh turd on the floor whilst scrambling for your controller -vs- rolling the dice on a less-nuked location.

Wait there's actual sheepsquatches in the game now??? 😮
---
They sent me an invite after I saved them so they were close by. They literally walked upto me after I killed the Scorchbeast and invited. Wasnt expecting them to be so loud. 
---
And my tse isnt duped. Got it from a friend who played the game a lot and was fortunate enough to get one and changed his build so he didnt want it anymore.

Yea I have my camp on the edge of a cliff near the Southern watch tower, and I routinely spawn inside the world map, and have to marsupial leap back into the real game from inside the map. I placed my CAMP about 50 ft from the edge, because last time I had a camp there I would spawn almost falling off to my doom.
---
Not only is it untrue, but people don't spawn in the same spot every time. I can fast travel to my camp three times and spawn in three different locations.
---
Yeah, that would be nice. I’m on PS4 so I don’t have that luxury.
---
Has anyone tried this with the magazines?
---
I want to wear the Hooded Rags so fucking bad!
---
I have to keep reminding myself that most people don't work in software companies lest I start foaming at the mouth over the "what's taking so damn long" type comments. Speaking as a 10 year veteran of the software industry, it's just plain not as simple as some people seem to think.
---
I wish BethSoft would put up some kind of a bug bounty board, so that the modding community had a more direct avenue to provide the support that Bethesda has traditionally relied on. There is a decent chance you have more direct experience with their code than the maintenance team does. Leveraging that by, say, offering $10 to fix the limbs vs legs vs arms issues, or $50 to fix the weightless calculation, would both re-engage the modding community and take some of the strain off their poor maintenance devs.
---
Happened to me last night, I killed 2 at a camp, and when I FT to whitesprings, they fell out of the sky onto the top of the resort. And then once again when I FT to my
---
own camp. It's the most benign of bugs, but still annoying
---
NP.  I'm sure it was a random.  
---
I was server hopping for Ansel.  Each time he was not in the parking lot, I went into the park, taking my frustration out on the scorched therein - and checked the lockers.
---
Was the ... 3rd... hop I think, when the hide showed up.  Bonus was the bobblehead in the adjacent locker.
---
Did 2 more before Ansel appeared, but alas, still only the one hide.
---
No. Just either heavy or electrified
---
Is budget a problem?
---
Happens to me often. I think it is the games way of letting you loot something you missed. It works on other things too. I shot a nuclear keycard cargobot last night and then went about my business. When it was eventually destroyed, the crate teleported itself to one of my workshops.
---
Breach and Clear will get you all the ore you need.
---
Im on mobile, apologies for the formatting issues
---
Usually crap like Dirty Water and Golf Tees but did get a "Dragon" for which I was truly grateful.
---
Yes, 5th.
---
Im fairly certain i did, but ill keep that in mind for next time. Thank you.
---
D'oh!  You're right.  I just pulled it up to check.  I'll change the OP :-)
---
Gotta love it
---
You already are though.  A fully modded Handmade should be well over 20lbs, compare that to most if not many other rifles that usually max out around 15, hell even a gatling gun which is a heavy weapon is only around 17lbs fully modded.  If anything if they balanced things out your handmade would lose some weight.
---
That's awesome!! I didn't know they'd added the actual sheepsquatch, I'm really excited to see one now
---
My next goal is to build a clandestine meth lab theme camp.
---
So much so lol. It's baaaad, I can't really add much. Thought about taking down the side railings but I think it adds a lot to the look. Also probably going to make my barn shorter, hardly any reason to have a big one now
---
Not really sure why so many people feel the need to lock up their camps anyway. 
---
I never lock mine as I want players who stop by to come in and have a look around and enjoy what I've built (usually a mountainside bar with stunning views!) and help themselves to any resources I've got, it's there to be used as I'm not going to sit on top of resources and farm them every moment they come back, I'd much rather people get use out of the camp and what's there.
---
Would seem a shame to lock things up.
---
Would like to see the following items:
---
*  A pile of used chems
---
* Crosses with crucified bodies, just like the ones that the Legion in FO NV used. It would also be appropriate for raiders.
---
* Grenade bouquets 
---
* Rigged baby carriages 
---
* Junk fences 
---
* Spiked poles 
---
* Cages
---
so I must be unlucky - get yellow 3 times
---
I had a difficulty reading but that's ok.
---
Great idea but the side effect is watering down the legendary loot drops even further.
---
Thought they patched the PA glitch?
---
Yeah, happens all the time. Same bug from Skyrim.
---
Hot damn, sign me up for that weirdness. I've had legendaries drop multiple legendaries before, but it was always two one stars, not the hat trick you scored.
---
I think stability could fit AFTER their road map. To a cycle of 3 seasons a year and then focus strictly on bugs and stability for the last "season". To keep the money flowing, Atom Shop items could take their time to shine with more items released in this season than prior seasons.
---
I have been noticing this as well over the last week or so.
---
Not to sound rude but it's because it's your camp. I have a few spots it spawns me in when I FT to my own camp but everyone else spawns in the same spot. I can't remember if the spawn point is exactly where I placed the camp though. This is on xb1.
---
Ah, a pvp thing, that makes sense then. I don't pvp at all.
---
Immersion requires some logic though, not just hostility for the sake of hostility.  Enemies attacking your crops makes sense, a mutt bashing it's way through every wall it comes across simply because that wall is within it's aggro range doesn't.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Lot on information there...I've read this three times trying to pull it all out.
---
I like my instigating lever probably for reasons you've hit on.  It doesn't fire as fast as handmade, but does have higher initial hit.  Beside it I carry the AA handmade (commando) for general purpose.  
---
The bloodied handmade when I'm just interested in racking up XP.  I'm not good enough with low health build to combine it with a junk run (I sometimes die frequently and grabbing loot back is a hassle.)
---
So far I've not used Tormentor (is that what you're refering to as cripple?) or Quick Hands but it sounds like you depend on these.  I'll have to consider more luck points.
---
Fun fact you can only have 254 in a stack in storage! Source: Kleptomancy!
---
I'd say stay on that server and farm the normal legendary hotspots and see if you see an increased drop rate there. That's usually what I see. Also, try doing the event again and see if you get another legendary assaultron with the same drop. I had a server that had a ghoul in the parking lot of WS that dropped 2x1star items every time it respawned and was killed.
---
this is the reason I haven't even set up a vendor yet, what's the point when i'm pretty much at max anyway.
---
I see fallout 76 subreddit is not a good place for pvp people lmao
---
It happens a lot, though. After doing a bit of testing with various people, people always spawn under my house in the same spot my teammates do, at the spot I first placed the CAMP device.
---
Why not just kill legendaries?  
---
Don’t look for the easy way.  Embrace the suck, put  in your work, and earn your gear.
---
That can't be right, I have 265 in my stash right now
---
So would it be God tier on a flamer then?
---
Other players spawn in where your FEET are during placing your camp. Has nothing to do with the camp item. That controls YOUR spawn location. Moving the camp item inside your camp will adjust only YOUR spawn point. But if someone is at your camp when you fast travel to your camp your spawn point is different. With trial and error its easy to adjust these. I have players spawn in exactly where i want them and i spawn in exactly where i want to.
---
I always keep spoiled meat and toilet paper just for this occasion. I even made a pretty big gallery from all the photos I took. I use the vault boy camera position to make it look like I am taking a real selfie.
---
Great post. Lots of fresh ideas. Only thing I might change is the prize bot idea giving you 5 tokens everytime you encounter it. You can server hop abuse this fairly easily. Other than that great stuff.
---
What happened to Little Lewisburg
---
&gt; It appears have been using the standard barrel on the 50 cal. If you're using the Powerful auto receiver on the Handmade, you should be using the Heavy Barrel on the 50cal.
---
This is what I want to emphasize and I hope it will answer some of your questions. To me, this is "forest from the trees" theorycrafting.
---
In the entire context of the thread (summary: get heavies at lower levels with more accessible ammo, stabilized outside of PA, lack of mods) is a review of the heavy weapon mechanics with little consideration to additional mechanics. I'm inferring (could be wrong) that you're suggesting I may have fudged the data a little by omitting barrel mods, etc, and the mechanic of PA itself. I felt that was more reasonable and also omitted things like Rifleman - a rifleman would generally always have their 9 to 12 points in Perception while a Heavy Gunner may have to drop some damage for a STR cap where most of PER is passive skills. We also don't have a realistic way to simulate semi-auto with this chart vs automatic - which is exactly why I selected Powerful Automatic in my samples (compare the Gauss rifle, for example... not sure we would call that "real world" comparison and declare **Rifles the highest DPS in the game**).
---
The reasoning behind that was to better reflect more of the mechanics and accessibility. **It would take you an afternoon to get a new character to a Hunting Rifle with most of the mods unlocked**. Might take a couple of afternoons to get a handmade with hardened receiver and perforating magazine. A minigun with accelerated barrels? You're not picking it up that way and especially not at level 35(!). Also, tbh, last I compared Minigun barrels the Tri barrels beat Accelerated, but that was before the overall fire-rate reduction across the board. Tank Killer has 0 cost - Stabilized has a material cost in at least fusion cells. **We don't even get armor piercing magazines for heavies ("free", no equipment or perk requirements, only one-time material costs)**.
---
The DPS chart doesn't have anything consideration for head shots, Concentrated Fire, etc. A headshot with Concentrated Fire from a hunting rifle will beat quite a lot. That user has additional opportunities: drop 3 points in Blocker, Serendipity, etc that all work _outside_ of PA and are far, far more efficient than Bullet Shield. 60 DR at max level isn't worth level 1 of Blocker and even Emergency Protocols can't beat damage _avoidance_.
---
In the same way that we're naively omitting that mechanic of a "good" Rifleman build I think it would be fair to omit the mechanics of a "good" Heavy build. "Good" indicating a min/max scenario where we've decided that the Heavy Weapons user is kitted out full Bloodied, Adrenal, Emergency Protocols, etc, etc and comparing with a Rifleman loaded out with Serendipity in Sentinel armor.... there's no comparison. Rifleman wins.
---
I would also invite you to try to cripple something. Tormentor and Enforcer, for whatever reason in-game, work infinitely better than a 5mm with Accelerated Barrels _with_ One Gun Army even though you would think the higher RPM would beat out the lower RPM equivalents on chance... to be quite honest, I don't even think One Gun Army works.
---
**The trade off for 17 DPS is not at all overly desirable in the game**.
---
153 **Minigun, Accelerated, Stabilized**
---
144 **.50 Cal, Heavy Barrel, Stabilized**
---
138 **Handmade, Powerful Auto, Perforating Magazine, Tank Killer**
---
123 **Minigun, Accelerated, Without Stabilized**
---
120 **10mm SMG, Hardened, AP Mag, Tank Killer**
---
119 **.50 Cal, Standard Barrel, Stabilized**
---
117 **Handmade, Powerful Auto, Perforating Magazine, Without Tank Killer**
---
117 **Combat Rifle, Powerful Automatic, Tank Killer**
---
116 **.50 Cal, Heavy Barrel, without Stabilized**
---
101 **Gatling, Speedy Receiver, Stabilized**
---
You can click through various other weapons. I think you'll find out quickly that, according to your own source, the weapon class with the highest DPS is not Heavy Guns at all but Rifles that have "free" Tank Killer, Concentrated Fire, headshot bonuses _and get to keep all of their legendary armor effects_ **and** are accessible at much lower levels. **With in game experience**, topics like cripples are obviously worth trading 17 DPS to _keep those effects and be able to cripple something_.
---
All of these are the reasons I agree with OP.
---
&gt; Aside 2; I suspect this calc has some errors and such. I honestly expected the Speedy Gatling Gun to lose in DPS vs the Hard/Perf Handmade. In addition, i played around with it some more. It's missing like half of the hunting rifle receivers lol.
---
Right. It's a really cool tool, but missing a few pieces. We're also excluding "Bethesda magic" in some of the calculations as on-paper DR doesn't always match what you see in game especially when it comes to things like explosive, TS, etc.... I wish they would just give us the actual "raw" damage calculations and take the guess work out of this...
---
Favorite line for me: "If i catch myself a bucket head ill tear his legs clean off". As im sneaking behind him :)
---
Will see you soon!
---
I've gotten two legendry drops from the same ghoul at Whitesprings. So multiple drops is possible, but hot dam that's luck. I'd keep looking around and see if it happens again.
---
Turn it off, go to sleep, like every your life then check back in 12 hours, that always works for me anyway
---
I had it happen for the first time last week. FT to Watoga station and had a regular scorchbeast and the scorchbeast queen drop right on top of me. I had already looted both bodies so there was nothing on either of them. Thought it was hilarious and took pics.
---
PA needs more robust MODs as well.
---
Same for me. Before I ever played a Fallout game, looked up playable races, cause I wanted to be a Ghoul. Thought it was lame I could only be human til I actually played. Always had a soft spot for beastmen and weirdos in games.
---
The one thing I'm sad about the railway rifle in 76 is I hear you can't nail a limb to the wall behind your target on a critical hit.  😕
---
I'm not sure if it's related, but this happens on Adventure, too. I think it's a glitch with the program where it just turns off a server, and everyone else has left but somehow you're still there. I've had a few Adventure servers like this, and honestly I love it. I can do whatever I want, without worrying about anyone taking all the WS legendaries, or my loot bag if I die. I think it'd be even better on the Survival server, what with the extra exp. 
---
I don't know about the rest of your post though, as I don't do the Survival, pvp stuff.
---
Vendor camps made me ashamed of it, and also I couldn't get the rug exploit to work on that land because it wasn't flat enough so I couldn't make the roof garden I wanted there. Thanks for asking, maaaaan. Are you digging the new update lately?
---
If you're talking to other pvp people I'm sure it's fine. I just don't, and you guys do  things differently, so for me locking a door is pointless, but it helps you so go for it.
---
Thanks, that would be great. Going out with the family to eat, but once I get back I'll add you.
---
Since my dumb little moms can undersnt big paragraphs can someone summarize how you get more tokens or where this quest is?
---
I have alot also. I keep 3 on me at any one time. My reactive xo1 for radiated zones, my jumpjet t51b for though time you just don't feel like going around, and a xecavator to fast travel.  But I also keep a camo and emergency protocols t51b for certain events. Since it's just lighter to have full sets.
---
Disease cures. I keep getting Rad Worms at WS. 
---
I also like addictol, since I’ll pop chems for longer fights.
---
ya the Super mutants  are just that.. Super :)
---
This thread is just packed with "feelings" about them, B made these guys come alive.
---
I have not, but I’ve been planning on trying to soon.
---
Never had that happen, but some time ago I had an empty government supply crate follow me all the way from The Mire to The Forest. Whenever I'd get far enough away it'd just reappear out of thin air in whatever direction I was heading.
---
best way
---
They need to make it so we can combine camps with friends
---
Does L3 sort currently?
---
Think he dropped his whole head.
---
I'd love if vetted modders could sign-up to see their code in workflow before it hits a patch. I imagine many new bugs could be caught if they leveraged the community more directly for QA.
---
Same, I see its unsafe staircase and no structure and I'm like now way am I stepping foot on that deathtrap.
---
Could you craft me a level 50 fixer? I’d really appreciate it if I could have it when I’m level 50. My gamer tag is: cosmos_star7
---
they should remove the legacy weapons before they lift the bans...
---
Good point. I’ll have to adjust my ‘donation route’.
---
It seems this happens when they are planning on taking the server down for maintenance. When it's happened to me in adventure, none of my friends were able to join my game. It didn't even show me as online in their friends list. Enjoy it while you have it.
---
also..
---
lol dupers...
---
Why in the world is it so big? (That’s what she said)
---
That would be so awesome. I think workshops *could* kinda fill that niche but they're pvp zones so you wouldn't be necessarily inviting chill company. Someone who is hardcore PvP sees four people at a workshop... Probably turn into a Rambo situation. *They drew first blood, not me*
---
I think there's a bug with items stacking. I have 6 .38 rounds that won't combine with my stash.
---
&gt; I think stability could fit AFTER their road map
---
Really.. and have players leaving. for 3 quarters of the year. There would be no players to see the fixes.. My point was I confessed that I love the game but pushed the keyboard away because I was so peed that I could not take it any more ... and left.. what about the people that are not vested?? they would not last that long..
---
I just can't see how your idea would work.
---
I can I will send you a friend request later tonight
---
That would be awesome.
---
I’ve already given my gamer tag name above. Send me a friend request and I’ll answer ASAP.
---
The best way now is to team up with a higher level.  Then you do white spring runs.  As long as you hit the monster, you get 100% of the xp.  At level 23, get a handmade rifle  with scope.  If you are in PC, Here is my ign. RancorRich.  My friend Haegong and myself are helping a few people level up.  Your welcome to come and join in.  We usually are on for a few hours on friday and saturday nights for 9pm until 2am est.  This will give you a nice boost.  
---
If white springs is not a good fit at this time, do the main line quests and hit the up the mothman town or the upper left sector of the map.  Their is a lumber yard full of low level super mutants that carry 308 ammo.  If you go there, use a hunting rifle.  You will never need to leave and get more ammo.
---
A lot of people have been updated. I personally haven't, but I've made sure to stay in contact with support and my ticket is still open/verified, so I assume they're doing it in batches. They were accepting the replacement ticket up until May. So I think some of us might be waiting until Fall sometime.
---
This kid never had a tree house.
---
I've been over stocked with cores they weigh to much, Just grab one of the power plants usually thunder or mongah no one ever takes them you get so many full cores and just build a fusion to power it.
---
Placing blue prints is awful. Anything more than a 1x1 is almost guaranteed not to place. You're probably better off rebuilding, unless someone here knows something I don't.
---
Delete this ish
---
I said when they released the backpack and made it only work out of PA they are creating an issue where not many people will want to use power armor. Factor in no legendary armor effects, no back pack, no fusion core requirements and it becomes very tempting to only use non PA armor. This is also a Bethesda problem because if you have less power armor users then who is gonna be interested in buying a skin for a power armor they don't / won't use.
---
Legendary effects on power armor or an item similar to the backpack on power armor could help level them out.
---
https://youtu.be/x_m4hhig1fw
---
I used this video to find the locations and a tourist eventually spawned at one of the places.
---
Awesome, I'm down for that. I'm DM you.
---
Haha it's my first camp ever built I have my work benches at the bottom and two generators at the top etc
---
Yeah I have rebuilt but those blueprints didn't save just individual pieces
---
It needs to be closed, doesn't it? I can't remember... I just know I server hopped  dozen times before I found one I could collect.
---
if you are on pc i'll make you 1 or 2 i carry an auto .38 fixer and love it great for low level areas i'll be on in about 20 minutes mattola69
---
The plan has already been advertised. If they side line the plan, that'll turn off others as well. If you're going to put them in a no win situation, then that's just being mean.
---
It's not like they completely ignore bugs as well.
---
My plan would just be a reflection of what is occuring now.
---
- S0 The vanilla game (strictly bug fixes) S0
---
- S1 Wild Appalachia
---
- S2 Nuclear Winter
---
- S3 Wastelanders
---
then reset with no S4 but year 2 Season 0
---
This is the greatest suggestion for this game I’ve ever heard
---
I know it's Bethesda's fault at the end of the day. But those floating houses kill me. I just move past them, you haven't earned my potential vending caps!
---
I grabbed a bunch of closed ones but no swamp plant
---
I got "You have a face only a mother could love... but your whole family died in the Great War Ha, Ha, Ha."
---
Me in tears: **nice**
---
Is it really twenty foundations long by twenty foundations wide? That sounds like more than you can even build. My camp is 5x3 and I have trouble placing it anywhere. Seems I always have to rebuild it.
---
It is ridiculous that PA is so weak/under powered in FO76. The only reasons to even use it are for slight protection from the environment, and or carry weight. That's only after considerable investments in perk points, and caps for plans/mods. Otherwise it's more of a hindrance than anything else. Unless you just like the way it looks. A re-balance is necessary. PA users are already penalized with the traditional lack of mobility, stealth, speed, the ability to craft in a hurry etc. But now they are somehow weaker than a naked guy with knives glued to his glove? C'mon!
---
The Division 2 learnt a lot from the flailing start that was the Division, so honestly it doesn't work as a good example.
---
Despite its numbers on the pip boy being only slightly higher than normal armor, that’s not the case in practical use.  Wearing power armor and taking hits from super mutants you’ll notice there’s some huge... huge hidden damage mitigation vs not being in power armor.  I can’t speak for PvP, because I don’t PvP.  For PVE Power Armor is extremely powerful for certain builds like Heavy Gunner.  If it was given legendary properties it would have to be minimal in scope like the already datamined no Durability loss, or maybe even 0 radiation taken.
---
I presume because people would sell and trade them and how that may impact upon the game economy. I'm not sure what it may have done but that and you would very quickly find your stash getting filled especially in the early days when it was half the capacity it is now.
---
Then again, I would like to be able to swap between a jet pack and my servos in my power armour torso rather than scrap my jet pack and loose all that flux. Sure, I could get another torso but that's still a pain.
---
I agree on the spawn point checking, but spawns do  seem to vary to some degree. My primary spawn point is in the grass just outside my back door. If the player moves before the camp loads in they end up just inside the first foundation.  I fixed that by putting a cooking bench outside so they can use it to get free.  Sometimes though players spawn on the totally opposite side of my camp. The area I spawn to is 100 percent of the timefar outside of the build zone.
---
That is probably a factor too. I have noticed that people do ask occasionally if I'm new, which confused me at first given I don't see much benefit to starting fresh outside new builds and bordom.
---
Welcome to MMOs where devs create artificial scarcity to moderate the game's economy.
---
I don't watch Game of Thrones, but you've got my vote.
---
They don't even need to truly have an app for this.. Send an escalated ticket to a middle man support developer. That developer would get tired of the same thing over and over and either write a simple fix it script or a simple console app to do the redundant task.  maybe his script gets more mature and it becomes something that a support tech could run.
---
Or.. 
---
Talks to his buddy on the project and say.. "Really man when you going to fix this one item...I'm spending x hours with this same thing over and over."
---
^--- this is how the real dev studios work.
---
That seems high, but if you find one cheaper, see my comment below. Buy it, re-sell it at a bot vendor, then buy it back immediately from them. I got a wing out of a player vending machine for 125, paid an extra ~40 at the bot to rebuy, and it completed that quest item.
---
Deathclaw hides can be found in the same green footlocker container as the fallout 4 deathclaw hides. they cannot be found on deathclaws,guano piles or meat bags. it is a "rare" junk item like the rare bloodbug blood sac and presumably the stingwing ichor sac. these items can be found by manually searching junk piles,green footlockers,wooden crates,metal boxes and suitcases. gulpers as their names suggest like to gulp up junk so your best bet is to kill them or find a camp ground with footlockers like dolly sods.
---
Yeah it was my first ever camp I thought at first you had to cover the green circle so I started off on the edge and I had it in the bottom right corner of the map
---
Yea you can get it as a really rare drop. But the one at garrahan mining switches to normal after you pick it up for some reason.
---
Insult Bot found me in a nuked zone fighting super mutants...can’t remember what he said,  (mostly because I couldn’t hear him as I was crouching/hiding from the minigun) but it did end with “R.I.P”. 
---
All I could think was “not now Insult Bot” and mild annoyance that he apparently wanted me dead.
---
I didnt think that sounded rude, you're good 👍. Hmmm strange. I'll have to pay more attention when people start spawning into my camp and see if it's always in the same spot. I've seen some people spawn into a certain spot but I wonder if it's everybody.
---
I'd like to see this happen. So many friends gone from the game who might actually come back and play with me!
---
Also... Let me know this secret.
---
Beer bottles, they are everywhere and dont get scraped when you scrap all your junk so you can collect them as free caps basically. Its not much but it adds up.
---
Just out of interest...
---
Are you on PS4 and was the camp near whitesprings?
---
Kind of unnecessary and not a great reward
---
Thank you kindly!
---
Ah okay. As far as i can tell there was nothing to loot - but that would make sense overall. Thx!
---
Server hop.
---
Good to know man 👍
---
ok thanks  
---
I  plan for 11 perception with  level 3 master and expert rifleman 
---
then level 3 tank killer and level 2 long shot
---
Not sure if this is the right place to mention:
---
The Polished mod for Metal armor seems uncraftable. I'm certain I've unlocked it by scrapping, but it's unable to be crafted, and I consistently get nothing for scrapping Metal armor now (as if I've unlocked all the mods).
---
Paying to randomly reroll a legend effect would be a great cap sink. Of course you would be able to pick what ones wouldn't change but still thats a good idea
---
Two identical TSE handmades, eh?
---
If you build it.. They will come... To lock.... Or to unlock... Only YOU decide in this open world online experience we call Fallout 76. *Experiences may vary*
---
Again... that's ridiculous.
---
I currently have the charging barrel on it, but I have the charging shotgun mod ability.  When I hover over it on the edit screen (before you actually click to mod) the damage actually goes down with the shotgun mod. In addition the shotgun perk cards dont seem to have any effect. Does anyone know if that is a glitch and just doesn't update the damge shown accurately or is the shotgun mod actually weaker than the charging mod?
---
You have missed out on a lot of the map then.
---
Point taken

Did the same first as they landed straight on my garage shop... Made a few nice snaps. But ya know - it's a little bit embarrassing if you visit a camp and they keep dropping all over the place lol
---
Bookmarking this.  Will you promise to put your *whole* foot in your mouth when the Atom shop updates?
---
How much do you like to pay for antibiotics? Just added a stack to my vendor and wasn't sure what to price them at.
---
I hear you. sometimes I roam around vault 76 just to get some gun play in. the heaviest hitter I have is a silenced gauss and 2\* two shot pump. they need to empty the "mag" put anything interesting down. I had a 1\* plasma gatlin, but after a weekend of trying to put it to use in a nuke zone, I traded it for scrip.
---
early on I was basically a sniper build, but at this point I dont know that I can get back to that  unless I get a god level legendary. for now I have my melee perks and a stack of legendary pointy objects.

If you still have your Faschnacht goodies, put those up in a player vendor for a few grad each for the plans and a couple hundred each and you’ll make a bunch really quick.
---
I don't pay for them lol
---
I dont use power armor :(
---
This is awesome, OP. If I had gold I’d give it.
---
It sounds like they wanted you to wait 6 months so you couldnt dispute the charge off your Credit card or Debit card.
---
I've put so much worse in my mouth then a foot.
---
I run a PA heavy bloodied build. Was lucky many months ago and bought a BE gatling laser. On my first PP event I was alone when the alpha spawned. I melted it so fast, I had to stop, so the others would run back and get their hits. It was almost dead in literally under 10s, including the 50% hp regen. BE guns are crazy good. A BE minigun or .50 cal would drop it dead even faster.
---
Anyway... I have a few miniguns to play. A FE, AAE, AAFFR and AAAD. Somehow the FE one was faring the worst... It took always the longest to kill stuff and used most bullets. The AAAD is most efficient in killing stuff as far as I see. Traded the FE minigun for a BE handmade for my other toon. I think there's something wrong happening when furious is paired with explosive. Any chance you can test a FE weapon and see whether it works OK?
---
Thanks for the help dude lol.
---
Never thought of that. I tried to drop items and pick them back up (which didn't work) but that's good info
---
Thanks.  That helps narrow where to look.
---
I think I'd put on the unyielding gear that you have, and go find a left leg. (And put on the Brotherhood underarmor).  It's worth remembering that bloodied builds don't have to run around with 19% health. You can spend most of your time at 100%, and do plenty of damage with any unarmed weapon. The same perks that keep you mostly alive at 19% health in an SBQ battle, will make you very tough at 100% health. Then, if you want to go glass cannon, just wait to start getting hurt, or go hang out in an irradiated area until you reach your desired level of awesomeness. It's pretty fun to sit in a pile of rad barrels, with your special stats open, watching your strength climb up over 30.
---
Sounds cool
---
Ok, then your best bet is to just scrap it and rebuild. You can store all the pieces and then just place them in a new location. The smaller your foundation, the more versatile and easier it is to place.
---
Bloody mess 3 is a must for every build if its about dmg
---
Its because gulpers drop any random junk, and that is a piece of junk, same as junk piles at extracter spots
---
Aw no. That sucks lol
---
Uhhhh great movie! Didn't expect that coming lol
---
Yes, still bugged.
---
Thanks, that seems to be the consensus.  So looks like I'll be dropping my demo expert perk.
---
  I have enjoyed the game since launch.  Never really had any issues other than the houses disappearing due to placement, and storage space too small.  Which were improved with patches.  
---
  There were a lot of people that jumped on board with the hate train who never had any intention of playing it to begin with.  It's fun to bash things people love apparently?
---
  The bag ordeal and accidental doxing that followed we're pretty unexcusable.  However I get a lot of enjoyment out of Bethesda games and will continue to be a customer.
---
Ziiiiiing
---
what difference does it really make?
---
I actually craft or pharma farm and sell them and use disease cure.
---
thats disingenuous
---
Not Dupes, just the same perks &amp; Stats, I've gotten 4 so far and 2 of them came from the uranium Fever Event, 1 was level 35 all others are 45.
---
Right so my question would be what do you price them at?
---
Good as explosive is, I'd take the +50% crit, if you're going to be using pistols to crit almost all the time. Doesn't have the cool explosive effect though. Sacrifices must be made.
---
Tough to find a space that open...maybe try the big farmer's fields south of the vault or better yet maybe south of Morgantown? I think there's a farm there that might have a field big enough.
---
It's that or perhaps on the edge of one of the holes of the golf course south east of Morgantown (I forget the name...the one with the Gourmands) - might find a flat enough space on one of the fairways.
---
Needs to be a broken deluxe camera. Ive actually found one in the wild which i thought was impossible
---
Swing speed.
---
Well that should be the idea of mindless aggressive mutants, and there's an hidden defense point indicator which deters enemies, but you're right. Moreover prioritizing defenses makes sense, attacking crops also, but only the most intelligent enemies should attack first the generators (if some defense is powered by them). The aggro mechanism is rudimental, but I can wait for it if they are working to new content.
---
 I think 22-25 caps. I'm at work and don't remember for sure.
---
There’s absolutely no need. I literally get 8-10 legendary drops in 30-40 minutes of play time. That’s plenty. They’re supposed to be harder to get for a reason and it keeps ppl playing.
---
No worries, still at work here myself.
---
I'm down. This game needs to be chock full of evens and quests, and this sounds as good as any.
---
Sounds fair, thank you!
---
I've had it do this when I was at max build limit. When Player Vending first came out, It wouldn't even let me list things in the Machine at like 95% build size. Recently I finished decorating my camp etc and everything was delisted from my machines. So I scrapped some crops and relisted everything and it seems to have fixed that. Just stay around 95% build size til they fix that
---
Have you tried switching servers?
---
In the middle of the map in the dry lake bed near new gad. Lots of open space.
---
Thank you so much I just hopped on
---
I just got on. Please let me know when you’re ready!
---
That's how my FE minigun felt. The AoE from explosions seemed to have been resetting the bonus in every shot.
---
10mm smg can't be suppressed though, sadly
---
watch out we got a tough guy teenager over here
---
.50 is great mostly because you don't have to grind forever to get a decent amount of shots. With a good prefix (Instigating, say) and the right build, it'll do solid enough for anything you shouldn't have a lever action or other, faster rate weapon for.
---
&gt;WOW! I can complete all 5 challenges today!
---
I think it does, although some atom shop related items tend to not count for certain challenges (challenges are screwy with what they will and will not count). I think the new years suits count as well as formal wear.
---
If you build around a tree I have no problem with it. Most people do not build these monstrosities around trees.
---
If you want something close to the BOS combat armor protection with more radiation resistance go with marine.
---
I won’t be on for awhile dude.    I’m at work.  If your still on later tonight I’ll help you out
---
They are all stacked
---
I didnt lose mine but sold to a vendor very early on after completing the M.O.M. questline, not realizing that I'd never get back into the basement without it and there's no way to get another one without repeating with an alt.  Wish there was a way to get one back, like crafting if you completed the questline without being able to p2p it, like atom shop skins.
---
Add me if you want though A_Small_Sedan
---
um, are you REALLY saying FO76's servers are stable????????
---
Ive been playing every day for 5 months now, but im not fucking blind to reality
---
Quak season.
---
And add a 3 day no bag limit to board and feral dogs
---
Finally ran into one, a lv 80 noxious Sheepsquatch over by twin lakes/Solomon pond area. One of the more intense solo fights I have had in this game.
---
Glad other people get it too.
---
Bethesda’s primary focus is to maintain sales in the atom shop and to continue making content to pull more and more people in this game to make more revenue. I get it they’re are a business and it’s about money. But, it wasn’t always like *this*.
---
 It’s just a lot like your favorite band, in my head. Some of those older games had it ingrained into every fabric – they LOVED what they were working on and they were PROUD of it. They were hungry to prove themselves and obtain a reputation. Just as Todd said, this is something else. I think they want on that WoW train if you ask me. 
---
Sure. They’ll lose (some of) their core fans eventually but they’ll get more than they had before, if it works out. 
---
Call me old but I just miss the good ole days. Just playing Fallout 3 ad 2 in the morning. All I had was whatever came in that games case until the next DLC came out. 
---
I get this is more dynamic and there are more possibilities. But, part of me just prefers it simple. Not this constant money grab with this whole pretend attitude of for the fans. A lot of people don’t see things like that and that’s totally fine. 
---
But, if this is what we are doing now, for the love of God, don’t break someone’s gun when they give you ANOTHER 6 dollars of their hard-earned money. 
---

---
**Offer not valid outside Appalachia.
---
At least it should have more ammo!!
---
Thanks for another roundup, Aten\_Ra! As always, we're taking a look.
---
&gt;I can 1-shot most non-bosses with my instigating gauss, including major gutsys.
---
With same weapon I can do that with Col. gutsys,  if I have Covert Ops lvl 3 that yields the 2.5x (or is it 3.x?) damage if in sneak mode.
---
There's also r/fallut76settlements for camps specific to fo76
---
What weight perks were you using?
---
So for each target you mean specific body part? That makes sense. I wish it was just for each enemy and not body part tho.
---
Truly the evil genius of our time.
---
Thats what I was thinking, especially since the explosive is only 20% of base damage (which is low for most pistols). Guess I just needed a 2nd opinion. Thank you!
---
Can I lead line all CA parts?
---
You could add falllout 76 to steam as a non-steam game, and then you can play it on any android device via the steam link app. 
---
I'm sure you can play it on the same network as the pc...  unsure if you can play on a separate network via the steam link app.
---
I would definitly be interested in joining this group. I already help low level players by protecting there workshops from server hoping pvp player who server hop to kill low level players who own workshops.
---
although its annoying, please know that most players of fallout are probably within 20-40 age range, so them having kids seems natural, and ofcourse when they make dinner or go out or want to distract their kids they use any trick they can, even "here kids you can play on my game for a while."
---
All of them
---
I don't kill it for them, jackass. I usually watch while invisible and jump in when things get overwhelming or they are downed. I revive them and then help kill whatever killed them. The loot I drop if any is stimpacks and ammo, never legendaries.
---
I'm all for adding some level of difficulty to PVE but I'm not sure at this stage of the game it's possible. We can certainly hope for it.
---
I'm level 79 and am having trouble.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/10826/
---
Ah I see. Honestly I don’t have any tips for moving a base. I always try and it never works like I want it to so I end up starting new every time I move. Keeps it fresh
---
I don't think it's yellow, it's just white and covered in shit really
---
If you completed it over lvl 50 the rewards would be better
---
Thanks! Appreciate you giving us a look! Thanks for visiting
---
Yes, yes it did. Last night my friend and I sat in silo alpha for 15 minutes waiting for the game to catch up and process that we fixed the reactor. And then the game said we failed so we had walked out
---
I think they changed pvp a while back so you can't one shot, most is bring them low HP on first hit. Which made all the slow firing high damage weapons useless and hence everyone uses auto.
---
sure add,pm me your acc name.(friends)
---
we can add each other and do it sometime! :)
---
Online alot but not always in fallout just reply when ur ready i guess.
---
Can work something out easily.
---
I also still need the challenge.
---
Ok cool i will
---
r/woosh
---
You’ll never get that down again....sorry , but at that size it always going toi hit something.
---
I've experienced some weird lag lately as well as severs going down.  Also get a crash once in a blue moon.  Non of the other stuff your listing though.  Sounds awful.
---
Just each enemy, not body part. That'd honestly make it kind of useless (well unless your aim is a lot better than mine lol)
---
I think the top of the lighthouse is a guarenteed spawn
---
But scorhbeast queen.
---
It would work better on melee weapons I think
---
That's a good question. Explosive weapons? shotguns? tesla rifle? anything multitarget potentially gets reset constantly. I'll test when I find one :)
---
&gt; Level 80 scorchbeasts go down in less than 2 clips
---
Here's a great recipe that does that in about \~45 (or less) shots.
---
1 Max level TS Gatling gun (Long barrel, comfort grip, Std Sight, large Mag, !PRIME receiver!)
---
Ultracite 5 mm ammo
---
Stabilized card (in PA)
---
Tank Killer 3
---
Heavy Gunner Trio all at Lvl 3 (Gunner/Expert/Master)
---
this gives me about 235 per shot damage.
---
Prime receiver
---
Pretty sure thats still bugged...
---
I picked both and no luck.
---
I think it only counts if your doing the quest for them.
---
whats your ign? i want to try this maze hopfully your on pc
---
Floopwood, population 1.
---
I saw someone who did this the other day and took a pic cause I thought that was crafty 😊
---
I don’t know. Someone disagrees as we’re getting downvoted. I guess we’ll see if they actually have an opinion or just don’t like ours.
---
They need to have it work similar to the enclave and BOS security fields where they simply "unlock" after certain conditions are met
---
There’s some talk of that crit not stacking with eagle eye and the better crits perk.  On the plus side that effect would free you up of a perk card if that is the case.  It’s the one I’ve been shooting for lately, so I can pick up 4 leaf clover instead.
---
I had something along these lines the other night.
---
"Hey look...a vault dweller.  You're saving humanity.....one more nuke should do it."
---
I'm torn. I just need like 1 more for the challenge. But I could probably make bank if I sell the next one I find.
---
Its such a fun bug....
---
It happens to me only if I died fighting the SBQ....
---
Then its rainin SB.
---
I think it does I remember a huge difference between gta story and online graphically. Draw distance, shadows were all lower online.
---
Nah, 76 looks much better outdoors and about the same inside.
---
I actually used to live in Lewisburg and they have a sign you can build next to that says: "Welcome to Lewisburg, the coolest small town, USA!" and I would always add letters to make it say "Welcome to Little Lewisburg, the coolest small town, USA. Population: 1"
---
Why does the destruction of the mod not at least give you the resources of scrapping the mod?
---
I bought a tonne of scout armour mods to see what they all were.  scrapped 20 of them to get the 40 Ballistic Fibre that it suggested i should ...... and got nothing.
---
This lack of care and attention to details is what is killing this game.  In comparison with other big open world games, this game is by far the least detail oriented.  And it hurts more than just Bethesda’s reputation..... its destroying it.
---
Not exactly armor and not sure it’s a bug but:
---
The Tattered Rags outfit cannot be worn over armor and has no armor rating itself. Which is sad because I really like the aesthetic.
---
Your pity timer has expired heres a 1* wood armor for you. :)
---
I had all of those for sale with explosive rounds
---
Both can be good.  Explosive works on every shot and you can take demolitions expert to increase the damage plus make your grenades better.  
---
Crits can be great especially with high luck and/or supporting perks to proc it more frequently.
---
Concentrated fire doesn't increase damage, it increases VATS hit chance each consecutive hit up to 95%
---
eg. With rank 3, your vats chance might go 55% 75% 95%
---
It has no effect at all on damage numbers. Still a great perk though, arguably a must-have for vats heavy builds
---
To keep those mods from being sold, traded... within a few hours of game launch, everyone could feasibly have every mod ever.
---
Not even close.  Play FO4 again.  Especially character detail.
---
how so
---
I've been carry around a spare chassis to put T-51 parts on when I'm on long grinds. 
---
At my camp I drop the completed set in a corner of my garage.  It's there for anyone to take and looks awesome just chilling in my man-cave.  So far not a single person has claimed it.
---
I simply pick it up before I log off and place it again when log back in.
---
It wouldn't be a big deal if someone took it.  I've just been piecing it together as I find parts. I'm thinking about putting on the Nuka paint to see how long it lasts.
---
Ok weirdly enough RIGHT after you said this I ran in to a level 50 legendary sheepsquatch!!
---
I don't know that fo4 looks better in general but mods can go a long way :)
---
 that's what I was thinking
---
I guess 99% of the Fallout community does NOT go by this video... 100-150 caps for combat armor? 50-200 caps for 3* weapons based on scrip value? 
---
Sorry but this seems crazy and I have never seen any deals whatsoever like he's described.
---
Thanks for passing on these bug reports.
---
Then we’d love to have you! DM me and I’ll send you a link!
---
76 scenery, cityscapes and landscapes have a cartoony look to them, where previous FOs look more realistic.
---
Everythings in caps and /s
---
Id agree with the crit suggestion, ive had ME and now rock a VE 10mm pistol. Unless your looking at a western, single action or now a pipe revoler avoid explosive imo.
---
Linus' Law: "With enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"
---
I play a ton of survival mode and the way the top 3 works is great actually.
---
It’s based on a “survival score” that calculates on many different factors including, time alive, enemies (creatures killed), players killed, etc.
---
When the mode first came to beta we have it based on longest time alive, and that was exploited as guys would literally sit in a base that was indestructible to gain top placement.
---
Second update was kills only, and that was ok, but you really seen a major ramp up on train station spawn camping.
---
This current iteration is good, it doesn’t reward guys with spawn camp with much at all as they just kill the same guys over, and over.
---
What needs to be changed ASAP is player camps in survival being destroyable, it’s killed the servers imho.
---
power user 1 star is plenty
---
 Way better is probably a little bit too much and of course Mods make it look better but just the detail the character and enemies.
---
Compared to letting end game players bully every one else because they are bored, not really. 
---
The mitigating factor would be to establish a hard cap on workshops owned.
---
RCInvictusX on XBox, I welcome any and all combat and never leave salty messages. I'm guessing by the arrogant tone of your message that win or lose, I'll be on the receiving end of much salt. ;)
---
p.s. Yes all PVPers are l33t dupers and I've made $149,097,343 dollars so far. Excuse me now, I feel the need to peruse yachts.
---
Sure thing! Sorry to bother.
---
My suggestion wouldn't change the amount of drops.  It would change the diversity of drops, insuring you get a wider variety of items.
---
Seriously, id love to build better structures, if it werent for the finicky as placement ruining any chance of actually moving the camp. Esp when a server jump disappears it. ( i havent played in while though, anyone tell me if its gotten better? Lol)
---
I can help you out for free just give me a sec to add you
---
Another added bonus to using .50 ammo is how much ammo you gain when you craft.   With max ammosmith I believe you get 180 rounds for a single craft.
---
Fupawood
---
Power Armour or a Hazmat suit are needed for nuke zones, and when you hear a nuke warning always check the map to see where it's going to land :)
---
Exactly my thoughts.  And the colors
---
im aware that you've done that, how does that make what you've written not disingenuous
---
I thought it was only me -\_-
---
I'm just a one star Bloodied having scrub. One day I hope to upgrade to a swing speed or power attack version.
---
Well...I dont think words do it justice. At least not words by this poetaster. 
---
I am going to make a couple new post with pictures and a video walkthrough of my pirate ship, "The Scallywag" and my current build (the strip club. 
---
I will send you a link and you will have your answer. 
---
Now I'm off to figure out how to upload a video to my Google machine
---
It's 2.5x. Same. I get the names mixed up. Whatever the toughest gutsys are. Silos are easy if I can keep my sneak. The only thing I can't one shot are Sentrys (close), scorchbeasts, and sheepsquatch. For some of the tougher stuff like high level deathclaws, fog crawlers, hermit crabs, and most legendaries, I have to hit the most vulnerable body part in sneak with a vats crit to get the one shot. So it's not always reliable. Or if I'm too far away it doesn't work either.
---
Very bright.... like a cartoon :)
---
\&gt; If I'm looking for waste acid (which I am, always) then I like to be able to know I'm at 
---
\&gt; the right machine. 
---
If you are on PS4, stop by - I have acid in my machines.
---
I'm built on a power transmission tower just south of monongah, where the road forks to go to bolton greens.  
---
I know some one else has a camp at the same spot, so depends on what server which one of us you'll get.  Mine has a bronze lion at the top of the staircase.
---
go upstairs - Acid is in the machine on the right
---
You can modify bitnforbyourself. But visitors will always spawn where the camp machine is originally placed. This has been tested over and over again on PC my me and the group I play with. If you are on c I will be happy to show you by moving my merchants camp placing the box and placing the camp buildings. Have you fast travel to it and then I'll move the box to your designate area and facing. Inside the area and you can try to your heats content. Just to prove the point.
---
Also. I'm one of those that havey mechant @ WS. But not built right at the station. I have found anywhere along the tracks from the rail yard north to the flower in the south. People will come to you camp.
---
Course building @WS had a downside. And those are players that can't aim nukes. I am not sure if they think they are being funny, or want their friends base to pop in where mine is, or just being ahats. I've had my base @WS. Since vendors were released. And before vendors only got 1 nuke on me. After vendors I've had over 20. Now some I can understand as the person dropping the nuke didn't want to hit his/party members base. But when your base is next to the vault. And you nuke WS and MISS THE GOLDCLUB just to hit BWM, or you center it in the hills so that WSS is on the left side of the zone. Your just being childish.but to each their own I guess. 2in warning is plenty of time for me to log my mechant out. And then back in after the nuke lands. (He wears a lvl1 prototype hasmat suit. And has plenty of radx/rad remove. So it's not an issue for me to still make money in a nuke zone.and I love making bank of radx/remove ina nuke zone. My main can make over 200 each and then dilute 100 and pop them in the machines for those that are under repaired. Last night netted me over 15k in just med sales or radx/remove and stimpacks
---
There are called "reverse vaults".
---
Yeah, I didn't know it was bugged and tried them all the other night and it didn't work.
---
Also if you go to the east side of the ash heap, there's a quest to get excavator power Armour
---
The quest is a bit tough but it's good armour and it increases your carry weight by 100
---
Yep. The Whitespring staff can confirm this. Wish there was a penetrator perk card.
---
explosive combat rifles are nice
---
😁 that's just 1 way. But nope. Not yet.
---
Would be kinda awesome if it was mine I don't have a picture.
---
Yeah, i'm planning a running 15 luck with 3 crit savvy, 3 grim reapers sprint a 1 better crit (only had room for 1 because of starched genes and class freak).
---
LMAO!
---
They're mindless zombies, so they can't figure much out. But the *only* place they plant their feet and just shoot at a wall is your camp.
---
Walls, floors, and roofs should be invincible. Arguably furniture as well. There's just no reason to destroy that stuff. Anything that is aesthetic might as well be invincible. Any kind of resource or functional item should be a target.
---
wait, so you are no longer even playing the game, but you came here to post this thread?!?!?!?!?! wtf?
---
move on with your life, its just a video game ffs
---
If you’re on PS4 I have 3 of those mods
---
You can only hold like 250 of them so you're close!!
---
The are also found now in the red tool boxes. I’ve seen several lately.
---
That was the one I got! Thank you.
---
If you die to a legendary you have the chance to earn an additional legendary item... I'm never seen more than three, I've heard of 5
---
For the plans?  Pretty much no.  Server hop Phoenix and Watoga and the mod themselves tend to be there.
---
well said and good parenting too your right no likes a mooch and thank christ it is viable to play this game alone cause groups just arn't my bag---
---
Might make the first pic my computer wallpaper, looks awesome
---
I use semi auto exclusively but in pvp it takes alot of skill to beat auto builds.
---
I’ve seen those, I’m not sure if you can use them to unlock the crafting tho.
---
As a followup, does the game even register hits on multiple targets from the same shot? It seems like explosive splash damage does, but I feel like shotgun spread doesn't. In FO4 I could reliably headshot multiple enemies if they lined up. Tried it the other day on some low level ghouls with my 50cal sniper and the bullet stopped at the first ghoul.
---
Sorry, man. I’m on PS4
---
yes. I have an explosive 10mn smg for sale all moded
---
I don’t think they’re pay to win per se but they sure look like the start of a disturbing trend towards it.
---
Putting a hair trigger receiver on a hunting rifle literally only increases the fire rate by 1 or 2, and the base is 5. Calling it a negligible difference is an absurd understatement... I think it's also the same for revolvers, but slightly better.
---
With the effects and mods we have, adding additional fire rate is horribly ineffective for many weapons. Raw damage will give more benefit than additional fire rate ever will. Also additional fire rate is only worth a damn on mid range fire rate weapons. If it's way to slow like a hunting rifle, the "benefit" is hardly even observable, and on something like a minigun where you're already throwing out dozens of bullets per second down range, shooting low damage even faster isn't remotely efficient, and with how damage resistance works and scales in this game, additional damage is heavily favored.
---
On PS4 as well and have been playing for about 4 hrs now with no problems.
---
Being alone on a server can happen on adventure mode. For some reason the nerfed survival hard and a lot of people who only bought the game to play survival don't play it anymore. The players on top of the leader board should be the players with most kills like it used to be and the caps limit should be 100 not 50.
---
this guy gets it.... the digital age of dis-information is here to swallow the young

Agree we need that CAP limit higher.
---
does anything else matter?
---
Great post and thank you for doing this. How does furious stack with +50% VATS crits? It sure seems to me to spike off the charts but that's' just my gut and no real testing behind it.
---
That would be interesting since however long ago, BGS added locks to called in govt drops - only the person who called the drop gets it "free"  anyone else picking the lock gets a wanted status.  If legendaries were added to the crate...
---
You:  I need assistance!  Send a cargobot STAT!
---
Terminal: Roger, it's on it's way!
---
Cargobot Drop:  Here's six shotgun shells, good luck!
---
Thanks! It actually works great as a PC background. I'd be flattered if you did.
---
Wow thats a lot of bugs but at least they fixing some yet brings me down when they add a bunch in following update.
---
It’s an online game... cheats are off the table man.
---
Shit tier. Hitting multiple targets will reset the stacks!
---
I can't get the Rusty Pick or Watoga High School to complete
---
What's your GT, I'd like to swing by sometime
---
Tse explosive dragon.
---
Are you playing PVP? SURVIVAL?
---
That would finally give me a reason to use my 500+ Government supply tapes.
---
You can prolly skip some perks at 15 luck.  There's diminishing returns because with crit savvy you will crit every 3rd shot (iirc) and perks to increase ap gain or refill the crit bar will just take that to every other shot or similar.
---
also, I've heard that better criticals doesn't stack with the legendary effect, though if it were me I'd definitely test that.
---
I had some bug, had about 124-125 of them, then there was some error that I consent place any more of them in my stash, then some how ended up with 3k+ of them in stash &gt;.&lt;
---
Bull. There's already mods
---
Yeah I’m not to sure either. I had mine already... I don’t even wanna day how long i server hopped to get it lol. Maybe I’ll pick the next one up I find and send it to a mule char.
---
Were you able do get the nukashine one?
---
I'm in the Adventure mode, PVE
---
Sounds like you joined survival.... join Adventure
---
I heard "welcome to the circus of value" in my head when i read the title
---
Yes. The only ones that will not work for me are the two I said. All my others worked.
---
Visit mothman museum town and pick up eggs.  Make omelets and sell them for 9 caps a piece.
---
I’m for this. Maybe an eyebot network could tell us a timer on events so we don’t drop everything for something about to expire halfway across the map.
---
Which I personally don’t feel like should be allowed in an online game. The experience isn’t the same across the board then, but meh whatever. 
---
You seem pretty willing to fight and I really don’t want to.
---
Diner just northeast of the super duper mart in Watoga..  Either on one of the tables or on the magazine rack.
---
Yeah, same issue. I know I never sold it, cause I'm a hoarder and I haven't sold any of the questline outfits, and yet I don't have it. Having to redo the quest on an alt is such a dumb thing, you should be able to make them on a workbench.
---
If the kits didn't drop ingame then they would be very close to p2w. I use the improved kits all the time and it's clearly an advantage not having to store junk on you or having to find a bench to repair.
---
I think this is right but for a lot of people having player encounters be less common is a good thing and more what you would expect out of a survival game. I think there needs to be more of a balance between the two and I don't think a mechanic that shows exactly where people are is a good one.
---
I just sold them for like 900 caps or less
---
oooohhh.
---
I am in Adventure
---
Your mileage seems to match mine.. My kryptonite are those Mirelurk kings. nasty little buggers.
---
I believe 76 has rendering issues when the game loads a long distance scene, such as looking at a valley from a higher ground - this causes some crayola type of graphical smearing and can easily ruin immersion. However I find when in a smaller space like in a levelled elevation I find the detail is either the same or slightly better. It's hard to tell since it's essentially the same engine, level of detail really depends on what sprites the devs decided to place in an area.
---
Most players agree THESE are not the but are very close and is a very slippery slope.
---
That makes sense. I died at least 10 times trying to kill that thing.
---
There’s also a big difference in fixer models and versions.  I have a level 45 that I bought at a vendor.  With mods it’s about 80 dmg per shot.  My older level 30 fixer was much less dmg.
---
I run a stealth sniper type build as well in survival mode.  I’m also a sucker for rifles and use a lot of different versions in survival.  Blooded 3 star auto handmade w/dmg reduction while aiming + suppressor and large magazine is my latest and greatest.  125dmg per shot and 25 shot clip just works fools over.
---
With the vendor caps pool all combined now, I just loot loot loot, sell sell sell. I max out the full 1400 within a few minutes of logging on. Plus player vending is really pumping in the caps. I make a few hundred daily. Don't sell trash, and don't overprice your stuff and you'll be in business in no time.
---
The fixer lol
---
Turn on pacifist mode in ur options
---
For the few test a made, that make sense. Never thing about our character position but since all my visitor appear near my CAMP item while i was testing the spawn point, i believe in your theory/testing.
---
Are you playing on Survival? If so, switch to Adventure mode as Survival is basically nothing else but PvP. I’ve had nearly no issues with people in Adventure. I hope this bad intro didn’t ruin it completely, because there’s many more experiences of good out there to be had, and I hope this was just an outlier for you!
---
They can't attack you if you're in adventure unless you hit back.
---
Just throw a granade to get a hit on the target. you can't do damage to other players during an event.
---
It's more the wasted time than the caps for me.
---
Very cool... Unfortunately I went to the dark side. Would love to provide some OPFOR if you're interested. Hunt us down, hold a fortified position etc.
---
Sincerely,
---
Raider Scum

PSA: supply drops are considered chem containers and Pharma Farma works on them.
---
I've got 273 waiting for absolutely nothing. I doubt they will ever be changed, but it's a nightmare selling them and they don't weigh anything, so there's no reason not to hoard them
---
Military places mostly. I've had one spawn near the front desk at Ft. McClintock, and also at Sugar Grove, I think. Either in the room with all the fans/desks, or the control room. Don't remember which, I'm afraid. I got the perk that notifies you when a magazine is around in a perk pack. I threw it on for the hell of it.
---
Or that, I guess.
---
nice!
---
rooftops of watoga?
---
Just got on but so far so good
---
Ok ill try em again thanks for the info!
---
What about a mechanic that encourages conflict because one side holds a resource. I mean a real resource... workshops don't really qualify though they could be modified to do so. Grant XP or caps for holding something.
---
Right. Yeah, that's pretty easy to avoid though as you can generally see the markers and the death notifications.
---
graham estate? there's always a body part mostly for the t-51 on one of the tables
---
Well in that case. Are you sure they are attacking? Some players will shoot to get your attention when dropping care packages for you. 
---
Also worth noting unless you engage back, you can ignore and not get any damage. 
---
What platform you on? I'm on ps4, i could toss some supplies your way.
---
Agreed it has never been entirely fixed and while it does not trigger all the time it certainly does trigger from time to time.   There is no apparent rhyme or reason to why it triggers or does not trigger.
---
My insult bot ended with a "BOOM ROASTED" and that was funnier than the joke itself, I loved that office skit:
---
*   *Stanley, you crush your wife during sex and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted.*
---
I don't wanna generalise, but I'm gonna. I can guess an average age of players that build these stupid-looking sky boxes is 12.
---
Loot everything. Scrap it, bulk it and sell it. Sell steel, lead, acid and plastic on reddit to players and sell everything else to vendors.
---
If I don't feel like farming I'll make Marine Tactical Helmets and vendor them. Make sure to use Super Duper and it's easy and quick.
---
This. Pacifist is not on by default.
---
Agreed Marrexi.
---
&gt; Call me old but I just miss the good ole days
---
Yup, I too am on that boat.. Slide over man.. Here's a beer.. take the hand down..
---
Fallout 76 is so good I even got my dad in the action and he is on the save seat on the other side of me on that boat. He the one that gave me the beer to had to you..
---
You’re welcome friend!
---
thanks for stating the obvious!
---
Oh I had hard time to find right hand for that OA too. I used an ultracit as a replacement for 2 weeks. When I do not wanted to find the t51b right hand anymore, I found it.
---
Yep, getting "failed to download config"
---
Agreed. That’s what I am trying to do.  Thanks
---
I agree, I tried to make a viable pistol/crit build before and I felt it was doodoo.  As you stated agility gets tapped out with pistol cards leaving little room for any additional "agility" support. I would love to see a good pistol build out in the world.
---
[](/sbbackpack)As of a few days ago I can now only fast travel out of my PA(full excavator, with cal shocks even when the bug procs) since my normal armor is all weapons weigh 20% less. I wish we could at least get weight management legendaries for PA.
---
Fellow Systems Architect here. One lesson I've learned the hard way is that no matter how nifty you think a solution is, a) if it's slow or unreliable nothing else will matter, and b) if users get the opinion that it's bad (regardless of if it is or why), you are probably looking at getting the solution kicked out either sooner or later down the road.
---
I'm a FO4 player and fan, and it's why I bought this game even with the bad press - and at that, it sat on my shelf for a couple of months before I actually installed it, and I've been playing maybe 2 months at most now. There's parts I really like, but many thing I find just aggravating, like feeling like you need to find/collect everything to scrape together the smallest amount of caps but constantly being overweight and being unable to fast-travel (which sucks because you already pay a fairly expensive price to do so, and once I've explored an area, it shouldn't be a burden to jump around it.)
---
The stability and performance problems were glaring, even after being on the market for 3 months - and regardless of how much I or you like the game, to expand an online game and keep those customers, it needs to be rock solid. 
---
Also, I continue to find many things in the game non-intuitive, or not gamer friendly. I'd assume that most players, like me, have relied heavily on Reddit or Wikis to figure out the many things that just are not apparent because the game does not explain them. Like quests sending to different areas that are easily accessible but the game not fencing areas off when players are too low level or warning them before proceeding. Just one example, but Witcher 3 did a great job of creating several large areas with tons to do that kept players in areas that were not overwhelming to them. 
---
I suspect that in order to thrive, the game is going to need to massively improve in performance, and the experience for new, non-FO experienced player, including making progress at low levels easier yet not making players feel rushed to get to level 30-40.
---
Still not working for me, full hunger and tried various weapons on various enemies
---
Thing is, the first three things could potentially happen. Post apocalyptic world or not, ain't no building ever going to deny physics
---
Yep, but never a t-51 right arm, I’ve had multiple evrything else, but not the arm
---
The biggest issue I have currently is if you spawn into the golf club it can take up to 5 minutes for everything to load.  In the meantime, you are being drilled by invisible ghouls or those that float horizontally across the ground.  I mean, WTF Bethesda.
---
He's right man. Even if some people are leaving, its going to be EVEN worse if they halted their new content and worried only about stability.
---
Yeah, we're in the same place.
---
Your place sounds nice. I went a different way, like I said I've got a small two story house up on the cliff with workbenches on the first floor and a small living room on the second floor. There's also a bedroom room and a bathroom, both 1 foundation big on the second floor. The house has a small patio on the front and the vending machines at the side with a little waiting area (because my store is always soooooo busy /s).
---
Then I've got a small garden and a bootlegging shack against the cliff side towards the north west.
---
Down in the lake I've got the acid extractor, a water purifier and a small shack with a fusion generator inside powering everything.
---
Oh yeah, I've also got a brahmin walking around, deathclaw eggs hidden around the place and more bunny plushies than I'd like to admit scattered all around.
---
Locked door in the barn behind the isolated radio array.  Fairly consistent for me
---
As it is people can craft stuff for other people, so what does it matter if there are more mods floating around in the world? Maybe make it so you have to have the plan to install a mod, but it could still save a few bits of scrap or something.
---
I feel your pain.  I've submitted a bug report about this.  I've gotten a total of 1 since patch 9 and that one I bought from another player.
---
Xo1 ? That’s what I need. Made the mistake of entering a nuked zone with my pa on. I couldn’t get it off fast enough
---
If you are on PS4 I can craft you one I think
---
Probably the people too shitty for pvp servers that are looking for new ways to annoy people in adventure.
---
You can, but that takes the mod slot that could be used for something else that you could have if you used marine, assuming the radiation resistance it provides is of a level acceptable to you.  Either way you will still be using radx/radaway sometimes, just with marine it would be less often.  If you use a bloodied build and keep nerd rage up the extra radiation resistance might keep you from dying more often due to radiation spikes.  If you want to sneak then you could the mod to make marine ultralight and have some radiation resistance, rather than using the mod to add lead which adds weight and makes you less stealthy.  Your play style, stats and perks are all determining factors as much as the armor protection level in determining which is best for you.  You might want to have multiple sets of armor for different circumstances.  Your call.
---
my level 80 lost hers the same way logged off wearing it, logged in next day and it was gone soon as i seen her appear i was like why is she not wearing the mask as i had seen it on her as i logged out, open inventory and its gone.  
---
my other two still have and are wearing theirs.
---
Nothing is pay to win. Simply pay to get ahead. And that’s not a problem as long as you don’t lock more progress behind money. For instance, locking a higher max level cap behind money paywalls.
---
sounds like hes playing on xbox actually lol.
---
Been experiencing more server disconnects and crashes, no doubt.
---
Not sure when you stopped, but they did add in a check for your CAMP placement.  if someone is already there, it offers to let you change servers, so theoretically your CAMP shouldn't disappear anymore because of server changes.  If you opt to stay though, you get to place it again for free.
---
I yearn for a huge repeatable raid style dungeon with 2 f---k tons of monsters to grind I hope this happens at some point I am starting to name the ghouls at whitesprings cause I know exactly where they spawn and how many.. I just want more places to grind
---
Brotherhood of Steel events will occasionally drop the plans for it.  I've had some luck with Distant Thunder and Line in the Sand.
---
They actual mod is not uncommon at the Watoga BOS vendor. Might take some server hopping, but relatively easy compared to getting shocks for X01.
---
I love the sound of something like that, give players who want to actively engage in PVP combat better options to do that because you are right the map is big and the player count is relatively low.
---
I think serums are listed under Misc. for the little camp pop up so that's worth keeping an eye on.
---
How does one kill something that has no life......oh hang on....wrong TV show.......
---
Hope for the best, but plan for the worst.
---
To clarify, while in an event you are all part of the same team. You can tell as everyones name will turn from white to yellow.
---
That being said, be careful as sometimes you or others might not be part of the event even though you are at the event (glitch/bug), or if event just ended or they joined late. If a players name is now white, you'd be initiating PvP with them by hitting them.
---
Sure, they arnt technically p2w. But they sure as shit arnt cosmetics either, and we were told cosmetic only. 
---
I’m enjoying 76 at this point, they’ve definitely made some improvements, but I see no reason to trust a word coming from Bethesda going forward. Between this and Howard’s interview it feels like they are getting ahead of a story that hasn’t happened yet.
---
I’m betting something at E3 that’ll split the community. Which I hope doesn’t happen because without that the game would have died by now.
---
What u/giplo1 .  Try out a hunting rifle with .50 receiver and a piercing mag.  I can make you one if you are on XB1.
---
Nice town man! May have to try something of this sort
---
Hi There! I had one spawn for me yesterday at Toxic Larry's Meat and Go upstairs.
---
Novac has been my favorite fallout location ever.  So much so, we named our dog Novac!
---
What’s so good about there?
---
[](/absilly)I have a rule these days, if I'm at an event, or farm location, or what have you, and I see another player there I will invite them to a team. If they accept then neither of us has anything to worry about, and loot will be shared even if one of us one hits a legendary.  
---
If they don't accept then I take that as an every man for himself situation.  
---
It's not a perfect system, a lot of people will avoid joining teams since there's a lot of grief involving camps around it, and almost no one in 76 wants to be social, but it's the best I've come up with.
---
Ah, yeah forgot those stupid things. I can't one shot a mirelurk queen but I feel like I've gotten a king before in one shot but can't be sure. But their perception is so dang high I can't get very close or they spot me. With their speed and their stagger attack, those are my most hated creature in the game.
---
I’m on Xbox but thank you for the offer
---
I don’t even want the plans tbh, I just want the armour, that’s all
---
Getting allot of unknown errors
---
Screw a system that allows companies to underpay workers and require them to be subsidized by the government for their basic needs while the executives and shareholders reap profits off of other's hard work well beyond the merit of their own "innovation and work".
---
When the "innovation" is buying a drug company and raising prices of a non-novel drug that many people depend on to live, well, that is NOT innovation, that is simply ***greed*** and exploitation - it should be a *crime* and the people that do it should be in prison.
---
Yes, people should be able to be rewarded for hard work, for brilliance, etc., but not BILLIONS of dollars!!!?!?  
---
Any person who would even briefly consider it morally acceptable to hoard that much wealth to themselves is not fit to be called a human being - not even close.
---
Hey man! We are definitely open to organizing something 👍 actually I’ll send you a link to a joint faction server we are apart of.
---
I've actually done this..... on purpose. I was the only one on my team without a camp so we went to my spot and saw a camp there so we lured 3 super mutants to attack it. Did some damage, but I think he must have seen 4 level 130+ players hanging at his camp for 15 minutes (he wasn't a vendor) and logged off the server without checking on his camp. I didn't want a bounty and I wanted my spot. I'm pretty much a terrible person.
---
The fact that you had to find &amp; provide this info &amp; not Bethesda is a pretty bad failure of communication on their part. It's a shame that it's up to us to work out these details.
---
I did. A keypad switch. But how to wire it up took a little while. Now I know the blue box powers the inside pad and you run another power line to the switch you add and from there to the top of the door.
---
SBQ = scorch beast queen
---
*3 = legendary 3 star

SQKTC= sheepsquatch

1. Follows laws of physics.

---
Takes time to put some toilet paper and fertilizer in each bag
---
I have had it spawn 3 times now fun fact I was a little swing happy on one you can kill these ffffers and then no note for you........
---
I didnt attack back nor were they trying to get my attention.  They were just hitting/shooting me and when I would run (not enough caps to FT) the would follow and kept hitting/shooting me.
---
Some stuff is too good to scrip even if it's not something you'd use. I'd rather someone else use a demi-god roll I got that doesn't fit my build than send it off into oblivion.
---
This just pisses me off on multiple levels, and I admit it doesn’t speak well of me that what truly angers me is the idea of people standing around and watching someone die when I can’t find someone to revive for the damned merit badge.
---
No worries.
---
Rolling Pin
---
I wish we had a better way of getting to them rather than just fast travelling 30 or so caps away to reach the things
---
I wonder if player vending has anything to do with it? Trying to create market scarcity? Sure is rude in any event. If I catch the legendary first I use the emote that beckons other players. 🤷‍♀️
---
Haha, something good comes from me being a mediocre player.
---
Yes, relogging was one of the first things I did as well. Thank you for the suggestion though!
---
You're looking at the word 'win' too literally.
---
If they sell you something that helps, but is only slightly more convenient than doing without, that's borderline P2W, but not in a way that's disruptive.  You get a small benefit without having to go kill off SBQ.  It saves you a little time farming/leveling up. 
---
But what if they charged you 1000 atoms for a level up?  You still don't 'win', you're just stronger.  Sure, you can do that in game, and it takes more time, but you can still do it without paying.  But that's definitely in the P2W category.
---
What about 5000 atoms, and you get a free level 50 character boost?  Or 10000 atoms and a level 50 character with 5 free random legendaries?
---
They're all steps down the same path.  And while I agree that the repair kits aren't really a serious problem, what (if anything) is the next step they take?
---
So basically you don't understand capitalism.
---
I just block those players that use teams to grief. I have no time for them.
---
I really wouldn’t mind a mr handy at my place even for just 1 defense! It would be so cool either way
---
I'd just like to see wooden armor removed from the pool. I've never had a reason to use it, and I don't even know if there is a plan to craft it.
---
The T-51 spawns on 2 roof tops there.
---
One on top of the hospital and one by the train station where there's a downed chopper thing. that one is always there. you can prob. server hop a few time and fin it
---
I nuke locked houses that have vending machines with no stash boxes don't have a workbench outside for scrapping.
---
I'm not gonna lie - when the game was on sale I bought a second copy for a "mule" account to hold legendaries.  
---
Since the purveyor release they are now my cap cronies. Selling extra chems/aid/water and the infinite gauntlets/shotguns from urnaium fever is their only purpose if I'm capped and still have spares. I lose caps per se without hard bargain but I keep them stocked with grape mentats and omeletes to at least get some return.
---
Still better then scrapping them for more steel and mole miner teeth.
---
I'd like to see both weapons and mods actually. More than just receivers, minor stock changes, and different sized magazines and scopes. Literally even adding flashlights or something would be cool
---
I avoid that by keeping the same type on the same frame, not mix &amp; match parts on the same frame. 
---
For names, I use an easy identifier :
---
.Excvtr-L45  or .T60-L50incmpl
---
The leading . puts it at the top of the apparel list. 
---
 incmpl is incomplete, meaning the frame is missing at least one max level part.  
---
since they are only 10#, I carry one incmpl frame.  
---
When you find a frame in the wild, just pointing at it at it will display what parts are on it.
---
hit the transfer button to see the level.
---
Fro my example, if T60 L50 parts, I place the T60, check part I need, compare....
---
if the unclaimed set has something I need, then use the transfer button to take that part,  place it on my T60.  recall my T60.  (Once the set is complete, I'll rename it to .T60-L50.)
---
that leave the frame in place for the next person, and I don't have to carry parts I don't need
---
Floopwood....
---
It’s been happening to me a lot. Twice now in nuke zones, LMG, Gatling, Explosive rifle and Tesla all affected. Four times not in nuke zones with even ballistic damage being given back after VATS or just shooting. 
---
Melee was unaffected. I was able to get the game to recognize damage from my sledge and gauntlet only. I finally just left the server.
---
Is your FE gun perhaps tagging other nearby mobs with the explosive splash-damage, causing your 'stack' to keep resetting?
---
Ultracite is the source of the scorched plague. They'll freak if you remove it.
---
I have mine built in the first section above the ground on one of the monorail structures. I had initially built inside the top of one, and it was actually pretty awesome, but you could ONLY get to it by walking the monorail out a couple hundred meters. Didn’t figure I’d get much business at my vendor lol. Was bummed when I figured out spawning there just spawned at the base. I was like... whelp, now a ten minute walk to actually get to my CAMP...
---
This whole p2w thing is beyond ridiculous. These people are either desperate for something to complain about or have no clue what p2w means. Black ops 4 just released a bunch of new weapons, some of which are pretty damn good, that are locked exclusively behind their reserves. Meaning anybody who wants to use them has to either buy their supply drops or get lucky by getting one from the reserve crates they grind through black market progression. 
---
Players buying supply drops get to use the new superior weapons early (or at all) and unlock attachments to make them better -&gt; gives them a clear advantage over those who don't. Not having to spend 2 minutes going to a bench to repair stuff or taking a bit of time out of your day to actually loot all the resources around you is a minor convenience, not an advantage. Abusing terms like this just leads to nobody taking it seriously anymore.
---
Incorrect. Read the card. It states it increases damage per hit. It also indirectly increases damage by allowing you to target weak points, like a head, for double damage. The direct damage bonus numbers are currently unknown.
---
This is also what I do
---
Any update?
---
Yeah, near Flatwoods! Practically neighbors. Come pop in for some... Fertile soil
---
I'll give you mine, if that would work. I finished that quest ages ago and haven't felt compelled to go back to the basement since.
---
I disconnected once inside WS not wearing PA and re-logged into a Nuke lol I ran really fast to the doors and made it. I think everyone dies from this when they start out, ya never forget :)
---
I hate this weekly so much. It should be craft 10, not 25.
---
This is a honest question, and I'm not trying to bash:  Why aren't some of these fixed relatively fast when the exact problem and the fix are both listed?  Many of these have been broke since launch.  I understand quality control and all that but if the guys responsible for this stuff could just read these posts then I don't see how 75% of these bugs can't be fixed in a couple days. 
---
Part of my job is maintaining database programs and a good portion of my time is figuring out the bugs.  If I had someone telling me what all the bugs were and the possible fixes I would get done in a fraction of the time.
---
Same here. I would even be happy with a one room encounter where hoards of random mobs and bosses rush out of a door in waves that a group of players has to put down. 
---
Something with some roguelike elements would do this game so much good.
---
nahhh pretty sure they are just being dbags----- yes I would pay good money for a your number 1 middle finger emote for these types
---
thanks for the joke post! made me laugh!
---
I'm enjoying the new updates, still waiting for display cases...
---
Sounds like your typical trolls then. Unfortunately we have them. No real way to avoid the initial contact, but going forward just block them and logout and back on. You'll be placed on a new server without them and will never see them again.
---
Looks like your next job is to test the damage bonus from Concentrated Fire!
---
Just to add to this, I randomly came across a Robot Dense Mod today sitting inside the Crevasse Dam.  So, maybe they can come up as random mod spawns in the world.
---
i want to live in your world of magic and unicorns where the first 3 could ever happen hehehe
---
Console player? 
---
I've never run into anyone that sounds even remotely like a kid on PC.
---
So, after logging off and back on a bunch of times to no avail, I think I've found a fix:
---
1. Put the affected weapon in your stash.  
---
2. Quit to main menu.  
---
3. Log back in.  
---
4. Retrieve your weapon from the stash.
---
That fixed the glitch for me. I think it's the weapon itself that gets glitched out somehow, and stashing it/retrieving it forces the game to do something that clears the glitched state.
---
Give it a try and let me know if that works for you.
---
Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out when I can :)
---
For any of you who think repair kits are ptw provide data on many fights are you in where a repair kit successfully used would have made a difference if you want BGS to change their mind.  
---
They seem to have data they can see that tells them more players want the convenience relative to the number of pvp players that would have a different pvp outcome if someone used a repair kit and they based their decision on that.
---
Console player.
---
You needed a spatula, right?  No?  Well,  you're getting one anyway.
---
I have 256 of them and every time I try and loot another it tells me I've reached maximum I can hold. Weird you have more
---
I will. Thanks!
---
Yeah, me too. Don't like how they switched it from "camp decoration" to "display cases." Kinda makes me think we can't display things how we want
---
this was my first time seeing what's it like inside a nuke zone, too bad I only lasted a minute x)
---
Thank you, hopefully it will work
---
I came across this awhile ago as well! Stopped me in my tracks, stood at a distance in stealth listening until they decided to patrol again. 
---
Hilarious
---
apparently not
---
Camp Fire Tales every time... sorry but 98% of the time people show up in PA decked out like they're ready for the SBQ to fight low lvl bugs and ticks and maybe some under lvl40 legendary with one shot screw everyone else mentality... happens a lot!
---
Well I can’t speak for everyone but i don’t always carry Stimpaks and if I do it’s like 3-5. Unless it’s something important that I can’t spawn back to I don’t waste them. Might look selfish but sometimes I just can’t help you
---
I know, I got 2 kids of my own. Those 3 kind of stood out on how they were on the mic. And I am not saying all are like that. I have had a few encounter afterwards that went way better than that.
---
So awesome to find an encounter like this after all this time.
---
Thanks! Gonna try to make a town building vid at some point. Just to get the main tips down. It's actually easy once you see what you want to do in your mind's eye, might just need to fiddle with it until you get a vision
---
Someone had a witty post until they realized they were nerfed all along. From 0 to Edit(sorry) really Damn quick.
---
Store junk on you? All benches will reference the stash, no need to carry any. Unless that's what you meant then ignore me :p
---
Yeah man it’s impossible to get killed without you doing damage back or initiating, sorry I’m calling bullshit on your post. You just want some attention
---
The vast (and I mean almost everything in the game) is soloable.
---
We need the opposite of more solo content, we need more reasons to group up with other players.
---
I have been looking for strangler blooms for a few days now and no luck. Gonna try and server hop tonight hopefully I will have some luck.
---
So you truly don't understand how those things are completely different. If I'm alright with a green creature that's been given a backstory then I have to be alright with floating houses that clearly aren't an intended part of the game design?
---
High five, I have one also! I got it a long time ago and refuse to part with it. It's going to my alt that I imagine as being a chef for our vault 76.  Sneaking around in chef hat, instigating rolling pin, grabbing all the ingredients to cook fabulous meals.
---
JFC who the fuck downvoted me - did they even READ what I said?  Surely not.
---
Honestly I level grind by taking and defending workshops. And do the scorch queen events. Make sure you tag enemies even if you cant kill them. You still get the exp.
---
Mine works just fine unless some of the flechettes miss. Maybe share a vid so we can see whats going on
---
I buy explosives weapons mode them all up sell them for about 5000 caps. takes a while for people to by them.
---
Moar mutant random encounters/convos pls haha
---
Love it. I hope those poor low level folk didn't just quit the game.
---
Better fupa like fat than poopa like scat. Thanks for checking us out and visiting. If you're on PS4 then you should check us out and get some gear upgrades
---
There's a weekly challenge for killing 5 legendary enemies.
---
You actually have to deal the killing blow for it to register.
---
Could be. It wasn't a very useful "daily" weapon.
---
What weapon is this "2 clips" referring to?
---
I have a Bloodied Gauss (full stop, nothing else) with Prime applied.  
---
I have 8 in Rifleman, 1 Bloody Mess, Adrenal mutation with my health at roughly 25%. I recently found out that I can drop a lvl 80 SB that just popped out of a fissure (not yet airborne) in 4 shots. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor.
---
I mean naturally I was sneaking so I probably got 2 shots off before I was flagged as spotted, but seems like as long as I'm not beyond my Gauss' distance (I only use the Compensator), it's generally 4 or 5 shots. 
---
Mind you, in my case, problem is being able to hit it quickly enough lol Not only am I contending with it flying around, but my shitty rural cellular 'broadband' latency, ***and*** the Scorched adds. My Furious 25% Faster Prime Gat Plasma can't even down one as fast as my Gauss, nevermind the huge amount of missed (wasted) shots it incurs lol. However, I also don't have any perks for Heavy, as I've yet to really research a heavy build (or any build, for that matter!)
---
Yeah this baffles me too. It does not take long even just selling to npc vendors.
---
I'm not suggesting you fudged the data on your end. It doesn't seem like you use heavy guns, and just weren't familiar with it. It's understandable to a degree.
---
&gt;We also don't have a realistic way to simulate semi-auto with this chart vs automatic - which is exactly why I selected Powerful Automatic in my samples.
---
I thought we were using an automatic handmade because we were comparing it to auto-only heavies, but sure i guess.
---
&gt;(compare the Gauss rifle, for example... not sure we would call that "real world" comparison and declare Rifles the highest DPS in the game).
---
I have absolutely no idea what you're trying to say here. It feels like you changed what you were saying halfway through. I'm not trying to be insulting here, I just literally do not know.
---
&gt;The reasoning behind that was to better reflect more of the mechanics and accessibility. It would take you an afternoon to get a new character to a Hunting Rifle with most of the mods unlocked. Might take a couple of afternoons to get a handmade with hardened receiver and perforating magazine. A minigun with accelerated barrels? You're not picking it up that way and especially not at level 35(!). Also, tbh, last I compared Minigun barrels the Tri barrels beat Accelerated, but that was before the overall fire-rate reduction across the board. Tank Killer has 0 cost - Stabilized has a material cost in at least fusion cells.
---
I mean sure, but I don't buy this in a balance discussion. I think I'm seeing that we're arguing at different points. You're still on the original OP, whereas I'm on your [original reply to me]
---
(https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bwxv0z/heavy_gun_rework_ideas/eq1pems/) which was about, to my interpretation, endgame DPS, because that was my argument for keeping stabilized locked to PA.
---
Anyhow, I don't think it'll take as long as you're saying to get the accel barrel on miniguns. You can certainly do it by around the time it takes you to get both the relevant handmade mods. About the difference between Tri and Accel, tri has higher base damage but accel has the insane fire rate. I have not tested extensively, but it feels faster than the friggin LMG lol.
---
The cost of stabilized is negligible in combat. You farm up a few cores when things are slow, but in the middle of a firefight.
---
&gt;We don't even get armor piercing magazines for heavies ("free", no equipment or perk requirements, only one-time material costs).
---
This is true, and a shame, but they do not need them.
---
&gt;The DPS chart doesn't have anything consideration for head shots, Concentrated Fire, etc. A headshot with Concentrated Fire from a hunting rifle will beat quite a lot.
---
I hadn't noticed that. Heavies can spew enough lead to get headshots fairly often, but Vats and Concentrated Fire are not easily accessible to heavies.
---
&gt;That user has additional opportunities: drop 3 points in Blocker, Serendipity, etc that all work outside of PA and are far, far more efficient than Bullet Shield. 60 DR at max level isn't worth level 1 of Blocker and even Emergency Protocols can't beat damage avoidance.
---
I don't know who told you Bullet Shield is integral to the Heavy guns build but it is not. I'm around level 270 and i don't even have a single rank of it. I run Blocker when I'm expecting combat (Queen, Squatch etc), dropping my bear arms2 and bandolier1 for it.
---
It's very true that Serendipity is a huge loss. No argument there. While Protocols are very powerful, Non PA has sentinel/cavalier and Serendipity.
---
&gt;In the same way that we're naively omitting that mechanic of a "good" Rifleman build I think it would be fair to omit the mechanics of a "good" Heavy build. "Good" indicating a min/max scenario where we've decided that the Heavy Weapons user is kitted out full Bloodied, Adrenal, Emergency Protocols, etc, etc and comparing with a Rifleman loaded out with Serendipity in Sentinel armor.... there's no comparison. Rifleman wins.
---
Again, no argument. Any optimized build in PvP dunks on any Power Armor build, even an optimized PA build. I'm very aware my build sucks the devil's taint in pvp. I was talking raw numbers. DPSing down SBQ, Imposter, Alpha Cryptids.
---
&gt;I would also invite you to try to cripple something. Tormentor and Enforcer, for whatever reason in-game, work infinitely better than a 5mm with Accelerated Barrels with One Gun Army even though you would think the higher RPM would beat out the lower RPM equivalents on chance... to be quite honest, I don't even think One Gun Army works.
---
Hell if I know. I also don't use OGA. Shits dead before it gets crippled. If i were to go i to PvP, i think I wouldn't even then. Don't people always run Adamantium Skeleton? I'm not really up to date on the current PvP meta, but last time i brushed up everyone used it.
---
&gt;You can click through various other weapons. I think you'll find out quickly that, according to your own source, the weapon class with the highest DPS is not Heavy Guns at all but Rifles that have "free" Tank Killer, Concentrated Fire, headshot bonuses and get to keep all of their legendary armor effects and are accessible at much lower levels. With in game experience, topics like cripples are obviously worth trading 17 DPS to keep those effects and be able to cripple something.
---
If Tank Killer is free, Stabilized is free. I can understand why it seems like it wouldn't be, but a few pounds out of your inventory and occasionally taking a power plant (which passively generates cores I'll remind) is barely a cost at all. I'd liken it more to farming BF to upkeep your legendary armor than a restriction on Stabilized.
---
As for the DPS, you forget that that gap grows larger and larger the more optimized your build gets. Your 17 difference with a vanilla gun and the AP perks can quickly hurdle into the hundreds. Even literal thousands of DPS points in the most extreme circumstances, to the point where the rifleman *has* to use Concentrated Fire and vats crits to keep up.
---
I will admit, I am curious as to how much CF makes a difference, and how long Vats can be sustained for the sake of it. I have a blank level 50 character kicking around that I'm going to finally spec out now and get the rest of the perks for, and I'll try to trade for a BE or B25 handmade in the meantime.
---
that is entirely stupid, what a waste of time getting this backpack.  I wish i could return it and get the possum points back so I can use them to buy the other non backpack plans
---
Well you're different from alot of people. It's harder for a noob to experience the struggle of the early game these days. It's legitimately hard to avoid high levels that want to hold your hand.
---
im sad i just got a sentinel assassin powered wood left leg :( 
---
(Jun Long): I just need some time...
---
What a stupid mechanic. 🙄
---
Do you harass people into giving you their crops?
---
It is ridiculous. Worse is when it happens when you are afk or stuck in the middle of an event.
---
Well I guess they are super highly unlikely but technically/scientifically possible in our current world , but I'm no biologist mehehe
---
I love giving someone 15 stims, chems and water only to get a message, "you got 10 steel". Like fack, lol.
---
My condolences to you.
---
Hey, I \*WANT\* to be social. I really do. I have builds that are entirely built around being a team support character.
---
..and EVERY single time I have joined a team in the last month or so... it's resulted in me, dead, while someone steals my shit.  Every damn time. 
---
The anonymity of gaming allows a certain group of people to act like the assholes they wish they could be IRL, and they manage to screw it for everyone.
---
I think you should go for more aesthetics personally. Right now its amazing but extra budget I would go with decoration. Get that big crazy fountain and plop it in the middle, maybe build a gazebo.
---
Got mine ontop of a Monorail track as well, only way to access it is via the track, or me to lower a set of stairs! i have a welcome area on the ground with supplies, a vender, and a rad shower!
---
If you don’t get a drop you personally want that’s what the vending machines were put in game for.. sell what you don’t want, farm enemies and search machines for things you do. Putting a timer on items will make the game much less exciting when you actually get what you’ve been looking for. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
---
My thought process is that in the time it takes to do the repair sequence, I'm probably dead already. Maybe other people have different experiences, but I don't think I've had PvP last more than a few swings or shots, let alone enough to break a weapon.
---
Also the chest mod which gives you extra strength
---
Yeah, now that I think about it, this is starting to happen all over. Load times in general of equipment, quests, etc. are all taking a lot longer in the last week or so.
---
I encountered this in the savage divide, one of them said "be quiet or we'll be heard, wait... what was that?"
---
And then a level 91 glowing deathclaw jumped them and tore them to shreds
---
Move that set of two staircases in by one square. It'll look way better like that
---
You should definitely toss that back in the grinder :( Gotta save a little of your scrip limit in case you get a bugged piece like that. If I didn't know better I would buy it off of you lol
---
This is Photomode, not the actual camera?
---
I'm mostly satisfied with the Fallout 76 Photomode, I'd like a bit more variety in simple distressed photo frames as I'm too lazy to import them to Photoshop. 
---
If you haven't played it, I seriously recommend Horizon Zero Dawn. The Photomode is outstanding. Can even pause the game mid cutscene to edit.
---
As my father is fond of saying "I can't be both the buyer AND the seller... tell me what you want for it."
---
Try hard bargain 3 and grape mentats before checking the price.
---
Some time ago, I bought the generic "calibrated shock" plan (and the generic "motion assist servos") plan from a WS vendor bot.
---
I successfully crafted and applied the motion assist servos to both excavator and T60.
---
e.g. - the generic named plan worked on both armor types.
---
When I selected the legs, the option to craft/install calibrated shocks was present on both Excavator and T60, but greyed out (I didnt have enough violet flux) 
---
So seemingly, the generic named plan will work on all PA types.
---
That said, I recently found a plan specifically named "Plan: T-60 calibrated shocks" 
---
When I read the plan, the screen prompt did not echo "T60 calibrated shocks...learned"  it just said 
---
"calibrated shocks...learned"
---
This implies the "calibrated shock" and "T60 calibrated shock" plans are actually the same.
---
You don’t use any weapons ? Or just staff n such
---
Npcs
---
At that height I wasn’t able to build on the ground (from the top). It was outside of the build area. Where it is now I’m just not as impressed. Seemed kinda cool, but not as cool as being at the top of the world lol.
---
Why would it not be possible? Have you not played other MMOs like WoW, SWTOR, etc.? They add new harder content (raids, new areas to explore and do quests in that are more difficult), increase level cap (here that would be increasing the weapon levels), tweak abilities, add new ones, etc. Why couldn't that be done here?
---
I'm so bummed out man.
---
Thanks for those suggestions, man. I was wanting to put a centerpiece down in the middle but couldn't decide and also wasn't sure if it would feel right. It all feels either too big or too small to be a centerpiece
---
Surprisingly I rarely see this in survival servers. Everyone knows the etiquette I guess. Plus if they are being bitches we will just reject the event and open fire.
---
What happens more often is people wait for it to be over then wait for you to gather all the loot then come in Tesla's fireing knocking everyone down.
---
No, I understand it too well and see where it's growing "long in the tooth" - it's time for changes to meet changes in technology and society - we need to fight back 10 fold against the undoing of all that Ralph Nader achieved for The American People.
---
"Trickle Down" is bullshit, does not work - that's become abundantly clear, even to those who supported the idea initially.  
---
The "Free Market" is not some magic force that will sprinkle Unicorn Dust on all of us and make everything better.  No, when a typical person becomes very wealthy the also (perhaps gradually) become mentally ill and obsessed with greed, with "doing better" than the guy next to them.  They have a million dollar home?  Well, the Joneses over there have a 1.5 million dollar home, a yacht, and 2 summer vacation homes and next to them, we're poor and we need to "stop the government from \*\*\*stealing this money that I earned!!!\*\*\* - they fail to consider that they probably couldn't have become wealthy in the first place without infrastructure such as: a healthy, educated workforce, roads, utilities, internet and phone companies, police, fire, a military that protects our country, and last but not least: customers.  Taxation is \*\*\*not\*\*\* theft - tax \*\*evasion\*\* \*\*\*is theft\*\*\*!
---
All the fist weapons count as "unarmed" and are affected by the iron fist and gladiator cards to buff damage, so I'll be using a power fist or death claw gauntlet eventually
---
Yup they said that and then pulled out their guns and started patrolling, only instead of a deathclaw, it was me in the bushes WITH a deathclaw gauntlet.
---
The only issue i have with jumping forward in time, is does that mean there will be no more SBQ fights, no more discovering the mysteries behind the scorched plague?
---
The obvious solution to this is to create post-scorched servers, but then that divides the player base (look at paid DLC maps for first person shooters for these issues)
---
I really have to disagree. I really don’t think they made “super Mutants their own”
---
The Mutants look almost exactly the same as the Commonwealth strain. I wish they would’ve taken the time to develop them to look more different. Perhaps making them a completely difference color (Gray or tan) and a different bone structure and physique, maybe more grotesque (obvious from the complete failure that the Snallygaster FEV strain created) or otherwise. Maybe even going so far as to make them more orcish with protruding teeth
---
I think they really missed an opportunity here to use more “creature” NPCs. It would’ve been nice to see more Super Mutant questgivers or even a small peaceful supermutant town you could get access to
---
Interesting idea
---
Does that skin remove a star too?
---
I saw a super mutant trying to use a terminal for the first time recently, typing with only his index fingers. Reminded me of Strong. Tinker Tinker!
---
I learned that lesson the hard way, too.  
---
Never FT to WS without equipping PA or hazmat, and never logout from WS (even if you are inside the building) without putting on same first, as the spawn in point is not inside, its outside.
---
Lmao "muh roads"
---
I have a flea market at whitesprings and sell just about everything for 10 caps/ scrip.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying there's a bug where items won't stack. He's probably experiencing the same thing. I am with .38 rounds myself.
---
Sure the new voice lines are neat but in Fallout 4 they had full on conversations with each other in mutie speak if you stayed undetected. My only character in 76 is a sneak build and I don't recall hearing one of these conversation once.
---
yeah its video game, you arent supposed to believe any of it
---
honestly, id just be happy with a bright light for my excavator....
---
Yes, I've found several of these to no avail. Because I haven't found the tourist.
---
Q-tips.

---
It's all good, however, the parts that you have mentioned the needed junkies to make those stuff, needs to be converted to more valuable stuff, like nuclear material, because we don't want everyone to have them all at the first second, if so, then where is the fun of it. Also, the missions should be altered.
---
The kings of the black market don’t want any changes that mess up their good thing.
---
Yeah, once I realized that I stopped doing events for the challenge purpose if they had other players.
---
One good one that other people rarely do is the Leader of the Pack, it has 3 legendary wolfs in relatively close proximity.
---
Another weird thing is 'level 0' legendary enemies don't count toward the challenge.
---
But then those are weird in general. The have Legendary prefixed to their name, don't have any stars at the end of their name, don't have the legendary glow effect and don't regen when low health, and always drop 1 star legendary items.
---
Typical reaction from people who don't understand big new ideas - they say "that's stoopid".
---
Hahaha dude you have nooooo idea what you're talking about. With a sentinel build especially.
---
i read that laugh as an evil scientist laughing after he releases his creation unto an unsuspecting world
---
i guess it would be more MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHA but still
---
They had full conversations in 4 if you stayed undetected, does 76 have this? I don't recall hearing them speak with each other in 76.
---
We do not, we help plant the crops for them and protect them from the dangers of the wastes 👍 (ooc) our values are more like Elder Lyons from Fo3
---
I would be much happier with weight management for the stash, personally
---
I am not interested in fighting. Just some like mods, some don't. Don't use them if you don't like them but give me a few
---
re: /u/jaj22 also...  
---
I'm not properly perked out I'm sure, as I am setup just for what suits my solo-PvE sneaky gunner playstyle... That being said, I've fallen in love with Bloodied and Adrenal, which I stay at around 25% HP as that seems to bump up my various STR related perks/armor pieces to keep my carry capacity at around 415lbs (with lvl 50 backpack; not modded).
---
At any rate, I've been down running around at 5-10% HP plenty of times and *surely* at least once during then my Well Fed/Well Hydrated must've worn off. I mean I notice when it does due to my heartbeat and sound going quiet... At any rate, that must've been an old mechanic? I don't ever recall having just suddenly dropped dead. 
---
Can't deny I may just be lucky, as I don't *try* to remain at such low HP for very long. Only if I'm in dire need of the damage and not at risk of getting hit by anything heh
---
Ok I understand the perks, I just thought you where going straight bare fists I was like damn that’s an alpha move
---
"I heard you got drunk and missed exiting Vault 76 on time. Too bad you didnt do the same thing before entering it - CONTACTING BUrn WArd FOR ASSISTANCE" 😂 got my ass
---
Stale cigarettes anyone? Perhaps a hot bottle of soda?
---
They are 'pay for relief', which is troublesome because they control how grindy the systems that the relief items operate on are.
---
Go through your holotapes and relisten to them. Or just keep exploring. I think the story is meant to be mysterious.
---
This sounds like a burn from prior predictions on fridges but those didn't pan out. Maybe they'll release a backpack mod for Fusion Core usage or even ammo weight reduction. Or even a new CAMP item for free, like the brewing station.
---
yeah i call them snaky bois and i hate them, they sneak up on you as your camera is eye level, i died last night after surviving the whole clubhouse solo, but then a snaky boi killed me as i didnt even see it creep up on me
---
I’ve put out about 8k damage with a bloodied powerfist. Probably the best damage output in game ofc you have to be 20% hp tho
---
Yes this. Just yesterday a player showed up, stood by the fire for the entire “work” part of the event, then power-fisted the legendary with a one-shot kill. 
---
Neither me nor the other 4 players even got a hit on it....guess the Legendary wasn’t the only thing power-fisted 😂
---
also make sure there are plenty of these makeshift grenades made from old baseballs in this high tech unmanned cargo drone
---
Ah shit, right, the damn bucket list. The lighthouse by vault 76 usually pulls up nicely just server hop lol
---
BTW mr handy should also be able to collect up to 10 pounds of resources in your base. The carriable space can be different, but should be logical. You should also be able to program some priorities for mr hand, to collect your favourite resource ( purified water ) ( or fruits ) first. ( this should be controlled throw a connected terminal to your base bot_maker machine.)
---
Yeah it could be an issue with that fountain, it is ridiculously big. You built a town I am sure you can come up with something snazzy.
---
Yeah I'm at one of the rings that is only just within range of thr ground!
---
this reminds me of that little utopia settlement in FO4
---
Although I do generally agree with this, I somewhat fall into this category. Most of my camp is 'floating' but I have about 14ish columns supporting all the sides and corners. I dont know if it would actually stand in real life, but I feel like it could. Otherwise I have a campsite below it with some water purifiers and an acid extractor. Plus my vending is below it.
---
Solid video, but one piece of advice: you should do a bit of research on pricing before calling people extortionary. You scrolled too quickly on most to see what the second and third effects were, but 5000 caps for a 3 star bloodied gatling laser is perfectly reasonable if it has awesome secondary effects.
---
I believe my words were:
---
"Lmao "muh roads""
---
Also your ideas as presented are not big or new. In fact they are so often repeated that they are platitudes.
---
Yes I looked at your profile to see if you had other, more sensible posts (than your plebeian criticisms of my Capitalism needs fixing rant).  
---
The slow load times and "sliding Ghoul" are driving me nuts recently, but that's not even the worst of it - the worst problem was enemies being able to attack me before I could even see them!!!
---
They could even add a "roguelike" dungeon, add a few more types of enemies, and make it "100 levels" deep - so it would take people days, or weeks to get to the bottom to get some kind of reward - one that they would lose, if they tried to simply "fast travel" out of the dungeon with it, no, they have to slog back up and fight their way back out with their new shining Legendary thingamabob.
---
"we were told cosmetic only"   clearly they have changed their minds on that score at least in the instance of repair kits.  We may see more QOL items in the future.
---
I was thinking about using bloodied but I'm not sure, just how fragile does it make you?
---
This is absolutely fantastic. Thank you OP! I've been trying to find tameable creatures. This will help so much.
---
Not to my knowledge. I've never had a star removed from anything that I know of.
---
i could have sworn gladiator only counted for 1 armed melee weapons (swords, etc. ), not unarmed weapons
---
I guess, if we are looking for a companion, a living one is better.
---
You know, I've always said that the thing missing from most discussions is purposeful obtuseness and moronic pedantry.
---
My pleasure, good luck and make sure you have plenty of CAMP budget open first!
---
My sneak melee build is almost unfair I tested my stealthed out fury swing speed  combat knife againts a Mirelurk Queen and 3 kings 3.5 x dmg and power attack the queen and she was 2 shots and each king was about 3 shots, fury on a swing speed combat knife is the real deal .  I have a fire axe that is fury and extra power attack I use soley on the sorchbeast Queen with good results I wish they could display dmg values like d3 or better yet give you dmg percent vlaues at the end of a boss but it does seem pretty effective
---
One million caps.....hahahahaha.
---
The repair kits are not pay to win.  Any game with tradeable items can become pay to win because eBay.

The repair kits are awful for 2 reasons:  first, Bethesda said cosmetics only.  With cosmetics, I do not care how much free Atoms you give or don't give, how much you charge for paints, whatever.  I can live without cosmetics, but find it nice I've been able to get things entirely with I game rewards.  
---
The second, and most important, is the repair kits now taint all game decisions around condition rates, repair, and relevant perks.  White Knight got nerfed:  was it for balance and design, or because repair kits are coming?  Balance out lasers by increasing their durability but make their repair components more rare to obtain?  Why, did the Atom shop not hit revenue last month? 
---
Repair kits turn balance and game design questions into revenue questions, and accountants make bad game designers.  Sell power armor paint for 50 real world dollars all you want, but a 25 cent repair kit will always arouse suspicion.
---
Will do. Had a Mirelurk King before that was fanastic. He vanished a few days ago :/
---
Thanks for the suggestion, man. That open spot in the middle is exactly where players spawn in at however. Or did you mean remove the foundation they're attached to and move them closer to the Smith shop? I could see that. I kinda wanted the town to be "surrounding" the players spawn so it felt more... Developed when they first see it
---
For the cargobot picture, I recommend doing the collision course quest at morgentown airport.  When it comes close to landing you can get a pic of it.
---
I had a flamingo in front of a foundation that was driving me crazy. I'd been contemplating storing everything, but really didn't want the hassle of redecorating. 
---
I spent a good three minutes last night standing in front of it abd attempting to select it. I got it! It's finally gone! I never would have thought I could have selected it after months of failing. So, so glad.
---
I also had a nightmare involving a Sheepsquatch Plushie. I live under the bridge at Top of the World. I decided to place a Plushie underneath the bridge, on the concrete foundation. Bad, bad move. The Plushie glitched into the bridge just underneath the sleepers. Absolute slag to get close enough to select that. Never again.
---
My 2 cents, say I’m not sure. Since you can buy weapon repair kits, it kinda is pay to win. However, since we earn atoms, but can buy them too, it is free. I think getting rid of them and having the players repair their weapons just like when ‘76 came out.
---
The RNG Mechanic isn't supposed to be challenging. I don't know any games that made their rng in any way fun or cookie cutted to something special every player can get something out of it by just playing the game \*\~"-casually-"\~\*. Its as simple as it sounds a motivation keeper. Games where RNG is the main mechanic in most of the Design are only played because of the aspect of getting better than other players.
---
Right now Endgame in F76 exists only in 4 categories.
---
Rng Godroll Grinding, Atom farming through challenges and Events, Socializing and Base Building. Most People, many call them Casuals, are happy with that and can enjoy this content for ever. Thats because all this content is made exactly for them and every one of them is able to generate huge fun out of it. If you are complaining about how hard challenges are right now and how hard some event are (which makes you btw Casual) then you should thank the "Other ones" that cried for harder and more challenging End game content. Harder Rng Rolls, Harder Atom Challenges, Harder Events, Less Communication, absolutely no possibility to interact with other Peoples Bases and so on and so on.
---
Truly sorry for your loss... how was the noise, though? lol
---
High capacity backpack does -60 ER and rad resist. Not DR. Also power armour is not the best armour in game and Bethesda realized that so they gave us a way to match our carry weight when not in PA.
---
I’m very excitedly curious about what they’re going to do. Is it just NPCs? No more scorched? Another reply makes a good point about what that does for people who haven’t played yet. Will that content be gone forever? I imagine they will keep scorched and add to other areas. I’m really excited for E3.
---
Good to know! Thanks! Now I’m disappointed that I didn’t purchase Carnivore when someone was selling it for 250 caps.
---
Yeah I thought so too, but I equiped my bladed knuckles and my damage at level 12 or so goes from 22 no cards, 27 with Iron fist rank 3 and then 32 with Iron Fist rank 3 and Gladiator rank 3
---
Wow man this pictures are incerdybe😎 my bes pic was made in a fight vs the  falatwood monster and ther arent as god(yes i dont mean good i mean god ) as my pls keep on doing thes thinks they are realy .... And this is how we the Community of The fo games woud rebuild oure world 💪
---
Did you buy bulk screw then scrap them to loose screws?
---
They're pay to win when in pvp, my BE laser rifle breaks quickly and that's the only thing keeping it in check, I can pop a kit and keep mowing people down, they're pay to win when the dude using a bloodied explosive dragon is spamming it and repairing with kits, or how about when someone's sentinel assassin armor breaks? And they just pop a kit and are tanking again. 
---
These aren't extreme issues, and people teleport around to go repair etc, but it is undeniable, a tactical advantage, even if one that the average player won't be able to abuse.
---
Mmm... Covenant? Thanks! One of my favorites
---
Yes, but, in a sense they are new when thinking about them in the scale of time it takes for governments and economic systems to evolve - only recently are these ideas starting to be accepted in circles of "common people" and discussed in books by Nobel winning economists.
---
Most people I talk to have started to feel concern about "The robots, stealing our jobs" but they hadn't considered: when society experiences massive innovation which could empower us to be more productive, to have less need for humans to do repetitive, boring, or dangerous tasks it should ***lift society as a whole*** not be primarily a tool to exacerbate income inequality and make the masses poor because they are "no longer needed for labor".  
---
You can rationalize all you want, it does not take away the truth of what I said.
---
Okay
---
Bought bulk, transferred to stash, they disappeared and didn’t appear as loose screws
---
Awesome, cool username there bud just don't go walking near my shed where my aluminum bat is or there could be some fuckery. And look out for them shithawks
---
I could never write this

 Bethesda Support posted this on May-15-2019: [https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44432/\~/why-did-i-receive-a-different-bag-than-expected-with-the-fallout-76-power-armor](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=rp7fEObzGzj1mzo_0tt2NdKxvcp8MTU1OTg1MzM0MUAxNTU5NzY2OTQx&amp;stzid=Ugz2RejiVucqQqRRdql4AaABAg&amp;event=comments&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.bethesda.net%2Fapp%2Fanswers%2Fdetail%2Fa_id%2F44432%2F%7E%2Fwhy-did-i-receive-a-different-bag-than-expected-with-the-fallout-76-power-armor)  .  It says, "We are finalizing manufacturing plans for replacement  canvas bags for the Fallout 76: Power Armor Edition. If you purchased  the Collector's Edition and completed the Power Armor Edition Bag  Replacement Form' by May 3rd, 2019 please be patient as we work on getting the replacements ready for shipment."  This is the same wording  they used months ago except they updated the date to May 3rd 2019.  They were finalizing it months ago, and they are still "finalizing" it now.
---
No, what we need is less asshat team-baiting dickbags in the game that make players leery of multiplayer.
---
If you can figure THAT out... we're golden.
---
I die a fair amount tbh. But there are many perks and such that you can use to negate damage.
---
I’m all in for new weapons. I miss the anti-material rifle from new vegas. Slow to load, but,  BAM, no more deathclaw!!!!
---
Yeah, it's frustrating, if you're patient with certain objects and move centimeter by centimeter, you might eventually get a hitbox to edit the object, but most of the time I just give up before then. I can't be bothered spending 3-4 hours re-doing my camp, because of a few stubborn objects lol
---
even though you said you do not want mutations here is the best setup i can think of for an unarmed melee build
---

---
Thanks, man. I might make this a regular thing. I'm definitely gonna be working on a "town vibe building guide" video so we'll all be learning as we go along
---
People don’t seem to want to counter. Sometimes they might realize the two sides are too far off to reach a happy compromise and sometimes they just don’t get how negotiation works.
---
yeah, i think thats the one looks good!
---
If I'm not mistaken, they had this challenge before and the human-like creature was an alien/flatwoods monster.
---
I would love the camera more if I could take more than 50 photos on XBox
---
Super mutant worked for me using the gutter
---
In project paradise, my laser rifle (BE) broke mid boss killing, and I had no other weapons on me. Nobody else was making a dent. I had time to go into the atom shop, buy a repair kit, open my pip boy, repair my weapon, and return to the fight in a second. The boss was then mowed down.
---
We would have failed the event were it not for the clutch repair kit.
---
I haven't had penetration multi kills in this game but I have had multi kills from a two shot rifle. I killed two low level ghouls with "one" shot from a two shot combat rifle.
---
no you can continue to earn points past 50 -- after 50 the choice is add a perk point or move a point.
---
It's easy to stealth first, or jump up somewhere if in a PvE setting.
---
I'm not even gonna try to read that
---
You get 50 points, and no single special can be over 15 :)
---
No need. Just a Super Mutant appreciation post.
---
Lol not too bad! I had a tent camp south of Lake Eloise (I think that's the name). So not many enemies at all. Once I moved near Whitesprings for vending, he didn't last much longer.
---
I usually screenshot the photos I wanna keep but don’t really need as loading screens. Delete them from fo76 but I’ve still got em saved on Xbox, ya feel
---
Also dying in this game has zero repercussions.
---
So can i have max 15 in all special or is it moving my points around to better suit my needs?
---
I had a Mirelurk King. Loved him. He was very good at protecting camp.
---
Hydi-ho neighbor!
---
What are your views on mutations? Are Brotherhood role players allowed to have mutation builds like bloodied?
---
Only 50. You cant earn more than that?
---
Its also the amount of killing, if you stay engaged in combat with multiple people, for even a fair amount of time, your weapon will be taking some hits. It shows especially on laser weapons that break fast, or something like a dragon which breaks in like 5 shots.
---
I havent gotten far enough to know. Im level 55.  But the answer I do have is we can still level up perks, or switch perks, after level 50.
---
You on PC? I'm interested.
---
Scorched work just try using diffrent melee weapons. I did it with a bat
---
How are they P2W? There is no "winning" in FO76.
---
It's not like there are promoted esports teams out there raiding each other or endgame content and spammming repair kits gets them to the end first. 
---
I haven't bought any personnaly or used the ones off SBQ yet, but if someone wants to drop their own money in atoms so they can repair and keep playing instead of finding a bench, who cares? Doesn't affect my gameplay one bit. Doesn't affect my loot off the same kill. Doesn't affect my ability to kill the same things they are. Hence not P2W.
---
Totally support this.
---
Everytime I'm getting into my power armor, I am over-encumbered. This makes using a power armor very annoying and it's kinda sad to not being able to use a power armor properly.
---
Basically, I don't have any weight issues without it because I have a high capacity backpack and 5 pieces of armor that are deep pocketed. But maybe most importantly, my armor has legendary effects that reduce weapon, ammo and junk weight by 20%.
---
Power armor hasn't really been adapted to all the new weight management and calibrated shocks isn't enough. Normal PA can already not keep up with removing backpack and deep pocketed. And even the excavator reaches it's limited when considering the legendary effects.
---
And that's only the weight issues which I notice most...
---
I don't believe they do, but you have to become an enclave general in order to launch nukes. The whitespring is the best place to set one off to find nuked Flora and ghouls, just make sure you have a very strong weapon!
---
At 50 you can no longer earn special points. You can only redistribute the ones you have.
---
[O rly?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa_which_enemies_are_affected_by_versus/)
---
 I run BoS Heavy Combat and Dense is very rare indeed. It does show up for other Armours much easier though. I think Wallace, at Harper's Ferry, has Dense for Marine sometimes.
---
I've had it twice turn up and say nothing.....
---
It is actually 49. You start with all 1's and get to add 1 additional special point everytime you level from 2 to 50 (which is 49 times). Starting with level 51, you will get the choice to pick an additional perk card or move 1 point from one special to another, so for example you could reduce your Endurance by 1 to increase your Luck by 1.
---
It's also the other way around with people just asking how much you want, and never offering. I'm not going to throw out the opportunity for a biased exchange here. Someone who has alot of caps might be willing to pay far more than the worth of something.
---
It goes both ways, sellers miss an opportunity if they state the settlement off the bat, then there is no negotiation.
---
Yesterday there was 6-7 players and 5 had PA and tesla or TSE's, it flippin' looked like the 4th of July! lol
---
Oh you live near Flatwoods too? Neat! Best spot to farm some Nuka Darks. Thanks for visiting, happy cake day
---
There are only 50 points, quick math will tell you that no, you cannot get a score of 15 in 7 different stats.
---
Sounds like a PvE scenario. NOT PvP. In a PvE scenario, you "pay-to-convenience". There is no winning against anyone else. there is no direct competition. 
---
Unless AI dream of electric sheep...
---
Interesting, the main put-off with mutagens for me is how easy they are to accidently remove. I also notice you didn't include any gladiator perks, are they not worth it?
---
You could have 15 in three but you would be gimping your self by not having enough special points in the other areas for certain cards.
---
You're better off looking into a build that suits your playstyle, then using [Nukes and Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to plan out your build.
---
Deathclaw does not work, I used an axe on a scorch
---
Uhhhh...well you're playing a different game then I am then. The choice is either move a perk point, or add one starting at level 50. There is a choice, every time Ive leveled up since 50.
---
That's easy enough to do on your own in a day, let alone a full week. You're still a dick if you one shot legendaries in a group event.
---
PS4
---
For some reason deathclaw gauntlets don’t work for it, I saw a post that said use a sledgehammer so today I smacked a ghoul with a sledgehammer in survival and it counted, it was one of the ghouls at Ohio river adventures.
---
With that argument, you would remove the vending machines, the personal terminal, and the punch bowl.
---
Do you really want to fight for "cosmetics only"?
---
&gt; I'm not suggesting you fudged the data on your end. It doesn't seem like you use heavy guns, and just weren't familiar with it. It's understandable to a degree.
---
I do use Heavy Guns and have for a very long time. It isn't a matter of not being familiar with _the only barrel available for the weapon_, it's a matter of the topic - as reproduced in the message you're replying to and the OP.
---
In your initial reply you suggested every comparison use a Prime Receiver. :|
---
We started this conversation with some very liberal ideas of what a realistic Heavy Guns build would be from a stance of accessibility (low levels) to end game (high levels). I feel omitting a Heavy Barrel in that spectrum was fair and it seems your experience is that you use Ultracite Ammo for everything..... I don't think we're going to get to a compromise if you feel that not using Ultracite Ammo at all times verifies your Heavy Guns experience. ;)
---
&gt; DPSing down SBQ, Imposter, Alpha Cryptids.
---
This doesn't work the way you think it does and why I referred to this as "Forest from the trees". I've shot Heavy Guns at SBQ since BETA - and you know what doesn't work? Firing Heavy Guns at SBQ. The #1 strategy before and after recent changes is to shoot her with a shotgun or rifle (Enforcer, Tormentor) to cripple her and then focus fire on her head from a good perch.... with a rifle on the skirt of the nuke zone (don't bother firing at her head when she's in the air, of course).
---
&gt; Hell if I know. I also don't use OGA. Shits dead before it gets crippled.
---
You kill SBQ before crippling her? I don't think so. :)
---
OGA was specifically mentioned _for that_. There isn't any reason to use Heavy Guns in PVP since the metas for melee and Rifleman are far more developed and more rewarding for less investment.
---
&gt; If Tank Killer is free, Stabilized is free.
---
It's not. Tank Killer requires nothing. Stabilized requires PA. Stabilized also _costs you the ability to use things like Serendipity because of the PA requirement_. This is a build choice you have to make and is not a choice reflected by things like Tank Killer. There is no substitution for this available in a PA related perk or Heavy Guns related perk - as mentioned, Bullet Shield is near useless and the only thing remotely close.
---
To the point of the last reply, which I'll admit was a bit jumbled, the _rest of the game mechanics_ (forest, tree) are being completely omitted - cripple is extremely important if you want to toss around enemies like SBQ and non-chalantly toss around the idea that the PA user, literally a tank, should discard being a tank (which, without things like serendipity, is probably best) to squeeze as much per-round damage out as possible and that justifies it "outclassing" the rifle - it doesn't. It doesn't at all. It does not exponentially get more magical and turn into insta-kills against flying SBQs and Imposter Sheep Squatch.....
---
If you're looking at this "on paper", as it seems you are, it's pretty obvious there are only niche uses for Heavy Guns and **exactly** what you want to use them on (high DR targets) is exactly what makes them **undesirable**.... high DR targets with a class of weapons that mostly falls apart (another Heavy Gun downside you learn from experience with Heavy Guns) is just a huge waste of ammo materials.
---
Bloodied, Furious, Instigating are all effective with rifles and you will start those engagements at a high per-shot damage which is _more effective_ against high DR targets to punch through armor with a _free_ Tank Killer perk. Bloodied, specifically, allows for some really great high DPS rifle builds that shred high DR targets (ye ol' glass cannon). The mechanics suggest you should hop into PA, slap on 
---
If you're starting a fresh character and aren't going the melee route, I would definitely suggest you get a feel for Rifle builds. Understanding the skill gap of just leaving Tank Killer on, squeezing into a bunch of really nice legendary armors, Serendipity, being able to "one shot one kill" just about anything in PVE _**and**_ PVP.... it's a world of difference.
---
Or just no legendary at all cause they're diseased. Didn't see a proper lengedary at WS last night but walked away with like 12 1* items.
---
99% of my "almost" trades go something like this:
---
I post up a weapon stating I want cap offers.
---
Guy 1: hey how much do you want for that?
---
Me: I don't know my fellow, throw me up an offer
---
*Silence*
---
I can't even join a team because my sound dies in the game. I have no idea why and it's been difficult to google for. Consider others having technical issues before you deny them getting a shot in on a creature.
---
There are other ways to get stuff than from workshops. It’s a part of the game. Don’t like it? Don’t claim them and get your stuff elsewhere.
---
Are, you, ok?
---
It could be done I’m just not sure Bethesda will spend the resources based on Atoms bought. I would love to see it but this isn’t WoW.
---
Yea! Because Broken Steel's DLC was an asshole move too! /s
---
That sounds awesome. Went last year (pre Fallout obsession) and enjoyed ourselves.
---
Taking screenshots really is a unique feature
---
I sincerely hope Bethesda is considering compensating OP for all this hard work helping identify and fix these issues. If there ever was someone deserving, it’s OP.
---
If you want cheese on a burger, it's gonna cost 30¢.
---
SHOOT FIRST!
---
I'm fuckin starving though please guy, get me some food. I got twenty bucks, I'll pay ya.
---
Building my 2nd toon now, got to level 26 from 16 in a few hours yesterday. At this speed I think I’ll be over 50 in the next few days (if I could just play and stop shop around lol). 
---
The key to fast leveling is killing lots of stuff, and there’s no better place than WS for this. Lots of ghouls, scraping material, workbenches within walk distance, etc.
---
I got a level 15 handmade at the purveyor, it’s very efficient as a killing tool. If you put a suppressor on it and use it while sneaking, the damage doubles. Most low level ghouls are one shot dead. But the real boost comes from high level ghouls like 42 and higher. One full WA run will give you one level up and some more. Keep hopping and do the runs you will level up quickly, and pick up legendary loots as you go. I wouldn’t do the events until 50 simply because the rewards will be low level if you do it early.
---
ugh, I absolutely despise the packs of bros I run into (usually lvl 150+) while doing quests solo minding my own business.  The enemies rank up to their level and they do dumbass stunts like wasting ammo shooting at me or following me around the map until they get bored.  I would play much more often if there werent so many of them.
---
I usually look at the map. Since most start at the club, I’ll go the opposite direction. Usually betime I get to the resort, I can get a better spawn.
---
The way it's done in Fallout 76 is indeed a unique feature. Nice try though.
---
i would kill for a super modular AR-15 (Service Rifle) platform rifle that can be switched between various calibers and modifications 
---
**Possible Ammo Types**
---
10mm- swaps out the mag mesh with a double stack stick magazine lower damage but bigger mag size and more abundant ammo? 
---
5.56- the default ammo for it, mid tier damage 
---
.50- (Beowulf) might not make perfect sense as the .50 we have now is .50 BMG but just and idea. But this would have higher damage but maybe a lower mag size to make up for it.
---
.308- makes it into more of a DMR or they could have a seperate weapon for this one to take the place of an AR-10
---
**Sights** - the usual reflex sights, glow/night sights for the irons, higher magnification scopes to make use of the higher damage calibers for use as a DMR.
---
**Barrels and stocks** - shorter barrels and stocks (aka a pistol brace to be specific here) can maybe switch the guns perk usage from rifleman to the pistol perks by making it into an AR Pistol and add some variety to the pistol category.
---
They're great games, but I think they'd show their age if I played them again now. Some of the stuff you can do in them lol. Tactics is mission based, but you can still free roam. I liked it.
---
Most people aren't worried about losing your caps. My floating skybox gets plenty of business 😂
---
Correct, instigating only affects the first shot against a full hp enemy.  IF your automatic weapon was capable of one shotting most enemies, it would be a very valuable legendary attribute to just straight yeet down large groups.
---
If that isn't the case... furious, vampire, anti-armor, bloodied, two-shot are far more useful and valued.
---
Almost every other mmo has the same dickbags and yet players still find ways to cooperate to tackle group content.
---
Why is this one special to the point that it needs to be different?
---
Because buy stuff at the atom store
---
Most are in my stash. I only have like 8 on me right now. There's no limit to how many you can keep in your stash
---
I have it the other way around
---
How about a blue jay burger? I just need some propane.
---
I start at the Club House, because that has the best concentration of ghouls, and if it's being raided, then I server hop. Then I do the houses, then the parking lot/maintenance, then the last few houses that lead me back to the Golf Club.
---
My route is the parking lot and laundry room first then double back to the entrance to start my loop  from there and go north to the houses and all the way around to the golf club area.
---
Little bit of a tangent, but does the VTU tracksuit from the atom store have any lining mods? Looked on the wiki but couldn't find anything.
---
Seems to still be related to high damage/dps output. My quad tesla gets it on a regular basis when attacking a crowd of super mutants or robots. Maybe the massive amount of DR/damage calculations all at once makes the game think you're using some kind of kill all cheat. Hell if I know
---
Wtf dude
---
You get starched genes from luck
---
Yeah, but you do realize that these photo modes are a pretty much established feature?
---
Agree. Whitesprings is great location for getting more traffic. Especially if there are several other camps nearby. But if you're at the station or the box cars nearby, please don't go for fancy. And totally agree with checking spawn point. So sick of spawning inside locked doors or in floors.
---
Ok thanks that makes sense 👍
---
Try the small camp in Flatwoods. I have found 2 of them over there in the footlockers/crates. It's over there by the Red Rocket station
---
first let me say i understand what your trying to say but calling me casual doesn't make my point any less valid. i am complaining because it's tedious. you want harder challenge's or more grindy game play that's your opinion.
---
what you should want is better content vast area's to explore and better community centers like a positive way to enter act with your other players. Like say dungeons that take more than one person to complete.
---
Is the Western Revolver bugged? I noticed that the Prime and Hardened receivers are weaker than the severe receiver.
---
Is this on PvE? I don't think I've ever had that issue. Is it higher lvl people doing it?
---
Never said I got killed
---
Whoops thought its was -60 to dr and er.
---
I go clubhouse, half the bungalows, kill the ones on golf course, other half of the bungalows, then go back to the parking lot/ laundry building.
---
&gt; I feel like I'm not even given a chance to defend myself 
---
What gear are you using?  What level are you?
---
Those 10 caps I was going to spend could have made all the difference in the world! You don't know.
---
Right, I would expect no more SBQ fights; maybe the occasional SB fight or encounter with lingering Scorched, but with the SBQ dead there should be a diminishing number of SBs and thus less Scorched, plus with the vaccine, the plague should be quelled for the most part.  I don't think that would necessarily have to preclude learning about what happened and how things went down; maybe one just wouldn't have to play through it all.
---
WoW's recipe has generally been to bring the player to a whole new zone and leave the old content alone.   
---
 They revamped and brought their original zones forward in time once and in the process tossed most of the original quests, npcs, etc.  It was met with mixed reviews, but if the narrative is to rebuild Appalachia, it seems like retiring some of the old content is the trade-off.
---
I, and pretty sure Aten has mentioned as well, have wondered the same thing. As you said, he's literally provided the solution in a number of instances. So unless there are bigger issues that crop up as a result of the fix where leaving it "broken" but not game-breaking is the better approach... I dunno. However, given he has bug reports submitted on all of these, you'd think they could at least weigh in and say "shit went sideways when applying that fix, we're working on the code to address it" so he can reflect it here on his tracker. :(
---
It's for this reason I often joke that there are only 5 people working on the bugs:  
---
2 coders - One who fixes stuff, and another who doesn't bother to read code comments or look at commits before making his/her own changes, in turn causing more problems.  
---
1 mapper / texture artist - Tasked with addressing issues with buildings, structures, etc looking wrong (ie sitting too high off the ground), or textures with issues  
---
1 modeler / texture artist / animator - Tasked with sorting out modeling goofs, their textures, or animations involving those characters/items.  
---
1 quest maker / scripter - Tasked with any and all issues regarding quests like stages, triggers, items as well as scripted triggers to cause X and Y to happen in response to Z.
---
:P I figure with thousands of bugs to hammer out, and the 3 content creators making new stuff who work 24/7 and constantly make mistakes on items that are being shipped in patches... that's why we don't see as many bug fixes as we would expect.
---
Again, purely in jest, but I *would* love to know how any members are on the Bug Extermination team for FO76... lol
---
Didn’t really realize how much effort went into muties until this post. I’ve heard the specialized lines at WestTek, and many of the others, but it never really struck me until now how different that is from practically all the games other enemies.
---
Same. I've had it happen a few times. Took a run through Whitesprings and got ridiculously good drops. It was lonely AF though.
---
Agreed, I think they'll be in big trouble if they don't bring in human NPCs.
---
&gt; Can't complete challenges because we can't discover areas ALREADY discovered!!
---
I have like 5000 atoms locked behind those issues :(
---
The ability for an A.I. to compete is an entirely different subject. But yes I believe A.I. can compete. 
---
Just reverse the scenario with me shooting a bunch of people, then repairing my weapon.
---
And sometimes yes, you are competing with other players for legendary kills and resources.
---
There could be a leveling change to account for this. For example, at level 35 you unlock the option to fast forward. You can wait until level 60 or so before you have to change, but once you do you can't go back on that character .
---
I really appreciate it!
---
So with perks I could withstand blast zones without PH.
---
If that's the case I will roll with that
---
I've been stumbling across low price serum vendors every other day lately so it shouldn't be too long till you find it again. Actually now that I've shuffled my perks around to make room for level 3 class freak I went and bought Adrenal Reaction, Grounded, and Speed Demon.
---
With Unyeilding Armor, and armor that lowers the weight of weapons Power Armor was never better at carry weight!
---
High agility will help your shotgun reload speed, and the Enforcer card will cripple limbs. Those two effects will improve your close range shotgun performance. When dealing with large groups run backwards in a circle pattern, blasting shots at the crowd’s ankles to cripple them.
---
I did at first too tbh. I was pissed lol but then I realized. It’s still a pretty big trade off. I personally only use it when I need to. The lead lined is really good for killing the SBQ and I run armour plated otherwise
---
Nah, I've been getting ambushed by other players. Its like Im being watch and as soon as they see Im done setting up "their workshop" they swoop in and proceed to one shot me. Im then just out of luck with all the materials Ive used to build the workshop.
---
Even in PvE people can force PvP if you own a workshop and they contest it. Pacifist mode does nothing.
---
This happens to me too, but very rarely. And yes it’s frustrating, especially when it’s a team wearing super hero clothes or whatever lol 
---
You must have very bad luck or are exaggerating. Which workshops do you take regularly?
---
They are just being their true selves. Online games remove the physical distance, schmucks can appear without warning.
---
Why not both? Tbh it comes off as you want god tier weapons for just playing the game like you would fallout 3. Thats not how it will ever work but you can always buy/sell in game or do the weekly survival challenge for even more guaranteed weapons.
---
I bought mine from enclave bunker.  Can you find the plans from somewhere else?
---
Also your vendors are emptied if you stay. That's a bug but I believe it's because the vendors get "scanned" and saved server side when you log in. Since they didn't load in, the inventory gets wiped
---
Do you realize that the way 76 does it has been different from any photomode I've ever used in a game? That'a the point. Other games "miss the mark" with their photo functions. While games like Uncharted, God of War, The Witcher, Forza, The Division 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. Offer a photomode, it's nothing compared to how 76 implements it as a feature.
---
I had a group doing one violent night with me the other day. 3* pops up and they all tag it and once they all got it one of them melted it before I could tag it.
---
Okay.......2 minutes later another 3* popped up......so I melted it before anyone else could tag it and then listened to the group whine about killing 3* before everyone could tag it. Ohhh.....the irony.
---
After that everyone played nicely and didn't melt 3* anymore.
---
I have. Anytime there’s a Sheepsquatch event, I drop what I’m doing to join because they’re usually fun as a good chunk of the server turns out. 
---
I die A LOT because I’m always putting myself out there, doing the objective. And people usually leave my shit alone when I die and can’t get revived. It’s kind of an unsung rule. But the past few times- a few low levels will wait and hide while others do all the work and then pop in at the last second for the XP. They won’t revive others, and lately will take people’s junk they’ve collected if they die. 
---
I died due a stray eyebot blowing up in my face and couldn’t be revived, and I see level 12 run over to my corpse and take all the junk I collected from killing robots during that event. 
---
Some other guy called him out for it and saying it’s not proper event etiquette but they just ran off. I lost a ton of lead scrap because of it. 
---
Made me seriously consider putting a bounty on my head to get back at them.
---
What’s the tourist corpse
---
I would much prefer the main antagonists be Super Mutants rather than Scorched.
---
There are no plans for them. Unless something changed with the last patch.
---
There are some massive assumptions being made here about how many people agree with you and about how correct you are.
---
Also luddite is a largely derogatory term that firmly applies to the "the robots are stealing muh jobs" crowd.
---
P2W isn't just for PvP mechanics, as I posted elsewhere, it's just a phrase.  'Win' means getting a tactical advantage over other players, not just against other players.
---
A lot of the most egregious P2W titles aren't PvP at all, but they're still letting you pay cash to advance instead of playing the game.
---
Most people will agree that this implementation isn't a very blatant P2W, but it is troubling after the whole 'cosmetics' statements from before.  IMO, if they stop it there, I couldn't care less, it's not worth bitching about.  If they push on though, that's a different story.
---
Well, now I know why the game occasionally crashes to desktop....
---
But seriously, keep up the dark work. Your posts are always incredible.
---
I somewhat understand your plight. The PvP in this game is horrendous, but at the same time, you should know that Workshops are meant to be PvP content.
---
There are no plans for them, unless something changed in the last patch.
---
Im lvl 71 with mainly my combat shot guy that does roughly 100 damage and a Tesla rifle that does about the same. Always wear lvl 50 power armor X0-1 or Excavator.
---
If you're in vats the harpoons will have a greater spread. I you manually shoot you will hit with more harpoons. My favorite gun
---
A cool cutscene showing the demise of the SBQ with the narrator talking about how the Vault 76 dwellers overcame all the odds and saved the world from a second apocalypse in the scorch plague.  
---
Now, with the nukes secured, the residents of Vault 76 look outward to the rest of the US.  Will we follow the mandate of Vault Tech and use our power to rebuild the US? Or will we use the nukes to bully neighboring areas into submission?
---
Saving this so I can drop by after work tonight.
---
Those are all given to us for free...?
---
Ah memories of the amazing yet insane creation kit. 
---
Yes it does seem like a lot of the issues are related to borked keywords and it’s infuriating that they aren’t doing QOL patches in the downtime to get rid of this aptly names “low hanging fruit”.
---
Of all places, I found one last night at a desk upstairs in the frat house in Morgantown. The frat house with the Brew station research, etc. in the basement? Don't know the issue number. Grants -15 damage from robots. You'll also find grape, orange, and quantum cola in the bedroom in the basement.
---
i was talking about the freaking tourist that spawns to start the quest for the camera. i didn't say i wanted god tier weapons but if were going there. I would like the reroll system in this game to at least give me the option of rolling for a weapon type like say 2 handed melee or heavy weapon etc...
---
Oo, didn't think of that.
---
&gt; Someone who has alot of caps might be willing to pay far more than the worth of something.
---
Truth!
---
If I want it, I don't care if I "over pay" for it.  Caps are funny money anyway.  :)
---
I think Im having bad luck too haha its only happened to me at Munitions once (but I can almost understand because its a highly sought after workshop) but every other time Ive been farming aluminum or copper.
---
I swear enclave bunker has them
---
Counter clockwise?  That’s a commie litmus test!
---
I don't!
---
Of course, I for one use the Bloodied build my self aha. However as far as using our RP channels we refrain from mentioning/using mutations like saying stuff like “so and so uses their marsupial mutation and leaps over a building” but when we play in game mutations are allowed 👍
---
This
---
Hence the "these are not p2w but they are a slippery slope"
---
I agree, it's borderline but by technicality, (see my name) it just isn't.
---
I know this but most of the people I come across in PvE are there because they don't want to PvP.
---
But what happens if someone tries to take your workshop and your in pacifist mode? PvP cant happen so who gets the workshop?
---
Why would you leave whitesprings with rad worms? Last stop should always be the gazebo, no?
---
It always baffles me when people ask for solo content in multiplayer games.
---
I’ve heard there is sometimes a bug that won’t let you one-shot enemies.
---
Does the Pulaski elevator work without the veil? That might be a way in.
---
Just go to penitentiary and hit up inside then outside....rinse and repeat
---
Fuck think I killed them everytime. Will stop to listen next time.
---
Yeah, I've never seen my area nuked, down by Twin Lakes
---
GT aGraciousGod
---
Listen jackass. Knowing the value if something has nothing to do with fucking welfare. I have like 10 of these fucking suits and even if I had to go do the 5 minute quest ever day for 2 weeks that would still be better than paying that amount per token. You have no argument what so ever. People having fair prices doesnt ruin the economy either, it just stops people like you from scamming others
---
My explosive Tesla does sort of fire bullets. Do you get the lightning on yours?
---
&gt; in pacifist mode? PvP cant happen 
---
PvP can absolutely happen in Pacifist mode.  But the person in Pacifist mode *can't deal damage to anyone else*.
---
Uncle festers Quest ----------- yeah real selective
---
Non automatic Leaver Action Rifle with it, you usually don’t need second shot :)
---
To save your stash space. #SaveYheStash
---
Each mod weighs roughly 1 lbs, so in modding a weapon you will weigh about 5 pounds more.
---
And of course this is just a theory.
---
Funny enough had something similar happen to me a few days ago with one dude straight up one shotting me with Tesla rifle another emptying about 2 clips of a Tsw gun. 1st one was while I was fixing up workshop the other while I was cooking food.
---
Really I just sever hopped n haven't really had much issue since. But that's kinda to be expected in this game you claim a workshop it tells ya others can engage you in PVP.
---
Really there's not much I can suggest aside from server hopping. As fighting fire with fire means either shelling out real coin or getting lucky. Even then you'd have to be on your toes n expecting every one ready to challenge you for the workshop.
---
That happens to me about 25% of the time when holding a workshop. When I set one up to farm what I have to farm, I just hope the odds are in my favor, because if it’s taken away from me I might go and take it back, but HE’S just going to come back too. Never ending pointless cycle.
---
They're particularly useless at high-level. I usually call one in whenever I'm in the neighborhood of a Relay Tower, more for the hunt, but the loot is always absolutely a disappointment.
---
I'm not against technology, I'm against it being used badly and horded by the wealthy as a tool to exacerbate the problem of income inequality. 
---
If you read my comments you would have seen I'm actually in favor of advancing technology faster, against the wishes of big corporations that are trying to stifle it and stop competition from endangering their comfortable profits.
---
Im aware that workshops are PvP, my issue is getting one shot and killed instantlly within a few minutes of crafting everything needed and other people taking it without me being able to defend myself at all. That reminds me, why dont machine gun turrets harm the player trying to take the workshop? haha
---
I am referring to the last few weeks actually.
---
I still haven't received credit for killing the SBQ 😄 Darn killing blow...
---
Which one does more damage?
---
Plans???? No. Again, unless they changed something that I don’t know about.
---
0 caps in my vending machine - along with most basic recipes and materials that I don't need.
---
Useless to me, possibly useful to somebody else.  :)
---
I rely on stealth generally
---
Leg it when shit hits the fan, stealth with that one that makes enemies lose you/running doesn’t effect stealth
---
Tends to be enough
---
Stash your junk often xD
---
As far as I know those plans are unavailable from any source.
---
 Damn nailed. I start at the Station comrade.
---
Your probably not all that far off about the ‘live’ team (who would work in the shadow behind the major updates / patch team)
---
Hmmm, then maybe just the armor pieces then...i havent played this week
---
 Ahhhh gottcha. I've never messed around in pacifist mode. Thats good to know!
---
Electrified. And it looks cooler too. If you’re on PS4 I can make you both, buy one get one free
---
sell crack
---
It might be a server lag issue. I've had that happen too...an explanation given to me by someone smarter pointed to that. So, it's not necessarily you...I'd blame the internet.
---
It's a hp bug. They fixed it initially but it kinda came back from one of the patches. It doesn't happen as often as it did though back in let's say January or before that.
---
On which platform are they allowing this change?
---
hmm.. thats a well thought answer. You gave me something to. think about. Thanks for your time!
---
Better dead then red!
---
Station then counterclockwise...
---
maybe the legendaries you killed and you didnt get a legendary finally loaded and you got reinbursted.
---
Had same thing last week. Never seen an actual legendary mob but was picking up a legendary of every 3rd mob it was crazy lol
---
To be fair... Survival isn't necessarily "PvP mode" it's a survival/hardcore mode. These pvp mechanics are design for both adventure and survival.
---
[](/ajsilly)Nah, you're still addicted, just checked by popping a chem I'm addicted to that doesn't boost damage. Didn't lose any damage. Chem up friend there's nothing to lose.
---
I always just switch tabes to what I'm looking for. Makes it easy to only look at plans, junk, weapons, etc
---
Why go through all this bullshit when Bethesda could just incorporate elements of Automatron into the game? I think you guys just enjoy writing up these huge essays to get a bit of attention for yourselves.
---
When the leaderboards were based on player kills it was better for sure. It gave the murderhobos something to chase after and let the folks who enjoy the risk of Survival mode but didn’t want to just murder everyone a chance to play without constantly being hunted. Basically there was more balance between playing the game and partipating in PvP and it made moments where you got a few player kills defending yourself and found yourself on the leaderboard much more enjoyable. That was my experience at least.
---
I haven’t been on survival much since the recent change, in part because of what I just described but also because I stopped finding friendlies.
---
Yep that’s likely the reason why OP got so lucky. I tried this many times by dying repeatedly to the same legendary and it worked only once. It’s not a guaranteed multiple drop but can happen.
---
What a deal, my PSN is Thriatus , I’ll be on in about an hour or so.
---
PvP happens, you die because you can't hurt them.
---
Then you miss out on my deals.
---
Twisted Muscles is 25%+ Melee and a Glowing Meat Steak adds another 10%.
---
It's how Fallout has been forever, so it feels more natural for me.
---
I  run with the exact same build and gun, have had the same thing occur if I am shooting at   something at a longer distance.
---
To be fair - I dont mind PvP, its the constant one shot kill thats annoying me haha
---
Ofc. I think it's a good way to allow the communities of other consoles to intersect if someone on Xbox sees the video of someone's camp from the ps4 then maybe they will leave a nice comment or get inspired to build in a different way. It's just a fun series I'd love to see bloom into something massive but even a small victory like getting good views on it is awesome.
---
Yeah my rolling pin didn't work either went with a switch blade instead ha
---
Tageeboy......we've gotta cook!!
---
antiarmor and bloodied. I have both
---
do you need a town drunk?
---
Good to know, does Twisted Muscles have a debuff?
---
I am on PS4! My camp is near the southern watch tower, but I FT to a camp on the train tracks south of the power plant near WS to check out vending. One fell there I think, and the other fell inside the resort area itself.
---
I think they sell the mods but I haven’t checked to confirm
---
Aren't magazine spawns all random now?
---
XBox GT Profshade2
---
I have been there. Was semi afk farming fusion cores just to glance at my screen in time to see my workshop being contested and getting nearly instantly killed by an explosive shotgun seconds after getting notified... And yes the defenses/traps are mostly useless and should be significantly buffed. I would rather them be overpowered than underpowered.
---
Don't let them see you at the workshop. Before you take it, find some hidey hole, and never leave crouch.
---
Or, find someone else who likes defending them, join up, and never leave crouch.
---
Or, try finding a team to run several, and never leave crouch.
---
Never leave crouch.
---
I get where you are coming from but when I'm talking about the price the primary criticism is not if the weapons is awesome or not but if your standard player could afford it.  Sure it's awesome but could your average joe afford it....probably not. Now atm I'm trying to learn more about the effects that legendary weapons have and how they work but it's more of "how if effects the players" not "this weapons is awesome". Thanks for the criticism though, every little helps.
---
I don't like them either, but I paid the fast travel caps and I need to know if they have a legendary I want.
---
What I hate is when the vending machines are not in an easily accessible place, I don't want to search all over the 3rd floor for them.
---
p2w or not, as a private commercial company, they can add to the game whatever they consider profitable in order to pay those 300 salaries every month.
---
What they can't do is to make contradictory and shady statements.
---
Why never leave crouch? lol
---
Honestly, I think half of the fun is finding a way to rebuild your CAMP to fit into the new locale. I'd get bored of using the same design and just plopping it down.
---
u/VooDooBarBarian  
---
I'm a SysAdmin by trade, so totally understand, like I said, sometimes the fix would take 60 second total, but the approval process alone can take forever.    
---
I agree, I've personally submitted enough Tickets on '76 Bethesda called my phone and started a conversation trying to figure out if I was trolling or not (Tier 1 can't read and understand the reports)  
---
The problem is, even when we give them EXACTLY whats wrong and how to fix it, it can take months for them to get it in the queue, I've offered to give them Override ESP's and generally I've been met with a "It's more complicated than that" which is a snow job.  
---
Fixing MA keywords is not complicated, nor does it have wide ranging consequences.   
---
But at the same time, we have to remember these are people who have gone to school for this, and like any professional, they won't want the weekend mechanic to swoop in and point out and fix all the flaws.
---
Soooooo true
---
They can see you on the map. As long as your crouched, they have to find you the hard way, as you're not visivle on the map. It also prevents VATS crits, since they're unable to target you.
---
Nah bro get ready for Battle Royale 😔😔😔😢
---
Too late now. That server is gone but if you ever find him grab the broken camera off of him. Itll give you aquest to get a real camera that is used for challenges
---
I use a bloody explosive 50 cal sniper with the armor piercing magazine it works great in pvp
---
Could it be that the final opponent had looted other enemies?
---
I can craft Polished on metal armor, was there a limb specifically you are having issues with?
---
Thanks for popping in!
---
Now look out the window, see me waving?
---
🙄
---
Come on, I'm not stalking you, whatever, goodbye.
---
It just amazes me because I've played over 500 hours and the only TSE I've obtained was an Assault Rifle out of a player vending machine. It's fun to use but kind of a novelty...it's not as destructive as I had expected it would be.
---
You can use perks clothing, aid items, and weapons to "max out" or increase special points. For instance, my characters Strength is at 32 currently.
---
They will most likely not allow us to use our own gear judging by the leaks. So likely will be marginally more balanced.
---
Where's OSHA when you need them?
---
ah yes, when your position is compromised, that is the time to hurl insults.  bravo!
---
The most common example is Candy Crush and paying for lives. Even that isn't direct competition. This is also called pay to play because of the steep wall that comes in the later stages of the game which almost leans entirely on players paying to advance.
---
Fallout 76 is no where near this.
---
I'm the sheriff... And the drunk!
---
What guns beside your own would you want to have in any PvP? Fingers crossed Nuclear Winter isnt atrocious..🙌
---
Pretty much. Should have worded it differently. No need to worry about having enough screws if you got a couple kits
---
Yeah I have been expecting similar issues as well, might be a new bug?
---
So you may be one of the ones I see going the “wrong way” lol. I feel like the spawns are easier to sneak going the other way but that la my MO.
---
Right. If we're fighting semantix, those need to be removed because they're not cosmetic.
---
To counterpoint, maybe a quest should unlock those items?
---
Exactly
---
Camp door locking = really dumb. I’ve found out those who lock their camp doors often sell garbage at absurd prices too.
---
Always hardened in my case I prefer a one shot kill instead of 2 but lately have been experimenting with different receivers
---
I always find t45 there. Perhaps it is level dependent?
---
Actually, I would love if this game was more hard scifi and less fantasy.
---
I would bet that most of the people that don't like floating houses for breaking the laws of physics would rather not have magic weapons and armor, healing people with flamethrowers perks etc either.
---
No, I dont get the blue streams with it. I do still get the blue piles of ash from dead enemies
---
Started playing again two days ago after some break so I'm probably a bit late.
---
I'm having a graphical issue. The visuals for the ground (gravel,dirt etc) is not in allignment with the actual ground as an object you can stand on. Looks like the base visuals of the ground shifted about 2 meters. Visuals from objects like little rocks, streets, plants, water etc. stay where they should be. This issue leads to me sometimes being able to look under the ground/inside cellars from above, floating objects, piles of dirt inside houses. It's a permanent issue and reloading/changing map doesn't help.
---
Make sure you have serendipity maxed out. Its a must for bloodied builds. I run max barbarian for that sweet damage resistance. Also if you pvp i would max out fireproof and adamantium skeleton.
---
PC
---
 I FLOOP THE PIG!
---
So stifling the economy and stopping competition are direct results of placing artificial caps on things. There is no functional difference between a cap on how much you can earn and a "big corporation" manipulating a government to cap out the competition because the end result (stifled competition) is the same.
---
I am all for advancing technology, but you will never stop larger companies (even in a state run endeavor) from gobbling up smaller start ups. 
---
Really people become wealthy then they stop hoarding tech and make it available to the market. 
---
I think your word view is a little skewed here but I think your heart is in the right place. An example of hoarded tech preventing financial gain would be SLA printing technology. It was patent protected and more or less totally stagnant for decades only to become a booming business for everyone else when it dropped. 
---
Those big wealthy companies shot themselves in the foot by holding the reigns too tight, but it didn't make them richer for it. 
---
Really man it sounds like your real beef should be with the patent office, which is a terrible artificial cap on what can be done with an idea in a market.
---
oops, PC.
---
Maybe this is from the oil rig out west?
---
I've never had my vending machines empty
---
Well currently on the hunt for instigating weapons I seem to do well with those and my sniper build.. so currently my weapon and effect I’m looking for is a hunting rifle instigating
---
I've come across a pile of super mutant corpses, with just 1 "level 1" injured mutant nearby. He is in shock and runs away, muttering stuff about the Sheepsquash. Totally unexpected, but hey, free loot!
---
I don't think you are but its still pretty strange.
---
Clothes_Tattered "Tattered Rags" [ARMO:0011609B]?    
---
Thought it was an Outfit, set up to use Slot 57   
---
Does the Armor clip through, does it remove the armor?
---
They are... but it takes time
---
If you pvp at least run assassins armor. If not then bolstering would work. Unyielding will give you crazy damage output. If you ran unyielding cavalier it would be perfect for a melee build.
---
Use a stealth boy after taking the workshop, go hide, crouch and wait to see if another player comes. Some people hide and crouch until they are very close to you, then they start claiming the workshop and shoot you from the back, don't need a god tier weapon to do that.  Don't use Excavator when taking a workshop, that thing is very weak.
---
Your choice is to either move a perk point or pick a perk card. If you pick the perk card it doesn’t add any more points. You just get the card.
---
"Pussydestroyer#9 wave emotes"
---
No no, thank *you*!
---
Aside from Project Paradise, Encryptid, and the Queen(although it can be done Solo), you can reach and complete whatever you wanna call Endgame in Fallout 76 by yourself, all the way up to a Nuke Silo. Silos are actually much Easier solo because of less enemies. Just bring your 3 Hackers, a Troubleshooter weapon and take care of your mainframe cores before you go down there and I run em in like 20 minutes. Im sure others are faster tho. 76 can totally be a solo game!! Been playing since beta, lvl 162 and the only missions that require more than 1 person literally notify the entire server to come join in.
---
I read your ramblings and appreciate this post, nice comparisons and gg for posting the builds. 
---
Looking forward to the discussion as I'm still playing two toons, non-PA Gunslinger (there'll be some love eventually, yeah?) and PA Gunner.
---
Exactly the place for it.  
---
It has the Casual UnderArmor MA Keywords, so it should be upgraded through that path
---
There’s an amazing post somewhere detailing the various weapon effects, maybe someone has it saved. From memory I think it is a 5% increase, up to 30% cap??
---
I use rank 1 in pvp i usually share it. Seems to be worth it to me.
---
It's how ~~Fallout has~~ I have been forever, so it feels more natural for me.
---
I dont think you are being one shot Bethesda confirmed thisncant happen anymore and there are tons of videos on YouTube showing people getting shot with 2k+ damage weapons and not dying.
---
That seems to be a popular effect nowadays. Are you on PC?
---
The giant flying creature, only if the wing to body mass ratio was way different.
---
Yeah, instigating is better for melee, especially gauntlets and power fists. Furious better for most guns except black powder.
---
No m8 on ps4
---
Mind tossing this on the Weapons Roundup?   
---
Link is at the Bottom, with the number of Bugs I'm tracking it's easier for me that way.
---
&gt;why dont machine gun turrets harm the player trying to take the workshop?
---
This is what's really infuriating.  The person contesting the workshop should be at a severe disadvantage if the owner has invested in defenses.  And that's completely realistic.  There's no reason a fortified location would be easy to take in real life.
---
That’s the risk we take when messing around with workshops
---
Very valid point. If I'm in a quest or event, I usually wait until everyone gets a hit on the boss before I swoop in, because I don't really need much in terms of gear.
---
TBH, I have had a similar issue, but in reverse. I normally 1-shot everything, sometimes even the Sheepsquatch in Free Range. For example, I will walk the cows solo to the farm by myself, and then go in for the kill on the Sheepsquatch, thinking I'm solo. I kill it, but either during or after the kill, I see a hail of bullets flying my way at me and Sheepie. Then I get griefed for not sharing. 
---
I will always accept a team invite if I'm in a quest and someone else is working for it too, because I don't expect everyone to be at my same kill capabilities. But please don't expect to Arya Stark my kill out from under me, because I do around 6k-8k damage per hit with a 3* God Roll Meat Hook.
---
I am ALL ABOUT helping others, or letting them get involved in the quests/events, thus qualifying them for a reward. I don't have anything to prove. But if you are late to the show, hide behind a tree, and try and get a shot in at the end just to get a reward for doing virtually nothing, then be prepared for disappointment.
---
I agree with the sentiment but the camera should he waaaaay easier to get.
---
Aww man. Bethesda needs to cross platform. That's the biggest barrier.
---
Oh buddy if I was live streaming would I have a clip for you. Bethesda can say what they want, but it’s happened to me 4 times.
---
The one green that always has 3 ghouls had a camp constantly killing them...I didn't by anything, triggered all his traps and left him an insult bag.
---
Why would you ever decide to bulk in a workshop instead of anywhere else
---
With Finite Resources do you fix critical issues or spelling errors?    
---
The Redditor with the "Bounty" comment had a good idea!
---
Still wish we could pay to send him at other players.
---
Shoot everything
---
Ye .. when pigs fly probably lol
---
You won't be using V.A.T.S. so pick up dodgy if you've got the agility for it. 
---
Max rank is 30% reduction to damage taken from an attack at the cost of 30 AP. 
---
Bad vs low damage/high RoF attacks, but it stacks with Blocker and renders you damn near unbreakable in melee. Deathclaws and Yao Guai can basically be ignored with that combo. (assuming you maxed out adamantium skeleton...if you haven't that's priority one)
---
im fine with names as is.  its easier to black list people this way
---
I spent the past w hours at the workshop messing around, not a soul showed up until I hit my stash.
---
My contributions that I can think of off-hand...
---
**Endurance applied from Underarmor and Armor does not increase player HP**  
---
As per [my own bug report](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnkvdb/endurance_applied_from_underarmor_does_not/).  
---
Items with any +END will increase Endurance (as shown in the Pip's Stats page), which will reflect in things that rely on it, **except** for Health Points. They, for some reason, remain the same whether that item is equipped, or not.   
---
Chems seem to function, though most of them also indicate directly that they increase health so they may have a "+HP" and "+END" attribute, masking the fact that the added Endurance isn't what's increasing the HP.
---
**Surveyor Outfit displays incorrect inventory item**  
---
Or maybe what's displayed when worn is wrong?   
---
Either way, the item in the inventory looks to be a tightly folded blue jumpsuit, or blue jacket and pants; however, what is displayed when worn is a light brown jacket (with weird metal wire on right arm) and tan (khaki?) cargo pants, as well as a small satchel bag. -- I call this the Indiana Jones outfit.  
---
I came across what clothing item is actually displayed in the model but I can't remember it's name at the moment. Something-Jacket... That item isn't folded the same as Surveyor's is, but it's a dead ringer for it nevertheless!
---
**Scout Armor modifications do not indicate which segment they are for**  
---
You can *literally* have two in your inventory which say "Scout Armor Hardened", which are obviously different since they aren't stacking, but one is for Limbs and the other is for Chest. It's this way for **every** Scout Armor Mod. You have no way of knowing what it is you're buying from the Enclave General's Vendor terminal. 
---
Realistically this is far more reaching than just the Scout Armor. All of the Excavator mods fail to indicate they are for the Excavator PA, and relies on the player to figure out through keen observation that any mod that scraps into Black Titanium is for that PA.   
---
Similarly, the "Bladed" mod has no hint to its weapon. I just so happened to piece together that it was for the Commie Whacker.
---
**Robot Armor does not change in appearance based on primary modification type.**  
---
Honestly, I don't know if this is a bug or not, but it seriously ought to be the case... :) So: \[BUG/SUGGESTION\]   
---
Things like Shadowed or Polished do not yield any different appearance to the armor piece. Shadowed, naturally, ought to be a dark green or maybe matte black. Similarly, the Polished should....... be polished! Either unpainted polished metal, or a high-sheen glossy paint.  
---
Given the variations of Protectron paint schemes in Appalachia, which I'm not even sure if any of them are the color of the Robot Armor for that matter, but you would expect that the armor we can wear would come in other color/finish options. 
---
I'll add as a bonus, but not officially since I can't play ATM (monthly bandwidth is almost maxed and won't reset till the 9th), so I'm just going off memory: Scout Armor does not scrap into anything.  
---
I don't mean mods, since you have that listed already, but I don't think we receive any Junk either.
---
Harvesting lead at Mount Blair for ammo.
---
You would be way less lonely over there if they would do away with the map markers.
---
THIS! @someoneatbethesda
---
You arent being one shot dude. People accuse me of "one shotting" them all the time but I'm killing them with a automatic railway.
---
Still - you know people will pvp you there so it’s a risk you took
---
It took me forever to find a left arm.  Now I can craft them.  What platform are you on?  I could sell you a right arm.
---
Quit your bitching
---
Gunslingers are tough going at the moment tbh. I've tried and tried and can't make a low stress one.
---
PA Gunner is awesome fun though, if you're referring to a heavy gunner. That I can do....want a build? :)
---
I’m on Xbox
---
Me too.  If you want one, I can sell you one.  I’ll be on in about an hour.  GT: TonyCowboysFan

In the forest keep an eye open for the event leader of the pack. It generates three reliable low level legendaries every time. Good to start with!

Raiders can smell an open stash box.
---
I'll try to remember that next time I go there
---
I'm aware of the risks, just shitty he killed me then left the server. At least give me a chance to try to get my stuff back.
---
I already predicted we get overcharged Fusion Cores, with 200% charge in them.  We'll see.
---
whitesprings and server hop
---
Relax bro and go back to /r/fo76filthycasuals
---
of course it is, that was the area they were showing off to advertise the game
---
I should have asked first.  What level are you?  I was thinking maybe 250 caps for a max level.
---
Maybe your right, all I know is I hear someone shoot and I am instantly dead. Not sure what the rate of fire is on that gun but when it happens again, I’ll be sure to clip it.
---
I'll bitch if I want, thanks :)
---
Ye probably different server
---
im on xbox and run a vats build but haven't noticed anything different.  first shot still almost always misses. so i always double or triple tap out of habit on my first kill. after first kill first shot tends to land
---
Even if you srent being one shot I understand your point. Workshops are just PvP zones for adventure nowm
---
Legs.
---
While technically, yes,that is true, Bethesda has taken some pretty clear steps to separate PvE and PvP. Things like, creating a whole new server where PvP is less a thing you can technically invoke and more an actual part of playing or making it so that somebody in adventure mode cannot destroy your camp unless you are presently aggroed to them. Those are pretty clear steps in separation there. So while yes, you can still PvP in adventure mode, it's pretty clear that adventure mode is no longer where most PvP occurs.
---
Some people farm for junk by taking workshops and some people farm junk by taking it from people who take workshops
---
I've also been playing since BETA, and using Heavies for the large majority of that time.
---
The durability is a drawback, but a very negligible one nowadays. I've rarely had my gun break during a queen fight, and never at all with the addition of Improved Repair Kits.
---
Usually other people handle crippling her, because it *is* important. You keep talking about experience, I can *see* the queen dying faster when i start firing and slower when i stop to reload. That is my experience with this build, which is not even as optimized as it can get. It's not magical oneshot land on boss enemies, no. Neither are rifles. We've literally been back and forth about calcs all day. When both builds are fully optimized for dealing damage, Heavy has the advantage. Even when it doesn't win in base damage, most heavies have to fire rate to overwhelm that disadvantage.
---
Like I said, I'm going to spec out my blank character and try to acquire a BE/B25 handmade to try it myself. I'm curious about how Vats Crits and CF factor in, since the calc doesn't show it's affect.
---
This conversation is exhausting. You win, idgaf anymore. It's clear that neither of us wants to see the other's way at this point.
---
My cornfields!!!
---
I was in a game, team and party with someone this happened literally 3 times in one session one guy wants 5k for an explosive shotgun one star ik very random but i say would u take 1k and if u want I'll trade a weapon also instead of countering he left the party 2 min later left the team 5 to 10 min later left the game i seen him on the next session i joined with my wife and told him a simple yes, no, not enough, or fu would've been fine
---
It's uncanny lmao.
---
This is a decent book...there are two in a my household...there is some outdated info but the perk section and map are great. It's also useful if you need to know where to go farm a specific resource.
---
Rad resistance on it too is “special” compared to the char sheet numbers. Get the same rad resist through chems and its nowhere near as effective as power armor.
---
Example: under the current system, the workshop can be contested from ANYWHERE.  It is literally impossible to have every square inch of the ammo factory or monongah power plant covered by turrets.  Simply put, it's way too easy for the person contesting, and whoever owns it is at a severe disadvantage.
---
Patent system needs to be addressed, perhaps - but I see the need for *some*degree of protection to encourage money, time, and effort being invested in innovation?
---
Like everything else we discussed, a patent is not a problem until excessive greed gets involved in the equation.
---
Perhaps the government could *require* patent holders to issue licenses "at reasonable costs" - but the big issues putting burdens on society currently are: threats to things essential for the public good: clean water, clean air, good education, solid infrastructure, and health care.
---
I don't see a better viable solution than public not-for-profit health "insurance", hospitals, and medical supply (drugs, and medical devices, etc.).
---
There should also be not-for-profit banking available for the masses and cheap excellent public transportation basically *everywhere*.
---
We should not be in the position where a few companies can choose to simply raise the prices on our national supply of drugs like insulin, Levothyroxin, asthma inhalers, and epinephrine auto injectors simply because they desire higher profits!  This literally ***kills people*** and the people responsible for raising the prices should probably face manslaughter charges at the very least.
---
I’m level 26, I’m just looking for a level 30 one for when I hit level 30. I can give you 250 caps for the level 30?
---
soemthing tells me these drones aren't from literally the Pacific Ocean over to West Virginia
---
Yes! Im watching the episode right now. Had to.
---
You don't need to takes it out of your stash to bulk.
---
Especially as i would've been fine going up 1k
---
I highly suggest hitting Blackwater Mine just next to Whitespring station.  You can gather every single last weapon, armor &amp; junk both outside and inside the mine then walk over encumbered next door to the train station to sell it all.  Hop servers and repeat till you clean out the vendor.  1400 caps right there.
---
I think power armor is fine the way it is right now. To reach DR and ER on par with power armor, you need to invest in a lot of defensive perks, forcing you to give up on some quality of life or damage perks. Additionally, the mods for power armor are stronger than legendary effects, especially with the reactive plates or welded rebar mod. In PvP, power armor is pretty clunky, but in PvE power armor is incredibly strong. Fusion cores can be obtained fairly easily if you are willing to take power plants or launch nukes and use the flux to create them. Overall, power armor is fine as is, and legendary power armor would just make regular armor obsolete.
---
Watching the episode right now, had to.
---
Sure is taking a long time for my delivery. Wise man say never pay for late pizza.
---
The DR numbers are lies just like the rad resist number, at least in PvE (I dont pvp much). You can take FAR more hits in PA than not in PA even with the same DR numbers.
---
Let me see if I can craft you a lev 30.  I know I can craft a left arm.  But I can’t remember if I can craft the right.  I’m out running errands and will check when I log in.  About an hour hopefully.
---
I like this. The laundry room tends to have good spawns for me. May incorporate this. Thanks!!
---
No but I have noticed an increase in crybabies. This is part of the game. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. 
---
Noob.
---
Ok I’ll be on after dinner. Add me in case I forget, my psn is same as my username
---
I use Jetpack liberally and still have more cores than I ever can use.  I’m sitting at 40 in my stash.  I do have the card that doubles the life of the cores and I seldom sprint.
---
Yes! Lvl23 at the mo in Raider and rocking a Gatling, it's great fun.
---
Still love the 'slinger too though, bosses aside it kicks ass 😋
---
Ok, thank you, whenevers fine, just send me a message
---
Enclave bunker sells mods and the actual armor pieces.
---
There are no learnable plans for the scout/urban armor.
---
I will
---
I didn't spot it in the list but the DR/ER values for the urban scout left arm...
---
or some people just like to complain in vain about non-issues like floating houses in a video game lol
---
The elevator works, but there is laser grids that turn red right after you exit the elevator.
---
My position wasn't compromised, it was purposely misunderstood.
---
thank you!
---
Yep, with so many people complaining about the drops being shite, I have a tiny bit of hope that one day the devs might take a second look at them and give us something worthy.
---
I have like 150 on me.
---
One day... One day... \^\^
---
That is very sweet of you! my ign is the same as my username, cashiimo. Thank you so much!
---
Take this 100 bucks and go spend it somewhere nice. BTW gas in that time was over 100 a gallon... It's like leaving a quarter in a government drop today.
---
Yeah tormentor is cripple. The thing with the lever is there is no perf mag for it, so it lacks the 40% aa of a handmade or sniper rifle.
---
There are no learnable plans for the scout armor.
---
....by yourself
---
A friend of mine has a couple thousand LOL.
---
It's not like there's anything else to spend caps on in the late late game when you're only sink is Imposter circuit boards.
---
 Its -50% Gun Accuracy. It may apply to VATS but it makes no difference to my game. I don't use VATS.

In the dinner room of the Watoga High School.

Nice! This is exactly the kind of thing I want to do (just started about a week ago). I'm on PS4 so I'll definitely be dropping by sometime.
---
Lol.... "one shot" even though Besthesda confirmed that they made that impososble and YouTube have shown themselves getting shot for 2k damage and not dying.
---

Same here, guess I'm going for mutagens after all.
---
Why are you using Tank Killer with a Gatling? That perk only affects rifles...for heavy gun anti-armor you need Stabilized.
---
Looks like you're right.  I was just comparing fire rate on two rifles.
---
Hairtrigger on the combat rifle takes fire rate from 33 to 49.  But on the hunting rifle it only goes from 3 to 5, wow.  Then again, fire rate on a lever action is 5 and I live with that ok, soooo, guess I'll just have to try it and see.
---
I'd like to clarify this isn't a complaint post by any means, or me hounding on bethesda, I love them and I love this game. I was just unfortunate enough to have this happen to me in a game, and it never hurts to make them aware of a bug!
---
I wasn't trying to be antagonizing. You brought a new tool to the table to kick around numbers. Trying to kick around a fair comparison is where we're at odds. Emergency Protocols simply don't stack up to Serendipity, T51B with Bullet Shield is no comparison for Sentinel, etc, etc and that significantly unbalances the damage calcs. "Glass Cannon Minigun" is not a good idea.
---
When you make your rifle build you'll see. Go experiment with the Mirelurk Queen in the Cranberry bog - in a dozen shots or so (less with a shotgun) you'll have her crippled with large chunks of gray health dropping at a time. Once you feel that out run a comparison with SBQ if you want. Definitely experiment with Tormentor/Enforcer since, as mentioned, we kind of lose out on that on the "pure" Heavy Guns side. If you go semi-auto you will have a blast with all the free time you have now that you don't have to repair and build ammo every hour. :)
---
If you aren't already doing this, grab a random shotgun and equip Enforcer to nearly insta-cripple anything before unloading a Big Gun or Rifle on it. It's pretty counter-intuitive to have to use a completely separate weapon class to achieve what a Perk is supposed to give us.
---
You'll see gray health dropping from the queen just like you would with a heavy gun. :)
---
He spoke like we all are supposed to know who the fuck he is whilst telling a tale of how he's choosing to opt out of Facebook groups and PvP for 76 because somebody messaged his wife and said something disparaging. Then he proceeded to double down on edgy cringe by threatening said messenger with real world consequences that he could apparently bring about. 
---
All in all no one seemed to know who the fuck Apexigod is nor care, but he's writing his own legend.
---
Ye I like it more than bloodied but ... after popping at least 5 different Chems to get the full bonus anything after 5 doesn’t stack you start to gain a few negative stats and they stack
---
Relax. I have 2 shot Gauss with all relevant perks. Stealth to the max. Beats anything  ...so far 🙄
---
Well the math is simple, if you sell stuff you looted, you make a net 1400 caps daily, your savings will only grow if you don’t buy anything.
---
But if you buy cheap serum and sell them to bots, the 1400 is largely taken by the caps that’s already yours. Say if you buy 4 serums at 200 and sell to bots at 350 each, you only make 150x4 per day, far less than 1400. Easy but a not so efficient way to make caps.
---
It goes into your inventory when you bulk it and you have to manually transfer it back.
---
Ok...whatever you want to call it then. I was dead in less than half a second.
---
You should be able to find them at Phoenix for cheaper than that, no?
---
5% per hit, up to +50%. The reason it looks like more than that is due to how the damage resistance mechanic works - the more damage you deal, the less of it (percentage wise) is absorbed by armor

I will check this out. My PSN is Radcooldude55YT.

[Furious Mechanics Testing Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bx3tjj/furious_mechanics_testing_update/)
---
I think the issue is that theres too much op stuff in PVP putting less geared up and newer players off, getting bursted down from someone who can kill you from miles away in less than a second whilst being invisible is too much to be honest for the more casual f76 player. With the fact you lose meds too now with no decent reward for playing survival I can see why they avoid it. It needs to provide better rewards for the pain at being targeted by predator on crack. Possibly better legendary drop rate or increased cap bonus on everything.
---
Welcome to over a month ago, the one and ONLY time anyone has ever been right about this kind of shit out of the dozens of times people bring it up after every single patch.
---
Go to the misc. Sturctures menu, its labeled fast travel target
---
I was digging around in my stash at the train station and suddenly got the paper he gives after the insult, but I didn’t catch the insult! So sad!
---
Take your self back to r/fallout
---
I do not agree on stopping new content for the sake of stability.  
---
It needs to be a balance, since i personally dont really have much in the way of stability problems so stopping content would just stagnate the game for people like me and we'd get bored and leave.  
---
Not saying there no need for stability fixes as like you said, a lot of people do have these problems and they need to be addressed too, but even then, theres still times when you dont get the issies so much and can play, and stopping content now would mean even the people with stability problems would be bored of the stagnant game before theyre fixed.   
---
I think they have the balance almost right how they have it now, but people also keep forgetting that the only reason we were getting so many content oatches was because we were in the Wild Appalachia dlc wave, that has now ended and we wont reslly be getting much content until nuclear winter launches whenever it does, until then, im guessing its full steam ahead on bug fuxes and stability patches.  
---
Again, i think its almost right how they have it now, but there are still loads of "quick win" fixes they could make to improve the game, quick bug fixes that only take a small amount of time to fix bug lots of people would notice, small QOL changes like how notes are sorted ect...
---
Two players helped me defend a workshop and I panicked the whole time thinking they were going to kill me. Never stashed crap so quickly in my life. LOL They just wanted to help and get the event reward.

Hey man its reddit youre not supposed to believe any of the comments.
---
From the station I do the first set of houses ( buildings on my right) then cut to the maint/ laundry lot and building, across the front of the main building to the last set of buildings (w/ mistress of mystery, buildings on left shoulder) then golf club then the rest of the way around ( clockwise) out the hole in the fence to the dump site w/4 super mutants then back to camp/train station.

Youre still just as wrong this month though. :)

Here's my sub 3 minute SBQ kill:  [https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1587](https://youtu.be/buqpQNy7WCE?t=1587)
---
There are multiple of them in that stream - this is normal for me, and those people in my party were all randoms besides appa:
---
And yes, she will land reliably every time. What makes her NOT land is someone having aggro thats on the roof or somewhere else that is inaccessible to her, or her bugging out (happens less these days). 
---
I have a full Unyielding + ap refresh bloodied rifle build with a BE handmade. I've done SBQ on him. I was able to reliably get sneak attacks and build / spend crits, and he is built for maximum crits / crit damage with rifles. He's a mule now because his dps couldn't even begin to compare to my heavy main. He's fine for one shotting random stuff from stealth. Mutants, ghouls, all that is fine and he's great for quickly tapping vats and killing things very quickly from stealth. Fun character in that regard. But you want raw dps? Then you want heavy weapons, specifically a .50 cal.
---
I'm not even going to try to address all of your other points because they're so far out there... yes, you need to use power armor for heavy weapons. That isn't even a drawback for pve content, and for pvp you'd want a totally different character build - either shotguns or rifles.
---
I only have 5 Charisma they are showing up as over 5K for me
---
I heard of them but still haven't found one to this day
---
That’s if you never miss a shot
---
No thanks, /r/fnv is my home
---
I'm gonna go check right now
---
How does this relate to a AA Handmade with Tank Killer? What kind of damage increase does the perk have on a AA weapon? I am one of the few with an AAE Handmade and an TSE Handmade and really it seems the AAE Handmade is more accurate and just below in damage done to mutants etc but prefer it over the TSE cause of accuracy.
---
geez, thanks for that recap... funny if it wasnt so sad at the same time
---
i think ive had enough internet for the day
---
Hahaha typically response for someone who lost a discussion. Do yourself a favor and discuss on topics that you're actually informed about. I'm not a huge fan of fallout 76 but I at least can give it merits where its due.

For eveyone wondering they are in the misc. Structures menu

So much fun when your piece is green and you get the same error message over and over again, "Blah blah cannot be placed in the thing!"

Wait, they STILL haven't fixed this? Holy shit.
---
Ahh I should have know lol
---
At camp or workshop?

Some people are careful how they spend their money.  Nothing wrong with that.
---
Both
---
Interesting, if so  is a stealth add? 
---
I haven’t seen any mention of it.
---
starched genes locks your mutations in place at rank 2, class freak reduces the downsides of them to make them more viable. total luck used is at 5 for those perks, and then 3 more for bloody mess.

No problem. Take a break and we'll see you tomorrow.

All of my Iron Chef Dreams could come true!
---
Honestly they need more end game content before they even think about removing the SBQ. It think it's a cool idea, but I'm expecting more so just NPC's showing up from the West.
---
After viewing the horrible launch of this game, I was dead sure that I would never buy it. 
---
...this post has made me rethink my decision.
---
Incorrect.  Just looked under Misc at my camp and it’s not there.  Just workshops still.
---
These are the kinds off T.o.w.n.s. i wanna see more of
---
I feel the lever action hits a sweet spot between combat rifle and hunting rifle.  It has benefits, but lacks options.  Some days I curse the balance in this game, and other times I feel its overall on target.
---
you dont lose the stack if you miss.. only if you hit something else or run out the 10 second reset timer...
---
It’s not true.  It’s just workshops they might have just discovered it lol.
---
What weapon is that?
---
I'm still trying to figure out how this game even exists.  Oh right it's the Fallout license. Imagine if the game was called Virgina76
---
Fucking troll... dude just deleted his post lol 
---
Thanks for confirming it's still not available bud.
---
Yes I know butt can get tricky in Mobs
---
😂 damn.
---
It’s basically a bloody deathclaw gauntlet with power attack 2nd and 3rd stars
---
You do realise after 50, picking a perk isnt adding any points to your specials dont you? You have the option to unlock a perk card, or move 1 point from a special to another. Think were playing the same game, you just dont know how to play it.
---
Some are cool. The ones who jabber and ask endless questions are definitely tiresome. Sometimes it can be kinda funny but other times you've just gotta dip out to preserve your sanity. Plus I don't use a mic and they still expect you to respond to everything using emotes.
---
Emergency protocols, nerdrage can buy you time to stims yourself. I once used a double barrel 50cal with vampire and fast hands. I never reload
---
True, but if they don't add stuff to do the game will die. Everything we've gotten added has felt like handing a few pieces of candy to a starving man. Like yeah OK, this stuff is nice, but where's the MEAT and POTATOES? Where's the real end game content? Because farming SBQ, a single fight, for going on 6+ months isn't enough.
---
I run an Instigating &amp; Explosive Dragon, When in stealth and with psycho, I do **2251.13** DMG. \[My build has +45% DMG (Riflemean), +36% armor penetration (Tank-Killer), +15 weapon DMG (Bloody Mess). The rest of my perks don't affect DMG\], I also use a TSE Handmade, which does **333.59** DMG in the same circumstance. 
---
If you have the exact same Dragon I w/ the max perk Covert Operative it would do **2813.91** DMG.
---
\^ + max Demolition Expert it would do **3095.30** DMG.
---
Where the heck do ya get that?
---
I had a guy pitch me perfectly. He said "ok listen make me an offer, you get one shot so think about it". 10k caps and I had an AA explosive pump and a 3star bat.

For since the BETA, we vault dwellas have prayed for this day to come..the day where we would be freed from the chains of interrupted teleportation to a day when we could REJOICE on the floor decor of gratitude and happiness. Where no longer, after each jump, we have the need to pray to not be caught up in the cement but instead be brought forth in the sunlight. My fellow vault dwellas...that day...is today. No longer do we have to pray to our Lord and savior the mighty Todd Howard for the salvation from traps of foundation. Now...we travel...unabated and in peace.
---
My machines emptied themselves after a server crash.
---
Honestly, I had some supports out at an old golf course house, and the stupid ghouls took long enough to break them that my missiles delt with them before they could do anything meaningful to my house.. but that was pre-vendor, when people are constantly accidentally spawning stuff.
---
I'll have to think about what I want to remove to place more into Luck. I just got on and have mow realised the only weapon affected by both Iron Fist and Gladiator cards is the meat hook so I have to swap up the build anyway
---
Ad victoriam brother, ad victoriam
---
No, I'm 62 &amp; my floating camp is so I can play the piano on what looks like a grand stage :)
---
Right, I specifically want it buffed to be a little more viable in pvp at base, so we aren't getting one shot, and then add legendary effects to bring it up to be on par with the best pvp gear.
---
What platform? Do you have a screeny of nuke placement?
---
Your opinion is your opinion. At least you gave it a cherry.
---
Xbox, and yes here ya go! [https://imgur.com/QX8tOcC](https://imgur.com/QX8tOcC)
---
We can't forget how God damn coordinated they are. Ones always laying into you with a mini gun while the others flank and suiciders charge at ya from 20 diff directions
---
They tried to do that, but it was always sidelined by "Where's my Biological Seedling?"
---
I totally agree. Far Harbor made a far better story along the same sort of themes, especially if you bring Nick.
---
Oh good lord. I just noticed that I must have responded to the wrong thread originally. I'm very dumb.  Carry on.
---
Survival weekly weapon
---
Yeah. Whatever.  Must’ve hit a sore point bud. 
---
Truth hurts, doesn’t it?
---
I was kinda hoping to become a super mutant. imagine running around screaming “ONLY ONE OF US WILL SURVIVE HUMAN! AND IT WONT BE YOU!”
---
Learnt suppressing mod for it yesterday
---
Hate burst your bubble.... but some other guy commenting saying he just checked and it's not true... shortly after OP deleted post... or tried to i guess, since post is obviously still open but no longer lists his name on it. Lol
---
Hmm, a Bloodied explosive vats crit increase combat shotgun.... Best i can do is 20 caps my dude, thats a bargain and your ripping me off if you expect any more
---
Can't believe he's about to draw last blood
---
If you removed the connecting floors and made each one a standalone building it would give you a bunch of budget back and would be much easier to place again if you need
---
I love these whining posts where they believe the guy responsible is going to read this.
---
Should’ve stashed in your Camp and then moved to the workshop, since it’s free travel to both of them.
---
This is 100% on you, OP.
---
Does berserker get the full +50% while in Hazmat suit?
---
I think the only time that I’ve ever used a gamma gun was either against those in sent/cav gear or to carry a mobile radiation chamber to lower my own health.
---
Yeah well I took too much time writing that up so imma leave it lol. I'm away from my PS4 though so I was taking his word for it haha. Bummer though.
---
Many of those you can only get from Grahm
---
But you realize people do this because it’s the easiest way to get a blueprint to work for mobile bases? I think every blueprint I have ever made has not allowed me to place it after moving locations, even the more simple ones, so eventually I also built a sky box.
---
 Legendary power armor is likely coming. Or some other armor that is more powerful than the current meta legendary armor.  It's a phenomenon called "power creep" that is the norm in games like this.  You struggle to get the best weapons/  armor only to have it become obsolete later down the road by something newer and more powerful.
---
Very cool. Always nice to see people be creative. 99% of the camps i run into are floating boxes.
---
Metal picnic table is on Graham. I just bought one off him to sell in my vendor machine yesterday.
---
This is excellent. TIL!!
---
Have an upvote.
---
Check the white springs vendors. I know I’ve seen some of those plans there.
---
 Well for slow melee. makes little difference to my knives. Why, at 3 hits a sec, who can even tell what happened. ;)
---
Maybe I'm just wrong then lol. My bad bud. I thought they were cheaper.
---
Maybe a different color of smoke would be a cool way to get everyone’s attention.that it includes a legendary. 
---
Everyone can rush for that one star wooden leg piece.
---
Floor safe is usually at Harper Ferry Vendor
---
(Not freestates in Whitesprings, although maybe... I have serious issues finding plans on those robots)
---
it does a lot of damage if you think of it like a "different" grenade launcher.
---
I went to Pendleton and apparently I’ve bought every single plan.  Stone Benches is what I’m missing but it doesn’t seem to spawn all the time?
---
2 weeks, minus a day
---
A lot of us have been here since beta. Some old bugs
---
It’s in a better place then it was at launch.
---
Maybe server hop? I know the toolbox plans were a pain to find because if someone bought it on the server, it wouldn’t spawn.
---
Wait, these don’t drop level-appropriate gear? I’ve been saving them until level 50 for no reason...
---
I find a relog fixes this when it happens to me. The vats missing seems to be a session bug.
---
Yeah you can't get it below 5k (at vendor anyway). I have hard bargain rank 3 and can get my charisma to 20ish or so. Every item has a max value when buying or selling. 
---
At least not the plans. Which is what OP asked for. The mods are a different story. Mods you can probably get around 500caps or less. But are harder to find. Plans are always there.
---
&gt;* Stacks are target specific, and you can only have stacks vs one target at a time. Accidently hitting a 2nd target will reset your stacks.
---
Ah hell. I was hoping stacks wouldn't reset on hitting a second target, now that makes my furious tesla gun look worse than my quad one, even though I still prefer the furious since it slightly more ammo efficient when hitting one enemy at a time.
---
It does but at one point it becomes subpar to other things you can have. I’ve found it to be more situational but I never take it off my guy.
---
I just want to know how Floopwood manages to have even 1 building considering the amount of neon signs that are used in that build.   
---
But for real, nice job with everything. :)
---
Cool. Thanks.  What items do you prioritize and what do you craft?
---
we have the same setup but i have the 1080 I run everything at max all the time since Beta almost no issues there are hiccups now and then but that's just the game. maybe your just getting some strange internet lag
---
i do understand that, just dont understand the right language to explain it I guess.
---
FYI: You can also change the colors of the lights with a terminal. 
---
You can only set one color at time, so the best way I've found is to have all the light boxes using same color (let's say yellow) connected in a series, and attach it to a terminal. You also want to have a central power connector (or the generator) nearby so you can detach the wire for the yellow boxes from the terminal and connect the wire to set up the blue boxes, and so on.
---
This works much faster than clicking through all the colors on each light.
---
Perfect.  Any chance you or anyone has him in a server on XBOX right now?
---
Maybe add some plans or recipes like some random chance, would make worthwhile.
---
Which is why I am still deciding between these two 
---
(Have an Anti Armor Grenade launcher too)
---
Nothing wrong with that. The "above" (yours) placement yields way more violet flux than the "below" placement, albiet with a slightly more difficult (minimal) queen fight because of terrain.  I typically do the below placement but I don't think this is causing the issue. Disclosure: I am PC and have completed the event over 100 times since I have encountered the bug. I used to frequently though. That being said, it will probably happed tonight.
---
Tell him he’s being the villain :p
---
I had two asshats try to bounty bait me.. forgot to turn pacifist on and they used my mutations to initiate pvp but after that they literally Mr. Handy buzzed me while I played tuba for 5 minutes until I blocked him. It was so pointless...they got some caps ( .5% of my total...B.F.D.) and some junk I could replace in minutes
---
Also metal boxes.  I've pulled one from a footlocker at one of the firebases in the bog and the other from a metal box in Ft. Defiance.
---
I'm on xbox. Won't be on until around 830 eastern though.
---
Copy paste it to notepad and save it for next time lol .... 
---
And yeah it sucks. Not sure if dude was being a troll or just too embarrassed to keep post active lol
---
Thanks for the tip, wasn't my nuke but I'll keep that in mind when I do it tonight!
---
My deathclaw gauntlet and power fist didn't work, but all rise did. It's really wonky
---
to clarify, i meant perk card, not point.  Sorry to the two players (downvotes) who's panties were twisted.  We all make mistakes when utilizing a new language.
---
Its too bad we couldnt use our own explosives and blow some holes on the side of the mountain and make our own vaults that would be cool
---
I see 2 options. #1 they have some godly gear
---
Or #2, they are turning on pacifist at some point in the fight maybe?
---
Dang. That is a lot of caps in a short time. Is this plan that you found rare? Or do most of us have it?
---
Haha. Im trying to read between the lines here. I’ll google it.
---
Yeah, I'm tired of that sign calling me sister though.
---
You get sprayed with a two shot explosive auto rifle and die in milliseconds, you may as well be one shotted. There are builds against it however. :)
---
a Furious explosive would be good for gunslinger vats build.
---
ive go a 10mm one if your interested on ps4
---
I believe the cranberry bog is set up so only the BoS exist there, watoga is a robot city and the land being filled with the remaining scorched even if npcs come along seems to be fine and only minor lore breaking if only to keep around SBQ for game play purposes
---
I'm on xbox, but thanks though!
---
Yeah it seems like you'll have to be careful about which addictions you take depending on what your build is.
---
Thanks! Almost every building is bare inside aside from posters and signs. The budget all went to the surface aesthetics
---
How in the world do you have enough camp budget for that....
---
These types of posts are not allowed on this sub. Check the trading subs
---
A lot of the drama since launch has been stuff outside Fo76 (canvas bag, nuka rum, lawsuits). The game has just slowly but surely been getting improved and stabilized since launch
---
I am currently working on building a jail/prison of sorts, and I've only finished the frame of things but I'm worried I will run out of budget. sigh lol
---
Human npcs*
---
pacifist mode only prevents you from doing PVP damage if there is a hostile player. the protection only applies if they are not hostile towards you, AKA their health is red and they are a red dot on the compass.
---
Pacifist would prevent them from killing me. The amount of time it takes for the menu to load wouldn't allow that.
---
Check out the OP. I'm not just trying to sling ideas on why the .50 "is bad" - it's not. See the OP.
---
&gt; And yes, she will land reliably every time
---
That's a somewhat recent change. She'll land even if you don't cripple her now.... a while ago, she would just stagger in air while being hit with high fire rate weapons.
---
That's a bit of a tangent.
---
&gt; yes, you need to use power armor for heavy weapons.
---
Read the OP. That isn't a tangent.
---
&gt; That isn't even a drawback for pve content, and for pvp you'd want a totally different character build - either shotguns or rifles.
---
This is literally one of the "far out" things I've said.
---
&gt; I've optimized my build even more since then, and I can now face tank SBQ hits with absurd ease.
---
That's not particularly impressive and, one of those "far out" things, is that you can face tank SBQ hits _and take no damage_ out of power armor....... and it works PVP or PVE.
---
I collected nearly every serum recipe from the Queen when they dropped from her.... with a .50 Cal. Been there, done it, rinsed and repeated it. I have no idea why this is not tangential and "far out there" when the OP is about _making heavy guns accessible earlier_. I don't agree that removing the PA requirement **suddenly makes them wildly OP in the same manner that you and your friend do**.
---
NMS added a terrain manipulator in one of their early updates. Would be cool to have that. They're similar genres, may as well take their ideas
---
Going rate on PC is 100 for each type
---
Are you playing in survival mode? They are likely equipped with sentinel/assassin gear, difficult to overcome without high tier weapons.
---
PC by the way, Aus/NZ region if that helps.
---
You need to do more than be an ideas guy to work at any position in gaming corps.
---
The only argument I'm making is that in a flat out dps race, the .50 cal wins by large margin. Do you argree with that or not?
---
If it's an exploit, I don't know about it. I'll be working on a video soon of town building, maybe that could help you. I know you can do it, let's go rebuild America!
---
Keep up with the great shots
---
Since they began selling actual X01 plans, I've noticed Modus has far fewer mods for sale in the bunker. Even then when he sold more, I hit the bunker over 100 times, no exaggeration, to get two shock mods. RNG.
---
This is my first fallout. Really need to go back and try the others.
---
I lived in PA for the longest time, got sick of hunting for fusion cores all the time and transitioned to a bloodied/unyielding build right before player vending came out. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it, and really enjoy it now. 
---
I go full unyielding, and 1 handed melee. Typical perk card setup going for maximum damage output. I get just under 1100 damage after adrenal reaction is maxed. 
---
I used to think ghouls were my biggest enemy, but I've learned a few things that make it to where only glowing ghouls are my worst enemy. First, i don't need 1100 damage to one shot a high level ghoul. I pop some diluted radaway when i know I'm going to run into them until my health is around 40%, still plenty for one shots. This gives me a buffer for their radiation damage if i get hit.
---
Second thing, don't get hit by ghouls. They naruto run at you at excessive speeds, but they're very clumsy. I think of myself as a matador, and them as bulls with learning disabilities. A lot of the time you can just back up and they will stumble and hit the ground. I mostly just jump their shit though, don't give them time to build up momentum, catch them off guard. I run through whitespring like a madman, choppin that meat. I am Butcher Pete.
---
Same with West Tek. Marsupial, and speed demon are a must in my mind. It's a lot of fun flying through the air and connecting shots as I land. You just have to keep moving until everything is dead. If i ever get a decent gun to drop I might have some insight on non-one handed melee builds, but RNG wants me to stack that ammo.
---
I don’t have the plans for sale, but I can sell you any of the modded staffs. I’ve got burning, barbed, burning barbed, heavy, electrified, and poisoned staffs for 300 caps each. Buy one get one free today only
---
Things take less budget than you would think. Take away detail if you have to. It'll work out
---
...and the Purveyor drops legendary Scout armor if the RNG God's allow...
---
They all share the same 1400 cap pool that refreshes 20 hours from your first transaction of the day
---
.
---
All the vendors are tied to the same cap amount.
---
It removes all armor at least for my game (on ps4).
---
Instigating fat man is awesome
---
No, like I said in my posting, I'm playing in adventure mode. I try to avoid PvP so I stay out of survival mode. I get enjoyment helping other players instead of wrecking them. But now I want to wreck them.
---
 I Only sell 2 star and up legendaries, people who sell non legendary weapons and armor would actually make more Caps if they broke down items and just sold junk components. I will always have a need for junk. It annoys me to see someone trying get attention by selling garbage gear and making their camp seem like it's worth a visit. There should be indicators on the camp or ways to rate a shop to let players know where the best sellers are.
---
thanks, thats awful
---
Your pacifist mode prevents you from hurting them and not vice versa. If you are hostile to them and in pacifist mode, you can not hurt them, but if they are not in pacifist they can hurt you.
---
Thanks, thats awful :(
---
^This. It used to be 200 each for the 7 factions so you'd have Eto travel around to all of them
---
Have you read through patch notes? They clearly say that all vendors are tied now. They did that a few big patches back. During launch they were not tied but they tied them and made a vendor of each faction at whitesprings during the same patch. Been like this for some time now.
---
Vendors are all tied together now. You have to wait 20 hours I think.
---
Absolutely, as a sysadmin myself I have gravitated towards smaller companies specifically to avoid all of that bureaucracy getting in the way of getting the job done. Having worked for a software company about twice the size of Zenimax (at least in terms of employees) the red tape to do something as simple as adjust the sensitivity on a Nagios check so it would stop false-alarming at 3am was almost worse than being woken up at 3am by a false Nagios alarm.
---
We also have no idea what their processes look like on the inside. Are they Agile? What is the acceptance criteria on bug reports? How much disconnect is there between tier 1 support and the actual boots-on-the-ground developers? Are there potential legal issues with accepting code form a 3rd party? A million other factors that can turn one line of code into a month worth of meetings.
---
Either way, I think you're fighting the good fight, and I certainly appreciate the effort you've put into compiling all this info. Keep up the good work.
---
Deathclaw Hide is missing the LLD\_Creature\_Deathclaw list, why it's not found on them likely.
---
It does have the Loot and Vendor Large\_Unique lists.
---
Taking a quick glance through those, it looks like Footlockers, some wall Lockers, Metal Boxes, Dumpsters, Tents, Bohemoths, Gulpers, Deathclaw Nests and Junkpiles can have them, if I'm digging through all these nested Level lists properly
---
I know this. I have pacifist mode turned off.
---
Flat out DPS race - glass cannon rifleman wins by a large margin. Melee actually wins over them both. You already mentioned that your rifleman build worked just fine and I'm sure it works in PVE and PVP.
---
This is built into the game. Fast firing weapons have reduced damage-per-shot and lower damage does not fair well against highly armored targets.
---
You cannot disagree with that and it's trivial to "prove" in comparison with melee and/or rifleman with the very tool your friend provided. If you want to alter the context to say "flat out DPS race over 3 minutes against SBQ in-flight" then I would have to agree because that is very factual. :)
---
Side note: Your build includes OGA. Appa actually suggested this wasn't useful. What do you think?
---
I mean, it used to be where there was 7 diffrent vendors with 200 caps each, so you had to do a lot of fast travelling to do your selling.
---
It's actually not an issue if you know how to work with it. Not awful at all.
---
I havent played in quite some time, so no, I did not read the patch notes from several patches ago. Thanks for the heads up though
---
Things that make you hostile and thus negate pacifist protections.
---
1) having a workshop and being contested.
---
2) being wanted
---
3) being teamed with a player that is hostile
---
Ps4.
---
I've sold nukashine, ballistic Bock, sunshine oil, formula p, lots of camera film and diluted stims/radaway. Berry mentats sells well also. But I'm also pricing them cheap.
---
Instead of messing with server hoping i just keep an eye on the map. Try to make sure nobody has been in that area for a minute or two and you should be good. Only time i really server hop is when half the spawns are ash or goo piles.
---
So how likely is that ant to be 3 star?
---
As I put in another thread:
---
Taking  a quick glance through those, it looks like Footlockers, some wall  Lockers, Metal Boxes, Dumpsters, Tents, Bohemoths, Gulpers, Deathclaw  Nests and Junkpiles can have them, if I'm digging through all these  nested Level lists properly
---
Ammsmith and superduper. This will be your life line
---
It would be nice if we had the option to make any under armor an outfit instead
---
Here to buy in bulk.
---
Yep. Think it was like patch 6 or so. It's in the inside vault dweller articles too. Wouldnt be a bad idea to go read up. A lot has changed.
---
 Oh lord look around. I paid 800 and felt ripped off. About 400 is a normal price at a Player Vendor.
---
I ran across a player vendor selling a huge stack of them for 0 caps. I think some gave up on your hope 😂
---
I guess you didn't read my post at all. OK, Later.
---
Looking through the nested loot lists:
---
 Footlockers, some wall  Lockers, Metal Boxes, Dumpsters, Tents, Bohemoths, Gulpers, Deathclaw  Nests and Junkpiles
---
Fair __play__
---
Just FYI a heavy bloodied build is the best DPS in the game by far - the LMG and .50cal can get up to 200+ dmg per bullet with adrenal and the heavy weps damage perks, and then they can 10+ rounds per second. I can take out a sheepsquatch in ~6 seconds and neither of my primaries are even using prime ammo, because keeping it in stock is too big a pain, lol
---
Why are we talking about pacifist mode?! I already said I have it turned off. That other guy said the other player has pacifist turned on and I replied that no, if they had pacifist mode turned on they wouldn't be able to run up to me and kill me in one hit.
---
You're deviating from the lore quite a bit, the Brotherhood has strong opinions about Super Mutants and Synths so a human with partial mutation would probably be considered the enemy.
---
Where did you find out the total sales for each system?
---
Sorry about this, I just found an arm by accident, so I no longer need one
---
I'm aware it's on me. Post was to vent lol
---
Op asked about a recipe, not serum :)
---
I think they should have some sort of Legendary/mob guarding the drop so you have to take them out before you can claim it. Makes you feel as if you earned it!
---
I recommend maxing out rifleman then when you've got a good ammo stockpile switch to commando for the DPS. You can slot rifleman back in if you pick up a decent gauss or black powder.
---
That’s awesome. Thanks!
---
I wasn't completely thrilled about your 9yo child observing you play a game like Fallout... 
---
But, "hammer to yo face" ***is*** incredibly hilarious to imagine her saying... lol
---
It’s one of the best changes made to the game- not awful at all. Now you can sell higher-value items to vendors (actually have use for those pricey serum recipes)
---
Has Bethesda ever been competent when it comes to stability and fixes? Don't they have a long reputation of the community fixing their broken games? Why would anything change now?
---
200+ sounds a little too mature for me.  Do nursing homes have decent wifi?
---
just explaining how pacifist mode works, the new ANTI PVP protection only works if the enemy is non-hostile to you
---
But for poor folk like me I gotta wait longer to acquire caps for my Tesla coils and other mods :-(
---
Definitely. :)
---
Check mods, check net connection/VPN. Nothing reported that I have seen.
---
Happened on Xbox 3 days ago for some reason.
---
I think they should of kept queen mutations drops as that was the only way you could get a recipe for cheaper that 13k
---
Just fast travel out and don't spend any caps at that vendor. I think they do it on purpose.
---
What is that?
---
It's never worth lugging stuff around to sell for caps in this game.  To get my daily cap limit I usually run through harpers ferry twice per character, takes ~15 min.  If I'm not feeling that then sometimes I'll do west tek -&gt; emmett -&gt; middle mountain -&gt; blackwater.  More encumbered walking that way though.
---
You know, you may be right. This isn’t the first tile I’ve encountered it, but since it didn’t appear the next day I forgot about it.
---
I put away my bloodied gauntlet and pull out my level 10 crook for this event. Like you said, there is no reason to be decked out for this one. There is nothing impressive about one shoting a wendigo.
---
I don't think it kills you outright, but if anything else hits you before you heal up then it's extremely dangerous. Had some issues with that in queen fights, although that was mostly Psychobuff rather than Well Fed. Psychobuff + bloodied is not a great idea.
---
It's not really that hard to only fire one shot with a full auto especially something like a railway rifle...also put a .38 rcvr on you combat rifle when you run out of .45...I use .38 more then anything I'd bet...doesn't cause me many issues pve.
---
no and the only thing I have to trade for it outside of caps is a T-51B Jetpack mod
---
No. I just dont see how you think bringing welfare into a video game arguement is a smart idea. I work for every cent I have and you are bringing real world politics in accusing me of being some kind of leech. You're fucking dickhead dude.
---
Oh of course, RP wise we are lore friendly and have the same feeling about the FEV abominations. But you can’t tell everyone who joins to get rid of their mutations, that’s how you loose members. When you start to force them into a certain way of playing and dictating their characters
---
Have no clue took a pic then it was gone. First thing I thought of was the ice wall from game of thrones.
---
Why couldn't you be on Xbox 😭
---
Must be some graphic bug
---
How many caps we talking
---
Give reactive a try it does more damage.
---
We already know that travel mats aren’t in the game because of trappers. They’ve said that.
---
Yeah they’re probably in sentinel/assassin gear.
---
It’s pretty tough to get into PVP in adventure mode, if you take over a workshop and choose to defend it, you’re in PVP. If you have pacifist mode off and retaliate an attack, you’re in PVP. I’d suggest keeping pacifist ON and never contest a workshop. Even the best gun in the game can’t get you then.
---
You and me both pal
---
I think they are scared you might steal their furniture
---
No you don’t have to wait longer. Used to be you max out at 1400 caps per cycle (200 caps x 7 vendor pools). Now you max out at 1400 caps per cycle, and/but you don’t have to fast travel.
---
Looks like a temp for BR.
---
Did you take herd mentality? 
---
Join a team and see what happens.
---
I've always used the Tesla coil for flavor and effect so it's hard wired in my brain.
---
Executioner's (underrated imo)
---
Makes sense now
---
All those mutations have detrimental effects on your special. Check the effects in your pip boy. There is a perk card that mitigates this a bit
---
I’ve been finding some player vendors that have been selling serem recipes for as low as 1k each
---
My mistake!
---
You can use a obital baombardment also
---
As nice as they look but in case of the tracksuits - to buy something which no one will see because of needed armor overlay is just throw away atoms.
---
You can still find it. I just got mine a few days ago, you just gotta be persistent or lucky.
---
The bad part of PC, no one plays battlefront when I just want to fly around space and blast things once in awhile though.
---
I think that's my struggle is that I like to decorate my builds, so trying to figure out what to keep and what to exclude is hard for me lol.
---
Seems to be okay now. Thanks.
---
Winter is coming.
---
If you find any recipes at that price, though, drop me a dm :)
---
I'm kinda proud this post did that. To give you some idea before you buy: You have to go into it knowing that it's a survival game. There's an RPG backbone but hunger, radiation, and disease factors into gameplay but as you go along these things matter less and less. 
---
There's also no input or decisions to the quests, but the game isn't really about quests. There's multiple storylines and all, but since there's no reason to have an alt other than to have a different build currently then you just keep playing around on the same character. They will be adding a main questline with "choice and consequences that will affect the wasteland" though so maybe soon there will be.
---
 I spend my time running high level events with guaranteed 3 star spawns and also grinding atoms, but less so that since building Floopwood. Probably make room for that in my game schedule again haha

Don't make the mistake that someone else is misunderstanding you because you really like limiting something to the scope of a SBQ fight. I have a single star bloodied .50 Cal I've had for a very long time... like when I collected all of those serum recipes from random queen drops while we fought her back-to-back-to-back-to-back a long time ago (including a patch that buffed Heavy Gun damage).
---
I get it. You like your .50 Cal and it's actually accessible to players pretty early (to the point in OP - remember, the thing you're supposed to be considering?). Plucking someone out of PA wouldn't break your build. It would all still work just fine (plus you could use Serendipity _and take no damage_).
---
They likely have built their character around the bloodied legendary bonus and intentionally keep their health low while pumping themselves full of chems, a full host of mutations, and other modifiers.  
---
Getting one-shotted sucks.  I walked up to someone sneaking around in [summer shorts](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Summer_shorts_\(Fallout_76\)), waved, and, after a brief awkward pause, they popped me in the head from about 2 meters away.  What really got me bummed was that the same day, someone had gifted me a bunch of junk.  Since 2/3 of the gift filled my stash and I was running around completing possum challenges, I lost a bunch of scrap.
---
This is the highest compliment, thaaaank you
---
Herd Mentality mutation or you have Blight disease. If it doesn't list any diseases, try taking a disease cure anyway, see what happens. 
---
In the past I've been addicted to alcohol and it not show in pipboy. Seems sometimes it bugs out. I took addictol and negative stats cleared up for me.
---
I'm on PC.  Last night I was missing three 95% hit chances in a row!!  This happened over and over.  Interesting to hear someone else had the same problem.
---
Uh- aurora borealis?
---
I'll be there..  cant promise I'll have an outfit but IF you have extra I'll definitely wear I one with yall
---
Just too cool. I love seeing people's imagination and hard work. I don't think that there is anything that the minds as a collective can't figure out and accomplish. Well done👏👏👏👏
---
I haven't been INSIDE whitesprings for a good bit...my camp is by the station so there ain't much I need in there.
---
Yes, but my character is outfitted to be a freaky cultist already, so it's perfectly in character.
---
 So where does a console store it's photos?
---
Tap, don't hold down. Holding it down just eats your AP and cores and it's less effective as well.
---
I had that happen on one of my characters, relogging in didn't fix it, but it came back when I played the following day.
---
But yes it would be nice if they allowed you to loot another off one of the MoM Corpses
---
I've heard, herd mentality was slightly bugged to not display properly.
---
[My Metal Box off the ground](https://imgur.com/a/My1pXRX#2g42kpQ)
---
Have a looksie
---
None of those take away SPECIAL points bud.
---
I thought they gave better loot depending on the region you were in?
---
Mine has been gone since patch 2 or something.. it's like I never had one.. havnt been downstairs in the mansion in ages
---
The Hardened and Prime Receivers for the Western Revolver are weaker than they should be. The Severe Receiver does more damage than both.
---
Okay, pal
---
*Bullets can no longer be crafted but cab be bought in the ammo shop.  It's not p2w cause you don't compete with eachother and hey there is always melee! /s I'm fine with it now...ish just anticonsumerism is easy $$$$
---
Console stores the photos in the games installation folder.
---
If the game is updated, you risk losing them (though it hasn't happened to me yet)
---
If you uninstall, all photos are erased.
---
Xbox, upload anything you want to keep.
---
That's fair. I still see a good amount of people in there, though; my train of thought was more or less 'the actual Whitespring building is closer to the golf club than the station, so why not just place a machine inside so people can just walk back and forth faster'. I'm not BOTHERED by the fact that I have to go to the station to cash in legendaries, just felt like it could be made slightly more convenient (since I usually don't feel like walking ALL THE WAY to the station and spend a cap or two to do it instead)
---
and the tinfoil one also,  for some reason is an underarmor
---
You on?
---
That's one of the main problems I'm having. I have a T51 with a jetpack and found it's pretty useless since I already have marsupial and I don't want to lose it. It would be nice to at least be able to sell it. Or modding the tesla rifle which takes a lot of crystal which is scarce right now.
---
How petty... downvoting me for correcting you lol
---
I can say that I spawn into the same spot 75% of the time... and then 25% is in 1 other spot... but I dont change my house or location
---
Use the fo76 map website for PA locations, go there and check if it haa the right parts. If not, don’t pick ‘em up and server hop. The trapped garage below mama dolce’s is an easy spot to server hop (for example). Its how I got most of my T45 and T51 pieces.
---
Console stores the photos in the games installation folder. (I think)
---
If the game is updated, you risk losing them (though it hasn't happened to me yet but has many others)
---
If you uninstall, all photos are erased. Period.
---
PS, same.
---
This 50 photo limit is also a console limitation.
---
They are also looking into expanding the max.
---
Happened to me a week or two ago. It’s good that their stored, but a bit of a bummer that they don’t show as load screens anymore. PS4 btw.
---
It’s summer the kids are out of school and bored... just my theory probably wrong
---
My biggest gripe with heavy guns is that the guns themselves clip through enemies in melee range and thus shoot through then leaving them unscathed.
---
Seriously I have to jump and back pedal just to be able to hit them because unloading 500 rounds into their chest just kills the tree behind them.
---
You guys clearly are not very patience or engaged in the building aspect of the game. You can do so much in this game. I've built bunker bases, tree bases, bus bases, floating bases (no staircase), and even underworld bases (under the map, dont tell my mom). I even made a base in a sewer pipe i found once :P it just takes a lot of patience and creativity to get things to work. My latest base on my pvp character i built a fancy bathroom that has a secret entrance to the real base. Cause why not.
---
I sent you a message.
---
I kinda feel like the machines are only at train stations to force you to fast travel.... Which sinks caps.... And we need more cap sinks.
---
Twitter, Reddit, whatever platform - if someone Interacts then the very least I do, out of curiosity, is look at their profile and spend 15 - 20 seconds glancing through their "comments" or tweets or whatever.  If the person is particularly interesting because of something such as : political views, shared hobby, weirdly similar philosophical outlook on life, or, professional "networking" potential, then I will "friend request" at them.
---
I dunno if that's I particularly weird or not, but it's certainly not Evil or sinister.
---
I've known since I was a little kid that I was "weird" and different, and bored at school - I often did "badly", but tested high.  I got like 100% on the "High School Equivalency" test when I was in Junior High - the Superintendent of my school system wanted to see if maybe I had a learning disability, and that was why I was always having trouble at school.  Nope - they said "well that rules that out" and basically too bad, so sad, but there was nothing to be done for me other than : "maybe he should try some Honors classes to see if they could be more engaging?".
---
I used to be pretty smart, but I probably needed some Ridalin (and never got it), I was finally diagnosed with ADHD after failing out of college.  I was fluent in at least 7 computer languages, I debated philosophy with adults when I was about 10, I lost points on m my calculus exams for using "forbidden knowledge" when I was simply doing what seemed obvious.
---
But, I think I've had several TBIs, burned my brain out on rediculuos amounts of pot smoking (made Cheech and Chong look like ametures, TBH).
---
Then I wrote a short story which I pitched to three employees of John Gaeta's company Mass Illusion, in 1995.  They never asked permission, or gave me credit, but they turned my story into a movie called The Matrix.
---
3000 caps per 100 pounds, can be purchased 1 time per week, up to 20 times. That would be fair because caps are easy to obtain.
---
I'm level 17, I'll be on shortly. My GT is "Sodium Peroxide"
---
All pve enemies suffer 0 damage from radiation.
---
"Can I have more information?" "Bah! You wouldn't understand"
---
Make the STR bonus additive, rebalance the mods, and increase movement values. PA shouldn't be comparable to armor, it should be a conscious build choice.
---
Jetpack serves one purpose for me.  It looks badass.  Wether I use it or not, nothing else in this game is as visually whoa.
---
Can only recommend it. For beginners as for wasteland veterans - a nice additonal infos, hints and unmarked locations for sightseeing.
---
I truly doubt Bethesda would ever actually put this into the game.
---
How much damage are you doing with the gauntlet?
---
If I was on Xbox I'd just mod your suit for ya but I'm on PS4
---
My friend gave me some direction for a Sentry Bot after he read this, I'll add it soon once we have talked it over :)
---
I didn't claim that Bethesda put it into the game.
---
&gt; Issue: Brotherhood Officer Underarmor missing material swap in some instances.
---
What does this mean?  Concerned BoS officer underarmor user wants to know
---
That would be fair considering most would get their caps via vendors, stealing someone's crops with green thumb or water farms or farming things.  
---
Either way I'd love to pay for something useful other than the usual bland items.
---
I still need a few of the go-to perks like nerd rage, but even with my build not totally done yet I was doing 1000+ during a queen fight with food/chems and ~30% health
---
I love to get feedback from everyone I can before I send over a finished piece like this, and I've already been given some both on this thread and on my discord server. 
---
Once it's complete I'll post update it here and send over a finished version :)
---
Yes a bit of thought in what you take
---
Again. Because the truth hurts. 
---
This game is social and it has an economic element, which atm, is being grounded down into a freebie welfare state bs that basically ruins the economic aspect- just like it does irl. 
---
If you want it, go work to get it and quit trying to get free.  Lazy as fuck
---
Well it's stupid either way.
---
nah bro im on ps4 and its x-01
---
It's really a pain to get. I always check areas dude spawns if I'm in the general area. Only ever saw him the one time at the giant teapot.
---
thanks dude
---
Says who? Some random cry baby on the internet?
---
Mr Floopping Pig, do you happen to have a quad ammo auto Tesla rifle at your shop? I'm willing to pay nicely for. Where on the map are you located? If you mentioned it, I missed it.
---
👍😁
---
Turn it to scrip again. Berserker's is useless on heavy weapons.
---
I'll update it to " 我们不能停止 " (we must not stop).
---
Wasn’t me, chief
---
Welp Guess that answers it
---
I'm hiring enterprise architects.........
---
Yea man! We even have this 6969yo guy who’s like the best gamer ever lol in all seriousness we have 200+ members and are a mature group aha
---
Thanks, man. I'll be trying to work on a vid to post here and other places. Try to let everyone have the opportunity for a town vibe
---
#I floop the pig!
---
I'll add a disclaimer stating they can use this. :)
---
Probably around 2k .. can’t see many using that combination of no armour for berserker and explosive rounds lol won’t end well
---
So, you look a bit all over the place there
---
What exactly are you trying to focus on? Melee or guns?
---
Are you using VATS at all? Or only manually aiming?
---
[This one made me laugh](https://imgur.com/a/CGuFaoe)
---
It is, had to reinstall last week. There's a save folder called player data or something along thpse lines that has them. If you delete it only on the console, all of it, except for your photos, will be redownloaded when you log back on. I'm just happy that's the only thing you lose honestly, I was surprised it kept all my settings.
---
He has the best plans
---
Sadly I'm not but if a position for a content creator came up I'm sure I'd apply.
---
People appear to not like our ideas. I think you have a good idea that could be improved, and I don't see why others don't like it. No one suggested atom shop and it's only requirement I'd caps which are so easy to get mid to end game.
---
That's exactly what happened to me except I was harvesting fire caps and boom I'm dead. I was irritated of course and when I attacked back he took no damage and then instantly one shot killed me again.
---
I'm so sorry to get your hopes and then dash them away, maybe one day this will be a reality.
---
It’s kind of an even split. I usually approach populated areas stealthy, try to pick off a few with headshots and entice the mob, then melee everything that comes charging. I don’t go through a lot of bullets either which is pretty convenient and I’ve actually been surviving better against the imposter sheepsquatch than when I was a power armor build
---
You overslept and left the vault late, pity it didn't happen the day you entered.
---
I think you're shooting yourself in the foot trying to be a hybrid.
---
1000 caps for 100 pounds is way too low imo, plenty of us are running around with 20k in our pockets and heaps of stuff waiting to sell. 1000 for 10 pounds maybe, considering how valuable stash space is and how it would be a permanent upgrade. Either way, it's not a bad idea, but it seems that the local downvote mafia is already passing through
---
The strategy you are using in workshops is setting you up for frustration.  The first step is recognizing that your true enemy are fellow players, not the computer generated enemies.  Step 2, take workshop at get the hell out of Dodge before the computer generated attack, there will be plenty of time later to retake it when your fellow player is not lying in wait.  Step 3, return to workshop some 15 minutes later, retake, build a couple of things, then vacate.  Repeat steps 2 and three as you farm other places.  Good luck.
---
Righto, well, to start, you can open up points here;
---
Suppressor &amp; tenderiser are both wasted in anything resembling a bloodied build
---
So where can I sell all the weapons and armor? If as you say, I dont have to wait longer, I'm unsure where to go to sell?
---
I totally understand, I will work on a few quests (and challenges) that give tokens as a reward as well as the daily.
---
Ps4? Have had this happen to me a few times b4 twice at watoga and once somewhere else, cant remember though.
---
I know how it work but that isn't what OP stated so I wanted to be sure they know how it works.
---
I agree, it's harsh but it's something major for any camp.
---
I would rather have a 200lb global mailbox than increased stash...
---
Not bad, adrenal reaction is great for mobs. I'm kinda on the fence about nerd rage atm, starting to wonder how often its actually useful. I have a mole miner gauntlet that does just under 1100 with AR maxed out. That's with all 3 one handed melee perk cards maxed.
---
Not going to lie this makes a lot of sense. I just feel like when I FT to the club house other players decide to join. If I take the long way to the club house it’s usually untouched when I get there.
---
1400 caps per day is already plenty. You could easily make 25k in a day by selling serums or marine tactical helmets, they have to keep a cap. It's already much better than it used to be, fast traveling around the map getting 200 caps from each of the factions
---
Unsure how I'd get those or make em
---
*adds chance to find dead RadRats at your base*
---
Great idea!
---
:/
---
I wish I had money and the patience to grind atoms
---
I missed three-five shots at 95% point blank several times. The vast majority were aimed at the head. When I swapped to torsos it seemed to improve slightly, but was still bad. It’s almost like when you use an automatic, or some weapons like the Tesla or Gauss rifle where, because of the way the projectile has a weird travel time/path,  VATS sometimes just messes up.
---
Really hope it’s better tonight.
---
I found [this one](https://screenshotscontent-d4002.xboxlive.com/xuid-2535439614426281-private/de57c183-4a7b-4fa1-944f-d4f0b3ca1c3b.PNG?sv=2015-12-11&amp;sr=b&amp;si=DefaultAccess&amp;sig=doetixMjigkgbKOdN0qGbrJ5coMb%2BhDescT7LUfg97I%3D) the other day
---
Take a look a this
---
[You get far more damage by getting rid of demo and jamming points into rifle perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=cd75388&amp;d=s92sf2ss2se2p00pd2pp2pl2pk2ej4c72ir2a00a30am2la2l71lu2cr0ek1a72&amp;w=p10ce0&amp;n=&amp;m=12458cefg)
---
I was surprised that they're giving out a god-tier weapon for the survival challenges. Some of the easiest challenges too - nothing there was RNG dependent, and all of the challenges could be prepped ahead of time by traveling somewhere or getting something in adventure mode first. My character is built entirely for guns, yet this is one of my strongest weapons right now even without any melee perks and without a bloodied build
---
Stash limitations are due to server and stability limitations. How do you propose you fix that with caps? BGS have already said they will increase it when they can.
---
I'll be on Monday. I think message me in the afternoon and I'll get back when I can
---
My GT is UltRraRageous
---
Sadly not, I tried to keep them as defence/support aimed more at solo players, but with some functions team players would love too.
---
Look in train station toilets, you'll normally find some.
---
I can see that. My choice there was to have decent base charisma for selling items and 9 for the ability to share a level 3 card. I’ve also thought about fitting in things like bloody mess/more rifle perks
---
Yea, no doubt. Thankfully, making Ultracite Plasma Cores isn't horrible, particularly since they're only used against SBQ and if I can help it, I try not to use more than 6 per queen. Of course, Super Duper helps in recovering ones I've used.
---
My Prime Bloodied Gauss though, is used for anything big: SB, legendary Sheepsquatch, Imposter Sheepsquatch, Arktos 'Alpha' boss.
---
Everything else I just use my Bloodied Lever Action for.
---
Bloodied gimp still sounds cool though 😂
---
If you sell partial stacks of items they can be glitched to not stack even when both stacks aren't for sale
---
You can't randomly find the Prize Bot I don't think, he randomly follows you and tells you that you've won a prize. 
---
I've had one follow me from Vault 76 to a SBQ fight before hah :)
---
I get why this dude got downvoted, but he makes a salient point related to VATS and Gun Fu. Once you start one shotting stuff, the last several enemies almost always get hit on the first shot. Maybe it’s an example of finding patterns where there aren’t any, but after so many hours using  VATS you can’t help it.
---
Yeah I saved em in case it came back out. I have loads of atoms still, pretty dope
---
Sorry, no quad Tesla's. I haven't logged in to post
---
Guilty
---
Why not just shoot them off then to clear it? Also maybe its the six in the revolver?
---
Added to my list of things to update for when I rework the idea again! :)
---
Wait you can get a camera??
---
I’m glad I’m not the only parent that lets their 5 year old play fallout. His perks are always jacked up and armor is half broken constantly but he’s pretty good at it considering his age and reading skills.
---
He’ll be watching me when I go into a new area and say something like “oh this is the place that has a set of power armor and a mini gun behind a locked door”
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams!
---
To a zerker player that's set up right that's easy 2-5k good weapon. And to the others, most people running zerkers will have fireproof so that bad aim isn't really an issue much.
---
I do enjoy writing things like these, that's why I play DND weekly with some friends.
---
I tried doing that with low level legendaries but high levels snapped em up for scrip. But my camp is next to the overseers and 90% of what I “sell” is ammo I don’t use priced at 0 caps I still manage to help new players some. Experienced players seem to get most of it though 😅
---
If you rock an unyielding set, you can get up to +15 char just by being below 20% hp
---
Also, look into Toxic Goo from West Tek, good way to bring your hp down at will
---
Do you have the blight?
---
Try to get radicool in there at least. Massive damage and carry weight bonus. I would probably dump suppressor, tenderizer and green thumb and get blocker, bloody mess and radicool.
---
Or maybe people just like to play at different levels of immersion? Gotta realize that some people don’t even like base building, but it’s essential to the game and skyboxes are easy to build and defend. You don’t HAVE to put hours into making a base if you’d rather be doing something else. They’re just easier to build.
---
Wow I think that’s really solid! Thank you! I’m a little worried about having so little intelligence and not being able to use gunsmith 5 or craft Grenades however
---
That I can confirm is a thing, and a potential problem! lol 
---
One gets so focused on the Queen that those tiny bars in the right of your screen are of no interest.
---
I understand that, after the latest building patch's it seems to be better but I agree it's not perfect.
---
Changing the pvp scaling of it would be better. Just adding effects now would make it absurdly strong for PvE. You’re practically invulnerable in it vs anything but the big “boss” things.
---
Same on pc. Only viable first couple of lvls.
---
I agree. That’s part of why I’ve been hesitant to go “all in” on min/maxing one sort of aspect of the build and have some options
---
It looks like it's welded to the sides of the power lines, awesome! :) 
---
I'd shop there before it looks cool and it works, what doesn't work is when its three staircases leading up to a few floor tiles that float.
---
I wish you were on PC. Maybe I need to make a character just to make my own "town"...since all three of my characters right now have a home set up already...
---
At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within The Forest?
---
With or without extractors?
---
Bargains are still to be had. I literally just found a camp selling a range of 3 star armor and weapons for between 100 and 200 caps for the weapons and fixed price of 50 caps each. Most were okayish too, the autostim arm and aa vats railway rifle will both probably get some use from me. I restrained myself from spending every cap I had but I still came away with enough stuff to not have to farm for scrip for a few days!
---
Very nice!  I had a similar setup, had a "hotel" a market, a DIY shop, and just a general town hub, but nothing nice like this.
---
mostly the duppers as it would limit the ability to get more sales
---
If you have the lower negative and increase positive perk cards, it pretty much pays off by having every mutation available.
---
I have them all (mostly solo and like to run stuff I'm not max specced for occasionally) but I hate that almost everyone has mutations...they should be harder to acquire and have increasing disadvantages the more you have.
---
Ok.  Cool!  I just got home.  Found out I can indeed craft both left and right arms.  If you need mods for that power armor you got, come by my camp sometime.  I’ll do it for you.  Right now I’m a little low on flux but I will have some in a day or two.
---
Does the 5% increase stack the explosive bullets ? Or just the guns stock damage ? 
---
If gun is 100 damage but with explosive it is 125, is it 125 + 5% or (100 + 5%) + 25 ?
---
Sorry, but maybe you'll see more in the future. This seems to have sparked the same interest in other players and I mean to make a town building vid eventually. I'm sure you can do it no problem!
---
It's not a microtransaction if it's free, regardless of whether or not it's in the atom shop. Your point is moot.
---
That was a bug that should have been fixed with one of the last two patches.
---
If I’m stuck in a wall I’ll place my power armour and enter it. Usually get me out
---
Id give you a tour of all my characters bases but i feel like it will break your spirit hahaha
---
or just sell the plans
---
Are you on PC?
---
My Furious Plasma Flamer and Furious Prime Gatling Plasma thank you for your testing. I knew there was a good reason I liked these guns.
---
This would be OK, but I think that the legendary must be in the box, so that other players are willing to risk a bounty, for looting another players supply drop, so we would have a little bit more of pvp in adventure mode back.
---
me too, stations already in game and notice the small pic on the roadmap
---
Can i have some
---
You should name your first one "Double Dragon."
---
I agree but it probably won’t stop... I harvest all the bug stuff to use for stings and wings and the acid and 9 out of 10 times it’s not anything great providing you can get a hit in but still...
---
You can actually. Random encounter points
---
Well, I don't know about being easier to build, but I can agree that people play at different levels of immersion. Maybe I am ignorant to consider that, some people who may not care to attempt to build a realistic scenery for the virtual world they're in aren't necessarily children. Regardless, I wanted to say it forthright - the floaty bases look stupid.
---
Ah, gotcha, I don’t use grenades, so I didn’t account for that
---
Granted, I picked up shit loads of frags/cryo/pulse, so unless you’re crafting the hard stuff, you probs won’t notice
---
Gonna have to check the vendor bot 😂
---
That's a shame, I didn't know you could do that. 
---
I'd patch that out first and make it so every 10 minutes of play, the game rolls a spreadsheet where if it rolls at 1 out of 100, you'd get a prize-bot with tokens.
---
No on xbox 1
---
Bring some firepower.
---
It’s to keep the upcoming Titans out of Whitesprings.
---
ESO currently has a monthly fee to get unlimited storage like junk and ore but not weapons or armor. The fee includes getting 1500 gold. 
---
I could see Bethesda doing the same for Fallout and giving unlimited storage for junk or scrap but not armor or weapons and give you X number of atoms each month like ESO does which is also their product.
---
My 10 yr old heard that the other day and said "daddy, don't believe him!". I nearly died laughing
---
I’m going to swap my power armor heavy gunner build and try out a bloodied unarmed build. I already have my unyielding gear and my bloodied death claw gauntlet. I also have all the bloodied melee perk cards and enough levels saved up that if I don’t like it I can move points around and go back to pa heavy gunner.  I’m not sure if I’m going to like being a glass cannon. Maybe I’ll like it maybe I won’t. I’ll find out.
---
Duuuude what? That sounds incredible. That sounds waaaay nicer than this!
---
I completely agree, I am in the small minority of people who think PA is great as is, being legendary might make it too over powered.  Yes I am a full time PA heavy gunner, i can solo the SBQ in power armor.  I am unable to solo her on my Unyielding Bloody commando.  I’m sure some people can, not saying that can’t.  All I can speak too is PA and my toon have zero issues with any current content.
---
yeah it kinda sucks as to why these don't just spawn in some where random
---
Pretty generic, uninteresting, samey commentary next to a legion of similar youtube "personalities".  Substitute yongyeah, legacykiller, or anyone else farming youtube clicks with negative commentary.  
---
The phrase "no talent hack" comes to mind ;)  
---
It's really easy to come up with a contrarian "REEEE EA SUX BETHESDA COLLAPSING REEEE!!!!" video and I suspect these posts are actually part of the content creators "gorilla marketing" campaigns to get more clicks :P  
---
I think we all understand that fo76 is a flawed game.  But to site here and dwell on the shitty release and ignore the progress the game has made and the state it's in today is disingenuous and pathetic.
---
I found Anne the tourist this week on the outside observation deck thingy of Landview Lighthouse near Vault 76. You could try there. I’m not sure how much of a ‘sure thing’ the spawn is, but I found her first time without having to do any server hopping. And after tedious days spent server hopping to find my beloved witch costume, I couldn’t believe my luck at finding the camera straight away! I hope you find one soon.
---
Yes!
---
Cheapest I’ve seen it is 100caps which seems to have taken a standard.
---
I feel the same way about this as I do about the legendary vendor. Sure, it sucks to not get the perfect thing you want every time. But guess what, if you did, if there was no effort, and everything was easy to find and get, why would we even play? I just rolled a few caps to try a vendor. I wasn’t expecting much, but I find a goldmine of cheap three stars that left my caps much depleted. It felt better because of all the times I came to camps with the same ultracite plans and massively overpriced one stars and serums. The times it works are special because of the times it doesn’t.
---
This is absolutely terrible and also fucking *hilarious*. Great find.
---
Aww man
---
I just meant the name bloodied gimp sounds funny.
---
I think I could still drop it to 4 for gun mods and nuka grenades and find one more point elsewhere. I think your revisions are definitely closer to where I should be
---
Yeah vote it up!!!! if this goes through and Bethesda will do it, I hope that you will have your tapes still.
---
If they have full legendary assassin's + sentinal's armor, you only have a very small chance of doing damage to them. Best option is not to engage in PvP in adventure at all. To avoid PvP (in case you aren't aware):
---
1. Keep pacifist turned on
---
2. Don't team up with people who pvp or accept random team requests. Your team mates can get you pulled into pvp whether or not you want to.
---
3. Either don't take workshops or make sure to stay away from them after you have taken them. As a workshop owner, you are flagged for pvp anytime you are in the workshop area.
---
If you do all three of these, there's no way another player can hurt you in adventure mode. It was tested extensively by another reddit user a few months ago and I've confirmed their tests.
---
Stabilized for arms or really any mods for arms that isnt only helping melee.
---
thank you.
---
I really dig these ideas
---
Oh isn't that called an exploit??
---
How does anyone kill you in adventure mode if you have pacifist turned on? Are you firing back at them or at them first? 
---
Why not just ignore them?
---
No way scorchbeasts could exist. They are too big and have too much mass to support their own bodyweight. And they never would be able to fly. 
---
Same for behemoths. There's a reason that humanoids (and animals in general) only reach a certain size. 
---
Marsupial mutation could work by adding more fibers into the leg muscles I guess, but you'd likely break your ankle landing from that high of a jump.
---
Bethesda said originally they wanted a more survival style play where you really had to be selective with what you wanted to keep. They increased the stash size only because the players were demanding it. Yes server stability does come into it also but they are also walking that line of balance between the stash size we want and the style they of play they intended for the game.
---
I believe, that approx 90% of the players have these tapes still. The typical fallout player is a hoarder
---
I just expand on my camp. I'm sure i could find a more convienent location, or just use a circle shape made of crafting stations i just throw around. But i like having a steady camp. Wish i could extend my foundations because they float but the design of the house is good i think
---
At first I was like “no” and then I lolled.
---
Carry weight? Lol my unyeilding set gives me more carry weight then anything besides Excavator and that's counting into my weapon weight reduction and extra AP refresh
---
Oh yes, bring war back to adventure mode
---
I’ve got several 3 star legendary weapons. Mostly bloodied or furious or instigating. 
---
To date, my favorite weapon is the BE auto handmade.  As it has a 25 clip magazine and suppressor that weapon is devastating.  Even better, I have a +50 dmg resistance while aiming.  The only thing I have that comes close is my prime Gauss but rate of fire on the auto handmade is ridiculous. Running full rifle perks and tank killer and bloody mess there’s not much like it.
---
How do you drop the items so they don't go in little bags?
---
Like the "infinite" backpacks you can buy on Roblox?
---
Can we have pets too?
---
Well that is the first you have said of this.
---
yeah this is the damage bug.  seems to mostly impact high damage weapons like your scenario.  
---
Nothing wrong with your weapon, it's a game engine bug and making a report to bethesda may help expedite a fix.  They had it fixed for a couple months but it popped back up recently.
---
Again.....I do NOT have pacifist mode turned on. Pacifist mode does not protect you from being killed anyway. Only prevents you from killing other people.
---
Whoa, I did a double post and added to one somehow?!?!
---
What do you guys think of mines?
---
I can confirm Gram had the plan for the metal picnic table, just got it.
---
They cost 3500 with high charisma, perks etc. They're also a lot cheaper off other players.
---
Originally these were meant to be difficult to obtain but now a ton of people have recipes so you can find them at peoples camps all the time, for a fraction of the cost. I'm speaking from the ps4 perspective. If your on ps4 I have a few if needed, but I feel like your on a different platform.
---
That's why you shouldn't assume.
---
It seems concentrated fire is the problem. When I drop that card, my issues go away. I had a heck of a time sniping scorched last night and finally gave up and did manual aim.
---
Yup. Only from the tourist body though so keep an wye open
---
When my idea comes to life, I would suggest that the tapes will get a weight of 1 unit, so that you must get rid of your storage fast
---
That's nice.
---
I give away meds, water, and food when low levels come by my CAMP.  
---
Yesterday a level 13 kid (I know because he had a mic) wanted a skeleton suit (he had the skull mask) I was selling but had no money, so I gave it to him. He was talking to someone (maybe on Discord?) and said: "Wooooooaahh this guy just gave me the skeleton suit", then "Thank you sir! Thank you so much!". His satisfaction was more than enough payment.
---
On the other hand, last week at the Whitespring train station I saw a level 2 with very low life and dropped water, food, and meds. When they started making a move to get it, a level 200+ jumped ahead and got everything, then just stayed close to the level 2 so I couldn't try it again. I spammed disapproval emotes but had no reaction. Hope you've found a way to survive little level 2!
---
Everyone wants legendaries, me too
---
Reminds me of those times playing GTAV when everyone else would get booted from the game leaving you in an empty public game. It was great. All the money making opportunities of an open game, but without the hassle of other players.
---
You asked for our help not the other way around. Next time be more descriptive of your issue rather than being a dick when someone answers you with a response based on what you initially said. 
---
Good luck with the whole dying thing.
---
2 things... 1st... You don’t have to pull anything out to bulk it. 2nd, you had to click yes to taking the workshop and agree that you could enter into PvP and get killed... and ultimately lose your junk... it’s not his fault, it’s literally how the game is and they warmed you. 
---
Sorry it happened and if you’re on Xbox I can give you some stuff if you need it. 
---
My advice... you can farm more materials than the best workshop in the game in 30 minutes than 2-3 hours at a workshop...
---
I definitely think camp build size should be bigger bacause by the time ur building is made there is no room for decoration
---
Suppose if it keeps up I’ll have to swap to railway rifle since it doesn’t get Concentrated Fire for literally no reason.
---
Not getting killed has nothing to do with my post. I know all of this. I want to figure out why I can never kill anyone in return.
---
Add to this: technical data. Gotta love running by Camp Venture an scoring 2 purified waters and 24 10mm rounds...
---
What? Just buy them for 250 caps each off players
---
Good luck with the whole fucking off thing.
---
Happened to me a bit south west of the land lighthouse.
---
Level us somewhat irrelevant. What type of armor are you using and wha is your total damage resistance? A decent bloodied melee weapon with sufficient perk cards can deal well above 500 damage, while ignoring a good portion of your armor resistance. That results in a 1 shot kill.
---
Community consensus was included in the post so I just gave a blank example.  
---
Regardless if they downvote this, it wouldn't matter the point is made since its being seen by the community wouldn't you agree?
---
"one of us is an idiot, and the other is a robot"
---
Didn’t know that. No problem.
---
My mole miner gauntlet does over 1000 damage when low on health and that can't kill other players.
---
I think a 200lb increase should cost 20-25k caps. That would be the cap sink this game really needs.
---
Todd, please keep working on the game and stay off of reddit.
---
Thanks! Wanting plans.
---
Reminds me of a POP figure! I really dig it.
---
I literally took a dozen ++ hits by a lvl 300+ with a deathclaw gauntlet and took 0 damage at White Springs trying to pic a fight... I have pacifist mode on and I didn’t fire or hit back... so I’m not sure why you get killed and I don’t...  
---
Maybe submit a ticket to see if somethings on the backend is messed up on your account.
---
*Its just a thought. As seen in ESO with the whole monthly storage paid with gold it wouldn't be that much of a problem.*
---
Id love for the ability to pay for something more useful allowing me to make things. My entire stash is just filled with ammunition to sell and its going like hot cakes. I just do not have extra space for junk AND space for anything else.
---
I bought 30 Carnivore serums from other people for that price and use it as a bank. Now everyday I'm guaranteed 1200ish caps Everytime I log on
---
Oddly enough found one in Mama Dolce's a few days ago, 1 down four to go.
---
Should be way way more to increase stash space. Like 20-25k for every 200lbs.
---
Thank you, I can bring the materials and some caps for your time.
---
Well, can’t say I agree with the slot machine mentality of the game spilling over into player vending, but at least we’re talking about it. :)
---
I'd slap down a good $30
---
They aren't pay to win but if dupers found a way to dupe repair kits Bethesda would shit themselves.
---
With like 7 perks and the right chest mod your already unkillable in PA even against the biggest baddest end bosses. Yet as soon as j'm in survival I'm melted by FF rate handmades or explsoive lasers before I can abuse the no stim animation. Needs to be something PA can do against VATs. Like a head piece thats a vats scrambler that reduces vats accuracy against you or a arm mod that when you don't have a nade equied you can press that button to smokescreen yourself and become unvats able (animation and effect already in game aka robobrain smoke)
---
I wouldn't suggest that idea, hence the cap on the amount of stash increases.
---
Having a pack mule would generally be a lot better but I wont be making a separate character and getting another PS4 just to do that.  
---
Id rather just pay for the increase via caps.
---
Would be awesome if they had a chance to include rare outfits and other rare components like stable fluxes and the sorts..   would deff make me burn through the huge stack i have.
---
I agree. 20-25k for an increase to 1000lbs would be ideal. Has to be something big.
---
As someone who resigned myself to  having to do this, believe me when I say it was far from my 1st choice.  I really like the error conflicts when trying to put a floor on a flat area .
---
I'd love for this to be implemented considering how much we crafters have in our stashes.  
---
I actually enjoy base making and I'd love for the increased stash sizing implemented like the ESO so I can carry a ridiculous amount of materials.  
---
I'd pay 3k caps just to do that every month.
---
I have 196 of them.....
---
I'm xbox1...can u do it for me??
---
Eternally grateful.
---
That’s exactly the Iron Man fantasy everyone lives out in the previous incarnation of this game - Fallout 4. 
---
We are all waiting for it again.
---
&gt; If you uninstall, all photos are erased. Period.
---
&gt; Xbox, upload anything you want to keep. PS, same.
---
Not the same on Playstation, in my humble experience. You might lose the in-game photo gallery (and your custom load screens because of that), but all the **actual** images are still saved on the console: go to &lt;Settings&gt; -&gt; &lt;Storage&gt; -&gt; &lt;Screenshots&gt; -&gt; &lt;Fallout76&gt;.
---
But of course I do also copy all my games' screenshots to USB on a regular basis, just to be sure, and in order to post some to imgur.
---
I haven’t seen on player vendor selling them more than 500-600 caps max and I’ve been to a lot of them. 
---
Many also have them for 250-350 caps so why is anyone buying them there???
---
I like to occasionally call in a drop and just let the low levels get em.
---
 I do not agree on stopping new content for the sake of stability. 
---
 I do not agree on stopping new content for the sake of stability.
---
First time in months, but I did run a uranium fever where a few people who were working together intentionally killed the supervisor before I could get a hit. But one in what must be 100 events
---
Rowe086 add me would love to check it out
---
Just one of the random encounters like insult bot, lemonade stand..ect
---
Yup, by some tents, don’t remember where but I saw it.
---
* and vice versa for the other fifty percent of the fallout clothing obsessives!
---
Hi guaranteed 1200ish caps everytime i log on, I'm dad.
---
why pvp in adventure mode my bro.  Hop on over to survival.  
---
Adventure mode means you cannot damage anyone until AFTER they shoot back.  So the aggressor is always at a huge disadvantage.  If you shoot me I take 0 damage, meanwhile I just bank a crit, then vat's crit to your face and you take damage because you instigated the fight with me.  So long as my build/weapon doesn't suck that one crit will down you.  
---
That same situation above in survival mode you would have been damaging me from the get go, and I'd never have that safety blanket of taking 0 damage until I respond.
---
I’m on ps4 sorry
---
Huh I have to test, because I learned the excavator calibrated. I wonder if I can craft all calibrated?
---
The problem is more the insane damage you can get to using bloodied and other multipliers. The only defense is equvalent damage reduction percentages. The whole pvp damage/armor calc needs to be redone. Actual DR is useless due to the stupd formula they use.
---
PS4 for me too. I played for a couple hours on my main character earlier today. Later I played an hour or two on my new one. No problem either time.
---
It's because you didn't engage back. I don't care about the dying. I am irritated I  can't kill them.
---
Assassin's gives you a 75% chance to avoid all damage from another player. Sentinal's gives you a 75% chance to avoid damage while standing still. Cavalier's gives a 75% chance to avoid damage while sprinting. Add perks like dodgy and fireproof and you have someone who's nearly unkillable given the right conditions.  If someone is actively trying to PvP in adventure, then they are ready for it and are trying to bait you because they know they will win.
---
So what would you suggest?   
---
14 characters as pack mules?
---
I wouldn't like micromanaging the characters just to get x material or x item or what-have-you.  
---
800 is indeed generous but with the (small or large) amount of players playing the game now a days, I'm certain they can fit this in.
---
Rumor has it Robert Kraft's settlement is not to far away from here.
---
To be honest I kinda like how it is now. I can base shopping habits around quests and go all over the map. And if vendors are inside workshops how many people would start complaining about losing stuff when they lose a workshop
---
Quad on the Single Action Revolver makes it one of the funniest guns I ever used in a video game
---
I decided against that amount because 3000 is a solid number that could be achieved through enough work, but not just endgame trading. Early game 3000 is a lot, so it will be a challenge for new players. Mid game, players know how the trading and vendors work well, so it should present less of a grind. End game, most players roll in caps from trading high value items. If we just cater to end game players, new players and mid game players will feel too much burden to achieve this. Alternatively, there could a different currency players can earn from certain events and quests allowing purchase of stash weight.
---
I wish they it was still like the old days of clearing out each factions vendor. It forced us to fast travel or visit those locations. Now it's just so easy to get your daily limit. Man, that struggle was real but necessary. Now there are so many caps.
---
Awesome, thanks! This is perfectly timed, I just got a furious pipe rifle but couldn't tell whether it was better than my two shot +10% while aiming pipe rifle. Probably gonna get rid of the furious, it's pretty cool but lacks damage during the sneak attack criticals, which is what I need most out of my build
---
If you have an NVidia graphic card try turning off Intel SpeedStep in your bios.
---
I'm ok with the pvp aspect of workshops, I was more upset that he left the server right after and couldn't try to get my stuff back. I mean it's only junk, I can get more.
---
Yes! Since last patch I've been missing a lot more. I noticed exiting and re-entering vats will often correct the problem... Just a bit annoying when it's target 1 of like 7 running towards me.
---
I go out the back door and hit the parking lot since there's almost always a legendary there. And often one or two inside the service building as well. Then go clockwise to the golf club and then work my way towards the train station. I always hit the golf club first if there's no one around so I can get all the goodies before someone else. If I start at the other end, then I run the risk of someone cleaning out the club before me and having to wait until it respawns. Obviously if it's already cleared out then I'll move on and come back.
---
Ya find most for under 100 in personal vending machines between 75-100. Violet always at ridiculous price. I'm willing to pay more but that is the dream price. Some try to sell it at 250 caps. But buying in bulk you can find player who farm it for that reason l. My buddies just bought 800 violet for 80c each because it was a bulk buy.
---
Downstairs theres a dead policeman in a chair the keycard is in his hand, it's kinda hard to see
---
Try put it near white springs but not where everyone else puts it.
