I only look for plans, but occasionally when I’m there I’ll see if there’s any flux or odds &amp; ends. I always have 1-cap ammo in my store, except the .38 which is free. Better than just throwing it away, and I don’t have time for that damn ammo converter.

---
What do you mean „2nd job“? It doesn’t take more than an hour per day, to finish the daily quests. Most of the time it can be done in 20 minutes.
---

---
At what part do you struggle? What takes you long / what part are you not able to finish within half an hour? I’m happy to help
---
You're making a big assumption there. There are several video games where you can manipulate, even program the RNG (Final Fantasy is the first thing that comes to mind). Outside of Bethesda, no one knows how the RNG is actually calculated. The best thing we can do is design and conduct mathematical experiments, which I have done, to see if our hypotheses have any merit. As mentioned above, I have successfully received multiple 3 star Fixers from the purveyor by designing an experiment that tests the hypothesis that server lag produces similar outputs. All the data I've collected over the past year or so supports this hypothesis. Obviously, scrip is time-gated and data is slow to come by, so repeating this experiment a minimum of 30 times had not yet happened. However, if the numbers are truly random (or approximately random) then the results should not be this consistent. Not to pat myself in the back, but I have a degree in mathematics, a background in programming, and am very familiar with the concept of confirmation bias. 
---
Please provide me with your data set, methods, and analysis to *contradict my evidence in a peer-reviewed study.
---
Dude this is a thing?! Omg. I'm playing with the wrong people man. I love this reddit sub. I always find out something new to make this game more fun!!!

They are irresistible to shoot.  I start thinking about how chaotic the pre-war Fallout world must have been when the slightest fender bender would result in a miniature nuclear explosion.
---
Not if you want all steam functionality
---
Yeah, having a build system would be nice, even if switching between builds cost a level, the time and frustration that I’d save would be well worth it.
---
it's literally the first thing on the retired topics list, but who bothers to read sub rules, or moderate this dumpster fire of a sub?
---
I thought you can't claim more than one at a time?
---
Tesla rifle counts as an energy weapon all the charging barrel does is hold down and more damage
---
If they do this they also need to add a bee keeper suit. Oh, and a gun that shoots bees. And by that I mean bees come out the barrel. Alternatively, a bee bomb that acts like a grenade and swarms the target making them go into a frenzy.
---
I still cant do it on PC
---
Please help
---
Gun-fun with a side of Grim Reaper's Sprint, and a healthy dose of Marsupial and you can live that dream.

Lord knows I do.

They would all just hide in bushes though, with one flying through the air.

He seems to have slowed down quite a bit. He's not supposed to reach the end until around mid September. I think it's probably possible to catch up with him, but we won't know for sure till the end.
---
Uoyre   a legend thankyou  ;)
---
All I did was shoot the robot, got the key for bottom floor door, found key inside next room for next 2 door and then found the note in the attic for keypad at the last door
---
Those outfits are part of the shop. They just aren't always available.
---
I use the prime receiver on my lmg in my heavy build, makes crafting a reasonable amount of ammo way more worth the resources.  My .50 is for everyday use, ammo for it is no object.
---
I'll give it a try, thanks for the idea!
---
Yeah that works too.....if the other players know that.
---
I have seen them running around with the ??? emote,not knowing what to do.so i sit on an instrument in hopes they will see the gauge move faster.i still have to get up at least 4 times to protect myself.thats with 5 other players there too.lol.its all good though.
---
Yes yes yes, all weapons and armour should be able to be crafted into legendaries via legendary modules
---
I'm going to try it, thanks!
---
The Incinerating Radboys of Appalachia want YOU!
---
If i remember its getting implemented in the new fall season?
---
Holler.
---
Red Rocket Mega Stop cops a vicious 5.56 spray to announce my arrival resulting in a good chain reaction.

It counts as a rifle, there are not any "energy weapons" as far as perks go

Roger, thanks.

Fasnacht collection already does this. I was talking about a resource like the chicken coop

Something like this

---
Soloing Project Paradise and completing one zone is very doable with an optimized build. Also, it only takes about 15-20 minutes from joining the event to completing it and that includes clearing out all the enemies from the entire facility before initiating the event.
---
Yes I had a mixed set, I changed the urban pieces to forest and was able to change them back, all pieces show 2 no paint options now, they didn’t before.
---
The fas one gives royal jelly but not the rest. And I agree a beehive would be cool but I think given the way Bethesda is releasing collectrons because they only have to reskin with a few dialogues repeated they'll go with what's easier.
---
*They are killing fallout for casuals!!!*

**Posts way to finish something quickly**

*Squints.*
---
Capital G-Gamers run off rager-aide. Nothing can be done right if it's too hard, it's too easy.
---
Gives honey too
---
All I use is bloodied weapons already, this idea would just make me hate the game less and have more fun
---
Honestly I was more amazed with the fact that the gold press isn’t at every train station as well as what you said no Legendary exchange in Foundation and Crater.
---
I’d much rather spend like 3 caps to  go to the Watoga station then the 15 to get to Foundation from my base to exchange my treasury notes and I’m sure anyone built in the north part of the toxic valley or near foundation feel the same about legendaries .
---
How the fuck is killing three legendaries even something to complain about?  That's three runs of Riding shotgun, I even finish it in two sometimes because of extra legendary spawns.
---
Rifle Gaming has a series of videos like that. Cool "what if" scenarios.
---
You're right, some people way overprice items. Others underprice.  And some just use the suggested price for everything.
---
I sell most plans for less than 10% of their posted value. But man, I still sell Fasnacht plans for 400 caps. People say thats too much, but I sold 2 more today.
---
Old world radio 2...on you tube.check it out.
---
They really should make the recipes we've learned through rare drops be like ss armor. Bear gauntlet, sheepsquatch staff and club, the fixer. Stuff like that needs to act like ss armor for sure. Hell you can maybe give the other named weapons some love as well that have 1 guarantee fixed legendary like the fixer, such as Perfect Storm, All Rise, The Gutter, the Pyrolyzer, Black Diamond, Nailer, Meteoric sword or Somerset Special. (All i could remember) Give us plans for those, so we can get the modules and make those cool named weapons usable instead of scrap, trophies or waste of space.
---
Bush Wookie is love.  Bush Wookie is life.
---
there are mods for chems and food already
---
Edit: ohh thought this said backpack not stash. sorry!
---
Sounds legit
---
Some people just price their items at whatever the value says it is. They don’t really know or to be honest they Probably don’t care if it’s fair or not. A few people know what an item is worth based on how hard it is to buy that plan. Or how rare it is, with all the server hopping it might take to obtain it. That’s different. I don’t mine paying extra if it means saving me the time and stress of searching for it myself.
---
You cant stop me from making my combat knives cost 30k😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
---
A single person can collect enough to turn in for a tier 3 friendly and easily keep it alive through the event to get the final boss to spawn.  It'll be the lowest tier boss and you'll get shit drops from the event but its still a guaranteed three star creature.
---
Yep^ this exactly
---
zorbo moves one square a day
---
I create a new character each day for the level up and NW challenges and do them last. Just run to the bar by the overseer's camp and you should level up. Then go play a solo round of NW, camp out in the middle of nowhere, auto level up.
---
Melee works too
---
he started on 30 and moves one square a day the whole time. he gets to the end on the last day. its not very complicated
---
Yes it's laggy for me on PS4 Pro for about a week now, first hits not registering, teleporting enemies, scenery popping in late and about half the frame rates sometimes.
---
I'm on wifi using a 150m/bps fiber connection which is not shared.
---
Describe the most common issue, get downvotes.
---
I love that half of this thread is people complaining that the challenge is near impossible and the other half is people just listing event  after event after event after event that you're guaranteed to complete it with.
---
The first shot in VATS missing is a gamewide bug. Happens on a lot of weapons for a lot of people.
---
Ammo for the lmg can be a time commitment, can make you resent it.  As someone else posted, both would be preferable. Lmg for up close, 50 for everything else. Blowing through a 1000 rounds of 308 doesn't sting as bad if you know it was up close and on target. 50 is easy enough to make you dont worry about wasting rounds, you can just hold the trigger down and have fun.
---
Perks don't apply to stash space. However they don't for the same reason they never will, more stash space means more lag in servers if people start storing more stuff in them. Kinda the reason we are getting a deposit junk event for the BOS to take some load off the servers.
---
Even though it is called a "challenge", this one is essentially still a "freebie" to most lol
---
The only ones that are typically a pain are "rank up in NW", "kill X enemies in NW", and "chew bubble gum". For people that aren't pvp players or are good at NW, ranking up takes multiple several games and can just take a while. Killing enemies isn't all too bad but for me, it's always been a hit or miss if I didn't get myself killed by other players immediately. Bubblegum isn't a problem for me at all but such a specific item can be difficult to get when tons of people end up looking for it
---
NW is balanced like that- VATS only works on creatures not players. But a proper sniper with a good rifle can down pretty much anyone with a headshot- a scoped lever action on a rifleman build does like 400+ damage on a headshot, players only have like 250.
---
Are you right-eye dominant? I'm right-handed, but I fire weapons with my left hand and hold a bow with my right because I'm left-eye dominant.
---
There are no mods for the stash, which is what the post is about
---
I doubt it, sadly they assess cost versus going the court route.
---
I'm back if you still need help.
---
I see, guess I misunderstood the rules.
---
I can see the future post: why was I banned. I don’t dupe
---
Good weapon with the flamer barrel  but like all plasma weapons, crafting ammo in significant quantities is a headache because of copper.  Yes, I know copper isn't that hard to find.  But I can produce way more ammo way faster  if the recipe is steel, gun powder and lead.
---
Nightmare Before Christmas theme would be awesome
---
They are apparently coming in patch 21 tomorrow from what a PTS participant told me
---
Just did it so 100% it does
---
Tesla Rifles are always rifles. Never shotguns, even with that mod.
---
I don’t know how I did it sorry!
---
Lol
---
Any plans I don't have that are decently priced. I'll look for ammo I use. I look for decent weapons that are priced good to flip. I've found quite a few bloodied weapons I've been able to flip for profit.
---
Oh my mistake, I left one of the list. Does it give beeswax? Does the rest of my point of my point still stand though?
---
I hope so.
---
You can, more often than not, complete the daily challenges (sans NW) within 30 minutes. Most of them, if not all of them, can be completed without even leaving the Forest area and, often, can be sped up by server hopping to refresh certain events.
---
At least half of the NW challenges can be completed by simply loading up one match and hiding.
---
Level up, for a high level player, can be done in a few minutes by making a new character, running straight to the Wayward, crafting one armor and one weapon, then mashing through Duchess' dialogue.
---
They don't take very long, they barely require you to go out of your way to do them, the few that do simply encourage you to explore the map. If you don't have time to play a video game try not playing the video game.
---
It's supposed to be coming.
---
PC mod is a game changer. Put in 900~ hours on PC &amp; somewhere around 60 on PS4, it is a serious necessity for QoL. I worry they'll fuck it up still &amp; only give one or two slots, but that said it'd still be better than nothing at all.
---
Didn’t mean anything bad by responding. Was just saying it would be semi redundant as a collectron.
---
I seriously doubt they were able to just shut down your internet. It could just be a freak occurrence. With your IP they can give a general location but the IP address broadcasted to everyone else isn't your actual IP address. For them to specifically target you they would have to target your ISP unless for some reason you have your own intranet, therefore it would have brought down everyone on your ISPs or everyone on the ISPs LSN if you're in a complex that provides your internet.
---
It just seems to be one of those eerie timings.
---
Ive been wanting to switch to pc but i just dont have the heart to start over after 800+ hours
---
Its like the only game i play on ps4 but the mods tempt me
---
If it plays anything other than classical then it’s going to piss a lot of people off.
---
Breach and clear
---
I'd love to see this, but sadly I don't ever see it happening. Hell I'd spend gold bouillon on the ability to separate clothing and armour in the stash box even without any perks
---
I’ll give you a hand when I log on in a bit if you still need it.   My psn is boredomshaman
---
Semi redundant as opposed to any of the new collectrons?
---
Reach for the stars, anything is possible!
---
I would just settle for a ammo box(unlimited separate from stash).  Not behind fo1st.  I am a 1st member and for what we pay besides shitty cosmetics we don't need another one up on non 1st players
---
Much obliged. Psn "Egroegy"
---
They can be used (I think) in a few mods for sheepsquatch weapons. I know for sure they can be made into a throwing knife, throwing quill so to say. They're pretty powerful actually
---
It's like that for every BR you get more points just survival time versus killing as it's survival based not death match. Though by killing someone you do increase your odds of living since they won't be around later.
---
That would be even better! (Not a 1st member here)
---
If they added a .308 receiver to the combat rifle it’d totally be a BAR
---
Plus it’s easy to phase through locked doors if you know the photomode trick.
---
Ive been seeing a few different nuke spots lately. Someone dropped one that covered Lady Janets Ice Cream in the forest. Last night it was Morgantown when I spawned in. My Camp is near there and it was only just outside the zone. Same server I think had another drop later at Harpers Ferry
---
Never tell me the odds.
---
Intelligence has a minor impact (like... 15 more intelligence would have netted you 1-2 more steel on that Minigun)
---
Scrapper has a huge impact.
---
I just started saving my perk gum when I get it, and grabbing bubblegum when I find it in the world. Those 'eat pre-war food' challenges, are a snap with Halloween Candy from Monster Mash. 
---
I'm not a big NW fan, but I've been getting into a bit more, mostly as a hide n' seek simulator. I really don't care for the 'Kill X Creatures', but the Rank Up Challenges, I just use one of my other characters who's a low-level Overseer and continue my hide n' seek game. I actually saw more creatures during the 'Rank Up' challenge than I did during the 'kill creatures', I never felt more trolled by a game before that moment.
---
I did make another character from scratch the other day to do the rank up, and then I just deleted her after I finished the challenge, Yolanda, you are missed, I hope you're able to resolve your weight issues. 
---
 For me, those NW Challenges are the actual challenges. I actually won a match the other day hiding in a bush until the end, I did get the chameleon mutation and that sure as heck helped!
---
Best to use workshops since they come with free materials too.
---
&gt; No dent in an imposter sheepsquatsch, not even in a regular legendary one and don't get me started on the impossibility that is reaching the damage threshhold for loot on the SBQ with a bow.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I had all perks possible to boost damage/armor pen, including stealth and everything boosting stealth multipliers and I still couldn't compare to any other build damage wise.
---
I totally agree with you on the SBQ. But I've had different experiences with every other end game monster.  I've got an instigating 3* recurve and a 3* AP recurve. I'm all in on the bow perks and stealth perks with a side of gun fu and grim reapers sprint and a fist full of mutations.
---
I kill most everything too fast. Like bloodied too fast, but I get to keep all my hit points. I one shot a lvl 68 3* super mutant for today's challenge (it dropped a 1* nocturnal sledge). And that's about par for the course. The trade off being I'm a glass cannon without whatever keeps bloodied builds alive.
---
I agree that bows need a lot of work. Having to rely on work arounds for the guaranteed VATs first miss is garbage. Not being viable for the SBQ is disappointing. Making an ultracite bow and arrows is super misleading in that regard. Not having a bow that works with Power Armor is a real limiter. It's not rocket science to build one out of truck leaf springs and strong cable, maybe with rebar arrows.
---
That’s the bunny
---
I get mad when I see someone charging ludicrous amounts for stuff. Especially when I made a point of coming over to buy stuff to help myself and them out.
---
Why are you selling water for 100 caps!? Monster!
---
Yea and nobody has provided any proof. All i have seen and heard are hearsay and rumors. Just like you. You came here and said it has been on PTS and have absolutely no links to posts about it or pictures or anything. If someone gives actual proof i'm more than willing to believe it and be happy about them adding new things at the same time.
---
The Shielded &amp; Protected Raider Underarmor plan is like finding a unicorn turd. I havent had any luck finding the casual ones either.
---
I was actually gonna write up a suggestion piece today but time got away from me.  Mabye ill do it during the patch tommorow.  I think an ammo box would be great because its all stackable items and as with the scrap box wouldn't crazy load the server.  I also think they should change the random ammo rewards for events into strait converter points(it was lvl 5 just give it to everyone after the season) or a ammo scrap that you use at workbenches. You could even add flux to set amount of ammo scrap and make ultra ammo.  The 17 .44 shells are just a pain in the ass.
---
Not a bad idea. I have several of the plans.
---
Pretty sure I don’t have raider though; I think I had to pay someone to mod that for my rifleman.
---
Powerful? At level 2, sure. Like all throwing weapons They don’t scale, and they do the exact same damage as a throwing knife, with a pitiful poison DOT.
---
Just did the same and I agree
---
I don’t bother going to camps that have 100+ plans. They are all basically mourned head plans. And the very few ones that might be something else, most likely know it already. 
---
Now I just look for ammo. Since my bloodied pump shotgun has become my #1 weapon of choice. I only switch to unarmed when fighting the queen. 
---
I look for people that have a lot of weapons and armor. Chances are I’ll find something good for myself. If not, then maybe a weapon my friend or my gf would like.
---
I agree on all accounts! They keep adding stuff for us to put in our stash but no more stash space
---
Should be under edit mode, just target the wall and there's an option on top for wallpaper.
---
Kind of function you wonder how the game launches and exist two years later without.
---
I’m pretty sure that you just pick the type of wall (wood, metal etc.) and scroll to the right until it shows the different color
---
Selling them to robo-vendors for Caps is what I usually do with them if I'm too lazy to break them down into Bone (not that you need Bone for much).
---
Ultra_light mode too I hope!
---
What do you find to be reasonable for feed the people stew? Recently went Herbivore and don't have any need for it so I've been selling it.
---
Oh god
---
Of course they won’t. Police don’t have time to waste on this trivial shit. The guys WiFi going down was probably just a coincidence.
---
That's news to me. I've never heard any official announcements or even datamines of this, so I doubt it.
---
I think legendary perk card progress is shared between characters, so you could sell your perk cards on your other characters. Also starting new characters that level faster might be a thing to farm perk card points for legendaries. Don't delete your characters.
---
He’s not going faster, you’re just slowing down- each level of rank needs more SCORE than the last. Best bet is to grind XP with as much XP boosting items as you can find.
---
I got a  Yao Gui hoard when I logged in. Nailed that one down first thing.
---
I did, on the pallet wood icon, the atom icon is red and when I try to use it, it pops up the big game hunter bundle
---
Been waiting and server hoping for 1h and none of these events has started. This is why I say those challenges annoying, I don't have the time or the patience to keep on waiting for these events to pop up. As matter of fact, I haven't seen them in a really long time on the map.
---
If I remember correctly she briefly mentions it somewhere when shes is at VTU with you but I did this a month or so and forget.
---
Ahhh damn, I hope you're wrong. Got my hopes up.
---
Lol it was probably just a coincidence if anything but these people think the police should be involved.
---
For the clean sink, here’s a tip I was told. Hold down to take a drink from it. Then spam the collect button. It makes it so much more useful. It’s not perfect but it does work.
---
But won't those bees just be killed by legendary giant murder-hornets?
---
Doubt it lol it would have been all over this subreddit weeks ago.
---
Lol! It’s supposed to be a *challenge*! Be glad you weren’t here back in the day.
---
Daily atom challenge: take a picture of a player wearing sunglasses in a nuke zone or rad storm.
---
Yes, that was an actual challenge
---
I like it too. I've been rewarding those curious enough to visit my Ash Heap camp with recipes and plans for 10 caps and free meds. Major kudos to everyone who has visited--not a single person has bought up all my stuff to sell for a higher price elsewhere. Though one level 192 guy did take all the meds and not leave any for anyone else.
---
Lol okay.

---
Obviously numbers are hard to tabulate when nobody publishes accurate totals but the point stands.
---
Be prepared to be trolled. Most people who are friendly to others will not hesitate to start lock picking and stealing all your stuff also trying to lure you into PVP and destroy your camp if they see it in the open. Many figure if you're going to blatantly glitch and not even try to hide it then you're fair game. I have friends that did this to someone that had 5 ammo machines in the open (he had his vendors in an underground camp but the obviously glitched machines right up the top next to the spawn point for all to see. Though with 5 ammo machines and selling ammo at 2 caps each yeah I don't think that guy was trying to make friends.
---
Reavers in 3 also had that annoying ranged attack where they would throw chunks of their own body at you, I don't miss that.
---
Not in the way that the first never hits.
---
Other weapons might hit sometimes on the first one, but the bow NEVER does.
---
No matter your build, switch out cards for the fast travel price reduction if it is that big of a hit on your wallet and then switch it back when done traveling. Easy peasy. 
---
Also, the money you spend in caps can be easily gained back by selling items to a vendor.
---
All of the NW updates lately haven't been announced ahead of time. Besides the events.
---
I'm pretty sure the last map that dropped came as a surprise too.
---
I'd gladly pay more for less garbage options or weapon effects that are worth building around. Why do 4 and 5* exist when they still don't exist. Buggy effects add variety that design forgot.
---
Tesla rifle is really your best option. Nobody likes the auto grenade launcher players, I’m afraid.
---
They also think killing a 3* legendary is a hard challenge, zing! Also LOL at the police we are so ill equipped for cyber security that my state is basically sucking people off to go to school for it.
---
&gt; Having it scale with your Strength stat would be good.
---
That would be a dream for all those unyielding bloodied. Just imagine running around with 35 Str and killing everything twice over.
---
Not to mention he's still broken for a lot of players. I haven't gotten any Smiley gold on any of my characters in weeks.

I actually found a vendor on PS4. His entire store was full of shielded armors. It varies from BOS, raider outfits, road leather, flannel shirts, vault suits, marine wetsuit, and a bunch more. 
---
They were all priced at 2,500. Which I found to be a decent price. I personally only crafter 3 shielded underarmor, my BOS underarmor, my enclave underarmor, and now my secret service under armor. I just gave the one I didn’t need to my gf and my friend. Under armors aren’t on demand I n my
---
Opinion. Since everybody could make it. Yes it takes flux. But theoretically speaking, anyone can go and get some. It won’t be easy. But it can be done. 
---
I could make about 30-40 shielded underarmor with all the flux I have in my scrap box. But for what? To make caps? I’m always at max caps. I don’t really need them. And whenever I do spend caps, I get it back simply by selling weapons to the vendor working 2-3 days.
---
It’s a glitch since launch. It doesn’t seem to be reliably reproducible so it’s not a priority on their bugfix list.
---
Basically if you’re reloading one gun, but switch to another right when you finish, depending on server lag, the reload capacity of the first gun gets applied to the current capacity of the second gun, up to the amount of ammo you were carrying for the second gun. 
---
You must have reloaded a Minigun, and had at least 500 shotgun shells on ya. 
---
The lag part is the key and why it’s not really exploitable, it’s really hard to *make* it happen.
---
And migraines.
---
The Queen and Encryptid need to be player initiated.
---
Wait til you get fireproof 3 perk so you can run right up and punch them with no damage 🥳
---
Yup. It’s not meant to be done In a NY minute but takes time. It is to encourage you to do events and what not. I always have more then 20 treasury notes to turn in at any given time, but you will get there

There you go, it's for a different game that relies way more on RNG than this game does. RNG is RNG is RNG is RNG.
---
3 out of 5 rolls is not even a legit sample size.
---
Down voted for bursting their bubbles lmao
---
That's not a bug.
---
I haven't had much luck with them, but chem recipes will sell, and serums tent to sell pretty well.
---
I tried to sell it late last year and I gave up because I wasn't selling it fast enough not even for 200 caps a piece, so I let them on my vendors until I needed the stash space and then I just gave the 3 or 4 I had to new players in Flatwoods...
---
It's true I went to the unyielding server last night and got 1 unyielding out of a sample size of 1!!!!
---
Idk youd have to test it because i never use it. I would imagine so, but really have no idea.
---
Edit: that being said the snowballer doesnt take that long.
---
Its been a while since I played, but IIRC they weren't much danger unless you let them get close and in groups. If you leveled up energy weapons early enough and managed to get a laser rifle or plasma rifle early enough they were basically not even an issue, or if you got your hands on a minigun they were super easy and even easier if you had power armor.
---
Neat, of course knowing that, it’ll be fully patched tomorrow, lol.  I’ll definitely try though when I get home.
---
That makes it worse, doesn't it? I get it, it's a challenge, but as a daily it won't be always easy to get it, if it was weekly, I wouldn't be complaining.
---
Back in the WOW days? Okay, everyone has to pay for FO1st to play ‘76.
---
Is that what you want? Because that’s the WoW days.
---
Hi all
---
How can I tell what I got ?
---
I started just before the Last Double XP rewards, got to level 44 before it ended last week (or week before) and am now at Level 55 NW.
---
1- How do I know MY progress ?
---
2- WHERE are these rewards ?
---
3- I heard tomorrow's patch they remove them all ?
---
can someone Help ?
---
thankl you!
---

---
Other BRs are not a side mode attached to a main game. They choose to have adventure mode rewards locked behind NW, so they should also ensure that people don't ruin the mode by AFKing en masse just to get the rewards
---
Minecraft made my 4x4 square mud hut a location in Minecraft, not lying, I swear.
---
Seriously.
---
Yeah, it seems much more consumer-friendly to charge a one-time purchase for a year or two of content than to change the entire game design to encourage MTX and daily log-ins.
---
I sell those when I have space. Mostly BoS, Casual, and Raider since they're rare.
---
Sadly my vendors are off due to max caps and nothing to spend them on (I have every buyable recipe and plan already, just haunting player vendors for the super rare now). 
---
Xbox
---
Same thing happened to me bro.  im on ps4.  SinistrMark.   I started "I am become death" and it completed when someone launched a nuke while i was at the  purveyor.
---
 So I was gonna launch one tonight on my private.  Its been my goal to run a silo and kill the SBQ solo.  Im brining my magic lmg just in case time gets short with her. i figured magic guns might get fixed finally tomorrow.  Good Hunting!
---
It's funny that you mention Warframe because the criticism leveled at them, frequently, is that they keep making new things to grind for but the grind is simply not fun and, at least with the open maps, actually disconnected from the rest of the game so choosing to grind there halted any other progress you were making anywhere else.
---
They even daily cap the faction reputation system and sortie system. When raids were a thing those were capped, as well.
---
Let's also not forget them nerfing synergies between frames to make grinding take longer, frequently introducing new materials that only apply to a few items, or the prime system literally requiring you to grind for a relic (up to 20 minutes for a small chance at the relic you want), grind for traces to upgrade the relic, then open the relic in hopes you don't have to repeat the process, amongst many other questionable decisions (having to log in 1000 total days to get every log in reward, for instance).
---
But they aren't 76 so they're automatically better.
---
Fast travel mat under misc
---
I do agree if you're going to AFK at least turn fill team off. Still games gonna have AFKers till they put an anti-afk script in and seeing as how this is just a tact( or is it tacked) on mode for getting rid of survival I don't see it happening.
---
Bring back survival!!
---
Yes it's been broken since Wastelanders and it longer affects tick so you can't really farm them
---
... I don’t understand how you managed to make it to reddit and post about it without, you know, actually trying yourself?
---
You can/should be able to easily complete all the dailies in 1 hour, two hours tops.
---
Every day, the dailies give 2.5k score
---
Each week, you have another 7~ weekly challenges, which averages 1k per day. Each weekly challenge generally takes about 15 minutes to complete.
---
So, 3.5k score in under 2 hours is the norm
---
You buy the floor on accident?
---
Yes. Since Fallout 3
---
High intelligence build and perks on building teams running around doing high xp events and areas tend to do well
---
Interesting, I haven't had it happen a single time yet and I followed all the advice relating to the previous bug (no NW/atom shop/game board), but I am sure my daily ritual involves opening the map and checking challenges right after logging in. Could maybe be that I'm playing on a SSD and it takes a shorter period of time to load in the world? But I'm sure I check it within 30 seconds of loading in
---
"The best part about Fallout 4 is downloading mods so I don't have to play the game."
---
Playing 30min-1h hour today, and 30min-1 hour tomorrow is still 1-2 hours of game time. And will result in more than one level. Grinding for that weekly is pointless.
---
I do. It sells quick and I can never keep it in stock.
---
Yeah, 2 in a row of anything is not a significant pattern here. With armor, you have something like a 5-10% chance of getting the same effect twice in a row
---
Not sure if it's "fair", but I put it in the machine at 20 caps and it seems to sell fairly quickly.
---
Bet, ill check it out when I get on qt some point on a day off from work
---
Possible, but I have seen it happening while looking at the map screen as i stated. If the major actor in this bug is loading time, ssd and high speed connection on a minimal population world may be the difference. I have the standard xbox hard drive, so not ssd that i am aware of. I used to have the game loaded on an external drive, but found less lag and loading issues when it was on the internal drive.
---
If they do, I really hope it's Watoga
---
It's not a public event so it doesn't pop on screen. You can trigger it once an hour on each server. It has a guaranteed legendary boss in the middle so it's worth running if to need to knock out a kill a legendary score challenge.
---
There's seriously nothing to I Am Become Death except listening to the recordings in the Enclave bunker's military wing and then going through a silo and launching a nuke. You aren't missing anything that you wouldn't experience just by doing that on your own.
---
I run it too. I have 5 intelligence because I need to be able to use gunsmith at top level but when not modding weapons and after putting on nerd rage I have no idea what else to use so I run a level of pharmacist and a level of scrapper. I usually share scrapper in a public team if someone’s already sharing escape artist and strange in numbers
---
That's crazy, it would feel so weird for me to shoot that way. Just like it feels off if I shoot a handgun with my left hand.
---
Probably because a lot of people have the shielded SS underarmor that outclassed everything. 
---
Its the same reason I dont jump to vamp that have tons of armor for sale. Whats the point when i have a full decked out unyielding SS armor set
---
Not even team fill, they're just as bad solo. BRs are designed to be tense silence with occasional flickers of excitement when you find somebody. That barely ever happens when half the server is afk. There is no tension when there are 30 people alive and you know 10 of them are sitting in bushes
---
Question...  when you find another BW in a bush do you ambush kill them for XP or do you respect the skill to crouch and be perfectly still and move along?
---
Not likely. The only NW change we should expect tomorrow is that they will likely deactivate all the old Halloween and Christmas challenges that were incorrectly active these last few weeks. Glad I finally unlocked that fur lined jacket and I'm so glad I didn't waste my time over the holidays.
---
Yes, that the first never hits. It's a gamewide bug. Feel free to look for the many, many topics regarding it in this sub.
---
And then those who are more focused and geared towards PVP would most likely take and hold them, gaining a massive XP boost while the regular joe soap with no interest in PVP loses out.
---
I'm all for xp boosts - but they have to cater to the player base as a whole and not those solely out for PVP.
---
You don't want 7 mole miner gauntlet plans or 3 chemistry work bench plans at 100 caps each? Miss me with that
---
Running in PA is intentionally slower iirc. Maybe pick up speed demon mutation if u don't have it already
---
The gauss and all guns with ‘bullets explode for area damage’ major effect. Using any of them could potentially kill the user if the enemies are too close.
---
Works for the water pump too.
---
For real, theres just so much potential !
---
So after you read the terminals there's nothing else MODUS says? It seems like a pretty abrupt ending. I'm left with no other active quests now.
---
And yes this. Fairly certain over 90% of us are just doing this, I know I am. As of late, every camp I run into seems to have their head up their ass with pricing. Charging more for basic, found common items than I can buy them from a bot vendor. 500 caps for chemistry bench? 100 caps for a mining helmet?? Wtf? I even saw a 300 cap lvl 5 golf club, at a camp near Whitesprings. Dude, seriously? I can walk ten feet and pick one up for free...
---
PVP is just who's better at drink quanums whilst hopping with a Tesla Rifle
---
Exactly!
---
Encrypted should totally work!  Just make sure you shoot the short sheepsquatch that fires lasers out of its face.
---
"I HAVE RETURNED FROM THE HEAVENS TO LAY DESTRUCTION UPON YOU"
---
"ZING"
---
Armor Display Stands are already in the game and have been hacked in already. Bethesda just doesn‘t release it for no reason.
---
Killed sbq twice a 3 star mirelurk queen and a random scorch commander.
---
Got credit for the quest killing a hound.....but at least it dropped 2 star legs.
---
Dog food (10c ea or less)
---
Psychobuff (if it’s cheap, I already have a lot)
---
Ultracite ammo (.308 , 5mm, .50 cal, fus/plas cores)
---
Fusion cores (100c ea or less)
---
Junkies explosive/ffr heavy weapons (almost any price)
---
Any weapons/armor I can flip for a profit
---
&gt;!modus doesn’t say anything!&lt;
---
You can still launch a nuke and you’ll get a quest once you head into one of the silos
---
It is pretty anti climactic
---
In addition, ensure you are taking advantage of the available bonus XP available to you. For example is you have the carnivore mutation then you should be cooking up some tasty squirrel stew for a 20% xp bonus, sleeping for the 5% well rested bonus etc.
---

---
You would be surprised about the number of other bush wookies encountered along the way. It’s kind of an unspoken rule to leave each other alone and find another bush. Plus, fist fighting can get some unwanted attention. Time survived &gt; Kills
---
I'm sure you love this game, because it allows you to rain Atomic death upon the dwellings of those that have wronged you at the local Walmart.
---
And yet I stand by my statement. I dont think the majority of the playerbase would appreciate it.  I'm open to correction though.
---
Well, yeah but what about after dailies and weeklies? There is no way to get rank ups without them in two hours - that's what I'm confused about.
---
Thats crazy talk - then it would be a bug that benefits the player so would be patched immediately.
---
I still don't get how the money is traded in for gold, which you then use to buy goods. It kind of makes the money feel like a weird middleman.  
---
I get they want to limit how much you can get in a day but I feel like there needs to be some way of dealing with this,
---
Even WoW moved to rep grind dailies early in it’s life.
---
Not that I disagree with you; wastelanders really made me resent the character locked rep grind and equipment. I have a main and 3 alts. It used to be it didn’t matter which one I played; any “progress” I made (IE loot) could easily be given to whichever alt could use it best. Legendary purveyor tweaked that a little with the scrip limits, but that was only if I was worried about maximizing scrip gain. The rewards were still tradeable, and I could play on 1 char and any extra scrip legendaries could just be given to the alts to turn in, if I wanted to.
---
Then wastelanders hit with character locked equipment and massive rep grinds. Yeah, it started to feel like a job to maximize my playtime efficiency every time I logged in.
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
And by vendor you mean box with an honesty jar on top. Living off the grid!
---
I agree that 99% of people wouldn't like it I was just making a comment on how shit the pvp 'meta' for those who dont know
---
# guys help I don't have nearly enough Steel what am I going to do
---
I turned that robot into a protection, don't need another assaultron running around. Athena's ok though.
---
Lol your welcome
---
Fair enough
---
You're probably right. I'm just really bored with the game now and thinking of anything that can spice up end game. Pretty much the only thing I enjoy in the game atm is Nuclear Winter. Nuclear Winter seems like it's been pretty much abandoned :/
---
I just ran around claiming like 10 workshops and it was a complete waste of time.
---
really? all I get is people making three purchases of ammunition at 1 cap at a time. Sometimes they make largers purchases but hardly more often than they used too anyway
---
If you've done your dailies and weeklies, then you've maxed out for the day. 
---
It sounds like you expected each repeatable to be just as fast as completing the dailies/weeklies, which just isn't reasonable, though it's possible if you focused your build to reach 60+ int, plus 4 lunch boxes.
---
Have you tried going unyielding +1 int gear on a max int character, along with using every available xp and int boost, such as +8 int food, +4 int berry mentats, +4 from building team, plus +8 from egghead with strange in numbers, and another +3 from herd mentality? Try that. 
---
I guarantee you will make one+ rank per hour because you will be making 100 score with every 10 kills or less. But if you're unwilling to go through that, it doesn't make getting 1 rank per hour *impossible* in this game, it just means you didn't spec your character to do so.
---
I feel your pain 👍
---
See i get kindered spirit for 5% and then my well rested is 100% xp bonus. Is that 100% like a daily buff you get from your 1st rest?
---
I don't know man, it sounds like you got your moneys worth. Just move on lol
---
I always keep a bottle or two on-hand in case I need to be extracted from a situation that was more than I could handle. It's saved me some grief.
---
50 is a little behind the curve but not terrible. Today marks the halfway point of the season, rank 50 puts you at something like 35-40% of the xp needed for rank 100 (I think rank 63 = 50%). I wish each rank was the same xp to make this clearer, though it's probably the way it is to incentivise rank purchases in the later levels.
---
Truthfully any event that has large amounts of spawns is great. Line in the sand, Heart of the Swamp, Death Blossoms...There's a few others that I know of that aren't coming to mind at the moment, but yeah. Anything with significant enemy mobbage.
---
No one wants to say this part it seems. Once you get a god tier weapon the game becomes pointless. 
---
Real life is even the same way. People need reasons to keep moving forward.
---
I mean I'll probably come back every now n then but for the most I might
---
Its a really underrated spot by people who don't know how to go for specifically targeted materials I feel. Once people get a run or two in though, they see just how ridiculous the spawns are.
---
I’m still out here wondering why you don’t join my games, jerk.
---
Power armour, no fist sadly
---
I submitted a suggestion for a Legendary crafting perk, let you craft a Legendary of anything you could normally using Legendary Modules. Ranking it up would increase the max stars and it'd start at 1 star.
---
I figured it'd be pretty balanced without destroying the marketplace.
---
When I had the vendors up, sell semi rare plans 100 each, all the outfits, nuke cards, fusion cores, some great weapon rolls \*like the iss90 super sledge for 8k and a j33 combat shotgun for 3. Sold really fast and didn't cost flux.
---
I can craft them all if you have the flux.
---
Is that a "Very Well Rested" bonus or "Well Rested" bonus? 
---
If it is a bonus for the 1st time you rest in a day its the first I've heard of it to be honest.
---
Well rested is usually 5%
---
Veey well rested tends to come from people in your area opening up lunchboxes, which can add mega xp bonuses for the hour.
---
It was better when we could just play and didn't have daily "Chores".  It feels like more of a grind than an adventure now.  I'll still play it, but you are right, it was more fun without all the gold grind/Legendary run/etc.  I could play however I wanted, explore with my friends and not worry about dailies/grinding/XP.   Sure, I could just ignore all the grinding, but then I'd be without most of the new stuff and at a disadvantage to the other players who are grinding it.
---
wonder if this why the bethesda launcher is not loading
---
How do you know what plans you are missing? There is over 1000 plans. Are you manually matching up what's unlocked to a master list?
---
Mods would be cool for sure. Can't risk making it too OP but would definitely be nice to have a mod or two
---
This is absolutely bizarre. How in the world does that even work?
---
I've had it happen, I now no longer join parties from randos were using messages and game chat  only my dudes.
---
Every single time there's a "kill legendaries" daily people post about how stupid/hard/whatever it is. Then the people who say it isn't hard and offer up places to find legendaries get downvoted.
---
I agree that people just want to be mad for some reason.
---
A community who had a character for every platform with the plans on them. You go into trade mode with said character and see the ones you're missing. The rest are scrap plans and bullion plans.

---
Also, DAE feel like the Angler's now have disturbingly fast closing speed? I mean faster than sprinting ghouls.
---
I would imagine that it would be one of the most popular potential inclusions. If you accidentally screw up and one-shot a legendary or something, there's really no way to express remorse at the current moment. I know I've found myself in need of that kind of emote on multiple occasions.
---
Arkos and Radiation Rumble
---
It's not. But you know, bitches gonna bitch.
---
I most definitely would not be surprised for it might very well have been me you bumped into! I am also a good sport and when the player count gets to 3 or less I pop out of my bush and start throwing emotes until I am killed. Who ever has been murdering their way through the round deserves to win it.
---
Very well rested is from lunch boxes, not resting. 100% represents at least 4 lunchboxes. If you go over 4 it still says 100%, but will break and not give you the bonus
---
I've stacked up to 7 once (none were opened by me) because people at SBQ don't know when enough waste is enough haha
---
This is the way I understand it also.  You can sell larger stacks and bank more points, but the returns will be the same for each round.
---

2 shot fatman with grenadier I get hits on all of them
---
Do roses signal strength on mules. Dropped 5th run. You need a mule account and a main or friend to clear out the 2 areas. Don't switch servers between runs (private works great for this).
---
You'll see the first drops will be raider armor mods from what I remember. Noticed the mod dropped changed every time if you stay on the same server and finally 5th run dropped shielded. The casual grinding queen of the hunt with characters that have up to protected learned. Had that drop twice.
---
Yeah that would be awesome, but cover more body than the skins we already got
---
Agreed, the place that has most of the gold bullion that is supposed to be the new foundation of the economy, can’t even give you that gold bullion that praise so much as the savior of American capitalism. It makes little sense how the settlers and raiders have to much to give out, they don’t hold the stocks for it, the secret service does, but they’re the only ones that don’t have it.
---
I say this with all due respect. Bows are absolute garbage. I was quite excited at first, had a few decent crossbows and grabbed every single perk card. Was horrified at the lack of stopping power. Slow and for the most part ineffective. I have a level 35 quad ffr crossbow that I can clear westek with (in stealth) but at that point I could probably use a non legendary golf club. I don’t know what else to say. I hopped they would be awesome.....
---
Ps someone needs to explain to Bethesda which hand draws a bow.
---
I'm not entirely sure about how the technical aspect of this works or if it's even possible, but assuming it is, I would seriously love an emote that spawns a very short-lived container that contains notes or holotapes like the "You've been insulted!" one that the insult bot gives you.
---
The bug happened to me too.  I finally got it to work but I had to go into my inventory and inspect the black box a few times
---
One thing I've started doing is perfecting my jump punch...its when you run up to a feral ghoul in Whitespring, jump up in the air, then time the punch for when you are landing on its face.  you should try it, see if it reinvigorates you...if not, try yelling "Juuuuuuuump Punch!!!!!!" when you do it.  If that doesn't work, run up to the ghoul and then perform the five D's...the key to this one is also in the recitation of the five D's as you do it.
---
tl:dr gotta try to find fun in the little things.
---
I'll be home in an hour or so. If no one else has sorted you out by that point let me know.
---
Oh didn't know about that.  Just assumed the worst.well thank you then.
---
I'd be willing to spend 500 scrip to ensure I get the legendary of a specific weapon. I don't care how long I have to grind for it at the very least it will be that specific weapon. 
---
Spending 100 scrip to get a 3 star board doesn't make me happy or excited even if it is bloodied with faster swing speed. I would have rather spent 1000 damn scrip to get that on AT LEAST a firemans axe.
---
I feel the same. 
---
Do the daily challenges. Do the photo op, the raider and the settler things for 9 treasury notes. 
---
Look at the map and see very few players, and those that are there are sitting about doing nothing.
---
Sorry, on xbone. I have 4k ish wood. It should be fairly simple to walk up to a few lumber mills and collect though.

It’s easy enough to get a level 2-3 animal and just follow it around protecting it
---
Thanks for the advice and all but tbh, I haven't really had any problems with the challenges. I'm a bit of a hoarder so alcohol, pre-war food, bubblegum, I've had all of it on stock.
---
I enjoy playing NW now and then though I mainly played it so I could unlock the ghillie suit. Now, since I'm doing pretty decently with score, I've just not bothered doing the NW challenge unless it's one of the simpler ones.
---
Ad Victoriam Brother !
---
POV: it’s a crisp, peaceful morning in the commonwealth. You call a vertiberd, hop in, and gun down old cars on the highway to feel the heat wash over you. Life is good, relatively speaking.
---
Definitely agree that they're boring. This is more than likely due to that they're adding skins like the SS camo skin to the atom shop and will probably continue this in the future.
---
Mischief night. Had to raise hell at white springs and try not to piss off the robots.
---
2nd job as in its not fun and feels like work. I could care less about the stupid "legendary run" I don't play games to struggle through shit I don't want to do.
---
Huh, wow I’m right handed but hold the bow with my right, was never told or corrected and this way is more comfortable now. 🤔
---
Wonder what will be broken this time. :p
---
The only bow I have that has any use at all is my ultracite instigating bow. But for me to get any damage worth while I have to be sneaking and make a headshot. After that it's just downhill.
---
Thankfully it wasn't get a 3 star legendary item to drop from a 3 star legendary, that would have taken way longer!
---
Also, their "compound bow" looks like whoever designed it looked at a picture of a real compound bow exactly once, got massively drunk on Jägermeister immediately after, and modeled the bow during their hangover the next morning.
---
It's not trolling to punish someone for destabilizing the server
---
I have a machine with several of each shielded outfit (including raider and casual) priced at 800 each, and no one buys them. Considering they cost 4 flux and a bitch of gold &amp; other rareish mats I felt like it's a fair price, but apparently no one gives a shit.
---
If the event will even register the troughs being interacted with, it's a buggy ass event!
---
I always used to punch the thing for insulting me until like the 2nd time I did it he came up to me and said something to the effect of "you will probably hit me because you can't take a joke" and from then on I just let it insult me.
---
Sounds to me like you were damaging their base.
---
SS underarmor is only useful for the strength bonus (end is broken), so unless you're a melee player or really need a few more pounds of carry weight it's not really all that great.
---
Everyone complains about the legendary run yet it’s not even that bad. It’s entirely optional, you’re only missing out on a small amount of scrip/caps/bullion and cosmetics if you decide not to do it... either do it or don’t do it there’s no need to complain.
---
Having to turn in junk to get a rehashed event or purveyor sale isn't dropping the ball?
---
People on here tend to hate PvP. I love it and it’s really the only thing that’s kept me interested in the game. I’m on Xbox though unfortunately. I recommend getting a full decent set of assassins gear and changing your perks to PvP perks. Also the only viable weapons are automatic explosive or faster fire rate weapons. Legacy explosive energy weapons and Teslas are too OP.
---
The first time I got tricked by this I wanted to get back at the camp owner so I drank all the nukashine and promptly died of radiation.
---
I made sure my body dropped a little care package at the very least as an apology for drinking their stash.
---
How I deal with them... go around.
---
Damn ok cool i dodnt know that
---
I can see your opinion I was just saying in general with the overall return of them.
---
That’s another part of the issue: people who play on a team, bloodied builds, and herbivore characters have a huge advantage in terms of farming score. It’s pretty bs that the way you play the game decides how much you level up and how much of the cosmetics/caps/scrip/bullion you can unlock
---
 Nah
---
Unintentional Meat (pile) Week at the Asylum!
---
I cannt wait to open up some of those walking tin cans!

yeah fr, i think it would be easy enough to balance like have it take away or lower one thing but increase another
---
You give Nuclear Winter a whir yet? It's a blast, not /s
---
Another vote to grind helvetia.  There are tons of logs in that area as well as a huge wood pile on the side of one of the buildings.
---
I dont actually run bloodied, but wanted to answer his question. 
---
The truth is if you play 9 out of 10 days and complete all dailies, you will pass legendary run without grinding XP. Beth's 9 dailies per day, 7 weeklies, double score events and double xp event made sure of that. 
---
I'm sitting happy around rank 80. My average character int ranges from 8 to 25 because I don't use unyielding, and I'm still ahead. 
---
OP sounds like he is *behind*, as in missed many days or score challenges, and it sounds to me is looking at how its possible to catch up
---
So anyone think we're getting Legendary Perks as they are?  I'm really hoping the whole Perk coin crap doesn't happen.
---
If you don’t mind quite the thematic leap, the base building in Subnautica is top tier imo, I had a lot of fun with it. (PS4 don’t know if it’s on Xbox)
---
I hope overall its a good addon with worthwhile additions as long as it cant be finished in a day it should be ok unless theres another grind. Im just really baffled by these community events and the "rewards"
---
Shit solid tip my man. If I ever re-sub for 1st I’ll try that!
---
Yea I have I do play that a bit.
---
Thank you for the posts and suggestions. I have uninstalled the game because I thought it was hopeless, but if there is a chance I could get "silently unbanned," then I'll keep trying. I know some here believe it's impossible for Bethesda to be incompetent at something as if the company is a super computer, but I didn't dupe anything. My ban was the result of some crap programming flagging my account for something and then auto-banning me. It costs the company money to dig into my situation too deeply (i.e. every second spent on replying to my emails let alone looking into what happened in my account costs them $xx/hour to some low level employee). Much much cheaper and efficient to ban me when you have 100ks of people playing the game. That's what pisses me off so much: how absolutely they *don't* give a crap. Anyway, thanks to those who posted with an inkling of how easy it is for large companies to be incompetent at any number of "cheap" tasks.
---
They do not give damage numbers unfortunately. I wasted atoms on them. Very disappointed.
---
I'm finishing my last match right now. Scrolling here to kill time
---
I don't really want more ghillie skins :(
---
Same. I really hate when I take a power plant to farm fusion cores and getting the annoying powering up event dialogue.
---
If you are going for building like houses and what not I had a lot of fun with the Sims 4 and just building. I may or may not have used the money cheat.

Also Fallout 4 has a building system similar to 76 and there are a bunch of settlements you can take over and build in. 
---
The CAMP building is one of my favorite parts of 76 and I am very guilty of moving and rebuilding my CAMP many times a week.
---
Edit: play both of those on PS4.
---
Got lucky and killed a 3* ghoul during Guided Meditation.
---
Fair enough. What would you want to see then?
---
I wanted to argue, but in part you may be right. God tier weapons don't ruin a game for me. I have hundreds of hours into fallout 4 for example and the first thing I do when I start a new character is give myself shitloads of caps and some sexy guns. 
---
Then I realized that games I do this on have a ton more story and rpg aspects than 76. 76 has less story to burn through and focuses more on events and challenges. The game would likely be less entertaining for me if I knew the weapon I had was the best one and there was no chance of a lucky drop. I think some events may still pique my interest, but it would definitely be a lot less play time.
---
So I posted this anyway to show my thought process.
---
It didnt do damage, bases auto repair from our damage unless explosive bait still works or if an enemy, player or enviromental, damages it.
---
Guided meditation is also pretty good for one and easy to do solo as well.
---
Building events? Do you mean teams that pop up as public, but their objective is building? If that's what you mean, it's just to focus on an area of SPECIAL. Some team objs give you more intelligence, or more luck. Or more XP. I hope this helps.
---
&gt; How the fuck is killing three legendaries even something to complain about? That's three runs of Riding shotgun, I even finish it in two sometimes because of extra legendary spawns.
---
Because people simultaneously want content to fill 8 hours of play time a day - but also allow them to do it all in 5 minutes when they are busy
---
Legendary perks are coming in September according to roadmap
---
I got 2 at whitesprings.
---
Weapon paint jobs done the same way as they did the armors, except maybe a different scheme than ghillie
---
It's true check the roadmap season 2 starts august 31
---
This should be covered under the DDos Laws. Ask your internet service provider and Xbox Live to report it to the F.B.I.
---
I like the look of T-65 in general. I rock the AO paint on it as well which makes it that much more cooler imo. Not opposed to it having bulkier parts in some areas though. Maybe something to cover that hole in the chest area, all I can imagine is someone chucking a grenade in there and instakilling me. For secret service PA thats a pretty big design flaw.
---
Don’t worry, just relax
---
I drink nukashine and run back to my camp unarmed and punching things. It's really fun and I have spent hours doing it before lmao
---
In my experience it happens with all charged weapons, bows included
---
When my 4yr old son is watching me play, we have to go to Watoga and blow up every vehicle. He points them out and can tell which ones will explode and which won't. "That one has paint daddy. You should blow it up"  Then we get into conversations about why the military ones won't explode
---
Yeah I always wear my old ring and gave the wedding ring to the commander, makes me feel just that tiny bit closer to the npc that makes my camp a little less lonely.
---
"They stole our shit."
---
"Dude, they aren't even all the way down the hill to the campground yet. I can see them from here. Samuel could spit on them if he would shut up about a jawn for once in his life."
---
"Excellent. Fortunately we put tracking transmitters in the--"
---
"Holup. We don't need no steenkin' tracking transmitter, it's 304 feet away. *Hey Raider Thief! Give back that multiscope!*"
---
"*But it's for my grandpa and--*"
---
(VATS sound)
---
(XP sound from killing an NPC)
---
Ever since Vendor became a thing I've not once seen someone selling upgraded underarmors. It's always shitty level 20 wood or leather armor, or some completely overpriced 3 star legendaries. I wish I could get this more because I hate having to get glowing mass or the damn fluids. I hate getting nukes &amp; what not so this would be extremely helpful.
---
Yes. Just don't put a skin on them.
---
Yeah I would honestly like to see some heavy weapons with a Ghillie skin on them.
---
Agreed! While we are at it we should institute these:
---
1) Move Raider note exchange outside.
---
2) Put script converter at Crater/Foundation
---
3) Make Railroad stations free fast travel.
---
4) Add scrap boxes to the RR stations.
---
This might of been me if it was on PC. I nuked the power plant because i got sick of killing people who kept trying to take my workshop. Nobody tried taking it again.
---
Should be, as long as it isn't painted.
---
There are some outhouses in Morgantown that are perfect for this
---
Thanks. Now to server hop for the trader since I don’t have the rep for it
---
This will never happen tho. Bethesda never does anything that even comes close to resembling actual reallity.
---
Radiation Rumble and I never did the battle that never was when it was in the game.
---
I agree wholeheartedly.  This community is one of the best I have ever seen.  If I see a lower level player I usually try to flag them down and give them some useful items that I am either too high level for or wont use. This was done to me early on an I always try to pay it forward. My camp has items mostly at 25 or 99 caps.  Some really rare stuff goes up to 299 but that's like "wester outfit with chaps" or "prime" plans.  Always there to help each other - I like that even if I have finished most of the quests.  
---
Despite the launch issues, its the players that make this game for me.  I am a painter and currently working on a series just for this game.  I love it THAT much!!!
---
I did that the other day. Was playing on my level 7 and they were having a hard time getting Beckett . I never said mine was an alt. They were all in the 20s. They friend requested me. When I said hold on a couple of minutes and I'd help they kinda laughed (nicely). Logged back in on my level 290 and rescued Beckett with them.
---
My thought is their fix to this is just implement more double exps and double scores. I may not be looking hard enough for responses on this but ever since they apparently fixed it the first time, it's been silent.
---
I had a camp there once, built it under the vault door. From my underground balcony I could see the back of the vault door which had a big "51" on it.
---
Hey bro I'm down on legit PVP. No teslas or sent/ass bullshit. Scavver VS Scavver like it was meant to be.
---
Please this. I'd actually turn on my pipboy radio again
---
Yeah that's what I mean and thanks for the tips.
---
Did this today. Got her loot but no credit for killing a 3* creature.  Don’t know what happened.
---
Post your psn, some people will likely hook you up with gear or teach you the ropes.
---
I think you mean public events, and public teams?
---
Public teams give bonuses like xp and stats, also puts you in a team, where you can fast travel to teammates and their CAMPS for free.
---
Public events are like quests where many people can take part in. They give xp, plans, items and lots of stuff when you complete them. They are usually a daily score challenge, so do your public events.
---
As for *dying* and not being high enough level to help in public events, this is fine. Most people don't expect a lv 7 to contribute tons, so just stay alive, hang out with some higher levels at events, and shoot what you can. With only one exception I can think of, events give you the reward for being there regardless of your participation. You'll level up by doing this, and in turn be able to help once you have levelled up.
---
Freaking jerks. Sorry that happened to you, my dude.
---
Huh?  Your public IP is indeed your IP.  go to whatismyip.com - that's your public IP, or at least the IP of your cable modem router.  There are attacks that specifically target the router and achieve this sort of net crash
---
Idk man. I killed 12+ legendaries in 1 hr today. 4 of them were 3 star. 👀
---
I have healing and haven't had any issues with fast traveling. I've had it about a year now....
---
RNG is where player satisfaction goes to fucking die
---
Do you think 76 is a looter shooter?
---
As in the issue where you click fast travel but it doesn't *go* and instead you are just standing there after clicking?
---
I do have healing factor. 
---
But I also noticed that the solution for me is to get off what I'm standing on. I'm usually on a building or in the centre of my current location when I encounter the issue and fast travel fails. 
---
If I move around, I still can't fast travel. But if I run towards dirt (like the proper ground outside of buildings) and stand on dirt, then it lets me fast travel.
---
It makes you wonder why card decks are capped at all. There is already builds that melt everything in insane times. May be an unpopular opinion from myself, but I think it should theoretically be possible to max all the stats. It would allow more people to switch their playstyle on the fly and give a reason to level up. I understand the legendary card system aims to do something close to this but it seems likea huge time investment that most people won't even do. I believe they said it themselves earlier that they thought more people would be interested in PVP but thats just not the case. Therefore I can't see unlocking the ability to max all stats at 15 being an issue. Will just have to readjust damage or enemy health to compensate but I would enjoy it a lot kore than I do now being stuck as Junkie's PA build unless I want to invest a lot of points into respecing.
---
People have suggested this before but people without the mutation have this problem as well. Personally I think it's the root cause also causes the rubber banding healthbars... The server just isn't registering the input. It's probably caused by a combination of laggy servers and just general internet latency.
---
Wtf is this
---
Word. And tie in some kind of tier rankings for armor class, more pvp oriented gear. I guess the prob is in this game character specs are somewhat seemless, as in there isnt any real set class you pick to play out the gate. However, instead of having a one perk per special like with battle royale... Have ppl play their toons as they are in the pve mode. I think that was the startling difference. In pvp like wow your toon would enter battlegrounds with the gear it had for pve, unless you ranked your way up to get the pvp tier related gear, and titles. Def miss that
---
It’s a bug and can be controlled using tents from 1st you block certain places and you get a wave placed right in front of the generator.
---
This was one of the suspected factors early on when the bug first appered (after the fast travel revamp early 2019). But there are people getting the bug even without the mutation. I personally have the mutation, and have the bug occur even if i have afked a good while in my camp.
---
if you complete all the tapes and speak to her (then u can dump all the tapes finally) she also speculates if vaultec choose her because they knew we would launch nukes, she also adds she understands why we launched them on the fissure site
---
I mean, should police *not* be involved if there's a crime committed?
---
It cant be the raw junk form of fertilizer, it needs to be the junk item "bag of fertilizer" to be able to deposit in the machines. 
---
So if you scrap all or break it down you need to find more junk. Weird quirk
---
Imposter sheepsquash too
---
Yeah sure im down just reply when you want too
---
Well i think the amount of items need will only last for maybe a 2 day run...maybe not the 1st as its a lot of steel...but some of the other maybe tricky as people have problems just been tossing or vendor selling...idk...I’m ok with this part being over with in a few days...but when the actual return happens with the new season it better be a better run then the cosmos one. Hopefully the SCORE issues that we have all found will be fixed and worked out for the next round.
---
I didn't even know this was possible!! And i'm nervous about internet strangers as it is!!!
---
I felt the armor ghille skins were poorly done.  What I’d like to see:
---
Raider and trapper armor paints
---
Skins for weapons we’ve yet to get skins for.
---
The much request canning camp item for making preserved food
---
A cheap fridge so the fridge can be made to 90% spoilage decease and not useless.
---
Yes it's a public IP given from your router to protect your private IP address. If all you needed was someones public IP address to just "stop" their internet then we'd all be fucked.
---
I've been in enough parties on Xbox to know this guy was booted
---
From what many others have mentioned in this post, only partying up with people you know seems to be the best way to avoid it.
---
I'd prefer they stay silent than ruin my next SBQ fight.
---
I never know who has met that challenge so whenever I'm near a CAMP, I swing by and try to buy at least 3 things from their vendors.  (Unless they're those people who are charging a bazillion caps for their items...)
---
(Tip:  If you are one of those players who put "real" prices on the stuff in your vendors, it might behoove you to put some ammo in your machines for a cap apiece, if not free, to encourage people to buy from your stores.)
---
It has to be activated by talking to the npc
---
Thank you so much! None of the people who I’ve been played with encountered this problem.
---
You might have dropped it
---
Moving .. actually &gt;.&lt;
---
A link to a song that fits the new event thats being released tomorrow
---
Youve got 4😟
---
I think all else being equal mutations are in higher demand and give you a good return, versus selling something each character only needs one of, but also consumes flux to make.
---
Alright thanks so much. Kinda weird switching to fo76 and being low level then having my 200 and up level account on fallout 4. Where do you suggest I post my psn
---
On this I do not joke
---
Ssssshhhhhh
---
Wrong build, yet I still keep them.
---
AWSOME!!!
---
Building teams give an overall xp boost  while events teams boost xp in events. Can't remember the exact numbers but it's been discussed here before. I usually go with building teams unless I'm going to hammer one event after another.
---
You can build outhouses too in your CAMP. I'll throw a CAMP down and build an outhouse if I cant find a bush. Just gotta hide the CAMP or throw some type of premade building down too to make it look like that's what you built to hide the outhouse your hiding in
---
Well shit. 
---
I’m usually a PC gamer; 76 is the only game I play on Xbox, which is why I started the game on his account back at launch. (Wish we had thought to make an account for me back then!
---
All of my progress is on the Bethesda.net account that I made for him ... does anyone know if it’s possible for me to sign in to his Bethesda.net account on my Xbox account and then get my character, progress, and NW rewards?
---
&gt;: (assuming on PC) don't switch between the steam version and bethesda launcher version
---
i have one account on steam and the other on the bethesda launcher and neither one has had a single challenge auto-complete nor any atoms lost. i know "well it works for me" is really unhelpful - especially for PC issues - but it might just be random.
---
I have fallout 1st but I think I wanna try for the event as a team and see how it goes. I saw both angry turtle and captain noob so it solo today on their videos. So it’s def doable
---
My lord...  Did this the other day!  I started the session with close to 30K in caps, did some panic spending buying PA mods to get it down to about half, then found someone with the exact plans I and my husband and BFF needed so now I'm back up to 1500 after playing today.
---
How about a token system like the robco bunker
---
Edit your post up top and add it there :) 
---
I'm on PS as well, not on right now but happy to give you a few starter items
---
-IF- there was a crime this is just anecdotal internet story telling at this point. This is why private game servers are so prone to DDoS attacks they don't have the resources and law power behind them to stop them.
---
They have public IP's advertised with open ports too to jam packet into. I just can't fathom how some regular guy off Fallout has the power to take down someones internet, especially without any kind of proof.
---
Is it really? Endurance doesn't work? I didnt know that. I thought only +1 endurance on armor didn't work. Oh well i enjoy the strength bonus.
---
I keep mine behind windows for looks, when they are offline, I put display boards over them, turn them off and put up an "out of service" sign.
---
That is how exactly how everyone thought in regards to the final quest, there is a holotape from the overseer that only appears if you nuke anywhere besides Fissure Site Prime though, which you can still launch and collect
---
explosive handmade/assault rifle/combat rifle, shoot at their feet four times and let the tryhards do the rest of the work. i can never time the molotovs right so i went back to basics.
---
Your title small pp
---
Deserved
---
Shit my bad
---
I have always used a Junkie's Explosive .50 Cal as I feel it shredds through most enemies with not a lot of bullets. Every week or 2 I have to craft about 10-15k ammo but with how much resources I have this is never really an issue. However I find myself switching a lot between my J plasma caster and J gauss mini.
---
XD
---
One person had like all these power armor PLANS like an ass ton and i was like BUY BUY BUY BUY
---
Completed it by doing Guided Meditation, jt spawns 3 star ghoul
---
Do not attempt to “make freinds”. Data shows it will be used against you
---
Yeah good luck getting Bethesda to do that. They are still stuck on the idea that everybody wants to grind and wants limits on everything in the game
---
There is a community event starting tomorrow at the ATLAS Observatory. The event consists of players donating a certain amount of materials to unlock BoS rewards. You can find the specific amounts/dates [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details)
---
You must trek through the mountains of West Virginia, killing any creature that wrongs you on your journey. You will encounter vicious creatures and cruel individuals. These obstacles will be incredibly difficult to overcome. But, when you finally make it, when you reach the peak of the highest mountain in Appalachia, you will be granted the one, the only... the Reddit flair.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Actually nah you just enable it in the menu
---
I think the camo and ghille are ugly so I just wear an outfit over top of my armor. As for t65 I finally got it all hooked up with all parts and jet pack and I was using the one we get from battle pass. And using a different on the helmet being I didn’t buy it until yesterday and I was using an ultrice one. But the best thing to put on it now is the captain cosmos skin completely changes it and it makes it look good now. I also wanna try slocum joes paint I just unlocked from getting to level 29 in nw
---
Because the PvE aspect of the game lacks challenging content, and the game was advertised that we can roleplay how we want when it comes to other players. I for one, don't like to be "Mr. Nice guy."
---
Consider that 1 Paladin can kill 5 scorchbeasts before going down, this isn't really surprising.
---
Yes, it does. It replaces the Traveling Pharmacy Perk basically. (Doesn’t stack but does the exact same thing).
---
They even have a John Cena theme song mod for when cars blow up, not that sounds like fun.
---
Doot, doot, doot, doottttttt.
---
When I made this post... yes, I did.  I didn't yet understand how FO76 handled the multiplayer survival PvP elements.
---
I now have about 10 hours into the game and I'm picking up the differences between this and ARK and Rust, both which I didn't enjoy nearly as much.
---
Wow thank you!
---
This combined with the fact that it is inferior to standard armor is upsetting. I will always be PA for life but the fact that I can't carry as much as I can outside of PA is annoying. Don't even get me started on jetpacks.
---
I'm down my man. Hit me up whenever.
---
Not on booze but yes to stims and radaway
---
lol &lt;3
---
I think it gave up
---
Did you finish quest for him?
---
Booo, Brotherhood Of Steel more like Brotherhood Of Scammers
---
Usually after you play a game a whole lot you get tired of it and move on
---
yeah i don't use bows bcause there bad make them good.
---
Awesome.  Seems like a good choice for any character, and not just a junkie.  Thanks for the quick response!
---
I did something similar when I was low level, I saw a scorchbeast with super low health so I thought I would be sneaky and just tag it once at the end to get the XP. 
---
Worked out perfect until the stupid assaultron that murdered it came out from the fissure site.
---
Thank you for saving my atoms. Im sorry I cant give you a part of them back for taking the loss for me. I was going to buy them tonight thinking they would.
---
Yeaaa if you seen my alt... Between RNG and trades from beta days until now... I'm sitting on some major winners. But I still use my BSSS Powerfist and VE 50 99% of the time.
---
If you are on PC then install *Save Everything*  [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148)  from Nexus.
---
I mean, favoriting them gets you most of the way
---
I noticed the same thing. I got them back together.  When I went to my camp to complete it, he was like, Sucks that just happened.  I had so and so do the burial.
---
Maybe they assumed everyone would kill him?
---
Thought they said “don’t count on it being in this next patch but the upcoming one”. Guess we’ll see tomorrow!
---
Good, hopefully they'll scrap the whole perk coin idea before then.
---
My favourites r pòwerful guns for major fights
---
You can cancel shots, though. There may not be a dedicated button but ‘sheathing’ the bow will put the arrow back.
---
This bug seems to one Bethesda actually can’t hammer out. To me it seems devs are actually trying their best on this one and not doing to usual half-assed job.
---
i have a B2525 sitting on my wall of every prefix of handmades, i’ll trade it for a bad bloodied handmade and some other things lol
---
I watched a non legendary gutsy rake down a 2* scorchbeast.
---
Getting a new IP is usually as easy as power-cycling your modem, or from windows command-prompt, doing 
---
    ipconfig /release
---
    ipconfig /renew
---
Went to 4 camps trying to, then decided to clear my own until i found out it already was....
---
I too was very excited but when I got my first unlocked I thought wow this isn’t what I wanted. And I’m glad I didn’t buy perks for it. I have had 3 star bloodied crossbow back way before wastelanders but scripped it being I didn’t think it would be good and I wasn’t doing bloodied back then and didn’t know how good it would’ve been. I have had a 1 star but scripped it and just got a 2 star again and plan on just keeping it and using that instead of the two bows I have now
---
Did monster mash for the first time in 700 hrs this weekend. It was a blast!
---
I went to Whitespring and was walking through that parking lot area where the maintenance building is.     First ghoul that ran at me was a 3 star.     Good luck to me.     A little later I was able to kill a 3 Star super mutant at huntersville.
---
What platform? I’m a bloodied pipe build on Xbox and might have a decent backup I don’t use.
---
It took me months to get the full set, then they come out with this "Shielded Secret Service" BS and make two out of four obsolete lol
---
Only real way for this to work is ddos.  Maybe possibly a direct router attack if it's on default creds or they guessed what router it was based on the provider.  Couldn't narrow down the ops location beyond region though without going through the isp.  Likely coincidence but it is possible with just knowing the outside ip.
---
Yeah in the past week or two i have been having invisible queens, incomplete or just no rewards, and an issue where my 2 shot gatling plasma wasn't doing any damage at all.
---
Edited: no rewards as in sometimes i'll only get queen loot or event loot but not both. One time i got neither when I know I did damage.
---
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks.
---
Plasma Flamer is also a good way to get XP when players with OP weapons do the exploit.
---
Overdrive. Easy ingredients, but the damned plants are always nuked in cranberry bog so I'm always running out when I need it. Radshield is a limited run and far away from camp but I'd buy that in a flash too just for convenience's sake. I'm sure some people wouldn't mind Rad Ant beer but that probably isn't for as general an audience.
---
Everyone from vault 51 died though
---
I agree.  I’ve really felt more engaged in the whole economy and have ended up traveling around looking at everyone’s camps. I also like the team aspect of SCORE. I’ve never been on a team until that started and have enjoyed having people I feel connected to even if only for an hour or two of game time.
---
Level 50 Gutsys near a fissure will easily take down Scorchbeats....same w SuperMutants with miniguns
---
They don't need your private ip to attack the router, just public.  Private would only be needed to directly attack the Xbox system itself.  Internet can be taken down with a ddos attack to the router.
---
Yeah, and not the version where it doesn't work *once*—I got that occasionally, especially trying to join events—but the one where it literally refuses to let you travel even if you do it ten, twenty times in a row.
---
I've also had some success traveling away after going down and outside like that, albeit from having no other option to leave, haha.
---
My bloodied cryolator disappeared while hitting the quick weapon change button during SB event....my disappointment is immeasurable
---
I've said it before but I hate posts of people on this subreddit saying "this community is so strong and is so awesome and nice" but in reality too much of this fucking community is absolute trash and either are trolls or overall just rude people.
---
Blocker in strength.
---
Yeah I focused on the grind/hunt for all the lining plans a little while ago. The only ones Im missing now are the last 2 of the Raider and Casual. Queen of the Hunt seems to rarely come up for me and despite doing many Uranium Fever and other Savage Divide events Im still yet to get the Raider ones. As soon as I saw the SS stuff my enthusiasm for trying died. If I get them great otherwise so be it.
---
I also would love more info on this.
---
Sorry, the answer is no, there isn't any cross-save support
---
Mine was  a 1* scorchbeast
---
They should make claim tokens for the legendary dispensers in gauley mine a thing, random drops
---
Use VATS, that usually helps
---
I ran AA and tse for a long while, changed to junkies....hella worth it. 
---
I was using psychotats, ballistic brick and overdrive anyways with the aa and tse, just junkies makes it much better, not to mention opening up more perks since u cant become double addicted....
---
And u can mod weapon for aa anyways, so junkies is better in long run
---
Marsupial is helpful to get up out of their reach. Its my go to tactic for ghoul mobs
---
Only when my friends are beside them
---
Git gud?
---
Bugs for the bug god!!!
---
Wait....
---
Killing them works wonders.
---
Shit i should check if my bowl is empty
---
Bloodied shredding Mini Gun with Buffs/Chems is a seriously insane weapon.
---
I have been dropping Queens in well under 2 minutes.Often less than a minute.
---
Apologies for ruining the Queen events.
---
Previously i had been using an explosive 50 Cal with 30% extra damage to [scorched.You](https://scorched.You) would think that would be the more hard hitting Weapon.Explosive sounds nice, but everything in this game is immune to it,including most high level players.
---
It does not come remotely close to putting out the DPS.
---
I think the game hates me though.I have been mugged of my flux 3 times out of the last 4 Queens having been sucker punched by that  Mirelurk King or some other critter that does me from behind.
---
I drop the Queen now instead of running for the Booty, i run for cover first,and deposit my Flux in the Stash before returning gingerly.
---
The life of a bloodied player is not easy.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is returning to Appalachia.
---
# only cork can sustain them
---
Unknown plans, looked-over legendaries, whatever ammo I'm stockpiling ATM, underpriced serums random weird shit.
---
Search Junkies guide on this subreddit, there's plenty of good posts. It's a static 50% damage increase, +10% per addiction. Junkies def better than AA. There's a post floating around here that shows maximum damage boosts of builds and I believe AA falls around only 24%? It's def not better than Junkies either way.
---
Yeahh i’ll probably grind xp during this brotherhood thing. Imma hit up westek to scrap guns for steel so i’ll max out my xp bonuses, maybe use a few lunchboxes too
---
Hopefully you’ll fix some quest bugs too
---
i agree, its why i do ~35 cap each, so a person who actually wants can get it, but a reseller wont get a whole hell of a lot more
---
It doesnt destablize the server and also...if you launched a nuke at their camp...theyd just leave and youd have wasted your time
---
Ghillie skins are kinda redundant with the NW event a bit back since that goes over everything. A PA version could be dope but the Strangler Heart PA already has that covered and you can get them with gold bullions so there wouldn’t be much of a point. 
---
I’d rather something more interesting, even that horse Power Armor from the creation club that was made with Giddyup Buttercup parts
---
FYI...items set at 0 caps won't actually fulfill the challenge, oddly.
---
I would if I could but I'm only posting that reminder
---
I don't have healing factor and I only get the bug when I'm running bloodied. Take from that what you will!
---
Thanks for giving more info, I'm not very tech savy
---
Not with the fix coming tomorrow
---
Not everyone did it on purpose. Some people actually friended each other on PS4/Xbox and the randoms placed it in their camp without them knowing.
---
The pipboy reasoning I keep seeing pop up as an excuse as for why it's not being held in the left hand is kind of weak tbh.
---
The pipboy rests on the top of your characters arm. When you hold a bow, you have your arm held sideways, which would put the bulky part of the pipboy away from where the string would be. Not to mention, unless I'm completely crazy and am remembering incorrectly, I haven't seen any pipboys designed with anything that takes up space on the bottom of the arm other than the wristband. As far as bows are concerned, there should be very little issue in holding a bow in the left hand.
---
OR, as crazy as this sounds, we could just remember that this is a video game, at the end of the day, and whichever hand it's held in literally doesn't matter, if a fucking bowstring clips through a character model, it's not the end of the world if that were the case.
---
 
---
With that major nitpick aside, for me, the biggest issue is, and always has been the iron sight. Why is it, that after the issue with the cross-hair/iron sight on the *gatling gun*, that we have yet another weapon that has a completely non-functioning sight?
---
Does anyone else remember how long it took for them to get around to making it so that the iron sight on the gatling gun actually centered on the screen when you aimed with it?
---
How did the sight for the bow make it through like this? It's *mind-blowing.*
---
Upgrade/mod your armor or invest in some better armor. Ideally you want to get around 300 dr
---
Ghoul slayers armor are usually very cheap scrip sales in vendors so you can probably get a whole set if you did some shopping for less than 2k
---
Anomaly detected.
---
It's a fair point that we have the Strangler Heart PA stuff. Unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of the look of it.
---
Oh shit! I should buy it then.
---
No. It does not. Season 2 starts in September. Why lie? Do you think no one will actually look at [the roadmap?](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/4mPsYvLByiH9sFAAOEcMAq/6a81bc94d42fb2489f1eb5e445efa29f/76_S1_FullSize_CommunityCalendar_EN_1920x1080.jpg) lol
---
Well odds are a Ghillie PA would look incredibly similar so it wouldn’t be worth it
---
See at the end of every 76 session I have always had a habit of going to every single camp in my server before I leave. I love looking at camps and I love buying random shit! Glad I can finally be rewarded for it lol
---
He’s playing on xbox this would only give his computer a new private address anyway
---
Lol. Someone had to fall on their sword for this one.
---
Closer to being that than an MMO or an RPG.  What would you call it?
---
Sorry didn’t mean to direct towards you
---
The only way someone can get your IP address on xbox is if you join their party, so just be careful joining peoples party to Voice chat in the future.
---
my radium rifles, I always say im going to grind for the mods and mod them but I never do
---
Is that worth the 120lb trade off for high cap mod?
---
He seriously Cracks me up.
---
He always appears to me at the most in opportune time.
---
Doing Battle with a Sheepsquatch and he come strolling on through.
---
I think it’s random drop from events in savage divide
---
Without a doubt that was part of the problem for me. Had it consistently on one character, a bloodied heavy gunner. I cleared out healing factor last week and haven’t had the issue since then. I have another bloodied character and never had the issue, also never had healing factor.

Private addresses are not routable to the internet they are blocked by the ISP that’s why every network can share them

---
To preface, you shouldnt get banned for using mods unless it's borderline cheating or in NW.
---
Bethesda says they don't support mods but that doesn't mean they're necessarily against them. Just that youre SOL if anything goes wrong with them.
---
Pretty sure that Riding Shotgun doesn't count. Just completed the event, during which I killed a total of 3 raiders, all 3-star legendaries.
---
I also read in another thread that humans don't count for the challenge, so that might have been it.
---
Initially he acted like I killed him, but in every interaction after he acknowledged I didn't. If you tell him your thirsty and ask about the future, do you have the option to ask how Freddie is doing?
---
Depends on a cases to case basis, if you really need more space then high cap is the way to go. But if you already have decent weight from armor perks, strength points/perks, etc. then Chem mod can help reduce what you already have. I’m kind of a hoarder so all the Stimpacks and Radaways add up so Chem is for me.

Did the same thing to me. It finally ended up at him being a travelling merchant. Still did not meet him however. 
---
Kinda sad that very last discussion with this ally quest line is bugged. They made effort to write decent and emotional dialogues, normal thing would be not to screw the immersion and the effect of your choice with a bug.
---
I don’t think so - I have wanted a red one for over a year and never have seen a mod or plan for them ...
---
I wonder why they don't have an exact date. Perhaps they plan to extend the seasons if necessary. I assume there will be many players crying for more time to level up lol.
---
It’s not a big deal. It’s not like hey said it did damage numbers. Just a missed
---
Opportunity. If I accidentally bought I would. It’s all good.
---
I don't have healing factor or bloodied build, but I get this bug every once in awhile.
---
Let us also not forget how often it causes you to lock up after you fire an arrow of aim too long without firing one. Unable to shoot, unable to block, unable to switch weapons, etc. until you open your shortcuts wheel and change things manually. Even if you don't want to change weapons, you need to, cause if not, you just aren't doing anything.
---
Correct. I took 3 weeks off the game thinking “oh I’ll be able to catch up later because it’ll only take 2 hours max to rank up”. I would have at least logged on to do dailies and weeklies had I known there was an asterisk when they made that statement. Oh well though, I’m over it.
---
I'll take the over; people sometimes wait until Friday afternoon to release duping videos because Bethesda doesn't do patches on the weekend.
---
I never said you were bloodied and I didn’t say you needed to be to beat it. It’s just stupid they get an advantage and don’t have to grind as much
---
This season was the first time i learned about "ghillie". I am ok with not knowing more about it. :)
---
I have 3 legacy Gatling plasmas in my stash that I don’t use because they’re too op and make the game not fun. I only use them in emergency situations (like earlier today when I was running out of ammo fighting a colossus)
---
Only spoiled sheepsquatch milk.. Atleast I think it’s milk... it only had one utter...

I walked into Vault Tec Uni just to turn in my daily Scorch Beast sample...3 Star Charred Ghoul. 
---
I went and crafted a bunch of new player stuff and dropped it in front of 76 to keep the good karma farming. Happy hunting Wasters
---
Dang that sucks. I’ve been looking for an hour at all the mod drops and player vendors.
---
Kind of a dick move to do, especially since you drank 10 and you only need 5 for the challenge
---
Matte black colour for the ss armour would be so dope
---
That seems extremely strange and arbitrary.
---
Typically ammo, depending on character, or plans that I’m missing that I can’t reasonably get on my own. Sometimes I’ll look for junk I need
---
But why force other people to do it?
---
It mainly happens to low health/bloodied builds. I’ve only ever gotten it once and I was at low health at the time, I’ve also heard other people saying this was the case
---
I have a bloody faster swing speed +1 strength bear arm sitting on my bedroom wall.
---
And there it shall stay
---
That's not cool man, just you.
---
It's pretty satisfying!
---
A new IP address would only help if there’s a duplicate assigned or some magical thing happened where this dude blocked this guys IP address on an ISP router that is assigning IPs or by a DHCP server. Even then they are assigned based off of MAC address. ISPs add the MAC address of your router/modem to a whitelist which allows that device to get an IP address. That’s why if you buy your own from a store you call them or use a online tool to get your MAC added
---
This is why I keep mine stocked
---
The most interesting thing is: what exactly did they manage to break with two latest PTS patches, for which they didn't even bother to provide patch notes thus making us unable to directly test the changes they implemented (which kinda defeats the purpose of test servers in the first place)
---
I've never tried fixing them before getting all 3 - but I definitely will try it tomorrow 😆 thanks for the shortcut
---
To buy out all there stock, for your own gain like that when we all know low prices are to help the lower lvls.
---
Gahhhh. Thanks for answering, though!
---
Don't its not worth it. I am 1 mod short and have scrapped well over 800 since the last mod...
---
While this is true I get where they are going. If you're right eye dominant, you shoot guns with your right side, if you're right side dominant, you draw with the right hand. Characters in game show themselves as right handed, therefore the bow should be drawn by the right hand. This is a never ending issue as all firearms seem to be left handed firearms fired from the right side (spent brass ejects out the left side and across the camera). The handmade, and hunting rifle are the worst culprits of this
---
it gives players an advatage, ofc it will happen
---
Personally, yes. The high cap one lowers your resistances, and in my case i like hoarding meds items to sell to vendors.
---
You can have one food, one drink and one Chem buff of a type at a time. So deathclaw steak is +2 strength, you can have vodka and buff out too, but not mole rat chunks which also buff strength. But you can mix it up so you can buff your strength with one food, then eat something that increases melee damage, carry weight, AP refresh etc. I believe it goes by what you ate last.
---
If you are going low health, go full unyielding. Many people have said it already. A single piece means another 18 SPECIAL points. That's way more useful than 30 DR. 
---
I tried a full bolstering set, because I thought it would give me an edge when facing bloodied pvpers at workshops. 
---
It didn't work. And Evasive + Serendipity can tank better.
---
How come this like never happens on ps4
---
Did you get a properly made one or a decorative wall hanger? I can't say I've personally handled one, but my understanding is a properly made, functional nodachi should weigh in at maybe around 5lbs at the most which is definitely on the heavy end for a sword, but far from what I'd call "unwealdy". I'd imagine the unusually large handle and blade would make it harder to wield than the actual weight.
---
This always breaks my heart, if you've ever even looked at a bolt rifle the reason the side the bolt is on is obvious, really burns me out of playing a stealth sniper build besides the fact it's worthless in 76
---
Why not? There's literally zero reason to care about other players in this game. It could be offline now and I would barely notice. You wouldn't need something like this for anything in the Wasteland really, we have overpowered guns to begin with. However it would be able to create nuke zones for Scorched Earth, etc. while being able to bypass the silo.
---
Anyway, I would live a reason to have to actually worry about what other players are doing.
---
Wait how do we tell the difference between public and not??
---
LOL
---
Surface to air
---
I'd actually like to see them make the bow more viable by playing with its Crit damage.  It either needs to be even MORE suppressed than a rifle, or it needs to have a boost to its SA Critical.  IMO.
---
Yes i definitely agree the low hp build advantage is a bit too much stronger than any other alternative including junkies in most aspects of the game. 
---
Main issue is multiple synergizing perks, legendary prefixes and mutation to a point where no other builds offers the same mutually beneficial perk/legendary/mutation combo.
---
A fix would be to give stuff like anti armor, anti type, two shot, etc new perks that synergize. 
---
Ie) - perk that gives damage bonus based on armor negated, sort of like an armor melting effect
---
- or a perk that allows all weapons to shoot 1 additional bullet that does 20% supplementary damage, making two shot weapons into 3 shot. 
---
- vampires: more perks/effects that give you an advantage when full hp would make vampires very attractive 
---
That way bloodied is still damage supreme, but other builds are competitive too.
---
I agree. I have a weapon that I reserve specifically for the Scorchbeast Queen fights.
---
You are not. I wish when smelting ore I could set an amount. Maybe one day.
---
I hate seeing a nuke zone over bog when I first log onto a server *without* noticing it before someone launches another. 
---
I then check my map see the nuke over the bog go sit wait the 3 minutes. With a couple others. Nuke hits andbwere looking like where did it go?? Why no sbq???? *then* realize it was somewhere not even worth it
---
Wrong sub, mate. Use the trade subs.
---
You only need all 3 if you are going to do the intelligence check for more caps. If you don’t care about that you can just fix one.
---
People like you make it easier for the actual good players to win so kudos
---
I’m just wondering which event, I’ve been trying to do every event in savage divide even those smaller events but I guess the drop rate is the same no matter what
---
Nah. I've never had that dialogue. It sounds like a bug.
---
Drink inert flux to reduce the chance of getting glowing pustules. That's probably a contributing factor. But 3 in Blocker is mandatory if you want to dance with the ghouls. Scorched at a nuke party too, some of those guys will kill you when the 3\* scorchbeast can't.
---
Kept putting nuka cherry in my vending machine to be nice, 3 times in a row, I came back after 1 visitor to find it empty from full. Started filling it with nuka shine and same situation, at least now I get a chuckle out of it being empty
---
The exclamation mark is public. All others are minor
---
Cool. Go get em tiger.
---
Then why not find a group that enjoys engaging in PvP and go shoot with them? Go claim a workshop and wait for someone to contest it.
---
Why the need to mess with people who are enjoying the game in their own way?
---
all of the ballistic weapons in the game are left handed. the charging handles for all the auto's and semi-autos are on the wrong side, the lever action has the loading gate on the wrong side and the hunting rifle is just backwards. it seems to me they did this to make animations look better from the pipboy clipping to getting to see everything more clearly but I'm not really sure.
---
I see regenerating as much as ghoul slayer or zealots,the only issue is I mostly see it on 1 start gear only.
---
Don't thank me.  This problem has been here for a while.  We don't know what causes it. . . Yet.  Bethesda's last patch, had a logger to keep track of this situation.  Make a report of this to Bethesda so they can look at your log.  You probably won't see any reimbursement, but maybe they can actually fix it. . . Sometime.
---
Hey there! 
---
1: The only way to know your progress is by what rewards you have gotten. There's not a trackable stat or progress bar.
---
2. The rewards can be found in the Atom Shop. You can look at everything you have unlocked that is account bound that way basically. 
---
3. Not sure on tomorrow's patch, although yes, it does seem like they are going to patch it. As they said previously to keep grinding until they release a fix in the next patch.
---
If you need help knowing what rewards you can unlock or need to check progress, you can check here at the "Limited Time Rewards" tab:

You can unlock everything but the VTU rewards with the glitch. Happy hunting!

It’s I think any event  it’s just low rng chance. I got a forest and an urban like 100 hours in or something but none since then... I’m like level 380 now
---
I’m not on Xbox. But just wanted to remind you in case you forgot. Equip the perk “contractor” under intelligence.  It will reduce the amount of items/junk you need to build stuff at your camp. It might help with the flux.
---
This question is ridiculous. Why shouldn't you be able to seek revenge when someone kills you? That's just logical. Good luck ever getting your junk back from the guy that popped you, if you can't seek revenge.
---
Bethesda has already turned this into "The Sims wasteland edition" let's not go further down the drain.
---
The team aggro change is already ridiculous enough, team PvP is impossible. If you disagree with me, than likely you aren't a real PvPer. Making a change like OP purposes, would make 1v1 PvP impossible as well. We all know the guy who shoots second gets an advantage.
---
Sounds like OP just wants to be able to cheap shot, and have no consequences. Think about it, if he thought he could actually take on the guy without cheap tactics, then he wouldn't be afraid of them seeking revenge. 
---
No, he knows he cannot take them on, and wants free caps and junk because these people are "griefers" for liking player versus player interaction.
---
I sell shielded under armour at 500 caps so people can actually have them.
---
I would like a katana skin for the wooden board. Masamune mode.
---
Could you hold one till Wednesday? That's a funny story and I would like to display it.
---
Even if I were to run out, I can always make another. No worries.
---
What do you play on?
---
Took five alcohols I had sitting in my fascnacht collectron and ate five Halloween candy with it to easily get those two done
---
Because it is an MMO, and other players should have an effect. Also team PvP is pretty broken right now with no aggro being held, and everyone having to engage everyone.
---
I've been part of PvP groups and clans, it is fun partaking in those activities, but once again, the game limits team PvP with the aggro mechanic, and it is hard to meet new people without engaging first.
---
Just think, you make a new friend because "hey man remember when we first met, you hit my camp with the C finder, and then we battled for an hour, good times."
---
This is a well-know way to make caps.  Craft a bunch of tactical marine helmets with super-duper, max your charisma, and sell to a vendor bot. Easy money.
---
I have a route on whitespring to kill all 5 - 6 sentry bots + ghouls within 10 minutes. Easy 10k exp if not more. Its just monotonous though

Use the finger guns and get naked. Maybe even punch them
---
Damn,can I 1v1 your Nanna tho
---
Yeah I read on that fo76 spreadsheet with all drop rates and it laid 0.1% from savage divide, I’m level 250 and I have a level 140 alt lol. I’m hoping one day I’ll get the mask and those rare jumpsuits
---
AFTER level 50 every level up allows you to move one special point OR pick one new perk.
---
I had healing factor with bloodied and since removing that mutation a couple of weeks ago I've had the fast travel bug twice, both times I had just eaten or used a stimpack. So I think the bug is definitely related to health regen of some kind.
---
Oh goodie. Didn't realise that it's an alcohol. Just knew you could get addicted to it, now my Junkie can swig in peace. Pity I didn't catch on sooner.
---
Same
---
I’ve probably spent that fast traveling to vendors looking for a plan 🤪
---
Or just nerf adrenal reaction since it turns any weapon into a bloodied sort of weapon, make it so unyielding only gives +1 special per piece, nerf bolstering, etc.
---
You get what you pay for, and I have premium priced plans, not bargain basement schleck like this junk merchant.
---
Plans at premium prices! I have barn building set for 50 and barn doors for 200! Lion statues can go for as little as 10 caps, but here at Slowcum Joes - you know its 100 baby! 
---
You want recipes? We got em. Whether you want to pay 50 caps or 50 caps, we have you covered. 
---
Only premium plans? No legendaries for perusal? No, stash is full. But we do have premium plans as far as the distance can render! 
---
All ammo is free but its 3000 rounds of 38. One per customer.
---
Emphasis on the ONE. Each level up is not a free respec. You can do one action, either pick a perk, or move a point
---
Watch out for ticks.  One climbed right up my exit hole and now Im allergic to red meat.
---
Basically Bethesda has many options but they’re too lazy and they keep adding in stuff that’s catered towards bloodied builds
---
I just found a fun new camp build location, though I'm worried it may be too close to the New Boss!
---
I'm sorry that the majority of people don't want to PvP, myself included. Hopefully, you guys can get more folks and be loud enough for them to eventually bring back survival mode.
---
Elaborate
---
The only flaw in your argument is any computerized RNG is actually sudo-random. If you were to have two of the exact same computer model run the exact same code for the first time they would create a string of identical random numbers until one ran a different code. So there may be some patterns in the sudo-random code
---
PA needs mods for parts that adds 20% reduced weight like what we have for normal armor. Reduce the weapons, food, or chems.
---
It won’t allow me to move a point.
---
Your solution would flip the problem around. Now it's more difficult for the lower level players to finish the challenge.
---
Level up is an easy catch all that's fair for everyone. It's fine as it is. Worst case you make a new character and run down to The Wayward for an easy level up. Delete, do it again tomorrow.
---
I tried to. I put hard bargain 3. My charisma is 3 but plus the Max unyielding charisma it went to 18. And when I tried selling it, it would only give me 31 caps per helmet. So unless my charisma is too low or I need more, I rather kill enemies and sell their guns.
---
TS AGL is FIRE... no I really mean it... literally makes all the cars (and most everything else) go BOOM real good lol
---
Wouldn’t really make sense lore-wise, as the Secret Service is trying to refill the gold vault in Vault 79. Why would they have a machine in there that dispenses something that they’re trying to hoard? Sounds a little counter-intuitive to me.
---
Lol especially any more than 1000
---
Yep same
---
I just go and change the ammo type to something useless like .38 or .44. It’s a small act of sabotage but I like to imagine their irritation when they find out
---

Doesn’t really seem like that big of an issue 2 out of 3 really ain’t that bad...
---
In Fallout 4, I'd use the VertiBird to fly from one side of the map to the other and blow up cars using the turret. Good times...
---
Agreed, bug.   Probably recent too.   Did the questline on 4 characters in the month after Wastelanders released;  he never mentioned anything about burying his brother, whom I saved on all.
---
Yea it feels like joining the end game events (counting Encrypted and project paradise) is a toss up on if it’s worth it or not. Seems like half the time people don’t show up or the BBEG glitches out and I get nothing. I had a SBQ fall through the ground immediately after getting killed the other day
---
Assaultron helmet - craft it
---
I don’t know. Maybe I clicked choose a perk on accident and I hadn’t noticed. I guess I will have to level up one more time and see what happens.
---
So you're... right handed when you shoot bows.  I'm right handed for most things but shoot bows left handed.
---
It’s seriously annoying and it should have been that way from the beginning
---

This mod freed up more than 40lbs of my everyday inventory.   Super worth it
---
Sell plans at 10% of what the game says they are worth.
---
Yep, needs new content.  Badly.
---
Not gonna lie, the mounted heads I throw them away, at the bottom of a river so they dont stay in circulation. Armor pieces however (power armor/ regular armor such as raiders and robot) do sell rlly often, if your camp is in the forest. Atleast for me they do, but I guess my target audience is low level players, since I sell them at their base price most of time.
---
Your not alone 🤣

I think the reasoning is that a bullet casing flying across the screen looks cooler than one flying out of view.

Stop getting drunk and letting anything with(out?) a pulse hit that
---
I hear you on this, my POV has always been a build/buff and not nerf to fix the issue haha. Making it so everyone can choose a godlike endgame for themselves also will likely help player retention.
---
I mean, even non junkies/bloodied can one shot highest lv enemies, as i learned on my pistol build xd, so if everyone does tons of damage, just give us higher level enemies! 
---
Anyway we are getting off topic. Great discussion :)
---
Lol. No joke, that is terrifying. Reminds me of the South American fish that swims up a different but equally compromising hole.
---
I suddenly want to bathe in pure radiation.
---
Oh its definitely to show off the animation. However a righty using a lefty (or vice versa) is super awkward
---
Because hacks dont exist in consoles. Or atleast thats the perception anyway.
---
I’ll give you wood at 1 cap a piece
---
Probably hackers on PC making those things easier while the same stuff either can’t be done or is a lot harder to do on console
---
The default when you press level up is pick a perk, you gotta scroll to the right(?) to pick the other option
---
I was on my way to Westek to try to find a 3 star legendary when out of nowhere a 3 star glowing radstag stepped out onto the road in front of me. It was super easy to finish that challenge.

Not true, infact this is incredibly wrong.

You can't login in via "default" admin credentials as every router has different login credentials (such as password etc) and are usually on the back of the router itself for first time setup.
---
You also, can't login to a router without being on the local side off it, aka 1.1 at the end if the local ip.
---
Routers aren't open to the public...

How do i know? I studied advanced networking for 3 years, including domain setup and securing, working with open/closed ports etc.

Yeah, I've had the opportunity to shoot a right handed bow as a lefty.  Not fun.

This broadens the picture and explains a lot more of what I've been getting/have gotten before. Healing Factor might just be the most ruthless trigger if it gets stuck (like a conflict with the opposite yet separate rads counter somehow) and never ceases.

For Steel go to [map76.com](https://map76.com/res_vein/lpi_veinironlvli0036b7ff) and locate all the iron veins in the world to refine into steel.
---
OR farm the ever-loving crap out of Uranium Fever &amp; Line in the Sand; these events spawn many enemies with firearms that can be melted down into steel. This is even more effective with high INT and the Scrapper perk card.
---
Remember to use Super Duper at all steps of the crafting process.
---
EDIT: I'm an idiot and confused Radiation Rumble with Uranium Fever
---
Psn is soulmates69
---
Haha I definitely move around alot too. Hm I may have to revisit Fallout 4. I played through in a sort of disorganized way so I probably didnt absorb alot of the good good settlement building.
---
I think about the gamers who can't* grind everyday. Professionals not working from home. 
---
Medical personnel.
---
Military deployed. 
---
Etc.
---
Not everyone can grind many hours every day or even every week or every month. 
---
I've met military personnel out on deployment for weeks to months with no access to play.
---
Grinding for a particular weapon is so much harder if you have very limited time to grind.
---
Wheres the new boss spawn?
---
When I moved camp the budget taken by my two machines freed up fine so I built a raider collection and added some more displays, I still have room for a train cart too but no where to place it except glitching it on top of a fence.
---
At OP....you’re probably better off just doing it at workshops if you really want to do it.  I don’t know if it can destabilise the server...it seems like building hundreds of the things probably would (looking at red rocket mega stop and all that flat ground), but if you’ve got FO1st then do it on a private server to be safe.
---
I mean it’s a robot
---
Will be on in about 5 minutes
---
They aren't 'creatures'! They are magnificent beauties!
---
Radiation rumble enemies don’t drop very many weapons
---
You can point at things with the 'Taunt' gun fingers. A clapping emote would be cool though.
---
I didn’t state that I already had a full set of powered sentinel armor and some decent weapons. Didn’t want to seem like I was tooting my own horn so to speak
---
Space lady has a mediocre Medics alien blaster
---
The raider reputation glitch involving a daily quest to easily level up reputation
---
I mean... bulkier power armor means thicker armor means... better protection? I don’t see the issue here.
---
And the secret service/government don’t care how it looks, they care how it performs. Which is very well
---
That frustrated me too so I ended up just making a project out of finding them in-game. A scavenger hunt was more fun to me than waiting around for artificial timers &amp; it's generally been easy to sell the unwanted extra plans / mods.
---
Not it’s not... tomorrow is the fortifying atlas event beginning. The brotherhood isn’t arriving for months, and the main set of quests won’t be until months after that
---
Cool idea but I think it would just spoil the whole purpose of mumbles. It's supposed to be random. And then it would be like cheating. If don't get what you want them just back out and go back in till you get what you desire
---
Not really.  There's a few ways you can alleviate this. The first way is to simply make the amount of experience required scale depending on your level, but that's probably too much work for Bethesda, so the other solution besides just making the required experience low (like 500-1,000 'low') is to instead make the experience requirement based on certain sources.  Such as "gain experience from events", or by killing specific enemies, such as Scorched, or Super Mutants.  More focused, but lower requirements overall.
---
"Level up" is a less fair solution because in theory, the longer you play, the harder it is to actually level up because the amount of experience you need to do so will steadily increase until finally reaching a cap at level 1,000 I believe. 
---
And honestly, you don't exactly raise a solid point because most challenges in the game aren't going to be friendly to new players anyway because starting out would logically mean you're woefully unprepared to complete many of feats the game awards you for.
---
Yup, The servers should go down in about 10h and 42mins
---
No, but it's the originals that hold the value.
---
Bethesda won’t do it because it makes too much sense
---
Yes you are correct, they don't.
---
They would write news articles about how beth introduced another p2w mechanism, if it was only available through atoms. 
---
If it was available through events, yeah, great give us weapon scrapper kits. I mean even with additional materials its not a huge benefit so they'd have to be a plentiful drop to be worth the effort
---
How are you planning to do this might i ask.
---
I suspect it may be level based then since whenever I run the event the Mole Miners drop loads of Combat Shotguns, Double Barrels and the occasional Assault Rifle.
---
I am around Level 200 and I think one of my friends when starting out told me they were dropping Pipe Pistols or something when I tried it with them.
---
Slap that sucker on a display stand, and you got a canon for your camp.
---
Most efficient lead/steel/plastic farm I’ve been able to come up with (pair with scrapper for best results):
---
1.) Grafton Steel - loot the whole place top to bottom, killing and looting all the super mutants on the way (this will also net some decent gunpowder and caps to cover all the fast travel)
---
2.) Morgantown High - I typically only loot the first floor, Scorched included. All the plates, pumpkins, and bowling pins amount to a solid plastic haul, with intermittent values of other scrap as well
---
3.) Fast Travel to Green Country Lodge - there’s a weight room full of plates and dumbells, scrap it just up the road at a workbench
---
4.) Fast Travel down to Charleston Fire Department - Another weight room, with varying other scrap and a workbench in the same building to break it all down quick.
---
Takes maybe an hour, tops.
---
You’re thinking of uranium fever, where mole miners spawn. That event is good for steel. Radiation rumble is protecting a bunch of scavengers from glowing ghouls
---
My camp is in the top right of the map. ALL plans and recipes one cap each. When I was a low level player I would have loved to have come across my camp. As for the mounted plans from duped presents yep those all get thrown into a ravine where noone will ever find them and if you do keep walking nothing to see here!!!
---
I actually really like how it looks, even the whole monochrome color scheme going on with it.
---
It looks like a cross between New California Republic ranger armor and H.E.C.U. uniforms from Half Life.
---
I love doing that! Especially if you can kill some monsters too!!
---
Could be the low damage output of the pistols.  I tried the same for a little while when I had limited cards.  Just not worth using all those points in the end.
---
Lol. You're a weirdo.
---
I sell all my plans for 28 caps regardless of what the plan is for. I accumulate a LOT of plans so it keeps the carry weight from overburdening me.
---
I noticed that!  Okay, good to know. Until I max Raider Rep, I’m not charging them anyways.
---
Thanks for the correction!
---
I’m a fairly new player and I remember when I was like lvl 20 a couple months ago a guy ran up to me and dropped a present that had multiple plans for dozens of different mounted heads. I thought he must have just had a bunch accumulated from events or something. Seeing these posts, I know now they were duped but I had no idea then. I still don’t fully understand, whatever was going on must have been before my time. Of all things, why mounted heads?
---
I've seen this a lot with robots that explode after.
---
Does this happen with Scorchbeasts too?
---
This would be pretty inconvenient when you combine this bug with the one that causes Scorchbeasts to just rocket into the air like Captain Cosmos for a few seconds on death.
---
I've seen it with everything, myself.
---
Sneaky bloodied rifleman is great.
---
No, I am not wrong here. You clearly make assumptions and generalize way too much. I also speak from a place of experience with network security. You may want to get familiar with Penetration Testing tools and methods.
---
Yeah, apparently it can't be a human or a robot. 
---
I'm not entirely sure how other humanoids fall into the mix, but I can attest that Ghouls WILL fulfill the challenge, so that does open up your search parameters a little.
---
I have had this with legendary scorchbeasts, the SBQ, the Colossus, and even standard legendaries.
---
Alright ill keep that in mind man thanks!
---
Thanks man btw are those the only rewards ?
---
Could be I suppose. But I figured 30% would be enough of a difference to be able to tell on the pistol damage, I mean my bolt action is doing 187 damage and the exploding on I had was only doing 77
---
But if you nuke an area with them in it, they drop hardened masses...
---
I'm just a poor casual trying to do some challenges
---
I’ll state, unless you are maxing the amount of scrip you can carry (1000) I’d wait to spend it until you really level up a lot.  That’s just me, though. The lower-level gear you get could still be useful as you level-up.  
---
Don’t overpay at player vendors. 
---
Taking workshops is great for quick XP early on, but don’t linger. You can get most materials faster if you know where to look and are willing to server-hop.
---
I've yet to get anything of value from the purveyor....  3 star berserker rolling pin? Hard pass

That should cover everything but feel free to ask any questions.
---
Funny thing is that I ended up with a bloodied switchblade, and sometimes I switch to it.  I stayed behind the mutant giant at Bog Town and cut him to death never being detected.
---
Manoga mine at the savage divide, it takes a nuke!
---
Damn
---
You hold bows in the right hand in Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim too. It's probably something to do with the engine lol.
---
Yes. Subnautica bases are quite fun to build. I just wish there was more variety in the pieces
---
Yes, Rifleman and Gunslinger only double up on Pipe Revolvers and Pipe Bolt-Action when modded with a rifle stock.
---
The pipe pistol/rifle won’t benefit from both.
---
Here’s my lead route. You do this and add in lucky hole mine (and super-duper when smelting ore) and you can easily get 2000 lead.

I didnt know about green country lodge and charleston FD. Thanks for letting me know! I'll have to try it out tommorow.
---
Do what exactly?
---
You're on a watchlist now lol.
---
i save on camp space by only having 1 generator to power 1 vendor; it still lists all products avail and shoppers may access all vendors
---
Thank you for the tip on that website! And yeah I learned that apparently using scrapper with weapons gets you like 20 steel per gun, so not bad.
---
Already done! For once I beat the Christmas/Halloween rush!
---
Please stop. You're being ridiculous.
---
We meet up in open world, tag each other and go from there? Unless you have any ideas? I’m open to opinions?
---
I’m easily 95% pipe guns, broadsiders, and Gatling guns from Mumbles, and 5% anything else.  So, so many pipe guns I immediately walk back down the hall and exchange for scrip again.
---
I’ll got lucky hole mine, then jump to toxic Larry meat and kill the 3 snallygaster. I’ll stay there and server hope. You can get a couple hundred quickly, then run through black water mine with a melee and grab all the weapons off the mole miners. You can used make 2-3k 2mm in about 2 hours
---
Can confirm, quest seemed to pause at robobrain building tools until I found an enemy glitched out/hidden in the room. Thanks for the help!
---
Uh huh. I still have all my source material infront of me, that's what the funny thing is.
---
Nice google job, still haven't said anything true.
---
🤦🏻‍♂️
---
It does seem more common.  I recently went through vault 79 with a new character.  I quit after the 3rd try of farming the 3 star bot half way through.
---
I was clearing out a cultist camp the other day, and as I began to walk towards the entrance to leave, I saw him just standing there. Not moving. Waiting for me to approach. 
---
This guy is meticulous.
---
woof y'all just giving away ranks now? man bos:ac used to be something with a little integrity. how far it has fallen tsk tsk
---
I hate Mumbles so much...I've never gotten anything good. RNG HATES me.
---
It is coupled with bloodied or massive rad builds- it immediately goes away if you suppress the mutation and only occurs with rads (I personally went from full ho vampire build to bloodied and just started having the issue)
---
I meant is this gonna be like an all out brawl with all the people here or just a classic 1v1
---
It’s just work.
---
If your on xbox and give you some supplies to get back on your feet.
---
If I /we had more people? I would love that. But the other guys that responded earlier, haven’t gotten back to me. If you want, we could pass until next time? Unless you have anyone that would like to join?
---
You need to level up completely before you can respec. So hit level 50 and use all the level ups. At level 51 you should be able to respec one point per level
---
I know. All the “kill legendary” grind has maxed out my stash box. I’m to the point of just dumping all the 1* 20# double shot super sledges I’ve been getting because my stash is full and I can’t carry anymore weight.
---
You would have a point if the item had a description that it was a hardened mass of meat or it the item was call hardened meat mass but hardened mass could be anything including a hardened metal mass
---
This was supposed to be about the mods, but you aced the ignoring part.
---
I used to love blowing up cars in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. They definitely have been nerfed since then though.
---
Sure i can wait im pretty much ready to go to sleep right about now and the only guy i know who would be up for it is most definitely asleep.
---
You would also have a point if 1. The item weren’t identical to that from biological creatures, which do not contain large quantities of metal and 2. Metal reflects, and doesn’t absorb radiation. That’s why you don’t microwave metal.
---
dropped plans from presents
---
Yeah, that was the only situation where I died by stupidly triggering a trap, rather than stupidly attacking something (or a group of somethings) that was far more powerful than I could deal with.
---
All the albino ragstags at the farm northeast of dent and sons?  They disappear 10-15 seconds after killing.
---
That sentrybot at NAR Regional?  Yup. Gone in 15 seconds or less. 
---
It’s frustrating.
---
If only there weren't a ton of other posts already addressing this....
---
Ya he told me that i suck nuts and my stocks in my vending are way to expensive
---
What level are you now? I missed like 3 whole days AND double S.C.O.R.E. and I am still on track to win
---
They may not have been duplicated.  Everyone playing during the Christmas event got many presents killing the holiday legendaries.  Presents contained the plans.  You could go farm a fissure site of ultracite and a holliday legendary scorched or more would show up. Collision Course event and a few mines were easy farming too.
---
It’s an intelligence perk right?
---
&gt; Def don't go into burrows. Won't run into a bunch there. Nor West Tek.
---
This is what confuses me.  I seem to pick up 3-4, 3** items on a regular day of playing.  Which means I run into at least that many 3 star mobs.  I completed this daily today before even realizing it.
---
Hard to really offer any insight without knowing what level you are at.
---
That's a fair call lol
---
Wdym their party? In fo76? Or like an xbox love group chat?
---
I love it when I see the assaultron running full-bore at me, because it means it’s decided to use melee (and die) rather than its crazy OP head laser (and possibly kill me)
---
If you're not afk in a bush or under water, you're wrong.
---
A broken mess with little to no foresight of what endgame content should look like mostly, but comparing it to destiny 2 or diablo 3 is not something that springs to mind. Its closer to a cookie clicker game with inventory management. There's at least decent gameplay in those other games.
---
I'm selling almost only plans and other then altracite armor and jet packs everything costs between 1 cap and 45 caps for like white springs sets

Because duping items of rare plans, rare equipment and legacy Weapons was is a more rampant issue on the PC version for obvious reasons so the price of things went down rapidly since you would simply be buying a dupe of something and not something actually rate like you do in the Console version.

Pretty much anything from 3, 4 or new vegas, although a lot of the ones in new Vegas break the lore since they were recorded very recently so they probably wouldn’t add any of those
---
Mule;)
---
Well this is a Bethesda game did you really expect them to code two different items if one of them is sufficient and on top of that expecting them to follow real world logic?
---
Thank you, good to know now.
---
 I got 3 already lol
---
Yes, since fallout 3.
---
Not running, looking.
---
Private servers 😂
---
Why 28 caps?  That seems like an awfully specific and arbitrary number to pick
---
I can understand slower ads, but when your weapon is stowed and you're just looking at things on a shelf, it should be so much slower.
---
Where do i find this kind people? Haha
---
honestly just plans I don't know, maybe a cool weapon or armor sometimes.
---
That would be a nightmare, lol :)
---
RIP Bloodied fixer :(
---
Not really the point I was making but I understand what you're saying. I mean it seems like Bethesda got lazy with this armor as compared to the very very detailed heart PA
---
Dang, you have a problem. I move once a week tops, but I just bought 1st and take over workshops and build some type of structure/test once a day. Wade airport is a perfect flat test area.

I don't know. It was really helpful, since I was out of stimpaks and food.

If remote access on the router was enabled they certainly could, but that is never enabled by default and anyone enabling it would be smart enough to change the default login. More than likely he just sent a ddos attack and if OP has a shit router that is unable to thwart such attacks it succumbed to it.
---
Too bad it could actually make them viable.  Good info though.
---
My point exactly, this was a very generic comment that's incredibly misinformed (not yours, the OP i replied too)
---
I finished it the other day, if you farm/run events with high intelligence you can get a lot of XP. Angry Turtle has a great how to video. I used Night Person perk, Building Team, Brain bombs, Cranberry Relish, Egg Head, Herd mentality Herbivore serum and sucked down Berry Mentats like there was no tomorrow. If you are using marsupial serum it give -4INT, I made and used lots them.
---
I had to stop my usual trolling through reddit to respond  to this. I agree with you, im tired of see 200+ plans and they're all dupe head mounts! What's even worse is when i see them selling for 150c-1500c+. Makes me wanna run through silo real quick and drop a number 2 on their camp.
---
I keep haveing people buy my stimpacks and cores, as this is all I offer out side of plans that's less than 100 caps
---
I wish I could have this problem. It sounds like a humble-brag, but I believe it with Bethesda.  LoL
---
Lol nice. I love the 'POLLY BuiLT TO KILL' over the red heart on the back of it
---
1) are you on PC?
---
2) were you wearing the PA when the server stopped responding?
---
3) if you were not wearing it, and looking in your inventory might you have accidentally had it selected and hit R? (the drop command)
---
4) After getting it back or replaced you may want to put an atom shop paint on one or more of the pieces, items with atomshop paint and 'skins' can't be dropped...easily.
---
Funny you should ask this on a day when I did the one where you set up a room for a party with place settings and arrangements. It was a real pain in the ass even with three or four of us doing it.

Simple, use a packet sniffer on a computer on the same network and you can figure out their ip easily. I wouldn’t be surprised if software already exists that is specifically designed to sniff Xbox live packets to give you other players IP address with the click of a button. The major issue is consoles are still in the fucking Stone Age using peer to peer so it makes it super easy for even the dumbest script kiddy.
---
You'll need to pick raw flux (plants and flowers) inside a nuke zone and combine it with glowing mass, hardened mass and high-radiation fluids to make stable flux.
---
Ricochet
---
I'm at work, so I don't have the link, but there's a fallout wiki, that's what I use. Also, there's a terminal in the enclave bunker that has info on it
---
Within the nuke zone, enemies will respawn at a higher level, but will drop four other items - High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and Ionized Meat. An enemy will only drop one type, and you need an equal amount of Fluid, Glowing, and Hardnened.
---
In addition, you'll need to harvest irradiated plants within the Nuke zone for a certain colour of Flux. You'll get one from each plant (two if you have Green-Thumb, which is highly recommended), and you'll need 10 of them for each stable flux you want to make.
---
Then, you use a Chemistry Station to make the flux. If you have the Super Duper perk, you have a chance to increase the yield. 
---
Any other information you can probably find on the wiki.  
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flux)
---
Yeah, there was one I think on Saturday that hit east of the Overseer’s House, literally right on the water treatment plant for whatever reason.
---
Is that with certain perk cards? I feel like it needs nerfed too but when it first came out I tried shooting it a bit and it did like no damage.
---
You need to pick plants in nuked areas, lots of them and all different colors, you also need to kill creatures to get the other ingredients to make the Flux stable, which you do at your chemistry bench. You will need to collect hardened masses and irradiated fluids. Your raw Flux will only stay good for a short time before it turns into inert Flux, which you can drink if you end up with it.
---
I never looked up any guides but you'll need 1 hardened mass, 1 glowing mass, 1 high radiation fluid, and 10 raw flux to make one stable flux. All of these items are found inside of nuke zones, raw flux are from the plants and the 3 other ingredients have a chance to drop from enemies inside the zone. The mass and fluid can be hard to come by since they are rarer so you should focus on getting those before getting the flux since the raw flux spoils.
---
Easier to farm the ammo than to convert it, currently...
---
I definitely have a love/hate relationship with my state.

There's one of them next to a traincar on the Ash Heap side outside of the Blue Ridge camp, and the other waaay on the other side in the Cranberry Bog, also outside the camp next to a traincar.
---
PS4, SSD, always follow the guidelines except for the map opening thing (new to me, too), not a single autocomplete bug yet.
---
Agree 100%.  I thought about this the other day while doing Sweetwater quest.  They had apiaries in skyrim....
---
No they didn’t. It makes sense in the lore that it’s the way it is, like I said above why does the government care? They don’t. It’s in an underground vault, it’s not like it needs camo or to look a certain way
---
+1 Upvoted for a informitive comment, great detail. Also, Good with Salt or the refrigerator back mod to help the raw flux to last longer for crafting.
---
Wait Bethesda games have glitches?
---
I respect that, but at level 140+ it's harder for me to level than it is them. I will give away any other XP item though, other than bobbleheads, since they all expire and I'm prob on stew at the time.
---
Yup

Here's an old thread with some information and has a nukes dragon link [bloodied rifleman ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bs84z7/advice_for_a_bloodied_rifle_build/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) 
---
The basics are all rifleman perk cards with covert ops and gun fu.  That combination is really good.  Throw in tank killer and at least 2 concentrated fire.  I don't think 5 in Adrenaline is necessary, and may only use 1 when it is back active.  I am having great damage without it now.
---
If you use public teams, then use some of the points for inspirational and stranger in numbers.     Since public teams became available, I increased intelligence to 7 which helps leveling up.  
---
You basically have too look at works for you to tweek other's build.   It wil depend on what yuu carry.
---
You are thinking of the IP that your router gives to equipment in your network 192.168.0.* these ips can only be seen by you and are private, they only exist within your network and are not accessible outside of it. Your public IP is literally the IP address of your modem on the internet and anyone can get it. You can ddos that IP and if the modem and router are complete shit they will easily succumb to such an attack and go down.

Dodgy.

this is incorrect. the way to reproduce the bug is to have 2 guns on hotkeys and have the one you want to bug the ammo on in your hands. you hotswap to the larger magazine gun but also fire the weapon the frame after you do so but also while the gun is still being put away. when you do this, the bullet should come out of your chest area and thats how you know it worked. then hotswap back and the ammo in the mag will be the same as the one you previously swapped to.
---
it can take a few tries sometimes but I frequently do this with my dragon to get 200 rounds before having to reload and honestly its something that should be addressed considering how easy it is to do once you know how it works ://

They yeet into oblivion then drop from a crack in the space time continuum later.
---
The jetpack should work with the armor.  The question to ask is are there any power armors at lv 35
---
That's how you know how bored I am 😂
---
Im about level 64
---
Actually my big problem is what to do with materials. I have over 600lbs of it in my stash. Where can I sell it? Is there a junk not really worth keeping?
---
There’s glitches for both. I don’t see why it matters I was just using settlers as a broad term. If I was being specific I would say foundation and raiders.
---
Don't worry, if we turn in enough junk for the BoS event, they're blessing us with another double point weekend and more challenges that can auto complete.
---
Joining in game or on Xbox? Sorry im noob at this stuff
---
im level 64
---
So i got some Excavator power armor blueprints that I intend on Finding materials for and making tomorrow, Is there any jet packs that I don’t have to buy? I heard they are super expensive...
---
Excavator cant use a jetpack.  Your best bet at your level for a jetpack would be t 51b
---
As much as I hate marsupial and think it's ridiculous, I'd suggest it over a jetpack for where you're at. Just my opinion. I've got JP on my power armors and it doesn't do a lot that marsupial doesn't unless you're base jumping regularly and don't wanna die.
---
FYI Raider PA has a JP i think but why bother.
---
Plus if they didn't take action to obfuscate tracking them down is easy as pie and you can get some nice big fines for cross-state computer fuckery.
---
Plus most VPN services will roll on your ass if you break their TOS by say DDOS'ing people using it.
---
I'm concerned now that I'm over lvl 70 one days score is barely one level and I usually get a couple repeatable but not near enough
---
Vampire/medic 3 stars...long ranged(gauss/hunting rifle).
---
Everyday stuff= bulk screws, nuclear keycards, flux, mass, fluids. 
---
Other than that I'm used to the grind to find the stuff myself.
---
Yeah nah, don't think I've played an hour in this game without encountering a 3* enemy of some kind. You're just looking for something to gripe about.
---
Xbox Party Chat. 
---
It’s well known that if you join someone’s Xbox Party Chat that they can get your IP and don what happened to you. These aren’t sophisticated hackers. These are kids who looked up how to do this on the internet. I’m sure a simple google search will show how to do it.
---
I would recommend not joining parties of people you don’t know.
---
Dammit thanks a lot! 😂
---
But TBH I wish the Slocum's vendors played that song rather than whatever random ear-f is tainting most player vendors now 💀
---
I played during B.E.T.A. and right after release, but got a little fed up and took like a year off.  Came back abut a month ago and, out of all the cool new stuff they’ve put into this game, there’s still no damned ceilings for the CAMP structures!
---
Hmm good question. I like building settlements and going to new locations and exploring them, as well as meeting new characters and knowing their backstories
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqe3MRb3StY
---
You're welcome.
---
We should be allowed to make anything with legendary modules.
---
Use perk green thumb to get double and when you have enough to craft make sure to put max super duper on. You have chance of getting 2 for the price of 1. Or just look in vendors some ppl sell it. Most of time they want ridiculous amounts of caps but hey at least you ain’t gotta spend time grinding for it. I always picked and crafted my own or used what I got from the event. Then one day a guy was selling 60 of violet flux in his vendor which is the most useful one for about 10 caps each. I made sure I bought every last one
---
Bow Gang!
---
Just being able to pick up and drop junk items where you want them in your CAMP would be cool.  I just want to have a cigar, a bottle of bourbon, and a glass sitting on a table on my CAMP’s front porch. I don’t care if some asshole steals it.
---
Yeah I've been wondering this as well.  Like, per se, if I share a Lv. 3 Martial Artist and somebody has a Lv. 1 Martial Artist equipped.
---
Slocum Joe’s vendor is my new Mr. Fuzzy Ride.
---
You know if they just improved RNG bullying on this scale probably wouldn’t happen.
---
foundation is where settlers stay, if you want a broad term say wastelanders npc’s, that’s like saying settlers and crater..? that doesn’t make sense
---
I was getting my ass handed to me by a hoard of zombies in Whitesprings.  When the dust settled, the SCORE popped.  Didnt even know I was fighting one till it was dead.
---
Paging u/Calf_
---
That’s just how I refer to them.
---
That gets you a new address on your LAN (router controlled network), it does nothing for your WAN, which is typically assigned via modem communication to your isp.
---
Then you would spend more a bad weapons
---
Honestly, more of that Country/Western sound. Bluegrass, too. An Instrumental Bluegrass station in the style of Minuteman Radio would be amazing. (Maybe skip the DJ, though.)
---
"Will (Can) the Circle be Unbroken" would fit well, especially if they could use the Carter Family version. However, that's still under copyright, but covers or even older recordings could work. But, then again, BioShock Infinite already used ia version of it. Hymns done in a Country/Folk style would work.
---
Any 30s/40s/50s Folk would do well here, too, especially songs with themes of Social Activism and Worker's Rights. (With all the automation and civil unrest in pre-war Appalachia, it makes perfect sense.) Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie.
---
I can’t play it anymore without perk load outs, it’s sooo good and it’s all just : go to perk UI. solo ? Press 1, crafting ammo, press 2, in group press 3, and so on.
---
If I have to scrap one more houseplant because I got another issue of Scout’s Life, I’m going to hang myself.
---
It’s very satisfying, especially with everyone and their mother complaining about how they don’t have the “drive” to log on and grind. Playing with a bow and arrow and a two handed side kick has increased the fun for me!
---
Have a look at this guide, looks like you’re just safe. Hopefully we smash the BOS event and get lots of bonus challenge stuff. (I’m rank 42 so I guess I’ll be spending atoms, I gotta get that Jangles backpack)
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/
---
Do I need an entire set of power armor to use the jet pack? Or can I just use power armor and a jet pack. Because I think I only have plans for a full set of ultracite and excavator...
---
Scrap all the stuff. Some scrap can be bulked and then sold to vendor bots.  Other scrap can’t be bulked, but it can still be sold to the bots. 
---
Before I got FO1st I would keep less than 100 of each scrap item.   Usually for some scrap it was far less. fertilizer - I rarely needed more than 10 so why hold 200?  
---
I keep scrap I needed - lead, steel, acid, cloth, plastic. Beyond that I sold it all. I never keep non-legendary weapons or armor. I scrap it all
---
Are you on xbox?
---
Check this guide, you should be safe if you’re 70 now.
---
Glad to know I’m not the only one. Its only been the last few days iv had 90% of three stars dropping one star loot. originally i wrote it off as buggy game but its pretty much killed my energy to farm. Didn’t try vault 79 but iv had it happen repeatedly at the other farming spots.
---
Is it sad that I get more excited about what wacky new bugs will be introduced in new updates rather than the new content itself?
---
And how do I get this?
---
Damn.  The fast travel mat was such a fantastic thing in FO4...was that a mod?  I can’t remember.  
---
No more wondering if I’m going to spawn between my water purifiers or inside a foundation block.
---
You think he might be some robotic relation of Ward? Just funny but, unlike Ward
---
You'll need stable Flux to craft the jetpack (you can normally find PA jetpack recipes in player vendors for 200-2000 caps) might be difficult to get the flux at 35
---
Same to you
---
West tek is pipe. Pipe is life. West tek is life. Life is perfectly preserved pie.
---
Im on pc, why?
---
You only need the torso.  But you DO need the full set for the excavators abilities to work
---
Cannot believe I have to manually play Uranium Fever everytime I hop into Blackwater Mine
---
Using Master Shotgunner, Demolitions Expert, and Grenadier all benefit the Gauss Shotgun. Then there's the likes of Bobbleheads and magazines for extra explosives damage and explosion radius. Without perks, the GS is good, but with those boosts? It can absolutely shred entire teams, if they aren't paying attention.
---
Thing is, there's enough different weapons and builds for NW that it's still absolutely possible to get demolished no matter what you use. If you spec in to something enough, there's gonna be a weapon for you to utilize it best.
---
I ran West Tek and Whitespring, no 3-star. At that point I said fuck it and did a quick SBQ. Got it easily from that lmao
---
This happens to me in particular with sentries and hunter mirelurk legendaries. Like the game doesn't know what to do with their Shari when they ragdoll in death.
---
I sort of wish I kept my 2 shot explosive Harpoon Gun, but I  like caps more
---
My dailies quests reset at 8pm est every day
---
How would you normally collect flux?
---
So ideally I could find some level 35 power armor somewhere and use that until I have an actual blueprint... do I have to buy the blueprint for a jet pack or can I find one?
---
I'm not sure.  You could try looking on the wiki
---
I was doing the old bush wookie routine today to get the score.
---
Got out of the shower and checked and was in top 10,  moved to a new bush and went to get dressed.
---
Ended up being #1 but still didn't get enough xp for the level.
---
Dear God, I would love that. I would love ZAX give news updates like Mr. New Vegas but in his own kind of way.
---
I want to take you seriously, but your username makes me giggle too much.....
---
;)
---
Go into a nuke zone and kill mobs that drop materials (hardened mass, glowing mass, and high radiation fluids) and then picking vegetation in the nuke zone to get nuked flora for the rest of the material for it
---
Thanks, makes me feel better. I'm definitely hitting those numbers
---
So for a newish player can anyone link me a good description of how the legendary system works please. I'd greatly appreciate it.
---
Sounds about right. It’s stuff like this that has been ruining my fun with the game. That and this Score system has really ruined my desire to play.
---
Does it actually stack?
---
No man I'm saying look at the armor it literally looks untextured😂
---
Bedtime stories.  I want him to tell me the story of the mile miner. I want a hug from ZAX
---
That would be nice 👍 
---
Also another way to get gum if you need it is the Faschnaut Collectron.
---
My bad for not saying so, No I'm on PC.
---
100% guarantee it's something to do with the engine.
---
I see all my plans at 5 caps each, sometimes 1 because why not
---
Edit, wrong post response at the same time. Lol. Was going to offer my old t60, I have two
---
Could I use a t60 jet pack with non t60 parts? Because I don’t think I can use t60 parts at my level...
---
I can respect that, I do enjoy the design like you said but still that color scheme and how (I keep using "untexted") it looks im not the biggest fan of that
---
Alright I’ll try my best... how do I get the blueprint now...
---
Pretty good idea tbh those snallygasters do give a lot of acid and are easy to kill. I'll have to try that! Ty
---
Very detailed guide! Thank you for that I'll have to bookmark it.
---
If loose screws were 1 cap apiece I’d buy however many thousands you had available, just to be able to finally unlock all the handmade rifle mods.
---
I got one. Once upon a Time there was a Mole Miner. This Mole Miner had a 20% of living due to the many of the candidates moving around the area. This Mole Miner died after getting shotgunned to the face by candidate Robbie_T_John. The data showed it and the data didn't lie. Good night candidate.
---
My day is ruined.
---
You are good then, dont worry
---
I had legit Mounted Heads that I couldn't even unload at 5 caps. I don't sell most plans higher than 20 caps and still, many just sit there.
---
I finally took the Mounted Plans and found some Single Digit Level Newbies and gave them away.
---
Also grinding my gears, 5000+ caps for a garbage one Star tire iron? I almost would like to buy one when I need a cap sink and beat the seller repeatedly to death with it.
---
Make a mule? If not, I can try and help.
---
You cant to both of those questions
---
All the Golden oldies
---
What a nice thing ❤
---
Care to explain what a mule is I’m level 23
---
Yes it downloads with the game update
---
Agreed.
---
I do about 20%, just to clear them out when a newer player swings by my camp (I'm at the south end of the Savage Divide, so, pretty out of the way). Not a lot of exciting stuff, but most of it is unique enough not to triple or quadruple up on much.
---
I actually see more sales out of ammo than anything else; plans rarely seem to go, regardless of who comes by. But I get the occasional decent sale, so I keep them in stock.
---
How do you have max stash weight at level 23 ?
---
That's not how that works at all.
---
I would gladly give all of my scrip for a legendary Fixer. I'm around level 150 and I've never even seen a legendary fixer, NOT ONE.
---
As far as I know it doesn’t. You only benefit from one Strange in Numbers perk card.
---
I believe stacking worked for lock picking when we tried it.
---
Another character just for weight
---
I like to build stuff so I have a lot of junk and I have a lot of weapons that are like lvl 50 and 45 also I have tons of power armor armor and chassis
---
Just FYI  - not all locations will give lead if someone else grabbed it before you got there. 
---
It’s a good route, though.
---
The weapons you have, are they legendary or not?
---
Haha thank you mate, i really appreciate your kindness but im almost level 50 now so dont worry, other newest player might need it more than i
---
I've been playing this game long enough that I heard the same argument when they introduced the scrip vendor and now it's regarded as a staple part of the game.
---
Some yea
---
You need to scrap those weapons and armor if they aren’t legendary. And if they are, sell them or turn them in for 150 scrip/day.
---
Put the armor on the chassis if you haven't yet, it'll still only take up 10 pounds
---
But I have like mini gun lmgs gauss rifle stuff like that
---
Don’t dailies add up to over 1,000 score ? 
---
If you get all the exp buff while doing your dailies you should get atleast 50,000 exp (500 score) per game session. 
---
Don’t skip some of the public event they give lots of exp
---
Brotherhood of Cork, amirite?
---
I sell everything for no more than 99 caps - most things between 10-50.  I like to think I make someone's day when they find a deal.  I mostly sell camp plans from whereever and ultracite armor plans I get from scorch beat queen battles.
---
Wow ok I’m like brand new to the game thanks for all the ways to help me!
---
Yea at least cult members drop those now.
---
at close range bows can deal tons of damage, I consistently hit harder with my bloodied compound bow than my bloodied lever action.
---
Considering how atrophied their muscles are it's pretty fucking stupid. But Bethesda is the King at pretty fucking stupid.
---
Omg that would save so much space thanks
---
Sure thing. Also when you scrap them it will unlock mods for crafting. That way you can upgrade your guns and armor without finding the mods to install.
---
Your best off scrapping them the mods you learn are going to be far more valuable than the weapons. If you can't use it now and it isnt a legendary then chances are you'll end up finding a better legendary variant of said weapon down the line
---
Cheers. I reckon I'll be sticking around after Game Pass.
---
 FO76 was on Game Pass or something a year or so ago, and I'll admit I didn't really get into it then, but I started afresh recently, and I've enjoyed it much more.
---
[Meshuggah - Bleed](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qc98u-eGzlc)
---
It allows you to jump higher at least with marsupial. Give it a try with a full party :)
---
I have already given out two. Not sure why I keep picking up the pieces...
---
I don't have healing factor but do have a bloodied build.  I find this bug happens when I am standing somewhere other than the ground but it is still random when it will happen.
---
Have I started something
---
Intelligence does affect how much you get from scrapping. Plastic too, I can get 12 from laser rifles.
---
Oh really , thanks also I’m pretty sure I have like 12 jet pack plans if someone wants
---
Oh ok cool
---
I have and I've never seen a difference than just one
---
I'm not a NW player (or any battle royale) but I found today that I actually enjoyed playing as I hid naked in shrubbery as long as I could, then running from bush to bush trying to see how long I could last as the storm closed in.  Made it to 4th!  Then enjoyed watching the game play out til the end as a spectator.
---
I may try drinking next time!
---
Even Whitesprings I still get multiple 3 stars. Sometimes they glitch and I can't loot the bodies which is frustrating but they're there
---
I reached the same conclusion. I know all the shielded plans but, for craftables that require flux, the serums sell much faster. And they weigh a good bit less while they’re still in your vendor, too.
---
Aahh, well all right. I took a year-ish off from playing and wanted to go back and try that event. Looks like I'll never get to now! Oh wells.
---
I use to live near there, ugh. Had to move as I got super irradiated at hearing that damn butler.
---
NMS has come such a long way tbh.  Especially with what I call the horror update
---
Exactly what the other comment said. Make another character just to hold your things so you don’t fill up your main characters stash with things you won’t immediately use.
---
What you want to do with the legendarys is up to you since there it can be hard figuring out what is of value thankfully there ks a site that calculates the value of legendary items i dont remember the name and you can also price check your items on this subreddit as well. Something to note is that bloodied and junkies weapons are some of the most highly sought after weapons but some weapons have more value with other effects such as the gamma gun wich is more valuable with quad than bloodied.
---
Ok
---
I would suggest player vendors, you can also buy them from various trainstations but it's going to be several thousand caps
---
Wait did you say bloody weapons are the most sought after if that’s the case I made a HUGE mistake
---
You could sell those for some caps, power armor plans could go for a bit
---
This isn’t a roulette wheel, or a bingo ball tumbler, or any other sort of physical RNG.  It’s a computer program with a ‘random’ number subroutine, and we all know that if there’s a way a piece of code can be bugged, Bethesda will find it.
---
Not the most but definitely some of the highest tier items. All depends on who is buying.
---
Is there any hope for a lvl 40 to get this? I think I’ve seen a three star once ever, and I ran the other way lol. I’ll try uranium fever and hope for the best.
---
Leadbelly
---
Just north of Watoga?  I see that happen a lot around there.
---
I know no ones buying them tho and my base right next to wayward (I have plans to move it) and I put the jetpacks really low caps like 50-100 and no ones buying so if you want one just name the price
---
No the ash heap near Welch
---
Oh ok I had like level 50 something bloody fat man but in was like level 3 at the time and so I dropped it and forgot about it.1man I’m a idiot sometimes
---
Watoga high has a lot of plastic plates and utensils too
---
Not what you said about T-65
---
“It looks boxey and bland”
---
Boxy and bland have nothing to do with unfinished textures
---
Find a horde event, and enjoy.
---
Not to dump all over you, but I've seen a ton of these posts today, only to get on and have every challenge other than level up (and NW, which I never do) done inside of 15 minutes.
---
I think people are just getting mass grind fatigue, because I don't think I've ever seen as many posts about the specific challenges as today.
---
I've got a 3 or 4 between main and alt, that I'm holding onto in the hope they will be useful, but I'm thinking they are just wasted space.
---
I know of the mirelurk quest, but which one is foundation?
---
Where do I craft a raider jet pack? Under mods? Because I think I might Have one of those.. and if I get one do I need raider power armor?
---
Cough....*anti-materiel rifle*...cough
---
Coal miners daughter, by Loretta Lynn (or some alternative version): River Road by Crystal Gayle. Tell them it's for Norma's boys.
---
Also how do i attach the swing anaylzer to grants saber in forging a legend?
---
I did that today, courtesy of some Crown Royal Peach and a glass of sweet tea.  ;)
---
I had an awesome moment where I was exploring the warehouse near site charlie and got mobbed by a ton of charred ghouls. Primary weapon breaks, all I have is my 10mm SMG. Been working on trying not to death loop for immersion reasons so I’m just sprinting down the road with a huge pack of ghouls following me. I ran up on mountainside bed and breakfast and kited them around the car, then sprayed it with a clip of grounds. Thing goes up and takes out almost all of them. I love the cars for that reason, being able to improvise and solve problems in the world is so satisfying !!
---
Dont worry fat mans,rocket launchers and both grenade launchers suck pretty bad they dont do nearly enough damage to warrant using them.
---
If I wanted to get 25 caps for something I would sell for 28 so the tax is paid by the buyer. I always add 10% to what I want for things.
---
If you were running any damage resistance perks with bloodied you most likely can drop them for anything else.  Without knowing what your current build is I would guess you can keep the same stats as before unless you have a lot in End for any reason, then switch that out for more Per or Agi.  Gear, just wear whatever fits your build.
---
Or just use a porta potty
---
I did Riding Shotgun tonight by myself and was lucky enough to have 4 legendary enemies spawn (2 were 3* and the other 2 were 1*) and I ended up with 4 pieces of 1* armor 😒 bleh
---
Oh ok good and also thanks for the advice about my storage
---
Thanks for the offer. I m on PC platform. I will slowly look for another replacement. May use a bloodied combat rifle with 0.38 rounds instead...
---
Too bad 0.38 ultracite mod isnt available for combat rifles
---
Son of Atom: Thanks!
---
Mine dropped at level 20 despite being level 130-something when I completed her quest line, so it's basically useless.
---
Dont worry im like level 200 and i still have storage issues
---
Not only does it not do anything to the enemy's damage resistance, it actually applies a buff on the enemy that penetrates YOUR armor and any other player's armor
---
At one point i was running weight reduction perks for heavy and weapons and shotguns so they weighed like 2kg each and carry them on my character instead of stash. But thats like 6 points of perks wasted. Then thers ammo reduction perks if you want to carry all your ammo with you too(fusion cores r p taxing on weight too)
---
Oh cool I thought I was a bad player cuz I had so much stuff
---
I think I might have a raider jetpack... what armor sets can I use with it?
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Chally
---
Clap and/or laughing emotes.   
---
Because sometimes people fall in a fissure.
---
I'd call that a reasonable price.
---
Why can't it be both.....?
---
I'll raise my glass of coconut Malibu to that
---
That. Sounds. Amazing.
---
Nah man it can just take a little bit of figuing out heck today i moved like one perk point and that allowed me to cut down my weight by like 150ish pounds also dont worry about those jet pack plans most people just throw them out cause there so common however your pricing is fair its just that most people dont need/want them.
---
Not sure what gold or online pass is, but if that is similar to the ps now for online games, it was always like that for ps players. 
---
I like the npc additions and while there are bugs that I wish they would fix, I come on everyday to play because I enjoy it still. If the game gets to a point where I am no longer happy with it, I will stop playing, period. There is no reason to let a video game get you upset in real life. They are what they are, and I’m sorry you spent so much money on the game and didn’t get everything out of it you hoped to.
---
I sell all my plans at 10caps. Recipes are 5caps.
---
Cheers!
---
Oh thanks your seem like a cool guy I’d like to play fo76 with you
---
Raider pa
---
Cheap rubber and plastic for crafting marine tactical helmets, and fusion cores that are reasonably priced (1c or less per charge point). I'll buy up cheap bulk junk as well, especially if I need to sink some caps.
---
Unfortunately at the time, a properly folded steel blade at this size was impossible to find.  What I did find was drop forged high carbon steel at 56 inches total length.  I'm on the road now so I cant weigh it, but it seems heavier than that.  Its engineered full battle ready but the blade may be thicker than a properly folded one.
---
Honestly my fravrite thing to do is get drunk and film myself playing games, haven't decided to put them on youtube yet though.
---
I just think it fun looking at the dumb things drunk me does lol, my friends in the chat have a good laugh so.
---
That's funny that, it's almost like your microwave being the same thing as your dog.......
---
Ive just been trying to help people out here and there for more tips you can always look to YouTube there are a few guides for newcomers. Also tomorrow a new end game event comes out so i suggest teaming with higher levels on public teams since from what i remember its gonna be an instance area with a max of like 8 people per instance.
---
I believe I have all of the jet pack plans but I'll take a look and see if I have some of your other plans whenever you're on
---
I've only ever seen one vendor that had them.
---
Understand that there were other weapons in the game besides Bloodied and Junkie that were viable as end game weapons.  But they were nerfed.  Two-shot is not 200% damage.   Furious doesn’t really work most of the time.  Also the range on the flamer is a joke.
---
I can understand why removing the explosive laser guns made some scientific reasoning.  But then they removed explosive from the harpoon gun???    They have the navel cannon, they now have exploding arrows,  but the idea of an exploding harpoon didn’t sit well with who?
---
It completely makes in-world sense to use explosive tip harpoons.   But like the other good weapons, these were actually effective, so they had to go...   to preserve the grind I’m guessing.   It is fun killing tweaking of the game, not balancing.   Players want to build up their character to be a little Over-Powerful.  If we wanted to grind for mediocrity then we would just get a 2nd job. LOL
---
No it's only available in project paradise.
---
Oh cool thanks man keep doing what you do it’s a great thing
---
If you are going to use a Gatling plasma, either is fine.
---
Go for Junkies otherwise.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
Yes it does. And all other mutations. You just have to be on a team with other mutants. The best.
---
Thanks and if you need help just ask the subreddit there are a lot of people who are willing to help.
---
Thanks, its weird because I dont feel the difference but it says it does.
---
On a tinkerers workbench you can craft bulk junk, this will save stash space.
---
It's not always a three star enemy either.
---
There is no known way to get rid of it. Gl.
---
Oh thanks
---
Game engine jankiness makes them twice as deadly!
---
Ok thanks
---
Except shes in a permanent flying stance just like in the game.
---
The fact it happened to both of you on 2 different servers at the same time leads me to the conclusion this was a hiccup in your internet not their end.
---
Servers have their issues and this game has its bugs but its just too much of a coincidence to think this one is on them.
---
😫😫 what a pain will stick to public groups i guess I saw moving camp could work but was trying to avoid that 😖 thanks anyway!
---
I love building the camp and decorate it! I'm A sims fan so when my husband insisted in playing fallout with him, he got me with the houses lol. I don't do crazy, cool designs like some camps I've seen, is just a normal place that i call "my apartment" 😅 but i love it, I'm always looking for decor to make it more my style 💕
---
Out of curiousity, what's causing the auto completions? I've yet to have it happen and I've played all but 2 days since the season started, but I've seen that it's been an issue for a lot of people. The only bug I ran into was that first week when the weeklies were completing at 3/5 objectives.
---
Probably used for crafting some new item that gets rewarded after the WDC event gets added.
---
Thx for letting me know!
---
The score grind machine? Wait until this next update. They want players to grind for NPCs now. Not even for their own use. If it's anything like the gold mission, all the special rewards will be in the atom shop in a few weeks anyway.
---
He said nearly every. And only low lvl zones, like forest, have bosses with less stars
---
I don't have the flux. I even know the Shielded Raider plans on one of my characters. I don't have the time or patience to server hop for a nuke zone and I don't like doing solo silo runs. If I did I would just nuke the queen anyway since I still need two more copies of the Ultracite Calibrated Shock plans.
---
Originally had high hopes for the Brotherhood return, but is this all it is?  Collect a jillion resources and get a HAT?!? If so, very uninspiring.
---
Just join a different server man. If you’re getting that alert, it simply means that the server has been live for a long time and needs to reset everything.
---
Honestly they really need to just make high level areas drop a minimum of two stars loot. Its not like it will help the horrible rng in this game and it at least gives players a better chance to get some decent.
---
I search for weapons and ammo, junk is always good depending on what it is, occasionally a disease cure. But I've got secret service armour so no point in searching for armour, my weapons are fairly good so I rarely find anything that interesting but I'll take a look. I haven't come across a plan that I haven't learnt in a long time so I'm rarely going to a camp for that but if I'm there I'll take a look. I typically sell most plans for 10 caps unless it's more rare then maybe 100
---
Whos earl?
---
Yes, I really like it. And they don't charge me $100 for a game crash box and an armor skin that makes you look like a road cone.
---
Unlike the other Fallout games, I can't see myself replaying 76 when I'm finally tired of it for good. How long has 4 been out? I don't even remember but I still play that game all the time. I can build, hoard, and sell junk to my hearts desire. 
---
Wish 76 had that feel to it, because I do love the game. It just doesn't always feel like Fallout to me.
---
That's because the mutation is bugging since a few patches ago.
---
I think the idea is that you're sacrificing protection for stealth, so the only changes I'd like are cosmetic ones.
---
Different paint jobs, or being able to wear clothes over top
---
I know!
---
Well I hate to say it, but after this Score season is over I think I’m gonna shelf fallout for a good minute. I just don’t feel that same enjoyment I had for it.
---
Saw it when I was wandering around the woods south of Vault 96. I followed it for a while, finally it stopped and let me approach. It looked directly at me, then the “world” started changing colors. Like a Nukashine trip, but more subtle.
---
I followed again, and it happened twice more. 
---
No loot but who cares! Very Zen... it made wandering much more enjoyable. Nice break from grinding for resources.
---
Man it’s probably not worth investing in but I love home defense. There’s this awesome feeling of safety in building CAMPS with missile turrets. No need to worry about a single level 5 scorched tearing my place apart.
---
is it just joining a new server? I just got the jet pack but I really don't like the looks so I want it to disappear forever
---
I think it’s the boss’ name in wendigo colossus
---
Stick it in your vendor for 1 cap each.
---
It was in the game a very long time ago. They removed it because it was too easy to reach max caps limit on the vendor
---
I found, as  short person, the tilt helps A LOT IRL
---
The new colossal problem event comes with a new named wendigo colossus it ties in with the new short  side quest they are adding in that can be accepted at foundation.
---
PC hackers duping rare items making them more common.
---
Nah, because when it rebooted, the main menu had updated with the "we'll be down for maintenance at 10:00 tomorrow" message. It always disconnects when they load the 'updating later' message. I just don't usually have so much resources on the line like this time.
---
RR Mega Stop is my favorite spot so far
---
Serendipity. I cant imagine playing without it.
---
People just need to complain about something, too many crybabies around. They want to sit at their camp, and push some magic button to summon 3 star legendary
---
Batteries Included as it saves me 150 pounds of carry capacity
---
I still hope we can craft fear nades usable in pvp. Idk if mobs could also be affected, just imagine some people spamming the sbq or wendigo colossus with these...
---
I don’t think I’ve even got all the jumpsuits. It’s ridiculous
---
Rule 10, mate.  We have requested this for a long time now.
---
I agree. I finished my score grind and I think I'm skipping their NPC grind.
---
They aren't going to program something like that when raising the cap limit would be a simple easy solution and yet they aren't raising that limit so I'm pretty sure expect nothing but start buying stuff. Buy serum recipes etc
---
Magnetic personality. I don't really use it, just for collection because the animated version is super cute.
---
Theres a glitch to do this it will most likely be patch on Tuesday
---
Yes! There's one spot, there's raiders nearby and i think the library. So. Satisfying.
---
Out of all that's bad with this build the one that gets is is why are you using blocker... you shouldn't ever be seen.
---
I play a vats sneak sniper/bloodied I get seen maybe 5 times a week most and 99% of everything dies 1 shot before it sees me.
---
Fallout 4 or Sims 4 for me when i'm not in the mood for 76
---
I love that card so much
---
Just curious what is this NPC grind you speak of? I know there’s the mass community material grind coming up. Which...🤐
---
I don’t expect anything from Bethesda. It’s just a suggestion.
---
is bloodied legendaries being nerfed again ???  What changes are being made with maintenance ?
---
Happened to me a few times. Just remember where you killed the legendary then fast travel out of there and wait about 10-15 mins. The unlootable corpse will despawn but it usually leaves behind the legendary item on the ground where the body was
---
I've never had a disconnect then... that's weird.
---
Sorry for your loss, enjoy NMS. I haven't tried the new update yet but hear it's good.
---
I've been getting the "very well rested" bonus since before they even brought the lunchboxes in.
---
It's usually when I first log in, and I have my ally's quest complete, so maybe it's something to do with that?
---
What a stupid shit. First thing after login i open my map to see what kind of challenges i got today. NEVER had them autocompleted
---
I can't believe nobody mentioned the car behind the mistress of mystery mansion. It's only one van but it's loaded full of gas canisters so you get an especially good bang for a single vehicle
---
Three stars are not routine at Uranium fever.  That's pure nonsense.  It's random.  And you have to get a hit on it.  I f there is some douche there one hit killing everything then you are out of luck.
---
I completed the three star legendary challenge tonight just by getting lucky. I killed a three star legendary super mutant at Huntersville.   I have found three star mutants at huntersville somewhat often.  I won't mislead you and say that it's routine, but it might be worth checking out.
---
Three star legendary spawns are always random, I don't care what anyone here says. The only guaranteed 3 star spawns are the scorched beast queen, encrypted, and project paradise.       And success at all three is dependent upon having other players there who know what they are doing.  And it also depends on the game working right. Crippling perks have not worked on the queen since Wastelanders.   I launched a nuke at the queen tonight and we failed because she barely landed at all. And when she did land we were too busy fighting the shit ton of adds that were getting thrown at us.  That's one aspect of the event that's wildly inconsistent.  Five death claws, 80-100 scorched, 6 Yao Guai, 5-6 rad scorpions, four other scorched beats, and a non stop barrage of mongrels and mirelurk spawns and mirelurk kings and queens and hermit crabs  kept pounding away at us.  I ate through 50-60 stimpaks and still failed the mission.
---
Cool, are we just guna have to stumble across this like grafton pawn or will we get prompts for it?
---
GANG GANG
---
You just reminded me I need to restock my oddities vendor. I’ve got like 20 death claw hides, 30 diffusers, and a bunch of other random bits like rare outfits. I’m on PC if you are
---
I feel like the cap is intentional. I might be wrong but maybe they have cool plans for the future like people becoming a Mr House themselves, running millions of caps a day
---
This just reminded me of the time I accidentally scrapped my Protective Brotherhood soldier suit, never saw it on sale since then
---
Yes especially after writing lyrics to it.
---
It depends on how late you started, what rewards you want, and if there is any vacation time.  Every little bit of score helps while trying to race the clock.
---
I use HDD on my PC, and open map first to check challenges, so thats just some false info
---
i just buy 3 bullets.
---
i've seen so many people selling chem bench plans for 250+.
---
We call it "the skill-cannon".
---
Raider PA starts at 15. T-45 starts at 25. T-51b starts at 30. T-60 starts at 40. All can use jet packs.
---
Certainly could be - must read back up on it a little later.
---
Then believe it to be false. Its based on mine and others' experience and i havent heard anything negative about it occurring after it. But thank you for the opinion.
---
I did uranium fever and there was a couple 3* mole miners. I was glad because I didn't think I'd get that one
---
Robot legendaries exploding into non existence is something they shouldn't change.
---
I love playing death roulette for a 1star pitchfork from a 3star.
---
What they said for perks; Empath for mutations and of course EP for torso mod.
---
The entire premise of Vault 79 lore wise is they want gold.  They only gave you some because you saved their asses and from  that point onward the idea is you give it back to them in exchange for goods.  Would it make much sense for them to have a machine in the corner that gives you more gold right back?
---
I've had it happen in vault 79 but I've found if you go to the area the enemy fell and search a little a loot list will pop up, just the body is invisible. Not sure if that's always the case though.
---
Ehhhh....
---
I can 1hit you with a headshot from 400 yards away with a scoped lever action.
---
It all depends on the situation.
---
600 lbs? You’ve been breaking it down right?
---
I logged in, scanned the map, fast traveled to a radtoad horde in the mire, one shot a level 28 three star rad toad and was done.  People just like to bitch.
---
Nvm figured it out
---
Thank yooou!
---
Look for the other ship. It moves 1 space a day. As long as you stay ahead of it you’re fine. I’ve missed over a week’s worth at this point (close to 2 really) and I’m still like 5 spaces ahead. The repeatable XP challenge really helps ( I’m always in Builder groups with the 15% xp perk, and half of my characters run bloody unyielding so ~20 or more int)
---
With wastelanders update they changed the drop rates, someone here did some math and counted several hundred legendary enemy's with their loot.
---
He ended up that a 3* has a 33,33% of dropping 3*, its equal to have 1* and 2* drop from 3* enemy's. It's a bit unfair since not all legendary enemy's are 3*, making the possibility of a 3* drop even worse.
---
PS4. I've gotten the disconnect when they change the menu since beta. You really should take a look at the NMS update.
---
It's a public effort :) any contribution you can make is appreciated
---
I usually get about 350
---
I mean it's all random (ARG), but you can craft legendary secret service armour till you get unyielding or, for other armors, you could use a trading server or subreddit to find the type of armour that you desire.
---
Ah shitzer. Thanks, good to know.
---
Kill legendary enemy's. Roll armour at the purveyor. Hit player vendors (I sell my meh uny rolls for 1-3k in mine depending on rolls and type). Going to the market sub is your best bet though (will alps be the most expensive)
---
Yeah that. To build a building for the brotherhood NPCs. Not to enrich your own camp.
---
So many people don't know about this it amazes me
---
Happens on my characters with out healing factor even my brand new ones.
---
I agree. I feel like if youre going to melt her and rob everyone else you should do it in a private server.
---
Its an npc that gives you the quest so im assuming that it will start in the misc tab or the side quest bar as a "Speak to ___"
---
I sell shielded for like 1.2kish (one click over with the bumper i think) really dont sell to many
---
Bro pretty sure I just seen this one too just a few mins ago lol
---
Big bad John. We need big bad John. It's a game with a lot of mining. The right answer will always be big bad John.
---
Jesus Christ...
---
Every day you log in, do your dailies which should take FAR less than 1-2 hours and for the VAST majority of the board that gets you a rank up.  That's what  they're talking about.
---
There is no fucking way they would make it so that beyond that you could continue to just crank out another rank every 1-2 hours... people would have finished this shit within the first week if that was how it worked.
---
The fact this needs to be explained... I was expecting this thread to go in an entirely different direction when I clicked on it and after reading the actual OP I just sort of stared blankly at my screen for a while.
---
The game already does that but in the case that the game decides that youve to wait to fast travel youre screwed.
---
And the market subs, often allow you to search for very specific items and even put out played mssions for people to get the item and selling it to you. (Of course everything is played by caps, in-game.)
---

---
That my commando build. If you want to run rifles just switch those perks
---
Yeah that is probably the same then. PS4
---
That was a crap-ton of gorillas!
---
The map is so retardedly big that this is an incredibly rare event.
---
Nope. Excavator and ultracite don't have headlamp mods
---
The trick is to whip up some fixers/handmades in advance and then when you see a newb drop your emergency tent and grab it.
---
Cannibal + Lead belly, i make food to go.
---
Junkies 100%. It's a 50% damage boost. If using heavys you should be running stabilzed, that already gives you an aa boost. Tuning an aa gun with stabilzed will give you like a 12% boost. It's junkies no question.
---
It doesn’t take any skill though
---
Well I just don’t see how everyone is going to gather the amount of scrap they’re requesting. Especially the cork and concrete. The only way I see any of this happening is from the FO1 members contributing from their bottomless scrap boxes. 😢 But the unlocks aren’t really worth it. Plus that and this event is still going on while people are trying to wrap up the score before the season ends. Who would have time to focus on material gathering.
---
I did that earlier... fuckit ill take credit. No problem stranger, thanks for having something worth spending caps on.
---
Sure, but imagine someone chases you with flaming spinning chainsaw, while you're on a brink of your health, screaming "LET ME HEAL YOU!!!". A bit unnerving, don't you think? :P
---
Use the strangler heart
---
That's exactly what i'm doing if it ever gets adressed!
---
Somebody threatened me after I killed them for their bounty but it was obvious they were full of shit as nothing even happened!
---
Though the first time I claimed a bounty, internet was shut off not even 5 minutes later!
---
Good evening, it is I, your president, John Henry Eden. Did I ever tell you the tale of the little patriot that could? In all of his time, there was never another stronger than he...
---
Wait. Wrong computer.
---
No. The game would explode if we could do that.
---
sadly no. in fact every time I die fighting her the game decides to drop me right in the middle of the zone. on top of this 5 times out of 10 it makes me wait to fast travel making my demise inevitable.
---
Haha sucks to suck
---
Whenever I encounter the insult bot I think of the German built humor bot from that South Park episode
---
I read the entire post. They just suck, so mods are kinda irrelevant......🤔
---
That's the point. The gun does not require skill, all you have to is shoot on the ground. The gun provides the skill.
---
&gt; even if it takes 5 years.
---
That's funny because I found a bloodied ultracite laser gun a few days ago and wanted to try it out and see how strong it could get ... and it's actually worst than regular laser weapons in most cases. Also the sniper barrel shoot regular red beams for some reason. Found a [*1 year old* post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/awt858/a_reminder_that_ultracite_laser_guns_are_still/) on this sub asking to fix this.
---
When you add the explosive weapons and the magic effects to the list, it doesn't leave a lot of space to make niche/fun builds.
---
Starched genes. Makes me keep my jumpy, speedy, smart-y and other-y mutations, I'm so weirdly inept without.
---
I think just project paradise for me. Might be an Enclave event or 2 I haven't done but their basically all the same event anyways so I'm not counting that
---
If it helps, you'll probably find one soon. I didn't get one until around level 200. The wait sucks, but once you get one you'll start accumulating them over time. If you have the plan, mumbles will drop them for you too.
---
Also lost my right leg twice on my alt within 3 weeks. I surely don't dropped or scrapped it, it was just gone when I logged in.
---
Also i noticed some missing items on mules of my comunity where everything were on spreadsheet for trading.
---
Found the first year cyber security student.
---
Ye, I have a free table at my place to get rid of unwanted loot
---
And yet a damn magazine rack takes up a huge chunk of your build limit.
---
I share perks but anyone who removes my rads like that will have a nuke dropped on their base real quick. I usually share perceptibobble because before public teams I never personally used it and I figure it would be a little convenience for whatever team I land on.
---
Plus, you can have lots of the content 76 has, lots it still doesn't, *and* tons of mods.
---
It happens randomly when entering a server yes, I get it to appear by re-equiping the chest. I'm not sure if you can leave it invisible, it will probably re appear when you join a new server, your best bet is probably just to remove the hetpack mod entirely.
---
You already have it.
---
Does lone wanderer and nerd rage also work?
---
Basing on my knowledge, this only happens when they know your IP address(This is not that hard because you are communicating with them), and the remote web access options on your router were set to "Allow"(In this case, anyone who types your IP address in a browser could see a login webpage.  ), and the user name and password of the router is default one such as admin/123456(Different ISP or brand have different default password).
---
With those, they can log in your router remotely and reboot the router or change the setting that could make the router disconnected. The reason why they said the wrong town is that sometimes IP address mapping isn't that accurate.
---
I hope you don't mind me (a pve player) giving my input. I say there should be two diffrent kinds of servers. Pve and PvP
---
It should also work with flamers haha. It's stupid I have to bash npcs with it to get it to work
---
It's still not forcing you. You can grind out exp in adventure mode, use atoms, or just accept that you started too late to get all the rewards. People *choose* to go afk in nuclear winter because they believe they're entitled to the score rewards without actually playing the game
---
I tried the bow but vats was terrible.  Missed constantly even at 95%. Combined with the slow fire rate it just wasn't sustainable.
---
Yes that whole legendary scrip thing is a fucking ripoff.  I just spent 300 scrip trying to get a range weapon I like.  I had to go back to my stash and cash out more legendaries a couple of times.  Kept getting a slow ass double barrel.  A rifle would have been nice.  I’m only Level 27, but the many, many monetary style systems are really wearing on me. I may toss in the blue suit soon.
---
Sounds similar to the riven reroll system in Warframe. I do not think it is a bad idea.
---
I agree, but i'm 99% sure Bethesda has forgotten the chainsaw even exists.
---
You could “over condition” weapons and armour and get a “boost” in effect.
---
I'm sort of new to the game. Only lvl45. 
---
It doesn't seem to be worth extracting the materials from the workshops. Especially on a public server. 
---
I build up the machines, only to have them destroyed by some lvl 200+ judas with a mini gun. 
---
Then what do I have? It just seems I'm better off finding and scrapping junk.
---
Guys just have your camp at the wayward and be below 50 and people will give you free legendarys
---
Maybe have the loser also drop a certain percentage of their ammunition? I’ve played the game for a little less than a month, so my opinion isn’t very valuable, but it’s one of the few things I can imagine being dropped thats tolerable. Either that, or a certain percentage of caps, and even a bracket of caps for certain people (higher percentage for people with &lt;1000, &lt;5000, &lt;10000, etc)
---
I restarted my game when a buddy of mine placed one in my camp. It erased it. Almost ruined my 76 experience. I like to earn my shit rather than cheat the game
---
Can you tell me how the modules work?  I have no idea.  Just made it to the rusty pick for the first time tonight and blew all my scrip trying to get a nice rifle, ended up just getting 3 stupid double barrel shotguns in a row.  Pissed me off.  Are the modules worth effort?
---
Ooooo... TIL!
---
I dont know, its really not that difficult to find them.
---
Lefty here. Due to astigmatism in my left eye, I do a whole bunch of aiming with my right except when it comes to shooting with a rifle, because I find it easier and more comfortable to aim with a scope. My bow hand is left.
---
Great idea.
---
Both the building and figuring out the right spot to put the next camp
---
I’ll also just thank you for it, I’m enjoying decorating my camp
---
I mean, I was out by the Whitespring Resort, but thanks for the info.
---
Refund policy on steam still holds.
---
You can donate it to me😄😄😄😄😄😄
---
Lol ikr, " loot quick before it explodes!"
---
Quadruple the yield of all resource nodes at workshops.  Boom, done deal.  :)
---
Funny. I have close to 400 hours in the game and have only done that event 4 times. 3 of those have been in the last 4 days. Every time, I get 2 level 62 charred ghouls and thats it. I sit there for the remainder of the event and nothing else shows up. The very first time I did the event(when the game came out), it spawned numerous super mutants. I dont know why.
---
Np
---
haha
---
You actually can cancel the shot, though- holster the weapons. Same as any other charging weapon.
---
However - bows definitely need some help. Aside from your points, bows lack the crowd control you desperately need in this game and are only really usable from stealth. Damage is good enough compared to rifles, but it doesn’t matter if I can kill one charred ghoul when six more are rushing at my face. I need to be able to kill them all quickly, not slowly pick them off.
---
I think improving all of the special arrows types to have a larger (and in the case of explosive/fire, more effective) AoE and the status effects need to do more when they apply would be the best solution. The other is letting us have an option to shoot the bow faster or have multiples arrows in a clip somehow.
---
Also, if bows are scaling with any stat, it should be perception. I know it makes less sense from a logic standpoint, but all of it’s perks are in perception, and it would be strange to invest in an unrelated stat for extra damage.
---
This is correct.
---
An calculation error cause this problem, where you seem to be full life but the game calculate the last hp in % and healing factor try to restore it, so the game says you take damage. Updating the server status by either update your position, take damage or use something that affect the health points fix this.
---
I also removed healing factor on all my chars once, but after a few days without a single fast travel bug it occurs again. I mostly just kill myself (since I don't care about junk anymore) or shoot with a harmless explosive weapon on my feet. Alternatively you just can walk a few steps or take radaway, drink or eat something etc.
---
Hopefully they accidentally bring back Grafton University this time haha
---
I can make and sell in my vendor....if on xbox, I will make if u have super stimpaks
---
The cryptids are great and the music is fantastic.
---
You can still get refunds on Steam, BUT I don't know if your free trial counts towards your 2 hours of playtime or how long steam counts you as "owning" the game for (normally 2 weeks is the max refund period) I dunno if that takes into account playing it months ago, even during a free trial.
---
Theoretically you should be safe to refund, the catch would be getting through to a human should the 2 hour/2 week thing cause a problem with the auto refund system.
---
So it should be simple, shoot at it only if you are on the ground in the open. Otherwise, just wait till it lands.
---
just give it away, you dont need to get caps for everything
---
excellent, thank you. i'm going to grab it now.
---
Personally I enjoy the scraping and crafting.
---
Wouldn't the traffic be routed from the ISP to their home? Thus effecting (or is it affecting?) everyone else? I know some ISPs use the large scale nat because we are literally running out of IP address.
---
Figure it's best to ask you since you probably know wayyyy more than me. What do you do there? I'm really interested in networking and plan on taking my NET+ within the next 6 months. So any information you can give me would be awesome. I'm not afraid to admit I was wrong and learn from it!
---
Really? Wow i didnt even know that..
---
Look up final render on YouTube
---
They are also canonically newer and less worn out than most of the other armors in the game.
---
fortunately not an issue because the free trial was on the bethesda launcher. Thank you for the response though, i was worried this post would be misconstrued as some kind of trashing troll post.
---
Have tried that but no luck 😫 think I'm gonna have to destroy my camp 😪 yeah im the same or will trade ive just reached level 125 😁  and with super duper on you can make more then enough ammo in minutes so it's just an eye sore more then anything 🤣 thanks anyway!
---
Lol expect a nuke when you do that :)
---
Good to know, then there's no issue in trying it on Steam :-)
---
And sometimes the burrows has one two star legendary.  People here  keep talking about random spawns as though they were guaranteed. They aren't. Nowhere close.  For a while I was routinely finding three star ghouls outside missile silo Charlie. The last few days there have been zero.   That is how it works.  Three star Legendary spawns are never guaranteed  unless it's Scorched Earth, Encrypted, or Project Paradise. And successfully killing those depends on having enough players and/ or the event working like it's supposed to. Which it often doesn't.
---
Last I recall, weapons do reduced damage when they're at low-durabilty/close to breaking. Not sure if it has always been that way but I'm thinking that it has been.
---
i never had the fast travel bug until the last update hit, since then 2/3 times i try to travel somewhere.
---
the respawn only at vault 76 bug wasnt fixed either, i had it only 2 times happen since last update which is a big improvement but still not good enough
---
Yeay more ghillie skins, also more pa skins like we don't already have way too much.
---
How about some skins for weapons we don't have much skins now? 10mm smg, assault rifle, combat shotgun and so on.
---
(Skin =/= paintjob)
---
My main doesn’t have Healing factor, never has an issue (Same for my 3rd) my Alt does have healing factor and can experience this.
---
Ye, probably have to rebuild the camp. I got lucky I guess
---
I don't know man, i recently got an instigating  explosive hunting rifle, my main is a lvl 115 sniper and this was legit the first legendary hunting rifle i have gotten, it absolutely rekts, but i dropped the game a couple of months ago specifically because i kept getting heavy weapons, game aint fun if rng keeps fucking you.
---
Holy crap, that is definitely a long sword! I can see how that might actually be heavier. That's considerably longer than an "average" nodachi. At that point you're practically wielding a solid metal polearm rather than a sword lol. I'm sure the immense size combined with the extra weight it gives it makes it feel even heavier than it is.

I'm less knowledgeable on how nodachi were actually used in combat, but I'm sure using them similarly to European greatswords would work. Wide continuous sweeping motions that utilize the hefty blades extra momentum to keep it moving and it's extra reach that can potentially keep back multiple attackers around you. I just cant imagine any sword that long handling particularly well any other way (unless they were meant to be used on horse back or something).
---
Definitely! At least you didnt have to rebuild, gonna take me forever 😅🤣
---
You have caught me on a good day. *throws some at his feet*.
---
Or if they’re so hard set on timegating then I wish they would outfit the vendor with daily sets of weapons/armor you can buy that randomize every day and reset every week. So Monday you’d be given the option to buy specifically 1,2,3* assault rifles &amp; combat armor pieces, then  things would switch up every day until resetting the following week
---
Oh thank yousssssssss (best smeagol i could do lazily)
---
That dose not happen
---
I’d like to see casual players have a chance at defending themselves. I pvp a lot, and I still get worn out by certain people, it’s pretty broken. The damage cap is dumb, the aid stacking is dumb, the ammo glitch needs to be addressed, and the current jetpack meta is trash. I’m mediocre at best, and it’s rare that someone I don’t know gives me a run for my money. I think people who don’t normally pvp would be more interested in engaging if the result wasn’t almost always a complete rinse.
---
Or just buff or rework legendary prefixes, so that builds other than bloody, junkie are the go-to. I adore this game, but it needs a lot of work. Their is little viable build diversity. By no means am I saying, that a character running all 7s on stat points cannot be good at the game. Yes you can beat down ghoul hordes with your baseball bat, but your not going to be as good as the drug addict with a switch blade, or the murder hobo on the brink of death leaping around like a frog. 
---
Paying for type of weapon would be nice...I do not see Bethesda doing this. The search for your personal Moby Dick is the 76 endgame.
---
We had that for a while, it was great.
---
I go on nukatrips a lot and run back to my camp unarmed and the lack of really anything i come across makes my little game way less fun. Still do it but i wish i had more resistance as i hike across the map
---
At the start of the game melee weapons and armour were both stronger when repaired over 100%
---
Planet of the apes
---
Wasnt whitespring confirmed somewhere? Gotta check devtracker, I would bet I saw somewhere a bethesda reply related.
---
Pretty sure it's one of the generic camp plans you get from taking over workshops or looting stuff like ice machines, toolboxes, etc
---
and 18/19 steel from an assault rifle, 10 plastic from energy rifle. West tek is really a good place for farming those.
---
Don’t know why you’re getting down voted when your right. It’s always been this way for teams, don’t see why it would be different now. 
---
I can understand why some people might not like it this way, but it’s not a bug.
---
My vendor for 776c
---
I'm a nw player and I'm ok at it and I can get wins every other day or so. I believe they should just make all the perks unlocked already so everyone can be on a level field.
---
And nerf/fix the m79 + auto version.  That thing is cancer 
---
Oh and add new maps as well as make weekly rewards a thing 
---
Increase XP for kills yield instead of time spent (I'm really starting to hate bushers 😑) . Like 50 xp per kill and 5 xp per minute.
---
Ah yes that must have been it! I thought I remembered always over-repairing my all rise to get a damage boost. Any clue why it was changed?
---
That’s dumb. Do you know if the T-65 has them?
---
I'm not sure it works like that. Damage and swing speed vary wildly depending on the kind and type of melee weapon.  
---
Unarmed melee weapons (Deathclaw, Powerfist, etc) do noticeably more damage than the other melee categories.
---
You might be able to use this damage calculator to find your answer:
---
 https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html

Not really. I'm assuming the boost wasn't intentional so they got rid of it
---
Xbox? Come by my Vendor. (Raider that is, over 100 Queen of the Hunt and still no Casual, 5% drop rate my arse)
---
I don't know about that one
---
Much like other PvP in MMO- people can't build for pve AND PvP effectively and you're either geared for one or the other.
---
Also iirc the Devs crunched their numbers and actually released a statement about how low the PvP engagements were. They noted it was a pve explorative player base.
---
Works best with the settler well due it's long animation time. I'll get about 50 dirty water out of one animation, depending how fast you can smash the related collect button.

Opens stash and looking at the 3 different nocturnal laser pistols i got in a row  yesterday.
---
2500 is pretty much a ripoff price. 
---
Back when I did sell them (All bar Marine and Casual) I priced them at 1200 or less (Enclave 800 for example) and even then they moved very slowly.
---
low level horde  events are a bitch
---
I have a character slot empty just so whenever this comes up I can create a new character, run through exiting Vault 76, then jump into NW. It takes hardly any XP to get your first NW level on a new character, so you are pretty much guaranteed to do so in one game (unless you are killed almost immediately).  Saves a lot of time.
---
How dare ye even jest regarding the removal of my precious but easily acquired rads. That’ll be one thermonuclear warhead on YOUR base.
---
The stories of the dead factions. 
---
I know it is cool to bash on Beth for the storytelling but I think they nailed it for the Responders, Raiders, Free States, BoS and the Enclave. 
---
The tape and notes all tell the lives and hopes of people after the apocalypse. You can sense their happiness and resolve as things are getting a little bit better. Then desperation as the raids, deaths and plague wipe everyone. Some holotapes made me emotional a little. 
---
The Mistress of Mystery is a good example of such a narrative.
---
I am not far into the Wastelanders (lvl 206 but i play really slow), but I can already see the same kind of stories: people struggling to survive by any means, some more violent and destructive than others of course. 
---
I played FO4 a ton, I loved it. But the main story left me uninterested and there were many places with clearly cut content (Combat Zone, robots race park, etc). FO76 is a huge improvement. 
---
Honorable mentions: music, DJ of Appalachia radio, public events.
---
Happened to my Mom some years back. I was like, "what the hell, that's a thing?"  
---
Her face and neck would get all splotchy and somewhat swollen. Did NOT look fun.
---
Really? Seems a bit odd because I remember not too long ago on one character, I would go through the whitesprings golfclub with a non-legendary hunting rifle and quietly one-shot everything to grind xp. After a bit, I suddenly wasn't able to one-shot them, repaired my gun, and then everything was back to normal.
---
cant nuke near Wayward, im safe.

Consistently drop fps.

Probably just a visual glitch.

On my lower-level alt I will usually see scrip/bullion amounts for my main

Yes i need an "i'm sorry". I do be fuckin up sometimes
---
Lode bearing event really need a fix for mining ore. I know there are better places for some materials, but low-mid level players might appreciate a rather chill event to mine some ore while bashing mole miners.
---
Sure you didn't accidently collect bullion from legendary run?
---
Glad to hear people who actually like NW aren't put out by the flood of folks who just want the S.C.O.R.E.  We're happy to help.

There are several magic effects. Instigating and junkies both trigger the effect

it also happens on PS4 these people are fucking clowns  who suck at any game its every game  no matter the  game seige everything it honestly disgusting

I'm at one charisma
---
Dont you understand the consept high risk/high reward? I have to be very carefull with a bloodied build but if I play full health I can just go guns blazing. 
---
Playing with less than 20% health makes you think twice before making a choice. Also, you can be a tank and do very good damage with full health as well. Just stop complaining and fix your build!!??

There's the Teddy bears, or the chess pieces

I like to share QoL perks, as the one reducing the weight of chems. I have 10 Charisma, so full effect for everyone! 
---
I used to share Bloody Mess but then I thought that maybe not everyone liked to search around for bits of bodies when looting.
---
Strange in numbers. Improved carry weight, jump height, defense, special stat's and better effects from eating all for the cost of 1 perk point
---

Auto grenade launchers and m79 need re balancing.  The gauss shotty is fine, it is rare, powerful when speced and is best at close and ok ish at medium range . If you are going to fight anyone with a shotgun up close without a high output damage weapon, you'll die.
---
True haha. Usually I just message a person if he has it and ask him if he can change the shared card ( almost everyone I play with is usually bloodied ) and if they dont respond, ill just kick them from the team / ill join a new team
---
You can collect Toilet paper if you want
---
I'd say that it's a visual glitch. The collections tab never updates properly. If you want to check your gold for sure, stop by any of the vendors that deal with gold bullion. That'll be your best bet.
---
Put the clown costume for maximum effect!

It’s called a dangler.   To keep people interested in the seasons.  Don’t pack all your good features into the same season. Spread it out

yep- i dont expect selectable traits, etc, but i would love to filter it to sniper options at least! i honestly burn 50 weapons for each 1 i can actually use

I share Travel Agent as I've got nothing else worthwhile and little Charisma.

Atleast I'm making jumping around cheap.

It is a shotgun.  If you fight someone up close  with an auto weapon, then you'll likely lose 😑. Grab another shotty , lever scoped or crossbow. They help

But my score challenges completed by them selves. Has anyone else had this issue?

How long will today's update take?

Why can't I craft my backpack? (glad that one's gone but it still haunts me)

I sell my canned meat stew for 100 caps and they sell well.

I got enough today to get some of my weekly caps-for-gold and got my SS jetpack

Im afraid so!

Would nuka shine help?
---
You could always roll 1* pieces at the Purveyor to land a full 5x piece set, then start rolling for 3* and hunting proactively for piece-by-piece upgrades.
---
Agreed. I ditched bow for exactly these reasons. Which is a shame because i really enjoy the playstyle in Skyrim. Sniper rifles are ok though. But i would love better bows.
---
APE NOT KILL APE
---
Shielded Secret Servive armor is alright, but ehh. If I had the raider one unlocked I would have like 8 of those for sale in my shop all the time. Perception, Agility and Luck seems better than what the SS underarmor gives. Especially considering Endurance feels straight useless when it gives zero bonus health.
---
Main is a junkies heavy explosives, alt is junkies explosive commando, tertiary and newest character is a bloodied rifleman with an emphasis on sneak attacks and vats crits. Bloodied is fun and a nice challenging change of pace. I also use a pipe revolver rifle to double dip pistol and rifle perks.
---
That’s just how it has been from the start. Why change something that works?
---
That's a possibility but I doubt it would keep anyone attention for long. Though I would imagine addressing those concerns would make pvp better but it would also keep the tension high thought the fight. What are your thoughts on the recent nerfs?
---
I would say that would be a good idea if we still had survival mode for sure.
---
I tried talking to Samuel but all he replies with is "Hello fellow vault dweller..."
---
Which ones?
---
That is reasonable price for scrip items however actual good items are worth way more than that and for some items paying the max 30k would be a steal.
---
It very much depends on what the effects are, most people are unfortunately selling garbage at extortionate prices
---
Or a handmade or a lever action... or radium rifle.
---
Yea, I don’t think Bethesda really cares about realism with weapons.
---
300c for 3* weapons? Add me buddy, ign amcasteyor
---
Especially when you lose the workshop and everything in it when the game crashes. Like it frequently does after a big update.
---
It doesn't matter now, since legendary perks have been changed and now gives bonus for the whole set of same armor, despite it being light, heavy or Power Armor - as long it's the set, the bonus works.
---
To provide correct advice here:
---
Power cycling your modem *may* do it. Most ISPs will assign a static address to the router's hardware addres (MAC)

renew/release certainly will not work for the router/household
---
Well would you buy a 3 star for 8000 caps or for 800?
---
Cryptids are really awesome. I’m super excited for the Wendigo Colossus event later today!
---
What mutation?  Not adrenalinal reaction.
---
Can't confirm. I mostly play as tanky combat shotgunner along with 1-2 g.shotguns and one rifle or explosive mate. I almost never lose a close combat, with akimbo c.shotguns I easylie disable a full squad. Range is also possible, but take up to a full mag till someone die - mostly I only shoot on range to provide suppressing fire while teammates get recovered.
---
My build is the reason I'm sometimes forced to play gauss shotgun, till I find my designated weapon. With the g.shotgun I cant shoot someone when I am unable to see his feet, i mostly cant hit them directly or if I do they take little to no damage. I need to shoot his feet, then he is pretty much rip no matter how his build or buffs are.
---
Yes! I love rebuilding in strange out of the way places. Right now i have a base built into the side of the monorail supports, so you can clamber up these stairs and platforms and onto the support itself. Heck of a view.
---
If I wanted it badly enough I would spend 8000 caps.
---
It depends on the effect. You can't base pricing sole on it stars
---
Hmmmm... if you are not running with concentrated fire then that makes sense, but I think most people are and at pretty much any range you'll be hitting headshots after the first couple of hits (with rank 3 anyway). 
---
The time when 33 would be better would be when fighting the queen and she is swooping but it I think it would be pretty close as the extra firerate might allow you to get more hits during the split seconds she is in range... Either way it's going to be close and hopefully she'll get her limb damage fixed in the next patch. 
---
Personally I would only choose 33% over ffr on non-fullauto weapons (or 'magic' ones).
---
I’ve been pvping for a while and the Mets is always changing.The damage cap is stupid people spend a lot of time changing their bios around and grinding for armor and aid items cuz that’s how you win in pvp these days.You can stack multiple different aid items to get buffs like increased hp or people spam quantum’s to heal.Ac130 builds just stay in the air and spray their Gatling plasma till you die,once they land they pop a few quantum’s then get back up there and the cycle continues.The more you pvp the more toxic it becomes at least in survival it gave pvpers a place to go instead of pvpers taking workshops and hitting low levels.The damage cap is a little annoying but I think it was necessary although I think adjustments would be good.I think they should make different modes for those pvp people in the community or kind of like a pvp tournament of sorts that will give you rewards as you progress.
---
I do get that. Caps haven't been any kind of an issue for a long time. I threw a couple into my shop to make available for others. After grinding out finding the Marine Underarmor upgrade it felt like something nice to do for others who might be looking for it. Sadly the SS underarmor kind of made the Marine one pointless unless you really want the resistance to water diseases.
---
Thank you for sharing I'm upvoting because I read this fully expecting the comments to call bullshit and am shocked this is a legit thing. And BIG thanks to people explaining how this shit works in the comments.
---
Used to get this problem playing NHL 18 on PS4 thanks to the crappy way EA matched opponents.  Sore losers could boot you before the end of the match as your IP was visible.
---
I am currently collecting legendary rolling pins!
---
Your probably right, but on my main I have close to 2k gold bullion(getting SS jet pack), i'm tempted to complete Wastelanders to see for certain.
---
Is that really where the random falling things coming from
---
It depends on what the item is. I scrip everything that isn't worth thousands of caps or worthwhile trades.
---
I felt this comment in my soul. Honestly been doing everything I can to try to get it, but honestly most of the events in the events in the Savage divide don't even seem to drop patterns at all for me. Like the game isn't even going to give me the displeasure of giving me ones I don't need while I'm trying to find the one I truly want.
---
They also just got rid of those damage reduction perks
---
I haven't had this experience. Have even travelled away from a zone and back and body was still there. Exploding Robots corpses are around, may have moved from blast though.
---
It's a personal gripe actually. Particularly in Rad Rumble and events where there is so much going on. Players get so excited to find the legendary the npc's get killed. Just leave it till done with event and then spend 5 minutes vacuuming.
---
Sound design is a peach.
---
They did come out and say that. Given somewhat recent outcries from certain parts of the community, one could argue that it is a topic worth at the very least speculating over. 
---
As for the builds and gear, you make a very fair point. Most people I know don't run assassin's anything and see it as trash (no offense to anyone that uses it). Though certain builds are effective for both pve and pvp, come to think of it
---
You earn gold, you dont buy it.  Fallout 1st isn't necessary to have a good time.
---
I've use the gauss shotgun and it can be good for attacking above provided you have skeet shooter on. Yeah combat is great up close if you land your shots. The gauss shotty suffers from major damage drop off, and I've used lever actions, crossbow when I'm on the receiving end , but I have to see them coming first .
---
I’m a veteran player and i honestly disagree with your take,
---
 yes the community is amazing but Bethesda is still doing a poorly job in properly testing and implementing content, the endgame features a lot of senseless timegates such as the stupidly low scrip or gold bullion limits that just make it more frustrating to play long term, 
---
lastly fallout first has been neglected since launch and a lot of features they promised such as persistent workshops or exclusive atomic shop discounts are nowhere to be seen.
---
Bethesda’s approach on this game has just been to develop a feature and just leave it there and start working on the next thing, they don’t usually stop and think about what needs improving or rebalancing.
---
I'd even be willing to settle for the same horrible RNG grind I had trying to get the best SS armor If it meant I could select the weapon it would be producing.
---
That's just people not selling exactly what you want, nothing s gonna change there.
---
Is this gonna be another ban wave?

But does this happen to anyone else? And why is Samuel Naked? Roflcopter, Ward get outta fucktown with your nonsense. And like why do people sell stuff for so much? And where do they even grind for legendaries? Where do I farm them? Why don't they sell me a godroll 3-star for 300 caps? Fucking dupers... just open the presents and enjoy! And while you're at it, why don't you collect some ore for Radiation Rumble?? But make sure to kill enemies. But.. don't kill the enemies omg! Don't one shot them! But like.. how do I one-shot things? And don't even get me started on how unfair it is that Bloodied Junkies do more damage than me with my "magic" effect weapons! I was killed by someone so whatever it was that they may or may not have been using needs to be nerfed and I reported for hax. But seriously... thanks so much to the guy who did the thing and I dunno if he uses reddit! It was right before my server went down. Are all the servers down? Bugthesda didn't tell us about this scheduled maintenance! And omg all the FO1st features should be given for a $2 one-time purchase, cos that makes sense for a business to do. Like 400 Atoms tops for permanent Scrap box, then they can release *a different box* so we can complain about how that one isn't free too!  
---
I got one word for you: Photo Frames!
---
Can we get a Spawn Mat (Fallout 4) for our camps. It would be nice too land in front of my camp, instead of having too walk around a mountain side because I landed behind it.
---
I do 10% too.
---
i'm just sad this game has never released new content and the new content they have released is too expensive and it takes too long plus is not long enough its just such a piece of shit i bought it for 15 dollars two weeks after it came out and literally have 2500 hours played and its just a rip off unlike new vegas which had no problems whatsoever and a story that was at least 10 hours long
---
For instance, a bloodied explosive “the fixer” you couldn’t even buy for the 30,000 cap limit. You would need to trade a butt ton of legendary weapons
---
you can sell 90% one star bloodied way more than what you are selling your \*\*\*... you are way too much underpriced, if it's not for scrip.
---
take a look here, not the most accurate, but it can help you a bit

I came here to tout the burrows. The last few weeks it’s my first loot run once I get settled in. And there is NEVER anyone there. I see people at WS, West tek, all the regular hot spots. I always have the burrows all to myself. I’ve been averaging about 3-5 legendaries per run lately...love that place.
---
I also love that
---
SBQ is a three star
---
Perhaps you're thinking Radiation Rumble
---
k
---
I'll be honest, I've barely touched NW at all since it came out. That's mainly due to playing on PC and every time I have, hackers always ruined it for me. But you make a lot of fair points.
---
It's a sad reality of the world and age we live in today. With your IP they can't really do anything so don't be too worried, but I remember my first time getting doxxed and booted on PC on GTA Online, it's a scary experience but they really can't do anything to you with only your IP.
---
How would you improved it if they brought it back?
---
How do you know the next legendary perk yet ?
---
100% agree. I don’t really read the notes and terminals in game but I listen to holotapes and watch a lot of lore videos on YT. I especially love the BoS and Raider story’s. Especially BoS because it shows another side of them. A side that actually wants to help
---
I don't see it like that. I come across legendary enemies quite often. In just 4 days of playing I get around 30 or more legendary gear. I usually trade most of the not worth it ones for script. Then sell the ones that people would like at reasonable prices.
---
bro u took my gold bullion, i completed the wastelanders story the other day and got 500 gold bullion but it never showed up in the collections tab
---
If you're on PC, there's a perk load out mod.
---
You realise legendary perks arnt dropping today right?
---
I also will still pay 1c per ammo to save me the effort of making it. Caps are easier to make than ammo. I don't think it will have that much of an effect on the market. People still have tons from the dupe anyway
---
Edit, also very few people will be able to get that card to max rank with the current system anyway
---
That honestly would probably cause a riot... No offense

 Pittsburgh/Philadelphia slang
---
Yinz
---
*Pittsburgh, PA*  
---
**What it means:** A second-person plural pronoun. Think "y'all" or "youse guys" but with a "z."  
---
People from Pittsburgh are awfully proud of this word, but it doesn't really sound anything like "you." It sounds more like a very small, shaky dog, and no one wants to be equated with a nervous Chihuahua.
---
 Jawn
---
*Philadelphia, PA*  
---
**What it means:** Almost anything. "Jawn" could be a person (i.e. "I was talking to this jawn..."), a song (i.e. "You hear that new Drake jawn?"), or even a collapsed building.
---
I\`ve seen several settlers dead by his feet so i think its a serial killer  on the loose.....
---
OH COME ON
---
On another, completely unrelated note. Am I the only one that finds it wierd that you need three different sets of perks to make long range weapons viable. Yes you have the training and skill to use this rifle, but since you did not invest enough points into perception. Your bullets are considerably weaker.    Sorry buddy, should of maxed out your cards.
---
At the very least aid stacking, damage caps and jetpacks being addressed. Lol sorry at work, things have been crazy on and off.
---
Participating in the SBQ doesn't seem to count either.
---
Thanks for the insight, this makes sense. Sounds like your health can essentially desync from what the server thinks you should have and this causes usually invisible errors with things trying to heal or regen. I'll be sure to try these out.
---
Now is the donut serving bots music that sticks to my head. It is quirky.
---
Id like an insult bot emote that instead of a little jingle or noise is just a random insult

It boot up ok I suppose lol 😆

I have no real desire for end game SQB farming. 
---
I'll burnout long before I get to the point of legend farming.
---
My main is level 76 and launching a nuke was the last thing he had to do pre wastelanders. I never got around to it as I mostly solo. 
---
Now I'm about to hit 42 on my alt and looking to actually launch one this time after I hit 50. I've got a couple of friends playing that will help.
---
However... since I have no desire to finish a silo run and then rush to pew pew every scrap of ammo I've painfully crafted on this journey in the Queens direction... 
---
I've decided I'll be nuking a random, "Why would someone nuke there?!" location. 
---
;p
---
This is the best.

Since you are on pc, take this:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
It works super well, removes the pick a perk spam and Is totally allowed by bethesda and their tos.
---
To save the loadouts you need to read the description of the site, there is one additional download. 
---
If bethesda ever release their own loadout manager I bet it wont be as good as this one.
---
There are specific spawn locations just go pick some up
---
most days I get 3 caps for 3 bullets but I've sold a number of plans and plasma cores the past couple of days. If only I could get rid of about 40 fusion cores.
---
I've tried this several times, and I always rubber-band back to my start position after 1 second of flight. Don't know why. I'm on PC...?
---
User with the name Starlin in it doesn't get how supply and demand economics works..... #irony
---
Dont drop aid on death, take away vats.
---
For the ammo converter, use the arrow keys and space bar to convert the first time, after that it'll automatically highlight the ammo you selected so you just have to spam the spacebar. Make sure you dont have any ammo below the one you're concerting in the terminal or you might accidently convert some you don't want to.
---
I'm about level 50 and I've not been trying since i got the ammo converter.
---
Fucking with it users.
---
yes, intelligence perk card at 1 cost
---
Equip those speed perks and you'll be running circles around them

For a second I thought you were holding a barret or other sniper and then realized it's an ak
---
Nah
---
Useful link, thanks! Can I assume that it’ll have to be lvl 50 to get interest? Since I’m only lvl 40 at the moment my loot isn’t that high level, but I’m starting to get more two star stuff. I’ve just been exchanging most of it for scrip though.
---
Still selling them for that amount. I'm not all the concerned with caps. Especially since gold bullion and script are more valuable.
---
you are a big help.
---
The Forest and No Man's Sky are both really good.
---
Also Subnautica is really good although singleplayer...
---
lol no they won’t - you seem to have very little knowledge of how the internet works
---
800 caps in my book.

Every time I see a car I blow it up

Any recommendations for finding raider power armor?
---
move your camp
---
Lmao you’re book needs to be rewritten then
---
Literally nothing until bethesda finally disables erectus and delete all hacked weapons. Whatever they do to make pvp a thing again (which is the opposite from what they are doing, I think they don't want us to pvp outside nw) it will be useless and a waste of time, since hackers and hacked items are a thing.
---
Lol. I do it too since FO4.
---
Very easy challenge, either hide on a bush/water or mess around and give yourself challenges. I like to find ridiculous hiding spots and build little shelters.
---
I share full traveling pharmacy, might share lead belly when i get the backpack mod.
---
Whoa whoa leave my girl brenda outta this. 😐
---
I wear fasnacht masks with mine, but other than that maybe the marine one?
---
i have one in my vendor guess my mystery platform
---
Then expect explosive bait in nuclear warhead formation!
---
This made my day!
---
Then, sorry, but you just don't have a clue how rare certain weapons/ effects are.
---
As mentioned, for items that are near worthless and just going to get scrip'd your prices are fine.
---
so, game tell you change server but you stay in laggy server for 30min and start complaining...
---
So extremely unlikely. DoS is more likely. Still could literally be coincidence too
---
Ever consider that some folks don't skilled charisma at all since it's not worthy for them? I cant share a perk with any of my chars since I always have 1cha.
---
I saw a three star Gatling laser disappear in front of my eyes as I went to press a
---
Same. I've got a vffr and jffr. Perfect for my build. I just never use them
---
This really does highlight that the problem is worse than I originally thought. I thought about the tournament idea myself, maybe incorporate it in as a raider run function or something. Maybe tie cosmetic and camp items exclusive to it by earning points. Idk
---
Just a stellar all round video game that requires and rewards my time sink. Shoot, loot, craft, build, explore, grind, troll. It's what I want. Keep adding to it please.
---
" I completed this daily today before even realizing it. "
---
Me too. I saw the legs of a ghoul through my scope at the WS residential area and blew a leg off - the notification and SCORE popped up and surprised me. I think I shot the wall of a house trying to blast the blue bar before I realized the movement wasn't in-game...
---
It is coming today
---
I love this.
---
BoS is a great storyline. 
---
Soldiers and normal people trying to find back a sense to their life. Maxxon offers them with the BoS organization and mission. The misunderstanding between soldiers on a mission and civils begins Maxxon is furious on how the BoS progressively mistrusts more and more civilians. BoS in Appalachia is finally wiped out because all factions did not trust each other enough to join forces. 
---
I am happy they took the time to show how factions are not simply one side dimension good or bad guys. They are people, often broken people, trying to get through impossible odds and times.
---
Same but in my eyes only few hundred caps.
---
No, 1 "level" below max can still fetch a semi-decent price for good items, but level 25/30 items and below are near worthless until you get down to level 5 armour with WWR, then you can stat charging ridiculous prices again.
---
That's the plan
---
wrong bud
---
Junk shield makes you invincible in pvp
---
Joining a party on Xbox will allow the host to get your IP address. A quick Google search can tell you the approximate location of the IP, and as for the internet shutdown I assume it's some form of DDoS attack, but I'm not entirely sure.
---
Man I can't believe they haven't fixed encryptid, the sheepsquatchs health just rubber bands right back up, its hard enough to hit him while hes invisible without having all your damage disappear due to a stupid glitch! why is this event so hard, there should be details on the loading screen or something so I know wtf to do.
---
Then sorry, you're a bit of a muppet
---
The gold bullion itself is not lore friendly for Fallout because it doesn't exist in any other game as a form of currency or a currency backed by it. It's just something that Beth threw in as an endgame feature for Wastelanders in a game that's already so unfriendly to lore that it might as well be a simulation within the Fallout universe.
---
So, I say, who gives a fuck if anything in 76 is lore friendly between it and other Fallout games or even within itself. Beth's focus should be solely on making this still broken ass game less broken and mechanically convenient as possible if they want players to continue playing it.
---
After playing since the beginning I am finally making my first gatling plasma build just to feel OP once lol.
---
Are you on xbox i would like to visit you camp sometime 🤘
---
i have absolutly no problem with :). BUT you really should consider that people jump into player's c.a.m.p ALL the day. they will take all your good stuff, paying very low price, for re-selling directly x10-100. it's not fair for you :(
---
Damn Ive been trying to figure out if i could give her the holotape
---
Honestly you have a point. It is a problem they should address before pvp. 
---
Hypothetical: Let's pretend they fix the hacking problem tomorrow, no more hacking in the game. All other issues are addressed and solved. How would you want to fix pvp? 
---
IIRC one of the original things Bethesda wanted to push was pvp (and we've all seen how that went).
---
I see what you did there...
---
I would love to see some paints for my moustache as well as grocer mod application so I can store more food in it
---
So just two steps away from nuclear winter?
---
Agreed.  Camp building is a big part of my end game which includes grinding new camp items (e.g. fireplace door).
---
Okay, I'd want to have different recipes where you can add in an extra ingredient for flavored gum.  
---
Mutant Hound Meat Gum!  Mmmm!
---
Just did 3 SBQ's none counted in participating with it.
---
lol BUTTHESDA  AMIRITE?
---
That sucks
---
So I know the tier list for effects on what gear. I don't  sell garbage. I normally sell premium gear at dirt cheap. My friends have to trade large sums of ammo to get want they want.
---
yes and no.
---
Yes they must be lvl 45-50 (depends on the wp) BUT if the price is really high, and you got it for lvl 20-40, it can be valuable too (because some have another character, and want to use it for lvl easier/faster) but yes in most of cases, it must be lvl max.
---
Sometimes they turn into meat piles that blend into other meat piles so impossible to find
---
every kiss begins with cars. bring a noob with next time and tell em to clear the random scorched on scene. stand back light them Kay's off and let em feel like what it was when the bombs first fell.
---
Agreed, I do this solo often, this and turning on the excavation thing on MT Blair(event of "wave protectiondefense" sucks tho since they get stuck on the ground) get you a lot of good junk/ores.
---
People use that site which by my account is way overpriced. I couldn't sell jack when I used their price range. So I sell for way cheaper now because the stash space is more valuable than caps. Or I just scrip it.
---
That is unfortunate.
---
To the people who did the come here emote so others could get this in uranium fever you are a god
---
Just did 3 SBQ's
---
None counted.
---
You sure it's not a plan you're missing for the last one?
---
#DICKS OUT FOR HARAMBE
---
Oh my god, that is amazing.  I wish I knew that when I was working on my raider rep.
---
Not when ppl have multiple account full with caps. I have just the one but I don’t need anything else so far so caps don’t bother me.
---
same.
---
And ammo ! the weight is killing me (and i've fo1st...)
---
and it's worst when you know that a simple minigun one star stalker is ACTUALLY way better X) ahahah
---
Nah it seems fair.
---
Does that mean I’d I have one piece that’s not combat armor or so it won’t work ?
---
T-'69'
---
Nice
---
Quite opposite I'd say, it's better than before.
---
Monetization.
---
Yeah it’s really toxic and it just gives people something to do because a lot of these people that do pvp are high leveled people like I myself am a lvl 300 and I do pvp because it’s one of the things I can do to keep myself occupied.Everybody complains about how it’s not a pvp game and all that but it’s an aspect of the game although it’s not a strong one Bethesda should do something for those certain people who do pvp.I think the game just needs more to do as a whole like the legendary run is a good step in the right direction but there needs to be a place for pvpers and it needs to be less toxic.Like I’ve seen people get ddossed and get real life threats over pvp.I myself got ddossed because a grown man I beat in pvp couldn’t handle getting beat by a kid.At times I can see myself being toxic too but idk. I certainly think discussions like these are what Bethesda should be looking at though.
---
Exactly. The dwellers in Vault 79 don't ever want to GIVE you gold, much less produce a machine which would do so. It run counter to their entire involvement with the folks from Vault 76.
---
&gt; The gold bullion itself is not lore friendly for Fallout because it doesn't exist in any other game as a form of currency or a currency backed by it. 
---
None of the other games take place in the immediate vicinity of the one vault where this was taking place.
---
I get instant disconnected from any game mode. My friend can get on, though. We keep choosing bf1 over fallout because mine won't work either. I've tried almost all of these tips.
---
Right on, sorry didn't see this till now I will be on most of tomorrow
---
It's bad that only fun in the game is to get a weapon that is good for your playstyle.
---
I... I have no idea how to feel about this, but now I want to see this happen out of sheer curiosity of what it would look like.
---
Ammo converter or drop them all in front of Wayward for new players.
---
If you wish to make money from vendors, chems and cooked food are an easy way to do so until you get the chemist perk and craft / sell diluted radaway and radx
---
Yes, as far as I know you have to have full sets of matching armors, so full SS, full Combat Armor etc.
---
the thrusters. the thrusters.
---
As long as you get enough damage through, to tag the SBQ to get the loot, I wouldn't worry about the damage.
---
9dmg per shot is not much, but it's honest work.
---
Does empath only work once you're in a team?
---
I sell mine for 200-500 caps, and still nobody buys them.
---
Well if we could actually trade we wouldnt have this problem
---
why do you even play this game it takes literally 18 months to earn all the bullion items which you can't even dupe and sell plus then you can't possibly finish the season event even if you play 28 hours a day its just another way to get ASSTHESDA to FORCE YOU to pay for content that should have been free anyway plus fast travel bug makes this literally unplayable check out my seventeen youtube videos where i vaporise noobs in the PVP that doesnt exist
---
Meh caps are no concern to me. I just want to off load and give a fair price for all the good legendary gear I come across.
---
Why
---
The landscape and surroundings
---
Yes I am but currently working 12 hour night shifts and haven't seriously played in a few days so my stock is low on legendary gear.
---
Agreed so much fun to solo.
---
Usually get 3 - 3 star legendaries,one per round, but it is really a difficult one to do as a group. Those
---
 Ghouls do some major damage and has to keep refilling the mask so they can't wait and call people to the legendaries or kite him for the group.
---
And good luck trying to follow the person with the mask still don't understand why non mask holders don't get a radar mark of the mask holder?
---
Yes
---
Heart rate steady, eyes focused. Good, Candidate
---
It's not about how many legendaries you encounter per day, it's about the rarity of some rolls. People selling good rolls are most likely doing so because they are not for their build, and if you want it for you own build then buying it from them at a reasonable high price from a player would be the only correct thing. It's the exact same thing with the Purveyor.
---
I don't think much folks want to pvp at all, seeing how small the nw lobbys are and alot of names are known over time. Also the rant about score challenges in NW in all social platforms are a huge sign.
---
Let's say alot of ppl want to pvp and they address the previous concern, I think some kind of faster respawn and little to no death punishment is the key to success. I think the permadeath mechanic in NW is too harsh, I would love to see some team deathmatch mechanics in a limited area. Maybe capture the flag, domination or  something else with pve goals where folks can do objectives without having to fight other players, this would let way more people enjoy and play these modes and get used to pvp without getting drown instantly.
---
The main change must be respawn to remove the fear of getting killed. Something like cod or battlefield is handling it I guess...
---
I literally have 40k caps and it takes me no time to find more legendary gear.
---
Feel ya there bro as a night worker i do that sucker myself. Cool lemme know ya gt will swing by some time when ya stocked up👍
---
That's fine if that what you want to do. But if you want to make more so you can buy and trade for better gear you will be left behind. But its all in how you want to play the game. I suggest you stay away from the market sub
---
You may want to reread. OP would at least like to somewhat narrow the RNG. You know something just about every other MP loot shooter (or at least taking elements from that) does.
---
I don’t understand why people are so adamant to speak on something they clearly don’t know about because you are genuinely clueless.
---
No, you don’t “turn your router off for a while and call your ISP to get a new IP”, because unless you’re actively paying for a static IP (which 99% of domestic users aren’t) you literally just turn off your router and you’ll get a new IP.
---
ISP cannot track where the packets came from, unless we are the attackers internet provider, even if you tell us their IP we cannot track it. That’s on top of the fact most people who boot are using VPNs. The only way you’ll ever track a booter is if they have a static IP without a VPN because their details will be listed on RIPE.net. Also, even if you give as much as the attackers actual IP address the only thing that will tell us is who their internet provider is and the fact is that by the time you get DDoS’d and go to report it, the RADIUS server will have already assigned that IP to somebody else. Your ISP isn’t backlogging packets to your IP to find some anonymous booter who kicked you off because you wouldn’t give him some items on a video game. You clearly think this shits like in the movies😂
---
Also, if someone’s booting on Xbox chances are they’ve bought their booter or they’re using an IP stress tester and didn’t develop it themselves. So the packets aren’t even being sent from their IP, they’ve input your IP into a stress tester which normally uses multiple systems elsewhere to flood too much information to your IP. So you even if they’re not using an VPN, unless they developed and coded the booter themselves and is for some reason using their personal system to DoS you tracking them means nothing because their actual information is encrypted and you’re being hit from somewhere in the middle of bumfuck Malaysia or something. Call your ISP and ask them to track and arrest someone for kicking you off the Xbox and let me know how long it takes them to stop laughing and hang up.
---
LPT: Buy other games and just play what you wanna play, when you wanna play it.
---
Ghoul orgies, shiny pricks and VATS glitch shitters, Count me in!
---
The range on the bow is incredible in vats, if you’re actually able to hit the target. Probably best range in the game currently
---
Yeah, not being able to scrap or move it kinda sucks, but you can still place like 10 of them in the nearest workshop, hook them up, and you're good to go.
---
You've watched Angry Turtle's recent XP tutorial? You can get well over 1000XP for each high-level supermutant and up tp 6000XP for completing events. That's how you do it.
---
I’d buy the shit out of a sheepsquatch plushie like the one in game
---
It's a survivalist bloody build. Untill you have the skills and gear, you will be seen. Ghouls are a pain and so is the queen and you'll likely die till you have sentinels.
---
Also. Don't forget that your damage is 0 If you're dead
---
Same but I made it my goal to sell for low. I'm a heavy gunner build so once I have a good stash of weapons I sell. For armor I sell at a different intervals.
---
It is  my understanding that the extra damage you take applies whether you are in a team or not, but the damage reduction only applies in a team.  That's what the in-game description of the mutation says, and although you absolutely cannot trust these descriptions, this one seems to be accurate with the provision that apparently you count as your own team-mate as long as you are in a team, even if you're the only one there.
---
The Lady Janet one had me scratching my head a bit. Theres nothing too much in the way of enemies in that area and theres better spots for flux plants. I kinda wonder if maybe someone pissed someone off and their camp was in that area. Although its not really a popular area for camps either so who knows
---
Same here
---
More power to you if you can buy and sell godrolls for 800 caps. I would love your luck, and to stop by and check out your vending machines.
---
I do remember my first SBQ I was lvl 50 and I used a shotgun build. The only reason I got tag with that setup is the reason minimum damage is 1 so all shogun pellets did 1 damage :D
---
These are some rookie numbers.
---
100% of the time.
---
It’s not fair and not on you. There’s 1000’s of drops that nobody uses. Nocturnal and every effect in every combination. However a huge amount of people use bloodied. So a nocturnal ffr less vats fixer nobody wants. A bloodied exactly the same rolls everyone wants. For you to acquire the gear YOU want you need to know what’s worth 800 caps and what’s worth 100k. If you want to sell it all for 800 that’s up to you but your highly unlikely to ever get decent weapons or armour unless it drops and the values represent how rare it is to get the drops u want.
---
I like collecting instruments, they aren't exactly rare per say but they are pretty on their own. Souvenir items are also super fun to collect.
---
That is depends on what they are. You can't just sell any of them.
---
PS4.
---
Thanks though. I figure Ill get them eventually. I bought a shielded casual outfit from a player vendor so its really only for the sake of having the plan Im even bothering
---
Treasure maps 
---
edit: the treasures on the maps, that is try and solve from the drawing and don't cheat. Not really disposable, but a real good and FUN time sink IMHO.
---
You’re confusing your own disinterest in caps, for what everyone else “should do”. Most other players do care about caps, and so they conform to the general structure of the marketplace.
---
Don't forget! Some weapons like the bow get you caught in a zoomed view, so occasionally you can't unzoom, or run away until you fire the shot. Don't even get me started on trying to change from 1st to 3rd person...
---
from what i have seen it works with sneak attacks. weapon type seems to not matter
---
I’m hearing more and more people having this situation in fallout 76 on Xbox and it’s getting concerning
---
Buy your own admission you've not been playing long, you wait until you need caps for Serums, or PA mods, or you start looking for your first "high power" weapon, then you see and regret how cheaply you been letting things go when you can't get what you are looking for, for the a price that you think is fair.
---
Yeah what do you think I do just sell any random legendary I find. All the legendary gear farm. Only 5 or fewer are what people are looking for. Some are close to what people want. The rest I script or sell to vendors.
---
Agree this is a fun, but not time consuming collection idea, if you have the full costime, else start with the costume.
---
Translation, play 76 and loot everything.
---
Your router will not actually start smoking from a fucking DoS attack, cut the Hollywood fear mongering shit it’s virtually impossible to brick or fry a modern router unless the person was able to gain access to remote management or connecting to the home network logging in as admin an uploading a corrupted new update file making the router bricked through a software compatibility issue. It will never “actually start smoking” because connections shut down when they receive too much information, hence how DDoS attacks work, the connection would be severed before there’s even a remote affect on any hardware and the FBI most definitely won’t swat them for frying a router even if it was possible😂 you really think you’re important enough for the FBI😂
---
I'm still looking for a really good minigun
---
You need to get the ones that come before before you can get the protective and shielded ones to drop from events. I think most of the preceeding ones can be obtained from various vendors in game. Once you get them then the other 2 start to drop. But the drop rate is appalling. I did however get the "lottery drop" of the jumpsuits and scout masks from one of the Savage Divide events ( i think uranium fever ) so thats good but it should also tell you something about the drop rate for the lining plans
---
As I've mentioned in my other reply to you, wait until you want say PA plan at 6k a piece.
---
Yea I think I have one of each ideal type and I cannot bring myself to destroy any
---
I'll let you know
---
So amazingly true. The BoS honestly should come crawling back begging for our forgiveness. Thanking us for finishing what they never had the balls to do...We are the Lizard Kings...fear us...
---
same. More often than not I'm looking for something to sink caps on rather than make caps on.
---
Tried to live with this build. My build is bolt-action one, AA + explosive, and I use 3x rifleman + 1 set of gunslinger. It's nice, but not nice enough. One has to invest a lot into agility to get benefits, and still it feels like it's not good enough.
---
But, but... we can work for them once they arrive, after spending millions of resources we are the chosen one to take care of their fetchquests rewarding us a few missiles each time!
---
Cool thank you
---
People over inflate the fuck out of prices because there is no regulation in the 76 trade economy. It used to be ok but then you know, person A gets rare item/legendary and person B really wants it so they charge them out the ass for it and from there it just snowballs into the over inflated shit fest it is now.
---
have you tried deleting her and replace with another ally , then delete that one and enable her again?  or play with another ally for a while and then switch back?
---
It should be getting fixed today
---
I literally have 40k caps and I know to stay way from that sub.
---
How would Super duper factor in though? You only get one chance at it being double instead of each time you press a?
---
My legendaries just fall into the void of 76
---
The kids in these comments have literally no clue about how DoS’ing works I don’t know why they’re trying to give advice
---
I would rather buy something for 800 that's worth 8000, but I would also think that something fishy was afoot if I came across a vendor full of high tier items for scrub prices.
---
I'll keep you updated if you would like to DM me what you are specifically looking for I'll keep an eye out.
---
if they were able to personally jack your net and turn it off, your IP nees to look into getting some security or you made the information easy for them to get. either way what they did could be considered personal attacks and can result in a warrant for arrest if the IP decides to chase up your report since they effectively stole their customers personal details and attacked them with them.
---
defo call your IP, explain someone did this after demanding things in a video game right up to the point they personally stated "i will shut down your net" and they SHOULD be able to trace where the packet came from and throw some justice in their direction... assuming they aren't using a VPN, in which case i'd consider what they did a "light" threat compared to the likely shady shit they are doing at their computer if they are A: highly entitled and attacking users personally and B: need a VPN setup for said attacks, odds are they are likely doing shit on the dark net as well
---
Yoooo, when did responders start calling ppl muppets lol. You my friend are now part of the enclave
---
I like the music the most, the creatures are also pretty interesting (not to confuse with the AI, that one's fucked). Also, having tons of apparel is a blessing... and that's about it.
---
Scorched Beast Queen.
---
Right, because the sheer scale of gold that Vault 79 has would in no way affect the future if say, this was the first game and the other Fallouts were sequels to it. When making a prequel, you have to take care into what you put into the story and how it will affect/coincide with the future that world belongs to. No thought or care was put into this game's story. So, again, focus on the game part and make that better and I think we'll have a much more welcoming 76.
---
Amen. I think Bethesda screwed up monetization of this game. They should pay modders to maintain this screwy game as if they were contractor's, then at the end of each month, the net sum, whether it was cosmetics they added, UI improvements, or new missions, players could "vote" at the countless voting stations on whose content they thought was best / most useful with $1 per vote. Send 90% back to the modders proportionately off those votes, Bethesda pockets the 10%, and allow increased benefits for people who buy 10 votes or more per month (free fast travel anywhere on a map for a month, unlimited storage space for a month, etc). Shouldn't cost Beth a dime beyond those server costs too...
---
Sooo much true :) Besides I have some theory about those millions of materials needed - Bethesda servers can't handle unlimited F1st's stashes anymore so they've decide to get rid of most of them with this event. Guess what - apart from steel I swim with, you won't get much from me...
---
40k caps is not all that much haha. I've got well over 100k atm. And have been up and down from 150k more times than I can count. But like I said it's all about how you play the game. But wanting others to sell for less is not going to happen. You are in the minority with your pricing.
---
Your post was asking why players sell for what they do. Your question has been answered. You just don't seem to like the answer haha
---
No, this doesn't count as it's actually a bot - certainly didn't for me.
---
I really like the idea! Would be a great addition!
---
For anyone else wondering anyways, the free trial did count toward the playtime, but just sending a ticket to steam support seemed to bypass that and they would approve the refund.
---
I have to say this all sounds like a lot of work. I've been playing like I played FO3, NW, FO4 and just completing tasks and going of the path. every time I see something interesting and I just reached level 15 as a very casual player. I'm kind of dreading this having to complete daily challenges in order to level up in the future...
---
I have to say I did enjoy it yesterday when four high-level guys suddenly appeared, protecting some kind of messenger robot and I just joined in to help them. I could help from a distance with my trusty revolver that usually one shots scorched.
---
Plus you can decorate your settlement with items, or you can use a mod to do that for you if you think its too hard
---
I hate doing this event in public cause every single fucking time it gets exploited. fix this shit already bethesda.
---
Sweet
---
That starts on Friday.
---
if magic is not patched today (and i'm 95% sure it will not)
---
you can buy any minigun with instigating, junkie or stalker, +33vats, bashing damage or limb damage for less than 800caps. it will be overpowered and underpriced.
---
i remember someone adding conduits to make dicks but i forgot how to do it
---
Seen a sheepsquatch disappear in Free Range in front of my eyes just as I was about to loot it. Serves us right I guess for mopping up the last of the enemies :/ Uranium Fever is bad for it too. All the other enemies stay as a goop pile but the legendaries vanish into the ether. Its bullshit. Lost so much loot to it. Ive even had them spawn out mid looting
---
I do that every time this challenge is on with the first camp i find on the map selling ammo.
---
Look I know what is desired and priced. I choose to sell it at bottom caps.
---
Actually there kind of is one. I found out recently that if you move the C.A.M.P. machine object that it will move your spawn point. You wont spawn on the camp thing of course, but if you move it east your spawn will be more east and vice versa
---
I never worry about that cause they follow me home😂 and to the store..
---
What level are u?
---
To be fair this was taggerdys version of the bos not maxscon she mistook what he wanted the bos for
---
So, those prices ARE for scrip items then, which means this entire post of yours is a troll post.
---
Well played ....
---
You think we will get the option for 8 loadouts? Lol. 
---
They should've swapped around Legendary Perks and the Load outs. One Wasteland could change a lot of things.
---
A sale is a sale though i dont see why it's much of a problem, you got the caps.
---
About 6 hours from now and no, not yet
---
What you should do isn't always the right thing to do, but I understand what you mean.
---
Never join a random party. Its really simple to for em that way. (At least from what i heard.)
---
okay
---
Ah alright, thanks for the information my guy!
---
Still wanting a radio that just has it on loop.
---
What makes it overpowered? Doesn't instigating only effect the first bullet that hits?
---
“Tracking them down is easy as pie” 
---
First of all, wrong.
---
Second of all, wrong.
---
Third of all, wrong.
---
As someone who works in telecommunications for an ISP (PureTelecom) I’ve lost count of how many DDoS calls from kids on Xbox I’ve taken. It’s not easy to track them, as a matter of fact, if the attacker doesn’t have the same ISP as the one you called, it’s impossible. There’s nothing they can do all it will show us is who their provider is.

Most VPN services will roll on their ass? Nowadays most VPNs don’t even keep records of their users personal information so they couldn’t even if they wanted to. On top of the fact that absolutely no VPN’s TOS even mention DDoS’ing because they are two completely unrelated things. That’s like saying “Apples ToS says you can’t use a mac to DDoS someone”, except it’s even more vague because VPNs are a whole industry and not a single brand. 
---
Unless your DoS attack is Large Scale and generally against businesses or government bodies, people don’t get arrested for singular domestic DDoS’es, they’re not even looked into most of the time simply because the cost just isn’t worth it. Hence why every, and I mean every DDoS arrest you’ll ever read about will never be from DDoS’ing a single player on Xbox.
---
My main account is focused on Steins, Magazines, Bobbleheads.
---
My alt is focused on plushies (bears, cats, and camp craft), and nuka cola.
---
Sweden huh? :-)
---
The daily reset for S.C.O.R.E is 18.00, so it stands to reason thats when the update would start, however, I think actual updates are usually pushed out a bit earlier so probably around 16-17.
---
Not sure about the Perks, but they will throw in the BOS Atlas public resource gathering event starting today.
---
Tried that, my Spawns still kept putting me in the same place on mountain camps. In Whitesprings, it kept putting me further from my camp, but always behind it.
---
“Oh sorry, that's that *other* radio station.”
---
I just put in whatever time it is into Google and it converts to my local time (obviously you need to allow Google to use your location). E.g. I write in "10 am et" and it will show it in my local time.
---
Yeah same i pretty much have all plans i think cause i never find any i don't own being sold by players.
---
*Don't point blame at just ol Raggity-Tags!!!!*
---
(kidding I was just in a funny mood on the bus and decided to lighten the Reddit mood!)
---
you just reminded me i rolled a bloodied limb damage weightless crossbow and a bloodied explosive reload speed LMG, completely forgot they were in my stash till i saw this and checked :P
---
just made my day now i have something to fall back on for caps when i inevitably get down to near 0 again due to buying the last serum plan
---
My alt always shares Sun Kissed, lolz im a max health build with him.
---
It truly is my home in Appalachia. Nuking it prr wastelanders was my favorite past time. I was hoping it would have some more life post wastelanders but sort of glad it didn't. But I run it at least once a day and have a distinct path through. I always run it after the common hotspots so I can milk those before quietly submerging myself.
---
I don't use serums and most pa mods I have except 65, ultracite, and x-01.
---
Honestly I like them but I feel like some of them are misrepresented like the grafton monster, mothman, and flatwoods monster because cryptids are supposed to be scary and frankly not seeing the mothman or flatwoods monster dosen't help the flatwoods monster lacking that bone chilling design makes it less scary and having a grafton monster able to be folded by super mutants is just a joke we don't even hear a locomotive like whistle described in the cryptid hunters terminal
---
You can't place your items on furniture, only display shelves and cases sadly. You can decorate them with small camp items though.
---
Ah, alright. Then don’t do it, I guess
---
I only use excavator armor and I have most pa plans.
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
Sentrybots just keep disappearing for me a few seconds after their explosion. 
---
Fortunately no legendaries were expected, but still, I like to loot.
---
Technically later today, not tomorrow, as it’s currently 4 in the morning where I am lol
---
They don't even want to make money, or just not the maximum what they could squeeze out.
---
1st for 15€ in EU? This is the most expensive subscription I ever saw, played wow, eso, ffxiv and many more. What did you get? Bad support, bad performance, little advantages and hackers or hacked items at every second queen.
---
What are they doing? Nothing, correct. Not even communicate. 
---
All they sell is low effort, each week we see buggy, broken and unfinished crap in the atomstore, they sold a 30€ bundle with really low res pa skins and so on.
---
They don't want to earn money, they just test out how much idiots pay for overpriced trash, that's the whole philosophy of the entire game. Fallout 76 is just a social experiment on how much they can duck with us players, how much of their shat we're up to swallow just to adapt this knowledge into their next prestige projects. Remember, betesda invented microtransactions with a 2,5$ horse blanket. Now we get 12$ recolors for pa ( changing a colorcode takes about 2mins in total).
---
I'd be interested to see that (not sarcastic) - we've all seen the videos like this one: [https://youtu.be/RunhgkMt1Q0?t=82](https://youtu.be/RunhgkMt1Q0?t=82) and this one: [https://youtu.be/BKj3B\_0juik?t=107](https://youtu.be/BKj3B_0juik?t=107) (both admittedly ideal runs to make a point :P ) and watching back the head shot hit chance stacks to 95% in 2-3 shots when in distant but still vats range, then you have 17-18 left in the clip so if you assumed that with a 33, those first 2 shots would have hit (?), how much of a difference does those two hits per vats 'run' make over a queen fight, compared to the increased fire rate?
---
I guess it would take many timed solo runs to get a definitive answer as the biggest variable is her 'behavior'.
---
I dont think the Colossus has a gun, so no
---
A Violent Night allowed me to complete this challenge fortunately.
---
it's the "magic" effect.
---
actually legendaries with high fire rate (more than 150) and one of these perks make it overpowered (for No reason)
---
me : two similar weapons and no build (shi.tty build only for tp)
---
normally legendaries effects have no incidence on dps in this configuration (junkie but not addict etc..) so the mob normally dies at the same amount of time. check the difference.
---

---
edit:bad english
---
Vats it feels much better than in previous games although annoying for flying enemies or using it with snipers it is how it was demonstrated in the perception trailer it helps you aim and hit shots
---
I already saw a nuke there while logging off. A few hours too early, friend
---
Well now I do
---
If you want to miss out on good deals.
---
She's the worst radio host out of every game.
---
Me, love doing it in the mire or ash heap, easy to train a group of enemies then blow em up
---
I sell these plans for 25 cap
---
NW on PCs is cheater's paradise, hence people playing Adventure and enjoying it.
---
I mean, you can't expect going into PvP without right build and weapons and winning. That just won't happen.
---
I dont listen to her. Between her ego and her whining I'm over it.
---
Most legendaries I sell are pretty worthless. I’ll put them up for whatever they’re worth in the Pip-Boy if I’ve hit my scrip limit, and then scrip whatever I still have the next day. 
---
But then there’s super rare things, that I’m definitely selling for a lot. A B/E/WR tesla? I know someone will pay well over 10k caps for that.
---
I play F76 and No Man's Sky. It's completely different kind of base building, so don't know if it's your thing. But the bases I've seen in nms are amazing. From huge crashed Death Stars to tropical resorts and orbital platforms. My son and I made a small western town: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/e9zmni/you\_cant\_take\_the\_sky\_from\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/e9zmni/you_cant_take_the_sky_from_me/)

---
But you only have a set amount of special points.
---
I just sell plans I have not sorry
---
Exactly. Let's award more special points each time you level up.
---
Lol how many they are? I got a 3 star today, i was about to scrap it 😅
---
sorry for dumb question, but I feel like I'm  missing something. why would people drop nukes there?
---
No it's not that I don't like the answer. It's just sounds like "if I can I will". It's fair enough in my eyes.
---
The group I play with all use explosive weapons or grenades, but we also play on a private server. It's awsome. On a public server a Tesla rifle is a good option.
---
We have legendary perks on the way, this is never going to happen.
---
No not troll just serious.
---
Do we know how that system will work?
---
Its make the game a little too easy, I like the change of having to decide which perks I want to use and having to sacrifice some. It's also really helpful if you want to make a build because perk management is pretty easy. If anything you can always switch the perks you want to use, like if you're making ammo, just equip ammo Smith real quick, and then take it off
---
I've seen corpses go poof while I was looting them.
---
Not really. In the last few days of the event, I listened to Technoviking during the march instead.
---
I notice you said "as much"... 
---
lol, I'm with you. If I see them first, fine, but if they surprise me, or if they see through my stealth, I'm SOL.
---
Recycling old content.
---
It's out there, on YouTube etc.
---
To me it's 800 that's for every really good legendary I find.
---
That's funny how they're eager to introduce that system to scrap perk cards that is also tied to legendary perk upgrades (which leads to numerous issues and is a good example of bad design) and think that managing cards this way is a more desireble feature than perk loadouts, which would really solve QoL issues with the perk system.
---
Sounds like a great opportunity to talk about today's sponsor NordVPN
---
Why so hostile? No one is forcing you to go into workshops, just your very own junk/atom/dailies/whatever-hoarding nature. Gotta get those tacky ghillie skins, right? 
---
And don't tell me to what and where to play.
---
Nope, the whole system is intended to prevent a single player having all perks making him literally invincible and op with every weapon like it was in fallout 4.
---
As a online roleplay game fallout76 should had been it would be the worst change they can possible do, every player had the same loadout, the same identical build. A heavy vatscrit stealth demolition rifleman gunslinger build...
---
same here...if you use a thumbs up or send a heart emote it just comes off as sarcastic or confrontational..
---
I think everyone did.
---
There should be a separate mode with faction pvp and a separate character just for this mode.  Maybe even no levels, instead have faction ranks.  No legendaries, maybe an overall health buff to prevent one shotting.  Maybe stuff like bloodied and sentinel/cavalier could be mutations.  All builds should be useful for something, also no silly damage cap.  Perhaps less carry weight as well and less room in stash to prevent mass gathering of aid items and hopefully lessen the duping.  Limited perks, kind of like NW.  Fix Teslas to need a target to work, they would still have their uses on idiots standing too close together.  There should also be quests like capture territory, build defenses and kill x of another faction and these would count for dailies.  Your faction would get bonuses according to how much territory and key locations were being held.
---
The FO76 defender has logged on.
---
The new quest a colossal problem should be live on the server and that’s where it supposed to be.
---
Last I checked 107 on my heavy.
---
White springs yes i did the same, handy to take out the ghouls at level 60+ near them, also snipering them from the roof tops to finish them off was fun, such a great game.
---
Does it give you screws?
---
It would be if structures could be accessible.
---
Could be mine or someone else who tested if his camp was inside the direct blast zone and how much resources it would cost to repair everything.
---
The resource extractors are good if you set your base up around one I did it with junk for a while it's pretty handy
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/  this beautiful bastard made a map that helped alot when I started
---
Amen
---
Without any glimpse on the outcome it is in fact gambling, someone inform Belgium
---
if you are losing focus when you alt tab, just don't alt tab during loading time (the UI doesnt like that). It should be fine otherwise.
---
Well, it’s certainly a camp of monkeys, but did they remember to place the essentials so the monkeys can kill/eat/do drugs across Appalachia?
---
Oh thanks! I thought colossus will be where it usually appears.
---
Nah more like https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
I made a floating ufo camp and it’s pretty cool to see from a distance. It has the blue icicle lights around the entrance. I absolutely love it
---
Check your perks.
---
Rumour has it the BoS needs 999999999999999 of them so they’ve been taking them from you using their new high tech vertibirds
---
No problem, I didn't believe it at first but there's a video by Angry Turtle about it and it looks like it's accurate.  Could be patched out at any time though, you know how it goes.
---
First of all you need to know the plans for what ever you want to craft eg secret service armour. You'll buy a plan for the left leg secret service armour, learn the plan then go to a armour workbench to craft it. It's the same as crafting a normal piece of armour except in the list of items it tells you you need to craft it, it also tells you, you need one legendary module as well. You craft the leg then check your inventory to find out what you rolled. It can be a 1, 2 or 3 star leg piece and can be any type eg unyeilding or bolstering and so on.
---
Patch 22 I think.
---
The new event “a colossal problem” is getting added there tomorrow, the event is started in a similar way to the scorchbeast queen fight. You have to nuke the area where it takes place to activate it, in this case the location is Monongah mine
---
For what?
---
Do you have Starched Genes equip'd?
---
No it's more like cars. 
---
Your way is like, a cars a car. They are all the same. 4 wheels and an engine. They should all be the same price
---
VS most other people's thinking. That is a 2020 lambo. A great car it's worth a lot. And that one is a 1989 beater. Worth very little.
---
That is why people price things the way they do. Not every gun is equal.
---
Edit, and most people want to be able to buy or trade for better gear. So they will be trying to sell at a decent price. That is how economies work
---
This makes sense, a lot of sense
---
yup, got it, thanks!
---
Ball sack trophy
---
I bet 10caps they either don't do anything or break it even more!
---
Yes. Its been on the PTS for a while.
---
This new sekiro content looks great.
---
Apparently it's fixed in the pts so it should work. Though I'm not holding my breath
---
If you want the mutations permanently you need to equip starched genes max lvl
---
As far as I know, sentrybots don’t even leave metal pile after-hand unlike other robots, so loot it before it disappears.
---
But also in places like Radiation Rumble the piles never seem to disappear, so the disappearance might have something to do with server load.
---
Some BoS are still here
---
I run west tek
---
Hi,
---
A lot of german people are searching on reddit for information. Often they don’t understand the content in english, only a few words. I love the information we can get on reddit. I only made a short translation from the videos. Hope it will help.
---
Australia for me. It will be like 2am or something when it drops.
---
So i guess see ya tomorrow.
---
Are the backpacks weightless?
---
How is it even going to be? I bet we have to go through a bunch of slow ass menus to change it, rather than just letting us hotkey it
---
Here in Germany you just reconnect the router and it gets a new IP automaticly
---
It's worse when you realize that the perk loadout has been out almost forever.
---
You will need to equip the perk card called 'Starched Genes'. This will be in the 'Luck' section. You will also have to upgrade it to level 2 for it to enable you to keep mutations. To remove mutations then you will need to unequip 'Starched Genes' then use Radaway. This should remove your mutations.
---
At your level, I quickly learned to only take over workshops for challenges. Junk is everywhere, and some events can generate large quantities of steel if you collect and scrap all the weapons. Even before private servers, I would generate so much scrap everyday, I would bulk and sell out the vendors with the excess. There really isn't a reason to claim a workshop.
---
With my Primed, Junkies, ADS, Ultracite Gatling laser and 9 Hvy Weapon Perks and Stabilised I'm doing about 11 per hit on the body?
---
Add in Hoppy Hunter, Pyscho and Headshots I can get it up 22(ish?) 
---
And in both cases that pretty good damage, due to the RoF
---
That price tool is junk. It is also based on market subs. Not on vending machines. My vendor prices are much lower than market prices
---
The Burrows at Harper's Ferry
---
RIP Junkies 50 FRR machine gun.
---
it gets even worse
---
Get the perk starched genes, it’s a luck based perk. At rank 2 you cannot lose your current mutations while the perk is equipped, however you cannot gain new mutations either while using rank 2 of the perk (serums still work though)
---
damn, im trying to get all of the heavy gunner cards
---
That's not flying, that's just falling with style ;p
---
25 caps and and  people buy the mounted head plans.
---
Xp boosting food, high intelligence for that sweet +2% Xp per Intelligence point and west tek. A lot of west tek runs
---
Nexusmods if you PC
---
While people give correct answers they forget to elaborate a little. There is a perk called starched genes that's in Luck, max rank will allow you to keep the mutation, no matter what you do it won't go away. If you wanna get rid of it just check if you have that perk on and use rad-away (not sure if diluted helps too tho) or shower. For the future when you want to keep your mutations besides Starched genes perk you might also want to get Class Freak perk that reduces the negative effect of mutations, otherwise you'd have to keep taking serums and that's no cheap unless you have a recipe which costs a fortune.
---
as far as the SS set, does that mean we now have no choice but to purchase the helmet plan now?
---
I price mine at whatever prices FED76 gave me for each of them. If they don't actually sell for anyting i'll use them for scrips.
---
Someone with some brains! Thank you for clearing the smell of bullshit. 🙂
---
Anywhere that has high level supermutsnts or ghouls. If you can kill them quickly and easily also got scorchbeast as they also give a nice chunk of exp.
---
I’m pretty sure they’re coming in patch 22 because early PTS feedback showed that a few needed to be reworked or redone altogether so they got delayed
---
Equip'd I, the starch'd genes;
---
Although I strive, by any means,
---
Radscorp'n egg, or rad shower --
---
I've been standing here a fucking hour --
---
I've tried it all, I cannot rid
---
myself of this curs'd Egg Head!
---
Keep sending screenshots to Beth (?) Nothing else you can since they can't fix. They don't have the knowledge.
---
Kill stuff? I'm level 357 now and can still level decently fast if I want to. And I don't use nay xp buffs, just can't be bothered managing it haha
---
helmets never been counted towards full sets - there is no helmet for most of the armor sets - no wood (legally at least), no leather, no robots, no trapper.
---
Now give them typewriters
---
It looks like she has the very deadly T-pose-whyisthisbugstillnotfixed disease. Im sorry to say, it's terminal
---
also, validating game files is taking suspiciously long
---
game is easy enough as it is
---
I seem to be getting a lot of corpses but can't find the pickup point. Body is there but no inventory. Sometimes it appears next to the body but mostly not. Ghouls are the worst
---
You can't get rid of Mutations if you have starched genes equip'd. You need to remove it first, then take your Radaways etc - It will mean any other mutations you have will also be a risk.
---
I could see a lot of potential with this.
---
wait, were you just watching me play?
---
Final render? Looks more like a first render am I right guys ?
---
Oh no! Wait, with my hacker perks I'm great with terminals!
---
Yeah I get that but this is different. This is a game that if you grind enough you can get duplicates of the same gun and perks. I have got a lot of them over the past 6 months. So my prices will stay the same.
---
With stuff like this happening something must be done for sure
---
I'd be happy if they added a BOS questline which gave us two new Legendary modules one for existing Armor plans and one for existing weapon plans. and then the BOS Quartermaster sold special plans that guaranteed 3-star legendary drops when crafting. using the existing currencies, Scrip for modules and bullion for Plans, and cork modules which can only be bought from them as this is the only reason I see for them wanting so much cork.
---
Wait what about a dam?
---
Go on YouTube and watch angryyturtle exp build. He's done all the homework for you.
---
You don't have to implement it all.
---
On double exp weekend with 4 lunchboxes open u can level up crazy fast. I was level 250 and going up 3-4 levels just for doing line in the sand.
---
Immediately after seeing this post. 😅
---
Yeah that's how it should be in adventure as well in my opinion, the way it is now doesn't make any sense to me, as instead of just giving snipers their typical weakness back, they are just made impossible to use.
---
That's fine. That's how you want to play the game. But that is why most others price the way they do
---
There were almost every time some things that was patched on the pts and failed again on live servers. Last time adrenaline was fixed, therefore vats with gun-fu worked properly. Both is still broken.
---
I normally sellout every long session.
---
that's a relief. the helmet plan (for the SS) is just too damn expensive for a useless piece of equipment.
---
thanks for the quick reply my friend.
---
Looks awesome, the idea is great, however knowing how Bethesda does stuff I'm pretty sure the info will not be reliable if they do implement this. I mean even pipboy tab with collection isn't correct at times.
---
Todd plushie fell out the window again...
---
Fair point. What are your thoughts on a more like halos for fight? But competitive?
---
Lvl 1014.
---
I hit 3x west tek, 3x whitespring and 3x Capitol, does about half a level. Takes about one hour.
---
the raiders blew up Charleston dam killing most of the responders
---
Dear everyone who tries to tell the rest what to do. We do what we want.
---
I agree, and since it's my cake day Bethesda has an obligation to implement this in todays update as per my personal request. 
---
Do it Todd, DO IT!
---
Im lvl 467 and my alt is lvl 78.  I know it can feel hard aswell so some tips

Inspirational  perk card
---
Community team "building" 
---
( basically anything that boosts intelligence)
---
Good places to farm:
---
Westek,  fort defiance,  the burrows, satilight area,  glassed caverns and Harper's Ferry.
---
Events:
---
Line in the sand, monster mash, its a trap and Radiation rumble.
---
Remember to get the best sleep also gives more xp but if you die you have to sleep again.
---
Not going to lie, I have never been mugged of my flux after the queen fight, that's probably people who are pissed that you didn't give them a chance to meet the damage threshhold, do you let it land before blasting it?
---
I don't know how but I leveled up twice during Line in the Sand yesterday and I'm level 178 believe. I also farm Whitespring, Westtek, and also the camps in the cranberry bog as they usually have lvl 52 gutsys. Events like radiation rumble, line in the sand and uranium fever are good for xp with high level wave spawns. As others have said, use xp boosts like food and high level intelligence but I find that with the legendary run at the moment having level up as a requirement everyday, I'm really putting effort in to make sure I do that so it is possible! And I'm not on all day or all night, just a couple of hours a day at the moment.
---
Its like rock paper scissors 
---
Vault dweller kills robot

So vault dweller, malfunctioning robot, and huge @$$ bat?
---
I'm up for literally anything tbh, as far everyone from hardcore pvp junky to first time ever players are able to enjoy and achieve something.
---
Oh that I forgot about that I went into the building with Rose's body for the initiate of mystery questline and quickly tbagged her and left
---
I beseech thee Egg Head, how much longer must I endure?
---
Quoth the Egg Head "forevermore"
---
to add onto this, you can vats hit the molotov while it's still in the air to get it to explode early. great for when the high levels are killing things too quickly for the regular explode on impact since molys tend to bounce around too much before exploding for me.
---
Yeah, you missed the smartphone part of the game where you NEED to log in everyday.
---
Also try find an Explosive weapon and put on your demolition expert card and relevant gun perk cards so that kills are much easier. I run with a bloodied ex fixer and have my commando perks on to the max. I can kill most things in one shot so means I'm not spamming enemies with multiple shots. I can kill more and get more xp with quicker kills. :) that's made a huge difference for levelling up for me.
---
If I see a legendary item that has good perks but I don't need them or I used them and had my fun I put the price no more than 2k on the best item in my stock. I see a lot of people selling same shit for like 5-6k.. If nobody buys mine for a while I just scrip them. Might not be the best way to manage it but I have that freedom of making a wrong choice hehe. I like it.
---
Well I think another big obstacle is going to be player killers. I have a feeling they’re gonna try to kill players on the way to transport scrap to the event too.
---
good job
---
You commented twice
---
Oh wow, it's Planet of the Apes! :D
---
that's a workaround but not effective in combat when you are reacquiring targets fast. programming it to cancel the draw when tapping reload would be best
---
I got like one legendary fat man but i dont wanna haul around the heavy ass mini nukes so i never use it
---
Thank you
---
As I said earlier, I don't play NW. If that's the case I really hope they get an anti-cheat soon for those who want to PvP.
---
And well I am not expecting to go into PvP and win all the time with a non-PvP build, but my build wich is optimized for high damage single hits should also not be completely useless in PvP in my opinion.
---
That's a really horrible conclusion..  I have had and have everyday mostly good experiences. Eu servers maybe are different
---
Game is down for Update.
---
Can we fight against their occupation? I figure they wont have much of an army coming and we are entrenched, armed and armoured with local knowledge and two settlement militias we can call on!

Troll
---
op is trying to get rid of the mut, not keep it
---
That mod is the only reason I still play the game. Without it, I would have stopped long ago. That made me think I need to give some IRL caps to the modder.
---
As others in this thread, I fear Beth' solution will be awful, and even worst, it will make the mod unusable. Well, we'll see in December.
---
Excuse me for stepping in but how can you have 40k caps? wasn't it 30k or did they change that? I'm merely curious.
---
Yep, lots of people are visiting
---
Corkerhood
---
Or if a group of them gangs up on you! I can take out a lone charred ghoul no problem. 2 of them is iffy, 3 and I’m dead lol. 
---
I had a laugh and was slightly embarrassed earlier tonight because I had claimed the Monongah workshop and of course, the first group of enemies is two waves of charred ghouls. I kept on dying and there was just no way I was going to beat this, which was disappointing because I needed fusion cores (for the gun that I usually use on charred ghouls, lol). Thankfully, the level 95 on my public team shows up and proceeds to two-shot basically all of the ghouls. Keep in mind I’m 50 levels higher than this guy, and having my ass handed to me. I sent him a message thanking him and explained that I’m a melee build so the ghouls wreck me. If I try to melee them, I die, and I don’t have the guns or the optimization to two-shot them like this dude could lol. I need to figure out a solution for this on my own, it would certainly help me gather high rad fluids.

Man, don't give them ideas.   But seriously, you're right.   Can you imagine?
---
Ahhh, thanks. That explains why I didn't experience it with my other guns.
---
You should try out Ark, theres a ton more decorations in F76 but I enjoy the actual base building in Ark a lot more. Plus you can tame, ride, and fight with dinosaurs on top of it being a survival game if you're into that.
---
I’ll keep the best pieces for trading here on Reddit but I barely ever sell for more than 1500
---
Again, rarity can determine a lot. Or just how good it is. A TSE flamer can be used by anyone of any build and still be super effective. That will, of course, go for a lot of caps. B2525 Fixers, although not as rare as they were before the last dupe exploit, still go for a lot. Just because **you** think *everything* is worth 800 caps max, doesn’t mean that’s how it works at all.
---
the implementation is horrendous.
---
i got back into fallout76 a few months ago only because of the bow. hate the left hand bow thing, hate how it almost always misses the vats first shot even when i am fully vats specced (guass rifle has a similar problem
---
the damage is fine but missing shots becuase of buggy missing charging vats shots, means zero damage and time spent nocking another arrow.
---
Well it’s your stuff u sell it for what you like. Be lovely if everyone did it but I’m afraid your in a minority of 1
---
You're right.  I was trying to be optimistic, but......   yeah.   What would you put it at?  Five?  
---
It's so annoying, especially when you motion people over for the first one.
---
Create a new char, play half a game
---
Result of all the duped weapons and people having no build or knowledge of how to do the event. All the gear. No idea
---
On pts I already encountered a problem with this mod, legendary perks are not accessible or show up. Had to disable the custom load list to test them. Idk if or when a update will get released addressing this issue from the mod author.
---
Weird. Only typed it once. Fixed....I think....
---
And why not use them?
---
Sorry dude, ID is something quite different than what you studied and much much broader field.
---
Your studies also don't cover aimed DOS attacks on exploitable device.
---
I'm not sure it's a bug as much as an intentional "feature".
---
You did
---
holy crap  
---
Secondly, I wish we could get some of these incredible pictures for our own fallout pics.   I'd like to see this and some of the really beautiful or interesting shots pop on my loading screens.
---
Even the "confidence" man?
---
Nice idea. I have 80 pounds of SS armor not-too-bad-rolls
---
no
---
I'd be inclined to agree, if you could actually directly buy scrip or legendaries I'd say they did it on purpose, but you can't, at least directly buy them from Bethesda, with real money.
---
Yet.
---
You can buy ranks of the season and get scrip from THAT but it's not really direct.
---
I can double check, but I believe they weight 1 pound.
---
They have certain teddy bears available in the Bethesda store right now. Could be a test product to see how well plushies sell.
---
I think I know why they vanish. 
---
I noticed that some big creatures, always a legendary tends to follow me around. 
---
I'll kill a legendary scorchbeast and fast travel to my base. A few seconds later it drops from the sky next to me. 
---
I've actually found a few missing bodies just running around. They always drop from the sky every so often.
---
* No you don't want to do that, not really. The coming legendary perk system needs those cards for you to buy ranks with.
---
* You can't.
---
Remove starched genes perk. Then shower. Radx. You’ll start to lose your mutations. Once you’ve got rid of it put starch genes back on and retake serums to replace to mutations u lost and want back. If I know this game and I have 8 mutations. The last one to go will be the one u want to lose lol. Good luck
---
Wow, I had no idea.   I appreciate the info.
---
Every single perk card works individually.  So each of the two you're talking about triples the alcohol.  So 3 and 3 str. Which is 6. 
---
If it dodnt work thaty way,  you'd get into weird combos of what procs first.
---
That just reminded me of the first time I participated in encriptid and the imposter sheepsquatsch just disappeared as I was approaching to loot after dying right at the end of the event
---
Armor paints are often specific to certain armor sets, so you'd have trouble finding matching sets all over again.
---
This sounds interesting I doubt it will get fixed soon ty for the info
---
It was the best of times, it was the BLURST of times???
---
Oh shit sorry my bad must have misread it since I’m tired af
---
(Nice RP. Everything beyond this point is RP and parody, and not an attack.)
---
Take a visit to Morgantown Airport and ask the Responders how the Brotherhood ignoring the Scorched threat would have gone. Just because it worked out the same, long term, doesn't mean their attempt wasn't valiant.
---
They only ""robbed"" them in the sense that they were desperately bleeding resources trying to save the entire state (or world) from what seemed to be an unending threat, and were bad at public relations, so by the time things were getting really desperate they had to demand the resources rather than ask. It was literally ""rob"" the others or let the Scorched roll over all of them. It's laid out that the Responders were less than helpful, having what they perceived as their own issues, and a lot of people didn't grasp the scale of the threat because the Brotherhood was able to hold the line for a long time.
---
Nobody but them gave a damn until it bit them in the ass. In fact, your stance is a perfect example of why everyone died. You are one of the many Responder corpses littering Appalachia I'm afraid, rotting in the gloom.
---
Nah. They'd be like 6 hours early by my count. I got it to work, but it refused to let me go private for 30 minutes or so. Be careful folks.
---
People always get this wrong. 
---
When it says triple it means +200%
---
So it should be +5/5 
---
Not sure why’s its +6 but be happy that it is.
---
There is a fps cap for windowed mode for some reason only Todd can tell, however you can disable it in the falloutprefs.ini document. Search (strg+f) for 'iPresentInterval' and change the 1 to 0. Save the document, boot the game and set it to borderless windowed, reboot and enjoy.
---
What do you mean by " using MSI afterburner to adjust GPU "? Try downclocking the GPU and VRAM by 100 MHz.
---
Such shutdowns could be indications of dying PSU, dying video card, or contact issues. For the latter, re-seat the video card and double check the PCIe extra connectors.
---
30 min time limit.... right?
---
Maybe they should have been wearing a mask.
---
This^ 
---
Takes my team about 40 seconds to 4 min to complete depending on how prepared we want to get.  On privates only though, no stealing the fun from others. Also have 3k hours under our belts lol
---
I think we can all agree upon
---
hi,
---
SBQ guarantee \*\*\*
---
Well it is triple with other alcohol, as an example whiskey goes from 2 str to 6 str.
---
Lol I’d have 250 special points plus and pretty much every perk. I’d never die and be able to give a super mutant a reach around without being detected. Would be pointless playing
---
They just don't seem as good as most other weapons for some reason I don't know
---
I'm sure modders will fugire out how to deal with it. They proven to be smarter than Beth at this point.
---
Atmosphere.
---
Whether I'm sitting in my ramshackle shack, listening to the grainy barely audible sounds of my radio as the rain falls outside or if I'm sneaking through a dense fog covered forest waiting to hear the familiar whoosh before seeing glowing red eyes staring at me from a distance. This game delivers. 
---
Taking in a nuke from the top of my camp.
---
Meandering through an abandoned building only to open a door and be face to face with a glowing wendigo.
---
This game delivers atmosphere for sure.
---
I just got 4 *** legendary robots in AWOL armaments... and I guess they don't count as creatures? They didn't count for the SCORE challenge
---
It is very easy if you get people to join your party, its harder if you join someone elses but not impossable just dont join random prties.
---
Ah okay. Thank you. Where can I find the notes for the legendary perk system
---
This was one I was going to give up on. Was waiting for Uranium Fever to spawn as been told that has 3star legendarys spawn during but then happened upon one through pure luck.
---
This one made me wonder like.
---
Remove the script limit make the max scrip you can carry 300 and you can pay 300 script for a legendary modification do you can choose bloodied but you can't choose what weapon
---
Does the raider punk and wanderer have questlines that give you unique items?
---
Reject humanity. Return to monkey.
---
Well the main reason your experience is different with those other enemys is likely the legendary effect, I just had a standard crafted bow, modded with different arrows, as I had no luck with drops or the purveyor. I can see instigating helping a lot, especially removing the need to headshot certain enemys in order to one hit.
---
My main point was that a non-legendary bow is way worse than a non-legendary anything else. The legendary bows aren't on par with the legendary other weapons either from the sound of it as they still couldn't do much to the SBQ by the sound of it.
---
Along with a 100% spawn chance. Bis option imo
---
You would think, but some people enjoy bullying others period.
---
It's the only mmo I have played that's pick up and play simple. My kids can play it it's just a fun quiet world, where my daughter can build a playground for her sheep sasquatch  and I can play for an hour or two with my good friend adventuring in abandoned mansions.
---
This game gets more crap then it deserves.
---
I used to collect robot statues. In this game you can collect almost anything! I once was in a camp where the owner collected ores, I felt like in a museum. Then I got a chance to visit someone's camp who was collecting toys, there was a long corridor of displays full of toys! Looked cool. There's also scorched parts in jars you can display. Most of the stuff is pretty easy to find if you know where to look.
---
What, pray tell, do you think I've done then?
---
Wow these protests are getting out of hand
---
&gt;so I joined his party
---
That's your issue. At that point (if Xbox live still works the way it used to) - a connection is established directly between yourselves and you are no longer hidden behind the fo76 game server.
---
With proper network analytics which anyone can really get hold of, he should be able to find your public IP. The next step is illegal but not impossible, but with your public IP they can in theory boot you offline.
---
I just wish I could lock VATS to a specific limb/head and have it stay there every time I pull up vats unless directed otherwise. I always select head but inevitably the next time I use VATS it's back to torso. ;p
---
&gt;Credit though, you killed a few critters in that stand. I've killed way, way more.
---
And now you've just murdered them with words as well. That's excellent.
---
I have. No idea what. You are telling. Us!
---
Sadly, it was limited. Welcome to 76 :/
---
Cain and able
---
Check this sub, even though they are wildly inaccurate (Beth is reworking the cards and the costs), you can get at least an overview.
---
IMHO I think that live service games have become "jobs" as opposed to games, everyone is exhausted.
---
I'd love to see a list of the 8 and what they are.   I know that's too much work to ask for tho.   I'm impressed, however.
---
At borderless windowed, I constantly had 9 FPS while in the game, but if the game was not in focus, I had 45 FPS. Only way for me to fix it was full screen mode.
---
Nah, I'm good thanks. It's fun to tweak your build every now and then. Save up to change your build completely. Try different things out. However, i would love to see new perk cards added and even some of the current ones changed. I'm excited about the legendary perk system though and also excited to see what the "one wasteland" update is going to bring. Also Interested in re-specing and to have perk card load outs, i want to be able to change between my scavenging perks, commando build perks, rifleman build perks etc.
---
i have base 3 int and with unyielding and team buffs plus food buffs i get over 30000 exp from line in the sand and can usually level up with one lap of westek whitesprings and a few dailys Lvl 180
---
Fuck the BoS. Using them again is the ultimate in lazy writing.  Couldn't care less about helping the dullest faction in the game. Would rather have more of the new factions please.
---
As long as there is the option to hinder as well as help those military jock assholes then the dlc won't be a total waste of time. Not.holding my breath though.
---
&gt;totally allowed by bethesda and their tos.
---
Is there a source on this? I know I haven't heard of any bans so it certainly sounds fine, but as far as I was aware, Bethesda have never commented on mods except to say they're not supported?
---
No, they are not creatures. They are robots. The captain in the riding shotgun is not a creature either.
---
I have it stuck on leg
---
Thats still +200%
---
So it's essentially "base" \* 3 + "base" \* 3 then? That kind of makes sense but just going for something like "base" \* "perk multiplier" \* "perk multiplier" would've been more intuitive in my opinion. Thanks though.
---
And I'm not sure what the problem would be with deciding what procs first, since it wouldn't matter with multiplication, which is implied in the perk card
---
what? I mean, I can understand the style beeing limited, but players not beeing able to build a basic structure now... WTF
---
I'm just thinking it's intentional because it seems like their decisions  intentionally slow down or destroy access to powerful things regularly.   Could just be a coincidence or confirmation bias on my part, but....   I'd actually want to talk to someone who knows the code to verify whether or not it's intentional.
---
Yes. Buuut bethesda changed her behaviour when the timer is up,so she no longer fly out of bounds. The event fails, but players are still able to kill her since she stays inside the playable area.
---
Your best bet without the bundle is having foundations going out from your house, and then either flooring or a roof coming out from the second story to cover it. Then using the steel posts to make pillars
---
Roast his ass!
---
"Hello OP This is the soothing Voice of Enclave President John Henry Eden... and I'd like to read you a bedtime story if thats alright"
---
YOU KNOW YOU READ/HEARD THAT IN HIS VOICE :P
---
(Technically it is a ZAX computer... just not the right... operations module)
---
Patch22, so season2, september.
---
It's 6pm CET
---
Yeah I get what you mean now, though it seems the 6 you get from nuka-cola dark comes from the fact that it adds the base stat for each perk in addition to the 200%.
---
So it's 100%+200%+100%+200% if you want to stick to the 200% thing.
---
makes sense
---
Store items cycle through otherwise the listings would be enormous. It will likely reappear every few months and stay around for several weeks.
---
Why do I feel that today's challenge will be like: "kill 50 Wendingo Colossus"?
---
&gt;  be able to give a super mutant a reach around without being detected
---
You just have to be unyieldingly hard then it's already possible.
---
habit?
---
Need to add corks raining from the sky as well.
---
I re-seated video card, checked the connectors, actually I checked everything inside, even capacitors don't trigger any alarm to me. PSU is brand new, it's silentium - don't know the exact model but I checked it and it fits the power demand even better than previous PSU.
---
Dying video card could be the case, although it doesn't really explain why it happens in just two games, including Fallout 76 (especially when it worked pretty neat around november 2019 and the issues started occuring post wastelanders).
---
I think it's worth pointing out that it's really difficult to find out what in game event could cause this to happen. I suffered a lot of crashing around water, now it's not as bad but it can occur anytime, anywhere - regardless of how long I play.
---
I'll give a try to downlocking when I'm back home and will inform about results.
---
Sounds like your cpu crashes and dump every process.
---
Fallout isn't gpu intense, more cpu depending. People with overclcoked CPU's having several problems from stutter to crashes like you have.
---
Try to reset cpu settings and get rid of any process which require cpu load.
---
Yep I know. But Imagine having 75 agility not 40. Would be ridiculous
---
JERK! HOW DARE YOU! 😂
---
How about leaving the limit and fixing broken cards instead?
---
So in your case they are both multiplication so the argument for which procs first seems stupid. 
---
But what about perls that add vs perks that multiply.  That order would matter.  Also programming wise its way easier for every card/effect to work on its own. 
---
Everything looks at base.
---
&gt;just going for something like "base" \* "perk multiplier" \* "perk multiplier" would've been more intuitive in my opinion. Thanks though.
---
That is how damage buffs are calculated, 3 +10% perks are effectively +32%
---
News to me. Thanks
---
Pretty much - It's not consistent with other parts of the game, but it is what it is
---
Nice.
---
I wear full power armour and get within ten feet of a goul and I’ll get a virus.  Hate to say it but mask don’t work.   ( in fallout land)
---
I use concentrated fire, otherwise I couldnt target the head, but I’m running it with only one point.
---
And I think that the first missing shots are a problem, you are losing time, ap and of course some hard hitting headshots. And I want to add, that you never gain a vats accuracy increase of 33% with concentrated fire, especially not with full auto rifles. (I know the 33% are relative to your current vats hit chance, not straight additive as many believe, but its still a lot more than 3 points of concentrated fire with a full auto rifle)
---
The environmental art.   Wish I could give that team an award.
---
Oh shiz, we better get our kork ready. Or lewi is coming for us.
---
you don't say...
---
If that happens finally we all can get our bloodied fixers without having to sell our first born child and soul.
---
Me too, really pissed off.
---
that is a fair point, that’s why i suggested losing out on some of those other features in gain for some. make it a little more customizable. i do think that we should be able to wear things over it though. the name is literally “chinese stealth armor”. we can wear clothes over all our other armors except this one
---
Don't be like me. 
---
I lucked into finding the decon shower plan in a suitcase at a train station when my alt was level 17!
---
Knowing I'd never be able to survive in a blast zone in order to get the required fluid and masses... I just figured I wouldn't get one for a month or so.
---
Then I had a kind team mate offer to craft one for me in camp, after seeing that I had the plan sitting uselessly. 
---
So I enjoyed using the shower for a week or so, even became part of my routine to stop, scrap and store, decon and then sleep til well rested. 
---
One day I have the great idea to relocate my camp, scouted areas and decided on a nice little secluded spot with a lead node...
---
The moment I hit (X) to confirm my body locked up, my eyes widened. It dawned on me my shower was gone and I now had no way to replace it!!
---
I've been cursing myself for the last 20+ levels. ;p
---
As an aside, I've noticed that nuked flora remains for quite a while after the initial blast zone clears off the map. Up to 2 hours from what I've heard on here. So waiting and going after to avoid the rads might be a good idea.
---
You overclocked your CPU, that buzz sound you get is your RAM unable to cope, that’s your crash
---
35yrs experience as a PC Technican i know that issue very well
---
I believe its at the normal reset time. So when ever your dailys say they reset
---
10 am EST the servers go down for maintenance and updates
---
I don't like long SE events because I've seen them fail.   After all that ammo has been spent.   Others may enjoy it; I simply don't.   I enjoy seeing how fast she can be put down.   To each their own.  (Since I can't solo kill her, no worries about my personally killing her too quickly.)
---
Yeah but it's different for the cola-nut and party-boy perks affecting the nuka-cola dark so that's why I was unsure if it is intended
---
Exactly i just posted a similar response
---
Her behavior is a smaller problem with 33. Its a lot easier to hit her in the air.
---
I have a strict one gun per character philosophy because I dont want to loose power for weight reduction. Perhaps thats why I prefer 33. We can agree that 33 is the best choice against normal mobs and that 25 and 33 have both their advantges against bosses.

Yeah, thanks for the insight, as the title said I wasn't sure if the inconsistency was a bug or intended.
---
you're\*
---
Arh thanks and one more question does the new wendigo event also come with this Update?
---
Thanks man
---
I think it's impossible to overlock this CPU at least I never really tried to. Just like I mentioned, there was barely any process running in the background but it doesn't make any difference whether there's 10 browser tabs running or not. It crashes either way.
---
I ran CPU stress test for 20 minutes in Prime95 but there was no error on any worker.
---
I also ran stress test on my GPU through furmark but it worked just like mentioned in original post.
---
Never have I upvoted a comment so fast, Y E S
---
What do You mean with “ all the materials needed” ? I keep reeding it all over but still haven’t figure it out, is that like a quest/event where You are going to have to get scrap?
---
Thanks for your detailed reply, help me out alot.
---
Did that the other day, I'd forgot to rename a full raider set I'd been given from a quest.
---
Then I have no further idea except bethesda changed something with wastelanders that makes the game unstable for your rig.
---
Well, some other buffs don't though and I assumed it would take the order in which you used consumables as an example but I see what you mean, though I don't know of any additive effect that may change the effectiveness of consumables, they are all multipliers from what I have seen so there wouldn't be much of a problem.
---
All in all it's just a bit misleading if I have a pre-war alcohol that gives me 6 str and a perk that "triples" effects of pre-war alcohol, implying multiplication and those two together then just don't do what they say.
---
Thanks for reply, although I'm afraid this is not the case because I never overlocked this CPU in it's 6 years lifespan. If ever, I'd go for a wild guess it could be something wrong with motherboard messing up with voltage, not even sure if that's possible.
---
beautiful
---
Arh yes thanks
---
Is it though? I'm not so sure. ITV only talks about the BoS community event in connection with the patch and I would expect them to advertise the event if it was coming in patch 21. And ITV mentions that Bethesda staff will play the "upcoming event" at QuakeCon this weekend. Feels like it's been delayed.
---
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Sure, but I prefer helping a few players who actually need some stimpaks or stuff like that. Not ones who are hoarding them or reselling them.
---
Same with my group. Drop the nuke, tag the queen coming out. Crouch n wait for her to land. Smack her a few times. Dead in seconds. Next!
---
lol
---
Harambe be praised
---
make the PA a favorite and it will give you a warning before you scrap it. I know the feeling as well.
---
What kind of flux does it use?   If it's one used by one of the popular serums or one of the new weapons, I could see not using it to make ungraded underarmor.
---
Welp.
---
What they needed from the start was a protectron radio DJ. I still get a chuckle out of hearing Mr Fluffy insult what his name by Morgantown airport.
---
Then wait until you get some god rolls.
---
Am I wrong or does the armor on the frame will sent to inventory If the frame gets destroyed? So you technically just need a new frame as far I know.
---
Uranium Fever
---
Only 69 days
---
The problem is when you start playing everything seems nice and once you done with questing you gradually starting to understand how many flaws game have. So if you survive till that time you probably change your mind. 
---
Community is great, sure, but just be aware there is a lot of bad guys who try to grief or scam as well as good ones who gives you some help.
---
 (I respect this lol and yeah it's all in the name of fun!!)
---
ow shit ur a legendary
---
Appreciate it.
---
Yup. We take turns each event use one person to get her to land and keep her there with a cryolator wile everyone creeps up in stealth and unloads. Best time i think was 12.6 seconds. Just prep before with food, chems anything ya need.
---
Looting apes
---
Just rename it so you know not to scrap it.  If you do that and still scrap it then idk what to tell you lol.
---
A BoS fanboy at ATLAS observatory will be offering rewards for certain Scrap turned in starting today with Steel. It's a community event, where across all platforms we need to collectively turn in large amounts of scrap. For instance 125,000,000 units of Steel.
---
You can read more [here.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/19lD84ailufdG6cgVdqls2/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-fortifying-atlas-and-quakecon-details?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_content=Bethesda%20Game%20Studios&amp;utm_source=Community&amp;sf126008022=1)
---
I’d take you up on that but I got wiped and I’m Xbox anyway.
---
You don't have to use so many emojis.
---
Big rip
---
Not for those riflemen and commandos, after getting the armor.
---
I know this is old but I had the issue and solved it.
---
Make sure you pick up the gold in the chest **last**.
---
Mules.
---
Considering noone knows what the BOS storyline is, nor the quests involved beyond the Atlas rebuild, or how it will permeate the map and affect other factions, I would hazard a guess that the answer is either Yes or No.
---
There's a community event soon where everyone has to deposit certain scrap materials for the brotherhood's return. Some numbers include 125,000,000 steel and 200,000,000 cork.
---
Yea if there’s no option to fuck these cunts off I’m never playing a FO game again
---
She a known freak and she on a long leash... As they say.... ;)
---
The DLC is merged with the base game, no need to do anything.
---
I was wondering when the troll would emerge from their sleep
---
ahh so just like the old-school method where you can get anyones ip by just putting their skype name online onto a website?
---
Sometimes a loadscreen will make the corpse appear again. Fast travel to the nearest location and get back. Much fuss to get a one star pichfork I know...
---
Build your camp on an acid extractor?
---
One word doesn't answer my question, but I'll rephrase it - wasn't 30k caps the max you can have ON your character? How mules can bypass this limit?
---
Strange, when my guns are below 50% the non crits change from 1400 to less than 500.
---
Indeed, with one big exception: sandman stacks on sneak attack modifier. As far I know this is the only combo where you have take care the order they are equipped. 
---
I know, offtopic, but maybe someone doesn't know it yet.
---
Touch their tech data hole. They're sensitive about it.
---
maybe a bit late but you probably dont have a camara on you
---
Nuts to that.  We use platform base for her to land on. All crouch to be hidden so she force to land at the “suspected spot”. Trick is to tag/Argo her straight away as she emerges.   But that’s just our tactics.
---
Also we should be able to acquire named legendary modules like bloodied and sentinel, although these would be rare there would be atleast some reasonable way to acquire specific piece of gear you're out for, since without trading you'll be otherwise pretty muxh out of luck in this game..
---
Yeah the brotherhood are bitches.
---
Shouldn't even be here if we're being honest.
---
Stealing from the locals and getting fucked over is Enclaves entire playbook.
---
And frankly I think they should leave it to the professionals.
---
Just had a funny thought. I wonder if beth can't make perk loadouts because this mod is copyrighted and thy can't find a different way to do it. How else is it possible for the mod to be around for so long but they can't manage it.
---
I really want to use this and the text chat mod but am scared of beths banhammer.
---
I admire that tactic. Nice thinking.

From [this ITV](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/55xUO5myjkzlgAewWjzCxl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-july-updates) which was put out shortly after patch 20, it is said or at least implied to be coming with patch 21.
---
“A Colossal Problem (Future Update) — Grab a Nuclear Keycard, light up the sky above Monongah Mine, and head deep below Appalachia’s surface to take on a treacherous legendary Wendigo Colossus! Join up to eight other Dwellers in this new Public Event that’s currently planned for our next patch.”
---
That’s the most official source I could find on it, the event’s release was already delayed twice (first delayed from the wastelanders release, and the second delay coming from patch 20) so I think it is going live today unless I had missed something
---
&gt;It's OK if you don't have 3 charisma because of your build but if you have 3, 6 or 9 charisma you can help others help you.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;**(If I see more Bloodies not helping, I'll start sharing perks that remove Rads.)**
---
As a bloodied build with 1 charisma, go eff yourself.
---
From nukes yes, but also from bait?
---
The mods are the fun police
---
There is no copyright since everything is already property of bethesda, they can do whatever they want. Terms of service are crystal clear in this point.
---
Go and use it, it is safe and not a reason to get baned.

Upvoted for "goblin on cocaine" :D
---
I get an out of focus bug from vats. it's like it gets stuck in half vats or something. a couple vats hits fixes it and all clear again
---
You still need to explain what happened in your bunker genetics wing bud. It looks suss.
---
Honestly people will probably nuke in all sorts of patterns around monagah mine for the first couple of weeks so you're better off moving as far away as possible.
---
It does, you get 5 toons on your account, every one can have 30k.
---
Check out the new Captainoob YouTube video. It shows on the map the best placement and spread.
---
lmao
---
Look man, I just work here.
---
Makes sense tbf I am literally 30secs from the mine on a lead dep. Didn't wanna have to move 😔
---
It does stack. Have a full team that runs strange in numbers sharing, and if you've all got speed demon you run so fast the environment doesn't have time to fully render objects lmfao. Not to mention marsupial becoming absolutely godtier.
---
I just said fuck it the other day and decided to pull out my legendary fat man. Underwhelming. Nothing compared to shooting mini nukes in FO4, NV or 3 for that matter
---
Hope you're right! Need something new to do (turning in junk doesn't really qualify as something new for me).
---
Strange in numbers stacks.
---
Thing is, it’s a fucking boring fight already lol is there an incentive other than an orange ballbag now?
---
Then make sure that you use different emails on steam and beth-launcher, else beth might have linked your beth-account to steam.
---
It’s ironic that we used to wait before looting to make sure items were showing up
---
Yes, community event with hundred of millions of mats to deliver to BoS - check Bethesda website.
---
You are so right about the server stability with the Fallout First members, I could take up to 10% of all that with my personal junk stash box, but honestly they really need to chill out and put the contractor lv 2 Perk and also what a waste ( not BoS supporter) of investment, they should at least make some more Prydwens so I can blow them all up, the should be able to make a couple thousand with all that scrap.
---
Bearhead next lvl.
---
Nah, I'm usually the first to criticise Bugthesda but that sounds pretty implausible.  It should take no more resources or code to handle 1 billion units of steel scrap, than half a dozen.  This event is just their attempt at successful server-wide events in other platforms.
---
I would like to add one thing to this list.
---
Cross play between PS4 and Xbox
---
Yeah, but it makes no sense to say I have 150k even if you got 5 toons and each has 30k, it's still be 30k because one cannot hold more than 30k or am I wrong? that's what I'm trying to get an answer for..
---
Yeah. That's the only weapon in NW that I have been continuously one-shotted by. It's especially annoying when shot came from like 50 yards away lmao. A sniper rifle, I'd understand. A shotgun? Bs.
---
Items stored inside a blueprint are only visible once the blueprint got placed or deleted.
---
You're going to have a really bad time if you don't move lol
---
Mafs!
---
Hehe.
---
God I'm childish.
---
They should first increase XP of Kills and decrease the xp from surviving. 20xp per kill (+10 for downing the enemy) is a joke.
---
And maybe a minor nerf to everything in the explosive category.
---
I returned that game because it scared me too much to actually play it past the first hour. And from what I've heard, I saw nothing. 
---
Water is scary!
---
Think you replied to the wrong person?
---
You are truly evil!
---
Hi childish I'm not a dad!
---
Because it's an escort mission. Because it requires 2+ competent players to complete. Because it only takes one twatwaffle to screw it up.
---
I have a furious fire rate one on my second craft, i love it, i use it on the enemies i want dead quick
---
Does that water tower day Harambe?
---
I don't agree unfortunately, some weapons or worth much more than others, it would become very unbalanced... Not like it isn't already haha
---
Keeping the cows alive is tedious solo or with an inexperienced group. The rewards are not anything amazing. I'm sure at least one of the weapons is decent, but none of them are meta. In short, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.
---
They won't, everything in this game needs to be a horrendous grind, it's the law.
---
&gt;it makes no sense to say I have 150k even if you got 5 toons and each has 30k
---
Maybe not to you, but to rest of us it does.
---
If you have more than one bank account, you add up all the accounts, no?
---
I deleted it and I still cant build the crafting stations and furniture I had inside. May I have been drawing from materials of those items somehow?
---
2 hours before standard reset time.  
---
4.5 hours from now.
---
Every word you said is true.
---
Half an hour? Nice. The dailies usually take me 2-4 hours. Monday's were easier though...
---
See my vest, see my vest,  
---
Made from real gorilla chest
---
How many Flamingo Units is that?
---
Thank you for the clarification!
---
Most of the time - yes. I focus on those dailies, though and don’t do much else.
---
What part(s) are you struggling with completing within an hour?
---
Yeah, this is quite common among games these days.
---
Right. BUT: if you are stupid like me and have a habbit of scrapping a liitle too fast you can scrap some of your parts before recognizing. It's murphy's law. Ifyou happen to scrap your actual frame, chance is you will scrap your arms and legs because not recognizing. Had this happenend, now my PA is named !!!PA!!!, never happened again. 
---
But i agree with some kind of warning, also.
---
“If there was an exceptional candidate, none of *you* would survive”, said ZAX. Candidate 76 stands fuming at the audacity of this bitch while he changes up his perks, since they didn’t work last time. Instead of being a bush Wookiee, he’s made up his mind. The pricks in marine armor and  grenade launchers can’t be allowed to kill him again.
---
“Voting ends soon, candidate”, said ZAX. He opens his PipBoy and chooses Morgantown, out of force of habit. He stands in his tight royal blue jumpsuit, emblazoned in gold writing with the number 51 on the back thinking “Vault-Tec might be corrupt asshats, but they sure knew about style...”
---
The next thing Candidate 76 knew, he was on top of an orange loot box in the penitentiary, but it has already been looted! “The match has just begun, and already you are behind, candidate” he hears, almost as if the robot is stalking him. He thinks “for fuck sakes, ZAX... Could you please fix the god damn load in times? No, of course not. I’m only here to do my SCORE challenge and that’s it. But I’m going out in a blaze of glory when I die this time.” He leaves the decrepit church, and he could feel the raw power of the flames. Smell the smoke coming from the charred remains of a fellow Vault Dweller’s corpse when he ran into the flames. Not far away, he saw a CAMP module. “Huh, that’s why he was here. Maybe I should do the same... No! I’m here to kill, not be a little coward. I must press on.” The snarl of a feral goes off nearby, and armed with just a combat knife, 76 gets charged by the feral, looting a Stimpak and a nuclear launch code from its corpse. He quickly scales the rusty stairs of a war ruined guard tower to get at the box upstairs, and he hears the tell tale beep of an unlooted orange box. He opens it to find marine armor and a handmade, with 90x 5.56 rounds. The heft of such a powerful weapon makes him dizzy as he runs back down the stairs for he had never held or wore anything this good as a Bush Wookiee before.
---
The flames start moving, but they’re moving extremely slowly. 76 opens his PipBoy to check the map. He’s still inside the safe zone. Looting the caravans yielded 3 more Stimpaks and two super stims. After picking clean the remains of the yellow and blue boxes, he had enough drugs to kill a horse, and enough .45 to supply the US liberation of Anchorage, with a combat rifle as backup. As he checks the last yellow box, he finds another nuke code. 
---
The flames start moving, much faster this time. 76 knew it was time to leave. He sprinted 10 meters before he got out of breath and started walking again. The *crack crack crack* of a radium rifle goes off not far to his left, and the dying scream of a feral pierces the air. The sound of the fire burning everything in its path is scaring 76, so he keeps moving. 76 spots movement out of the corner of his eye, and rapidly raises his handmade to take aim. BAM BAM BAM! *Candidate 76 downed xxGHILLIEMASTER69xx*. The flames engulf his loot bag, and 76 is forced away, but not before he could pilfer all his ammo and 4 machine gun turret plans. “Heart rate steady. Eyes focused. Impressive”, says ZAX. 76 is convinced by now the sadistic robot is watching his every move for his entertainment.
---
Now 76 is safe, he deploys and destroys all four machine gun turrets and gets 180x 5.56. 76 is happy with his ammo and loot. A group of three emerges from the river, combat rifles and a .50 cal machinegun in hand, two equipped with scout armor and one equipped with wood. The man with the .50 didn’t even have time to react as the bang of the handmade round sounds, and a bullet penetrates his skull. He falls, downed by an unexpected sneak attack. His teammates run, and seek cover. But it is too late, as 76 already has them in his sights. 76 takes aim, and pulls the trigger for a short and controlled burst into the back of the second man, and he also goes down. The third escaped, but it won’t be long before he gets killed too. 76 watches coldly as they bleed out. The third man sneaks up behind him, and shoots 76 in the back. 76 hears  a click as he turns around to empty his magazine into the poor fool, and relishes the easy kill. He almost feels sorry for the guy, he did run out of ammo after all. But 76 pushes his emotions down inside him. “Well done candidate. You have eliminated an entire squad. They were weak candidates anyway,” says ZAX. “If you wish to continue testing, candidate, I suggest you move into the safe zone. My calculations show this area will be destroyed soon.” And after looting their corpses, he goes.
---
76 gets a notification - Final Combatants Remaining! “Aw Hell yeah! I fought my way here. I earned this.” He hears a weird sound, and the “clank clank clank” and the whirring of an assaultron. He wisely chooses to back away slowly, while he hears the THUD THUD of power armour boots hitting the ground. A combat rifle goes *crack crack crack* and an assaultron bean goes DOOOM. 76 hears the clank of power armor falling and hitting the ground, while more gunshots echo. The assaultron suddenly come round the corner, and before he could react, he gets hit by the rotating claws. He pumps the assaultron full of lead, barely surviving the encounter. He collects another nuke code from its body and a super stim. 
---
He stabs himself in the chest with a needle and pushes the fluid into his body twice. He waits, while he recovers the health he lost from the encounter, while the smoke of the assaultron wafts into his nostrils. It smells different to the flames. Less dangerous, more like the metal factory he worked before the war. Memories rush back from thirty years ago, and he’s snapped out of his reverie by the sound of a laser rifle right behind him. He turns around to see two people in marine armor fighting viciously to the death, laser rifle vs missile launcher. 76 swiftly finishes them both off, as they had severely weakened each other during the fight. He is now one of three people left alive. The sky darkens as a huge beast wails and flies around what’s left of the arena. 76 shoots it down with the last 20 fusion cells in the map, and breathes in the ozone smell, admiring how clean a shot a laser rifle can give you while he drops it and switches back to his handmade. He sprints over a mine, then jumps onto the rooftop to engage the surviving duo in combat. They were caught off guard, and one gets killed very quickly. Before 76 could focus his fire on the last surviving opponent, she opens fire with her assault rifle, breaking 76’s armor. The sheer power of the handmade won out though, and 76 cried in joy as he finally gained the victory he always wanted, only to be engulfed by the flames.
---
He wakes up sweating, and once he calms down, he thanks the lord above this was all just a simulation. That he didn’t really get cooked by those flames. That he didn’t really just fight to the death and almost died three times. He thanked his lord and saviour he was still alive and safe in Vault 51, sheltered from the Wasteland outside.

You can use imgur to post image links. This place has never been as communal. More a place to give feedback and tips.

I don't know why it hasn't been added. The Sony issue has been resolved.

I do understand the games short comings, its Bethesda at the end of the day. It I feel I should defend them on one point. They said at the start it was not going to be "another" online game, they wanted to take fallout online, not make an online version of fallout. I think they missed the mark trying to recreate the sense of playing a solo RPG
---
Oh big rip!

Yeah a warning is always a good idea.

You can go to other fo76 subreddit for pictures. r/fallout76settlements or r/fo76filthycasuals.

Vats commando is kinda boring to me because it's whats 'meta'. If you want an actually fun build that is still OP, I suggest unarmed bloodied, without power armor. Insanely OP, but you feel like more of a boss than just sneaking around like a wuss. You also don't have to worry about ammo anymore. If you want to really challenge yourself, you could even make a bloodied gunslinger build. Hardly anyone uses pistols because of how underpowered they typically are, but if you manage to get good enough gear and weapons (I have a 3rd character that runs this w a bloodied gauss pistol) you can still do well over 1000 damage per shot. Pistols are the best weapons for storing up critical shots since they use up such little AP. Sneak crits can reach insane numbers with the right pistol build.
---
Yup. It sucks.
---
Usualy not. Something seems odd...
---
* step 1: save ammo for weeks
---
* step 2: use the gauss minigun for an hour
---
* step 3: think about scrapping it but eventually don't  since you paid so many legendary modules to get it.
---
* repeat
---
I was wondering when you were gonna stop shilling for big games companies that see you as nothing more than an economic unit.
---
See r/overwatch for why this is a bad idea in long term
---
If you hunt the stabilizing agents before you collect the flux, you don't need a fridge or the perk.
---
eg
---
A WS nuke (w/o competition) nets you around 15 glowing masses, 15 fluids, and 25 masses.
---
A nuke on Hemlock (w/o competition) will net you around 400 violet flux.
---
Since you need 1 of each agent and 10 flux, you need 3 WS nuke to one Hemlock. So even with a fridge (where you could store maybe 15 flux), you need much more time nuking for the agents so storing and/or carrying the raw flux is not an option.
---
I mean, surely it should be the other way around, like you trade in gold for treasury notes and spend the cash on things
---
Same. Any time I move faster than the servers can handle, I get rubberbanded.

Nobody is going to buy your trash mounted head plans. Everyone and their mother has 50 each already.

People hate starting it because it's slow and noone wants to hold the staff to shoo the Brahmin, works best with 2-4 players, worst with 1 or 5+, attracts the 'one shot' crowd for the Squatch and the 'run ahead' xp seekers who then leave the Brahmin vulnerable.

I actually don't mind it but it's screws up so often.

Rare junk like clean coffee tins, food dehydrators. Wedding and old rings. Not many

items in this category, but something you can go for.

Fair call, i like shitting everywhere too so no judgement there
---
So i must or i don't have to? You guys are so controversal in this sub.
---
Saw something similar with sheepsquatches on xbox
---
Dude, same. I remember it was slow catching up to an update once and I loaded the game like "Well this is completely unplayable." I don't know how console players deal with it.
---
If I was being a douche, I'd outright tell you that using so many emojis is obnoxcious and cringy.
---
Junk material? I turn it into bulk and sell it the Flatwoods responder vendor. Uses a lot of plastic, to bulk 1,000 steel at a time. But it maxes my caps out.
---
Run in a build team and find a crew. In my clan we help each other out by donating things like bobbleheads and Berry Mentats to help low level characters. We also bring them to places like West Tek and SBQ fights so they can tag high value targets before we wipe them out. We also teach how to do things like food stack to maximize XP.
---
Exactly
---
How they understand the lore of the real life region. They did their homework. Scrips were used as a currency to control coal miners once upon a time in WV. There was also something called the Coal Wars. Fallout reinterpreted it as workers fighting against the robots taking their job and dignity. WV had huge labor fights that were outright large scale battles.
---
The accents of the Foundation settlers is interesting. They had come from the north area so doing some research they have the Pittsburghese accent (which is sort of speckled through southern PA in general).
---
Add to that all the tiny homages paid to the region. The hot dog stand. The lighthouse. Mothman museum. All little details.
---
Mostly the three legendaries and the three events combination. Two events I can usually do, but sometimes three is too much in my limited play time (about 4 hours most days) between trying to find three legendaries, and the other six challenges, and the rep quests. I'm mid-level (106), with a seemingly mediocre build (I built a full-health sniper/generalist, like I do in all fallout games from 3 on). I'm sure that my build and my lack of any sort of hardcore capital-G-gamer "skillz" play a part in my difficulty, though.
---
.... that’s way smarter than getting shwifty.... kudos for making caps off something I thought useless :P
---
good idea, would like to add a 'rename' button.
---
Cursed Weapons. A new legendary modifier. Heavy hitting but at the cost of durability.
---
Not sure how many weapons there are but last I checked they all kinda sucked and, in one case, were actively insulting. A FFR Harpoon Gun. -\_-
---
I was being facetious. About the copyright part anyway.
---
So I know this is old, but it feels like yesterday to me:

Howdy fellow wastelander. I was building porches way before the contemporary bundle. I use regular foundations and then use the pillar glitch to put the pillars on the corners of the foundations so i can still put fences on the foundations. I can't find any video at the moment showing this glitch so ill try to explain.  
---
\- Put down foundations where you want your porch to be.   
---
\- Add one more foundation at the end that you will delete after building the porch.   
---
\- Make a stair all the way from the beginning of the foundation that you are going to delete.   
---
\- attach full upper floors so they match the foundations of the porch.   
---
\- Now take one half floor (2x1) and make it mismatch one upper floor, best to start at the end corner.   
---
\- Go to the stair tab and choose the pillars and place at the corner  of the full floor and the half floor  
---
\- now move the 2x1 so its in the middle between the next two floors and you should be able to continue this.   
---
\- Reason you want them on the corners is so that you can still add fences to your porch.   
---
\- After you have put a pillar on every corner, remove all upper floors, stairs and the extra foundation.   
---
\- now take a flat roof and put it over,   
---
\- enjoy
---
That's okay considering the rate of fire you have.
---
Keep in mind that while it's a good weapon, Final Word does not really have damage increasing attributes like explosive, two shot, junkies, or the famous bloodied. Yes, the armor piercing does help a bit, but it's not amazing. Considering that with the Stabilized perk you should be ignoring 95% of her armor and you still deal only 9 dmg from initially what? 77? I guess armor penetration is capped somewhere, probably at 75% or something. 
---
You are probably at that point of the game where you reached max damage with "regular" as in "guaranteed" loot. From there you can only improve by getting your hands on the proper legendaries, which fit to the build you want to have. This means grinding a lot (caps, scrip, gold bullion, reputation), killing loads of legendary enemies, farming events and also regularly checking player vendors. 
---
When I got my hands on a two star bloodied laser gatling I finally dared to switch to a bloodied power armor heavy weapon build. Running around half dead constantly terrified me, but I wanted to give it a shot. And what can I say? Since I went bloodied I melt things like they are nothing. Over time I found more bloodied weapons, at the moment I run around with a Gatling Plasma which is bloodied and explosive, and I put the beam splitter on it. The thing has the accuracy of a shotgun but that doesn't matter, as I can spray things across half the map, and they disappear in a hail of explosions, as if an AC-130 had unloaded its entire arsenal on it. 
---
The only thing I can't do yet is kill the SBQ on my own. Still looking for a bloodied faster fire rate minigun. Or Gauss Minigun. 
---
My point being: there is a period where you will increase in damage again. That's because you reached a point of good, decent damage which allows you to take down harder enemies faster with less ammo, meaning your grinding gets more efficient which in return means your loot getting better, and thus its more likely you find even better stuff. It's a self reinforcing effect basically.
---
Yeah, I can't wait to drop a nuke, arrive at the mine and find out I can't actually enter the location because it's instanced for 8 players and I'm number 9 to show up.
---
Haven't been on the PTS in a while so this might have changed.
---
After a while on FO4, I was just building.
---
Scrap everything mod, the cinema workshop... Build a stadium!
---
Well, that's a long and helpful post.
---
Chiming in to confirm, my main weapons a cultists blade, and I got a 1-star from Monster Mash within the last 3 weeks. I only recently picked up FO76 from the last Fallout Steam sale.
---
HA - so this is super interesting!
---
I went looking for some info on how much concentrated fire adds to the vats hit chance as from my general use I know it is \~20% per hit at rank three but not sure for rank one or two and I came across a post claiming that it's supposed to be different between semi and full auto! 
---
Who knew?!?!
---
Apparently semi is supposed to be +10%,+15% and +20% and full auto being +2%,+3%,+4% HOWEVER there is a typo in the code and the +20% at rank 3 applies to full auto's as well as semi! I think this is where we are getting our differing results. If they ever fix this, I may have to re-evaluate.  
---
lol - this game!
---
Yeah i’m just gonna let the dupers handle this one, i feel like there aren’t enough players to meet that kind of resource demand otherwise.
---
This is one of the most Russian toons I've ever seen.
---
Respect comrade. Respect.
---
Agreed brother
---
As mentioned, they sometimes turn in to meat piles quickly, but when they do, they sometimes appears in strange places. Had a sheepsquatch meat pile appear attached to a small shed, up in the air near the roof recently. Took several minutes to find it.
---
I play this game solo 90% of the time, and I gotta say it works well. At the same time I find that nothing I suggested really takes away from that solo experience, you really remain unaffected. So why not have both gameplay experiences in-game? The single player online experience as well as the very social mmorpg experience?
---
Comes free with the sneak build on the tent!
---
I get it, you hate the BoS too. But they don’t get wiped out until 2287 (if at all, I can’t remember what the canon ending of Fallout 4 is), so they have to come back. Just go with it. Odds are we won’t be able to even hurt one of them. Hopefully, they’ll give us decent rewards.
---
This is an amazing amount of nonsense condensed into one post. You made all of this up on the spot and 300 gullible people up voted you.
---
Nope. Haven’t downvoted anybody whatsoever!
---
Pretty sure the Alpha in Project Paradise is also a guaranteed 3* star but the issue is getting enough people to run it and also getting to the final wave.
---
Even events teams I've seen don't run it anymore.
---
In the very first few sentences they explain why they got banned. Using a 3rd party software like reshade or sweetfx was indeed a formal act against the tos, since they manipulated the game itself where mods only expand it and don't change the game files. Mods are loaded at last, when saying loaded I mean copied from the hard drive to the ram (this is what happens when you see a loading screen). Replacing the original game files only inside the ram.
---
I remember this case, since it was one of the very first attempts of nodding the game after release and bethesda had tried at least to prevent users from cheating,  even if they didnt wanted to. Don't forget these guys at support are only human employees who probably have no clue how games work or what this game in particular is. 
---
I also remember all these guys got unbaned after this "mistake" became public and news articles like the one you posted put attention to this case. But, to be fair, I wont recommend using reshade or any similar software since they are still theoretical not allowed.
---
I would love an option like this! As a level 29 newb it would be great to play with friends to help in harder missions! And text to chat would be so incredible helpful for someone like me who is hard of hearing or you know, gets booted or ridiculed for being a girl.

Worse is when you race to loot, see something wicked, and then poof! gone. Then the area is filled with ??? Emotes.
---
I’d love to know the logic behind putting those sitting and standing gorillas in the game. They’re a bloody baffling addition.
---
&gt; If you don’t mind quite the thematic leap
---
I want to add Conan Exiles on this list, probably one of the best games in that regard, also the different biomes you can build in (desert, forest, jungle, tundra, volcano).
---
Well in 3 the reavers were no joke, they're still an issue for my max level character
---
I saw this, it was incredible!!!!!!
---
Valid point.
---
You sound like a 14 year old that "has a totally cool hacker friend". You are telling very obvious lies. Your friend can't boot people and neither can you. Stop spreading rumors.
---
Alright, here is what I do:
---
Workshop Daily? Just take it any.
---
Any active event with players participating - hop in after a few minutes. If it just started you can buy 3 random items from a player or mod armor until progressed further and complete that quest. Then hop to the event and finish it.
---
By that time you should have the first „defend workshop“ event (that also counts for the daily if course).
---
Then I usually run whiteaprings golf club (also kill the sentries for bonus xp) which will net you 0-3 legendaries. Hop to west tek and clear it for another 0-3 legendaries.
---
Look for events like AWOL or Uranium Fever for the missing legendaries and event completions.
---
Whitesprings/West tek already empty and no event active? Server hop or complete the NW daily inbetween. 
---
Events you can really really force easily via workshops. With legendary enemies you might be unlucky but it shouldn’t take very long when you focus on whitesprings and west tek
---
Looks like I'm putting my minigun and .50 down and picking my axe up again.
---
Watch for the ones on the right side of the map. Bigger enemies..bigger squatch.
---
I've been spoiled by using perk loadout manager on pc for over a year now. It makes the game significantly more enjoyable. In fact, the character I started out using PLM with initially is almost unplayable without it. My current main is at least playable when PLM needs an update after a patch breaks it.
---
Ah, I didnt know about this bug, this is indeed very interesting.
---
Thanks I'll try this :)
---
Depends if we can orbital strike squads of paladins with Enclave skins bought from the Atom store
---
Good to know I wasn't alone with this.
---
But they are fun,, and you can pretty much also kill everything with it, just not just as fast..
---
You know you can glitch into the mines whenever and take all the ore you want without a time limit.
---
I’m confused. Did you look in your stored tab?
---
If they remove shotgun perks buffing my gauss shotgun that I so grinded for.......I WILL FIND YOU!!!
---
:) kudos. that's a lot of work and testing. well done.
---
Heh, I just went back to the Whitesprings houses for the first since...I think level 20-something (Order of Mysteries questlibe, maybe). Still got wrecked twice, but accidentally got the three-Star.
---
I want to apologize on behalf of my gender mates. In most cases we appreciate you girls playing with us a lot, but we suck at finding good ways to get your attention without appearing too vulnerable during the process. Somehow I managed to do it because I met my wife online, but I don't really know how she ended up with me. She must be a little bit dense.
---
The other few cases where the hostility is actually genuine we don't really talk about. Or to. We avoid them. Incels may be hostile to girls, but they are also weird and awkward to men. It's best to ignore them and not give them the satisfaction of affecting you emotionally. Just pay the toll to cross their bridge, move on and let them rot there.
---
thanks a lot for the explanation :)
---
If you can't stop scrapping pa frames by now I doubt an are you sure prompt is going to help.  Bethesda would probably have the default option set to yes.
---
Well later I’ll be giving it to Russell Dorsey at Atlas!
---
Yes, my stored tab had all my plants, generators and turrets. Everything that was outside of the blueprint. Everything that was inside the building, wasnt in the stored tab. Not before deleting the blueprint and not after
---
Bethesda already had the Gorilla model from Fallout 4 and needed something for people to unlock. That's it, lmfao.
---
Because they don’t want memes and low effort posts
---
Yes - and it would explain why there is such a difference of opinion on this topic!
---
This, In picture heavy subreddits questions and discussions get buried
---
That *is* odd, considering how laden it is with fussy restrictions/bugs when building on Appalachia’s tenth of an acre of flat land. 
---
Sarcasm aside, the building is something I really wanted to love, and enjoyed it for a while, but like many other things in the game it’s seen too much neglect and turned stale. I got tired of learning workarounds and exploits rather than just focusing on what my camp would look like.
---
My man!
---
It's all good! You kinda get use to it in the end really. Not just a FO76 issue and not something I see changing anytime soon.
---
Have had some fun with this game and great dudes helping out when I've walked into situations I really was not prepared for! 
---
You seem like a good dude - hopefully catch you online sometime
---
It was a fun event when it landed but these days people all gangbang the sheepsquatch and stop protecting the brahmin because yet another shit tier scrip legendary is more important then actually "winning" the event.
---
Same for Riding Shotgun. People actively ignore protecting the brahmin just so they can get a hit on the 3\* captain.
---
There is no event that gives rewards good enough to "force" people into actually making an effort to win it. New event comes out, gets farmed for plans for a week or so, people stop caring and sometimes even make them shit experiences for new players. Bethesda needs to overhaul all events but I don't see this happening.
---
Hope so to. Perk coins, sound like we are playing a ftp mobile crap and not A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game. Bet they are going to have a amusement park like sound to go along with it too.
---
What ia wrong with memes? I would kill to see a meme where davenport says "dweller, i assure you that those pictures of meg's feet are for surveilance only"
---
When you say “deleting the blueprint”. Are you taking about the blueprint in the stored tab?
---
easy enough to solo to get legendary drop if you level 40+.
---
only do it if I have nothing else on. And the chance at 2 legendary sheepsquatch spawning is always enticing.
---
Event complete by yourself is a bit trickier though.
---
Picked the right time to move my camp
---
Really, I joined the event as it was ending the other day. Event failed and she flew off.
---
No, in blueprint tab, I clicked delete blueprint. My stored tab has no blueprint.
---
Same. I'd even consider crafting ammo for it, but it weighs so damn much (both ammo &amp; gun).
---
If you want memes go to r/falloutmemes   
---
They clog up the feed. That’s why they don’t  want them here.
---
It wont get fixed, like almost all other atx items that are broken or doesn't work like intended. I was surprised they finally fixed the water wheel after several weeks of complaining that it doesn't work at all.
---
Fact is, atomshop items are almost always not how they are promoted. Either are the screenshots or description misleading or willingly confusing produced.
---
nuke fissure prime
---
They should just let you pick from a list, they tried so had to make the game balanced that they sucked all the fun out
---
Sounds like got the herbivore mutation!
---
OMG now I see, its in the stored tab like you say, but it looked just like a stairs! Man, and now I built everything again already xDD
---
thanks a lot for the info
---
&gt;Bow and Compound Bow
---
I'll add that more often than not, aiming down the sights with a bow in third person causes the crosshair to jump straight up. Super annoying.
---
&gt;Crossbow
---
The bug with the iron sights has to do with the frame mods: If you mod the sights first, they'll disappear when you mod the frame. Also, they don't disappear with the standard or prime frames, just the new frames added in Wastelanders like Explosive or Plasma.
---
&gt;Chainsaw
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this weapon still doesn't have a max level variant, isn't in any loot tables (only as static spawns), and doesn't benefit from any melee perks? I think the Ripper and all of the other "automatic" melee weapons are also varying stages of incomplete.
---
I don’t know why people are downvoting the actual answer to the question OP posted. I hope OP isn’t downvoting just because s/he doesn’t like the answer.
---
Because you cannot answer my simple question, it's not even about multiple "bank accounts". Can you or can you not have more than 30k on ONE damn character?!
---
I'm talking about when using vats. You can't crit without it.
---
This shouldn't happen, where did she fly?
---
Usualy, in the past, she flew to an unmarked location with a few ghouls outside of the playable area. I only encountered one fight where she dived for 30mins straight without a single break so we failed the event, after that she continued like nothing happened.
---
The floor
---
and any horde
---
and AWOL armaments
---
and Project Paradise
---
and I am sure there are others
---
I just went to Huntersville and then West-Tek, challenge done in 10 minutes.
---
Seriously, some people ....
---
“The rest u left for ghouls to have a sex orgy”  I snorted way too hard at that
---
Yes, stash boxes are abosuletly unrelated People forget this stuff is binary code, not japanese calligraphy FFS.
---
Hey, you do you. Though getting excited about the fruits of someone’s incompetence *can* be somewhat counter productive.
---
r/deadbydaylight is a great example of a thriving subreddit.
---
If there are low effort memes, they could be removed.
---
Because Todd once posted a pee-pee pic captioned "who's laughing now?"
---
Thank you for explaining.
---
Get a bigger gun. :)
---
if the person who knows he's got the aggro plays right, she will land plenty.
---
That is strange. There should be a blueprint in your stored tab. 
---
You do not need to blueprint before moving. 
---
If you build anything from any tab other than “stored” it will use resources. 
---
I move my base every day. Sorry, I don’t know what happened in your case.
---
I didn't, until some player put it on full blast during a scorchbeast queen fight XD.
---
I had the double spawn for first time.  It’s well worth the effort when that happens.
---
Well, the devs aren’t going to do it! Can’t you chip in?
---
I had it happen to me yesterday for the first time. I did nothing different from my usual daily routine.
---
Lol there you go
---
All I know is my gut says maybe.
---
([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpaQpyU\_QiM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpaQpyU_QiM))
---
Mmmmmmmm Fuzzy Brenda. Making my loins glow.
---
better ask the modders from the Nexus! They have way more experience with the engine than even the devs
---
Followed by another unban wave. Kind of like a Mexican wave, now I think of it.
---
Farming runs for XP overrated. Bump intelligence, group up and do events, SBQ etc.
---
Much more fun than re running same old spots. in short just play your game normally.
---
Unless re runnin same old same is your normal, then grin and bear it.
---
No problem (:
---
Seriously?  Just play the game and do events when they pop.  There’s loads of 3* - arkos, rumble etc
---
I think there is a probable likely chance that it could or could not happen
---
Yes, I punch them.
---
I tried this and the all the scorched died before the laggy molotov even hit the ground lmao
---
I had the whole robot armada of the cryptid event shot a scorch beast, this fight didn't last long
---
It's liker insider trading, haha
---
I also couldn't find the key. Just completed the Beckett mission and I'm staring at the crib as we speak. Sucks :(
---
How it mostly happens to me: I run for one of the Whitesprings gates. There are ghouls/miners/wolfs/whatever fighting the bots. I shoot for that one legendary and kill it. I hit a robot too so sentry and shoop-da-whoop-tron start their ass whooping on me. I kill them too and run for that corpse. I search all the bodies as fast as i can, i mean i saw a legendary im absoluBOOM... and everthing gone.
---
More like 100% more scrip for selective weapon type.
---
Since purveyor gear can be traded the scrip limit cannot be removed because of imminent inflation.
---
i was going to show my raider camp but i just saw this post, ty for the info imma put it on the other sub instead.
---
Purge the Enclave
---
Thankyou for putting this far more eloquently than I could’ve. 
---
Most routers use dynamic IP as standard. If you unplug your hardware for 30~ mins, you’ll be assigned a new IP when it starts a new session. 
---
If anyone called their ISP for a domestic DDOS (uk, at least), they’d be told to r start their router and a line test would clear any back end faults. 
---
The fear mongering and Hackerman level bullshit being touted as fact here is just gonna end up with one confused tech support agent wondering why a customer is asking them to call the internet police.
---
Todd bless you, awesome post!!!
---
If someone tried that some black trucks might show up to their house and take them to a black site. My family is a bunch of dod contractors and we work at home a lot.
---
But junkies is better overal for a fast fire rate weapon then instigating
---
I love this event.  Best unique addition to the game.  Sure it's an escort mission.  But it's a fun one and I love shaking the Shepard's crook at the brahim.  :D
---
If people stopped shooting her causing the stagger effect,  you know the look, she would land more.  The bloodied mele builds can then finish her in a minute.  However...... we then get complaints for killing too fast 😂
---
Looks like Bethesdas development team on their last christmas party.
---
I hope you're ready to die to the Enclave.
---
I always try to complete it whenever I see it on the map. I just need those sheepsquatch staff mods.
---
World building.  The map of Appalachia is really well done and the atmosphere around different regions works so well.
---
That cool.the first few levels seem to be easier than the last.i just hit the last quarter of the map only missing a few days and not doing  NW
---
because thats all the sun becomes. then the sun becomes a worthless karma farm for people who say the exact same thing with the meme format of the week of “bethesda bad”
---
Just let us toggle everything on/off. I sometimes just want to get lost in Appalachia, they have made the perfect world for me to do it in. But then this completely immersion breaking mobile game like pops ups just ruins it, looking at you public team notification. Or after a epic queen battle you get killed by a minor enemy because the quest complete notification fills the entire middle of the screen.
---
Weird, I soloed Free Range and the ‘Squatch worked for mine? Ah well. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Of course you are right but saying "This community is full of human beings and so, like any large population of humans, we run the whole bell curve from  assholes to  saints," just doesn't have the same ring does it?
---
Don't want my game sub to look like r/memes
---
Yes now I finally understand why people keep talking about Concentrated Fire as compensation for 33. :)
---
But still, I prefer having it on the first shot + 2 points of ground pounder for faster reaload. But with this info, I would say 33 and 25 is equally good. They are on the same level for me now.
---
I found a 3star dog near one of the workshops.i literally claimed 4 yesterday just trying to spawn waves in
---
To add some more to this, oddly enough the MIRV grenade actually works as intended when thrown into a body of water lol.
---
You reach level 33? Mate you Don't finish it..... You onky get 34.000 score, and you need 220.000, and we are in the middle of the seasons
---
I finish the run 3 days ago
---
I have the plan in my vendor :)
---
Not sure if worth mentioning: If you have very similar weapons in your inventory and one assigned to the favorites bar, loading in fresh may show the other weapon assigned instead and probabilistically equip that weapon. This was a bug fixed some time ago and returned with Wastelanders.
---
Example: I have a JE15 50 Cal (favorited) and a VFFR 50 cal (just in inventory), both with custom names. If I relog, my favorites bar shows the VFFR assigned but equips the JE15 when selected. In inventory, both weapon have the heart symbol but it won't let me un-favorite the VFFR until I un-favorite the JE15.
---
I have seen about 3 SE fails and I have to admit it sucks watching her fly away as you realize you just blew threw several k worth off ammo.
---
Mad boi
---
To get in team put on the xp perk takes some can stew meat and just play the game. After level 50 level become mostly meaningless.
---
🔫 They always were
---
With how text posts vs image posts display on mobile, people have a tendency to see the image and give and upvote and then just scroll past actual discussion. The front page would be Meme Format of the week saying the exact same thing, people with good and half hearted cosplays that is just Fallout generic and not specific to 76, random stupid pictures that are only vague at all in relation to 76, and then a collection of “here’s this thing i found or, here’s my camp”.
---
It’s low effort, it’s mostly used by karma whores who just want easy content for points.
---
I mean i’ve seen people have a german shepherd they put a bandana on and said “Look, Dogmeat”
---
See my sweater, there’s no better than authentic Irish Setter!
---
*cough* equip *cough* fireworks *cough* mine *cough* 😜
---
But yep, everyone has their preference.
---
I was out of town and couldn't play, missed two days and I'm still ahead of where its suggested you should be. And I'm about 75% done.
---
I mean, most likely. I don’t know why they wouldn’t. And I mean much further down the line next spring late fall ish
---
Each level are 25 point Moré, so, the level 50 is 2225, and 100 3500 for example
---
I have murdered many in the wasteland in pvp and workshops.
---
Hell yeah,  I have 10k steel with his name on it
---
It seems like o.p isnt trying to grind this legendary run event.
---
the only acid extractors I've seen are at the factory things i forget the name
---
Ain't that the truth.
---
Sony is charging a huge cut for cross play.
---
Ehhhhh but scorched animals become human and can be eaten with cannibal
---
Ohhhh, ok ok
---
I agree with Bethesda.
---
I still have around 10 of each of the mounted ones.  I´ve sold probably over 50 of each. I sell all at 19 caps  and they go out pretty often. Just want any new players or some people who don´t have a certain plan have a way to acquire them. But many times ive thought about dropping all of them.
---
Well done! Maybe u/Ladydevann or u/Valseek could pass it on t the team.
---
I mean if you skin starts looking like red muscle, you start growing crystalline structures out of it and follow the order of a giant flying bat, I don't really think you can be classed as human anymore.
---
Thats exactly what I'm trying to not do. My biggest problem is that with Junkies or Bloodied its so OP they are basically youre only two realistic options. I know vanguards is good but bloodied and Junkies are so OP it's stupid.
---
I'm trying to stay away from those by building a high health shotgun/auto weapon build and its ok. I mean if it was J or B it'd be far more effective, but hey "it just works"
---
Also for any/all of you that play those builds, im not hating just a "its not fair"style rant, however I still love the game
---
This is why I refuse any trade offers players make, nothing I keep on me I want to sell and if they want to buy something off me that’s what my vendors for. I’m sick of players chasing me spamming trade emotes because they want the weapon they saw me use or they want my armour, if I’m using it I’m not going to sell and if it’s not in my vendor don’t bother asking me to sell it.
---
Sorry but i need to stretch in the mornings :)
---
10 am est
---
Not really, just has a loght
---
Even if you just sneeze, in my opinion.
---
Flamer barrel for the win! 🔥
---
I've been banned pretty long, so I'm far behind in the legendary run. :)
---
The first fireworks got my B3325 LMG unyielding heavy. But perhaps today I will reach the second fireworks and this one will go into my Commando. :)
---
But I think they will fix both bugs eventually.
---
I like your videos, always a cool build, never thought I'd run in to you in game though!
---
The automatic fast firing weapon damage bug section could use updating with the 6 stars that trigger it and armor effect that triggers it.
---
This has been one of the more frustrating bugs for me for the last 6+ months. 
---
It will even do that if you pick up a plain non-Legendary version of a weapon.
---
On my Heavy gunner I had to slim down my weapon selection to just one of each weapon type. When my favorites bar bugs and replaces the weapon it unfavorites the old one for me. I am to worried about dropping or selling hard earned weapons, and favoriting them is one of the few safety measures for to prevent that.
---
I started that way, but I really liked the wooeewoooeewooo sound so I went to find out how to get more of it.
---
I'm no software engineer, but from what I can tell, that's the problem: nobody can isolate and replicate the bug. I assume that if someone could, that's 90% of fixing it, but so far - no luck.
---
That sucks bad 10% of my build budget is magazines. I need them! No they are not going in the garage.
---
Like others said, more duping and hacking on PC. It is also two totally different economies, and sometimes fun to compare. Sometimes you see fum examples of what PS4 people don't really care about and sell for cheap that PC players are doing a lot. But in the end, it's three different economies
---
So people need to realize that the brotherhood are not always good guy. Like every fallout group they have their own goals and ways of operating. The brotherhood just so happens to no try and murder or torture people left and right and they  actually kill things that act them like raider and mental unlike the minute men.
---
Also from the wastlander dlc its clear that nobody know what the scorched plauge was, or that it was a plague. This makes it kinda hard to fight. And we the player are immune so of course we be fine to kill thousands of the dam things.
---
Sweater made from settler? The new raider coat.
---
I can't breathe.
---
Scorchbeasts, and the scorchbeast queen will drop ultracite PA mod plans
---
500 frog jars is the build limit. What's that in apes?
---
Text chat will be like:
---
"XxsellerxX: visit g2g*com for cheap caps and glitch weapons!"
---
"Tony69420: lmao just teabaged a low lvl noob with wanted state Haha what an idiot thanks for the 2 steel and 1 adhesive"
---
"Paladindensed: *some toxic shit idk I'm uncreative*
---
System: XxsellerxX was banned.
---
"XxXsellerXxX: visit g2g*com for cheap caps and glitch weapons!"
---
To the best of my knowledge:
---
1- AFAIK, he said that was the original promise, and that Bethesda still hasn't delivered on that, and there is no word on when that feature is going to come. Considering that the first year for day one 1st subscribers is about to run out, that's a very big problem. 
---
2 - Probably never. They said a very long time ago that they would fix it, then never spoke about it again. It has been mentioned countless times here and in the PTS forums, and it hasn't been acknowleged by Bethesda.
---
3 - I have very little hope they will introduce it in the next season, if they ever will they'll most likely put it in the Shop just like they did with the Contemporary Bundle.
---
4 - This hasn't been addressed either. Originally there was speculation that they were planned with the Vault Raids and in the original plans of Legendary Payers, since the road map for Nuclear Winter had a crowned Vault Boy with 5 stars near the Vault 94/96 badge. As of right now, we don't know.
---
It's funny you posted this.  The Galleria is my favorite place to blow up cars also. I like to practice throwing grenades at cars. Or really through car windows.
---
Ask around too people may sell or give you some. If you were on ps4 I'd sell you some.
---
You're not buying or selling in that case, just giving and taking.
---
I already answered that, not my fault you are too aggressive to red/understand.
---
I really enjoy the base building but man am I terrible at it..... what I see in my head does not come out well when I try to build it lol.  I found the perfect spot in the mire and will probably never move.  Just tear it down again and see if i can make something that looks remotely cool lol.
---
A friend of mine held a close eye on her kills for this challenge and this is not the only enemy that is classed weirdly.
---
If you have a full set of ss armor and don't wear outfits, then tes it's worth it.
---
I'll do anything for BOS cosmetics, I'm a BOS simp
---
Ive had shielded raider underarmor in my vendor forever and no one bought them... maybe i need to Change that again^^
---
I would like to turn on notifications to defend other people's workshops. I never defend my own because I got tired of being sniped in PVP, but I always defend other people's when I see them.
---
Please tell me you friended the guy or got his ID
---
Thanks mate
---
Nudie magazine day!
---
In to my fallout 1st box
---
At this point i would rather see some random pictures over the 100th topic demanding perk loadouts otherwise the OP will "riot"
---
Scrapboxes are the least taxing. It's an material code and a quantity nr. Normal stashes hold things like legendary items. Condition. 3 affixes. Wich mods are on it. Weight.
---
That’s 30 levels below you. Cant forget the best part
---
Trying to justify the 200 limit with lore is as pointless as trying to explain the New-U Stations in Borderlands as anything other than a gameplay mechanic. Beth put the limit in to keep players playing. To prevent them from grinding to their hearts content, getting everything they want from bullion vendors in a few weeks and putting the game down for possibly months afterwords. Demanding as much time from players as humanly possible... and then some.
---
Hahaha this is how you fit inside power armor, my brother has gotten stuck this way a few times, with and without armor/outfit showing(until getting back in a suit of pa)
---
With the mining carts and three shacks? If so, I used to live there....I mean I think it was there. There was a deposit of something, but I put my generator room over it. Either way, I moved months ago before they delayed the event. But either way, I know your pain.
---
Ahahahaha
---
cute
---
We should be able to craft legendarys by our own. Like a regular fixer + 3 legendary modules = one random legendary 3\* fixer. But this will never happen...
---
There are a couple of ways to build porches, though in my opinion the best looking ones require some knowledge of the build systems quirks.
---
For example you normally can't place support pillars on the corners of foundations. However, by building a staircase and some 1x2 floors off of it you can get the pillar into your desired spot. This is because it will snap to the "inner" corner created by the floors, but will still remain there after you delete  the floors and staircase.
---
Similarly you normally can't place outwards facing flat roofs down, as they only snap to the inside of walls. You can get around this by placing walls back to back using the "door trick," placing two doorframes back to back which cannot be done with any other wall (though using the swap function it works). You can then build your roofs off of this  outwards facing door, which can then be deleted once your finished.
---
I'll try to find videos of this being done, as I realize now that explaining it purely through words is probably fairly confusing.
---
You had me at ghoul sex orgy.
---
I don't speak for the sub, but I progressed further and I think I can read, so I don't need pictures anymore. 
---
Or maybe the majority here don't want the sub to be meme-central.
---
If you have something that absolutely needs a pic, then you can go through the "trouble" and host it on reddit/imgur and link it in your post **WITH** a description.
---
I never use the hunting rifle due to the optimal migraine of using a left handed bolt while holding the rifle right handed. No other game does this.
---
The handmade and radium get a pass. It's mostly fine. The elver action meanwhile....
---
Sort of yea, just to the south of the mine on the edge of a cliff, had a lead deposit and some minecarts around the area, and boarded up mine shatfs
---
sometimes I'll get two levels in one go... usually when I level up IRL, that's always fun.  
---
Can't believe I just referred to the standard adventure mode and levels as 'IRL'... how meta.
---
Or VATS 95%?
---
Pretty sire you can just tap on the flair and it will sjpw all of the posts with said flair. No, it's not a support forum, but it is a social forum and Bethesda has actually taken suggestions for QoL improvements. Suggestions aren't just made for a little discussion. If a post blows up and gets a lot of attention you'll often see "bethesda replied" as a few of their team members are on this sub and they don't get notified when they're tagged, apparently.
---
Also people just want to discuss what they're entitled to. See a post you don't like? Just scroll past. Finding too many? Well it's a free speech platform, it's going to happen.
---
Also I'm not having a go, just thought I'd ppint out that those kimd of posts actually have helped in the past
---
But then playtime will be reduced down to 4/5. Don't forget, almost all quests are technically just lazy fetchquests.
---
&gt;I think the reasoning is that a bullet casing flying across the screen looks cooler than one flying out of view.
---
Except the bullet casings in this game fly across the right side, not across the face, they got that right at least
---
There are buildable ones. I have a pylon house built next to an acid hole that I mine. Also one in mountains to top left
---
I logged in my 5th character who hadn't done NW yet, got first place and went up 2 ranks!
---
Posting this 6 hrs prior to a patch that will, hopefully, fix a few of these bugs seems a bit stupid! checking the update and posting this with things that are still broken, bound to be a few 😉, seems more productive!? Maybe its just me?
---
I'm not aggressive but in slightly annoyed that you're playing a smartass. could just say yes or no instead of expecting me understand your weird explanation.
---
Yep. A perfect example is the animal crossing sub. There's not even a discussion thread when a new update comes out. Just more fanart and the same pictures that get posted every week.
---
Sounds like you want a filter bubble.
---
Don't you think you'll better using Facebook instead of a open minded platform?
---
No offense tho.
---
Grounded
---
YES!
---
It didn't work for me.
---
Was it the one with that water tower or whatever right next to the main tracks?
---
97 here it’s been a grind
---
NMS base building is like next level. Keep meaning to get back into it, primarily for that reason.  
---
Of course, can't really compare that to Fo76 as the amount of space you can have to yourself in NMS is for all intents and purposes infinite and with persistent terrain modification and the likelihood of accidentally coming across another player being negligible it's virtually a single-player-game.
---
A follow dbd and fallout player? Hello there
---
Yeah, I´m a bloodied build level 198 and ii can level up every 20 min or so if i run west tek and the burrows once
---
Check your stash, do you have any of the mistress items that you may have bought from a vendor or transferred from an alt? specifically the veil, I found this bugged the quest out for one of my alts.
---
Do people really dupe mountain head plans? It's easy to become overwhelmed with them by playing legit and they aren't very valuable. Wtf
---
What about gauss weapons missing the first vats shot always? Also, pistol and shotgun most of the time lock you out from using items, sprinting and reloading. Have to holster or use a melee attack to fix.
---
Xp food, feeding my crippling mental addiction, then running west tea, the asylum and occasionally the high level area of the capital
---
Haha! And I knew what you meant.
---
I started it on my character prior to wastelanders by going to the mansion originally, there was a veil inside the mansion as well. Idk if this information is still the case but you might give it a shot.
---
Yes completely different kind of base building. I haven't found a base in the wild yet. But people share their bases and coordinates to teleport there in the sub. Don't know how long ago you played but there are ingame community highlighted bases you can visit now.
---
If you didn't do miner miracles already, that excavator pa can be used to finish it. Be sure to learn its plans first from the terminal and when you register the pa and finish, it'll give you the plan for the power armor station to craft more
---
I also farm this for the sheep plans. I pretty much agree with others here, it's too easy to screw up and the sheep weapons aren't popular enough for people to care about em. I love em and I'm an unarmed build. So Cheers to you, fellow sheep staffer lol. 
---
OP if you're on xbox I can mod your staff if you want until you unlock the plans. I might have extra plans too but need to check.
---
I'm not sure if I have it, but I'll check when I get online after work if someone hasn't hooked you up yet. I just started an 8 hour shift so it'll be around 9 hours from now if I have it.
---
Why are people down voting this. I had the same problem last week and people down voted my post so much. It sucks to have the last mission of the game auto complete for you.  When you have worked to get to that level and for me, saving it to do with friends. It takes away a sense of personal accomplishment. No matter what you guys feel about the mission.
---
Shotgun being ballistic serves me well too, grounded serum and all. It's not like the weapon is op anyway, it's just viable due to all the bugs. Especially true for all the other shotguns.
---
I personally never have voice chat on. But that's mainly because someone always has music in the background, or screaming kids, or whatever. So I never actually hear any of the comments that others experience. 
---
That said, its pretty childish to ridicule someone because of gender or other various reasons in a video game. Especially Fallout 76.
---
Most higher level players can do a majority of the game alone, so having a lower level player doesn't cause any harm at all. On public teams, I'm happy to have a level 20 something follow me into Whitesprings. They tag the ghouls, I'll kill them, we both get experience and loot, and it literally doesn't change my game at all.
---
The point is that all of those groups fucked up, not just BoS. Each of those tried their best to handle the situation, but all of them worked on their own and did not trust each other. And now we see the result, just ruines and corpses everywhere.
---
NUKE THE MONEYS
---
Seems as good a place as any to share an album of my recently departed camp at the top of Seneca Rocks, at the very highest point in West Virginia (despite Spruce Knob being the highest point both IRL and according to the signpost there).
---
[https://imgur.com/a/rLj7wDf](https://imgur.com/a/rLj7wDf)
---
I felt like a change of scenery, and also was getting a little bored of having a camp that was only reachable by fast travel; in a resource-poor part of the map; and difficult to fast travel to accurately the first time (usually took a couple of attempts to spawn in the camp rather than halfway down the mountain side and countless visitors would give up before finding my shop).
---
That's generally what happens when you post facts lol.
---
There will be when Subnautica Below Zero comes out
---
86 here, so frigging tired. They better add more ways to earn score like they promised for the next one.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ I moved like half hour ago, cba going back to look now 😅 unless I need some cheeky lead ore
---
I was very upset when I saw they aren’t coming until winter. Perk loadouts should’ve had priority over everything else.
---
I am on xbox, it would be great if you could mod my staff!
---
Yes it will
---
Didn't learn the first two times?
---
Me too
---
I know this ultimately boils down to opinion and it's fine if you like it, but I don't considering getting an optimal migraine to be worth showing off. This is the only major game i've ever seen where the bolt on bolt action rifles is on the left side.
---
I was meaning it in the fact that the beginning of yhe return is starting. They should be arriving by end of september since thats when the new SCORE system starts.
---
I might have some, I'd have to check my inventory, but yeah, like the others said, sbq and scorch beasts (fairly rare from scorchbeasts though in my experiance.) If you see the sbq pop up you are generally going to get some sort of ultracite plan from the fight if the event doesn't fail and you are in it.
---
I'll check my inventory when I get home(about 9 hours), they just take up space and I generally end up dropping them, but if I have any you can have them.
---
I like NW
---
Is the DBD playerbase  still as toxic as it was years ago?
---
Currently the fireworks are one of the best things since they are a tad bit bugged and increase the reload speed on your weapons.
---
That sounded dirty.
---
Experience is the best teacher
---
thx very much ) I forgot to ask is the current situation (20% instead of 10%) a bug or by design? In other words is this likely to be patched out? Thx heaps
---
Nope what you've got is it
---
13% xp now for cranberry cobbler (this last longer than the relish as well)
---
Worth it imo
---
Evidence of Bethesda implementing a single change suggested in these forums.
---
Spaghetticode approved.
---
Well done for getting 4th!
---
don't know, I always do it when I see it and have time. Didn't really notice low attendance either.
---
You can sell ultracite ammo. I sell it in bulk for 2 caps a round.
---
hence the need to commit to a build sometimes. Bear Arms, Batteries included are your go to here.
---
Nooooooooooo what does it give without Herbivore?
---
In an update quite simply have a lead up quest. Pick a side and the one u pick rep stays the same one u don’t drops back to enemy.  Problem solved
---
By design, carnivore buffs got bugged as well.
---
Almost like they need a 3 story propaganda spewing robot to accomplish anything
---
*Grodd nods in approval*
---
5%
---
Nothing changed since wastelanders.   I’ve don’t the quest twice since.  
---
U sure u haven’t completed it already?
---
Do u want it?  Then it’s worth it. It’s the only way you’re getting it!
---
Finaly someone understand why i hate them. Theyve been like this as far as i ve been playing.
---
Forsure tyty!
---
Or standing up frozen but then uninteractable wether you kill it or not. Painful when it was a 3*
---
Same here. I had it happen once and it was when I played nuclear winter before the reset time. I've stuck to the above ever since and knock on wood I've only had it happen that one time. I'm still mad that it just happened to be the day by weeklies reset.
---
Yes... my 46 year old dad!
---
I tempted to build all my walls with frog jars now
---
You say by 'design' then describe it as a bug. A bug by definition may be patched out. Design would not be. Which is it please I has confusion? :)
---
Hahaha this is hilarious!! :)
---
I got autocorrected so had to edit my post.
---
Bullshit I can’t upvote this more than once, if I can’t exact vengeance on the brotherhood for abandoning us and leaving Appalachia to the scorched I’m killing every mutated critter I see just to prove how pointless their return is. We don’t need you, Vault 76 are the founders, protectors and cultivators of Appalachia and unless you give me shiny new power armour you can fuck right off back to the glassed caverns :^)
---
So is the cranberry cobbler thing a bug do you know. Although it still looks worth it to me as I live on Cranberry Relish &amp; Gourd Souup
---
Exactly.
---
I still dont have it, lol. I am level 310, thought i had it but looked at around 250 and realized I dont. Tried a few times to get it but just keep missing. Maybe one day, its not high on the list yet 😁  this may get me trying again.
---
Bethesda also forget and blame player stash too to be fair!
---
I just got the raider collectron, mostly because i can have it scavenge chems or weapons too. but his lines are funny.   
---
" Sometimes I think about burning this CAMP down."  
---
" I know where you sleep at night. "  
---
"  I love the smell of corpses in the morning. "
---
the buggers thx heaps for the clarification
---
Lock picking is kinda getting one with legendary perks
---
Started as BoS, became a raider. A true free spirit that is, both raiders and settlers cry about how I treated them. I did all the muscle work and they had the honor to stand behind me, watching... I hear threats at most but they are to afraid to do anything.
---
How so oO
---
New legendary perk that allows you to insta hack and pick locks rank 1 is 0 level locks 2 is level 1 locks and goes up to rank 4.
---
One of the cards makes it so you can lockpick/hack everything without equipping other cards. And the different ranks of the cards makes it so the different level locks open automatically
---
No it’s not a bug? It’s a plant based food. It’s just the one I use so I’m telling you it more than doubles xp. I don’t have info on relish off the top of my head
---
Cranberry cobbler just gives more food and last longer than relish so I’m suggesting to check it out to use along with the others
---
I picked up one of the swords you get that someone had dropped a bit ago, could that be goofing it up?
---
I cant solo it because my gear, getting people who actually do what needs to be done is a pain in the ass.  Its hit or miss big time.  Poeple are worried about missing out on the legendary creatures so the brahmin die.  If bethesda would fix this issue everything would go so much smoother.  If you are part of the event, you should get the legendary drops regardless if you hit it or not.
---
At least you didn't abuse it cause I bet with all that extra strength you could hit like a truck with an unarmed weapon
---
😗
---
I'm with you on that one. I actually have more faith in the modders ability to fix stuff than Beth.
---
Yep this is a new character, I'm gonna try to just go to the manor and see if that works
---
Not sure if you're asking for evidence or if you're pointing out there is evidence in these forums.
---
Usually it's just stuff that's covered on youtube by people like juicehead, who actually show the posts, but recently there was a change to how many perk coins were awarded from animated perk cards. A while back we couldn't even turn our head when we sat on a chair, which now also has a 'hold to interact' icon due to suggestion. Also those obnoxious atomshop cardboard cutouts at train stations.
---
There's a Bethesda replied section if anyone wants additional proof anyways
---
They won't take any of my stockpiled technical data anymore, that really grinds my gears!
---
Thanks, I'm gonna check that out when I get the chance
---
A lot of people are saying that it’s so there isn’t just memes, but honestly that’s a horrible excuse. r/tf2 has pictures, but shitposts/memes aren’t allowed except for one day a week, and there’s no problem there.
---
I was more interested in discovering what was causing it to be honest. It doesn't go away, I died a few times and it persisted. You have to relog or re-equip the gear to get the stats back to normal.
---
Awesome job!  Takes about 5 games of top 10 to advance with my main, so I created a new one for this challenge.
---
Ghillie suit on, I started mid map, slightly east in Morgantown. Didn't have to move until the circle shrank for the third time, and only had to go 15 feet. The circle shrank again, and now there were only 5 players left, unarmed me and a heavily armed team of 4. They began shooting at the bushes, and when they hit me I ran into the fire. Bush wookie suicide...keep that other player from getting any experience from me!
---
If you're level 45-50 then it's an easy solo tbf
---
I can't live without thru hiker
---
Yep, it always seems like after I kill too many enemies in one spot the legendary corpse will often disappear. So I loot them fast. There is also a glitch where if you kill an enemy too fast after VATS you can only loot them for a split second while they fall to the ground.
---
It’s more the suggestions on here which seem to be a loop of. Vending machines being where we want them not where they are/scrip limits being scrapped/annoy able to be sold to robot vendors etc etc. Not beta testing and tweaks being made. That’s the point of beta testing. I don’t think I’ve seen a single post on these forums about a change wanted that’s actually been implemented. Let’s be honest they just fully endorsed duping in the game. Have done nothing of the ammo factor glitch and 1/2 the players in NW cheating in one way or another
---
So this guy can have a million gorillas but a magazine rack is a huge Chunk of my build limit.
---
Just an extra tidbit about the gauss weapons. 2mm EC is not affected by bandolier or batteries included. This sucks! Ultracite 2mm is so damn heavy. 1000 rounds is about 40 pounds and with the gauss minigun you blow through that in 30 seconds at a queen fight. If you just want to carry around several thousand rounds it’s almost impossible, and then on top of that you can’t horde it your stash because how heavy it is. It’s really making me not want to use my favorite weapon in the game. Regular 2mm is pretty light in comparison but then the ammo crafting...there’s just no in between.
---
There's no legit way and  I think most of the non legit ways have been patched. But there are ways to optimize your camp so you have more to work with. For example, turrets eat your budget as do crops and anything that's animated. The big mothman neon sign thing is another culprit. Premade structures use less budget than building walls, so these can be an easy way to add rooms without adding much to budget. Also if you're looking for more space, place your camp module as high up as you can. You can get more vertical build area this way. You can also incorporate some existing structures into your camp if you are in the right location.
---
15-20 minutes average time? It might not sound like that but you're lucky. A lot of minions spawn in those 15-20 minutes which is a lot of fun to kill.  
---
I think the average for me/our group is about 3 minutes and I can tell you, that is boring as hell and makes you wonder why you launched it in the first place. Ten minutes in the silo for 3 minutes of "battle"... Even when we all agree not to use our 'magic' guns, there is always somebody there that does. Mowing down a SBQ in 30 seconds is fun in the beginning but it gets old really fast.  
---
The battle you mention would indeed be very frustrating. That \*should\* be solved today with the new patch (earlier patch made it impossible to cripple its wings, which should be again possible after the patch)
---
If you want to really buiild, using forms instead of bult in structures, 7 days t die is awesome.
---
Also, it's the building game where it matters most how you build. I like when what I build is useful, not just pretty. In that game how you build is really important to survive
---
Cobbler only lasts for 30 mins whereas relish last for an hour.
---
Typical enclave murdering noobs
---
IIRC it should be implemented, but I’m not sure. Checking inside the vault now
---
Oh right on. I’m confused with the juice probably
---
amazing list. thank you!
---
Then give/sell them to people who will use them.
---
It's not a rare bug and is easily replicated.
---
Just wear a damn mask!     Oh wait.....
---
Thanks for the new subreddit to visit :)
---
What is it then? A glitch? I didn't even know why my carry weight was so high until I started testing, so I'm sure it is a bug lol
---
This happens with blue ridge uniform as well
---
How do you know if she's targeting you?
---
*Achshually* the ultracite in them is *forced* into their bodies, not grown. That’s what those petrified corpses are. Scorched who couldn’t find more ultracite crystals to keep them alive.
---
Best in slot option in you opinion? Bis?
---
Monke
---
Things are like this.if you only need cramberry relish,then carbivore also has its own version with the tasty squirrel stew.But herbivore also has easier INT int the form of brain bomb a brain fungus. The best INT for carnivore is scorchy beast brain ,which is harder to get.
---
Then the difference is that other herbivore food is usually more on the gun side,with better criticals or PER. Carnivore instead has many(like a lot) of melee buffs that cam really pump your damage to mars.
---
Make your choice.
---
We won't know until Bethesda publishes the patch notes for Update 21.
---
Ahh I get you. Before PTS people pretty much relied on these posts and I'm pretty sure someone mentioned Bethesda actually encourage these kinds of posts. I think the fridge came from popular suggestion? I can't remember off the top of my head but I remember an actual feature being implemented due to high demand.
---
Yeah that's the problem. If someone playing a game where grinding IS the point but on a slightly lower scale they'll be less inclined to exploit. Some people exploit out of lazyness, but some people exploit because of the rediculous loop. I mean look at all the money glitches on GTA for example.
---
Yeah it's a glitch, it doubles the effect of unyielding so all your stat boosts are doubled.
---
Probably should add the Tesla Rifle Lobber Mod is not a learnable mod. It is possible to find a Tesla Lobber in the world, but its incredibly rare and you cannot learn the mod, even if you scrap that one.
---
can’t trade the new craftable weapons from wastelanders unfortunately
---
One or two dupers will finish these in the first few hrs
---
The whole lost sleep, lose sleep, not sleep, trend right now is getting overplayed. 
---
 Whoa look how ripe that banana is, idk if ill be able to sleep tonight.
---
Great idea. Even further something small like letting us set a different Atomic Shop Icon for each character. We get so many for free and a lot of them have themes that would fit my different builds.
---
Even if you could, you don’t want to for two reasons. 
---
One being the legendary perk system that’s coming. 
---
Second is because of you in the future. Those cards might be annoying now, but you’ll be so thankful when you decide to switch your build and have every rank of the cards you need so going from stealth sniper to bloodied commando doesn’t take days of grinding levels.
---
This used to be how people got unlimited carry weight back in the day.  Unequip and reequip as fast as possible.  Idk how to do this one but like someone else stated, I’m sure there is videos on how to increase carry weight and replicate this effect every time u log in
---
GG on your module rolls, this even took effort for the dupers lol
---
This game just gets better as time goes on, doesn't it?
---
Sorry! Hahaha
---
Yeah, I don't think it's unyielding stacking cause I think TYR announced that it had been patched properly so I don't think that can work, maybe pre-existing buffs bugging out, I've never experienced it but I can see it being a problem as some will abuse it for their own entertainment, also is it with only strength or is it all stats except endurance
---
Nah, Almighty Todd says "It Just Works!"^TM
---
I didn't touch my gear until I realized something was affecting my carry weight so... It seems to be triggering randomly?
---
Nope it does say in game the crystals are a result of fungal growth.
---
That would be hilarious
---
Somewhere in here they sort of had a debate about that. Seems like it could work in theory if you just apply the bo us to the bulk stack. I'm not sure what super duper actually is tho
---
Android auto correction. Was about to write best, tablet says no.
---
I’d be curious to see what your strength glitches to in these moments. And see if it’s a strength glitch or purely carry weight
---
Well, if it gets upvoted it means people are really stressed by not having a loadout manager
---
This is one of the things I will happily except haha.
---
But as you can see the stats go back to normal when I re-equipped the unyielding gear, so it's related to the armor at least. Maybe some legendary effects were overlapping, malfunctioning with one another. I only had intel &amp; xp gain buffs.
---
Really? I never noticed it
---
It’s immersive /s
---
I'm already a stealth sniper build. Mostly around nightime as well with the perk that boosts my specials at night
---
No, and seeing how some overly decorated camps take forever to spawn in now, I don’t see how expanding it would be a good thing.
---
I can guarantee if I ever see your shop I would buy one instantly. Been looking for a Shielded Road Leathers for far too long.
---
If your on ps4 I’m selling 3 full sets in my vendor. Psn name is same as my name here. Gotta go to work be home in like 10 hours.
---
They don´t drop the codes. It says so on one of the loading screens that they get erased once someone dies.
---
pc? I still have to check its in store.
---
I do it whenever it pops up. I want those throwing quills!
---
Pc ? I have to check i still have it.
---
Found out about this a while back and assumed it would get fixed if it is the same glitch.  If you Google double unyeilding effect you should get a video showing it.  Somehow not surprised at all that it would still work half a year later lol.
---
No, i'd like to have a link on the right side where i can chose to filter out the "suggestion" tagged posts. This is a common feature in bigger chans.
---
Those suggestion do nothing for me. I want to read about the game and not about wishes.
---
I guess you would be a lot happier on Facebook since you seem to have problems with understanding my quite simple post.
---
[yeah its been mentioned before](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hwwr5o/bethesdas_secret_service_ghillie_skin_is_very/)
---
The rewards aren't worth it, and the legendary is usually a bust because some jerk always 1-shots it.
---
thx :) appreciated
---
On pc the duper’s are our obi wan kenobi. 6k active players on steam I doubt Bethesda launcher boasts much more. So some things are gonna require like 120k resources per person. Each freaking challenge.
---
IIRC at the start of the game herbivore did give double the benefits, then at some point it was changed, and now they Fixed it.  My understanding is that currently this is by design.
---
* Cranberry Relish - no Herbivore = 10% XP
---
* With Herbivore = 20%
---
* With Herbivore + strange in numbers = 25%
---
Herbivore all the way :) thx very much
---
Ooo, but this game's already easy enough at level 50. That'd just help overpowered builds be more overpowered without any concessions. 
---
Also, we're getting perk load-outs later this year. So you can have 1 loadout with hacker/green thumb/lockpick on and switch them in when needed. Which... Kinda means overpowered builds will have no conces... \*Sigh\* heh.
---
Harambre lives matter
---
that actually explains a llot of the cnfusionn on the sub I think thx a lot I'm going to get me some Herbivore serum
---
Oh, I haven't told you if it's a console or a pc.  I am a ps4 user.  I'm sorry.  But thank you for your favor.
---
Don’t feel too bad.  I spent an hour trying to launch my first one last night, went through all of my ammo, got everything in place, then realized I do not have a decrypted code fuuuuck me
---
Everyone bashing on you for spelling man, sorry. Is English your second language?
---
Cool! I had found the plans already from another player that was selling it for 50 caps, but it's nice to know that there are cheap ways to get it.
---
&gt;the game crashes 20 minutes later.
---
Because of a memory leak in the "grunty damage sound" files.
---
Get rid of the damage cap, fix stealthboys and teslas,   both appear in compass when sneaking, bring back team PVP, being back base destruction and slap damage though with much higher costs when wanted.
---
Loool dude.  Thats their only purpose 
---
F
---
This, some people want to go all minecraft
---
Nuclear silo status holotape is pretty much the only one you should keep, everything else is useless once played. Maybe the hologames if you want to.
---
Wow I didn't realize the extent of these things....I was well aware of a few of these but I didn't think it was this much. Thank You for posting this.
---
Personally I’d rather craft them a terminal and then they can send me email to the quest terminal they’d released and then never used again.  But at least I can tell if Biv and the two scout masters want to see me.
---
I don’t know if you hit what I was saying
---
I like the rewards. They're unique and you don't see many people use them. Both weapons also fit into my character builds.
---
Yes. But I can’t imagine that lasting more than 1-2 years
---
Lol oof
---
Very true enjoy whilst you can.
---
so like. did you just not pay attention when that was explained, or...?
---
Wait wait wait.
---
So wearing armor that would cause damage you TAKE if you were melee blocking somehow causes ALL shotgun pellets to crit?
---
Where can I get this armor, I need this because shotguns (at least the ones I've used admittedly) are not good unless you're 3 inches from the enemy.
---
Possible, I tossed them all on another alt and a day or so later I managed to find the torn veil one of the corpses.
---
It sounds like you haven't been keeping up with the Legendary Perks coming in September so here you go: 
---
Legendary Perks System Refresher
---
If you weren’t familiar with Legendary Perks from the last PTS, or just want a refresher, here are some details on how this system works:
---
Legendary Perks are new high-level Perk Cards you can access via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Menu, and you can equip them to add even more power to your character builds.
---
You will be able to unlock your first Legendary Perk slot at level 50, and new ones at certain level milestones after that: 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 300. 
---
Your characters who are already high-level will immediately have access to one Legendary Perk Slot for each of the above leveling milestones they've reached. 
---
For example, a level 250 character will have access to 5 Legendary Perk slots, with the ability to open a sixth slot at level 300. 
---
Each Legendary Perk has 4 Ranks, and you can use new “Perk Coins” to rank them up. 
---
Earn Perk Coins by scrapping your unused normal Perk Cards. 
---
Legendary Perk slots are account-wide.
---
Here's the list of the Legendary Perks so far (subject to change): 
---
-  **Ammo Factory** - produce 50%/75%/100%/150% more rounds when crafting ammo. Yes it does stack with Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
   - **Funky Duds** - +50/+100/+150/+200 poison resist when wearing matching armour or power armor
---

I'd give you one right now if I could lol
---
Lets test the new patch before assuming they have fixed anything :)
---
whats the difference between them and regular police?
---
What?
---
Do you have to hit the mine directly, if not then you can cause you don't have to hit fissure prime directly and many just get it on the edge of the blast zone
---
How many is that in flamingos?
---
Oof indeed! 
---
But, yes, perk load-outs are coming. Most likely with the Brotherhood update later in the year. So a click of a button and you'll be able to hot-swap between crafting skills setup, looting skills setup, and bloodied-one-shot-everything-with-no-drawbacks setup, heh.
---
Thats what I said!
---
That's what nukacrypt is for.
---
Instead of the Mothman Cult we need the Harambe Cult for this dude.
---
yes im even inclined to pay double or triple the scrip just to know what type of a ranged or melee weapon im getting, like just define for me, heavy? commando? rifle type ? pistol ? special ? explosive ?
---
since they are different type of perks for every type of gun, there should be this ability to distinguish my random legendary weapon im getting by my scrips
---
Apes Together Strong.*
---
What annoys me but also amuses me is how cruel this event is to me when I try to solo it. When I have 2-3 partners we get a few bloodbugs and the like, and then maybe a yogi bear or 2 at the final battle with the sheepsquatch. 
---
When I try to solo it, they immediately sic a pack of glowing wolves on the Brahmin, and after I barely manage to fight those off the second attack is 3 yogis that immediately run up and one shot all the Brahmin.
---
The sign for the mine needs to be covered.
---
Do not join random people parties.. just don't do it! Who cares for what it's for just don't do it.
---
You are correct! Thank you for the info.
---
* meds like berry mentats and mentats that increase intelligence
---
* food that increases XP like canned meat stew, cranberry relish, ...
---
* drinks that increases XP like nuka cola cranberry
---
* unyielding armor that gives loads of int
---
* armor with +1 int
---
* leader bobblehead or intelligence bobblehead

I don't know what I was expecting, but I almost spit iced tea all over my screen.
---
Hey you might get a ** or *** Instigating rolling pin!
---
Even if you get the flux, its still not worth it
---
I hate the bears so much. Its takes about 5 seconds for them to kill a brahmin because of their ridiculous attack speed.
---
Since they’re weightless, I just keep them in my stash and drop extras I find. Half hoarder, half collector. I think I’ve actually listened to most of them after picking them up but definitely not all.
---
You just take the total number of items that would normally appear and multiply it by 1.3.
---
Now them coding it in properly that doesn't, I don't know, flood the map with Wendigo Collosuses shitting Silo Nukes everywhere  is the concern.
---
Oh right, lost my bearing so forget what I said haha my bad
---
What platform are you on
---
You put too many points into charisma instead of intelligence.
---
*slides in as enclave* y’know, there is another option....
---
Super Duper basically gives you extra things, Like food or drugs or ammo when you craft them
---
It breaks down to effectively "I'm making 100 widgets at the end I should have 100x1.3 widgets"
---
I wish, how does mutants 1* board from a 3* deathclaw sound
---
My favorite is the Nuka Cola plant. Lots of cars available for aggressive deconstruction
---
I run events while in a team running the relevant bonus. In particular Line in the Sand, Radiation Rumble, Project Paradise, and Uranium Fever are the ones which I keep an eye out for. Line in the Sand can be especially effective if the enemy spawns bug out, if this happens and I have stacked experience buffs then I can easily get two levels, if not more.
---
Also while it should be obvious make sure you are making the most out of the experience buffs available to you.
---
* Finish Daguerre or Beckett's quests and keep them in your CAMP to upgrade the Well Rested buff from beds in your CAMP (+5%).
---
* Always join/make a public team and run the Inspirational perk (+15%). 
---
* Food - There are experience buffs for both Carnivores and Herbivores, but planted based ones are both more plentiful and readily available. Cranberry Relish (+10%/20% with mutation), Cranberry Cobbler (+5%/10% with mutation), and Cranberry Juice (+2%/4% with mutation). Plant some gourds in your CAMP, run through the Cranberry Bog (Cranberry Glade in particular) for the Cranberries, and then follow the river near the Landview Lighthouse to get some snaptails for sugar.
---
* If the Path to Enlightenment event is up run it and interact with the Wise Mothman (+5%).
---
* Any buff to intellect will increase the amount of experience you are earning.
---
These last two I'd save for when 2XP is active given their scarcity. You want to maximize their effectiveness given that they are hard to come by.
---
* Leader Bobblehead (+5%/10% with perk).
---
* Lunchboxes grant a buff which can stack up to four times. If you want to get the most mileage out of your boxes then pop them at highly populated events, and hopefully other players will follow suit (+25-100%)
---
Cover girl !
---
Yikes, this is the first time I’ve complained and I’m not looking for anything that will magically get me a 3-star. I was hoping people would comment places to find one easily since I never seem to come across them, there’s no need to be rude about people asking for help.
---
It will probably be advertised as a plushie but in the end made out of wood or something
---
Doooo eeeeeeeet.
---
Yeah I posted one, good to know he’s consistent with his build lol
---
Do you know who made this? I must pay them some form of respect for making this work of art.
---
Thank you. I hate when I see this 'suggestion' on this subreddit
---
Yep by maxing the rep for both it leaves them nowhere to go.
---
PlayStation, Sorry
---
Is it a bug or a feature? We my never know.
---
The mat is available for workshops but currently not available for camps. Maybe they are afraid people will set up traps?
---
So each slot is for a different perk regardless of rank or is it each rank in a legendary perk takes one slot?
---
what platform if pc i can run you super fast for queen and kill ez.
---
The packets are routed through your ISPs network in a ddos attack but are usually passed on to your modem to handle as most ISPs do not offer any type of ddos protection services to standard customers, if the modem is weak or has no type of protection to such and attack it may either fail or simply pass the packets to your router, if the router is the same is will either fail or pass the packets along to your connected devices. Usually the modem or router will always fail first or if they have protection will ignore the packets and drop them. 
---
I work as a enterprise technician troubleshooting and repairing business networks.
---
Trail fireworks mine? 😏
---
I’m really not looking for something to gripe about, I don’t generally encounter 3*’s and really I was just asking for locations where one might be. There’s no reason to be mean to people who are looking for help and in all honesty this is the first time I’ve complained about TLR.
---
Not true. I can solo it 😊
---
Wastelanders is finely falling apart. Welcome to the jank.
---
Your maths are so very wrong its unreal, the highest amount is 250 million, divide that by only the 6k steam players and thats just under 42k each, where you seem to get 120k per person with steam + beth.net is beyond me.  
---
Would like confirmation if ps4, xbox and pc are all pooled together for resources, then it would be a walk in the park for even the highest required resource.  
---
6k on steam is lower then ive seen it get to, beth.net has way more players than steam does (based on the fact that out of the 15 or so people in my discord that actively play im the only steam user)  
---
If xbox and PS4 are added in thats huge amounys more players into the equasion aswell.  
---
Bethesdas not going to make an event we are expected to fail at, they want us to compkete the events and goals they set
---
:(  I don't like the jank.
---
U only need to use the crook to get them moving. Then switch to a weapon. It’s slower but a lot easier to do and can get the majority of attackers down before they reach the bramin with a good commando build
---
I know right? I can’t wait to start dealing justice to BOS scum when they land!
---
You can find a three star enemy at the event "riding shotgun" i don't know if its gauraunted but i have never found a two or one star at there.You can find him halfway throught the event where you need to open the cargo door or something like that.I always go there when theres a challange to kill a legendary enemy.Sometimes you can find two legendaries.
---
Who
---
Hurt
---
You.
---
:(
---
What does this holotape do? I launched nukes for 10 or so times but not using any holotape during run. I'm i missing something? Why do you keep it?
---
It checks the availability of the three silos from anywhere on the map. Tells you the cooldown time as well that way you don’t run through a silo and it ends up someone did that one within the last three hours.
---
Honestly fuck Todd Howard has been my mantra for the last two year. Someone needs to make a T-shirt.
---
You get six slots and you put whatever six perks you want in there regardless of the level on those perks you picked.
---
It's been showing me that a lot of players have no idea how much to charge for items. Missiles, mini nukes and 40mm grenades are worth nothing not 20 caps each come on!
---
These things have been broken for quite a long time now.
---
Don't pay that close of attention but I am pretty sure the mods are looted from the queen and not given as a reward.   So just showing up doesn't cut it. Need to show up and do enough damage to be able to loot her.
---
You need to add a bar that shows how close you are to leveling, so you can pick the character you want to chase daily challenges with more easily.  
---
FFS, can i have ONE day without "level up" as a daily?  ONE DAY?  Also, blow me for that "kill a 3 star legendary creature" bullshit, bethesda.
---
Hah!
---
You're not wrong..
---
I hope so. I wish Bethesda would release patch notes before the actual patch like most other games do
---
Well, isn't it a bit pathetic that you suggest a filter to disable suggestions?
---
Also, a subreddit is what the comunity is making out of it. Acknowledging that most of the posts are requests and suggestions, wouldn't it self explaining that it exactly is what this comunity wants? Here are literally no memes or other similar posts categorys, so i guess sou probably should check out the other subreddits.
---
You are not the special one who deserves his own filter button just to make 80% of this sub posts vanish. You are not the single one this sub is made for.
---
I did understand your silly question, that's the reason I even replied. You are the one who don't understand that you are wrong here for obvious reasons and your whole post is exactly the opposite from what you want. Go dm the admins or as I recommend just join one of the many other subs.
---
Cool. Thanks for the clarification. Was gonna be a bit bummed if it was like regular perk cards and max out at what your special stat was allocated for the max ranks available to equip.
---
Maybe you're right, for some reason I thought they were given as a reward too.
---
I went to the burrows and unfortunately for me had no legendary’s spawn which was annoying since nearly every time I go there’s at least one. But luckily I went to West-Tek next and got it off a super mutant
---
Correct. You can only have 1. However, regardless of which one you place you can set it to collect anything that any of the ones you have unlocked can collect. So you can place the Raider but set it to collect junk like the Scavenger.
---
You never asked any help in your post. If you made a post with question instead of complain, ofc i would name locations (banned in Google tho?).
---
I hit 81 yesterday, I think I'm a bit ahead of where we 'need' to be as I hit double XP hard :)
---
Gatling gun. Good damage. Ammo efficient. Perfect weapon for leveling.
---
Uh damn I wanted to place two to collect both, wasted 500 atoms I guess
---
50 :( hitting 100 is impossible for me since I started late
---
I'm at 80
---
I sell every type of Shielded for 500-1k Caps. They sell consistently! Decent wee money maker!
---
My playstyle is that i always save things for later but at the end i never use them. I quiciky reach absurd amount of medx, psycho etc. The only thing i use are buffouts If i get overencumbered so i can go back to my camp. Same goes for bullions(i never visited the vault after the mission). When i got my first treasury note i said to myself i will see where can i trade them but never actually went there. Saw some people on this sub asking to remove limits for scrips and those things (i also have 850 scrips atm) and decided to see where can i sell them. The thing im most happy about this is im going to get the achievement for having 1500 gold bullion :)
---
Settlement building was definitely my favorite thing to do in Fallout 4, but CAMP building is so watered down and restrictive that I just can't get nearly as into it. The restrictions kill it for me especially. I was trying to do something that should be simple: snap a foundation to a row of foundations at the halfway point between 2 of them.  There is no reason this shouldn't be as simple as moving it and having it snap, but by the time I got the piece where I wanted it, I had half a dozen extra foundation floors and ramps, and enough stairs and upper floor sections zigzagging around that you'd think I was M. C. Escher. And then none of those extra pieces wanted to be removed until I'd slapped down even more of them. Eventually I managed to finagle them all away in some zany order that required a lot of trial and error. It took me an hour to get 1 foundation piece where I wanted it and the whole time I was nervous that I'd make an irreversible mistake that would make removing some temporary pieces impossible. I still have a staircase from when I first built this CAMP site, that I don't want but still haven't figured out how to remove without getting the "structure would not be accessible" message. At lease this staircase leads somewhere, so I can live with it.
---
Interesting. Didn't know that. Thanks!
---
78
---
And so was I. Then I went bloodied. And now I have 40-some points in reserve. Trust me, keeping that stuff for when you want to change is useful.
---
Bad rng
---
Google can slip up with Daylight Saving, so watch out for that!
---
That's sucks dude, if I could donate score points as I will end up in abundance I'd happily boost you on that front, all in all I do hope that you are enjoying yourself
---
This is insane. I won't even go into my qualifications, because there is no reason to believe me. But this scenario is stupid to the extreme.
---
Is this remotely possible? Sure. I can think of a few ways to do it. It'd take skills and/or resources that nobody would utilize to extort crappy FO76 legendaries from some rando on Xbox.
---
Sorry if I live under a rock but what’s the benefits of nuking that area?
---
Yep. Last time I did it I was the only one herding the Brahmin and healing them with friendly fire when needed. Only to have some overpowered leech show up at the end to kill the sheepsquatch before anyone else could get a hit.
---
This post made my day.
---
It’s much appreciated, don’t worry about it it’s completely my fault for not playing earlier. I’m enjoying it even though completing these challenges feels like a second job
---
I’m on Xbox but thank you anyway, I just find it really stupid and pointless, you get a 1* for killing a end game boss which eats up ammo for everyone even with god role guns
---
To be honest that's a problem for every online game, and there are many ways to deal with that. It's not a counter argument. If you don't want chat you can just disable it and nothing changed for you.
---
Ain't no way that camp is surviving 🤷‍♂️
---
What's your psn I'll make you some guns.
---
Right where you’re at, 74. About 800 score shy of 75. Should be able to get 3 rank ups today with the weeklies. Can’t freaking wait to get home from work.
---
I've moved my CAMP unit dozens of times, and still can't get it to spawn me anywhere near acceptable. The problem is my CAMP is at the base of Grafton dam and spans the river, so half the time it spawns me underwater and the other half it spawns me inside a rock.
---
83, just shy of my target of 86 for the Jangles Backpack. Once I've hit that I have little interest left and I may stick just to the daily/weekly score and build up one of my other characters in any free time - a wun/win as even the lowest level Wastelanders xp contributes to the score repeatable.
---
Of course that plan may change depending on the specifics of the individual rewards for the BoS lego challenge.
---
ask for someone craft you unarmed pointuring power fist. (no ammo)
---
same for handmade or fixer full modded. (use sometimes when you have ammo)
---
same for gatling gun. (really low cost, easy to find (super mutant x100)
---
try what you prefer.
---
don't pay too much.
---
Just use a Tesla.
---
Irk
---
Tesla is the way to go!
---
I agree, i'd rather come here to see discusiions about the game, and not see thhe sub flooded by threads about pics of people characters/camp i don't care about.
---
I'll keep them for the legendary system other then that I  have no use for them.
---
Sweet we are at 85 after I clear the weekly and dailies I should be ready to blow throw some banked atoms lol
---
Although I am proud of how far I have come I have found it a ball ache a lot of the time due, I can't wait till I'm done and I don't have to hit it hard for a while
---
BLM
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this all up. I also admire your self-control in not lapsing into profanity while documenting what is just one wave, in the tsunami of issues this game now faces. At this point I just want to shout and scream at the devs, but apparently that's not productive. Sadly, it seems waiting for them to address the tidal wave isn't productive either.
---
Im on pc, you too ?
---
Well considering how the VTU baseball hat has been bugged since wastelanders with absolutely no word on a fix, like countless other cosmetics in this game, I'd say it's not that big of a deal.  I miss the way the old had use to look.. The wastelanders update basically stripped it into a plain red hat...
---
All fine, it was intended to be a joke. I know this aswell from other games, and that the support team cant do much since burner accounts are free if you buy them with stolen credit cards. That's why the first seller got baned and another one instantly proceeded.
---
Tesla for the win!
---
aaaaand you’ll need to level up 1000 times to have enough points to get the level 3
---
there is a youtube video by some fallout girl.  its about what you can do with the posts (from the stairs tab) she explains how to semi glitch things to get a decent enough looking porch.  if u cant find it let me know.  i can check my history later on
---
2 Shot AGL FTW! Since they drop 40mm often enough I can usually last the whole fight.
---
Finished on Sunday.  I physically abused that double xp weekend couple weeks back.
---
IIRC, you get a free one from the enclave quests, but if you can’t find it in your inventory or stash, they sell one in the military wing in the enclave. It’s handy if you want to do a few nukes.
---
I'm at 66 now, hoping to be able to get to the end without using any atoms
---
[In January the estimated player base on PC is 22-35k and climbs to 400k+ when you account for consoles](https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/fallout-76-player-count#:~:text=At%20the%20time%20of%20this,million%20copies%20sold%20at%20launch.)
---
  
---
The 6-7k is active at any one time and only on Steam. Not everyone moved from the Bethesda Launcher, and I believe the Windows Store may be separate too.
---
Bethesda hasn't clarified, but I believe the challenges are correctly tagged as *community* wide. Much simpler to gift everyone these rewards than to break it out by platform. Plus the numbers jive with 400k players. That puts it at 500 cork per player, which is doable by First subscribers only and without dupers.
---
Ah, makes perfect sense now. Luckily for them, it seems there are at least a couple of gorilla fanciers in the game judging by my downvotes.
---
The different Collectron are basically just skins and unlocked collection options and are limited to one physical station at a time. Its odd you can't reskin on the fly like you can with some other camp items but have to scrap and rebuild each time, but all skins have the same menus so you aren't losing anything if you aren't fussy about which annoying voice it has.
---
95, been grinding fairly hard, but not using any xp boosting food and running a fairly low int character, Im hoping to hit 100 tomorrow or the day after.
---
What platform are you on?
---
iou beer or you have been insulted notes. great to drop for the best and worst people in game
---
* pushes the big shiny red button with a skull on it *
---
82, hoping to hit 85 today after the patch
---
Your telling me dude, I said in another post that I was proud but I can't wait for a break for a while as I found playing every day has lead me to feeling more burned out then usual with it?
---
Your more then welcome dude
---
I dunno why people are downvoting you. A taxidermy gorilla in the middle of Appalachia doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But then again I also think they're a funny novelty piece of furniture to keep in my camp.
---
Yeah your right that was some good old fashioned karma right there - but I soooooo still want one lol
---
Of course it could be really lated to something other than Beth's Servers. 
---
...but that would ruin the 'hate everything 76'vibe so ignore the above.
---
Welcome to fallout 76! 
---
I see you getting used to how things work...
---
The survival tent came from a suggestion on this forum as well.
---
Kill a 3 star “creature”, a robot or human won’t count.
---
Yep, PC as well.
---
[R/halo](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)  has meme saturdays any other day you post a meme its taken down but your still allowed normal pics during the other days

Hey guys 👋. Just dropping in to see if the servers were back up.
---
Congratulations dude!! We are hoping to finish it today. We have saved up ATOM for ages and just want to chill from it. I want the planetarium thing and  ths fireplace door
---
I had no problems killing a 3\* glowing ghoul on Radiation Rumble.
---
Nuka what now?
---
I’m on PC, but I haven’t had that issue. The only thing I’ve really noticed was I had a really weird issue with public groups last night where it took forever for the server to update group statuses (things like me joining, leaving, or creating groups)

my quad explosive ultracite laser rifle gets some time on a gun rack at least

Ya, just the silo tape. Now if I could just drop the 50 hornwright cards and all the extras keys I got and get 1 wastland master key.
---
So, it's a cumulative 150,000 right? Like, is that per device type or overall across consoles and PC?
---
Canonical, we are immune cause we made an inoculation and got lucky. We aren't immune because we are Vaulters.
---
Also the Responders *did* discover it was a plague, but never finished the inoculation before they got wiped out. We just completed their work.
---
The people returning are the people that fled the Scorched before it got too bad. Sometime after the dam blew and before Fort Defiant fell.
---
&gt;You need to add a bar that shows how close you are to leveling, so you can pick the character you want to chase daily challenges with more easily.
---
Good shout, I'll see if I can edit in when I'm at home. :)
---
What did you kill?  Did you tag it or deliver the death stoke?
---
Hi, i would like to add something too. Im not sure if its rly a bug, but i guess so. Also i didn't hear anyone mention it ever. But i have a Quad Crossbow on one char that can shoot more than the loaded 4 bolts in vats if you hit the fire button fast enough.
---
Flaming bag of crap 💩
---
They did give us the correct ones. You just didn't read it. It says to kill a 3* creature. Not a robot. Not a human.
---
The planetarium is nice.  I liked the wallpapers earlier on.  As far as the later stuff goes I'm getting alot of use out of the PA skins.  Best of luck!
---
The ape council has spoken.
---
Nah Oblivion and Skyrim it is held in the left hand. Can't say for Morrowind. But it is 100% in the left hand. Load it up an check.

[https://nukacrypt.com](https://nukacrypt.com)
---
&gt; Bethesda servers can't handle unlimited F1st's stashes anymore so they've decide to get rid of most of them with this event. 
---
Very unlikely.  I have to assume in a database, this is nothing more then:
---
Item Id, Qty.
---
There is no uniqueness to them.  They are all the same thing.  Copies.  So it's just a qty.  
---
In the past (15 years ago) games would sometimes hit an issue on the max int size ( 2,147,483,647).  
---
Now - if you told me the "unlimited" have to have a cap at - per item, under 2billion due to this, I'd understand.
---
But 2500 vs. 500k?  There is no way it should make a difference
---
Homemade at level 15 and 25
---
Gauss Shotgun reflex sight is misaligned as well
---
There’s no reason an individual can’t play both sides. As an independent operator, you may think of me as your ally, but our partnership lasts only so long as it is beneficial to *me*.
---
The term ‘ally’ is probably not the most accurate for Bethesda to use in this situation, but it suffices.
---
Me! i have been shooting cars and trucks literally whenever i pass by them. 1stly, can't resist the see the chain explosion if you hit the right one first. 2ndly, to 'wake up' any creatures nearby so I can shoot them and earn some bit of XP.

Not nice, he was one of the best companions I ever had :(

Oooh yeah, good shout
---
2200 and 3450, actually.
---
I didn’t say they couldn’t play both sides. 
---
I said it’s a shame we can get to ally already. It’s good have stopped earlier so later on you could have new missions to increase your rep.
---
75.
---
I feel like in all of Fallout history the brotherhood chapters have always been either far left or far right— too concerned with fighting other people’s battles that they forget about the real reason the brotherhood was created, or so obsessed with hoarding technology they forget about humanity. 
---
The BOS in Appalachia— the OG’s— were a perfect balance. They wanted to help everyone, and even asked for their help because they understood the threat. But what did they get? No from the Free States due to political crap. No from the Fire Breathers and Responders for personal crap. No from the enclave because — well, F the enclave. 
---
They did what they had to do to save humanity as a whole. It wasn’t their fault Appalachia’s slice of humans couldn’t see the big picture. 
---
I look forward to their return. With their backing we can make Appalachia a center for human growth and prosperity. One fetch quest a day at a time.
---
SBQ does count, maybe she didn't do enough damage to it.
---
Those are creatures, not humans or robots.
---
Exactly, going out of your way to do dumb challenges like finding certain food and killing certain enemies burns you out a lot. I wish if daily challenges were stuff you will do while playing instead, like killing a certain number of enemies or consuming a certain amount of chems/food regardless of what they are
---
&gt;I hope OP isn’t downvoting just because s/he doesn’t like the answer.
---
that's reddit in a nutshell isn't it?
---
The Queen did it for me.
---
Ho lee fukkkkkkkkk ty
---
i can craft some fixer for you (ps4)
---
That's possible, she doesn't seem to get any flux from fighting her either but she used a gauss shotgun
---
You're lucky if they just want to get a hit on the 3 star in riding shotgun. I have a TSE 10mm for tagging stuff and some guy in a fixer sprinted past and one shot it.
---
Fine, I just threw a couple explosive baits down and left when the Brahmins died. I also had to put my Peter armor down to block his shots trying to protect the Brahmin. It's really hard to fail this event. I Server hopped and triggered the event again
---
I googled "pregnant goldfish", didnt find anything except how to find out if my goldfish is pregnant... I an imagine what you mean, but oh the other hand I might be totally wrong.
---
77
---
Unless I’m doing something wrong but the Medics legendary effect also isn’t working. Like at all. So much for role playing as a Reaponders combat medic.
---
I'm at 75 right now.
---
because it is an endless glut of poorly edited lol quality images lifted from other forums and reposted with some nominal reference to Fallout.
---
No thanks.
---
 DIE RAIDER SCUM!!
---
a bit of rowdiness can be good for the soul!
---
To the Brotherhood XDDDD
---
Says it has a chance to duplicate ANY item you craft, makes the noise when you craft legendaries, even shows the icon, doesn't duplicate. 
---
Bethesda are LIARS... sometimes.
---
The silos seem weirdly unstable to me. This happens quitr often. I'll get the server not responding error as I'm typing in the keycode or accessing the launch map
---
One of my best memories of NW with my mostly passive camp building strategy was having an overly aggressive group of players come assault my 3 piece blue print cliff side base. Once they were all far enough on board and blown through most of my honeycomb walls I yeeted myself off the ledge. Of course my goat legs negated all the fall damaged and I quickly threw down my CAMP again cauzing the would be aggressors to fall to their deaths. I got so many hate messages from them about how I wasn't playing the game right and other vulgarities. Best feeling in the world.
---
SBQ counted for me personally
---
We're Amish
---
It’s a TW@T
---
I feel so stupid right now
---
No, some people just like to be alone. Many others think they do.
---
&gt; You also have Super Duper III, and Y can be Super Dupered.
---
If you're crafting, the card says *anything*... even though it's a lie.
---
Fully done, about - 2 days ago..... did spend some points for 10 spots in which 3 of them were free (+150 atoms) and in retrospect i wouldnt had to use any at all and also some of those rewards were un-usable by default as they are only a re-skins of some of the rarer pieces of armor anyway..... and still have nearly 11k atoms left.
---
I trash all the gminis, ss and gauntlets that didnt make the cut....so much wasted scrip : /
---
It’s not going to happen because they are introducing it with Legendary perks.
---
I see 1% of monkeyhaters in the chat!!
---
Nope. It really needs at least 2 people running ore. I find solo clearing all 4 areas comes to about 40 ore then you're stuck waiting on respawns that are painfully slow. I suspect it's intentional to stop people soloing it.
---
68 or 69 I think. I'm ahead of zorbo after not playing for 2 weeks so should be possible to reach the end
---
Yeah, I have saved atoms in case I don't get there. But, with how far I am through I expect to reach the end without spending atoms... But, they are there in case I can't be bothered haha
---
Bethesda bad, 20% wifi signal good
---
I'd like to see that.
---
Today a new event is supposed to come in, "A Colossal Problem"
---
Thank you for the info!
---
You are doing everything right. At most one person can get barely above 50 ore. 2 person job minimum on ore to have a chance at rad barrel
---
seen that as well and the whole thing with unloading a clip into a super mutant just to have it re gain all of it's health.
---
Where is the Insult Bot?
---
We call him God Howard and he blessed us with purchasable Todd-coins.
---
Well, you're covered, for the (at minimum) next 18 days :D
---
Also FYI, a guy at Wayward sells I think 300 or 400 bullion more, weekly, for caps.
---
:)
---
*tips hat* finally, men of culture.
---
No your doing great. Was on it today and collecting ore whilst everyone sat XP farming. I knew there wasn't a lot of scorchbeasts happening so I saved ore until last min then put it in furnace and ran down to radiated zone to slap the two 3* deathclaws before any of the useless cunts camped upstairs farming could even blink. The anger was well received 😂.
---
&gt; Nah, I'm usually the first to criticise Bugthesda but that sounds pretty implausible. It should take no more resources or code to handle 1 billion units of steel scrap, than half a dozen. This event is just their attempt at successful server-wide events in other platforms.
---
The more likely answer is they have new stuff coming, and want to burn down stashes.
---
For example - the buildable bunkers (on the roadmap).  It mentions they'll be instanced.  My guess is this is their ability to give players more ability to build, while not affecting the outside server.  (the fact player buildings can take damage - for example, likely is why they have to limit buildings so much.  If it's instanced?  Maybe we can expand more).
---
One way they might do it - if you think about expanding a bunker;  and you have an automated robot to do it, but you need to feed it material:
---
Room 1 - 1,000 steel, and ... other materials (but not listing it all)
---
Room 2, 5,000 steel
---
Room 3, 20,000 steel
---
Room 4, 50,000 steel
---
So they do this first - to burn through reserves ?
---
BOS? That was covered in the post
---
OG version 
---
https://youtu.be/I2KUPiVmajs
---
Don't make me downvote you, mister.
---
ah good to know they've acknowledge the bug.
---
You were thinking of the wendigo colossus... you'll be facing Earl in this new event. He isnt a normal wendigo colossus....he is a boss level wendigo colossus. My tanky then the queen. Be careful.
---
Sounds like they should turn it into a random roll per unit. Might be more processing, but just have a 1/3 chance to proc each unit or a base multiplier. *shrug*
---
okay thanks for this. i seriously never seen that tip.
---
come on, they have to shoe-horn in some more pay-to-win boondoggles somehow!
---
Fallout 76 is a fantastic game with no bugs or glitches so far. /s
---
One red button says nuke the dirtbag junkie.
---
One red button says nuke the cannibal.
---
^(#whichbuttondoyoupressmeme)
---
I'm just behind you and I'm worried I'll have to spend atoms. I started playing in early July so I was behind the curve from the beginning.
---
Responder filth I’ll make sure to eat your eyes first !
---
until tomorrow when you rage-quit destiny again?
---
The required addon, SFE, doesnt work for the gamepass version of the game tho
---
I'm pretty sure one does fall down after the heist but it makes sense why neither side attack after the heist the foundation simply doesn't do that the raiders if they attacked a vault dweller they would have the rest of the dwellers and foundation after them and since the dwellers have access to nukes...
---
You'll just get added to the next 8
---
Thats a massive need for me, an instant buy.
---
Get back under your disgusting rock.
---
Big iron
---
Hate to say it, but I don't think so. They would have to update all the existing locations like foundation and crater and quest and dialogue and prop a bunch of stuff I'm not even aware of. I would like if they did, I liked how wastlanders made the world not feel static.
---
Idk, I'd like to collect my best glitches and visual bugs which are often very disturbing. Also, there is a nude mod which could send NSFW pics out to people who don't like to see stuff like that.
---
Honestly I wish there was a button on my keyboard that would allow me to slap someone through the internet.
---
No I am I just googled it and it turns out respectable dictionaries don’t use that word and besides gold fish don’t get pregnant as they lay eggs, I’ve just always used it like others here in Scotland when we really want to call someone a derogatory lady part but can’t lol
---
It does seem like the game has been particularly unstable of late, at least for me, but any sort of server instability is likely to be downstream of Bethesda itself. Unless one of their coders was trying to "fix" something, in which case, Zeus preserve us.
---
The shotgun damage rubber banding is related to "magic shotguns" (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4) ). Shotguns are actually very weak, and the damage you see with rubber banding, that is, after it "heals", is the correct damage. Some armor and weapon legendary effects cause VATs to deal much higher damage with shotguns. The rubber banding you see is the difference between the  "incorrect" damage in VATs and the actual damage the weapon is intended to do. In other words, this bug needs to be fixed and shotguns need a massive buff.
---
Or Big Mtn since the CDC is in Atlanta
---
I take it the Hazmat suit would probably be level 4 rewards?
---
I’m sorry, but personally, I despise the camp system. There is no reason for there to be so many limitations on the system. If people want to build it as weird as they want, they should be able to! They can’t really say that having a floating camp is an issue when 90% of the time when you go to cranberry bog there’s like three tents 30 feet in the air.
---
I will say one thing, 76 isn’t half bad when it comes to weapon variety.
---
73 and rising
---
The Captain is not a creature and doesn't count.
---
I'm level 360 and I have over 300 perk cards I don't use. I was looking forward to the ability to get rid of cards more than I was Legendary perks.
---
Meanwhile the Enclave is sitting there and thinking: "Oh boy, what fun mass genocide project will we fuck up and mishandle this weekend!"
---
I think a little part of me died with that comment.
---
Yup, it's killing us because it's PURE rng.  There's no loot progression, only RNG.  You don't work towards loot, you are just as far away now from the drop you want as you were when you started.
---
Ahahahah lmao
---
It's difficult with just one ore runner because you either find you can't run quickly enough, or you inadvertently run the same paths and have to wait for respawns. 
---
You need to religiously swap ends each time, jump behind barrels, search the side tunnels, all without pause or looking in the same place twice, and even then you'll probably fall short of doing it alone. 
---
The simple truth is the event was intended as a team collection exercise with the aim to win Treasury Notes, and it was expected that there would be multiple runners. Instead during the Legendary Run it has morphed in to a stand still-kill-xp arena and your lucky if anyone collects anything.
---
That's a b.s. technicality and you know it.  I get what you are saying. And it's still b.s.
---
I did scorched earth last night and we killed the Queen..I’m pretty sure she is 95 3 star legendary but I didn’t get credit. I was able to loot her and def for some shots in
---
Cosmetically, it looks really good with the matching SS armor.  Especially with the new camo skin from the shop.
---
Functionally, probably not worth it.
---
&gt;This leads to large amounts of cores with 1-5% charge taking up inventory space, and makes it look like you are not using ammo.
---
I wish we could get a "Core Consolidation Unit" CAMP object that lets you insert partially depleted plasma and fusion cores and returns to you less, but fully charged, cores. 
---
Then I look at the ammo converter and can picture in my head the Monkey's Paw version of this wish being fulfilled, where you insert 1 core into the machine, walk over to a terminal, go through 3 screens to convert the core into "Core Cash", then rinse and repeat until you have enough CC to purchase a fully filled core, at a rate so abysmal you'd be better off just throwing low charge cores on the ground and skipping the machine entirely.
---
ITS pretty much the only real benefit of Herbivore over Carnivore. The cranberry recipes are so much easier to farm mats for than the squirrel stew.
---
&gt; It’s a shame we can get to ally already. 
---
&gt; The term ‘ally’ is probably not the most accurate for Bethesda to use in this situation, but it suffices.
---
I know what you said. Which is why I said the part that *I* did. 
---
The semantics are a bit off.  ‘Trusted’ might have worked better.
---
Oh, it is in the right for Morrowind I know that so I must have misremembered for the other two then. So I guess they can put bows in the left hand lol.
---
To add a bit to this from personal experience, the reflex sight on the Gauss Shotgun is slightly misaligned to the left. The dot is slightly left of where the iron sight is. It's not terrible, but it's still there an bothers me lol
---
The only thing that would make it better is if each one had a typewriter placed in front.
---
There is also the bug with the favorites wheel and multiples of the same kind of weapon. I carry 3 handmades and have to redo them on the favorite wheel not every time, as they get removed from the wheel.
---
The bigger benefit for carnivore is the pepperoni roll. With carnivore and strange in numbers it gives you +75 carry weight. Only food I actively farm as IMHO carry weight has way more of an effect on QOL than leveling slightly faster.
---
I do this as well if nobody else farms. Those legendary beasts are my reward for helping everyone else get their XP and treasury notes :)
---
Outcasts 4ever
---
I drop them everytime I get one. I think I get at least 1 or 2 from the queen and nobody will buy them in my vendor even for like 25 caps
---
Could be worse. Could be the WoW sub where 70+ percent of the posts are garbage art posts of any and every thing with cleavage.
---
same, i sell the shielded casual for 500 and they go right away
---
How do you trigger Riding Shotgun?
---
Not exactly. You can have multiple food buffs, just not two of the same exact buff (with the exception of melee damage because that's bugged and can be stacked). For example, you can have a food that increases carry weight and one that increases strength, both of which will increase your carry weight. But if you eat another food with carry weight, it will only give you whichever is higher. If you learn the right combos of food, this can be really powerful and is how people with Deathclaw Gauntlets can solo the queen really quickly. There are also a few exceptions to the rule where they can be stacked, like Nukashine stacks with other alcohol and X-cell and overdrive can stack with other chems if you take them first. Also, don't forget bobbleheads and magazines, you can have one of each active.
---
Easiest way to get it is to have a friend drop the nuke on you. I’ve helped a few people get the trophy.
---
I'm not saying it's not valid(unless your making that demand as a PC player) but at this point after hundreds of top page posts for the same things constantly, I think Bethesda get the picture, they just are not capable or willing to make a lot of these highly requested (and often very simple PC mods)  things happen
---
I’ve never played destiny
---
Well I’m a moron and sold all mine.
---
A radge?!
---
Somewhere around 70? I haven't really tried too hard - just done the daily and weeklies and if there was an easy nuclear winter one I'd do that but I haven't grinded exp at all other than to level up.
---
Because the mods pulled a “typical chickenshit commie maneuver” as said by Mister Gutsy /s
---
Dicks out for Harambe
---
You went from 74 to 85 in 20 minutes?
---
Yes, should’VE
---
Display units have always had higher CAMP space usage. This is just a static decoration.
---
there are mods on this sub?
---
Lol no derogatory lady parts beginning with T
---
Lmfao
---
It's sad and funny that you need to insult me again for my request of an absolute common feature on reddit.
---
It sounds implausible until I think of how many other implausible problems there are with the game.  If there's a way to make it somehow take more storage to store something that should just be a single big integer, I'm sure they found it.
---
16h GMT+1 downtime starts
---
Gonna get the chicken coop today.
---
Where did you have to go in the mansion to start the quest? I fear I can't do this quest at all
---
Jfc Bethesda, play test your game
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
SBQ will do the trick if you hit the damage threshold. This can be tricky depending on who's SBQ event you wind up in though... there are teams out there that have her dead on her first landing which can be within the first minute of the event
---
Another one regarding the pipe revolver that i have encountered on two characters now. Equipping either of the rifle stocks and favoriting and equipping the weapon causes the rest of your favorited weapons to bug out and default to barehanded melee attacks when trying to select any weapon other than the revolver rifle. None of the other mods on the weapon seem to matter. And putting any pistol grip back on the gun immediately fixes the issue.
---
The only other consistencies between the two chars are that they are both wearing regular gas masks and the tattered +1 perception dress.  Perks dont seem to matter. Armor doesnt seem to matter.
---
i'd rather come here to see seventeen people post about how unfair the score system is and how we need camp budget increased
---
95.    
---
XP food and lunch boxes. High int due to unyielding armour. Did some grinding but its mostly been just doing dailies and events that give good XP.
---
I’d rather get the missiles from the ammo converter
---
The event failed too so they couldn't even protect workers. FML. I got 3 legendarys anyway.
---
Do you know what that threshold is?
---
yet another story about xbox..hey microsoft if you could "Git Gud" and stop this shit from happening instead of just jamming the game pass and gold down peoples throats that'd be epic thanks
---
while your at it please stop banning the accounts i made that i never play on..they just exist so i can pt gold on them cuz for some reason you ont let me put gold on my main acc..customer support told me to buy another gold card..which..yknow..i cant use so yeah taht'd also be cool thanks in advance microsooooohhh you wont fix this anyway wtf am i doing
---
I don't want to say its easy. I mean, many ppl maybe don't have as much playtime as others. But then again, im doing the grind on two accounts and be mostly thru with both in an hour.
---
If there's a way to do it wrong, I'm sure Bethesda found it.  I mean, there are ways to do it wrong, I can't imagine WHY anyone would do it those ways, but that could be said of a lot of the problems in the game.
---
Ape not kill ape
---
75% of this sub is the same low effort retired topics posted over and over again the mods basically don't exist
---
After you complete The Overseer's Mission, transfer the holotapes to an alt.  
---
You'll see.
---
Yup, game subs that allow images (aside from images along the lines of "I encountered this bug, here are screenshots along with my text post to explain" quickly turn into low effort trash.
---
Similar weapons will also break hot swapping on Xbox. I had two TS weapons and the game would swap between one of them and my fists. The same thing occurred when I had two Levers.
---
Started about 3 weeks late and im 65, min maxed xp and skyrocketed up to this weeks goal so now i can chill and just do dailies instead of grinding xp
---
Read your statement. You start off saying there’s no reason someone can’t play both sides. Your statement is a reply to me.
---
I never said anything along the lines of that.
---
They should have had us get to cautious or neutral at the most. So that way they could expand on it later to allow you to progress with new missions and quests.
---
instead of an endless glut of 'game is broken AF literally unplayable' 'atom prices are too high' 'we never get new content' 'i got haxored bethesda is teh sukk'
---
I can confirm that 3* SB exist - I encountered a pair of them over the weekend in the bog. I managed to grab a couple of screen pics (let me tell you that is REALLY not easy on xbox in the middle of a fight trying to keep the crosshair on them to show the 3* then hit the buttons necessary to grab a pic...yeesh).
---
Unless they only spawn as part of a special event or something, however I was just wandering across from Bog to the quarry site (x-3? the big one north of Watoga with the Mirelurk queen).
---
If needed I can try and get them from my Xbox to show, but there was definitely 2 3* legendary SB.
---
Last I checked, America is still a big smoking crater getting gangbanged by ghouls and raiders.
---
The people never had the Brotherhood.
---
The people need no Brotherhood.
---
A lot of those posts get removed, especially if they are reported. 
---
Are you trying to say we should turn the sub into meme central?
---
I'm on PS4 I thought it was a problem with my wifi. But yep it has been the same for me. Checked the connection on the ps4 is was still working has to be the game.
---
This is our Appalachia.
---
I was thinking the other day that it would be nice to have an NPC in the game that would remake legendaries. Like you give it a legendary weapon plus, say, 250-500 scrip, and it will give you the same weapon with different legendary attributes. The only constants are the weapon itself and the number of stars.
---
I honestly got my second good drop out of 564 hours. The first one is the ** Instigating Lever Action Rifle and and a *** handmade.
---
I've been using the Instigating for the longest time sense it hits pretty hard while in stealth.
---
“It just works” happened way too many times to me
---
There's not much need.
---
Outfit pictures would be largely pointless, because there aren't that many cosmetics in the game, there aren't enough slots to create a real mixed look, and there's no option to dye items.  So, you'd basically just be seeing what you can see by looking at the outfits on the wiki.
---
CAMPS allow for creativity and cool screenshots, but there are subs for that if you want to go check them out.
---
Meme images ruin subs.  They become the dominant post, and discussion is drowned out.
---
There's not much left after that other than "Look at this cool view I found", and like with camp images that's something best found on a dedicated sub.
---
I have a portable camp with a vending machine in a 1x1 structure.
---
Serios-fucking-ly. I hear a nuke siren and in my rush, always forget SOMETHING, most likely PERK loadouts. I don't snipe unless I'm in Whitesprings, don't wear PA most of the time, and forget about CAMP building, they fuck me up every time. There are cards I never take off because I know those will screw me up.
---
83. I generally go up by 1 now every day. According to my calculations I'll finish in about 13 days.
---
They are dropping today with update 21
---
Was it a “creature”
---
Uh... probably the biggest bug in the game that Gauss Shotgun randomly after shooting will go into a mode where you cannot use hotkeys, run, reload or do much of anything other than sheathe it.
---
They are not though.
---
Run the silo again.   You will likely find that your keycard is still there.  Every now and again I will run a silo before my cool down is complete and it will take my keycard but will not let me launch.   
---
When my cool down has expired I can run the silo again and when I try to enter another keycard it says it’s already there.   
---
It’s not the exact situation but may work.
---
They have been very clear saying that legendary perks are not coming with update 21
---

Not entirely sure of an exact damage number, nor do I know if there is a way to verify if you've reached the threshold or not in game. 
---
I've taken to carrying around a reduced weight primed LMG that does enough damage in a clip or two once she lands. I get my damage on her and then spend the rest of the time cleaning up the groundlings for more XP.
---
But storing it doesn't save what's in your vending :(
---
The chicken coop. 78?

Also please make it so arrows stick out of enemies, and you can pick them up after, it looks so stupid seeing your arrow disappear into someone like a bullet

Ppl who have been playing on the PTS and datatmine the information.

We are portable vending machines if you think about it! LOL
---
I like the billboard near the monorail station and a few broken cars along the tracks in Cranberry Bog. Personally, I love figuring ways to run power in weird ways.  Also, there's a lake in the Mire that has some awesome spots around it.
---
I use heavy weapons as well and I land a crap ton of shots, she won't get a shot until it lands but may get her a heavy weapon for such situations
---
Beth has farmed maintenance of fo76 to some small dev studio. Its clear that 76 isnt much a of a priority these days. Its supremely unlikely that The Todd would acquiesce to giving away a bunch of money to Sony just so a handful of people could group together.
---
What does he even do? Guys a penis
---
There are other times in the game when you need to kill creatures. This isn’t the first time.
---
Tech data hole now protected with cork.
---
One of the things I discovered was that the order in which you place objects matters a lot. Also, sometimes if you exit and go back into the build system, objects that should snap but wouldn't will suddenly snap.
---
Yes, you did. You may not have meant to, but what you said had such implications. 
---
&gt; Raider and Settler Rep maybe shouldn't have gone up to ally.
---
&gt; I think they made a mistake allowing us to get to ally with the ***two*** sides. 
---
Getting to Ally implies you are highly trusted. If there are two opposing sides, getting to Ally with both seems inherently odd.
---
The only way to sensibly do it is with a team of 4 and the usual organised merry-go round of defending and collecting and THEN deposit 99 to get maxed spawns with two of the team at either end and final deposit in the last 20 seconds. Worked a charm on double XP weekend, although I think Line in the Sand was better.
---
Which is crazy because I've seen a base with every magazine and bobblehead on display with tons of other stuff.  How do people do that when I'm scrapping defenses just for new doodads?
---
I did not know this was possible. This was very informative.
---
Whats wrong with the lever action ive literally never used it
---
Fair point. Why spend the time and effort fleshing out some new and interesting factions when the can just dust off the shitty bland military dudes again I suppose. 
---
Honestly I much preferred them being isolationist assholes instead of the obvious one dimensional garbage we got in the last few games.
---
There are individual awards as well as the community one. What they are exactly and their value to non-BoS Fanboys is still open to debate.
---
Not even close. You misread it it. And like a typical reddit can’t say oops I was wrong.
---
Yes it does. 
---
Just move your camp. It will pack up everything into the stored tab as a blueprint. When you place the blueprinted structure all of your stuff will stay in your vendor. 
---
I do this daily. Trust me.
---
Damn I need this sort of tastiness first thing this morning. Hell, I'm not even going to debate the differences between the Appalachian Brotherhood and the OG's from out west.

Simple fact is, Overseer says we gotta all work together. Before the Vault opened up everybody kept to their selves, didn't want to take the risk of sharing resources, letting other people in. And I get why. Civilization burned down and once you've been burned, it's hard to trust again, to heal that broken heart.
---
I'm choosing to try. I'm going to see what happens when we work together, maybe get a pretty new hat, or make a new robot friend. In Appalachia, we have to be grateful for the chances we have to begin again.
---
Right? At this point liberty prime is still inoperable so hard to tell who's gonna be the least useful, ward cant be bothered to pick up an osmosis kit 40 feet from him and the bos can't survive without their robot
---
You pick the building system there? I really don't know mate. I mean, its one of my favorite activities in the game as well. But with all those placement errors you almost need a diploma in camp building to always find your way around said bugs.
---
But now that i comment and think about it i notice its also loads of fun finding those tricks. So actually... nvm. Its my pick as well lol
---
Do it, you’d have my support
---
KILL
---
im interested to know what the "rare plans" that will be given out will be, afaik nobody has datamined that list yet
---
If the worst should happen, and we dont survive, tell my wife... hello.
---
EVERYTHING
---
He sleeps. He used to sleep a lot. Now he likes glitching out in his office chair or sitting on top of the cooking spit. Ol’ Ward....he ain’t quite right.
---
Really? Has to be a CAMP movement though doesn't it? Anytime I store a Vending when I'm close to max caps, I have reassign everything.
---
Ok that was always allowed.
---
I'm a bit of a minimalist myself, so stick to 4 weapons total. Everything else gets stripped or sold.
---
1. Switchblade. Level 20, crafted, no mods, for hitting legendaries and not killing them.
---
2. Deathclaw Gauntlet, armour ignoring buff. I only have 6 strength, Martial Art and Incisor perks, and I have most mutations. At max health, I kill most things with ease. Bloodied not required. 
---
3. All Rise. Super lightweight and smashing things with a hammer is fun.
---
4. M79 grenade launcher. Exclusively for those bugged Fort Defiance events. Boom!
---
It doesn’t really fit well with any outfits I’ve been able to find, but with the full SS set it’s really nice. I always wear a mining helmet and pathfinder mask to get the filter and light functions, but the SS helm has both, which is very nice.
---
Honestly? Overpriced is an understatement, but if you’ve got lost of what you want then it’s not bad.
---
He’s gotten you to do all his work. Doesn’t seem so incompetent to me.
---
I've heard that they are 1:1. So theoretically you could measure your CAMP budget in apes. But measuring in flamingos is normal and measuring in apes is just crazy.
---

---
They draw from the holiday scorched and treasure hunter loot pool, so it's not anything new. The only thing worth really going for are the first two tier rewards for the community efforty.
---
I can't experience it or stream it until tomorrow. The update goes live when I am at work, but it will be a nice thing to look forward to.
---
Nah, he's watched me sell his stuff to raiders
---
How do you get 1K xp? I get about 500-600 for the levle 60 sentries. 
---
I still kill them every time. If you do it quick enough, the other bots don't turn hostile.
---
If you wanna get drunk, take a shot everytime you successfully move from 1 bush to another, see a player run by you without engaging in combat, or you die
---
They take the same amount. But I doubt you can fit 500 harambes on one plot. May be if you put them on top of each other.
---
&gt; My main point was that a non-legendary bow is way worse than a non-legendary anything else.
---
Seriously, how could you find the bow worse than the Gamma Gun? The Broadsider is better than a bow?
---
I have played the game since beta. (Enough that I was able to get several 3* legendary bows. I'm more persistent than lucky.)  I've tried a bunch of different ranged builds and weapons. Non-legendary bows are way better than a lot of the ranged non-legendary weapons in the game. I admit total ignorance about melee weapons in FO76, but when compared to ranged weapons, and assuming you don't use VATS, or can work around the VATS bug, the non-legendary bow is better than non-legendary:
---
All the explosive weapons.
---
All the firearm type pistols with the exception of the Western revolver and maybe the 10mm in full auto.
---
All the shotguns.
---
Shit, it's easier to just list what it's worse than:
---
The Bow is worse than:
---
Most non-explosive non-energy heavy weapons (not the broadsider). 
---
The Lever gun 
---
The Handmade
---
The Gauss Rifle (but it suffers the same VATS bug)
---
Maybe the Assault Rifle. Maybe.
---
The Laser Gatling (barely).
---
I haven't used the new gauss shotgun/pistol/minigun, so I can't speak to those. I understand that some of them have the same VATS issue
---
I'm not counting uniques (Fixer, etc)... those are still legendary.
---
Bows are natively silent. They weigh next to nothing. They can be configured with several different damage types on demand, guaranteed. Try making a plasma 10mm or explosive lever gun on demand. Before I managed to score my legendary bows I used to carry a regular plasma recurve and a regular explosive recurve with a combined weight of less than any one rifle. I briefly entertained shelling out the caps for the cryro and flame bow plans so I could be Wastland Hawkeye with 4 recurve bows with a combined total weight less than a suppressed rifle.
---
When you isolate that singular experience, sure. I have read hundreds of accounts very similar to this one.
---
I dunno if this is all terrible since they can’t be pissed to fix it, or genius since everything is fucked up and broken like one would expect in a nuclear apocalypse.
---
Anyways, I’m gonna shotgun some more supermutants in the dick.
---
Talk to the guy in the suit outside. I've felt like this was my best kept secret for a while
---
Perfectly balanced
---
I know what you meant after you corrected yourself. So why you think ‘I still don’t get it’ is ridiculous. 
---
‘Getting to Ally with both sides’ is different from ‘Getting to Ally with either side’.
---
he just sits around and lies about how many osmosis kits are left.
---
I have had a lot of issues with server disconnection lately
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3i1xy/getting\_kicked\_off\_the\_server\_about\_ev](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3i1xy/getting_kicked_off_the_server_about_ev)
---
no, i'm not. i was exaggerating a bit, but for an 'official' subreddit i see virtually no moderation in action. bethesda plz and wildly inaccurate conspiracy theories are regularly in the top posts
---
That’s ridiculous! They really need to increase the drop rate even by a little bit, then all my ammo wont be lost in vain or make it so 3* drop 3* anything and 2* drop 2* and 1* drop 1*
---
For next Fasnacht Beth better release a parade costume with a baton. I would just march in front of the parade with that. Maybe a “marching” emote as well since we already have robot dance and Mothman dance.
---
scorched are the animated half sapient carcasses of people whos bodies have been overtaken by the Blight and whos minds have been subsumed into the Scorched hive mind.
---
Yeah, creatures sounds about right.
---
Better off nuking something.
---
You forgot the bug where tesla rifles randomly break all ranged damage until the game is restarted. Pretty game breaking.
---
Perfect stormv cold case
---
Same. It's like a sick obsession. I had  post about CAMPs that can't be placed. It was a rant.
---
Isn't it basically an in-game BoS fanboy that's asking for Junk so that when the BoS comes back they have all the supplies they need? Not the BoS itself.
---
Well that's not ideal
---
I couldn't have said it any better myself. They're not getting any scrap from me AT ALL.
---
I'm looking for ammo for 1 cap per round, the few plans I don't have yet, and hoping against hope to find someone selling Stimpak diffusers so I can complete that darn Pioneer Scout challenge(because I don't see myself ever getting the plan from PP).
---
I actually found someone selling 3 stimpak diffusers the other day...for 30,000 caps each. Go ram 'em up your ass, dude.
---
If on XBox1, I think I have like 2or maybe even three full Ultracite set plans for sale, along with atleast a near full marine armor set (missing helmet)
---
You can't use Rad X or it will disable your mutations for the length of the Rad X dose. On top of max starched jeans, max class freak helps too. You get a lot of benefit from it.
---
The loot is somewhere just not anywhere you can find.  It's that arm piece three screens over
---
oh great another new currency
---
I feel like there will also be a bug where the challenge doesn't track or register, but killing scorched does track for that challenge
---
Ya, done it on 2 toons and none of them found a key. Dono if I am going into the room to early/late or what the problem is but have kinda figured i will never get the key on any of my toons.
---
THE FEZ!!! I N33Ds it!

My life is incomplete without it.

Thanksgiving shelf.

I already have plans for that one. (cue sinister laugh)

Of course it’s not just me…

I'll craft you some :) 
---
I guess the update is out today and Depending on the download size i might Not be able to Do it today, but just send me a friendsrequest and stop by IGN: "Dampfwalze."
---
He should be easier than the Queen. The SBQ has an additional 70% DI in addition to it's DR while Randal only has a 10% DI. 
---
So if you were to calculate your total damage after DR and ended up with 100, you'd only hit the Queen for 30 and Randal for 90.
---
Thats probably the door Im hoping for too.
---
Of the things I know exist by seeing them in game I want the Mr Pebbles backpack &amp; the thanksgiving display cabinets most
---
I would like that. I got a very amusing picture the other day when I spawned into someone's CAMP wearing the Sheepsquatch Mascot getup, and got trapped in their Collectron pod when the CAMP finished loading after I was there.
---
Don't just store, make a blueprint.
---
APEVENGERS, ASSEMBLE
---
And the Forest should and could have really great CAMPs, but they usually are not and the shops suck.
---
We always said a radge when I was young, a pregnant fish. Haha
---
I hit 77 yesterday. I've been hitting nearly every daily and weekly. I did skip like 4 or 5 NW daily challenges because the "gain an overseer level" is not appealing to me.
---
I also agree with this.
---
I played through this game mostly blind, followed the Overseers tapes, and was happy when I found her alive.
---
The fall of the Brotherhoods gang was also good.
---
Oooh, and I love the plucky Scooby-gang in the Wayward. Getting Polly a new body was a joy!
---
Bummer if only 9 people are interested in doing it, though.
---
Oh I didn’t even think about that. They could have used the trail as an explanation for all the settlers coming in to Virginia.
---
Brilliant love it 😂

 **Minigun**
---
* If you are using the weapon without any ammo (i.e a shredder barrel build), jumping will mess with the spin-up, either resetting it or just breaking it until you let go and spin-up again.
---
This also happens with the chainsaw.  Super annoying.  If you have the trigger down, and then jump it will keep working till you land and then it will spin up and down over and over till you release and hold again.  Makes the bog super annoying.
---
This post gave Todd Howard a boner
---
Join/Create a Public Building Team. Each point in INT gives you about 2-3% more XP.
---
Always participate in 'Feed the People' (and probably 'Tea Time' and 'Swarm of Suitors'). FTP especially is an easy event that people show up to and yields Canned Meat Stew which gives you 5% more XP for an hour (or is it 30min?) when consumed. The other two are just easy Events where you can basically hang out, put a few shots in yourself, and get the Event XP.
---
Also, 'Path of Enlightenment' is a good one. A very easy Event, also has a lot of participants, but you could probably solo it at your level. And the reward is an XP boost for 1 hours.
---
At least it's not like the Creation Club one in FO4. Something like 68 dr, no er or rr, and moving while stealth uses AP.
---
Maybe the idea is that since it's foreign, pre-war tech, we wouldn't be able to figure it out? I don't rightly know. 
---
Lemme ask you this, though: if we could wear clothes over it, should that disable the invisibility? I say no, because our backpacks still turn invisible, so why not other stuff over top?
---
Trash is the word your thinking of
---
Capital idea!
---
Gotcha, thanks.
---
I end up joining every group if I see no vendors on a team. 75% of the time, someone has a tent set up out there.
---
How do you get the BoS paint schemes for PA? Haven't seen any plans or unlocked any PA mods. I have full sets of all but Raider (not interested in) and T65 (still working on getting enough to buy the full set)
---
Oh dang, it took me a while to find one. Glad it worked out at west tek, all it had was 2 stars for me
---
Yep, BoS has long-range communications but we don’t seem to. So they most likely have no idea yet what’s waiting for them at Atlas. The fanboy is just hoping he gets into their ranks if he builds enough.
---
It’s clear anyone who is upset hasn’t played the game long enough anyways. I’m tired of dropping junk items because I don’t have the space to sell the next day. Whether the rewards are any good is another question...
---
Think it son a half hour
---
Wasteland Trapper outfit!! The skull mask... clean leather jacket and jeans and the poodle skirt.
---
Also some things that haven’t been released but that was datamined- that commie commander outfit would be great to have ASAP especially if they’d finally make available the plain fo3 looking version of the Chinese assault rifle skin.
---
One thing I noticed in that screen shot is they are flagged as “Unsellable” &amp; “NonPlayerTradable”.  I take it that means they are character locked now?
---
Out of curiosity, is there any combination of perks/armor/aid/etc to allow you to survive a direct hit?
---
I thought it was at reset?
---
Yeah I was pissed I hate when they do that shit and just leave the workshop to sit and do nothing. Like I get it if you want to farm items and then go do stuff, but just sitting there in your camp.
---
A complete overhaul.  
---
Basically more variety would be great. Now everybody PvP's in the same way. you might have a few minutes during which both sides fight with other weapons but after that, it's all teslarifle stealth boy berry mentats nuka quantum stacking.   
---
There is almost no real skill involved, which is a shame.
---
There are certain heavy weapon combos that are glitched (high fire rate ~200, or fire rate plus a major like limb damage, +33 vhc or bash) and cause way more damage than they should. I can verify that a Junkie's / limb damage / 90% rw LMG does much more damage than it should to the SBQ and allows me to hit my threshold in 1 or 2 clips on a non-heavy build
---
I saw on a YouTube that it’s the next patch
---
He legit wouldnt stop trying to invite me to a team after he went over to my base which was near the workshop and killed me. Fuck that guy
---
i feel you man. it would be hilarious if they just didn't show up if people didn't meet the arbitrary junk quota. this game has a lot of interesting stories going on if one bothers to read the terminals and notes and listen to the holotapes. but this is america so BIG GUN CASUAL COLONIALISM GUD READING IS FOR COMMIES
---
Says 10 am EST. In half hour
---
Believe its about 2k
---
What system are you on?
---
I'm on ps4, so if I find one, I'll hook you up. I *might* have one stashed away, but cannot confirm right now.
---
PSN is my handle here, minus the underscore.
---
“I’d rather use the ammo converter” has become my go to cynical remark for this game
---
Where's your best place to get Quantum?
---
At least you stayed relatively calm and did not go nuclear over it.
---
Brain bombs last around 1 and a 1/2 hours, scorchbeast brains last 30 minutes. Also sweetwater's special blend can be buffed to obscene amounts with herb + party + strange in numbers. Melee builds probably have a lot more to gai  from carnivore but otherwise I'd recommend herb.
---
Yeah tgats the other thing fuck the fact that other people can just kill me and take my junk like what?????
---
Lone wanderer will disable the moment you enter a group.
---
I loot her so quick in case mirelurk kings are hiding inside her model that its hard to tell lol.    Pretty sure I see (known) in there every time though.  
---
What I don't see in there after hundreds upon hundreds of fights though is "Calibrated shocks".  Damn thing has been impossible for me to get.
---
I’m not sure the broken once can be traded. But I have a few on my character. If you’re in pc let me know and I can try and give you one.
---
I love public events. I've levelled a second character to 60 by hunting to level 7, then just doing events. Nothing else. You get the occasional muppet, but the events are fun and everyone's really nice at them.
---
I was saving a second story play-through until she hit 50 so any levelled items I find were maxed (like the All Rise and Somerset Special). Just haven't gotten onto it yet.
---
I still say they increase spawns for some of this stuff when it involves a daily challenge. Like, right after I log in to see what the dailies are, I'm attacked by a random 3 star Legendary I wasn't actively hunting for.
---
This is why I always join public teams when I start a session. It’s the only think keeping me connected to that server. 
---
You can also go to your social tab and try joining one of the recent players from the server you were on. It can be a pain tho.
---
Or at least let him sell his usual wares to other players for some passive income.
---
i find new one's in tool box's  there are a few outside the whitespring bunker, and riding shotgun/ big bend tunnel have been generous to me
---
You know he's going to help. He just needed some attention this morning. 
---
Here you go. Nom nom nom eat it up.
---
I can see non-1st players not liking this, you can't really prep for it. I get a month of 1st, then 2-months off. I'm currently in the final week of one of my months, and I pick up and dump everything into my Stash Box. And I've been playing my melee character recently, so I've got a ton of stuff I absolutely will never need.
---
East Lothian HeHe.
---
I started playing just after release and have also played with Heavy gun explosive, as well as pistol builds, only used shotguns  until maybe level 30 with one character (so I can't judge any late game) and for all of that they were much stronger than the bow in my experience. Additionally I don't think it's really fair to compare to something like the broadsider, as it's a novelty weapon similar to black powder ones that is not its own entire category with perks specifically for it and neither is it fair to compare it to a radiation based niche weapon that only works on a small  amount of the mobs in the game in the first place.
---
If you don't agree that's that, we will likely not come to a consensus here. I am just thinking that the bows as an entire weapon category consisting of three weapons are very lacking compared to all other categories.
---
Level 72
---
I always enjoy a long-ass SBQ fight, using up tons of ammo and stimpacks, only to have NOTHING register as lootable on its corpse... no matter how many times or how long I look at it.
---
unfortunatly its untradable, i tried in the past and it gives you the message that it will destroy it when dropped (the raw material broken one)
---
"I don't know how people can say this with a straight face. How many times have we seen looter shooters/ARPGs rework their loot system to make it easier to get better drops?
---
Saddling players with unending streams of trash so a handful of items can feel, "special" does not keep most people on the hook for long. Even a game as big as Diablo 3 had to learn this lesson the hard way."
---
All of the Fallout series have been survival. You're exploring a post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland, surviving by scavenging and foraging. *It should be hard finding a good weapon in a desolate wasteland.* Why else would pipe weapons and makeshift weapons exist? 
---
Diablo 3's failure came when Jay Wilson decided to make it a money grab with the real money auction house. On top of features (pvp amongst other smaller aspects promised) promised that never made it in to the game.
---
As far as bloodied/junkie builds, that really depends on whether you want to follow meta, or actually try to play your own style, using what you find.
---
I think the real issue is everyone wants to scour forums and reddit trying to find the best builds, instead of just playing the damn game and figuring out what works best by yourself. Thats the challenge; that's what makes the game fun.
---
Fezes are cool
---
Bunny mask from Easter 2019
---
I just want to FUCKING DOWNGRADE SOME. I can't make a rank 2 adrenaline because it tries to upgrade the rank 3 I have for another load out.
---
Right. I actually thought he was going to be some sort of at base all time vendor but nuuupe. Itd be cool if they added either one of these things a feature. I know vendors come and go but itd be cool to have one at the base just for me lol.
---
I am doing it for the rewards. I look at it as someone is willing to pay me in better things for my junk than I usually get. Who else in this wasteland wants to buy cork?
---
at lvl 13 you want to be taking your time and relax with the game. seriously the leveling process is one of the most enjoyable part of fallout i can remember and following the two main story quests will get you in the right zones for questing and experience.
---
Alternate Universe: “Live with me if you want to come”
---
I wasn’t aware that was a thing, Imma need that as well.
---
This is what I'm interested to know too - a definitive list of what it is possible to get.
---
I personally mixed unarmed with the bow originally, which worked well and was fun but it just felt like I was hitting a brick wall when trying to do any damage late-game (with event-bosses that is) if I used the bow, which then got me to switch to rifles, so I can at least do some damage in those scenarios.
---
This was a dupe method, so they cut it off
---
I THREW IT ON THE GROOOOOUUUUUND
---
Right!!
---
These can neither be traded, sold, nor dropped so you'll have to find one yourself. Once you've acquired your first one they'll appear in random world containers. Just check every single container you come across, I typically find a couple a day.
---
I'd flood every single event with all nuka explosives. I want it.
---
Well if that's it I won't worry to much about it haha. Already have all of the plans. That's a bummer we arnt getting any cool bos plans
---
https://www.shacknews.com/article/119544/fallout-76-patch-21-teased-with-upcoming-fortifying-atlas-community-event

---
When’s the next double xp boss man called on me during the last one
---
You have already a really good tool for that problem
---
Stop playing solo to be able to reconnect easly
---
Well tbh I haven’t been doing a lot of questing.. Ive been building my base and exploring. I’m sure it’ll get old yeah, but every game inevitably does
---
I really do have a problem lol. Everytime I move it and rebuild my boyfriend is like “why do you do that to yourself?”
---
My life aches without a fez! I saw it was datamined a long time ago. But I was playing something else when it came out.
---
i doubt they would allow you to collect caps (even though i doubt it would be alot) But i would want this as well
---
Same thing here. Kept him alive, and Beckett says all three of us should meet back at camp. Got there but only Beckett was present. First he talks about a funeral but other further dialogue mentioned that he's staying at a nearby base with someone else. Got the Final Word, so just chalked it up to Bethesda being Bethesda, and my head-canon will just say he lived, and that's that.
---
I wonder if this screen could be a mod
---
Excellent list, thank you for taking the time and care in doing this
---
I'm going to assume it's the mole miner pail loot table until we know otherwise.
---
You could just try a different strategy. Adapt and overcome
---
What? I see tons of pictures on here. Shoot, just saw the gorilla camp picture before reading this one...
---
You shouldn’t worry about leveling up at all, just take it easy and do some quests
---
SFE is not required, it's optional
---
It does definitely feel like a big fucked up world
---
Thank you for your input. There’s no way I would’ve known all of those things as I just started, i’ll keep an eye out though!
---
The game isnt treating you differently than everyone else. You have the option to pick a perk card or to move **a** special point.
---
Same here lol
---
Luckily I use x01
---
That hazmat suit skin. My friend missed it so we've been looking for it since.
---
98. I had planned to slow down this last week but I ended up pressing on so I'll be finished tonight thanks to the weekly challenges. That'll clear the decks for doing some work on the ATLAS event and a bit of NW only because I want the BOS minigun paint but need another 8 levels to reach OR33.
---
Eh, cripple the legs and just keep unloading into their face while they lay there. Occasionally they might get up, but just shoot them in the knees again and then go back to the face.
---
Doesn’t matter. He had other osmosis kits.

If anything they're trying to clean out the dupers.

Heres a link just cuz I'm more bothered than I should be lol
---
Lol they should just build a giant paper mache fort out of all those mounted head plans.
---
No one is getting that on a daily basis; pretty exaggerated. 
---
Also, the more base weapon plans you know, the better variety you'll have at Murmrghs. And global drops, that's the luck of the draw.
---
Y'all need to look past god tier weapons and just play the game.
---
Patch days typically can be between 3-4 hours after it starts.  It can take longer if they run into issues or the overall patch has problems.  They don’t usually say when the end is, i always just go with 5 hours to be safe.
---
Here's hoping. I'm optimistic because it is slowing down  though it's not done and I might get hit with another arm of the hurricane. But as I said I'm optimistic. Though if I'm unable to kill the WC can someone kill him once for me
---
Why is this tagged nsfw?
---
Or... the challenge will say, kill 50 Wendingo Colossi, as plural, but it never register, because the monster name is Wendingo Colossus, not Colossi...
---
I just missed the Mothman Backpack a week or so ago! Gutted! I hope it comes back.

Well I had him since like day one. Was it that quick of a fix?
---
r/fo4 does it.

Sending positive vibes your way!

As long as it's balanced and you can only do one and stick to that one.
---
Division 2 has a similar system, but you get to choose what you change the effect.
---
Same XL

Hamilton lol
---
I mean, 31 caps is damn good for the rather efficient material cost to produce the helmets. 3 rubber, 1 glass, 1 plastic. You can get 11 plastic per laser rifle scrapped with Scrapper(and a lot of other stuff scraps into plastic), bottles are literally everywhere for glass, and hazmat suits/kickballs/basketballs/life preservers/extinguishers can be found for rubber in plentiful amounts if you know where to look. If I just want to get my 1400 caps as fast and painlessly as possible, I do the 1400 divided by 31 math, crank out that amount of the helmets, and call it a day. I'd much rather use Scrapper on those enemy weapons and bank loads of materials in my scrap box.
---
But you do you. To each his own.
---
IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS ME TO KICK THEIR ASS?
---
Your telling me
---
not a ridiculous idea, they're running everything they have through the atom shop too
---
it does feel a bit like they're trying to get everyone ready for a microtransaction state of mind, doesn't it
---
Yes please remove from the loot table.  Thank you.
---
Sure it does, the raiders have more caps but eventually he'll run out of osmosis kits if he keeps letting them be sold like that
---
No
---
There's a white door ive seen with flowers on it. Ive played for over a year and never seen it in the store but i want it.
---
With the Pump Action Shotgun Ive noticed that if you try to fire in VATS when your out of ammo, reloading will take you 5 times longer as it does the 'first shell' animation for all 8 shells. Hard to explain but anyone that's used to Pump Shotgun for 20 minutes could tell you about it.
---
The Mr Pebbles backpack. I’m still kicking myself for not getting it when I had the chance.
---
I think the estimate it would take 1400 levels to max out one Perk card should be enough to say the idea is garbage.
---
Amazing write up. Thanks for taking the time to do this.
---
It should be limited to basic Nuke-Cola flavors to avoid people spamming Nuka-Quantum
---
Yeah, that is likely it.
---
I love free range! Use to grind it a lot and now i just go to help others doing it and heal those poor cows.
---
Everything you requested here is what I’ve been begging for the past 3 months since I started playing lol
---
I'm beginning to think that staggering her while being  on the ground makes her take off as well. Saw it take off immediately after landing.
---
See I feel like the opposite. I’ve never gotten 1st and while I can’t prep for it I am a hoarder, so I constantly have 1k more steel than I can afford to have at a time and because of the cap on selling I can never offload all my junk fast enough. This event is just giving me a way to use the items I’d normally just be dropping in a train station somewhere. If I get some random plans then bonus.
---
BuT tHaT’s PaY tO wIn
---
Because it would make train station vendors useless
---
Now that is a good idea
---
all the past plushies, i would pay big for them
---
So, robots can make me sick and in the blast zones they give me radiated meat - so youre sure they are no creatures?
---
;-)
---
72.
---
1 free loadout per character , the rest would be sold option for atoms . And I’m okay with this honestly
---
Yeah but I usually dont go to em anyways. Except to buy bulk junk.
---
I have yet to see one of these posts be about an actual "bug."
---
Because these posts are made constantly and the community answer is always the same - THERE IS NOTHING AFTERWARDS. No special dialog or anything. Youre not missing out on anything if this quest autocompletes.
---
I wish they would just make all non combat perks always active.
---
I never spent the bullion to unlock these, and now that I've actually tried them I never will.
---
I thought bullion items were supposed to be powerful? lol, these grenades are a joke.
---
This is specifically designed to increase fo1st sales through fomo.
---
They didn't abandon Appalachia they stayed at their posts and fought to the death to buy as much time as possible.  The brotherhood on the way are from lost hills going to find out just how fucked the world is from the scorched since losing communications.  And knowing bethesda there is an 80% chance they are bringing the plans for some shiny new power armor to reward us.
---
I wonder why can’t we sell/drop them
---
I'm pretty sure I got a 3 star cultist blade the other day. Think it was bloodied and something else. Will check when I get on
---
I was using them just because I can't sell them, but their AoE is terrible.
---
I sell some things if I need a quick cap but I just thought it would be cool to not have to set my survival tent out side a train station just to get the free ride.
---
She will attack you when she lands and she locks her head on you when she swoops. It's really creepy when she does that
---
There's a guide to levelling up fast, here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ewnmdi/a\_guide\_to\_level\_up\_fast\_in\_fallout\_76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ewnmdi/a_guide_to_level_up_fast_in_fallout_76/)
---
I would say though, I personally hate grinding by mowing down mobs. 
---
I really do enjoy FO76's public events. So to level up quick smart on my second character, I'd log in, join an events group, then hit every event I could manage. Take an automatic gun to Uranium Fever, Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand and hit everything you can. Over a weekend of pretty solid play, I hit level 60, and have a bunch of legendaries to sell/scrip/use.
---
A bonus side effect, I have at least 200+ Radaway, Stimpaks, Rad X and Purified water from all the event prizes.
---
just play the game anyway you feel like. you will get there.
---
Story quests are there to get you familiarized and will level you as you go.
---
Welcome
---
Here's Turtle's video on the effect.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4)
---
I‘ve started using them, and I’m actually kind of liking them a bit (especially the gnashes against human targets that seem to have no poison resistance).
---
At first I thought they had a very small blast radius, but observationally, they actually seem to hit out farther than the graphics would lead you to believe.  
---
I’m not big on grenades in general, so I’d rather not spend my bullion on the plans, but as free drops I’m completely cool with them.
---
I throw them randomly around the map...
---
That’s basically the same door I’m after. It just has a wood texture instead of the flowers.
---
It wouldnt take 20 minutes if we were allowed to cripple her wings
---
This game is really good at making wtf bugs. These are bugs that even have the developers going wtf?! There are many of them. Some are fun. Some of triggering. But overall that's what this game does well.
---
They are super useful for bugged Line in the Sand.
---
Since every time there's someone with explosive plasmas, they are great to tag the scorched for people without explosive weapons.
---
Can it have  N.I.R.A.'s personality?
---
Do you know what time the download starts though?
---
But the legendary lockpick/hacker perk will let you bypass the minigame at each level, so... trade offs.
---
I'm into that funky duds one, so I can swap out my less good poisoners armor for something mo' betta.
---
Already got my six pix, so time to grind, because I've lost so many cards to duplicates ;_;
---
I'm about 56. I'm in no rush to finish the run, as the only other item I'd like is the chicken coup. I should get that through just playing for a bit each day normally.
---
That's not really a playstyle, more of a dumb behavioural tendency
---
That means it’s pre existing plans.
---
Hmmm.  I was doing free range not too long ago and it seemed like the wolves popped out of nowhere surrounding the dang brahmin.  They didnt kill them but they took a lot of damage.  The one time all 3 made it we had 2 sheepsquach pop.  I thought it was only one lol?  Im using a shotgun bloodied build right now.  Its not even optimal.  Only a 1 star bloodied and my gear is missing an unyielding piece.  Some of the pieces are less then desirable.  Work in progress.
---
Except it has gotten way better since they have allowed pictures where before it was an endless tide of shitty highlights "look at my amazing dva bomb that got 4 kills!"
---
Yet people still post imgur links in their posts with no text all the time.
---
They should just allow them.
---
&gt;If bethesda ever release their own loadout manager I bet it wont be as good as this one.
---
This is what i am afraid really.
---
The orange astronaut looking one
---
No. I don't.
---
Possible it bugged when you logged in, since the game reequips you every time you sign into the game.
---
They start the maintenance at 10:00 ET, the actual time the patch gets released will vary.  Typically between 11-12 ET is when the download has been available, even if the servers aren’t up yet.  
---
That’s been my experience though
---
I think that will come in time. Possibly against the bos. Who knows. More
---
Content coming
---
I wasn't aware you could sell treasury notes.
---
WOW, thanks for the update.
---
Uhhh... 90% sure it’s affected by batteries included. Because I carry around 2.5k 2mm
---
I'm not familiar with that one, I was referring to the stars and stripes one.
---
Yeah I want the white wooden door with the flowers or whatever on it.
---
Ward calls you every 3 minutes to ask if you've found his water-cooled bonesaw yet
---
Also there is the problem with weapons reloading automatically when their magazine is not empty.
---
I'm with you there! The red rocket door was the most decent looking one I had available to work with for the moment, so that's what I've got because the rest are just awful.
---
Yeah obviously, the mod is updated for the live version, not the PTS.   
---
We have to wait for the release of Legendary perks on the live servers for the mod to be updated.
---
I run borderless since a long time without fps issues, had to adjust something tho:
---
Try this: go to documents/my games/Fallout 76 and open the file Fallout76Prefs.ini with notepad  (maybe make a backup first). Look for the line with 'iPresentInterval=1'  and change it to 'iPresentInterval=0', this unlocks fps.
---
IF you experience movement problems indoors (usually in PA), limit the max framerate for FO76 via nvidia control panel/AMD tool to a little bit under your actual monitor frequency.
---
As a side note - sometimes this setting is reset by a big update/patch like today. It is not recommended to set the file read only, may cause other problems.
---
One day, you'll be able to just walk PAST a fez...
---
yeah, i thought that the upcoming brotherhood dlc would be an excellent opportunity to add mods for this since they have a bunch of pre war technology &amp; stuff. also when you think about it the thought of not being able to mod it is kinda weird. we can build &amp; mod giant suits of power armor that probably cost literal millions of dollars prewar. i do agree with your point about the backpack though
---
You can't mod the one you already have?
---
Except in r/ffxiv they literally have filters you can click to remove all fanart, vids, etc. so you only see discussion posts.
---
Source: https://old.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/wiki/flairs_spoilers_filters
---
They could implement that here as well  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
(RP)
---
As a “new” Responder, I’m worried about what the Brotherhood coming back to Appalachia means for the people. They didn’t treat my predecessors too well... what are they coming back for? Why do they need the Observatory? The Vault Dwellers and the second-Gen Fire Breathers have pretty much dealt with the Scorched by now. Are they coming to lord over the populace and enforce their rule at gunpoint?
---
The Responders will always aid those who need it, but we are prepared to fight the Brotherhood of things turn sour. The people come first.
---
Thanks for the reply - I shall go a looking at Whitespring's Bunker...  Out back in the utility buildings?
---
I think I got a trigger to explore the mansion, then it lead me to the veil which started the mission.
---
1 competent player can solo it. Might depend on their build though. My B HW/explosive PA build can solo pretty much everything in the game...
---
57 i will never finish it, I just want the chicken coop, nothing else.
---
This is so true but bethesda's bootlickers will defend them every single time.
---
Cause they're technically bullion rewards.  Why they're dropping as casual loot is the real question.
---
Awesome, you rock. Just let me know what you want for them. Need at least two so I can get both my characters one. My IGN is the same as my Reddit name. I'll send an request after the patch today that hopefully doesn't break too many things, lol.
---
If I hadn't seen your comment, I would have completely forgotten that my camp was right there was well. Moved it with ten minutes to spare!
---
I like that idea. First thing I do when I log in is sell all my useless weight I don’t want to keep to a vendor. How handy would it be to just do it at my camp.
---
again, "idk if or when" --&gt; some authors quit the game or simply stop working on mods, there are so many mods that wont get updated anymore. idk if it's the case for this mod, it was just a common disclaimer.
---
Thanks, did it and it was fun!
---
How do you transfer to an alt? Open the game two times?
---
They actually piss me off. 
---
Legendaries can, apparently, drop all the gold items once you know the plan (excluding T-65 PA, Solar and Thorn armor parts) and what did I get from the millions of legendaries I murdered? 1 secret service armor chest piece. That's it.
---
These friggin grenades, however, amass in your inventory by just doing your basic high level mob grind. 10 from West-Tek, 5 from the NAR, 2 from Huntersville, etc. pp.
---
Considering how many posts I've seen along this vein, I'm starting to get a tad concerned that not enough will participate enough to do it. I've been trying to stockpile from Grafton Steel for the past 2 days, but don't have a ton because I gifted another player a bunch the other day when they needed it. Man, it's going to suck to miss out on the rewards if everyone just relies on someone else and NO ONE contributes. I really hope that doesn't wind up the case.
---
I don’t really have any other way to say this other than “git gud”. If you don’t like PVP don’t engage in it, if you don’t want to take the time to learn what mutations/armor prefixes/and weapons would compliment your build and play style, don’t complain when you get wiped in PVP..
---
Hell never run out of osmosis kits. This is his life forever. Plus others are getting them back.
---
The challenges are simple enough, a curve ball once in awhile is kinda nice. Had to actually go 'hunting' for a three star legendary creature as I didn't feel up to the task of launching a nuke. Found a 3* mutant at west Tek. But I get it, most people don't have that kinda of time.
---
Can it be N.IR.A.?
---
I don't use, sell, or display my colas, but I need to pick every single one up.
---
I need this..
---
I prefer to solo it, its not that difficult.
---
Especially if you're grinding out crafting just to sell for some caps.
---
I want colorado to be visited. It’s like Appalachias mountains but better. Imagine a snow covered biome and a desert biome, forest, military bunkers and bases, all sorts of experiments. We already have the presidential vault if I’m correct in CO so why not fallout it up.
---
You won’t
---
If I am in my C.A.M.P. And any lvl 25 or lower swings by and uses my vendors, I always craft them a Handmade with a few mods or a lever action.
---
Most wont even pick it up which I find weird.
---
Had a lvl 7 stop by Sunday, tricked out a Handmade a bunch of Stims and grenades and they were super excited even though they had a few levels to go before getting to use it.
---
I wish there was a txt based system to use with emotes so I could ask what they need.  Mics are not used enough.
---
Also been trying to put lvl 5-20 fixed up stuff in my vendors cheap from my raider collectron, it’s hit or miss, tends to go quick on weekends lately with the Gamepass players.
---
I HATE THIS!! I have killed so many tougher enemies and legendarys and as im walking up to it to loot it, i turn around to look at something or fight something off and POOF!! Its fucking gone. It pisses me off so much.
---
&gt; How else is it possible for the mod to be around for so long but they can't manage it.
---
Because they prefer to focus on other stuff first that brings them money (atom store, fallout FU 1st, etc.)  
---
I mean look at the "Legendary perks", they were supposed to come out more than a year ago, but they got delayed after delay after delay. They just can't figure a  way to manage their resources well.
---
It will be interesting to see if they make mention of it today in the patch notes.
---
NUKA COLA NEON SIGNS! AND I WANT THEM NOW!
---
Except the raiders. Just putting it out there. They just tried to take advantage of the situation and then ate some delicious Scorched Plague when they were the last ones cowering.
---
I was on server then and was quite surprised how can anyone miss a nuke so I thought it was intentional
---
I've got max demolition expert and those things are still shit. They're just a novelty, and a heavy one at that.
---
Fake wood panelling and that ceiling fan.
---
Think it’s so dumb that I get these dropped but never the dynamite that I actually use? What’s the logic behind it
---
Stay safe; hope there isn't too much damage.
---
That's great. Lol
---
No. It’s not going to happen. You’ll have to just drop them and have the HORROR of pushing a few buttons extra.
---
Glad you liked it. I was running it almost everyday when it released as I needed the pepperoni roll's carry weight boost to deal with my crippling weight problems. Lol.
---
Still haven't got tired of it like I have of most of the repeatable stuff.
---
I have an assassins sent set but it’s annoying that I had to grind and trade forever to get it to even be given a chance in pvp. The system is definitely broken. The barrier of entry is too big. Quantum’s and stealthbots legit break pvp. The armor is one thing but it’s basically a 0 skill game at this point. Who wants that?
---
Yea, to the point where company moderated subreddits immidiatly set a post to 0 if it isn't a picture or video. Just because clicks and virality
---
Well i have a free mod that works perfectly and has 12 slots quickly available and easily manageable.  
---
So no thanks.
---
I thought he was kinda acting with their instruction slightly, maybe? I mean, you can't make out a ton of what they're saying in those repeated messages, but you get the gist mostly. I wonder how they'll do the messages. Will they slowly clear up over time? I don't think they've all been fully decoded yet by the super computer people working on them in the FO community.
---
They're fun for spooking other players with, since they make Floater noises when they detonate.
---
Chuck them around while everyone is looting all the meat piles after Radiation Rumble, it usually freaks a few people out (since Floaters actually spawn as enemies there).
---
Same here, on the og PS4 and the lag is pretty bad. It just seems poorly optimised
---
When my friends start playing, this is one of the first things I show them... probably the most easily satisfying booms in the game.
---
They are actually decent. I doubt I’d get the plans and make them.
---
Yeah I think my game is bugged. The quest only shows up under misc as "Investigate the Body" with no quest marker.
---
Would be great as a drop plan from a Halloween event, along with throwable toilet paper that leaves a toilet paper streamer on its wake. Lol
---
Do we even know what all the non community rewards are and how much you have to donate to get a shot at a box of disappointment?
---
Holiday scorched and Treasure Hunter loot pool and that's it?
---
There's another indy game that has amazing base building. Better than subnotica or the sims. It's called Minecraft. What a weird name right? It's a really fun one though. If you can remember the name you should check it out!
---
Chances are they won’t even check, the box is prolly so full it’s spilling
---
Why? That’s literally the point of those legendary and chem effects. 
---
If I took the time roll a decent set of assassins/sentinel armor and get hopped up on some chems then I expect you to be about as effective as a level 1 radroach at bringing me down.
---
It was an Atomic Shop item if I remember correctly.  I could be wrong though.  Hopefully someone else can confirm it’s source/location.
---
PvP shouldn't be about who has the most stealth boys and quantums. Or who has the best set of armour and perks.
---
It should be skill based, the current PvP meta isn't fun.
---
It would be better if legendary gear and perks didn't alter damage at all, and we all did the same damage to each other.
---
I just use the auto grenade launcher. Shoot a grenade per spawn, might miss a few but not many
---
I made an abysmal mothman plush yesterday. I'm very proud of it.
---
Bethesda markup on a SBQ plushie would be pretty hefty, but would still be neat to have available. I'm not too stoked about their teddy bears but Comrade Chubs is still tempting I suppose, although not as much as that Cacodemon they have up.
---
There's a Gaming Heads Deathclaw out in the wild too.
---
I just want stuffed animals because I never grew up.
---
I would settle for another shelf that lets you store items on it. Otherwise I would also want this to reappear.
---
Yea 5 is better. I’ll tag a legendary and use the follow me emote but usually the 1st person to get there kills it. So it’s almost pointless
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one that’s pissed by them. I’m a melee build so when I do West Tek I loot the corpse as soon as I hit it, which means I don’t realise till later I have them weighing me down
---
?im somewhat new to the game so I don’t see where they’ve done it other than cosmetically
---
Bro, this list is so big for a game release two years ago...
---
Probably because no one actually bought them with gold bullion so they introduced them into the drop pool.
---
You don't do their dailies for reputation?
---
The one in The Mire is hard as the SQ (there may be 2) spawn in the same place as where the brahmin are and the brahmin don't run away. And the fly ads get hard to target in VATS.
---
The other 2 are easy enough solo, friendly fire plus a shishkebab will heal the brahmin
---
Good point
---
We’ve been asking for perk loadouts since launch. We’re coming up on the 2 year anniversary of Reclamation Day. The fact we didn’t have loadouts a year ago is ridiculous.
---
I doubt they are going to remove them. However they maybe need to lower the rate they drop.
---
They are t bad. But if a person is a one gun kills them all kind of player I doubt they will ever use them.
---
How much cork do you actually have?  I've been fo 1st for awhile so I try to scrap everything and I only have like 1800 across two characters.
---
Wow it’s almost like you can’t read the requirement next to the description that says three star CREATURE. Did you also somehow miss the 100 other posts about this today? Lol
---
Holy cow, I didn't think it respawned at all. Usually I just run through the caves as fast as I can &amp; gather all I can grab and then try to tag someone else in for a run while I attempt to handle the mobs. Since I do better at ore gathering than crowd control, I'd prefer to stick to the ore, though, tbh. I didn't know just making another run through was even an option!
---
I’d just like to be able to do something with the 100+ I’m carrying around that I can’t use for the daily.
---
I tested it thoroughly pretty recently and saw no difference in weight with both perks. Unless my game is bugged idk but my 2mm weight cannot be reduced. I’ve also seen some people say that the grounded mutation does not affect gauss weapons but it totally affects my gauss weapons so I don’t know what’s up with that I’m just unlucky I guess lmao
---
Yikes, your daily challenge, pickup as much dirty water as possible. /s
---
The entire game, which is why there are so many bugs.
---
Lol legendary perks got delayed a full season, load outs won’t be out in December, we’d be lucky to get them by the end of January
---
Trying to get people to use them was what I figured.
---
Yes - I can - BUT...  They disappear every time I log off and back in.   Something to do with it being for the mission - Bucket list.  It returns it each time to its' original state.
---
Thanks All for the replies!  I will just go get me one!  Or wait till the bucket list is done and then mod it!
---
The white one tucked into pants? It was free on atomic shop awhile back
---
In minecraft there are hardly any furniture options and it's hard to decorate a decent house, at least for me. Some of us want to(and do) go full on The Sims in Fallout 76.
---
I do know that someone actually bought them with gold as this person is out to buy the whole catalog.  But I'm more of the mind that someone screwed up a loot table, and that they'll go back to being craft only.
---
And there's the problem.
---
If 9-11 high level players want to do it, the first come first served will all get to the instance with 8 players. The late comers will form their own instance of 1-3 players, which might not be enough to actually do the event in time. Causing players to not bother and leave, and eventually get frustrated and come to Reddit and whine how the event is too difficult.
---
i'd pay to see the code that goes into the games weapons, looks like it would be a total shitshow
---
They told you what the rules are you just didn’t care to read. I had no problem getting the daily done.
---
Why? Because it's broken and it makes the game completely imbalanced.
---
Let me guess, you like using this armor effect/perks/chems that makes you invincible? That's not balance, that's no fun for BOTH players. We are not talking about level 1 vs level 50. We are talking about level 120 vs level 200.
---
just another 2 more years ...
---
Logging onto my mule is like a freeze
---
Will you need PA for Colossus Problem? I know a nuke will activate it but isn’t it an interior event? Will the radiation from a nuke affect the interior of the mine?
---
Under normal circumstances, every time you join a game you enter a different world.  
---
There are ways to guarantee you will join the same world, meaning loot placed in a container by one character will be accessible to another.  
---
1 ) Use a FO1st Private World*  
---
2 ) Join the world of someone on your Friends List and ensure/hope they stay on the same world until you finish transferring.  
---
*Using a FO1st world means you can do it yourself, but it isn't an intended or safe way of doing it. Private Worlds can unexpectedly reset for a multitude of reasons, which would result in a loss of all items you are in the process of transferring. Don't risk what you aren't willing to lose, and if you lose items this way you only have yourself to blame. That being said, I've dine it near a hundred times now and only lost items once.
---
Vending. If you see it just to sell weapons and armor, you won’t sell much. Think outside the box.
---
Nope they are useless.  Their status affects cant kill a level 5 molerat
---
I would find it funny, if we stumble later in the observatory over huge piles of the technical data. And the BoS scribes just "Meh, don't know who put them all in there. They're all useless pieces of paper today"
---
Good question! If I had to guess, I'd go with Fat Men? Thanks, though, now this will bother me all day!
---
I want Miss Nanny reading me anything over the radio.   
---
Miss Nanny... so dreamy... 😍
---
You had a good run...
---
It could collect the toy trucks and other memorabilia too since Bethesda probably wouldn’t be willing to hand out all the Nuka flavours so easily
---
Only Bulking Aluminum and Lead saves weight.
---
😳
---
The cryolator can also freeze other players with or without them in passive. Had someone come to my camp the other day as I was giving two other people a tour and they kept freezing us in place (they were eventually blocked and were not able to do anything to us after we all blocked them)
---
&gt; Maybe event bosses don't count?
---
They most definitely do. My anecdotal evidence: cave cricket horde boss counted for me.
---
Vending. I move all ammo for 1c each, chems for 5c each, plans cap out at 20c. I feel like moving more on the cheap is better than getting the 'big score' sales. I do, however, carry some decent Purveyor rolls that have 0 application for my build that I'll move for about 5000-10000c.
---
Also depends on your playstyle. Stealth has less armor repairs, melee doesn't need ammo. The less junk you need, especially more Rare junk that you might just end up buying, the more caps in your pocket.
---
Some menus, vending and cooking
---
They are trying to get people to give up some of the millions of pounds of junk that has been duped and acquired thru the duping of Christmas presents
---
I want the laying down photomode pose so I can become the ultimate bush wookie in Nuclear Winter lol.
---
That, and I want the Gift Box loot bag so that I can give nooobs stuff more easily. I was boycotting the Atomic shop last December when it came out. Poor timing, I know. \^\_\^
---
I’m already holding it. And no not really
---
300 for 6k caps
---
It’s already strayed
---
It funkin blows on console. I hate switching the lock\hacker perks more than anything. My other favorite is running encryptid and then noticing super duper and ammo smith are still enabled 🤦‍♂️
---
Just started playing really but I'd love this contemporary house set that everyone seems to have.
---
i'm gonna guess at least 500, since maintenance just started.
---
Because every subreddit that does this becomes a low effort karma farm of the same 12 things being posted and reposted over and over and over and over and over again.
---
Part of me wants to advocate for NW here, but you still need a viable perk card load out to really stand a chance. And unless you run an off the wall build, you need a second character to really be effective at NW. There’s just not really a decent PvP mode in this game.
---
Nope they will still ask and then they will ask some more :)
---
Sadly it won't. People will still come here asking and even the people that know its supposed to be down will come here asking about it
---
That's what I need to know before I sign my steel over to those turds. I just opened my last 5 saved treasure pails this week and got 4 common mounted plans and nothing worth a damn. If this is the same loot pool again it may be a hard pass. Now if they give me a shot at T-60 power armor plans they can have all the steel I can farm these next few days.
---
I'm a non-bloodied, 6 strength melee character, I have my wood armour, some basic weaponry and that's it. I have no idea what to spend caps on, so I just kinda accumulate them.
---
Yup its getting worse thinking about getting a SSD. Might help might not, who knows but the evo 860 is pretty cheap right now.
---
Ah, man. I was hoping someone knew about when it would end. That's a bummer. All I've been doing the past few days is play Fallout 76, so I'll have to figure out some thing else to spend my time on. XD
---
I would like it if you could set up a vendor at the Whitespring, even if it was only 1 vendor (so max 30 slots), and had a slightly higher fee (like 15%). It would likely turn into a rare item trading post, with regular camp vendors just for random things like plans, aid, or low level items.
---
Challenge at 50/??? Dirty buckets of water
---
no.      \*insert Obama "then Perish" meme\*             \^\_\^    
---
I kinda want to see your camp now tho... You made me curious lol
---
Does zorbo move 1 or 2 spaces a day?
---
Never gonna happen
---
Would be nice for them to change the pistol being when I crafted one and I rolled one from purveyor they both are 3 star junkies. But it’s useless right now
---
Or give the nuka-quantum a super low spawn rate
---
If you are using vats, you may be missing a few shots.
---
Then set rules with your friends and PVP with them. You realize how ridiculous this request is and the logistics of making armor work for certain types of damage and then get rendered absolutely useless for PVP would probably open a wormhole of new bugs or scripting errors. Besides, I’d be able to probably swamp you in a single burst from some ridiculous legacy Flamer or something if we were both wearing no armor and not exploiting the nuka colas. So you also want to remove legendary effects on weapons? Lmao, I would expect some infuriating and game breaking issues to arise out of that one for sure.
---
As do I but it got worse and it doesnt help I tripped and spilled an entire bucket
---
Yes, and the only thing they hate is being woken up, and the only thing that wakes them is pictures
---
The Nuka Cola and Slocum’s Joe neon signs. I can’t see why they didn’t bring back the Slocum’s one when they had the bundle out
---
Might be I don't know. It definitely isn't the first item I would buy with my gold bullion though.
---
Ditch all your unnecessary notes, holos etc.
---
Hey the servers are down for me, anyone else having this problem??
---
UGH, they didn't patch the Commander Dagguare quest
---
Wish mods would set up an automod rule for patch days. All it takes is filter out related words so posts go into mod queue instead of instant approval.
---
wow.
---
I’ll give it a try. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
I don't want to engage in PVP i just wanted to take over grafton steel without some high level player with god armor destroying all my shit and annihilating me. The worst part is when they don't even want to take over the workshop they just want to grief you. Then they leave when you leave then they come back to destroy everything again after you repaired it. Then you go to another server for them to just follow you there.
---
Not spending my money on fallout 76 for a private server when it's such a broken imbalanced game LAGGY game on console.
---
Telling me to "git gud" is insanely ignorant. There is no way to "Git gud" against someone in overpowered armor. The best i could do is hide in a corner with a chameleon armor until they gave up.
---
I took the title seriously. Well played.
---
Yeah I like the NW system, I just think PvP should stay out of adventure mode entirely.
---
I'd even say bring Back an improved survival mode for those players that enjoy the current PvP rules, then they can choose to kill whoever and when ever.
---
Eastern? You mean China?
---
I’m not convinced Mt Blair is worth the trouble. It REALLY is a lot of trouble going through that maze of a machine. And you’re right, the monsters usually are stuck on the ground. And you know you’re gonna get ‘defeat the scorchbeast’ as an event quest. Sure, you can melt them at this point if you’re currently stocked up, but I don’t go out of my way to defeat normal scorchies.
---
...are the servers down...
---
But not my receipts from the Insult Bot. I need those for people’s crappy camps.
---
I had one last night where I ran up to the queen to loot her and I saw the items leave her as if someone else was picking the items up.
---
Lame. This is the only time I have to get the dailies and now I've missed out on all of them
---
I want that door!  It looks perfect for my house.
---
Came here for this. No idea man? It said something about the servers are going down for a new patch that’s out today but why are the servers down?
---
I agree that the nuka colas and stealthboys are annoying but those are a completely different issue than armor and weapons doing what they are designed to do.
---
No the problem is the game many times doesn't sync well due to laggy servers, and even though you see damage on the screen the HP of the mob doesn't go down, this is especially happening with high damaging weapons.
---
Totally I gave up on squirrel stew a long time ago :)
---
I just got an 8 gb update on Xbox
---
You play on Xbox?
---
That would actually be pretty nice.
---
You mean they sacrificed themselves to fight the Scorch Beasts, not to mention super mutants, while the privileged Responders moaned about having to contribute to the survival of Appalachia? Say what.
---
Like 20? I have yet to get the first PA paint.
---
Very true.
---
That would be good. Mostly regular Nuka-cola and Nuka-World souvenir junk, a low chance for any of the other flavors of Nuka-cola.
---
Do it enough times and they might promote you to Elder.
---
It's the coffin backpack for me. It was the least obtrusive backpack they've come out with so far- simple, sleek, goes with every outfit, I need it!
---
Yeah, same as me....first person there kills it.   Clueless or selfish, I have no idea.
---
Nope, I'm still playing. I wired Todd some money and he hooked me up.
---
I want it so badly for my bedroom.
---
Working for me. You must be banned.
---
I would like if these were Rewards for events, rather than random weapons or Armor that most people will likely scrap. Even better if they created an aid package (similar idea, but for aid items) and you get one of those, plus ammo points, plus treasury notes, scaled for the difficulty of the event.
---
yup, no none subbed player is able to prep for this event. I'm already at 750 while only having 150 to 200 of each junk type...
---
The BoS didn't do shit. They moved to the middle of the plague for no reason as there was plenty of other places to move once they got bigger. Spoiler alert - that's not a good idea when you're trying to not succumb to the plague. They refused to use the nukes even though they knew it was the only option that would save everyone and eliminate the plague because they had "morals". Yet those same morals convinced them it was perfectly okay to steal resources and technology from everyone else while jerking themselves off about how superior they were from the raiders. 
---
The Free States were the true heroes. They tried to create the cure and they worked their asses off attempting to save all of Appalachia. The Responders were great at keeping the peace but they focused more on helping those effected by the Scorched instead of actually eliminating the plague.
---
I’m usually an ore runner too since I’m only level 68 right now but I get to about 50 ore before it starts to take forever to respawn. I’d say defending scavengers while waiting would probably be the best bet for a couple minutes until you can make another pass through the tunnels
---
i seem to only ever get stimpaks and ammo from this quest. i have probably turned in 5 to 10 of them. are you guys getting real loot from it?
---
usually 2 to 3 hours maintenance.
---
Hear that? That's the song of the world
---
PS4
---
One .38 bullet at a time (:  
---
When my vendors emptied out themselves automatically one day, I made sure on the restock to have one stack in each of my vendors. Now it's my bestseller item.
---
Finished the run one day before double-xp ended. Turned out really fun to push the limits of my build to squeeze as much xp as it was possible from the setup I had -))
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/RShf36z.    Bad screenshot and it’s improved since then but here it’s not much but it’s home
---
If you do, I give you a week maximum before you're on here demanding Bethesda provide a bathtub and sponge with which you can give her a good scrub.
---
You could be right, but I do see the health take hits. Just small ones.
---
I said it a 1000 times and I will say it again:
---
Best PvP would be the classic survival mode (with top 3 players displayed) without legendaries. Only self crafted items. This way it would be fair for everyone and learning plans would have a meaning besides just collecting them.
---
I always ran my low level characters (after the first one) starting at \~8/9 through Power up Poseidon Power Plant events. Lots of Scorched (ammo, weapons to scrap), xp and plans for the generators. Other events are great too, don't hesitate to join Public groups for the higher ones - most people don't mind a low level joining them.
---
If you are not worried about leveling up as fast as possible - explore the world.
---
I dont think theres another one scheduled until after season end.  I could be wrong though, and they could spice things up in the last week, who knows?
---
He wont make it to the end of the match... lol
---
Of course it's a matter of what Beth sees as important and I can understand it. I was just saying that it's not a big job for a company the size of Beth. 
---
And it was Beth that thought inserting BR to this game was a good idea, and that is one mode that would hugely benefit from crossplay. I don't play BR mode, but there are still few that does.
---
So much this. I honestly think this is a far bigger problem than people realise.
---
Just got an 50gb update on Xbox Game Pass for PC, what the fuck?
---
Was doing the dailies and the message popped up that I only had a few mins left, I rushed a few but couldnt do them all, was at 24/25 creatures killed and the last mutant outside the front of west tec was dead, was trying to run round the back to kill 1 more but got disconnected
---
Bruhhhhhh. Freezer grenades are amazing for the queen. The moment she lands throw a few at her and she'll freeze keeping here on the ground.
---
Holy crap.
---
In under two hours?  I wouldn’t hold your breath
---
Yeah I know, it's a difficult problem that Bethesda have created. I realise you can't just scrap a whole playstyle without pissing off and alienating a lot of the fans.
---
Best they can do is remove PvP from adventure mode entirely, and bring back survival.
---
Maybe have some added PvP events like monster mash in both adventure mode and survival, that way I think, we would have more fun.
---
Dude I know it's driving me crazy. I mean they should have backup servers for their servers am I right?? Lol
---
Yeah, most people are saying they got it from the queen, I didn't have to worry about it since I did it early on by accident, that was just her experience but I don't know if she did enough damage to count towards a "kill"
---
Oh sorry I would’ve helped you out. I’m on Xbox and have 19 cards. I grab one every time I see the cargo not floating. I only ever launched 2 nukes. One back when game first came out and one just two weeks ago.
---
I have a bloodied cripple faster reload M79 grenade launcher. There’s a major bug with it. I can repair the gun to 200% health, then join the Line in the Sand event, and if I shoot a grenade into the center mass of scorched that spawn, I’ll only be able to fire 8 grenades before my weapon breaks. It’s like the guns durability is related to damage dealt, and not rounds fired.
---
So I watch for the numbers to pop up and then try to very quickly add them together while I fire. I don't think the numbers will display if you miss.
---
No.  They are currently installing the update that will open the game up to the newest dupe wave or other exploit  bwhahaha
---
This is why nuclear winter is the way it is. It's also why they removed survival mode.
---
You shouldn't worry that much about it, there are dupers with millions of scrap on their scrap boxes, they can finish it in an hour if they want.
---
Trade forums and sell high value weapons and armour
---
It will be down until they are done.
---
9 on ps4. Bigger is better, right?
---
There is little doubt in my mind all will be accomplished in the event. Those of us who have been around since the beginning of this game know a little secret. ;)
---
Why do they even have to go down though? I mean it’s not like they need maintenance. Can’t they just turn them on and let them run forever?
---
I just throw them in the sky and pretend they’re fireworks.
---
I'd like to have hope that they'll patch quest item spawns and camp issues but god knows they won't
---
I hate them but then there’s people like you who love them so at least give us the option to pass them on.
---
This is why my playtime in this game is evaporating to 0. This is just the bugs in the weapons alone. The entire game is broken to the point it can’t be repaired. Only bandaged.
---
Get a set of unyielding gear to bump your charisma up a bunch when selling/buying, make sweet rolls and mothman egg omelets, or pop a grape mentat. I've got 5 industrial water purifiers in my base to snag up 25 water every time I go back to my base too.
---
3 points into walking pharmacy and a grocers pack does wonders for your ability to carry a stupid amount of items worth good caps too. If I really need money in a hurry I head to the farm on the west side of the map, it's a workshop, that has like 200 wheat crops and I just pick them and sell em. Presumably green thumb would double your yield but I have no issues getting my 1400 a day without. Don't be afraid to sell items you find too, just because a roll isn't perfect doesn't mean people won't be interested in buying them.
---
There are online tools you can use to gauge the market value of an item and in my experience undercutting those values by a grand or so sees my stuff sell relatively fast (PS4). Use some common sense too, bloodied items are always in demand even if kind of crappy. I paid somebody 3k for a level 25 1 star bloodied handmade just because I needed it for DPS and ammo conservation in certain situations over my normal weapon. Still using it and my main is level 270 now lol.
---
Should be up tomorrow around 5
---
She is the worst of the worst.
---
🥳🥳
---
I keep my Nuka Cola machine filled with regular Nuka Cola and occasionally Nuka Cola Cherry. I find so many of them that I often end up just selling them as vendor trash. I only keep 10 of each one on me. Quantum is the only one I am usually under as I use it for Encryptid
---
They never tell us how long the servers will be down. You may be able to start downloading the update between 11-12. But logging on to play might not be till 1-3.
---
The moment it's up, I'm sure someone here will say.
---
They'll probably shoot you for filling their mailbox with trash.
---
Here are some weapon bugs I have run into that I did not see on the list.
---
#Harpoon: 
---
* **Rubber Banding**: when walking in 3rd person while having the harpoon gun out, your character will lag/rubber band back every few seconds. you take 3 steps forward and 2 steps back. (can confirm while in PA, I am not 100% sure it is a thing out of PA) Has been in the game for over a year
---
* **Flechette Accuracy**: my explosive flechette harpoon gun's (legacy) accuracy when zoomed in is as good as a sniper, I am able to hit targets from a mile away. while my Quad flechette harpoon gun's (Not Legacy) accuracy could not hit the broad side of a barn while zoomed in. each of the shots flies way off, for example, I have aimed at Scorched at Valley Galleria's parking lot, fired my Explosive harpoon gun, and hit with all shots. but with quad, I shot at the scorched and got hit markers on a car that was to the right of him. same distance, same vats accuracy.
---
#Gatling Gun:
---
* **Extended 3rd Person Reload**: Uses the normal tall mag hand animation to reload the gun in 3rd person. (can confirm with PA)
---
* **Extended Mag Sights**: part of the extended mag covers up the middle of the sight when ADSing. making it hard to see targets that are below your sights and obscures the center of the sight
---
#Auto Grenade Launcher
---
* **Physical Mod for Magazine**: I have a physical mod box for the Auto Grenade Launcher that says Default mag. even though there is no other magazine option for the gun
---
* **Heavy Barrel is Pointless**: originally the heavy barrel said that it did more damage for the gun but at the cost of weight, the mod increased the weight but did not increase damage (was like that until wastelanders). with Wastelanders, the mod dropped the text of increasing damage and is now just a heavy long barrel that has not benefits over the long barrel
---
I think it’s spacially challenged peoples
---
11 gb steam.
---
Thanksgiving display and pickett fances.
---
Collect all the serum recipes - that will keep your caps down for a while.
---
After a while you cant hide in a bush successfully lol
---
No they shouldn't. What effect is on the weapon?
---
Not interested in that sort of stuff, I was just tired of the other four and want to 100% the game lol
---
You can’t buy me hotdog man
---
If not, you can find her at the small camp from the Photo Opportunity daily.  I found her there after 5 or 6 server jumps.
---
Is anyone else experiencing this as well?
---
Not quite friendly. But very true 🤣
---
The data does not lie. Unless they created new plans for those loot pools, we're going to be disappointed. (which dataminers have not found)
---
1gb more of data, I swear Sony is killing this generation with exclusives.
---
It’s too late, there’s already like 6
---
and they are heavy weighing in at .5 weight. you cant sell them and you or trade them. you either drop them or throw them.
---
the grenades do a high amount of damage real quick but have such a small radius that your enemies will have to be on top of it to actually take damage
---
I’ve accepted my fate I’ll go down laying on my bloody mattress high on all sorts of chems and dreaming of simpler time’s
---
Excited to farm A Colossal Problem for those Wendigo CAMP items! While we wait, here's a buglist. 
---
Link to my most recent list: [List Number 23](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hio4tb/fallout_76_update_20_patch_notes_june_30_2020/fwh6air/?context=3)
---
***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
A few bugs/oversights that I am revisiting just in case they were forgotten:
---
* Toggling the quick Pip-boy view on or off while having a holotape inserted brings up the [Pip-boy UI and the holotape UI at the same time.](https://imgur.com/a/ocA3UJr) This happens regardless of which view you start from
---
* When Bee Swarms die, the [corpses they leave behind are ants and not bees,](https://imgur.com/a/LqML0As) this is likely a holdover from Nuka-World
---
* Wrapped Cap cannot be worn with masks or eyewear because it occupies slots 47 (eyes), 48 (beard) and 49 (mouth) despite the model [not covering any of those parts](https://imgur.com/a/UtYLigp)
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Challenge - The Social challenge, 'Revive Players', [does not display a reward,](https://imgur.com/a/9wTNRVL) and does not award anything
---
* Fallout First - Moving your Survival Tent while someone is using the instrument causes them to be [stuck in the animation](https://imgur.com/a/tSv9VrQ) (and still able to move and interact with objects) until they unsheathe a weapon or use the instrument again. Occurs with all tent skins
---
* Fallout First - Moving your Survival Tent while someone is using the cooking station causes them to be [stuck in the animation while still able to move](https://imgur.com/a/icoMO7C) (movement controls are inverted), but they cannot interact with anything or move the camera until they unsheathe a weapon. Occurs with all tent skins
---
* Fallout First - Moving your Survival Tent while someone is using the bed causes them to be [stuck in the sleeping animation,](https://imgur.com/a/gibNoTQ) able to move but not interact with anything or move the camera. Unholstering your weapon or dying while stuck in the animation breaks the camera (your camera becomes stuck to your ankles), and entering your pipboy causes you to be softlocked; none of these issues can be fixed without a relog. Occurs with all tent skins
---
* Public Teams - The map icon for Public Team Leaders appears on top of Event icons, and [can completely cover them](https://imgur.com/a/Iw4MHRb)
---
* Public Teams - The Public team HUD UI can [fail to update the bonus to reflect the number of active team bonds](https://imgur.com/a/rZO9dLm)
---
* Seasons - In the description for Scrip, the [Purveyor's name is spelled incorrectly,](https://imgur.com/a/QYyMPsg) "Mumurgh" should be "Murmrgh"
---
* Seasons - When displayed, [lunchboxes sink into the display case,](https://imgur.com/a/BzAYCcK) this is likely due to an incorrect pivot point
---
* Seasons - The Ghillie skins for almost all armors [block a large chunk of vision in 1st person](https://imgur.com/a/ql054sb) when used with certain heavy weapons like the 50cal or the Auto Grenade Launcher
---
* Atomic Shop - The Trick Candy Bowl uses the ['Drink' interact prompt](https://imgur.com/a/b7lBsoR) instead of the 'Eat' interact prompt (likely inherited from the Punch Bowl)
---
* Atomic Shop - [Mountain Scout headwear has no icon](https://imgur.com/a/DtpoDRt)
---
* Atomic Shop - Mountain Scout headwear cannot be crafted despite being shown as unlocked in the Atomic Shop
---
* Atomic Shop - Tactical Ops Underarmor [clips through certain outfits such as the Pint-Sized Slasher Costume and Treasure Hunter outfit](https://imgur.com/a/trGsWAF)
---
* Atomic Shop - The Pint-Sized Slasher Knife skin for the Machete [does not change the handle of the Machete,](https://imgur.com/a/wMpdCmt) and thus does not match the Atom Shop preview image
---
* Atomic Shop - Enclave Scout Armor skins cannot be applied to Vault 94 Thorn and Solar armors
---
* Event - Heart of the Swamp - When this event begins, the first instance of damage to the Strangler Heart applies full damage (not the reduced damage the Heart normally takes), with enough damage it is possible to kill the Heart in one shot, and this sometimes breaks the event and renders it uncompletable
---
* Event - Jailbreak - This event fails to auto-track, and must be manually tracked every time
---
* Nuclear Winter - The loading screen no longer has the 'Waiting for other players' portion, meaning that players who load faster than others can begin moving/looting earlier than other players
---
* Nuclear Winter - When you enter the loadscreen for Nuclear Winter, you hear the 'Player Downed' sound. This also occurs when swapping from Nuclear Winter back to Adventure
---
* Nuclear Winter - Exiting Nuclear Winter to the main menu breaks up your team, and you must form a new team in between every match (likely a side effect of Public Teams)
---
* Nuclear Winter - Swapping from Nuclear Winter back to Adventure causes your [inventory to appear invisible until you open your pip-boy](https://imgur.com/a/WFCtxkL) (most easily seen by interacting with a vendor immediately after loading)
---
* Nuclear Winter - Swapping from Nuclear Winter back to Adventure causes the sound of the 'Bass' instrument to play every time a notification appears in the top left corner of the UI 
---
* Nuclear Winter - When you are revived by a player who has Healing Hands equipped, [the UI displays +50 rads for several seconds](https://imgur.com/a/Julzc34) even though you are getting cleared of rads
---
* Nuclear Winter - Falling long distances sometimes causes you to teleport back to the last object you were standing on (aka rubberbanding)
---
* Nuclear Winter - If a player has a Gauss Shotgun in their inventory, you can hear the charge up sound of the Gauss Shotgun when you are near them, even if they don't have it equipped
---
* Nuclear Winter - The end of a game can become bugged where it displays one person remaining (aside from your team) but that person is not in the match, meaning that the remaining players are forced to wait until the ring kills them, and are then given 2nd place instead of 1st
---
* At the Red Rocket Mega Stop, above the console where you turn in the Red Rocket Cores for the 'Waste Not' daily quest, there are [2 floating speakers labeled 'announcer'](https://imgur.com/a/asGKh5F)
---
* When you are not part of a team, [Herd Mentality does not show up in your Pip-boy status effects](https://imgur.com/a/MVLtCIu)
---
* Workshops icons sometimes [revert to their non-workshop icons,](https://imgur.com/a/xgwI1Iz) and also have the option to fast travel to them, but this fast travel fails because the workshop is not owned
---
* When your teammate completes a quest, the game displays the caps you receive, but does not display the XP you also gain from the quest completion
---
* There is a [light in Artisan's Corner that wasn't correctly removed](https://imgur.com/a/qAAB4VF) when the armor workbench was removed (note an identical light present under the leftmost bench)
---
* These 2 parts of the Whitesprings balcony above the main entrance are [missing geometry, allowing the player to see through the floor](https://imgur.com/a/MnTIpgl)
---
* Excavator, Ultracite, and T-65 Power Armor Helmets are missing all headlamp mods
---
* Blood Eagles that are wearing Power Armor have a [Vault 76 Jumpsuit equipped underneath the armor,](https://imgur.com/a/FO93rY5) this is because they have no keyword specifying which underarmor to display while in Power Armor, such as the keyword 'usePowerArmorFrameRaider'
---
* The map marker for [Bloody Frank's incorrectly says Berkeley Springs](https://imgur.com/a/YT8G1xb)
---
* [This telephone pole at Billings Homestead has missing collision](https://imgur.com/a/Jf4NhD0)
---
* [These beams above the Foundation Mill Saw are missing collision](https://imgur.com/a/1EfbkJi)
---
* When you load into a world, your [currencies sometimes display as 0](https://imgur.com/a/5lJDDGO) (only visual). After the amount gets increased or decreased, the actual amount is displayed. When this bug occurs, Perk Coins are also visible when normally they are not
---
* Imagespaces can fail to load fast enough, causing [everything to appear purple until they load](https://imgur.com/a/zE9nUCw)
---
* When dismembered, [Mirelurk Hunter claws are missing textures and appear neon green](https://imgur.com/a/v0BPdmp)
---
* Certain outfits like the Pint-Sized Slasher Costume and Treasure Hunter Outfit will display the gloves of your underarmor and [make the player's wrist disappear.](https://imgur.com/a/HB4f8GG) Seen with Brotherhood underarmors and the Marine Wetsuit
---
* After completing the unmarked cannibal quest at Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast, the [balcony and basement doors are inaccessible,](https://imgur.com/a/7pxYomL) meaning one bobblehead spawn there is also inaccessible
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Add the ability to complete Daily Challenges that you missed, so that players aren't punished too hard for missing a day (for example, if I complete today's Dailies, unlock the Dailies I missed yesterday) 
---
* Make all Events show the number of participants, not just Public Events
---
* Nuclear Winter - Make Pharma Farma and Scrounger proc automatically on containers like they do in Adventure
---
* Nuclear Winter - Add the ability to see your Overseer Rank progress bar without having to die
---
* Add the ability to craft Bulk Screws
---
* Atomic Shop - Lower the volume of the sound effects from the Slocum's Joe Vending Machine and/or add a silent version, the SFX are a bit too loud
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Seasons - Add post-rank 100 incentives for people who finish the SEASON early; once you hit rank 100 there is no reason to continue earning SCORE
---
* Make the "Assassin's" Legendary Effect affect human NPC's
---
* Allow Scorched to spawn as Legendary enemies
---
* Nuclear Winter - Buff Class Freak, it is too niche in its current form since mutations are primarily obtained via Serums, which suppress negative effects. Turning it into a hybrid of Strange in Numbers and Class Freak might make it a more attractive option.
---
I agree 100%. They're crappy grenades and they weigh me down. I hate it whenever Bethesda puts stuff into my inventory that I haven't asked for, don't want, and don't even know about until I search to figure out why I'm encumbered.
---
I mean, mine is bloodied limb damage and it hits for 1600 on super mutants.  I use it to farm everything but scorchbeasts as I switch to a heavy for that.
---
I love how assholes downvote me for asking a fucking question
---
As someone from Colorado I second this!
---
Again, I don't need the caps. I don't really need better armour or weapons either. Even without bloodied, I feel overpowered.
---
It's always 5 minutes.
---
Player vending; sell plans and ammo. Sell good roll legendaries for a good price (ie not one star scrip bait or unwanted useless staff like medics/ghoul slayers etc). I've made about 40k caps from trading stuff on the marketplace on reddit too.
---
Screaming eagle skin fix? Nice.
---
Reject fish. Return to single celled organism
---
True but it's still pretty bad. Worst for me was getting nothing from Scorched Earth despite damage numbers saying I should have but generally it's an annoying waste of ammo, ap, crits etc.
---
Prefer Bones, Drugs and Radaway
---
Have you tried making sixteen individual posts about it yet?
---
Yeah thought it would've been 4pm my time not 3pm  but even then 30 minutes would've been better than 5 minutes, wasting everyone's time
---
Nah Gary accidentally unplugged the Ethernet and he doesn’t know where it came from. Might take him a few hours to figure out where to plug it back in
---
I just got the coop yesterday. While it's fun to have, it only produces fertilizer, so it's rather Meh! to me. I'm at 79 now, will hit 82 or 83 after today's weeklies and dailies, and the rewards I'm after are the Borderlands-style white raider mask (lvl 92 I think), and the dark Captain Cosmos PA skin. I should finish the run without any extra efforts (like using Atom points) weeks before the end, so I need not rush any longer now.
---
I'm afraid finishing prematurely will take out of the game a lot of my motivation to log in daily (or it will let me play the game like I did before, who knows).
---
Pistol perk cards help...  i have max on gunslinger and expert for extra damage but without it still hits really hard.
---
First time that's happened, usually 30 minutes
---
The PC approach is....super PC bro
---
Nice that the ammo converter changes made it to this patch, awesome!
---
Yep, they’re rewards for the kill not the event.
---
Daaaamn how many atoms did you spend?!
---
Right. I thought beckett was funny for a little bit but now it's just annoying. I'd switch him out but his bar fits my camp *a e s t h e t i c*
---
Lol. Go fight a legendary sheepY or run encrypted
---
I'm not seeing any Xbox updates.
---
Only 3. I’ll get my numbers up
---
Fallout 1st tent skin's, I've missed everyone. Frustrating is a understatement.
---
Hahahahaha laughing out loud at work fkkkkk
---
Loadouts need to come out before the Legendary perks system. as the current Legendary perk system is the worst possible grind I have ever seen in any game and is just an insult to the people who actually play and enjoy the game.
---
Legendary perks system needs a massive overhaul imo
---
*love emote*
---
colossal problem is turning into a colossal problem for beth.
---
What system you on? Could just be my location but I can usually sell them for 50 caps.
---
Grrrrrrrr.. look at patch notes...
---
All the time...
---
I"m getting health rubberbanding with automatic weapons (handmade) on ghouls, moleminers.
---
Actually silly thing is my .50 cal will shred them just fine but i guess thats just the firing speed is enough high that the server cannot rubberband before the mob(s) are allready dead for sure .....
---
Damn maybe I need to roll more to get a bloodied. But I figured it wasn’t any good. I have that and a assassins plasma caster that I didn’t bother rolling anymore. Because I figured I wouldn’t use them much. I rolled my first shotgun a two star bloodied and said good enough. I don’t know I’m turned away from using modules being the armor I got both arms and chest after two rolls 3 star unyielding but the legs took me freaking forever to get.
---
&gt; We are planning to make “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the next couple of weeks. 
---
Surprise fucking surprise.
---
It's not a big one, but it usually takes about two or so hours per update.
---
Mine would often unfavorite one of mine, I have two levers and only use the second when the first breaks. My first would break and I would open my favorites to swap to my other only to find it missing. I would then have to go back in and refavorite them both to get it to appear.
---
Besides the obvious, that he would instantly become the best and only companion anyone got, it makes little sense the guy who sells 3 beers a day would be able to afford to buy all the crap you had in your inventory you didn't want lol. Not to mention what the heck is he going to do with 37 mines and 22 lbs of nearly spoiled meat?  He never leaves your camp. He doesnt even sell that kind of stuff to begin with lol he runs a bar that looks like an 8 year old built it.
---
Now, if they added a feature to EVERY companion where they could run an "errand" for you to sell the junk you dont want at the train station while you're busy/away from your camp that would make more sense.
---
So you want it to do a lot of damage, but you don't want to invest perks into it.  MM'Kay.
---
I’m wondering if it should be persons and not People’s.......
---
I put my collectron in a cage when I leave my camp. It keeps trying to harvest Sofia’s bone shards.
---
I don't doubt that but the update might add new things to the esm.
---
Hope dies last. :)
---
I hope these grenades become highly needed in the future, in Expeditions or something. Specially the freezer one, which slows enemies down
---
Yes, I know, I've played this game. It still doesnt change the fact, that it isnt a proper replacement for the survival mode, its just a poor mans fortnite clone.
---
Others mentioned vending, but Camp location helps a lot. You will sell more around Whitespring or Vault 76 than at a remote location in the middle of nowhere.
---
Then sell your stuff at the right price. I see too much 40mm grenades at 25 caps.
---
All of them.   
---
Not because I want everything, but because the artificial scarcity is just a cheap manipulation tactic.   
---
If they listed the whole catalogue and just rotated the discounts and bundles instead people would be more likely to find something they like by browsing, or buy something the saw in another player's CAMP.    
---
The "limited availability" / "get it before it's gone" system is nonsense. It's not like they ran out of digital wood to carve the digital doors you want.
---
Yeah, that’s where it gets me the worst too. 
---
Sometimes pod screens can take an age. But menus are so frustrating. Hitting the button to select something can take 5 or 6 attempts to register. It’s infuriating!
---
i just chuck them at shit tier enemies so i dont waste ammo but i usually still end up using ammo do to their shit blast radius
---
Scrips
---
Ah hey man I see the hurricane got you. I live pretty close to the beach in NC but luckily I didn't get too much damage. Here's to hoping you get it sorted out mate. Cheers!
---
Yes.  I see it happen with any high-health mob, like high-level Robobrains and Assaultrons, not just the classic bullet-sponge charred feral ghouls.  Shoot, health bar goes down, health bar magically jumps back up most of the way, rinse, repeat until dead. 
---
I get it that Legendaries regenerate a whole health bar once.  For them, I just want their corpse to persist in the world longer than 2 seconds before disappearing.
---
I’ll try this. See if it helps. Thanks.
---
Lol it’s one of my loading screens. Has been for months!
---
I'd love the Nuka-Cola vending machine secret door
---
That one is actually pretty clever.
---
You can get 1 star combat legendary armour, but the bigger reason why people do this is for the Brotherhood of Steel T-60 Paint plans, but it's about a 6% drop chance so roughly once every 20, make sure you're turning them in individually though
---
I was thinking that myself. An SSD just for Fallout. Most other things run fine.
---
If I accidentally pick up some, I use it on the first big thing I come across.
---
Yea its definitely good.  The caster isn't bad either...  definitely takes a lot to get something good.
---
Yea Fingers crossed :D 
---
I dont Charge anything for it, many people helped me out when I was low Level, and now i feel obliged  to give back as a lvl 340... the only thing i miiiight need is flux as I dont recall what ive got left and what they need for crafting.
---
Do you want 2 road leathers specifically or any of the other 3 raider underarmors?
---
Cinema workshop? Do tell!
---
So "A Colossal Problem" is not coming patch 21. Fantastic... Why even tell us about it in the patch notes?
---
They would always stay favorited for me but only the last used one would be in the hotswap rotation.
---
Yea right! I thought this sub agreed to measure everything in flamingos already
---
Ooooooooh i love a bit of game breaking news 😜😁
---
I've soloed the Sheepsquatch at the Brahman event. As for encrypted, well, some things should be hard. I know steam-rolling everything is fun to some people, but slaying the SBQ in seconds looks... Un-fun to me...
---
Different strokes for different folks, and all that.
---
the person who created that mod is a fucking god i've been using it for months now made my life so much easier
---
Ah so 16 is the magic number. No wonder my usual 15 didn't do anything. I need to up my game.
---
it's generally 30 minutes when they reboot a server during the day. 
---
Today, they are shutting down all servers for the new update. Which has been made known for weeks.
---
Never sajd I don’t want to invest in perks. I figured it wouldn’t be worth it. So thanks for your input. I’m level 270+ I have 80 level ups so perk cards ain’t a big deal. Just thought as it was was useless but as someone pointed out it isn’t if you get the right one.
---
PC and I'm at whitesprings. I think i had a good majority of the plans sitting in my vendor for like a month
---
Steel from scrapping weapons with scrapper perk (perk gives a lot), lead from home mine + junk (tag lead for search) = lowest effort ammo.
---
What mmo has ever required skill? Go play modern warfare lol
---
&gt;Legendary Loot: Daily Quests and Events have had their legendary loot rewards updated to include additional items, like The Fixer, Secret Service Armor, and others, so long as you’ve learned the Plans for them
---
Yay
---
Ahhh I haven't played in a few months and thought about hopping on while I have the time, oh well.
---
They removed it permanently since noone was playing it (or very low playerbase).
---
What an absolute joke.
---
*Missiles have entered the chat*
---
Yep. Actually building a melee to see if I can one shot the queen. By bloodied commando can solo her quite easily but not in ten seconds like melee builds seem to be able to.
---
Slow handclap for Bethesda.
---
 **Secret Service Armor:** The Ghillie Suit skin no longer obstructs the player’s view in first-person. 
---
hmmm we'll see about that! or maybe we wont....
---
unless they screw up the login service again..
---
Can we get Survival back for those of us who actually liked it?
---
&gt; Fixed and issue 
---
Heh.
---
9.157Gb update on PS4.
---
Why is it names Version 1.41 why not name it the same as the update Version 21.....
---
As we all know Microsoft is a jerk too, but I wonder if it would act the same as Sony if it had the best selling console?
---
Possibly. I'm just trying spark discussion and community. You made some good points! I remember a game called FATE on the PC that was an rpg and you could get a pet and while you were in a dungeon you could send it off to sell your stuff for you. It would definitely be neat to do that!
---
I don't know, don't play mmo games.
---
Red Rocket  stop can also give some glorious chain reaction explosions
---
unlikely.
---
might eventual be some sort of functionality for private servers in the far future, but thats about the only hope for a survival mode at this point.
---
Happened to me today, fuck them.
---
24 players per server, don't think that qualifies as mmo.
---
Nothing will shrink the griefers. They grief because they can and because they get joy out of their target not being able to retaliate.  As soon as their mark can fight back they turn tail and run. 
---
Suvival got removed because it just wasn’t popular enough.  Why spend the resources on a mode that won‘t have any return on investment?  No one is going to buy FO76 because there’s a survival mode.
---
Few hours
---
Well I remember reading something a while ago: 
---
Someone was speculating that the enclave events where you activate bots and bomb sections of the map was the enclave ACTUALLY hunting for secret underground bases or something of the nature. I would love to see this expanded on if it’s true. 
---
MAYBE THERES A SYNTH BASE UNDER APPALACHIA!?
---
Correct. I believe it was slated for this Friday with QuakeCon but the patch notes make it seem like it'll be after that.
---
How would you know if you don't play them? This game is classified as an MMO
---
oh look, servers are down and all the fanbois are crawling out of their holes :D
---
it's ok buddy, in two hours we won't see you for another two months or so...
---
Ctrl + F. Railway rifle.
---
No results.
---
I'm safe.
---
LMAO stupid
---
UGHHH
---
Tesla rifle. Does same general thing, especially TS
---
It will be ready when the fix for autocompletes is done.  I mean, Ward’s pathing issues were more important.
---
Just like backing out of adrenaline for 1 month and a Colossal Problem?
---
I love my Junkies ffr thing.
---
The power of Google.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game
---
Hah, well it sounds like an interesting thing to try. I'm the total opposite, though. 
---
This is my current build, with a little Tea Shop on the ridge below the Mothman lighthouse.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=67864fa&amp;d=p80pa0p90i30ia0i50ar2ao0e00lt2a21p10p40p30ln0lu2l71se2aj2em1ce0ej4am2a72ss2lq0ii0cr0ll0cj1cd1&amp;m=051c49fe8gh7bad6i&amp;n=Berry%20Eater
---
Basic shrouded wood armour and a basic armour-ignore buff deathclaw gauntlet, and I'm good to explore!
---
Disappointing. Lots more to be fixed and that event which I know many were looking forward to is still not happening.
---
I chuckled as well
---
I put that guitar on the far border of the camp but you still hear the damn thing everywhere. The same freaking tune over and over.
---
**PRO TIP:** Don't nuke Monongah Mine directly, but drop the nuke northwest of it so the mine is juuuust within the blast radius. Makes getting in and out of the mine less of a pain in the ass (and would also spare this guy's camp).
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_ can you PLEASE look into bugs affecting the gauss shotgun (I believe they also apply to the pistol). These include being unable to use stimpacks, reload or sprint while using the gun at times. I am frustrated this was not addressed with this update. This is an end game item and it quite frankly sucks to use.
---
&gt; Secret Service Armor: Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79.
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU...........................................
---
I just bought the arms and was looking for the Deep Pocket Plans last night, couldn't find them so I bought the the Dense Plan...1 more day that is all I needed...Well 3 more days or the Raiders, Settlers, and that taking pictures and I will have enough for the plans...
---
Neither Meat Week or Colossal Problem? Oof
---
Thanks for the reminder. That's the only game my ps4 doesn't automatically update.
---
Patch notes say in the coming weeks. Which sucks. I was so ready for this event. Couldn’t wait to get off work to do it. But plus note is now we can get fixers drops from events and dailies. Fuck yes
---
well idk, it was about sony. microsoft let way more games take advantage on crossplay, even smaller ones which don't have alot of money.   
---
you know why we all wait so long for updates in fallout? becouse sony also takes money to upload patches. sure, microsoft does this aswell, but sony is known for being super expensive and bitchy in certain ways.
---
I never use Fusion Cores. I keep one on me just for when I need my Excavator Power Armor. I will use that Fusion Core until it is gone. I regularly get Fusion Cores as loot though. If it is 100% I will sell it in my Vending Machine, but if it is less than 100 it will never sell. I had 10 in my machine at 98 charge and after a month of continually lowering the prices I finally just tossed them in the blue suit case at the train station. Now any extra fusion cores I just toss in the suit case as they aren't worth their weight to me.
---
They did.
---
I got lucky though that the super mutant suicider was a 3 star legendary so i managed to get that one in
---
Guys did you also hear that the legendary 3 star daily was broken?? I killed like 6 three star robots and none three star raiders idfk what I’m missing here guys!?!?
---
It's cool that (you claim) you fixed the Autocomplete bug, but what will be done to compensate players who suffered (sometimes repeatedly) from the bug?
---
I'm out 8750 points and Support left my ticket open saying there would be news regarding compensation after the patch.
---
Rip mines only 8.10 gb
---
They don't have deadlines. If they had an actual large team working on this game, maybe they could deliver
---
If they keep survival mode permenatly they can make adventure purely PvE /pacifist, forget to write that.
---
I think there will be still a lot who would play that today since adventure pvp got more or less popular.
---
Espicially because of those permanent 1.5x XP boost you had there.
---
Gold will not be Enclave controlled due to the fact they can't reach the Secret Service Bunker
---
Feel free to add me, Newsman77. I'm on most nights after 6pm est.
---
I was up to date, I knew it was happening but I ended up forgetting.. a 30 minute warning would've been better
---
For Hunting Rifle the regular .50 Reciever has more damage than Refined .50 Reciever, which has description stating that it has better damage.
---
Also Hunting Rifle should have Prime .50 Reciever.
---
A failed update once again
---
Besides the secret service doesn't work for them and WILL fight them to protect the gold.
---
okay, collossal problem is delayed, that sucks.   
---
but adrenaline is working again! thats way more important to me and makes a huge difference.  
---
also, the possibility to get secret service and fixers as quest rewards is huge!
---
125.000.000 Steel seems like alot, and it is, but with a dedicated community across all platforms it can be done quite easily. What you have to worry about is if Bethesda servers can handle logging all the scrap and wont crap itself, and stop keeping track or we loose all progress.
---
lol when I read this post I was thinking "he probly means guerilla"
---
Then I opened the link...
---
Love it!  It would also be nice to see the Daily and Weekly Challenges on the home screen before you pic your character.
---
Indeed it was lore, they removed it for this reason and for the vault raids, so they run better.
---
PC-Bethesda is not yet out.
---
I feel like a stuck record... I knew it was happening, a 30 minute counter would've been better
---
I did Google fallout 76 actually:
---
Fallout 76 is an online action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018, it is an installment in the Fallout series and a prequel to previous entries.
---
Not an mmo.
---
Bye now.
---
I always almost level up right before I go to bed so K only need a few hundred experience the next day.
---
If I may venture a little advice. Lose the lock picking hacking and scrapper perks and only use them when u need them.  I’d recommend the melee perk in intelligence to 4 points so you’re weapons have Longer durability and the 3 in agility move where you like as u still have 4 point in it once your done
---
"Remaining edge cases" haha what is this like those brownie trays that are shaped to provide the most possible edge? 😂
---
Corvega Water Purifiers
---
I can remember Beth saying they will bring mod support to private servers.
---
yeah they show as favorited, but not in the menu, so I have unfavorite both of them and refavorite them.
---
Also a plasma grenade goes through the map if you look down at your feet in third person and throw it
---
The tier 3 and tier 4 community rewards will be our compensation, watch. (double points and extra challenges) 
---
I'm out like 26k points from the auto complete bug.
---
Right ? And when is that damn Scorchbeast DNA project going to publish results ?
---
Yeah wtf mate. I guess we have the new community event. That probably gives the same rewards we've had a few times now. Was really looking forward to something new to kill
---
Why would you need a 30 minute warning if you knew the time the servers were coming down? 
---
You just weren’t paying attention is all and now your paused you screwed up and want everyone to blame Bethesda for your screw up.
---
Right after he mow's down a bunch of other apes with dual LMGs
---
I’m guessing the marketing team didn’t realize how difficult it’d be to have a persistent server in FO76 as they’d have to: 
---
create a system where they can still upload content to a server that will never reset. 
---
Redo the algorithm for lootable objects as 76 doesn’t have junk items and some enemies that respawn w/ time. They just reset every time a new server is created. 
---
Offloading assets to player’s device so they can function independent of Bethesda servers.
---
This update might as well mean bringing mods into the game, so they would have to figure out how private server mods affect public server gameplay. 
---
I’m sure there’s others but those are just the reasons I’ve discussed with others. Bethesda needs to be more transparent about this crap, but I definitely understand why it’s taken them so much longer. I know the devs want modding in their games as it takes a lot of the pressure off them to provide new content and they could focus on big dlc rather than atomic shop items. It’d take ppl who know what they’re doing to implement and I think their devs have been racing just to make this game decent enough to turn a good profit.
---
Frank Horrigan WAS secreat service the enclave has had the secret service working for them already, the roots of the enclave are planted very very deep within post war government leftovers/projects
---
Unless it's put down camps or maybe stay alive for 10 minutes, I don't bother with them
---
It was never on Xbox prior to the Treasure Hunter Event.
---
Make sure you have a vending machine powered up so you appear on the map.  If you are seen, most people will spare your camp, if there is enough space.  I am near the whitespring, which gets nuked a bunch?  Since I put up a vending machine, no one has nuked me.
---
That’s the thing, bloodied builds get too much damage for too low of a risk. With things like bolstering or unyielding armor, serendipity or emergency protocols, nerd rage, bloodied builds are getting 2x or more damage with only a slightly higher chance of duing
---
The stuck record is you.
---
What plans are those?
---
Who knows when we'll even get a colossal problem. In the coming weeks they said. Phft
---
I came here to say the poodle skirt! And the chandelier that's like an atom burst.
---
I use them. Not as practical weapons, but because it’s often hilarious to hear ‘ughuhuhuhuh!’ in the middle of a firefight, and especially when fighting the queen.
---
I mostly just want to level up so i can use all the weapons ive collected and so i dont get bodied by every single creature i see when im exploring.
---
I'm a fanboy now because you don't know about microtransactions? 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction#History
---
Your logic is fucking stupid. I'm done here. Your replies will not be read.
---
Is that est?
---
So basically no contents and no QOL improvement. They wouldn't have released this patch, it would have been the same.
---
Tired of Bethesda fixing bugs literally no one cares. Yet the most critical ones never get attention. It's almost like they are doing on purpose.
---
Gauss Rifle VATS bug? No?
---
Team leader active quest not showing? No?
---
Fast travel bugs? No?
---
I would say that being the thin power-armored line between between Site Alpha and the rest of Appalachia was 'doing some shit' as you put it. Hell, they held them back for years (?) and even all-but wiped out the threat, sadly not realising there was a Queen pushing out babies beyond their reach. If you want to see an Appalachia without the Brotherhood, take a look at the pre-Wastelanders worldspace. Once they were gone the Scorched got everyone and killed/infected everyone.
---
Brotherhood hate is very popular here, while the Raiders from Crater have an odd amount of apologists I'll note, but it's a matter of record in game that the Brotherhood was all that was holding the Scorched back, and once they fell so did Appalachia. It's in various notes and holotapes. Defiance falling was the hammerblow that felled the rest of the region.
---
Like them or not, you have to give them credit, they died trying to protect the people of Appalachia. That's worthy of respect, if nothing else.
---
Damn that's so odd. So you still have the mission active right?
---
Lucky you, I got two walking canes and one sickle yesterday, all one star from the queen.
---
They should call it the disapointer. Nobody who’s used one expecting total death and destruction from a mini nuke has failed be utter disapointed at how piss weak they are.
---
I wonder if they fixed the scout version that had the same issue.
---
I misjudged the time and thought it was 4pm my time 
---
I'm not blaming Bethesda, really they've should've done 30 minutes regardless and ofc I'm gonna be pissed 
---
Also, you're* pissed not paused weren't*
---
Seeing as they’re a plan you need to buy with bullion, I’m *certain* them being in the loot table is a bug.
---
1.4GB update on steam
---
She's the kind of gal that likes to roam around, she goes from place to place and go from town to town and when she gets bored she'll be roaming call her the wanderer call her the wanderer she'll roam around around around around
---
Oh, you grammar Nazis.
---
 If enchantments like sentinels only increased the chance of the damage being reduced rather than increasing the damage reduction itself, and just having the reduction at a steady 50%(can't be raised higher). Then it wouldn't be so bad. Assassin's and sentinels and stuff like it break the game.
---
He doesn't exist on the East coast. And besides if you played Wastelanders you'll have seen that the Secret Service in Vault 79 doesn't trust them. So no I don't think they will control gold. Unless there is a mole but that'll still be a tough battle against a T-65 and Secret Service armor.
---
&gt;Fixed an exploit related to scrapping Assaultron Helmets
---
That was not an exploit, that was a legitimate use of game mechanics and an easy way to craft screws. Ugh, now I have to go back to farming screws like some savage.
---
Shotguns, if fired with ADS, have a chance to get stuck partway into the recoil animation. When this occurs, reloading the shotgun is literally the only way to fix it. If you have no extra shells, or it was your first shot after reloading (the shot you fire before this bug occurs doesnt count as being fired), you have no choice but to quit. No pipboy, no map, no menu. Alt-F4 is your only way out unless you can reload.
---
Nooo.. I wanted to get the Wendigo Plushie today.. :(
---
So we now have Pocketed mods for SeSe limbs, what about Ultra Light mods for limbs?
---
Steam is 2.5 gb
---
I hate them as well.  For the level up ones I get on a level 0 character and just stay alive until the 2nd fire closing and thats usually enough to level up.
---
I know and I hate it. I have even considered to jump to Xbox, because Sony seems such a dick. I am still pissed about Skyrim/FO4 mods. 
---
But I am not a fan of Microsoft either, and if it had the top console, I am sure it would use that power wrong way too.
---
That happens to me with the gauss shotgun and the wastelanders gauntlet. Can't sprint, can't stimpak. Very frustrating.
---
Sadly it got delayed...
---
Doesn't that sometimes produce ash piles? It gets impossible to loot meat piles under them if you're unlucky.
---
Why is my update 70.192gbs????? This says 8.7gbs for PS4
---
Edit: I was just playing it last night, was up to date as of yesterday.
---
except it got delayed...again
---
[u/Papa\_Shekels](https://www.reddit.com/user/Papa_Shekels/) Hi op, do you mind adding these bugs to the list?
---
* 250dr while reloading doesn't work if your magazine was emptied before reloading
---
* 250dr while reloading works only for the first second of your reload - even on heavy guns which have a long reload time
---
* Sometimes your shots do more damage than normal you would do, but after short time health goes back to your normal damage - it makes vats totally useless, since after every shot you leave vats, because game this you killed the enemy, but in fact it's still alive
---
* syringer mod count is broken, max count has to be upped by 1 and glow sights doesn't count to mod count
---
* quick hands perk is not working with gatling plasma/laser - instead of reloading cores it uses value of how many cores you have
---
* 90% reduced weight works only on base unmodded weapon
---
* if you want to learn bayonet mod for black powder rifle you have to scrap mod box or modded rifle
---
* radium rifle mods use armor mods chances of learning instead of weapons
---
* rad damage in radium rifle is not boosted by perks or legendary effects
---
That it matters not.  Beth will announce it complete to progress the game.
---
Yeah, if it's the same old stuff they can maybe have some of my cork, glass and  leather but steel and lead stays with me.
---
I tried to get the rest of my daily challenges, couldn’t log on, got this notification

Wish I didn't start the new season 2 weeks late, than I wouldn't have to worry about 100% daily challenges. When it was announced that NW was coming out, I expect some hardcore survival pit taking place immediate after the bombs where you have to deal with terrified animals, cold, starving, thirst, and a low frequency of ammo. Kind of like Frost for Fallout 4, but faster paced and easier.
---
Yiphix, you might want to take your Sarcasm Detector into the shop for inspection.  Appears to be on the fritz.
---
This would be great. Colorado has some amazing geography with the plaines, Rocky Mountains, snows, foot hills, and hell even sand dunes down south. There is also plenty of lore with the airforce academy being located here, the presidential bunker, and all the wildlife they can add to the game as new animals.
---
hhah.  i drop them and it says they will be destroyed. Im like  I hope forever
---
It's like they released these weapons without any sort of testing. They want you to grind for a month to get them only to find out they are a buggy mess. How many people are working on this game? Less than 5? This is pathetic.
---
Scorched can spawn as legendary enemies but it seems to be less of a chance than compared to other enemy types.
---
All the waiting for yet another Promise ; (
---
Can I propose to move the Studio to Poland? Thank me later
---
Just confirming. Mine is also 49.64GB
---
I have added wall light sconce penises to all my cardboard standees because I'm an immature 12 year old under this fat gut and receding hairline.
---
Hell I remember when Gun Fu was broken for at least as long.  Maybe some care was put into this patch and another perk didn’t get broken.  Could you imagine them breaking starched genes? Bwhahaha
---
I am saddened at the prospect of not being able to pull a fast one on ward each day, and having to actually go out in the world and find crap for him.  It’s been good while it lasted.
---
Synths definitely don't exist until over 100 years later.
---
Odd, Xbox was slow for a bit during the duping boom but I have all plans at 1/10 price and went from 120 to 60 for sale the other day. The ultracite sold out fast.
---
Advice taken, thank you, but that's not really the aim of this character, you know?
---
Hacker, Scrapper and Lockpick are part of her personality. She stepped out of Vault 76, and decided the best way to deal with the apocalypse, was to scavenge stuff and make a tea shop. She's eaten far too many irradiated-berries, hence all the mutations, and she's a little funny in the head. Hence the Last Laugh perk, which is also the perk I love sharing the most.
---
You can go for all-out, optimized min-maxing, or have a little personality in there. I'd rather have a character than a titan, heh.
---
Colossal problem is delayed and they fixed stuff that really wasn’t an issue like assaultron helmets, foundations, and nuke silos? Classic Bethesda. I’ll bet ya everything that is negatively bugged is still bugged because these are somehow better issues. Oh and they only added pocketed mods for the secret service armor? Ultra-light didn’t exist either but I bet they didn’t even know that since they don’t play their own game
---
It’s because they can’t be fixed.
---
Nope, this is fallout 76 players after this patch.
---
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClhH0CCVYAENX_W.jpg
---
Waiting for the event.
---
For weeks it’s delayed again but again plus is fixer now can drop for events and dailies
---
Dont kill, just tag at start of wave. But yes it can if you kill
---
be glad it's not downvoted, I keep mentioning the bug and questioning how it still exists for so long and people just downvote for giggles. Anyway, I was going to make a new thread on the forums and even here about it, but I will not, I am fucking tired. Another patch hits today with no fixes regarding this, it's demoralizing.
---
I used to have a bunch in an outhouse surrounding the toilet. This was also the spot where people spawned in when they fast travelled to my C.A.M.P.
---
Finally deep pocket mods for Secret Service armor!
---
Alleluja!
---
I just look at it as like "we can't mod it because all the plans are in Chinese!"
---
The thing is impossible to complete without a bloodied build. Thats not fine
---
Except you can’t farm colossal problem since it’s delayed by their incompetent morons
---
my AA/50%LD gauss pistol does less damage than a  10mm, I just don't get it
---
I would love some modification that makes it wieldable in power armor.
---
Youre going to need to upload a video of what you are talking about. This incredibly vague "it wont let me" isnt going to get you any help at all.
---
Yeah, burner accounts are very useful, but take forever to make with Bethesda's windowsXP level systems
---
Yeah I just saw it...
---
Nope. Who knows when we'll get it
---
No worries at all. Sounds like you know what your doing, and like my melee, which is utterly useless outside of the end game fights I feel, it’s playing the game the way u want to. Maybe I’ll come visit sometime. What’s your gt. I like tea
---
Brotherhood arrives to find their mail slot jammed with 78 thousand user manuals for Mr handy robots and vault dwellers grinning and expecting a thank you.
---
Hoping this extends to creatures.  Not sure of any event that drops 3* anything as a reward for finishing other than fasnacht
---
Pretty much the same now
---
I come from the future. The event is still not live. No surprise really it is Bethesda
---
&gt; **Scrapping:** Fixed an issue that caused crafting to use Junk items from the player’s Inventory and Stash before using their available Scrap. Crafting, building, and repairing now utilize the player’s Scrap and Junk in the following order of priority
---
Wow, that one is huge for collectors.
---
Bat Kings, I would say.
---
😂
---
I didn't see them give a mention on the Queen cripple bug. Did I just miss it? I thought they said patch 21 for it
---
They didn’t add the other misc mods like ultra light though. Makes perfect sense doesn’t it.
---
Not sure why the downvotes.  If there are double digit people working on this game, actual coders, not art people, I’d be honestly surprised.
---
Nothing against the art group though, they’ve been kicking butt the whole time I think.
---
It may be overly selfish of me, but that's not a compensation in my book, since I would have done them in any case, and people who didn't get the bug also get to do them.
---
The bug exists in the first place because Bethesda decided to ignore it for well over a year when it was convenient, since the challenges used to give atoms. Bethesda also decided not to put a mock Legendary Run system in the PTS, which is another reason why the bug persisted in the live version of the game.
---
I planned to finish the run with a few weeks to spare so that I could take a little break from the game. I don't want, and honestly shouldn't have to wait until a community event unlocks bonus challenges for everyone, to make up for something that should absolutely not have happened in the first place.
---
Just give me the equivalent in atoms, which I'll totallly use to level up, and let's get this over with.
---
Earle Williams and players pointing angrily at Bethesda
---
Bethesda *cat face*
---
Wtf this is bullshit. I'm fucking over it I'll go back to playing Outer World's and CoD
---
Scorchbeast Queen can’t be crippled or what Bethesda?
---
And don't forget the secret service Armor!
---
Agreed. I want somewhere to show off weapons and bobbleheads, but without deleting my budget. I just hope they give us lots of options for interiors.
---
I've been creating new characters, they level up pretty quick for the first 5 levels. Honestly I wouldn't bother with doing them at all if it wasn't for all challenges that I don't get to complete due to work and other responsibilities. I gotta make every opportunity count if I wanna get to level 100.
---
**"Art:** In the Wastelander Photomode Frame, Vault Boy now has a rifle over his shoulder instead of a Laser Musket"
---
Thank fuck the game is playable again.
---
Any update on the munitions ammo factory blueprint exploit?
---
I like the idea but I can just imagine how many things they would break trying to implement it.
---
Me: knock knock
---
Bethesda: you’ll have to nuke the mine to open it
---
Me: well that escalated quickly
---
It's a glitch its really 8 hogs But will make you download the entire 50 pretty lame
---
1. Figure out how you are going to make you're daily caps from the Robot Vendors.  Some players make purified water farms and sell water, some scavenge weapons and sell those, and others gather higher cap items like Straight Jackets. 
---
2. Once you can get your daily cap limit, you'll find that after a couple of weeks you'll have a bunch of caps to spend.  You can then do things like browse other vending machines for deals that you can resell at higher prices or replace what you have and sell your old items.  You can also invest in things like serum recipes and make and sell serums (be prepared to spend time farming raw flux and the ingredients needed to make it stable.  It's not that hard, just can be time consuming).
---
3. Place your CAMP somewhere near the areas surrounding WhiteSprings and Top of the World.  This is where most people like to shop player vending machines first.  Most places near water or resource nodes (such as lead, acid, etc)  are highly popular so you'll get a lot of "can't place CAMP" messages.  You're kind of limited if you plan on farming water using large purifiers.  However, if you're using another method to make caps then you can place it in unique spots.
---
4. Set up Vending machines.  Most sell a mix of plans, legendaries, and ammo.  Some make and sell chems.  When I was starting out I found that taking workshops and doing Power UP events at the power plants gave me a steady source of stimpaks and building plans.  So, I would sell plans, dog food, 100% fusion cores (from the fusion core generator at power plants) and legendaries.  Of course, pricing matters also.  
---
Between the daily cap limit and your vending machines you'll find that you'll have to worry about it less.
---
The contemporary set, it feels like something that could be permanent. That set is what I need for my build to match the surrounding area.
---
So wtf are they adding today then.
---
You bet your ass we are expecting a thank you without shit eating grins and over enthusiastic need for adhesive and screws.
---
Yes, thanks! I'm on PC! My IGN is Pueo.
---
I was being sarcastic, but watch it be the case.
---
I've never played NW, just not something I'm interested in.  
---
I don't think you need the SCORE from those challenges to finish the season. I'm sitting at rank 70 without them.  
---
EDIT: and people have reported finishing the whole board already by grinding the 10k XP reward.
---
All of these issues can easily be fixed. Most of them were introduced in recent patch.
---
Doesn't look like it.  https://bethesda.net/community/topic/421994/fallout-76-update-21-patch-notes-august-4-2020?language%5B%5D=en
---
Gotta be on that grind for that pack
---
Would that be better or worse than mounting a Santa Crash on its butt?
---
I wish they did something other than make a noise.
---
Here we go again.
---
&gt; Scrap and Junk in the following order of priority:
---
&gt; * Scrap in the player’s Inventory
---
&gt; * Scrap in the Stash
---
&gt; * Scrap in the Fallout 1st Scrapbox
---
&gt; * Junk in the player’s Inventory **will be auto-scrapped**
---
&gt; * Junk in the Stash **will be auto-scrapped**
---
I don't think that auto-scrapping is ok, RIP collected toys...
---
edit: fixed qoute
---
Farming megasloths is a super easy way to get screws
---
As someone who works in software QA... do you want it now? Or do you want it right?  
---
Given Bethesda's track record as of late, I'd rather them take a little extra time to make sure it works before they just blindly throw it out there.
---
Congratulazioni, abitante del Vault!
---
I thought it was supposed to be 13gb for XB1.  Not sure how big my update is but it’s currently going so hopefully it’ll be ready when the maintenance is done.
---
Good point, if I really wanted them, I'd just get 30,000 XP to get 50 more S.C.O.R.E and be more amused the whole time.
---
Let me at least provide the flux. Hardly struggling in that department. Just road leathers would be great. I can make those as well if you don't already have the recipe.
---
Thought you were OP, I guess.
---
It doesn't help with this type of lag but it made loading faster for me... the lag is still there in the menus. Also sorting aid items by Spoil makes the game freeze for a few secs each time you open that tab...
---
You can scrip gauss weapons btw
---
Honestly, about 400 or so. I haven’t really cared to keep it around in vast quantities til a couple days ago. I only have that much because golf balls are a good source of plastics. I have also probably sold off 2-3 times that much cork to vendors for my daily caps.
---
The result was that everyone died in the end. They failed in their goal because they saw themselves as superior to everyone else, refused to work with other factions, continuously put themselves in bad situations, and believed they had a claim to all resources. 
---
They could have survived if they actually worked with everyone and made pacts with groups such as the Responders to ensure both group's safety. They could have survived if they actually studied the Scorched and attempted to stop the spread through science instead of sending their best men to the lair of scorched to be killed. They could have survived if they ensured the group's safety by locating somewhere safer like the new BoS is now. 
---
They put all of their eggs in one basket and were shocked when things didn't work out. There's a difference between bravery and plain stupidity.
---
i think xbox has better performance and more power, but don't relay on this info.
---
why not pc? most power, best performance, best modsupport and little to no downside compared to consoles - except the needed knowledge and possibilities to screw stuff up if you don't know what you're doing.
---
Dammit. I'm was an English major and I'm stumped. I'm sticking with my first answer, but I'm now questioning everything. You have broken my brain.
---
I actually had to force download it under manage game.  Might be worth doing that so you’ll be ready to go when the servers are back online.
---
I get the feeling their implementation won't be nearly as useful as the mod is.
---
5-6 weeks between patches and that's all we get?
---
This also happened to me on PS4
---
Yeah but I already took my 2 months of rolls to finally get all 3 star unyielding armor. But will be nice to get ones with weapon weight reduction
---
Can we get said IRL plushies lifesized?
---
nope, they want to do some more testing and shit :(
---
Bug fixes and giving handouts to the BoS
---
A junk sink that awards items from the treasure hunter pails and holiday present loot pools.
---
Yeah, except they got the resources to put more software engineers and QA engineers to deliver faster. Which they don't. That's what people are complaining here. Tired of the false promises always.
---
I completely agree with you. I'd rather have it right. But I mean, it's been in a PTS for well over a month now. Their ability to find last minute problems is legendary.
---
*40mm Grenade Round has entered the chat*  
---
Hello, my paper bag drop friend!
---
Well, since you asked politely:
---
When I examined the sonic emitter there was no action prompt.  That is, it didn't say E) Interact or E) shut the damn thing off.
---
I naturally assumed that this meant that I couldn't actually interact with it.  Perhaps this was because the event wasn't running, perhaps because the game code is notoriously buggy.  Either seemed possible.
---
It DID show a partially depleted health bar so I immediately tried to shoot it.  Sadly even an armor piercing explosive weapon did not damage it in the slightest.
---
At that point, with the sound literally maddening me, I came to the one place I knew I could find people who actually play the game and might be able to help me.  They were able to do so within 2m.
---
Very true I did not think of that
---
Why limit building even more? Because a lot of people really enjoy building, and because at least 90% of what they focus on with these patches is making sure nothing is too easy for players. If there's a bug that benefits players, they're all over fixing it. If the bug messes things up for us, it goes to the bottom of the to do list.
---
Okay boys and girls time to get a shit ton of cloth
---
Gather all your prewar money I want that collectron station
---
At least there's progress being made on streamlining the ammo converter.
---
Resets Monday if it isn't bugged. If it is bugged, you're screwed for a week like me last week.  I instead bought a serum recipe.
---
Just start a new character &amp; delete them each time. You level up ridiculously fast in the first levels. All you need is a new toon and a bush to hide in for a bit and you've got it locked.
---
Well it's certainly unique.
---
yeah i have learned you can only turn them in one at a time with a quest only. any extras in your inventory are useless
---
Don’t give them ideas about starched genes...
---
On the positive side, fixers and ss armor will now be in the drop pool. Gives me hope ss armor will soon be a tradable item.
---
Content.
---
Yeah this is pretty standard with games.  Division 2 had their big update 10(?) and on the forums it was referred to as TU10 (title update 10) but when it came out it was actually like version 1.234 (not sure what the actual number was but it wasn’t 10.x or even 1.10)
---
Hey, don’t forget to include the missile launcher when taking about disappointment. It fires queefs shaped like missiles.
---
We really need a lock item system that requires 30 seconds to unlock/lock.
---
Yep not infuriating at all..
---
Glad to see some new rewards for Meat Week! New pocketed SS armor mods and more rewards in the event loot pool as well. And the Ammo converter changes are sweet. 
---
Good update for me.
---
Am happy that they fixed Adrenaline, but I'm really waiting for Legendary perks. 
---
Been waiting for these for over a year now...oh well, maybe they'll eventually release them. Though it is good that they didn't release them when they clearly weren't too well designed...
---
&gt;Nuke Silos: Fixed a location in the Reactor Room where players could get out of world and skip portions of the Nuke Silo.
---
I hope this isn't the power armor skip, I can't be bothered to run the whole silo if they don't guarantee a 3* legendary from queen.
---
Oh so still no colossal problem......
---
&gt;WAKE UP
---
Oh I am awake and aware. i just don't get bent out of shape like a child over trivial things like a video game.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-update-21-patch-notes-august-4-2020
---
This is just disappointing and extremely frustrating given the games current state.
---
Great!  Is 'thesurgeo01" your IGN? l'll find your camp and make the purchase. Thanks!
---
From what i understand, this should give a brand new community event, while we get ready for the brotherhood of steal update later this year.
---
Well that's good news that I totally missed when I was reading the notes! Yay!
---
If they could be fixed it wouldn’t be going on for 18 months. It can’t be fixed. Only bandaged.
---
I wouldn't hold your breath on anything
---
Edit, these road maps seem a lot like the pirate code. More like guide lines.
---
I'm still not seeing anything there either unfortunately. 
---
Also this game takes up nearly 70GB on Xbox.
---
Nobody worked together properly, it's cited plainly that if everyone had worked together that would have been able to win, but you seem to be holding them to a unique and impossible standard.
---
Everyone died in the end because everyone failed to work together, but, the Brotherhood died first, died fighting, and died trying to end the threat and only failing due to lack of intel about the Queen existing.
---
Also, I believe they did have a pact with the Responders, and that it was the Responders who pulled back due to lack of belief in the scale of the threat, though my memory is sketchy on the details. I'm pretty certain that the Brotherhood didn't start being pushy about supplies until they were getting desperate.
---
Are the extra months and years of not being killed or turned Scorched worth nothing? Because even if in the end the line failed, they held it to that end, and bought Appalachia the time needed for the rest of the measures we finish to be where they were when we picked up the work.
---
Wellll... One Wateland most likely will be pushed to patch23 or more... but I hope I am wrong.
---
If there are no new plans than duper’s have no reason to donate.
---
I was just going along with the theme of not seeing why the servers were down.
---
The Colossal Event being postponed again really is a slap in the face for the whole playerbase.
---
Doing this once, sure thing. But doing something like this twice just shows how incapable Bethesda is at prioritizing what's coming for the next patch cycle.
---
la la la la.
---
Any chance of taking a break from the constant daily challenge of killing 1-3 legendaries? It's getting a little boring now 🙄
---
Yeah, but most events and quests only give out 1-star legendary rewards, so hopefully the loot pool of bosses has been updated as well.
---
You dont need the launch the nuke directly on the center of the mine lol its exactly like the scorch queen fight where you just need it to be inside the red circle. That's all
---
I think this is a semi know bug.  Most flaming items do not work with friendly fire post Wastelanders.  Hopefully they get addressed soon.
---
Bruh it’s not ‘that sort of stuff’, put a hat on her and you’ll understand why she badly needs a bath.
---
I know alot of people say for the silm and original its not the full ssd experience but even if its just a 30 percent decrease in loading times, 76 is a game I fast travel ALOT.
---
However some additional info based on various post on this sub. There was this one dude who claimed he owned all 3 versions of the Ps4 and that the original was the best optimized. So unfortunately framerates and stuttering might stay the same.
---
Hes been quarantined, they caught him traveling without a mask
---
You're nuking American soil. It's not bad, it's actually justice /s
---
who would've thought, adding a simple new event would take 3 freaking updates.
---
Don't forget the auto complete challenges.  No further word on those at all.  Is there any communication at all?
---
Ill do the same. I am well ahead in the Run, I can skip a few NW challenge...
---
Wait what half of the new Ms fligth simulator player base will do in about 5days and a month
---
The "letter box" you push that shit through has a direct connection to an incinerator below the camp. 
---
It's the BoS version of a spam folder.
---
The Disapointer and The LetDown.
---
Well, melons are food and water in one package, don't require boiled water (annoying to collect), and easy to farm.  They're my current staple "survival" food.
---
Brain Fungus Soup (easy to farm) + Corn Soup + Relish is a powerful way to keep your AP up and stacking Intelligence/raw XP boosts.
---
Thats a good idea. I usually have morning time on xbox so I usually get to just about the next level and then quit for the next day, but I still had a little while to go today because I had a zoom meeting this morning. Oh well, I will be just about to the next level when it comes back and may have some time this afternoon
---
What did I miss?
---
Ha, the servers must be back up here (cst) but i have a 75 minute update!!!! Guess I won't be playing before work. :/.
---
I have over 9,000 atoms and plan on buying the rest of the levels I don't complete.
---
If they will add let's say 10 more public events and 20 more normal events, I would probably not get bored of  the game
---
No sleep till Brooklyn, Ward.
---
Well, it’s being added, just not enabled, so all the data for it will be there till they hit the switch.
---
I don't know why they're banned, I never saw the post if there was one but I'm glad.
---
Nobody agrees on what's worthy of being posted when it comes to pics imo.
---
I saw so many camp pictures where people were SO PROUD of what they built.  And yet their camp was awful.  But you're not allowed to say that.  So everyone fawns all over it, saying how great a job they've done, and in reality, it's a boring camp with nothing special.
---
Or "look what I found!" With a picture of a creature or place that nobody else could POSSIBLY have seen before.  &gt;.&gt; Then they add some dumb joke or make a sad attempt at a meme to the picture of an a creature we've all seen 10000000 times since release.
---
I think outfit identification posts should be allowed, assuming we can't find the info elsewhere (the wiki's are NOT complete) though.
---
I'd like to see the "I dropped my first nuke tonight!" Posts nixed as well.  Nobody cares.  How does that post benefit the sub?
---
Hahahaha some people just wanna watch the world burn. 
---
Me? This will be my magnum opus. 
---
I think it might be Fat Men 
---
Men is the plural of Man. That’s the hard and fast rule I keep coming back to....
---
But what about Mankind? 
---
It’s not Menkind and we know it’s definitely not Peoplekind .... 
---
Together we ponder 🤔
---
Yeah and secret service armor also as long as you know the plans. So I am hoping to get a better fixer. I have gotten a bloodied fixer from purveyor but it is 250 damage resistance while reloading and 50 more critical damage. Got the armor I want took me forever to get 3 star unyielding but I want weapon weight reduction pieces
---
 **Nuclear** launch **codes** expire weekly on Mondays at 7pm ET 
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/43880/\~/why-are-my-nuclear-launch-codes-disappearing-in-fallout-76%3F](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43880/~/why-are-my-nuclear-launch-codes-disappearing-in-fallout-76%3F)
---
So, yes, they would have changed about 5 hours earlier.  Typically the codes on Nukacrypt are updated relatively quickly but it does take actual players to find all of the code pieces, solve the codes, then update Nukacrypt, it's not an automated process.  So launching on a Monday night, unless you are solving it yourself, can be hit or miss.
---
Where is the /s (for sarcasm if anyone does know- was new to me recently) then!!!!  Jk jk good call on that but they are linked for anyone that is curious.  Have a good one!
---
You are way too optimistic about them my dude
---
doesnt even matter if they are going to be 1\* only
---
The lack of new content in patch 21
---
They should have stayed out of Pearl Harbor.
---
No fix for "magic" weapons? Guess I'll melt &amp; farm more SBQ while it lasts lol.
---
And I bet things will still get auto scrapped out of display cases.
---
Fail Mob
---
None man. Just a vision. A dark vision involving cults.....
---
Just pulled the weather report from
---
Hiroshima that day.....huge cloud over the city and its 26000 degrees
---
She spawns frequently at Camden Park for me. There's a tent way in the back of the grassy/picnic area where there's some random encounters. I think that's where I also encountered the raider punk.
---
I’m pretty sure they said it is updated and that’s why this is added fixer and armor. It’s all going to be updated I swear I read that so it means all stars
---
Except there's a holotape where you can hear Taggerdy having a disccusion with Maxson about using nukes. She's willing to but he tells her off. And on her terminal there's an entry that contains this: "**One way or another, if Touchdown fails the nuclear option may be our only option. Maxson's orders be damned."** So she was willing to use nukes. Just never had a chance to.
---
And as for the cure? Responders did that. Claire Hudson was the person working on the cure at AVR Medical Center and she was a Responder not Free States. Free States did have the early warning system.
---
Colossal Problem was delayed.
---
Crap I now realize I was also late to the t65 camo skin trick. Just some days and I would have been golden.
---
Then do not do it? People should stop making videogames a chore, they are for fun
---
Issa game man. Chill.
---
71.5
---
Didn’t they always say patch 21 would be focussed on primarily bug fixes? They mentioned that in at least two ITV articles.
---
Isn't the wording on the mutation "plants give double the benefit" or something?  So 10% stock x2 = 20% herbivore
---
Did not think about that. But then it’s more the cooking menu or swapping items in my stash. It’s just constant lag.
---
Remember when they said that the SBQ being unable to be crippled would be fixed in this patch?
---
Peppridge farm remembers
---
Where do you find a constant spawn for them ?
---
Likely gone forever.
---
You should go play something else then.
---
The assaultron helmets was a HUUUUUGE issue, can't let people stockpile screws now can we? heh.
---
Tell me about some plague cause by giant bats killing people all over Appalachia...
---
Feel bad too?
---
Fuck them
---
I just use any grenades to flush out critters for easy pickens in stealth mode. Lol
---
Because I would not know what I am doing. I have zero interest in tech, but love games.
---
And I probably wont have money for next gen, so I will be playing my PS4 until me or it dies.
---
I have no idea what I'm doing, haha!
---
I just know I've gotten too powerful in Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim and FO4. Once that happens, every single time, I get bored of the character and abandon it shortly after.
---
I'm IdlePX on Steam. I'm still kinda new to 76, so I'm not sure how adding friends and such works yet in-game.
---
Hmmm. I may hold off then. Not worth spending cash on something that possibly won’t fix it.
---
If the bug benefits players in any way, they're all over it. If it makes life harder for us, it goes to the bottom of the list.
---
Okay, Jokes over, where’s the real patch notes?
---
All roadmaps are guides. They aren’t and can’t be set in stone.
---
I typically only need a few minutes as long as I have time to set it up the night before.
---
&gt; I'm out like 26k points from the auto complete bug.
---
That's just sad. There must be something you're doing that keeps causing it, RNG would never do that to a poor single soul. ;-) I've had zero autocompletes, and I'll keep my fingers crossed.
---
Yeah, that's what I plan on doing from now on
---
That's what I understood. I think they used the phrase "few weeks". Something to that effect. So it'll probably be going on when meat week is.
---
I was in a salty mood and I should say: this sub has virtually no spam and no self promotion so maybe the mods are doing more that I was giving them credit for.  Thank you, mods. Thmods.
---
Okay that is good to hear, thanks!
---
Please, elaborate
---
Anything that benefits the player.
---
Likely Im putting my Money on The Pitt from Fallout 3 being the Expedition, there are several Fallout 3 and Pit DLC Specific Atom store items that got datamined a while back (Auto-Axe, R91 Assault Rifle skin etc)... AS Well as that Bethesda always has a habit of subtly mentioning the upcoming locations of the next game/DLC Etc, and in this case the most commonly mentioned via NPC location outside of WV is the settlers largely regarding how life was at the Pitt. how they're glad they escaped the pitt etc.
---
Looks like this is patched as of today as an FYI...per patch notes:
---
**Nuclear Winter:** Fixed an issue in which previous limited-time Nuclear Winter Challenges were available and could be still completed past their end-dates.
---
My Elder paint better let me just walk right in (so I can blow them up from the inside.)
---
Right. Play stupid games...
---
Gotcha. Doesn’t seem like a huge deal but I know people are upset
---
From posts I’ve read, legendary perks weren’t slotted until patch 22 anyways, been that way for some time since they started reworking them. 
---
I’m actually happy with a lot of them, even as rank 1 many of them are very good (extra perk points for characters?  Chems that restore all hp, food, water, and cure disease?  +3 lockpicking /hacking?  
---
I still wish there were more, and I wish the coins you earned were a little faster, but I’m far happier than the first iteration we saw
---
Yes I actually looted two explosive miniguns from legendary scorched near fissure site prime, but very very rare.
---
Of course we (I) want it right and so does everyone else. The point im trying to make is why not just wait until patch 22 to release it? Why put it in now and tease us, knowing it will probably release one week before patch 22. Im just saying there is no reason to add it until its completely ready and done.
---
no wonder you failed...   explosive does nothing to her, as well as SMG.  now imagine if the other group also used equally useless weapon.
---
That just makes me picture going into a station and seeing 15 glitched companions lagging out the server
---
"Today's update brings a new public event 'A Colossal Problem'"...em no it doesn't. Can't describe how utterly bad this looks.
---
This is my point
---
That's actually sad, I always thought it was cool.
---
Maybe they're figuring out the physics on how blasting something with a nuke can open up a mine door.
---
I love them now too. Break ‘em out during Line In the Sand with my tent up (giggity) in the corner so they all spawn in a giant mass.
---
Yeah, I'd rather it not be ontop of meat week. Things spread out are kinda nice.
---
Let us sell them to vendors.
---
I know right. I was so excited, I phoned home and told the wife to put on the red panties tonight.
---
well if you dont know, now you know.   Thanks.  ill try again tonight.
---
No. Not gonna nerf the overall experience just because some scrub thinks Fallout should be Call of Duty.
---
 "**Foundations:** Fixed an issue where foundation pieces could be built in invalid circumstances. "  
---
Aww man I hope not, that allowed for some fun creative builds....
---
When killing the queen finally takes.
---
they talked about those in the patch notes didn’t they?
---
Fun Fact, the reason Kokura  wasnt nuked was because it had too much cloud cover on the day, so Nagasaki was nuked instead
---
Agree fully. Adventure is very easy at the moment and no real challenge.
---
DEEP POCKETS
---
There's a guaranteed spawn southwest of Mosstown that I just server hop to farm.
---
What about magic junkies?
---
Really are the same plans?????
---
I have an update for PS4 90 minutes 😬
---
A Colossal Problem
---
&gt;Please note: Today’s update brings the new Public Event “A Colossal Problem” to the game. However, we are still making some performance tweaks and doing additional testing before we enable the event. We are planning to make “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the **next couple of weeks.**
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
This was day one of the event going live. I did the one daily and saw that my weeklies were completed and had no points to show for it. It's happened randomly since.
---
Something something, triggers to super duper, something something.
---
On my full Bloodied + UY + Adrenal Gauss Shotgun build, I should be doing \~1800-2000+ damage, but I've noticed this as well.  Not as often, but it's not just there.  Since the last update, the servers have been really unreliable and dragging ass on many things including recognizing damage.
---
Yes, this does work.  
---
For example, if you start a new character you'll find that things like scrapping, cooking, etc. are lag free.  But as you acquire stuff in your inventory you'll find that it gradually becomes horribly slow.  
---
I notice that the PC guys in videos don't seem to have this issue, so maybe it's a PS4 platform resource problem and not a back end issue.  It'll be interesting to see if this is any better on the the PS5, which is supposed to be released later this year.
---
Can Xbox and PC player not meet?
---
Also, oh, man! Isn't that a bit too much? Haha!
---
No fun allowed only grinding
---
Because other have the super duper perk.
---
"Don't worry Brotherhood of steel, we've prepared for your arrival - here is your 200 million cork. You're welcome."
---
*insert "curb your enthusiasm" credits here*
---
They'll probably dump it on us during meat week and really just clusterfuck that week.
---
at least the legendary scrap machine tells you after you've exceeded the limit, as does your "Max caps" wallet message
---
Well don't we all feel cucked
---
The combat shotgun VATS vs no VATS damage bug is very interesting... I feel like the out of VATS damage is very weak / rubber banding, but I am not sure
---
People play wargames/shooters all the time and there is always a war going on somewhere.
---
Playing games like CoD or Battlefield is much more questionable, if we want to think gaming this way.
---
That would be great, but can it handle Super Duper and other perks?
---
Unless they added something at the last second, it'll be the same plans from those two events.
---
I know just stupid you can’t.
---
Okay ill be honest i have no idea what magic means. But also yeah.
---
Also the fact that they don’t tell us it’s being delayed until the day of
---
You added pocketed and deep pocketed to SS armour, but not Light and Ultra Light. It may seem like a small thing, but I am *deeply* disappointed.
---
I don't expect any of those 3 you mentioned.  Maybe maybe steel down if its just some small quests like the sheepsquatch,but the other two are totally not coming.
---
EST eastern standard time, USA.
---
kek
---
Good to know. I’ll keep that in mind. 👍
---
Nananah, I do enjoy the game, I'm just saying finishing the run will break my newly acquired daily routine, and I'll have to find a new routine to focus on.
---
Server hop.
---
Got almost the entire list of challenges done in 1 Uranium Fever.
---
gross children
---
I am expecting these to come in... Well now we are at update 21, ok, in update 76 or update 101
---
They’re probably getting rid of underground camps
---
50 gb update on windows store yikes
---
It should
---
Someone said if you put the seat on the edge of something she can't get in the seat as much and so she doesn't play as often.
---
lol.  Happens to the best of us!
---
Alright, first FO76 post of the day is info about the downtime. Excellent, a good post to inform the player base of what’s going on in game. 
---
I’ll sell Fixers for 1 cap if I don’t see another post today asking about login issues.
---
First off, the one requesting that much resources is not BOS but the Russell guy and Bethesda. Second, nobody care if u r donating or not
---
And do what? I think you are too invested in a bad way.
---
You nailed it
---
Spooky. I just did Signal Strength right before logging off to update.   
---
They're right though, I had to fight a 2* level 68 Super Mutant Warlord and my guy is level 13.   
---
Sneaky VATS crits FTW.
---
I think that would be pretty awesome! I'm big into building but sometimes get into a funk where I can't decide what/how to build so seeing ideas always helps out! And like you said its great for the person who made it. It's a win win.
---
Sell them to vendors, think they’re a cap a piece.
---
Oh please. The Responders where busy with the Mutants at Huntersville when the BoS ~~demanded~~ "requested" ammunition. Then there's Amy Kerry and her research the BoS wanted.
---
As for the Free States. Yeah, pushing them out of Thunder Mountain wasn't really the best way to start with them. I'd keep my distance from the BoS as well then.
---
BoS sure as hell wasn't as good as you think.
---
My OG thought to title it was "Who's celebrating the 75th anniversary of the nuking of Hiroshima with a silo run?"
---
I think either way I'd catch some flak LOL
---
This will be [us.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClhH0CCVYAENX_W.jpg)
---
Aww, someone is mad.
---
The machine continues to work. I just protect the cores and run up every so often to keep the hopper from getting full...if there is a max??
---
Never know considering the last 3* I got prior was a Bloodied Gauss Rifle 2*
---
I was annoyed that people didn't seem to pick up on something so obvious.  Idk.
---
So... free states are the railroad, responders are the minutemen, blood eagles are gunners, and the two main groups other than the BOS are neutral? 
---
Really wonder what the BOS will change when they show up this time.
---
That one wasn’t in the reactor room, so I doubt it. In fact, they’d need to fix the power armor glitch in its entirety to fix just the silos.
---
Who *wouldn't* sleep with Fuzzy Brenda? Especially if she left the suit on!?
---
Funnily enough when I've previously said this there's usually someone arguing that they still have everything and it's fine and it's obvious they're on PC and paying no attention to context. Bethesda's memory management has always been a bit ropey on PlayStation. Skyrim used to grind into a negative fps mess after too many saves and hoarding. Same spaghetti code underneath it all.
---
We all know how they're going to release it at the end anyway!
---
Yep, that’s why this patch didn’t get its own season. Some stuff got delayed, but Bethesda said from the start that the items listed in each roadmap would be scattered throughout each season at some point. As long as the 2020 map is accurate I’m not too worried if it’s a couple weeks late.
---
Yep, but it just works.
---
I´d rather have them delay it rather then releasing a buggy mess. which it probably will still be. but meehh it is what it is.
---
It was originally scheduled for patch 20
---
I'd prefer to have my photos as my loading screen as usual. It's one of the better features in the game.
---
I remember having this in the past, I carry 4 handmades on me and it would often switch out the wrong one. I haven't had it happening in the past few months though, I think I fixed it somehow by replacing the handmade on my favorites wheel from the actual wheel with a bunch of other weapons and then back to the handmade. Probably not a consistent fix since I remember having to do it many times and some things also getting stuck on there
---
Ward isn’t incompetent, he’s the life and soul of Foundation. Foundation is dead without a wandering Ward.
---
All in the name of science
---
If they're referring to farming screws, scrapping assaultron helmets wasn't an exploit, it was basic math.
---
They do unbelievable damage because it causes an overwhelming of the damage calculation. The damage acts like an exponential furious. You can melt the SBQ in one magazine with the right armor and weapon.
---
Daily life in the U.S.
---
I ain’t reading all that
---
Sorry that happened to you though
---
Or congratulations
---
Sorry but you i don't like broken gameplay. I should at least stand a chance. No one should allowed to be invincible. Creating a capped effects for PVP and not for PVE would be a change that makes sense.
---
They CAN credit score, if they can credit atoms. Programming wise its adding to a variable. They WON'T do either cause youre still playing, aren't you? I am too.
---
This makes Tsutomu Yamaguchi's luck even worse.
---
I also like shooting explosive guns into water.
---
May be right, may be wrong. Acting like we know won’t make it happen sooner though
---
So true
---
several people already uninstalled the game now.

---
Meh, not bad. Sucks the event is delayed, but, ah well. Hopefully that just means it'll be balanced well so I won't be stuck having to switch to a bloodied build.
---
And, ammo converter update? Yay. I was finding the thing useful for my rifleman character already - it was just a nuisance to use. Hopefully this makes it more worthwhile!
---
I am curious though... the past couple weeks, stealth has seemed *very* inconsistent for me; I've been getting detected and thrown into "Danger" far more often than I should. Wondering if that might be fixed \[again\] with this update?
---
I'd give you one of my 100+ if I could
---
Let the modding community have access, it'll be fixed within 15 minutes!
---
How do you know youre ahead? Which level should you be to be ahead?
---
I’m at work now, but I can be online around 2pm PST if that works for you. If not, let me know times for you, we can figure it out
---
What’s Alamy?
---
So they still don't give a shit about nuclear winter. Hope you trip on a banana Todd howard
---
Ironically, I go there to sell bulk junk to open up stash weight.
---
Good problem to Keeps us builders from getting upset that the end game content isn't satisfying us 😊
---
No. Angry turtles video shows no radiation gain inside the mine. Only once you step outside when you have to escape the mine. So you can throw on hazmat or something once you kill colossus. He recommends pa even as bloodied, but imma try it without and test my luck. He’s the type of player that face tanks everything and doesn’t run or jump out of range lol.
---
Wait so it’s not coming with this update? It got postponed again?
---
Ooh that’s good I’ve just started a new character and was struggling with the signal strength quest due to the ridiculously high level robots at the signal array 🌈
---
She knew that was the answer but the Brotherhood still refused to nuke them and it led to their death. 
---
And thanks for correcting me on the Responders. I thought for sure it was the Free States.
---
tell me one major content in fallout 76 which didn't got delayed several times.
---
honestly a ton of good additions today - seems like they’re listening. among them. added pocketed mods for secret service, fixed the screaming eagle and appalachian thunder skins as well as the ghillie skin, etc. way cool! thx beth
---
It's supposed to be buffed by shotgun perks. The issue is rather that it's not being treated as a gauss weapon properly. It also benefits/suffers from all the other shotgun related bugs that aren't perk related
---
Assaultrons use legendary scorchbeasts just to calibrate their headlasers, the bats don't even stand a chance against those brutes.
---
Lol no I don’t want to see some dookie ass random’s camp in MY loading screen
---
Killed a legendary scorch in the past week myself (commenting because of people inevitably assuming you're mistaking.
---
Edit: It could've been a bug but it did happen. It was not marked as legendary but had 2 stars (first time seeing that in a while) by the southern belle motel
---
*nervous september/legendary perks laughter*
---
Liked this one. Definitely was curious who was asking Bethesda to remove floating walls connected to roofs when I still can’t attach sloped walls to anything.
---
Imagine flexing your historical illiteracy with this much confidence.
---
I'm fucking terrified at the though of the BoS getting access to a weather machine...
---
Get an atom shop PA paint/skin
---
Exactly, what’s the point of even giving us dates at this point and getting everyone’s hopes and excitement up?
---
What got delayed now lol?
---
this. 
---
Seems easy to code as well, (*If player(rank 100), daliy/weekly reward atom*)
---
It wasn't that bad seeing him hanging with the NPC playing instruments. But yeah, I once found him standing on top of the cooking spit
---
The interns are doing their best ok!
---
Colossal problem event
---
Pretty sure you’re only meant to be able to buy 1 a day but I could be wrong
---
This is the absolute worst update I have seen since beta. What exactly are they doing. Is there like 2 people working in this game? Over it
---
Thank you, I suspected there was more to the crossbows but I always use the same two so I don't think I would have caught that order. Unfortunately I can't really edit the post to add anything you or others say because it exceeds 40000 characters, so I'll have to write it down for later
---
If it was like Frost I'd be in it all day.   
---
Still pissed that "*Survival* Mode" was just a Deathmatch. I had hoped it would be like the Immersive Gameplay mod for Fo4, but with multiplayer and open PvP.   
---
When I hear "Survival" I think PvE, scarce resources, and harsh needs systems. Not scoreboards and shit.
---
Thank fuck for that!
---
How the hell do you guys add to your username here "Vault 76, Raiders etc"?
---
Because people clamor to know when when when when when when when something's gonna happen.  Yet we live in a universe where time is linear and we exist only in one moment of it, traveling forward.  We remember the past.  We see the present.  But the future is unknown to us.
---
No one ever knows when something will happen.  Some things are easier to predict than others, but wrenches get thrown into the best of plans.  
---
All deadlines are guesses.  Repeat that like a mantra and you'll be less frustrated about delays in the future.  All deadlines are guesses.  All deadlines are guesses.  All deadlines are guesses.  All deadlines are guesses.
---
The patch notes only mention event rewards, so we'll have to wait and see.
---
Soon ™️
---
IDGAF
---
Atomic shop
---
The BOS isn't asking for it.  A guy in Appalachia is asking us to gather it for them before they arrive, he's not even BOS, just a fan of them BOS.
---
&gt; Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79.
---
That’s nice and all but why is there still no Ultra-Light mod for limbs? You already have one but for the chest only...
---
Idk if it is mentioned but the radium rifle has a riddicilously low chance of droping mods after scraping, this with it having 0 static spawn locations and craftable only at lvl 45/50 so the material cost is just insane for something you will probably scrap and get nothing, on other guns you get mods almost all the time especially the essencials, (suppressors, long barels, stocks, hardened reciever) 
---
I'm saying this bc I have a B25 radium just sitting in the stash bc the only plans I know are the primed recievers and sniper scopes. 
---
And without the glorious shush tube as cap whould say it's worthless.
---
but they love it dirty
---
hey even in the wasteland we still have needs
---
I'd kill for them to finally put that thing in the Atom shop.  My favorite clothing from Fallout 4.
---
Your essentially downloaded the game again because of how PlayStation does updates
---
&gt; Main Menu: On PC, pressing TAB after opening the Main Menu from the Map now correctly returns the player to the Map view.
---
The work of Gods!
---
I tried out an auto grenade/explosive build and was sorely disappointed with the inability to kill things when compared to stealth rifle/commando builds.
---
I know, but I never heard 21, it went from 20 to 22 from my understanding
---
Don't forget many Wild Appalachia quest items don't spawn, Holotapes won't show up during the loading animation when putting them in your pipboy, can't put wallpaper on wooden windows In camps, Mirelurk kings glitch your game and can glitch you into walls, Atoms disappearing, and a massive ton of others
---
I actually hope it does.  I'm not looking forward to that update.  I like being a god in the forest.
---
I can’t wait to try out the updated ammo converter on all those 40mm you get from fort defiance.
---
Wow really? They actually said that? Can we get a screenshot because for me they always just auto lock my tickets with no reply whatsoever!
---
Dont think it's a bug, people have said its only coded on her and no other mobs
---
I skipped the one last night for leveling up, I woke up at like 5am last night and have yet to log on for the day, got everything else done but I did not feel like sitting in a bush for the next few games. I’m burned out on this legendary run shite. I’ve got 11 levels left to go and another time sensitive event started on my other game, so I’m considering just buying the last levels with atoms just to be done with it. At this point I’m gaining one level a day I think but the amount of score per level keeps getting higher and higher.
---
They use them to make paper airplanes and have paper plane races hidden truth is , that's how you get into the brotherhood of steel is win a paper plane race with the elder
---
I think I know what you're talking about, but if it is that, I am not sure if I ever had it happen on any of the gauss weapons. It seems to be more common on the bows for me
---
I wonder how much harder it is to store 1 steel vs 10,000 steel.  Even if Bethesda had competent developers that used a variable type of short (32,767 max value, 2 bytes) for the quantity of a given item, it's still the same 2 bytes regardless of 0, 1, 100, 10000, or 32,767 steel.  The calls to check how much steel you have for crafting/repairing/etc would still happen.  You only have to map one value for a given resource item variable since the resources are shared.
---
I have a number of clothing plans like the Halloween costumes and insurgent and treasure hunter. So used to sell tons of those to both the robot vendors and in my machines. Using super duper and various cloth and rubber/plastic farms and buying cheap mats from other players.
---
Since the Legendary Run began I've been doing lots of events like radiation rumble, line in the sand and guided meditation that produce tons of loot able bodies. I've been collecting so much glowing blood, chems and weapons from these events and selling them that I can't remember the last time I crafted an outfit to sell.
---
Imo they tried fixing what wasn't broke and in the process broke it even worse. In its first PTS iteration I said was fine. Capital F FINE. Needed a few tweaks to go from good to great and that's it. I said it was at least as good as Encrytid but perhaps not as satisfying as Scorched Earth and wasn't a fan of the ticking clock, can't see, don't know where I'm going, insta-kill falling ceiling mine collapse at the end but whatever it's fine.
---
Then they decided to make it an 8-player limited instanced event and that was for me what made it go from 'pretty okay' to 'pretty shit'. I'll spare the details from my own experience but it made it go from a 'fun and challenging' server-wide event to 'hellish chore' that lumps you in with a half-dozen randos (if you're lucky) that you hope are up to the challenge because if they and you are not you're gonna die and keep dying and when you gotta wait a full minute to respawn and hope that the event doesn't fail/complete while you're dead because if it does you are screwed on a number of levels as in unable to retrieve loot from the colossus or the wendigos or the bonus chest not to mention that if you had the audactity to wear regular armor and/or be overencumbered inside the mine you're gonna die of rad exposure before you can get to safety.
---
&gt;I should at least stand a chance.
---
You do. You just suck. ~~No offense.~~  Just checked your post history.  All the offense.
---
The same Responders that were fighting the mutants at Huntersville before the BoS knew they were there? The same Responders who were actively working on a cure for the Scorch Plague? Those ones? Yeah, damn those entitled Responders right? Now if only the BoS actually went for the raiders first before they blew up the fucking dam.
---
They can drop with just about any legendary prefix...though I am assuming Two Shot and things like that can't Heh.
---
Right.
---
Alright there, Plato. But Bethesda needs to get their shit together because this isn’t once or twice, this is every single time
---
This...
---
MAYBE if it's use a stimpak or 3...Those are typically fairly easy to find and then i just jump off a roof or cliff to hurt myself
---
I can still turn in fresh testicle datas I find, but the 60 some in my inventory are useless. At least they're also weightless.
---
I'll be submitting it as a bug report anyway, for whatever good that might do
---
Pfffffff 
---
 thx mate
---
This 100 percent. They (Bethesda) are shooting themselves in the foot by giving players no reason to log in daily once they complete the run. Even if it were just 10 atoms each daily and maybe 50 each weekly.
---
Yeah, im more mad no one had the balls to tell us before we patched today lol.
---
Technically, Workshops don't need to be permanent as in, they're there even when the person is not online, because most of the times, the world goes down with the 1st player. They just need to work like CAMPs, with the structure saved in the character savefile rather than somewhere in the Beth forums, this way there is no need to create any new system and as far as the owner is concerned, the structures are persistent. 
---
They just need to be given precedence when they build in their own private servers, meaning that if I have a private server and have a workshop all built up, then invite another 1st player to my world, and then leave said world, the workshop vanishes without me, but the world stays up because there's another 1st member to keep the lights on. Since the world is mine, and not of the other 1st person, if he decided to build at the same  workshop on my world he can do that, and his progress is saved on his own savegame. but when I get back on my own server, his progress is replaced with mine, and HE gets the "this spot is already taken, do you want to change world?" thing, not I, since I own the specific world.
---
The structure just need to not be loaded  automatically when playing on public servers, but with the option to freely place it down should the player capture the workshop.
---
It just works, it's a feature
---
I tried a Tesla out and it only seemed to hit like three people. Is there a mod or something?
---
Lmao you had me reading deep all the way. Sounds like a mystical journey indeed haha
---
LOL hey, I need SOMETHING to hunt for :D
---
&gt; Though if I'm unable to kill the WC can someone kill him once for me
---
According to the patch notes, the Colossal Problem has been delayed once more for everyone (well, except for you, which sucks).
---
Seriously? When did it get announced
---
Because people will throw temper tantrums if they don’t have an itemized list of exactly what’s happening and when? They literally can’t win with you people.
---
There are a few calculators for this. I am at work, so I cant link it for you. For today, you have to be atleast rank 65 to be safe. I am rank 75.
---
Fuuuuuuuck bro, why? Seemed to be working fine after they made changes on the pts?
---
I wouldn't want that testicular data though either.
---
Yeah, only because of the deleyed Colossal Problem.
---
Not because of the other bugs, or burn out, or anything...

I’d rather it get delayed than release broken. Cause know what would happen if the event was live but there was a problem? This subreddit would be full of circle jerkers bitching about it non-stop, and a select few youtubers would ride the hate train months after the problem gets fixed, just like they did with the release of the game.
---
So thats how they looking into it. TIL
---
The Responders were willing to work with outside groups. Amy Kerry was never actually a Responder but worked very closely with them on her ecological research. She ended up going into hiding after the Brotherhood found out about it and tried to force her to hand over the information. 
---
The Responders pulled back because the Brotherhood kept demanding more and more of their supplies while trying to take control of all their technology and research. 
---
Sure the extra years are nice but it could have been permanent if they weren't boneheaded idiots who wouldn't work with others.
---
You know, I can see that! All the clicks and menus are not worth .38, but missiles and 40mm may be less painful for the yield.
---
Hey, patch today! Maybe I will be placing the converter again if they fixed it. (I work in 5.56 and 2mm EC)
---
Yeah. It's a bug in the same way the legendary mask was a bug/not intended.
---
I logged on last night at 5am for the first time today and went to the golf club and there was three 3* ghouls... I didn’t even know there was a challenge to kill a 3* till it popped up completed. :/
---
(When I log on, I focus on the level up first and most of the time I complete the others along the way.)
---
God damn it Bethesda, with rain and flooding letting up I was hoping to relax to some colossal killing a few times tonight. But thanks for the update
---
Waste of time to grief that location. Maybe a few early on before they're relegated to White Springs and the fissure in the bottom right
---
Heard the colossus problem got delayed does that mean that the brotherhood event will too?
---
More upset when they’re repeatedly let down again and again though
---
You must be a lawyer 😂 well how bout this i ment that about both armors because they are pretty much the same armor ones just power armor so in hindsight I ment that for both of them I was just Giving my specific complaint on t-65
---
They've banned some players but not many of them for it.
---
Not me, I'm at work for 10 hours, then when I get in i'll barely have time to get my scrip, caps, bullion and do the score challenges.
---
Can't actually enjoy the new content (or launch nukes at it) until the weekend.
---
I wont hold my breath
---
That too!! And when called out they say they couldn’t find anything. But then you do the search yourself there’s all the results they claimed couldn’t find.
---
Probably a large bit of it is that I more or less enjoy this kind of thing. I've gotten to try out some pretty fun weapons in the course of all the testing, and I feel like as a whole I have a better understanding of the game and how some of these things are broken. That really is it though, it's just a single wave. I've had so many other obscure bugs happen while doing this testing that were not weapon related
---
That’s true with certain things eg the legendary perks, but this has been up on the pts for ages now with very little problems from what I’ve heard
---
Thats definitely true
---
Have you made them with flux yet? If not that’s why it’s not showing.
---
Ok I will try this.
---
Yes I read through just now.  But will it be fixed?  That's the real question.  They have said stuff is fixed before and it broke again.  So I'm not holding my breath.
---
Lots of good fixes in the notes in fairness to Bethesda.  Stuff that has frustrated me the last few weeks of playing.   You have to understand people's frustration with fixes and updates at the moment.
---
There the remnants of America. What did you expect? 
---
[This post was made by the Communist party]
---
Niceone, thanks man
---
You aren't being ungrateful. It is like being given a punishment not a reward
---
No one will cause those jackasses delayed it lol
---
Still no "magic" weapon effects fix?
---
I'd say that's pretty close, but I don't know if the Free States really belong with anyone. I really hope Bethesda finds some way to revive them because they have a really good back story. The conflict they'll have with the Enclave should be very interesting. 
---
I expect the Brotherhood to act the same as it always does. Pretend to be noble heroes while making others do all their dirty work.
---
I took one photo with that frame. Who knew it would end up being legacy?
---
Dirty girl that only knows one tune
---
Thanksgiving Shelf and Encapsulated Scortchbeast Heart
---
more of the whole thing in total.
---
no nw fixes, no word about hackers, just bugfixes like floating walls to decorate foundations etc... the last drop that overflows the barrel.
---
Bethesda when thousands of players report a problem: *\*We sleep\**
---
Bethesda when one guy in his fever dream mumbles something: *\*Real shit!\**
---
That's probably the same bug I put under automatic weapons here, I have seen the automatic reload happen to combat rifles and personally managed to get it happen to my dragon once. I might try getting my hands on a quad crossbow or maybe even one of the nuclear winter ones to see how its fire rate works with that
---
Steam is downloading 1.4 gb
---
Right? So many folks complaining because one event didn't release in today's patch like expected. Doesn't matter that dozens of other fixes and changes were released.
---
They are updating the game. They do this each week on Tuesday.
---
No. They also very specifically say there are no more tokens available,
---
oh nooooo!
---
I think Gamepass versions of games use a different file structure because they are basically rentals and not actually bought copies. Last I checked the folders and files were hidden or encrypted, so the patch for a copy you own won't work for a copy you "merely" rented.
---
Breaking news: Colossal Problem slated to come out around the same time as the Covid vaccine
---
A lot of these things have been going on for over a year. I bet mod community could fix a small percentage of them quickly, but most of it is broken beyond repair. If it wasn’t it would have been patched a long time ago.
---
I prefer my pictures
---
I don't mind not having a new event because I can't fast travel to it anyways! Yaaaay
---
Your soapbox is creaking under the weight of your outrage.
---
&gt; Legendary Loot: Daily Quests and Events have had their legendary loot rewards updated to include additional items, like The Fixer, Secret Service Armor, and others, so long as you’ve learned the Plans for them.   
---
Yay! :D   
---
&gt;::still doesn't have Fixer plans::
---
Boo! ;\_;
---
I remember seeing something a long time ago about it not working on some weapons or under certain conditions but honestly I couldn't tell you, I've never run a medic's build
---
Damn that’s unfortunate:( even the grounded mutation? Is it not supposed to affect gauss weapons?
---
Thanks I’m glad you agree. I don’t like to complain about things but these things are annoying the hell out of me
---
1.4gb for me, Says its ready to play.
---
I should add that I'm grateful they addressed things like the Ammo Converter. But there are *so many* other issues affecting core gameplay which have seemingly been ignored in favor of fixing non-issues like people manipulating CAMP walls. It is immensely frustrating from the perceptive of someone who payed $60 for this game on release and $12 monthly for FO1st to still experience these bugs *this far* into the game's development cycle. I spend months grinding for the Gauss Shotgun only to find out it is borderline unusable in combat because I can't reload, sprint, or use stimpacks 75% of the time the gun is equipped. This is unacceptable. If they want to make 76 into a "game as a service" model, then we need new community managers who will actually interact with us to help address problems like those mentioned in the meme. tagging u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Probably because they don't have great version control and they already rolled everything for the event into their code to push out today.
---
Plus maybe they had some metric to get this out by a certain release, and someone is hoping they can convince upper management they hit it even though they didn't.
---
I wish we could sell them at train station, I don’t want them either
---
When are critical hits going to be fixed?????
---
When I was a kid we had to craft our items one at a time and it was uphill both ways. I cooked 89 glowing meat steaks this morning and it definitely took several years off my life.
---
It is a Fixer with no other legendary traits.
---
Colossal problem.
---
No the atlas event starts today
---
I would pay extra scrip not to get a ranged weapon that isnt a ranged weapon. How is a flamer even a ranged weapon?
---
&gt; They do this each week on Tuesday.
---
They sure don't.
---
I can solo it but it’s very annoying to have to switch between my B3325 Handmade rifle and the stick to make the Brahmin move, plus the rewards for it are all centered around some inferior melee weapon so there’s little point in doing it if you’re a ranged build.
---
That's under the other/untraceable section, I still see it happen with weapons other than tesla rifles so I decided to bundle it up there
---
Nah probably update 111
---
https://i.imgur.com/EY5VSXy.jpg
---
Or even just give them away. Some people seem to like them. Lol but not me 🤪
---
That is amazing.
---
Ah good. So I just have to wait til 1700 after the dailies reset. 46GB was going to take forever
---
You really over estimate their abilities, most of these bugs WERE ALREADY FIXED by Fallout 4 mods!
---
Heck data miners have outright tried to show Bethesda how to fix many of these bugs already.
---
Exactly. Any charred ferals outside of the event are a cakewalk.
---
I'd say Fat Man Launchers. Now as for the ammo, no idea.
---
Ty. Pathetic isn't it
---
I have only had that happen to me with bows so far, but I will keep testing then, it could very well be related to the charging mechanic in general
---
Ty!
---
1400 is a pittance compared to selling rare weapons and plans for 20,000.
---
Y'all didn't believe us when we told yall about them, soooooo
---
Hmmmmm time to buy Atoms! Yes I buy Atoms! Bring on the hate!!
---
OK, thanks for confirming.
---
Yesterday I fought the Scorchbeast Queen for the first time ever. Her body launched across the wasteland mid-flight after dying. I'm pretty sure I did enough damage to have earned the loot, but by the time I found her nothing was there. I was real sad.
---
Oh man imagine ARK with Conan building system.
---
Zzzz
---
Because Bethesda lol
---
Thanks, got something new to try out. As I had to say before, it will literally not allow me to edit the post because it's too long so I'll have to write it down for future testing
---
Side question: what are all the flavors of Nuka Cola in 76? I have been trying to collect them all
---
The 46 gig download is for gamepass not for steam. Its making me reconsider my platform choice because my download rate is in kb/s
---
I sold 22,000 caps worth of blueprints a couple days ago.  A week or so before that, I sold a gun for 25,000 caps.  Just get rare stuff you dont care about and sell it.
---
This is delayed again
---
Rocksy wouldn’t stand around holding your walkie talkie because you wanted her to hang on your every word, pissant! *spits at irradiated ground*
---
"Taking on for the team" sounds really good, especially with the public teams, you can always be in a team if you want.
---
Yeah, I also started playing with gamepass a few days ago and have a 49GB patch downloading.
---
&gt; WAKE UP
---
That's the sound of your mom calling down into the basement. Did you want your PB&amp;J in triangles or squares?
---
They're really milking the nuke zone for all it's worth, kind of a bummer.
---
According to the patch notes, the developers are working on additional performance tweaks for that event and will need to test the event some more before enabling it in the next couple of weeks(likely 2-3 weeks). Given that the event takes place in an instanced interior and a server can be running a couple instances of the event at once, it is likely that they need to ensure that server lag will not be an issue unlike Vault 94 where server lag is a major issue that caused players to not enjoy the vault. It would be a nightmare to try to run the event while dealing with severe lag and would lead to people not touching the event in public servers.
---
Fatmani
---
They honestly suck, bad.  I just throw them immediately at nothing because I don't wish that curse on anyone enough to simply drop them.
---
I like the Atlas donor provisions reward but not if it is like the pails or gifts.  I don't need another 5828737 mounted plans.
---
Cause no one wants to see people happy with such a buggy game with no end game hardly at all and weapons whose damage is destroyed and outplayed by the AK-47.
---
this is a huge bummer dude, i have country internet so looks like i won’t be playing today lmao! happy cake day.
---
YOU SUCK BETHESDA!
---
Lacking weapon mods, creature balance, lore/environment issues, Encrypted and Queen broken, no need to get flux for anything, no point on nuking anywhere cause nothing spawns.  The list could go on for awhile.
---
That's a lot of plastic..
---
Blah blah blah ADRENALINE WORKS blah blah...
---
That's not entirely true.  Look how they haven't fixed magic weapons doing ridiculous damage.  If they knew how to fix it they'd probably make that a priority though.
---
No jokes I met her when I was level 3 2 weeks ago and for the past 2 weeks she just play her god damn guitar in my camp
---
My wallet:...gulp....
---
Fun interaction I just found with this bug last night. I have 3 Fat Man's on me, but only the uneqipped Fat Man's were taking the durability damage from the one I had equipped and firing. Eventually the one in my inventory broke, essentially tripling my durability bar.
---
Yes, please, give me 1,000 missiles that make me over weighted every single time. Just no more god damn floater grenades. At least missiles don't need a confirmation to drop them. And if you don't have enough floater grenades to drop them all at once you need to confirm multiple times.
---
FUCK
---
FLOATER
---
GRENADES
---
Knowing Bethesda, the fix is probably that Super Duper no longer works.
---
I don't think that junk is too much of a problem it's more when your stashing things that don't stack such as weapons and armor is when the problems would start building up.
---
I don't know what I find more confusing... that OP didn't bother checking the subreddit before posting, or that OP somehow already knew the exact answer to their question, and posted anyway?
---
WTF.  Why the hell would they take from the scrap box last?!   This is almost the complete opposite of what the community wants.  And that autoscrapped?  Just digging the wound in further.
---
Thanks! I must have seen your post before because I actually had some of these written down before. I have the AGL magazine mod down but could not find one in time for this post, so I can't tell if it's still possible to get them in the game or if it was an earlier bug. I decided not to include the AGL barrel since the description changed to match it, even if the mod does not serve any functionality, but I guess that should still be noted in the future. I have seen reports of rubberbanding with the harpoon gun and gauntlet (and had it happen to me once before with a missile launcher), but it's something that happens so rarely I can not be sure if it's an item issue or server issue. At the very least, it's not consistent since I tried running around and doing a bunch of fighting in first and third person with all three of those weapons recently without any issues - might be that there are other requirements that need to be met. The others are good to look into though
---
I think you have game updates confused with atom shop updates.
---
Game was banned by XBox, PS, and Steam for secretly being a Chinese spy app.
---
Another delay to “A Colossal Problem.”  Imagine my shock.  Literally every bit of new content has been delayed at least once or twice.  Pretty much the only thing I was looking forward to for the past few weeks.  Bethesda can never have anything ready in time.  Super frustrating.
---
Welp, guess I’ll just stick to the S.C.O.R.E challenges and call it a day until then.
---
The other day when I was playing I done all my score shite scrip and daily caps and decided to end the night with a lucky hole mine run.
---
Halfway through the mine and got disconnected, loaded back into my private server just to find my server crashed and it put me in a new one, so all the enemies were back. But every time I walked up to this one knob jockey standing outside the entrance to the mine the server would disconnect me. I walked up to this same level 10 cultist 5 times and every time it disconnected me. Walked past him and into the mine and I was fine, walked up to him on the way out though and got disconnected again. It was very weird and very annoying.
---
I scrapped her chair and use the raider punk, he's less annoying.
---
Just because it worked on a test server doesn’t mean much on a public server. There was the small animal problem with Faschnaut, I believe something on the PTS that was fine but broken publicly a month or two ago....look, I’m not saying that it *is* broken, I’m just saying that if Beth is taking steps to *make sure* or if they found something themselves that needs work, I’m all for that then.
---
WOOT!!!  Glad I got the NW Christmas/Halloween stuff done since they patched out the ability to earn them!!!!
---
It would be more accurate to say they don't have the knowledge or maybe the drive to fix these bugs, not that all of them can't be fixed.  Some of the game's bugs stem from entrenched architectural errors, but a lot of them are just facepalm coding errors.
---
I came across her just randomly and I'm not disappointed
---
I need that couch.
---
I have a ts grenade launcher and it works fine
---
This, this is perfect
---
Nope, and i don't think this is going to be the last time, since scrapping is one of the mindless qctivities ingame
---
Feel free to spend your money however you wish, buddy.
---
I literally just found out the value of circuits and was going to use this to get rich. Tragic.
---
I am using raiser punk right now, also.
---
Yep, mentioned it in two places. Sadly, it seems like the out of vats damage is the intended one, since the damage numbers and vats damage almost seem like it's doing the full damage for every pellet
---
Charlotte would be fun to explore. Big banking city, lots of museums, several universities.
---
Seems like you’d be opening up a whole can of worms if the workshop is attached to the player instead of the server. What happens if you return to that players server, which was originally yours. He built one object so all the workshop data would just not be set down, and we already have the issue of logging into a world with the same camp. What about the same workshop.. Plus, a lot of players like building objects together in workshops if that asset is just attached to each character then everyone becomes dependent on you to be online vs a dedicated server. And if I log off does that player, who already has his own workshop builds have all his assets load in or does he have to recreate each one if he doesn’t want to lose them. And how does the game fairly decide who gets priority for their workshop if the server host changes. 
---
I suppose it could be a blueprint for each workshop and whoever gets there first can just lay the blueprint down, which could solve some of those issues. Assuming Bethesda will finally fix their blueprint bugs that have persisted since the start. Still would stink building an item together and then having it disappear when your friend does tho. At least in my mind it eliminates the fun of building with friends.
---
Just seems like there’d be a lot of conflicts between players joining/leaving servers that could be fixed if every player just got a dedicated server - albeit that will take much more work. 
---
I’m also not totally sure if the servers could handle that. The game is dramatically slower the first few minutes of starting out because each asset attached to your account is loaded in each time. If you also need to load in 10+ workshops that are attached to your account and not the server I’d imagine the strain could be crash-worthy, especially as a new service.
---
You forgot broken friends list, trade bug, and fast travel black screen bug - to name a few. But yeah it’s pretty bad. Unfortunately Bethesda isn’t the only one to bury their head in the sand, plenty of fanboys downvoting your post despite quality meme.
---
There shouldn’t be another season after this. Atom dailies are fine. People who buy atoms would still buy them and people who won’t still don’t buy atoms
---
Are we ever getting team quest HUD back?
---
My opinion is we should be able to lock items from picking up.  Just like being able to search for junk, I want to be able to not ever pick up certain objects.
---
I'm so glad they prioritised fixing this game breaking bug and not wasting their time fixing the new event.
---
That's extremely specific, but wouldn't be the first time something of the sort happened. Will look into it
---
But by reading this forum, I’m making it so that Bethesda never had to fix anything by spending Atoms!
---
Who pays for that crap?
---
Did you not read the notes?
---
* Ammo Converter overhaul:scrap rate of 10x and 100x, and 50x ammo point cap (100k now), reduced menus to navigate (QOL)
---
* Adrenaline perk fix (QOL/fix, I use it)
---
* Ward pathing issue (he was a pain to find, I'd call this QOL)
---
* ATLAS community mission (content)
---
Yes, some bugs are more prevalent or annoying than others that got fixed, but holy crap, can people stop complaining for one patch note release?
---
it’s not a daily per se, you can do it multiple times in a day as long as you have the quest. i don’t know if that affects the rewards. 
---
and yeah, just sell the “dead” ones in your inv to a robot for a cap each.
---
If they don’t have the knowledge than it can’t be fixed. This game will be dead before it gets mod support.
---
What’s with all these thanks Bethesda posts? Do we really need to thank them every time they actually do an okay job now? Is the bar so low?
---
Cut them some slack, drag and drop is a hard thing to do and the intern was busy fucking up the Collossal Problem event, k?
---
Just another straw to break the camel's back.
---
Most of that camp stuff looks great. Not too fussed about the outfits so much. I also really hope that jukebox plays something different. Preferably the frathouse jazz.
---
Lol no way in hell im sitting in that PITA terminal long enough to collect 100,000 ammo points.
---
It was to be playable today, which is all that matters to anyone
---
Fitting name for this event really.
---
Not if you're a hacker in NW. Then they go out of their way to follow the rules and protect your identity.
---
Dude I can’t fucking stand it. I get the other comment missiles, mini nukes &amp; shit but if you have 4-5 floater nades you have to drop &amp; destroy each one individually as it doesn’t count as a stack yet until 6... sometimes I’ll just keeep them until I get 6 so I don’t have to spam click the controller to get rid of them
---
It was awesome tbh, essentially converting 1 steel into circuits, screws and silver. I don't understand why they would suddenly patch it. I think they follow me around and "fix" things that benefit me when I find them.
---
Thank you, going to look into that. I've got a trust stalker's explosive pump action that I've been using for about a year now, but I never really use vats normally in this game so some issues like that slip past me
---
Well you would think the host of the event (nuke launcher) would get priority in getting in the event but who knows. I'd tell you if I was in the pts.
---
Thank you very much for the nights on these matters, guess I can hang up hoping on having all of our allies at our camp or being able to build a robot companion to defend my camp or help me fight in the wastes then p,.,q
---
This is getting outta hand. We need to pick just one measure. Frog jars, apes or flamingos?
---
Oh jeez
---
i've noticed that too, which is a shame because i main a stealth build. even using the chinese stealth armour i find myself in "danger" a lot lately... but only in the last couple of weeks.
---
Same for me 49gb "update".
---
They’ll release ATX stuff broken before they delay it 😂
---
SS Armor pocketed mods, perk card fixed, and fixer showing up as rewards are all fine by me. Thanks.
---
It's only about 1650 atoms spent for the last 11 there
---
Just checking in to see if the servers are back up. YES, I have nothing else to play that I haven’t already beaten a million times over.
---
I got like over 300 in my inventory
---
Hopefully not.
---
Not even going to go there. Lol
---
But probably.
---
Alright cool. I think I have all but orange rn
---
Could have been a cultist dagger, those are still in the loot pool
---
Omg.. What kind of crazy person built THAT?! I wanna meet them xD  
---
I saw a very funny camp involving gorillas too, there was a sheepsquatch toy sitting on a couch surrounded by gorillas featuring a well-known meme. Still have a screenshot somewhere :D
---
Well it’s a lot better when you can trade in 100x the items at one time
---
The police and firebreathers, maybe. Paramedics wouldn’t have had much use for it though.
---
 **Ammo Converter:** Following community feedback, we’ve made several improvements to the Ammo Converter.
---
* We’ve added options to buy and sell 10x and 100x the normal amounts of ammo so that you can exchange larger stacks more quickly.
---
* Buying and selling has been incorporated directly into the terminal page for each ammo type, which means fewer screens to click through when exchanging your ammo.
---
* They patched it (:
---
Thinking the current patch is the only thing they work on at a time.
---
I do have to say that this will probably make selling ammo in your vendors less effective, as people will finally be able to actually convert the thousands of rounds of .38, syringer ammo, etc. they've collected into something they want to use. 
---
I mean, it's great that they addressed that part, but my daily caps income will probably see a hit.
---
When you first load the sub before selecting a thread click on the three dots in the top right corner and select change user flair.
---
Was the 30th Brotherhood Scribe Outfit not reward enough? ;)
---
I remember seeing mention of this a while ago, didn't want to try doing this on randoms but I may ask some people to help me test the PvP related things more thoroughly
---
You can trade in 100x the amount of ammo at once, shouldn't be too bad.
---
Better start learning!
---
I’m not a lawyer, I just can’t see how you keep denying that either your wrong or your post is poorly worded
---
The ideal mix between the gamemodes, but better. On both ends
---
i got the AGL magazine mod in either update 19 or 20, so it isn't that far back. as for the rubber banding, I cant walk in 3rd person with the Harpoon gun because of how often it happens. the worst part is, like you said, it isn't consistent. I could walk for a minute and it wouldn't happen, and then all of a sudden it happens 4 times in a row.
---
Right...I used to hate that event, now with the spawn bug its one of my favorites
---
Sorry dude! I totally feel the disappointment. Its happened many times. I love 76 but the lack of any end game or dungeons like this is killing it. Hope you can still make the most of the day with your friends though!
---
They didn't say anything about it, at least in the patch notes.
---
It seems like it would be a relatively straightforward fix, though - to just expand the unbuildable space/radius around the asylum.  Which is something they had actually done in the past prior to Wastelanders.
---
Fair enough, like he was saying, I speed loot everything too. Phobia of server crashes left over from the early sbq battles.
---
Junk walls 💃💃💃💃
---
Good thing I'm on steam
---
Except they're not, the army unit that became the Brotherhood officially seceded from the US a few days before the bombs dropped after they figured out what was going on in Mariposa.
---
(This post made by a smug, superior Brotherhood scribe)
---
I believe I actually mentioned that as a bug at some point in the past, but even some 2018 datamines showed that the radium rifle has its own learn table with percentages, so it's seemingly intended, as obnoxious as it is
---
Yes! lol.
---
I read through the patch notes and it said nothing about patching line if the sand so hoping they didn't
---
@ladydevann, in the previous patch notes you responded that the team was "working hard to resolve this" in relation to the AMD GPU issues described here: "https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hio4tb/comment/fwhlm2g?context=3". That really got my hopes up after having had shading issues since the Wastelanders update. I'm sad to see yet another update where this haven't been addressed at all. If you have playtesters running AMD GPUs, they will easily run into these issues, and I've already sent you simple repro instructions. I don't think you do, though, because then I'm confident this would have been prioritized months ago. If you place a dev in front of a PC with an AMD GPU and have them follow the repro instructions, I'm sure that dev will want to fix this immediately. If you're not going to prioritize this, and the "we are working hard to resolve this" was just a standard response, please just say so. For what it's worth, if you're going to use this iteration of the engine for future game titles, or if the engine has been forked from some other repo and you are continuously upstreaming changes to improve the engine for future games, it is in your best interest to improve the visual experience for PC users with AMD GPUs.
---
Can they really stop The Ward? Can anyone?
---
I personally think this is a futile effort. Ward is the 'unstoppable force'!
---
I’m kind of glad about that, it’s the only thing keeping shotguns viable rn
---
It just looks like a handmade with a beam splitter. Guess it’s fitting considering I’ve seen people with those in game.
---
Unfortunately, there are some bugs that can affect any weapon under certain circumstances :)
---
when does it season end ? I read September but I wanna make sure
---
Downloading a 49 GB update on PC (windows store).. Nice
---
No that it does affect them for me I think it’s kinda a luck based thing with most of 76 (not the stat i mean like how lucky you are IRL) I’ve only tested a few then servers went down and haven’t been on since I’ll test more for me when I get on I’m also on PS4 so if your on pc or Xbox that may be why because PS4 has typically always been relatively stable
---
"But good job for listening to the community 
---
( For once )"
---
Oh please.  Hyperbolic much?
---
This is one of the best bugs in the game RN why would you want it removed? High or low level, bring 20 molotovs to it and throw one for every wave. Event takes 12 minutes not 18/20 like before. All your meat piles are in one spot to check for tickets. What not to like?
---
Not saying in a rude way genuinely curious as to why you'd want it fixed? Especially comparing it to say the fast travel bug, which is more frequent, more annoying and effects more people.
---
I've gotta be multiple thousands of hours in all fallout games combined. Not once have I used a grenade. Dross is as close as I get to throwing grenades so yeah. I'm with you on this one.
---
Now if they would do the same with scrip...
---
Make her wear something that shows her skin and face... I guarantee you'll be switching back to some other ally after seeing what a mess she is
---
Well I’m quite sure we’ll be getting that double daily score weekend from the community event, so I wouldn’t worry too much.
---
I dont like it either but Im playing it since it drops themed items from events like halloween and Christmas, seeing as I started playing two weeks ago this is kinda cool.
---
Those manually updated “tracker” numbers killed me.
---
Lol I get that. I always have the can’t respawn glitch during encrypted. Seems like the way they split rewards up is fair. Ultracite is endgame content so it wouldn’t be that fair for a lvl 5 to port in and get a full set when he can’t even equip or craft it.
---
Closest I could find was the [Red and khaki shirt and slacks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Red_and_khaki_shirt_and_slacks) which is red but not blue unfortunately.
---
Because if you have scrapped junk in your stash it has weight. So get that out first, then the weightless bottomless pit of the scrap box, and finally the auto scrap.
---
 "loot it like a goblin on cocaine " amazing picture! :)
---
I mean, it was true that it was too difficult for the intended player level, but it does kinda grind my gears that I did that quest solo a few weeks ago.  Probably died 2-3 times before finally completing it.
---
Im not sure why it triggers but it does. 
---
Possible reasons I believe it could happen are trying to fire in vats during the reload animation or trying to reload in vats with reload speed increasing effects like scattershot or speed demon. I'm positive it only happens in vats.
---
Yeah but it saves your legendary mods, so you get more bang for your buck
---
FYI, posting about it draws attention to it.
---
100 times yes. Happens in both Adventure and Nuclear Winter too.
---
And if they hadn’t pushed it back you would be even madder that it was released broken and they they don’t even play their own game.
---
Yea I take a hole free week for the fasnacht event because I missed it last year. Got my free week aaaaaaaand....... it's gone. Fasnacht will drop a week later sorry guys. That was the moment we're I stopped to hype for every content that comes out in the future. Doesn't matter which game lol
---
Naw.
---
More
---
Update: I am downloading the update on Xbox One right now.
---
Yah I’ll probably plop them off in a train station bathroom for someone to find lol
---
Are sneak attacks for the fixer fixed by this patch too?
---
Hi! I am literally not able to edit the post as it exceeds 40000 characters, but I can write these down for future testing. Some of these are more or less intended though - the 90% weight reduction is an engine limitation, attachments can only give flat values and not a multiplicative effect, which is why two shot only affects base damage and why quad only affects base ammo capacity. The BP rifle and radium rifle mods seem intended, as they have specific learn rates attached to them. I can look into the rest though
---
Totally agree. But most game have tendencies of fixing bugs that benefit players and ignore bugs that actually bother everyone.. I hope it won't be fixed tho as it's actually very convenient.
---
Shit happens.
---
How do you do that whole quote thing.
---
I have 654 that I cant turn in.
---
i gonna nuke todds camp, just have to find it.
---
I drew this for a joke)
---
My wife is the same. Dosn't normally play FPS games for fun, but building "Lawn Flamingo Island" drew her in.
---
Hey, builders, anyone know a good island you can build on that she can use? Been trying to find one but have had no luck so far.
---
Reminder that missile launcher durability is broken like laser rifles used to be!
---
youre banned for duping, deal with it
---
Perhaps buying the plan for them *with* *bullion* is the bug.
---
I think 1000 is not that bad. I'd rather see stash space being upped at least to 1000.
---
*I N V E S T*
---
Over 9000
---
What's really annoying is you can't sell them to vendors too.  I'd be fine if they were able to be sold, instead having to drop and confirm their destruction is annoying.
---
I roll my eyes every time I read “I worked really hard...”
---
Doing what? Sitting there pushing buttons and pulling triggers with snacks and drinks at hand?
---
Me too first time round
---
This is what usually happens my guess is that it’ll be up around 12 est or 1 est
---
The true Fallout 4 cut content: Maxson vs Danse paper plane race
---
Thats the guy who was caught up in both blasts right?
---
&gt; **Gauss Shotgun**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;It benefits from ballistic bock and not high voltage hefe, implying that the gun is treated as a ballistic weapon. This is inconsistent with the gauss rifle and radium rifle being treated as both energy and ballistic weapons.
---
Has anyone verified whether or not the Grounded mutation affects the Gauss shotgun?
---
F76 devs are not know for implementing changes based on the opinion of their community. So yes, for once.
---
 Did that really upset you so much you had to leave a comment about it?
---
For better or worse, it's a fence, not a formal wall.
---
I don’t mind the delays, admittedly we have Bethesda a hard time when they didn’t tell us every detail and when to expect it and damn you all if there are any major bugs. 
---
What I don’t like is that we didn’t find out till the patch notes at the same time. If it won’t be out for a couple weeks, that means they should known at least a week or 2 ago that they weren’t going to make the deadline. Seeing as they didn’t even release an inside the vault the last 2 weeks, someone isn’t doing their job over in public relations.
---
We all hate that the event got delayed again.
---
But someone working on the artwork of the game has nothing to do with the technical side of an ingame event.
---
I 2nd that motion. I loved play survival until I got anxious, then switching to adventure for relaxation, and then back to survival when I was ready for more challenging content
---
Since players benefit from this, I‘d guess they fixed it. At least that’s how things usually work with Beth.
---
Players like a bug - instant fix
---
Game breaking bug - Nobody cares
---
well wait a second. maybe i shouldnt be trying to sell them to players...
---
edit: i mean one because i never thought about just tossing them for the hell of it, two because apparently im not the only one who doesnt use them.
---
3.50
---
Thank you for you condolences
---
&gt;How do you do that whole quote thing.
---
 After you go to reply to somebody, Try copy/pasting their words and you will see "quote" appear once the words you want to copy are highlighted.
---
Its still maintenance,here is how it looks when they are working on it to bring the game back online [https://youtu.be/bzJDimvPW1Y](https://youtu.be/bzJDimvPW1Y)
---
I hear ya. I'm not surprised they changed it, but it being referred to as an exploit just isn't right. Bug maybe, or unintentional game mechanic. But labeling it an exploit puts players who did it in the same column as people who duped items to sell for cash. Not cool.
---
I LOVE line In sand. I carry mines just for that. Nothing brings me more joy than laying mines all up by the spawn points and seeing the madness
---
2 and a half
---
no, but the cards - plural - themselves aren't showing up.  how can i craft five from one card ?  you see my point
---
if you buy five boiled water they all show up.  you don't craft with one, and make five crafted goods with it
---
It would be nice if it at least came in the same variants that the radio did.
---
(For that matter, the original jukebox really needs that option too).
---
They seriously delayed it? Whay about the BOS event?
---
This guy is alright :D
---
I know. Still excited!
---
Bugged me too
---
Yeah, mid september.
---
I mean... is that on the mods, or on the nature of redditbeasts?
---
Shielded Underarmor lining as well.
---
For science
---
Are you saying when you go to craft then it shows 0?
---
&gt; Characters in game show themselves as right handed
---
This is also part of the issue
---
Probably men.
---
They can’t even fix the texture map on a handmade skin, then made another one just as bad. I say maybe two hard working modelers in the art department.
---
Been doing this at least once daily since launch, haven’t seen a single paint. Got engineer outfits, science scribes, and atoms galore but... 
---
Not. One. Paint.
---
16x times the delay
---
It starts with piss poor management.
---
Neither?
---
100% agree. They are not effective. They only use they have is to throw them near your friends when they are not paying attention to have them react to posible floaters.
---
All valid and good points, would also like to know. Love the game but I wish there was less face palming due to the reasons mentioned above.
---
It’s just Todd Howard and his dog.
---
Spoiler alert: the dog does all the work
---
Hah, thanks, didn't notice. Yeah, my rural connection gets about 2 MB/s on a good day and it's not one of those days. Gonna be a while!
---
2 and their pet monkey named Floyd
---
Like 5 people
---
It's why I hope that the interior cell camping gives us more options and power for CAMP building. Interiors seem to work much better for many things.
---
The bigger issue is that none of the people who work on the game seem to actually play the game.
---
That is interesting to note, but not related to weapons. Bit of a stretch here, do you happen to have healing factor? That reduces the effectiveness of all chems, which I believe would include radshield. 168 sounds about right for that value, and maybe something to do with class freak could be boosting it up on the other server?
---
Cool, 
---
I´m just excited for it when it releases. I´m still working on a few personal goals in game and having fund doing so. So i´m not bored just yet.  I also recently started a new character that has some rules. And i'm enjoying it so much, 
---
1. No Fast travel, making me plan strategically where i'm heading next. A simple resource run to whatever location from my base becomes an adventure. Picking up stuff. Meeting random encounters (So many that i hadn't seen before) And there is a new one every 5 min. 
---
2. Taking my time with the story and missions. Reading every terminal and listening to every holotape. Deep exploring of the locations. I blasted through it all wanting to get to the endgame the first time. 
---
3. One star legendary items only and no Meta (Bloodied,junkies) Don't want to become OP.   
---
This has vastly improved my experience of the game and i´m loving it. Then some days i don't feel like it i just dick around with my level 198 bloodied stealth commando build with god tier gear doing SQB runs or whatever.
---
Hehe maybe you’ve changed my mind. So they do have a use.
---
See - I wasn't thinking microtransaction.  As much "junk" sinks.  
---
If you can create a junk sink - - that lets players keep expanding their base with a growing cost - you create a ton of new content.
---
However - if the guys sitting around with a million steel in their stash can clear that content out in 2 weeks, you got a problem.
---
These types of things used to be more common in online games before the "WoW" model came along.  (WoW model = every expansion completely obsoletes all existing items, and inflates the economy).
---
I remember one game - had an RP event - where we had to "donate" 7leaf swords.  (very rare, item, next to impossible to get).  They gave us all of the chance to do it - essentially.  And in return, those of us that did - got an even more "unique" item.  
---
Later down the road that item (that we donated) became easier to get.
---
Some men raid for sport
---
Others raid for food
---
The only thing I'm raiding for
---
Is an outfit that looks good
---
-
---
See my vest, see my vest
---
Made from real responder chest
---
Feel this sweater, there's no better
---
Than authentic Irish settler
---
I put the blame on the management/lead positions.
---
you can look videos from 40k warhammer painting (dry brushing, battle damage, weathering)
---
1000 scrip is fine, it’s the 150 a day that is awful. I’m sitting at max because I don’t have the space to store legendaries I don’t want.
---
I didn’t mind the delay at all, but they said it was going to be a couple weeks on the day of. That means they should’ve at least known for a little while that this wasn’t going to come out on time. Some heads up should’ve been given if they were going to give a specific release date.
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
I have s similar experience. If I want to swap between two weapons, lever and a pistol. I'll never get the same two weapons. I do get a random from my favorite wheel.
---
I don’t think she’s terrible. She’s good enough, but I think if she actually commented on something other than Gauley Mine, she’d be significantly better.
---
And if we could, you know, actually meet her.
---
Legendary Run, being mostly cosmetics and nothing of any consequence, means people who don't log in every day don't really miss anything. People who do log in can hit 6-7 dailies just by playing the game. So for those who do log in daily, get a fancy bauble. 
---
But then, I also don't understand people who complain about the grind, then complain the rewards are rubbish. Why grind when you can see what the rewards are and don't like them?
---
I guess I'm the wrong target audience for this, entirely.
---
Just because they are "able" to drop doesn't mean they will. I've known the fixer plan for a month and still have not gotten one from mumbles.
---
I have to admit, although I wouldn't necessarily want to see Frank Horrigan himself, I'd like to see the relationship between the Enclave, the Vault 79 Secret Service, and the Secret Service that led to Horrigan explored a bit.
---
Even though the Secret Service's presence in Vault 79 is logical - and actually is the oft-forgotten reason the real Secret Service came into existence (to protect the Treasury Department, not the President) - it's clear there was a lot more going on with the Secret Service and the relatively small picture we get at Vault 79 doesn't really do it justice.
---
Finally some fucking endgame content!!!! Now they should add a better loot table of legendary named items like off the survival challenges. We'll be tired of this damn colossus within a month. I hope some more shit comes troops!!!
---
Well, nobody's bought mine yet.
---
Lead by example and stop playing.
---
Can't decide if that Junk type PA skin is nice or not, I think it's the mismatched shoulders keeping me on the fence.
---
This.  Instanced CAMP interiors (whenever that gets implemented) will likely allow them to address the stash space/CAMP budget problem, but even 200 more pounds would make a huge difference in being able to manage a reasonably-sized stash.
---
The stashbox helps quite a bit, and anything's better than the 400 pounds they started us off with.  That just KILLED my enjoyment of the game back in the day.
---
"Finally! I am so tasty!"
---
Tried it myself, and for me the issue was damage falloff. Hit the target square in the face? Noice. Hit the ground 3 inches to the left? 30% damage at best. And the auto grenades are shockingly inaccurate. End result, I spammed a belt of the things to kill a ghoul. Slowly.
---
The pink costume with two heads and four dicks is a must have.
---
just got the final Christmas reward this past weekend!
---
wait whats wrong with SS underarmor??
---
It just works.
---
Wait, there's supposed to be a 30% cap on reload speeds? That would mean Lock and Load 3 by itself would hit the cap, but it still stacks with the +15% reload speed legendary. I have LMGs and .50s with that +15%, and they very clearly reload faster than those without. I never tested this with Speed Demon disabled, because I assumed it was the default.
---
&gt; . That puts it at 500 cork per player, which is doable by First subscribers only and without dupers.
---
Is it?  I have almost no cork;  but 60k steel.
---
You on PS4? I’ll take it off your hands for the right price.
---
It could have craft 10x for example and each one of those items has a chance at super duper going off. 
---
Surely it wouldn’t be that hard to sort out beens as it registers each click for super duper, even when spamming the click button.
---
Would be good, but highly doubt it’ll actually come about as we would’ve had it by now surely.
---
Thanks that will be the name of my build!
---
That's the thing though. NMS was unplayable and FO76 is playable. There's stuff to do, albeit not much end game. NMS turned it around entirely whilst Bethesda continue to bury themselves.
---
That's what is unacceptable and disgusting.
---
You do realize that there are duper’s out there that could probably finish this on their own.....
---
It is funny that not even Bethesda has control over Ward.  He's like an NPC that has become sentient.  He could rule Bethesda Austin, for all we know.
---
And yet you are still here.
---
I can't wait to kill these brotherhood fucks
---
The atom version is bugged. We don't know what class it is and cannot upgrade it.
---
We will see if Ward listens considering they said this in Patch 20 notes: **Ward:** Is now stationary and can now always be found sitting behind his desk in the trailer in Foundation.
---
Yeah, I heard that from older players and I thought hey, 800 is not that bad xD especially if you buy FO1st once and grind for a month you'll stock pretty much till the end of game. If they could at least make it so that display items didn't take space in both camp budget and stash this alone would be a lot better.
---
I'd probably say 50-100 people with an additional 1-5 for QA actively working on fallout 76.
---
The whole department has got to be about 250-350, being split between all the games they are working on and R&amp;D for their new game engine.
---
I have included it in an earlier list last year, but ultimately this seems to be intended because A) it's been brought to bethesda's attention hundreds of times and B) the mods have their own specific drop rates in the files
---
Mad respect to you for making such a detailed (and, sadly, long) list!
---
I think [the energy damage penetration problem explained here by The turtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3ekxolurho) is missing from the list. Aside of that, I had no idea so many weapons had problems ... that's quite concerning.
---
Science requires sacrifice.
---
Those... mutation serums came at a cost.
---
It could be optional, opt in or opt out to see "Community Pictures"
---
I usually just throw them at players lol
---
This is not necessarily true. I have the 15% blocking armor and limb damage (bloodied) gauss shotgun build. It can't knock the SBQ in one mag, that's for sure.
---
To be fair, Bethesda are one of the companies that allowed work from home during Corona. As someone who's worked from home for 5 years, I can say with absolute certainty, not everyone can work remotely at the same speed. And man do things get missed when everyone can't discuss things face to face.
---
I now Beths an easy target for delays and "it just works," memes. But a little benefit of the doubt wouldn't go amiss right now.
---
I’m guessing in total it’s probably a team of about 10, not all of them programmers.  That’s not a lot for a game this size.  After the game flopped my assumption is that they started pulling people from this game to another game and the remaining people are simply trying to maintain financial metrics so they don’t get pulled (and so they meet their own performance Requirements to get raises, not get fired, etc)
---
Ive got the game on both gamepass and steam, but use the gamepass version to play, seriously reconsidering it seeing as the patch is 49 gigs instead of the expected 1.4 :(
---
Solid Merit my friend, good list!
---
8GB on PS4
---
Meat week is seasonal. My understanding is colossal problem is here to stay. So does it matter?
---
I like the Bunker prefab.
---
PC
---
It's in my vendor for 9k caps. I'm not sure if that's in the right ballpark or not, but it undercuts all the others I've seen at 10k.
---
well... My guy has a big gun and I shoot it fast at the bad guys.. *runs off crying*
---
I sold one for 15k a few weeks back after I put it up at that price for a joke. If someone was willing to buy it for that, perhaps they'll pay north of 20k??
---
Changing the graphic was obviously a task they gave to their least-likely-to-succeed summer intern to complete.  Good on 'em that they got it done before having to head back to classes at South Central Louisiana State University (go Mud Dogs!).
---
They are fixing that in this update
---
This guy had a bunch of mini ones in formation with a snare drum. I messaged him saying that his camp was awesome and he said he was teaching them to march
---
😥😥😥   u r right....I have been duped.   GOD DAMN YOU BUGTHESDA!!!!!
---
Unfortunately it wasn’t very popular
---
The bloody chef outfit will probably work great with it.
---
Well, people like me who bought only one month of FO 1st to fill up a scrapbox would prefer the scrapbox to be used last. What happens is that now that I no longer have FO 1st, The scrap I get is deposited into the normal stash which takes up space. So I am glad that the stash is used up first - before the scrap box.
---
Any while they're at it, our screenshots will get deleted, other people's screenshots will pop up and our gallery budget will be decreased. ONE OF THESE WILL BE A FEATURE
---
I didn't want it sounding that I don't want it fixed as I thought I'd get down voted to hell as I want it to stay, can't moan at 3 levels for a event haha.
---
I found a 3 star fat man that was gonna be solid against scorched. I tested it on the scorchqeen and the test confirmed that that was a lie.
---
Still starting today. Technically everything they announced is coming to the game in this patch, they’re just shutting off the colossus event until they figure out some bugs.
---
... huh. I can probably take her down in 10 minutes or less by myself as a bloodied HW build, without using magic guns. While flying ONLY would be longer, but still... 20 players failed that hard?
---
AMD users have it worse, but this is something that needs to be looked at across the board.  The reflections are just glossy and terrible.  It made the world look more dreary in Wastelanders, but it makes the characters look like they are made of liquid metal whenever it rains.
---
Like, the other day, I put Polished on my Metal Armor Chest.  Polished used to be like you'd expect - steel gray and shiny like chrome, just like it was in Fallout 4.  Now, it's jet black with gloss.  And *everything* has gloss, even the leathery bits.
---
You didn't mention the hunting rifle. 
---
Legendary effect %25 ffr does not work in third person. 
---
The .50 optional recievers are all weaker, and add nothing to the weapon. For example, the refined .50 receiver lowers the attack a bit, instead of upgrading the fire rate further.
---
Thanks hope both of them get fixed.
---
awesome :)
---
I never said that I'm mad that its postponed, I just explained how time periods work with Bethesda, that's it
---
Sorry this is not a good reponse. Telling players to git gud is not a good response to a poorly designed system that allows griefing of non PVP players. 
---
Why does a player who is not interested in pvp need to "git gud"? 
---
Also how is getting broken weapons and armor when you are already maxed out on dmg at level 50 with a full set of 3 star legendary gear and maxed out defense and decent secret service armor...not getting gud? I am well equipped even though i could do better, i still should be able to stand a chance.
---
Also most of the fighting was done 2 vs 1 and my bro who is more well equipped than i was with a bloody explosive handmade still couldn't do any damage with mutations and perks and chems stacked,   
---
"git gud" against a dupped set of sent,/assassin armor that is hard to find and basically makes you into a god in comparison to who doesn't have it? This is the bad design that killed survival. Survival was canceled because not enough people were playing it, because of OP armor sets like this.
---
Need a plan so bayyyeddd

I have 19 of the plans...am an Encryptid grinder. Going to start selling them for 10k in my vendor.
---
Every other gun has between 10-20% learn chance for every individual mod. The radium rifle, for some reason, shares its mod percentages with armor pieces, with an average of 0.25% learn chance. That's why you rarely learn its mods. No idea why it's this way, but since it's all still learnable most people just overlook this.
---
two and half except on Thursdays &amp; full moons
---
Bruh, it seemed to be working well in the PTS
---
He's super immune to Magic damage. It works on him, but only about as well as a bloodied build does. youtuber AngryTurtle has tested it.
---
I have a 2 shot Gatling plasma that I slapped beam splitter onto. I have a 500 round flamesprayer that does absolutely horrid damage now. F in the chat
---
Let’s go just a bit W/SW into eastern/central KY a ways. Geographically similar, some really gorgeous landmark locations, Bluegrass Station if you go far enough west... not to mention the amazing themes you could build off our clan/family structures and hollows. You thought WV was wild and wonderful...
---
I think many of the problems stem from Cinemax. At least i would like to believe that the people have more ambition. I feel bad for those people
---
I'll keep using it then, maybe something I usually do prevents it. I'll also keep a lookout on the mods, I have gotten some reports of odd ones before, one other off the top of my head is a 10mm rapid receiver that apparently does nothing. Also a bladed mod, but I believe that's been fixed in wastelanders. There are probably many bugs related to mod boxes that have slipped past because so few people use most of them
---
Yes.  They need positive enforcement of good things they do because the bulk of this game has been done incredibly poorly, and I’m guessing it’s because of higher level management, not the rank and file dev.  The fact legendary perks weren’t thrown out there like the ammo converter is a good thing, the system has gone from awful to still awful with better cards, so perhaps it can end up decent with some work.
---
For those that haven’t been keeping up, check the official forums for discussion on the perk system.  There’s good discussion but naturally a lot of dreck too.
---
I'm gonna be honest, after a few of those drinks it does get more difficult
---
How is this not an improvement? According to the patch notes, junk that isn't already broken down will be prioritized *last* now, behind scrap from your inventory, stash, or scrapbox. It always auto-scrapped from crafting.
---
Why cant they added weekly limits instead of daily. Can still keep 1000 scrip limit but remove the daily 150 so if someone wants to mac their weekly in a day that's up to them
---
Don’t play Red Dead Online then.
---
This is 10x more content and fixes then that game does in a year.
---
He... might use his punishment to learn how to get off his bunk bed correctly now
---
oooh, any news about the new engine?
---
 **Ally: Crash Landing:** Logging out and back in after retrieving the Flight Recorder Data no longer prevents the quest from progressing. 
---
YES YES YES YES YES
---
I wanted the Glowing Skeleton one more than anything else, but got them all during the double XP period by Bush Wookie stealth.  I don't see a reason to have those rewards be limited time, let people earn them anytime!
---
Is that how you trigger this bug? Time to stop selling all my grenades. For real that bug is amazing. I leveled up from 240-243 in that event alone yesterday by just spraying my Vamp explosive 50 cal into the mob and racking up the xp on all the kills. Let that one stay.
---
Look for jj floppers on YouTube.
---
I just paid 9k for a plan for my alt. I think it's a fair price
---
I got the option to download the update around 11 so that’s done but currently still down for maintenance. Normally I’m working but I’m off today and just wanna get on before the wife and kid get home.
---
Scorchbeasts and the Queen especially have a significant amount of explosive damage reduction.
---
Slightly confused on your plasma rifle section - do you mean that this applies to both weapons, or only the Enclave variant?
---
Also - you can receive the nailer if you kill the Nightstalker while completely unarmed (good luck with that on a public server), which is a bloodied cultist blade.
---
&gt; get a pet and while you were in a dungeon you could send it off to sell your stuff for you
---
Finally those extra limbs and hands on the possum will have a purpose.
---
'For once' says they have NEVER EVER EVEN ONCE listened to players before this moment right here.  Not once.  Is that actually true or are you being hyperbolic?  Receipts?
---
I'm not upset by your post at all.  Just pointing out it might have been a little snarky.  Like a lot of posts are when the servers are down for a while and patches are being implemented.  It's when the salty posters seem to come out of the woodwork.  I'm more amused than anything.
---
BTW - your user name does NOT check out..... ;)
---
Well, with Bethesda, I don't think it matters how much attention is drawn to it.
---
Yea I thought it was a step in the right direction cause I've been affected by almost all the bugs they fixed here. But I have very low standards for the fo76 team tbh, if they don't fuck up the game more in a patch I'm content
---
Did you thin your paints?
---
Unfortunately it got delayed again, I just found out not too long ago
---
It should sell for that. I've sold a couple at that price, Xbox though
---
How about going to loot it with everyone else but all the loot within disappears?
---
Gotta love shared loot on enemies you helped kill.
---
Oh my goodness... Yet another phase of copying update file is going to come? This is sad... Someone needs to give Bethesda employees some ADHD meds so they are more thorough.
---
i could swear it specified it was casual as to not be a "pay to win" version of the normal underarmor
---
yep / 49GB ... sigh ... MS Store
---
Auto launchers are fun for a bit but the ammo cost v damage output makes explosive builds pretty poor unless you throw bloodied or junkies into the mix, a bit too much of a niche build is needed to make them worthwhile.
---
I want the nuka cola cooler that holds food. I was 30 atoms short when it was in the store recently and now I just keep an eye out for it.
---
I have been waiting for the dark knight skin to come back, but it will likely be a few more months until then. Does it noticeably change the weapon, or just alter the color scheme?
---
My bloodied guass minigun melt the sheepsquatch in about 3 seconds. Super easy to solo.
---
Ooh shit I can finally trade in all those goddamn grenade rounds!
---
Post FO3 capital wasteland would disagree.
---
I don't know what you're talking about.  Magic shotguns, at least in VATS, have range that would make Doomguy jealous.
---
I don't play PC, but maybe PTS update? Or is the PTS a separate client? I'm not really enlightened to that information.
---
Nah I understand better now, lol. I'm level 449 and yeah double XP weekend down there for me was amazing. Went up like 9 levels in the 1st day (obviously not through just line in the sand) and it brought me back to the beginning when I was getting perk cards like fortune cookies and was full of 'fun' build ideas. 😂
---
on the good news we just got the pocketed and deep pocketed limbs
---
Well at least I now have something useful for my arms.
---
Not often, but yeah.
---
Just read the patch notes, they fixed this. Well was fun while it lasted, rip
---
The Dying during Fail complete isn’t really that big an issue. I posted about it and a lot of people commented back telling me how you can just wait 10 minutes and you’ll be able to just spawn back in where ever. Still haven’t had a chance to try it yet but a lot of people were adamant that it’s not really an issue at all
---
Dogmeat always was a good boy.
---
Everything.
---
More options, more money for Bethesda.
---
Oh you crafty bastard you had me going there
---
Nope no cross platform yet. Doubt pc and console ever. So many hacks on pc
---
have you tried unplugging your server and plugging it back in?
---
Well damn, forgot about Healing Factors negative effect and now that i looked it up, your right, it is probably what's going on with my character cause i have both. Thank you for correction, it was very helpful and i now know it's not a bug in the game, which i am actually happy about.  😁
---
To point sarcasm you can finish the sarcastic portion of a message with /s
---
They didn’t make any comments on what they were fixing. I’m assuming it was a stability issue since a lot of their past updates seem to cause unexpected crashes in packed servers
---
I read the title and was immediately ready to come in here and lose my mind.
---
No shot 50 people are still working on this game. I'd say 10 at most.
---
that amazes me : the lack of notification compared to buying plans, for example.  when you visit a vendor you can see what plans are "(known)" and upon buying a plan, that plan is removed from the vendors inventory to prevent buying it twice
---
well, I'm no longer stuck at 30K at least
---
Todd Howard and the dribble he leaves on his cats chin, the cat doesn't really pitch in.
---
What I understood from reading the patch notes is that the event is available but still being worked on and tested for bugs. 
---
I think it’s out now but if they find any more bugs it will be taken out. Or simply I misread it, and the event might be delayed again. I’m at work so unfortunately I won’t be able to test it until 5pm.
---
They were really hit and miss the first year 76 was released, yeah. I'd say that since Wastelanders, I haven't experienced a patch that's been a net loss. New bugs rear their head, but nothing like the game-breaking mess we had back in the first several patches (or the infamous patch 13).
---
Yeahh we sure do. This is the best idea I've ever heard! /s
---
Still, they should have completely scrapped the terminal and just used a Vendor UI.
---
The ammo are broken down in arbitrary categories, and terminals are affected by Field of View, meaning that people who like a wide FoV (I have mine at over 100) either have to go and change it every time or have to guess what the ant sized text says, or if eyesight is bad enough, avoid using the terminal altogether.
---
Ah I see undergoing maintenance.. Their maintenance man is getting there slowly to fix the broken machine.
---
Couch and big fireplace.  Yessssss.....
---
Time to scrap another couple of defensive walls so I can actually have the budget to build them.
---
Haven't tried that yet. Been beating it with a hammer to no avail. Will do this next. Thanks!
---
&gt;Kind of strange though???
---
Honestly, not even remotely abnormal, a lot of online games have had patch data go out and update before their server side work is completed.
---
Soooooo, no event? And meat week during the week im out of town?
---
Nah, all guesses. Saw some footage from it though, it seems to be using photo telemetry.
---
Also heard that starfield is using the same engine and they had difficulty getting it to work right with their concept. It's all the creation engine just version 3.0.
---
Same thing, but happens to all my 'nades. Throw one and hit VATS. You can popp them when time is right.
---
Hate this reference thank you
---
I don't pvp outside NW really, but I guess it's best to remember that the "skill" in this game is mostly RPG maths skill? The lag and physics silliness make actually trying to do combat silly 95% of the time (even in NW). The bad connectivity means that most of the game has to take place before it is actually rendered (in your mind). I can't get ADS to work well enough to ever consider real pvp in any case of the game.
---
Today's patch updates the converter, so hopefully scrapping will be a LOT faster.
---
Nooooo. Just you. Maybe you got banned?
---
What’s wrong with the under armor?
---
You are not on the microsoft store. Your on x box gamepass on pc. Which is different and for some inexplicable reason a giant ass update.
---
I see what you did there.
---
I started a new character when I came back to the game a month or so ago and I have over 300 cork. So I'm assuming if I actually tried I'd easily hit 500.
---
I also think Bethesda assumes Wood and Steel get used more often than they actually do.
---
I just yeet them downrange. Startled my wife a couple of times with their sounds while she has her Pip Boy up.
---
With 15 base and a full set of unyielding armor my INT hovers around 30-35 depending on team bonuses.
---
YES PLEASE!  And I'm not being sarcastic here.
---
The time when these patches get dropped up to when the servers go back on line are so salty and angry.  People need to joke more.
---
I'm going to go out on a limb and say right now that my monthly allowance of Atom is going to fall short today.
---
I swear I saw someone with a CAMP ally that had those goggles on yesterday.  Might have been red-lensed Nukacap glasses, if those were ever a thing.
---
Why update size on PC that different?
---
It just adds the different colors. The glitch with the large mag and front sights ring happens on the normal Gatling gun and the dark knight skin
---
Scorched, Vaccine and My Blood is in it.
---
I finally have the full collection!
---
And now it can be stuck in your head. Lol. Sorry.
---
No their range doesnt improve with the magic effect, all they do is bugged damage. Their range is a joke compared to every other weapon.
---
Keep in mind - there used to be that CAMP budget that people would abuse to get themselves a higher than normal budget. That could account for those camps that you saw.
---
I can. With a Junkies limb damage minigun with an accelerated barrel. She just melts. The magic happens when the rate of fire is greater than 200
---
Edit: Bloodied isn't one of the prefixes that triggers the bug
---
They cannot be dropped or sold, sadly.
---
That actually makes sense
---
I feel your pain, I got mine right after Fasnacht and still haven't gotten one to roll, same with bear arm, also haven't gotten a sheepsquach staff and I've known it longer. Think much game is stuck on pipe pistols, railway rifles, and walking canes as of late.
---
Same here.  Bit shocking really.
---
Tomorrow the duping will start 😂
---
Is it arms and legs? Theres no mods for anything but chest so far right?
---
You can get rid of I think 10x to 100x more now
---
I don't mind holiday-exclusive content, but I was definitely stoked to get that Glowing Skeleton. I wear the mask full time!
---
I won’t lie, they aren’t super useful, but honestly? I’d rather keep them. They’re a new item that’s decently powerful, at least against other players if nothing else. Yes, you have to manually drop them... or just chuck them off your nearest bomb disposal cliff.
---
Almost as bad as the fog effect in the mine itself.
---
9k is a fine price, as you've seen 10k is standard, 12-15 if you're not needing the caps now and willing to let it hang.
---
Maybe it's a PC thing due to dupping?
---
wh...what?? why the hell would they do that?? bot even in the vending machine?
---
I need it so bad. Those glasses are so fucking cute.
---
I only started playing the game (long time fallout player, however) - about 5 weeks ago.  (included some vacation time, and with covid, plenty of gaming time).  
---
I have 60k steel;  1200 cork.  Heck, almost up to 4k gears.  But only 1200 cork.
---
Wood is a strange one for me;  I'm actually on a slow burn right now.  (I use more cooking then I'm bringing in)
---
Edit:  To rephrase it a different way;  unless there was a specific reward I'd get from giving 500 cork (that I wouldn't get from giving another 2k steel), I just wouldn't "waste" the cork giving it to them.  
---
and I imagine a lot of others will do the same
---
Steel - on the other hand... if they are counting in real time, I imagine they'll max that out in 1 hour.  Why?  I know myself - I'll be handing in 50k steel without blinking.
---
"Wait, on second thought, we meant to do that."
---
Always was
---
Ah that makes sense. I've got a low base and am wearing no unyielding piece. I'm working on grinding out a player who will wear them but I need good stealth on the armor too.
---
Oh look on the bright side, not the nuke side.
---
I've got the update downloaded and ready to go as well. I'm guessing around 1.
---
That's no fun. Better to be a smart ass. Now that's fun!
---
What the person above said, don’t delay it on the same day
---
This was.....poetic! Points for using "subsumed"!
---
This is true
---
hey, i did also some research, and you can in fact open and log into the game client multiple times, activate a different character and log in many characters of the same account at the same time\^\^

And he had to learn some new tricks to develop the game
---
400 employed by Bethesda working on elder scrolls and fallout. No idea of the split or if they rotate in and out or are game specific leads.
---
What’s the chance of having the daily scrip limit increased ,especially during purveyor sales? Spend 1000 on weapons and you are obese for days.
---
That is super unfortunate
---
I've only found Cherry, Quantum, and Cranberry in the wild. I bought a Dark from a player vendor. I want the other flavors real bad
---
I may or may not have messaged you regarding a query you may or may not have had
---
Bethesda is like that lazy boyfriend who doesn’t want to break up but is too lazy to seriously try and attempts makes up for it with little whimful distractions.
---
They provide us with the toilet paper in game.
---
*Also most of the fighting was done 2 vs 1 and my bro who is more well equipped than i was with a bloody explosive handmade still couldn't do any damage with mutations and perks and chems stacked,*
---
Your bro, huh? The ineptitude must be genetic.
---
No, but the mods for arms and legs are sorely lacking compared to everything else.

This,

*Guessing* The one showing was a pre-existing one

"But we gave you one for killing a 3\* Legendary yesterday!  That's different, right?"

I certainly wouldn't want to wait until an update was finished to start downloading the update files.
---
You never know what is and isn't a bug here. I had to make a lot of calls like that trying to figure out whether something is intended, like the MIRV explosions or dragon bayonets for example
---
I'd be veeeeeery careful with that. Any game I have ever played that has had a method of multi-boxing has always treated it as a ban-able offence. Hell, it is probably even outlined in the ToS.
---
Think of it this way.. a four man party composed entirely of your own characters, three of which have 15 Charisma to share rank 5 perks. Basically multi-boxing in this game could only be seen as an exploit.
---
PC (Xbox Game Pass Beta): [1.3.3.24](https://1.3.3.24) (49.6GB)
---
For some damn reason...
---
Notes about fixing the bug where you stop damaging enemies with energy weapons which should make it nicer to use.
---
Not on the tent bug though.
---
There's an update on your end and on their end.  The one on their end is still in progress, regardless of what you're doing on your end.
---
Nope.  If you don't want to use them or waste stash space on them, your only option is to destroy them.  Silly.
---
LooooooL Bugthesda 😅 so what did they break while fixing adrenaline ???
---
Oh yeaa i forgot about the patch today, I’ll check it out
---
Faster than others, even when only shooting at a single target, with gunsmith 5, 200% repair and no muzzle mod. It breaks stupid fast, just like laser weapons used to, but people dont use them so the community outcry to fix it was non existent
---
Not really. Mainly because this game is built from another game and honestly, I think they used to much from FO4.
---
I’m also glad they delayed or a few weeks rather than put out something that would glitch.
---
I'm not on the game yet but im expecting something else game breaking they haven't failed to break something every patch
---
I remember doing some testing a while back, and having speed demon drastically reduced the effectiveness of the reload speed legendary effect. The end result was almost the same with and without the effect as long as you had speed demon
---
Of course it was... just don’t release it Bethesda. Your killing all the hype for it like your a professional.
---
I had issues like that in the last few days, too. But not only with legendaries. But when it happens with the legendaries it's worse, because of the loot.
---
If things were delayed occasionally, I would be fine. But what really angers me is content being promised within roadmaps, and getting delayed to then be supplemented/considered content for the next DLC wave (like display cases with wild Appalachia being moved to the nuclear winter DLC).
---
Aww..
---
My brother was an addict and died because of drug overdose. Why does Fallout 76 have drugs in the game?
---
I hear you! I just have it in my inventory. And use it when i get/ loot ammo for it.
---
Nope.
---
Bethesda hasn't given an exact reason, so the current theory is that because they are a plan purchased with gold bullion, they're treated like other "player bound" items. Similar to how you can't paint your buddy's armor with a skin from the Atomic Shop and drop it, you get the warning that dropping will destroy the item. Same popup appears if you try to drop or sell the floater grenades.
---
If this happened the following would also happen: players who paid for rank would begin to get atoms meaning their paid sub would effectively be free. Players who don't have time nor can afford rank up would complain that those with money get rank and more goods than those who don't. Doesn't make sense
---
I think it’s good they’re tradeable for better or worse, but they definitely need to make these plans actually worth something. Granted this game has a lot of good samaritans that will drop random rare players just because they don’t care about putting in the effort to get caps for it or don’t realize their value. 
---
The game really needs a better established economy and caps valuing system and probably reduce the ways we can get multiples of the same plans often so we aren’t destroying the value of in game items by just playing a lot. 
---
Quests shouldn’t be attached to another player’s actions though, unless it’s dailies like cop squatter where someone kills the creature you needed to clear from a location.
---
I have a hard time with whether or not we should get our teammates rewards. It’s a life-saver in red rumble with the hordes coming from all sides, especially when you can’t get a hit on the legendaries fast enough, but SBQ it’s a bit difficult to rationalize. I think Bethesda expected all their bigger events to be made for teams of 8 though. Anymore then that it’s easy to hide behind the lvl 300’s with PA
---
Well that’s dumb, but not surprising
---
With regards to the light machine gun the clip almost never goes down to 0 when fired, it reloads and different numbers randomly
---
The purveyor is very clearly rigged, the rate you get weapons you need plans for is vastly lower than the common junk. I just hope quest reward rates are more fair for them.
---
How anyone can go a month plus without a single Fixer or Bear Arm from her and just blame it on RNG is mind boggling. Maybe if it was just them, but it happens to nearly everyone.
---
It is Not in the patch notes.... ☹️
---
Three is well below the weekly quota. Gotta up your game otherwise things will not go so well with the quarterly review...
---
I thought they were intended for PvP. I keep a few handy for trouble makers.
---
\+1 for Fuzzy Brenda
---
When the servers come up you can look for me. I go into the wendigo came every day to get fungus. Easy to clear it out for you. "Mcg nj"
---
I did mention the ffr, it affects all bolt- and pump-action weapons, not just the hunting rifle. Last I checked I thought the .50 cal receivers were a slight upgrade with the base .50 cal having the highest damage, but I can look into it a bit more
---
I’ve seen comments that Action Boy/Girl was broken but I tested on all my characters (just using a timer to see how long it takes to refill with and without the perk card) and it was definitely working for all of them, even with or without AP bonuses on their armor.
---
Ooof nevermind
---
Personally,  after a fill in the blank level, all passive non combat skills should just not need cards. Lock pick? Hacking? Construction? Fast travel? Hard bargain? Seriously.
---
How is it that they continue to ignore Speed Demon turning Stimpacks into a can of Keystone Lite every single patch???
---
And now if u build it. Put a poster on it and two display cases on top. Put anything in the first display case delete the ammo machine. Log out. Change server log in and build a flower pot you get a brand new shiny dupe.
---
well it’s a guess, based on some projects i’ve done at work and the turn around time that small team has had
---
hmm, that's true.
---
Still, i bet that since they tolerate game changing mods, they do at least tolerate someone who just logs in his characters to transfer items between them. I don't want to find out though
---
Yeah wtf I left it in rest mode to auto download and it didn't do it. Now I have to wait almost an hour.
---
Yes! No more super punji trap camps!
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
Im going to do a few and see what it's like. If it seems like the plans or drop rate for anything is horrible, I'll opt out. Now if the rewards included ridiculous amounts of ammo, I'll grind out on all of them. At least that way I'll feel like it's an equivalent exchange for my time, something I'd grind out anyways as well as a chance at something shiny.
---
Yeah I checked her right before the servers went down for mantainence, it's the same as Camden. I guess I'll just have to make an alt to get the outfit
---
Oh yeah I get where they're going with it, but it's just rather jarring to my eye. It's the upcoming vertibird style PA that I'll be keeping an eye out for.
---
I like floater grenades
---
I can confirm they don't do anything
---
Could be worse...for some strange reason it is 49.6GB on Game Pass for PC.
---
Yet it gives the option to upgrade with SS lining,vut they don't apply
---
I hadn't thought of that. I bet you're right.
---
I don't know which idiot decided to base them off the nuka quantum grenade but their explosive radius is so small they are worthless.
---
Damn I was trying to manifest the release of that communist commander outfit and the plain CRA handmade skin since I figured the commie stuff would be out today. Maybe someday.
---
Does it hit once or twice per shot? The beam splitter is bugged to only hit once on a normal gatling plasma, but now I'm curious to see if two shot affects that at all
---
I'm in the same boat, looks by far the best PA skin available.
---
Or the discover bog town one :(
---
Right, because bethesda told you that face to face right? lmao
---
Haha good cause sometimes my thoughts only sound smart to me. 
---
If they released the event in this patch but just shut off the ability to start it that’d mean all the assets that could cause problems should be in the game without the worry of players crashing during the event.
---
I did the SBQ event, then ended up running into two separate 3\* SBs while walking from Bog Town to the quarry site...couldn't believe seeing TWO 3\* SBs.
---
Those walls better be placeable... The amount of trouble i have walling off my camp is ridiculous... Theres alwayse something messing with my plans.
---
It’s really just me.
---
actually, going with Master Infiltrator is bad advice. Rather, go with Legendary ability. At max level, you get +5 to each special. Assuming you arent running Precision or Intelligence, you will get 5 more points to equip picklocking and hacking cards. If you are playing a max intel and perception build, then I guess Master Infiltrator would help the quality of life of not having to swap cards often.
---
Well, they screwed themselves with their fundamental choice to have it be an 8-player event.
---
There are so many things wrong with that approach.  If it were 4-player, like Vault 94, then you could reasonably expect to get your whole team in.  The current approach is completely first-come-first-serve.  No guarantee that you and your teammates will be in the same instance.  And if you happen to be in that orphaned instance with one other person, good luck.
---
And then, is it even worth the bother?  Almost two years later, people still show up and fight the SBQ.  It's a fun, server-wide event that lets you test your mettle and show off.  You don't get that in the dank, foggy mine.  Once people get the unique plans, and maybe a Cursed Weapon, will they even bother with A Colossal Problem?  It's extremely resource intensive and the rewards hardly seem worth it.
---
To me, nukes were conceived as a kind of portable Raid zone.  Wherever you put them, you should face an interesting, tough onslaught of enemies.  The Wendigo Colossus could have easily been that "alternate boss" that we've been asking about, and that's how it should have been deployed, not this confused thing.
---
Joe
---
You’ll be to busy duping with the inevitable screw up they make every new update. Hope it’s armour this time
---
Yeah I saw that too but it worked for me. When I got the SS jetpack and adrenaline broke I swapped to action boy and it made a real difference. I really notice it when I swap in ammosmith and forget to swap back. 
---
I’m gonna be in a dilemma now with adrenaline.
---
It really cheapens their endgame boss. Most people are wasting ammo on a flying one star tire iron.
---
I don’t dupe, wouldn’t risk being banned
---
DAM IT they didn't fix the RED Rocket Door :(
---
I’d say more
---
It’s... frustrating, yeah. But I don’t even use power armor, let alone T-60, so it’s fine I guess.
---
At least the notes don't weigh anything unlike all the guns I have to store for scrip.
---
I'd even be happy with a note system for scrip... let me scrip as much as I want.
---
I have a weightless AA fatman and a bloodied RW M70 both of which are fun with low tier mobs.
---
I love it, looks like the Old World Blues jukebox.
---
You can get it free with Fallout 1st sub.  
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger\_armor\_outfit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ranger_armor_outfit)
---
It's an Fallout 1st exclusive item.
---
Kind of, it's been like that since the release of this game with everything, so pretty much
---
400...lol...it started at 200lbs
---
Works well for ghost spaceman!
---
It should affect both, the enclave variant is just a reskinned plasma rifle without learnable mods. I do know about the nailer, but I think it's just a rare drop from the event. I found two or three of them despite never using melee or unarmed
---
I'm not sure, but I read it as the event has been added to the game files with this update, but will not switched on until 'the coming weeks'.
---
Bruh I thought the blue screen of death happened on me but it was just a damn update now I gotta redownload this massive broken game
---
I completely agree to be honest. It's so dumb
---
"Free"
---
Basically yea :(
---
The **CPD Tactical Ranger Outfit and Helmet** is part of Fallout First. The variant color schemes and designs were monthly bonuses for Fallout First.
---
1. It was a joke 2. Me either and 3. I’m not sure why not they basically endorsed it by letting everyone back and let them keep their nefarious loot
---
It just barks!
---
They always have their patches available for download soon after they start the maintenance. And like another person said, most games do the same thing so ppl don't have to wait any longer than the maintenance time to be able to get back in the game.
---
This kind of logic deserves more upvotes than the negative, sarcastic comment you replied to.

The Ranger Armor is actually a Fallout 1st bonus. It’s simply cosmetic, but I purchased the subscription literally only for the armor. They added a desert camo variant before my subscription ran out, but I didn’t care for it.
---
Thanks to you both. That's cool but also a shame. That's my favorite outfit in the series
---
It is an exclusive outfit for Fallout 1st members. You can buy Fallout 1st even for one month and receive it. It won’t go away as you’ll have it even after you cancel the subscription.
---
Great list and dead on as I've had to deal with a number of these. Don't even get me started on the gauss shotgun in NW. It is the buggiest weapon in that mode. Won't reload or let you heal or let you run until you hostler it or go to pip boy etc.
---
I dont mind it if you just click what you want then hit the back button you will skip 2 screens thats what i do.
---
There no ncr outfits, only ranger(riot - normal, advanced, elite)
---
Normal version always available, others was limited for FO1st
---
And acting like elitist pricks the whole time.  They've been like that since FO1.
---
I take em from anyone...only need 3 to get ammo points
---
This cave is so annoying its a labyrinth with shit loot
---
They also had the Advanced Ranger Armor at some point, with the extra pads and shit, but I missed out on it. Sad face.
---
It’s not the BoS requesting anything, it’s just some guy.
---
I'll have to consider that thank you.
---
So your just here to antagonize and be toxic instead of engaging in meaningful discussion where you actually address the points instead of cherry picking for attacking? You understand what you are doing is against the rules? You are not adding to the discussion you are just demeaning.
---
You never even addressed the fact that i am not interested in PVP and was specifically referring to griefing of other players.
---
Also when someone has maxed out dmg for normal players with bloody explosive but because he doesn't have sent/assassi. armor he can't do dmg with multiple perks/chems stacked. Then you know its broken and something needs to change.
---
Even if we could kill the guy he could just endlessly comeback and keep griefing you and it would be a pain in the ass to kill him each time. When you already are low on scrap and materials this is the WORST when someone just decides to ruin your workshop and doesn't even want it for himself.
---
I have an anti-armor missile launcher I've been using for about a year and a half, I know it breaks quickly but in my experience it doesn't seem to be much faster than the m79 or fat man. The fastest breaking weapon by far is still my TSE dragon. I think if anything, it might be that the durability damage is double dipping since (I assume) most people use the targeting computer, and the direct impact still counts as a hit
---
Too bad I've learned to live without it. I also learned my damage output (bloodied) is way more than enough as is. Like more than enough! Its a shame too because I always liked using that perk before they broke it.
---
But I hope other people will still benefit from it.
---
Thank you and i need this.
---
I still don't really understand how the Ammo Converter became a thing before Bulk Ammo did.
---
Bulk Ammo seems a heck of a lot more straightforward and versatile.  You could sell it to the robo-vendors or in your own machine.
---
I remember there being a daily score challenge a while back for fat man kills. I had amazing fun in Grafton with it smashing radtoads and SM’s with it. 
---
In the pursuit of Build finishing it’s easy to forget that some stuff considered crap and pointless is still amazingly fun if you just stop caring about max performance for a while, and that mission reminded me of that for sure. 
---
It also then made me go exploring other things. I set myself a challenge of wandering with no fast travel places I wouldn’t ordinarily care about, using a random bloodied revolver I found. I set myself the challenge of using all 400-odd rounds I had on me whilst accomplishing my mission. 
---
From small acorns...
---
Not enough. It's Howard's few slaves that have trouble getting their heads out from underneath his desk. "Fall in everybody, big update today and we need all you brownnosers to get this done lickity split so start slurping"
---
They’re not treating us with any respect though, like I’ve said, it just wouldn’t be an issue that popped up today, I made plans for the release, I know people that took the day off of work for the release, it’s just not acceptable really, they at the very least could have given some notice
---
Strange. 1.4gb update here on the steam store. 
---
Probably redownloading the whole game for you
---
It does. If you look below the text of it in the Atom Shop it very clearly states the under armor is part of the casual group.
---
Yes, this would also be a great part of endgame content.
---
 Like the imperial city in  the elder Scrolls online. 
---
Also people who don't like PvP won't be harrased in adventure, since they can remove adventure pvp when survival is back and stays for ever.
---
Legendary perks better not come out in the next patch. the system is so grindy and awful that it is insulting.
---
Have I been stalked? Are you that boy who turns off the Internet?
---
That would almost be as cool as if he would get the fuck out of the way when I'm trying to place a camp item in building mode instead of telling me for the 100th time that day that I should just let him know if he's in the way.
---
They only delayed the wendigo event.
---
Yeah serve maintenance (on PS4)
---
To be honest, I don't remember.  What brought this issue to my attention was yesterday while playing, the 10,000 caps trophy popped while I've had over 20,000 caps for several months.
---
My original, highest level character is a shotgun build, and you are absolutely correct on the rubber banding, it's really annoying. And some enemies will not fall, but then fall a second later, even if you don't shoot them again. 
---
In general, the shotgun damage seems sub par compared to other damage types, and that is on top of the ridiculous plastic farming you have to do just to fire it. It can take me, fully perked, 2-7 shots per high level enemy, if not more. With 10 plastic per 21 shells, that's a lot! I can go through 1000 a good play session easily. It would be nice if Shotguns could be looked at and brought into line with the performance of other weapons, and the rubber banding issue looked at (honestly, that might do it by itself). It's bad enough you need like 20 perk cards just to make shotguns work at that level...
---
Have this same issue. I just resorted to pressing Windows button and then closing it in task manager.
---
Sorry, by affects I meant that the bug affects all of them and none of them benefit from faster fire rate in third person
---
Duly noted on the rifle.
---
That is odd on the nailer. The only times I’ve ever got the nailer is when I did the challenge, but maybe it just guarantees it.
---
It was mediocre on ps4 always a half full server. But not many used it for PvP, just for PvE farming since it had a 1.5x XP boost.
---
Gatling plasma also doesn't benefit from hefe or bock
---
Has anyone recieved the BoS paint?
---
That’s pretty much what I tried to explain in my comment. Did not know about the xcell and overdrive tho, but I don’t usually use the chems. I’ll have to start selling them in my vendors vs selling to robots
---
I couldn't remember off-hand so I googled it but didn't go back far enough.  You're right.  I probably have 200 pounds of chems alone in my stash right now.
---
Forager Ally is supposed to give quests?! I thought he was just there to bully me.
---
Yep.
---
my computer is lucky i wasn't drinking something when i read this.
---
\#needsmoreupvotes
---
Yeah, what might be an idea is to look on the marketplace subreddits, or to really grind it, the best place imo is to go to the Whitesprings Bunker, and in the military wing, can usually get 1-10 pieces of technical data, you'll want to make sure you're only taking one each time though so a lot of return trips.
---
My main uses T-60 power armour though so I felt it was more important to grind it though.
---
Also, from a fluff view point, it's kinda funny to be stealing technical data from the Enclave to give to the BoS!
---
Well next time snap a pic! 😊
---
Bethesda site says that there is server maintenance going on for the last two hours.
---
Why?
---
Out of interest as you are the same build type as me, do your bullets go to 0 before they reload as recently my handmade and fixer keep reloading when it says there are 7 bullets left in the mag. 😔
---
I accidently kill random settlers sometimes. I was hoping it would be there same
---
Interesting, I'll have to look into that. I have an instigating railway I often use but I don't really use vats in my regular playing
---
i agree sm with point 2; am an archer myself and this has bugged me since day 1 sine the bow came out. it would make more sense for the character design considering how they hold all other weapons and i think make it easier for a 'look over the shoulder' view point.
---
Don’t forget that there’s a secret chest near the entrance of the mine that you can get as it’s collapsing
---
And an 8.8 GB update for PS4. At the current download rate, I might be able to logon in about 2-3 more hours. Zzzzzz
---
If you haven't started a second character, I've read plenty of people stating that they unlocked stuff that way. Haven't done it yet, but I'm going to try it, too.
---
I don't know what specific case brought about this change, but I know that every time they touch this system, *something* goes wrong.
---
The PS4 update is so fucking slow i feel like i am getting the update by mail good news i will only miss 3-5 days of the grind so the servers will be up by then.
---
It’s on the “million and 1 bugs to fix” list 💪🤜
---
I have some test data and plan to get more for a full fledged post. But one data point is as follows:
---
Super mutant overlord: 182 DR, 110 ER
---
Me: Commando 9/Bloody Mess 3, no armor pen perks or weapon mods, full HP
---
J25 Handmade (base: 52, modified: 144) did 66 damage to the chest
---
J25 Laser gun (base: 50, modified: 138) did 52 damage to the chest
---
If you plug in 144 for all damage values in the DR formula, you get the observed 66 damage per shot with the 144 damage handmade.
---
If you plug in the 50 base damage against armor in the energy resist formula, you get the observed 52 damage per shot with the 138 damage laser gun.
---
It makes me glad I never spent gold on them, they're worse than Frag Grenades!
---
i just wish i actually used any of the things i've bought.
---
Wish we could sell stuff that's skinned and it just removes it.
---
NO PLZ STOP MY WALLET CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE
---
If you gave a jetpack, there is a shortcut to quickly find the wendigo
---
There was an AMA a month or two ago and they said it was gone for good due to lack of interest.
---
i really want the vintage football uniform, grafton tracksuit and vtu tracksuit to come back. they're all underarmors but seeing them return would be great!
---
500 employees, 2 actual developers that just graduated from university and knew shit about the engine, 1 graphics designer that hurt his arm recently and why the Atomicshop is now also turning downwards too, 2 CMs that are only let out a few times a week to actually be present, 1 janitor that's taking better care of the building than the devs of the game, 494 CEO's and other upper-management that are busy jerking each other off on their private islands somewhere in the caribbean and only phone in once every few weeks to completely rewrite whatever plan they gave their devs the month before... So I would say a good amount of people.
---
When is this released?
---
easily my favorite part of the game, I probably move my base minimum once a week lately
---
Beckley as well.
---
\*BgS
---
Only three of them too.  I could see nuke poaching becoming more of a common thing, unfortunately, as one person might want to hit Monongah while another wants to hit the Queen, but the two are mutually exclusive.
---
Yea I’m over it.
---
Collectrons I'd like to see.  
---
Nuka Cola- Nice idea  
---
Woodsman- Default mode collects wood scraps and flowers, alternate mode collects meat, hides, antlers, and arrows/bolts. Voice lines from the Monty Python lumberjack song.  
---
Mini-Motherlode- Geologist mode collects ores, Hydrologist mode collects acid, oil, and water (dirty, toxic, boiled, and pure)  
---
Teach-o-tron- Repurposed teacher, modes for different classes with different scrap tables (homeroom, gym, music, science, art, home ec.), each mode has a rare chance to collect a relevant magazine. Voice lines either random facts or random schools rules like "no running in the halls"  
---
Neighbor-tron- Collects the cliche'd "cup of sugar" and other things you borrow from neighbors. Domestic mode collects things like salt, sugar, pepper, milk, eggs. Garage mode collects random shop tools and gardening implements like shovels.
---
Don't tell PETA about meat week.
---
If they have to give them to us (for some reason), at least let us sell them at vendors.
---
I remember that shotguns were considered really bad for a long time, and I could swear that they used to only have their total damage spread out across all pellets. Now they seem to sort of deal all their damage per pellet, but this gets auto corrected outside VATS, so the shotguns are much better than intended. Yet by being much better than intended, they perform as you would expect them to
---
They had it coming
---
its be allot easier to hit dates if they didn’t spend 2 weeks of every month fixing what they just broke
---
Since "Fat Man" is a specific name of the item I believe the proper use would be 1 Fat Man, 6 Fat Man. If you wanted to add the plural you would attach it to the description of the item rather than the proper name...so in this case "launcher" becomes "launchers" and the proper name of "Fat Man" remains unchanged.
---
eg. I found a Fat Man
---
I found 3 Fat Man launchers.
---
That would be my best guess on this.
---
I love them all
---
LOL Level up in one shot :)
---
Make sure you can build all three of the BOS under armour mods as according to wiki paints won’t drop till you can.
---
Thanks, gonna do some more testing with the drinks in general
---
You know, speaking of weapons; I'm having some interesting effects with the turbo-fert grenades. Are they supposed to cause damage cause i know they are only for your camps garden but i accidentally killed a raider below my camp ( i use the pylon near the elevator as my camp) with one of these grenades.
---
I have a two shot and a bloodied and they both just melt
---
THIS
---
Please tell me about it,I have the marsupial mutation
---
You could be right, if we can find some non essential BOS troops wandering around like we can with the raiders/settlers maybe my hope of cannibalizing them will come true. Eating the ones around the bog and Fort Defiance through their power armor is okay but I want some fresh meat. Here's hoping...
---
Are you trying to kill me?  Alcohol poisoning long before I trip the SCORE challenge....
---
Chally the moo-moo is in on it!
---
They are the same event genius
---
Just don't buy AMD again. It's not worth the headaches.
---
That’s exactly what I had to do. I’ve been playing one character since the beta and that toon is now over level 550. I always had to laugh when I did not have the very first trophy awarded for not leaving vault 76. I recently made a new character and have finally been awarded some of those early game trophies that i missed out on initially.
---
I mean that's a job for someone in the art team to fix not one of the developers.
---
Last Laugh and Cola Nut are my go-to perk shares. Both fun, and few people realise the benefits of a Nuka Quantum while perked up.
---
I do not have those unlocked yet, so can't really say. Wouldn't be surprised if they were just a copy paste of some grenade with an additional effect applied though
---
Brilliant! I have one that has 90% reduced weight.
---
I throw them for fun when I don't want to waste real ammo. Anything low level is getting floated.
---
this comment aged like milk....damn you Bethesda
---
Agreed
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
I’m gonna play the other side here. 
---
If it’s broken, why would we want it in the game? 
---
8 player max per instance? That’s just silly. Splitting teams? What if you’re player 9 to join and you get stuck solo? That needs fixing IMO, and I’m hoping that’s part of why this was delayed. 
---
Sure, their reputation is overwhelmingly negative, they don’t fix shit, they deserve the negative press for the mess this game was, but a slight delay of something that would break the game MORE is fine by me.
---
I wish! I would keep logging on everyday. It’s the first time in the past year or so that I haven’t logged on. It’s a strange feeling for sure
---
Amazing or. Can we prepare for the legendary perks in winter to come the loadouts in 2023 and the instantiated camp at the earliest in 2030 or how?
---
I got a refund and use it for NW. Still really upset.specially because I already accidentally scrapped 2 of my normal SS underarmor. I basically bought it for this reason,not show up when scrapping.
---
And who do you think hired the art team? Dogmeat?
---
Interesting. I'll do what I can to look into it, good thing I didn't scrip the lasers I used for testing yet
---
I feel bad because I bought plan from someone on here for 5k caps. Then next day did event for the plan. Still have it, but went to purveyor got a fixer that first time. It was a mutants, then rolled another zealots. Then last week I got so lucky with 3 bloodied rolls in a row from her and one was my bloodied fixer. Prefixes aren’t the best but better then nothing. I can trade the ones I have other then bloodied if on Xbox
---
Oh boy! Bobblehead stand paint here I come!
---
Yeah typical Beth. As soon as I read the patch notes, I remembered me commenting this.
---
I guess the joke is on us this time...not really any new content as the promised content was delayed again.
---
1 cruel master and some sort of slave creature bound by a summoning spell
---
My TS FFR auto grenade with maxed out demo makes low mobs easy. Soloing line in the sand is super easy with it but overall it’s not great to be fair.
---
Steam is saying 1.4 GB
---
Defence? 😂 ha who needs that when bethesda releases loads of home items and don't increase build budget.
---
Yeah you them randomly it a real grind and only for the T60 armour.
---
Its also a good hundred years before the events of f2 so frank being on the east coast or not is entirely irrelevant, the point is that the enclave has had secrest service in their ranks
---
Or maybe in the upcoming weeks, got pushed back 🤦‍♂️
---
My comment was sarcastic, apologies if that didn't carry through well.
---
It does matter, because there are still significant changes and improvements being made with this patch, and honestly each patch since Wastelanders has been many more steps forward than backwards. Yeah, an even that was hyped up and then falling through at the eleventh hour sucks, but coming from someone who doesn't keep up to date with every little thing in Fallout 76, I didn't even know there was a Colossal Problem coming, so it really doesn't matter to me. We get a community event with ATLAS, Meat Week is coming back, several dozen bugs (that maybe aren't a big deal to YOU) are being addressed, etc.
---
Yes, there are bugs out there that have been around and are annoying as hell. My laser gatling has at least 20 cores that are low charge because of the reload bug, so it's not like I'm unaffected by the enduring bugs. I'd like them to get fixed to, but I'm also aware that 76 is in a much better place in terms of stability and performance than it was a year ago, or even at the beginning of this year.
---
And as to "what are they doing?" I'd say a pretty good job, considering the flaming dumpster this game was a few months ago.
---
Love seeing that bug. Always laugh when they start running around.
---
Heh, I did that too!  She was like *‘why am I getting attacked by these Floaters!  I just killed them all!’*
---
We all know it’s more than likely something will appear in the next few days that’s stupidly convoluted to do and the duper’s will all claim it’s in the game so it fair. And Bethesda will do nothing about it once again. Expect it to emerge Friday lunchtime and be left all weekend
---
When I use a handmade, not always. It likes to reload at 11 sometimes.
---
Yeah. Nearly 9 gigs. That's gonna take a minute
---
You would still need to learn the plan before they are added in the drop pool for you.
---
Same. I no longer need it and like being able to carry more food and taking less fall damage. I survived a fall from the top of the monorail elevator yesterday. And I no longer kill myself 1/3rd of the time with my jetpack.
---
And we can't even sell them.
---
But then people that finish early are benefitting way more? There should be something after you finish but it also shouldn't be to amazing like Atoms.
---
That's so weird! Bethesda are usually so quick to fix bugs, too! Oh wait..
---
They only just now fixed the problem with the bungalow in the Down Home bundle, and that has been present since April. Seriously, don't hold your breath for this one.
---
They need to bring back the ordinance ranger armor from Vegas.
---
That’s one way to describe it...
---
I could see some of the factions using a variety of riot armor for sure. I think it was a missed opportunity in FO4 and 76 that they didn’t really implement a more east-coast inspired riot armor as opposed to the Wild West style from NV. Would go a long way with players I bet
---
Need help finding the door? No one is forcing you to stick around.
---
Just say “joe who?” Please...
---
Still no 
---
**LEGENDARY PERKS**
---
Did not see any mention of the Future Tech C.A.M.P skin bug....did I miss something or am I moving my camp for the 3rd time this week
---
Please scrap the card system, it's terrible, you were told it was terrible when it was announced, playing with it has borne that out.  It's terrible.  Scrap the system.
---
They should at least have one daily and one weekly that gives atoms.
---
I don’t own it but it annoys me when I go to players camps. Go to open it and then it shuts on me🤯
---
As long as 24 people are playing you would always see a full server. That isn’t an indication of whether it is popular or not.
---
Man, I have like 700 treasury notes
---
Yeah. But they probably delayed it for a reason, it needs fixing. I'd rather it be added in correctly than having it busted right out the bat.
---
That being said, why is it even in the patch notes? It's like, not technically in this patch. It's so stupid. 
---
The patch notes, to me, read along the lines of:  "A Colossus Problem" new event added! - This event is broken and will not be added for another 4 weeks.
---
They made it clear 3 weeks ago that this was mostly bug fixes with a little content added. 
---
Sorry every update can't be mind blowing, but we just got update 20 a month and some change ago.
---
This was never meant to be a content update, just major fixes and starting to add the next update groundwork.
---
I have that issue. It has a lot to do with my stash tho. I horde everything, especially ammo. Lags at the favorite wheel and cooking the most. 
---
I'm sure a new character wouldn't have these issues.
---
Where would you like me to start. 
---
SBQ still doesn't count towards challenge
---
SBQ still can't be crippled to order to force her to land 
---
Magic weapons still exist
---
Still no Ultralight mods for SS Armor 
---
No Bright Headlamps for any of the new PAs 
---
No Headlamps at all for Combat or Marine Helmet 
---
Tons of mods missing from weapons and armor 
---
Still no Diving suit shown a year ago 
---
No need for flux cause it serves basically no purpose
---
No mass crafting 
---
No point in nuking most areas thanks to nerfs 
---
Butcher's bounty still doesn't work on certain creatures 
---
No markers for Legendary enemies when they die
---
No sensitivity sliders or deadzones 
---
No option for FO4 D-pad for consoles 
---
The list goes on for quite awhile
---
But auto grenade launcher is the god tier weapon to use at Line in the Sand
---
That's the power of PS4 Pro, it's been choppy since Waste landers.
---
Holy shit you put alot of work into this thanks, i guess more work than bethesda QA ever did. Community QA Team does the work.
---
Honestly I’m not even mad that it’s delayed- I’d prefer a finished and non buggy final product over a rushed one- but I’m seriously annoyed with the lack of communication. I don’t understand why Bethesda flip flops between being open and communicative and then doing shit like this. There has been ZERO indication until today, the RELEASE OF THE PATCH, that Colossal Problem would be delayed further. All indications were that it would be going live TODAY. If that wasn’t the case, why would you let us believe it was until the literal last second?? I just don’t understand the logic behind this, surely they must realize by now that all doing things like that does is piss people off. All in all I’m fine with the event not being available I’m just frustrated with Bethesda’s continuing inability to properly communicate with their community.
---
Yup. They decided to not release content that still has bugs. Just like people have asked them. 
---
How very dare them.
---
Dear god, there is always one...... Anytime you post something, someone will be like " WeLL aCtUaLLy  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W\_FRPoJIrlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_FRPoJIrlI) "
---
Thank you for your life changing comment. Truly fascinating insights.
---
Haha that’s why I gave them the honorable mention
---
Mine does the same thing...as does my teammates.
---
Why do they say meat week returns if it isn’t for two weeks? Why do they mention colossal problem then say it’ll be activated “in the coming weeks?” That’s false advertisement, no?
---
I'm addressing the point that you're bad at the game.
---
You could trade for a good fixer for the same price the plan would be worth.
---
lol mine too when I saw the picture
---
Yes I know but as I said. THIS secret service squad isn't part of them and they will follow their duty which is to protect the gold. Remember the whole government wasn't in the enclave which means parts of the secret service were not part of it either.
---
Excuse me if this is covered and I missed it but I've experience this with both Charging Barrel Tesla Shotgun and Gauss Rifle. 
---
If you shoot and uncharged shot in VATs with these weapons, it will show correct damage numbers however do very very little damage, sometimes for example Gauss Rifle headshot will not do enough to kill a level 6 feral ghoul.
---
Honestly, if you feel that way and this is having an impact on your RL, with missed holiday time from work, vote with your wallet. Find a new game to play and another company to support.
---
I just had to make a new character and everything else just kind of fell into line as I progressed the early game story. It wasn’t too bad for me, just had to get the new character up to about level 20 or so and this completed all of the outstanding trophies for my FO76 game.
---
Yes happens at Surface to Air a lot
---
ha ha ha. Do you think they were going to fix just yours? 
---
Here's a work around. remove the door until they announce a fix.
---
From beta to wastelanders that's how it was for us. To have anything is great. I don't personally like too many things overlapping. This will give me a chance to enjoy what is going on instead of rushing through it all
---
I fully expect 90% of their photos to be pictures of themselves standing in their camp for the daily challenge.
---
Did you read the last response from Beth about Patch21? It is a small patch, mostly bugfixes (we will see about that...), nothing special. You made your hopes up, not Bethesda.
---
No because it is part of the current patch, if they were coming out next patch then yes it would be.
---
Oh for Pete's sake, lighten up.
---
Also, this is a good spot for one of the 'Atomics Fan' possum badge challenges.  Kill 20 enemies with the Fat Man.  OK I can do that.
---
A buddy of mine gave me a 3 star Stalker's missile launcher that only weighs 2 pounds. I keep it on my on the off chance I run across so missiles (we all know how often you run into them) and if I don't need to sneak I'll blast whatever I'm trying to kill because why  not. Otherwise,  no, I don't carry them.
---
Pretty much. The BOS event might be neat, we'll find out later. Other than that, it's back to SCORE, gold, and rep.
---
 **General:** Implemented an additional fix to address remaining edge cases where Daily and Weekly Challenges could complete themselves automatically. 
---
Looks like they may have finally fixed it.
---
You right! I just downvoted my own comment, my bad
---
I don't know why you or others are surprised at this point.   This is par for the course.  No use in complaining about it.
---
Its the speed not the size thats the problem i downloaded a 5gb update for another game in like just over 30 mins this morning but this update is downloading so slow.
---
Not all bugs are visible...
---
Releases it and its broken... gets hate
---
Waits to try and get it right... gets hate
---
If you're so great and developing a game show them how its done...
---
So basically no new content for players to do. Can't wait to give all my crap to the BOS and do meat week for the 5th time! 
---
At this point I'd be satisfied if they just released the legendary perks and tweaked them in live as things went on. Just so I could have something new to focus on.

X-cell is mostly useless because it only lasts for like a minute and if you accidentally get addicted to it it's got bad side effects. Overdrive is better, I use it from time to time. Berry Mentats will also stack if you take it first though I'm not sure if the int bonus gets overwritten by the other chem, but the pink glow definitely persists after you take other chems.
---
I know, I can sleep easy tonight knowing that major bug was fixed.
---
Ffs it's like the fixing of the light in watoga high all over again 😂
---
I genuinely don't think they play enough of their own game to understand the "intricacies" like this.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have insisted on all of these charging Gauss rewards in the first place, because they knew they would have needed to fix VATS.
---
Everyone being home due to COVID probably hasn't helped with communication either.
---
I mean man. To include something in a patch that’s possibly a month out is crazy to me. But I’m not BGS 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Can confirm, 50GB update baby.
---
Thank god I have 30MB/s so it isn't too bad, but I'm feeling for my dialup bros out there.
---
It used to happen to me a lot with the pistol when I could spam shots in vats. Since I've had to charge shots to get damage it happens less frequently.
---
Oh yes, I forgot. What people think they know means more than what they are told. How very dare me.
---
You think they are just gonna delay for fun? They gain nothing from the delay
---
Ahh, thanks for the information, much appreciated.  It would be nice if they could patch in something to retroactively address this :-/.
---
Well, I see I am getting downvoted. Sorry rich people who can afford FO1 st  on a monthly basis, sometimes policies come down to help out the little guy.
---
I have a legendary short rifle stuck in my inventory from a Beckett quest that I didnt finish in time. It's been that way for about 3 days now. I wouldn't mind it since its got nice effects but whenever I mod it, it resets entirely when i load the game up again.
---
Wouldn't it be meat weeks if it was for two weeks?
---
But there is a second meat week next month, you just have to earn it by giving all your scrap away.
---
Fat Man Launchers?
---
Me: Walks in to the nearest BoS member and sets keys on desk.
---
BoS: "What the hell are these for?"
---
Me: "The truck load of technical data I've been collecting for over a year now. You're going to want to work through it in shifts, bud."
---
Ah, a hunter's fat man, for hunting.
---
Did I miss something I thought only certain events like faschnaut or daily allie quest are the only ways besides the purveyor? Is it more events now
---
If you mean the white shirt with khaki pants there's three in the rooms at the back of the Whitespring spa.
---
I know they won't do this but id fucking love it
---
That’s a shame
---
Not complaining.. asking, but BGS shills have come to lick Todd’s boots
---
I don’t know what people were expecting. They were pretty clear what we should expect IMO
---
I mean, alt-f4 is the fastest way to quit the game. I've been doing that the entire time anyway. Why would anyone want extra steps?
---
I put in a bug report that the [Ranger coat's physics got borked by an update 9 months ago.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/429637549347307521/740212986702200912/unknown.png) They told me that they would let the team know about it. I'm still waiting Matt...
---
He’s probably is still trying to figure out how to flip burgers without breaking them.
---
it's not a bug it's a mechanic
---
Lmfao how much are they paying you dude? Seriously you got a contract on the low
---
I really don't care to see some random dudes picture collection they only took to complete the daily or scout challenges. I suspect the vast majority of players have used photos very little unless required. Now if there is an option to enable this, sure. More choices are always good.
---
I think it has less to do with it being delayed and more to do with the fact that we find out the day it’s supposed to come out that it’s delayed
---
I’d rather they delayed things that released it with problems.. I’d also imagine it’s also a lot more difficult working this stuff from home.
---
I think they’ve started to learn their lesson from the original launch
---
Unrelease the game then, it has pages of well documented bugs
---
Let's be honest here. MODUS + Vault dwellers will save the appalachia and then destroy the upcoming BoS posse...
---
meh
---
Ah, they just want to whine a bit. They have a sorrowful life. They salty tears are tasty.
---
Yes, let us bulk ammo and then sell it at the ammo vending machines for its own currency that we can then spend at the annoying vending machine. 
---
There is no need for this special machine and it’s terrible GUI
---
I also can't get sludge lung to pop no matter how many times i catch it even on new characters.
---
It's actually smart not to release it on the day that Legendary Run weeklies reset as that seems like it's just asking for problems.
---
I got a two shot with 90% reduced weight and mirv. It's so much fun
---
No... but all of the past inside the vault articles that mentioned the patch did
---
When should we expect it to be back online? I gotta do my daily chores and get that shit out of the way so I can relax.
---
Five hours later and still waiting ZZZzzzzz
---
At this point, I’d wait until it’s actually live before making that assumption lol
---
Shotguns are currently buggy with vats
---
"Memburs"
---
You want it NOOOOOOWWWWWWWW, Veruca.
---
Military Intel Officer Uniform. Came around once a few months after release for an insane amount of atoms and never came back.
---
*Throws wallet at TV.*
---
Okay Bethesda, go buy yourself something nice.
---
you have a legendary armor piece equipped with the effect "recieve 15% less damage whilest blocking" this is the only armor effect that for some reason causes this behaviour
---
it also happens with shotguns that have either instigating/junkies/stalkers/limb damage/33vats hit chance   
---
its a bug
---
Ah yes, because this was definitely a patch on the scale of wastelanders, legendary run, nuclear winter, or any other of the actual major patches. Where's all the advertising for this supposed major patch?
---
Looks like they ignored most of the logic just to complain about meat week/CP lol.
---
A lot of games put "stuff" in a patch weeks early - especially if there is not a patch planned right before said "sfuff". 
---
By them telling us WHEN it is, it is NOT false advertisement.
---
Edit: added comment to the wrong spot
---
Let’s see. People said they wanted a roadmap. 
---
Some people said yeah but if they miss things even by a few days people are going to be upset.
---
No we won’t! We promise! We understand it’s not set in stone. 
---
Bethesda. Ok well do roadmaps. And mind you, no dates are fixed. Got that no dates are fixed. Everything is subject to change. 
---
Ok yeah sure, we understand.
---
See this post for what actually happens when the roadmap changes.
---
We’re speculating how long this delay will be. The OP guaranteed 4 weeks with no real rhyme or reason. It could come out on Friday for all we know. 
---
Also, while being home for months on end, will another week without this event really kill us all?
---
Pitchforks, grab your pitchforks here ----E
---
When they realized they had to push Colossal Problem back, it may not have been a bad idea to have it swap places with Meat Week.
---
Though, it wouldn't be fair to those banking on Meat Week happening that particular week, I guess.
---
I don't know.  I'm just of the mindset that if you push something back, you should try to make it up with something else.
---
I'm a non build shotgun guy. I found a 33% chance with executioner, so i oneshot most creatures
---
Let's not forget they're a fascist dictatorship who see themselves as saviors and must protect the wasteland by keeping them uneducated.
---
Did you max out Raiders yet?  I would love to know your spot haha
---
yeah so shotguns are bugged, and can one-shot most creatures. that's why it's like that in vats and not outside of vats. Outside of vats, the damage numbers you see are the ones you should be getting.
---
it's a bug that's been around for quite some time and is *likely* not to be fixed anytime soon.
---
wasn't able to record, wish I could've. Thank goodness that the mods removed this, would be bad if a beth dev saw this post and fixed it{sarcasm\]
---
Not like Beckett orCommander Daguerre.  Raider punk and others just give daily fetch quests.
---
Is that a Minutemen grill?
---
That’s my biggest peave. Obsidian created most the PA aesthetics and Ranger armor and they became iconic to the game. Bethesda has some fun looking cosmetics, but they need to start making gear that people will actually be asking for over generations of fallout games. Not just one-off cosmetic items. 
---
They are great at marketing but they need to start making factions, items, anything that’s worth keeping long after F76 is gone.
---
No I want it to be released on they day they scheduled it months ago, or at least inform the community of the delay, idiot
---
bethesda bad, obsidian good
---
Enjoy it while it last. Shotguns are "bugged" in vats and can do ridiculous amounts of damage. More noticeable with some specific 2nd legendary stats.
---
Something had me thinking that because if I shoot a charred feral ghoul for example, with no vats it does barely any damage. Stick on vats and boom, one shot and it fly’s across the room!
---
roadmaps are mostly for the devs to know where to focus efforts on. the fact that they're making them public is for your benefit, and doesn't really help them at all.
---
&gt; Energy Weapons: Addressed an issue that could prevent energy weapons, like the Tesla Rifle and Flamer, from damaging enemies under certain circumstances.
---
Can it really be true? I want to believe but find it hard to. Is my quad auto tesla rifle really going to be usable for the first time since 2018?
---
Tried to do cmd-f for sniper/infinite range shotguns. I guess its combat shotguns modded into negative range gives the auto-95% in VATS? Not sure if all guns exhibit this if going into negative range.

So not today?
---
You got any of them 3* ones for sale?
---
And correct me if I'm wrong but I call bullshit that there isn't separate loot for everyone involved instead of first come first serve to the corpse.
---
Lol! That’s like a completely unrealistic suggestion that makes me have to carefully word how I really feel about stupid ideas.
---
No clue lmaooo I’m not donating junk man I’ll get back on when there’s an actual new event to do😂
---
If he had only killed 70% of those animals peta would be ok
---
And miss out on giving people a chance to complain? No thanks!
---
There was a post recently outlining a lot of bugs and shotguns were included. It seems the shotguns are OP in VATS and are possibly dealing the full shotgun damage with each individual pellet. Might as well enjoy while you can but I imagine it'll be fixed eventually.
---
Could have been some last minute testing that was being done over night.  I’ve had system releases at my job that have successfully made their way through the development environment, the testing environment, and then during our release weekend major bugs were found and they’ve had to pull back the code.  Entire days of employees paid to come in for the weekend lost because something that wasn’t caught during the last two tests.
---
If you seriously can't justify having them then you obviously don't care about the effects on them, so just get a weightless set.
---
Yes.
---
The guitar gets old but i like her voice lines. Better than some dirty old man asking me to pull his finger, some lady complaining about headaches and nightmares that i already fixed the cause of as well as basically confessing her love of me when i never once chose the romance responses, or that eyesore of a bar. Punks OK but not really my type of person.
---
Yeah it'd probably need to be an option, especially now with the public teams. 
---
I'd be very curios though about the actual usage percentage of photo mode - everyone I know in RL who is playing absolutely loves it, but those might be outliers.
---
Synths don’t exist in the timeline yet smh.
---
I got one off a vender a long time ago. It's tradable. I wonder if it's worth anything. It's the one with shoulder pads
---
I have 300 treasury notes because I (almost) always forget to exchange them daily.
---
I've played the game 100% solo since launch, not much you can't do, even in teams you don't need nor are expected to voice chat, so have at it... :-)
---
It’d be nice if Bethesda addressed a lot of things. At least they’ve instructed Ward to stay put in his trailer....
---
Not to forget the classic bobby pins weighing a lb each which nobody realised until like a week in
---
I miss my weightless double shot mirv. Found it at faschnacht and traded it for a good rifle. I miss you general mcarthur
---
Todd Howard is innocent
---
Why do introverts spend so much time telling everyone in public forums about being an introvert.
---
It's funny how they phrased this like a teacher admonishing a student.  Even Bethesda is fed up with Ward. 🤣
---
Then go play those. The patches here are hardly "minimal", they just haven't fixed everything on people's long list of bugs/demands.
---
I'm not even going to try and compare the F2P/P2W method against FO76, that's been hashed out a thousand times on this sub and is a pointless.
---
Got super lucky and got mine from a guy on here for 5k. Then next event got one to drop. Going to sell it to someone for same on Xbox or just use on alt account
---
Suprisingly not. They even added Secret service armor and gauss weapons to the legendary pool from enemies with the latest patch, (you only get them if you have the plans for them)
---
I like the Raider one and the fasnacht one. the fasnacht sings f-ed up songs if you dialogue with it. I just wish there was a volume slider.
---
They are pretty much divided tho, I only find servers with central Europeans for example.
---
This so much this. 150 script a day? I dont know who that this was a good idea to only let us roll 1 3 star weapon per day.
---
You probably have a piece of armor with braced (less damage while blocking) which turn your shotgun into a magic one in vats.
---
Remove that and you won't oneshot anything, if that's what you enjoy. 😊
---
They said this in the patchnotes itself. But you are unable to undertsand it, crybaby cretin.
---
There was a commercial?
---
yes, HOWEVER, i recommend being open to public groups for things like events
---
Shotguns are bugged in VATS. Either by prefix/major or if one of your armor pieces has the 15% reduced damage while blocking attribute. They'll one shot most everything
---
Drop m my way! I use 40mm.. u on ps4?
---
I always roam by myself. No friends on PS4. I find it enjoyable as I have the other fallouts. I just like the atmosphere of free roaming in the wasteland. 
---
I miss companions that follow you around.. that was fun. Piper come back! C'mon dogmeat let's go.
---
Good, magic weapons make up most op builds
---
Played solo until teams came out recently, always in a team now ... feels the same as solo
---
I think that I’ve played with a group only a handful of times. Hell, I played with groups during the BETA and then found some guy and his wife that I played with maybe once or twice. The game is still fun, regardless if you’re with a team or not.
---
Question: Orange CAMP skin?
---
NOW, NOW, NOW!
---
Blockcraft or whatever it is the kids are playing these days.

This.
---
Yuss
---
This should always be held as honestly good advice to adhere too! Even if it turns into a meat pile if it flops the plane you're basically SOL on that front. Easy way to see it in true view is in Uranium Fever where killing the legendary inside the tunnel as soon as it pops can cause the meet pile to show up below the actual plane, making it impossible to grab. 
---
I had 3 x 3 star legendaries yesterday clip below and never pop up as meat pile. Not upset as they were low level and needed the 3 stars for daily but still annoyed by it.
---
"This game is still enjoyable played alone?" Yes. You don't have to group with anyone unless you want to. And if you do, you don't have to communicate in any way. Like the new grouping thing, nobody expects you to actually play together. People just group up for buffs and benefits, but run around alone.
---
"Can I treat/play this game in a manner similar to a one-player game?" Yes, but there are events that you want to do that has other people in them.
---
Awwwww, did I talk bad about daddy Todd? Sorry dude the boots all yours! Get to lickin👍🏽
---
👀
---
I mean, you have a point.
---
Sorry to say this but it's up to the fallout 1st community the non fallout first community cant afford to donate im scrambling all the scrap i can get to keep for myself I cant afford to donate my junk
---
I actually do have a few SS+S pitchforks lol I got a bloodied, a Vampire's, Junkie's... Just some useful ones
---
Oh man... people on the internet being mean.... my life’s over seriously I can’t take all the anonymous people typing 😔 if only they’d do something in person LMAO
---
That might be affected by some of the other bugs, but I will try to look into it. I should probably try the charging barrel tesla more in general since I remember some very funky bugs with it in the game's early days
---
That's an exception. It requires "devs" with more experience than just 2 hours of tinkering with 'TESIII Construction Set' on a potato pc, and they won't have the money to hire new temps until the ~~suckers~~ victims who had auto-completed SCORE challenges inevitably buy a bunch of Atoms for rank ups.
---
Well, my best guess is that they wanted all those FO1st renewals until the very last second. I bet many would have waited for the next "couple of weeks" to get or renew it. But yes -  better a "smooth" running new event later than an awful laggy one now.
---
Guess I’ll test when I’m home later.  I don’t really believe any bug fix unless I see it myself.  Lol.
---
Bone Totems and Non-Concrete Tire Walls!
---
5-10... that's cute! I once went about 150 TD turned in before getting the next paint plan. Then 3 TD latter I got the next one. RNG is gonna RNG but damn son, 10? :)
---
That's not a very nice thing to call Pete Hines.
---
I got a junkies 2525 yesterday I'm not happy about it.
---
It absolutely is.  That's the way I've exclusively played until lately.
---
Once you get the hang of things, try out some public events (big hexagon with exclamation point on the map).  They are a lot of fun.
---
Finally, someone with the guys to help
---
Nope it does it to me too and I just don’t go through it anymore.
---
That's fair enough, I just did it because I want this character to be very BoS and kinda need BoS power armour paint to do that for them aha.
---
Robin brotherHood with Scribe Tuck?
---
I'm generally a solo player as well, and often hate being forced to do events/missions in groups in other games.  First off, I started playing FO76 back during the B.E.T.A. and for a month or two afterwards, but the lack of NPCs, bugs, QOL issues, annoying PVP griefers, and constant server crashes killed me.  I've played all of the FO games going back to FO1 20 or so years ago, and the lonely, solo me-against-the-world aspect of this universe was always one of the main things I loved about it.  
---
I came back about a month ago and have enjoyed it a LOT more.  I think because the game has been sort of a persona non grata in the MMO gaming community, the vast majority of the jerks have left, and 99.9% of the folks who remain are either super-helpful contributors or, at minimum, are content to wave hello and leave you to your business as they go about yours. 
---
The Wastelanders update has made the game feel a LOT more like FO4 did, and although not a lot of the new NPCs are what I'd call super well written, the world no longer feels almost entirely bereft of humanity.  As someone who played 'vanilla' FO76 and the new, mostly improved version, its definitely a game you can sink your teeth into again without constant irritation.
---
Now, if they'd only fix some of the bugs and incorporate a few more QOL improvements the folks on this sub have been screaming about, we'd really be in business.
---
Wow i can't wait to tell all my friends.
---
The poodle skirt, hands down. I've been waiting since ages ago.
---
I even post one comment about it in every AS thread... lol
---
Yeah, but they're all Nocturnal
---
Same boat. If the legendary run didn't have the double XP and double point rewards, I'm sure I'd be only in the first 1/3 of the map ....fucking zorbo has a self propelled ship! I bet hes a member of the brother of steel too! Doesn't do shit and lazy as fuck :/
---
And yeah that was part humor and part sarcastic rant of humor!
---
Yeah, I wrote it that they warned us about this will be a small, bugfixing patch. You deny this, and in the world of the internet you can find it less then 1 second... but you still deny it.
---
But allright, please, continue being a liar. This will be fun.
---
The only things I look forward to with patches are to see what they break trying to fix things, what things they "fix" that were never really an issue, and what things have been broken for months and months that they still haven't fixed.
---
I do believe it's instigating explosive, conveniently. I can just craft a normal one to see if that changes anything
---
Someone get this guy a cookie.
---
pretty sure this is kinkshaming 😂
---
Wait what? Lol why not? It's great for trade. /S
---
Wow, I actually blocked that megasloth in cranberry bog one out! Another one I can't stand is the weekly critical hits 🤢
---
I don't mind killing legendaries for a weekly but when it's something they want you to do every/every other day it starts to make me not want to log on every day... but dammit I want that chicken coop and new backpack!!
---
If anyone from Bethesda sees this, i have a question about Fortifying Atlas: will the rewards from the "Atlas donor provisions" be similar to the Mole Miner Pails or Presents?
---
Good advice, also if you time your throws early. Molotovs continue to burn for a few seconds and have area of effect. Perk card extends it.
---
Just click buy and it'll tell you the full name of the item before you actually click ok to actually go through with the transaction
---
lucky! i’m still downloading right now i’m at 12/49gb so i really don’t know what’s up, i’m about 2mb/s on a good day too
---
When you take over a workshop, it tells you people can contest it. Bethesda has done pretty much everything they can to shelter people who don't want to engage in pvp. 
---
It's your fault you got killed, not Bethesda's.
---
This was apparently fixed, if you're asking about what I think you're asking about (health regeneration as a result of Speed Demon, as confirmed by Angry Turtle).
---
The reduced damage while blocking is the only thing I can think it would be. The effect on the gun itself is not one of the bugged effects and as far as I know there is only the one bugged armor effect. This would also mean that you could pick up a normal combat shotgun or pump and they would do thr same damage as your double barrel. You can still have the damage without the low ammo count. Im surprised this wasn't fixed with update 21.
---
&gt; fail/complete while you're dead because if it does you are screwed on a number of levels a
---
To wait 10 minutes though. It may not be a lot while gaming, but try *waiting* for 10
---
What will be fun? Are you going to do anything Mr. tough guy?😂😂😂😂😂😂 you fucking shills are something else “This will be fun.” HAHAHAHA like you fucking kids will/can do anything to watch for
---
Sure. You still need to hit the basics though and not everyone will hit those item rolls. I've had my fair share of good rolls but by no means do I rely on them. It's the little things like selling thousands of ammo I know people use for 1 cap each, stims for 12, power cores for 45, fusion cores for 15 each and at this point nearly every single serum in the game at 375 that makes me the vast lions share of my caps. Huge sales sometimes backfire too when you just leave them up in your vendor.
---
At present if I went afk and some bigger buyers showed up, as happens, I've got around 75k worth of stuff potentially up for sale. Tons of junkie weapons, unyielding armors, a few bloodied even and thanks to some random guy I'm sitting on 1400 fuzzy tokens to sell that stuff too. The 30k cap is indeed too low at times and I'd say I've seen probably 45k worth of sales happen when I was capped at 30k and frantically trying to fast travel but the bug prevented me. I'd rather have a ton of little sales than a single item sell for 20k when I'm already sitting at 20k caps, ya know?
---
Mine too! Since wastelanders man! Try power armour, flamer and dual bar mod. Im melting everything.. dont tell too many people or theyll nerf it..
---
Srsly?
---
All most any other gun would be a great trade, but come on a Fatman?

---
I maxed it out with all my acquired atoms from 1st. Now hold on put your pitchforks down.. I don't have much time to play with three kids a pending divorce and seven day work weeks so I take shortcuts when needed
---
I kinda agree, I feel that 10 is too low for the expansions they are working on, but 50 is probably to high. To be fair I'm also including the sound dev team, the OV people and the art people as well in that 50 number.
---
The 100 was a bugged fire rate like the gatling gun or bows, in reality it shoots much slower. I did see some reports that wastelanders nerfed the overall fire rate, but in my experience it's not very significant. I've been using a two shot AGL for many months before wastelanders and it doesn't feel significantly different from what it was before. Just for clarification, a fire rate of 100 would be 10 shots per second, faster than an automatic laser rifle
---
Yeh I understand from that perspective that everyone might end up over geared but I think a balance pass to all prefixes would benefit the game. At the moment people only want bloodied and Imo it's boring for trading /selling. If there was more diverse and usable loot then build variety would increase along with a better in game player economy.
---
Either way youre right, the game is too easy anyway. so maybe next time I'll hang onto that golf club 😉
---
I think if you threw the Communist Arms and legs on it it would look way better.
---
I know. Even those are let downs
---
Burn the witch!  Burn the witch!
---
Yeah, pretty sure it's a bug for everyone.
---
Is it annoying and immersion breaking.

I recommend removing the door for now.

I’m convinced the atom shop stuff, at least, is done by interns
---
I prefer to just reset the electrical breaker to my house

When it's done and not before.
---
Did this very same thing with a two shot MIRV from as high as I could go with jet pack. Basically a handheld carpet bomb. Was glorious
---
I have lag and loading problems on the xbox one x as well. The game is a mess no matter which system you play it on.
---
Why is there even a legendary pipe pistol, seriously
---
i work in shifts and have no friends using the same system. so, i always play games alone and it works absolutly perfect for fo76. you'll meet some random strangers from time to time, perhaps interact or just pass by. there is no negative impact at all, everything can be soloed without issues, the game isnt hard at all (if you invest some time to think about your build and read/watch some tutorials). if you liked fallout before, you'll like 76 also, just see it as some kind of fallout fourandahalf.  
---
also, even if playing solo, join the public teams. they give great bonusses and no one expects something from you, just enjoy the boosts (and free fast travels) like everyone else.
---
Soon™
---
same here, except for that damned backpack..... i'm never gonna get it.

Yeah

Happened twice after leading Bessy back home and once after killing the imposter.

---
Sorry this is just just a bad response.
---
The reason survival failed is because PVP is broken,
---
Bethesda and the player base essentially agrees with me. That's why a lot of people didn't play survival, it wasn't just because it was a beta, it was because assholes exist with OP duped armor.
---
Even if you kill them at the workshop they just keep coming back and are super overpowered. Not fun. Not interested. Workshops suck for this reason alone.
---
See, THATS why I come here. Thanks!

I have a feeling these type of community events are fixed, the bar will slowly rise over time and we'll complete the goals no matter how many mats ppl donate. Just a theory.

Interesting, I have seen mention of negative range shotguns once or twice but not anything particularly conclusive. I'll look into it
---
Not exactly a simple ask when dealing with RNG. I think personally I've had 3 weightless rolls out of 150 or so attempts.
---
I love when people sell mini nukes in the vending machine. I don't think I would take them for free
---
Yeah its a lot of pressure for a daily - getting 5 or something in a week and having 7 days to get enough to do the pool amount is much more manageable. 
---
As a sniper build i don't mind the critical hits but it definitely doesn't favour heavy builds or anyone not using VATS. That being said when yuou do find a sheepquatch or join  a queen fight - getting in the crits is quick and easy at least.
---
how long have "magic" weapons been in game? i'm a newer player, and having learned of their existence and seeing them used in game, is pretty disappointing.
---
Same here. I read about the Wastelanders update and watched a few videos on YT. Took a chance and yes it's really good. The levelling system keeps you involved for much longer than FO4.
---
I've always wondered this. It can't be very many people. I've always felt 76 was to be fast and cheap and used to fund other things. Making 76 a customer focused quality product never has been and never will be what the game was created to be.
---
Yes. Because all deadlines are guesses.
---
Which means the person in charge of sharing the deadlines with the fans has to guess. And they're not able to guess accurately, because much like real world weather systems, the game engine is stupidly complex, so any prediction made is as much hopeful fantasy as grounded reality. And yet, people still bitch when the weatherperson is wrong... and whenever Bethesda misses a deadline.
---
Just go to an event and revive a downed player, that counts towards the scout badge :-)
---
Literally only twice has anyone in a public team spoken to me.
---
Way too long
---
I mean they exist in the lore and it's safer to use them than create another faction that inevitably leads to, "where are they now, Bethesda? Lazy writing much, hmmmmMMMMMM?"
---
Best news today was seeing that you can get this stuff. Like you I got awesome stuff from faschnat. I already have my 3 star unyielding armor but I would love for weapon weight reduction prefix on them. And I got the beautiful purveyor to give me a 3 star bloodied fixer two weeks ago. But I would love for a explosive or better prefixes like the 2525 everyone wants
---
Bow cannot be used in power armor. 
---
Quad crossbow has a bottomless clip.
---
Black powder rifle bayonet mod can be learned by putting the mod on the gun and then removing it.
---
Edit thought of a few others:
---
Fat man does not work in VATS. 
---
Two shot missile launcher with targeting computer only shoots a single projectile.
---
Lol I found out by accident when I just decided to take a chance on an item who's name was too long to fit on the trade screen.
---
Do you play Xbox? 
---
If so, I can grenade myself in water for you. Kill two birds.
---
Ceiling fan!!!!
---
Maybe if you could vote inappropriate photos out of the mix, without getting anyone in trouble for various violations. for example xbl community standards ect. Cool idea though, I just don't want to see some of the things I would see people doing with frozen corpses... or maybe I do.
---
They added the code for the event to the game, but it will not be activated until a future update, I think they said "in the coming weeks"
---
**Edit** From the patch notes:
---
&gt;A Colossal Problem
---
&gt;Please note: Today’s update brings the new Public Event “A Colossal Problem” to the game. However, we are still making some performance tweaks and doing additional testing before we enable the event. We are planning to make “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the next couple of weeks.
---
Instead his cap float just sits there, taunting you
---
I mean, maybe we have dueling definitions of the "magic effect" here.
---
There's magic, as Angry Turtle tends to talk about it, which involves certain prefixes and Legendary effects colluding in such a way to make damage ridiculous, and which causes VATS to deal the full damage per pellet.
---
But there's also a VATS quirk with shotguns, probably related to this, that allows you to direct every single pellet into an enemy from the other side of V9 with pinpoint accuracy.
---
Maybe that doesn't fall under your definition of "magic," but I would consider it pretty darn magical.
---
Hell yeah ide buy this shit quick!
---
You get that much atoms a month? Might be worth a couple months
---
My internet is down so fuck me. Who at Bethesda do I contact about that?
---
My only problem with vats is how it automatically exits if an enemy runs behind cover or is too far away, i keep accidentally opening my pip boy trying to exit vats in the middle of combat
---
All according to plan
---
I get just as many tags using flame arrows or molotovs.
---
Thosw bastards weigh way too much haha and I pick up WAY too many at Line in the Sand
---
I like the BoS a lot and personally don’t mind their reappearance as i find their slightly differing philosophies with each game a cool. It kinda helps ground each game in the same universe and lets us know how the time and place we’re in the game compares to the last based on their size, influence, priorities, etc.
---
BUT they can’t be an end all for creative design. The institute got close but just fell short and ultimately I think it’s pretty well decided that canonically they will not be a long-term superpower. NCR rangers made such an impact in new Vegas despite being such a recent addition to the lore, they still control fallout fans. People are buying 1st membership just to have that cosmetic. And that isn’t even the entire NCR, just a special ops group apart of their faction. 
---
They need to sit down and get someone who isn’t just scrapping together items and calling it “cool.” They need to look at factions that really corner the market on some aesthetic/idea. Even Caesar’s Legion was totally badass even though we will most likely never see them again. The raiders and settlers are enjoyable enough, but they took a very generic concept and fleshed it out with a few interesting characters and quests. The NCR, BoS, children of atom, Caesar’s legion, etc were interesting from the start.
---
For the double barrel shotgun, I believe that the default stock actually weighs less than all the pistol grip variants, which makes no sense.
---
And yes the bolt action glitch with unscoping between shots is SO. GOD. DAMN. ANNOYING.
---
I'm not sure if it was Free Staters or Raiders at the time but  i tend to lean torward both groups responsible for not only the massacre of the innocent vault residents of Vault 94 but then they shot up the damn G.E.C.K that caused not only more radiation to the area but then transformed the mire into the hell it is today.     imo not a single group doesn't have blood on their hands.
---
Amen!!! I called mine Brrrr Brrrrr since i have it at around lvl 20 when i found it in the wayward mission up north. found the mods shortly after by pure luck and was able to get that sweet loot from sbq from around that lvl.. also melting high lvl players that shot me first to nag me felt so fucking good!
---
Feels good to be a chainsaw raider boi
---
no I'm saying does my character can cross platform
---
Nice camp. Be a shame if something... irradiated it. Not saying it'll happen... but it might. Just saying.
---
I disagree.
---
Even if they aren't accurate, having a broad idea of what's coming down the line is still a useful thing to have.
---
I think what needs to stop is their habit of delaying things *on the day that thing was supposed to come out*.
---
Leader of the Pack up by the Tyler County Fairgrounds.
---
i use a legendary weightless set already, add in the ultra light mods on it like you can with the other armours and you can get it weighing nothing or close to nothing, so when in power armour im not getting its benefits but neither is it weighing me down
---
I maxed raider like a week after wl dropped haha. Spent like 40 hours at ohio River adventure. Server hoping and doing the defend event
---
Every month "this is taking too long". We know.
---
They have to find things to break, give them time. Let's take bets on what's broken today!
---
Interesting, Vote Trump tho
---
so I just have to start a new character
---
I work for a major ISP installing and repairing internet services and I can confirm this. Most ISPs will refresh your IP whenever your modem/gateway is reset unless you have specifically purchased a static IP. Occasionally you may need to repeat the reboot process a time or two but that's about it.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Lol classic
---
Interesting note on the Trail Fireworks Mine reload speed glitch. I kept looking through my effects to see if it was from a lunchbox since it always happens at events. It's because I throw fireworks at events!
---
I named mine surgical precision
---
I didn't say to not let things stack, just limit how much you can stack individuals effects so you are not overpowered and out of reach for non-pvp players.
---
They should just make it a trade menu like scrip. 10mm is worth 20 points per 18 bullets or whatever, etc., easy.
---
Oof, imagine voting for either of those dipshits.. i was just using joe Biden as a punchline not an endorsement or anything.
---
Yeah now I try to loot as many corpses in between rounds. Self-sustaining ammo source!
---
They even have the skin from FO4 already for this
---
It still sounds cumbersome to me. I guess we shall see. I would like to be able to see available ammo.
---
STILL no VATS fix... not a single one...
---
If they just upped the daily scrip turn in per day it wouldn't be such a big deal for rng.
---
Stimulate the economy and let players stay logged in longer.
---
My guess is a small team and you divide that into animators, modelers, programmers, etc. and then split those into current and future content teams and you have your answer. One thing I'm not seeing mentioned in the comments is that given the state of the world theyre all working from home right now which hampers the ability of teams to work together more effectively. I know my team is doing alright with wfh but things would be a lot easier if we could be in the same room.
---
Mwhahahahahaha!!!!
---
When claiming Hemlock Holes Maintenance, it's worth keeping a look-out for the Grafton Monster that'll spawn somewhere in the dried lakebed as well as the two snallygasters that spawn by the downed vertibird directly across from the actual Hemlock Holes building as they all drop waste acid when killed. :)
---
Oh, no they aren’t cross platform.
---
COOKIES ALL AROUND
---
i hate that one cant sell that things
---
1) hanging atom bomb and mushroom cloud decorations
---
2) Mr Fuzzy ride
---
3) A different loot bag then that tombstone

Wendigo Earl....?
---
Defending a strong point, harvesting things, protecting NPC(s).  There's a boss fight in the mix - the Scorchbeast Queen.  Nominally a mutated bat but right, she's a dragon.  :-)
---
I am gonna nuke BOS base at least once :D
---
Expecting anything different at this point is beyond foolish given their track record.
---
This sub: "Wtf why is every update so buggy? Bethesda doesn't test shit!"
---
Also this sub: "Wtf why won't they release collosal problem already? Bethesda is taking too long to test this shit just release it whether it's ready or not!"
---
How hard is it to just do something else for a little while?
---
At a certain point you run out of things to spend them on and they start to pile up.
---
You stop using hard bargin. You stop taking grape mentats. Hell, you stop selling stuff and just drop it.
---
Then there's another wall when you stop needing decent gear. Your shopping list shrinks down to very specific items. Best of the best.
---
At that point caps start being worth less because the best of the best gear isn't available for caps.
---
I remember back in Fallout 4 different legendary creatures had different visual effect colors and they would starting glowing after they mutated. I really miss that, now in 76 the Legendary creatures glow lime green when they first appear and that’s it.
---
(One doesn’t know true fear till you see a mirelurk burning red running towards you glowing like a super sayin.)
---
I read somewhere that you have to contract a 2nd disease to get it to register. Worked for me.
---
WOOHOO !
---
Sounds dumb but ok
---
the problem is, that the two shot effect adds 20% to the base damage of the weapon and then divides the 120% by two
---
the explosive effect wich also adds 20% of the base damage is also split in two halfs and dealt as extra hits
---
so in actuallity you get two hits that have 60% of the base damage of the weapon plus two hits that have like 12% of the damage
---
each four of these hits has to penetrate armor individually and therefore suffers way more from the armor and explosive resistance of the target than a single shot would if it had all this damage combined making TSE weapons far less effective than it initially seems
---
they still have there use and are solid but they are far from great
---
as a sidenote im not sure on the exact numbers here, i very well be off by a few percent here and there
---
The Inspector costume (with top hat) is perfect. I regularly conduct the parade.
---
A Colossal Headache
---
Jangles the Moon Monkey is probably the only worker
---
I think as long as any amount of money is being made on the game, they will continue to focus solely on not fixing content and instead just slap a bandage on it and say it's good enough.
---
So sell them or drop them on the ground.
---
Lets add: he spends his time with a game that he hates so much. This is more than weird... it is so sad.
---
Use a weaker weapon.  There I solved your problem!  You're welcome, friend!
---
900 hours here. I play 80% alone. It’s definitely enjoyable alone. It’s a massive world, so most of the time you won’t see anyone outside of events.
---
I just don’t think the system as is isn’t very immersive. 
---
I know everything can’t be. But the current system really sticks out.
---
I keep forgetting my BEFR 50 cal which is on my favorites wheel
---
I really couldn't tell you how it works.  It might be something Angry Turtle talked about in a past video.
---
I think it's related to some combination of Legendary effects, but apparently, it's not the same combination that gives rise to magic weapons, I guess.  I just know that both my Bloodied Combat Shotgun and my Bloodied Gauss Shotgun exhibit this behavior.  I don't recall, off-hand, what their secondary/tertiary effects are.
---
That's the colossus' name when the colossal problem releases. Earl williams
---
The wendigo colossas in the event is called Earl.
---
I pre-ordered this game and didn't even have a level 50 chracter until like 2 weeks ago. So as someone who literally has no playtime between first release fo76 and current fo76 I have to say the game is so much better now and I actuallt really enjoy it
---
4.6gb on Beth launcher.
---
Really unhappy that you have yet again removed even more build mode mechanics. Who cares if you can make a wall or foundation float. It made the game interesting. I’ve built many ufos/ spaceships/ Rubik’s cubes etc. out off all the issues that are LITERALLY game breaking you were worried about fixing walls in camps that had no negative impact to this game. What about fixing ACTUAL issues like:
---
Scorchbeast queen event that respawns you in nuke zone, no crippling queen etc. 
---
fast travel bug 
---
Unable to respawn on death during events
---
Magazine loading random amounts of ammo or guns switching on their own. 
---
Magazine reloading before empty. 
---
Trade glitches
---
Nuclear winter exploits
---
HORRIBLE legendary RNG and drop rates. 99% of 3 star legendaries do not award 3 star items
---
Games dashbording on XB1 and failing to restart. 
---
Atom shop items not working properly. Nuka cola lamps not projecting. Red rocket garage door issues etc. 
---
A long list of vats issues to include entire magazines of ammo not doing any damage whatsoever. 
---
The list goes on and on. 
---
None of these get addressed but let’s make sure we take things away that give you enjoyment. Focus on the problems bethesda and leave fun mechanics alone.
---
You can’t sell them and you can’t just drop them without confirming they will be destroyed.
---
I will take all those 40mm
---
Capitol Waitland
---
Oh damn, they sound really fun. Thank you!!
---
See? You are just here to be toxic. A few players who are butthurt on reddit about the truth doesn't represent the community.
---
Survival mode being canceled due to people not wanting to play it is my proof.
---
Edit: Also the 17% upvoted thing has nothing to do with my survival mode point, since i didn't mention it in the OP. That is not a good response either way.
---
I am so sick of Ward
---
"finally someone with the guts to help"
---
You used to be a raider, you alcoholic wimp.
---
Jesus, yes please. I am planning on clinging to all of my atoms from here as we approach the season. By any chance, remember how much it costs?
---
I'll buy your fusion cores
---
Start a new character?
---
Play a new game? 
---
Use something silly like a rolling pin and pipe revolver only?
---
YEET!
---
No I mean the .50 cal receivers. Only the basic one gives a damage boost, the others don't do anything iirc
---
The Wandering Settler has given me a couple of quests.  Gotta interact with them to get the quest, I think.
---
Thanks pal, I'm gonna quote every motherfucker now.
---
This game is most likely transitioning into "maintenance mode" from the low numbers after Wastelanders. My guess would be a small team of 15-25. It's why our patches are being delayed, and so on. They were most likely anticipating a medium sized (40k+ active) playerbase but it flopped so they're starting to shift their devs to other projects.
---
Because Bethesda
---
I suspect that it's somehow related to whatever they did to stop a duping exploit a while ago.
---
I saw the exact same camp about 3-6 days ago,my reaction was priceless
---
Let’s go thanks for sharing
---
That's awfully condescending of you to say, I have in fact killed the queen more than often enough to back up the statement.
---
And I know the problem of dying right after the fight when running bloodied due to random mobs jumping you but as I said I have not encountered anyone that would actually be enough of a dick to loot the bag, that's why was saying it might be because you are behaving like a dick yourself if you kill it before some people get to actually hit it.
---
May I ask what platform you are playing on?
---
There is such a thing as “game over”.
---
Ok, that’s good to hear and thank you for answering. I just found it odd that we got one but not the others.
---
Lead pipe, pool cue, pick for my weekend...all 1\*.
---
Rather than scrip them now I just add them to the wall of shame in my camp...loaded with my legendary shovels and other marvels of suck. I have two instigating shovels and a junkies already up (I had already disposed of the other 4 I had before those), plus a pick and a pitchfork.
---
Drop as in use them.
---
Yeah I get that, I'm just thinking about a lot of these newer players, especially the ones that joined when gamepass got Fo76. They find these plans all day for cheap on vendors and in my mind it just seems like it takes away from some of the already dwindling reasons to fight the sbq. She might have been the first mega boss but, I still hope the upcoming content doesn't make encounters with her pretty well disappear because people don't find use for the fight.
---
I'm proud to say, even on my level 30 alt I fight front and center during the sbq. Lol
---
I'm pretty sure I threw off some players the other day because I was up in her face and reviving players 5-8 times my alts level.
---
But yeah, there are a lot of new players hiding behind the heavy hitters, I see it a lot when playing in my main. I've got a magic minigun, and play bloodied in PA, but I tank the queen for as long as I can keep agro. Until an unarmed bloodied pulls agro that is. I'm happy to be able to shield the lower levels, and I'll be happier to see them return as higher levels and do the same for new low levels. We will see what happens when the new boss fight drops, hopefully there is a healthy mix of both going on.
---
Ah damn I only have a few hours a day to do my dailies for the legendary run, guess I'll miss out :(
---
Nope. If you rushed it, that's on you.
---
Maybe look into the "Balancing of the Wasteland" update we will be getting.
---
If you're on PS4, I'd be happy to give you a bajillion camp plans if you feel like building something new on a different character.   
---
This doesn't help with exact placement but I do periodically build complex structures in workshops and blueprint them and then use parts of them in a CAMP later.   
---
In Fallout 4 I liked building with the regular walls and foundations, but in this game I typically have more fun building around in-game content. If you avoid using foundations you have a lot more budget space available for fun decorations. I'm fond of using cabins, monorail cars, empty houses, empty train cars, etc.
---
I mean, is this the first patch maintenance you’ve wanted to play through, this isn’t anything new from any of the other numbered patches?
---
Theyve literally JUST added the collosus event.
---
I can tell you as an introvert, I was super bummed when fallout 76 was not going to be in the vein of 3 &amp; 4. However as a fallout 1st subscriber I have the choice to play on a private server alone. Funny thing is even though I consider myself quite the introvert there’s something that keeps me logging into the public servers. I don’t know what it is. Even though I generally play solo I enjoy seeing other players on the map and occasionally bumping into them. I rarely interact other than an emote or two but something about just knowing others are around me feels enjoyable.
---
The Sub Commander outfit from F4 is still in the base files. And they have moved things from ATX over to Base game before. For example the Old Man Winter Helmet.
---
There is [this outfit](https://imgur.com/a/JAk2VGH) (seen in game on some characters in the Deep) and one other one i don't have pictures of. The outfits don't have Store Front images so they could not be ready yet or they could be planning to use them somewhere else.
---
This. I have a "Free for Low Levels" vendor (than you, Slocum Joe robot, you make a great distinction between the free section and the paid stuff), and I keep having level 100+ aholes simply gobbling up any ammo and stims I have in there. Got to the point I purposefully limit how much of each item I put up for sale, and just replenish after each visit.
---
Meanwhile, my good weapons are selling a lot more often now, what with more players visiting to have a look. I had to take some down for the first time to avoid the cap cap.
---
I always wished that you could do more than just one group of credits every time so it wasn't so cumbersome. I'm glad they added that!
---
I was recently dropped a Bloodied 3\* Auto Grenade Launcher and its not worth the trouble of carrying around.  If anyone on XBox wants it for its value look me up after 5pm est.
---
Gamer:  Send Me 4 I Am
---
Yea I’m farming the LotP but I have an explosive vampire pump shotgun so the wolves don’t really do much damage
---
I think there still trying to figure out how to make them grindy-er than hell, without making them grindyer than hell.
---
That bunker, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
Well, yeah, those I can understand as you’ve already purchased the plans. But doing this serves no purpose other than making the floater grenade plans irrelevant, and therefore easing the grind very slightly.
---
I'd like Ohio to get in there somewhere, the invention of air planes in Dayton would be a great way to include some history in the games. We've got corn mazes out the ass so those would be fun with some ghouls populating them. All the museums would be great. The libraries, the amusement parks, it would be like FO4 &amp; 76 combined. But a guy can dream.
---
Would you want to slog your ass off fixing/making a game for 8-12 hours a day then go home and play that game for more hours, after it just most probably pissed you off for the last 8-12 hours....
---
I like playing the season, but I don't like it taking up all of my play time.
---
And for atom dailies, they need to fix them. I've discovered everything on the map, but at least 3 zones won't complete and give me the reward.
---
Thank you SO much for explaining that!  Makes perfect sense now.  
---
I thought it would be spitting out two balls of 500 damage ea (minimum) plus the explosive damage.  I was looking for a whopping 2K average of damage, with the downside of it being mega slow to reload, so usefull on 1 large brute of an enemy but bad against hordes.
---
Then don’t do them?
---
Nobody is forcing you to do them.
---
Honestly I wish they would add more NW Dailies, but I can already hear the outcry
---
I prefer playing alone but other players can be a huge boon in helping you progress and learn. I mostly play solo but the benefits of teaming up are very high at present, you also reap rewards when teammates complete quests or kill enemies near you. You don't have to be sociable to be a good teammate just share a passive card and do your thing, I ignore other players 76% of the time anyways.
---
I could be wrong but I don't think the Gauss shotgun can be magic. 
---
I have an instigating 33 that does 200-300 damage per pellet.
---
Thanks you fellow dweller!
---
not play it?  they dont even like it.
---
Click on the middle button. The bottom one is for a wasterlanders quest. I just did the mother load quest yesterday.
---
Yeah but you're not going to change these imbeciles. It's best to let it go.
---
We've gotten backpacks &amp; repair kits thanks to suggestion, double xp events thanks to reddit threads, they take in regular people of different opinions for i.e. Nuclear Winter. Change the interface for the ammo converter in this case e.t.c.
---
But, you know, can't go on listing all the things they've done or else you'll be called a shill. Or they'll just drone on about how the changes are either shit in some way or just make logical sense enough that they shouldn't have been problems in the first place. Sometimes, but very rarely they genuinely realize they were in the wrong.
---
In short: The Fallout community is insufferable, it's a well known condition they have. Well, they might not themselves realize how much of a downer they are. 
---
In reality, the game is much more enjoyable just getting the updates without seeing this obnoxious notion that the community are somehow the ones responsible for the game being steered in the right direction while simultaneously shitting on devs for not listening to feedback.
---
you're not my supervisor
---
Sure, I know. Although I am not form US of A it counts as funny.  
---
Maaan I need to milk some brahmin milk finally. Can't feel relaxed any more without it. I-NEED-MORE-MILK : o  
---
Or try to look on lifebuoys as it was before F76...I just can't anymore. I am just counting the plastic possible to get from it...on and on  
---
Is my tap water I drink at my place alredy purifed? How much rads it has?

300 according to this.

Big eye roll
---
... What
---
Are mole miners considered creatures?
---
I bet that thing breaks very quickly.
---
Handicap yourself.
---
Or play a new game.
---
I'm on PC.  It's not great here either.  Opening the weapon wheel within 15 minutes of loading the game will pretty much crash it.
---
me after just finishing my camp: "a shit, here we go again."
---
Several rewards for Meat week in there (The Challie costume and mask, the grill), and camp stuff has a few uses … junk walls are a win, and the fence even more, but after that? Not a strong release for me. 
---
But I'm happy for those who're enjoying this one! I know I was head over heels for the Responders drops, even if most people didn't care for it, so hey... live your life, chums!
---
I believe it cannot be magic due to the explosive effect. That seems to break whatever is causing the 'magic'.
---
Legendary perks would like to have a word with you.
---
I just use the daisycutter and blow up Slocums joe
---
I'm not on that team so I can't comment on how they operate. I do know that the struggle of say creating a build and sending to the next person in line can have lots of unforseen issues when working over a VPN. In studio you just open it on a network but now we need to send it off and upload it to a server (takes time), then have them download it (more time). They access it and if it works then we can continue development. If this has to happen multiple times a day you can imagine how you get a lot less done in a work day. I'm not saying they can't do more but development is already a messy process as it is.
---
Nothing sexual about it.
---

---
you spelled "she is the best" incorrectly
---
Give it another go! Come on, you can do it! It only caused me to develop a slight fear of the ocean depths, that’s not that bad is it?
---
Ahh good, thought I was blind, could have sworn they where added in the last patch to the one before
---
He’s probably on the PTS.
---
OH! MUST TRY!!!!
---
They didn't though
---
That statement mostly applies to the people who trade as their primary entertainment and go to other subs and discords to do so. Also, the rare god roll item might be worth so much that it makes more sense to trade for a god roll you want. But if you're like me and don't care enough to seek people out, caps will always have value. I am almost level 500 now, and only now for the first time reached the point where I had to close my shop to avoid hitting cap.
---
Usually it's back where it was at the ID printer at the top floor of the HQ.
---
Some items seem to return to where they originally were if you log out before using them.  If you return to the 3rd floor it shoul let you print a new I'd card??
---
The entire fucking point of having seasons over daily challenges was that Bethesda was handing out too many free atoms. That's why we get so much fewer out of this system.
---
You've completed the season early, congratulations. You're not getting anything less out of it just because you're not still getting rewards for the next couple of weeks, you just got everything you could get sooner than they expected.
---
You're not entitled to any more or less rewards than anyone else at this point, go fucking relax until next season.
---
Gauss shotgun can be magic.  I dont think it works with that though.  I think it's the armor one.
---
What did you expect? It takes time to solve a Collosal Problem.  
---
^(I'mgonnaheadout.)
---
Considering we now get patches monthly, this ‘ton’ of good additions was more like a trickle. Still far too many issues they won’t acknowledge or address.
---
In this update? I hope so...
---
They were wrong and that hurt.
---
Very!  Even with level 5 gunsmith equipped it drops visibly after a few shots.
---
It's in the patch notes??
---
HA, this made me laugh.
---
I spent 8 months working on a project last year, well beyond the 3 months we originally planned, and then in the end the whole thing was scrapped because of a reorganization. 
---
Even this other project I’m working on, started in June.  It was expected to be 5-10 hours of week for 4 weeks to get it done, I’m just starting to wrap up now.
---
Pretty! I like the rainbow balcony. 
---
Just in case you aren't already aware, the location of the camp box controls where you and other players arrive.
---
I thought this whole craze started with a Youtube video made about the Gauss Shotgun's crazy damage with certain effects equipped. It should be more than 200-300 per pellet, my understanding is the "magic" was the weapon's full damage readout per pellet. Meaning, per the discussions I've read, a critical "should" trigger 2300x8 in my case.
---
76 has desperately needed new end game content since about 2 weeks after launch, that is for sure. But if you're bored for crying out loud play something else.
---
That it's in game. But not able to be activated yet. Will be doable in the coming weeks
---
Seeming that way. Watching the game grow like watching a disabled dog try to make pancakes
---
I dunno. Cave crickets kill me more than anything, apart from serendipity not kicking in and saving me when I’m being a dick with the SS jetpack.
---
To be fair, it's not "most of the challenges". It's a few.
---
I've always been a solo player, and FO76 is totally doable as such.  Highly recommended.  You might even find you can do group events and still feel comfortable.  I don't have a mic and the new event groups you can join this season don't even feel like groups.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’ve read that if you have a legendary effect that’ll make the shotgun “magic” but also have a piece of armor with the specific legendary effect that affects it as well, it’ll cancel out, causing the shotgun to be normal
---
Unfortunately no. Anyone who stored stacked boards can still use those. Just the people who blueprinted them
---
Jesus Christ calm down mam
---
Well, it's technically IN the patch they just have it turned off until they can sort it out properly.
---
Or at least make them sellable
---
The middle button takes me to the lobby, am I missing something?
---
Many people have had it happen
---
Oh right, even more weird that op is complaining.
---
Those are lifetime challenges not dailies
---
“A Colossal Problem” apparently has colossal problems. But have no fear! We have the distinct privilege to collect junk for the Brotherhood!
---
&gt; Light and Ultralight mods are coming as well.

Blame consoles. If we didn't need to wait on console certs we could be getting hotfixes for this kind of shit regularly, but instead we have to sit and wait until they compile the next big update and submit it to Sony and Microsoft.
---
One shot and slow-mo backflip 😂
---
actually quite a lot of people. if you dont believe me, click on the credits in the main menu.
---
and yes, i have actually watched the entire credits because i was bored.
---
Yes, this is actually part of a glitch people use
---
Try it without that armor piece.
---
I have 11 levels left... Gaining about one level per day but another event started on a different game I play and I’m considering just paying atoms to finish it so I don’t have to get on daily.
---
I thought this might have been the case, however I've tried removing the armor and using a different shotgun with 33 to no avail.
---
I tried, whenever I would activate the printer I would only receive a response from the computer greeting me, this was before I logged out too :(
---
He can kill a normal colossas, those are in game and have been for awhile. Ot he might have been doing the event in the pts
---
And now, the "Buy 3 Things from a Vendor" challenge will be way tougher since nobody will be selling their ammo anymore. heh.
---
shhhhh. dont tell anyone about this lol
---
yes
---
For reals.
---
it worked like that when the game came out, both the twoshot effects and the explosive effect addes 100% damage (they where still divided into four different hits but doing full damage each, the armor penetration wasnt a problem)
---
they where so effective that basically no matter what build you had, with a TSE weapon you could pretty much oneshot everything
---
bethesda than nerfed them, on paper the nerf should have worked fine and seemed quite balanced as you are still looking at around 40-50% damage increase but yeah its an underwhelming effect combination now and has some serious drawbacks
---
each hit causes weapon degradation meaning your weapon will degrade four times faster and the twoshot effect severely damages your accuracy
---
on heavy weapons like the .50cal wich you use outside of vats and in close quarters anyways it can still be a solid effectcombination but its nowhere near as effective as it once was
---
When you hit an enemy, do you get various random numbers for each pellet damage or the same numbers?
---
Different numbers signal that magic is working, consistent numbers it's not.
---
imposter sheepsquatch? Do it solo?
---
&gt;I can finally stop running away from Scorched Earth when I see boxes poppin
---
I do think it's a sweet endorsement of the community that other people will often pull out their boxes to share when someone else pops one, though. :) Glad to see this one fixed.
---
It would be a lot easier to fix than have to answer 50,000 tickets..... but you know Beth likes to do things the hard way.
---
Right on. I haven’t seen any posts about it when I’m on Reddit. Thanks. Just sucks I didn’t find it before Max rep lol
---
I seen alot of streams of the event already... Whats wrong with it???
---
Or when you go to use a bench he wont get off of.
---
Lol oops...
---
I dont know. Did you read the patch notes on the stickied post?
---
I don't think that's true. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJnUwaEzYbY&amp;t=227s
---
Yes to this. Make Queen fights great again 2021!
---
Nope
---
Probably the same as them parting you on the head and giving you 10000 edible script candy.
---
It has to be atleast half of these kill or do or visit different things ones
---
No, legendary perks were schedule for patch 22
---
Yes I have this good bug on one of my characters and it did seem to be the osmosis kit. I had found other "vital equipment" objects previously but they did not trigger the bug.
---
Ahh then I’m not too sure dude, I have the same problem with my gauss shotgun, but for some reason my 3* DB doesn’t suffer from this problem, who knows man
---
My hates the fact I got the raider/settler ones haha love it
---
No.  Those are coming in a month or so.
---
Now that you are a god you should spread your wealth.
---
No. Nor were they expected to.
---
Bring on the cork!
---
For sure. Lol or maybe get a pet floater some how and it will be air mailed.
---
Nice! I had him bartending at a bar called the Pipeline, and yes, it was that kind of bar.
---
Or let us sell them.  Some of us like them.

delete the post :D fast

So 50/50?

It literally is the pails and gifts, albeit with the mounted head plans removed.

The American dream
---
This is really cool!
---
It’s about time, however, most events and dailies just reward 1* gear right?
---
Hmm i like the thought of a B gunslinger, whats your thought on a B shotgunner build?
---
That would be awesome! Buy say, a legendary The Fixer plan for 2k bullion, then roll for the legendary effects with modules.
---
Already have an offer so whatever
---
Because one dog ain’t enough, and two is too low, it’s me, Three Dog! How you kids handlin’ Post-Apocalyptia today?

I hope the door is big enough for my pet deathclaw to enter. I like using the RR prefab for his den, but this is much more suitable.
---
Or some more storage?! Ffs I dont give a damn about the ammo converter, i want more camp storage and scrip. Fuck the devs
---
"never play on patch day"
---
Just. Throw. Them.
---
I do get random numbers on occasion. I noticed them last night on the SBQ, yet still did nowhere near the damage I've seen in the videos using the exact same gun/armor. If what little damage I was doing last night was the result of "magic", I don't want to think about how bad this weapon would be as originally intended.
---
The last one was 68gb for me (PS4), instead of the roughly 10gb it should've been. I think sometimes it just decides to do a complete reinstall
---
Unrelated but have you ever seen the super mutants talking to a floater at a random encounter? They say it's friendly and talk about it like it's a pet, and the floater even talks back in gurgles (which show in sub titles). Really interesting stuff I thought.
---
Some are very similar. I main heavy weps so I have

Heavy/no-pa/bloodied

Heavy/pa/bloodied

My magic quad bashing pump shotgun 1 shots just about everything. Lvl 95 deathclaws  explode into a gory mess as do lvl 68 super mutants. Try equipping Skeet Shooter under perception as I definitely notice a difference with it on even with a full set of unyielding.
---
Couple hours usually
---
If someone else already milked them you won't be able to milk them.
---
lol 14gb now, looks like i’m downloading the whole thing!
---
Gauss is the only one that is not 100% magic. I have tested shotguns and splitter based energy even the BE plasma gat with splitter is magic granted it eats up AP like mad (heavy lag spike infinite AP during queen will kill her in 30 seconds though). Plasma shotguns (non legendary) are lackluster in that they do no fire enough splits to one shot everything, an instigating however is a beast a bloodied magic might be awesome also lack one to test. Shotty lasers are better base thus they should be better legendary.   
---
The primary issue with the gauss shotty is that even with 95% hit it glitched and you could miss 8 shots in a row. There also seems to be a rubber band issue. Now the first few weeks of gauss was broken but they did a fix and well it is trash for reliable magic damage.   
---
Gauss minigun B2525 using magic armor is magic though but you need control and hit the same location with nearly no deviation so if you up close it is easier to do.
---
Oh I know... This fix is a godsend.
---
I've disconnected during SBQ when the 4th popped before and played on pvt server for an hour during double XP because of that goddamn bug
---
It took me like 18 minutes
---
Trueee...
---
Updates can't melt server cores.
---
Uh didn't think about this but most events don't drop me gear so I thought it was only by chance
---
Killing the Legendary =/= completing the event. 
---
If you're killing bloodbugs with a Bloodied Gauss Minigun without hitting the Brahmin you are a video game god.
---
Im going to fly up and catch the nuke à la The Iron Giant
---
Or you could just... choose the cards you want?
---
This post is bullshit. But this comment is 100% accurate.
---
It's laudable that, at this point, someone takes so seriously this game. My respects.
---
To me it's obvious that the problems derived by fragile programming/testing (bugs/exploits/duping/pc-hacking...) grow faster and bigger than the solutions for them.
---
Current workforce is not capable to properly fix this game and the company refused to locate more resources for the task.
---
Not complaining, just commenting it. Private commercial companies decide where to invest or not their money. I take it.
---
I assume that we will never see a solid FO76 game, remaining in the same chaotic state until FO76 totally dies.
---
They're males
---
No clue! They offer little context in their updates, just that they are still working on it.

Because we know what we’re going to det from the dev team.
---
right, thanks....
---
Got my revive someone on a new character at level 12 at the weekend .. just go to hard events and be prepared to sprint to anyone who goes down.. encrypid is almost guaranteed to give you lots of opportunities .. I got mine at the guided meditation event on a level 190.. :)
---
I think refined 50 gives the same damage as standard. Hasty is lower, and there's one other that's lower, but I definitely have one that does the same as the standard 50.
---
Skeet Shooter doesn't affect VATs accuracy and VATs is required for the "magic" effect to work.
---
Sorry, this is Fallout 76. RNG is life here. You want control? Find another game.
---
Last time the servers were down almost all day, right?
---
Wow kinda of sad about foundation exploit being removed. CAMP bugs are the bread and butter of CAMP builders who like to push their builds to next level.
---
Another one I don't see mentioned is while using the Gatling Plasma/Laser on console it takes upwards of 6 dpad button presses to get a stimpak to activate.
---
It's so bad that I've put away my Gatling Plasma because it's guaranteed 2-3 deaths on the Queen because you simply can't heal yourself in time.
---
The final straw was right after the Scorched Earth event ended I pressed the dpad to heal 6 times in a row but got nothing and lost my flux for dying after the event ended. The gun went into the stash after that even though it is one of my favorites.
---
We lost two days and got the event extended by 7 days. Yeah, that was really horrible.
---
The first shot from bows in VATS always misses, even if it's 100%, unless you use a crit. Even if you use a crit, the arrow doesn't actually hit, but kinda bounces around and the enemy just takes the damage.
---
This gets asked a lot, honestly no way to tell. I think last maintenance wasn't done until 3-4 hours after it was taken down, so there's about 30 mins-1 hour left
---
Throw a couple. They're useless.
---
You mean the BOS board game season?
---
New Year's Clean White Tux
---
She’s the first one I came across. Fast travel less often
---
We all have it coming, kid.
---
Im glad I didn't bother to look at roadmap
---
Hey who said flamer fuel didn't come in the 10mm variety.....
---
I’m lazy lol. I have the firework equipped so I get faster reload. I’d hate to forget to equipped it again.
---
Just knowing what something is worth can go a long ways to making caps fast.
---
Case in point; I found a 3* bloodied/ffr/faster reload minigun in a player vendor last night for 895 caps. Dunno if they missed a zero, had maxed scrip, or was passing on a deal because most of their other stuff was normally priced.
---
I relisted it in my vendor for significantly higher and it sold before the end of my play session.
---
I always check my purveyor rolls on Fed76 too, because more than once something that was useless to me, ended up being worth a ton, like the J/E/90RW minigun I rolled last week that almost got sold for 15k caps.
---
I also convert all random ammo found in the wild to 5.56 and sell for 2 caps each, almost every play session I get cleaned out of my 5.56. I also sell .308, .50, fusion cells and 2mm EC @1 each and 2 capsfor 2mm. Fusion cores I sell @ 50-70 caps.
---
Serums and flux can usually be bought and sold or crafted for a profit.
---
Knowing what outfits are expensive can help you scoop deals too.
---
Clearly you’re a total moron that can’t actually work with explanations so I’ll just ignore you
---
Oh for the... I don’t have shielded. Stupid son of a- alright, so I guess I have to find that plan somewhere. Totally not regretting all this wasted time. Not at all, it’s fine.
---
Needs quite a bit more than that available though. Learned that the hard way bringing mine back from power save and seeing an cannot download, insufficient space error.
---
I've got 'using iron sights on hunting rifles causes the bullet to hit the player' for 100 caps!
---
Which is honestly nice, to give a chance to people that missed and maybe do not have the possibility to trade for them with other players. Do you by any chance have more info about those new cosmetics or maybe a post you could refer me to?
---
Combat for sure. I kinda miss the cinematic kills in vats from Fallout 4, but vats being real time in 76 kinda honed my skills a bit.
---
Example, my buddy and I were doing Riding Shotgun and we got to the pause in the event, I took the opportunity to run ahead and grab the crates since I know where they all are, told my buddy to wait there and not touch any buttons. 
---
I get about halfway through the tunnels ahead and see my buddy go down on our team thing, turns out she went through the door and didn’t know about the blood eagles that spawn in and ambush you in that room with the stairs. I surfaced out of that bloody tunnel and ran back to them as fast as I could, and I burst through that door like John Wick and headshot both of the blood eagles outside of vats, they pretty much died in sync. I stimmed my buddy and we finished the rest of the event.
---
Yes that is how it was explained in the patch notes
---
For me gauss shotguns have been...tricky. I just stick to my combat or pump action and they one to two shot everything.
---
Ahhh yes the Brohmins
---
The only RNG is the perks cards in the packs, every other card is something that you choose and are unlocked as you level up. Edit to add: you also can’t “stockpile” level ups...e.g. If you are level 10, you can’t save up 5 levels to spend all the points on a level 15 card you have to use the perk points in order. 
---
Other than the highest level perk cards that you will need a few levels to max out ranks, you should have your basic build ready by level 50.
---
As to the cards themselves, they have rarity, so you get like 2-3 ”common” cards and then an uncommon or rare card.  I mean, if you really wanted to rely on the perk card packs you could focus on taking the “rare” cards and hoping that your common cards are the ones from the pack, but honestly I don’t think that’s even necessary.
---
Unless you’re trying to completely re=tweak your character, you should be done a few levels after 50
---
But seemingly still compulsory
---
If you could milk all kinds of Brahmin you would get some very different kind on milk.
---
Why didn’t you select it?
---
So that end, I'd also say run "Queen of the Hunt" before you start.  
---
If you're lucky it'll be a Wendigo, and then you've more bonuses.
---
Until they finish it /s
---
Remember when the first updates came out early? And we were hoping that was going to be the usual? Yeah me too, good times
---
A cheap refrigerator that's not butt ugly.
---
And a freakin Fixer skin, pulease!
---
I knew that worked with the fast fire rate magic weapons, just haven't ever gotten it to work for me with an explosive shotgun. At least not to the same level I could with a non-explosive.
---
Depends on the prices in your vendors and how your camp looks like.

Well, we're all really heartbroken that you can't find any adversaries worthy of you in-game.

Oh yeah, I always forget the Todd tax
---
Greatest movie of all time.
---
When Bethesda comes up with a system that does not reward XP gain, I could agree on extra rewards. With exploits and glitches people were done within a week. I see lvl 1000+ players who survived the july banwaves. Plus I still see people advertising glitched events on Discords. I see people sniping with gatling lasers shooting everything at almost every event . So please introduce robust season challenges then we can talk about rewards.  
---
I even deleted a character and rerolled a bloodied/unyielding build. Just so I can gain xp faster. My daily routine is now based in on gaining fast xp instead of playing the game. I heard this from more players.   
---
Also free atoms is a terrible marketing construction. People would need stuff to spend their "free" atoms on and then a newer and shinier object would have been added so these players would buy atoms to get that item aswell. Bethesda really had to push out Atom shop items to pay the server and then some more items to pay the item designers. Can you imagine if item 1 or item 2 was not selling? Only the free atoms would be spend that week.  
---
(still I love to see not all cool items go in Atom Shop, but be unlocked by playing the game)
---
I use them to annoy and scare my friends lol.
---
Well stop min maxing.
---
40/60 then,not a single digit less though. To be fair expecting common sense in 2020 is asking for too much lol
---
I have the exact same weapon and armor (legendary effects and all) seen in the video using an almost identical build. I can't get anywhere close to that damage. My Gauss Shotgun is awful, let me know if you can replicate that because I really am curious! As it stands, this weapon is absolutely not worth the grind to get it and I regret respec'ing my build around it in anticipation of a fun reward for reaching max rep.
---
It usually ends right around the time it’s finished. Give or take.....
---
I’m expecting BoS expansion to drop sometime around March 2021, honestly. I’ll fall out of my chair if they actually got it out to us this year. I’m convinced Bethesda is simply not staffed/managed well enough for this live service game. If they are serious about this game enduring, they need a faster output of new content, and they really need to invest in more quality control if they hope to overcome all these missed commit dates. Just one player’s observation.
---
Per server, per vendor, and 2 @ Whitespring station.
---
how many people don't realize the perks they choose on level-up aren't randomized?
---
No, I don’t think we know what the next season will be, and new quests are confirmed

Wow. It woulda been super mega funny if it was in that one pipe that you can glitch your base around! Lol.
---
Only if it also finds nukashine.
---
Yea, but I'd take keeping them over fixing the lag any day of the week.
---
Are you talking out of packs or are you talking about when you level up selecting you’re perk.
---
There is no RNG in the selecting your perks when you level up.  They are level locked.  
---
You should be able to finish off your build a few levels after, never even relying on your perk card packs.

---
Bruh, these are all good things, why is everyone whining? Think back to when this game first launched and look at all the progress that's been made.
---
Okay the colossal event needs a little more tweaking... the update is FREE! 
---
I've roasted Beth when they deserve it, check my post history.. this is not one of those times where its warranted.
---
They made the ammo converter good! They listened! 10x and 100x options!
---
I hate this sub some times. Some of you need to grow up.
---
Junk walls!
---
I think we can agree both are bad
---
I’m not asking for dates, the title literally says what’s the point in giving us them, a vague time frame would be less disappointing, yes some will be annoyed but at least then you don’t get the massive backlash of disappointing the player base again and again and again 
---
And even then, they would know that it would not have been coming today before today, so why didn’t they inform the player base lining their pockets 
---
I’m not asking for miracles here
---
YES. That and the settler wanderer guitar song. I don’t even have the settler wanderer at my camp, I only hear it when I go vendor shopping at other peoples camps

No problems playing alone.  You won't miss anything important for not playing.

PUT THE UDDERS IN MY MOUTH

theres another very interesting bug with combat shotguns with the range being in the negatives. captainoob made a video on it. Link:https://youtu.be/nETieFaCmiY
---
once you learn fo76 was suppose to be a [fo4 multiplayer option](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76), it all makes a lot more sense. fo4 came out way before cheap battle royales and such were plentiful and widely accepted. i think once Zenimax (the parent company of Bethesda) saw the potential in games like PUBG and Fortnite, they abruptly decided to make this little online anomaly a full blown "game-as-a-service". keep in mind, no one remembers the actual base game of Fortnite (you know, Save the World, which is pretty good), but everyone knows about Fortnite Battle Royale. i think Zeni was after that same effect, cheap game, looks good (for what it is), keep pulling easy money on season passes (fo1st) and atoms. And with Todd Howard not wanting to upset his corporate overlords, he has to sit there and pretend everything was intentional. Most Fallout fans dont even know who or what Zenimax is, so Zeni dont care, not going to affect their stock value. Remember, at the end of the day, companies like Zenimax and Betheda are corporate entities. most of the executive team havent even played the games they are responsible for. all that matters is that the return on investment is good. did you enjoy the game? who gives a fuck. but did you pay for the game? yes? then who cares if you enjoyed it. im not being cynical, thats just business.  i mean, look at fo76. its not a finished product. no developer passionate about games would release that. but a major corporate entity trying to meet fiscal deadlines would...

Um.... perk cards are not RNG. You can select exactly what cards you want every single time you level up.
---
Edit: some of the other comments here are astounding me.
---
Regarding the Submachine Gun’s prime receiver, it’s actually not alone in doing more damage. 
---
Many full auto guns actually have their prime receivers do slightly more than their powerful auto receivers. 
---
* Handmade powerful auto = 50 
---
* Handmade prime auto = 52
---
* Assault rifle powerful auto = 37
---
* Assault rifle prime auto = 38
---
* Combat rifle powerful auto = 45
---
* Combat rifle prime auto = 46
---
* Pipe rifle powerful auto = 29
---
* Pipe rifle prime auto = 30
---
* 10mm pistol powerful auto = 31
---
* 10mm pistol prime auto = 33
---
The Fixer is TBD as I’ve yet to confirm its prime auto stats. Likely will follow same trend. 
---
Same with the Radium Rifle. I don’t have enough mods unlocked to have all the base damage info. 
---
I also don’t have 10mm SMG prime plans yet either.
---
Worth noting is the SMG does not have a powerful auto receiver, only hardened (and armor piercing) due to its full auto nature by default. It still follows the same trend though for the “conventional” automatic guns. 
---
Great list btw. I’ve experienced a lot of these myself so I’m happy to see so many oddities captured in one thorough list.
---
The Gauss Shotgun is a ballistic weapon.

Why does the steam version get a significantly smaller download size?
---
Nobody knows.  Including Bethesda.
---
It lasts as long as it lasts. Chill. They are bringing literally nothing new today.
---
And? They're still busted.
---
seems a little silly to me to have 4+ hours of downtime to fix a few bugs, but the 'atom shop must go on' i suppose
---
So called the red version of the Commie power armor, especially with what the power armor is based on. That being the MS-06 Zaku II.
---
Well it seems they didnt patch fireworks bug. So at least some beneficial Bugs still present.
---
i think you can put a scope on it but thats about it
---
Have they even acknowledged this problem yet?  Several people reported this here and on the official forums months ago and we're still looking at zebra stripes in reflections...
---
I'm pretty sure that, at least for me, the refined 50 has the same damage as standard, but the other 50s are lower. It might be a different one, but there's definitely one 50 receiver that does the same damage as the regular one.
---
Yay! So this bug isn't just me going mad. Have it happen with two ski swords I have and also occasionally the Gatling Lasers.
---
What time should i expect the xbox servers to be up?
---
Single action is like the fancy one?I havent used that one..speed load on the western is very nice though
---
Then don’t give strict deadlines... and don’t delay on the day that it’s supposed to be released...
---
"it's damage is lower, and it's reload takes longer" 
---
You answered your own question
---
That's dumb
---
All good. And it’s really hard to see tone and context with texts lol.
---
I just cant believe people can talk seriously about the end game and builds when we have broken weapons to melt the queen in seconds better than any gun that would ideally be the best for your build atleast on paper.  And the ability to walk around with essentially god mode through other mutation effects that I don't want to describe since I've been banned from this subreddit before for "promoting exploits" as if no one doesn't already know about them since day 1 and I've been calling for them to be fixed.
---
Every single level you can select a new card... you don’t need to wait for a pack.
---
The ammo converter is still shit because some moron decided to make it use a terminal instead of the trading interface like anyone else would have used
---
Oh wow, thanks, missed that!
---
Could that concrete bunker be for the interior world camp they were talking about?
---
All I know is that I have definitly killed a grafton monster, fog crawler, hermit crab, flatwoods monster and completed lucky strike. Thats 5 different bugged objectives preventing me from getting challenges done just off the top of my head.
---
It might have something to do with damage drop-off over distance, shotguns have very short range, when I use explosive ones I try to keep the distance so I won’t kill myself, but with non-explosive shotguns I usually shoot from only a few feet away.
---
remember when they claimed that there would be a few surprises that 'were not on the roadmap' ?? hard to believe those are ever coming.
---
[](/cadenceworried)I want some of the new datamined stuff, but the new patch notes have "Fixed an issue where foundation pieces could be built in invalid circumstances." so now I'm too scared to move any of my foundations around to see if I can fit any of them on the chance they'll no longer be considered valid.
---
Mark him as an Earle and give him his own magazine.  +15% on anyone named Earle.
---
Well I’m wasting my time here instead of playing the game and getting downvoted just for having little fun
---
I was happy for the extension, but I honestly thought it was too long. I participated the entire time but was glad when it ended.
---
Also, with the new community event, a second meat week is possible. So let’s say it’s broken this time around, another extension would be meat hell.
---
Now I’m confused and don’t remember what button I pushed. I’m also stoned right now. I really did that quest yesterday. It could be a bug for you.
---
true but also the girl that rights the plans out for you speaks english &amp; chinese &amp; most likely would’ve written it in english so you could understand
---
Dang... Count me in that populous...
---
Did the roadmap say Colossal Problem would start on today's date? Or is another bullshit complaint from someone who struggles with comprehension?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Nope. It has 3 or 4 less attack points. In which case, what's the point?
---
If you’re on PS4 I have quite a few magic shotguns if you want to try one. I like to use them when I’m xp grinding
---
He’s a bum.
---
You ungrateful candyassed piece of latecomer trash.  How **dare** you question our mission?  You think you’re tough trashing the names of my Brothers that fell trying to establish a toehold against the Scorch plague?  To bemoan our very limited choices in basing, logistics, and strategy after the Fall?
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
All of this while your pathetic ass abandoned humanity as you sat in your precious Vault.  Eating the food stockpiled by men and women that died when the bombs fell.  Whining because you were bored playing ‘Red Menace’ and wished there were more games on your shiny PipBoy.  
---
All this while my Brothers bled.
---
Your little ‘Appalacia’ is a small place in a big fucking world.  We sent what men and resources we could….and you’re right, it wasn’t enough.  Not by far.  Why didn’t we send more?  Because we were too busy trying to save humanity in the 90% of the rest of America.  And by ‘save’ I mean doing the Lord’s work for the thankless dregs of humanity that were more concerned with their vaulted ‘Independence’ than they were about survival and rebuilding.
---
You fucking disgust me.
---
But we’re coming back.  To save your worthless ass.  Have your tithes ready, because if we can’t pull it off this time, it’s all on you and your pansy ass Vault Dweller friends that sat out when the going got rough.
---
Should be a unique pool but I haven’t seen anything
---
Lol yah it’s still down.  I prob won’t be able to play today at all
---
I used this "glitch" for months, but now it seems according to the patch notes Bethesda is trying to fix this with patch 21. It seems now I actually have to do the daily instead of just collecting the rewards. Or maybe not ... we will see how they implemented the "fix" mentioned in the patch notes.
---
Well... to be honest...
---
Found a Gatling for my wife’s new build. Had to make room until she signed back on.
---
Definitely.  That way I won’t accidentally scrip mine 😐
---
I honestly thought they'd release it but have to take it down immediately because his fear attack duped weapons or some shit.
---
AM i the only one not very happy with that? Apart from fixer the rest added to pool we can easily get the better way (in crafting we choose exactly what part we want) so if you have plans and want specific Item its 100% better to Craft them. What we got not is just more rng into current loot. So if some1 wants bloodied gatling or 50cal now his chances diminished significantly(if he owns the plans) also other thing is that items from plans (again not fixer) cannot be traded so we are stuck with more items only to be scrapped (with still the same limit-150). 
---
TLTR: Personally i have already my SSarmor i dont need loot be cluttered with parts of it which can only be scrapped.
---
I just want some cool costumes and more camp stuff!
---
Here’s to hoping 🙏🏻🙏🏻
---
i don't know about the Single Action Revolver, but I know you can put one on the vastly superior Western Revolver, so why bother?
---
Doing even less after the update.  Cabin based.
---
I heard its the same as pails and presents...
---
I hope that's not true. Hoping for at least chance at something unique or another shot at the treasure hunter plans again wouldnt hurt... but please no more mounted plans.
---
Nope, everything but t60. I'm still missing a couple plans.
---
I believe only 45 and 51 were in those. I could be wrong but out of the hundreds that I had opened, I didn't receive a single one.
---
Of course
---
All 38, 10mm, and 44 goes into my Vending at 0 Caps.
---
None.
---
I wish that were the case with my Gauss Shotgun. Theoretically I have one of the best legendary rolls I could get with it and I still struggle to 1 hit super mutants (just out of range of killing myself with the gun's inherent explosive damage). I can't help but feel like I've got a massive egg on my face for putting in all this effort for an end game reward outclassed by most other weapons.
---
Ah oky doky
---
Mid-afternoon now, great. /S
---
Yeah but see these are *special* locks okay?
---
An emote that simply asks 'WTF?" for when something weird happens...i can see it getting used often.
---
I think FO4 had a Perk to boot the door down if you're in Power Armor.
---
Considering its just the combat rifle with an extra effect they should just be covered under those skins.
---
Yeah they trusted an A.I. in Mass Effect and look what happened to the galaxy.
---
Hard pass.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
When you have a level up and go into your window (over level 50), it will give you the option to pick a perk card or to move a perk point.  
---
When you go into “choose a perk card”, you can shift over to perception and all the cards should be available to pick.  “Tank killer” should be there (and I’m pretty sure they are in alphabetic order), you would then be able to pick that card.
---
Now if you have leveled up on a 5, had perk card packs stored from before, or claimed it from SCORE, you can open that perk pack and get random cards (including a gold animated card).  
---
Unless you’re talking NW but that’s something different.
---
I feel you.  It’s good to have a goal on the board, but also important to know which ones can be adjusted or left behind eventually
---
Ah fuck
---
The Fixer unfortunately doesn't have a skin slot. I hope that's something changeable but I don't expect Bethesda to properly fix it.
---
Important note: sell plans does not mean sell 300 mounted head plans and 20 T-45 Hydraulic Bracer plans. Uncommon/rare CAMP plans and weapon plans are what you should look to sell. Prime receivers are so-so.
---
I can barley contain my frustration.
---
I've got like 800 maps i need to go do. And then still not get the plans haha
---
Dont foreget that the unique weapon "The VATS Unknown" still only drops at level 20 rendering it useless with high level players.
---
That's still pretty suboptimal if it works that way...and that doesn't scan with me having extra cards for perks I've already maxed out. I have also only ever gotten one of the tank killer cards that has three levels, meaning I can't upgrade that skill. And I'm past level 50.
---
I'm certainly not starting over. This game is fun, but not fun enough to do that.
---
I think its because the fixer is actually a unique combat rifle so there's probably some sort of developer bullshit reason why it won't work.
---
I'd happily take one cap each. At least that would be something
---
Pretty damn funny .... even funnier if your name refers to being a pirate fan
---
I had a quad at one point.  reloading that was hysterical.
---
Trying to avoid meat sweats
---
They said mid-afternoon now
---
Some people have posted they anticipate the events will be successful regardless of the amount actually turned in, as in the results have been decided already. Which makes sense. It won't look good if so many people opt out it fails, or they set the amounts too high and it fails. Also, having to keep track of the turn ins accurately and reliably would require extra work. Basically just easier to fudge the whole thing, but who knows, we might crash and burn.
---
There's so much missing from the PTS I feel like I need unpatched notes
---
I had just made an alt and had to redo this. Last time I had a level 30 in power armor to help me, now I was all alone. I basically ran in circles getting it to hit the punji boards. I then resorted to sneaking and shooting it, running away, and repeat. It took a while at level 18, but that’s how I did it at least.
---
Once you select a SPECIAL to put a point in, it will shows cards for said category.. However at the bottom it tells you that you can scroll between the categories. So for example, you put a point in Endurance but want to upgrade or select a card in luck, you can change your category after you put the point in (on xbox it's LB/RB). That's how you can choose the exact cards you want to upgrade without relying on packs.
---
That would be nice.
---
I think 2 people are working as developers, 1 Support in EU to processing Ticket ( Im still waiting that my ticket will be processsed, i payed real money, but they dont give a damn) and maybe 1 - 2 people for support in USA and the rest of the world.
---
at least that is how it feels
---
I hear you.that combination of rolls on that GShotty is almost like finding a unicorn.it has the right perks .hopefully it serves you well.that should be one shooting most normal mobs...idk
---
I mean, I generally want it open all the time as it is.
---
Its been over a uear since I did this but the video should still hold up. Markers were working back then...

Today's Fallout 76 maintenance is taking longer than we initially expected due to some infrastructure updates that we are actively working to apply. We are now anticipating that maintenance may last into mid-afternoon, but at this time we don't have a more precise time frame to share. We'll continue to keep you updated in this thread as maintenance progresses, and we'd like to thank you for your patience during this extended downtime. 
---
If you haven't already, you can [**head here to check out the patch notes**](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/2Z8aZWK1CISDkxWAcwQhw8/fallout-76-update-21-patch-notes-august-4-2020) for Update 21 on Fallout.com.
---
Agreed. Or at least give FO1st its own shopping tab with a couple of past items instead of just the single weekly discounted item. Call it FO1st vault access.
---
Quad ammo
---
Try killing them on a different character? I dunno what to say. Those completed for me, but I also did them a long time ago. Maybe Wastelanders broke 'em again?
---
It's range, and vats hit chance are just a little bit better. But not anywhere near enough to save it sadly.
---
I make him wear a nice suit. Raider punk no more! Now your just a dude into radio networks.
---
How spongy is the WC, anyway?
---
They said they expect the  maintenance to last til mid afternoon due to "infrastructure" updates. Take of that what you will
---
I suppose figuring out how many "perk coins" or whatever they end up calling it is a pretty big deal, but I can't imagine it would take 4 months to figure that out.
---
I did the same but even then people would buy 1, 2, 3 for the dailies. Nooooo please take them all!
---
A fellow Percepti-Bobble Chad I see
---
Servers seemed to still be down (EDT) and I didnt see any updates (Xbox). I even checked the store. Guess I'll kill a few mins transfering from internal to external HD
---
I dont know what to tell you then, just watched the video he is completely melting things using that magic shotgun
---
Probably the plans from Christmas and the Treasure hunt, along with something new. Maybe something BoS related.
---
But hopefully, HOPEFULLY not mainly mounted head plans.
---
Wow. Why is this taking so insanely long? Got dailies burning here!
---
Pretty sure u can get these plans from treasure maps as well, although rare.
---
Four more hours! /s
---
And I’m back. lol I did miss it.

You can, but I can't be bothered with those.

If they did that the gun would fall thought the floor and you will lose it or something...
---
Too late, she already had them on when I got there
---
same
---
Yeah. The effect is random at times. It's not a 100 percent guarantee to work every time. I have tried removing and putting back on the armor piece,  but that didn't trigger it when it wasn't working. I think lag is a huge issue. If there is a lot of lag,  the game can't calculate the damage fast enough and it overwhelms the server. Instead of capping the damage,  each shot registers more damage exponentially. You can see it when her health bar drops. At first it hardly moves and then it starts humming.  By the second life, the bar is gone in a second
---
I’ve been dropping a lot of ammo even though I knew it would be updated.  My stash is full and I’m bleeding ammo, can only keep so much unwanted stuff in there..
---
About as fun as reloading my quad pump shotgun.
---
Source?  I didn’t see anything on the twitter.
---
now we should be allowed to buy the ammo in bigger numbers instead of mashing buttons
---
It is what it is!
---
Technically a bramin, but I prefer your description 😀
---
There was a floor piece that was glossy black with gold trimming and I *really* need it to finish off my Enclave outpost.
---
Youre a genius
---
&gt;but please no more mounted plans.
---
exactly. Thanks to dupers, those plans all over the place.
---
Faction berets which were already datamined.

&gt;  I know people that took the day off of work for the release
---
A true /r/firstworldproblems moment.
---
Level 415 here, I have played this game 100% alone.  Even when I joined public groups I only do it for the bonus. I never actually look where the other players are on the map.
---
 You can join any event solo and still get the same rewards. 
---
 If you like playing the previous fallout games you'll feel right at home playing 76.
---
I think the last big update took until like 5pm too.
---
Your research &amp; diligence is incredible!
---
To be fair the east coast did just get pounded with a tropical storm.
---
Walls: Fixed an issue that could allow walls to be snapped to overhanging roofs and upper floors, which could be used to create floating walls
---
If this means what I think it means- this would be the end of curved/circular buildings, treehouses, half-width hallways, pretty much my entire building style. Camp building is 90% of why I play this game and this "patch" cripples a major workaround to their ridiculously limited building mechanics.
---
I really hope this isn't true. Or at least not to the extent I'm dreading.
---
amazing.
---
Are you sure? Because my shogun takes two shots on super mutants without it equipped but with it equipped they go down in one. The card is supposed to make the cone smaller and I swear I see more damage #s pop up with Skeet Shooter equipped whh would make sense as more shots are hitting.
---
Thankies.
---
:cries in strangler/thorn:
---
Since we can loot SS armor now, can we trade it?
---
That looked satisfying
---
Brohammer we need to chill a bit we are kinda going to fast with the bro jokes a bit, we are breaking the brometer.
---
If the Brotherhood was serious about resources they would have nuked the raiders, but went for easy pickings in the Responders and Free States.
---
Children of atom fo4
---
If you need another tank killer, just pick another tank killer at your next level up. You can do this at any time before level 50 assuming you meet the level requirements for the cards. You don't have to get them from perk packs. All cards are available to pick at each level up after you meet the level requirement for them.
---
Now look, I took one python course, so I think I know a thing or two about development. This is almost as bad as when I got a fresh bag of chicken tenders and found out they were nuggets instead!
---
I'm sure the whole world cares what you're sure of
---
Junk walls and the raider/junker themed stuff that was datamined.
---
No mention of Navi GPU reflections problem. Would be nice to at least hear that they know it is a thing.
---
Its infrastructure problems, lol.
---
Ive killed the Grafton monster on about 4 different characters at this point
---
Classic
---
Bethesda naming the event "A Colossal Problem"
---
Joker: "Poor choice in words"
---
Is that still an issue? I thought their last fix for it worked. Not that the weapon is any useful at level 50 anyway, but still
---
Yup, no score for me either here in Europe. Some peeps gotta work tomorrow.
---
Amount or size? I think that’s an important distinction

Do you think it will load faster and actually find a server to place my camp on now? lol....

I'd rather legendary perks over loadouts. I'd give me a reason to actually play currently

All that’s going to do is irritate people trying to deposit materials. Bethesda won’t give a shit lmao

Ahhhh....now I just feel silly. Code cracked. Thank you for your assistance. While I still think the random nature of the perk packs is crappy, I see that you can finish up by at least level 60, if not sooner. Sucks if you miss out while climbing up to 50, but not as bad as I thought. Thanks for the comments.
---
Pretty much the state of this subreddit. Wish it was more screenshot, camp photos, character stories, and lore stuff.
---
I really wish the mini nukes were more viable, I love hearing that sound they make as they fly in the air.
---
no, but this is wild
---
I hope is not another episode of bethesda community managers having no fking clue so they said some weeks in the future while the reality is that devs said probably friday is live or something... same shit happened to FASNATCH, same shit with only the 1st season pass would be free... i want to be wrong otherwise i would become a person that would love to see some employees fired bc of incompetence without any remorse
---
I do on PS4, but I usually only sell upgraded underarmor that doesn't require flux to craft. In my experience most shoppers didn't want to pay much for underarmor and none of my characters are high level enough that they're drowning in excess flux.   
---
Also, I sell them for 100-200c. In my opinion this is a good deal for an item which boosts special stats by a significant amount... but they still sell relatively slowly.
---
Ues it will be
---
Any news on this patch fixing the bugs that come from installing the game on non-boot drives through the Xbox Store?
---
My SSD is small so installing it there isn't really a possibility and working around it is a headache and needs to be done every time you open the game.
---
Yes. But how much cork, concrete, glass, leather do you have. Steel and wood are the easy ones and everyone probably has 1k of each without knowing since those are the two most common supplies from scrapping a weapon.
---
We don’t know yet, maintenance is still happening
---
would be funny if they were just missing the prime receiver or sumn
---
Worst advertising ever

"the most anticipated event." Sure, pal.
---
Yes, last time it just finished as I got home from work.
---
Thankfully it was delayed on account of being really bad.
---
It feels shitty when they go "We are updating" "We are updating" "We are updating" "We are updating" and then after 4 hours go "FUCK NORMALLY THIS IS OVER,  BUT WE BEEFED IT"
---
Real shame
---
Could be coding, and a coincidence. You can’t really wrap your head around that one
---
Also with plasma weapons of you kill them in the air. Their corpses turn to that green goo pile way in the air so you can't loot it, such as a scorchbeast. When they already blind you with that stupid screech ring they do for 5 seconds constantly. Artificial difficulty.
---
Thanks anyways
---
Like wtf keeps going wrong? We know the battle works, plenty of people have killed the thing in Cranberry Bog just fine since Wastelanders came along. Maybe the "run away" reaction keeps fucking things up? Especially when in an instanced interior?
---
Physical pen testers and such.  What if someone figured out you broke into their century old safe?
---
Human destroy
---
Monkey create
---
what system u on?
---
I believe there is an actual explanation for the stock, this game ignores all sorts of reason with this and attachments work entirely in tiers. I.e, you will have a mod that has +1 rank of armor penetration and reload speed, or +2 in reload speed, and those will affect other stats like weight and value in similar tiers. The default standard mods are almost always the lightest in their class because they have a neutral ranking. There are many cases of counter intuitive things like long barrels being lighter than short due to this

Saddest thing about this is that you only got 681xp

I don't trust the Overseer.  She was fine with all the experiments Vault-Tec had.  She could have exposed them instead of letting thousands die deaths worse than nukes and ghouls.  If I was in a room with her, a Raider, and a Scorched, I'd target her first.  Only thing I trust less is a Vault-Tec or Enclave ZAX or a Zetan.
---
We don’t know, any time from today to the next two months probably
---
I mean, pretty much every other build struggles compared to stealth rifle/commando builds right now. The bloodied variety anyways.
---
But this is a minor patch, not major. But yeah, patches sometimes take longer.
---
From my understanding it across all platforms.
---
Yep, it's fairly specific. It goes away if you equip a different weapon or fast travel, you then have to re-equip the fireworks to bring the glitch back
---
I liked the Bald Eagle icon
---
A nuke?
---
&gt; Nuclear Winter - Add the ability to see your Overseer Rank progress bar without having to die
---
This is so frustrating with the frequency of "overseer rank up" S.C.O.R.E. daily challenges.  But hey, at least they did fix the limited release NW rewards bug.
---
i use them, and often frags, at the door of my camp :
---
BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.  BOOM.
---
always hoping that there is no one in the bushes
---
This is great! I'm going to use this to determine where my next camp is going.
---
Ikr, I was sad it wasnt a Gatling gun, til I price checked it and realized I might need to embrace the Junkies build.
---
The radio messages have been getting slightly more clear over time. However, players solved all the messages a while ago and posted a reddit report on it.
---
Wouldn’t releasing an event that had bugs or performance issues be sheer incompetence?  Isn’t pulling something back that isn’t ready a sign of integrity to make sure things were right?
---
I mean they’re darned if they do, darned if they don’t. I mean it’s clear that they don’t have a huge team working on this game since the game failed upon release, so what exactly are you expecting?
---
I mean do whatever you want - not hard to jump on private servers to donate if people want to.
---
I have not, but I hope you got a screenshot, and if so I'd like to see it.
---
Ah, I see another company that hasn't yet learned not to do infrastructure updates at the same time as rolling new code.
---
I once worked at a place that pushed a standard feature update at the same time as a major database architecture update, despite many developers saying it was a potential problem that we'd have no idea which was the source of issues.  Unknown to most of the devs, there was also a hardware rollout during the same downtime.  It was chaos for weeks, and it was something like 24 hours before the war room devs even learned that new hardware (which wasn't working) had been deployed at the same time.
---
It's 200 million cork
---
Little helicopter rotors on the shoulder pads.  A little tail out the back of the helm.
---
...you mean like being able to buy or sell them in 10x or 100x the base amounts? Just like they announced we'd be able to do weeks ago, and like it says in the patch notes now? :P
---
Well, at least we're getting the croc backpack this time
---
I know right? Communicating with the players about maintenance to fix problems. Such bullshit.
---
I got the servers are down for maintenance error code when I tried logging in. Am I banned?
---
Oh jeez. Thanks for sharing. I was hoping to play before work buuuut ill just have to wait until after now.
---
Is it not weird to anyone a world boss, just a single world boss is getting delayed this hard?
---
B-but we need that to open the finest Winery in all of Appalachia!
---
Meat Week better not be Weak Meat
---
Where they the ones I bought her last week?
---
I think the legendary perks are good. It gives more progress to the character after hitting max rank.
---
For me, once I hit max level and have all my perks set up and ready to swap, I have nothing to do in the game. Legendary perks will actually give me a reason to play again, as I will have a substantial reward for continuing to level and play.
---
If they added perk loadouts, cool, but it won't change the lack of content or reasons to play. I would be able to swap to a loadouts to craft. But I'm not crafting since I got no reason to play. I would be able to swap to a loot hunting build. But I don't have a reason to get loot, since I don't need the loot.
---
Is the madness the pissed off people around you that aren't getting any experience?
---
Maybe ward is fighting back against his cement shoes
---
Ward: We’ve instructed Ward to stay put in his trailer, so you should no longer spot him roaming Foundation.
---
I probably have everything on that list, no incentive for me to even donate and they expect to hit 200 million lol.
---
You see i agree in the fact that it’s a small and underfunded team, but this event has been delayed for weeks now before and delayed again. How many passes can we let them have. This is more to waste the keycards i spent saving up for it and because i think BoS didnt need to be added, but ontop of the atlas stuff they delay something again. People do what people wanna do. Me and some others will nuke while some other will donate.
---
I believe it's intended for prime auto to be slightly better than powerful auto. I think I was thrown off by it being one of the few auto-only weapons with a wide array of receiver mods, hence having hardened instead of powerful auto. I think that all single-shot weapons with hardened receivers have the same damage with prime. Like you said, it is missing plenty of mods you would expect, and is only fully automatic, so there are some lapses in logic when it comes to how the mods interact. I'll try to categorize it a bit more thoroughly though
---
Who knows we won’t be able to get on for hours and hours lol
---
Oh shoot yea, Bethesda is in Texas - Ok so that's gonna be 3 or 4 more hours.
---
I'm not a Fallout 1st pay2win player and wont be helping much but good luck, guys.
---
beth couldn't organize a piss up in a brewery
---
Don’t expect to be playing before 11pm earliest I’d say. So with work tomorrow that’s no daily’s for me today.
---
The surprises are the delays
---
As long as they change the points to be level-earned instead of perk-scrap-earned.
---
The VATS registering 95% hit chance but missing over and over and over again until you exit and re-VATS appears to be the most common in the Gauss Shotgun. Even though it's one of my favorite guns I frequently won't even use it because I know I'm going to have to deal with that glitchy VATS bug constantly. It's really really game breaking while trying to use it. Also bugging the same weapon, the bug where you get a good hit on an enemy and it's health drops super low but immediately rubber bands back up to almost full. The two bugs together really hurt that gun.
---
Odd. I use VATS and I was getting railway spikes.
---
GOD DAMMIT I'M SO SAD :(
---
pc why?
---
i was blown away by that upgrade
---
But are you getting millions of cork for free? B)
---
Isn’t that a meat week reward
---
That's the Enclave.  BOS is at least aware enough to not pretend pre-war America wasn't a nightmare even if they are generally medieval.  Enclave might me better than them overall if they considered muties to be people.
---
Preach on. I'm down to still needing either both arms or both legs for the t60, can't remember which. What's odd is I haven't gotten any duplicates on the t60 body parts, or seen anyone selling plans. The need to loosen up the RNG on it, crazy that I have the t65 and am working on strangler heart and I can't get the rest of the t60 plans.
---
I was wondering how Provisions worked. Thanks for sharing this information!
---
There's a reason free Atoms went away when the game launched on GamePass.
---
Hopefully they do x 2 SCORE this weekend for people who'll miss out on their dailies today
---
Exactly the same for me. Sucks
---
K.
---
just throw them and enjoy the fart noises
---
Just download Destroy all Humans, so im gonna give that a go
---
We need MTQGA hats!
---
Well if it ain't fixed one could always build 10 ammo factories at a workshop
---
Also, just put a "&gt;" before a sentence and it will do it.
---
&gt; so it just looks like this
---
as a side note ... it seems that consuming a Nuka-Cola directly from the environment does not yield a cap, so I've always taken them, then consumed them.  how would that "make sense" ?
---
Ah, my Railway rifles were Two Shot and - hell, I forget. Not explosive tho. Perhaps that’s the issue. I have another railway for sale so I’ll pull it out and check. RIP my carry weight.
---
I'm still waiting for the Perk Cards Loadout that was supposedly coming with the Wastelanders update...
---
Hell yeah, don't give us any items except legendaries and plans.
---
Quest is still around, just fallout being fallout. I have the same problem with daily quest for the settler forager ally, I can’t get his quests to activate, but if I delete his chair it will tell me I failed his daily quest
---
I'll just end up on COD probably
---
So there is notbing new? What a waste 
---
So no Collosus event and the same lame rewards we've been getting for more than 6 months now that I can buy for basically nothing in a player machine!
---
I had no chance before 12 am in my time zone, my wife is playing cities skylines and she is building roads for 3 hours already, so no chance
---
Missed what?
---
I make all of them, and run nine constantly on my main 'toon.
---
Marsupial is a game-changer for almost any build, continuously useful both in and out of combat.
---
For the rest, it depends on your build and preferred game-play style.
---
I recommend not messing with mutations at all until you've got level 2 Starched Genes, though, so you can take control of what mutations you do and don't run. And if (as is likely) you find a combination that you want to keep, you'll also want level 3 Class Freak; in terms of points invested, if you're going to have any mutations, then it makes sense to have several and heavily mitigate the bad effects.
---
But the availability of public teams has also made the combined effects of mutations and related perk cards more powerful. For players above, say, level 60, I think you're missing out on a lot of the game if you're not running your own customized set of mutations.
---
Edit: D'oh! You asked about which ones to *sell*, which is a slightly different answer. For that, as noted by Lumpy31 &amp; huangbanana below, Marsupial sells well all the time, and Herb/Carn have become more popular recently.
---
Speed Demon sells well because it's usable for many builds. as is Healing Factor. Twisted Muscles, Talons, and Scaly Skin are only bought by hard-core tanky-melee types. Almost no one ever buys Unstable Isotope or Plague Walker. I'm always surprised how little Chameleon I sell, but it's become less popular as people have turned from weightless to other builds. Since public teams, people *should* be buying Empath and Herd Mentality, which are now awesome, but not many people seem to have gotten the word on that.
---
Honestly would not suprise me. The fact bethesda servers are barley holding on as it is. That they are also now to keep track of the donated material and combine all the info into one number... 
---
Its really a simple thing, but given how much Bethesda have fucked up simple things in the past it would not suprise me if they take the easy way and just make a over-time-moving progressbar.
---
Depending on Maxson BOS behaves, it could be worse than Nathan believing in the Enclave.
---
Glass and leather are pretty easy for me. Not as much as steel but I actually have an easier time getting those than I do wood. Cork’s not too bad either, it’s just in a lot of items most players don’t think to pick up for scrap. Concrete is the only that I don’t come by naturally, but there are some easy concrete spots. Not too concerned missing out on one donation set tho when the others I’ll be doing fine on. As I said, I don’t see this event as me needing as many rewards as I can get. I’m just getting rewarded for not dropping junk I normally would have to.
---
For Criticals use a Shotgun, Each pellet counts.
---
Yeah I read that on the forum and the many other posts trying to be the first
---
For me, that would be midnight... so no play for me. In the morning, I try to sqeeze as many score from 30 minutes as many I can
---
They're shutting the game down because not enough people purchased atoms. See you on ESO
---
If I say I'm 300 I could skip the screenshot part? I mean, it's obvious.
---
Fat People
---
Purgastory
---
I think it's just south of Black Bear Lodge.
---
If we think only about men then your reasonning is flawed. But it gave me a real good laugh thank you.
---
So that keyword flag of "NonPlayerTradeable" I saw means they are character locked.  That's a bummer because now we can't give them to a low lvl character to thin out the loot pool.
---
Haha
---
So let me get this straight... We knew about maintenance days in advance. We got detailed patch notes at the start of the scheduled maintenance. There were SIX follow up messages, and then an update that maintenance would extend longer than expected...
---
and people are complaining that this wasn't "great communication?"
---
Do you main Enhancement?
---
But then you wouldn't have to bother to take your fancy hair brush or gold pocket watch to a bench to scrap
---
I'm using laziness as my excuse. It's nap time.
---
I bought the game on dec 20th 2019 for 15€... how is this a sale???
---
Two weeks.
---
Its been like 6 months without appear
---
List is great for new players, redundant for the rest of the player-base.
---
tomatoes - potatoes - let's call the whole thing off ...
---
well you'll be surprised to hear they haven't added anything
---
Well that list is pretty damn disappointing.
---
Yeah im pissed too, do they not realize college is starting in like 2-3 weeks? Im an engineering major so I likely wont be able to play this update AT ALL until spring break or something. For fuck sake Beth cant do anything right. You'd think they'd learn? Guess not.
---
My basement is flooded right now, very cool.
---
If he's just a regular wendigo colossus, they really aren't that hard to kill.
---
Yeah right ... I'd be surprised if you Brotherhood guys could do fruit punch right. Wine is pretty much out of the question
---
So, no mounted heads? Nice. But, I've already got all of those plans.
---
Dude, there's at least 20 of these types of post per update to this game.
---
You aren't breaking any ground here.
---
Much like War, Bethesda and their game development never changes.
---
I only keep a m79 launcher not cause it’s good just cause of how it looks no good attachable for it either i have crafted and scrapped countless amounts of them just garbage
---
Chicken Coop level !! Is it any good??
---
blame the people who mass-duped the xmas gifts and sold them
---
Literally get the purveyor's weapon... just some malformed shepards crook adorned with the hopes and dreams of so many
---
[edit: forgot /s]
---
Its gonna be under maintenance for a few hours yet they have said
---
Is that a glitch? Why are there so many stags?
---
If a video game makes you that mad, maybe you should quit playing...
---
Not just similar, exact. Unless they added something new at the last second, there wasn't anything new on the PTS in regards to it.
---
In fact, here's the full list https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/edit#gid=0
---
They removed the mounted plans and unique plans, and left all the other crap and apparently made it untradeable.
---
We are still working on a fix for crippling the Scorchbeast Queen, and we are currently targeting Patch 22.
---
Yeah, that's the one. The UnsellableObject flag is what keeps you from selling them to train station vendor bots etc. This also has that flag as well. So enjoy your caps and aid if you've already got all the plans.
---
Bro you really think any working stiff needs or is even aware of your praise? 
---
If i was a Beth employee I'd laugh at threads like this
---
down me all you want. i don't care, they work BAD. it's EVERYTIME ! ALL THE TIME ! 100% !!! and people are "yeah it's normal all is good". d\*mb \*ss. it's crazy, work like that in any other group you will be placed in jail. imagine a motors/cars company / heath or plane that working like that ! it's crazy. totally crazy. but i imagine it's normal because it's a game, not a company, it's not the real world, they don't take real money. not same rules as others.
---
Cool.  I'll have to look for it.
---
ONEPUNCHMAAAAAAAN!
---
Thank you, I for one appreciate this post. :)
---
This event is now a hard pass for me. I'll keep my scrap, they can keep their garbage.
---
just 12 half people
---
Even though the Collosus event has been postponed, im still predicting that red plasticy mining outfit with bow and backpack skin
---
?
---
You're not wrong. That's the only reason the gorillas showed up as workshop companions in Fallout 4 too.
---
those haven't been announced yet, as far as I know.
---
They care enough to downvote you repeatedly for being completely uninformed.
---
It sure does feel like the game was at least 50% made by interns. Except wastelanders was actually pretty good? I just don't know what to think anymore.
---
yup and that is 2 weeks too long, Let's be real, there will be some excuse and we won't play colosal problem till September and anyone who thinks BOS is coming out this year is delusional.
---
You really should be monitoring reddit in case they update though right?
---
When I was low level, I used then for mob tags at events.  Especially the gnashers.  They change to a nice green color so I knew who I got.
---
As a developer, it is really head scratching how their process works. Like are there just overwhelmed junior devs? Are they just overworked? Is there a bunch of business meddling that pushes bug fixing to the back of the line? Is the code base just a giant pile of shit that's impossible to manage? Combo of all four?
---
It really is baffling, any time at my work we've pushed major new bugs live by mistake they get fixed very rapidly but Bethesda seems to just let them linger for weeks.
---
(confused screaming)
---
This is a community event, Bethesda will not allow it to fail as it would imply that the player numbers for the game are so low that it was impossible to do, which would be embarrassing to admit.
---
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever 
---
And then it’s done.
---
Well... this at least frees up a few hundred pounds in my stash.  Unless the fix is making those things weigh a reasonable amount....
---
Wow they somehow made a list that was worse than the Gifts/Pails!
---
With their track record on bungling things, probably some time next year.
---
That's what play testers would be for, if they had any on the payroll.
---
Yeah, that's just sad if its accurate. Some of those plans I have 5 or 6 of, and can't even vendor them for 10 caps. Holy crap. Steel is easy to get, but I'd still be better off making ammo off what I have stashed than to donate to the BOS.
---
Long answer: Never.
---
Short answer: neva.
---
Useless is another word
---
There's whatever the completion reward is if we hit the two hundred million mark, although that looks like it will be mostly/all cosmetic and camp stuff.
---
Expect a free icon at best.
---
Its sad the a company worth hundreds of millions can make a "triple A" game but cant put the effort in to get it to work right
---
Are the plans tradable once you have broken them out of their untradeable rappers?
---
Also: considering the list, who the heck would dupe this set of rewards. Almost everything on this list is purchasable in a vendor.
---
Where in Toxic Valley is this? If you don’t mind me asking
---
I know not everyone is excited but as someone that rps a scavenger due to the fact i can't leave a single piece of junk untouched... I am hyped for this, despite the colossal problem disappoint. The rewards might be meh but it's time to clean out my hoarders stash.
---
August 18, and that is kinda what I was thinking as well
---
So its just weapon mod plans? No rare cosmetics, at least not that I saw? Feels pretty disappointing.
---
Those poor Scribes, they'll tap out on day 1. Their pale, pasty skin will burn right off their frail bodies. And you *know* they're all gonna bring a homemade firestarter they've never used before, but brought it to make themselves look like more of a survivalist.
---
That's the hippy dippy guitar lady?
---
If so, she gives a quest to retrieve a weapon case every 2 days(I think), every one of them so far has been a legendary 3 star, but you do have to interact with her to get the mission.
---
People called in "Skinemax" for a reason.
---
Look like 4 posts below yours.
---
fireflies floating around a camp would be pretty cool
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc963z6Q*TZdUaT-uw-fSESKUMA0DeA
---
Now I miss a set of daily SCORE points because I can't play today and come back from work tomorrow when the dailys reset. Fine thing.
---
I miss all the fun take down animations they had in four. It would be a lot of fun to have some more animations than just doing the Minecraft wave your melee weapon all the time. With that said, get a good DCG or Powerfist and melee is stupidly fun. There's nothing like being in stealth punching the queen in the face and doing thousands of points of damage and having her not even notice you.
---
It's not your fault Bethesda can't be arsed to put effort into their events. :)
---
Interesting good point.  I guess most guns have a pistol grip as the default so you don’t notice it in those cases and the DB is an outlier
---
The plans are the ones in the holiday gifts. Someone already made a post if you scroll down.
---
Same stuff as the presents it seems, minus the mounted heads
---
Oh if this thing launches buggy then idk what to say. You delay it over a month to try and perfect it, and it is still trash
---
(sad shepard's crook noise)
---
They used to do that. Then people QQed about them not being transparent enough.
---
My biggest issue with this is the fact that they devs will be steaming the event during Quakecon. If it isn't playable, why are you going to smack everyone in the face by playing it anyway?
---
Happend to me on NW on Xbox. Could scroll through emotes but not click them and had to leave the game.
---
They have already said at least 2 weeks... so no
---
There's literally no inventive for the majority of the playerbase to even bother.
---
This was the reason I quit playing for the first year. Came back in Nov 19 and was like oh hello. I can store things again. Promptly filled my box in a week and signed up for FO1st and bought another copy of Skyrim while I was at it.
---
Or 4000 but shared between all 4 characters of the same account so maybe the game doesn't feel like it's two fucking decades old. Nvm it's bethesda we are talking about.
---
This is how they work in World of Warcraft's botched Warfront system. The donations are just gold sinks with a side effect of slight rep rewards. The bar is timed to rise regardless of donation efficacy. It will hit the cap whether or not people donate. The donated items are largely meaningless.
---
Just two interns and a janitor. And yes, janitor is the only competed person in there.
---
Even those are lackluster imo. I probably won't throw much at this event because the rewards aren't worth it to me.
---
One thing i hate is being in combat with lag, then coming out of the lag dead from an enemies poison effect. That poison is awful
---
Xb1 here and im starting to really hate the favs wheel
---
Ah, word. Ok
---
HA!!!  I'm glad I didn't get too excited and go running uncloaked into a shit storm of enemies thinking I was invincible.  :D
---
queues up Enya....
---
I've been wondering why the Frag MIRVs are so powerful. This explains it.
---
B- b- but it IS mid afternoon...... *cries softly into hands*
---
All jokes aside I do actually want that paint. I've been wanting a cool stand paint since forever and that solid black is just up my alley. Only 80 atoms to go!
---
Why even add pocketed? Is there some benefit to using regular pocketed compared to deep pocketed?
---
Yep. In NY. Tree fell on a pretty major road and knocked out the power so can't play anyways
---
This was the thing I was looking forward to the most and it’s still being delayed. This is Bethesda, so honestly I’m not even surprised
---
So it’s just the Christmas plans?
---
Lol at people downvoting comments. If you don't suck off this game on this subredditt, you're shunned. Bethesda is just like Rockstar. They only care about people buying atoms and making the game grindy as fuck so people have to log in everyday.
---
On PC same issue above recommended specs.
---
about damn time
---
Oh hell yea. PS4 here and a bloodied player. I can't count how often I got killed by this horrible game freeze
---
right, they already announced meat week was returning despite them making it a junk requirement. So which is it? we need to drop off enough junk or its gonna happen no matter what? Im just amazed they went with such a high number, hopefully with all the duping the goal is met on day 1.
---
honestly, i dont really see a reason to participate when its concrete and cork, the materials are worth more to me than the rewards. ill dump some steel and cloth for caps but thats about it. like, they cant even be fucked to add ONE new thing?
---
Well i was alternating vampire and bloodied at different points on PTS so not strictly true. ;)
---
Thanks❤️
---
Yeah man, same LOL changed it after doing afew SBQ runs. Commando still got better DPS.
---
I'll gladly take your 40mm grenades and missiles
---
There’s an ATX datamine that already has an upgrade for today’s atx item you all are mentioning. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=byDiILrNbM4
---
Meh. I'm saving my scrap.
---
Shhhhsh, don't say the truth here because people don't like to hear it...
---
That’s funny. I was thinking of how well /r/FFXIV handles it as well. All of these others have good answers/reasons but it sure seems to work in FFXIV’s sub.
---
damn synths
---
I'm with this idea in spirit.
---
Send the BoS packing.  We don't want yet another needy, condescending faction in Appalachia.
---
Also, the loot for turning in scrap is horrible.  The same list as the already-duped-to-high-hell holiday presents.
---
So not even a chance at the Croc backpack?  If this is all there is I will save my steel.
---
I will use the ammo converter to turn it into fuel to feed my flamer habit instead.
---
Could've been Sofia's ally mission starting. Idk if you done that quest line yet so that's my guess
---
Nope, just more of the same. Same loot pool as the treasure hunter and holiday gifts, without the unique ones from before (that actually makes it worse than i thought it was going to be) plus they can't be traded.
---
Looks like it. They're also non player tradeable
---
I'm curious what this means for meeting the goal. With the last community event, at least everyone was motivated to participate. Since it seems these goals may only be possible with Fallout 1st scrap hoarders as well as dupers donating much of their stash, I'd be curious if BSG will allow us to "fail" one of the donations if there really isn't an incentive for most people to donate.
---
Some of the costumes and CAMP items were good.  They wouldn't even let us grind for Emergency Protocols.
---
And theres no way of knowing how many of Beth Austin are working on FO76. It could be 20-30, while the rest are helping with Starfield
---
Pretty sure you're banned man. I would definitely write an angry reddit post about it and send in a ticket. Sorry broski lol
---
I throw them at my teammates for fun
---
I still carry around the daisycutter for fun since its light enough plus with the explosion expert and bloodied build it kills most things pretty well and can knock out a behemoth in two shots.
---
Ward: Is now totally invisible or floating 200 feet in the air
---
couldnt you instead just trade the low level character the scrap and let them turn it in for the rewards, instead of trying to trade the reward itself?
---
Your joking! That’s funny as hell lmao
---

Well now I'm feeling pretty pissed.

I don't think there is any other possibility. The management has to be at fault here. For starters, if it was the devs performing this poorly for almost two years, I doubt they would still be on the payroll. Especially with how unfinished and untested some things are, it seems that the devs are just not given the resources they need to do their job
---
Looks like the Dracula boy camp I found at lakeside cabins awhile back. I posted it here but it was mostly ignored. It had a few hundred Dracula boy cardboard cutouts.
---
Very real. I spend at least one day a month grinding on this. That’s all I do for a whole Saturday. So many Bomber Jackets.
---
437 hours as of last night. 100% solo.
---
At the risk of sounding like a shill, i absolutely recommend subscribing to the premium service. The unlimited junk storage is nice, but having the ability to roll private worlds is a titanic qol perk for solo players. You can get the perma 25% bonus xp for being in a group *by yourself.* You can use your private worlds to transfer items to and from your own alts. You can cap and hold every workshop (for huge xp/food/drink/scrap income) without some maladjusted asshole coming to mess with you (they are normally pvp zones).
---
And, should you desire it, you can instantly hop to and from pubbie servers.
---
You also get like 1500 free atom points every month to spend on dumb shit like the legendary run or camp skins.
---
And, if you cant or wont sub to 1st, you can still ignore all the public groups out there and do your own thing solo on a public server. You will just have to occasionally deal with the side effects of the stupidity of other human beings.
---
XB1 also and yeah I can't even use the favorite wheel anymore. It will freeze up completely for 15 seconds or longer, if this is mid combat im toast. Have to open pipboy and manually find em.
---
Seeing how it’s supposed to be scary maybe around Halloween, I’m pretty sure it’s being beta tested right now at least that’s what I’ve seen on YouTube
---
honestly the salt here is getting to be a bit much, chill people. god forbid you play a different game today.
---
I’m extremely unhappy about this one too. I build bases almost daily for people. I really enjoyed ufos my spaceships also required the ability to snap walls and attach roofs to them before placing flooring as the flooring blocked the roofing. This seems like it’s going to kill a major component of building for me. If this went as far as I’m thinking it did. I’ll be done playing this game until they improve the camp system and allow kore freedom. They seem to want to suck the fun out of everything n the game. Terrible move bethesda
---
I've never used the glitch since I never bothered to learn it (only done maybe a dozen silo runs all solo), but i did the run for the first time with another player the other day and it took no fucking time at all. I thought it was supposed to be harder with more people but that was not my experience. I think that people that enjoy nuking aren't going to do it any less honestly.
---
Was this on PC last night? Wife and I were wondering the intent.
---
I tried not to lean into hating on Bethesda too much. But not even a single cosmetic? This is bullshit.
---
The fact I can hit juuuuuust next to them and cause very minimal damage is infuriating.  It's stupid you have to be accurate to get anything done.
---
Ah yes I too like deer meat
---
Thank you very much for taking the time! So, unless they have added some last minute goodies, there is nothing of interest there.
---
'The bull barrel attachment for the .44 revolver is not obtainable in-game, even though the bull barrel is shown [in the Nuclear Winter .44 camouflage](https://imgur.com/CtjvqdU), as well as the recent [responders power armor paint images](https://imgur.com/DhFhNHJ), as if it was in the game. According to dataminers, only parts of the required files for it are in the game.'
---
And it's been this way since day 0... You see the real level here.
---
The crucified abandon hope guy really speaks to me... Shall be my new mascot.
---
&gt;Nuclear Winter: Fixed an issue in which previous limited-time Nuclear Winter Challenges were available and could be still completed past their end-dates.
---
I grinded like fuck to unlock all the challenge rewards that I missed once I realized this bug (which was all of them since I seemed to take breaks at the worst time), and I'm thankful as fuck that I did! The NW beanie and the fur-lined jacket and jeans look so nice together.
---
I'm aware they should be used in vats. If anything, I should be worrying about getting my hits in before other players kill it using other weapons. Which is absurd considering this is supposed to be the creme of the crop, magic aside.
---
*Laughs in the TF2 update schedule*
---
They also mentioned it's taking longer then normal.
---
I've traded my ass off to get a large amount of junk, no chance am I doing this
---
My gear isn't there yet, but true, there are probably a bunch of folks who can still run through the whole thing pretty easily
---
Aye same and the few armor pieces I swap regularly. It helps a lot, I'm maxed on renaming items tho lol
---
The overall rewards seem ok enough for myself to still be involved. Scrapper perk and clearing out blood gang/low level super mutant bases will get steel pretty easily. I'll be doing that while grinding my level ups/repeatable xp challenges. The other scrap will be more difficult and demotivate most (I'm looking at your cork).
---
I'm motivated to help out for the possibility of this double score and xp rewards. I play with a tattoo artist and since lockdown has been eased here he's currently working his arse off trying to accommodate people and this includes late nights. This has led him to be stalling on the legendary run, so if I can do my part to help him here, I will.
---
Perk loadouts, something stupidly easy compared to most of this, would like to have a word with you.
---
I want the case hardened shotgun, but since it doesn't have its own preview icon I assume it's not intended for us (yet)
---
Also wow, now they decide that the communist PA paint would look better in red
---
It's just hard to tell until its over.
---
I've got that and get compliments all the time. Never even realized it wasn't available anymore. No wonder everyone says something.
---
I did but it's still not back up yet.
---
Good effort.
---
my guess would be energy weapons and ammo, kinda like the raider one
---
I feel like the veterans who already have all this stuff should just protest and sit this out. I certainly will. Maybe if the community miserably fails to hit the goals, we can get Bethesda's attention. Probably won't mean anything, but Bethesda needs to know their events are complete shit.
---
Technically speaking the game hasn't had issues with players owning every workshop on the map since launch and Otakushin addressed the issue of who loads what, when &amp; where in a rather elegant manner.
---
I'm sorry but for the time and effort this all takes, I'd rather just say forget it. Which is probably there goal. So cudos to those who take the time and effort to get what they deserve.
---
some have a penis and you dont milk those...................
---
Now when you get to play it again it won't be a good as you anticipated all this time waiting, because that's how that goes.
---
On the contrary, with this list we have advance warning to keep our resources. Cheers!
---
Are silos supposed to be difficult to solo? Recently did my first one and it wasn’t very difficult at all.
---
i would love the cryptids as plushies mainly sheepsquatch and mothman. and they're a pretty big part of the game so it would make sense.
---
I just want them to add hold to block. With the insane lag the servers tend to have this timed parry block system is practically useless for having so many legendary effects dedicated to it.
---
Don’t know if this bug still exists, but there were times I’d not loot the queen and went to my camp and she’d be there blocking entrances 😂

Well if this is accurate I won't donate anything.

I still have my quad explosive one I use in low level areas, reload is loooonnnggg lol
---
Do people like this change? I liked not knowing exactly where Ward would be -- it's more realistic, like he's actually doing different stuff to help Foundation. Plus if you enable the quest, you can follow the indicator to go right to him no matter where he is.

Gooooodbye Ruby Tuesday. Who could hang a name on you. When you change with every new day. Still I'm gonna miss you....

Pain in the ass for me on UK time it’s 19:22 now at this rate I won’t get any time to do my daily score tonight, I’ll be lucky if I can get them all done tomorrow after work before the reset
---
Dude, move your camp. That means your spot is too popular.
---
Yeah, it seems to do a complete reinstall every time, so I have to make sure there's a huge amount of free drive space for every update.
---
What’s wrong with his english?
---
&gt; where server lag is a major issue that caused players to not enjoy the vault
---
Pretty sure we didn't enjoy the vault cause it was a giant scavenger hunt with infinite spawning enemies.

No you can still do that

Grape cures rads but not mutations. Great before you get starched genes.

LOL I love it
---
The idea that a fungus causes them to mimic female cicada behaviour in order to trick other cicadas into coming close enough that it can infect them with the fungus....ARGH! That's just way too creepy.
---
Need to tie these in to those red vines that were taking over the North East...so needs giant Cicadas trying to spread those as a fungus over the rest of the land.
---
For part of the upcoming event, specifically project alpha, we (the community as a whole) have to donate 200 mil cork for the event. We also have to bring like 125-250 mil other junk items to atlas observatory as well.
---
I'm sure it's correct. There's a few posts covering this. It's kinda disappointing
---
(glitch nuke briefcase over from NW)
---
Ad Vi.... (nuke noise)
---
the loot pool isnt unique, its the same as the gifts (minus the mounted plans)
---
All the fixes are in the patch notes.
---
It's fine if you have a team where everyone knows their role and when to switch around.
---
Yes. That could be it.
---
Can I pay in installments?
---
If you want any plans from it.  For xp, I do things solo or sbq
---
They never say when it will be over. But it has been extended....
---
Modding a weapon is painfully slow as well when first loading into a server.

Normal version? I just want the one on the cover of new vegas

Oh you didn't know? Peoples lives gravitate around this game. For as much bitching and complaining done on it, they can't get through the day without it. 
---
FO76 is the 1st game of this franchise I have ever played. I have enjoyed every minute of it. I still am trying to figure out and find these supposedly perfect games out there at release or that people are comparing FO76 to.
---
Well I now know not to give up my good junk and just  glass that I somehow always have 1500+ of
---
Troll's gotsta troll.....
---
Maybe they fixed the incredible low amount of xp which can be gained from the robots during the launch prerperation too? 
---
I usually get 10-20 xp from an lvl 52 gutsy during the launch prerperation...
---
No problem. I knew it was somewhere when I checked this morning haha. But yah, good news is if they are untradeable this should mean that the plans will be harder to dupe. So their value may go up with time. No idea if Bethesda took the time to put better rewards in that loot box. Once can dream
---
Speaking of red vines. I’d love to see those plants be able to grab players.
---
Are there exclusive plans to this event?
---
Participate in any and all events to learn the mechanics and earn event rewards. I recommend at least a shotgun with enforcer perk to tag stuff, this should help you level and "contribute" at larger events like this.
---
I probably will as well. I don't care much for the rewards for hitting 200 million either. I was expecting maybe T-60 plans and BOS paints or something. But no, straight trash.
---
95% of players bought Fallout 1st anyways even before the change so it's not like Bethesda is hurting for cash. The monetized Legendary Run addition wasn't nessasary.
---
If they fix the ability to run Silos I wont farm Queen anymore sadly.
---
just fixed that tho
---
I agree, was hoping for at least a chance at some of the pail plans I missed.
---
Nope, it's really dumb as they've included it in the notes, but it's not out in this patch
---
all exploits should be done at your discretion, if Beth can see who duped pretty sure bethesda can also check and see that you did 30 dailys in an hour
---
That'd be my guess, which would make it pretty powerful in terms of scrapping/ammo point conversion. I'd love something that collected more technical junk occasionally (like stuff with fiber optics or circuitry), but again, I don't know if they'd see that as unbalanced or not.
---
Usually how it goes.
---
If it's beneficial;, it usually gets patched quick (the magic weapons are an outlier) if it's detrimental to players, they ignore it or take forever to fix it, and most of the time end up breaking more when they "fix" it.
---
Thanks I didn’t realize that. That would splain it.
---
That's what I would've thought too
---
The small weekly updates don't take much time, but these big add-ons take a while. It was this long when they added TLR.
---
Bethesda hates fun.
---
thank you!
---
Best bug ever.
---
My Railway Rifle won't starve for such poor rewards.  It's very hungry and will serve me far better than this stuff.
---
Here’s the nice thing - from the name fractured steel after this first round of BoS, it looks like we’ll have the chance to rain on their parade because they screwed up somewhere along the line.
---
We will find and collect all of the things.
---
ALL OF THE THINGS!
---
I have a ton of the resources needed for this “event.”
---
Based on the possible rewards, I will be donating exactly “zero.”
---
Roadmaps are pure PR. Devs arent sticking to them and will cheerfully throw them under the buss the instant they see a need to.
---
~~I am talking about the themed Collectron that's up as a community reward for donating enough cork scrap.~~
---
The fuck? Mid afternoon is a pretty broad brush. I mean, I have kids to neglect.
---
Yeah it just doesn't make sense to me...why take away something fun and interesting that provides depth and doesn't hurt anyone? Strange choice
---
Nobody knows since servers are still down
---
I'm gonna give about 50 of each scrap and call it done somebody has duped junk we ain't even gotta worry that is probably why there is going to be weak rewards
---
Just scrip and a chance for the rare hazmat suit or rad barrel. 
---
It is pretty fun too.
---
Yes you're right.
---
Hoping for the yellow trench coat and hat costume. Think it’s the Vault Tech salesman outfit. I want to be the Humphrey Bogart-ish private eye of the Wasteland. I believe it was on the Atom Shop one time before. Either that or I dreamt it.
---
But what about the Beave ?
---
No clue. Servers offline until mid-afternoon.
---
Hasn’t been available for a very long while
---
The Todd is an idea man. A glorious idyllic being.
---
Idea men delegate the unimportant things like programming and QA to lesser beings.
---
Dense chest mod + strengthened limbs or adamantium skeleton
---
I don't even use fireproof anymore
---
That would be a great addition...even just giving them a little motion every now and then when passing - just enough that you're never quite sure if it moved or not but enough to creep players out.
---
Is she rare? First person who joined my camp. I like her accent.
---
Anymore, I just randomly add 30 to 120 days to any date they give to up my chances of not being disappointed. Bethesda doesn’t have exclusive rights to RNG.
---
Oh
---
What a good boy or girl!
---
It's hard to know the exact time it will end.  It's not as simple as that.
---
I won't be turning in any scrap because these small rewards are garbage
---
Dense and fire proof. You only really need 1 of them.
---
Yep 100% they will complete.  It's just a facade.
---
NPC just raided the suitcases near the vendors where we all routinely dump the plans he wants to reward us with.
---
is this the colossal problem everyone keeps talking about?
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/edit#gid=0
---
Same items from the treasure hunter pails and holiday gifts, minus all the unique items. So basically, they're crap.
---
Sadly it really seems like that. :(
---
I think they'll just autocomplete it if we don't meet it
---
I've tried to avoid the Bethesda hate but this just pushed me over the edge.
---
Kinda happy there aren’t any. I have spent way too many hours collecting gifts and pails in the past trying to collect every damn camp plan lol.
---
Have they said how we can track the current level of shared materials?  During previous "kill x million scorched" event, all we had was a ticker on their web page that was updated once a day at most.
---
The rewards are pretty good... don’t just fight the hordes and actually collect the ore
---
Line in the sand with a tent blocking an entry. Can get upwards of 40000 xp if you have the right gear to drop a small horde quickly.
---
My only question is when the servers are coming out of maintenance. We've just had the Tropical Storm roll through my county at the time of this being posted, and I've been waiting all day to play some 76
---
I just throw them at random enemies during events
---
Just delay this event too, like damn, they already ruined this patch. Delay this and come back with a better list of rewards. This is ridiculous.
---
Well it is when you’re a paying customer, get a grip
---
Thanks, I just tried this and in the main menu now I have 4000 FPS lol, I'll take it over 38 fps. The game is down atm but I'll see how it works without the FPS cap for now.
---
Wow never knew that. I need to look them up.
---
the challenge for the collectron is cloth, not cork. cork is for a double score dailys
---
I have a set and a half of weightless, realized you could really accumulate a ton of it for free in the stash, infinite scrip bank.
---
I'm not thrilled about the extra time either, but for the people who are bitching - have you ever actually worked with computers and software before? There is no way that you can anticipate everything. Unless you've actually been a network or server administrator, you really should shut it, because you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
The real treasure is the apes we found along the way
---
Weeklies come out on Tuesday.
---
PC?  In my experience nukes have pretty much become non existent since games pass released.  I used to catch anywhere from 2 to 6 a day just joining random servers without even playing for hours on end.  The past month that same 2 to 6 figure is the average I still catch......per week now though. 
---
And it's not that people aren't dropping them, I join lots of servers where there is an active nuke zone at either whitespring or fissure prime, but I always get there after it's dropped and done.  I can play for hours and never see anyone launch most days.
---
I've read she's the only one without a fixed spawn point, only random encounters and IIRC only in the forest.
---
still no fix for the disappearing turret bug?
---
Finding him standing through the bunk beds was weird.
---
Mantra of the low skill low hanging fruit programmer.
---
Paint your gear or learn to take a second when scrapping before it costs you big.
---
I lost a BoS jumpsuit scrapping too fast, because the selection thing decided to jump up to the next item instead of dropping down.
---
Many other have lost legendaries and other important items. Its not really a question of IF it will happen, it will happen just hope it doesnt take something important.
---
**HOW LONG ARE THE SERVERS GOING TO BE DOWN!?**
---
I take it you are left leaning in your politics?
---
The event will be completed either way. It's a community event and if it fails it would imply that the player numbers are embarrassingly low. Bethesda can't risk that.
---
Besides, what are they going to do if it fails? The BoS will skip Appalachia and go straight to DC? :D
---
The blue pip-boy from 2018. It went into the vault and hasn’t come back since.
---
They're the ones who need the scrap the most.
---
Someone stole our only router.
---
Trash! The brotherhood can go bugger itself
---
Lmao random redditor that literally knows nothing about the code telling the developers what to do
---
I have done your work for you.  As far as I'm aware, there is only one plan.  It's for radioactive barrels to place in your camp to give yourself radiation to make bloodied easier to attain.
---
The rewards list is instant depression, higher level players are forgotten once again. All of these rewards can be easily purchased at player vendors. Vault 79 plans should be on this list to soften the bullion grind and should be ultra rare drops to give people motivation &amp; hope for something nice. Just seems like you are turning in junk to receive more junk in the end.
---
Here are the nukes and dragons links to 6 of my builds, the shotgun ones arent working as I would like so I havent saved them.

---
Ah, right, thank you, my mistake. I had just checked the thing like ten minutes before but my memory is awful.
---
I still think double SCORE would be nice to give everyone who hasn't finished the board yet a bit of a cushion, but not as nice as a new Collectron-- especially as cloth is *so* much easier to come by with all the pre-war money floating around everywhere.
---
Are the servers going to come back online at any point before Todd Howard turns 86?
---
At least just give us a backpack skin or a camp item that isn't a Collectron or a "banner" that is just the BoS logo mounted to a pole on a tire
---
Scotland, stand proud.
---
All those people with millions of Holiday Gifts loaded with those plans have millions in duped scrap too. The goals are going to be met.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm glad they're taking their time to fix bugs, but I wish they would give us something to do this week other than donate junk
---
Think of the children, Bethesda
---
Sit on that quest until you hit level 50 or later. The reward does not change, but its level does scale.
---
The ultralight swing speed super sledge is a very nice melee weapon. It would be a  shame to waste such a guaranteed roll on a low level weapon youll just end up scripping.
---
My magic Instigating gauss shotgun one shots everything in vats without any damage perks as long as I charge it fully and it hits... But the first shot misses so often, I don't bother and instead use my vampire v33 combat shotgun. Often takes 2 hits to kill but at least it doesn't miss at 95%... Most of the time. Sometimes it still doesn't hit point blank at 95% and I have to exit and enter vats again... Bugthesda :)
---
For anyone wants to know what you get for turning in junk. (basically it's crap and not worth your time, and also apparently they can't be traded)
---
In atom shop I think
---
Or knowing all the Autocomplete issues with the Legendary run It'll autocomplete on the first day...
---
Yup. I love this event. Cripple them, leisurely pick them off with my handmade.
---
They'll likely fake everything and say we met the goals. I for one will not turn in a single piece of junk seeing as the provisions are ass
---
To be honest, the "massive backlash" seems to be you and a few others who keep stating they took time off for a patch for a game that is infamous for missed deadlines and features not releasing on time. As opposed to real mass of people complaining whenever they release a buggy mess that didn't work at launch, or back when they offered no timelines at all.
---
Also, they may not know ahead of time. In the past they've warned us when they had to push things back, so we know they are willing and able to do so when its clear to them. They might bloody well have changed the patch notes this morning when Bob the Programmer message the management and said, "That last fix we tried stopped working when we switched it from Server X to Server Y during last night's test. Pull it."
---
It's also possible that the PR folks didn't find out until much later, because Bob is not on the PR team and only has intermittent contact with them. It is also possible that Bob said he could fix it and failed to do so on time. Don't forget those are people, not faceless corp automatons. Shit happens, and the smaller the team, the more one load of shit splatters over the rest of the project.
---
There is no gain to yanking the rug out from under the feet of people like you who planned around a feature for some reason... unless they noticed a major problem just before release. And while it sucks for you and you have my commiserations, I'd much rather they take the time and try to get it right than push it out and try to patch it amidst the shower of shit that would result if they screwed the pooch.
---
Go off and play with the other children now
---
I actually want to know the stats even if they autocomplete no matter what. It would be hilarious if they couldn't even get over a million. They still would probably pull the same thing all over again though.
---
My family never had enough to eat.
---
You people came to our home and demanded we give you what *you needed.* 
---
We capitulated. We bowed and thanked you- I remember that my little sister even made you fucking monsters a painting as a thank you for keeping us safe from the raiders. 
---
We fed you at our own cost. "Shared" our ammo that we risked our lives for. 
---
When the drought came you people didnt have an ounce of mercy. 
---
My father tried his best to ration our food so we could afford your "Protection". Over time his bitterness grew with watching his family go hungry on our formerly verdant farm. Eventually it was too much, he *stepped out of line* and what did you metal-men do? Gave him 20,000 degrees of crippling light. You "feared for your safety" and you fucking killed him.
---
Wanna know why I carry this Tesla-gun? Its so when I see some tin-can white knight motherfuckers like *your Brotherhood* moving into my home I can turn your fancy powered armor into neon air-frying caskets.

“Yeah guys we are going to delay Colossal problem to patch 21 so we can’t tweak it but we are actually gonna break it more and not tell anyone that we are not releasing it until patch 22.” This is a joke. Never in my life have I seen a professional game studio mess up on a game so many times. I love the game but I hate how time after time bethesda manages to disappoint and anger their fans. Sure, you need more time to make the event playable, ok, that’s fine I guess, but why would you keep it a secret until the day it’s supposed to come out and then say haha actually no, you need to wait a month. Nice bethesda, nice
---
is this a fucking joke? THIS is what we're gonna waste our scrap for? Fuck all that. Not even gonna participate as it's a waste of precious resources.
---
1:2
---
oh wait, was it 2:1? who cares? where is the CONTENT here  
---
Why the maintenance takes so long?
---
Coz they don't know how to CLOSE Colossal Problem : v
---
For XP grinding it’s ok. The best place to grind XP is Whitesprings and only for SentryBot hunting. On Double XP weekend those bad boys were handing me 3000 XP a kill.
---
the score system should just rotate around between  caps -&gt; scrip -&gt; bullion -&gt;  perk -&gt; lunch -&gt; repeat after 100.
---
The duper’s keep their scrap to sell it in the real world for money. It’s the people with fallout 1st who will be a huge help. I have 92k of steel just gathering dust right now. It might take me more then a day to move 4500 pounds though.
---
Considering all the helpful dupers, 100%
---
They’ll be done. I’m kinda disappointed with the rewards for donating stuff honestly though. I thought it was largely meant as end game content yet looking at the lists from the data mine stuff it’s all just....shit. 
---
I thought the idea was to give newer players something to do as well as give old players something to grind when they’ve done everything else. Giving stuff that’s widely already very accessible seems like a weird choice for an event on launch of a new patch...especially a patch where some content has been delayed for the  second time on the day of release with no word beforehand.
---
As a 1st player I have an abundance of stuff, but the thing that will put me off contributing as I otherwise could is 1) there’s not much there to make it worth my while and 2) there’s very little being introduced to make me want to continue being 1st, so why would I spend my resources I have saved when I can continue hoarding and keep my stocks for when I cancel due to lack of any real endgame activity.
---
I’m very well aware that this will be read by a myriad of people with no real clarity of thinking who only operate in extremes, considering any negative/positive opinion is the only way to go, but fuck me you can criticise or praise stuff without thinking it’s all shit/perfect respectively. 
---
It just seems a huge cobbled together clusterfuck of mediocrity you’d expect from a startup, not an established product with a huge base.
---
Disappoinment intensifies
---
(slow clap)
---
Well I found her near the racetrack really early! Access to the well tuned buff is really handy gotta say
---
They are fun if only for the ridiculous explosion that seemingly didn’t kill a thing.
---
Just sell em! At least one person will buy them!
---
I just think it's funny when people refuse to admit their mistakes and double down
---
I do!
---
Although I do consider Monster Mango Loco as my Quantum...
---
Fuckkkk yeahhhhh. Not gonna lie I was really hoping they'd make it where I could just dump everything I didn't want at once. But this is cool too. I can deal with this.
---
&gt; absolutely nothing on this list that you can't find across the map in static spawns or in level three safes
---
All the Raider Armor and the Sturdy and Heavy Metal is exclusive to the Provisions/Pails/Gifts. Only way to get them. Raider Plans did have a very low chance to be rewarded from Signal Strength but you would have to reroll a new character to even attempt it as its a main quest.
---
[EDIT](https://i.imgur.com/sixAd8K.png)
---
Have you seen the "rewards" for donating?  I doubt anyone will even be there to grief with a nuke.
---
Fkn worst drops off those things
---
Wouldn't be surprised
---
It will be in next 1+ weeks. 
---
Doesn’t sound like it will be in patch 22.
---
i do it for the xp specifically.  usually get three or four legendary enemies.  i just tag all the adds and usually can level up ( im level 170) also you get so much to sell to the vendor bots here. i get at least 50 glowing blood each time and a load of weapons and chems. note that level 40 is the max for legendary drops unless im mistaken
---
I bought the plans too, even after knowing I was getting them for free. However, I'll probably never craft them. I've just run out of things I actually want to spend my gold on. Bought out the raiders already. Will finish buying out the settlers this week. Will start buying out Regs next.
---
Sooooon
---
I'm pretty far ahead of zorbo and am dreading having very little to do. I'm already kinda stuck in a 1 bedroom with a computer, on one game - kinda sucks to be stuck in any more ways
---
Releasing a broken game shouldn't excuse them of criticism for failing to fixing that game. The ammo converter should never have even been implemented the way it was, anyone who tried to use it could tell you that immediately. They do not play their own damn game. The fact that it's been 2 years and some of these issues are still persisting with no response from the developers is evidence that the "whining" you're referring to is perfectly valid. I paid $60 with an additional $12 every month for FO1. If they want to continue this "game as a service" model then I will expect the game to be supported with higher standards accordingly. Perhaps that was a mistake as this company and the team behind managing this game do not deserve my money... compared to the service and community interaction from other companies, Bethesda has proven time and time again to be awful at nearly every aspect of it. This is only a continuation of that trend. I don't think it makes me immature to come on here and voice my thoughts about a product.
---
I have a 2 shot mirv fat man I carry around just for fun. It's better at clearing out low level groups, but I mostly use it to blow up cars in parking lots.
---
Someone accidentally pulled off the the duct tape that secured the paperclip that was keeping all of the servers held together, so they're trying to fix that
---
Dude. Let me introduce you to a little "game" called Star Citizen. These delays ain't shit.
---
Yeah you’re probably right...or like another commentor said...could all be for show and we get credit for it even if we don’t complete it. Who knows
---
If they turned the RNG of the plan drop off, and gave us one of the minute number of plans we may not have... then maybe...? Nope! I'll save my 250 steel to make more ammo.
---
Now are they going to allow for you to turn in ALL of the  unwanted ammo that you want at one time (one ammo type at a time) or still have to go back and forth to add
---
Tweet is down now?
---
Yeah this is just my hope though lol, I could be very very wrong, and bethesda could just cuck us. But I remain optimistic.
---
Hey guys, the servers are [still down](https://tenor.com/view/servers-down-for-maintenance-heroes-evolved-manuten). &gt;!Anyone know how!&lt; long?  
---
/s
---
The rest of your life.
---
Someone dropped the wrong table.
---
...
---
I'll see myself out.
---
We all cant be you I work full time
---
If running dense you dint need fireproof
---
Yeah I don't get this. We should be free to build and place things however we want. If we did a survey of all fallout players I don't see a single one supporting this. Nonsense.
---
They should just let you scrap explosives like junk &amp; weapon/armor.
---
No T60?!
---
How come they can talk to you via radio but you cant?
---
It’s undergoing maintenance
---
So they have even less worth than the little they had before. -.-
---
I don’t know... I’ve taken a look at the “winners” and they don’t look great. I doubt they accepted submissions where players had to manipulate the build mechanics to make truely original camps such as ufos. Those are the ones that really stand out but I can’t see bethesda getting behind them at all. My camp is using a build budget glitch and floating survival tent, but it looks more space themed than any of the ones chosen. Didn’t even bother submitting a pic of it.
---
They WERE going to be a huge help. No reason to waste all my scrap on stuff I don’t need..
---
As a new player, this list looks pretty garbage to me. I just started playing a few days ago and I'm level 20 or 21 right now.
---
Literally the only thing on the entire list that even interests me is the guitar sword plan, which I imagine I'll get elsewhere anyway for free or a couple hundred caps max from a player shop.
---
I've never used power armor in any of the fallout games, and this one is no different so far. I get that it's BoS, obviously it's gonna be power armor rewards, so I can't really fault Bethesda for me not being interested. That's just me not being interested in power armor.
---
But still, even if I was interested in power armor, there's very little chance of me getting anything worthwhile from this. The only thing I could really donate 250 of is wood or steel. Everything else is hovering in the 25-50 range, or 100 at most. I could donate a few times and get a plan or two if I'm lucky. Definitely does not outweigh the junk cost for me.
---
Also, with how often I just *find* power armor full of parts laying around, why would I care about crafting my own parts?
---
First on an enemy
---
Let me try something
---
(violently chews gum)
---
didn't work
---
1000 x this! Camp builders keeps getting "shagged" in this game. Come on Bethesda, let's rebuild America together!?  :)
---
just atom shop
---
i would. i couldn't do dailies  for either fashion for a good couple months so i did that exploit to even glitch for glitch. also ward started letting me turn in his crap after loading into each world.
---
They blew up it might take a minute
---
The Twitter link leads to nothing.
---
Thank you Sir, for your explanation. To a Biological Scientist with minimal computer engineering knowledge Bethesda Statement seemed completely alien! This does indeed sound very complicated and explains the delay in release! So would this be to improve stability perhaps?
---
A hamster died.  RIP little buddy.
---
Beth Austin - ZeniMax has multiple openings if any of you are interested.
---
He just made a meme man, that's all. Issa' joke.
---
(more confused screaming)
---
Brilliant 😂
---
23 numbers
---
I would be happy to not get ANY ammo as a reward as its all most all was the type i do not want or use. That or allow us to pick what ammo we get as a reward or maybe ammo points.
---
I had to stop selling items in my vending machine because I bought all the mutation serums and have 10 Assaultron Key cards in my stash.  I tried to sell items at or below list price but there are some items you just can't let go for cheap.  What else can you buy?
---
Lol. I'd rather donate the stuff on this list and get scrap back.
---
What mistake? What are you even talking about?
---
&gt;And do what? 
---
Not support this with your money! If you want to see changes, talk with you money, not words. Words don't have value, only money has when it comes to companies. This acts in your favor, the consumers favor. But all of you just decided to get offended and  ignore that fact. Downvote all you like, it won't change anything.
---
I hate it when the duct tape fails :(
---
Wait you can take it back??
---
its supposed to be Thursdays but they are consistently 5 days late
---
They should really extend the legendary run one day every time they update/maintain.  Or give us free score points for the full day.
---
Ya, I’d think I miss wrote. I missed the fun of playing the game. Not all the bugs and greed.
---
Super fun! I love blowing up cars especially when I'm standing on them.
---
Always with us in spirit ❤️
---
They have to clean up all the excessive Scorchbeast Guano all over the map
---
It would be nice if they allowed the community to have that kind of impact on the games story
---
Don’t know if this is still the case but last year on a live stream he said his character was a buff guy wearing the nuka girl outfit so look out for that
---
Dead link bro
---
100%

\*irradiated

It did, but the tweet has since been deleted
---
Really? I can only see the ones I have access to from a previous membership 🤔 just trying to see what the new cosmetics are before buying again 🙂 I appreciate the reply!
---
Great work on the research but damn is that disappointing
---
Sorry I meant the road that you spawn on. Facing foundation it would be further down the road. It's a bridge i think.
---
you sound smart and interesting! (I wanted to say at least one nice thing on this sub today)
---
Very good. U am smrt

\*Downloads 1.4GB Steam Patch\*

\*says not enough space\* (when I have plenty of space, btw)
---
\*Starts Downloading 8.5GB patch\*
---
Well, this sucks.
---
Why bother compiling these when they never bother to fix them
---
Indeed.
---
Since they are untradeable, unsellable, can't be displayed they certainly should have lower odds of being duped. They could have at least added the scrip reward back into them so we could at least get something worth a damn. 
---
I don't have 1st and am literally constantly overencumbered across several characters and there is still no good reason to give those self righteous pricks my resources.
---
Call me crazy and a conspiracy theorist but doing these events means nothing. By that i mean, the rewards would be given even if there was zero participation. 
---
Think about it, is Bethesda really competent enough to be able to track these numbers? How many scorched we kill? How much cork we donate? Yeah right. They couldn't even release an event that should have been ready to go 2 months ago and will be "ready" more than likely at the end of the month.
---
There's an even better glitch where you can just straight up warp through solid wall and just fly to the launch room. takes about 5 mins to launch a nuke, even less.
---
He has deleted it for some reason
---
The only reason I play is to see other people’s camps and wonder what goes through their heads when I see giant empty buildings floating above the wasteland. It’s quite fascinating from a people watching perspective.
---
Buy somebody a sandwich instead
---
I’m hoping no one donates so I can see what the devs have to say when we are not even close.  Those rewards are such a slap in the face.
---
Well yeah, all bos are noobs, died to the scorched so easily 😋
---
Tweet has been taken down
---
It wasn't at first, the tweet creator has since deleted it.
---
Eh. I have a vampires 33 combat shotgun and it one hit kills in vats everything you stated. Ghouls, mutants, just about everything that isn't a boss or a scorch beast. Zero shotgun damage perks, too. That's why it's magic to me. No mutations at the time either. It was a full health type of build.
---
Eh. Just get someone to hit you with a car, you'll have plenty of time.
---
Any word on if blueprinting the munitions factory ammo generators will be patched soon?
---
**"Chinese Stealth Suit:** The Helmet for the Chinese Stealth Suit no longer incorrectly states that it protects against waterborne diseases."
---
say WHAT goddamnit that's the only reason I've been wearing this thing fuckkk
---
That couch is swank.
---
Yeah!! Like it only takes like and hour or so to do the dailies. So like a rank for every hour we can’t play! It’s like at 5-6 ranks right now! 
---
And 500 atoms each rank!
---
And like 100 lunchboxes!
---
And fucking do my god dam laundry! I fucking smell!
---
And get me laid! Finally! 43 years is long enough.
---
All joking aside wondering the same... as usual have an actual day off... get all my running around done.... get excited to play.... and... nope 🤣 ( for reference I just rented for 8 months in bfe with no wifi, just bought my house and moved in two days ago and this is my first time to be able to play f76 in almost a year)
---
My guy I made this post because I found the situation funny, not to bash Bethesda. Hence why I made a meme about it and not a three paragraph "reeeee Bethesda bad" post
---
What this person said, I'm bloodied build and help everyone else up when the imposter blows up. The armor on my legs take a hit but that's all.
---
Probably because his estimate was unachievable
---
Don't need more than 1 to look good. I'd rather have 1 good uniform rather than the... skin-tight suits you get in BoS. kekw
---
Stop, you're making me moist.
---
I think all the squirrels died.
---
Meanwhile, I still have foundations that I cannot remove even though they're just in the ground by themselves. I'd have to completely remake my CAMP to fix it...
---
Silo runs aren't hard. just time consuming, which is annoying.
---
Cripple that assaultrons legs then whip out the shovel with an evil grin.
---
\*doink\*
---
*I do legit feel a pang of guilt every time i cripple a dog or a wolf. Their whine of pain is too real.*
---
Well with new update looks like bos are returning...not just observing
---
I'm level 53 (I think) and I'd be down for that. Have no microphone to chat with though.
---
Alfonzus is my gt.
---
Someone's night could be someone else's day. It will always be an issue.
---
You say perfect at release but it's been out for like two years now. I didn't play until wastelanders but friends played in Beta and if half what they say is true I'm surprised this game hasn't bankrupted Bethesda.
---
Timezones..
---
[Sorry](https://media.giphy.com/media/KsUKNNUEeryJa/giphy.gif)
---
Data miner here. It's actually even simpler than the other guy implied.
---
One keyword.
---
The issue isn’t owning a workshop, it’s having dozens of workshops attached to a single account. The game has had serious issues with logins since the beginning and there’s a reason Bethesda hasn’t increased our camp budgets for a long time. The idea that they can’t increase camp budget but could take workshops (which already have larger budgets) and load in all of those at once easily would fly in the face of what they’ve been claiming for the past 2 years.
---
I’m not sure what you’re expecting me to say here?
---
My response was directly to Otakushin’s idea and why that it is simple on paper but runs into multiple issues once implemented.
---
Say a server host leaves and all his workshops despawn. Ok, now anyone can claim them. How? Do they have to rebuild from scratch? Will doing that overwrite the camp they had previously created on their own server? Ppl want to build intricate workshops because of the larger budget. If you share a build and the workshop owner logs off what you helped create is now gone. And if he gets kicked from the game, it isn’t as simple as logging back in because now that workshop isn’t his. So he will have to start a new private server and reinvite everyone instead of just rejoining his world. There’s a reason that no other building game like ARK, Minecraft, Rust, attaches your build to your character. They are directly tied to the server because there are dozens of algorithms and potential bugs that aren’t as simple as saying “it’s easy.” All of those problems aren’t necessary by just having a dedicated server.
---
Just helping out OP. Sorry for offending you.
---
Chally the Moo-moo glitches into underworld, and grahm chases after, throughout meat week
---
They're gonna need at least another 8 weeks for that.
---
Sounds about right. Why would they deny us the chance for us tl get actual content and stick to the game
---
You know, if you just focus on the rewards and not the story &amp; characters, it's likely that nothing's ever going to please you tbh.
---
That's why you nuke ATLAS as the enclave!
---
Yeah, the global community is in full support of your idea 🤔
---
yeah, you're probably right.
---
When you get them to spawn in the center yeah.
---
In an alternate universe you’d call bethesda a joke for releasing it too early instead of delaying.
---
I have had it where I have been loaded into servers that say my camp can't be placed, yet nothing is there. Had it happen 5 times yesterday alone.
---
No camp plans or cosmetics or anything? Christ that's awful.
---
International community my dude!
---
Literally have nearly all that list 😭. I'll see how donations start before I start offloading my 20k cork
---
You realise it's always daytime somewhere in the world don't you?
---
And that people have to be awake to apply the updates and test it etc?
---
Sorry you haven’t been laid in that long of a time span....
---
Sad that the Nuka Quantum Grenade doesn't seem to fit your criteria, because judging from its pathetic radius, I'd argue it definitely is broken, and that's an issue enough for me.
---
Timezones... World doesn't revolve around you.
---
Everyone knows floating walls cause all the other problems in the game and in real life. Floating walls are the cause of covid 19, income inequality, global warming, racism, corruption, the gays, arthritis, and was most likely what killed the dinosaurs
---
hmm... if it requires ground (dirt?) maybe the dirt tiles?
---
I just rename the chassis
---
So basically they didn’t include any plans or items I don’t already have... cool
---
Not on a second floor, but if you want to put them on foundations on a ground floor, just do this: build the prefab, destroy it with a flamethrower trap, then build the foundations where you want, and repair the prefab.
---
They should do planned downtime when most of America is sleeping.
---
Players - don't initiate new events if there are bugs. 
---
Bethesda - there are bugs so we won't initiate the new event. 
---
Players - I want my new event even with bugs.
---
Rock &gt;&lt; Hard Place
---
Colossal Problem still not up? What the fuck are you even doing over there in Austin, seriously?
---
Something of utter importance to keep the system functional and have to be physically fixed, such as an espresso machine.
---
Guys I can't log in did they get doxxed?
---
It's funny to see this post right next to the posts whining about colossal problem being delayed... I'm on your side of it release a working update so I don't waste game time on it
---
0/10 is my rating for the patch.  Missed the opportunity to name the event "A coalossal problem"
---
It's a game. Take some perspective.
---
Probably had to upload a new holotape into a signal repeater up on a hill somewhere, and the interns kept getting shot by Protectrons.
---
Yeah I don't have first, and don't have a bunch of junk stashed up. I also don't have a lot of time in game anymore. After seeing the reward list I won't be giving them anything
---
Most people play from North America. Should happen when most of them are sleeping.
---
Finally, an outfit that can go with my plague doctor set
---
The world is flat obviously so we all have the same timezones it's an indisputable fact!
---
I do too but I'd still like visual representation, small non priority thing but it would look nicer.
---
It's literally free stuff.
---
God I try that but FO4 doesn't run on Xbox. Mods/no mods, doesn't matter. Crash city. 76 actually runs really well for me.
---
Bloodied weapons deal less damage the lower your health is.
---
Unyielding armor reduces your SPECIAL stats.
---
5mm rounds now weigh 5lbs each.
---
The Scorchbeast Queen spawns at Vault 76.
---
Radiation gives SCORE.
---
Timezones are a liberal con job to support the Round Earth hoax.
---
Sorry, pal, you're getting downvoted since these re(tards)dditors don't quite seem to understand that Bethesda doesn't care about them :D \*grabs popcorn\*
---
As I already commented on another post - my 250 steel will be going towards making more ammo and weapon/armour repairs!
---
wahhh wahhhhh
---
I'm in UK and it's nearly 8pm here, prime gaming time being lost after working all day out in the rain.
---
So maybe they should do it while Europe is sleeping.
---
Oh boy can I get free fallout 1st for my troubles!!!
---
Don't tell me the provisions give fucking mounted heads.
---
I regularly get that message, and fair enough my spot is popular, but 2 out of 3 spawns the spots not occupied at all, as I discovered when I just went ahead without my camp.  
---
I'm up the road from the Wayward, just opposite Slocums
---
One thing for certain is I'm not stupid enough to be cheering for junk fences.  It's a fucking Fallout 4 item that already exists in 76 and they're making you pay Atoms for it, lol.
---
Should know be converted to a throwable with how little dmg it does
---
Ikr....Is this update ever gonna finish? Looks like some ppl I know are in game Rn. In pst still maintenance Oof...lol
---
Good for killing underground gouls and not much else. Definitely annoying.
---
I only just realized that if you have already entered the codes into a silo for the week you don’t have to re-enter them on a second launch. Level 423 but kinda new to the end game grind.
---
&gt;The event will be completed either way. It's a community event and if it fails it would imply that the player numbers are embarrassingly low. Bethesda can't risk that.
---
Even so, I would be satisfied in a round-about way if I knew that Bethesda had to pump their own numbers artificially due to their complete negligence in designing a realistic event. It would be yet another major sign of proof from Bethesda that they don't care about their playerbase.
---
During Meat Week, Ward randomly glitches through Chally.
---
Honestly, they should have added T-60 Power Armor plans to the drop tables, since those are the ones that many are struggling to find.
---
My bad. Just kinda tired of seeing all the needless bashing. Apologies for that.
---
But it’s not what I want so it’s bad obviously
---
How do you know this?
---
(fasnacht music in distance)
---
Here's a prime example of a flat-earther
---
The outdoor cinema that is a settlement/ workshop. I've forgotten the name but it's perfect for building
---
American gaming company, more Americans play. Therefore it makes sense while America sleeps to do it.
---
Who knows when it comes to Bethesda's ability to track these numbers, but failing to meet the milestones would speak poorly in terms of showing a large and active community (despite any potential lackluster numbers being solely a result of lackluster motivation) and would create *extreme* outrage in the fanbase. I reckon even worse than the shitshow when Fasnacht was late, because FOMO would hit *hard*.
---
Based on previous experience
---
All collectrons collect different things, they are not just reskinned versions. So I wonder what the BOS version do.
---
Be glad - it's still a really bad system with really bad perk cards.
---
Whatever was in the holiday gifts. So, nothing rare.
---
It doesn't even matter, they'll inflate the numbers and we'll get all the rewards. It's a ruse, the illusion of content.
---
I’ll remain to try and do my dailies as fast as possible and log out.
---
Yeah I agree. Screw the development team and support staff, make 'em work all night seeing as they aren't human beings with families and lives. Playing a game is way more important!
---
Wait? Is that it? No crazy never gonna get plans?
---
Server updates and maintenance requires people to run the services and also be available for troubleshooting. If devs run them at night, they have to change shifts for the week or pay overtime. If something goes wrong overnight, there's a chance the personnel needed to address it are sleeping. Same reasoning why updates release during the week and not the weekend. 
---
It's also important to realize that games with a global online playerbase don't have a "best" time to update. Generally European, Japanese, or American players are online at different times.
---
Has anyone figured out yet if any junk you have displayed auto-scraps?  I read that like it will.  If so, that is ridiculous.  I have a cool display with the Dog Helmet and Flight Data Recorder and I know the Dog Helmet is impossible to obtain now.
---
I don't really care in my opinion. It's free stuff. I think a lot of people are starting to get entitled
---
People not participating because they're pissed off that they're personally not getting anything out of it and making the rest of the community work for the rewards are selfish.
---
Without Fallout 1st, where do you put all the junk if it don't fit in the trunk?
---
I thought you were just joking before, but you're serious aren't you?
---
When a bow locks you out of interacting with the world (can't pick up items) and from using the Pip-Boy, a faster way to get everything back in order is to aim down the sight with your bow equipped. Might take one or two clicks but it works 100% of the time in my experience, at least on PS4.
---
Cheers from 160 hours of bow usage/struggles.
---
They forgot to feed the hamsters for their servers, so now they're driving to the pet store to get new ones.
---
I wouldn't bet on devs fixing anything pvp related; NW is still "beta" after all :/
---
Your build is ok against other pve players, but any pvp-oriented player will decimate you (think optimal weapons and armor only available through trading or extreme grind, legacies, full dmg perks, chems, quantums, stealthboys, etc + sheer experience and a will to die over and over). I don't mean to sound, well, mean, it is just what it is. There is certainly a niche enjoyment to be found, but the road towards it is quite difficult.
---
In this context its understandable tho? Deadass
---
Stop. Just stop. Stop trying to control people and what they do, because You've gotten so fucked up and bent over a game. 
---
It's a game. you either enjoy it or don't. And before you pull out the, I've been playing...you must like...my money lines.
---
I've been playing since launch. I've experienced the same bugs. My money is just the same as yours.   
---
Seriously. I'm fucking sick and tired of posts like this. You have insurmountable issues with the game. I get it. Move on. There's better games.
---
I work full time and have 220 backed up.
---
If I'd of done the raid before fastnut id be swimming in notes!
---
Bethesdas inability to control Ward concerns me
---
I definitely won't be donating a single thing. There is no reason to. Especially when there is no new plans/rewards from the provisions that you can get.
---
Copy/paste from my comment from other post: "Even if it is fun to think that we actually can work together and achieve something, this is not how the community events like this work. Not once over 20 years of playing online games (all the successful ones) have i seen any such event fail. You know why? They won't spent money and time planning, designing and putting out events just to say "sorry you didn't donate enough of the resources needed, no rewards for you". If it looks like people are not donating enough, they will just say we did, and give out the rewards. It still accomplishes the same thing, which is to give players a common goal to work towards as an community. And of course drain out huge amounts of resources (be that currency or materials) out of the game to help economy."
---
Thx bughesda, but i will keep my scrap.
---
Bruh, just spend 15 minutes making 100 throwing knives then sell them for 1 cap each.
---
Mo, money
---
MO, money!
---
Infinity Ward performs updates / maintenance for Modern Warfare through midnight PST to avoid this issue.
---
100% agree. We ought to be able to at least sell them.  Tired of them weighing me down.
---
I'm hoping since he is instanced it won't be like sbq at launch. If that alleviates some of the server load it will be awesome.
---
Still have a soft spot for the sbq fight though. Lol
---
Some servers still struggle with the sbq, just depends on how many players have good or broken builds.
---
The last fight I did on my level 30, we were down to the last 5 minutes, and I ended up level 33 by the end. Lol
---
Honestly, if it takes them time to actually get it right I'm for it. If it works well upon release then I'll be happy with the wait. They already improved greatly upon legendary perks, the new ones are very well done. I will only have a problem if it has several major bugs involved, which means that the extra time was not spent well.
---
Aren’t they running AWS EC2 instances or something dynamic in the cloud.  Build a new master image, test it, kick everyone off, shut down servers, deploy new image, reboot servers, make sure the individual servers are reporting in correctly to cluster master, have someone test on a special provisioned account to see if it works, remove the flood gate
---
thats why they get paid below military salaries and lose their money going to college.
---
Broski, I am sorry. Your luck sounds like mine.
---
it's free with a purchse of fallout 1st
---
"but then it's not free"
---
(Todd face)
---
"dammit..."
---
Shit man the amount of people acting like I’ve shot their dog or something on a post about it not really being on delaying the day of release is ludicrous 🤣
---
I’ve suggested this before but it’s be more worth it with the current system if perks like Ammo smith and super duper got you more points and/or ammo but nope.
---
Guys are the servers down? When did that happen?
---
Low lifers also have serendipity to straight up have a 45% to not take the damage in the first place.
---
Damn dirty APES!
---
Aside from giving me something to do in game, I'll participate for the goal rewards.  The collectron and purveyor sale have me interested.
---
Just about everything, yes.
---
I'm on PS4 aswell :) my username is my same on here if ya ever wanna add
---
I wouldn’t call this sub incredibly toxic but to each their own and all that
---
try /r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Are you guys having server problems? I can't get on and there's absolutely no reason for it
---
Yeah, T-60 would be nice. As well as the super rare melee mod plans you can only get from events. Same with the mire and bog healing salves and top-tier ultracite power armor mod plans (shocks, protocols, targeting hud, tesla, etc)
---
I will say the list has definitely made me not want to waste my resources on it at all. Bethesda calls these rare? They are clueless about their own game.
---
I didnt mind him moving around so much as finding him stuck inside some girders at foundation and the only way to talk to him is to awkwardly jump onto a beam, click on his exposed head, and listening to "Finally..."
---
I love Nuka-Cola shit in-game (to the extent I made my F76 character a proper Nuka head) but I hate cola in real life. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I'm going to say 8-16. With no proper head developer. And an art department of about 4. With a community team of 2, I think?
---
I say 8-16 because of the studio size. No doubt that due to the scrutiny of this project, the team has been shattered from the original size. It's more than likely passed on to newer devs at the studio because all hands that have worked on it were tired of being belittled or related to a "failed" project by media. These devs most likely aren't industry pros but it's no reason to treat them like dogshit. They also more than likely handle bug reports as well as content development, and they definitely do this under crunch.
---
I say no proper lead developer because it's just apparent. The game takes wild turns from month to month, but by the looks of recent patches someone has taken to actually leading the team. I've heard that upper management at Bethesda sorta sucks! Which is really disheartening to hear with all this fighting for developer rights and stuff, people continue to shit on people who already get shit on enough.
---
And I'm thinking an art team of 4 is about right. This may be a very flexible number and it may overlap with the dev team. Assets like the ones you see in the Atom Shop are mostly just costume flips and pre-existing assets that are reskinned. This of course isn't a bad thing, but it means that between big batches of Atom shop content they can pump out a huge bundle in a matter of weeks. It's why the Atom shop is always adding new stuff. It was already made and done months ago. Don't act like they're simply ignoring the problems because they're simply prepared.
---
Needless to say, it's more than likely a very small team. And while it's easy to sit around bashing people you'll never have to face, as is the history of the internet. You have to remember we're currently in a time where dev work is treated like a low-effort high-paying job that directly profits from the MTX y'all hate ***SO MUCH.*** When in reality, the devs see a fraction of those profits, if any at all, which are usually piped to other projects, they work long hours under immense pressure to create content for a game that the media is demanding be considered a failure. Not to mention they are no doubt working from home right now, and that's a huge challenge even for Bungie as they work on Destiny 2. I have no reason to believe that Bethesda is nearly as prepped as Bungie was.
---
Also, I'm gonna be real with you guys, they don't interact with you for a reason. I'm surprised some of the community managers even dare show their faces here. Y'all constantly talk ill of the team still creating a game you actively play enough to be upset about. It could have just died at launch with all that petty pre-order nonsense but here we are with a big expansion under our belts and more content to come. I swear some of y'all just get mad to be mad.
---
This game has come SO FAR and I'm incredibly proud of the team left with this project. The adversity has no doubt been incredibly rough to work with but they've created one of my favorite MMO games of all time. The in-game community is the most diverse and unique playerbase I've ever interacted with and I love the adventures I've shared with them. I cannot wait to see what we have in store for us after this roadmap.
---
All of them :/ i switched yesterday from beth to steam (deleted beth fallout 76 after successfull change with my chars) and wanted to unlock them... but i dont get any of them (leave the vault shouldnt be the problem but even that doesnt count) i played until morgentown but i dont get any achievement :/
---
Wait, what? No more cool floating blocks? Boo, Bethesda, boo!
---
100?  I have over 1100 treasury notes... it's brutal!
---
Well, I'm a bit more timid and I honestly think the storage shouldn't be completely unlimited, but the bottomless scrap box that FO1st has could be free for everyone, that I agree with completely.
---
They could have had:
---
Legendary modules,
---
T60 plans,
---
Flux,
---
Scrip,
---
Bos outfits,
---
Bos plans.
---
But they make the reward list, the shittest so far.
---
No but I have whistled the theme from Fistful of Dollars
---
There is. It's a blue ridge reskin. Nothing else unique to it.
---
Ima just nuke myself after reading the rewards we get for donating scrap
---
Right. I think some people want it to fail to get back a Bethesda.
---
Reddit and in-game are different things, in my experience.  Don't take today as an indication of what its usually like around here, either.  People aren't getting their usual fix, and they're starting to go through withdrawals.
---
I'm returning to Fallout 1 because it runs way smoother than this game.
---
Not really, America alone accounts for almost 55% of total atom shop sales. It would make sense to do down time while other parts of the world sleep
---
I don't know why I let myself get excited for anything they put out now. It's always disappointment.
---
It's obvious though that they're letting these become available for the people that have joined from Game Pass.
---
Nothing new, because fuck rewarding the people actually paid money for your shitty game right?
---
Boring
---
Yeah well I mean I can see the fun in making a PvP build and playing it but that's only if I were to fight players who actually want to fight, as if they don't I really can't see any fun being had as you will just kill them and they will simply leave.
---
As I said a few times now it just felt wrong to me to have a specific rule that nerfs one certain type of weapon to be absolutely useless, when the same kind of thing is still possible with others.
---
And yeah I don't have hope that they'll do much for the PvP any time soon but I still hope they'll at least get an anti-cheat for NW so those who just want to PvP can do that in peace as well.
---
I think that’s why they delayed his launch. They probably wanted to see if there were any bugs with the event before there was any concern with server load. Hopefully that goes well. 
---
SBQ is fun but it’s just in a weird place and there are so many little things like the crippling bug where someone who doesn’t know wha they’re doing can make the event last the fully 30 while there can be a team of a few players in a private server who a literate her in seconds. And none of this is based on the skill of the player or how many hours they devoted to the game. I kinda hope one of these patches will release an evolved SBQ or something that takes the current style of her boss fight and just polish it till it can be an enjoyable and challenging boss battle.
---
Nope completed Dagaurres main story and my level 138 character got a lvl 20 weapon.
---
No... it isn't, he is clearly stating he doesn't like to speak to people "solo" doesn't mean solo anymore, why do people even comment dumb negative shit assuming people are asking for attention isn't it like me saying the people who type negative shit nobodys asks for are begging for attention too? Parents not love you enough? Maybe but either way shut up.
---
Love ghillie camo on my armor, as soon as i crouch all that camo stucks in air :D  It really feels like fo76 devs are crippled and are forced by the boss to make broken/glichy stuff
---
IMO reskins are super annoying. How many variations of the ranger outfit did first members get, as well as that god awful splattered paint for our armour, when I would say more people wear outfits than have their armour showing. Yes I know beth doesn’t HAVE to give us free shit, but I mean, put a little effort in considering this game has been quite the clusterfuck. Also, donating my scrap for plans I already know. Eh, I won’t be participating.
---
Yeah. I came from TES Online and the account-wide bank (storage) is what I miss to be honest.
---
Just killed a low level player with an acid floater grenade while I was in pacifist mode at the light house the other day.
---
Im so sorry dude
---
All I ever really wanted from a multiplayer Fallout was to be someone's companion in FO4. I didn't even care if my actions had any impact on the other player's story, don't let me fight essential NPCs or whatever, just let me follow them, fight stuff, build... That was the dream.
---
Whatever
---
Lock breaker perk, 3 ranks, break level one locks with gunfire or strikes. Level 2 less shots or strikes required to break the lock. Rank 3 bashing damage opens all locks.
---
No it's not just today, it's what I've seen and experienced over the past few weeks :/ alot of ego and hate DMs
---
Bethesda's mentioned before that they crippling the queen will no longer be a thing, too many people abused it with melee builds killing her in 3 seconds.
---
Never mind that even if we assume all 100 are focused solely on 76, of those 100, some of them are art specialists (Sound, music, skins, skeletons for said skins), which means they can't do shit about programming issues (which is why ATX keeps getting shit nonstop and regardless of patch woes). Also, some of them are also going to be working on future content (BoS return, interior cells), some are going to be management, some are going to be PR/HR. Out of the 100, I would guess (very guess here, probably not accurate) maybe 50-60 are actual programmers, and out of that maybe 20 for current, 20 for near future, 10 for distant, and 10 to coordinate ("No, Bobby, you can't change itembititgrmap=x, that fucks with the entire item catalogue \*and\* the stuff team 3 is working on"). Sounds like a huge team, until you realize just how complex programming this shit is. There is a reason (good) story mods in FO4 are uncommon, it gets complex very quickly. 
---
And again, this assumes 76 is there sole focus. With additional projects under the same house, I would not be surprised if there are maybe 5 actual programmers working on additions to 76's code, in total, not just bugfixing the current patch.
---
Then, there is the problem with priorities.  As an online game, they need to have content in the pipeline at all times, which means you don't shuffle teams and cram everyone into a single patch. You need progress on several fronts. Further, you can't just slap a fresh team into a current project and expect solutions, because they don't know what's gone into said content. It's a lot harder to bugfix code you don't know than code you wrote.
---
And finally, as others mentioned, there is management. Even mediocre managers could fuck something like this, a small team with a big engine, never mind bad ones.
---
Welp the fallout 76 community is going to hell in a handbasket, its exactly the same as when I stopped playing
---
Every game has flaws. None are perfect at release or even after. Can't name one that has. Injust find it funny people complain this much about a game. If they aren't happy with it, move on to one they enjoy. That easy.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I can only think those camp building tweaks will be overtuned and will turn out as an inability to build anything that is not a minecraft square box.
---
T65 lamp won't work at all now and the legendary run skin for it won't apply or they broke jetpack.
---
Do you guys have an idea for how long the severs are going to be down for?
---
I had already planned to not participate. I think a massive resource sink is dumb and pointlessly grindy and is just designed to empty out peoples' stashes.
---
Also: My scrap. MINE! MY PRECIOUSSSS.
---
Also also, none of the rewards interest me. I wouldn't mind another double SCORE weekend, and maybe that BoS Collectron would be interesting, but... meh. Maybe if they make the donations part of the daily/weekly SCORE challenges I'll care.
---
Also also also: The Brotherhood of Steel is lame. All glory to The Brotherhood of Spirits, and our leader Biv.
---
I would add that the gauss weapons in general are very wonky in vats, so is the bow and compound bow.
---
Unyielding armor stops working. (again)
---
😱
---
Wish I could help but I played on Steam right from the start, maybe it has something to do with switching over but I don't see why that should matter for a new character if you're launching the game through Steam.
---
WhaTEvEr :(
---
I just came across the post with the spreadsheet. Still need many of the arms and legs and such, but with a .17% I'm not motivated to turn in anything.
---
He's a orangutan ma
---
Edit, really hope somebody gets it haha
---
That's my game too, that and turn in 150 scrip from the dozens of 3* weapons clogging my stash, and selling 1400 caps worth or crap to the robots, and 200 bullion then I'm out.
---
Why do you think that?
---
Sons and daughters of the Free States, let's become Raiders and steal all the cork scrap! Let's use them to make a nukashine cannon!
---
Sure :) my PS username is the same as this one
---
You expected something amazing?
---
I have 92k of steel in my scrap box. You don’t need to participate.
---
I just noticed You weren’t even the guy I replied to originally. Wtf, lol.
---
Hahahaha, kinda takes the wind out of your sails, I pictured almost the same scenario when I read your OP. They are pretty good at getting up and running again if you compare to other MMOs, Zeni should have it goin soon. 🤙
---
We do not talk about these features!
---
Better watch out before you lose your internet privileges for a week again! You know your mom doesn’t trust Reddit!
---
but head here to check out the patch notes
---
Bro you do realize the event was supposed to come out today right?. There is literally nothing to do in this game anymore... oh yeah let’s nuke the queen for the 105th time, do the same daily’s and events over and over... I don’t see why people aren’t bitching
---
Level 450 here. I'm not giving them shit.
---
Yowza!
---
It's your prerogative if you want to donate to the event, I'm more or less just pointing out to people that Bethesda once again doesn't give a shit about its playerbase. Be mad all you want, I don't really care.
---
Did the rest of the world get the game at a discount?
---
A friend and I were both playing on the same server and we found him stuck through a chair where they play music, he was talking to Wards head and I was talking to Wards ass at the same time and we both got different missions.  I've always had to wait for him to finish with one character before i've been able to speak to him before.
---
There's stuff from 76 I miss when playing Fo4.   
---
Like getting new schematics. I know a lot of folks see the plans/recipes system as nothing but a chore, but it's still a progress tree. I enjoy having something else to aim for and work towards, and get a sense of satisfaction when I can build my *new* things or cook a *fancy* dinner.    
---
Automatically knowing all the mods for your gun because you took a perk just doesn't feel right anymore.
---
They're going to complete whether we donate or not, which is why I won't. The provisions are terrible and not worth my scrap. This update sucks apart from adrenaline being fixed. 
---
Think about that, a nearly month long bug being fixed is the highlight of a major patch.
---
Soon as they remove some of that duct tape making them overheat.
---
Yeah, but it's still better than keeping everything in a small stash, you'll literally have no place for anything else besides scrap or you'll have to manage it super well and not everyone can do that. I own FO1st exactly for that reason, I'm a hoarder of junk and I love crafting and changing my camp. It feels a bit forced tho. I get why people complain that the scrap box should be free for everyone
---
I feel like the minority for using the 40mm grenade launcher but I have a triple legendary one and I just like making things go boom lol. 
---
Really helps get the hit points during scorched earth. A few Nuka cranberries and 40mm grenades later and I’ve damaged most of the enemies in the area and gained a ton of xp so I can level up every day for this ridiculous grind.
---
FO1 could crash and you might not notice for 20 minutes or so. Perfectly normal delay. :)
---
New hamsters
---
Alot of the people that I'm talking about are also a part of that, but ig I'll try it
---
God dangit! Sure, floating camps are no fun. But the building system is irretating enough. I just want to be able to build the way i want. Soon there Will be nothing but 20 squere boxes around The map
---
Lol, I just decided to jump all up in the middle of your conversation. For real though, that spot is gold.
---
I'd like to go to bed early today, hope it doesn't last too long or I'll potentially miss a day
---
Does this work with the STEAM version of Fallout ?
---
I had been told I should incorporate adrenaline into my build, so I did, but found no noticeable effect. I assumed the person was just screwing with me until I realized that the perk was broken. Now I can finally work it into my build again.
---
You've just contradicted yourself.
---
I'm 25 and renting a place .... but nice try, toxic lil rat lmao
---
I may be the only person who loves that fucking ugly paint job 😂
---
Another update fairly soon to say maintenance is still ongoing and will update fairly soon and so on.
---
Yes. For ages. It's one of my top three weapons I use.
---
How?
---
It would be nice to get a collectron without atoms
---
Well it's not about who has more, its the fact itself that they're just laying there with no use. I do my routine by buying gold every day but they're just adding up more xD
---
This is fine.
---
You can “milk” every Brahmin, but you might not get actual milk in return
---
Yeah they really didn't think about this one. 
---
The people that benefit most from the provisions (newer players) probably don't have the resources to spare.
---
The people that have the resources to spare (veterans) don't benefit from the provisions.
---
Its rlly sad. I was looking forward to this update, because there was SUPPOSEA to be a lot of new things to chase. My suprise when beth pulled the lol not rlly bro.
---
Personally I use them for majority of goofy moments in the game. Or just at that one bad player 1shoting legendary after other player does follow me emote.
---
Be honest you find the fart grenades entertaining.
---
*It would make sense to do down time while other parts of the world sleep*
---
Don't waste your breath this guy gets a kick out of being a massive tramp on this forum like I'm toxic too but this guy is something else.
---
Donated scrap not registering
---
I copied this post to the official boards for further viewing. 
---
TY for the data. Hard pass for me as well.

---
They don't even have all the power armor plans, 
---
Like if you could use this for a chance to get those super rare ultracite power armor plans then it might be doable because grinding 1000 steel is easier than killing 40 queens (assuming similar low drop rates)
---
But you don't even get T-60 plans, and half the power armor plans you should be able to get are broken.
---
I'm so sorry mate its xbox 1
---
They can get you laid, but as usual it will be full of bugs
---
I like you.
---
I just wish people could lighten up a little - it is just a game.  And honestly, our lives could be so much worse.
---
But I admit, while I hate trolls, I can't resist low hanging fruit trolling if its intent is mild fun.
---
The only thing I was gonna do with the provisions anyway was drop them to low level players.
---
Can't even do that soo...my scrap stays in my scrapbox I guess 🤷
---
He’s entitled. That’s what you mean.
---
&gt;I think the Shielded Raider is worth 2500 just because the plan is so rare
---
I understand that they are apparently rare, I craft and sell them in my vendor for 1200, and they don't move at all that fast.
---
I actually have enough atoms saved up from FO 1st that I could buy my way to the end right now. Seriously considering it just to be done with it.
---
Today is Tuesday.
---
At this point I’ll take it!
---
The game didn't flop financially. It took a critical beatdown, and was not the bug fuck success of FO4, but it did fairly well.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/aba3cz/a\_look\_at\_fallout\_76s\_sales\_figures/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/aba3cz/a_look_at_fallout_76s_sales_figures/)
---
That is a pessimistic view of sales. Problem with the link is it compares apples to oranges (RDR2 was a long awaited media darling whose own launch issues were largely ignored) and ignores that *it sold millions of units*. That's pre-wastelanders as well, which, combined with the ad campaign and the more favorable critical reception, probably sold significant copies to former fence sitters. That also ignores the ATX, which is almost certainly making money like crazy on PC at least (it's amazing how many folks are spamming the bug dance or have incredible amounts of ATX stuff).
---
GTA level bank breaker? Nah. But 76 is on solid ground. If it wasn't, I would have expected Wastelanders to be the last update that was not ATX (something a lot of folks predicted back then).
---
Nukacrypt.com
---
yes other wise you could drop or trade them
---
Alright will do
---
What makes that a contradiction? If downtime occurs while others sleep, Americans can play longer and therefore spend more.
---
We'll come back to this discussion in 4 weeks time ,how about that?
---
I'm trying to see this in a more positive light, but I'm admittedly struggling. I like the idea of earning some of these and saving my caps, but at the cost of all that steel, it doesn't feel like a worthwhile use of time. I at least have a bit I can donate right now, but I don't see myself grinding out junk like I was planning to.
---
And here I was, about to buy in to 1st for the month just to hold all the junk I was gonna grind out. Might just hold off for the time being, depending on how many of these plans I actually still need.
---
I'd buy a flag that is actually from the country I'm form
---
I'm 100% sure there is more players outside of murica than there is in it. You americunts just think the world revolves around you.
---
Then maybe it's time to find a new game.
---
Its all downed servers. It always has been.
---
Dupers will be our saviors. Atom bless them.
---
https://imgur.com/a/qCU7CDr
---
Oh I need that. I'm sitting on perk card packs and level ups, so that'll save me some headache
---
Hee hee hee
---
There is, but Americans makes up 55% of Atom Shop sales
---
I’m not allowed to ask of anyone else has experienced this?
---
I ain’t trading shit lol 
---
My resource like steel are more important then the rewards 
---
Only one worth is is the double score
---
They wait for the techie on duty to confirm that "it just works".
---
You're argument before was to do it when America sleeps.
---
So paying for a game then expecting what a company promises to deliver, on a timeline that they themselves create, makes people privileged and entitled huh? Weird flex, but ok.
---
 I have a support ticket from a month ago that they never responded too.
---
~~and apparently the plans can't be traded~~
---
Apart from the holiday events I mostly saw them in the airport and as rare spawns during final destination
---
I can try it out in more detail when the servers are up, I was looking at pip boy numbers for all the gauss weapons the minigun was the only one that didn't change from anything. I literally can not edit the post though, it gives me an error saying the field must be below 40000 characters
---
I've tried moving it about, I just couldn't find anywhere that meant you spawned in consistently within the built area.
---
I'd be more excited to hear Donald Trump fart through a walkie talkie then from getting anything on that list.
---
You say that they are inaccurate, but I have 3 star Executioners +250DR +33 Vats% Auto grenade launcher (or whatever, can't remember if it is 30% or 33%), when using concentrated fire, and the hit chance builds up there, I have literally had those grenades wiz around huge curves to still hit a scorchbeast flying through the air. If VATS says it hits, it makes sure to hit, even though it has such a slow shot speed and there is no way it should still hit a moving scorchbeast, it'll still wiz around and find its target. Fucking wild, like having a percentage chance to fire a heat-seeking 40mm grenade!
---
Still does shit damage considering it is still a grenade launcher....but it is fun!
---
gotcha
---
I find it odd that you're willing to pay real money for FO1st, but you're taking your stand by not participating in a free event?  I'm not trying to be negative, but it seems like canceling 1st would be more impactful if you're really that displeased with Bethesda's support.
---
I'm playing a bit of BF5 here and there but I suck at fps now I'm older haha.
---
I bought the latest metro game as I like the first 2 but I couldn't get into it.
---
I'll take recommendations if you feel like suggesting anything?
---
I'll still be grinding score till the season is done though!
---
Ty
---
Yes, I look resplendent in my Officers uniform
---
My new favourite apparel item.
---
(for the moment anyway)
---
Could be incorporated the same way as an icon flag. I'd like it.
---
Prefer if you didn't so they don't fix the bug
---
I really wanted to disagree with you, but after reading the rewards list, I can’t.   Just gotta hope the global cosmetics aren’t terrible, I guess.
---
No it wasn't.
---
Well, I would say that the infrastructure is more than the physical hardware. I would say it is the complete backend of the software.
---
In expemple: CIs in ITIL are not only harddrives but also license keys etc...
---
Since the Hardware are virtualized AWS Servers, where Bethesda cannot maintain so much I would think they are implementing some anti dupe or anti cheat infrastructure...
---
What do you think?
---
Where did you get the idea that there was supposed to be "a lot of new things to chase" with this update? Because I've never heard that, and I check this sub multiple times a day.
---
I will laugh if your hypothetical method actually works.
---
You'll miss out on some functions, though.
---
I tested them 11 hours ago and the blast radius is fine. It still killed enemies that were even outside the visual explosion range
---
Dupers will do it themselves, I'm happy we get another free collectron
---
The ammo refill bug on automatic weapons and the heavy guns is the same.
---
The difference, is that the emptied core gets refilled to that low percentage and then unequipped from the gun. It's technically free ammo, not an early reload.
---
Hi. Bloodied melee build here. I love hitting cars and seeing if I can survive the blast. Test: the parking lot of “valley galleria”. I can hit x3 cars that are next to each other and take the blasts without dying 
---
I then tried hitting a car in the main lot next to a big rig and 12-16 other cars. The explosions were so many and so big that my game crashed in the good old fallout 3 style (when walking through a door game crashes and makes “ BRVRVRVRVRVRVRVRVRV” noise lol)
---
Signed!
---
But for all we know most of the original devs have left or been put on working with star field or something
---
&gt;“A Colossal Problem” in the coming weeks. 
---
bro it is straight up comical how long this is taking. months for *an event.* wild.
---
As a guy that can only find a few hours every weekend to play, I’m kind of glad that the rewards are so lacklustre, it means that I’m not gonna miss out on cool items. Lately everything seems to be focused on the hardcore players that have an hour or two a day( is that even considered hardcore gaming anymore? Or just average gaming?)to game which I get, it’s fine, those are the folks sinking time and money into 76.  It would be nice to have some events that don’t have such a tight time limit. Even the legendary run, as soon as I heard it could be completed by logging in for an hour a day I knew I wouldn’t come close to finishing it( I get my star wall paper for my next reward).
---
Yeah was hoping for more. If you are satisfied with the crappy roll out then I truly feel sorry for you
---
Well, bless your soul - aren't you the cutest little thing?
---
Obviously it won’t......u can’t craft a plant pot
---
I think its worth coming back every now and then to fallout, just to see the new stuff like wastelanders.
---
But I'm.just wanting to get too 100 on the board right now.
---
BobaFettyWop
---
49.64. You know what is funny? I have started downloading FO76 off of gamepass about 24 hours ago. That was 80 or so GBs. Now a 50GB patch
---
EXCUSE ME WHAT THE FUCK
---
Good way to make a good impression, Bethesda
---
I scrapped my bloodied fss ripper back when we had 400 stash and two shot dragon, if I only knew.
---
Scrip and bullion, I'd probably empty my steel stores. have about 75k now. Old plans that drop everywhere else? fuck that. They ain't getting shit from me.
---
Lol. I’d rather have the steel.  Nice work guys. Somehow worse than the mole miner event. I didn’t think that was possible.
---
8 EST: UHH!
---
Wondering what they need to plug so much?
---
There is zero incentive to donate. Ill let lower levels do the heavy lifting
---
A Giddyup Buttercup flag? Good god, yes please.
---
Really? I paid 60 bucks, where is my discount?
---
Well, that's unexpected. Any brand new drops? It looks like nay at first glance.
---
Fair enough.
---
You can still do the photo mode glitch. Not sure what door glitch you're talking about
---
Nah. Scrapped it day 1, replaced it with budget worthy items. Not as cumbersome, but still cumbersome.
---
Here's the thing: The event worked fine
---
I'd love to be able to rebuild a complicated foundation.
---
I built a house that had one foundation with stairs and everything else was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with the intention of easily moving it around the wasteland.  I never found someplace I could rebuild it.  Even the flat barren plains of the cranberry bog worked.
---
Colossal problem has a lot of cosmetic rewards, and it was never confirmed until today what were the rewards of the provisions. So you can say, I dint manage my expectations.
---
&gt;There's absolutely nothing on this list that you can't find ~~across the map in static spawns or in level three safes.~~ in almost every player vendor because the gifts were duped by the millions and it's all the same shit minus the mounted heads.
---
FTFY
---
Is nobody going to mention the 50GB download size for Windows Store??
---
You're on my level my friend
---
Lmao
---
I just wanted to pop in and say I really enjoyed reading this entire conversation thread. I learned so much by reading it! 
---
I'm kind of iffy about the brotherhood, only because in fallout 4 all my friends were robots and synths, but I think in this case they really did all they could to fight back the scorched.
---
*They should do planned downtime when most of America is sleeping.*
---
I say at least two new duplication methods
---
I won't be, the rewards are mediocre I'd rather keep my junk
---
Edit: you can't say giving hundreds of thousands of cork etc.. is worth getting a beret or a BoS sign Bethesda took 5 min to create.
---
That and the other rewards are plans that were duped to hell in the large presents and pails minus the things from them people do actually want like the croc backpack etc..
---
That is always appears to be closed? I wondered if that was just me.
---
I will proudly fly a Pork and Beans flag
---
Love it mate!
---
it doesn't.
---
**ANTHEM IS NOT A FUCKING ROLE MODEL OF LOOT DROP BETHESDA.**
---
But meh fallout, get a grip. FFS live a little more life and you'll realize its is full of broken promises.
---
I'm still waiting for my leather settee from leather world and it's 12 days late..I paid £1300 for it, it's just life suck it up.
---
For real this last patch seriously messed with stairs. If you try to make anything that hangs off of stairs above 3 stories it glitches out and you can't ever remove anything. And have to move CAMP to fix it...
---
Try exiting and entering the game
---
I mean infrastructure is a broad term, at my work it covers the hardware to the OS and middleware. They could be talking internal infrastructure of the fallout game, but then why not say the application/software. 
---
So while they could, I don’t see why they would use infrastructure for that unless it was covering multiple games.
---
It’s an entire instanced event..
---
Only, asking people to not participate in an event, because you are upset at a company isn't just an opinion. It's an attempt to sabotage the event. It's not going to work, sure. 
---
So it's not that it's a different opinion. It's the attempt to disrupt the game for those that do want to do the event and have it succeed. 
---
So god forbid you understand the difference.
---
And again... *Most people play from North America. Should happen when most of them are sleeping.*
---
Dude the junk fence is in the camp bundle *sigh*
---
Man, There are a lot of different problems with the game.  Getting hysterical about it wont do anything. Also the game has been actively improving. You freak out because of a delayed event and tell people to "WAKE UP" like there is something sinister going on. Must be tiring being in that state of mind. I'm all for something like everyone canceling their 1st subscription on the same day with a list of reasonable demand.  If only someone as passionate as you would take the time and energy to organize something like that instead of having exploding negative diarrhea on random things.
---
*excited gamer noises*
---
Has it been increased from its original radius?
---
Long time players are definitly out of sight of bethesda. They are obv focusing on new players.
---
You have to do the quest forbidden knowledge where you turn in technical data to that little box at fort venture, I would do this quest 5-10 times a day because I really wanted the power armor paints. There’s around 5 variants like knight, knight CPT, paladin, and elder(can’t think of the others) and the drop rate is really low. I got an extra elder paint plan and someone bought it in my vender for 10k within 2 minutes of me putting it in there. I’ve done the quest a few hundred times at least
---
Seems like those other people he’s spoken to got pretty quiet.
---
Yea the seedy shes is back!!!!!
---
Think what you want, but I think Bethesda owes its playerbase a little bit more effort than what we're getting with this event. I'm sorry that that is something we disagree on.
---
I want to thank you firsthand for being a contributing party to the BOS Beret and Fatigues I will be claiming after Bethesda auto-completes the event via artificially inflating the numbers due to a disappointing turnout.
---
Never will be.  Seems like they like to forget any bugs brought over from Fallout 4.
---
I’ve resorted to watching the new episode of Alone 😬
---
I also work full time and have 980 ‘backed up’. Don’t know what I’m saving them for.... guess mods for the ss armor...
---
Maybe it'll Auto Complete like our daily challenges.
---
You really think the official patch notes thread is the correct place to voice your issues? Praise where it's due, and here we have excellent patch notes with lots of fixes and some new content even. 
---
Yeah, Bethesda has had a terrible track record so far, but we are seeing improvement. I took a break for a year and came back after wastelanders was released. The game has definitely improved since release, and the fact they are continuing to offer new updates and free content instead of just dumping the game and shelving it as a failed product does have merit. 
---
I also paid 60 bucks for the base game... but I don't see how that's relevant. We all know the game goes on sale for 20 bucks regularly, which is about what it's worth. 
---
Coming to the patch notes thread and complaining about things not included in the patch is whining, point blank.
---
They said there will be a chance at new rare plans from boxes you receive for donations
---
I’m lost
---
Misread this and thought it said children of atom n64. Id play that game on n64
---
Don't worry I'll have 5000 .38 bullets in my vendor at all times.
---
You craft ammo and some armor, this earns XP, then only keep 100 of junk not needed to craft the above. Craft using Super Duper 3 and scrap using Scrapper perk.
---
Or sell it to the vending robots but that does require plastic farming.
---
In the distance, you hear the cries and sounds of gnashing teeth from all the youtubers who posted videos about how to make cool floating camps.
---
No worries fam because in the meantime you can do Fortifying ATLAS for the same rewards we've already seen! Yay!
---
&gt; tbh though it's getting harder for Bethesda to provide rewards that are meaningful for new and old players alike. 
---
There are a bunch of things from the pails that weren't duped to shit that lots of players still want, like the treasure hunter and insurgent plans and the croc backpack. They could have veery easily added a few new things like BOS themed concrete tire walls, or defensive barricades with BOS logos on it. Stuff that would take an artist a few hours to reskin. 
---
There is abolsutely nothing on this list that you can't find for cheap in most of the player vendors, so even the new people don't have much incentive. 
---
If you're a low level player are you going to give up 250 steel for a chance at a dense leather torso plan when you could sell a couple of bulk steel for 10 caps each and buy the same plan from someone for 20 caps?
---
The Floater Grenades are terrible. I got the Plan for them, for Gold Bullion, and I want a bullion refund for them.
---
I found a Legendary laying on the ground after SBQ, not in a bag just laying out. Was wonder how, maybe it was from the unlootable corpse bug?
---
I get that, and honestly, I'm going to participate and have fun, but its annoying there are no rare cosmetic plans and even if there were we wouldn't be able to trade them
---
It’s mind boggling how a tiny glitch is taking months to solve
---
Still ain’t working, can you take a pic?
---
My bad sorry
---
Did u see the rewards list
---
What tiny glitch?
---
no vertibird power armor, why even live
---
This guy gets it
---
Definitely, and I appreciate the attempt at build-up and immersion.   
---
But I think it's overly generous to say Fortifying ATLAS has a comprehensive story to enjoy beyond it's rewards.
---
Actually, they add very good content, but its not well thought out (also like F4-DLC) and made for low level players.
---
The fatigues are a reskin for the Steel Dawn BoS that is supposed to arrive. Brotherhood blue camo.
---
I'm on Xbox, but im a ps4 guy. Decided to give the Xbox a try, but I will be going back to Sony with the ps5
---
Those fences though 😍
---
Then don't. 
---
Plenty of us will still do it
---
My hope is energy weapons and ammo
---
Honestly the titles for these posts each week is what keeps me alive rn
---
I have never had issues with them. Even before wastelanders I have had people telling me the radius is so bugged it needs to be on top of enemies to deal damage, but my testing showed otherwise
---
Oooh someone coulda had ya this week I think
---
Can't get it to work right
---
they said its ok if you dont have 1 charisma lmao, so yes they did consider it
---
No, its still a good game to play, but things like this get on my nerves.
---
Nvr mind lmao
---
Did you read the patch notes?
---
Hopefully I can help it with that mission.
---
Thanks for posting!
---
I imagine that's likely to be a reward in the next season.
---
We who can't be assed salute you, my friend. o7
---
In the PTS when it was around, if you died during a certain phase of the event you would respawn outside the map and fall to your death infinitely until the event was over or you quit. That was the only issue in the PTS.
---
Plans for the actual armor, or mod plans like rusty knuckles?
---
It's currently the only way to make a gattling gun one shot 68 super muties (no sneak obv), so I'm glad it's fixed.
---
The plans can be, the provisions themselves can't.
---
I think that will be a reward for season 2. With the brotherhood stuff.
---
I’m not sure how to, sorry. You can filter by new to see the other posts though.
---
Idk how it works with XBox, but on ps4 I can set my second ps4 up to use the online pass from my primary account. So both consoles can get online and I only pay once.
---
Biv is awesome and I worship him daily.
---
I'm pretty sure it's been stated that Legendary Perks should be coming in Patch 22. Given their constant struggle with A Colossal Problem, however, I wouldn't be surprised to see this pushed back an update or two, either.
---
I want to know about the rain water collector and water fountain. Is the water clean?!
---
I’m hoping  the community fails and the BOS have no base . Just a bunch of bro’s hanging around in broken power armour with sleeping bags
---
u/nukacolakindaguy
---
I really hope you guys manage to make a dent in 150,000,000 steel in 4 days.
---
Elaborate?
---
This gives me hope that they’ll do the same with scrip bullion limits.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
It’s in the atomic shop files instead of the score files
---
This\^
---
This gives me hope that they’ll do the same with scrip and bullion limits.
---
You can't do anything on Hugh's net. So glad I moved closer to town.
---
The model of Xbox doesn’t really matter. You’ll probably see some rubber banding on occasion but otherwise you’ll be fine.
---
Bad design is bad design.  To lay the blame on player inventory, in a game that encourages you to lug around thousands of items, instead of giving you a decent sized stash box, doesn't make me think any better of the BETH.
---
Colossal problem will start as event, but cave couldn't be open with nuke. Like sometimes Load bearing event won't let you in.
---
I done that update when maintenance started
---
Probably more for people like me who placed a foundation for a dock that can't be selected requiring me to delete my entire camp just to get rid of it.
---
Atom be praised
---
I would gladly fly a Nuka girl flag
---
Changing the loottable is even easier than making the new texture.
---
Well do I have some bad news for you...
---
Picklock 3/ hacker 3.  Silo done in 10-15min. No glitching.   
---
Today’s gamers man....
---
Yaay
---
My god, they need to take that engine to a quiet nice place, like a lake or something,  tell it to look over lake and see the beauty. Then take a pump shotgun and finish a clip into the glitchy head. I'd be fine with no games for 2 years if we got a new engine.
---
Hell yeah plague doctor mask
---
I have to say that this is rather disappointing, there are a few things on the plan list I don't have but then again I can't say I desire them.  I was hoping for at least a chance to finally snag the Metal picnic table plans that I am missing :-/
---
Wow i was hoping to get the croc bookbag. There is absolutely nothing on the list that is interesting.
---
lol I’ll ask your permission because adding future questions
---
What kind of pings do you get on a speedtest?
---
I love those things.
---
They're all great for tagging enemies because the visual effects let you know if the tag happened, and the cryo ones are great for pvp because they drain player AP and the floater groan noise makes players think they're being attacked by a floater which distracts them. Great for claiming bounties.
---
If they sent you a full cloth one, are you going to just "live life and suck it up"? Thought not. 🤡
---
Glitching 5 minutes.  Why add the extra time when there is no benefit in terms of exp?  Some players don’t want to spend more time doing this for no return at all.
---
Have people forgotten there’s new players that maybe haven’t gotten most of what you have already gotten?
---
It was delayed based on testing. Not whether or not people like the event. Seems like the testing is doing exactly what it is supposed to.
---
Now, I want to see concept art for these
---
Yessss thanks for the comment or i wouldn't have known
---
So, there's absolutely zilch to offer players who have been around for 2+months and have the most extra scrap, but the new players who might benefit from some random plans won't have reserves or the ability to carry anywhere near as much... Who is this event even for? Might as well call em The Brotherhood of Mediocrity. What a weak introduction.
---
Both, yes.
---
The event isn't for you. 
---
It's a thinly veiled attempt to empty out dupers scrap stashes.
---
Reddit is a good source of information like that. From data mining and people following Beth posts about this game, it isnt a stretch of the imagination that someone other than YOU would know.
---
Pails got duped as well just not to the level of the Gifts.
---
Pokemon moon and sun. Its first couple of community events failed horribly. They asked too much too early in the game when most of the extreme players wasnt going to get it until christmas.
---
mwahahahaha buy the subscription timmy, sell your soul to the devil
---
What the hell? Only newbies are going to want any of that stuff, but they're not going to have the materials to donate.
---
I think you are underestimating how many SBQ’s are launched because of these shortcuts.
---
I’m not getting it now ffs. I don’t really care about the rest of that stuff.
---
It’s a small team that is trying to please new players and vet players. Im thankful we have a new event coming that may match w/ SBQ &amp; plenty of more things coming
---
How? Blue ridge doesn't have anything close to a hazmat suit
---
That's really neat
---
I won’t even waste the keystroke to throw them. It’s not clear they do more damage than a flare gun
---
Again, it's a free event with free items. I'll donate stuff here and there because I want to contribute to the community. I don't even personally care about the rewards. If the 250 steel I donate helps the community get an item, that's all the satisfaction I need. I don't feel entitled to anything, I'm not gonna sit on my ass and cry that I'm personally not getting anything out of it while everyone else donates.
---
&gt; I very very very much doubt that the case is they literally found out today something is horribly wrong ...  
---
&gt; people that play on the pts are surprised that it hasn’t gone up today because everything has been running smoothly 
---
Hence the bit about Bob pulling it because they found an unexpected error when preparing to take it live. Because it was working. Which means it was working on the test servers, but maybe not once they moved to another internal test server. Remember how they had that fuckup before, where they admitted they couldn't reproduce some bugs because it didn't show up on their test server? I wonder if they actually did as they said and improved their testing system to *catch game breaking bugs and pull them before launch.* 
---
&gt;...it’ll be the majority of the player base that’s disappointed that the  new endgame content has been delayed for the second time on the day of  its supposed launch 
---
Worth note: Reddit is a minority, in its entirety, and yet this still has not caused the sub-breaking ruffled jimmies of previous problems. The majority of the player base *probably* don't even read anything beyond the patch notes to see what's going up, and the majority almost certainly do not warp their scheduled around a patch for a game. 
---
Even the majority of the reddit sub aren't with you on this. Notice the lack of eternally repeating complaint posts, upvotes for said complaint posts, and so on? Shit, I have yet to see a "circlejerk" comment about this, and that's basically how r/fo76 greets one another. "Ahh, good circlejerk to you, white knight" "And to thee, kind entitled crybaby, a very good circlejerk today indeed."
---
Your aggro is reasonable. I'd be pissed too if I had planned time off going unused for its purpose. But that's as much on you for unrealistic expectations as it is on them for breaking said expectations.
---
Hmm i had the same problem with the old man  after patch 20  and switched over to the punk and got a fetch quest right away  but only 1 for 3 days  so we\`ll see after patch 21.
---
Check out the pricing tool on this website. 
---
https://fed76.info/pricing/
---
Take the value with a grain of salt, its based off pricing gathered from the PC version, so it might not always be 110% accurate but usually gives me a decent idea of value.
---
For weapons bloodied/ junkies for tier 1 most sought after, instigating, anti-armor, furious for tier 2, two shot and the rest for tier 3.
---
TwoShot explosive is usually still worth a bit if the buyer isnt aware of the nerf to them ages ago. Its a decent roll, just not really a tier 1 or god roll anymore.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3pspq/update_from_jeff_gardner_for_colossal_problem_2/
---
14K+ Atoms damn BjornX.
---
The deletion of the 2 outfits (explorers insurgent), their hats, the circus cage, and backpack means no scrap from me. I kind of perversely want this to fail, to show Beth they actually need to consider what the players might want as rewards. I know Beth won't allow it to fail, for PR, but I would love to see the real numbers on donations.

Never played Tactics but I hear it's great.
---
How can something be bad before it's launched? That statement doesn't make sense to me.
---
I'll be honest, I haven't kept up with patch notes much since Wastelanders dropped. Didn't realize the other two were broken by previous patches, and was just happy they're working now. Heck, before this weekend I didn't even know the Colossal Problem event was a thing, and had just barely encountered a Colossus myself on Saturday.
---
I need literally nothing on that list.   The only thing I don't have are the plans for the T armor, and I don't want or need those.   :(
---
Probably the best free item they’ve given so far. Thanks for the feedback
---
Cool
---
"August 11 Atom Shop updates for everyone but Quasar" 😭
---
What is it?
---
image if you had the original 400 stash limit. IMAGINE!
---
Hopefully they don’t fix them.  There is literally no reason to run silos otherwise as they take too long and give less exp than killing the mutants in front if Westek
---
Pretty sure they have yet to release it. It was talked about a lot last month but it may be a new PA when the BoS arrive, since they may come by vertibird.
---
this patch is a massive let down to some players. mostly the ones who mistakenly thought it was going to be a major content update.
---
I was about to post the same thing. Going to try other toons to see if that will fix the problem.
---
Sadly this is just pure and simple lazyness on Bethesda's part; all they did was literally copy and paste the Christmas gift rewards over minus anything unique and cool. Every single veteran player will have mostly all of these already and it's the veterans who will fuel this event; not the new players. Complete and utter failure on Bethesda's side for this entire event and lack of planning.
---
That's lower than that girl in the Guinness book of records for limbo. I agree
---
Very thin. 
---
But who the hell duped cork?
---
That would be a great idea.  Make running silos faster or go back to giving normal exp from all the robots.
---
Was hoping they'd fixed that "Cannot remove item, part of the structure would be inaccessible," not good bugs like this
---
My atoms are safe another week.
---
What was Duping?
---
At least I'll have somewhere to sit.😘
---
I solo'ed the Queen on a private server just to try and get this challenge to pop... still did not complete.  Just straight up bugged.
---
Maybe I’m just mad that it’s not in the game😡. Sadly I cant play on the PTS, but from what I watched it no one completing the event had any issues. Perhaps there are other underlining issues were not aware.

You can keep getting scammed by Bethesda for all I care tbh.
---
Why don't you take your passion and better the game? Oh wait, YOU CAN'T
---
Agreed, Poison Resist perk card needed yesterday lol. Since the Wastelanders update poison damage seems to have been increased. We have perks card for Rad Resist, Energy Resist, Damage Resist and Ironclad which is both Damage and Energy Resist. We even have backpack mods that increase every resistance except Poison. While the simple solution is probably two 2 Star peices of armor with +25 Poison Resist, it can be a struggle for people running a specific primary Legendary Modifier armor set. Especially people running Secret Service armor. RNG is worse then usual when crafting weapons or armor using Legendary Modules IMO. You might be crafting and and grinding scrip for Modules for a while before getting even one piece with the primary Legendary Modifier you want and +25 Poison Resist.
---
On a side note, I really think they need to increase the amount of points in each SPECIAL category from 15 to 20, especially if they add new Perk Cards. I know they are testing Legendary Perk Cards but who knows if we will ever see them.
---
I love that free item
---
I know I'm two weeks late to this thread, but I would love it if we had emotes that allowed a certain level of customization.
---
In this particular instance, an emote that would allow you to wave a certain flag from a preset list (maybe faction flags) would be really cool.
---
Big eye roll in response to your eyeroll
---
The rest also doesn’t fit the “junk” theme, aside from the Flea. We get those, a mothman bundle reject, and something that looks like it should be in green thumb or spring bundle. Guess the giant concrete walls are staying in my camp
---
Now you've confused me. I actually did mean to say all of that. So I've made zero contradictions. Planned downtime should happen as America sleeps which is what I said.
---
Ugh you can take mine
---
Of course not
---
I think they’ll do adjustments like increased junk drop rate event or something that will help players. But ya it’s obvious most vet players will not participate.  All i care about is colossus &amp; legendary perks tho so far
---
Earlier in the game, sell bulk junk and ammo.  
---
Later in the game, buy mutation serum recipes and then sell mutation serums.
---
Same issue if you solo the SBQ

Yes, Reddit is a fantastic source of info. So much so, that if that info actually existed (spoiler alert: it never has, yet people somehow think it does), it would be posted all over the subreddit.
---
If more Americans pay money as they play, the downtime should occur as they sleep. Where is the issue, dude?
---
And that is why they are a bundle exclusive. To entice you to buy the bundle.
---
According to that tweet 2 weeks is right
---
Does the rain barrel have a function?
---
If they are offering a monthly subscription, I am entitled to "whine" all I want about what I am paying for if it doesn't meet elementary standards. There isn't even any new content to speak of here, like none whatsoever. ATLAS will provide basic, pre-existing rewards worth less than the junk donated. Bethesda is capable of more. But ah, fuck it. Guess complaining about the patch in the patch notes thread isn't appropriate. I don't see this as any sort of improvement by any stretch of imagination. At the basis of it is shit poor communication and community engagement which is unacceptable for a game centered around a service model. Pulling the plug on an event teased for the last few weeks at the last second? Shouldn't we learn that news from the community managers and not the fucking patch notes? The reason you see the same bugs bought up time and time again on this sub is because nobody ever comes on here to say "we hear your feedback and are working on it". Having one CM visit once a week to reply to 1 or 2 unsubstantive threads is not community engagement. If they actually played the game they'd know about half the glitches before even releasing this patch. But thank fuck they fixed the CAMP roof/wall trick, that was really pertinent and a valuable use of resources.
---
New BUG. Major panic for a second. Thought my Secret service armour was gone. Turns out brotherhood fatigues are no longer under armour and was covering my SS armour. Less annoyed but still very annoyed. That is only under armour I wear.
---
Hopefully I’ll actually get to play later!
---
I'm not saying I participated, but duping mats was VERY easy back when the display glitch was live. If you had 1st, it would have taken you maybe an hour to get hundreds of thousands of each kind of scrap just to line your box up and set you for the the life of 76.
---
Well Double Bigger Eye Roll back!!
---
It was supposed to be.
---
Re SBQ not landing, I’m no SBQ expert but FWIW I’ve noticed that if people are standing on top of buildings like the drop site, she doesn’t land much vs if more people are standing on the actual ground she will land every few min.
---
The times she just flew away into the nuke zone out of range for 10 min, everyone was standing on the drop zone roof.
---
IDK maybe it's not blue ridge, but it's blue/white and comes from their event. I was offered one but didn't take it.
---
There's an issue when you die during the event you can get spawned outside of the cave and constantly fall to your death until you leave the server or the event ends, I'd say that's a pretty big bug.
---
where did you hear this? I checked the vault and the plans aren't there?
---
I don't think I am. There are plenty of us that enjoy playing this game without making an already easy run laughable.
---
If anything, my complaint is that they need to make it more interesting, not that they've fixed an exploit.  
---
So. If you don't want to run the silo as intended, then don't. It will still happen on the regular.
---
Yeah, before the PTS, Bethesda would have released it broken and then taken months to fix it. I'll take a delay over another broken end game event any day.
---
You're all over the place.
---
Get a Bloodied 33% vats M79 and you won't want to drop them anymore. I tried one just out of boredom last week and the thing is amazing in VATS. With 30 PER and the long barrel mod I have almost always a 95% hit chance in vats (and it doesn't bug and miss like it does with my other weapons somehow) and I guess because of VATS the grenades seek their target like the targeting computer on the missile launcher should, and they hit with enough damage to one-shot multiple level 68 muties with a torso shot on one of them in the group. Just wear a dense chest armor and you're good on the spashback too (but keep a melee or another gun close at hand because of the single shot reload). This is without any ranks of explosives perks either. If you can spare the points to use those it's even better and can one hit level 50 and 65 scorchbeasts (two hits on the level 80).
---
I swapped around some points to use the rank 3 explosives weight perk now so I can carry all the 40mm I want. Considering respeccing a bit more for explosive weapons now just for this gun, really. 380 levels into the game I'm getting tired of bloodied commando TBH.
---
I also have a B33 Fatman... and that one still is garbage so apparently the M79 is just an exception to the rule that explosive weapons are garbage.
---
Oh fuck this, you can't swap doorways with walls now.
---
The deep pocketed mods are missing from rigs! Please hotfix that :(
---
Back in the last century :) We did a major upgrade to the windows servers at a major international bank over a weekend.. brought it all back online at the right time except someone had forgotten to upgrade the WINS servers which were in a separate server room.
---
Never seen so many people deny responsibility!
---
There's no pleasing many of you. Adrenaline being fixed is worth it alone. BGS is far from perfect but JFC.
---
We lost little over a day and got a week added. 
---
And by the end of that week it was mostly afk players going in circles to farm the event.
---
Legitimately want to thank you in advance for any level of grinding and donating you (and other 1st members) do over the next few weeks. Between this, Neverwinter, and Rocket Arena, I can only spend so much time on each game. I'll donate what I can as I'm able, but it's you paying players who will push this one over the edge. So, again, thank you.
---
Please hotfix this /u/Ladydevann
---
That aged really well into 2020, let me tell you.
---
The quoted patch notes say that unscrapped junk is prioritized *last* now, behind scrapped junk from your stash and scrapbox.
---
It comes from radiation rumble, right?
---
They said before it was mainly gunna be a bug fix patch focus rather than content focused.
---
that doesn't sound tiny lol
---
Good. 
---
They can contribute.
---
Silos only take 10-15 minutes without glitching through. Just run it legit and stop exploiting the game
---
Yeah that is an extremely good freebie.
---
How on this earth is expecting a company to do what they said when they said it ‘unrealistic’? This attitude completely baffles me 
---
Like I’ve said in this posts edit, nobody’s shot your dog, people are allowed to be disappointed and that doesn’t really affect you or the other people disagreeing does it?
---
I mean, it wasn't protecting you from Waterborne Diseases before.
---
It only said it was, when it actually wasn't. They didn't nerf it, just correct the information.
---
im at the point where the only thing left is the new bullion stuff, but theres a limit to how quickly you can grind those as well. despite having max caps on every character on TWO accounts, i cant spend more than 6k per week on bullion. even when i DONT sell to vendors, just by selling legendaries, plans, and tasty foods, i very rarely drop below 20k caps, and normally i have to turn my vending machines off so people dont show up to buy stuff. 
---
its silly. i dont understand how people can defend the limits. the cap limit should be like 2 million, the scrip limit should be like 50k with no daily cap, and the daily bullion shouldnt be limited at all. this is all so they can force people to play the game over a longer period of time, which will artificially prolong the games life...
---
Yeah, it's a major pain in the rear. I just tried making a bar within the train car for the first time. It looks great but nowhere that I move the camp box will make people spawn into the bar, even though at my last camp players consistently spawned into the bar when it hadn't even been a deliberate goal. 
---
I frequently seem to have better results when I put it way up in the air.
---
So... here we are again. New patch, new file. The servers aren't up yet and I have to head off to work today soon. I've done the basic stuff and maybe fixed the SCORE progression flyout, but can't test it. Saved in the usual place.
---
Edit: Quick play and SCORE level-up seems ok.
---

---
[For 1st members](https://imgur.com/GtHpwbn) it doesn't show the prices bc i already have them srry, i think the armor paint is less than 200 atoms or something like that.
---
2 shots, Each shot splits into 5
---
Fuck yeah.
---
It's probably more a balancing issue which is what you're omitting rather than a bug, but I could be wrong.  The radius is exceptionally small relative to other grenades, has no secondary effects, and has lower damage than other grenades.  It also uses an uncommon ingredient, so I think therein lies the main grievance with Nuka Quantum Grenades, is overall performance, especially when compared to something like Nuka Grenades.  
---
I'd like to see a video with some specific testing though, since it's hard to really get any datamined information about exact weapon stats, like blast radius.
---
I have an issue with the gattling plasma and lasers where they will sometimes cut out while shooting, just stop firing.  Also they seem to reload when there is still some rounds in a core.  I have dozens of quarter empty cores in my inv.
---
This has happened to me twice. I've rebuilt my base both times. Both times I did it begrudgingly and was irritated by it. Both times my base came out better. I'm pretty stinking happy with my current base. I don't want to rebuild YET AGAIN but I still contemplate it. Then I think maybe I should play the Sims if I just want to build shit.
---
Maybe not Atoms but they should at least give you something. Other battle passes reward you after finishing the pass.
---
Valid. It is quite humorous, though. Highly suggested. You can fire a few off, and wait for the delayed explosions in the air, well after they should have normally struck or missed. Like, *boof boof boof* into the air targeting a scorchbeast, shoot a couple rounds into the scorched at your feet, and then look back up to hear and see the fireworks when it finally decides to connect.
---
All the more reason to not participate and just wait for them to auto-complete it for us.
---
Were hard times
---
Ok? What's the point of that? Looks like its gonna be 3 if anything
---
New Content should be relevant for all players.
---
&gt; The Helmet for the Chinese Stealth Suit **no longer incorrectly states** that it protects against waterborne diseases."
---
It never protected you to begin with.
---
Didnt realise how shocking the weapon mods are in this game
---
Thanks i didn't know that.
---
Can confirm
---
When you want an asbestos roof but buy a 1300 atom spring bundle instead.
---
Ugh well now that will be stuck on my head all week
---
I would assume that because of the way physics works in the game, and the fact that it was essentially a square single-player game shoved into a round multi-player hole, having walls floating in mid air without the base or something attached to them likely caused weird problems for them.
---
I, for one, am glad they are fixing these lingering issues. Even if it is little stuff like this. People may have figured out ways to make use of these bugs/glitches that seem harmless, but they are more than likely negatively affecting the overall stability of the game.
---
 A few things in there I would have liked...but I don't dare spend atoms until the legendary run is done and I know if I'll need any atoms to finish it off.
---
Yeah what the fuck. I don't want/need ANYTHING from the rewards list. I already have all that. You know what I DO need? To keep my steel for crafting ammo for war with the BOS.
---
There's countless BoS cosmetic items they could give us as rewards or even countless items in the game already that could have BoS themed skins. It's not difficult for them to do. :/
---
You don't want them? Okay. We put them in the ATLAS Donor's Provisions so you can have more.
---
I’m all too familiar with their devious ways haha. Hard to believe that this nets them more $ than giving players freedom of choice though
---
Had this same thought last night.  Had to run back just to tell Davenport that I got...uh "robbed" of the photos he needed.
---
I'd rather just call and be like "I sold them, keep your caps.  We'll try again tomorrow."
---
I never played the pre-3D era (believe me i tried so many times even bought them but i can't get on them (loved the soundtracks tho, one of the best in the industry) so my list is incomplete but:
---
**1.Fallout: New Vegas** - Best story in my opinion, awesome DLCs and overall vibe is in the right spot. This is the first fallout that I've played and in the first day i played for about 10 hours, shooting my BB gun and listening to the music.
---
**2.Fallout 76** - Best map, the locations are awesome, views are breathtaking and the community (in-game) is just so positive. I'm just mad at it because sometimes it seems like the devs have to do things to a certain level, let's say 50, and they do it until 49 and nothing more. This make it seems like they don't care about the game and don't put their souls in it. I still have hopes it will get better but I think it's all for nothing. 
---
**3.Fallout 3** - Very atmospheric, grim yet funny. Loved the DLCs and the overall vibe that it offered.
---
**4.Fallout 4** - Great introduction to the "new" Fallout, loved the new weapon mechanics and the introduction of C.A.M.P. Also, very well done map but 76's is on another level.
---
**5. Fallout Shelter** - Great addition to the Fallout franchise, had a lot of fun with it and it served right in my "build and manage" spot
---
Looool
---
We waited 3 weeks for a patch, and the deep pocketed is only available on the chest... Good job Beth
---
Yeah,is that not blue ridge? I was given the barrel, I've not done the event. I thought it'd be fun rolling all wood armor and can't do sh.. in events I can't run and hide lol
---
Yeah I'm level 420 (blaze it) on my main and I'm getting pretty tired of this game. I love fallout and the people I've met through 76. But, this is becoming the equivalent of that shitty high priced restaurant that you go to because your girl loves it and all you can think of is "when is this place going to close so I can be free of shitty service and overpriced food that takes an hour to finally get and then eat the shitty food"
---
The actual fucking reward is the community goals, this shit is just there as a little bonus to the people that are actually contributing a bit. 
---
Also remember this event is open to EVERYONE and is going to be far more beneficial to the newer players that don't have most of this stuff, they can't exactly create events like this to cater to the level 800 players with every single plan unlocked already.
---
I know! I really want the Nuka cola secret door but I already have the lamp and the pristine machine
---
Subreddit has basically become choosing beggars
---
Why even donate? They'll complete whether we do so or not.
---
Yeah, he only sells deep pocketed torso. I don't think the others exist.
---
All I’m saying is that there aren’t many people that play the PTS so if they incentivise people to play I’m sure the bugs would come to light quicker.
---
You got a link to them score files?
---
Probably cork and steel and all the other things they need for this event lol.
---
People have been asking for more junky items since release.
---
I bet the same function as the settlers' water well
---
I'm curious of this as well. Also how much water does the collector store? May alleviate me of some small water purifiers.
---
1.) Fallout 4/New Vegas- Can't really decide which one I like more
---
2.) Fallout 2
---
3.) Fallout 1
---
4.) Fallout 76
---
5.) Fallout 3 - I've only played it once though
---
6.) Fallout Tactics
---
I bought the $100 1-year pass when it first launched and will not be renewing.
---
you realize you just buy the mods for those right?
---
I'd try to find another alternative if at all. I had a few friends who hated it for being expensive and having awful bandwidth caps. 
---
I moved back into my parents rural farmhouse this year and Fallout 76 was unplayable on their satellite internet. After some improvising, I realized I could turn my 4g hotspot on my phone and connect my PS4 to that. Certainly not ideal, but for gameplay it works just fine. The problem you run into is having to download the massive patch updates every couple months 😬
---
Yep it's a waste of steel for rubbish, I just dumped everything I got from 10,000 steel
---
oh yeah, more .25 weight plans to add to my already limited carry capacity. besides the replica grognak axe plan, I don't see any "Rare plans" in there that I couldn't just buy from a white spring vendor.
---
Even by that standard I'd say it's a let down. In fact, probably more-so.
---
How can you still be on their nuts at this point
---
On the Bethesda forums where they post PTS information. ATLAS and wendigo were only ever gunna be the stuff this patch had content wise.
---
I will be murdering them when they arrive, no doubt
---
High five bro, Up top ......oh yeah. The real protests happen on 76.
---
I worked my ass off since beta...got about 80k steel - no chance im giving it away for those rewards lol
---
That be great, however I am on PC. Perhaps if the cross server ever comes.. good gaming in any case
---
No?  Blue Ridge Caravan Co. Runs in the south of the map.  Across the Blue Ridge Mountains
---
Yeah this thing might open some possibilities.
---
And no Colossal Problem, so they failed to deliver.
---
And these junk fences have literally been in Fallout 4 since 2015. They did **no work whatsoever to put these in fallout 76**. Yet they charge you 1200 atoms for them.
---
Yeah, skipped.
---
3 &gt; NV &gt; 4 &gt; 76
---
Somehow I went in expecting the worst (see, Mole Miner Pails) and they managed to still find a way to be even worse than that.
---
I don’t think there’s anything else other than what’s already available in the legendary run
---
And even though this is just a video game. I expect them to deliver content like they promised which is why I pay monthly. If you don't understand that then I'm sorry.
---
Agreed.  I don't suspect it can fail and I'm sure they selected the numbers with that in mind.  I don't plan to contribute.  Not only because the prizes aren't worth it, but also because I just don't like the BoS.
---
If it's anything like Project Clean Appalachia, it's not like we got a real-time count anyway.  It seemed to be someone coming into the office on Monday, looking at the number, and enabling the reward.
---
Clearly it does. I’m sure they have analysts who look at atom shop trends regularly.
---
Imagine no player vending and no legendary exchange......😮
---
Whaaat? That's the one thing I got excited about in the patch notes.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
On Xbox it seems to work fine however you can only pick up items from one side of it. The whole bag itself appears to not be a container but only a small section of it.
---
It is!  That's a super visible loot bag.
---
they were supposed to be added in the patch today. It's in the patch notes.
---
Unfortunately, they don't seem actually implimented in-game.
---
They said they expect it to be two weeks. You said it will be at least 4...
---
I am still waiting on your examples of when “the coming weeks” has meant 4+ in the past. I’m not doubting, just curious.
---
Either way there's a hazmat for RR. Sorry about the confusion.
---
That would make sense and not money - The wastes of semen and oxygen decision makers at Bethesda.
---
"Good job fixing the thing you broke!"
---
I believe they used to do separate pieces before legendary run, but now it seems bundle only, like with the Hunters bundle all I wanted was the mounted Sheepsquatch but it was all or nothing. It seems to be in correspondence with the changes in atoms availability whereas now all our challenges go toward Legendary Run rather than atoms.  Making atoms all the harder to obtain
---
I don't think anything he's saying is toxic. He thinks that if others feel the same as him, they should do what he's doing. Nothing wrong with that at all. If it was a good cause and he said get if you support this cause like I do, you should donate like I am, is that toxic? No.
---
Nope. To add insult to injury, the rest of the stuff in the bundle is garbage and not the junkyard themed type either. I guess I'll just get the seedy shed now that it's on sale and call it a day. Screw bundle exclusive items, especially low effort asset flip ones like these that have been heavily requested by players.
---
Yep getting that too with the beth launcher
---
Did you and I read the same patch notes, that feature many bug fixes?
---
well, Fasnacht also lagged the servers really badly. I would take over a minute for objects to appear once I started a daily. once Fasnacht ended, it took seconds for objectives to appear.
---
I see your Double Eye Roll, and counter with a Circlejerk!
---
That's a Reddit Circlejerk, not a literal one, to be clear.
---
For the people already complaining about this list... what the fuck were you expecting exactly?  Reward tables on par with or surpassing the mole miner pails and holiday gifts?  The entire point of those were that the number you could get was limited based on your caps or crafting resources.  All you have to do to redeem these rewards is hand over some fucking scrap, the two are nowhere near comparable so why would they have comparable rewards?  The ACTUAL rewards are the community goals, this table is just a little bonus.
---
GIVE ME T-60 PLANS!!!!
---
Will do! Feels good to see someone having the same problem, I’m getting tired of being told it’s my almost new PSU or that it’s my graphics settings being too high or something
---
Just did 10k cos i have a lot. Got about 4k of caps and a load of shite out of it
---
Take the L
---
It was a joke, because you're always so quick
---
Yeah, there is.  I think it and the rad barrel are the only special things.
---
So they nerfed the Chinese Stealth Suit AND an entire building style. No word on stuff that's been broken for over a year like Flamer Barrels.
---
They already brought it back once or twice during quarantine, but it is an amazing piece nevertheless. My daguerre has been waring the silver shroud outfit with a plague doctor mask since the day they allowed us to give allies outfits
---
The plague doctors mask returned
---
This thing is still a nightmare to use. Better have your entire ammo inventory memorized or get used to the “transaction failed”
---
message.
---
you know what this means
---
Khajiit are coming after BOS.
---
It's nylon
---
You can switch modes without going all the way back. And when exiting, just hold the ‘back’ button.
---
Firstly, the aggression isn't required. Secondly, unless you grind the shit out of this game (which I, along with many other players simply don't have time to do), scrap is either paid for with a premium or traded and I personally, have traded my ass off to get the scrap I have right now.
---
Secondly, the community goals won't be met because of how poor these items are, they're not free by any stretch, you pay in junk. The duped junk will probably supplement the majority of this.
---
Pardon me all to hell for having my own opinion.
---
Used harsh language
---
Uncommon aid items would have been nice. Who needs stims and rad meds... give me some flavored mentats or psychotats or some formula p.
---
Same with the alcohol, some of the uncommon ones would have been nicer than beer.
---
I’m curious. Do you know why the word couple means?
---
The last time they said “a couple of weeks” for wastelanders it was exactly two weeks also btw.
---
Just checked and no, its not. Some other misc mods were in there, but not lighter and ultra-light. Whyy Bethesda?
---
...that's an excellent point.
---
Yes it’s the item for August. Recycled from the bottom of February’s trash bin.
---
No. Way. Literally the second I posted this, power came back on.
---
What I typically do is walk out of the cell and render range and back in for most corpses that disappear. It usually forces them to respawn if they vanish abruptly.
---
Now do that with Caps, Bullion, and Scrip. :/
---
ya, but all that standing water.
---
who wants blood bugs buzzing around all day? :)
---
Nothing new to do, so you aren't missing much other than playing as before.
---
I mean Rainbow Six had a community challenge like this and it wasn't reached. 2 months later the item was given out to only people who contributed
---
Very good answer! And yes i guess i cant play another game...  stuck forever in Appalachia
---
I asked for minute amounts of caps in a similar suggestion, and got downvoted to hell.  I was already trying to compromised to not rob Todd of his Monopoly Money
---
"Khajiit has wares to sell"
---
what?
---
I know, I just bought it!
---
Not defending it... just adding tips. 
---
If you go back instead of through the menu again, it’s faster. That way you also don’t go 15 pages deep in the terminal.
---
I'm haven't even touched the patch and I'm already over it. Real bugs aren't being addressed and I'm not donating shit for plans I already have. I'll donate for the Banner and the collectatron
---
Does this imply if you use 4 then use another when there's only a minute left you get that 100% for another hour?
---
Don’t like it? It’s one of my favorite things when I visit someone else’s camp
---
What is this Gauss Rifle VATS bug? Something other then VATS overall not working in pvp?
---
I dont know actually, havent tried it yet. But I am Steam so I will let you know.
---
A Sleazy Heart bed and a Thatched rug
---
This was my list I came up with a week or so after Wastelanders dropped:
---
1: Fallout 2 (My favorite game of all time.)
---
2: Fallout New Vegas
---
3: Fallout
---
4: Fallout Wasteland Warfare (Table Top Minitures)
---
5: Wasteland 2 (I don't care, it's a Fallout game.)
---
6: The Outer Worlds (Again don't care. It's Fallout in space.)
---
7: Fallout 3
---
8: Fallout 76
---
9: Fallout: A Post-Nuclear Boardgame
---
10: Fallout Tactics
---
11: Fallout Pen &amp; Paper
---
12: Fallout 4
---
13: Fallout MMO (Fan project)
---
14: Fallout VanBuren (Demo)
---
15: Fallout Shelter
---
16: Fallout Brotherhood of Steel (Xbox)
---
No sarcasm, I’m genuinely happy this works for you. It’s such a niche item and the cherry on top of a 5 hour maintenance day and another Wendigo Collosus delay.
---
I been playing since Beta and everyone dies the same after level 50 anyway.
---
Moving the spawn position to an area other than outside the map us quite literally the easiest bug fix they might ever have to do.
---
Only he literally asked several times for players to not do the event to teach Bethesda. That’s not just an opinion. And I shared mine and he couldn’t handle it. 
---
You even say he outlined why people should feel the same as him. That’s not just sharing an opinion. 
---
I most certainly can tell him to stop posting if he had so many issues with the game that he feels insulted treated like shit.
---
It’s ridiculous that he sticks around if he sees it like that. Completely ridiculous. 
---
That’s the point. His reaction is way over the top.
---
I think this might be free for FO1st members how they have free or things on sale specially for FO1st members. After all, it does not appear in the Fallout 1st section in the atomic shop.
---
The bed and the rug is 1st only.
---
Yeah sales from the Atomic store must be fucking crazy
---
Boo ya. Are you in need of assistance or just someone to explore and shoot the shit? I love camp building and exploring most. I can mess shit up if absolutely necessary, but i prefer casual play (ie im the friend that gets the "im getting bullied" message and goes hunting x])
---
You can have multiple characters on a single account. The have separate stashes so you don’t have to worry about that when you go for the alternate wastelands achievements
---
How was I on their nuts?  I play the game to temporarily distract me from real life. The JFC was about those of you playing the game as if it IS real life and take it that seriously.  You've obviously gotten more than $60 worth if that's the case. They owe you Jack shit.
---
Alright I'll check it out thanks
---
Is the duffel bag made out of nylon?
---
Glad I paid $12 for a pink bed.
---
You can but there is no easy way to transfer to the 2nd character without someone else.
---
So it would go you -&gt; other player - &gt; 2nd toon
---
Do you and I play the same game, that has many bugs that have existed since launch?
---
I understand that. But the new big bad boss is what’s getting most people to play. Not dismissing the other quality off life changes, they are great. But instead of them fixing harmless bugs like the floating walls that builders loved to use. They could spend that time to fix the bigger game features.
---
True, i did silos over a year ago tho, props to every silo runners (came back for wastelanders not so long ago)
---
I'm sure they will fuck up the plan to use the weather machine in Atlas and ignite the atmosphere and create that dogshit gamemode Nuclear Winter.
---
Go to ATLAS, it's updated. Lol
---
I don’t like it. No. It just takes up space, I never deploy it.
---
Yeah this is bullshit. They're not improving the build system they're making it worse.
---
Nobody is asking for changes like this.
---
Nothing new was added other than a community event that rewards less than what you put in for community rewards everyone will receive when they auto-complete them for us.
---
That actually sounds worse.
---
knowing bethesda, trying to do that will result in another big fuck up like trying to fix the 250 DR when reloading bug before wastelanders.
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Just tried it without SFE. I cant save loadouts so, yeah, the mod is useless
---
Same. I always tell my friends that this game has a lot of problems, but the map and the soundtrack aren't one of them.
---
Can't wait until this winter when the BoS arrives.
---
BoS: We're here to save you from the terror of the scorchbeasts.
---
Us: Yeah, dude, we've killed, like, a million of the things. It's no big deal.
---
I'll take the free acid!
---
Nope, 18th Aug I think.
---
The news article I linked says how it’s the monthly item for 1st members. Separate from the sales. Today we have an actually good sale, 80% off coal dust PA
---
Do 5 of your score dailies. Then you'll get that completion
---
Can you donate multiple times? Does it matter?
---
I like the idea of a special key card or something after you've fired a certain number of nukes, but if it's taking a half hour to run a silo when you're experienced, you're doing it wrong. If you lockpick doors, use explosives on the mainframes and hack terminals with berry mentats you can get it down to ten minutes without too much effort. If you bring cores with you you can shave off another minute or two.
---
Doesn't seem like it has live updates though
---
Photo linked says otherwise.
---
I did watch Turtle's video on the event mechanics, so luckily I'm already familiar with what to expect whenever it goes live. Having watched him solo Earle, I'm confident that most instances will be able to take on the event easily enough, despite the tankiness of the Colossus. If anything, I'd probably focus on the Spawns more than Earle, just to make things simpler for the players that I know will have better weapons to handle the event than I currently do.
---
My only concern is over survivability as a bloodied build without a Vampire weapon. I run shotguns, I'm not entirely sure how I'm supposed to keep myself from getting trashed.
---
Thought gold star was completing 5 daily challenges no?
---
Gosh darn it
---
I've just gotten back into fallout so I'm mostly going casual with it, wouldn't mind the company on the road :) thanks
---
&gt;The Meat Week Seasonal Event is returning to Appalachia this month from **August 18 – 24**.
---
ah, this is true.
---
I am slightly less glad lol
---
&gt; Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79. 
---
Where? Regs doesn't seem to have anything new.
---
Yea I literally found it just after posting. Was gonna delete but guess your link might help others 👍
---
it feels awful to use
---
Well before today’s update after you “sell” ammo you could just go back to the previous screen and sell more again.
---
The floater grenades are pretty bad, I usually just throw them at whatever my nearest enemy is as soon as I get them. They have almost no blast but seem to do okay damage if they ever hit. Sooner I can toss them the sooner I get back that wasted space.
---
Yeah, but that doesn't add to the gameplay
---
It was a joke, the devs enjoy the schadenfreude from disappointing their whinging players and laugh when they throw money at atom shop trash regardless.
---
Server hop, rinse, repeat.
---
I thought the SBQ inability to be crippled was getting fixed this patch?
---
The whole game is crippled. 
---
They cant fix anything,  clearly.
---
This whole event is just a junk sink to try and get rid of all the duped junk, the least they could do is give us good rewards
---
FUCKKKK
---
Well all my creative building plans are ruined now :(
---
Nice try Bethesda, Ward is one of those NPCs that simply cannot be told what to do. You say you told him to stay in his trailer for now... but we’ll see what he feels like doing
---
What's better is that this is, effectively, some additional stash space as well. I'm sure someone will do the math for me, but 100,000 points worth of ammo is not insignificant in terms of weight.
---
no.... zero seems right
---
It was supposed to be sarcasm lol, my fault for not clarifying.
---
In my opinion, especially while the Legendary Run is going on, they probably should have compensated testers with a bit of *something* to make up for the time lost in the main game.  There weren't as many people in the PTS this round because most were focused on the Legendary Run.
---
But what that something is, I don't know.  When it was a Private Test Server, limited to invite-only, it would have made sense to comp testers a bit of SCORE or even Atoms for their support.  But in a Public Test Server, that's a good way to get a tsunami of useless feedback-for-the-sake-of-getting-a-reward.
---
The PTS also feels like it often falls on deaf ears.  Valseek, Ladydevann, and Jurassica do what they can to advance things up the chain, but ultimately, there is virtually no presence from the actual dev team, or evidence that they even read the specifics of what we have to say.  At some point, it feels like you're just talking to a wall.
---
Wait, what did they do? You can't make a door into a wall now?
---
Yeah that's where it shows for me, but this guy has a screenshot of it saying it's FO1st. Anyone confirm they don't have FO1st and can claim it?
---
I now nave a Legacy Camp
---
What is meat week
---
Their call, I’m just about to stop playing without even finishing the run.
---
toddhoward@paypal.com
---
I saw the news article after I commented that in my own game. That’s honestly a punch in the gut.
---
Did they “fix” the doubling of walls???
---
I agree, after their blatant refusal to make interior walls a thing since launch it’s stupid to disable the ability to do the double wall glitch. The devs need to make interior walls and door frames a feature that will be free for all players when implemented and they will need to ensure that you can put a different type of wallpaper on each side because we all know that, if they do implement it, there is a chance they will do it in a way where only one wallpaper can be placed on both sides
---
it still feels like i'm clicking through a bunch of screens to get anywhere, and if you don't go pretty slow, you'll almost certainly end up accidentally buying back a bunch of ammo you're in the process of ditching (welcome back 10mm, it's been a whole 8 seconds since i saw you last).
---
you'd have thought simply selecting the max ammo amount exchange would simply sell all, but nope - i can't believe i have to a) remember how much of each ammo type i have before going in, and b) end up having to drop down to smaller increments as it goes on. i'm right back to pulling teeth as i sell 14 or so individual batches of 24 bullets, and doing it incredibly slowly so i don't rebuy the same bullets. and if i go slow, i get placed back to the intro menu and have to click back into the bullet type i want all over again!
---
why on earth isn't there a sell / buy all option? i really don't get the design decisions here at all.
---
Good news for everyone who ordered that collectors edition. They finally got their free duffel bag!
---
couldve spent time patching the endless bugs that the community was suggesting
---
you can save your loadout manually with this [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)   
---
the save data is the Url.
---
Sure, SFE is more convenient but if you can't use it for any reason, you still can have a solution to save your loadout.
---
Like I said were gonna have to see it's all speculation atm
---
LMAO random Redditor that literally doesn't know data miners cracked the code on this a while ago and that it is literally just a toggle that they could turn off with a few clicks. Just because you are in the dark, doesn't mean other people automatically are as well. This has been talked about countless times.
---
Must be a bug,  there's no way this is intentional.
---
There's so many tricks that involve this. Building will now be impossible.
---
Bethesda promising and not delivering is pretty much on point.
---
I have literally never liked the brotherhood except in fallout 3 when they helped people very other group have been raiders with a sense of entitlement that being said I’ll help them if I get something out of it so ya know
---
Didn't have anything happen until last night. Tried to log in, game froze. Hard reboot.
---
Logged in... all but *three* of the quests auto-completed. And of course, one of the ones that didn't was a NW quest that I had no intention of playing. Sigh.
---
It's almost as if they are trying to force us to spend atoms to catch up after we get screwed. But Bethesda wouldn't do that, right?
---
Right????
---
But the community rewards are good
---
This game used level gates to replace the Mk. function of Fallout 4. Technically the leveled armors are the various tiers.
---
yeah at least before I could just keep smashing the button and it would speed convert them and just work it's way down the list of whatever in that category, until all ammo was gone.. This actually takes me longer and have to know what ammo types you have instead of just speeding through it : (
---
Yep. A guy posted yesterday with a cool lighthouse build. Can't do that now, oh well at least he hopefully gets to keep it as a legacy camp.
---
Yeah, much to my surprise It's almost worse. They redid the whole interface so if you were used it before rip. They "increased" the amount you can buy and sell, but if you're under the amount at all it doesn't work. Lol...................................
---
Regs doesn’t have pocketed mods either. Bethesda put again misinformation in the patch note.
---
Hearthstone players thought Blizzard was auto-completing their community event once... They were wrong
---
I actually prefer getting them as loot, instead of having to spend my scrap and floater sacs to craft crappy grenades.
---
All 3 are 1st exclusive? Awful generous, Todd
---
I was playing it earlier today, then 50gb update...
---
This guy Fallouts
---
Davy Jones... great guy. I’m saving all my legacy camps now...
---
No, the duffel bag is free for all players and is really sweet
---
Wasnt Wastelanders like 3 months late?
---
Somehow I have a hard time believing that people play this game specifically just to put wallpaper on two sides of a wall
---
I guess that makes sense, now that you say it.
---
But is there a scrap box as well?
---
im sure the next season will be delayed as per the norm id bank on this season ending end of september.
---
i heard submitting a ticket to support can help some people.
---
Random redditor with a CS degree and understands that you can't just tell someone how their code works without seeing their implementation
---
"JUST DO THIS 4head"
---
Wait, what?! Of all things to fix, why that? It made builds so much better, what's next, fixing the shelving tricks?
---
You can xfer in a private server but it's risky.
---
Procedure is simple:
---
1) login to private server
---
2) pace item(s) into any container
---
3) logout of char A, login to char B
---
4) open same container and pickup items
---
Items are sometimes lost if the server crashes, if you accidentally open adventure, or just because ... Bethesda coding be buggy
---
I would really like there to be an easier way but when I suggested improvements I got flamed and called a hoarder so...guess some ppl don't really want it
---
Stay off the liquor jim. Floating walls have no negative effects on the physics system. Their primary concern with this was players building inaccessible camps in the sky.
---
Is this listed? I’ve had this bug lately where it only lets me switch to recently used. 
---
Sounds crazy but try placing and scrapping one of each wall type then try again with replacing the original wall. Been the bane of my existence for a month having to place walls just so the game knows I can do them
---
Ah. Still quite cool though. Loving the bed in my camp
---
Gotcha. No spoilers or handouts. What level are ya? I have a new toon like level 20 or somethin
---
It was in the patch notes. No bug... 😢
---
I have shady friends that probably have plans but I'm on PS4.
---
Whom ever the designer for this was, they need to leave the videogame industry and work on things that don't take knowledge of use
---
My list is New Vegas, 3, 4, 76. Not a huge fan of online and I just couldnt get into it the same way I did the others. Love the atmosphere and setting of fallout 3 the most but NV has the best dlc and quality improvements
---
Also, reason why the rewards are probably so naff and reason why this goal won't take long to finish, is because dupers are gonna have crap loads of materials stored in their scrapbox. Wether or not they donate it is another thing, but I'm pretty sure Bethesda factored this in. I feel the donation amount would have been lower and the rewards better if not for dupers.
---
It’s listed under patch notes... 😢
---
The CAMP building system is finicky as hell to begin with...then they have to go and remove the few ways we're able to work around that?
---
FFS, why did this have to be "fixed" as opposed to the huge list of actual bugs that actually affect people's gameplay that have been a problem for months.
---
Agreed, and on top of that, they’re pretty much the only item worth getting the junkyard pack for, and they didn’t even have the courtesy of adding the outhouse and drinking fountain to the package.
---
I’m not ‘Karening’ it up, I have worked in the service industry for a long time so don’t disrespect me like that, I’ve not been horrible to you so there is no reason to be rude like that, to be promised something and then be disappointed is completely different to entitlement to something that’s not ours to begin with 
---
We as a community have very little ways to communicate with Bethesda but we have somewhat of a voice here on Reddit, if no one bats an eyelid to them continuously disappointing us then they assume it’s ok. If their customers and the people providing them with their profits make it clear to them that this is not ok and is disappointing their fan base, there is more of a chance of this not happening again in the future
---
Then no... you cant have for free what I have to pay for
---
Let's make this the 1st of many posts then.
---
I'm pissed as well. I had to stash my camp due to their camp skin not working and then they fuck my ability to rebuild it.
---
Everyone keeps saying "read the patch notes", but we know they are never accurate. First thing I did was go to Regs to get my deep pockets, but nope, nothing.
---
I might do it, just to let out frustration. I've been such an adamant defender of this game but ever since Wastelanders I've been let down more and more. Everything is getting delayed, real issues aren't being  addressed, PTS is basically a waste, I have no hope for One Wasteland at this point.
---
Gosh darn it. I’m gonna try my way and see if this was just them pretending the camp big is a feature now
---
Yo you wouldn't happen to have a link to those data mined loot tables, wouldya?
---
My friend had that same problem. For me I tried using high rate of fire weapons just to try and get the hits in so it would count. My sniper could try it but I don't think she'd get enough damage in.
---
Me too! Please stop, as well as missles and mini nukes
---
Exactly! Like what the fuck dude. They literally took 0 effort to put in this game, and charge a ridiculous price for the pleasure.
---
Yea....ill fig something out maybe get game pass and create a new account for one of my kids lol
---
It's just a new check logo. Unless it's greyed out it's not
---
That would be because a healthy amount of the creative team from the original Fallout franchise worked on Wasteland 2 (And upcoming Wasteland 3)
---
You're allowed to have your own opinion but not everyone wants the same spec for armor as you. I personally use sturdy frame and share it so it doesn't weigh as much. I only use DP on armor because I like picking stuff up.
---
LOL.  It never fails.
---
I mean tactics didn't have Brian Fargo working on it like Wasteland 2 did.
---
Pocketed and Deep Pocketed are apparently still missing. I'll check in a minute or so.
---
Checked, can confirm. Only the plans for the Torso are there.
---
This company can't do anything right, fuck.
---
AKA these items are worthless and there’s no point in donating
---
At least it's not a fucking reskin for  The Ranger armor
---
Unfortunately not :/ 
---
I guess you'd just have to transfer some scrap to your stash, I ended up doing that.
---
I’m not even using a more broken unarmed build, but anytime I’ve done quest content I have had to switch to a rifle without changing my perks out just so it feels like a fight. Mobs are just too weak now.
---
My guess is we haven’t seen the end of Modus, but I have a feeling it won’t be an enclave revival as much as him being the reason we have fractured dawn. Finds a way to weaken the BoS or turn them against one another.
---
I've been playing the same character I started on, I think I just hit 42? I'm doing a melee build on other and I think I just hit 16 on that
---
Double walls are... patched???
---
Literally the only reason I still buy atoms and play the game as much ad I do is to perfect and build different camps, this is actually such a big deal to me I may stop playing if they meant to do this.
---
Just waited for the Servers to Go Up again so i can rebuild my Camp.... Well here goes my Plan...
---
Yeah this is nonsense. Everyone should submit tickets reporting all these new features as bugs. Maybe then they would get that we don't want MORE building restrictions.
---
You just barely ninja'd me Meathead
---
So if you had double walls with wallpaper will they be reverted back to just one wall upon logging in and loading up?
---
Even the Npcs love it [https://imgur.com/ysghYfp](https://imgur.com/ysghYfp)
---
They should put their least pissed off intern on Nuclear Winter and just start developing it little by little. Currently, they have 0 resources on this game mode.
---
I think the issue is that we're giving up useful scrap (well, except for the cork) in order to receive these sub-par rewards, as opposed to just participating in events.
---
I don't have a problem with it, you get useful stuff, and stuff you can sell, in exchange for the scrap.  But if you're scrambling to keep up with your steel for repairs/bullets, it probably won't be useful.
---
The people complaining are mostly high level people that want rewards they can use, they're not interested in being part of the overall community.
---
Has to be exact amount. Devs don't care. Ima dip back off into NW and cry.
---
Duper’s aren’t going to donate. They have all those plans already and all that junk will be used for a trade and not rebuilding Atlas.
---
If the progress of the challenge is like 0/3 then its not completed even if you see the tick on all the challenges.
---
I just had a look, I don't see it, would you mind copying it and posting here? Not saying you're wrong but I just can't see them doing this on purpose.
---
I did about 2k steel, they obv don't play this game, and everything they've added to the game that was not on the PTS to get feedback has been totally screwed up.
---
It'd be nice but I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
So let´s recap "update 21". The event they promised for 3-4 months is postponed again and the event they release is garbage. I am so glad i gave up this shit and went RDR2 to check their new season pass and naturalist role.
---
Even so i tough maybe i will log in to donate some scraps and try for a BoS paint or something for my camp but that list is bullshit just like this game and the joke here is not Todd and Bethesda, the joke is YOU that are reading this MAD read to downvote, the joke is that you still care about this company.
---
This game is nothing but a bugged reskin of Fallout 4 made as a cash cow with  a mobile game transaction business model. 
---
Listen to me, they will NEVER get it right, they will abandon this crap before fixing it and they will milk this cow for every single cent before doing it.
---
Again with the experience now people know what happens, that they give deadlines and never stick to them, better to not disappoint the community continuously
---
Not gonna lie lost a bit of interest but gonna donate some just to help out
---
Give me the full monty!
---
I’m donating once each week so I get the freebies, but the brotherhood of can’t be assed to scavenge can whistle after that. We all gotta scavenge for our supplies, why should they get to sit in their tin cans doing sweet FA while I knock my bollocks off. (I’ve never been a fan of the BOS btw)
---
Don't worry, we have billions materials for the community. :)
---
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/561314487068524603/740260218306429058/image0.png
---
Does 2-shotting make that much difference? 5mm and .50cal are literally the most efficient ammunition crafts in the game.
---
Are you on PC? Just press Escape.
---
Man all I want is the ability to craft em. Give us the nuka crafting benches from fallout 4 ;-;
---
Has this been patched????
---
He’s not calm. Does he really need to be instilled and say how he’s being treated like shit? How is that being calm when someone is literally making those claims.
---
First you tell me that I can’t tell him to stop. Now your telling me how I should post.
---
Very hypocritical.
---
Hold down B and you’ll back out of the terminal. Works with every terminal in the game
---
Didn't they block throwing knives from being sell-able shortly after release?
---
&gt;  There was an enforced scarcity to the gifts that rationalized their having rare plans you couldn't get anywhere else.
---
Enforced as in they allowed mass duping of gifts for months until finally patching it, then having a ban wave where they ended up unbanning almost all of them without even wiping the dozes of duped god-tiers and hacked weapons they had? Enforced scarcity where people still have mules with thousands of gifts? That kind of scarcity?
---
How did you know I'm on the toilet?!?
---
It still works, they just fucked up the icon for it now.
---
It's not, it's just a new check logo. How can you not test anything out before hand jesus
---
I checked the headlamp, but I unfortunately don't have the plan for the red one for t60, I'm sorry.
---
I'm thinking you might be able to get the plan from a vendor, I'll check around for you.
---
You can still do double walls so not sure what you mean??? 
---
Sorry know what you mean now... Can't convert them back to walls from the doorway
---
50 pounds of grenades is omega cool especially when you **can’t fucking sell them**
---
That’s why I posted it. I’m still in build mode trying to find a work-around. Fairly solid, at least on PC...
---
Yes I use floater grenades and I enjoy using them. Gnasher poisoning is insanely strong on most enemies.
---
70360840
---
What’s the post about then? Saw another post and now I’m testing I can’t convert walls to doorways
---
In terms of ammo efficiency, not really since as you said  5mm is practically free.
---
But Its going to be good for speedfarming the score level up daily, as well as general safety of killing them before they kill you.
---
That list basically points the middle finger to higher level players that have been playing for a while. Looks like it was made to pull in all the new players who joined on the pass. Guess I’ll go back to hoarding bullion in hopes they release something that doesn’t suck.
---
You can donate as many times as you want, I watched someone donate ~100K steel just a bit ago.
---
Oh I didn't know. And where do I put the saved URLs?
---
Im looking at my helmet rn it says. "Prevents damage and disease from airborne hazards" what am I not understanding here..?
---
They were raid drops. They got rid of the raid and then thats it. There was no actual justifiable reason.
---
Edit: Think of it as collateral damage.
---
You get the atoms on your subscription renewal date, regardless of time of the month.
---
Thank you !
---
No need for actual bugs, they fucked the building system so badly by implementing more "cannot place" restrictions that they don't need to accidentally fuck anything else up this time.
---
It's almost like they want you to spend money for cosmetics
---
Ooh I didn’t realize they got them all! I’ll have to look for that.
---
Thanks, I'm kinda new to reddit as well so it's just a struggle to get used to so many rude people, I don't really understand what makes people so rude for no reason. I cant imagine using other human beings as a punching bag like so many do. But thanks :) people like you give hope
---
How do you trigger Forbidden Knowledge 5- 10 times a day? I can only trigger it once
---
Yeah but I like the icon to pop up for NW or adventure so people know where I’m fighting someone
---
Nope. Not there, and hopped servers to confirm.
---
Exactly. It was a non-issue that didn’t need to be addressed.
---
I just claimed a workshop, yeah you can sn only change the texture. 
---
Fuck.sake.
---
I still can't get my tent placement correct for that.
---
Am I blind or are the secret service pocketed mods not on regs?
---
You get Atoms at the beginning of your “month” cycle. So if you sign up today you’ll get some right away but won’t get anymore until the 30 day period passes and your subscription renews for another month.
---
I disagree. The only even marginally difficult to find junk type on the upcoming list is concrete, and even then it's pretty easy to grind for. Most of the other junk variants are either insanely abundant or practically useless. (Wtf am I gonna use glass and leather for?) I'm glad they're finally giving us something to do with our excess worthless junk, but the rewards are a bit lacking. You can find all of those items lying around in bags pretty commonly, just cuz of the recent gift dupe.
---
Add 10x and 100x for selling/buying.
---
People will usually often barricade off their vendors if they're at or near max caps, but it's really frustrating when they leave them powered due to people being misled into travelling there for no reason.
---
Agreed. This sub goes between "helping others is cool!"  to being entitled brats. I'm all for shitting on Bethesda for crap that hasn't been fixed or implemented (trade window and fast travel camp points, I'm looking at you), but not wanting to donate because the community rewards don't benefit them is just selfish.
---
 [https://roguetrader.com/#/dashboard](https://roguetrader.com/#/dashboard) 
---
Codes on there are good for another 3 hours. :)
---
It isn’t a question of difficulty but rather time.  They have already increased the time by no longer allowing explosive weapons to knock off multiple mainframe cores at once and by making them have weight so we can no longer prepare them ahead of time without sacrificing 45 lbs of carry weight.  As there is literally no benefit for making it longer I don’t see why they would do this.
---
I am by no means holding an uncommon opinion on this.  Most nukes I know about were launched through glitching.   Getting rid of this would be as stupid as making everyone collect all the codes and decrypt them individually.
---
What happens to that junk if your 1st sub doesn't renew, though? I was just going to grind and donate everything I picked up anyway, so it's not like I'd be hoarding anything. Unless you can still access the stashbox after a sub fails to renew, until that junk is used/removed. If that was the case, I may consider it further.
---
As for the atoms... The only things I've ever picked up from the Atmoic Shop was the original Liberty Prime power armor skin bundle, and a single camp set of floor and wall skins. As great as the atoms are, I just don't have much of a use for them, personally.
---
He is calm. He's not yelling, cursing, etc. Again, do you need to curse? I don't think so. It's not getting you anywhere. But again, that's my opinion. If you don't like it, don't listen to it. Just like the OP's. Have a good one.
---
They are probably at max caps, people like to do that because they don't want to turn them off and people can still buy when they are off
---
He could also be maxed on caps so if you bought something he would lose money i see this alot its why I try to always have room if someone buys a big ticket item
---
Have you tried turning them off, waiting thirty seconds, and then turning it back on again?
---
But that would mean--- my god! You're crumbling everything I've ever believed in!
---
This is so rubbish....
---
The daft thing is, I place a floor, I then snap a door to it and I can STILL remove the floor!
---
So floating walls are still possible!
---
Yeah my bad thought he was saying we can't wallpaper both sides.
---
The provisions aren't the fucking reward.  The community goals are the reward and they're already on par with or exceed the random grab bag of rewards we got from killing Scorched for last years community goals and people completed that shit without any provisions or whining about it.
---
Huh
---
Thats what I do, turn them into mines and toss them like crazy or sell them.
---
I think you're underestimating and underappreciating just how much junk they have. 30,40,50k ect is a drop in the ocean to them.
---
Donating for nothing.
---
"Im a dataminer dude! I'm practically a qualified developer!"
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
You find one technical data, then go turn it in, then you have to find another somewhere in the world and it will trigger it again. Unfortunately you can’t collect a bunch and go turn them in separately so I’d go to west tec, ams headquarters, whitespring bunker, and nuke silos to find them.
---
That is the one for last week. Is it still valid after the update? Not sure when exactly the codes reset
---
I have heard, at least it's some new content. Funny thing is after all of this being done on my end I'm more upset about the colossal problem ingame being delayed last minute than my colossal problem irl as thankfully no major damage was done.
---
There an idea, I was kinda hoping for an enclave vs BoS update kinda like how wastelanders makes you choose between factions. Maybe Modus has you re-establish connection with outside enclave forces. So many possibilities really, I also wouldn't mind seeing the children of atom move in, or a similar cult based dlc, mothman maybe.
---
I guess new players will have something to look forward to.
---
It didn’t even occur to me,  tbh. I thought dupers would be only concerned with weapons/outfits stuff. Good point.
---
Glad you enjoyed it. Being honest I don't really care for the Brotherhood, I find them a little bland because I've never been a big fan of military stuff or the idea of tech Knights. That said, they have always been an, admittedly surly and sometimes unkind/rough, force for good in Fallout. At least in so much as they step up to face threats to humanity. So, i'm generally willing to give the faction it's due respect, even if I find them dull.
---
Try it with a solid or window wall
---
i thought i could sell 100 10mm, but its actually 100x the amount that they used to let you sell (So like 24 maybe) so when you select that option youre actually selling 2400 10mm. This shit is so wild
---
Because new players have so much spare scrap right? Clearly this event was aimed at vets to lower the junk stockpiles but the rewards are not in line with that goal at all. No vets giving up junk for literally no reward.
---
Your solution for a break from grinding is to add on an even more ridiculous form of worthless grinding? O_o
---
"Rare" is subjective, seeing as whats rare is only going to be rare for the first few days. Those plans are most likely going to be saved for the actual quest line. Im fine with the rewards being what they are, as the purpose of the event is the community rewards.
---
Dasy Cutter
---
Yeah u/valseek whoever is in charge of the decisions for Fallout 76 could not be more out of touch with the playerbase if they where a gramophone attempting to play a .mp3.  They need to go.
---
I have a decent stock of scrap from being a 1st player.  And I have no inventive to drop even 1 piece of it into this event.
---
Doing the same thing just not as much I'm in the end game and just lvl and mat grinding
---
Excuse me: GRAMMAR PATRIOTS 😁
---
It collects Dirty water with max storage of 2. Is it worth it? For the looks yes, for what it gives not so much.
---
Edit, corrected an issue on my end.
---
Thanks! Didn't know exactly at what time the codes reset
---
I had it explained to me this way. The less tied to the real world you a social media presense is, the more likely people with ill will or feelings will be to show those character flaws with little to no chance of repercussion. Ive never connected the dots on who i am in the real world but i honestly act the same in life, game, work, ECT. Genuinity, true unbridled honesty is far rarer than lithium gold or platinum.
---
Glad to give you hope AND.... Ill tell you about an incredibly Non-toxic Reddit group. I stumbled on their page a few months ago and all the cats ive met are good to the core. "Peace keepers of Appalachia"
---
Its almost as if I explicitly mentioned dupers in the sentence immediately preceding that quote... weird.
---
It’s another S tier weapon or armor piece for that amount of junk. They won’t be throwing it away for plans that they can just open presents for. The goal won’t be met, but you will get your rewards.
---
You sound weirdly bitter. 
---
It is what it is, man. If you want to continue being annoying and wrong, please go right ahead! You brought your ego into this, no one else.
---
Yep not there lol. Is this a joke?
---
Happened to me yesterday. Hadn't played in two days. Tried to log in, game froze. Hard reboot. 
---
Logged in, all but three quests autocompleted.
---
Sigh.
---
September, bethesda sucks again 👍🏻

It's not just you he is being a dick too. He has been going on a rant on various posts on here about this event. He feels that his opinion is only the correct one and that everyone else needs to shut up about the subpar rewards we get for donating to the BOS.
---
Good guess.  That's what it looks like.
---
Did one lot then decided Id rather make bullets with my 5k steel.  Pointless
---
As someone with well over 1000 hours on my main, I agree that the rewards are lackluster (unless you *LOVE* booze).  But for people that haven't been playing that long, some of the rewards are not common.
---
I think cork will be a bit of a pain to get, I have a much easier time with concrete than with that.  But I'm not in it for the rewards, or the caps (and the rewards seem to give a pretty decent amount), so I'll probably just donate to weed out the junk pile a bit.
---
Hahaha thanks man for taking one for the team. Love this response :)
---
yes that's very clear, I thought it was sick as hell when it said it protected from both air+water and didn't know that was incorrect.  sheesh
---
Oh ok, thanks. :)
---
You have a string replacer that hasn't updated yet. Rename the \\strings folder in your Fallout 76\\Data folder until the mod author releases an update.
---
I think your be wrong on this one, but we're see 😎👍
---
That sounds super nice :) thank you so much
---
lmao! I'm sorry! (not really)
---
Yup :) it does clip through a little on the black cowboy hat however
---
Post OP makes a good point; DURING the event, those pails and gifts were annoying as hell to get. That's scarcity. What a shitty player base does shouldn't get blamed on the developers. Im all for shitting on Bethesda, but this really is one of those rare moments of "blame the player not the game".
---
I must be the only mad fucker who bought them with bullion (along with flares from Samuel) just because I think the noises the floaters make are hilarious.
---
On top of that, the Flamer grenades are extremely powerful. The Freezer ones are great for the Queen if you don't have a Cryolater, the Gnasher ones do poison DoT, and anyone with a brain knows how OP poison is after Wastelanders.
---
Their weight is perfect because it's incentive to use them, or you know, you could just not pick them up and move on with your day.
---
Yes. Just got it and wearing a skiing hat with it.
---
Cot dangit and that's the reason I logged on today.
---
True, I wasn't thinking of the overall rewards, those are fine as well (though not a great interest to me *personally*).  
---
I really don't have any huge issues with the whole situation.  I'm not terribly surprised that a subset of the higher level players are whining though, since this wasn't something that was designed *specifically with them in mind*.  The game has a ton of new players, and you have to look at them as well.
---
Yeah I learned that today
---
Ultra-light in there for Torso but nothing else
---
I found him standing in a bed, as in he was on the middle of a bed with half his body phased through it.
---
The community goals suck. Who is turning over thousands of any scrap for some stupid event they would have given us anyway.
---
Did they really fuck up challenges 3 updates in a row?
---
I'm dreading their 'fix' for the stacking shelves trick next.
---
 You can still take junk out  but can't add.
---
They also changed it with this update that it uses junk from your scrap box before you stash
---
As for the atoms, you never what they might add.
---
Icons would probably be appealing and worth the atoms if they gave you a flag along with it.
---
Door walls cannot be replaced with solid walls so no more glitching camp into circular form. Only beautiful squares and cubes from now on
---
This is the first major plan drop event since game pass. It does little to appeal to old players but will fire up new ones. If the community wants to get the community gifts we'd better donate. Those who are sitting on 50k+ steal (me) doesn't need that and it can be used to help the community event.
---
Nice. I've received mod plans, but never an actual armor plan. I had to dig up hundreds of treasures maps to finally complete the set.
---
I put walls in front of mine when I’m near max caps but it only stays like that for about 30 minutes while I splurge 10k caps at random vendors
---
Yeah. It's my kind of fireworks.
---
I’ll take them
---
Nice, I had like 800, though I'm only on my second month of FO1st (and that's after complaining about it for months...before I got furloughed for a month and had a LOT of time on my hands :P ).  
---
I think I'm near 1000 now.  I'll be really looking for those golf balls and pipe weapons from now on!
---
Also clips through the witch's hat. :( Still looks cool from a distance, though!
---
The original comment has positive karma and the reply agreeing with it has negative karma. I don't get this sub.
---
the poodle skirt and hip glasses would be sweet, please and thank you.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
Not real time though.
---
Bethesda clearly loves the Anthem loot table model.
---
I haven't found any since wastelanders and its really annoying because I still dont have all the PA paints
---
It’s worse now than before this “fix”
---
That’s great, ty
---
Just checked myself and they are not there.
---
It likely drops plans that you already got from doing the event if your stupid enough to validate this bullshit event.
---
Say it in game lol
---
They also "fixed" the ability to turn already created walls into doorways, which is just tonedeaf.  
---
If it also doesn't work in reverse I'll be bloody pissed. Placing two doorways back to back and then converting them into regular walls to make interior rooms was the only way I'd found to make interior rooms without having one wall be an outer wall.   
---
Do the devs even play this game? More and more it seems like they don't.
---
Definitely not enough. Issues like SBQ crippling or adrenaline being broken should have been fixed within a few days, no more than a week, yet adrenaline was fixed today and the queen hasn’t been able to be crippled in 3 and a half months. It’s honestly sad
---
WWHHHAAAAAAAT??
---
I was positive it was going to stay at 20 atoms forever to make sure no one would just sit and grind for it!
---
Honestly had no clue about that! Thank you
---
Yeah, but no wendigo colossus as teased, nonono we can't have that! Double sided walls? BEGONE
---
The Welcome Home sign
---
Wow. If I get to almost a year of game time played. I can get less than half of a PA skin
---
I mean they added the ability to get secret service armor and fixers from random bullshit events and there is (eventually) a new endgame boss raid with all new rewards but everybody has to bitch because they threw the new players a bone with the gathering event.
---
Very cool friend, you have skills
---
Oh FFS. 
---
How many times will they cripple camp building?
---
They fucked up the legendary board progress menu (PS4), lol. How is it even possible. The frames drop down so bad it's stuttering.
---
I agree, it was the one thing I was pumped for!
---
Works for me!
---
Really can't get my head around why they'd do this
---
Just go vendor hopping. You'll find all the ones you can get from the pails/presents soon enough-- they're common vendor trash at this point.
---
What I mean is, do you get more rewards by donating 1 at a time vs 100k all at once.
---
Agreed. They should be edible with the Cannibal perk, too.
---
*There can be only one*...
---
You could force the lock. I know there were specific mods though that let you smash in doors.
---
Bethesda are really into the Anthem idea of making players suffer for nothing in return but promises of "soon".
---
If that’s your reply then you’ve lost. Shit is a swear word just as fuck is. 
---
He’s upset. No one that states they are insulted and tired of being disrespected feels that way because they aren’t upset. 
---
Sorry but your a hypocrite if you think his swearing is ok and mine isn’t. And your being willfully ignorant if you think he’s not upset.
---
Why donate steel when you can check suitcases by white springs and find the same plans for nothing?
---
it normally says that when you don't have enough pal
---
Iirc the prospectors hat looks really nice. I know there is at least one nice black hat that works with it but I can't log on to check (freaking download speed on the update has me locked out for another 6 hours)
---
This is the first thing I actually want redone asap. I Love building in this game but this Cuts out so many Options :(
---
Yes it does..  100x means 100 times the Amount of a single trade in.  So that 3 mini-nukes  = 1, means 100 = 300 mininukes.. it's not the amount of teh single ammo
---
But then players enjoy something, and do not suffer.   Bethesda loves Anthem.
---
I’m curious about Modus. He seems to think little of humans, practically a hive mind thanks to his connection to many whitesprings robots, but his reach is extremely limited. I do hope they plan to do more with him. Biggest issue that I think the lore fans will have is BoS isn’t supposed to know about the Enclave. However, it could be that the BoS loses this war eventually and that’s why we never hear of a WV chapter later on.
---
Power armor skins are overpriced
---
It is certainly nasty laggy.
---
If it's nylon well get another one in 6 months that's real canvas. Win win win
---
Yeah, but nowhere near the level of the gifts, which is why people are still giving up tons of rate shit for the croc backpack.
---
/u/Ladydevann You guys added the light/Ultra-light and pocketed/deep pocketed for the SS Chest but I dont see them at all for the limbs
---
It says you added deep pocket but I can't find them anywhere on any server.
---
I have a single set of stairs I can't remove. It's only connected to the one floor piece, but it stubbornly refuses to scrap.
---
Was only 8gb for me on Xbox
---
😏😏🤫
---
Just got on to try it and immediately accidentally bought 3 mini nukes.  What the hell are they doing over there?
---
I was gonna do the event. But I've changed my mind rewards are damn disappointing
---
I'm a for it, but I have no drive no reason to donate. I don't get rewarded for it. Exp s.c.o.r.e. nothing. 
---
I'll donate to get more days added to meat week or full double exp days. But what I'm getting now, made me stop doing s.c.o.r.e. all together. This "event" is a huge letdown.
---
You're assuming a lot about their code that you haven't even seen. Any actual developer is never going to say with confidence "just do this" to someone's code before they've even looked at it.
---
And it's Fallout 76. I really doubt they keep a well structured repository of their code LMAO
---
It's not medieval, but I started wearing the bowler with the mask and Arktos lab coat. Gives just enough of a wtf? look.
---
If you wanna get rid of them faster just throw em. I normally save them for when I do a SBQ and get rid of them all there
---
How would they do that? Wouldn't you have to place your camp device somewhere on actual terrain? Even if you are smart enough to take advantage of the vertical aspect of your camp area, it would only get you up so many floors, certainly not into "the sky".
---
You can only donate 250 at a time, and the rewards are a 'gift box' for each 250.  You can only donate 250 per turn-in.
---
No problem! That site has been a lifesaver for me for finding when codes reset and the current codes. :)
---
yeah but I got 2000+ of the same ammo type
---
Does it protect you like a gas mask?
---
Works with the bowler, as well.
---
Oh yeah gotta ultralight all your armor and strip down weapons to base you’ll save 50%+ on storage!
---
Shortly after commenting this, I read elsewhere that they've changed it and you automatically get a key (different name) when you complete the quest!
---
Adding those unlocked rewards is actually pretty legit. I got 2 decent fixers and my top bloodied plasma caster from Fasnacht rewards. 
---
The community event is just a little tone deaf if anyone on the dev team actually plays this game they would know that using the term rare in reference to the loot pool here is not very accurate.
---
Not only that bit you can get the fixer and secret service armor from random bullshit events (providing you already know the plans).
---
Would be nice.  I was at 18k yesterday then all of a sudden was sitting at 27k while I was out doing my daily stuff.  Need to cut the power to my vendor
---
Read the Bethesda releases maybe?
---
Update was 8g but had to delete 40g to download it.
---
Technology.
---
Is it just me or have I already seen all these rewards multiple times, aka they’re not adding anything new ?
---
Well that was unexpected &amp; accurate...
---
EDIT: TMI? My bad. But I appreciated the reading material.
---
I've seen 2 of these posts, get a hold of yourself people.
---
lol me too - i wish they were more dynamic as well - pretty lack luster effects associated with them
---
That's not the code, that's version control.
---
The data miners said it's even easier than what I have described, so it's pretty much a moot point. One keyword deletion according to people who have seen it.
---
Does it look pretty cool? Was thinking about getting it
---
Bethesda really are the masters of half arsed.
---
How about no? This patch is pure hell
---
YOU have no interest in a show
---
Oh no!
---
I think alot of people would disagree with you, including me. After what wayside has made. Compared to the resources and budget that they had. I think the producers of the TV show have no excuse to make a half assed, soulless POS show. I just hope Beth doesn't pull a Disney and give there resources to a producer with no past of the game
---
If we think it’s a cool idea then why would that person be fired?
---
You tried to mod the limbs yet?
---
I’m reading reports on the Bethesda forums that players are logging in to find their camp location is bare and all of their built items are “stored”
---
first of all,i agree that would be great. Reason for these restrictions is server stability though with their engine.
---
Pretty much garbage. Still no T-60 plans, you'd think that would make sense.
---
Don't worry, we are getting double side walls for 1000 atoms soon
---
Wonder if we'll still get complaints every week about how this challenge should actually reward even *more* Atoms.
---
(if it awarded a seriously desirable amount of Atoms, people would just AFK a whooole lot more to get it quick. they don't want to encourage clogging up servers with AFK'ers)
---
Green hood works might be medieval?
---
In patch 45, we find out this game was Minecraft all along
---
Seriously breaks my heart...that's my end game, man...
---
Mine is fine and I hope it stays that way lol don't want to log out now
---
Same only 8gb
---
What is even their reason for fixing this? All the building glitches shouldn't impact the game so idk why they would care enough to fix this when there are actual issues
---
It clips through the forehead...it clips through most of the hats. I love that mask, but it just clips.
---
I like the lab coat idea
---
Wait, do you still get the bonus, so can you stack it with the under armor?
---
"Only $12 for something lying around since FO4..."

---
Some bugs in this game, enhance the game more than the devs realize such as the double-wall trick, shelf trick, rug trick, and more. Yes, they are bugs but until they fix the root reason as to why these are heavily used they are not doing themself any justice by "fixing" these bugs. The same can be said with the nuclear winter rewards unlock bug, this caused an influx of nuclear winter players since there was a bunch of rewards to earn, and with that bug being a patch, I foresee that game mode dying back down a bit. Sometimes they only shot themselves in the foot by patching bugs that are really not an issue like the double door bug.
---
How about quit your bitching? There is quite a bit of positive changes to this update, asshats like you just have to cry about every little nitpicky detail without ever once acknowledging the good.
---
You get them as rewards on some events and I’m a melee build and loot as I kill so don’t see what I’m taking. Lol I don’t purposely pick them up, I’m not that mad lol.
---
I guess I’ll find out when I get home.
---
For PC use the ESC key to get out of the terminal.
---
I've never played Meat Week nor watched anything about it, how does it work?
---
I’d happily give them
---
Possibly. But it also happens to every corpse that’s not looted. Some people just don’t want to pick up the loot and when the body despawns the loot stays. There are a ton of guns all over the floor in front of the sonic generator due to the line in the sand event glitch. I go there sometimes just to pick up weapons for quick scrap or caps
---
Also been looking, doesn't appear to have actually been added as far as I can tell
---
It works!
---
Hi all, Pocketed/Deep Pocketed mods were intended to be available for Secret Service armor in this patch, we're looking into why they aren't. Sorry about the wait on these, we'll get them in game as soon as we can!
---
The bad is the event(s) they have put on the roadmap and have been trying to get people excited for. The good is a minor patch note that frankly just makes sense. And the good can also be questioned further into why can't we get the learned plan items from regular world drops off legendary enemies? Why must they be limited to event rewards or purveyor drops?
---
Wait for the cork donation period :P
---
I couldn't find it either... I just downloaded rat monkeys strings as a placebo  but would much have Kits version since it's far superior IMO.
---
And how many caps will buy you the BoS beret and fatigues or the BoS collectron station?  How many caps do you have to pay Bethesda for a purveyor sale?
---
The. Provisions. Are. Not. The. Fucking. Reward. The. Community. Goals. Are.
---
You're not listening. You can't just tell a team of developers to do something with their code **that you have not seen or reviewed**.
---
I know what version control is. And I guarantee you the FO76 team has not done it properly. And their code is definitely spaghetti.

Oof, that's rough. You're going to be rubberbanding like crazy and enemy health will probably just keep refilling back to full over and over.
---
You know what, I recently discovered this wall glitch and had an epiphany that you could potentially make double armored walls for use in NW or workshop defences blueprints. I hate that this game always takes a step in the wrong direction, building and the quirks it has is one of the most fun and relaxing things to do in this game.
---
Why this?!? Why focus this issue? There are hundreds of guns that are straight busted. They choose to fuck with the CAMP system. 🙃
---
They fixed an issue with door frames so maybe it wasn't meant?
---
 **Walls:** Fixed an issue where doorway walls could be hard to place under roofs and upper floors.
---
What Is the good? Tesla arcs are broken, mission autocomplete is broken, ammo converter is broken. Do I have to continue?
---
Nope, it is just a cosmetic clothing item now without perks/stats
---
Dunno why you're getting down voted, you're telling the truth.
---
Got some butthurt "where are my rare plans that I can trade for bloodied fixers" in the crowd
---
So, that bow bug, wherein you're prevented from using the pipboy or activating world objects? 
---
That's caused by aiming, immediately shooting then releasing the button in rapid succession and can be fixed by pulling it out again, aiming (or charging a shot if you can't aim) then putting it away again.
---
I got like 3 grenades and a radaway, fucking cheers mate
---
That doesn't make sense, that it's added in the patch notes but not into the game 🤦 i was atleast excited about that
---
most likely new comers, mid-new, non-fallout 1st members, brotherhood of steel fans, and  ppl w/ no space for junk may contribute more. Most veteran players who have the luxury of fallout 1st &amp; can care less about BOS; i can see how using their own saved up resources for no worthwhile reward to them is enough. im one of then and hope dupers fill out the rest of the junk required. Hopefully Bethesda eventually makes adjustments as usual e.g. the legendary run double score events too. I’m happy there’s still other content in the horizon for me to look forward to &amp; keep me interested
---
An entire weekend for 2-3 hours?
---
Double stack linings?

Oh damn, that sucks.

I KNEW I WAS RELOADING SLOWER SOMETIMES BUT I COULDNT FIGURE OUT WHY. I THOUGHT I WAS JUST IMAGINING IT.

killing scorchbeasts was fun. grinding steel/concrete and cork and give it to some BOS fanboy ? 
---
no thanks.

Got a prime receiver plan for western revolver
---
Also vintage Nuka shine
---
People complain when the amount of atoms is too low. People complain when the amount of atoms is too high. Jesus.
---
Building was one of the last things that kept me logging in. They just stripped a lot of creativity away from people.
---
Oh that sucks.
---
Try changing them to walls...
---
How many suitcases do you have to open before you find a BoS collectron station plan?  How many do you need to open up before everyone gets 50% off at the purveyor?
---
Ah, okay
---
This exactly!  Who prioritizes their bug backlog?   Makes no sense.
---
It is
---
Can't find them either... Well i should be used to it by now but still after they postponed the wendigo collossus again. This was the one thing j was happy about
---
✊🏻
---
Why did bethesda make it so we lose sleep over if we are going to make it or not? I missed one day so far and i get anxiety attacks from this. Please bethesda see this and make the next Legendary run easier and more casual. Just double the amount of score on everything or something.
---
Did you ever convert your elven arrows to sun kissed in skyrim?
---
Yeah I don't get this. It was harmless fun, why the hell fix harmless fun but don't fix the many hundreds of annoying game ruining bugs.
---
You mean Lifegiver + Speed Demon?  If so, it was mentioned in the notes.
---
It looks cool, but it has a problem where the top of the mask clips through most hats.
---
The issue I have is similar, with two of the same weapon, even if named and modded differently, upon a fresh load I find that only one is favourited, instead of both like they should be.
---
How is the ammo converter broken? Worked just fine for me. 
---
Is it really broken or is it just not up to your satisfaction?
---
0. They will auto complete it and everyone will get it anyways.
---
Adding ultracite PA mod plans and BOS T-60 paints to the drop pool would be a quick, low effort fix that would make these drops useful for more people. Those plans are fairly rare, and they did say rare plans would be the draw. Lore-friendly too since BOS was responsible for ultracite PA development.
---
Don't worry, the Pocketed and Deep Pocketed plans aren't even the game, so...
---
I expect to get rare plans when it says rare plans, not some shit i can find in the world.
---
**Walls:** Fixed an issue where doorway walls could be hard to place under roofs and upper floors.
---
That fix has probably caused it
---
Thanks :) might not get it if it clips, having to make the decision between the mask and the nuka cola door bundle, unfortunately can't afford both, so if it clips I might give it a pass.
---
When they say "rare plans", then yeah, I'd expect something cool. I feel sorry for the people who only read the blog and don't see the actual drop tables here.
---
The Old Fisherman's hat works pretty well, even with longer hairstyles
---
"you can't assume they have bad version control because you haven't seen it"
---
Buddy we all do it, but getting all uppity about it doesn't matter.
---
I've read enough from online to know that the queen is a single keyword call, so without looking at their code I can assume things based on my experience like you can with yours.
---
I give my feedback nothing more just like everybody else does. So while I haven't seen their code you haven't seen their version control either so you can't assume they can not do it just like I can't assume what I said work, just giving an option that might work.
---
I wish we had a proper realistic barn door, I could definitely use that water tower for a good farm build..
---
Ditto, 40 is my fun gun.  Good enough for average stuff and making debris fly around with a good rof.
---
Going Bloodied isn’t all that complicated.  Adrenal Reaction mutation, Nerd Rage 3 in Intelligence, and a bloodied weapon if you choose.  That’s the basics.  
---
Beyond that, Unyeilding and Bolstering armor each provide benefits to a low health build.  
---
“Going Bloodied” isn’t a forever commitment.  You can change back and forth every hour if you want.  No big deal.
---
Doesn't look like it, not the one I just watched someone do anyway.
---
Hold b it’ll take you off the computer instantly
---
Too bad there aren't more though.  I wish armor and weapon levels went up to 100
---
Hi I haven't played the new patch yet, but could you try switching a wall while you are on the walls tab in the building menu then switch to edit. I had problems changing a wall before the patch but being on the walls tab in the build menu alleviates this.
---
Yes, It really does my friend. I'm an endgame player, and I mean end game like everything i get i give to newbies, because I have everything i could wish for. That's my only fun and so It was camp Building. Now Is no more and i'm so pissed because It ruins the devotion player are putting into camp Building
---
I know right? Even the atlas event is kinda lack luster with the rewards. The wendigo seemed working in pts so, idk what happened to make it delay
---
I think I saw it in the patch notes
---
Thank god
---
This post has more value than 80 atoms, though.
---
I wait for 24 hrs. before buying anything so I know it works lol learned the hard way a few times...
---
Can confirm, have noticed it too
---
Upvote for MHW
---
My first camp was set up next to the morgantown airport, just east of the flair launcher to start Collision Course.  Every time someone would start the event, it would drop a crate for me, regardless of whether I was anywhere near the event. So every few hours I would show up to 6-12 crates filled with 100-prewar money, so about 2000 cloth a day without lifting a finger.   Probably going to put up an alt camp there again to help get that collectron
---
Yea, if you think that's how things always work you're going to be in for a sad surprise one day.  I remember years back Blizzard was doing a community goal thing for Hearthstone for one of their expansions, everyone thought that the goals were rigged and organized a boycott to prove that the counter would go up no matter what and auto complete in the end... the event failed.
---
Whoever downvoted that and took it seriously is really dense.
---
There was a spot you could hop out of the map and skip it.  That appears to be fixed.  There are others, so that maybe adds another minute or two to the run
---
Bethesda, are the masters of half arsed.
---
You cannot, I've had my group test all the possible work around, you just can't anymore 😭
---
Most my junk during the first year when  the game came out took up more than 50% of my stash box. I hated not having enough resources, and it was part of my end game at the time to gather, farm, control workshops to reach enough junk to be satisfied
---
So what? Just wear the Marine Tactical Helmet.  
---
You know, cos Bethesda "don't want there to be  a best-in-slot headpiece" 🙄  
---
Difference being it actually *does* protect from waterborne disease.
---
Very annoying that they wouldn't at least add in a wall that can have a wallpaper applies to each side. It's fucking ridiculous especially considering how they started doing that creative camp show off campaign they're doing now.
---
I just tried in multiple spots in my camp, and I can't anymore. 
---
I also can't convert walls into doorways and vice versa.
---
Lmao thank you
---
That is how my base is right now.  I have a little general store or sorts.  Trade off is I dont run any defenses on it.  No need to.  I handle the occasional thing.
---
It's not part of the rewards everyone gets, it says every donation you get a crate almost like the presents which have junk aid and chance to drop rare plans
---
Wow, thanks for your well thought out and insightful contribution.
---
Good luck mate, keep me posted.
---
Yeah it's been fixed now, it longer works.
---
My guess they will start to sell double sided walls soon.
---
It’s mind boggling that this dude is actually defending them... like wtf?!?
---
I’m just stunned. I’m level 560 and my camp is why I play. It feels like they’re actively trying to make the game less enjoyable. I’m canceling my fallout 1st sub and it’s making me all kinds of sad. I love this game, quirks and all, but I can’t keep putting money into it.
---
Should be 7600.
---
If you thought that was good sarcasm, you're really dense.
---
The "rare plans" are just normal weapon and armor plans and mods, with power armor plans being rarest. Nothing new, just crafting plans most of us have.
---
Guess that means it was you.
---
And I'm so stupid and nit picky about my camp that ill probably buy it.
---
Exactly. Just the common mod plans you probably have thrown away a couple of times by now.
---
You asked a question, I gave you my answer.
---
I have a level 350 and 250+ char and consider myself one of the "grindier" players of this game.
---
You're 100% spot on, I won't bother doing any of this for those shit tier rewards. I'd be a million times better off doing literally anything else, including playing another game.
---
Apparently double-sided paperable walls were patched out this update?
---
That makes you more of a pleb than me, because you knew that, while I know it from wow. The fact that you know where it belongs means you spend time there and then come chat shit. Get hit kid
---
They cant increase storage space unless they want to admit to lieing saying increasing storage space would stress out the servers too much.
---
Legacy item now.
---
Broken in NW
---
Like they said, this single event isn't much of a story so much as setting up the scene for a story to come.
---
Money on the table they're adding interior walls to the atom shop
---
This has been my reaction to almost every update in the last 6 months. I was never bothered by the atomic shop until recently, the lack of effort put into the main game vs the ridiculous amounts of content reserved for the shop kind of makes me wonder.
---
Yep I have seen two so far lol
---
That Fallout 4 mulitiplayer mod is looking better everyday
---
Yep, that was a pretty similar mechanic. It’s a shame they don’t seem to be able to just set a price per round so you can use them like scrip, bullion and caps. That’s would make it a much better piece of equipment but at least it’s going in the right direction.
---
I've always had a theory that the shady shit coming from those websites are Beth employees doing a side hustle...
---
Don't you see that this is *entirely* the point?  
---
The event is structured to make FO1st essential.  
---
You can tell that they aren't worried about subscribers this month by the pathetic "exclusive" items they are offering.
---
Oof
---
How. How! HOW!? did you manage to make the ammo converter even clunkier than before!
---
I swear to god, you guys could fuck up a cup of coffee.
---
Nah.
---
if you have the scrap box, you have a tent. just move the tent.
---
That’s not a good thing
---
Holy... I'm sitting on 13 scrap steel right now after crafting a bunch of .50 last night. 92k, geez!
---
Tell me about it 🙄
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ATLAS_Observatory
---
Getting people to buy pre-fabs maybe the plan 👀
---
Oh really?  Then what’s the point of connecting power to it?  Man I better lock that thing up!  lol
---
Yeah, sometimes you just wanna make things go boom and not lose 30lbs of inventory space lol
---
Southwest of Sons of Dane Compound
---
No, actually you gave no answer at all. You let other people answer that and expect me to find their answers. That's just double lazy.
---
WHAAAAT!! We can get gold bullion off events?!? No limits?
---
Oh, but you can put hats on top of it?  That’s pretty cool.  I might just get it, can’t really picture what it’ll look like on my current character but may be nice to have
---
Like what beefy said people can't see it but if they stumble across your camp they'd probs try and use them. Stash em or hide them.
---
The raider collectron doesnt let me change it's options in the terminal. Just says: "Choose an Option:"
---
And nothing else.
---
Yeah mine gave me extra carry weight
---
Especially since those damn things weigh 6lbs a piece.
---
This has ruined the game for me. I play Fallout 76 with my husband, I'm not totally in love with the rest of the game (especially the countless bugs and crashes) but building was really fun for me so we had a game we could play together. Now that I can't do the simple (and expected) thing of having a room with all interior walls on the inside, it has sucked the fun right out of building. I'm really happy that I've never spent any actual money in the atomic shop yet or I'd be way more pissed than I am right now (if that's even possible). The ability to place walls back to back should have been a feature, it should never have been an "exploit" or "bug" or whatever you want to call it. Removing that ability was a huge mistake.
---
Its better, thats something at least. Id rather have this than nothing.
---
Umm I can tell you that I'm very casual, I just play one or two hours every day.  I'm level 75 right now so doing pretty well. Missed a couple of days and we had those days with double XP and double score.
---
I have some friends that have already Completed it and they have nothing to do now in game.
---
Yeah I had to exit out to see how much I have. Only issue is, once you convert ammo it took forever to get our of the terminal, like I had to go back through *every* screen. If anyone knows a workaround for this, please tell
---
Lvl 280 fo1st with a packed scrap box.  Me neither.  Rewards are a joke at both levels.  BoS is such a great faction with deep lore.  I hope they treat it better going forward.
---
What the fucking fuck fuck?
---
u/valseek
---
u/Ladydevann
---
No, lazy is this patch and dev team, no amount of white knighting will change it.
---
Umm, yes? A limited time event should have a chance (even if low) to drop compelling items. And it’s not free, you have to farm scrap, which I doubt many will be doing after seeing this horse shit loot table.
---
How about fixing his other numerous issues? I'm tired of waiting sometimes 10 mins to talk to the dbag because he glitches either into his bed or every single chair in Foundation.
---
Funny how out of dozens of AAA online games, all of which tend to update on Tuesdays, Fallout is the only one which needs to take the entire game offline for half the day to "apply" an update.
---
Other games simply send out an update, people download it, and they can immediately jump on and play.
---
I'm not sure why its like this, but it seems to be yet another area where they're simply technically inept
---
Yep! I imagine most people won't notice the clipping if they're not looking close, but it was a disappointing revelation for my Halloween photoshoots. :p
---
So the point of connecting power is just so it shows up on the map?  Yah gonna lock that up then lol
---
Gamepass definitely watered down the player pool with a bunch of new players on both PC and xbox. Much fewer nukes. This weekend it seemed to be picking back up though as a lot of these new players are leveling to that point. It has forced my friends and I to do more silos ourselves since there haven't been any  which has its own benefits because we can do them pretty quickly now.
---
The teacher should be a Miss Nanny.
---
I’m  on Xbox
---
There's a cooldown type mechanic to them, if someone  has recently milked the brahmin they don't produce milk, after that they can give up to 5 milk depending on how long it's been since the brahmin was last milked
---
I bought the bundle for the door, waste of atoms, I used it in one camp build and haven’t really used it since. Wish I could save you the bother and just come to your camp and build it for you.
---
Is there some world where the licensing allows Neighbor Tron to say "Hidely-Ho!"
---
Patch notes don't include everything they change.
---
Same. I hit max budget and stash and found it hard to keep logging in. Tried an alt for awhile but find I’m stuck doing stuff just to unlock the same things my first character already has and not things I enjoy. Then that character hit the stash limit and the amount of time I spend micromanaging killed the sense of fun and adventure. Haven’t gone as far as uninstalling but haven’t logged in for weeks going on months.
---
Or at least let me sell them for the standard 5 caps. Why do they destroy on drop???
---
Is this “content”, though? “Grind the same game loops and dump millions of scrap for trivial and largely duplicative cosmetic rewards” doesn’t really feel like “content” to me.
---
Don’t get me wrong - I’m in the same “I get pissed off but I keep coming back because it’s fun” camp as you are, but I don’t think I’d hang my hat on this being anything really innovative or even fun.
---
Imagine if - instead of a resource grind and dump - they had asked us to collect power armor frames (and other technology) off dead enemies? That surely wouldn’t have taken much more effort to implement than this, and it would have even fit more in the lore than just “bring me 200 million cork!”
---
This patch literally did nothing of value. The rewards for the BOS event are trash, the deep pockets aren't there, they pushed back collossus. Why even bother patching anything?
---
Nuka Break is still one of my favorite web series and I can only hope Bethesda match it in quality. Just because YOU don't like a show doesn't mean everyone does, Reddit's only a hivemind when it comes to hating games not TV. Unless it's Marvel or GoT
---
Yea just saw the drop table and I'm highly disappointed
---
Agreed. They should be enabling and enhancing camp building not crippling it.  Bad move.  Senseless.
---
Escape on PC.  Not sure about consoles though, sorry.
---
What do you mean? Are there any red walls or just different colored wood walls in general?
---
I'd love it, but I also see why not.
---
The Todd demands that a certain number of bugs exist in his games at all times. Do not bother questioning his brilliance.
---
When one thing is fixed, something else must be broken to maintain the equilibrium.
---
Only problem is 75% of the community doesn’t give 2 shits about a beret or a skin for the scrap bot. Regardless if it auto completes or not a minority of the player base cares while the majority doesn’t.
---
Also figured that out this week since the lack of nukes has forced my friends and I to be more proactive in launching them ourselves instead of waiting.
---
I watched someone donate 100K steel, it didn't take that long.
---
what happened to the pics? I'm trying to decide if I wanna buy this for the greatest hits price of 400c
---
Yes and just crashed. this is corona 2.1
---
That game hooked me like nothing else ever has.  I have an embarrassing amount of hours in it.  I love how complex it becomes, the endgame opens up more and more opportunities instead of whittling them down to fewer and fewer options.  I’m a little behind, haven’t fought Alatreon yet, but can’t wait for the weekend to really sink into it for a little while.  What weapon/weapons do you play?
---
They patched out the way to do what you’re trying to.. until someone finds a new way to do it the only people with “inside walls” are people who had it done before today.
---
Damn. Are there any like red walls or different types of wood walls? I can't seem to find any in the atom shop but could just be looking in the wrong places.
---
Last years Scorched community goals ring a bell?  What rare shit did they drop again?  Oh right, nothing. I'm pretty sure that was even before they made it so Scorchbeasts could even spawn as legendary.   Did people spend their time to complete it anyway with no provisions and markedly worse rewards when they could have been doing something else?  Yes, they did.
---
Its Bethesda and there apathetic put in the minimum necessary effort at work to justify our paycheck work ethic again, 
---
yay
---
I think I will put the minimum necessary work on this as well. as in none. Well maybe for cloth because I kind of want that Collectron but to be honest someone else can probably get that.
---
Literally the only plans I'm missing are the ones the dev's have been too fucking apathetic to fix in the list...so I'm too apethetic to buy atoms.
---
I briefly was able to log in and look.  All my challenges had check marks next to them so I chewed a piece of bubblegum to see if it was actually working and it gave me score
---
To me it's more of a cluttered mess if you are using it like before the changes(converting small amounts)
---
if you have tons of ammo that you know is in your inventory it is much easier/better
---
IMO still an awful interface...but hey it's a start
---
Hmm havent bothered with it since it first launched. I run a bloodied melee/gatling, so the only thing i keep is cores. Everything else i put in my vendor for 1cap
---
I wouldn't mind it if he wasn't floating in the air half the time
---
Lmao.  I haven’t played for a couple days now but the first thing I do once I can play is probably scrap this damn thing.
---
Oh fucking spare me your Comment Section 101 "white knight" bullshit. You don't have an original thought anywhere in that brain do you? You refer me to other people's posts to justify your own nonsense, you used generic buzzwords that don't even apply to this situation. Would it really kill you to think for yourself and not borrow from everyone else?
---
I would have loved to see their faces when nothing happened.
---
Damn that's unfortunate. Thanks for being helpful haha sorry if it was a dumb question!
---
I assume they have patched it. Didn't work for me when I wanted to edit my camp.
---
Does this mean glitching things through walls (like power lines) is over?
---
No, the gear you get from buillon plans is what I meant
---
Always interesting to see the one person that speaks for 75% of the community.  Do you guys have a newsletter and regular meetings to decide what you all approve of?
---
Agreed on every count. It wouldn't be so bad if I could drop them all at once. I tried using them a couple of times but the blast range seems to be the size of a fire cracker.
---
Obligatory : I LOVE GOOOOOOOLD!
---
you remember the last guy that said "says you" to me? 🤣
---
Not a dumb question, it was easy to do as of yesterday. Hopefully someone figures out a way to do it again soon. *sigh*
---
Combat has the best fire rate and mag size, with the least amount of damage. Probably has the best DPS of the 3
---
Pump is the in between
---
Double barrel has high damage, but lower DPS due to only having 2 shells loaded at anyone time. A quad legendary version is awesome as it eliminates its weakness and makes it a powerhouse. Though you sacrifice it fitting into a bloodied/junkies build, though the DPS of a quad variation might be better
---
Oh so I’m starting to farm SS gear so if I do my dailies and public events there a chance I might get Plans for SS gear?
---
Completely fine with it not working in NW tho. OP card imo. It procs on downs and NPC kills. It makes it easy to one-shot with gauss shotty or tubes. I got the gauss to do over 700 damage on a charged shot.
---
Well you can place double walls but you can't switch a doorway to a normal wall anymore. It's truly infuriating. I spend all my time building on here and it seems every patch they take away a little more functionality
---
Im not a casual and im behind schedule. Missing one day and youre fucked. Doesnt feel rewarding
---
Normally I've only got a handful.  I always carry a 90% weight reduction 40mm.  When I get a decent amount it's off to the NW to teach wolves how to fly.  ;)
---
Fear the mad lad who for some reason had 300 mininukes.
---
I have a 3-star executioner's combat shotgun and it kills nearly everything in a single VATS shot, so my vote is for that.  :)
---
The barn walls you get from the barn building set plan are both red and wooden!
---
Unfortunately, atom store items go in and out constantly so that's not a great way to keep track of all the options available. You can scroll through the options in build mode if you want to look for a certain design you'd like to keep an eye out for, though-- but you might have to wait a while.
---
I cut the power to mine and a player stopped using it then tried going to the other vendors did nothing then left. Could be coincidence but seemed like they couldn't use them
---
Can't even pause, I just was able to walk to a turret tho and tried to let it kill me but for some reason I wouldnt even die, found if I HELD start tho I was able to get to that sub menu and leave the world that way.
---
Gives me another way to get the ultracite gatling laser plan so I'm excited!
---
LOL right.. it was just example, but I get what you mean :)
---
I’ll check but I don’t think I’m going to use them. Being I went from trying to carry as much as I can to just getting as much protection as I can. But I do have deep pocketed on my chest piece instead of jet pack.
---
You really think they could get distributed tallies of the numbers correct? 
---
Its just gonna be like you all did it! Yay! 
---
Unless the reward objects dont get finished aand dded into the game in time then it will be like, aww better luck next time.
---
This wasn't meant as a jab? 🤔
---
lol I had forgotten about patch day. It's downloading now, I'll let you know once I'm in
---
Yeah that really sucks. Looks a lot better with them. Any other walls that look nicer than base game walls that you can place?
---
100% this. As well buy pre-fabs
---
Not having double sided walls for creativity is kind of a bummer
---
Same.
---
Actually, devs also don't know what they change or breake again
---
Samesies
---
I converted 30k 5mm to 308 in about five minutes. It's not difficult, it's just poorly designed. And the conversation rate is ass.
---
Just hit back, you don't have to go through any menus again.
---
Have you seen them on regs? They aren’t there for me
---
They "Fix" this but I bet they haven't touched "magic" weapons.  \*shakes head\*
---
Was there any new rewards for donating *besides* the community rewards we get if we complete the goals?
---
This patch is fucking bullshit
---
&gt;being mostly cosmetics and nothing of any consequence, means people who don't log in every day don't really miss anything.
---
cosmetics are immensely popular and desired by many as part of visual customization, people are missing cosmetics (assuming some like the LR cosmetics, i personally still only like the one's i see coming to atom shop),  this constant attempt to downplay them never works, it fails especially hard when attempted as the "cosmetic only" mtx justification argument, which also doesn't work, since there's no justification for mtx in paid games and all "cosmetics" should be in the game as unlockables (and no, not as unlockables locked behind artificially extended grinds designed and built around pushing mtx)
---
However, the cosmetics of the legendary run are locked behind a linear rank up track, and you can't just directly choose/acquire them like atom shop items, so it's just outright worse for anyone who does want those one's in any case, not me though, only thing i care about on legendary run is the atoms (which they took away from our daily/weekly challenges and reduced) because i like to choose my cosmetics/rewards instead of having random one's thrown at me.
---
&gt;But then, I also don't understand people who complain about the grind, then complain the rewards are rubbish. Why grind when you can see what the rewards are and don't like them?
---
you're most likely thinking of 2 different groups of people, people who want the items but say the grind is too extreme, and people who just don't care about the items (but may want the atoms) but are legitimately poking fun at how long the grind is for so little in atoms, and since beth took away peoples daily/weekly atom challenges...
---
I’m on the bathroom floor, but thank you anyway.
---
There's a box at the helipad
---
Oh okay! Thank you! I assume the barn ones aren't in the atom shop now?
---
Now we see all the ammo-types and then can decide if we want to buy/sell 1x/10x/100x of it, NO MATTER if you even have that kind of ammo to sell.  
---
You see the option to sell 100 Syringer-ammo, even though you don´t have a single one.  
---
They made it worse! Who was beta-testing this?
---
I tried to spare you, I gave u a nice succinct answer to your white knight post and you couldn't handle it, poor fellow.
---
 'To me, a T.V. show is an act of brand cowardice and a move towards more totalitarian storytelling. I don't want your linear propaganda'
---
bruh you are on the top shelf boof over there dude.
---
The player base has evolved quite a bit in a year, no? I’m not sure how you are defending this disappointment, it’s bad any way you slice it. Even the community rewards are lackluster/recycled, least we could get was a shot at something new or actually “rare” for the material grind.
---
in that case check out https://fo76map.com/ and filter by items-power armor. It hasn't been updated in forever but it's *mostly* correct, and some of the locations are tagged properly as raider-PA spawns.
---
Can’t wait to try it out, heard so many good things about it lol
---
I’m just asking for a bar with a number under is saying that you have so and so amount of steel out of 125 million, god what crawled in your ass and died
---
I think the main difference is that it's instanced, instead of being in the overworld like the usual colossus spawns. This game has always struggled with its instanced dungeon implementation since Vault 94 came out.
---
I found you have to go through every screen you saw before it lets you out, I was just spamming the button on my controller.
---
They could just make those few changes with 44 ammo, or just give us a 44 receiver for the LA it make it funner and give 44 more of an actual use.
---
Jesus, how the hell are you sitting on 50K steel??? Mine is gone literally as soon as I scrap it, turning it into .308 ammo.
---
Yep.  They don't seem to be in the game.
---
Or hell, just allow them to be dropped instead of destroyed.
---
Ah thank you my friend
---
Hold the exit button to exit terminals. Dont tap it
---
Ah! I had the same issue... found a solution by running around with Red Ranger armor using Atomic Onslaught Arms.
---
Yep. This needs to be addressed. It's such a major part of the game!
---
With the right perk cards? Or without them
---
Just a PSA for fast travel bug, remove healing factor as a mutation if you run it. Might help, might not, but it’s the biggest known trigger for the bug.
---
While you do that when can we expect the Ultra-light plans for the limbs?   
---
and also fix the Camo Secret service under armor since you cant apply any mods on it.   
---
Thanks! :D
---
No there's a chance you might get the SS gear if you already know the plans
---
So I checked my file version and it's correct, 1.3.3.24. However, still no Pocketed/Deep Pocketed limb plans with Regs.
---
I hate it when mobs come and destroy my crops, and even gave up on having crops for a long time. My new idea was to build a completely sealed greenhouse. I get inside by going into build mode, starting a swap on one wall with a doorway, walking through the doorway, and then exiting build mode. 
---
Is this no longer possible?? :(
---
dont worry they will just add all of that as a 1st option! just what we asked for!
---
Fuck this game. Why would they do this?
---
My boyfriend and his dad are hunters. They have a camo hat that says “PETA — People Eating Tasty Animals.”
---
Are things always about winning and losing to you? I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you day and life gets better. Goodbye :)
---
Oh okay so instead of having to keep crafting there a chance I get a roll , got it
---
cool have fun
---
I’d imagine if that’s how you feel Bethesda operates then a tv show, a linear storyline, would be the best outlet for Bethesda to make Fallout a worthy franchise. Definitely agree there is an extended level of difficulty for gaming to be good, but if any studio and any IP and with any production team I think Bethesda has everything lined up well to finally decide whether games can be tv shows/movies. 
---
Even if it’s super campy, I’m totally up for the attempt. Worst case, I hate it and it flops and Bethesda doesn’t try tv anymore. Best case, I get my fallout lore fix.
---
You don’t participate in IT.  IT participates in YOU.
---
I mean..
---
They fixed a bug.  Not took away a feature.  You were all exploiting bugs.
---
Stop complaining.
---
Nope Bethesda is intentionally removing fun parts of the gam yet again.
---
Bah, I just want a weed wacker to finally get rid of indestructible weeds.  I'm still baffled that wood armor doesn't outshine PA.  After all, even the smallest plants shrug off nuke strikes.
---
Me too, currently I’ll use the barn walls and wallpaper the rest of the room red to try to match
---
Because it was an íssue...
---
Just watched someone streaming using it, and it looks pretty straightforward.  What's the issue with it?
---
Daisycutter, right? Yup I’m probably not ever dropping that from my stash.
---
haha holy shit they did that? Wow, that's.... about par for the fucking course for this team. You know, you expect people to get better over time, learn from their mistakes, improve...
---
Clearly the team running FO76 is different!
---
Up until today people were psyched for this event knowing nothing about it other than the community goal rewards and now it's suddenly THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE GAAAAAAAAMMMMMMEEEEEEE! because... they didn't stick a 0.002% chance of getting a Crocolossus backpack in the boxes?
---
Well done, Bethesda. Well done.
---
Go to ATLAS Observatory in the Savage Divide area of the map. Talk to Russel (human NPC) out front and then you will see the deposit crates right by him. You can donate 250 steel at a time it seems
---
I love them combine with the grenadier perk it can do some good damage so I usually use them before I use my good grenades
---
nice
---
My number will be an even 0, so it will be easy to keep track of.
---
Nice try Todd. Keep up with your promises and maybe you won’t have irritated posts like this.
---
OMFG!!!??! I just moved my base, as I found a good spot. And I tried doing the doorway thing to have wallpaper inside my bedroom and it didn't work. So I've come straight here. And seen this thread.
---
I am beyond fucked off.
---
I'm impressed that they managed to make it even less usable than it previously was. Guess it's back to dropping ammo across the wasteland because it's not worth the hassle of using that thing.
---
I guess my mains camp is forever now 😂
---
wait what? how?
---
It's for the community rewards, not for water or grenades
---
Then dont play it?
---
Try using the terminal in power armor :)
---
I was accessing my collection robot by changing the wall to a door way.  Now I have to delete the wall and put it back.
---
Speaking of GSG for sbq only ballistic damage counts and u got to be very close in order to deal the best damage. As well u lose full charge option bcz sometimes ur gun is stuck and u need to press "R" for 2 sec to unstuck it. So it is very buggy weapon and not recommended for sbq and sb in general. Without using vats it worked very well in bugged version of Line in the Sand and any events where u r not alone and just want to tag mobs.
---
This worked for me. Thx.
---
Let's spread the word
---
Delete this if you have to, but as Bethesda has never responded to any of my support tickets, I will not pass on the opportunity that someone at that company might actually read a word I have to say, I just want you to know your best is not enough, and you're terrible at your job. I don't know if you need more employees, better management, and I blame the owners above all else, but your fallout division is run like shit. Over two years of non stop disappointments. You will get zero dollars from me until you can manage to create something worth the money you're asking me to spend. Nothing but garbage and money grabs
---
It’s the costars from westworld running the show, and they’re apparently pretty big fallout enthusiasts who would probably have a good handle of this genre. If anyone is gonna be able to pull this off, I’d imagine it’d be them. personally Amazon’s video library sucks, but I have obsessed over every original series I’ve watched from them.
---
Dont know it was from a player vendor
---
Welp. Now I don’t feel bad that I wanted to spend time away from 76 tonight and bake a cake instead.
---
Treasure Map &gt; 250 steel
---
Every grenade I get either goes into the sky to get shot or into the closest crowd of players to see if anyone scrambles.
---
Why not a Sell All option?
---
To me, this is like making a movie about the content of a famous painting like "Starry Night" or " Water Lilies." Sure, maybe those movies could be great, but what makes people like those theoretical films will have very little to do with what made the paintings please their audience. I like that the open story game-mode prevents the game from making (as many) political stances. Because you can play for many endings, the writers are more likely to make complex characters that have all kinds of tension. They don't get to control your perspective and therefore it is harder to message/manipulate through the medium. I feel like every amazon/netflix/hulu original show is so laced with propaganda I can hardly relax and watch anymore. EDIT - removed redundant phrase.
---
I went ahead and threw 1000 in the crate just because I have F1st and have piled up a lot of steel scrap over the last few months.  I think I have near everything on the list anyway, but go nothing but garbage.  Meh, I'm all for getting the final reward but the table for these boxes is just awful.
---
At least under the old layout, it didn't show ammo to convert unless it was in your inventory. Now it shows every ammo type regardless. Then you have to check your inventory before you use it and memorize  how much of each you have before attempting to convert.
---
Honestly if it means we see lessbitch and moan posts from now on, I commend your fortitude to never log on again, like you just said.
---
I was just looking for them and didn't see them, either.
---
Does it provide any benefits?
---
I would very much like that.
---
If they can make double sided walls, it would really help people with camp budgets etc.
---
Still sucks though.
---
there is no "community" focus with this event, at least the last one people would team up to kill scorchedbeasts. this time its just dump resources that i would be better off selling or giving to low levels, not just dumping them into the void.
---
It is, but it's not slow...you'll have notifications popping up until you log out though.
---
The backpack plan would be something to get me excited.  No such luck.
---
What I do is use the back button when I just sold something. That way you're back where you were in one click
---
Its also so they can sell double sided wall papers an doorways now. I guarantee they will show up soon.
---
As always
---
Is this in the atom shop rn?
---
I still need heavy raider legs. Only one of the set I’m missing. And yes. Reroll ing has been a nightmare so I’m glad for these chances.
---
I believe the water fountain worked like a sink or water pump; you interact with it to collect dirty water. 
---
I’m also curious about the rain collector though. My hope would be for it to passively collect dirty water like the water purifier collects purified water ... but I kind of doubt it and I’d like to know the function before wasting my atoms.
---
100% agree.  This was a senseless and short sited “fix”.
---
No it's now a normal outfit
---
Then sorry, I don't understand why are you so behind, I missed 2 days of the event, it takes me like 30 minutes to complete the challenges and I'm not doing most of the NW events, and still, I'm way ahead of schedule. Mostly thanks to those double XP and double score weekend that we had, also the fact that Bethesda implemented more dailies.
---
Actually the real problem is on the other direction, some of my friends have already completed the event (or are really close to do) and now they have nothing else to do and doing dailies for them is worthless.
---
All we needed was a Sell All option. I'm sure that would have made 99% of players happy. Sell All of what you don't use, keep what you do. Pretty Simple.
---
Yeah that's a good point, I did notice that now that you mention it.
---
Does the rain barrel collector give you dirty water, at least, that you can boil ?
---
which are also trash
---
What if for strange reason, the collosus event not be active was the reason these plans do not show up.
---
You're the best haha! Thank you so much! Can players sell the plans? Cause I'm also missing the power armor workbench plans somehow and I've done a lot of story.
---
I actually supposed that my initial " Maybe you think it might be cool, that's great." comment was enough to convince readers I was aware that people may not agree. I have since edited for more clarity.
---
You seem more fired up than anyone complaining, lol. A bit dramatic, friend. People said the loot sucks, and it does. End of story really.
---
Its run from a branch of Bethesda that has a lot of new devs an very little knowledge an experience. The main team left long ago.
---
Complain all you want, but I've spent the last year defending Bethesda but theres no excuse for this
---
Double ways are way better than the trick that we used till it got apparently fixed in today's patch as they wouldn't take up 2x the budget of a regular wall though
---
Meat week?  Double score?
---
OTOH, virtually all my good legendary stuff was pre-exchange from vendor bots. Not much point even checking them anymore.
---
just came here to post this, at least give me my flux back beth!
---
That’s rough, maybe the carpet or flamethrower trick could be used to get them closer?
---
Field scribe hat , welding helmet , green hood dont have clipping issues and they look pretty cool with it
---
Was the Seedy Shed always on it's own?  I can't remember if I passed it up last time around because it was in a bundle or because I was just waiting on a discount.
---
Wait until you find out about the deep pockets
---
Just like the Brotherhood officer Under Armour it has led lining and then protective lining protective lining took 2 Violet flux. Same officer
---
it certainly is bizarre.
---
No I run around and try to “pull” stuff in toward center , stealth commando with speed demon lets me run around like a jackass
---
Same here !!!!
---
Yeah, I guess I am never rebuilding my camp again. Which was something I enjoyed doing.  Tweaking and improving or going with a different theme.   Whelp guess I won't be buying anything new that doesn't fit with my camp.  :-/
---
My favorite part about this post is how it defines the new era of social media where suddenly everyone is a expert even though 99% of them don't know anything beyond memes and YouTube videos.
---
Yes, interior walls will definately be on the way now I think.
---
 Of course thats a good thing, to apply a wallpaper to each side, but at the cost of losing out on the wall trick, nope.
---
Interior walls might not be in the atom shop, but of course wallpapers are so they will make money on that.
---

Logged in, I'll send you a request.

IGN Tazier
---
I would be happy if they sold more display cases. So far, besides reskins, all we've gotten is the Thanksgiving display. There needs to be more options.
---
That was me! =0
---
Can someone ELI5 this for me? It seems like a lot of people are upset, but in spite of being a pretty active CAMPer, I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Yea whenever I open the legendary run my frames drop dramatically also areas I've walked in had huge frame drops
---
Really disappointed the BOS Power Armor paints weren't included.
---
I checked and they are not available for me on XB1.
---
Yeah, much like the existing Colossus, your HP can take a dive real fast.  Bloodieds are used to Poison and Fire doing this, you just have to stay on top of it.
---
I was relieved that it didn't seem to use Vault 94 rules though, where you'd get kicked out on death.  On the other hand, when your 30 minutes are up, they're up.
---
Have a good day! :)
---
Mindlessly grind XP for hours. Or use an exploit like a large portion of them did.
---
I agree we need more, im just predicting that the trick to decorate standard shelves will soon disappear.
---
Well I'm sure if this gains enough traction and the developers at Bethesda see this and they will do their best to accommodate as they have in the past.
---
\*photomode skipping doors intensifies\*
---
Could you please fix the junkies bug in the next patch
---
that's still broken. :(
---
Ha, joke's on you! They're in the games files so Bethesda didn' break their promise, see, see?
---
I don't see it as punishing us, I see it as their usual lack of insight into issues into the game and what players want. We saw it with the ammo convertor, the messed up skin for the secret service, them continuously patching out building tricks and not supplementing them with actual tools, and various other things. 
---
It is just mind-boggling how unaware of things the devs seem to be.
---
the game has been out for damn near 2 years. You're saying the current team is new and has only been on task briefly? Because it's been the same shit since launch.
---
Being a fan of these two games feels like abuse at times lmao
---
Well world is my first game in the series.  I’m on my late thirties and took a 25ish year hiatus from gaming but when I got an xbox 2 ish years ago my wife got me the game for Christmas as she’d heard me talk about it from a podcast I listen to.  
---
I started with dual blades but moved on to hammer and IG after low rank.  I made it to HR nearly 400 with mostly IG.  When iceborne came out I started playing bow and SnS.
---
I really love playing support now. I made it to MR 180 something and usually play SnS for support; I’m better at IG for dps though and so I have even made a few “custom” off meta IG support builds.  Not as good as a horn or proper SnS; but super fun and effective nonetheless.  
---
I also really love the MHW community, some of the nicest folks I’ve met online (similar to fo76 community). Almost everyone wants to help.
---
Yeah! Just don your preschooler alligator backpack and lay down for nappy time!
---
Dude this happened since before the patch
---
It would be a PA nightmare to not autocomplete them. While i agree the OPs post would be amusing from a gamer standpoint, FO76 and its maintenance team devs are already a laughingstock in the community. The gaming media would use this as fresh ammunition to mock the game. And Bethesda doesnt need this particular can of gasoline thrown onto the deck of an already burning ship.
---
So they will auto complete them, then exclaim with a straight face that their event was a success because "oh, look, all the goals were met by the *community*!"
---
So that Colossal Problem thing..you know that one and only thing you've been able to hype up...isn't going to be a thing until after "the next coming weeks"...
---
Fuck can Bethesda stop being a thing and someone else just buy up the IPs.
---
Ummmmm... I'm not the one complaing.....
---
Thank god I left after fasnacht
---
Just recently started playing, so this is my first community event for FO76. The list in general looks somewhat underwhelming. Brews, Aid, and Grenades are obtainable very easily in larger amounts while farming the scrap than you actually get awarded for turning said scrap in. Caps are nice, but hit or miss depending on the player. And the plans... all the interesting ones are level locked. Despite having a 800lbs limit in our stash, I guess being able to store one or two nice plans for when you can learn them later on is just too OP.
---
Been having an OK time with FO76, but this community event is pretty lackluster. I guess its just something to break the monotony for those who have been playing for longer, but without actually affecting the ingame economy or balance with rewards.
---
Hope this isn't a regular approach to how Bethesda handles these things. Various temporary buffs would have been a lot more interesting than a singular Stimpak, for example.
---
Or a vault tech experiment
---
Im usually ambivalent about the ATX and bundling, but I would have bought the junk walls separately.  I’m completely uninterested in the other bundled items.  It’s a shame.
---
Im frankly a little surprised at the level of disappointment some people seem to have over a change like this. As if they were not expecting it. Me, I just see another step away from the games they used to make and another step towards the game they so desperately wish they were - fortnite:MOBA edition *shudder*
---
They've been ignoring bugs, adding "fixes" to cool features that people enjoyed and just generally listening to the community with both ears tied behind their backs for years, now. I hate to say but id expect a lot more of this kind of shitty change as time moves forward. 
---
Bottom line is Bethesda's not really interested in what you: the player wants. Theyre interested in what you: the consumer are statistically more likely to end up paying for regularly. Make no mistake, theyre not trying to build a fun game for you to play, any more. Theyre trying to build an effective means of securing reliable income/profits and you're just in possession of the commodity they want so they need some form of interface from which to separate it from you. Its dirty, its manipulative, its disappointing and yet it's unfortunately all I've seen Bethesda deliver for the last 2.5yrs. This is their brand now.
---
Personally, I've decided im boycotting the company entirely. That means I uninstalled this, f04 and f03. Deleted Dishonored from my wish list and I also check to make sure they aren't involved with a game im about to buy because after the way they've betrayed my faith (and loyalty), I dont want them to see another cent from me as long as I live. If anyone else feels misled or betrayed or otherwise very pissed off at Bethesda then id recommend you do the same.
---
And in closing, here's my feature suggestion for the devs: take your pay2play grindfest b list garbage game and code yourselves an ass to shove it up 🖕
---
Damn.   I was hoping it would be better when I logon later tonight.   Oh well.   Might be time for us to find a different game.  
---
(Says the crack addict knows he should quit, lol).  😉
---
well maybe after this they will throw in pay to win loot boxes? Seriously they have been going after every other failing or outright failed model they could try to cram into the game but that so far, (not counting the failed in development whatever it was that was Battle cry)
---
There's a monkey that periodically pushes a large red button and the content created before the game was released is distributed as "updates".
---
So they added different sellable amounts for the ammo converter, made it so buying and selling is on one screen, but why the hell does it have to kick us back to the main screen still?
---
Precisely
---
FFS that’s fucking stupid. Thank god I got the outside of my alt’s camp done last night...
---
Probably have a “legacy” camp on my main now. Fantastic.
---
Base building is basically optional. You might want the bare minimum so you can sell things, stash your stuff and fix your gear. There is no need to build a theme park for a base, but many people enjoy it.
---
You can turn off pvp. Pvp is only mandatory in pvp zones, such as workshops, or in the game's battle royale mode.
---
You can rock a revolver the whole game. Weapon strengths are based on lvls (linear) and weapon prefixes (luck and grinding), and your perks (linear). Big explosive guns like fat man are not meta. Generally, most will run rifles/assault rifles or heavy guns such as .50 cal or heavy energy gatling guns.
---
Fashion: many of your clothing choices will be IAP unlocked. There is an enormous number of clothing choices in game, but some of the *best* looking outfits are atom shop.
---
Ah, that's what it was.  I was just in a Rumble where someone was using a Tesla and it turned into a 2 fps slide show.
---
You were complaining about seeing complaints ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
With a watermark of course
---
Like people said go to ATLAS and click on the box after talking to the NPC, but careful it seems you can sometimes turn in the steel but not get the reward.
---
Props to you for being able to play the horn!  I’ve tried it a few times and it’s overwhelming to say the least.  Love playing group when there’s a horn, I’m on Xbox or I’d say let’s squad up and hunt!
---
it's not showing challenges done
---
A cosmetic item in a game may be desirable to some, but some folks on here hate what they call a grind with a passion. So, say it takes 30 minutes a day to get all the SCORE. That's about 50 hours for the full 100 rank run. Is any cosmetic honestly worth spending 50 hours of your time, when you're not enjoying it?
---
I just can't wrap my head around someone doing that. If it was something I didn't enjoy doing, I'd just shrug my shoulders and say "eh, it's not worth it."
---
If you can get it on sale, go for it. If you can't then by endgame everyones in powerarmor and using gatling weapons in order to 'beat' the major boss characters, and then saying that you can technically do it without doing what they are doing but not really.
---
Pvp is unforgiving, in main game you have to fire back at someone who fired at you in order to pvp, unless you own a workshop they are taking from you.  In NW, you have to have specific builds and specific perk cards from playing NW, and a good team and you can win but its mostly dick waving from what I can gather in value.
---
Base building is nearly 0 percent, the storyline is quick if you avoid doing side stuff, the side stuff is limited to a few quests, with a couple of unlocks.  The rest of the time the game is just RNG about what you get from events/missions and the rest of the time its just dailies and more dailies.
---
They're doing some random new content and thats kind of the only reason im still playing, while waiting.
---
I'm starting to think that F76 is just a program that mines bitcoin using our electricity.
---
To answer your questions.
---
1 - totally up to you, your allowed to build, explore, or do quests right after leaving the vault. Totally up to you.
---
2- PvP is a non issue if you don’t want it. Turn on pacifist mode and your covered against 99% of PvP scenarios.
---
3 - Yes and No, the weapons level with you and you unlock stronger weapons as you level up. I’ve never fired a Fatman shell and I’ve got over 750 hours in so far. Running with a 44 may be a challenge since the game isn’t too kind to pistol builds. But you can easily make it as a rifleman or melee build. And no, power armor is not a necessity 
---
4- Fashion is dependent on what they stocked the Atom shop with that week. There’s a few cool default outfits, but the flashy stuff is in the store. You get atoms to buy items through playing naturally or you can buy them.
---
Based off what your saying I think you’ll enjoy the game. Hope this helps!
---
Same.   And NPCs with 15 seconds timer between their repeated schtick.  Lol
---
Meanwhile the SCORE bug...
---
That's awesome.
---
Bethesda loot boxes? you'd have more chance of your tax return being hand delivered by a naked Jessica Alba during a national holiday then getting something good from one of those boxes.
---
The community goals are a gamble, whereas the provisions are instantly granted. It’s legitimate to react on what is given instantly vs. what we’re not even guaranteed to even reach. You could spend 5000 Steel scraps and be only awarded the provision boxes. **That’s the reality of the situation**.
---
The last community challenge from last year involved killing Scorched, and this was way more accessible and less expensive than pouring chunks of 250 steels that are more valuable everywhere else in the game.
---
Basically, you lose more by participating in this community event for a gamble than you did in its last iteration.
---
The constant delays of Colossal Problem does not give me much hope for whatever Daily Ops and Expeditions will be
---
you get it 😁 Im not sure I have a verse in me today tho
---
But the thing is I'm not doing anything and it keeps going up , all challenge are done by now
---
Guess I never noticed as I try to stay outta the water.  Marine do both or just water?
---
Hmmmmmm. 🤔
---
This has been around since Fallout 4. You can quickly exit any terminal by holding the cancel button. But it is a good PSA since I don't think a lot of people know about it.
---
Both.  
---
If you don't have the plan, just be sure to keep checking NPC vendors. Many players craft these and sell like 50 of them a day to vendors to get their daily 1400 caps.
---
NO
---
For the last time, they're called energy weapons, and it's SCIENCE, not magic.
---
Also I'm pretty sure they're a feature, not a bug, but I'm not entirely sure about that one
---
Oh, you.  :-)
---
BoS had to get that deep hatred of AI from somewhere.  Maybe this is it, modus vs BoS chain like raider vs settler chain.
---
If you're on PC you have to press escape to get out of it. Not been on yet this evening, so if that doesn't work it's a new thing. Tab just sends you in circles.
---
But on the list of auto-completing SCORE challenges, fast travel, and floating walls, surely one of those should have been way further down the to-do list
---
Noooo this is my primary weapon :(
---
And the entitled generation we live in people don't consider much of anything when it comes to empathy.
---
Finally, junk walls. They would be awesome for any build
---
It still baffles me that they fix bugs that no one was complaining about, but sleep on the actual bugs that hurt the game experience and make it harder to play the game more often. 
---
Just. Why only fix what helps people enjoy the game?
---
God I can’t wait for red shift 2
---
Did you even read the post? I said it’s not good for smaller amounts, it’s only good for larger amounts
---
That rug is very cool.  Thanks for posting this!
---
I feel like the purpose of this event is to clear out the massive junk stashes FO1st players have accumulated in order to ease up the strain on game servers.
---
Lol if I was using an exploit I wouldn't complain about having no more rewards, but that's the internet for ya I guess. Well I don't have time for  grinding that much XP. Here's hoping they give us a few more double score days!
---
Dont know about after the update but I had to buy/sell something to it to get back to the main screen to exit.
---
Yep. What platform are you on?
---
I just donated  5, 000 steel scrap to get 20  supply creates  of crap. Lmfao! 
---
I would have used that scrap for my self, or helped rebuild other players camps . What a  joke lol. I just re-donated everything I got from  the B.O.S settlement at atlas. 
---
Lots of useless stuff,  I honestly don't need, just like most events never plans I am missing, never Items that maybe useful, always crap. It just adds insult to injury. 
---
And I am not trying to sound ungrateful either, close to $500 in investment into there game. Not to mention thousands of hours of game play. 
---
You give an inch for them to take a mile. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Limb mods were not added as patch notes say.
---
I ran into this also, thought it was another bug, eventually figured it out. Didn’t realize it worked on all terminals. Thanks for the info!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3ptn3/august_4th_atom_shop_update_for_those_on_the/g0dfb3t/
---
Yeah this is really the only reason for a lot of people to play right now. Loosening arbitrary restrictions would have made more sense than this
---
I know what you mean if it's any consolation. it's very annoying when you love the fallout series. it's the only game I play and I'm feeling a bit peeved myself over a magnitude of things.
---
Aw shit. I hope my C.A.M.P. still looks the way it did when I logged off.
---
Lol how can someone make something bad and then make it worse but with good intentions.
---
If I were in charge in that place (Bethesda or wherever they make the game) I would be cracking skulls. I've said it before, they should be embarrassed by their incompetence.
---
We need the brotherhood of steel, in times like this
---
Wow this is pointless, cant wait to see little to none of the goals met
---
/looks at my gameboard
---
/looks at my cork inventory
---
meh no I could get maybe Two extra moves from a double score weekend. Either everyone else will do it, or I just spend some of the pile of atoms I'm not really  spending anyway
---
If this came out as true I would fully believe it
---
I'm here when you`re avaiable. Just send request to "pueo"
---
Hold the exit button. It’ll get you out of the terminal immediately without backing through all the pages. This works on every terminal.
---
I play pretty much like what you describe, roleplaying and wandering around living my character’s life the way they’d live it and using the weapons they use. 
---
I really enjoy base building but in this it’s actually a smaller % of gameplay than in a lot of others as it is literally limited as to what you can do.
---
PvP is most annoying for the ACTUAL PvPers/griefers. It’s almost not ever even necessary to fight back against griefers. PvP is Opt-in, so you have to fire back at the person to fully engage PvP, and you can pop Pacifist mode on to make it even less of an issue. 
---
Each weapon type has its own level. So you can definitely use a single weapon type pretty much always, you’ll just upgrade by getting a higher level version of that weapon. And then there’s Legendary weapons on top of that, so you can get a good roll on your character’s preferred weapon type and be set for hundreds of hours in endgame. 
---
Fashion it kinda depends. I’ve never had an issue just rolling with whatever I want to and finding good gear to do so, but I’ve seen people lament that it’s terrible in 76, so I guess it’s hit or miss there.
---
Xbox.
---
IIRC, it was by itself.
---
It's no problem! I'm just sorry I had to be a bearer of bad news about the fate of double-wallpapered walls.
---
Yes, you can absolutely buy the barn building set plan from players! As well as the power armor workbench, but that one's *much* rarer to see for sale. If you don't mind spoilers, you can see the places where there's a chance to find one [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Power_armor_stations).
---
Unfortunately I have spares of neither at the moment or I'd offer to arrange a trade, but I wish you the best of luck designing your dream CAMP. :)
---
What I love is that the camp system is littered with bugs but THIS is what they chose to zero-in on.
---
Not sure I even wanna know. Steel is the one component i am always short on, so best be keepin to myself
---
Are you referring to explosive energy weapons?
---
You want a JE laser? I’m done with this game
---
Windows store/game pass is because they don’t actually “install” it, it is just a complete image of the game. This prevents people from mucking with the files in the game, probably to prevent people from modding it in a way that would work without game pass for those games that roll off.
---
Just having a Sell All option for each ammo would have made me happy. I'm either selling all or selling none.
---
And we remember....

- Base building is fun, but 100% preference. Nothing about it requires you spend more than 10 minutes placing the crafting elements and storage you’ll need.
---
- PvP is goddam irritating and completely unbalanced, but there are zero ways you can be forced into fighting another player. They can attack your workshops, which are just camps that give you specific scrap rss but you don’t need to engage. PvP’ers have been complaining about the game from the start.
---
- There’s definitely preferred weapons, but unarmed, sniper, lmg, you can do most any weapon and the game doesn’t require pvp so even if you are weaker then other players for your weapon choice there’s no real penalty. All weapons can reach lvl 45/50 (the lvl cap for gear)
---
- Fashion kinda depends on how in-depth you’re talking. There’s armor slots for each individual limb, and your chest. Those decide your stats but once again the game is pretty beatable with any max lvl gear and can give you a wooden hunter vibe or secret service armored soldier aesthetic. From there, you have under armor which your armor pieces will cover like last FO games. However, if you wants outfits, those are a single item that counts as pants and top, which usually have a helmet or mask that goes along with them. There are some really great looking cosmetic outfits, which can cover any armor type and keep its stats, but since the outfit is one piece for your entire body there isn’t a lot of customization. I believe the fallout wiki has a complete list of all costumes/outfits that you can look at. You can dress as a barbarian, clown, badass fire fighter, or some pink two-header cow.
---
Power Armor and fat man launchers are actually not even used often in this game the way it’s designed. Sounds like if you just like exploring, and if you’re okay with limited npc storytelling, you’d probably like the game.
---
event is delayed
---
Yet there are still options for smaller amounts. Just because you can't figure out how to use it does not mean it can't be used.
---
I just rebuilt my camp into a nice bungalow, and I'm sure glad I did so before this, because I used the crap out of that trick to make internal walls, because there is literally no other way to do that.  Maybe there's reasons they can't allow floating walls and such, but if you're gonna disallow this, they need to implement internal walls.  You don't even need new textures; just mirror the "inside" onto the "outside".  Even if wallpaper has to apply to both sides.
---
Ok, I just went back 5 min later and the ash pile was gone and I could grab my lot, is this a new future?
---
If only my assassins fatman were a hunters(i think that’s animals)
---
I tried to; my ign is Tazier
---
I'm losing my sanity over how many people are posting new threads about this.
---
I have no clue what they use but I assume so if they’re infamous for being OP in pvp. I thought there was a damage cap lol
---
I've gotten it a lot recently. THREE times on the same character in succession to be exact.
---
Reading this bullshit was almost like watching Trump’s Axios interview.
---
Or they'd make the weekly limit something low like 600.
---
The Enclave would like a word with you.
---
True. It’s not listed in most screen pop ups or manuals. So definitely something new to me.
---
You can still skip all the way to the control room so its no big deal...
---
What’s your GT? Mine is “Girthy Squid”, say yours then join my game and I’ll give you it
---
does anybody at bethesda even still play this game?
---
That's OK for Bethesda
---
Haha, first time?
---
Sounds like bug
---
I didn’t say it couldn’t be used, once again you need to read the post more carefully. I said they made it harder to convert ammo in smaller amounts
---
That was disappointing. Didn't mention it because I saw another post already said they hadn't been added. Deep-pockets are nice but I'd prefer ultra-light options for all SS armor pieces so when I switch to PA it doesn't weigh me down.
---
They’re probably going to sell us a doubled sided wall soon
---
Yeah I did it on the converter. But didn’t know it worked on others. Been a thing since FO4. But there were no funky terminal screens there so.
---
Yeah you can easily get a couple provisions worth just running through west tek
---
Apparently frozen vegetables or lemon basil pasta xd
---
Mods from Nexusmods are your friend.  
---
Look up for "Silent Scavenger Bot and Santatron", "Silent Allies" and "Silent CAMP"
---
When a games company can't even release a basic fucking update, there's reason for everyone to post.
---
Is anyone else having an issue exiting the converter? I traded in all my garbage ammo today, but had to back out of each transaction screen before I could exit the terminal. I'm on PS4, so could be an issue with consoles.
---
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
---
It's not rocket science.
---
Have it open up a vendor-type display.
---
Let me sell the ammo for AmmoPoints.
---
Let me buy the ammo on offer with said AmmoPoints.
---
Well the junk theme describes this whole patch/update.  What a pile of junk (nerfed camp building, no SS pocketed mod, etc.)
---
This has been a thing since Fallout 4. Not a lot of people know about it though.
---
Or just buy three items for one cap a piece, which is what every single wastelander that visits my camp seems to do lol
---
How would they even fix that without taking the replace feature away in build mode?
---
I'm sorry you can't convert your five 10mm shells every ten mintues when you get some.
---
if you enjoy suffering buy this game. 
---
Running around looting everything will only fill up your 800 weight limit stash, on top of that they removed alot of features in building a camp.The need to be a bloodied build to kill enemies. Having to switch perk cards to pick a lock. The need to pay 12 dollars to have unlimited scrap which should be for free users ETC ETC This game wasn't thought out well.
---
On the positve note, if you can get this game for cheap, it can be a fun and mindless loot and shoot. Stock up on xp boosting food and perks so you can level up quick as being a low level can be a pain in the arse. I played on ps4 but if you can play on a high end pc then the game will be much more enjoyable.
---
I recorded a video I'm standing in my camp and I gained a whole level at 60+
---
That atleast makes the topic more specific.
---
&gt;A cosmetic item in a game may be desirable to some, but some folks on here hate what they call a grind with a passion.
---
If someone wants something, but that something is clearly locked behind a grind that is artificially extended and designed around microtransactions and the psychological pressure to pay your way through the season until you get the thing you want, then it's a credible complaint people have about the grind.
---
&gt;Is any cosmetic honestly worth spending 50 hours of your time, when you're not enjoying it?
---
Depends on how much someone likes it and if it's the onlt way they can get it without microtransactions.  If people want something but the grind is too long for it, that's why all this complaining exists.  Whether or not people do or don't do the grind is up to them depending on how much they like the item they want, but ot doesn't change the overall point being that if people can see that desirable things are locked behind extreme grinds, then discontent is going to inevitably be expressed.
---
Oh God, that’s horrendous. My entire build is predicated on doorway-to-solid wall tricks that allow me to wallpaper interior and exterior parts of my camp.
---
We still have a VATS bug that is crippling every critical hit build but Bethesda chose to spend time and resources on *this*?
---
Edit: my working assumption is they are about to start selling interior wallpapers through the ATX store. Can’t be having any competition with those micro transactions now, can we?
---
Why would they bother with this, don't they like their players being creative with their game
---
Is this new to the patch or was this happening before? Can you tell me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username and platform?
---
I am super excited.
---
Hahaha why?
---
You think STEEL is expensive?  A single turn in of 250 steel is like fifteen super mutants.
---
You stand to make MORE out of this event than you did off of last years scorched.  Scorched drop NOTHING of value aside from the occasional ammo assuming you don't kill a melee one.  Just looking at the steel portion of these community goals if you're killing Super Mutants to break down their weapons you're getting other resources that can be used for crafting or saved up for later legs of the goals, you're getting more varied ammo, caps, gunpowder and anything else valuable super mutants drop.  On top of that scorched don't spawn as legendary and I'm pretty sure that community goal was before SB's could spawn as legendary while during this goal you can actually farm legendary enemies at the same time.
---

 &gt; Is this new to the patch or was this happening before? Can you tell me your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) username and platform?
---
Fuck that.  Join the Enclave.
---
LOL, now that you’re wrong and cornered in the argument you try and insult and make jokes at the other person
---
Enjoy!
---
tc93tilinfinity. Ill hop on now. Thanks!
---
SBQ still can't be looted half the time when you pour your ammo into her, but *SURE, LET'S FOCUS ON SCREWING UP PLAYERS' UNIQUE CAMP SETUPS BECAUSE THEY UTILIZE FLOATING WALLS*.
---
Jfc guys, do you even *care*  about the *actual*  game bugs or are y'all too worried about aesthetics?
---
Wait so if I put the short barrel and napalmer on a flamer, versus putting a long barrel and napalmer, it will increase the range at which enemies are hit? That whole part confused me.
---
So no more exploit
---
If its depth of view then it's not the same
---
Especially since every other currency uses the vendor window. Not sure why they’re trying to force the terminal on us.
---
They didnt even push the update out right. They put out the pocketed, deep pocketed, light, and ultra light for the chest but there are no mods for the limbs
---
Enclave you mean broken government 😂😂😂 but for a look of a real style of under armor you couldn't wrong with it
---
I don't play a whole lot of different games myself, but I did enjoy the Outer Worlds a lot, they're releasing a DLC for it Sept 9th and another DLC later on.
---
Lol. Man you need to have the last word? That’s actually a sign of a problem.
---
I do have bloodied build items like the bolstering BOS combat armor set with a dense chest piece, fireproof Lvl 3 and dodgy level 3 but I use a QE shotgun so I run full health when I PvP.
---
By the way 10mm shells aren’t a thing
---
Again, if you look, I never suppose the show will be bad. I actually think it could be great. Amazon has had a few very well made originals. I am just tired of modern shows because of how propagandised they are. I am looking to escape the constant barrage of advertising, not invite it into my playspace/relaxation.
---
Got anything else to give away?
---
*Cloudy with a chance of narcissism...*
---
Nope. You can’t swap between walls/windows/doorways. You’d have to place a doorway, scrap it, and then place a wall.
---
Half walls but not a solid one. I tried with solid.
---
&gt; A single turn in of 250 steel is like fifteen super mutants.
---
Which is more time consuming than killing scorched in a low level area, assuming you farmed them. Steel is also used in tons of other areas of the game, including crafting, whereas killing Scorched is part of a natural gameplay loop. Basically you didn’t have to go out of your way to progress the community goal, it was natural. Effortless even. 
---
This community challenge come accross as a sacrifice of your belongings whereas last year it was part of a natural loop like I said. The game is throwing scorched at you, whereas Steels you have to actually work for it.
---
It doesn’t matter if the carrot at the end of the stick is golden instead of copper this time around as far as community rewards are concerned, it’s **still a gamble**... People can lose more from this than they ever did by killing scorcheds. No amount of mental gymastic will change this fact. I rest my case.
---
Well when yoy think about it, I dont think it was meant to be under armour to begin with.
---
Weakest post I’ve ever seen. Absolute garbage.
---
Why did they change it?
---
[it’s not in real time but daily updates will be here ](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Dang, I guess I can never move my camp now
---
I feel you on that but the sound of sweet rewards is always good.
---
Exactly. I was unaware you were throwing a fit about not being able to convert 10 shells at a time. I also insulted you because you sound fairly pathetic.
---
could have sold the steel for 5k =0
---
What happens to a build that already used these tricks?
---
Dammit. I guess it’ll just have to be that Nuka Cola secret door that I’m definitely buying today.
---
I got lucky the other day doing this challenge. It was late at night and I was ready for bed. I just had to complete this last challenge for the day since I couldn't get on early enough to do it the next day before the reset. I played 2 rounds and was fading fast. On my third round I was hiding out in a bush and watching everything around me in photo mode. The ring was shrinking and I was in a safe place but the fire pushed a few people to move into the safe zone. I see one guy approach me. He came up to my bush and paused there. I was unarmed. I resigned myself to having to play through another round when suddenly after staring at my bush for a few seconds the other player just turned around and ran off. I thought for sure I was going to get blasted but I was spared by a fellow bush wookie. I got the bonus that round and was able to log off with my dailies complete. Thank you for your mercy.
---
Don’t touch it. It’s legacy now.
---
Read the fucking patch notes.
---
God this patch is disappointing. No new event we were all looking forward to, no fast travel fix, no queen cripple fix and now they want my scrap for literal garbage in return. If there were scrip rewards maybe. If the BOS community event had BOS plans drop then hell yeah but the BOS has nothing from the BOS and they all my steel for a beret I won't use? I'll do the collectron but wow Bethesda is really not delivering.
---
Thanks kind stranger
---
When I cut the power to mine they still seem to be operational and accessible and I’ll be dammed if I scrap them just to restock once I’ve made some purchases.
---
Are they free too?
---
You need a hug or some shit today, dude?  Jeez.
---
Honestly, if they can't do the one thing walls are supposed to do without workarounds, they are.. well junk.
---
Just joined your server. Ill find you now.
---
But you can still replace walls with windows and do it that way?  "Fixing" this was a waste of time since theres another way to do it.
---
Yes you get Atlas donor supplies for the 250 steel, they seem to have random loot inside them. Healing items and alcohol, only gotten 2 so I do not know what else is in them.
---
Sounds like it! Thanks!
---
There goes my method for making shop windows. Thanks.
---
6.99$, stop giving atom shop ideas.
---
I sound pathetic for complaining about a bad feature? What kind of logic is that???
---
My build is as I left it (I used the double wall trick), I just can't change it now because I can't recreate it.
---
Nope same future, different time line
---
That now only works for half walls so far.
---
First time I did it in skyrim I had about 1600 arrows so when I did it with ammo is was almost nostalgic how similar it seemed to a game mechanic that was 8 years old
---
Do any gaming companies listen to their players anymore? Do any dev's actually play the frigging game for that matter? This is just pathetic, fix actual game impacting bugs, make the game whole and hale and you'll have happy paying customers? How frigging hard is that to grasp? Sad state of affairs in the gaming world right now, this is not how a company should be run. Someone needs to hire competent people who know what the hell is going on. I spit in your general direction bethesda!
---
I’m only like 130 with a 1st box and I’m still not giving them shit 😂
---
Or keeping my sub, either. There’s better games to play.
---
Game crashed, be right back lmao
---
OK, but I'm still going to come back to it being a cosmetic item, that makes no difference to anything. Also, I gotta say, it's not really a grind. Play normally, and you get most of the Score points. If you're not playing enough to get 6/7 score a day, then does it matter that you're not getting a cosmetic item, that does nothing, in a game you're not playing?
---
Eh, I understand what you're saying, but it all goes over my head why it's a big deal, even something worth complaining about.
---
But then, like I said in my first response to this, I'm probably not the target audience.
---
Shit you got me definitely not pathetic person.
---
I just saw it and haven't recovered yet, and I'm not even american
---
I agree. Or make them weigh a LOT less.
---
I know, other guy just mentioned it. I thought since it worked for the triangle one sit would work for full one but I guess not
---
Well, that list makes me want to donor shit.
---
Upvote because why the fuck do they “patch“ this, and not the fucking game-breaking glitches? For fuck’s sake, have some priority!
---
Are you talking about the camo fatigues or the officer suit? Also how do you get the camo one
---
No more double wallpapers for interior walls either then, right? Back to having an awkward ugly interior wall on one side then.
---
Only the clowns at Bethesda could think that limiting the creativity of their player base is a good thing 🤡
---
Dude. Fuck that. I’ve been playing for the last year as a FO76 “First”/Premium member  and I’ll be deleting that game off my Xbox **until they fix this shit and unsubscribing.**
---
**Learned it with Blizzard, hurt them in the WALLET first.**
---
It’s literally a building system: if I want to swap a wall for a window it shouldn’t be turned into a PITA. It sounds like **they’re trying to force players to use more resources.**
---
Its a hassle but doable I guess. That just really sucks for creativity though.
---
Mine too, I like this freebie!
---
It is absolutely mind-boggling how players will hear a single piece of information and it becomes scripture, and somehow are completely oblivious all other and subsequent pieces of info.
---
you just can't jump through that one part of the roof anymore
---
... You do realize the package rewards are incidental, and the emphasis is on the community rewards, yeah?
---
I mean feel free to block them off, it's just the polite thing to do to *also* cut the power so others won't waste caps travelling to your CAMP.
---
I agree it's better than nothing but inferior to the 2008 version from The Pitt in Fallout 3 certainly.
---
The real question tho, is it worse than the previous incarnation. Not counting the point cap increase obviously.
---
I found my set at Thunder Mountain Power Plant in one of the tents. Though I have also seen them in the antique store near Watonga
---
Was the random spawn Nuked?
---
Also good for heavy gun/PA builds. Sometimes 5 AGIL is all you need for a tank like that
---
You mean exploit, it isn't a bug, people have to actively place their tents there for it to do that.
---
I know man. I enjoyed building so much. I don't even wanna log in today.
---
It involves everyone's favorite merchant, Grahm, so there is all the incentive you need!
---
Agreed, revert this change.
---
Does anyone at Bethesda even still test the game?
---
The digital camo fatigues. I honestly can’t remember where mine came from. Appalachian Antiques or Technical Data quest maybe?
---
Cool. I dig it then!👍🏽
---
Are you serious? That was the only way you could make your interiors look nice
---
Don't worry, I'm sure there's a crap load duped on burner accounts that people are gonna try to auto complete the whole thing. Keep your JUNK/SCRAP. I certainly am.
---
What’s your points spread across the different categories like strength, perception, etc?  I may have to take a bunch out of strength
---
Captain Rahmani's "Oops all garbage" cereal, available now
---
Does donating give any XP?
---
The mods are NOT at Regs, I was there and they are not in the game. Yay.
---
They did that? I don’t believe I earned the last Christmas reward, the jacket since I think it needed a lot of XP.
---
Sorry, I thought you were implying that it was bad during testing or something. Still, I don't agree that it's "bad". It was clunky, yes, but the patch today seems to have taken feedback into account and improved its use.
---
It was never a thing.
---
Dont.  I dont think adrenaline maxed is really worth it.  The vast majority of the extra damage comes from the first point.
---
Just store the wall
---
It has a chance to spawn at Appa Antiques, but I think its a guaranteed spawn at Thunder Mountain Power plant in a tent.
---
**Secret Service Armor:** Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79. 
---
Ummm.. no this was not added!  Come on that was one of the highlights for me.  For that you should just make the Torso plans be universal. I shouldn't have to buy them for the limbs now.  Just make them Pocketed and Deep Pocketed and work for all SS armor.
---
What reason do they have for needing to remove the double wall bug though, was it somehow causing any more server stress then if that wall was somewhere else in your camp?
---
That sound is known amongst my friends as the "bathesda buzz" lol
---
Workshop is so time consuming to use. What a waste of development time.
---
Seems like Rad-X is not suppresing mutations anymore. Should it be like that? Well my back is happy
---
My base is legacy now!
---
Yeah that's why I was posting.
---
It was due to a bug
---
50 gig update for game pass and this game still doesn't run what a surprise.
---
Thanks!
---
So what happens if my current camp is using that door way trick for double wallpaper, and say, I log in tonight.. would it be there or will I be forced to scrap/store them?
---
I briefly considered swapping out my loadout for Chinese Stealth Armour to go have a look, but decided it wouldn't be worth it.
---
This makes no sense at all esthetically the fence is very different. You are stretching.
---
I mean you kinda did, “brand cowardice”, “totalitarian storytelling”, and “linear propaganda” aren’t compliments. But at least we can agree it could be something enjoyable.
---
But it sounds like your issue is with an entire industry, I don’t think Bethesda can be held responsible for those issues, whether by opinion or facts. I doubt we’ll see brand recognition in the same way though. Most of the companies are spoofs of real life organizations and it wouldn’t really fit to see a Pepsi ad when Nuka Cola dominates the market, and if we did see marketing like that it seems like Fallout would be the perfect place for obvious marketing tactics. Their pre-war world was flooded with 50’s-inspired propaganda to the point people believed a robot with a flamethrower could be a good babysitter. 
---
The entire universe is basically a campy horror flick with a AAA budget.
---
I'll have to give it a look
---
You should contact a lawyer about a class action lawsuit.
---
How does that work? Never seen that trick before, and was a big fan of elaborate exteriors
---
Bethesda causes confusion with the way they put out information.    Today's  inside the vault said that the event was weeks away.  But there was an earlier article centered around patch 21 that also said that they were putting the finishing  touches on Colossal problem without specifying a release date for the event.  It isn't hard to understand why many people expected it to be in the patch today. Bethesda should really just stick to talking about stuff that is actually coming in the next patch
---
Huh I had my own older method, not sure if it’ll work tho still. 
---
Build a foundation floor, attach a wall, and attach a flat roof. Next add a second flat roof (attached to the first one). Finally add a “floating” wall attached to the bottom of that 2nd roof.
---
Now delete everything except the floating wall, starting with that 2nd roof. You should be left with the floating wall still and nothing else 
---
If you wanna build it flush to the ground raise the foundation up a decent bit in step one, and attach a half wall. Add your roofs and you should still be able to attach a “floating” wall
---
Hope this helps
---
She's filthy bro. Absolutely covered head to toe with dirt. Get your mind out of the gutter SIR.
---
Unless your melee heavy shotgunner  u should have 5 max in strength. Bandolieer and blocker.
---
They took away a workaround, not an exploit. Geez did sometimes two sided wall grief you or somethin
---
Wait, so what does this mean for my camp? Since I’ve done this
---
Totally!  You guys are great, and I’ve really seen some people get great damage with them as well!
---
I definitely use all of the related shotty perk cards. I've never tested it without them, but maybe I will later just to see.
---
I'm still going back and forth with CS so It's not completely clear, It's almost midnight here so I should hear from them tomorrow. Besides, I'm not sure how safe or even legal (?) it is to share ticket screenshots, so I won't do that just yet. Sorry.
---
What they said initially was (roughly translated from Italian) "The team is still considering a way to accomodate affected players. I'll keep this ticket open to update you as soon as the patch is applied", after saying that they were not allowed to send atoms, since I asked for the amount of atoms I needed to level up the four levels the bug took away.
---
Today I waited for the servers to go back online, and they did not "update" me. I messaged back asking for any update, and they basically ignored the "accomodate affected players" part, simply saying that the patch had been applied, and to confirm I hadn't lost any more score.
---
I've just written back again reminding them that Bethesda ignored the autocomplete bug for more than a year, since it was convenient for them when the challenges awarded atoms, that they didn't even care enough to put the Season system in the PTS, and that having to find a way to recover the lost SCORE should not fall solely on the shoulders of players.
---
At this point honestly I don't expect much, and am really disappointed right now, but if anything ever comes out of it other than more lies and deception, I'll make a post.
---
No. Caps, plans, chance at prime plans, stims and alcohol.
---
Just saying the brotherhood of steel should have plenty of steel
---
Cool news. HOW ABOUT ALSO LOOKING INTO WHY I STILL CANT REPAINT FOREST SCOUT INTO URBAN SCOUT.  
---
     
---
Works fine going the other way.   
---
    
---
Hate to shout but its been an issue for years. If you cant do it.. just turn both forest and urban into atom shop skins like the ghillie version you recently did for scout armour. That seems to work.   
---
Fanks.
---
I love my quad double barrel.  I don't think I'd use one holding 2 or 4 shells, but is 8 are good enough to let me kill anything other than a major boss (e.g. SBQ) plenty quick.  
---
Caveats:  VATS and a legendary giving the "magic" effect are required.  Otherwise shotguns are useless.
---
I love un-aggressive super mutant conversation. I overheard two super mutants in the Abandoned Bog Town having a conversation, one of them said he wanted to move West and the other asked “For sport or for fun, brother?” and the first one responds “Both.” Well, I probably killed them after that but I enjoyed the conversation while I heard it lol.
---
Like the plague
---
At least tge enclave lets us launch nukes
---
Oh geez you’re out 26k points? I didn’t know some players had been hit that bad by it. I really hope Bethesda ups their compensation game then, hopefully that will help.
---
Hmm... at work at the moment. How much scrap do you need for this event? I usually sell anything I have over 100 of.
---
It’s grandfathered in. Just don’t change any of those walls and it’ll be fine.
---
another PSA - you don't have to really gather them - just craft few Bulks from mats you already have and scrap them - all you loose is some plastic
---
Yeah, this is a dumb choice on their part. It could be a bug. Hopefully, they fix it. I also want to be able to float turret platforms on occasion, so I would love the old short wall hang from roofs back as well.
---
No new loot rewards inside tge packages.
---
😝
---
Look up the PA bundle when the game was released. There's a class action suit for the canvas bag. The same firm might help
---
Sorry; my second account has them and it’s loading suuupppeeeerrr slow
---
So you didn’t max the perks for scrap weight or meds, or anything like that? (Forget the names). What’s your max carry weight like?  I’m mostly worried about my carry weight getting too low.
---
At this point I think I am skipping this, for what it's worth. 
---
5000 steel scrap for a whole lot of crap,  20 supply crates of utter nonsense. 
---
I can't even justify my time supporting this, unless the rewards are more beneficial to everyone.  
---
But they won't be, just keep chasing the golden carrot!
---
I apologize for my rant, but common now. 
---
I guess at the end of the day it is just game. 
---
I wish you and everyone the best!
---
In addition, thank you for your time in putting this together, I honestly appreciate it.
---
So any word or when RUST beta gets released for console?  I think I'm done with this game for the second time!  Might have to break out my tiddly winks starter pack until Double 11 finishes porting over a real game!
---
So instead of expanding camp building they severely limited it.   Its a big part of my end game too.  Such a senseless and tone deaf move.
---
I cannot, for the life of me, understand why they keep making camp building harder. FO4's wasn't perfect but it was 10x better than this just for not giving a shit about floating whatever.
---
Post-FO3 Capital Wasteland is a literal totalitarian dictatorship.
---
That’s a feature now. It just works.
---
Srly? I didn’t even realize that was related to the other bugs. That was too smart to be a mistake, Bethesda. Why do you have to prove me wrong???
---
Won’t work... no more hanging walls off of roofs or floors. Must have a floor or foundation under it.
---
Well, about five high level players showed up in the ring shortly after it dropped. I checked the map a few minutes later and everyone moved on, so I guess there's literally nothing interesting out there at the moment. Way to waste resources and a card on a silo run lol
---
455 in a team 420 out of a team and 460 in excavator
---
We're looking into this right now.
---
Okay well that’s good, I’d cry if I had to remake a camp
---
Ughh that sucks so bad
---
That is not a good thing!!!
---
I completely agree. It's still an awful UI. I don't understand why we can't just exchange all of our ammo or a custom amount for whatever the conversion rate is...
---
I’m surprised a duper hasn’t stepped up and completed it for us yet...
---
Soon we will see player vendors selling steal for absurd prices prolly
---
In the past, you could place a doorway down facing one direction, place a wall in the same spot facing the other direction, and then change the door into a wall. End result: A wall that could have wallpaper on both sides, allowing you to build more realistic interiors. You can no longer change a doorway to a wall, you can only swap it for another doorway, which is useless for this purpose.
---
I managed to get a two-shot automatic grenade launcher and was looking forward to trying out my new toy. Leveled up and put as many perk points as possible into explosive and heavy weapons, went to Monster Mash...
---
Instakilled myself and destroyed all my armour with one shot.
---
Been sitting on sale in my vending machine for weeks now.
---
Totally agree where are the rare plans they were talking about none of them are rare.
---
Dammit, if I didn't recently lose my job I'd actually buy some atoms for that Nuka Cola pack.
---
I'll buy your account for seven billion explosive plasmas and a few trillion quantums /s
---
Steel. Dang it
---
Oooh so that's what people have been talking about. I've been off the past few days because boring
---
Lost Hills Brotherhood defeated the largest Super mutant threat in the Wasteland and defeated the Enclave at the height of their power without a robot.
---
Todd grows stronger from your tears.
---
I just tried in a workshop and it didn’t work for me
---
YES!!!
---
Welp..... good thing I finished my door-maze camp with lots of doors going to pits or just blank walls.  I literally finished it yesterday and I made liberal use of the double wall trick. 
---
Half of what i do is double walls. This is suck.
---
Thanks! You've  been a tremendous (and generous) help!
---
Unless of course it auto resets back to the default paper bag so often you give up changing it. But that never happens with any of the other ones.......
---
damn pigeons always stealin my corn.
---
Holy jeez... I only have 380 with strength maxed (all weight perks maxed) all deep pocketed armor but don’t have a decent backpack.  What’s your secret?
---
I've also had issues with the Gauss Shotgun where after firing a few shots I can't use any hotkey items or reload unless I put the weapon away and take it out again.
---
lol I’ve been a chef for 5 years mate, so I know what a Karen is, and this is probably coming from someone that has no idea what it’s like to deal with these people on a daily basis 🤣
---
1) and what evidence do you have that you’re speaking for a majority? This post has a lot more upvotes than you do... 
---
2) never demanded to speak to a manager... and I wouldn’t call speaking to you a comparison of having ‘crystal clear information from a kitchen’, what you’re claiming is speculation, unless you’re employed by Bethesda? 
---
3) I’ve never implied any incompetency apart from saying if it is an issue with communication then that needs to be fixed ASAP... I literally said that more notice needs to be given when delaying something you as a company have promised 
---
4) you’re not being polite are you? At no point had I ever been rude to you then you start insulting me? So that’s more of an argument geared towards yourself sir 🤣
---
5) yeah and it’s also a response from someone that has... wait for it... worked in the service industry for a long time, I’ve been a chef for 5 years, progressed by way to managing kitchens in 3 months because I’m a damn hard worker and have been doing so ever since. Not that my life has anything to do with you and you know Jack shit about it, so why don’t you mind your own business 
---
Yeah further discussion would be pointless, there’s a difference between being demanding and being disappointed by being let down, but I imagine I could talk until I’m blue in the face and you still wouldn’t get my point. I’m not asking you to agree, I’m asking you to let others have their opinions. You commented on MY post about MY opinion, I never said you couldn’t have your own, but I’m entitled to mine, so take your bs somewhere else
---
Ill take it.
---
I'd do it for the quantums
---
What’s god damn hilarious is that someone or multiple people actually spent lots of time “fixing” it and made it worse but tout how much better they think it is.
---
I’m gonna use this term lol
---
The ammo conversion is useless since people sell unused ammo for 1 cap. So basically the community is already doing it better.
---
It’s in aid: Atlas Provisions
---
No. There is no actual fixes for game. As others 20 patches. What Bethesda really should do?  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3gegy/an_updated_list_of_weaponrelated_issues_still_in/ But they won't.
---
Cool thanks
---
Your English teacher would be ashamed you forgot your “” on fix
---
Yes I’ve been dying for more wasteland themed stuff - less kiddy stuff
---
You shouldn’t have to pay for that, it should be free or added in the game. I already bought the wallpaper from the atomic shop, I shouldn’t have to also buy the wall to put it on.
---
It's in the aid section right at the top.
---
I cannot believe this.   Personally this was one of the things I was most excited about.  How can they screw this up?
---
A workshop or a camp? In my camp I was able to burn down a full brick wall and double it up.
---
Just tried again with wood walls... doesn’t work. What kind are you using? Let’s get the word out there!
---
If their dev team is similar to other development teams, they get reviewed by their supervisors based on new code implemented and bug fixes per patch(sprints). This was an appealing issue to "fix" since it required little effort patch out on the behalf of a dev.
---
And taking next to no damage.
---
Once you’ve finished a quest I with them it’s done. Only thing you won’t get are random appearances from the characters that are related to that ally - ATHENA won’t show up to trade unless the commander is at your camp.
---
You also get a daily quest to complete for each ally, so you can only complete that if they’re at your camp. Besides that, nothing to worry about!
---
Hmmm is it the 10000xp challenge?  I always forget that one is there.
---
So, they're pretty much like they are in *Fallout 4*?
---
Do you run the adrenaline perk card? Curious if the extra calc has put some lag in?
---
To be fair there IS actual "Rare Plans" in that reward table (at least on the console version were the plan hasn't been Duped so much) if you find these plans useful or not is another matter entirely. 
---
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong but those Raider Armor plans are extremely rare to the point where a player has **ONE** chance of getting them per character for completing the quest Signal Strength. Just how rare?
---
We're talking about 1.96% chance of getting a Heavy Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan, a 2.94% chance of getting a Sturdy Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan and a 5.88% chance of getting a Light Raider Torso/Arms/Legs Plan.  
---
So I will keep donating my resources for a chance at getting those Raider Armor plans that I'm missing.
---
Ok, I’ll try brick
---
Just going to speculate here that the reason this has been “fixed” is because we’re going to get interior wallpapers through the ATX soon, and the wall trick would directly compete with that.
---
You turn in 250 at a time for steel and the grand total needed is is over 100 million for each, its a different number for each though
---
This! I had this happen to me last week sometime and I still can’t build more. I didnt even think anything killed them since I had them blocked off and up high. They’re just gone. 
---
Yikes.
---
is there anything cool in the loot pool?
---
Yea progress is saved and continues with each individually
---
&gt;but I'm still going to come back to it being a cosmetic item, that makes no difference to anything
---
Since a cosmetic is a difference in visual customization options for people, it's a difference, since visual customization options fall under "anything".
---
&gt;Also, I gotta say, it's not really a grind. Play normally, and you get most of the Score points.
---
It is a grind.  What is "play normally"? Score point challenges require you to do specific things which by odds will not be completed most of the time unless you deliberately go out of your way to do them.
---
&gt;If you're not playing enough to get 6/7 score a day, then does it matter that you're not getting a cosmetic item, that does nothing
---
Since a cosmetic item changes visual appearance, as part of customization, "does nothing" isn't accurate.
---
&gt; in a game you're not playing?
---
You mean a game *you're not playing long enough to meet the challenge grind requirements of?
---
&gt;But then, like I said in my first response to this, I'm probably not the target audience.
---
Probably not, as i said before the majority of complaining i assume is focused in two separate camps.  1) some people who actually like/want some of the cosmetic rewards on the LR but are frustrated with how long the grind is.
---
2) some people who don't like any of the cosmetic rewards but want the atoms (since betheada took away daily/weekly atoms challenges) because they want some of the cosmetics on the atom shop but legitimately complain that the atoms are too few and are reduced from what we could earn before.
---
In any case, if you yourself simply don't care about something, then part of understanding why people complain about something you don't, is understanding that sometimes other people will care about something you don't.
---
It has come to their attention, that the player base has been enjoying content within the game for free that has not been intended. As such, they have patched the issue and added it to the atom shop as a pay item. You may also enjoy said ~~bug~~ feature, buy purchasing a failout 1st  subscription.
---
95% of players got fo1st
---
90% of players dupe
---
This sub gets weird sometimes.
---
Or at the very least let us sell those damn things.
---
I already bought wallpaper, the prefab should be in the game already.
---
Nope :(
---
Yeeessssss agreed
---
NP :)
---
“Issue”
---
Didn't like her anyway
---
Uny armour. Radicool. Deep pockets on limbs. High capacity back pack. Herd mentality marsupial. The perk that reduces mutation negative effects
---
You're right, and I was thinking of moving too but guess Floopwood has to stay put
---
How is it worse?   
---
You only need to know what ammo you're trying to sell. No counting required.  
---
Hit the largest value until it says "no"   
---
Hit the second value until it says "no"    
---
Hit the smallest value until you've sold everything.    
---
Hit *back* after each transaction. No fucking about.
---
Did anybody figure out what the community rewards will be?
---
Just tell us who to hate for prioritizing this as a fix
---
The Enclave and the BoS do not have beef yet and won't have for almost two hundred years. To be honest the Brotherhood can't even begin to grasp something like the Enclave exists. Stop time-travelling your beef into a game that takes place waaay before Fallout 2.
---
I know right? Shame on these people for getting the unfair game breaking advantage of having a nice looking camp
---
You are correct! Great find, my friend! Thank you!
---
Not to mention the load of NEGATIVE bugs that actually effect the game (case in point fast travel bug). No one, not a single person, wanted this wall thing changed.
---
They still appear on the map even when unpowered though. I don’t block off mine but just letting you know
---
Please do! We use it pretty much whenever a game randomly drops you to desktop lol
---
 interior walls should be a feature.
---
Nice roast attempt but I'm 54 and my dad's still not only around and but even at age 90 or so could read media releases better than you lol. You really need to read stuff. Failing that, googling would be faster than asking here.
---
I always thought it was intentional on their part. The brick especially seemed so seamless when stacked against each other and it looked so good. Seriously disappointing.
---
Not really,  they helped the protagonist at best,  who truthfully could have done it without them,  evidenced by the fact that by the events of new Vagas the ncr had all but obliterated them,  and they couldn't even fight off an army of cosplayers with lawn mower blades
---
Some fucking devry graduate running shit and giving terrible priorities.
---
Rain collector collects dirty water: which can then be boiled without getting rads from collecting the water in the first place.
---
Yep, the "improvement" really sucks. Why can't we just drop the ammo we don't want into the ammo converter and get points in return? Why is a UI needed at all.
---
"I have no idea how many players are even playing 76"
---
Kinda throws a wrench into your theory.
---
i dont have time to complete the lgendary run. i just got the ammo converter.
---
I would not be surprised if its ~50 people
---
It’s a feature duh.
---
Community "please fix the fast travel bug"
---
Bethesda "..."
---
Community "please fix the Queen not being crippled"
---
Community "yay at least we get the colossal problem event" 
---
Bethesda "actually no and we wasted our resources to put an end to YouTubers and community posters doing creative things with their camp that shows off and gets people excited to play and try new designs because we can't give actual ways of even simply creating interior walls"
---
What about fixer skins?! Really wanting to use that dark matter skin!
---
How much steel they need?
---
It does passively collect dirty water!
---
It's way faster to make rounds of West Tek and Line in the Sand and break down weapons to make steel than owning freaking Grafton Steel. Which made Steel. On an industrial scale. Logically it should yield more steel than a few rifles and the odd missile launcher.
---
Workshops in this game are useless.
---
Edgy as heck
---
Shotguns with limb damage are energy weapons? Huh, you learn something new everyday
---
I mean, great in terms of what makes a show great, not pleasurable to me personally. From what I can tell from every show these days, people love them some artful propaganda. I will probably watch it like I do most all shows these days - out of a side-eye.
---
Yeah I know but still. We need to make sure new players have a good experience so they can help us out.
---
Another code merge error?
---
I agree. Bethesda, you need to beat your ass.
---
What do you mean?
---
&gt;Because it was an issue...
---
Camp building has absolutely no impact on the game's three currency based economies, or combat.   To spend time and effort on "bugs" related to camp building, before working on actual gameplay issues is ludicrous.
---
Passively collects dirty water!
---
Holy crap that’s some amazing work right there!
---
I donated 1k steel, then look at the rewards online, and i was like fuck this lol.
---
Make sure at least 10% of the game works before release
---
I agree, that's why said this much steel seems like way too much! Unless you're duper
---
I had someone nuke Uncanny Caverns and tell me they thought the event was on, sorry my guy you wasted everybody's time including your own.
---
I want to take what you say seriously, I really, really do.  But then I see your user name and I giggle....
---
Beat your own ass show who’s boss.
---
D) A reason for a bunch of people to go apeshit
---
No, the same as the holiday gifts and mole pails, minus the mounted heads. Oh, and no scrip like the gifts originally had.
---
Something must be off with my build then.  I have unyielding deep pocketed scout armor, marsupial, but I do not have: a high capacity backpack mod, no mentality or radicool (what is that?). Btw thanks for helping me out
---
Don't see why they patch minor things like that but are slow af to address legitimate issues
---
Like 150,000,000
---
no legendary perks or one wasteland yet?
---
I agree that the provision boxes you get from donating are bland but they pull some of the same loot that can be gotten from the mole miner pails and Christmas presents those rewards I don’t care about the community rewards are what I’m aiming for the beret the fatigues bos collectron and bos banner those are the ones locked behind reaching the goals that are set
---
I'm glad :D
---
There's a chance you could wait it out and maybe they break it out of the bundle, but that's a big maybe and it ain't gonna be anytime soon
---
wow lucky I finished my camp yesterday with the double wall and wire through wall tricks
---
I could care less about the building in this game but this really seems like a minor thing to fix when there’s so many other issues.
---
To be fair there IS actual "Rare Plans" in that reward table if you ask me (at least on the console version were the plan hasn't been Duped so much) if you find these plans useful or not is another matter entirely. 
---
But nonetheless here's the reward table: 
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W0nsHf67V3_ke0RLgsIMwPb8kpI0kLgfX_0_bZPTTs/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABc98iQy0*OyiRUOom4oJdRKb43dnQww
---
This breaks more than interior walls, I used it to do a half wall on the outside that attached a slanted roof to in order to make it look like it was bracing the floor above it.  Hard to describe but I loved the effect.  And lets not forget putting things through doorways like shelves, power lines or hiding your stove pipes and the like.
---
I'm so disappointed!
---
They haven't even fixed the bulldozer feature since Wastelanders released!
---
Thanks for ruining building for us guys! 😐
---
Seeing yall are PS4 was it a big patch?? I forgot to leave the console on overnight to update....
---
Make sure to complain on their live stream at quakecon. They even have a camp building show with some YouTuber.
---
I’ll only pay for 1st once they fix the things that actually need to be fixed. Not to mention testing those fixes so that more stuff doesn’t break
---
probably double sided wallpaper walls coming to the atom store soon.
---
We are looking into this, thank you for the report!
---
I've got a visual bug where my SCORE meter fills up every time I change servers. Doesn't seem to actually be giving me levels though.
---
Eat them, num num num
---
The rewards are complete trash.
---
Yup its faster to equip them to throw them away... pretty annoying.
---

---
 &gt; We are looking into this, thank you for the report!
---
Regardless, I shouldn’t have to spend money on something that took 0 effort to make. The new structures and shit I get, because they’re custom (at least most times) and they actually took a bit of effort. The fences are literally a fucking copy paste.
---
Well, at least Adrenaline works again. -\_-
---
i dont have time to play daily. i purposely ignored what the rewards are. when i play, if i get a reward, cool, if not, no biggie. I also didn't understand 200$ hats in TF2. But there is a market for cosmetics. I agree with you, if the cosmetic has no real change to gameplay, then it doesn't matter. However, it does matter to some. Some people got fo1st just for the NCR armor.
---
Let us sell them, let us drop them, let us not have them or make them freaking powerful!
---
My god...
---
Junk does not cause any strain on servers as the variants are limited. Steel = steel, which basically means you only need to track the number of steel somebody has got.
---
I just donated 2k steel, got 8 rewards. Nothing special, everything was aids, grenades mostly. Some weapon mod/plans that are common.
---
Yeeessss, keep trying to make sense of it all.... He likes it when you do that..... Bwahhahhahahaevillaugh....
---
I am usually *vehemently* against spamming the forums, but with this particular issue I can understand.
---
This patch they changed that underarmor to be an outfit. probably in order to make a copy for the steel dawn fatigues outfit.  
---
Armor\_BoS\_Underarmor\_BOSFatigues "Brotherhood Fatigues" \[ARMO:00056738\]  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/lbjsYjq.png](https://i.imgur.com/lbjsYjq.png)
---
this should help them fix it
---
Yep. Got a few screenrecordings of it, they where usually hiding in the houses. One time I counted 5 afk‘ers and two dead ones lol
---
You get a "loot crate" each time you donate the required items and those are the possible rewards when you open them.
---
I saw the same but it still let me complete them and I got the correct SCORE points.
---
Better. Still an obscene requirement, but better.
---
It does that to me when I get out of power armour...
---
"No" ^- ^Todd ^Howard
---
Agreed!!! So pissed off!!!
---
There goes all those lovely, different, out of this world kinda amazing builds!
---
I'm with you on this one
---
Terrible "fix". Why do they change things that players like but don't fix the thousands of real bugs? Just sad.
---
I meant they fuck up building and make it so restrictive that people say fuck it and buy the pre-made stuff
---
&gt; it cycles through every screen we had been to as we press “back”. This paired with the fact that we have to go through multiple screens repeatedly in order to sell all of one ammo type  
---
Hitting "back" goes to the previous screen. You don't need to cycle through menus, it's one button to sell, one button to go back. Then, when you're finished, hold "back" to exit, like any other terminal.
---
They're having a live stream at quakecon with a building show with some YouTuber. Make sure to complain there so they see it.
---
lol I wound not be surprised and it to be honest it’s probably Bethesda’s plan.
---
I basically am waiting for building content every time I play, it is my only true endgame. At this point I wonder if somebody is trying to tank it on purpose.
---
Oh and i just thought about something. Think about all the money they are about to loss since 95% of there $$$ comes from CAMP building add-ons hahahahaha they like literally just bleeeeped the bleeeeep out of there selves xD 
---
NOOB Money move on there part 😂😂😂
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f135cf&amp;d=sg2s01p02pg2ph2pp2pi2eu0ce0c61ic1ir2a51ao0an2a04a30lt2lu2lv2l71la2l10
---
My current build
---
Ouch hopefully not. : /
---
Unless you actually want something good they're selling.
---
“everything was aids”
---
LMAO
---
Agreed!!! BRING BACK OUR WALLS!!!
---
And here I was hoping we'd get the ancient BOS T-51b Power Armor
---
Well at least the mounted head plans were removed?
---
It is disappointing...
---
Haha can't use  my 14 INT in dialogs :D
---
Might as well.  Can this game really get any easier?
---
Thanks for the response. Good to know.
---
It's just the new icon.  I've already seen a bunch of posts.  If it says "0 out of 3" you can complete it
---
For 316 days of play time it should be 7600 atoms.
---
Ran without it for awhile. Still have 400 carry weight and the rest of the negatives don’t really matter to much. The extra carry weight is nice tho
---
I used this in EVERY build to make power lines hidden. I’m so upset about this!
---
Well, as you said it’s an opinion. Personally, I think if you dislike artful propaganda you chose the wrong game series to enjoy haha. The entire world is built around Cold War propaganda.
---
I tend to find it best to stop looking for hidden messages in every detail. Last guy I met who did that swore the lizard people were talking to us through cloud art.
---
Its not that the changes aren't good, its that its way too little, not quickly enough, and with no self awareness or regard for what everyone unanimously wants changed. Even of they did listen and fix the ammo converter, its the gall of releasing it in the state they did originally that was the biggest criticism and how long it took to rework. Additonally, 6 weeks to fix a HUGE bug in their own paid content season and also fix the single most popular perk in the game!? I mean are you shitting me? Unacceptable and they can keep their peanuts.
---
Edit forgot to add that no communication or acknowledgement about magic weapons and they are mostly why I have stopped logging in daily. I used to launch 2-4 nukes a day and farm sbq in publics, but now I cant be fucked since 50% of the time jackoff with a magic weapon instakills her and I dont get hit credit. No sbq = no reason to play.
---
No kidding, theyre not really useful as grenades at all
---
I'm so mad!!!
---
Honestly, why the hell did they do that? All my camps are going to be boring shitboxes. Thank you Bethesda for taking away the part of the game that frankly I enjoy most.
---
I don't like to get too upset at the devs but what the hell was this supposed to fix? Unless you tell me changing doorways to solid walls causes game instability then why the hell would you fix something that isn't a problem?
---
But how would you end up with a stash box full of teddies?  It says junk in stash will be auto scrapped.  Doesn't this mean there is no ability to save the item?
---
Edit: Wait I think I kind of get it now.  scrap on player, then scrap in stash, then scrap in scrapbox, and **then** the junk which it will autoscrap.  I was reading that as when you put junk in the stash box that the junk would autoscrap.
---
Wait what, how did they even get to the conclusion that Uncanny Caverns would be the place to be? Didn't imagine these mistakes would be that common, but I imagine a lot more people will be confused in the following hours then..
---
&gt;They cant fix anything,  clearly.
---
The list of fixes outlined above disagrees...
---
it depends on error code
---
What S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat is that under?
---
I couldn't believe they actually made it worse! Just let us scrap the shit for materials for God's sake! Who the fuck would come up with something like this in their right mind?
---
I didn't know that.
---
I'll be honest, I'd actually rather have the old version back at this point. Now the computer doesn't even check what you have, it just has standard quantities in lots of 100, 1000, and 10000.   
---
I don't know about anyone else, but I feel like once you burn through 10000 rounds of anything that's probably the last time you'd ever have use of that category. I would have at least wanted to sell these in lots of 10 minimum? Was that too much to ask?  
---
I obviously would prefer a f\*\*king slider but as it stands I have to agree with the OP. Decisions like this boggle my mind. I'm starting to regret buying into Wastelanders at this rate. Fool me once...
---
Hiring now prioritizes politics and PC culture over skills in the industry. It’s a problem that’s gotten worse and worse over the past three years and it’s also the reason why quality is falling across the board. Everyone knows it but you’re not allowed to talk about it or you’re a bad person and you lose your job. Most of the good people have moved on to indie developers etc.
---
Thanks Todd but we know you don’t pull the strings anymore cough cough Zenimax.
---
Someone brought up what I was thinking. They might be adding double walls to the shop. It would be a bit dirty, but I'll donate to have the option back. They should (in theory) cost less budget too.
---
A couple of times. Thanks for the tip.
---
Never before have I know that holding the back button exits the terminal, I though you just have to keep pressing back till it exits
---
Edit: roommate thought the same thing as me and both of us experienced this issue
---
I am genuinely scared theyll remove the merge glitch for decorating shelves. I dont want to have to use a display case and only have a set amount of items per shelf. I like having boxes and lights and such in them. Fuck man idk
---
Damn, i came across one for cheap a while back and gave it to my friend who was just starting out loll
---
Miniguns drop about 30
---
Cant you scrap the wall and place a door though?
---
You should be able to blacklist rewards you don’t want.
---
There's no way this effects anything because you can still build the same amount of wall regardless.
---
Brain diarrhoea
---
Same, only reason I logged in today was because of this, what a bummer.
---
While fun to come across and I'm all for these fun things, it does piss me off that this is allowed in game but we can't have something as basic and normal as individual rooms in a building all with interior walls (they removed the double wall "exploit").
---
No starfield is another studio. Fallout 76 is made by Bethesda studios Austin where the entire group is dedicated to fallout 76 and despite what the internet might think this game has actually been quite successful from what I understand. They will use a portion of their digit quake con to talk about nothing but fallout 76 and if they would have had An E3 it would have had a big presentation as well. Personally I don't get all the whinning about the game but whatever. If there was anything I'd complain about is that I no lifed the wastelanders content in about 2 weeks due to being at home due to covid 19 and ran out of stuff to do. That's not A Bad Thing because I really enjoyed the quest and am excited for the next big DLC thats coming
---
What the fuck happened im at work???
---
Il trade you a b2525 fixer for your legacy camp lol jk
---
Prison collar will make all the clothes disappear.
---
Please look into this /u/ladydevann
---
Players: camp building is too finicky loosen the restrictions
---
Bethesda: **REEEEEEE**strictions more restrictions! Gotcha covered!
---
Could anyone tell me where we need to make this donation?
---
The community events
---
No Donations until you FREE THE BUILDERS 
---
You run an event to donate materials so one group can build, while taking away the creative tools of the true builders of this game. If anything we should be donating are materials to them
---
No kidding, Bethesda really loves to shit the bed with every patch.
---
Before it was annoying but bearable to use (after the first huge ammo conversion anyway, I didn't mind it for small amounts). I wasn't bothered about it being improved but this ... this is 100 times worse than it was.
---
No one wanted it improved we wanted it completely scrapped and redesigned
---
There's a ton of bugs fixed. Just because you don't see every change as critical, doesn't mean they don't take time to fix.
---
I like your positive thinking. Fingers crossed!
---
Oh no.
---
Overkill...
---
He's actually just locked up in a closet somewhere, and when something bad happens they bring him out for the press conference. The rotten tomatoes thrown at him are his only source of food. So far he's gained 400lbs
---
Ok, that's fine, you're mad, I get it. If you feel you aren't receiving what you paid for, I would suggest cancelling your subscription and playing something else for a while. After all, they say vote with your wallet. The subscription isn't for new content or bug fixes anyway, you are paying for a tent and a scrapbox and a few free cosmetics.
---
At least you agree that complaining on this thread is not the correct path. Perhaps compile your thoughts on the game into something other than an angry wall of text, take a breath, and write something compelling to post in a new thread. We know they do listen to some extent, they have made changes to the ammo converter in a way we've asked for. Now if they can award ammo points instead of missiles for events, then they will have really listened and we'll know it.
---
Hey there! Looking into this as well.
---
Well, hopefully it'll save you a little bit of time in future.   
---
It's probably more important in 76 than it was in 4 since you can get attacked while you're on the computer. It's handy to be able to "eject"
---
They’ll fool you again, don’t worry, keep your head up.
---
Yeah I figured, just the person was talking like there had actually been a statement by Bethesda so I was wondering if they actually gave a reason
---
Had a heart attack when I saw one of my display weapons no longer there where I hung it... turns out it is still there, just not visible at all. First time this ever happened, so definitely a new bug of sorts.
---
Omg yes please. I need this.
---
I'm waiting for that to be a feature in the g-d atom shop.
---
Welcome to the wacky world of the gauss shotgun. 
---
Use gun fu to make things better
---
also learn to jump and shoot
---
This game desperately needs modders to fix it.
---
"In the coming weeks" ok so we should expect this around October..
---
Depends on your play style and if you toggle in and out of vats
---
The "need" is for immersion, it would suck too if everything was way too easy or too quick
---
Thank you! And thank you very much for responding!!!
---

---
 &gt; Hey there! Looking into this as well.
---
I nuked Atlas out of frustration
---
I'm surprised that there isn't any scrip or even any BOS plans. Nope just the same plans any player would already be dropping as even the new players have them by now
---
Lololol
---
No matter how much better this game gets people are always going to hate on it . If that’s all they want to do then they should just leave . Let people who want to enjoy it actually get to enjoy it
---
That would be cool but idk it's been suggested since launch
---
You ok there bud?
---
So if you have a circular CAMP currently placed in game does it go to hell when you log in or is it a survivor of sorts until you decide to move CAMP again?
---
No, that sucks
---
Please, someone give me an explanation of how building a floating wall causes server instability.
---
How am I supposed to believe that I can build 1 foundation, 4 sets of stairs and have that support a max budget CAMP up in the air, but I can't build some floating walls around my resource collector?!
---
To be honest, I kinda see their point on this one. This isn't a game breaking pvp bug or a bug that gives advantages or a bug that harms another player. The only thing this bug did was allow creative people to be creative in their building. I personally used it to put interior wallpapers up. I'm not going to sit there and QQ about other bugs they could fix, but it does seem like something they didn't really need to do and that actively harms some of their community.
---
I came here wondering why they changed it
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if Bethesda just adds a ton a the junk to save face and pretend the player base is contributing more than we are.
---
I'm actually on the toilet so this worked out perfectly.
---
They likely fixed something unrelated and it messed something else up. Especially if a certain trick is considered a bug then anything they add could change the trick entirely. 
---
I do think they should fix it but I at least want to rationalize what happened.
---
Hold B on Xbox
---
Mines usually end up on the roof but it’s been like that a while
---
We need to write a letter to Trump. He knows his walls
---
Youd think they would give plans to craft the BOS fatiges/uniforms/T-60 power armor pieces/Bos paints for said T-60. Nope. Just a big F.
---
Your best bet would be support but it is unlikely they will be able to assist you. :(
---
G'd it.... bugged at the PA armor room today.
---
Aaawwwww ..i was looking forward to some cool new swag : /
---
I used to be able to place doorways where a wall (for whatever reason) wouldn't place, and then switch it to a wall or window. 
---
Also, I use the half-wall down from the ceiling decoratively, it helps define rooms in an open floor layout.
---
Lmao poor Devry getting dragged because Bethesda is so incompetent lol I think they haven't hired a new dev since they started the company.  Probably a bunch of friends and bros that are no longer qualified to make games in a modern age just attempting what they can with their old outdated engines
---
I just told this to someone who went on a rant. Hold down B on Xbox and whatever the equivalent on ps4(I think O but I don’t have one).
---
Huh. Not perfect, but better than nothing. Thank you.
---
Does the bench still at least work? I'm at work so havnt got to play sence the patch but I feel like we should be happy its not worse and they don't work at all
---
I'm a chronic hoarder. I pick everything up and use the scrapper perk card. I also do more melee than my 50 so I don't use mats that often for bullets.
---
Exactly lol bare minimum if Bethesda actually sobers up and that's a big IF.
---
Yea, my leg fell asleep, so I just sat on the floor for a bit. The usual.
---
I have that set but it only seems to do it at midnight or later.
---
Lol, still working?
---
Yeah like how can they miss the BOS plans for the BOS event? How do they miss mark by so much.
---
I just don't understand what would be so hard about implementing an interior wall so that we don't have to use up extra (and valuable) camp budget doing the double-up trick in the first place.
---
Well this makes me sad. The creative builds people could do were pretty entertaining. Any limit even a minor one is a shame.
---
Oh yeah benches work properly. 
---
Just your char is too far forward and it looks daft
---
Lmao you have got to be kidding me, did they fuck that up too ????
---
Seconded, however it can only hold 2 bottles before being full.
---
Well I'm not donating shit now 🖕
---
Good thing it's only for 10 days
---
Actually it was just discovered you can do it with full brick walls. Place one, flamethrower it and build another one facing it. Works with doorways, solid and windows.
---
On the patch notes we were promised deep pocket mods for the secret service limbs. However, if you go check at vault 79  its not on there.
---
Thanks!!
---
Ha ha ha! Sometimes it's just pure gold up in this sub. I was so hoping for a response like this when I saw the title. Not disappointed 😂
---
What happened? I think I missed something
---
I'm going on creative strike. All my camps will be a giant middle finger covered in light up profanity, no resources, and me afk, just a guy in his underwear and a beer hat playing Beefheart on full volume over the mic.
---
Funny story, the 100x option does not work.
---
Still had to do the 10x a 100 times to turn in my grenade hoard.
---
Bethesda wants your wallet, dinner, first born and the shirt off your back for them junk walls hahaha
---
I read your post and the first thing I thought of was oh God venders where broke for like a month how long will it take to fix a craft bench
---
Donated all my steel for a total of 7 crates, and not a single plan amongst them. To the kind hearted stranger that dropped his loot right there, thanks, at least I scored the boxing gloves plan. Says a lot about grind versus reward when that was the high water mark!
---
They are better off not reading them, they would be even more disappointed
---
You convinced me I'm nuking atlas
---
Do you hear that ? Now, I tell you. Now !
---
That new menu and "fixes" made that item waay worse.
---
Do the Miner Miracles quest. Or buy it for like 1k caps or something in Watoga
---
I’m glad I stopped playing after Wastelanders. I hope in a year or 2 I can come back and we won’t have to deal with these issues. Until then I’m Grounded
---
Wires can still be done with the window.   Any other items placed in doorways will have to be rugged in now
---
Yes but the replace method allowed some sweet glitches like running power lines through a wall and so on.
---
Yup, bad development insight on their part. This whole uproar could have been avoid with them adding the ability to have interior walls.
---
It was probably easier and they needed to say they did something
---
Thanks :/. I’ll try it out I guess.
---
Poor bastards.
---
They didn't test it.
---
It was bad and clunky, now it is just clunky.
---
I sure hope you're right. They're overdue!
---
&gt;Let's make this the 1st of many posts then.
---
You almost had the right idea.
---
Bethesda honestly doesn't give a shit about people complaining. They won't even acknowledge this kind of thing most of the time if it doesn't directly affect their revenue.
---
What I'd suggest that people do is to hit Bethesda where they actually care - revenue. Don't renew your Fallout 1st subscription or just cancel it and don't purchase atoms if that's something you tend to do.
---
Also, don't engage with the game at all. Don't participate with new BoS event. For the first two events, you're not missing anything anyhow. Just some reskinned items no one is going to be impressed that you have.
---
Put your money where your mouth is. Otherwise, Bethesda will just ignore this like they do all the past requests of a similar nature.
---
You saw how quickly Bethesda turned around a fix for the vendor/display case issue once people started unsubscribing Fallout 1st en masse. No different here.
---
Just did it.
---
Yeah, but this one.... this one makes my brain hurt.
---
They have the same loot pool as presents and pales. Waste of time.
---
Building fun isn't supposed to be on the roadmap until next season.
---
This really sucks but... Jesus Christ people, the drama levels in this thread are pushing beyond the absurd.
---
I probably would have made more of a rant post if work benches didnt work anymore haha
---
How many people do you think are actually going to reach that point. They did this for two reasons, one is to reduce the free atoms, and second is for numbers. This would actually help because the people who will only do the dailies will still get on (good for numbers) and the majority of people will never even reach this point (keeps the overall atom output low), unless they buy their way forward
---
I’m using gun fu etc, the gauss shotguns that I’ve will definitely not work in vats or without.  
---
I un equipped all my cards I signed out of the server and back in. 
---
I then inserted my cards and no difference. 
---
Believe it or not, I’m using a 10mm pistol with zero gunslinger cards and it’s doing so much. 
---
I certainly can’t play this game anymore with the gauss shotguns which was my number one. 
---
I’m going to go to the scrip with them.
---
Damn just when I was falling head over heels for the game. This might make me stop. Building is the best part of the game and its already frustrating enough. The fact that ANYONE at Bethesda would have thought we’d want these changes is baffling.
---
Anyone else still having the elbows pads for the regular SS under armor appearing as camouflage?
---
they removed the ability to replace walls with other types of walls, only materials. so no more doors to walls. no more interior wall tricks or roof tricks or other unique little tricks you could do to make your camp stand out and not just be a box.
---
Oh shit that's bad, I forgot about that glitch. They honestly need to just make it optional to not use power lines, Settlement Electricity Overhaul was lit on Fallout 4. Thanks for explaining
---
The raider gives weapons, ammo, and chems
---
I did the mistake of purchasing both thinking I can put them both in my camp at the same time
---
Here's your math!

Worst case, you can get about 30,000 rounds of .44 converted to max out the cap, saving "only" 90.1lb of stash space.
---
Edit: Ran out of time to do energy and special ammo. But the rebuy looks to be about the same, so if converting back to the store ammo type, it's a \~60-80% loss when buying back the same ammo type. Not efficient as a means of storage, but converting from a useless caliber to one that you can actually shoot makes it worth it.
---
I just went to Regs and he doesn’t have them.
---
What the f of update is this?
---
Jesus fucking Christ youre right. I looked 4+ times through his whole inventory. Its just not in the game...
---
If this outcry about this change tells them anything, it's that players seem to care more about issues with camp bulding than issues in any other portion of the game. All of this "Fix CAMP, NOW!" will make them focus on it even more and neglect the other bugs even more :(...
---
Nice, fucking hate these dev's at this point.
---
I think this has to do with lighting and shadows but I'm not sure
---
The ammo converter is still stupid, I wanna see how much ammo I have to exchange cause I can’t remember shit
---
You sadly can't sarcasm people into participating in things they don't want to do. I mean, that would be amazing, but it doesn't happen.
---
Yeah I always look for stuff I want first, changing teams for the free travel and jumping camps until I'm about to log out.
---
The other day I was lucky enough to get the Stim diffuser plan for just 250 caps. I thanked the dweller by also buying all their 3k .45 even though I already had more than 10k on me.
---
Watch this question be ignored by the community managers.
---
They are, but there are also a lot of "but"  
---
1. At the moment it is violation of ToS / CoC
---
2. Without source code and/or documentation it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on in that files and if you succeed in that, the second problem is gathering altogether back. Also there are a lot of limitations, simply you cannot write to file to save some stuff.
---
3. I'm not quite sure that there is backend validation of essential stuff, without this part "official" modding may lead to additional glitches
---
It has no effect on the game other than aesthetics. Item count and camp budget still applies.
---
Very dangerous, you can easy lost everything
---
I literally came home and spent 3k gold for secret service limbs and legs because i read in the patch notes they added deep pocketed plans.  Looking for deep pocketed.  Not here.  Bastard
---
Really? They appear as vendors even when unpowered?
---
Bethesda? more like BetheSAD   :(
---
And make double sided walls which this glitch allowed so you can have walled rooms in a building and have it wallpapered. So that's not possible anymore either.
---
You are awesome and I love you.
---
I actually look forward to finding out what they broke every update.
---
Any datamined rewards list? I want to know if I can get some new plans or outfits from those rewards boxes.
---
But hopefully without those annoying floating black boxes......
---
They made it so you can't have rooms inside a camp that have wall paper on each side
---
were you in a public team?
---
Good luck!
---
I’m so confused. I am away from home and thus haven’t been on recently. We’re you able to place windows in doorways or what?
---
Oh shoot I haven't heard of that one
---
Superb.
---
Used to be a sweet event, then it was lame. Then they made it sweet again finally, now it's dumb Cuz of the tent gimmick.
---
That only stops you killing yourself.
---
I still think Beth should transfer all the building parts from FO4 (maybe excluding workshops) to FO76. As well as increasing C.A.M.P. budget a little would give buiding a little more love for "that-one-sign-you-wanted-to-put-on-your-walls-but-then-you-would-have-remove-a-turret". Perhaps easing the construction rules, like one's unability to build stuff without access, would be a great addition to "camping".
---
Then don't do it. Not every daily is required to complete the legendary run.
---
Yep, they said in one of the past patch notes you can no longer cripple her wings
---
I’m convinced no one still working there knows how the building works
---
Probably because of my terrible typo. The fences they are selling don’t remotely resemble your floating walls. Connecting the two things doesn’t make much sense.
---
My dude, Evey good builder used to switch walls. It's like the MOST basic function. Now it's gone...
---
After running multiple Queens and other events, I didn't know what ammo I had, nor the amounts.  While I like the 1x option, I'd rather not have to go through every ammo type to see what can be removed from inventory, or waste time looking through my inventory. Just list the selling types that I possess, and remove the extraneous ones.
---
Well is there anyway for me to do it if I use my main copy on PS4 and my copy on steam
---
So long as the team is decently outfitted, that won't be so bad in the grand scheme of things. If Turtle can beat it AND all of the Spawns with just a Vampire's weapon (so, not all damage possible as a Bloodied build), by himself, I think those of us with less than optimal weapons and guilds will be good to go (unless some lower levels decide to fill up an instance). 
---
I actually think, despite the smaller player count, it could run far more smoothly than the SBQ, purely due to being in a separate instance and having a smaller space rendered. Of course, it seems very busy overall, and I'm worried that consoles may not be able to handle the insanity in terms of framerate.
---
As for my playstyle, I'm new to low-health builds (jumped from PA heavy to low-health shitty), so I'm still learning how to manage my health. I'm only running with one Bolstered, with 4 Unyielding, so I may swap out one piece for a second Bolstered and see how that helps. I'm lucky enough to be running a decent Gauss Shotgun and a magic piece of Unyielding armor, so I'm not worried about my damage output (though I'm incredibly curious how much damage I could actually do to Earle).
---
Did you ever find a fix for this?
---
There is no cure as far as I know.  Just something we have to deal with as xbox players.
---
I just rebuilt my entire base underground 😂
---
Agreed, one of my characters users a quad double barrel and in vats, like magic it ACTUALLY just works.
---
Most of those rewards are the same as presents so most people already have all of them if they’re over like lv 100
---
It's the bulk of this thread. I just learned about it my self.
---
You have to be very careful because containers will still reset when swapping characters and dropped bags have been known to disappear too.
---
Someone posted - try buying/selling something to duchess and then return back to him, worked for me last week.
---
Changing walls has been in since BETA....
---
It's on the front page of this very sub.
---
&gt; Why are we wasting time fixing stuff that doesn't actually need fixing 
---
Bethesda does this all the time. 
---
Remember the power armour fix that no one asked for and broke power armour for months afterwards and we still feel the effects of to some extent even til today?
---
Remember that light bulb in the toilet of Watoga High School that needed fixing badly?
---
Just aim and shoot? is it that hard without vats? 🤔
---
Yes sort by popular.
---
Spoiler:  they suck.
---
Don't move it ever...
---
A million thank yous once again. Literally one of the most generous things someone has done for me in a game. You deserve all the good things karma has coming your way!
---
Oh, I didn't know that was even possible
---
Not cool when they remove the feature from the game and then charge for it via microtransaction.
---
Well that just complicates everything, because I prefer to not trust someone else with everything
---
Just got 20 before seeing that they are a total waste. Can't even give them away.
---
Tried that. Hopped servers and tried again. Still not working. I'll just wait till Sunday like I've been doing.
---
I hope you LOVE PvP if you play Rust and don't get attached to your bases.
---
You mean the Fallout First reward outfits?
---
Is it so much to ask for an “all” option? Jesus Christ. I don’t want any of this 10mm. If converting all of one kind of ammo will cause me to overflow the points limit, warn me, but just let me get rid of it all in one click.
---
So, I actually thought it was interesting to have a game with fantasy politics that weren't some thinly veiled straw-men for current political interests. Like, it lets you shoot whoever you want (besides kids, few others) in the face. Propaganda is far too desperate in its aims to allow this kind of exploration to occur within it. To me, if the game had propaganda in it innately - it is about how propaganda is absolutely key to thermonuclear pseudo-apocalypse and is full of shit. EDIT all art with a point of view could be said to be propaganda, there are degrees of it. I am not looking for any more.
---
Donations to the brotherhood? How and what purpose does that serve?
---
It was a few months ago with fallout 1st.
---
Did you play Fallout 4?  The basebuilding there kept me on that game for almost 2 years after finishing the campaign.
---
Don't bother sending up a ticket. I did similar and got response back saying they cannot refund bullion.
---
Idk how difficult it would be to implement or anything, but I’d appreciate it if it could be done
---
is it modded? and what legendary effects you got on it?
---
A suggestion Bethesda judging from the feedback from the patch the ability to create interior walls is now almost completely gone can you please revert the fix. Can you add double sided walls for each material type which we can use with wallpaper this would one enable us to use less build budget on more creative camps and also appease a large part of the community that enjoy the building aspect of thegame.
---
Not per player I assume? Lol. 
---
I mean could probably generate 250-750 a day in steel scrap depending on how much I played, but that means it would take me like 3-5 years to get to a million, lol.
---
Interior wall paper is already in the atx and the wall glitch doesn’t compete with it, let’s say your building your camp and you decide that you want to divide your house up into rooms unfortunately there is no option for an interior wall that you could put wallpaper on both sides of so in order to keep from having half your walls the blue color of the contemporary walls you can use the wall glitch to cover up that blue color and put matching wall paper up in that one room. Now if they had added in interior walls at the same time I don’t think anyone would be complaining about this then
---
Stop this shit with a tent. What's wrong with your brain?
---
First thing I yoinked
---
There was a few mothman items. Mothman neon sign. A bed, wallpapers, backpack, jetpack, sleeping bag and I think something else but can't remember
---
If they made a double wall an atom shop purchase, I'd lose my shit
---
well even after todays update, its still a chore to use.. I would have hoped for a "trade in all" button of this ammo type, but nope.. it doesn't even show me how much I currently have of an ammo type so I need to guess between sell 1x, sell 10x or sell 100x
---
All factions have their victory or defeat decided by the protagonists, so that point can be made to literally every faction in the series.
---
The Western Brotherhood weren't obliterated. Lost Hills is still independent, Arthur Maxson even contacts the Western Elders at some point after his rise to power in order to legitimize his rule. One of the Mojave BoS endings even clearly state "*The Brotherhood and the NCR in the Mojave Wasteland declared an official truce, despite continued hostilities between the two in the west.*" The NCR-Brotherhood War was extremely costly for the NCR, entire Platoons were wiped out trying to take a single bunker, in a dialogue after the Courier blows the BoS Bunker, House says: "*Singlehandedly destroying a Brotherhood of Steel bunker is quite an accomplishment. Platoons of NCR troops have died, trying to do the same."* The NCR did not outright win, just achieved enough victories to now consider the BoS a minor threat and shift their focus to the Mojave, but this came at a massive cost. This was a textbook war of attrition, showing how a civilized state with massive numbers and optimized logistics will always trump what is basically a small army completely made of special forces, but it's safe to say that each Brotherhood soldiers was worth at least ten NCR.
---
Taking Operation: Sunburst as an example, the Mojave Brotherhood was outnumbered 15:1, as said by House himself: "*Or did, until the NCR showed them that ideological purity and shiny power armor don't count for much when you're outnumbered 15:1.*" The Lost Hills Brotherhood of Steel is no joke, and the New California Republic is no joke either. No other faction in the entire Wasteland can match the New California Republic in military might, they can fight conventional warfare in an age where no one else has the numbers or resources to do so. They have an Air Force, they have Mechanized divisions, they have spec ops, the NCR Army is the only Old World Army in the entire Wasteland. Well, except for the Legion.
---
The Legion are not "cosplayers with lawn mower blades," hehe le meme. Let's not ignore the fact the Legion is basically a massive state that holds almost all of the Four States Commonwealth and itself outnumbers the NCR by a large margin. Halon says this about the NCR "w*e lose over a thousand troopers every year*", in a world where most factions would completely vanish twice if taking these casualties, if the NCR Army can loose these numbers and still remain relatively stable while STILL being outnumbered by the Legion says something about just how MASSIVE the Legion's Army is. Yes, most of the foot soldiers of the Legion are extremely poor equipped, but they do make use of firearms, Recruit legionnaires, they lowest tier possible and most likely several times higher in numbers than the entire NCR Army by themselves can spawn with Varmint rifles, cowboy repeaters, shotguns, pistols and revolvers. Prime legionnaires and Centurions can spawn with things like Marksman carbines, Riot shotguns and Anti-material rifles. The Legion is a force to be reckoned with, the memes are funny but don't mistake them in the actual lore for cosplayers with blades.

That part wasn't what I was talking about my guy, but if anger is your priority then I understand.
---
That's disturbing.
---
Tell that to my homeserver I haven't touched in 2 years.
---
It's been noted and they are apparently working on a fix in a future patch.
---
out of 100+ times i have lost stuff twice. Nothing major just a lot of scrap legendaries and some worth around 10k and a poo load of ammo including 20k 5.56 
---
it's worth doing but don't transfer anything rare or expensive. use a fixed storage like a suitcase at a station
---
So I guess I'll be keeping most of my junk then
---
It's a shame how all the cool creative stuff is barely getting upvotes. Reddit is one angry place.
---
That's worse then the old way! How is that better? Even the previous version wouldn't show the ammo you didn't have. And now we have to hold back to exit? No explanation and to only do 1/10/100. No thanks. I'll pass and dump my ammo
---
Then I probably remember before using Scrapper haha
---
oh i must have missed them,:-( thanks for the info though :-)
---
For those commenting it was an 'easy fix' switching walls to doorways/windows has been in SINCE BETA...
---
IF they're going to sell double-sided walls that take up as much CAMP budget as a single wall, then I still see a market for it anyway. If you've got spare atoms to spend and it means you can have more walls to build, why not?
---
Well I assume bethesda wants to turn off this dumpsterfire of a game for good and now tries to alienate the last few people that have fun in this game.
---
you have 5 min until server resets after you leave.
---
people saying its "dangerous" just dont know what they are doing. ive swapped hundreds and hundreds of times, only lost something when my internet dropped.
---
Holy shit, looking through this list is there absolutely nothing new or unique to this event?
---
Yeah, turned in 250 steel, got floater grenades. Beth/10
---
I saw a guy who loaded 3 nukes into the mine. Same guy..
---
Yep, did Radiation Rumble earlier and as I approached the meat piles it was insanely sluggish. Never experienced this before til this patch.
---
That's too sleazy.
---
Its not really Fallout until it has a redundant dialog system
---
If it makes them feel better, the last server I was on *before* maintenance also had a Nuke on Monongah Mine...
---
"Patches" for this game are just regular instalments of disappointment. Never seen anything like it. To consistently piss off your player base time and time again with terrible decisions.. it is unreal.
---
Anyone who pays money for interior walls after Bethesda pulls this bullshit needs to be whacked upside the head with a super sledge. Seriously.
---
just the community rewards for passing the milestones. individual rewards are repeats.
---
1. Fallout 4 (settlement system)
---
2. Fallout NV (story)
---
3. Fallout 76 (diablo-like loot addiction)
---
4. Fallout 3 (great world design)
---
5. Fallout 1+2 (finally a new “wasteland” but i didnt like the timer)
---
It does work. 100x is not 100 grenades but 500. Each 1x is 5 grenades
---
Was that listed in the patch notes? Or a new bug?
---
They are on the Bethesda website, it’s basically a collection some cosmetics and more score opportunities
---
for real, they call it critical theory, it's fire bruh
---
Yeah unfortunately! The creature respawn bug so annoying. They did patch fixing a issues with the plasma goo some time ago, just don't remember what.
---
This is just sad... many features and bugfixes cannot be reliably verified inhouse, that's the nature of development. But checking if the vendor has the new plans available shouldn't be one of them. This should be easy addition (adding the items to some collection or list) and the verification should be also easy...
---
Are you sure you don't want to destroy it?
---
Itd be nice but i don't think they'd do it because no one would buy atoms then.
---
its intentional, listed as a bug fix
---
I turn mine off and change doors and windows to walls while I too go off to splurge caps, but I usually want to spend 20k+. Happens to me about once a day.
---
I'm sure they broke their shoelaces when they tried.
---
Legacy Camp!
---
I will quit playing otherwise
---
PERIOD!
---
Completely useless. Like I honestly don't even want to give any of my materials cause all I'm going to get loot wise is stuff I already have
---
&lt;merrily collecting junk for ATLAS and doing legendary Run&gt;, "What's all that yelling out there ? Oh, it's the CAMPers"
---
I used to move about and rebuild my camp all the time, one of the main things that kept me interested and buying atoms. That's all but out the window if they keep taking away the things that offer the slightest amount of creative freedom in a build.
---
I've got double sided walls on my diner and Sophie living in the play place spaceship inside of a room with stars and planets wallpaper and I don't dare touch anything now, God forbid move.
---
To be fair, things they claimed to have fixed aren't actually fixed, to keep the balance I guess.
---
The only thing that's reliably consistent about this company is how bad they are at fixing their own shit.
---
it is in the game. i have it from buying one month of 1st.
---
Just wasted about 1k steel. Those drops aren't worth it. Not sure if I'll be giving away anymore steel. Not sure if you get the full reward if the donation isn't fully completed by the community 😒
---
Considering certain wall types won't even place properly unless they're a door or window. That sucks.
---
Called an idiot nove, to make patchlog bigger
---
This is such crap, building is one of the main thing they promoted and pushed! Its a HUGE part of their atom shop, whats the point of spending money on items if I have no incentive to move my camp or try a new build now?! I've been playing this game since the BETA and have loved most of it but wth is wrong with the people making these decisions?!
---
You could place a solid wall then change it to a doorway or window. Doorways could be placed face to face then changed to walls to get wallpaper on both sides of an interior wall. A lot of build tricks centered on this ability.
---
They call It a Fix but It Isnt
---
Front page?
---
Did you happen to see the time limit before the remove them?
---
I am really confused about this whole thing.
---
Yeah I was super pumped I thought we would get a new event and exciting new BOS cosmetic items. We got none of that, I already struggle to find incentive to login daily.
---
The usual kind 🙄
---
A lot of my friends were excited for this
---
As others have said, this "fix" happened because of some sort of unrelated bug involving the walls. Why the changed it I do not know, understand, or want to agree with. 
---
Yes, it was a dumb fix, but as I said in my post I'm only trying to rationalize it not defend it. My comment on anger comes from the fact that you tried to prove me wrong for some reason.
---
Better believe I’m never moving my bunker camp or monorail camp! 🤣
---
One of the many reasons why I choose not to renew my 1st sub
---
HAHAHA I was thinking this EXACT thing! A home from before the wall bombs dropped!
---
I lost stuff 3 times, once was my own fault though because i hit adventure mode by mistake but i do it all the time. Anything great or valueable im on edge. Just make sure all your characters are in the same location so you wont have to fast travel. I use Sutton station as the locker inside can hold alot. 
---
Always put something worthless in first to make sure it gets placed, never do it when anything new releases or theres new events happening as i think this can cause you to get "disconnected" from the server when you exit the world due tomore traffic, that can cause you to lose the World. Ultimately though you have to be ok with losing whatever item you are transferring and if you arent dont do it.
---
It's the only NW challenge I don't do.
---
Easier and faster to gain 30,000 exp in Adventure.
---
Actually, yes it is.
---
No, I see it more like half of their team being on vacation and the higherups pushing the patch no matter what. At this point no patch would be nearly as good as patch 21. We are in the middle of Legendary run, we can keep ourselved entertained. They could have postponed it to the end of the Season...
---
if we make enough noise im sure we can get them to realize how stupid this was and turn it around. it doesnt affect the gameplay in a positive or negative way for other players, it doesnt allow any dupe exploits or anything like that. it literally just lets you make your camp look nice and really make it your own.
---
I've noticed with my Gatling Plasmas and Gatling Lasers, my core will sometimes suddenly drain to 0. Sometimes it'll stop firing part way through a core and auto load another partially charged core.
---
You need to give people an incentive to give away their steel. Steel and lead are the most important mats to have in the game due to ammo crafting. 
---
Why on earth would they spam reward people with grenades and uncle billys or whatever the fuck moonshine lol. 
---
I donated 5k. Done my bit. But i have to say that i am getting really tired of this game. I'm lvl 486, 400 + ingame hours and i'm just getting kinda tired of how detached the devs are from the community. 
---
I wish i could by a fly on the wall at bethesda just to see what the fuck is going on there lol.
---
Atlas observatory
---
Wait for the free BOS one at the end of the month!
---
If you buy the SS underarmor plans from the Vault and make them you can mod them...but you cannot mod the SS Camo Atomic Shop underarmor.  I ran into the same issue today.
---
How do you know they picked it? Door left open? I jump into people private areas all the time before the camp loads fully.
---
I hate the BOS content anyways. Will do! Why buy stuff in the Atomic Shop when I don't even want to build...
---
yeah. why wouldn't it?
---
Haha I finished building my camp walls minutes before the patch. I'm still pretty annoyed though.
---
Not to be mean but Bethesda doesn’t care about what you or anyone else thinks, they don’t even fix the 100 bugs this game still has. Some of which has been around for 8 months. There gonna keep messing things up for people until the game is completely dead. I do t think they want people to play, what else would the reason be?
---
I am bummed about this. I was looking forward to this too.
---
yeah. cant understand why they just did not do that...
---
Strongly depends on a lot of factors. I'm personally okay with getting kills, but if you get surrounded at the start of a match by players who were able to load and loot before you, you're toast. And depending on your platform of choice, certain consistent players are just better than most. Not to mention the freeze-ups and stutters than regularly happen (on Xbox, anyway).
---
I'm actually okay with NW challenges overall; I just think they should be more focused on things all players can feasibly do over time, like survival, looting, and taking out creatures (which may be somewhat based on luck, but is nowhere near as challenging as taking out a player). On the other hand, asking players to perform PvP actions in a PvP mode just makes sense, so... I'm of two minds on it.
---
100% waste of time
---
Yea I even blue screened once and my stuff was still there when I relogged.
---
Yeah, it's still not quite there, but at least can drop hundreds of rounds in it. So, if this is best idea they could do as a fix, it speaks enough for itself...
---
Its showing me every ammo type and quantity available, at all times. Even if I dont hold a single round of that type on me. In the past, I had to spam click, which meant I accidentally sold the wrong type. So at least I dont sell the wrong types now I guess?  
---
But the fact that when I used this machine, I was coming home with like 9 missiles or 150-300 rounds of lower caliber rounds. These changes dont even benefit me in the long run. I never have enough when I use the machine to turn in 10 sets.  
---
I dont understand why they couldnt change the "Spin" feature to be a vendor or temporary box. You put your ammo in and the slider instead of being 1 per tick is the amount you have to give in each set. Or make it like power armor. You can store it in there, use machine to convert, then whatever cant be exchanged stays behind. If you leave it in the box too long then it returns to your inventory. There were SO MANY ways they could make this better. And I understand that for users who have been hoarding ammo, the x10 and x100 options help. But this only made the process worse for people with lower quantities.
---
True. Just wish they added challenges which were “completable” within a certain timeframe on NW. Surviving 10 minutes is easy for example; this one is just a pain.
---
That would suck. Stuff like radaway is okay, if you can't use it you can at least get a couple of caps and booze is always nice, especially with the booze drinking challenges but those are just garbage and shouldn't be in there. They keep trying to push them on us but I've never seen anyone actually use them.
---
I watched one, a level 27 and the other was loitering at my camp for a good while. I never leave my doors open and I also know because I had to re-lock it both times
---
I though he meant it  like it gets the first shot to hit there target rather then miss every time. Wishful thinking on my part.
---
Good on you.  I think the scale is slightly different, especially with the update
---
Same lol.
---
Bethesda never does anything right. They patch the stuff people like, don't add in the feature, and leave the game breaking bugs. Ffs Bethesda you already have zero community love stop doing dumb shit.
---
HEY REPLY TO THE BULLSHIT WALL CHANGE THREADS, THERE ARE 6 OF EM ON THE FRONT PAGE!!!!
---
that seems a bit extreme especially as mine is "fine" and this is the first post i've seen about it. 
---
And you've not had any problems before?
---
Int mods scrap amount
---
Intelligence then? Thanks! I’ll get it on my next level up.
---
God forbid they fix vats....
---
Its not perfect, but at least its useable now. I just converted all my unwanted ammo and now have 80k ammo points stored in the ammo converter.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but how do you go about transferring using a private world?
---
Yeah I use the basic trick to run a wire thru a door frame, change it to solid. No unnecessary conduits. Really stupid thing to change.
---
Its actually nice because you notice when it triggers and doesn't, so it serves almost as an in-game alarm clock. 
---
Also, noticing when it does and doesn't work tells you retroactively whether it's worth it. You will know precisely how often you are shooting things at night! 
---
Now, if you are already one shotting everything in the game, a bit more damage is just for your personal satisfaction.
---
Very, i do it almost every day
---
Wow, what a disappointing update.
---
I have no mutations, no med effects and I'm dying of thirst so fast I can watch it happen while my friend stands right next to me with no issues... difference is I'm a pre-wastelanders player... This is a bug?
---
REPLY TO THE WALL CHANGE THREADS!  WE HAVE 6 ON THE MAIN PAGE!
---
Hey can someone even tell me where the provions are? I can't find them in my inventory at all :s
---
WEEOOO WEEOOO HERE COME THE FUN POLICE
---
But if noone has an individual reason to donate who donates?
---
I imagine it's a discord and a dev server these days, less a building eh?
---
However, you can build several of them in your camp at once.
---
Is it still able to be modded? 
---
Can you still wear under armor?
---
REPLY TO THE WALL CHANGE THREADS!
---
Have it as the log cabin themed BOS vendor inside of whitesprings on the left in the mall area
---
Isn't this a bit too much dramatic? "Almost the entire building community"? I'd guess that majority of people building their camps don't know about these "tricks". For me the only one I knew about was the trick to make "internal doorway" where wallpapers can be applied from both sides. Sure, you can find the info online, but most people probably don't go searching for that info.
---
Sure, it sucks and should be reverted or some other workaround should be put in place, but you seem to overestimate the impact on this change.
---
Guess I cancelled my 1st subscription just in time
---
I use my candy bucket that I got at halloween because it is bright orange and easy to see, so people notice when I drop things for them. I use the Paratrooper bag for my death because I will have a quest marker for it, but for everyone else it is hard to see.
---
It's a bad move, one more in a long list of bad moves with this game. I love building CAMPS, it is pretty much the only real endgame I have besides the SCORE and if they ruin (once again) the building part, I'll probably move on to other games since the SCORE chase is not that rewarding by itself. I'm more angry than annoyed, there are so many bugs that need fixes and they don't pay attention to them... and they make much more difficult to be creative with a fix nobody asked for. I feel a little bit insulted by Bethesda, to be sincere... It's like they are trying hard to annoy this community.
---
Ahhhh did not know they put those up there. Thanks.
---
I need to literally take a picture on my phone of my ammo tab so I don't have to leave the ammo coverter to check how much Ammo I have of each type.
---
Yup just reread it. I'm sorry. I'm an idiot 😂😂
---
why make one of your own when you can BUY a bunker prefab! only 1500 atoms! (jokes aside thats a real thing. its coming soon.)
---
Do you need legendary modules or vault steel?
---
It has been confirmed that you can flamethrower two full brick walls as well as brick windows!
---
God damn it
---
yes, this is the way
---
Some people access Reddit through a desktop apparently and don't know that the rest of Reddit have no idea what a front page is xd
---
I don't recall any time limit. It's probably this month's F1st thing, which means they'll remain there until the first Atom Shop update of September.
---
Bethesda just needs to get rid of these limitations all together. Player will have glitchy floating homes regardless. The difference would be that players who spend a lot of time building will have more freedom.
---
They don’t count as under armor anymore. Now they are regular outfits. That go OVER your under armor and armor pieces.
---
Spawn in at Morgantown highschool.  AfK players behind it almost every time.
---
the building community is wild lmao - but I hope Beth actually listens. I love vendor hopping and seeing awesome and unique builds. much luck!
---
It is, indeed. I hope people give them hell at Quakecon with this.
---
I only check into the forum occasionally to see when I should come back. I'm a huge home builder. What happened?
---
All the rewards are generic poo poo doo doo.
---
I hope there’s a camp exploit I can use to build 10000 gorillas  since I can build the camps I normally do
---
Why fix something that didn't need fixing?  It wasn't causing any issues.... I don't and never will understand Bethesda! Fix all the problems instead of fixing users creativity!
---
They're in aid and they suck, they weigh one and the stuff you get isn't worth the effort
---
Finally some floater grenades!
---
The boxes, but that's what held the worth. Most plans are useless as is
---
"There's a green one, and a red one..."
---
Just watching this sub light up the day of an update never ceases to amaze me.
---
Yes, I was just thinking this Daka. The bulldoze has been sitting extra broken for a while. Multiple areas in my CAMP the bush should be clearly able to be cleared an it won't. An randomly spots of grass pop up sometimes.
---
Yeaup... that's what I do...  Why they just can't list your ammo count right next to the line item you are converting is beyond me.  Garbage design.
---
Thing is I'm a fucking whale I bought literally ever camp item that comes out but I'm fucking throughly annoyed by this bullshit. Fallout 1st made the repairing of camps a joke so this is completely unnecessary.
---
It's tempting for me because I need some of the plans to craft power armor pieces
---
Don’t really have a need for either at the moment. Not really deep into actually trying to maximize my build or anything. Just getting a good melee weapon that works for me, and until Secret Service armor can actually have Deep Pockets and other stuff I’m not very interested in it
---
Yeah that ain't happening lol.
---
Good luck with that. 
---
Anyway did they get rid of two sided walls?
---
Now there is an item that belongs in this game,
---
Where are all the 1950s and 60s pinup mags?
---
OK, you have it in your head it's a grind. I disagree. Nothing we can say to each other will change the other sides mind, so, I'm out.
---
I was going to build a mansion in the next few weeks. Guess that's not happening anymore.
---
Mine must of bugged out, I only have stimpack and radaway there, I've donated 1k steel too :/
---
2 hours and 671 up votes and 181 comments later, think it’s a pretty significant change for builders. 😬
---
Seems fine to me
---
Entirely agree. I just don't want the option gone forever.
---
They've just royally fucked us over. I love building camps. Spent the last week building the best camp I could make. Now if I want to rebuild. I can't. they're definitely losing some players over this.
---
 a few posts up from this is talking about cancelling fallout 1st and trying to get others too.  Hopefully the backlash they're getting will be the incentive to add double wallpaper walls. Free for everyone. Just stupid
---
They should but im sure it'll be all praise and "look at the exciting new things" we will delay and release broken.
---
It would have been nice to see some sort of new BOS plans make it onto the list. I turned in 500, and depending on how the numbers look, assuming there is some sort of active tracking, I probably won't do much more than what already happens to be in my stashbox towards this challenge.
---
Thank you, you just saved my thumb! 
---
That machine is the least user friendly I’ve ever encountered.
---
ive spent ungodly amounts of money (and time) on camps. its my favorite thing to do in the game. ive built at least 50 different ones by now. this fucking hurts, man.
---
Got 100k i collected since beta, with those rewards im not giving even 1 steel 😅
---
I'm afraid you are right :(
---
Ok, its still not something they intended for us to be able to do. Im not saying this is a good idea or that we needed it. Im just speculating as to why they would do this.
---
If they went up to your door and crouched. It doesn’t necessarily mean they picked your lock. They probably did what I do, and use the photomode glitch to get in. I do it whenever I see people that cheated and have the ammo converters in their camp so I steal all their ammo.
---
Masterpiece!
---
Yep noticed it too
---
Brotherhood recon rifle? Huh
---
Actually that's the same for me
---
Better off Getting treasure maps
---
How long has this been goin on? I play with a consistent group of xbox players and noones discussed this thing, we just beej slaughters the sbq
---
There’s no fucking reason to fix bugs like this, it’s just limiting our creativity. There are no possible in game benefits from having double sided wallpaper 😒
---
Lol yeah me either. Phone is easier for me.
---
It’s the same for me.
---
It also works with any terminals you find :)
---
It is indeed
---
Is there anywhere you can see where we are on the community goals?
---
I did over 100 this week. Only got mod plans, not a single armor piece.
---
&gt;FFS, why did this have to be "fixed" as opposed to the huge list of actual bugs that actually affect people's gameplay that have been a problem for months.
---
Probably because the guy who is experienced mostly in working with the camp/settlement code had to do something. Not every developer can work on every type of issue. Sure, you could try to assign that guy to the fast travel issue, but he'd spend eternity getting familiar with the code and the still break it more than fix it.
---
"Why do you work on A when you should work on B" is a stupid question to ask, because it ignores the nature of developer work. It's like when fixing a broken house. The plumber will still work on barely dented plumbing instead of trying to fix a missing roof, even though the missing roof is like 1000x more severe issue.
---
I agree with everything. I don't have 1st but If I were to have it, I'll consider unsuscribing too. Not cool, Bethesda.
---
Yeah, I bit the bullet and bought a month of 1st, planning to load up the scrap box as much add I could and donate to this event.  Guess I'll just be doing the former.
---
Too bad its got weight, you could stock up for the future otherwise.
---
No, because trade between different platforms is impossible
---
Welcome to the club!!!. I had a pre-fab camp with my own doors that clicked into the pre-existing doorways, but they kicked me out of there. Still have my legacy string light in the display case.
---
I didn’t see this in the patch notes? Where is it, am I missing something?
---
As found out by another member of the community, you can do double sided *brick* walls - full walls and windows with the flamethrower trick. However, no work around for switching between full walls/windows/doorways has been found.
---
Cheers
---
You gotta do both imo
---
Just like before modern water purification, booze was what everyone drank because it was sterile.
---
Some germs can't be boiled out of water, so people learned to drink liquor or beer.
---
Look up the bill for the signing convention of the Declaration, they drank more in 3 days than most people drink in a lifetime
---
Not just about the double walls though... a lot of builders relied on the ability to change wall types in place for a lot of tricks while building. This is a crippling change.
---
It has never really worked at the first place
---
It was likely this exactly. Add one change to the log to give it that much more fluff. Or a dev was anal and saw a few players do it and didn't like it so they 'fixed' it.
---
Pash ish over, grahndad.
---
And Bethesda USED to take the approach that some bugs, if they don't negatively impact the game, can be part of the fun. Like getting smacked clear the fuck out off the world in Skyrim.
---
What
---
Context please
---
Same :( I just scrapped mine last night in preparation for a new build once the atom shop got updated. This makes me so mad :(
---
**what**
---
Sometimes I really wonder why they do this to us. Todd is laughing at us even more so now.
---
 If Bethesda actually played their game they'd understand the stupidity of this.
---
&gt;why they would care enough to fix this when there are actual issues
---
Because not every person is qualified/skilled to fix every type of bug. The camp building developer probably had to do something, instead of breaking things he isn't experienced with...
---
*Does* it actually?
---
It's sad I think.
---
Same for Xbox with the B button.
---
I think you could hit replace and change in spot with a different one.  But I guess now you can't I haven't tried
---
Just started today but after posting this I got a look at the loot table and it stinks. I thought I had bad luck but no. Best thing is PA mods and prime weapon mods, all of which most people have from Christmas presents or mole miner pales
---
You serious? There's like a hundred other posts about this already.
---

---
Double sided walls are no more ..
---
Thanks.
---
No, then you could just afk it
---
No disrespect intended. But how do you accidentally buy it again? The plan would say “KNOWN“ if you already owned it. That should’ve been easy to see. I usually scroll slowly and carefully when I buy stuff. 
---
Sucks that it happened to you. Wouldn’t bother sending a ticket to Bethesda because they have stated before that they can’t refund your gold. All I can say is, keep the plan handy IN CASE one day we can trade/sell plans for gold to other players. I doubt it, but it’s better than just dropping it.
---
You forgot one with the flamer and how its condition didn't improve with the heavy weapons condition buff a while back and is still minuscule and breaks after like 2 reloads
---
literally every other armour has light/ultralight mods. if people want other specs go nuts, they're already available for them to do so. I can't play the way i like because bethesda just plain forgot and i shouldn't have to compensate my perk allocations because of it
---
don't worry BoS will just have us gather 200 million canvas to make up for it.
---
And unlike the Brahmin it can’t be killed by other players if they come to your base
---
They chose to fix something that wasn't broken while ignoring  a long list of things that are. IMO, they chose to do so in order to force people toward pre-fab buildings they can sell in the atom shop. 
---
If they would make interior walls and sell them in the atom shop I would buy them, even if I had to buy a version for each build type.
---
Fun suckers!
---
With all the cookie cutter prefabs showing up in the Atom Shop, this seems like a cynical attempt to force people to buy them.
---
Looks like their counter doesn't work either.

Bethesda: Honk! Honk! 🤡
---
Phew, just edited my camp under the wire, it seems. I was messing around with making a player-drop-trade area that broke some of the nice seamlessness I had going, and it’s good to know that if I try and scrap and polish further right now that the normal methods will no longer work. I know this was more an angry letter to the devs, but I thank the OP for the PSA!
---
Or at the least they should make it so we can drop and sell the damn things. Same with all the gold items.
---
It stays up around 5 minutes, so it's quite easy. Find a container without item limit, like lockers or ice machines in some train stations, stash anything you want to transfer, reenter with your other character and everything is there for taking. 
---
You only must reenter with other character in private world, if you enter in public, you may be placed in different private world after and loose everything.
---
In addition to what Bignholy wrote, there were other applications. For example: Step 1: attach a wall to a floor. Step 2: change wall to a door. Step 3: delete floor. Step 4: change door to wall. 
---
Now you can attach other walls and ceilings to your floating wall.
---
I used this method to create an outside pen for my brahmin to hangout in. Edna has four half walls and a roof with no floor.
---
Here's a great [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/2AyA3qa8X24?t=515) that I used as a basis. *edit, I can see the place I marked on the video isn't a great visualization. I do recommend the whole video. He uses the door / wall trick a lot.
---
This has me super bummed.
---
Maybe the zenimax board of directors have some say in the artistic direction of the game
---
I’ve been gone for 2 days and they destroyed camp building
---
What can I say except what did we expect? Now I can’t build cool shit anymore. I guess I have a legacy camp now.
---
The free item is really cool, but WHY are the junkyard fences, which are recycled assets from FO4 bundle exclusive?
---
That’s a shame. Can’t believe they’d do this!
---
Wow!  Not a damn thing I need or want!  LMAO!
---
Why are you still complaining about this game? It was pure shite when it first came out. Bethesda didn't gaf then and they don't now. Stop acting surprised.
---
No.
---
That's my point, it's a weird bug for sure. There must have been some kind of loophole that caused it but I got no idea
---
Bethesda QA happened.
---
Nobody in their right mind would have their computer running 24/7 for nearly a year, logged into FO76 the whole time, just for some in-game cosmetic currency
---
The Brotherhood can get their own crap, I don't work for pennies.
---
and I lost my shielded lining :(
---
That's it though! Testing us, finding out how long we all last. I've got faith in them. I love this game but they need to get things right at least once in a while .
---
it wasnt broken. Glitch building is an essential feature in any building game
---
Its best if they see you do it. They'll shoot at you to try and get XP. I just imagine them screaming about another bush wookie making it as far as they did.
---
Anyone who would willing to waste one year on afking this, deserves 7600 atom.
---
"Hmm Colossal Problem has been delayed YET again, oh well at least I have this BoS event to tide me over." Nope. Yet another hard fail by the tone-deaf devs. 
---
Just lost another subscriber. Guess I'll have a bit of extra spending money every month now yay.
---
Black Prospector's hat and long Scavenger coat.
---
Wait that's the complete list? Seriously? Wow what a bunch of garbage.
---
I'd like to speak to you about our Lord and savior, Mothman...
---
Its just 1 point too
---
Like most events it takes to long for the reward/effort put into it.  The tent gimmick speeds it up and at least makes it good for steel and XP farming.
---
oh wow, so now they think double wall is an exploit too??
---
Possibly one of the most stupid things they can do to the builders in fallout. Royally fucked.
---
To answer who needs to be that drunk...me. my character in every fallout is a terrible alcoholic because i forget that you can get addicted and i dont like finding addictol or spending caps to get treatment (I'm a massive cheapskate). As for those grenades just use them as clay pigeons.
---
Don some flair and prove it, sonny!
---
Check the loot table for ATLAS, if you did any of the other events (mole miner/presents) you probably have all the plans
---
Excellent! Thank you.
---
Same, not moving until they fix this. I mean FFS, I made settlement mods for FO4, I could add real interior walls with double sided wallpaper in a day. It's laughably easy.
---
These really are the most useless devs.
---
I don't understand I have one but never paid atoms for it
---
How sir?!
---
This is fucking absurd. Why on earth are they choosing to spend time making that change?  I personally felt like camp building was in a really good place.
---
Booo booo you suck!!!!(not you. Your rewards that suck) 
---
I’m feeling less incentivized to donate now
---
Heavy Raider Armor plans? Hell yeah!
---
People don't understand that most of the work in fixing bugs is making sure you don't break anything else in the process, like what happened when they fixed the 250dr legendary effect and ended up breaking every other legendary effect as a result, or that sometimes fixing one problem really does require "breaking" something else.
---
If there's enough of a fuss about this it's possible they'll revert it in the next patch, but that also means un-fixing the problem they fixed.
---
You do realize it’s not even supposed to be achievable? It’s literally meant for a playtime counter. Anyone who actually reaches it legit expecting a reward should take it as a wake up call to go do something with their life. Anyone wanting to afk it should just get the tiny amount of 80 atoms it was before
---
Pretty sure they'll just give us the rewards anyways. Already planned it all out so I don't expect them to scrap all the rewards they've went and prepared.
---
Holy shit thank god.
---
Nvm I enlisted
---
So I can't access my hidden switches to cut power from my vendors unless I destroy the wall, rebuild it from the inside and fast travel out... fucking stupid!
---
It's not that. You cant switch windows or doors to regular walls, making a lot of people unable to wire their CAMPs anymore
---
You my friend are a saint.
---
thank you ill be there in a moment
---
Go to Graham head carter
---
Just lol...
---
Todd: "A floating wall killed my mother"
---
I don’t know if it’s still the case, but is the new studio the one still developing the game? The one Bethesda “recently” acquired for making some online title. If so, that’s the main root of the problem there. Inexperience. Actual inexperience.
---
I just like to keep CAMPs simple and creative, craziest thing I do is brickwalls to use wallpaper on both sides and rug moving.
---
Wasn't there a camp budget glitch that involved changing wall types? If you changed the wall type instead of scrapping and replacing the camp budget would charge you twice for the same wall? 
---
Is this an attempt at fixing that glitch that went wrong?
---
What I love best is that it allows hoarders to turn in a bunch and then...well then they aren't hording ammo and don't need that feature anymore.
---
Yeah it was always part of the charm when it was something fun and not game breaking
---
Well, I'm on the brink with this last one. Why would I spend money on atoms for AS camp items if I can't enjoy building anymore?   
---
When they launched the first new set of walls, there were months that every CAMP looks were basically the same, I'm afraid we are getting back to that. I have to make a new CAMP for my 2nd toon soon, and I'll just use the Red Rocket Garage prefab and forget getting cretive, I guess...
---
What do people usually want for them?
---
No T-60? Plans, Interesting since it’s kinda the default brotherhood armor

---
I definitely do.
---
Ive heard of people working around it using flamethrowers, but you can no longer switch doors to flat walls or windows and vice versa, so the regular method of creating interior walls is gone.
---
I might be mistaken but I think some of the rewards were simply to extend certain events, so it probably wouldn't take much to do or not do that considering that's what they did for the Fascnacht event amid delays.
---
What I am reading here is "U/The\_Nekrodahmus, don't change anything out on your base because you will need to rebuild it a 6th time if things weren't already frustrating enough for you."  
---
Great....
---
No problems until tonight, I just wasn’t hitting anything at close range either. 
---
Ghouls stood at very close range and nearly every shot was missing. 
---
I’ve just decided to drop a load of my gauss shotguns on the ground and craft something else to use.
---
Yeah the camp device goes on the ground, I'm strictly talking buildings. I also want to say that i don't care what people build or if they build elevated camps, nor do I think Bethesda should care. 
---
All I'll say about the "in the sky" part is that I've seen camps that were at the top of power line towers with no stairs leading up. I've also seen camps that were near to the top of the towers but completely floating next to them.
---
Floating camps aren't the only thing they've taken offense to though. Underground and foundation wall castles have also been targets in their crusade against creative building.
---
*it was the only thing that made us have any fun building.*
---
Oh quit overreacting. I want them to change it back too, but saying double walls are the only things that make building fun is a huge fucking overstatement.
---
That's funny ! As a stims build I can do pretty well myself. Also I have an item that resurrects me with a coin toss (50/50 chance) . So it gets even funnier when that procs after dying a horrible death then I just stand up lol
---
They're more like the friend that keeps agreeing to eat at a restaurant, only to then postpone it every time on the last second when you're already sitting at the table waiting for them without giving an exact reason.
---
I personally believe they will give us the rewards regardless so it makes it seem the community is bigger than it actually is and that we actually donate as much as they hope for.
---
Yeah it happened to me I just logged on after updating and now my entire weekly and daily challenges are complete. I thought this update was supposed to fix this?!!!!
---
Oh right, yeah I suppose they don't look like say the red warehouse set or the concrete set.
---
But I'm predicting more of these free standing structures to be added to the atom store over time, similar to how were getting lots more prefabs.
---
My A button is messed up and sometimes it does the action twice. I hadn’t learned the plan when I accidentally pressed A and the rest is history
---
Fucking truth
---
Thanks :) happy to help
---
One day after Bethesda did a camp showcase talking about how they loved the creativity of the community they patched it. What a joke.
---
Yeah :S 1 step forward and 3 back...
---
Yeah some, but we've got brotherhood clothing and camp items. Wouldn't expect Bethesda to scrap them
---
I think 500 or so is going for like 30k. Even that is overpaying at this point though.
---
I basically stay subbed here because it reminds me not to play the game at this point. Every few months I have an rpg itch that needs to be scratched and there’s always some new controversy with 76 to keep me away...
---
lemme repeat it for those in the back....
---
***Shooting friendlies with a flamer does not trigger the friendly fire perk. However, bashing with a flamer seems to work fine. Rather embarrassing considering it’s the weapon featured on the perk card.***
---
I gave 10k for the cause
---
Yeah better he a free item or something that just gets added to the section for walls in the build menu without making it something you have to claim
---
For real. And it's stupid I have to like rush to set up my cards before the match starts.
---
I believe enemies can't drop Plan Weapons but only as rewards from completing events.
---
Ah. That complete blows.  Sorry to hear that.
---
Must be a different one I'm thinking of, then. I thought it was refined, but I know for sure it's not hasty.
---
What happened to the exclusive gear?? Guess Bethesda once again tried to trick us.
---
thanks!
---
What will he collect
---
is this a troll post? 
---
Why would you drop them? And how many do you have? I have my main and backup. And with scattershot they weight like 2lbs max
---
I'm definitely curious what would happen if we just didn't do it
---
Dude. I’m still trying to get heavy raider legs. And I have been working a long-ass time. Getting a character to 45 or whatever to unlock heavy drops before doing signal strength freaking blew chunks. I’m excited as hell for these chances. :/
---
It doesn't update in real time. It will probably be once a day.
---
They need to just give us inner walls that can be wallpapered on both sides and be done with it.
---
You get caps back with each one opened though.
---
The Santatron was free last christmas
---
Interesting...
---
don’t remember how they worded it, but it’s definitely not possible anymore
---
it is not updated in real time, last event we had it was updated once daily
---
then i dont know, got mine yesterday and this thing is more of a sniper rifle than a shotgun for me
---
Yeah they really messed up everything this update. The wall “fix” ammo converter, terrible fortifying atlas awards, you name it
---
Much faster to get rid of them by chucking them into the sky like fireworks. No sense in accumulating them and waiting to drop them all at once.  More effort than its worth. I toss them as soon as I get them.
---
I'm not understanding it either. I don't know where to deliver the steel either.
---
You tell ‘em, Steve-Dave!
---
Nice!
---
And yet they've had enough steel to make these, haha :D
---
What do you mean? It worked great for me. If anything it seemed op how well it worked. Is there something specific I'm missing here?
---
Loool
---
I hate to complain but this game fails me and everyone who plays it, daily. We should get SCORE points for just playing because the game itself is the worst daily challenge. Disappearing items. Building bugs. Crashes. Getting stuck in staircases. Spawning in walls. Abysmal system designs (legendary weapon/scrip for instance).
---
Bethesda needs to really spend an upcoming update to work out bug fixes and design flaws. As it is, they release so many things that don't seem to have been tested at all. Fix all the broken crap you already released before you put out fresh broken crap. 
---
I have always loved Fallout but sometimes 76 is difficult for me to enjoy. Eventually, I will definitely stop playing this game if things don't change.
---
I think so yeah there's ain't no way only xbox or only PC gonna get that amount
---
I’ve done it hundreds of times. Never lost anything.
---
Taking out the mole miner pail plans was like kicking a meth head in the teeth: cruel, unusual and ultimately pointless.
---
Seems less likely it’d be an atomic shop item, since most of that stuff is existing elements retextured to look a certain way. A double wall would be an entirely new mechanic.
---
I subscribe to a month here and there, but with this months reward being that shitty reject twin bed from Valentine’s Day, I might never subscribe again. Would’ve preferred nothing over this slap in the face.
---
Bar is already completed. Just numbers
---
The most watched camp trick video has 206k views then 10+ other ones with 100k - 200k views - then probably over 500 videos with tips and tricks with 5k -99k views. and then at least 3 youtubers have their camp of the week videos that always get around 5k views. we are the building community
---
[Please](https://media3.giphy.com/media/X7IoVUJXtO3wk/giphy.gif)
---
Share comrade, for the brotherhood, you must.
---
 Yea, why the fuck did they have to go and ruin one of the only good bugs? This means circular buildings are pretty much out too. My base is circular and if it ever happens to have to move or can’t be placed then I’m screwed. I really hope I can hold on to this “legacy base” for a long time. If I have to rebuild the whole base without the door-to-wall swap, I may just go play something else for awhile.
---
Yes, you can change the settings in the Atomic Shop and they will be applied in game.
---
Very
---
Yeah I agree with you, he could be a major contributor of the mass amount of steel
---
They're all gonna be squares.
---
Ironically im on the toilet when I read the headline.
---
It has been this way since fallout 3
---
I know :(
---
Right, but the question is whether it’s intentional. I’ll have to reread through patch notes but I don’t remember seeing this at all
---
I bought the game at launch but bounced away not long after because I foresaw the inevitable end game problem and decided to come back to the game at a later date so I wasn't around to get when the present and phial events were active so at least for my case I will be donating stuff in an attempt to get the Raider Armor plans that I'm missing.
---
Guess we need Bethesda to start releasing Cliff Notes versions for those who are slow and don't understand their updates.
---
Idk about the 1st half but i certainly hate how every developer has been trying modle themselves after fortinite.
---
When is the fast travel bug gonna be fixed?
---
Meh I'll donate the scrap I find on my usual playthroughs. And what incentives did we get from killing scorched last year besides the community rewards.
---
I can't upvote you enough. I don't care that we can convert x10 or x100 more rounds. If I'm converting the rounds in the first place I don't want them so let me get rid of all of them at once. Same goes for buying.
---
I also don't understand why they had to run this through a terminal interface instead of those pop-ups you can get during certain world events. For example the [undetonated ordnance](https://external-preview.redd.it/tceT_r6qupiSn3Wr4ISH7gF4ZC35ZrCu4bsJiRKXoJQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=664cc5a55412db6d84477cabd39f33a808bf0b5b) random encounter.
---
Not what I was trying to do my guy. Technically you did figure it out. It's not like this was in any instruction booklet or anything. I found it out by accident playing Fallout 4 myself.
---
Please include an exit button on the same page as the ammo selection page. I was stuck in a "Back" loop for so long that I had to sit down and restart the game. Or... Just give is back the old POS converter. Or.... Let me see the ammo for caps at a vendor.
---
This happened the repeatedly before the patch dropped. Haven't been home from work tonight to test out, but will do when I'm off.
---
username macguy9, platform Bethesda.net
---
Love them yea, always wanted to play a supermacist huehuehue.
---
Sounds like the BOS just found a ton of these plans in a suitcase at whitesprings, little did they know so did everyone else.
---
The gauss shotgun and minigun are big disappointments.
---
They dont seem to snap to walls now, they just go green when near them and can be placed floating. Sucks if you want them on the wall but useful for micro adjustments
---
Yaaaaaayyyy the mole miner gauntlet, no new plans at all dont need a cool BOS styled base no nobody wants that
---
Oh no joke? Can you program them for specifics? Like specific ammo, chems, and junk all at the same time?
---
I was able to get them as soon as the update finished.... maybe try a different server or restarting?
---
If you have the skin for you CAMP device from the LR, take it off. It is broken, and removes it from the map.
---
I applaud your restraint, sir.
---
Sixteen Times The Details
---
Their priorities, amirite? And here I am waiting to hear this game is worth playing again without getting screwed out of rewards and score, but they go and fix something benign that's not bothering anyone. Every update saps my motivation to want to play more and more.
---
Did you increase the fucking reward for doing those ridiculous fucking silos? If not they need a revamp. Just let us launch nuke after nuke if you aren't going to create endgame content. Fucking 2 hour cool down is bullshit I should be able to move to a new server, and immediately be able to launch a nuke from a silo if it's not in rebuild. Add fucking interior walls so we can create homes not one room fucking sheds, and interior stair sets. Your team has failed miserably at making this a game people even want to play, let alone making it one people will be willing to come back to. Your team is terrible at communication, and you have the nerve to tell the community that you're listening; but, clearly only half assed as I would expect any fucking millennial to do. I love Fallout; however, I'm really starting to hate/loathe/detest/abhor Bethesda/Zenimax as companies.
---
it just doesnt make sense to waste time fixing glitches that people liked and or didnt really care about when the game is pretty much an unplayable mess. i may not be able to shoot my full magazine before having to auto reload, cant see the gamertag of anyone on any server, can't use a bunch of perk cards, but at least they took the time so that i cant have double sided walls....
---
Nothing. They're gonna give it to us, they're gonna make fake milestones per day i bet, saying on the 1st hour we all donated like 500,000 steel and tomorrow say we donated like 3.75 million steel in 12 hours or something. 150mil is impossible in just 4 days.
---
I thought the same, I saw the check marks.  Did you look at completion counts, like x/50 creatures, etc.  it didn’t autocomplete though.
---
Sadly, it is a once a day type of update. Though the skeptic in me worries that not all donations will be counted correctly
---
They're probably gonna sell double sided walls in the atom shop soon.
---
Only community reward I have any interest in is the collectron. And I honestly don't think it is possible to fail the community aspect.
---
What did they "fix"?
---
Am I the only one not seeing these plans at Vault 79?
---
***Secret Service Armor:*** *Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79.*
---
No. Like the cosmetic is ace but he  actually collects commie things.
---
Bud, you sort of proved his point, right there.
---
Only way to win that game was to not play.
---
1. Do Uranium Fever
---
2. Pick up all of the everything.  **All** of it!
---
3. After the event, clear out the other Mole Miners in the side passage on the right heading toward the exit
---
4. Limp your 1000lb over-encumbered self to Whitespring Station.
---
5. Exit Power Armor if applicable, equip Hard Bargain.  Unyeilding gear maxes stamina, pop a grape mentats.
---
6. Sell all glowing meat, glowing blood, and weapons.  Hello Vendor 1400 daily cap limit!
---
7. Repeat daily, and weep at the tedium and laggy vendor interface (optional)
---
Yeah I'll be donating stuff just do I can get a shot at the Raider Armor plans that I'm missing as this is a far better alternative than creating a character, meeting the level requirement and than completing Signal Strength for a chance at the Raider Armor plans that I'm missing.
---
You mean Bethesda hasn't been alienating us ever since they did the Black Friday sale for $20 a week after launching it in a broken bug-ridden state at $60?
---
Sadly the game had great potential, but it is so boring it isn't worth playing long term.
---
What is the point of bethseda even fixing this? horrible change
---
Oh thats great
---
So what you are telling me is that they are deliberately leaving game features broken on purpose just to put people through multiple hoops to get the things they worked and paid for? Sounds like pure scamming to me. Too bad nobody bothered to sue Bethesda or report them to the bureau for product quality control for selling and upkeeping a broken product on the open market.
---
Maybe I might just do that instead of writing an email to their customer support. Maybe that will wake them up to fix their fucking game and focus on bug fixing rather than more cosmetic BS for their atom shop.
---
DTDgamer's top 5 weekly camps will be the fanciest squares. That's it
---
They got rid of that? Why remove unhelpful and negative glitches when you can do shit like that
---
It's still rubbish. I didn't like it before and I dislike it just as much after the patch. Still loads of button clicks and it should know what you have to convert. You shouldnt need to know the amount of ammo you have on you. Do the people who makes this game not play it???
---
We all know they are active on this forum listen to the guys who play it every day and have done since the beta.
---
I don't think you can do that either now? At least that's how the wording made it seem. I'll have to check myself.
---
You have less than three points in Charisma?   I really didn't know people did that.  Thanks for lmk.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Linked so you can pass this on to the devs and communicate what the community sentiments are.
---
Here's some punctuation for you.
---
.  .  . ,  , , . .
---
No more double sided walls.
---
It's complicated to explain really, but my thoughts in prefabs are that:
---
They know people struggle with the awful camp building system - so why would they improve the building mechanics when they can sell a solution.
---
people are always trying to save budget - so selling a prefab that costs less to place down than an equal sized structure is more beneficial to Bethesda than increasing camp budget.
---
Trying to move your camp is difficult due to the bad blueprinting system - again they sell a solution to players who don't know  the work arounds, rather than fix the issue.
---
Anyway I was just using the prefabs as a reference for them creating more of something that they know people will buy, like if they were to add more free standing fence items like short concrete walls etc, people would buy them as a replacement for the lack of floating walls.
---
ah! Thanks its a display bug. Just did the daily bubblegum challenge and got my 250 S.C.O.R.E, many thanks!
---
Do we know it’s not a bug? It’s not in the patch notes
---
Rn I have ace the raider set up. I go to the terminal and change his subroutines to proletariat instead of his usual drugs and ammo. So he looks like ace. But he collects soup and foods.
---
Wow I have a shitty half floating "legacy camp", half of my foundation is floating and I have 4 pieces of floating floors with turrets. I knew I should have fixed it up when I had the chance I just slapped it together to get it done. This is very discouraging, now I'm afraid to rebuild. I'm still kind of new to the game and I've missed out of plenty, I was ok with that but now to have this taken from me before I could really even use it sucks. I've been looking at the pictures of all the awesome camps made with these tricks, sucks I can't replicate now. So are there any cool things we can do with buildings anymore? Or is it just gonna be rectangles now.
---
Shit! 😔
---
it would be a shameless cash grab and i'd be somewhat upset about it too, but if that was available now there wouldn't be this much flak.
---
Boycott fallout 1st!
---
They did it so they can sell a double sided wall for 2000 atoms
---
Mine were like that, and the vats targeting is so terrible with them. I targeted some mole miners up close, the target was for the head and the pellets went above the head, I targeted for the torso and the pellets went above the head, I targeted for the legs and the pellets went above the head yet again. 
---
Tonight I’ve wasted that much ammunition that I’ve decided to call it a day.
---
That's what I thought had happened, because the same thing happened to the sequin dress when the gala dress was added
---
&gt; so I was trying to avoid triggering people
---
You are a not an honest person, if you were really trying, you would not have posted at all.
---
If you'd used at least brain v0.5 you'd know that this is the wrong sub for you to post this.
---
Fuzzy Brenda is best waifu. Leave her out of this.
---
I have a legacy camp now
---
To me it happens when I go into the Legendary Run screen from the reward popup rather than the game menu.
---
"Lit"
---
I'm gonna be pissed when a Scorchbeast crop dusts my CAMP and I gotta look at it with the health bars.
---
We'll never know because they're not transparent about anything. 
---
We're just supposed to sit here and take what they give us (or take away from us) and that's the end of the relationship. The communication throughout the entire company is pathetic. Tons of things in every patch break things, are outright false, or haven't been tested. 
---
It's so frustrating!
---
Be different if there was a stash near ... and something new in the reward pool.
---
I'm likely not going to bother
---
No problem!
---
Not 100% sure. Probably weapons/armour? But we probably get it for free. But you can ofc also for the raider. Just wanted to let you know, sorry if it confused you!
---
I tried it and it works, it’s just that the doors are separate.
---
This is an antiquated system and Beth is doing its damndest to bleed out the last drop from the current CAMP system and do anything and everything to avoid making a new system.
---
This noted, id still wait til 2028 for fallout 5 if it meant a new CAMP/settlement build system, rather than see them hastily rush out a game by 2024 that is using the same system with a few extra bells and bobbles to try and convince us otherwise.
---
No need to feel so entitled. Last year for the scorched event we didn't get any individual rewards for killing scorched and players still made every milestone.
---
I hope they don't nerf the base explosive weapons dealing 100% explosive damage from the second projectile. They already don't deal that much damage even with Demo Expert when compared to other builds so this bug helps make them more viable, even if the launcher dies even faster than normal.
---
Bethesda taking already existing content from a previous game and selling it seperately for real life money? You are not REALLY surprised about it, are you now?
---
I'm scared now.
---
I'd love to see this if you're on Xbox. 😁
---
That is realy realy enoying! The only bug that was Great gets patched 🤦‍♂️
---
No, you have the regular one like I do. Hes talking about the elite with the shoulder stripe. Its different.
---
Ok. Thanks for the info. Much appreciated.
---
I feel this in my bones
---
Sooo... do we know this isn’t a bug? It’s not in the patch notes.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
Anyone over lv13 can take scrapper perk. A lv5 shotgun scraps for the same amount of steel as a lv50 one.
---
Only difference is that low level enemies tend to have pipe guns which scrap for less than the high level assault rifles.
---
Low levels are more likely to need it for ammo though.
---
High levels, unless you're running a guass mini, or have a dream of one day someone offering to trade a legacy for steel, then they are likely to get a surplus - quite simply you acquire more than you use.
---
I assume you mean "exterior," but it's probably that, or because of the instanced ones that are coming down the pike.
---
It doesn't make sense that they'd make the "advanced power connectors" plan more crucial when it's caps only anyway.
---
Also let us display the Porcelain stein from Fasnacht. We can display the wood and steel one, but the one required by the Historian in the event can't be displayed. Just why
---
You can also display the stock metal and wooden steins.
---
Unlike everyone in the comments. I'm glade the rewards are useless. 
---
No more grinding for days to not get what I want and buying it after its been duped to hell and back.
---
Wrong many people used it in camp showcases and Bethesda knew it was popular
---
partnered up with a Phoenix edu dropout.
---
The thing is, you never said it was a prediction, you didn’t even say a single word that made it sound like you were guessing or predicting. Stop misleading people with clickbait titles to get them to click the post
---
yeah just got it its at fort def and when you look at the doors and you will see a terminal to the right
---
It's not those who are working on it, it's the managment who are just wastes of oxygen and semen, they have zero fucks about the player-base and are focused on MONEY. 
---
I almost pity the developers, but at some point someone needs to make a stand to say no more.
---
“Wow what a cool interior wall idea!” *It would be a shame if someone.... patched it.*
---
Honestly it's not a game to me. Just a dude online who needs to get over himself.
---
We will get Wastelanders Part II before we get the Colossal event. Even if it comes out "in the next weeks", it's still an embarassment. Months of delays just to program a simple cave area and modify the stats and name of a boss enemy copy of an enemy THAT ALREADY EXISTED months before.
---
What is the PTS used for lol? Just to preview content that is delayed for multiple months anyway? So Youtubers can show off stuff that gets delayed over and over?
---
Just don't fucking announce new content if you can't deliver or at least have a single prototype that WORKS. Is it that hard? It's BASIC game development 101.
---
Rule 9...
---
You must be new to Fallout 76, welcome! 
---
Fix time is relative to the amount of Atoms Todd is losing out on because of said problem.
---
If they are losing tons of atoms, they usually have it hot patched or disabled in 24 to 48 hours.
---
If its an issue that no players want fixed, it usually gets fixed in a couple of weeks or the next major patch.
---
If its a fix the player base actually wants, expect it to take atleast 8-12 months, and maybe get fixed after the 2nd or 3rd fix.
---
But ya, unfortunetly this glitch is affecting everyone, and they already have some our atoms, so likely it might get patched  before season 3.
---
I didn’t even remember Empath was a thing until you mentioned it lol. That is the one that increases every special point by 2 when in a team correct? I could see how that would be very helpful!
---
The more I think about this change, the more I realize, this could have been avoided. Changes like this should have been flighted with the PTS, cause I don't think I saw or heard anything about it before this update went live.
---
How does one even give junk??
---
I donated 25,000 for 100 provisions to check and see for myself. It's awful.
---
Guess everyone should just blueprint themselves some double walls? Would you be able to place something like that down even?
---
It depends, so many players are made because the Xmas rewards are being recycled that they are saying they'll refuse to participate.
---
They have good shit you can get from them but lorewise? No, definitely not.
---
But then again I don't think the BoS is "cool" either.
---
It's basically a choice between retrofuturistic racists who only want to preserve pre-war technologies and retrofuturistic fascists who want to eliminate everyone who isn't a part of their   community.
---
I had the quest “I am Become Death” be auto-completed for me.
---
And apparently CAMP building is all screwy now.
---
I just got a 2-star Cultist Blade today when completing One Silent Night. Maybe it’s back in the pool with today’s patch 🤷‍♂️
---
What are you talking about? There was totally camp stuff and skins you could get
---
I am absolutely convinced at this point Bethesda is using F76 to test out how much they can switch out their traditional community without attracting too much bad publicity and acquire a new consumer base  that 
---
1. play only a 1-2 hours daily
---
2. doesn't post online at all  outside of FB / instagram
---
3. willing to make impulse decisions like in arcades, FIFA 2020 or candy crush
---
Literally every update is about alienating a loyal part of the old fanbase and pandering towards casual mobile gamers.
---
It has been this way since release. The wastelander update was not some cool content update. They just added another mobile game grinding cycle and everybody hyped up the update so much here nobody was willing to criticize it after the fact.
---
But hey we got soulless NPCs thats good right?
---
On behalf of the F76 community, thank you for those massive contributions. And my condolences for the lackluster rewards.
---
My game is till updating, so I'm not sure exactly, but I would see if talking to Russel or if a box is near him would work.
---
Imagine Bethesda taking an already literally existing and programed item from Fallout 4 and re-selling it for $10 again in F76. Who would think of that and not be surprised?
---
I’ve just not been able to complete any events the same way as all the previous times. 
---
I’ve used nearly 400 rounds on just 2 events tonight?
---
So let him. Has there ever been a real-world case in which winning an Reddit argument actually changed anything?
---
Walk a different path. Don’t worry about if this guy needs to get over himself.
---
Tesla’s broke ,no unique BOS items,bunch of weapons broke and camp items don’t work +Bluescreen and carry weight glitch more common
---
Gods work
---
This sucks.   I typically build a bit when I join the world and part of this is swapping walls about for windows and doors as you said.  I'm only level 26, but building is a huge part of the fun in this game and has been since I got my CAMP.  I hope it is some kind of bug or over sight....
---
My guess is it's easier to fix those so they do to pad the updates
---
I wonder if the double wall messes with the camp interiors that are coming later this year.
---
Any platform that wants so much control over your experience is going to eventually destroy what you loved about it. This game was designed to milk the user, unlike their other games where the community literally fixed their games for them they chose to just leave everything broken and fix it in monthly installments.
---
This will only get worse. 
---
Many of you are suffering from a sunken cost fallacy and I can tell you, it happened to WoW, it happened to League, it can happen to you.
---
As for building, FO4 modding community has done wonders for improvement and customization over the years and will definitely hit your itch. And you only pay once.
---
they are so fun tho
---
I made one contribution, just to see for myself.   
---
Dropped 250 steel in the box and got 5 grenades.   
---
No thanks, lads.   
---
Might make one donation for each material, maybe. If I'm feeling generous. But I'm less "volunteer", more "mercenary".    
---
Pay me.
---
TRUUUEEEE. Let us havebthe option to craft ones that have color
---
Reading the updates made me sad. Let’s fuck over the people who play the game . The camp mechanics need to be changed so we have less building restrictions , not more .  I love building and I was working on a UFO build , guess that’s off the table .
---
No Colossal problem event?!
---
Not defending it by any means but do you think the developers actually look at that stuff?  I don't.
---
If they had left the croc backpack in I had 100,000 steel and a minimum of 20,000 of all the other kinds of scrap except cork (5k ish) I was willing to throw in plus additional farming.
---
It really wouldn't have taken much incentive.
---
Yeah I know that. I'm kinda bummed that the ones we can craft don't have color
---
I mean they said they added them to the game. They didn't say they made them for sale.
---
That wasn't me, but ive seen a snippet which mentions a few fixes to wall function. It specifically mentions floating walls. Didnt mention anything else.
---
They're probably prepping to release "Double Sided Walls" in the atomic shop tbh
---
My guess by looking at the device itself is that they had a different plan to make it work by just using the actual ammo converter device itself. That somehow didn't work out in time so they quickly threw something together with the personal terminal device that was already in the game....and now we're kinda stuck with it as they seem to deny completely reworking it.
---
No your completely right but that’s what they should be doing not blatantly ignoring the please of the community
---
Building is the endgame content for me. This makes me really sad. No wonder Jug hasn't updated his YouTube channel in over a year.
---
I just donated 250 steel to ATLAS and it took double the donation. Started with 1029 clicked donate twice ended with 29.. I guess the good news is I did get 4 donation packages but i'm also positive I only clicked donate twice for 500 (250 each).
---
Never failed for me.  My mule has a base in same location near a station.  I use the cigarette machine as it’s unlimited (or I haven’t found a limit yet).  I tend to 10 legendaries at a time.
---
Does this mean my camp will be missing walls when I log in?
---
Well I guess but the thing Is didn't need to be fixed, that's the problem it was fine the they it was
---
Dont worry, youll be able to buy some BoS themed things in a bundle that lasts a week before being shelved for six months. I mean, who wants to earn things amirite?
---
I’m here for the gangbang
---
serious question what is going on on the PTS forums, are there PTS forums? Are the devs interacting? Did PTS players post about this, what is going on guys on the PTS servers?
---
Nah. The dupers will single handely carry the events in the first week.
---
Or Bethesda will offer us a bundle to finish the event for only 50000 atoms.
---
Not for Project Clean Appalachia.
---
Indeed. But I think due to game engine or art style limitations, she is quite different from the mugshot.
---
Wow that's a bit drastic my dude xD
---
you can talk to him, then there is a large box nearby (iirc left of russel when facing him) that allows you to deposite 250 of the item in question
---
You're a silly person, I've never used a tesla with hopes of killing the enemy
---
Ah ok thank you 😊
---
You know, you're right  Have a great day, my dude :)
---
Wait, what happens to existing structures? I have some double sided walls, and if they are fucked, my whole camp idea which I have been building since launch has to be scrapped!
---
Not sure yet dailies haven’t reset for me
---
Im just commenting so this post get's more recognition
---
That would be the smart way to do things, or at least add the perk loadouts first, a flaw that modders on pc fixed first thing after launch.  But this is Bethesda we're talking about here, and they have a policy of doing things bass ackwards...
---
I’m guessing that’s related to the literal rubbish in the Atom Store this week.
---
I sadly used 4k steel on this just to get stuff I already had :( not using anymore definitely. this is a bad joke
---
I just think we should be completely forthcoming on what they fixed. A bug that people were using to make things that were unintended in the game, no matter how amazing these things were.
---
here is the current link im not sure how often they plan to update it though, if its like past events its gonna be once a day for updates and not at all over the weekend
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Is it though,is it ?
---
Is was so simple yet they still fuck it up. I wonder when we will have an Update that doesn't break the game even more, 1 step forward a huge tumble down
---
I would too. That thing was duped to hell and everyone who has one wants only legacies for them.
---
For me my aim is very decent all I can't handle is a 4v1 other than that I can we'll handle myself without *"vats"* it's an easy challenge
---
I found 2 bugs. You are right - they do not do stuff for money
---
Bionicleboy2005:*\*fuming\** "1 million cork! Can you fucking imagine it?"
---
MysteryGhoul: "It's 200 mill.."
---
Bionicleboy2005: *\*head explodes\**
---
Those are some cool looking junkyard PA skins. Too bad I have dozens on PA skins.
---
The wall glitch is what you use to have interior walls with wall paper on both sides.
---
Fair enough, I know what you mean about the prefabs. 
---
This is just my conspiracy theory, well have to see how things go.
---
The way it looks to me though is that they would rather sell a solution than fix a problem.
---
Lack of stash space - Scrap box
---
Lack of camp budget - prefabs
---
Weapons that break easy - repair kits (Do people buy these?)
---
Food spoiling too fast - fridge (could have added a basic one for free?)
---
Anyway, I HOPE it's just a fuck up on their part and it will be fixed (unlikely), or they 're work the whole building system to make fun builds less difficult. (very unlikely as they can keep selling prefabs to people who struggle)
---
Can we please get a response on this issue?
---
^get ^gud
---
Log a ticket- play the lottery
---
Ammoconverter is BROKEN. You cant get out of it at all now so you have to quit and log back in to keep playing ... ANNND who thought it would he a good idea to put the sell and buy options in the same place .... ANNND now it shows all the ammo we could buy or sell NOT just whats in our inventory so that's super f***ing annoying. Takes even longer to get rid of ammo than it did before. ANNND did I mention you get trapped inside the machine???
---
If that’s your endgame, honestly I suggest checking out FO4 just to build. At least there, you could work on and save progress on settlements you have taken over. I know it ain’t online, or 76, but considering you say building is your endgame I suggest checking out FO4 settlement building. A bunch of assets people are asking for (asking to pay for in the atom shop nonetheless) are already in game, or even available through mods (consoles as well). Building is pretty much limitless. There’s even an unlimited building cap mod too. You can add settlers and run raids for fun too.
---
Change C.A.M.P. skin to any other than the season reward skin. Then blueprint your camp and rebuild. I had it happen to me. Only solution available.
---
You as well.
---
Nah that ones different this one's got the shoulder pads from the lonesome road dlc
---
Yeah it’s gotten worse
---
...yeah. the Elite ranger armor. i have that.
---
Why can't it just take all the ammo you throw in and convert it to points in one shot? Total shit.
---
why would that be an issue ? really has no effect
---
I’ve seen them but it’s not affected me. I’ve got a “magic” double barrelled shotgun which kills anything with one shot so until they fix that, I’m fine.
---
No it's listed in the patch notes as "in the coming weeks"
---
This is what you guys choose to respond to? Not the unnecessary wall glitch fix?
---
I dunno man maybe they left them in as a *surprise* for players
---
Never did I expect to be fighting **for** walls
---
The only one everybody is actually going to try for is the BOS collectron station, which is going to require 250mil cloth to get
---
The only thing I can think of is server stability.
---
The ranger armor from Fallout 1st has many variants. You have the original, Advanced, and Elite. There's even a desert paint option for them. Only thing is....these were limited. For some reason on a paid subscription service items are limited and get changed monthly.
---
Yes, pack up your Xbox and send it to 
---
B Gates
---
Microsoft inc
---
USA
---
I would assume that trade windows have potential to cause duping . Make it a terminal and avoid another exploit
---
Double sided walls will return for 2,000 atoms in a bundle with a 7 day limited timer
---
The website isn't even updating how much has been donated.
---
Donated 1k steel, saw the absolute trash rewards and said fuuuuuck that!
---
Builders unite! Downvots this! Revert the wall-swap change!
---
Really?? Wow. I love the way it looks, too. That's a bummer. Thanks for the heads up. I have to move again now, don't I?
---
Id rather this game switch to the way all other successful games go- Pay every year or so for a new content pack and have cosmetics and camp stuff in the game to earn.
---
This gaming a-la-carte thing is trash.
---
I don’t think people buy repair kits, and those who do don’t know any better. It’s the least effective way to repair gear. Advanced repair kits repair to 160%, and I can use scrap to repair to 200%. Using atoms to repair to 100% is just silly. 
---
And the fridge is also a silly complaint. The backpack and good with salt perks are both more effective. Are you really going to story heavy food on your fridge and have to go back to your stash anytime you want to eat? Lol
---
Also I don’t struggle building. Far from it. I do like the prefabs though. They lead to some interesting builds.
---
They need to fix ultracite laser rifles, the damage is straight worse than a normal laser rifle and that makes no sense seeing as how it’s supposed to increase base damage like the ultracite Gatling laser does over base gatling laser. They should also buff durability again for laser and plasma rifles but I’d be happy with just fixing the damage values because it already has a lower mag capacity to compensate for it’s higher damage that it SHOULD have over standard laser weapons but it doesn’t.
---
Community just likes having something to complain about with this game unfortunately.
---
Built a massive mansion a few months ago using a build budget glitch, glad I have a mansion that defies all the recently new building rules.
---
The Pocketed and Deep Pocketed SS limb mods aren't showing up in Regs' list to purchase
---
This is satire, right? There's no way someone can be so melodramatic and care so much about something so trivial
---
Unpopular opinion I guess but the whole "CAMP" system is something I hate. I hated that it was shoehorned into FO4's main quest and I hate that it's basically all there is to do in 76's endgame. Ideally I'd love to see it(and voiced protagonists) gone for good.
---
It may not affect you but it affects others greatly
---
Hell... Yes... Mate!
---
Honestly, its actions like this that make me laugh. Because todd said he expects fo76 to be around for along time. Actions like this are putting them closer and closer to the trash. We put food on there tables and in return we get a game that works as if it was developed by 2 toddlers on there leap-frog laptop.
---
Try and let us know!
---
Unfortunately, yeah. I'm not even sure how they managed to do it, because the skins from the Wastelanders bundles work fine.....
---
NW sucks so I’d rather not “get gud”.
---
The Meat Week goal is just for another run of Meat Week in September while the first is in August.
---
Too bad the % chance for the rare rewards is so slim, that it's not worth the hussle. Besides, even the community rewards suck. The double challenge reward one and discount purveyor are just normal community events that are being sold as rewards so they can shut us up. No thanks chief.
---
Takes a bit till they are in your account, no hurry
---
I make those and give them to noobs all the time. Way cheaper than building an equivalent hunting rifle. I’m always a stealth sniper build and I’d have loved it if someone had handed me one of these right out of the vault.
---
anything but doesn’t seem to work on legendary crafting
---
I agree.
---
Works for ammo, weapons, armor, flux. Pretty much everything except legendary crafting
---
Man, those duper’s ruin everything
---
So you don't even have to use them, only equip them?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_ranger_armor_outfit
---
Are existing double walls still there?
---
If the ONLY thing that you truly enjoy as an endgame is building, this completely neuters it for many of us.
---
It's a shitty shooter with craptastic and bipolar loot. Building is the only part that really sets it apart from other games of this ilk. And now a major avenue of building creativity has been removed for no good reason. Did it negatively impact ANYTHING? Or was it just an easy checkbox so it looks like they're doing something?
---
I really don't get anyone apologizing for BGS at this point. They can't fix actual, gamebreaking bugs but \*THIS\* somehow gets priority.
---
Perfect thank you
---
Lol imagine it’s not keeping track
---
Honest to god, I would pay.
---
Lol that’s what I was trying to say just got a little carried away with my example but some actual interior walls would be nice that way people wouldn’t have to waste camp budget with the double wall glitch
---
Yep.  Not until they fix it to match the other mods, which I'm sure they'll do - eventually.
---
Just hold the o button to exit, works Everytime for me
---
I'm happy I just competed my latest build, which I planned on keeping a while anyways. This really sucks, but I'm more fortunate than others. I like to build and that won't change, but this is a big blow.
---
And on xbox you can't leave the menu.  You need to press B, but it goes only 1 "page" back. And you can only exit the converter when you go back all "pages".
---
It's like you browsed for hours in the internet and you can only close the browser if you go back to you first page...
---
Was same before, but atleast there was a main menu button
---
I was just thinking about complaining about it at 40 atoms.
---
I have 280 hours @ level 580
---
It might be, highly doubt that me puting down some floating walls as fencing around my CAMP is putting that much lag on the engine. But i would like a genuine response from them or for this to be reverted right away
---
Oh, the drive in, I love that one!
---
So no croc bag? BOO!
---
As someone else pointed out,  it's probably financially motivated. Bethesda is most likely planning on adding a type of "interior wall" to the atom shop, and the bug that we've been using since beta to mimic that would directly impede sales.
---
This
---
Creative camp building dies means a huge amount of people are going to exit this game for good.
---
It used to only show you options if you had enough ammo to trade in.
---
Don't have enough?  It didn't show that option.
---
Now it presents all options ~~if you have enough ammo of that type to do the smallest transaction~~ always.  If you select an option for which you have insufficient ammo, it says "transaction failed".  
---
It also does not show you how much of each ammo type you have, so you better have a good memory of how much of each ammo type you have.
---
Please only show options we can actually do.
---
Alternatively, make it a trade window that gives us ammo points, which we can see in pipboy/stats/collections.  
---
You already have a system in place for transferring items.  Please, just use that.
---
Still working fine for me. Just walked up and hugged a Super Mutant and his pet doggy and they didn't even blink.
---
It's never gonna happen at this point. It will come as a new reskin an sold later on.
---
I got a nocturnal ss arm today .... awesome
---
There's a couple large metal boxes scattered around. The easiest one to find is in the middle of the big flat area that looks like a makeshift vertibird landing pad.
---
Honestly even with the glitch, I used the pipe power connectors which was allowed to be built through walls. Sure, glitches like the door to wall trick made it easier but fundamentally the function is still the same. If not more flush with the actual power connectors as opposed to wire going through a solid wall lol 
---
Likely biased tho, I see fucked up glitched wiring and equate it to a floating camp base lol
---
Fo4 had some electricity expansion/overhaul that I think this community would really be able to do some incredible work with if brought to 76
---
I meant against imposter sheep
---
I would say I have good news and bad news, but there is no good news. There are some plans, low drop rate, but nothing event specific, and nothing you can't get somewhere else. Basically you're looking at vendor level plans for the most part, and not even the good ones. No calibrated shocks, not even a token event beer stein.
---
 Here's the reward table: 
---
Used one of the infinite weight limit or storage glitches lol. 
---
People complain about abusing exploits now but in the early days there were SO many broken game mechanics that people abused all the time.
---
Same, I love the Fallout experience but do get sad and frustrated at the behaviour of Bethesda.
---
Proc?
---
Oh god what has Bethesda done this time?
---
It's a bit too late for that, I can't even log in now.
---
What are the prizes?
---
I was hoping they would include some of the more pain in the ass to get ultracite recipes since it is the bos
---
Patchnotes said so. 250 and 500 respectively
---
edit:  
---
**Secret Service Armor:** Added plans to craft Pocketed and Deep Pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs. They can be purchased for 250 and 500 Gold Bullion respectively from Regs in Vault 79.
---
I'm not adding any new walls in my camp until they make this a proper feature.
---
Agreed on Ultracite mods.  Give us another avenue other than SBQ to obtain those, Bethesda.
---
I'm gonna grind west tek for steel because I have nothing else to do and I still need some plans they drop.
---
it was a 1st reward a while ago.
---
I dont. I built a pvp character. Realized I wasn't a fan and now play NW. You might like it. Many do.
---
I had to actually contact Bethesda Support last week. And after 5-6 days they reset the quest and now it works.
---
I understand. I dumped 2k in there and I'm probably going to leave it at that. For me the game is all about killing shit and picking up garbage so I've got a several many tons to spare.
---
No kidding. I did very similar things for my vendors!
---
I've had a legacy CAMP ever since they removed the ability to sink iron posts into the terrain, apparently. Guess everyone is doomed to floating stilt-less houses. 
---
Learned this yesterday when I tried to recreate my CAMP on my 2nd character so I can place the new C.A.M.P. from Seasons, only to find much of what I did the first time is impossible... and I still have neon letters stuck inside of a cement foundation I can't remove.
---
There's honestly no reason the building mechanics in this game continue to grow more restrictive. Especially when underground builders are still making more glitched bunkers than the Free States.
---
I've been there 3 times today, and every time they're was someone's 1st tent right near the spawn point.
---
Got it, of course they don't have an option for that in the INI though, so it has to be done via drivers?
---
time to bring in "Ralph" the wonder Llama...
---
Mine weigh 1.06 with scattershot, but without scattershot they weigh  10.64. 
---
I’ve too many to put into my stash and being able to re spec my character. 
---
I’m always reaching my scrip limit and dropping my legendary items is the only way I can off load the items.
---
Not so far...
---
No sense, we already known all this plans. This event for new players, not endgame. That's problem.
---
Massive agree to disagree with you and that. Faster means nothing when the interface and ratios are so wildly out of whack
---
I wouldn't like it either, but we all know who and what  Zenimax is ( The owners of Bethesda).
---
It's probably them with a spinning dart board full of shitty drunken ideas, and they end up picking the worst.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Elite_riot_gear This is what the guy is wearing in the atom shop photo, not that one you posted.
---
No, that was roofs an foundations an few other items, never walls.
---
I guess this is a fix, over a fix, over a fix... If im not wrong there was a reported bug that manipulating walls was crashing servers or making them super slow... Something like this but I'm not 100% sure
---
I know you if the thing connected on the other end needs to be repaired you need to reconnect the wire. Thats the only funky thing ive ever niticed. Maybe it does more damage on the server behind the scene than we relise?
---
Havent visited ATLAS yet, is steel the first thing to deposit? In which case Im probably gonna help with this one and see how it goes as steel is easy to come by
---
It’s because the town on the map and the town in the challenge are spelt differently
---
Indeed. At this point I just want the updates to stop coming since they do more harm than good lmao
---
&gt;Light and Ultralight mods are coming as well.
---
Let me guess, 'soon' or 'in a future patch'...
---
On PC, yup, started after this update, FPS drops like crazy in some situations, where lotsa dead bodies, like in events.
---
Do you guys happen to use any mods? Wondering if there is a connection there, might try "vanilla"...
---
You can't even sink iron posts into the ground anymore for stilts on your house. WHY?! What on earth did removing the ability to sink **FUCKING IRON POSTS** attempt to fix?!?!
---
Works with doorways, solid walls and windows. Tested personally.
---
Any specific place on the map? Like by any major landmarks?
---
You should get scrip or something every time you turn in steel but there would need to be a limit to stop duper’s. It would be yet another thing halted by the fucking assholes who are dupers and/or Bethesda’s incompetence to fix the duping issue
---
Guess I’m keeping my camp forever.
---
I RPd siding with the Raiders. *sob*
---
I know I can still buy it but that grind for rep *sobs moar*
---
The Devs collectively spitting in your face.
---
If you get it, could you explain the reasoning? Because I surely don't get it.
---
I spend most of my time building in this game, and this is going to restrict my creativity and desire to spend hours on a build. They change a way we build, but yet I can't remove stairs when there's nothing attached to them, and items outlined by green are floating? Come on, Bethesda, this is beyond a fucking joke now. Do they even play the game or look at what the community actually needs fixed?
---
Yes. The box is right near the Russel guy. It looks like a supply drop.
---
But fyi, the plans you can get are plans that are in the base game already.
---
Dear future . . . potential . . .members . . . come to . . . us . . . that is all .
---
They are your binding to the team.  Once you have been with the team for a few minutes it will fill up and you will get the public team bonus.  Each team member has one with each other team member.  So if you have a full team and someone leaves and a new person joins then they will need to bind to the team before their bonus to the rest of the team and the team’s bonus to them take effect.
---
Actually I’d bet they did it because they’re planning a double sided interior wall for the atom shop.
---
while i do see your point. why are you on this sub then?
---
I saw this a few months ago, had to take a pic because ya know, why not. It has been one of loaf screens ever since :)
---
Definitely a max of 10 working on the .esm with the Creation Kit.
---
Maybe one guy who is good at designing sets, another who makes quests and a third who only knows how to set up the dialogue facial morphs.
---
The rest is up to temps who probably have less of an idea about how the game works after they get rotated out.
---
Lol, thanks
---
Booze, radaway, grenades and mines, basically the shit you sell for a handful of caps when you wander into a train station. Plans too I hear but they're nothing you can't get elsewhere that I've seen.
---
It is not implemented yet, it's coming in the next few weeks.
---
Not sure if its just me, but can anyone else confirm on Xbox that Adrenaline perk in Nuclear Winter is still broke?  I just equipped it and downed 2 people with a grenade and didnt' see any proc notice of adrenaline in my kill feed.  /u/Ladydevann \- I'll try testing some more to see if I can confirm.
---
EDIT: Definitely is still broke in NW, tried shooting AI and also confirmed downing/killing players is still not proc'ing adrenaline in NW.  Also chedked weapon damage, no dice, back off it goes :(
---
Well that doesn’t surprise me; it is Bethesda after all. They’d flog a dead donkey if it meant getting players to buy more Atom points.
---
i had just realized i put the wrong one and edited my comment as you posted that. that outfit IS in the game as the Elite ranger armor
---
They will tell everyone we met the goal regardless. I won't be donating shit, those rewards are lazy.
---
They replied in another thread they are 'looking into' why they weren't included.
---
If they make it to where they can be sold then my gripe with them will disappear. Otherwise stay out of the loot pool.
---
Oh, so it's my link to each member? That explains why I don't have one. Lol So you don't need to actually spend time close to them right?
---
There are many building techniques that were destroyed by this patch, but some of them were workarounds that could have been replaced by adding new building components that offered those capabilities. 
---
How about double high wall panels? How about double ended electrical connectors so you can pass a wire through walls or ceilings?
---
Instead of addressing the shortcomings of the building system with solutions, or paying attention to the expressed wishes of players, they have made the building system even more limited.
---
I just don't get it, since this will discourage elaborate CAMP building and therefore the sales of camp items like wallpaper.
---
As my camp currently is, I can never replicate it's aesthetics, so I will never be moving or rebuilding. 
---
They should've been watching YouTube videos that have all of the tips and tricks for how to do the things that players want to do, and implemented all of those as features.
---
Nothing about CAMP design gives you an advantage in gameplay, so it's not an exploit. This should not have been prioritized anyway, hundreds of gameplay breaking bugs that are still ignored.
---
So mad
---
For instance if you join a building team you start with +1 INT but if others join or you joined a public team then after like 1-2 minutes your +1 becomes +2/3/4 depending on how many people.  Only for public teams though.
---
The only thing that should have changed was the ability to convert all amounts of ammo...from 1 to 1000000000 and to increase  the amount of points we could hold....it can be done for the vendors why cant it be done for this
---
I've always thought that the amusement park needed to be an event similar to Fauschnat. Folks have to get the park ready for opening. Fix this, collect that, fight off scorched.
---
bags full of missiles and 40mm are probably the only thing keeping my explosives build stocked with ammo. Damage is trash but with the right perks I can carry enough ammo and launchers to explode all of Appalachia
---
Twitch, sometimes I watch streamers play fallout 76 and talk to them about their game while I also stream on twitch.
---
They're 99% nice of the time because they're more worried about losing viewers etc. But its nice to just talk about the game and what they're doing.
---
Double sided walls coming soon in the atom shop? That would be my guess.
---
If that is what they end up doing, they're going to severely piss off a very large portion of their playerbase. 
---
Wouldn't be surprised in the slightest.
---
Bring back the double wall glitch, it was the only way to make creative builds and now i can't finish my camp and so many others are in the same boat.
---
It's the Bethesda HQ Fallout 76 update meeting. Where they discuss what to delay next, what to break next, an what fun to ruin.
---
Thanks for this tip! Some other folks mentioned the flamethrower trick but didn't go into detail.
---
Let's see if in a few months time, once everyone has forgotten about this, if we get 2 sided Interior walls on the atom shop...
---
Or more free standing walls like the junk fences, but in brick or wood...
---
And of course it's about making money, everything they do is to make money, it's obvious that nobody who works there has any passion for this game or even plays it. 
---
Purely there for the pay check, or more likely, the development team are a handfull of apprentices on work experience, and are payed next to nothing and therefore do the bare minimum they can get away with.
---
👍
---
The 'community' like most can be coloured by a loud vocal minority.
---
It's just as tedious and now that they've lumped the buy and sell into one menu, they've made it easier to accidentally buy ammo you don't want (especially if you use a controller). Also, they removed the back to main menu option to exit out of the terminal after you purchase ammo, effectively trapping you in the menu until you keep hitting back enough times to escape the madness. They took the lazy route by just adding multiples of ten and one hundred just to up the amount you could earn and spend at one time. Yeah they removed some of the submenus but none of the inefficiencies. I'm wondering if their game engine doesn't allow for a more efficient buying/selling system, or even a barter system for that matter. Also, f*** using a dumb terminal for the thing. It sucks. Why can't they use some sort of left to right and up/down arrow system for just choosing an amount. And why am I locked into a transaction falled if I don't have the amount. Just let me put all my ammo in at once in one shot and let the game do the calculating. Why am I supposed to be the calculator?
---
Nah will still support them. They got the guns
---
I haven't seen it and I've had FO1st for about 3 months now. I wish I did have it.
---
Nope just have to be on the team.  You never have to be in close proximity oddly.  They goal is to have people team up and possibly do stuff together but nothing is being forced.
---
Read the patch notes.
---
So basically can't kill anything
---
I was already bummed when they made it so that wood half-stairs became much harder to use with staggered foundations.  This just absolutely stinks.  Guess I don't dare touch any of my camps now as my two main ones rely quite a bit on double walls and whatnot.  Hate how building keeps getting more and more restricted.  It was already limited enough as it was.  
---
I would almost forgive it if they could make pieces snap properly without tiny offsets or gaps... Almost.
---
Oh. I haven't noticed that, but I'll test it tonight. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Usual rubbish then. I can set up the Collectron and get that stuff for free. Half the time I end up dropping it anyway to keep the weight load down.
---
Do you think they would allow us to fail these missions? The number isnt updated live, so they could make up whatever number they want and say "Wow, this community is doing an amazing job working together in our awesome amazing community event! Go team! Buy atoms!"
---
It's unwelcome, unnecessary and also something that also has at least three hours old threads on the top of the sub already.
---
YES.... you're 100% right!   It takes way too long to find a match and then actually begin.   It took me an hour yesterday to lvl up for the daily and I swear most of it was sitting around waiting to play.
---
I doubt Bethesda will add more rewards to it, they already got feedback about them in the last events and they changed nothing. If the event doesn't succeed, I imagine they will just put them on the Atomic Shop later on.
---
We can't see how much has been donated, how can we know that our effort will be rewarded? Maybe I donate 100k steel but we don't meet the goal anyway and so I'm out of 100k steel and no useful rewards for me, or perhaps the event will succeed regardless of participation anyway with Bethesda just making up numbers, so why bother?
---
All I wanted was a chance at Ultracite Calibrated Shocks plans or perhaps some new BoS related cosmetics, but instead we got junk that we can find everywhere.
---
I've had no (new) problems.
---
Well unless you count my variable weight capacity which went up and down seemingly at random when I first logged on - apparently its to do with an Unyielding armour bug. Once I fixed a low durability piece it stabilised again, but of course it should not have fluctuating in the first place!
---
And another I nearly forgot about...today's challenge 'build a floor/wall decor x5' would have been far easier if it counted to 5 properly. I managed 3 and it stopped. Switched it a new item and it went to 4 and stopped counting. Needed a third item to complete...so 8 items of 3 types rather than 5 of 1.
---
...and don't start me on the BoS not accepting Bulked Steel after my long FT to Atlas. That was a wasted journey,especially as you can't simply 'unbulk' again.
---
I'm glad I live under a bridge. Unless they need with my double garage door setup I'm golden
---
Thank you for the info! &lt;3
---
Nah, there’s something new. I did most of the challenges on my main, switches to a junkie’s alt, and leveled up SCORE like 3 times during project paradise. I only have like 8 intelligence on that character.
---
Looks like Bethesda trying to listen to the fans and go back to the series roots. But falling down the hill it leads to.
---
Thankyou!
---
Yeah I am very sure I have all or atleast almost all, mainly in it for the community event rewards tbh, not that Ill cry if I dont get my BoS beret
---
I'm sorry. But not really.
---
I sell booze in my diner for 2 caps each. Folks eat that shit up, especially on drink booze challenge day.
---
Cancel your fallout 1st. I have. Enough of us do it and they might pay attention. Log a support ticket over it as well!
---
This ⤴️
---
Oh. Ok. Yeah, I did notice I'm never getting sneak crits when I play with a couple friends. It's a noticeable difference in damage too. I've learned to live with it and just shoot a few more rounds.
---
That's a fuck ton of if's, or's and let's see's
---
No. It's seriously a novel form of Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Super disappointed. I can’t find any good head gear that goes well with the actual outfit.
---
Atlas
---
I'd deleted the previous message, because I thought I got my answer, but no. I went back in to the SS vendor to double check, went through the list of plans one by one, and I can confirm there is neither deep pocketed or pocketed in there.
---
No pocketed or deep pocketed limbs for SS armour, that was in the patch notes.
---
Not normal, although it’s been a while since I played other MMO’s. Vast majority of my MMO experience was world of Warcraft up to Cataclysm. NOTHING even CLOSE to this level of bugginess.
---
I'm pretty sure that Youtuber meant as a solo. I think that's okay for a Group Event.
---
Happens over on console too which is as vanilla as you can get.
---
It has to do with all the flies from the meat piles imo.
---
Or lag for almost every action involving items?
---
Yeah I agree, except for the collectron I really dont care, bet the collectron isnt all that anyway
---
Bethesda is a bunch of fun suckers ,they like to fix bugs that aren't bothering the game but they can't fix fast travel or anything major
---
What is their reasoning for this? Was it on purpose or did it come out because they fixed something else and this was broken in the process? I mean just really Bethesda?? Why?
---
Maybe if the BOS give out bubblegum as well...
---
The server hop is key after getting sludge lung, just like when your trying to get mutations via rads.
---
You need to get another disease after getting sludge lung to get the challenge to complete, but there is a server timer that will keep you from getting a new disease in time if you dont server hop.
---
The sceptic in me thinks it is all made up anyway and the number will be pulled from a Fastnacht hat regardless of how much scrap is wasted on this event.
---
If you don't like it, leave. Bethesda's established that they either can't or are unwilling to work more quickly on bug fixes, so posts like this serve a singular purpose, that being clogging up our feeds. If you're incapable of appreciating the good things that the devs have done for us, I'm impressed that you managed to make it this far into your playthrough without having a mental breakdown, and now that you've finally had one and are throwing a hissy fit, I'd kindly like to ask you to leave. Insulting bethesda is pointless, obnoxious, and unoriginal.
---
Listen to the unencrypted messages from Paladin Rhamani. They are demanding resources and fortifications.
---
Russell is a simp.
---
They saw too many post about it last week. Too many people being creative. They don't obey!
---
I only play the game for building and some trading I think I’m going to find something else to play
---
The +60% makes a huge difference in ammo consumption during queen fights.
---
I will try it without any vats perk cards and see if that helps. 
---
One of my gauss shotguns is +50% vats crit and was hoping to try and spec it for use.
---
Maybe...
---
Im really curious about those numbers too, would be kinda fun if its all BS
---
It is a feature of the gauss shotgun. 
---
But wait! If you buy the secret service skin it will look slightly better while you walk around not being able to kill anything for just 500 Atoms.
---
Big sad
---
also no more getting wires through windows then converting them to walls...
---
Community rewards, Is that where the ss deep pocketed mods are hiding
---
I don't see why they even decided to do this. Literally NO ONE is asking for these 'fixes'. In fact, the opposite is true: people are asking for even more freedom in building.
---
Let's be honest- there's not much left to do in this game once you've beaten everything. For some, the building is the only real endgame left, and Bethesda just took that away from them. 
---
Bethesda is better off removing restrictions and letting folks artistic freedom run wild. 
---
It's going to be 2 years soon. Learn your playerbase already. Don't expect people to buy camp items from the Atom Shop when there's either no space for them or they can't use them the way they want to.
---
I can't recall if I knew this for FO4 but I absolutely didn't know it in FO76.  Thanks for the tip!
---
They seemed to trade it for the Bungalow.
---
That thing is fixed at the expense of the wall doors.
---
Ward first.
---
Please thank you
---
They aren't real anyway, just pixel fiction.
---
The good news for Bethesda is that the rage over the camp changes is really pushing the anger over how crappy this event is to the back burner.
---
If you were on a team when "I am Become Death" autocompleted, someone on your team launched a nuke. Happened to me shortly after public teams (never played on teams before that)
---
Saving it for a good game
---
Calm down. I gotchoo https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/i3u6wh/double_sided_walls_solution/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I stupidly did this too, a few weeks ago.
---
Worse, I tried scrapping the roof above it, and now I can't replace the roof.
---
I thought Murmrgh was a lady mole?
---
&gt;"Wow, this community is doing an amazing job working together in our awesome amazing community event! Go team! Buy atoms!"
---
😎
---
Yup. Go to Atlas Observatory. I just noticed there's one right next to the spawn point. When you spawn in follow the road that leads up hill to the left. You'll see a big metal box (it sort of looks like a nuke card crate) with a BOS totem next to it.
---
You could use the brick wall with the long narrow window - you can jump right through it.
---
Grahm doesn’t allow for the censorship of meat, *any kind of meat.*

Fret not. Double sided is still achievable.
---
Hey, yknow that's a good idea. Why bother hearing out a pretentious prick? lmao. i swear people like you are incapable of being self aware
---
All I wanted for Patch 21 was Deep Pocketed mods for SS Armor....this sucks.
---
Just get another player who needs the challenge, you both join at the same time, each take a turn and kill each other.
---
Sure they could do something better than current system but at least they made some improvements.
---
I have found solution
---
if only it was smart enough to know what ammo i have to convert.  not just show every single option.  old way was growing on me, and worked great with smaller amounts to convert.   back to throwing excess ammo out at a train station
---
i gave it up already 😁
---
I just donated 250 for shits, and got a crate. Inside the crate was 3 water, a frag mine and a couple other immediately forgettable items. I was happier with the steel.
---
No more fighting!
---
I just wish i new the logic behind the restrictions for building. Just... why?
---
Why would anyone buy FO1st then?
---
That sounds rough. I already have some enemies that don't want to die.
---
Phoenix in Watoga sells them at the Super Mart for around 900 caps or do the quest and get it for free
---
That specific camp might be legacy but you can still build the rubiks cube
---
I just went searching and was wondering if I looked in the wrong place as it was patch notes.  Man that sucks
---
Yknow she's excavating something in the basement of the rusty pick... i think we might just get a chance to kill whatever she's digging down to find
---
you have to go into the generator room and route power to the terminal
---
All I can say is harass them about this at every turn - on Twitter, on Facebook, on their broken personal forums and so on.
---
You can't change doors as well. I love using the bungalow door. You had to use a different door then replace it to use it. Also used windows to snap curtains onto doorways by replacing them. Now you can't do any of that. REVERT THIS CHANGE BETHESDA!
---
Other complaints aside, just to confirm: are you really trying to say that it takes 30 minutes to create (and hopefully test) a new, high-definition skin for an existing item?
---
If so, I'm not sure which you know less about: art or game development.
---
That's ironic.
---
This would be considered "funny" and "lit". Bethesda doesn't do such things.
---
Most likely!
---
Did you go buy the plans? Or are you saying that you went to buy the plans and they weren’t there?
---
They made cork reward one of the two more score rewards. Sly bastards.
---
They screwed up any lingering excitement I may have had for future events. Not being a smart ass, I just feel like they dropped the ball pretty hard on this one. This is what they came up with to drum up excitement for their next big push, and all we got was an event where we can earn vendor trash by turning it into a random guy who isn't even with the BOS. Basically we're trading a crazy guy some trash for some liquor. An exciting new wino economy. I count that as a screw up since it definitely makes me apprehensive about the quality of any new content they may be trying to sell me.
---
Convert &gt; \[tab\] &gt; convert &gt; \[tab\] &gt; convert &gt; \[tab\] ...... &gt; \[tab\] &gt; \[tab\] and you are back to main menu ...
---
Think on consoles that would be O or B button. Whatever goes back one menu in terminals.
---
It was intended to be
---
Either way. She gots to go.
---
Actually, it should just be a challenge for 76 hours.
---
Don't think you understand what "rare" means. Anyone can get these plans, if anything they're more than common. You seem to be the only person defending these rewards, lol.
---
Hey they fixed ammo converter!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yup. Came here to check I was not the only one.
---
I think they are actively trying to make less money
---
They were supposed to add them, but they haven't yet.
---
It’s the apocalypse, protein is protein .. would you rather be a cannibal
---
Don’t know if you have seen but there seems to be a truck load of new bugs. So much for the PTS testing the patch.
---
Heh, heh, yep.  It's almost as if these guys don't have any automated testing at all.  I imagine testing a video game can be a PITA, but it has to be possible.
---
Yeah that fixes the double sided walls. But not floating walls to enclose lets say a extractor or create a fence.
---
So you just traded all your money for 5 magic beans basicly.
---
Thanks doing the research and letting everyone know, but a quick look at the loot table would have prevented you being robbed!
---
not everyone builds or likes it. 
---
I don't use double walls or whatever is making you cry so i don't give a frak
---
I’m just mad about this hunters auto launcher she gave me.  Maybe she could have an assistant.  We kill her friend.
---
I am upset about the change limitation too. Im curious to see if they patched my trick for moving wire thru walls. (Its not well known and im keeping it that way lol)
---
Just what we needed. Steam is down, and more score points down the drain. LoL
---
Lots of folks, myself included, think we will see interior walls added in the atom shop soon.
---
Yes getting cloud error on Steam for this and Civ. I am able to open FO76 but a message box opens saying it cannot connect to my account.
---
Yeah for some reason there not showing
---
This squared.  
---
If they had just increased the point limit it would have been fine but they've turned a piece of annoyance into an Uber abortion
---
&gt;They could have at least thrown some T-60 plans in there, or some of the ones from Forbidden Knowledge that never seem to drop.
---
Uh, fuck no.  They're already worth more than 250 steel.  You can get 40 chances at a rare plan for 1 Line in the Sand for crying out loud.  May as well just skip a step and give them to everyone when the log in.
---
That's the kind of mission critical information I'm here for. 
---
Bless you.
---
It's going through maintenance, just saw it.
---
Guess what? They failed at putting it in the game.
---
They fixed my Bungalow that allowed me to Ward through it into my house.
---
Fair point. Nonetheless, foundations still cover extractor.... No? Im also a VANILLA builder but i wanted to help how i can
---
see original when i looked at it for some reason i took it as legendary enemy’s during events would be able to drop plan weapons. But im still pretty happy. Raises the chances i can actually get a decent weapon and gets more people involved in events. Maybe now we can finally get a decent team for some of the less played events.
---
Have you gotten anything above one star weapons yet?
---
Yeah why would i hoard 1000 .38 rounds??? I still have to get rid of 18 at a time when i pick them up because the options are dumb! And it made it even more time consuming bc it now lists all options and i have to figure out which options i can make and which ones are gonna be like "eRrOr YoU dOnT hAvE eNoUgH oF tHiS aMmO tYpE".
---
I'm convinced at this point Bethesda is just trolling all of us.
---
Wow, a challenge that would be an severe embarrassment to ever complete.  At most it should be limited to a 76 hour challenge along with all their other game name reference challenges, none of the challenges should be in the thousands.
---
That’s ridiculous
---
I’m trying to think of what would be the best way to protest this. 
---
Isn’t there supposed to be a contest or something from Bethesda? Submit camp photos for a chance to be featured?
---
Why not submit a bunch of camps that follow Bethesda’s rules. And don’t use any glitch’s whatsoever. And make them look absolutely terrible so they are forced to feature a bad camp. Or a “ok” that is on no way represents what people are capable of
---
Maybe a red banner signifies something? 
---
Like when the queen is at the palace they raise the flag or something like that.
---
Now I hoard that shit. That and Halloween candy for the prewar food challenge.
---
Yes, on PS4 anyway.
---
I came here to say this. The new Converter is somehow WORSE than the previous version. 
---
Why can’t we get what we all want - a simple “sell all” (of a specific type).
---
You know scrap of all kinds is endless. And steel and wood the most common. If you use the scrapper perk, and have an issue if Guns and Bullets 5, you can get sooooo much steel from weapons. Between 25-39. Go after super mutants. They always have guns that give a lot of steel.
---
Well said, all of it. Unfortunately I too am feeling myself drifting from wanting to play anymore. After finishing the legendary run, it's even worse. If Bethesda would just hire 2 or 3 people who actually play the game as consultants, and bring in some new coding talent like they did with ESO, this game still has a chance at improving. This game could/should be better managed.
---
Of all the things that could have been fixed...this was NOT a fix for passionate camp builders
---
Lmfaoo facts
---
Basically, after you select ammo class ( high, low, energy, explosive ) and convert one batch, never go forward through the given option, always hit the back button. Tab on PC, dunno what on consoles. Would guess O for PS and B for XBOX. You'll never be nested again, always one or two backs away from main menu.
---
Ok? Testing is one thing. Fixing are another. What are the truckload of new bugs? I haven’t seen much substantial.
---
Yeah, didn't mean to sound mean. Just can´t think of why someone at bethesda thought this was a good idea. thanks for the tip
---
I'd rather nickle and dime myself into poverty by spending 250/500 an item AND have the option to buy a pack with a majority of the items in there. Life is about options.
---
I've handed in two so far and only got booze.
---
Molerat gang represent!
---
I wonder if I can hang out there and trade some plans for some steel myself. I have a stack of most of those plans I can't unload for 10 caps at my vendor, I'd actually prefer the 250 steel.
---
Wait, the double doors was a bug..?
---
Assuming that the Flamer works like it did in Fallout 4(it probably does), both the barrel and nozzle modifications affect the(Flamer) projectile, but only the nozzle affects the Min/Max range stats, so the last mod applied determines the projectile being used.
---
According to data from the talk page in the Fallout 4 wiki and FO4Edit, the long barrel mod changes the projectile from ''FlamerProjectileStreamMedium'' to ''FlamerProjectileStreamLong'', my guess is that the nozzle modifications(atleast the vaporization one) also changes the ''FlamerProjectileStream'' maybe to ''Short''??, so when you apply the barrel mod after the nozzle mod the projectile gets overwritten, however in Fallout 4 the game remembered this change and didn't reset the projectile when you loaded a save.
---
This probably means that the absurdly low ''Range'' or ''Reach'' that the vaporization nozzle has is intended, which I find kinda ridiculous since it's less than melee range(for example I can hit the SBQ in the face with my Powerfist, but if I use my Flamer(vaporization nozzle) without re-applying the barrel mod first I can't even hit her)
---
Yeah. The point limit. That's it. Absolutely nothing else
---
This cubed.
---
How many people are going to spam
---
This exact same post?
---
I agree :(
---
More than that. In one move they also patched being able to run wiring through a window then changing it to a wall for better wiring, round walls,  round foundations, placing items halfway inside doorways then changing them to walls, enclosed greenhouses, and probably way more. That trick had a bunch of applications
---
Your hard earned Atom dollars at work.
---
This is really no big deal when you consider Bugthesda's track record with patches; there is a 99.99% chance that Bugthesda will use a previous build for the next update and this will be back to normal.
---
Bethesda:  Seriously, out of the myriad of bugs in this game you chose to "fix" something that affected no one, had nothing to do with duping, didn't crash or otherwise adversely affect anyone or anything.  So sad.
---
raiders be raiders 🤷‍♀️
---
Well. If they put in good stuff. Duper’s will just flood the game with it. Notice mounted heads don’t seem to be in the rewards. 
---
It sucks that there’s nothing unique to look forward to for turning them in. The vast majority of stuff I’ll be selling I guess.
---
Didnt sound mean at all i actually feel pretty taken for granted but i also have to remember. Covid is still happening and i know we use their work to escape but.... I am rambling. Hope they figure out a cool new world specifically geared toward more building/settling ECT. Who knows.
---
Notice they did this after they asked everyone to submit pictures of their cool camps???  CONSPIRACY
---
What a bunch of bullshit. Why is this not a top rated thread right now.
---
A compromise would surely be the best option.  Let the players list a top 10 most wanted camp features in a AMA or a poll.
---
Then without delay begin work on said features, giving key updates in the Inside The Vault articles.  
---
Finally post a video of Todd Howard wearing nothing but Leopard print speedos on a massive fur rug, sliding around saying "I'm sorry".
---
Because it allows them to make the patch notes look more substantial.
---
I realize that sounds asinine, but I can't see any good reason other than it's an "easy fix".
---
Hold the back button instead of pushing it 👌
---
The blueprinted munitions factory ammo generator can still be placed as well. But at least they fixed replacing walls...
---
Totally valid view and I agree itd be great if they made it voluntary, but anyone ego's played 4 or 76 knows the 'CAMP' system is a big part of the game's 'meat' and without it, its not really a full game.
---
I’ve just tried it with and without gun fu. I mis nearly all of my targets with gun fu and hit everything without using it.
---
No but if it really comes, I have a task for you.
---
Got one for Fasnacht and one for the legendary run, so I assume we will only get them for those limited events, since the case can only hold 6
---
Nah, it was the same guy just moving *really* fast.
---
*Bethesda has entered the chat* Good bug you say?
---
This only applies to doorframes.
---
They're "fixing" these things so they can sell the real thing to us later in the atom shop.  Just wait, in a couple months there will be interior walls or some such shit for 1200 atoms.
---
If we don't meet the goal, it's their fault for not making the event fun enough for players/not adding the incentive to donate.
---
Therefore they will have to give us the rewards anyway, and admit they misjudged the player base and what we want.
---
Or maybe people who have 10000000 duped junk will just do the work for us.
---
Fuck it.
---
ive heard u have to wait a full week before entering wayward again.  also every player for a week now is named "player" very helpful for me.  dont even know if im playing with my friends or not
---
I unloaded 1000 steel to give it a shot. I figured that at least I could throw one in a display case, so not a total loss. Apparently they are not display worthy items though, so that was a bummer.
---
You’re right. Guess I’m sticking to my mobile, uncreative prefab base now
---
Wait, they fixed bungalows walk thru walls/glass? Damn, I liked that bug.
---
Has anybody at Bethesda EVER played the game ?
---
Yikes
---
I generally agree with you, but since they obviously did reuse the pool with the most duped content, there is no need to participate in the "event" and no reason to get first for the scrap stash.
---
Just take a look what those BOS alcoholics give out as a reward, booze and stims.
---
If you sell the scrap to a vendor you get more caps than the shit in the "reward box" is worth.
---
I for one will be ignoring ATLAS.
---
I've only gone once and there was someone's camp with a scrap box,  right across the way. 
---
I intend to leave my tent there to help folks out if I show up and their isn't one already.
---
I think this time they actually managed to break game completely... 
---
1) Frame drop issues (heavy drop at mass events like Radiation Rumble)
---
2) Broken promises (Colossal Problem, where is it Bethesda?)
---
3) Building community angry today... (you know why)
---
List can go on and on... come on for real. 
---
As mighty Father Ted would have said:”They can’t even organize nun shooting in nun range...”
---
Steam is down, try relogging
---
So you downvote me for trying to help?
---
That's kinda crap. I really was trying to be nice. I suppose thanks for the update.
---

My friend has the same thing right now. Looking to see if anyone else has it.
---
edit: It says purchase for me too, but I'm able to launch it from the icon on my desktop. try finding the executable and launching it that way
---
It’s getting more and more obvious they don’t play the game themselves because otherwise they might realise that it’s not actually in that good of a state, it’s all well and good adding bug fixes, but if they just brought in people who grind this game day-in day-out, they might get some tips on some QoL updates that would massively improve the game
---
1000 monkeys at a 1000 keyboards.
---
Unfortunately they're all the stuffed gorillas introduced with the treasure hunter event.
---
Worse, the keyboards are the terminal that came along with Biv, only to be completely forgotten and now useless.
---
The more the merrier! I suggest you make a thread too if you're actually interested in being proactive about reverting this change.
---
“Rare plans” my fucking ass
---
It might be a skin for a preexisting structure, or under the “misc structures” tab
---
No it doesn't, whatchu talking about?
---
I used the marine tactical helmet for a while, it was decent enough
---
Honestly I think unsubbing from fallout 1st, boycotting this event and flooding all forms of media with these messages of discontent are pretty much the move. 
---
For anyone who cares about the game, force them to do better.
---
By the end i wasnt even trying to hide it. Id sit at the piano or the stage instruments and just play while browsing uhhh....reddit...
---
Can't wait to see everyone's face when they add interior walls to the Atom Shop. Does Bethesda really have the balls to do that to us?
---
Doesn't worked for me
---
Its under misc.
---
90% of the board is whining it's impossible to complete.

We've all thought about it

More help
---
Yea sorry for being out of the loop but I haven’t checked in since the update, what did they change exactly?
---
You are correct and the plans were added to the holiday gift drop pool for that reason. It was impossible to get all of the plans using only one character .

I figured someone had to test it to make sure the mined loot table was right. I am annoyed the rewards suck, not about losing the steel.
---
Exactly. People on this sub are very eager to think beth is conspiring against them. (Ofc a week from now they'll be eating anyone who dares criticize bethesda alive)
---
Step One: Open the Military Fatigues diffuse texture in Photoshop  
---
Step Two: Select faces you wish to change  
---
Step Three: Apply new texture (Whether that be a BOS symbol, a generic camo pattern off of the internet or a simple colour overlay)  
---
Step Four: Export new texture and link  
---
Step Five: Go into the CK and duplicate the military fatigues form  
---
Step Six: Reassign it's textures as the ones you just made  
---
Step Seven: Save it as a new form named 'Brotherhood of Steel Fatigues'  
---
Step Eight: Compile as a new esp and send it away for merging.
---
Yep
---
In case you didnt see https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3ug0s/camp_walldoorway_replacement_fix_workaround/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It also kills electrical wiring creativity... aka hiding wires in walls. It's still doable with SOME wall types, but breaks on brick unless you can do the now removed door to wall shift.
---
Thanks dickwads.
---
ohh been waiting for that dome but of course it's in a 1200 atom bundle
---
Given how they decided to stick with the terrible terminal interfact of the Ammo Converter, I don't see that as a meaningfull change. A good one without context... but eventually, context is for kings. Context matters. And the context is that upping a scrip/cap/gold limit by 10% would be more benefitial than upping the AmmoPoint limit to 5000%...
---
And the fanboys are defending this decision by saying: "If you don't like it, leave" (they don't really have any arguments and know that what people criticize is true)
---
Same issue with frame rate at Line in the Sand, my game actually crashed earlier because about 20 spawn on the sonic generator now, and some dude with a Tesla just killed them all and crashed my game
---
WHAT?! WHAT THE HECK! IM CANCELING MY FO 1ST SUBSCRIPTION IN PROTEST!
---
Will keep the guns and bullet tip in mind, never thought of tbh
---
Just never die
---
It really does seem like Bethesda do not care about or understand end game players. It's sad. That is where the game should shine. They have condensed late game to a tiny part of the map and continue to nerf "for the new players". Boo Bethesda. Boo.
---
I'm omly really trying for the 2x score weekend. The rest of the rewards are kinda meh anyways. I guarantee I will never wear a bos beret because i have other, better looking cosmetics.
---
Just tried. It just sends me to the Steam Store. I checked my Beth account and it’s still linked.
---
Good bye round camps. The door to wall trick is the only way to do non box wall structures.
---
I’m actually thinking of starting a trapper set. I was surprised how cool the chestpiece looks.
---
Thanks for taking the hit to verify accuracy. I was honestly hoping the posted list was a joke, no such luck apparently. Its a shame when anyone with a decent amount of time playing this game could have come up with a better reward list in an hour or so.
---
I do my best to be honest, and I try as much as seems appropriate for the situation. I don't intend to trigger people - but I tend to - it comes with being me. I'm aware there is little I can do to convince you that I am sincere. It was a token comment to be sure, but it arose from a real concern. As for honesty, if we reverse-engineer your comment, should that mean you ARE trying to trigger me? hm EDIT for clarity
---
👆🏻this
---
No!
---
Why don’t they just let you put wallpaper outside and do away with all this nonsense
---
I’ve played nuclear winter I like it but also want to pvp in adventure mode with players who want to. Do you or anybody else know if the damage cap for pvp is still 110?
---
I dont know what a pts is.
---
I don’t quite get how this is supposed to work but I’m sorry that this happened to those of you who were really into building.
---
The inevitable wha wha video games are too hard whining...
---
Everquest gives Veteran Rewards for 14 years of playtime.
---
A lot of people have them.
---
Many have over 20 years play time.
---
Does anyone at Bethesda even *glitch sounds intensify*
---
Also what perk cards did u use?
---
I have never seen that hat before, is it an atomic shop item?
---
I was getting ready to rejigger my mildly glitched base (hidden electrical, submerged fusion generator, walls covering the outside of my foundations) and now I can't. Even if a change were not going to be directly affected by the change, there's no way in hell that I'm risking my now legacy base.
---
Good job Bethesda. You literally took away the last vestige of gameplay I gave a damn about. FO1st cancelled and I'm pretty sure I won't even bother finishing the Legendary Run.
---
Hold B
---
But wait there is more!
---
When the weapon works and you are able to kill something as intended don´t go looting your enemies or you will get overweight and the shotgun will get stuck in the aiming animation until you die.
---
[https://streamable.com/693oa](https://streamable.com/693oa6)
---
Those fun building features tough, got "fix" them ASAP.
---
[This attitude amazes me.](https://imgur.com/a/1lx2Ebj) What do they have to do to arouse your ire? Have you experienced none of the bugs/been looking forward to the content drops that get delayed continuously? Did you lose any score from autocomplete? Did you use Adrenaline? Do you farm the queen and cant cripple her? I mean the list goes on man look around. 
---
Not to mention duping and unban wave, magic weapons, etc...
---
If anything, double sided walls should increase wallpaper sales lol
---
yeep, aparantly it got confirmed to be bugged (what a suprise), my bad!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i3q0rm/secret_service_deep_pocketed_mods_are_missing/g0deg7x/
---
Stop being sensible and logical.
---
And the foundations, being able to place them higher up with the use of posts opened up so many fun camp ideas, now I'm stuck with legacy camps I won't be able to change up.
---
Uh well cause its a bug and there are NO BUGS ALLOWED in god emperor todd howards Fallout 76, suck it up cheating exploiters /s
---
In all fairness, ghouls are walking corpses, not people.
---
They should just make it possible to double walls.
---
It's stupid that it needed to even be a bug when it could just be a feature.
---
The capability is obviously there, so what the fuck?
---
Hopefully they listen, but I'm not holding my breathe.
---
Yeah they will absolutely fudge these numbers.
---
Bethesda sucks
---
"Oh we have plenty of these, it's the principle".
---
I couldn't have said it better. After learning there were no new drops from the event and that Bethesda "fixed" the end game build that I've been planning out for weeks, I didn't even feel like playing. All game companies are about making money - everyone knows that - but most try and produce a fun game in exchange. Bethesda is all about the number of logins and hours played and doesn't even pretend to be creating anything remotely "fun".  I mean, did anyone working on the settler rep quests or today's fiasco of an event really think they'd be *fun*? Or were they just working to management specs and stretching out the grind?
---
I feel sorry for the devs and designers who have to work on this mess of a game.
---
Had mule characters for storage and had friends help you move stuff around. 😂
---
So you log onto private server alone, dump stuff with character A in a train station suitcase, log out, click private server with character B, and your loot should still be there within the 5 minutes or so? That's pretty great.
---
I guess I always assumed if you were solo on a fallout1st private server, the world was immediately wiped when you quit out 🤷‍♂️
---
Hold B in and you'll back all the way out.
---
I had that, too. After this update, I was finally able to remove them. You might want to try now.
---
I can generate 10k steel in 20 minutes.  The rewards are, if anything, too good.
---
Cork though...
---
It also makes no sense why they would piss off the people that going to be spending a ton on atoms. Besides a year of 1st each I don't even want to guess at the amount of money my wife and I have thrown at them for little trinkets and cutesies to decorate our camps. 
---
We're not even the worst about it. I have seen some camps where people have spent a lot more than us. Why, in a game that pushes these microtransactions so hard, would they go out of their way to anger the people buying them?
---
I guess people are buying atoms for the legendary run now so us builders can fuck right off.
---
I’m not sure if you’re joking but that feels exactly like something Bethesda would do. Create a whole bunch of BOS stuff and then instead of implementing into an event throws it in a atomic shop bundle for 5000 atoms and all you want is one thing.
---
I’m not entirely 100% on what changed but a quick example. Have you ever ran power through a doorway? You’d place a window, run the wire, then switch to a door. EZ. Well that’s not allowed anymore. Apparently there were other things like double wallpaper walls that can’t be built now. Not entirely sure what all has changed, but it definitely wasn’t necessary or important, let alone wanted by the community, so a lot of people are confused as to why they did this
---
Yeah....What you are suggesting here is to use the ammo machine the exact same way it worked before.....before it was "improved".  Worked fine then, it was slow and you filled up on points too fast.
---
The whole point of improvements is to make things better and easier to use, not to use it the exact same way but now it shows a bunch of options you aren't even able to do without exiting to check the pip boy.  I can hold more points now, that is nice, but the interface is even worse.
---
Nah the enclave is essentially defunct in appalachia. The only "remnants" are the secret service officers, and they're all pathetic scared little worms hiding in a vault.
---
Nope, it still says “Purchase.”
---
kinda keen on getting those dense plans but the drop rate is gonna be super low.
---
It's pretty much 1lbs of dead weight
---
Is it NW that sucks or you?
---
thanks never dawned to me to hold.
---
Yeah its a bummer...
---
&gt;basically the shit you sell for a handful of caps when you wander into a train station
---
So... steel.
---
BIG ONE apparently. Game breaking!
---
7pm-3am EST and I get games in less than a minute.
---
What, did they patch the double wall trick?
---
Yeah, but obviously the sub is kinda forced. instead of thinking of something really good for subscribers without shitting on regular players they just cut off base game to sell it as a sub privilege. I don't have much problem with buying the sub from time to time but I know a lot of players who do.
---
Just implement Tesla towers and boom you no longer even need wires.
---
I just throw them at random things. Useless.
---
Yes. There will be a new raider gang called Corkies. They want all the corks.
---
It's a setting under (I think display or game) called show player names.
---
Can we talk about the ability to change a doorway into a wall? This trick helped my camp a lot.
---
*Nuclear Launch Detected has entered the chat*  
---
I can has bombs?
---
Upvote for your last statement.
---
It wasnt on purpose seems it was just another bug attached to the fix they did, which I am glad they ficed btw. Just good al Bugthesda
---
awesome.  i love you!
---
Make sure you drop your holotapes and notes, because those *do* cause server strain.
