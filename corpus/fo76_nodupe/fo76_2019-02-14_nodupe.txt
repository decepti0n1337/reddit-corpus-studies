Exactly

I feel like at level 157 I should be able to one shot most enemy's and be able to put a good chunk of damage into the SBQ health bar. I mean when we first started enemy's that were 50 levels higher then us would completely demolish us I don't get why we can't don't the same
---
You get it from the Power Up events. Try doing each one once if it glitches out.
---
Sounds like they are going to do away with anything they don't like in one sweeping delete all TSE maybe the only thing I ever made crafted was ammo. Don't be surprised if an item you got grinding is gone. An item on console had to be ligit be for it was duped.
---
Maybe they are just searching for characters that got hundreds of weapons, and other duped items. Maybe it won't affect the rest of us that only have 1 or 2 good weapons from trading, etc. 
---
It can be, just don't go crazy at first, because it will bite you in the ass.  You can do the game solo but taking down the scorchbeast queen is usually a team job. Get a used copy from GameStop, play it for a few days, and if you don't like it, return it.
---
Hardly ever processes, I'd say a wasted perk if I didn't only have it in my card stack when crafting, just seems annoying.
---
&gt;Tell your Bethesda co workers were smarter than this
---

---
Only once? You have high luck stats. Its happwned to me at least 4 times. Most likely more. It happened twice yesterday at the federal disposal site.
---
Probably not where are yoy located I had to move after enough ppl saw my base near harpers as I could never load my base in for awhile.
---
I thought Fallout 3, New Vegas, and Skyrim were fairly decent to be honest. But Fallout 4... That's where I think it started to go downhill.
---
I've successfully completed the event a number of times without getting this plan.
---
What new ones?  I thought all the ones we see are results of the experiments?
---
Yet you all still pre-ordered this game, and unnecessarily spent an extra $40 than people who waited two weeks. 
---
 
---
# easy come, easy go
---
I'm just ecstatic they aren't shutting the game down after all this silence.
---
New Vegas was game-breakingly buggy at launch.  
---
So they going to roll back the nerfs then since all the bad evil dupe items are going bye bye?
---
The part only affecting a few accounts is laughable I see ppl running all the time with tse weapons.
---
I'd lmao if everyone got on tomorrow and they had no weapons. 
---
Happens to everyone at some point I want to say but admitting it was very responsible of you OP, *upvotes*,  UF however does have one item that I know of that will be Max level if it drops.
---
Enter, The Ripper.
---
The Ripper only has a Max Lv. Of 40 so technically  you can get a Max level item, it's just a very niche one :)
---
Executioner, furious, instigating, I believe these are good weapon legendary perks, hunting rifles, combat rifles, handmade, for the guns
---
Oof, I use all of those perks. My character's probably going to turn to dust Thanos snap style. Mr Howard I don't feel so good.
---
Something about very asshole 
---
Yea, I was afraid to sell loads of bulks of junk that I farm, because I would imagine players would kind of look at the numbers that do not exceed three digits but still call Duper lol.
---
Not much of a scare, but I always thought of this when thinking of vendoring junk to other players.
---
I'm not convinced they will even remove them, will be very interesting to see tomorrow.
---
Revenge is honestly the dumbest shit. 
---
That's actually my personal thought on it. I have no doubt the TSE shotgun and .50 cal I traded for were duped (I got it in a deal that was too good to be true), but I haven't used either since the nerf. Unspecced melee is more powerful than them, and when I use melee perks it's a straight slaughterfest. The guns haven't been taken out of the stash since. :shrug:
---
I collect mine via the SBQ event.  I'm into the teens on all fluxes. Getting close to stash limit, was gonna sell to vendor. If your on PC, I can pass some your way.  
---
If everyone built correctly all you need is All Rise and simple 1* Gatling guns - she’s done for.
---
I've done it over 100x. Never over level 40.
---
All items for every person will be deleted and unrecoverable.  Or all items doe every person were accidentally duped. Lol
---
Everquest back in the day (ya I’m old) had a test on the PVP servers where you could choose to spawn as a random mob. 
---
Was really fun if you got something good. Not so much if you spawned as a level 1 snake.  
---
Because level beyond 50 only exists to allow perk cards to be gathered to complete builds.
---
Making yourself or allowing players that level of power renders the entire game and any updates for it pointless when you can breeze though it.
---
Hold on to your butts.
---
sure but if this is your breaking point, then that's rather disingenuous.
---
overpriced dlc.
---
Easy fix.  Set up your CAMP near the stream that runs N to S. Have plenty of Radaway/Rad X. SPAM the collect option in the stream and you can get it far faster WITHOUT that pump. I have tons of boiled and purified water doing this.
---
This game is like a seriously deformed rad scorpion. Time to out it down.
---
Yes, because any Fallout fan knows that the game never ever ever has a sense of humour or embraced the weird.
---
Watch as they only remove TSE legit or not and they leave all the melees alone because "Only TSE were duped"
---
lolk.
---
Yeah, except there are people who swear that there are other items he should be carrying. 
---
I have a feeling they are wiping some weapons/armors right out of the game on a temporary basis..specifically the the handmade, sentinel armor, quad pump... Prob some others as well. 
---
They said if you got a duped item thru trade you may lose it.
---
To be fair, this will most likely help everyone and reset the economy a bit. The grand majority of players skipped the mid tier of the game AKA  mix matched legendaries and went straight into the top tier right off lvl 50. With the rollback maybe we’ll start seeing people sell items that are decent, stuff that doesn’t have to be perfect since we all still have TSE even though nerfed. Spend all those caps you can’t find anything to use on and circulate the market.
---
Hey we all want to get fucked on valentine's day right?
---
Of course, all Bethesda games from my knowledge are, but atleast games from before had decent storylines, and didn't scrap the dialogue for more basic shit. Fallout 4 just made it be "Yes, Yes, No, Sarcastic", but with Fallout 76, they just got rid of everything. No choices, no jack shit. You have to follow the main questline in one specific way.
---
PC. I've tried 20 odd times, I'm pretty much giving up and doing other things.
---
Everything in the Atom Shop should be unique and made from scratch not ported from another game. 
---
Kinda piggybacking on this: it would be great if we could reclaim our dropped junk even if the contents list isn't loading. For example, in a nuke zone where it takes minutes for loot to load, some people squat over other people's dropped junk while it takes the time to load, preventing the owner from ever reclaiming it.
---
Over by Grafton, I found the acid and phosphate but I couldn't find the aluminium site
---
You think they figured it out. I mean, it's Bethesda. Chances are they'll fuck this up and in a big way. 
---
Do you have a link to that info or are you just joking ;)
---
Made by juicehead then reported by every news website then reported by youngyea then Bethesda will release a statement and juicehead will mane another video saying hevwas wrong but what's he supposed to do not believe his fans
---
They ban dupers. From what I heard, they can tell who had what guns at what time so if you somehow got 200 of the same gun all within like 5 minutes, good chance you're a duper. This might be wrong so dont hold me to it
---
Well that's a whole different criticism, and honestly I can't argue with it.
---
spoiler, it was.  But I wouldn't worry.  It's just as likely all your inventory disappears.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Servers log each item drop and trade. If you have 15 rifles but a server log only showing 1. Then you are targeted.  Also having 100. Bobble heads is unrealistic. 
---
I still haven't got a 2se - haven't got explosive on anything, so I haven't been effected.  I'm happy with my furious lever action :)
---
yeah..usually i can get my loot back in less than 20 seconds i zip to the bag..so i guess i am kind of lucky..im scared of a disconnect after doing a trade
---
What’s happening ? 
---
TSE wasnt the only thing duped but lets watch as all the melee and armors stay in the game
---
You are making completely unrealistic expectations. How can you expect a developer to keep track of all reddit market transactions and refund the exact amount so no one gets their feelings hurt? Yeah fuckin right dude. 
---
Sort of how I felt when I realized treasure maps weren't "Treasure Map: Location" but rather the reverse. So, they aren't sorted together in the list. :/ 
---
Not a bug just somone else's camp is already spawned to close to yours.
---
yes, been asking for it since before they polluted  the entire economy.  The lateness of this move is part of the problem.
---
I have no sympathy if they duped that kind of stuff not one ounce.
---
It's no different than buying it from Fallout 76 Reddit users with caps. That's where I just bought my Instigating Lever action from this past weekend. I guess we'll see if it was a duped item tomorrow.
---
Anti Armor is pretty solid as well.
---
Bethesda games are kind of shit now. 
---
they deleting all duped items tomorrow. When I say all, I mean everything that was duped. 
---
Spit out my drink, beautiful execution. Almost as beautiful as 76's execution.
---
eh laws don't matter  inside a game with virtual good when we don't even own the game itself.
---
But yeah they have no idea.
---
OK thank you for clarifying that for me. I haven't done the event in a while but I still have an assassin's 50 Cal machine gun at level 50 from that event and I remember it distinctly dropping. I haven't lost my mind completely yet it appears!
---
If you want a game that you can put hundreds of hrs into then you should give Warframe and ESO a try. 
---
they are just gonna search thru all inventories..and then try to find the original source..if the original source was a duper..they will eliminate all of the additional items
---
most of us post the tse nerf wont be affected. 
---
Oh Jesus Christ 
---
Bruh, I’ll admit it, I have a shit ton of duped shit. Got it from a duper, does that disappear?
---
my camp is about 20m away from generally the edge of Whitesprings nuke zones. I too like to live dangerously. 
---
 progress only appears to reset. Just head to the glassed caverns and hit the last transponder thing. Also, taggerty is a woman. 
---
Ok he had his tantrum. Let’s not reply more than this. He’ll scream and cry and then fall asleep if we just ignore him.
---
Sad thing is their support doesn't seem to have the ability to "restore" items... So people would just be screwed.
---
You are correct.
---
Apparently thats what they said.
---
I think its safe to say that probably all tse items we got are dupped mate. But what's more troubling is that majority of AAE,FE,BE,EE are dupped as well. Not hard to guess, you just need one glance on market offers and you can find same god roll weapon on 5 different traders.
---
don't cry over the tse nerf  man, it was a more  generous than other mmo devs have done to overpowered items.
---
Plasma rifle?
---
Over 10k what? On the Xbox find a group page you can get a TSE or basically any legendary weapon you want for 2-5k caps. Power armor sets might go to 10k if you get it kitted out 
---
Fuckkk lol
---
Welp there goes all my tse weapons smh lol
---
I expect nothing less than to wake up and see my entire stash empty because of some mistake Bethesda made.
---
Give into the hate....
---
Tbh I agree in some ways but jumping to conclusions that your going to be hit when no one knows how this is gonna work exactly is a bit much I myself am partly worried but it is what it is at this point.
---
Nah, I'm gonna blame Bethesda for taking so long to fix this, widely being quiet on the issue, nerfing the majority of duped weapons into the ground as a "fix", then springing this randomly on a player base that the vast majority of people who just did a trade without being involved in the duping have no idea is coming and will wake up/log in tomorrow to find the work they put in grinding caps to buy from a player via the game's internal means are getting fucked with no compensation because of bethesda's own inability to fix their problems or communicate their plans to said player. 
---
Same here 
---
I don’t feel hurt when Bethesda makes bad decisions. That’s bad business. I don’t feel hurt when google does something bad. Maybe if we were like a Gillette ad things would be different. I’ve looked at your post history and you consistently defend Bethesda without logic or considering other players. You can downvote me, but my opinions are shared by lots of people. People who keep this game going that I suggest you stop ignoring and try to work with to make the game better.  If I took all your weapons and armor and was like sorry dude it was not acquired legitimately, even though to your best of knowledge it was, how would you react? Put yourself in someone else’s shoes for just a moment and stop being a selfish and foolish Bethesda defender. 
---
Ah yes. The all important opinion of the most important player base segment. People who don't or haven't played the game, yet still know if it's good or not based on the opinions of a sub that represents a sliver of the player base. A sub that is also chock full of people who don't or haven't played the game.

Also edit out ur confession. Bethesda has a new sheriff in town. Don't let them see that lol
---
Yours still gonna have weapons, unless you only rely on getting weapons off of dupers.
---
This is excellent. 
---
Interesting. I'm like 99.9% certain that I bought a duped shotgun. When I bought it (from a vendor, legal and above board!) the vendor had an inventory of 4 identical shotguns (explosive combat). So I bought one. I'll be interesting to see if it vanishes following the maintenance. 
---
Psst Awol Armanents, upto lvl 50 loot, but only 1 forsure 3* mob but always check West-Tek after, if its a super mutties spawn there is generally another 3* through the double doors.
---
Unless every single item that drops has a unique ID, they can't.
---
I wouldn't worry about it if you know you got them legitimately.
---
Why did you even get duped items
---
It is sad though, that this game has had even one wave of this, THIS early in its life. 
---
Far as I'm concerned, I'd take a full wipe and give them a standing ovation if it fixed the economy and fucked over the dupers and anyone who bought from them.
---
lmao 
---
Thats dumb. This is overall a great thing and it doesnt fuckin matter if it took as long as it did. Its happening now, stop bitching. 
---
Me neither and i loved my tse’s
---
I was thinking the same thing. I got tired of grinding White Springs for 1-2 star garbage so I went to the subs and got my weapon for a large amount of caps. I guess we'll see tomorrow.
---
Programming is rough man. Especially if you didnt program in a is this duped meta data. I'd guess they pit a lot of resources on this project alone for a while. 
---
I would be very surprised if this effects weapons that go all the way back to beta, it was likely they added a way to track a few patches ago (just before the tse nerf) and this is what will be effected.
---
Don’t seek revenge, leave squad if they are.
---
Amen.
---
id say the same thing about this game
---
You’re legitimately the first person I’ve heard excited for that game. It’s going to flop so badly. You know they’ve only been working on it for a year right?
---
they are nerfing like crazy tho
---
FO4 has had user-added tags since shortly after release.  They had to be done because BGS did the same thing with FO4.
---
But, for some reason, BGS *refuses* to look at what modders are doing - even though it would give them incredible insight into how players actually play their game.
---
Instead they think that a display that shows 10 items at a time max is good enough to throw 200 items into.
---
Based on player replies xbox has most server problems while PC seems to have most game crashes. 
---
I wonder if there is just a problem with game cache. I know on ps3 because of sony's wonderful  architecture skyrim and FO would reach a point that it crashed frequently.  And deleting game and rebuilding data base would fix the problem.
---
No offense, but you just compared the start of early fallouts to the end of FO76 (explosive bullets Et Al). 
---
That being said, the start of 76 isn’t exactly *hard*, but you don’t have nearly the resource income or the damage output of late game. Bullets are precious and rads can be a concern. 
---
A couple questions to help you, not cast judgement. You said you are a shotgunner and got overwhelmed in Harper's Ferry? Do you have the enforcer perk? If not, max it out STAT. Then always aim for the legs. I can solo the Whitespring golf club in a nuke zone. I leave a trail of crawling glowing ones in my wake.  I'm at lvl 81 and my build is pretty crappy and I'm very squishy outside my power armor. Enforcer saves me. At your level you shouldn't be afraid to go anywhere on the map, even if your build sucks.  Good luck!
---
I think every single gu wen has a unique code and everytime there are two guns with the same codes in the game will be deleted
---
HowToBasic needs to do a video on putting a fo76 video into a console.
---
Exactly they started working on it after far cry 5, so that means it’s a game that took less than a year to make 
---
I feel legit bad for people like you if it is duped. You had no way of knowing :(
---
I mean if you paid 200 caps... no harm no foul. That's a sign I think.
---
But if it's not tse you should be fine. 
---
&gt; Nah, i blame Bethesda. This shit should have been on lockdown the moment it was found, not weeks after the items have been in circulation being passed around via trades. 
---
This is like blaming someone who was robbed for not keeping all the doors closed and locked and not the thieves for robbing the place. 
---
Sure, BGS bear some responsibility but the blame for the duping falls squarely on the players that did the duping, self-evidently so. 
---
BGS is rectifying the situation. They don't deserve a gold medal and parade for resolving the issue but they don't deserve blame for the duping either.
---
This will be interesting 
---
You either have a duping friend or you bought the duped items with real money if you dont have a duping friend you sir are a dumbass and have justice has been served #make76agreatfalloutgame 
---
I LOL'd at my cubicle
---
didn't even notice the a 
---
They don't even have to be in the exact same location. Mine was blocked recently and the offending CAMP was a good distance away. 
---
I really hope this doesn't affect anything that I snagged from one of the vendors as there is nothing I can do to tell where it came from.  Then again, I haven't played the game in weeks and don't plan to any time soon so I don't really care.
---
Judgement day - smash all them dupes!
---
Wtf are you on about? 
---
awww are your ill gotton goods being deleted? GOOD! You may not have duped them but I am sure you know who did then accepted the item from them. 
---
like this game flopped too?
---
Now that, that's just like you're opinion, man.
---
Lmaooo damn
---
Yes just like this game 
---
A new scapegoat.
---
Take that silver dear sir!
---
Can’t help you if reading isn’t one of your abilities.
---
Just curious but where is your base?
---
All my tse's are fucking useless anyway might as well at this point lmao
---
It's almost like you didn't read the first sentence of OP's post
---
Maybe they will buffed the legendaries drop rate after this removal.
---
It seems like I'm the only person here who never purchased a duped item lol
---
Man it was crazy. I used a pooopy combat knife like level 1. My trigger finger never moved that fast unless I'm in pvp.
---
Literal ocean of bots lol
---
I see your point, and I agree with it, though, a lot of people have an opinion that recent Bethesda games have been, indeed, shit.
---
Satire is always the best medicine. 
---
I wonder what Bethesda will break during this. My guess is something that people love.
---
If they were rectifying the situation, it would have been done weeks ago, when the duping started. When we were told they “don’t have the tools to track duped gear” but now they do?
---
No, this is Bethesda taking a stance and making changes, because people were making money off the game. If they were truly doing this for our benefit this would have been done a little bit ago, not now after the items have been in circulation for a period of time.
---
Oh no!   They are going to take all my ivory handle mods I duped!  XD
---
Way too late, sorry.  
---
Your game, your mess.
---
This is great. On the other hand, I fully expect some percentage of legit items to be removed on accident and never corrected, but I hope this is not the case.
---
It will also be upsetting if any of the Legendaries purchased from a Vendor turn out to be duplicate items and legitimate players aren't refunded the caps they spent on these items they had no way to know were not on the up and up.
---
My question is why don’t they do this before it got so out of hand? Or a better question is does this mean they intend to make legendary enemies drop guaranteed legendary loot? Or let us craft and find more ammo to deal with endgame enemies? As much as I love this game I’m getting tired of seeing broad nerfs that punish everyone and no buffs that could fix the reason for the exploits anyways.
---
I wanted this game to get better, but I’m finding it harder and harder to keep that hope.
---
Do or don't lock, either way my experience is destruction by other players.  At least by locking them I feel that I've passively effected them.
---
lol
---
All my tse's are fucking useless anyway so might as well at this point lol
---
the sweat pouring off his neckbeard will be epic as he stares at the enter key.
---
It may be a great bluff in hopes anyone who has stockpiles will dump them, I'm holding 500lbs of top end weapons on one mule and 400lbs of armor on a different, not a crazy number and most are singles do have a few common weapons that have more than one of.  I'm sure there will be a fire sale going on tonight at the Oversere's camp and fault 76. doggie bags everywhere.
---
Honestly never would have expected that thread I started to turn into this.
---
At least I got my answer, lol.
---
It's definitely not a 2 shot. Single shot but it does have an explosive effect that I personally could live without. I've been mindlessly grinding White Springs for almost a month and the closest I got was an Exterminator's Lever Action
---
Could you say it really grinds your... loose gears?
---
So wether or not you knew if the gun you bought was duped, you still lose both your gun and the caps you spent on it. Bethesda does nothing but fuck their community in the mouth.
---
What confession 
---
They can do whatever they want, nothings gonna bring me back to this game...
---
That's right. And they did more to make the players experience better than any patch Bethesda released.
---
The other trick I use in conjunction with this that almost certainly will get patched out soon: you can put water pumps on top of campfires. Sometimes it takes spamming the button to make it avoid the "item is floating" message but this actually works.
---
Kicking the dupers killed the community. Lotta ppl don’t bother logging into 76 because “so and so got banned so why bother?”
---
I get that stuff needs to be done but if I come back to no weapons, I’m just gonna uninstall.
---
I’m sure a lot of my inventory was duped but I got it offa Xbox LFG posts  
---
Lol
---
Always take free info with a grain of salt. People's memories aren't always perfect. They could be remembering back from before the patch. Or you are just really unlucky and everyone is buying what you want before you get there. Or the RNG cards are really stacked against you. I can find the Protectron vendor almost every play session and he NEVER has any of the rare outfits for me. Not once. It sucks but it happens. 
---
Are you looking at any of the new lists that people are making in Google Docs for what each vendor carries? There were like 3 posted today.
---
For some reason my voice chat has never worked and I have no idea why :/
---
yeah my low level alts went to whitespring early too but i think level 7 lol..i also had my level 5 short hunting rifle that i got from summersville
---
I don't exactly think a second shot is fired, more, just, there being a damage increase to the shot that is fired.
---
'Pipboy as diegetic interface' has to be one of the worst ideas in the series.  It could work for a PC game maybe - but the size constraints for text for use with a console/tv means there's too much wasted screen space and what's left can't display much.
---
It also works for windows
---
No one asked for your help guy. 
---
If they leave all the duped melee weapons but remove the TSE there is going to be a riot.
---
Quit lying. We all know you are one of the most notorious dupers out there!
---
Have you tried all the Nuke Plants? 
---
Sounds like op needs their nappy changed
---
76 Bad
---
Both World of Warcraft and Elder Scrolls Online have a Public Test Realm. ESO has character templates to increase level progression speed and all items / plans are in containers in your starting inventory so that you can test changes quickly without having to 'farm'. You can also copy your characters to the PTR, but obviously cant copy anything back to the regular realm. 
---
https://lettersfromtamriel.wordpress.com/2018/03/07/esos-play-test-server-pts-what-how-why/
---
I'm not sure how WOW works with that as I haven't used it in forever.
---
With character templates, or having a vendor near the starting area that sells _everything_ users could quickly test changes in the PTR.
---
*your *because
---
Bethesda encourages people to trade with other players.
---
Bethesda then punishes players for not knowing the exact origin of an item they purchased.  
---
Conclusion: Blizzard has no fucking clue what the hell they are doing.
---
As a man once told me PRAISE THE SUN!!!!!!!
---
uh,  dude, you aren't serious. 2k caps ain't shit, and you should have known it was a risk when you bought it.
---
Exactly, most people fail to understand this - we, as the player are being punished.
---
A lot of people have a lot of opinions.  That's cool by me
---
I had seen a lot of people say that's the worste place to farm those. They loot table puts that loot super low. You gotta server hop / jump to places with a possible legendary interaction, like sigur grove or (I think it's a steakhouse with supemutants, forget the name.)
---
Because duped items are the largest problem rn and they need a lot of their team to find a solution and execute it
---
damn! thats about what i was expecting, but a crazy amount of effort none the less. your time and work is not going unnoticed to say the least. 
---
that black wall you see is the base of my scope while im using the right click to zoom. it is hard to tell whats going on, so l link the video i took to get this screenshot. 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I6fdqkHSaiA
---
also, thanks for saying that. i see your posts and ive asked myself how i can help, so i decided to try and replicate the bug to get these results. 
---
30-40
---
I 100% agree with you. What they did to this game severely disappointed me. It’s sad that there is going to be more lost players tomorrow. 
---
Do you know what pvp I want in this game? None. Bring back single player. This experiment failed.
---
I didn't say anything bad about it. I also don't have an opinion on it. I do plan on still playing I'm just not in a huge rush. I'm happy replaying the old ones. I'll get to it. But there's no need to be a condescending prick. 
---
The dev team is full of melee builds. They dont want to make any updates or bug fixes until they have finalized stick-fight 76
---
the kinds of weapons that were dupes were well known. there's no excuse. no one is innocent here.
---
Why would someone buy a weapon and never use it?
---
Cool.
---
RageQuits now starting! ;)
---
I don't destroy. I just look, and take water. And maybe shoot turrets if they shoot at me, in self defense.
---
We are the public.
---
These are servers.
---
They’re running tests post patch.
---
So technically we already have public test servers ;)
---
Did I just mumble? Yes, I've successfully completed the powering up events a number of times, at least twice per plant, without seeing these plans.
---
I’ll gotten goods? You moron. How about the fact that someone can buy a gun from another player for caps and not know if it’s duped. Seriously get Todd’s dick out of your ass.
---
I'm not speaking in regards to tse weapons exclusively here, there are a multitude of factors that lacked clear calculations on the part of the developers tse aside. Did you know if you take a base gauss rifle and apply prime capacitor mod it infact does less damage than if you applied perforating capacitors with regards to the SBQ. 
---
How? How could i have possibly known it was a duplicate weapon, and not a legit farmed one that the seller didn’t understand how to value said item?
---
You can’t honestly sit there and play judge/jury on what’s legit and what isn’t.
---
You forgot the /s tag....
---
Yeah... except the caps are already spent by a LOT of players via player trading on weapons there is no way to tell if duped or not from our end. Players whom are innocent (and the vast majority of players of any games do /not/ pay attention to forums or reddit) are gonna wake up, have a bunch of their gear gone, caps gone, and the dupers are gonna be still sitting on multiple characters with max caps while the unaware are out their caps and punished.
---
Like... everything you said would have been true after the first week of duping, not 3 months later.
---
The Bethesda Valentines Day Massacre 
---
It only game. Why you hef to be mad
---
Why remove the items but not ban the players?  
---
These players are going to be trusted to have "learned their lesson" and won't exploit future bugs?!?
---
you are actually obligated to pay attention to places like this when you want to engage in the multiplayer aspects like trading.
---
Get out!
---
What?
---
sounds about right, ill play new dawn mindlessly like i played this game. its just a time killer anyway. who cares if these games are good or not, i just find it funny that bethesda is literally removing stuff from players inventories, after they already nerfed them, right before the release of two other post-apocalyptic shooters. too many diehard fans are defending these rash actions, claiming that bethesda is doing it for long term stability and they are catering the game to the loyalists, but losing more players does NOT bode well for longevity of their game as a service. the price of keeping the servers active vs how little they will get from atom store purchases (because of less players) is going to reach a breaking point and this game will eventually be shelved, if it hasn't already. but hey, ban those dupers lmao
---
Sure, pictures always help! There's a standard red firefighter helmet on top of a little gravestone in the Ash Heap, northern hilly bits I believe, near mining equipment. It's not lootable, but just like the Owl Mask found in Helvetia, I'm willing to bet it'll be obtainable later. I just hope it's not Atom Shop exclusive.
---
Glad all my items are my own or within my own closed community that is dupe-free. :) 
---
Because not everyone can go through the forgotten realm into the mind of the seller, rewind time and see through the portal how the seller acquired the gun in the first place.
---
Until this thread I thought Excess Adhesive and Adhesive were 2 completely different things.  
---
Do you have push to talk off? I had it on for a while and couldn't understand why people couldn't hear me
---
Good point. Go try hooked on phonics. Surely that should increase your ability to communicate. Look I'm not gonna waste my time any further. There are tons of posts in your history where you argue with people with no substance behind it about fo76. In fact you are what all the posts that complain about people illogically defending bethesda are about. I suggest you do some soul searching.   Since I won't be any different from the rest of your history, let's refer to my original point. You will be playing alone if you don't understand how dev decisions impact the greater player base. 
---
Guess what...I'd rather the dupers were driven off first, if given a choice.
---
You weren’t being sarcastic?  
---
...because duped items are one of the biggest long standing bugs in the game. Sounds like you have a lot of duped items. Maybe you should check out the posts/comments about it here. Nobody is pissed about it except the guilty. 
---
Well I mean 3 star TSE weapons from a guy who has a lot of them is already sort of red flaggish doesn't it?
---
The knee that replace the THOUSANDS that have been wiped out thanks to the former residents of vault 76.
---
Uh, utilizing a core game feature is not a bad decision- there are several other ways to fix the economy without most of the punishment falling on the casual player.
---
Lol no
---
lol i kind of saw that coming 
---
The way it was meant. I've seen the SBQ be killed in like five seconds. I think this will be good
---
I know what's dumb to buy without assuming dupe: cheap weapons with godly legendary combinations.
---
Yeah or maybe he just sold you one gun from his inventory. And he didn’t have 6,66669 of that same weapon already in there
---
I haven't been able to find an answer on this. I'd like to know too. I am playing right now and it seems like I seeked vengeance on this guy, then he fast traveled and now it seems like he's not hostile anymore.
---
If we ban everyone who just happens to have a duped item, a lot of innocent people will be banned. 
---
Really,duped items are the biggest problem? Not server stability,a broken loot system a broken crafting system etc, but dupes. I dont see people complaing about dupes when the SBQ shows up.
---
LOL! 
---
How would the dupers be fucked over, they got their caps or their dollars. The only people being fucked over  are the buyers
---
eh, doesn't say anything about banning people, so I bet most all will hold tight and hope.
---
[removed]
---
People who have actually spent hundreds of hours playing the game from the start and made friends and traded and bought items obviously have a shitton of duped items. Casual nooby idiots aren't going to keep this game afloat buying their princess beds and pink armor skins.
---
__You forgot the /s tag....__
---
It might not be the same gun but having 10 TSE weapons (even if they arent the same) would be enough for me to avoid
---
Because it's how professional online games are developed?
---
I think we all need to get a lot of pop corn, to fully enjoy the incoming whines ;)
---
[It's Ultracite.](/spoiler)
---
Because they don't actually have a way to tell which items have really been duped or not, let alone track them across multiple players.
---
At least no way that the community will be convinced actually exists.
---
So when they remove the items there will be a massive flux of people posting about how they got their legitimately acquired items taken and there'll be *just enough doubt* that a majority of the community will take them seriously, further damaging the studio's reputation.
---
What if i place items into your junk bag? Will it say someone has dropped loot into your bag? 
---
Yeah, because it was just pure luck that the seller had another 20 guns with exactly the same legendary effects as the one you bought,
---
Yeah. Duped are the largest problem
---
Def aren't the least evil. CD Project is much better of a company than Bethesda.
---
Yeah it’s totally impossible to get 10 TSE guns in the game /s
---
My assumption is they will remove frivolous items such as 1* nocturnal pipe wrench under the guise of "dupe". Basically they are going to fuck up, like they have done since launch, one thing fixed breaks a multitude of other things not broken pre patch, and they are going to remove things no one would ever consider duping let alone using in a practical sense. 
---
kind of your fault for buying game items for real money lmao
---
AWOL Armaments and Scorched Earth are the only two events with a guaranteed level 50+ legendary boss spawning. 
---
I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm just saying that it should make you cautious
---
Mmmm, that's some tasty salt.
---
The amount of people upset they will lose stuff and who have been asking for this to happen are amazing 
---
Can you imagine that someone doesn’t carry all of the guns on his person all at once? 
---
Im going to enjoy seeing all the items at vendors tonight. Than quitting tomorrow.
---
Never pick up guns that guys in clown suits throw away - they've guaranteed been used in a brutal murder.
---
Poor little fella. You sound like you could use a nap.
---
Well this will be interesting, instead of doing something when it was extremely rampant they waited. It would have been easier/ nicer to just suspend the game for a bit while they made fixes.  
---
Just going  say screw you greater good people. As mentioned above not everyone reads reddit or gaming articles.
---
Awww, someone’s salty.  How about you communicate like a normal person and not a giant cunt?  
---
See.  Edit.  You are not reading the post.  I don't need to scrap my lovingly crafted camp and move it because I found a better way.  How you think scrapping and rebuilding everything and relocating to a stream is a better solution to the problem confuses me.
---
Same happened to me, best I can figure is my water purifiers bugged out and disappeared which some how prevented my camp from being placed for 14 or 15 straight logins. Only cure was to burn it down and start over. 
---
Good on you for owning up to it, and thanks for the info!
---
They can do whatever they want because I don't have any duped items, just the ones I picked up whilst legitimately playing the game
---
Yeah, because someone can’t get RNG on their side and find a legitimate weapon right? (Even though the first version if it found wasn’t duped in the first place) but by your logic it must be duped because it’s a god roll, right? 
---
You’re so stupid it’s unreal. 2k caps cheap? Multiple reasons it could be cheap. Maybe he was rich from the cap exploit and doesn’t need alot?
---
Maybe he doesn’t understand the values of certain effects?
---
Maybe he doesn’t like shotguns?
---
Maybe people don’t check reddit and buy in-game unaware that there was even a duplication glitch?
---
An awful lot of assumptions there pal.
---
As much as I loved playing Prey, I hated the ending so badly that it has no replay value for me. I normally get at least 2 playthroughs on any game, but I couldn't manage it with Prey.
---
Still got my value for money though. The first time through was great. Right up until the end. 
---
Yeah, at level 200, ive basically acquired every anti armor or bloodied heavy weapon in the game. People say im a duper but its not my fault so many people sell heavy weapons to vendors. My arms are literal bears. 
---
Cheers! Do you remember where we learn about this information by chance? 
---
Yeah someone that uses “Awwwwww” over and over again and screams “GOOD!!” In all caps at other players is definitely not a salty fuck who blames all his deaths on duped guns
---
Pretty likely he didn't have all the facts I guess.  
---
I also wonder what happened to his tweets in general. He kind of went silent after the game came out and before he was so active.
---
You need 3 chill
---
I've been trading my balls off since day 1 of this game.  I don't dupe, I don't have friends that dupe, but how the F am I supposed to mind read everyone I traded with AND the person they traded with AND the person they traded with.
---
If I show up tomorrow and find half my shit missing, they're going to think the TSE nerf outrage was a small blip on the radar.  I worked my ASS off to get what I have now.  500+ trades over 3 months.
---
But hey, f'ing over players with super nerfs, adding pointless grind, and deleting player items...........I guess that's a good substitute for CONTENT.  Honestly it feels like there's 1 idiot at a PC doing ALL of this, and nobody is supervising them.
---
Sure, keep fanboying it up.  I'll be laughing my ass off several months later when the rest of you are pissed and threatening to quit because they keep throwing their customers under the bus for no apparent logical reason.
---
This game has longstanding issues known since beta.   They don’t have time to fix them.  But they have time to forensically analyze item instances and item provenance and then create removal scripts?    
---
As for my inventory, I assume that everything I got on the secondary market was duped.   Which means I will finally have room in my stash for once!
---
I wonder if I cross the same guy. He threw me, and explosive shotgun, and the light machine gun.
---
This is 25 years after the bombs, long before FEV escaped Mariposa and even longer before the Institute developed their own strain of FEV to make a new species of genderless mutants with.  They shouldn't even be in the game, and a simple cure to FEV would undermine Fallout 1.
---
I think I saw that at the Brotherhood bot in Watoga
---
The fact mlst duping methids are fixed 
---
Seeing as there was and still no way for people who didnt buy their gear on ebay..but instead traded caps for it via the in game trade method.What happens if those people purchased duped gear without knowing it (not talking about tse) Are those caps just gone along with the gear? if that happens...your going to have a hard time keeping people in this game. Your basically punishing them for something you failed to address early on
---
your fingerprints better not be on that sweetroll son or you're gonna have a bad time!
---
Not even close to everything is in the timestamps he lays out
---
Your first sentence confuses me. Those who did not use a third party trade board are the most likely to be innocent in this regard. The majority of the player base isn't the recurring couple thousand people you see posting on Reddit.
---
Are you equipping the Hard Bargain perk? I have too much stuff to sell because I get so many caps from meds, chems, armor and weapons. Even though I hope between 4 vendors (still haven't discovered Watoga yet), I still max out all the caps from the vendors. 
---
Valentines Day Duper Massacre! 
---
I used to go to Sugar Grove but that got nerfed long ago. You'll be lucky if you get a 1 star now a days. I used to farm West-Tek (and still do occasionally) but not only are the mutants bullet sponges but every other server hop will be no legendaries at all. So basically you waisted tons of bullets for nothing. I also tried Watoga with some decent success when it comes to finding 3 stars but it's a slow process and just like White Springs you find loads of legendary items none of which are for your build. If you think about it that's a few hundred thousand variations of legendary loot so the chances of me finding my Instigating Lever Action is pretty slim. That's why I just threw up my hands and headed to the subs.
---
I've always wondered how to get blood out of my clown suit.
---
the fact that your so resigned to the fact that you will lose items means deep down you know you bought duped items, and probably had an inkling at the time. 
---
This smacks of "How was I supposed to know my fully modded x-01 armor i bought for 1k caps was duped?!?1?" Ill tell you how, think about it for one second. 
---
This happens if your Charisma or ranks of Hard Bargain/Grape Mentats change between the point where you chose to sell it and confirmed the sale. I've had this happen to me if Grape Mentats run out right before I confirm the sale.
---
Handmade starts at 15 too, right? As far as I can see it's a flaf upgrade, I presume the OP doesn't know about it. Then again .45 ammo is abundant and 5.56mm isn't, 2mm is even rarer still, so who knows!
---
And you just know every single one of them is going to be the same story - "I've never traded with a single other player in my 89000+ hours of this game, my TSE Combat Shotgun was totally legitimate!"
---
Raise your hand if you remember getting the E.T. video game and being disappointed after the first hour of play. ;-)
---
&gt; Yeah, because someone can’t get RNG on their side and find a legitimate weapon right? 
---
didn't read the rest.
---
People who find the best stuff keep it or trade it for other stuff just as good. I'm sorry you are having a hard time with this, but it's just really simple.
---
Ah, my bad. It's been years since I've watched an episode. Thank you sir! I've always thought that song was hilarious though.
---
I forgot all about Greg. I'll get him on the list of places to hit next time I'm on. 
---
I'm definitely going to be losing a few items when this rolls around.
---
but you know what? that's fine. I knowingly bought duped shit. this is like, in real life, you got caught buying drugs off of someone, got caught, and went to jail.
---
well obviously it's not your fault, the cops should just take the drugs from you and give you your money back, right?
---
Valentines Day Duper Massacre!
---
See now my question isnt the worry about losing a TSE. What about the level 35 gun or 10 cans of dog food off a vendor?
---
Didn’t think you would, stupidity tends to have no response to logic. &gt; end thread.
---
Ooh hey that's a neat idea. Wiping the slate clean before they introduce a bunch of new stuffs.
---
I think you found the one accuracy of guns in the entire game. Wait till you find the classic left handed bolt actions and notice all the revolvers are single action only.
---
dupers' buttholes
---
As a married man atleast Bethesda will fuck me. 
---
In honesty the caps i spent on different weapons will be lost. And im sure gonna be pissed. Likely be the nail in my coffin going forward. Sad. Spent my caps how i wanted and now this. 
---
Duped or not. 
---
I paid and paid and paid. Now i get to go back to harsh language and guerilla tactics? Weak
---
I don't know if thats a good analogy. Think of it more like you receive a paycheck for hard work. It gets deposited, then half gets taken away because it was counterfeit. Is that your fault? No. It is fair? No. People were not aware they were buying duplicated items. 
---
if you bought anything with more than one legendary effect that was decent, there's a chance it was duped.
---
Is Bethesada their south american branch? Are you you're in the right sub?
---
This is for Fallout 76.
---
This would have been been a good announcement around Xmas time. Stop the duping and erase their shit.
---
Now it's too late. Whatever items are out there have circulated too much and it's just going to negatively affect those who are innocent and still playing. 
---
that should have been done before this imo.
---
I was really hoping they would replace all duped items with pre war money 
---
honestly id be down for a hard reset. just means i get to level up with my friends and community again. 
---
Yea, I totally forgot about Greg. He's been added to the list of places I still need to hit. The "roving" vendors I'll get when I stumble across them. I'm not going to lose too much sleep over tracking them down. 
---
I have duped items I say if you have over 10 items they should be deleted
---
I'm really just being aware of how it impacts the community. Lets say just one of my unyielding pieces turned out to be dupped. That is still a relatively big deal. I shouldn't be punished for participating in the economy or meta. 
---
And then your ash pile will bug out and I won't be able to loot it.
---
you missed where I already got the last word.
---
The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is today.
---
There's been progress, sure. But it seems that really each step ahead comes with a step back too. I was honestly really looking to some of the fixes in the last patch, like plans being marked as known and also being consistently available at vendors. Except I find now they all have insane prices that are going to take weeks of grinding to get.   
---
Asking us to do surveys or whatever is nice, and acknowledging issues here and in forums is nice, but it's not just lip service we need. What we definitely are \*not\* seeing is any real feedback from them, especially on the long-promised road map for the game's future. They are listening to us but really aren't saying anything back, and that's kind of the core of the problem.  
---
At this point it's pretty troubling that they don't have enough of a plan for the future of the game to commit to anything with their players. The only slightly optimistic sign is the number of job openings at Bethesda Austin. But even then, all those roles will take months to fill. The backlog of work is clearly much bigger than what they can deal with in a reasonable time with their current staff.
---
This seems silly. So because there’s a “wave of duping” no one should be allowed to buy a TSE? But you certainly shouldn’t have your item taken because it’s not quite as good?
---
Bethesda’s job should be to fix duping glitches and (arguably) ban dupers, not to punish people unfortunate enough to trade for duped gear.
---
It shouldn’t be up to some 14 year old kid to run fuxking background checks on every account he wants to trade with.
---
Meh, 90% of the time I clear my rads with a decontamination arch. There are a few available and once you have access to the Enclave bunker you can clear them without having to clear any enemies first.
---
I did the right thing and swallowed my laziness and fixed it.
---
I know. I understand that he was specifying some details before but you'd think that the head of marketing would be a little more active on their biggest game. 
---
I said one thing, and that one thing was to you.  You should get your facts straight.
---
I found a buncha shit in a suitcase at white springs railroad. Hell yes i took it all. And spent 3 in game days tryin to get my weight back down to 600 lol.
---
This game is d.o.n.e.. We are all moving on. All Bethesda does is nerf and take from players and Ignore the game breaking mess they released for 60 dollars. At this point it’s like they’re purposefully trying to drive people away so they have an excuse to shit the servers down. This might just be the biggest gaming disaster of the last 10 years 
---
Yeh, that's about the best one you get over lvl 50. Crazy there's not more like it!
---
lol!!....
---
Disgaea (1) blew my mind when it came out. It's the reason I love turn based rpgs.
---
"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
---
Please don’t. Buy a game that IS good if you’re going to spend time on it.
---
Sadly most of the players base has already been driven off. 3 months in and only 30% of accounts have made it to level 25 on ps4. That's a pretty telling number as it's very easy to hit to level 25
---
yeah the left handed thing is weird being right handed myself the left handed hunting rifle is kind of visually awkward and weird lol. I mean speaking of I wonder why there is no such thing as a springfield M1903 in this game?
---
No need to be rude, just asking. Might have to put a ticket in Beth’a furnace I mean complaints.
---
I think you will recover from losing your dog food... but really you bought dog food?
---
I want a AAE rifle...... honestly its why I havn't traded anything for weapons I kind of suspected something like this might happen I hope your weapons fine 
---
You missed the point where you’re a nobody on the internet.
---
bethesda is too big to go after individuals via patch but they'll target specific super rare item across the board that shouldn't have existed in such numbers.  it also means innocent people will get hit w/ collateral dmg.  tomorrow we are going to see many angry people whom claim their TSE is legit.  honestly i bought my lvl35 TSE handmade but who knows, i dont think dupers bothered with low level ones but who knows, its possible.  i wouldnt rage quit if i get hit w/ this change if it improves the community.
---
I just want a server hop button tbh
---
Shit posting is the #1 way to get Bethesda to talk.
---
This is gonna be bad lmao
---
A mobile game did this a while back. DayR. It deleted all stored items without notice or warning. And basically just said deal with it. I stopped playing that too. 
---
Oh sorry I assumed you were the original person that screamed GOOD at the other guy. Seeing as you all talk like real housewives of New Jersey and say things like “Awwww sweetie”
---
Don't tell me how to live haha
---
launching a nuke is not that hard if you know what you are doing. you can hack terminals to make the turrets target the robots and then shut down the turrets. If you have Green thumb perk you can pick double and get a ton of flux from a single nuke
---
I've had it on since it came out cause I hate to have a hotmic (I like to listen to music and also don't like the idea of it transmitting unintentionally even if I'm not.)  My push to talk key has worked like 2 times but I also can't hear anything other people say anyway so I'm not sure they're even related.  I just chalked it up to fallout76 being the way it be.
---
82 levels and the only two-shot I've seen was a harpoon gun 20 pounds over my weight 
---
I would blow my remaining 3500 atoms on a wild skin like theirs for the handmade. I feel... Incomplete!
---
Cannot *wait* to bathe in salty duper tears
---
Subreddits are the real end game...
---
I'd be down for a hard reset too, but only if it fixes the game. I don't want to have to start over again all for nothing. I've spent countless hours in this game.
---
literally laughing out loud now
---
With the exception of the m79 nothing is really 100% based on a real-world gun.
---
Yeah about 700 hours in myself. Lets hope this is the best dupe purge we've ever seen. 
---
Nah man there's FORTNITE
---
I got curious and decided to check out the location and... There was no ones base there. I was able to place my CAMP and have been rebuilding the best I can
---
Fine in that case there’s a game called metal gear survive you should check out 
---
Bug: serendipity perk doesn't work when in power armour
---
well, dupers are still a thing and they now dupe in a more discrete way. Let them just rip off the band aid and let's get it over with.
---
Well, turn it off. I could go for some hot mic music
---
SPOILER ALERT: The duper still wins.
---
Why?
---
Cuz the biggest "hurt" caused by this won't be to the dupers, but to the innocent players whom had no idea this was an issue and spent their hard earned caps aquired by paltry daily vendor trading on weapons they won't have anymore...
---
...while the dupers sit on multiple characters at max caps limit, ready to buy up everything they need/want while the legit players are kneecapped for having bought a thing there was no way they could have known for sure wasn't legitimate.
---
In the end, dupers still win, while the regular grind players taking advantage of the in-game system get hurt and put at a massive disadvantage for something they didn't have a part in.
---
Son I just reran the Mayors Office and not one stimpack.  Did I misunderstand?   And have completed Mayor for a Day. 
---
This is what I've been to explain to a teammate of mine, to no avail.   This is also why I said anyone coming  to the event with  a two- shot explosive shotgun  at level 100 is  just being  a dick. The event offers nothing to a character over level 50.  If such a person shows up at the event, he's only doing so to fuck it up for those level 40 and below.
---
That's actually not a bad idea. 
---
I bought a tse shotgun from a rando outside the bunker for 1500 caps. It is currently sitting in my stash. I put it there because it made it too fucking easy to do everything. I could oneshot a lvl 91 deathclaw if all the pellets hit. Just wasnt fun. Now, instead of doing 700 ish dmg per shot, it does 189. I cant kill a lvl 15 supermutant with it, i dont care if they take it. 
---
I feel like this is a master race thing.  The ps4 crowd has been nothing but supportive and chill.  
---
Same here with the weapons. But oh well, I stopped playing the game months ago. Out of curiosity I'll check out how many of them got deleted to ensure that I'll never buy anything Bethesda publish. May God bless all the active Fo76 players.
---
Oh did no one tell you, the TSE's are absolutely useless.
---
Oh the tears will run like rivers.  It will be 10x worse than the nerf wailing.  :)
---
It’s duped. Question is, is it duped enough to be flagged...
---
Nah little kids love that shit. They had a live marshmello concert in the game and 10 year olds were legitimately losing their shit. It really is a special experience for them. You could say it’s their “club penguin”
---
Watch them delete everything but duped items.  I hope not but as of late you never know. 
---
people are already going with "but i bought it legit!" statement already in this post.  PEOPLE WAKE UP!  if you buy legit an illegal item, you aren't innocent.  you may or may not be punished but you certainly won't get your hard earned cash back either.  
---
I think you have reading comprehension issues.  They aren't deleting types of items from the game, they are removing instances of obviously duped items.
---
Like, one star nocturnal pipe wrenches won't cease to be, but a stack of 10,000 bobbleheads will be deleted.
---
^ this
---
Lol I guess so
---
LoL
---
Because I think minor FEV infection is what enables all of the other infections. 
---
Let me play Devil's advocate here for a minute. I've got support ticket responses that say Bethesda can't fix inadvertently vanished inventory items because their system doesn't support that level of player file editing. How do we know they *won't* screw something up they can't fix?
---
Players dont have to pay for dupers and bethesda error, we all grinded for caps just to buy a gun and we dont have any way to know if a guns is dupe or not, so months played for nothing, theres no cry, is reality, just shitty patch after another and they dont care of losing people, (and we keep collecting bug stacks)
---
My guess since fixing the duping method the mule accounts with a billion items have had likely been marked and the items in their inventory most likely had their id numbers changed to basically making them a virtual dye pack 
---
I think the "Grafton" tab should be renamed "Grafton Station" the "Grafton" vendor is in the town, they sell excavator PA items and other items that are duplicates at the station.
---
also FYI if you fast travel to the grafton vendor, it places you further away than fast travelling to the station... they are really close to the same spawn point for both locations.
---
The Single Action Army appears to be based on a Colt .44-40 which is pretty accurate in reality to how it functions in the game.
---
If they do, and people buy them, they are idiots. Imagine you drop ten bucks on a weapon and it's removed tomorrow.  Haha. Deserved.  
---
So?

if youre so sure that 90% of items you have are duped, youre just as complicit in the problem as a duper and deserve to have your items deleted, in my opinion. Take a look at the legalese higher in the thread, by your own admission you were aware you were buying illicit property and thus have no leg to stand on. 
---
If you want to risk it, go to Whitespring Golf Club and hang out by the guarded entrances. Enemies will show up and the bots will handle them. All you have to do is pop a few shots in to be a part of the kill. 
---
*WARNING* Don’t shoot the bots or they’ll come for you next. 
---
Because you know every guilty person will be on here proclaiming their innocence. 
---
I've seen a few mods over my time but not that many. You can get a few plans but those ones are  NV scopes. I have a whole bunch of radiums if there's on you're after and I can pit all the mods for you. Just yell!
---
Nah man, FORTNITE is for little kids, **MINECRAFT HUNGER GAMES** is where it's at.
---
I’m going to eat the evidence.   
---
It's funny because the last couple of times juicehead has made a video Bethesda had already responded like 5 hours before the video was posted 
---
It's funny how credible what you just said was. Those Xbox players are sweating
---
Yep. So tomorrow i'm gonna lose the handmade i currently use and bought ,and i'm pretty sure they're gonna wipe a lot of other stuff just because every patch  brings doom.
---
I don't know how much shit i can still swallow bethesda.

I hate Todd so much right now, I would legitimately not even kiss him if I saw him. He would only get a hug
---
It's gonna be a Valentine's Day Massacre.
---
Why would they be coming back ?
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
I'm interested to see if their system works. Personally, I purchased my weapons, but I don't know I'd they're legit or not. I didn't waste a ton of caps (would've given them caps for nothing anyways) but if their databases give the items a new id number upon sales or trade, it would make those that spent thousands of caps feel better that they didn't get raped. 
---
Anyway, just wondering if there's any way they will follow up with players in bad situations like that. I know that one of my friends made a trade today that seemed really good, and I am wondering if it was after the newest update. 
---
For that, I think they could at least try to make up for the loss, if possible. 
---
194, have had a few Explosive guns, a few Two Shots, never had them together. Not that it's impossible, but I can already envision all of the front page posts about people losing their guns when no one can verify their innocence. 
---
Nope that wouldn't work, The FEV in WestTek Research is neutralized so we wouldn't be able to infect ourselves with the vats. The drinking water around Huntersville could work though
---
I wanted to be Comfy... during what turned out to be the last minute of my life...
---
Hahaha that would be awesome! 
---
Nothing. I'm ready for the purge. I have 0 regrets. If I have duplicates, I'll be fine to part with them. I have so many items that I don't even care anymore. 
---
Everyone is sweating except for PS4 players who are getting ready to watch the world burn for other consoles lol
---
My mind mostly.  
---
I love it already. Soooo many people claiming they're innocent and if they bought duped stuff it's just because they didn't know it's duped... 
---
If anything, deleting all duped items reassured me that bethesda actually cares about the game and i'm really happy to see this happening.
---
Look at their track record, have they ever fixed one thing in the game and not broken something else? That is my concern, again if they do exactly what they claim they are going to do and nothing else negative arises I will be overcome with joy.
---
Ikr! In a game where its all about the grind and we only get a few options.
---
Demo expert perk nerf needs to be reverted.
---
They went too far with that one
---
Dying wasn't part of my plan. I thought I was just outside the red circle on the map so I would be ok... I found out I was wrong. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** Buy-furious! ^(hug)
---
I know the purge is very good and am glad it's happening, just crossing my fingers almost none, or none of my items are duped, but unlikely.
---
Just more paint jobs really. I'd like plain green, red, blue, or black armor. Other than that, a clean Mistress of Mystery outfit would be nice.
---
*I just lost 500 TSE Automatic Handmades that I swear I didn't dupe! I'm done with this game!*
---
What is happening?
---
Come join us on filthycasuals if you arent subbed already.
---
That would suck if you didn't die and that happened, get stuck in a suit of Power armor that's led shielded...

From a FO76 community on FB.

---
Those are exactly the reasons why I thought of it and why I framed it as pvp similar to if someone picked the lock on a supply drop. Only become wanted to that specific player
---
You know the seemingly infinite amount of posts by people complaining about that may have tipped me off.  But it was more in reference to the fact that they were among the most notoriously duped items.
---
May I ask, what is happening tomorrow? I may be out of the loop.
---
the next update is gonna delete what seems to be all duped items from everyone's inventories
---
Chally the moo moo is my favorite character in all the the fallout series. Also, Happy Cake Day!
---
It's hard to know whether or not an item has been duped. The most we can do is hope that it isn't.
---
I wonder if the dupe "check" will extend to caps procured through consuming duped nukas and the likes. can you imagine being the guy who has to play FO76 to the 7600 hour "challenge" just to clear his debt to Bethesda?
---
Similar experience.... I used to accept randoms all the time to help them fast travel around the map for free. Had a few bad camp smashing and annoying things happen and it just is too much of a stressful bother.
---
yeah, ima be pissed if my worst item, the sent assasin trapper arm is duped
---
The dupers ruined the economy you participated in, yet you have no ire towards them. Are they not the ones to blame for the entire issue? If it werent for the dupers, you wouldnt have bought duped items, and wouldnt have your duped items deleted. 
---
As much as i dont like fortnite i do love how they keep people engaged in the game and that concert and having events that they update daily to show progress is a great way to give its base a treat regularly. If i was a kid id be playing that too.
---
I am rather worried about my tse lever action rifle I got in a trade now tbh.... If it goes it goes...if it stays..bonus lol
---
Go on ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
---
I imagine the big dupe violators were banned during the big ban wave that happened a bit ago.
---
&gt; So because there’s a “wave of duping” no one should be allowed to buy a TSE? But you certainly shouldn’t have your item taken because it’s not quite as good? 
---
I didn't say either of those two things. You made them up.
---
Because there was a wave of duping, everyone ought to have known that if they were buying a TSE, it might be duped, and hence, might disappear.
---
And the point of my anecdote was that I knew my very-much-*NOT*\-as-good non-TS exploding ammo combat rifle *might be* duped, and if it disappears tomorrow, I will not complain.
---
Now, if my exploding armor-piercing handmade, which I looted with my own two \[virtual\] hands, disappears tomorrow, I'll be very, very angry.
---
Ever pick up scrap from a bounty or grenades out of a case? It's not just weapons that were duped. If one small mistake was made poof. Imagine if they accidentally erased every screw out of every inventory. Or how about ballistic fiber.
---
Well I mean, that's not exactly unique to me, is it?
---
Buying anything from another player while duping is as rampant as it has been is basically willfully ignorance. It's a shame the economy was so crippled off the bat? But hopefully your stuff wasn't duped and if it was that you find a new weapon ASAP.  :)
---
Since the update you either have to wait a few minutes before you try again, or you have to completely turn off the game. Otherwise it throws you in the same server again.
---
So if you were doing it repeatedly, all you were doing was hopping in and out of the same server.
---
I'd like to point out that they didn't say they were stopping any duping methods just taking the stuff you traded for so not only are you out your caps (money in the cases of the idiots who paid real hard cash) and traded items but now the items that you got in return and the duped item (some of which I'm sure people don't know were duped) are gone and the dupers will just do it again. So beware that any item you trade for could be taken. How does this help the player economy?
---
A couple nights ago someone I know found a bag that had a ton of flux in it.  They waited for half an hour for someone to come and claim it.  I think that's more than long enough to wait.  Sorry someone didn't extend the same courtesy to you.
---
My level 7 character lost all his junk to a couple of jackasses exploiting a supply drop notification bug in conjunction with a user (me) that didn't realize that a locked supply drop meant that it wasn't for you.  The map showed the quest marker for me.  I had a quest on the list that said I needed to pick it up.  I assumed that I just needed to unlock and take it.  The same moment the lockpick finished, I was dead.  Those douchenozzles took the junk and proceeded to wait there for other people to come and take it.  I left my alt hanging out in the area for about 10 minutes while I watched them.  I booted up my other computer, loaded my primary character and proceeded to fast travel / sneak in with my chameleon armor and take pot shots at them from several vantage points in the area.  It was a level 7 and a level \~107 person so of course I just kept nailing the level 7 in the head / face with my suppressed handmade.   Took them about 10-15 minutes to eventually find me because I got too close to them and took some shots, so I disconnected and and left them as unsatisfied as I was that they would target low level players like that right next to flatwoods.  
---
I wasn't mad about the level 7's junk that I lost... nothing special in it, but I was mad that they were attacking people that were likely new to the game.  I can understand how mad I'd be if I lost a sack full of unstable flux.   That should just be listed as aid all the time.  It sucks that it isn't.
---
where is everybody getting the news that duped items are being deleted tomorrow? 
---
I think there is too much room for people who may have received a duped item through legitimate means, to lose out. 
---
There are active player marketplaces that you can trade/swap/buy items without knowing where they came from.
---
That being said, I'm sure the massive amounts of TSE and bloodied weapons, and the legions of players wearing sentinal and unyielding sets needs to be adjusted. 
---
Well, I've been playing fallout and far cry for a long time now. Never was a fan of metal gear, which is why I won't buy that game. I fell for fallout 76 just because of my history with the franchise, that's why I gave it a shot. Had fun for a month, expect the same thing with far cry new dawn. $40 isn't expensive at all compared to $60 for this shit storm we're all talking about...
---
Yeah they actually patched it a while ago but then with the latest patch, some of the bugs were reintroduced into the game. So yah like sometimes I’ll pick up a flower and it will remove six bullets of ammo I’m carrying 
---
There’s items on ebay too. Which is nuts itself 
---
You certainly do or you wouldn't have posted. One shouldn't try to silence others. Everyone is entitled to say what they want and where they want even you. ;-)
---
There is a lot in this message.
---
There aren't any. A friend and I tried to see if you would have any "jet effects" or anything that distorted the screen. If I remember right, I didn't even take any damage. Maybe very minimal damage.
---
Of course they will. Everything they do they screw something up, but they really can't use that as an excuse NOT to do things.
---
Beautiful. The hanging vines giving extra privacy is a bonus too! 
---
Let's hope this Dev wasn't dumped the night before and wants to share the heartbreak. 
---
THIS. I was just about to comment this sure as hell has gotta be a bug cuz the same thing was happening to me last week. I could place my camp in the same spot every single time too. Ended up just placing my camp again and rebuilding. Ugh. 
---
I get it all the time but i think its a visual glitch, i dont think you actually lose the ammo. I think its the amount of bullets from your last reload or how many are missing from your mag.
---
I bought them with caps, not with real money. And even if I were to use real money for it, you can't randomly delete items from player inventories like they are doing, it's beyond moronic. 
---
Didn’t state it was, again with the assumptions? Tut tut someone’s full of himself.
---
thanks! that’s definitely one of my favorite parts!
---
Shhh... the kid's probably just a blind fan... no need to bring him/her down with some truth bombs... 
---
They can suck it up. It’ll be shitty, sure, but maybe losing a non-genuine god-tier weapon will make the game somewhat challenging again. 
---
I've worked hard to trade I hope none of my weapons are duped, or its gonna put a nail in the coffin for me :(
---
unfortunately, this is true. Not sure what good can come from this wipe at this point, besides potentially screwing over innocent players. 
---
On a completely unrelated note, caps are suddenly valuable again
---
Best case scenario. Worst case scenario we lose much more 
---
bethesada (in-joke for those tracking all these various posts)
---
I'm down for a reset, cause I'm sure they are going to ignore small time dupers and only target large duping batches.
---
I feel the pain, I just recently wanted to try my first TSE, a Gatling Laser, it's good fun but not endgame. 100% it will be gone and that's fine with me (10,000 caps spent be damned if that'll ruin my fun though).
---
Wow you’re toxic if this is really how you get your pleasure now 
---
That would be kinda cool, actually.  
---
So that's everyone who traded an item...
---
Suddenly very glad I sold that TSE handmade I got from a trade before I took a break from this game. The only top tier guns I have now are ones I found myself
---
I hope it stays.  Personally I don't have anything from a player outside of my team with the exceptions of people dropping weapons a nuke zones.  I don't trade at all.  But its really unfortunate that people who had no intention of interacting with dupers will potentially be affected.
---
You knew it was possible what you were buying wasn't legit.
---
My friends and I have never bought anything.
---
Feels good man.
---
I hope you’re right.
---
What do you mean?
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language=en
---
i think the game is just fine as is.  lets say i was a nina and i took your loot.  did i truely do something wrong?  i could be a good guy and leave it be but taking it isnt evil either(hey i didnt kill you).  be thankful game warned you , your bag is gone instead of you wasting time searching.  me being an evil ninja, im going to grab your stuff (which is now mine) and i'll sneak away.  DONE.  kind of unreasonable to expect all your junk to have built in GPS and lojack lol
---
And triple check their pull requests and branches!
---
I saw two TSE machine guns once at a vendor. They were absolutely identical right down to the durability. I hoped out on buying them because I knew it would bite me in the ass down the road. But you know someone did.
---
Massive quicksells now for people to get any kind of profits from things they know or are certain are duped
---
Prices go up either immediately after the maintenance or a few days after when valuable items actually become rare again. Caps will no longer just be something to wipe your ass with
---
Just a realist, if u ever traded for a item it was a dupe.
---
Is this the indiscriminate removal of dupes? are the poor saps who bought duped items getting yanked? also is it possible to have bought i duped item from a vender with out knowing? lol... this is gonna be fun.
---
Ah ah ah, you didn't say the magic word!
---
Beth is going to take all the guns from peoples inventories that they think were duped. Even if the person didn’t duke the gun himself but just bought one unknowingly 
---
if they're 2 star you got decent chances they may not be, 3 stars I'm worried about, I believe my farming weapon was found by my friend so that should remain.
---
If youre on PS4, add me. HarveyOsbourne. I have more screws than I know what to do with. I can cut you a better deal than those VendorBots.
---
But there would be a penalty or a gain for both people. The player that took the bag has a chance to get extra loot. The player that got their bag taken has a chance to get their stuff back and then some. OR The player that got their bag taken can keep getting killed and keep losing caps. I've only seen one negative downside to it that someone mentioned. The rest is, in my opinion cowards scared that their name is going to pop on someone's screen when they took a bag. 
---
You have not lost ammo. The only bug is that this debug message is not supposed to show up on your screen, but the messages fall through whenever you pick up flora.
---
Just read the link from Bethesda, I’m fine with duped items being removed as long as my legitimately obtained ones don’t suffer because of it.
---
I do an don’t, like if people want to leave, by all means leave. Don’t repeatedly bang on about it and mention other games on this sub, this is a fallout sub, we aren’t here for Anthem so why mention it here, to get at Bethesda? Do you actually think they’re gonna listen to one guys ultimatum? 
---
They are, it's just a visual thing.
---
&gt;When an item is duped, the serial number is copied letter for letter, number for number. 
---
Nope.  Creation doesn't work that way.  Each item is created from a BaseID and is given a unique RefID.  Two items with the same RefID will share location data also - meaning x,y,z coordinates.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019
---
They'll remove all duped items, and ofc that people complain about it.
---
If bethesda does nothing -&gt; people complain.
---
If bethesda does something -&gt; people complain.
---
Well it seems that PS4 players are the players who usually don't have problems with the game
---
Doesn't matter to me, it's just a game. I don't know what's legit, so idgaf take whatever. I didn't spend any real money on items, so what do i care. 
---
It truly is a mess. I’m actually gonna stop playing for at least a 6 months. Hopefully, the game is more stable by then. Lol
---
Not scared, but questioning some items I bought in some trades whether they are just going to disappear or stay.
---
My tse lever action rifle, is it duped or is it not..... only time will tell... weapon roulette lol 
---
I'm gonna lose the tse handmade. Everyone has it. I only bought a piece of armor that shouldn't be duped( not best roll).
---
My guts tell me i'm gonna find myself with half inventory ,just because the algoritm thinks high level grinders are dupers.
---
Honestly the only things I'd really be upset about would be my vampire's gatling laser, quad tesla gun, and 3* quad handmade. The rest of it can get swallowed up by the endless abyss of incompetent coding
---
I guess it's the principle I have an issue with. Who knows, a hard wipe might work for the game 
---
Well this isn’t a problem or a glitch.  This is a legitimate thing Bethesda is going to do to the whole community.
---
The good news is that's its ammo you have already used. Fire six shots, a  couple of minutes later pick up a flower  and you'll get pop up saying   "6 ammo removed". Basically a mechanic that happens in the background that should not be displayed. 
---
 As Deemsleep says, it was patched, then mistakenly unpatched, hopefully patched again tomorrow.
---
I'm guessing it's going to be a simple wipe of commonly duped items. Anti armor,exploding, 90 pct weight reduce shotguns......things like that.  I would bet all items on that are leveled and commonly duped will be gone. Regardless of whether they are legit or not.
---
I think that's the case with the handmade. Ammo is hard to find sure but the 2mm is just lead and steel so it's pretty easy to make, especially with ammosmith
---
Did they ever fix the artillery dupe? I haven't been on this sub in a while but last I checked it was still here despite being reported during the beta
---
thanks. it really be KO for people who dupe. lucky for me, i sell weapons gotten the LEGIT way!!
---
As a pc player, I wholeheartedly disagree. I haven't played as much as a majority of people on here but ive never duped or received dupes so i have nothing to worry about personally. The fact that they are doing something about the dupes and all tgat mean the game is still very much alive. It will only be dead once they no longer care.
---
There is a whole sub (not this one) of people enjoying this game.
---
Finally somebody with sense who sees the bigger picture.  No if the whiny children in here could understand these simple facts this place would be a lot more civil. 
---
I do. I only have one star. Think I might up it. 
---
I have all the shotgunners, skeet shooter, enforcer, I forget what else. - I was also doing it not in power armor and they bum rushed me by the vendor. 
---
Won’t make that mistake again. 
---
I guess it is. They will be removing all duped items from the game.
---
Wow, someone’s defensive. Neither did I. It’s just ridiculous they’re putting so much effort into banning players when everyone’s leaving anyway. IMO it would make more sense to put that effort into DLC content as most people have already done everything there is to do 
---
Son?
---
Google --mayor's office stimpaks--   A lot of posts that mention the same thing.  I was just mentioning to inform newer players.  
---
Perhaps another vault dweller had just recently looted the safe before you got up there.   That happens all the time all over the map.
---
Okay, one company is less evil than Bethesda. One has to ask though, how long can it last? They're not striking an imposing figure wrt dealing with social media lynch mobs, and their top talent is getting poached. I have to wonder how long it will be before they end up dying as the hero.
---
And on Valentine's day 
---
Can't wait for the tears. This subreddit is going to be the Scott Tenemen to my Eric Cartman tomorrow. 
---
Why anyone would buy anything without knowing the source is hilarious to me.
---
It is duped haha let's be real... Everything traded on the reddit market is duped
---
The best I have is either Anti-Armor on my handmade wit Instigating on my black powder rifle 2nd.   With maxed rifleman and sneak it melts all but the spongiest of enemies.
---
People on their high horses yet they let all these dupe users kill all those glowing ones and SBQs for them. Reset everyone to 0! Its the only fair way. 
---
Why are you saying that like it's bad? What duped gear do you have?
---
I know my TSE handmade had to be duped because of how many I've seen. also I saved for weeks and when the ledgendary hunting rifles started going in trade subs I bought one for 10k since then have seen the same damn one 20 times so it will suck to lose that when I had idea it was or even could be duped when i thought they had fixed the issue. Now I have to wonder how much of the things I've traded for are duped.
---
So long, duper
---
I think that spending their efforts on making the game more fun for people who are still playing should be a higher priority, but I suppose it is a positive move. This will make a lot of people happy if done correctly, but the game will still be floundering IMO.  
---
Np. Personally i'm really glad they're doing this and i cannot wait for player  shops to be added. Now with duped items gone player shops are actually viable 
---
Not only that, but acting like I don't have 300 hours in this game.  Thanks for the tip on how to get the small purifier bro, I've been looking for it for so long 
---
I think just checking once would be an improvement
---
Which one
---
It's a different type of problem. It's not a there's a problem with the game. It's a people are mad that they are losing their items problem
---
9 months for sure
---
Just normal Ghouls, radroaches, radstaag, ect.
---
I may start playing again.  Hopefully the people that want to actually play a game come back.  And the cheaters leave.
---
Can’t compute.
---
A tip: take ss of all those important things for you, since once they disappear (by mistake) you will not be able to verify that you had them once
---
Nice try 
---
You on xbox? 
---
I've been thinking about this on and off all day, what I bet they are looking at is times that items were entered into someone's inventory. Since they'll have the playerId, weapon ID, the stats, etc, all they have to do is look for all instances of an item in someone's inventory and when the 'spawn date' was (or something similar - I'm guessing). If the spawn times are the same or within say a few microseconds, that could indicate duplication. That's how I'd check for it if something similar happened at my job.
---
Well you got hyperbole and straw man in there, I think you can do better though.
---
And the thing is that u are gonna lose ur gun but that guy is gonna keep your caps
---
Meant “So...”
---
Thanks dad thing was I got a good loot drop from the safe.  100rds of 5mm, Minigun etc.   seemed stocked.   Just didn’t have stimpacks.  Thanks for confirming.  I’ll keep at it.  
---
Lol ! Plans ?
---
That is not innocent. 
---
That's called turning a blind eye.
---
Well then... Gonna have to figure out how to farm legendaries easier now...
---
That's why I've said, multiple times the armor needs to be fixed.
---
But even in that case the heavy guns still are not worth using.
---
Because in previous games, and correctly so, the downsides were ammo consumption, weight and durability, however in return you got insane dps machines.
---
In this game, even after armor and the damage calculations are fixed, the  ammo consumption and low durability of heavy guns will remove them from the list of viable weapons unless you increase their damage.
---
No weapons rps should compete with heavy guns, it is their one saving grace.
---
The LMG should only hit for a bit less than a hunting rifle chambered in .308 as they are using the same caliber, and the LMG chews through it stupidly fast and breaks very quickly.
---
Same point, the 50 cal machine gun should hit nearly as hard as the hunting rifle in 50 cal.
---
They should hit a little list hard per shot prob 15-20% less but the DPS should be insane for all the downsides they face.
---
TL;DR even when armor is fixed heavy guns still need a large buff, and on paper DPS isn't the only thing you need to look at as these guns chew through ammo and mats for repair, and their DPS should be very high to reflect that
---
I hope they have a smart way to implement this and not just some guy speculating player's inventories and deleting lol. It would be hilarious, yet heart breaking lol.
---
Oh good to know, I had no idea it was ammo that was already spent 
---
He would only get a bug ?
---
You're making it pretty obvious that you stand to lose a lot of dupes with this update my dude. The conniption fit you're throwing alone says it all, i was just curious what you were concerned about losing
---
Loving the panic of you guys who bought your gear.
---
It was that, it autocorrected for some reason. 
---
Heh, same boat. Deep down I always knew it was.
---
Yeah Idk I have a few 2 stars but a bunch of three stars an those took me weeks to farm the caps up to buy from people selling.
---
QwQ &lt;- me panicking 
---
I’m expecting to see some removals 
---
I've probably commented five different times on how much sorting could be improved tremendously if they had some kind of meaningful naming convention, but I hadn't ever thought of the case you bring up. It's more of the same idea though. 
---
There's really no reason for them to have done it the way they did, except if they are really truly just trying to get us to sink more playtime into the game by making every single thing take as long as possible to do.
---
This sucks. Imagine those with duped items they were gifted and because they had no clue they dropped other things. So they log on with zero weapons. This is a bad decision. Anyone happy about it is wishing for the death of the playerbase.
---
Sadly, I found out about the ending about 5 hours end, and that specific type of plot is a complete deal-breaker for me. So I didnt get my moneys worth. But I still always recommend the game to people unless I know they share the same pet peeve. Prey was a well-made game.
---
/r/market76 I hope you frequent it moving forward. 
---
Shut down the servers... the internet is over folks.
---
50 caps for a duped legendary that disappears tomorrow, might be fun I guess
---
Snitches get stitches, why you asking me all these personal questions?? No I don’t smoke “marijuana” and no I don’t know where you could “score a bag”
---
Didn't trade it from the reddit market but from someone who illicited a trade in game whilst I was walking through Charleston.
---
So yeah a high pos it's duped...if its not... bonus but I ain't getting my hopes up lol
---
QwQ &lt;- me panicking
---
Im coming!!!! Give me everything!! The fishier the better! Dont tell me how you got it, i just want it.... tomorrow afternoon is going to be beautiful, let the purge begin
---
I dunno
---
How much damage does your lever action put out?
---
I would not mind a complete wipe, but i think most other players would.
---
I would care if I wasnt going to be playing Anthem in two days..  hah.
---
I'm waiting for the posts about dupers saying their duped items werent duped
---
In the single player Gamebryo engines, every item is a uniquely-identified instance of a base item so if they had been retaining logs of item creation, they would very easily know which of those unique instances had been created when and by whom, so if they identified patterns in item instantiation, they would very easily be able to trace that back to the items in whomever’s inventory they ended up in.
---
The reason there are so many “I’m quitting” and “bye” posts is because those posts are duped.
---
Ha, I doubt that the 1* cast offs I scrounged from white springs will be in danger.
---
What a shitty way to go...
---
I got a bloodied explosive hunting rifle a few days ago for a really low price, I really hope the guy who gave it to me didn’t dupe it as it’s my favorite gun right now 
---
What makes you think duping was not fixed?
---
Actually this post isn’t that toxic, lol...
---
I spent 12 dollars on that melee weapon i am quitting fallout 76 and sueing Bethesda because they haven't taken care of the ebay sellers-ebay buyer 2019
---
What if my purchased mutation serums were duped?! Will they delete me from my inventory?!
---
Yeah...that really sounds like someone hit the safe before you, and then left alternate loot.   Typically it's just stimpaks and one or two other low-quality things like pre-war money's not the safe.
---
There is literally zero chance this will be done right.
---
That's absolutely bullshit. If I farm caps for ages and buy me a weapon there might be chance it's duped. They can't punish people like that for duper's shenanigans. I thought they want to GAIN players, not lose them?
---
If this were real I would pay 50 caps on the gamble not near as much will get deleted as people think.
---
You won’t know for sure till tomorrow fwiw I have picked death claw gauntlet as a drop and sold it to vendors so there are legitimate items floating
---
It's like Bethesda knows what to give us as a gift
---
I have no sympathy for anyone who bought their gear knowing full well duplication was occurring.
---
First, they made the gun that I bought with caps completely useless when they nerfed TSE.  It would only be fitting if it now got deleted completely, because I have no idea if it's legit or not.  
---
That's what PayPal is for??? Reported
---
The tears of dupers and traders of too-good-too-be true items are going to taste sweet on the Ides.
---
yeah, if that's the official stance, I'll stand by my "no real information" stance. 
---
Bummer, it would be cool if it had you target friendlies for a short period, analogous its effect in PvE.
---
Oh damnit you got me
---
Somebody else with a working knowledge of the engine makes me steamy. Don't know how many times I've tried to explain this to people. 
---
FAITH RESTORED! Have a point.
---
Playing the game is being willfully ignorant?  GTFO...
---
How could you possibly have known? Well personally I look at the other player, do they look like they dont know the value of a gun that is talked about on every forum? I would think, hmm 2k caps isnt very much for one of the best guns in the game. Its not nothing either, probably just about the most they can get and still be an easy sale. I would think, hmm duping is super rampant these days, they may fix it one day and ill lose the item. I should probably just pass, maybe ill buy items once a fix is in place. 
---
Youre so salty that its really pretty clear you knew the item was duped and are just butthurt that it came to bite you in the ass. Then again, its only 2k caps, so who gives a shit. 
---
That seems like one of those things were you know it's technically the right thing to do, but it still sucks.
---
Because if it does 400 damage now instead of 4,000 then it's garbage.
---
They already made a lot of money, most probably most of those dupers have quit already anyway.
---
That will learn you.
---
Don't buy too good to be true shit from random players.
---
It always felt like cheating for me to buy god-tier stuff from players, especially knowing it was most likely cheated. I mostly just bought plans and mutation recipes. I believe the only weapon I still have that I got from a player is a 1* furious handmade. I have a 3* quad automatic one that I legitimately found though, so I wouldn't even be that upset if it disappeared. 20 more pounds to my stash that I wouldn't otherwise be able to get myself to clear out
---
You tested your thesis, weighed the evidence and came to a conclusion...then shared the results. You are not an idiot, you're just speaking to what you believe in. Big ups.
---
Uuuuuuuuurrrrraaannniummmm fever
---
I'm a big fan of their tequila and salsa products.
---
It's funny to see all those hypocrites whining about the deletion... 
---
We can't have player shops without removing duped items first...
---
Great game is gone. Congrats. This is going to be the final nail in the coffin. Even less playerbase. That is what you're cheering for.
---
Boo fucking hoo.
---
i have traded a lot so if i lose anything im just going to uninstall lol, they launched this game in a poor state left duping in forever. So yeah i worked hard and paid good caps that i had to grind out at the power plant. spending hours making caps so i can trade 25000 a piece of armor. If i lose my armor ill be on Apex Legends. 
---
Because it hasn't been....... Intact I know people who do it and I can explain the process if you would like.
---
Your character will be deleted then xD
---
How do you transfer workshop without leaving the server?
---
Everything in my camp is open to any and all.   Except my shitter.  A man's Throne is his castle. 
---
Break in anyway?  Fine.  Hopefully you didn't notice the nuke mines.
---
I want a pooper scooper
---
At least I'll have excavator PA 
---
just yesterday, i bought a 2* bloodied shishkabab and a 2* bloodied fire axe from watoga vendor lol. i know what u r talking about lol.
---
the freed up cap space will be the calm after the storm
---
Never bought anything period.  Someone gave me a full set of excavator PA.  Lvl20 currently and can't use it yet
---
the game is actually okay
---
Do tell
---
I agree! There are a few weapons/items that cause stuff like frenzy, but on PVP it's useless. It wouldn't be that hard to do something simple like throw a chem effect color filter over your view temporarily. I think the stringer is a really neat weapon and they've added more types of ammo/mods but it's basically pointless in 76. I just wish all of those finer details carried over in player-to-player interactions. 
---
If you do I dont seem to have it. I'll look and it up and see if I missed something like a dingus.
---
&gt; 99.999% of everything listed is duped.
---
99.999% of *really good stuff* is dupped. It's why I mainly deal in mid-tier legendaries.
---
Yeah I have a feeling I just lost my 20,000 cap TSE Handmade
---
Really? How could you like this trash? Lol jk. It really is. I enjoy playing it
---
Lol.  I’m pretty sure I’m gonna log in and all my weapons and armor will be gone.
---
Just don’t take my 1* instigating death tambo.
---
Civ5 complete for $10... 600 hrs
---
Id say thats likely true. Especially if youre talking about items with a roll chance of like 1/100,000 or whatever the TSE rate is. 
---
I wish there was a better way of doing this, since there will inevitably be innocent people caught in this as well. You can go ahead and say "they should have assumed it was duped and not bought it" but that's not a realistic expectation for anybody. Most players don't come here and I'd wager a good bit of people who trade aren't even aware that duping is an issue. Still though, this is better than nothing. I'll gladly take it
---
Very few times has someone here made me laugh, well done sir/madam!
---
Bethesda was like, its time to give the playerbase some love.
---
You're trying way too hard to be funny 
---
What about a super duper one?
---
Even better
---
i personally hope they give some caps back for those who where not marked as duping items, but traded for them above the price of 0 caps.
---
&gt;!i know its a LONG shot, but would be nice!&lt;
---
it might based on some kind of identification code of every item. 
---
I've been noticing that three stars just haven't been dropping any weapons at all. Not even drills or the other bs ones you get occasionally.
---
I could make the argument that it was never fully whacky either
---
Hahaha its good a mission either way 
---
Especially now with the dupe purge incoming... I've seen people already saying that it will be the killing blow for Fallout 76...
---
I enjoy killing and looting stuff, i love getting caps for new CAMP plans, i love building stuff, but there are also parts of the game that i really dislike, and i really do hope they'll be improved. 
---
The game is not as bad as some people say, but in it's current state it's not worth 60$ either.
---
Ok “FluffyPlops” sorry I don’t have your high brow sense of humor. A poop joke wow
---
I'd argue that since there's no negative consequence to ignoring the team invites it's just a game mechanic that adds another layer of choice in the game rather than a flaw. You can choose to play solo, but it is a multi-player game. 
---
You know there will be some asshat that claims shit got deleted from their toon that they never actually had
---
Cheers. Also you're right cheers.
---
I've had that happen to, but this isn't that. I have three ranks in Hard Bargain but nothing else and it keeps happening *every* time I sell scrap silver. 
---
I love how "everyone is death" wasnt just hand waved into existence. if you fallow the story it seems like the brotherhood of steel caused WV to be wiped clean of human life.
---
only good weapon i have that i did not trade for is a Vampire's Explosive .50 cal.. everything else i grinded for caps to obtain. time will tell if any of it was duped.. or will be ignored by the great Howard
---
Nerds that have nothing to contribute but spelling corrections are the worst, but there are so many of them lurking on Reddit that they're always upvoted 
---
bethesda pls
---
*"You can now re-buy all your stuffs back from ATOM Shop!"*
---
I don't even mind it that much, it's easy to ignore the fools if they go so far out of their way to stand out. My problem is the term "dumpster fire" completely lost all meaning after how much it has been thrown around here
---
Allmost all my weapons and armor are low/mid tier items sold at vendors. I'm fairly confident those won't disappear, but... Bethesda.
---
Personally I think that any player that gets his enjoyment from watching fellow players get upset is toxic.
---
How did you get that from what I said. 
---
What I am saying is that buying an explosive legendary weapon for thousands of caps from a stranger while you know duping exists, and then saying 'hey I didn't know mine was duped! The guy promised it wasn't! '   is being willfully ignorant. 
---
Just like how you somehow missing my point is possibly just you being willfully obtuse. 
---
I dont care if this “just works” or fails spectacularly. However why didn’t they try this before nerfing TS and TSE? If they can delete dupes and make those items as rare as they should be, they would be a rare, balanced reward.
---
This is gonna fuck something up I can't wait
---
needed for those piles of scorched beast guano at fort defiance.
---
Op is a glass half full type of guy!!
---
probably not. But a lot of people that unknowingly bought duped items are going to think they did. Loudly.
---
I bought a Vampiric machine gun with exploding bullets from the Watoga robot for 800 caps.
---
I don't know if it was a product of duping or not, but I bought it in good faith.  I don't know if I'll still have it tomorrow but I have a feeling there might be more posts complaining about the loss of 1 or 2 items bought from game vendors.
---
They can certainly restore lost items if they wanted to.  I think it is more that it would create a ton of work with people spamming support with these requests.  As it is I don't think many people are even working on this game anyway.
---
I'm terrified. Only level 43, playing since beta. Casual player. But farming Whitesprings was kind to me. I have 2 legendaries that I really can't lose! Playing 3 months to score them! 🙏
---
I dunno...this game has zero real replayability. 
---
they 
---
Yea, I don't even bother breaking out my mini gun anymore. Basically just a massive paper wt. Barely dose any dmg, an as you said, beaks very fast. 
---
Yeah metal gear survive was the “fallout76” of the metal gear series. They took the engine and property, fired the creator of the series and made a cheap online survival mode cash in that flopped and is universally hated. 
---
The post says all items created through duplication, so that implies even innocent buyers might be affected. Still, they did also mention that a small minority of players owns any duped items. Most of the innocent people who will be affected by this should have at least had a suspicion that something they are buying is duped
---
At least replace the duped items with inert flux.....
---
Its hilarious to me that youre talking about /u/visceral_adam making too many assumptions when you apparently thought you bought an item from a guy who got a legit drop (assumption), was so rich he doesnt need caps (assumption), yet doesnt understand the value of items (assumption), doesnt like shotguns (assumption), and also doeesnt check reddit (assumption, and where most trade offers are posted, weird), and wasnt aware there was even a dupe glitch (assumption), while also speculating that he was rich from a cap exploit, rooted in duping. 
---
Lordy. 
---
only time will tell if it is a legit handmade or not. i know i have atleast one legit (useful) weapon. my Vampire's Exposive .50 cal (2 star) i found off of a 2 star legendary protectron. 
---
&gt;!after the dupe purge, i will learn if the rest of my arsenal is safe from the sweep. gonna miss my recently purchased TSE reload speed mini-gun if it is removed. even got it the chrome skin from the atom shop.!&lt;
---
I'd rather quit this game then play boring ass melee
---
We need more stuff like that
---
This was my first thought
---
You've never bought any weapons or armour from the in-game vendors?
---
By "kill all duped shit" do you mean "These removals are highly-targeted at a specific list of items"?
---
Oh that's what the term was. Dumpster Fire lol
---
Nuclear Waste, Glowing Meat and some XP is why I go there.  Mostly the guaranteed nuclear waste to fix my ever breaking stuff.
---
Is there another game that significantly increases your chances of vandalism, griefing and resource loss simply by accepting a team invite?
---
It.... It bugged and half loaded into the game before having to go back and correctly load. Were you just not looking at the screen or do you have trouble understanding what you see?
---
100% “If I was a kid” is the right way to look at it. Not everything is made for our age group and if I was 10 years old I would love it. Same thing, I complain about how kiddie marvel movies are but then again I have to accept they’re not made for my age group, they’re also made for 10-14 year olds 
---
I'll happily take any quitters stuff. 
---
Have you done the enclave quest line? It might be connected to that. I thought it was meant to drop on your first sqb kill.
---
Its not 2005 anymore. Everyone already knows how to solve the problems that the early MMOs had and modern MMOs have launched without the same technical failures.
---
Fo76 isn't even an MMO it's a 24 person server tied to a central database.
---
If your doctor treated you with methods from the 1990s that were less effective than modern methods would you accept that?
---
Bethesda should take a modern approach to things not a 2005 approach.
---
Good question I wouldn't know, didn't watch it LOL! 
---
What do you mean by "they think were duped"? The post says all items that were created by duplication. Pretty sure the only way they can do that is if they have a way of knowing exactly what was created through duping. This might be a bit of a high expectation for bethesda, but if they're smart they have a unique item ID and spawn date on items that can be used to track dupes
---
Nah, innocent people will be screwed over in this too, which sucks. I dont think anyone who unknowingly has them deserves it per say but its possibly a step in the right direction for this game.
---
I doubt those items made their "highly targeted" list of items to be removed.
---
well thank you :)  TIL what a pull request is.  And well... if a company under the umbrella of a AAA developer isn't doing this correctly omg wtf!  
---
Except everyone who grinded for their caps and bought the duped items and can't tell they were duped lost their gear and the dupers keep the caps. That saying doesn't apply very well here since the damage is done. All you could really do to fix this is patch the duplication glitch, raise the level caps of items and armor and let everyone grind for the higher level'd gear. Keep the duped items in circulation because the damage is already done and any "fix" that involved getting rid of them will only do more harm than good at this point
---
Get help dude, your socially inept.
---
every weapon or armor ever dropped, found, or gotten through legitimate means (picking up from an enemy, quest, etc.) has an item code. 
---
this item code is individualized for each item, meaning there can only one item code per item. however, duping takes that item and duplicates it, resulting in multiple items with the same item code. 
---
this is how Bethesda will target if you do or do not have a duped item. if any item in your possession has an item code frequent among other players, then its a duped item. and duped items will be deleted. 
---
The gaming community could use more people like you sir, have an upvote.
---
I agree.  At this point I feel like the duped item thing is moot.  Make the game fun by adding to it instead of continuing to nerf and take away.
---
Damn. Thanks for the heads up.  Do you know if any secondary effects would impact Medic or Vampiric?
---
I'm glad they're doing all these fixes now BEFORE the new content can be tainted. It sucks waiting, sure, but I am happy to take a break for a few weeks/months and focus on schoolwork or other games while they get this game into the state we all dreamed of before it launched
---
Forme it was the constant flood of mole miners to get steel and black titanium from the scraping weapons and gear.
---
I am surprised there is so much hate for this game. I have 200+ hours in, and although I am starting to get a little bored with it, I really like the game quite a bit. I see few posts that say anything positive about this game, and it seems like everyone comes out of the woodwork to tell the poster why their opinion is wrong. I really don't get it. Maybe lots of people had their hopes set way too high for this game?
---
...And they will once again rollback bobby pin weight.
---
You think so? You think they have a way of knowing which guns you have in your inventory were duped? I don’t know man. I definitely believe they can tell if someone has been duping but not if someone bought one of those duped guns.
---
You're so salty i don't get it
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Ah the big oof
---
Welp good time for that second character
---
Maybe
---
Absolutely not. You buy a game and play it.
---
Get over yourself.
---
Your username lol
---
I got a Two-Shot 10% Damage while aiming Combat Rifle from a two star ghoul so I know that's at least legit even though it's only level 40. My TSE Handmade I bought for 20k who knows. Who knows about my Two-Shot Hunting Rifle I bought for 4k too
---
We’re not all getting fucked, just the cunts who duped items and ruined the game for everyone else
---
That is a really good question and I have no idea what the answer is. 
---
It never throws me in the same server and I drop loot bags to be sure
---
Too good to be true. 
---
I think the helmet you're talking about is available at the whitespring shop called captain kids, I actually have the helmet. I'll send four photos 1 is responder, 1 is firebreather, and the other two are the uniforms with the fireman helmet
---
It will be done my Lord.
---
So you are saying...  do not trade with players eg playing the game is willfully ignorant.
---
I’m really not but it’s ok. Denying I’m salty just makes me look salty. If it makes you feel you can think so. I don’t even play fallout 76 anymore. I’ve been playing god of war for the last week. They can take my entire inventory for all I care.
---
Well I know I don’t have any duped items everything in my inventory is from legitimate means just worried items I do have that are essentially the same items people regularly duped if they will be deleted. If what you say is true I should be fine then. 
---
What's going on mlm
---
Then how come they cannot restore lost inventory?
---
Kys SWEEEEET HOME ALABAMA!! REEEEEEEEEE
---
Holy shit you're thick.
---
It's across the board. Think about Aid items, if they prefixed them like: 
---
* Chems: Buffout
---
* Chems: Psycho
---
* Food: Canned Dog Food
---
* Food: Deathclaw Steak
---
* Health: Healing Salve
---
* Health: Stimpak
---
* Water: Boiled
---
* Water: Dirty
---
you might not spend half the time in that screen just scrolling around to find stuff, basically doing O(n) searches by hand. Or wearables. Imagine this:
---
* Combat Armor: Heavy Arm Left (Unyielding)
---
* Combat Armor: Heavy Arm Right 
---
* Power Armor: Excavator Helmet
---
* Power Armor: Excavator Torso
---
It's not without it's flaws (particularly for aid items that have multiple effects) but it's so stupidly easy of a solution, and they instead chose basically the worst way to do it for almost all items. It's even worse when you think they figured it out enough to prefix plans and recipes but didn't do the same thing for anything else.
---
I called it in the past and I'll call it again, ES VI will be MMO just like FO76. They are using FO76 as a testing ground
---
&gt;Which MMO has PVP, crafting, building, 25+ players, open world, and massive inventories...and works well?
---
Rust, BDO, ESO, Ark, Dark and Light
---
that's just off the top of my head
---
Fallout 76 isn't a part of that list because it doesn't "work well" :\^)
---
I have Destiny 2 and NMS. Destiny 2 is a great game, though not really my thing. I was sad at the state of NMS on launch (even if it was an indie developer, it was still unacceptably barren compared to what was promised) but love it now, because the developers *cared* and fixed the issues. Maybe FO76 will do the same thing. I sure hope so, I don't *want* the game to fail. Just look at my comment history. I was initially *not happy* for an online Fallout, then I warmed up to the idea as I learned more. Just like No Man's Sky deserved *all the shit* it got when it released in it's current state, so too does FO76. Maybe, if Bethesda pulls this off right, they'll pull a NMS and get a *ton* of respect like Hello Games did by releasing a turd and, rather than giving up, sticking around and polishing this turd into a gold bar.
---
Screenshotted my inv not looking forward to tomorrow for sure they will mess it up
---
About what? I’m all for trading? Or was this in response to the other guy?
---
Yikes, sounds depressing for fans of that series. Love how all the long running series end up breaking hearts.
---
I can be.  Please explain.
---
This is still happening. I constantly crash when trying to enter nuke zones. I'm on Xbox. This shouldn't be happening still.
---
So I guess I find out tomorrow if I spent hard earned caps on duped shit.
---
I agree. I feel like given a few years at plugging away with bug fixes and adding content it's gonna be an awesome game. 
---
I was disappointed for sure, even now when it seems they're trying to just make some things more tedious to prolong gameplay and reduce levelling up as quickly, which levelling is fair to a certain extent. 
---
That being said, I've pretty much ground this game to the point I'm just waiting for new content. I've been playing it since early November and I'm at a point where I've done pretty much all the dailies and events multiple times and I've completed the main and side quests, so I'm retired for a while. 
---
I am definitely gonna redownload it as soon as they release some dlc though. I have some guilt about not playing a few times a week, but when all I was doing was gathering some stuff, walking into events and maybe launching or joining a nuke, it got boring. Maybe in a month or so I'll start checking in a few times a week for the sake of just having a semi regular player in their system so they don't count it as a dead game. 
---
Either way, if they can keep it running like they have ESO, it will be just fantastic to play with a big world and lots of quests and people to help and meet. Just because I'm not playing it anymore doesn't mean I don't support them continuing to work on it. I'm excited for what they're going to be doing this year
---
PS4. But Thank you
---
I partially get your frustration but at the same time I think it's a good thing for the game as a whole that they are doing. I may loose my favorite gun I got in a trade but if I do its no big deal I'll just find something else to use 
---
I would eat that sandwich
---
I already did. It's up to you to comprehend. Not on me to teach an idiot how to read. 
---
What clothing items are we taking off?
---
&gt; then springing this randomly on a player base that the vast majority of people who just did a trade without being involved in the duping have no idea is coming and will wake up/log in tomorrow to find the work they put in grinding caps to buy from a player via the game's internal means are getting fucked with no compensation 
---
So this part means nothing to you?
---
&gt;  It’s also important to note that only a small percentage of accounts currently have duped items, which means the vast majority of players will not be affected by this action.
---
Huh. Fancy that. Didn't even realise. Thanks! 
---
No, no need to explain HOW to do it. But explaining what type of “player” you are and what kind of “player” environment you are part of was greatly appreciated.
---
God help us all, Bethesda has Mr Magoo running the patches and Cave Johnson doing PR.
---
So strange. I just thought it was a guaranteed drop on SBQ. I received it on all 3 of my characters the first time I did it. Now I never see it. 
---
Medic works best for weapons that can fill crit meter faster, OR reduce VATS AP cost. Vampire's works best with faster firing speed. reload speed
---
Something tells me we both know how those fans feel. And yeah eventually each series releases a cheap cash grab. Command and conquer and diablo just did mobile cash grabs recently too
---
So,,, admittedly probably every weapon  I bought at one was dupped so that sucks but oh well. My question is all the outfits I GRINDED for to find legit. What about those? Safe or naw?
---
Where's the wavy, inflatable armed guy??
---
Really? I felt like a ton of the guns in fo4 are based off real weapons. The radium rifle is a modified gustloff volkssturmgewehr, the assault rifle is a mg08/15, both the combat shotgun and combat rifle look like a ppsh-41, the handmade is obviously based off ak variants, etc
---
So folks that bought duped weapons got duped?
---
Can I get what weapons don’t get deleted lol 
---
I mean, with the topic at hand, I’m sure a lot of people are happy to see “justice be served” against those who exploited or benefitted from it, finally.
---
Have fun with your "swinging and fisting." Sounds like my kind of Valentine's day!
---
You like legitimately bought items with real $$$? I wouldn’t be worried about tomorrow, I’d be worried about today...and getting a refund. LOL.
---
The problem is not just with junk parts though. It's with basically every item category where they put arbitrary prefixes on items so they sort all jumbled and there's really no logical order when you look at the list.   
---
I'll go a step further and say the root issue is they just need more item tabs or sub section sorting (similar to misc missions in DATA), but they bunched a lot of vaguely similar items together so sorting is a huge mess.
---
I’m just worried about losing a weapon I paid 2k for only yesterday, without that I’m left with nothing but a fire axe. 
---
Do not feel sorry for RMT.. they know what they are getting into.   Feel bad for people just playing the game, working to save caps, buying from other players only to have Beth give them some Cpuid Vday pink dildos up the ass.
---
I bought my Two-Shot Exploding Handmade for 20,000 caps. I can't possibly know if it was duplicated or not, so yes, people can and will be innocent in this. I can't possibly know every single person who dupes, I can't know if an item is duped or not. So yes, it is innocent
---
Your luck stat needs to be higher, I’ve heard.
---
They are gonna eliminate every single possible duped item from inventory and stash, not from dupers, from everybody, so if u bought a gun in good faith and tommorrow discover that u dont have it anymore u are gonna lose ur gun but the fucking duper is gonna keep ur caps
---
Done 3 Nukes today lots and lots of legendary drops but all one star trash out of 83 drops one was a 3 star pice of armour..... the rest i sold to trades average 17 caps 👍 loot is pretty worthless and cnt scrap legendary

The game is gonna be fine, I’m glad this is happening as I’m tired of people with duped items it’s ruined this game.

*Fastens seat belt*

I dont care if fallout 76 dies tomorrow, this is the best thing I have seen on the internet in years.  A big FU to all the "mine is legit I traded for it" people.  LOVE IT!
---
Guess who bought a TSE handmade yesterday.
---
I’d never pay real money for a gun. I would buy for caps from people in the other subs though. Luckily caps are pretty easy to get so I wouldn’t be too upset if I lost something I bought really
---
If you don't play the game and you're not salty then why are you putting so much time and effort into bashing them? Just move on dude, play god of war. I hear its a solid game
---
if anyone is worried about there gear being removed from their inventory tommorrow I will take it off your hands if the price is right. I'm looking for following 3\* instigating explosive rifles, 3\* vampire explosive weapons, 3\* vanguard, sentinal, assassins, cavalier armor sets. wont be able to pay what you would normally ask since come noon tommorrow the item may no longer exist. if your willing to sell cheap i'll make a offer, and take the risk.
---
Do not complain people can not understand you then refuse to elaborate.  That is on YOU.
---
once something is gone, deleted, etc., it cannot be returned BECAUSE it does not exist anymore. 
---
bethesda probably does not store any item codes, rather they can monitor item codes currently available in game. 
---
this allows them to delete current item codes they deemed to be duped, but not being able to recover lost items. 
---
I'm not to worried about it, I've reported many people and the process to Bethesda many times. My friends make there own decisions and I'm not going to end a friendship over a video game. 
---
So does this mean Bethesda will tweak two shot and explosive legendary effects? From my understanding the point of the nerfs to these effects was to counteract all the duped tse's. 
---
This. Bought several weapons for 4000-6000 caps each. Wonder which ones I’ll have tomorrow night
---
Ya that’s ridiculous. I couldn’t imagine buying a gun for real money. Especially in this game 
---
147.6452%
---
Same here. Exactly. 
---
That's lame. I hope the wipe the characters that were duping alot
---
I have sympathy for people who bought couonterfeit items without realizing it. but the counterfeit items have to go.
---
I also do not expect as much to be deleted as people seem to think.
---
Justice be served? What crime did the players commit that deserves justice? They bought overpowered guns and yeah that’s not fair but hardly something bad enough to want to see heads roll. I could see if this was a big multiplayer game like call of duty and people were buying OP guns to dominate the playerbase. But most people just used the guns to make bullet sponge high level enemies less OP, like the scorchbeast. 
---
I think many are going to be surprised (assuming they really remove all dupes).
---
A level 4? That guy's a mule. A mule is a separate account that holds duped items so that account gets banned and not the real one. The chances of it being duped are 125% Get rid of it now
---
If memory serves me correctly the lowed the max level drop form this event a while back
---
There is certain games that dollar per hour measurements dont work well. Like god of war was truly amazing and I'd say maybe 50hrs tops just to guess but undoubtedly in the top 3 games ive ever played. It was worth every cent and I spent $150 for the collectors edition. 
---
Get an empty character, go to the overseer's camp, craft marine helmets as fast as possible until the server disconnect thing pops up 4 times...
---
The player with the dupe stuff drops it all into the overseers cache box, someone else grabs it and leaves ( multiple people can do this)
---
Then the crafting character crafts marine helmets again until the server crashes.
---
You can do it anywhere with a crafting bench but generally when the server starts acting up I look over at the overseers camp and there are 3 people there,I message them and they log off
---
I mean, as far as I'm aware, most of the dupers just made god-tier weapons for their friends or duped hundreds of thousands of bobbleheads/magazines/nuka colas/mutation serums etc. Sure plenty of it got sold off, but I'd say it takes somebody excessively stupid to have paid real money for this stuff. As for people who genuinely traded for something that turns out to be duped...I feel bad for them, but at this point it's necessary
---
But are they truly innocent I mean I didn't dupe my Tse handmade I got it in a trade but I got it knowing that it most likely was a dupe and you would have to be kidding yourself if you belive otherwise 
---
I quit 2 months ago. They should have tackled the duping problem earlier on, it has already caused a ton of players to quit. Game wont even be worth playing until they add proper end game. Game is already $11.99 for pc, no more money to be made.
---
The game is ruined because lack of content. I understand ur point but i dunno why they dont just ban or eliminate stack of stuff from dupers and not from peopla, we dont know if something is legal or not, but they are gonna keep the caps
---
you replied to me fyi, he prob won't see it lol.
---
How awful, you lose your caps cause you bought a duped gun. Just go make more caps from selling to vendors... I’m sure you can find enough stuff to make up what you lost
---
I hope everyone starts doing it... That way Bethesda will act on it.
---
I like my chances. I’ll sell it to you for a bajillion 
---
I got a TSE Gatling Laser for 10k, I feel the ache but it's okay since it was only for fun and not regular play.
---
Spreading the word and helping others for now is all we can do.
---
every time I spend 30 seconds trying to find purified water when it should take about 3 seconds if done right. and by "every time" I mean the fucking every 15 minutes you have to do that.
---
They can remove any weapon of mine, I’ll just craft more and mod them.. I’m not worried at all 
---
It's most definitely not. There is nothing more to elaborate.  If you don't have Der stand my point from my previous 2 comments then your reading comprehension ( thats an ability to deduce meaning from written words by reading them!) is next level bonkers bananas dumb
---
Just like real life.  "Receiving Stolen Goods" it's called.  Think that you could get an ultra rare dropped item for a few caps?  Innocent my ass..
---
I dont know if a gun is duped or not when i buy it, nobody is gonna tell u, so why i gotta pay for dupers and bethesda errors?
---
I see.  Interesting that you used that as an example.  I do not watch reality tv garbage.  My statement was assuming you were just a normal cunt, not from any show or anything...just average run-of-the-mill.  
---
Anyway, carry on.  You seem to take this duping thing very personally.  
---
If it was sold at a vendor I doubt it was duped, scammers would make more caps selling it up real people. We’ll just have to wait and see I guess.
---
He's talking about the prop weapons IRL 
---
If done correctly, I think removing duped items is the right thing to do... If done correctly...
---
Well if my TSE was duped which let’s be real all of them are then I’m left with just a fire axe and a 2k hole in my pocket
---
Good. Let’s get the game evened out so we can fucking move on and play the game. 
---
How is using an enabled feature on the game a bad decision? Also it's not like they added a message to the launcher that says "duping exists don't trade".
---
They should have disabled trading if trading is bad.
---
Assuming he duped whole stacks at a time and hadn't sold too many yet, prolly 1 in 64 that you got the original...
---
They seem to be doing a pretty good job of keeping you here
---
What would be the “correct” way? 
---
or at least mark the difference between inventory dropped and dead dropped. 
---
Cue sad trombone
---
Its gona disappear tomorrow, 
---
Are you not defending "innocent players" who bought duped gear?
---
Buying nukes on the black market doesn't make the buyer innocent, especially when France is looking for their stolen nukes.
---
Are you familiar with "receiving stolen property" laws?
---
Many convictions on that law affect more truly innocent people than the "innocents" who are going to lose their items tomorrow.
---
What I don't understand is where people think they are going to get high end gear after this? You cannot find this stuff yourself, people. Have you forgotten that? In 300 hours I found two good 3\* armor pieces and zero TSE explosive weapons or anything comparable like AAE or BE. The rest I traded for or bought with caps, and those items will probably all be removed after today and they won't come back for sale or trade. Nothing like that will, and if it does, have fun bidding against a bunch of no-life goobers. 
---
Not that I care much since I quit weeks ago, but for the people who still grind and think this is a good thing, did you even think about this? Or are you content with an incomplete build, mediocre gear and having a glass ceiling hovering over you? 
---
There goes all the weapons armor and possibly mutations I bought. Good thing I stopped playing like a month ago lmfao
---
Don't buy a Bethesda game. Is what I will have learned if 1 of my items is missing.
---
It’s just a case of luck, this is why I don’t trade with other players. I don’t want to risk getting duped items
---
We need some actual FUN news when it comes to Fallout 76.  If I do lose any items I'm going to just be less interested in playing...not more.
---
I wouldn't bet on those odds, partner
---
That makes no sense. If they don’t store item codes to restore those items how can they store item codes for other items that will be used to delete those items?
---
What system are you on?
---
Here, have a binky
---
Can you find me one on PC with those prices? I'm serious.
---
PS4
---
Idk he said it was legit. I think I trust xXxPu55yD3str0y3rxXx more than some reddit rando
---
For sure, but rendering the currently duped weapons pointless is way more effective. It has the same effect, but benefits the community as a whole as well.
---
I just have this terrible feeling they're going to fuck it up tomorrow.
---
And if you get lucky to keep it, it's value will increase, which could be a big win for you.
---
So win or lose, you know the next time you get that gun it won't be a duped version and that the economy, game and servers have benefitted.
---
And to top it off, cheaters were prevented from ruining the game for the future.
---
I'm kinda glad I didn't spend 10,000+ caps to get a god-tier melee weapon that very well may have been duped especially since those items are apparently going to be deleted.
---
You are not innocent. 
---
You participated in a compromised market, knowing full well it was compromised. 
---
Google "receiving stolen property."
---
This entire post comes across as an admission of guilt. Let's weed out the weak and let the strong rise up from the ashes. \*grins menacingly\* 
---
I never said there was content in the game, hell im running out of things to do other than SBQ and normal SB’s but it’s just a case of risk and reward, you might have bought a gun that’s duped, you might not have.. its like a lottery only for in game time you’ve spent getting the caps to buy the item 
---
Even if some of my weapons disappear, and those caps are gone for nothing, I'm still happy for this change.  Levels the playing field and we need the in-game economy to start normalizing.  Good stuff.
---
This is how I feel too.  It's like the moment has passed already and we're all looking for good news.  Not more taking things away from us.
---
Not for me. Maybe it's volume. I tend to sell no more than 20 in a pop. 
---
Bethesda continue. Remove duped items. Don't make them obsolete. Duped weapons shouldn't exist at all. They weren't intended to exist in the first place. If you lose your weapons, that's on you. Not them. You made the decision to dupe, or buy duped weapons.
---
like i said, they dont store item codes. 
---
they use AVAILABLE item codes IN THE GAME, meaning item codes that are prevalent in the servers but HAVENT BEEN DELETED, and off that basis, they delete duped items. 
---
Wow so if you bought a duped tse armor or whatever and didn't know your screwed. My prediction is they use this as an excuse to take out 90% of all tse guns in the game period and since they wont ever drop again, everyone has to relly on melee
---
Fair enough, guess I’m just salty I may be 2k in the hole tomorrow if it is a duped weapon which let’s be honest 95% of them probably are
---
Im 155 and i never found even any shitty just explossive guns, nothing, so, if theyre going this way they gotta fix the loot cause i cant be 155 and have lvl 20 guns thats ridiculous
---
this is a really dumb post OP, bethesda fixed duping already dontcha know, thats why they are removing the toys 
---
Well I used to use a Furious/fire rate 10mm SMG but traded it for the Responders Fireman gear which is why I bought the TSE in the first place
---
I don’t think it takes a stupid person to buy a gun for real cash. Look at the trade off. You can grind for dozens of hours hoping that a TSE MIGHT drop or you can just go on eBay and buy one for 2 dollars. I would think that for a person that has limited time to grind due to a job or family obligations, neglecting those things to grind dozens of hours is the stupid decision. We pay for shortcuts all the time, you buy a wedding dress right? You don’t spend a hundred hours learning to sew one yourself. That would be stupid.
---
I read this in the Emperor’s voice. Haha. 
---
Anyway, I am glad they’re going to actually *do* something about existing duplicated items. 
---
Found the dupper
---
If you're buying a godroll top end weapon, you should kinda just figure. Especially how cheap they ended up being. Like. C'mon. Use ya brain. 
---
The only thing that I have really wanted to buy was the Blackbird paintjob and I was too cheap to spend really money because I didn't have enough Atoms.
---
I have bought a few other things, but I have never really thought "wow, that's cool!" 
---
Following the analogy; If you really believe that, then why did you eat half your meal? 
---
It's a common theme here, people stating they played hundreds of hours and then calling it an "unplayable"  game. 
---
Missing the point here. Duped items aren't going to mean anything if there are much better ones to get legitimately.
---
Well, I am not in the game industry, so I that is probably not a question I can answer well. I would say that if only duped items are removed, that would be doing it correctly. I truly hope they know what they are doing, and only removed duped items. If they do that, that may cut down duping and the black market for duped items. Perhaps some punishments for people who dupe in the future (bans?). Once again, the final "correct" answer is way above me, but I definitely think it could be a good thing, depending on how it is handled.
---
they did...then reintroduced it in update 5 like the morons they are.
---
Take my upvote you dammit, you made me chuckle 
---
Buckle up Buck-a-roo!   
---
*Unveils golden chalice for their incoming tears* 
---
I’m not defending anyone. I’m sure innocent players have been dropped gear that have no idea it’s a thing. 
---
Which in a sense sucks for them, but it’s whatever. 
---
I just think anyone should be able to trade with anyone. I’ve not had a bad experience with it yet. But if you only want trusted friends then do you. 
---
None of this changes the fact that the game was designed with player trading in mind. 
---
Im sure that crack team at Bethesda Austin is on top of it?  LOL
---
I think it's a bug. I've seen this a few times &amp; when I went to check the sites, nothing is even remotely close to it to warrant blocking my camp. 
---
That's weird, and mine does not behave in this fashion. I'm guessing you already tried the closing the app and all the usual other rediculous attempts to fix. 
---
Yeah it sucks. But it's better for the game in the long run
---
You're right. Never thought it'd be you, man.
---
 I expected better.
---
But how do we know if those won't be duped either?
---
You are only talking half the story 
---
Same here, bought one yesterday for 2000 caps. Too good to be true.
---
For everyone saying it's 'user error' cant wait till this happens to you so u can see for urself :)
---
The only party not innocent here, is Bethesda for failing at MMO creation and management.
---
Check out bethesda support's Twitter, they get trolled about fallout even on bot posts about ESO being down for maintenance. It's a ridiculous meme. I mean, I do realize that there are people with legitimate issues, but most of them wouldn't be as hateful about it if it hadn't become a meme. Believe it or not, the vitriol is (gradually) starting to subside, it really only peaks around patch days.
---
Bethesda with the big f*** you to any person that used actual money to obtain in game items. Have they gone on ebay and seen that some people are actually paying real money for duped items. I agree duping is a problem and it needs to stop but removing any and all items that are the product of duping is not a solution, it is a lazy work around. 
---
Thats the thing im 155 and i never found any cool weapon, the loot is garbage
---
when you say invisible you mean that wibbly shimmer like predator right? because appparently in PA there is a legit way to get stealth boys to last longer than normal.
---
Well if the game was balanced fairly, then there wouldn’t be one master race of guns called TSE that make every other gun worthless in comparison and therefore there would be no high demand for that specific gun enough to set up a marketplace on eBay.
---
Well that's even shittier that we're on different systems, I've got a 10mm SMG with those on it.
---
who said it was purchased for cheap?
---
A lot.... its enough to one shot the level 92 death claw in white springs. Depending on how low i go with hit points its between 350-400 and either 2.5x sneak attack during day hours or 3.5 during night hours (half of the entire time you play). The dragon pushes almost 900 per shot before multipliers but its obviously a one shot wonder gun you should use for a crit on a boss mob but honestly the lever action crits work just as good too. 
---
I wonder if this is going to cause a mass Exodus from f/o from all the people suddenly without high end gear.
---
No, it's 90% lighter if I remember right.
---
There’s a tracksuit in the atomic shop but I don’t think that is what you mean. 
---
Pretty much why I said in the post to ensure it's fixed. Their primary focus should have been fixing this from the first day instead of atom shop bullshit.
---
That's where you're wrong. I'm incredibly excited for tomorrow! 
---
Okay I did, here's what came up:  
---
&gt;The crime of receiving stolen property is defined as knowingly receiving stolen property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property of its possession.
---
Keywords here: **knowingly receiving stolen property**
---
I do not, and still don't know if it's duped. What am I supposed to do? Not trade with a single player? So yes, I still technically am innocent. If the player I traded with said it was duped, or I know he was a duplicating player, then yes, I wouldn't be innocent because I would then **KNOWINGLY** have received a duped item
---
lmao! 
---
+karma
---
I know I wont be buying their games upfront again. FO76 was my first Fallout game and I actually love the gameplay. The bugs though broke me and I quit about 2 months ago. In the future I intend on letting any bethesda game I am interested in to be out for a couple of months before making the purchase.
---
But Duping hadn't been discovered yet
---
What are you talking about? I’m geared with just crap I could make myself and there’s nothing in the game (except sbq) that I don’t just stand there still and fire til gibs. All at lvl 50.
---
Oh really? Well that’s pretty crappy, ah well if it comes down to it I’ll just buy a trash handmade or 10mm while I recoup my caps
---
That actually raises a good question. Could "classes" like super mutants use power armor or would choosing to be a super mutant mean you'd have to forgo it entirely?
---
Then I'm misinterpreting you.
---
I agree that participating in a legitimate market is intended and should be facilitated. 
---
Everyone here has known that the market has not been legitimate as soon as duping was first reported.
---
Yeah im pretty sure i don't have it but ill check when i get out of work
---
What are you talking about? Duping was discovered in beta and reported multiple times.
---
In vats he was moving around, but his body/limbs seemed frozen and did not move. If it’s legit then I’d feel bad, because I usually leave their loot alone. I was following for a fairly long time..
---
why are the guilty always rolling on their homies 
---
I, too, just had this happen to me. At the bottom level, killed a legendary liberator and went to a nearby terminal. Boom! Dead. There were no enemies in the area. Anyone every find out why? I wasn't right next to the liberator.
---
https://youtu.be/7E-4rfeajBM
---
I'll put a stone right between the eyes of that Goliath.
---
Ok gm zetsubou pro I'll be on in a sec
---
Not really, not from Bethesda, no. Have you seen how their patches work out? Their estimates?
---
Also, if such a small amount actually had them...
---
1. They wouldn't be everywhere in the game, constantly, particularly since these high-roll weapons are so rare outside of duping. I dare you to find a server where only a "small percentage" have them.
---
2. It wouldn't be enough of an issue to warrant a pull and removal. If such a small percentage has them, why waste resources on this instead of... you know... like... every... other problem?
---
They're trying to downplay the impact on players, acting like they caught most, when actual time spent in game reveals the opposite.
---
UNLESS, that is, that TSE weapons have become a common drop after they were supposed to be removed, and I just haven't gotten one.
---
Sure, but then those "better" items will probably just end up getting duped.
---
And duped items also "won't mean" anything if they get removed all together. It is a come issue, but I think a straight out removal of these items is the correct call overall.
---
As long as we're talking specifics, there are a few things that are going to be common between the BaseIDs. Depending on what type of programming they use, there should be a few digits that actually stay the same on an item, no matter what. In Oracle, when an attribute is given, it's unique at the time of "creation". 
---
Emphasis given in the word creation, above, was because what's happening to the duped item isn't creation. It's almost like copying and pasting. I'm not exactly sure, without looking at the actual log files, but I should imagine that something like the date of creation or a reference to the player that caused it to spawn would be common among all the dupes.
---
oh there were certainly other factors but without the brotherhood they might have lived long enough to mitigate them.
---
&gt;!or if the brotherhood launched a nuke like the players rather then getting themselves killed carrying one inside.!&lt;
---
Every defendant of that law has made the same argument.
---
Also if 2 people collect at the same time you both can go as fast as you can click.
---
To be honest yet to see that, I frequently find WhiteSprings with hundreds of meat piles, becoming more and more unstable.  
---
  
---
I've heard of vanishing meat piles but yet to see them, and generally when the corpse converts to meat piles they can be found, they just ended up in odd spots, very common with bloody mess.  
---
Example:
---
When I'm looking for a missing body or 5 Almost always Find half a dozen piles in the center island grass, I guess that's where the engine decided the "bodies" ended up.
---
As likely as you are serious.
---
Yup...I bail on whatever I’m doing when I see AWOL pop up.   It’s pathetic there are not at least 3 or 4 other events like that throughout the map.  Not like it has a complicated story backing it up.  
---
Are they really though?  Its hard to have a lot of value when each person is capped at 25k.
---
I have a couple hundred from farming, I don't use them for much since I finished the excavator armor levels ago and gunsmith/white knight. send me your gt OP 
---
I welcome any Bethesda employee to specifically check my account. I'm clean and legit since day 1.
---
Yes i have but idk if i played it all the way ill have to check when i get home from work
---
I know it’s awful but why risk having duped items? I don’t have any TSE or any legendary items like that and I still have fun with my handmade and laser rifle, they’re both normal guns and I haven’t had an issue, I don’t enjoy killing things in one or two shots when I know I can do supply runs for lead at flatwoods and Charleston fire department. Get about 100lead from that alone which makes enough ammo to last a couple sessions
---
I have a TSE Gatling cannon.  Does around 170 per round rather than 550 before the nerf.
---
I’ll be sad to see that go.
---
Interesting I thought that was only effecting anti-armor legendary energy weapons. Might be the same issue.
---
ok
---
Good luck to you, and pretty much everyone whose in the same field as us, kinda-sorta.
---
Bethesda, stop. Don’t release the game in this condition. Work on it for another year instead.
---
Nope. Not going to get into it but they have said that they can't track a single item. 
---
I run it when I need steel for ammo.  That’s it.
---
So it’s definitely not duped? Thanks joe
---
So if you mod said item, wouldn’t the code change since the attributes change?
---
-someone who benefited from duping
---
In '76?   
---
Pink Deathclaws for sure
---
Oh really? That's weird
---
This will not end well. All the people that bought items with caps could lose their caps and items now when they had no way of knowing if something was duped.
---
Lmao that first paragraph. "they said they can't fix it" to "they can fix it now". Maybe they just figured out how?? That's how problems get solved, ya dork. Sometimes people don't know things... and then they figure them out. 
---
"they said they couldn't cure polio" "they cured polio WTF why didn't they just do that begin with". Fkn listen to yaself, man. 
---
I don’t play the game anymore (~415hrs gameplay) but I’m going to login after the patch just to see how much of my gear is remaining. Honestly, it’s the most excitement I’ve had around this game for awhile. 
---
No, just plans and selling chems.
---
We'll never know for sure.  The posts will flood the forum but you will never ever be able to tell who is telling the truth and who was a closet-duper or turned a blind-eye.  It doesn't really matter in the end.  It might suck for a bit but then the game goes on.  We will all find better weapons down the road, AND eventually 5 star weapons and armors will be released.  We'll be fine.
---
Meh, he had a bounty. you killed him. his loot is part of the bounty, dont feel bad.
---
WearyPup8297077
---
I respect your correct usage of the word "loose". Today you did not lose.
---
Hard bargain is worth it either way just for what it saves you on big purchases.
---
I'm legit worried about this maintenance.  The launcher deleted my game the first time I tried to play the beta and things haven't exactly gone 100% smoothly since then.
---
I'm all for higher levels on weapons and armor!
---
Truth hurts , keep down voting
---
Anytime Sprinkles!
---
Congrats? Why are you still playing then? It couldn't possibly be to get better gear could it?
---
No no you misunderstand.   
---
The last set of patches introduced a glitch that unintentional will cause a duplicate set of Power Armor pieces, and some times a whole frame, to end up in your inventory.  
---
It's not about someone duping and trading, or you doing something shady, it's a legitimate bug that's occurring 
---
And I'm not saying my TSE Handmade shouldn't be confiscated if it is duped. What I'm saying is that I do not know if it's duped, so yes people can be innocent in this. I grinded hard and long for those 20,000 caps. No way I would knowingly pay that much thinking Bethesda would do something about duped items. However now the damage is done for everything. All these dupers have countless caps from trading and everyone is going to lose their gear they didn't know was duped. Everyone loses and the dupers still win because them and their countless alts have maxed out caps
---
He's essentially describing why a car wreck is bad, not excusing the person who ran the red light to cause the car wreck.
---
As a software engineer myself I bet the people who know where the bodies are buried have been reassigned and there isn't proper documentation. Since that is normal in badly managed companies.
---
It doesn't mean management didn't make bad decisions.
---
Keep ya head in the sand, lass. It ain't gotta make sense to all of us. 
---
man I'm drinking beer thats too many, just shoot me an invite my gt is "dn gr"
---
Yeah let them kill the sbqs with ultracite ammo like theyre supposed to and die from ghoul hordes at whitesprings. Enough of these vulture kills.
---
100% is the chance. Ask yourself, how does a level 4 have 53 TSE shotguns legitimately?
---
Found the duper. This is a fun game

lol it's called nerd mentality. They are thinking of the same thing when they see crappy internet abbreviations. They see one person took the initiative of mentioning the abbreviations and feel a breeze of relief in their souls. Then they slam an upvote to set their stamp of recognition lol.
---
Can you imagine the "innocent" victims who paid real money off those shady websites for items. I'm glad I don't work in their support centers tomorrow
---
Yeah really, where's a Mr. Handy when you need one?
---
If anything, it would be good if vaults come out and are a thing like raids.
---
I think my primary concern is their pass they're doing tomorrow might fuck shit up beyond recognition. Knowing their track record, I have a feeling they're not keeping a backup of player items and when they wipe duped items they'll fuck other stuff up real good.
---
A good combination would be removal of duped items and an introduction of better items to ensure those that slipped by the cracks will be rendered obsolete.
---
I didn't. I commented on the general market of godtier weapons as a possible warning sign, if applicable to your case. 
---
But I bet it was. 
---
odds are 100% mate if anyone has 53 of the same legendary weapon then its 100% duped and will be removed from your stash.
---
This is the reason the lvl 4 ( alt character ) is selling them as he wants to cash in and get caps before they remove all his duped goods.
---
If only
---
Bethesda is doing server maintenance tomorrow and during that period they'll be deleting all duped items from the game.
---
Too late
---
Hahaha
---
Does anyone remember the rick and morty scene after rick makes the galactic currency zero the bug guy saying  i could tell you for money i picture that happening tomorrow with non duped guys just people running around naked asking for guns 
---
Aye but other than small indy studios who will bother not to sell in the largest market available to them. Perhaps some will enable features only outside the US but I doubt it.
---
At least we could now vendor more properly, and vendoring would be more valuable rather than dupers vacuuming everything to sell for $.
---
Video was perfect, best way to explain something like that is to show it!  
---
It almost looks like it's zooming into the bottom of your scope between it and the frame of your gun!  
---
Ok first question:  
---
PC or console?  
---
Second question:  
---
Has it happened with other weapons?  
---
Thanks btw, this kind of thing, it helps!
---
You guys did not read their post, they mentioned it is a small number of accounts that is targeted, most likely ones they flagged for weight a while ago and kept track of them. 
---
Melee is the meta now. Hits from melee do massive damage and expend no ammo which is expensive and can be rare. Not to mention guns break quickly in this game. I’m not sure this is the game you want to play to make multiple builds like you would in Skyrim. The builds in this game are fairly shallow. But right now melee is by far the best build and if done right, you will be knocking out level 70 enemies with one hit of your axe or sledgehammer
---
Wtf!? 
---
nothing would change. its still the same original item with the same item code, but with mods. 
---
the way it works is like genetics and physical qualities, if you know something about it.
---
your genetics determine who you are and what you look like, and it cannot be changed. so getting a tatoo or working out would change how you look yes, but it does not change your genes.
---
this analogy would be used to describe your misconception. the item code is the DNA, and your mods is like getting a haircut or losing an arm.  
---
So since your post here I got a two-shot plasma, and moded it to a flamer, and yea it’s pretty amazing, for the queen it’s the strongest weapon I have by far, I used to run in and hit with “all-rise” and watch the reasonable sized chunks of health go down, now I run in, hit, and a major chunk goes, I hit again and she’s dead, not even a second round.  
---
Still a good way to get the 76 events in the savage divide challenge, just like breach and clear is for the ash heap.
---
You're right. They are intent to burn it to the ground. My goodwill is gone.
---
Perfect timing, as I've been farming legit power armor for a couple weeks and I'm about to open my Chop Shop. 
---
@visceral\_adam won the internet tonight.
---
I think Whitesprings was originally meant to be in another area of the map and was moved late in development to where it sits now. My theory is that it was located west a bit further and they moved it east to make it more central on the map because I think it will eventually play a bigger part in the game and they wanted it more accessible to all level players.
---
Well, not going to lie, I can't play the game at the moment, last 3 times I logged in it was taking forever to load corpses,'especially for legendary NPCs.    
---
Would not be shocked if the corpses are bugging out, that said always check the basement, I've had the corpses end up back when the ghouls spawn.   
---
Regardless,'I'll add this to the list of NPC bugs, because they are at the very least, supposed to convert into meat piles FFS
---
Really nice reply. Thanks for the tips. 
---
I'm pretty dissapointed that they think the presence of duped items, as opposed to the game generally just kinda sucking, is the real problem plaguing this title.
---
I don't condone duping, its just that what has turned me off of this game is that it's pretty bad once you near end-game.
---
Also you never get any meaningful loot so why bother?
---
Same. Clearly though Bethesda employs the kind of people who will fk you in the butt and not have the common decency to give you a reacharound.
---
I don't think they listen to anyone. I'm just telling others my plans because a conversation going about this game. Even though you don't want to hear about something doesn't mean that nobody else wants to. Perhaps they haven't heard about it. Maybe if they are looking for something new I just gave them an idea. Maybe I'm just talking into the universe. Doesn't really matter at all. It's for me.
---
Sorry, but you can’t be both goth and punk at the same time.   Let me guess—you’re a big Black Veil Brides fan?
---
Exactly.  If they were to actually PLAY the game to level 100+ we’d see a lot less jackassery in the updates.  
---
Lol yep
---
LOL
---
I hope nothing I bought out of a vendor was from a duped group, interesting if they can do that but not replace lost items.
---
Second dumbest thread today.
---
That is some very stupid logic. TSE are nice guns but not necessary.  If you are that lazy or stupid to buy it on e bay you deserve to be ripped off.
---
Because out of the 13 players left they would lose 7. 
---
I just threw up in my mouth at the concept that something a fellow Wastelander might have placed in my camp while on a team might have been duped.  Oh.... oh my Atom. 
---
I dont kill things with 2 shoots with tse it took me a lot of shots with the nerf, this patch has no sense
---
Yeah? What's the first?
---
Bethesda, stop. You don't know what you're doing. She's your cousin, Bethesda. 
---
Fair to be a bit salty. But there's always more guns. If you are someone 'quitting' because of it, you most likely don't want to play anymore anyway.
---
Fingers crossed you keep it, for your sake!
---
Lol wait for tomorrow, instead of only deleting duped items they wipe everyone’s inventory and roll the servers back to day 1
---
I just want something different to trigger when I go to the spot. Something always triggers in low zones, maybe 20% monster mash, but otherwise it just seems like enclave stuff
---
Actually it os the BoS that kept the area alive as long as they did.
---
I'd love to see a dev make a pistol build and tell me to my face it's on par with any other weapon type.
---
Bought an item from a guy for 2k caps. Then a few days later saw him post the exact same item. I really don't care if it gets deleted. It's not real anyways. I'm glad this duping crap is being targeted. I also wish wearing power armor would nullify certain mutations. 
---
Idk what you people are doing, but I find a 2 star weapon almost every time I grind for gear. I legit found Gronk's axe if anybody trying to buy it on ps4. I'm not malee build, so no use for it. If not a vender will get it. 🤗
---
Naah I definitely won’t quit, I’ll just be very frustrated because I also crafted like 4k 5.56 rounds as well
---
Made me giggle snort for sure.
---
I choked on my water just now reading this, too. This dude won the internet today. 
---
Oh no duper is angry and throwing insults.  At least when I log in all my items will remain. Because I'm not a lazy moron.
---
Every item in the game has its own GUID. 
---
It has to be a script, there's just no way to scale up having people poring over character inventories by hand. Now that doesn't ensure that it's a smart script. 
---
Youtube video falling Bethesda deleted peoples inventories said a person on a reddit who said they never duped in there life
---
The game is best when you can go from doing your own thing to teaming up to take down some baddies. It's too bad it seems to disconnect whenever it gets good.
---
Hey thanks for the reply!
---
Melee really does seem to be the meta now. Do you know if 1H &amp; Unarmed weapons are any good? And is there a damage threshold where a 1H/unarmed will be doing enough damage to one shot whitespring enemies? Making it quicker than farming with a 2H due to speed?
---
Also are non Power Armor builds just as viable as Power Armor builds for farming purposes?
---
I believe yes most duped items will be deleted
---
Did you get the very top containers which are reserved for hornwright execs? 
---
Why is that stupid logic? Because you think they are not necessary? Then why was the entire playerbase obsessed with TSE? Because they’re just like every other gun? No, they are necessary if you want to deal with bullet sponge enemies in a reasonable amount of time, OP enemies like scorchbeasts that take a million rounds to bring down. They are not balanced correctly and created the demand for such guns in the first place. 
---
I crybaby rant that the guy deleted.
---
Oops I just duped my post. 
---
I think we would all take that over no new content,our builds being ruined and items actually being removed. 
---
Only doom you feel coming is the last 30 lol playing leaving lol
---
I think at this point people are just quitting silently.  I have.  Anthem demo pulled me out of this burning wreck haha.
---
Damn how did you find 11 runs? Just server hopping? I love those events. Hella stimpaks
---
Well, i got mixed feeling for this as well. I guess we got to see exactly how bad the wipe is after the maintenance.
---
Yup, I've bought a couple mods and plans already,. The only problem is that I forget to switch out my perk card back to Lone Wanderer.  Getting tired of swapping out perk cards because of my constant weight problem. Swap out my melee perks just to equip Sturdy Frame, Strong Back, and Traveling Pharmacy (all maxed out) just to fast travel. 
---
Oh I'm sure that's what all the dupers are going to start claiming. 
---
Filter for screw  http://incendar.com/Fallout76_Junk.php
---
Removed!
---
You claimed you would not be sympathetic to anyone who loses their TSE tomorrow because there’s “overwhelming” publicity of duping, implying a sort of “well you should’ve known better” sentiment. In the same post you made it a point to explain why your item probably WASN’T duped, presumably to excuse yourself from that same sort of guilt. If you meant something else I would love for you to explain.
---
Honestly I just think it’s bullshit that Bethesda is punishing a number of innocent players for their screw up. The overwhelming majority of players don’t read the 76 subreddit and it’s ridiculous to think that the average account is very familiar with duping.
---
However this all sort of overlooks the fact that your entire post is irrelevant because you fail to take into account the fact that duping isn’t theft. Theft implies that someone else lost something for you to gain something (in a non consenting way), which is the entire reason theft is illegal.
---
PS. My nicest gun is a Suppressor’s Lever Action.
---
I’m not giving up on this game yet, but I’m taking a break because I keep getting more angry about it each time I go back to it. But seriously who is paying duper’s real money for guns in 76?
---
So like everyone who played even remotely socially?
---
We really need a greenhouse CAMP set.
---
This is going to kill any trust players had with trading in game. Bethesda might as well restart from the ground up cause any idea they had of a in game player trading economy..is dead now
---
Damnit ...... this takes all the fun out of telling you I told you so..... but   I TOLD YO....... fuck it !!! I’m out of here
---
I have the vtu jumpsuit plan. I dont remember from where,, but I read about the overseer cache in grafton 
---
I bought the Special Collectors Helmet Edition with $0.76c bag.  
---
I uninstalled it yesterday because I haven't played it since I got back from End of Year Holidays due to massive frustrations about unfinishable quests, crashes, lack of NPCs, lack of meaningful quests...  
---
Screw Bethesda for destroying my favorite game. Screw Bethesda for not listening to the fans and community. Screw Bethesda for not even having some sort of road map so we can see what they are planning to add etc.  
---
First time I heard of that was in 2002. I was playing Diablo 2 and noticed spam in trade chat, checked out the website. They sold every single thing you could imagine in that game for like $10/pc. Its been around forever and (unfortunately) I doubt it's going anywhere.
---
Yes of course that would be the preferred plan. New content and new guns to offset the shit they’re taking.
---
If you go to Black Bear Lodge you can pretty much turn in any direction to find it. The trees are everywhere surrounding that place. 
---
It wouldn't be Valentine's day without a powerfist, i guess... 
---
I agree, it’s not ideal but I agree
---
To expand on my original post, in FO4, I had several houses, one was my summer house at the former drive-in which also had an amphitheater disco-bar with hookers. Now I live in a shack on a hill with basically nothing and my build budget is maxed out.
---
This bothers you more than the disconnects?
---
No.  
---
It's NOT worth it.
---
A fucking month late.
---
if this purge works the legit epic weapons will skyrocket in the markets, it won't be "I'm asking" it will be "how much you got?"
---
That's cool.
---
So did you actually read the post or just assumed the worst, my guy?
---
Beautiful. My house isn't that far off from where you build.
---
where’s yours at? 
---
If trading for too good to be true items with random people is your idea of "playing socially," yes.
---
Agreed! It would be cool to have players implement their own world building. The disconnects hadn't crossed my mind. My only work around for not having server lists and having disconnects is having a list of die-hard key players willing to add tons of interested peeps as friend so people can access the servers where these kinds of things are going on. I feel 76 is a great opportunity to have players world building, if not out of necessity for more stuff to do, but also because it's kind of implied that that's why we're there in the first place; to build the new world in our image. I just want this game to keep going on :/  I'm loving it.
---
It was better until they started patching in ways to slow people down instead of fixing bugs. So for the first month after it's release essentially.
---
&gt; He has a list of the bugs he addresses, including timestamps, in the video description.
---
Those are *section* titles, for 'bugs of a similar type'. Not individual bugs. 
---
But how many times have you had a random come up to you and offer to trade items? I have once and I never accepted. My point is that there are no innocent people if they bought either here or any other trade board. And the people that bought stuff of eBay or such, well I don’t understand the logic of buying in game items for real cash. 
---
Literally 95% of my good items i got this way. So i can be out all decent items come tomorrow. The drops are so broken in this game kill a 3 star legend get 1 star item or nothing. Its not like i have god level stuff just decent stuff. Now i might have to go do more farming with crappier weapons!? 
---
Max item level should be 76
---
Surely the BoS fought a pretty good fight? Trying to take on the scorch beasts seems like they were doing the right thing?
---
Unsure how it’s their fault everyone ended up dead? If you mean the fact that they were documented to be forcibly taking ammo / weapons / supplies from civilians somehow contributed to their deaths, I would argue that those things were better used in the hands of trained soldiers than farmers and office workers, for the greater good.
---
It actually hurts how true that's likely to be
---
Yer, and enclave events are terrible!
---
I sure did! I read it twice. Doesn’t change my opinion. 
---
Agree, on xbox the servers are rocking fine.
---
Do you need the gun?
---
No
---
If you do not need the gun why would you spend the time grinding for it?
---
Second if you lack the time for grinding why buy a game with grinding in it?
---
Seem's that Bethesda thinks so.
---
Yeah the duppets, that are dragging the game down!
---
are they really though? responders, raiders, free states were all fighting the scorched. they had to if they wanted to live. hell the brotherhood even started to close ranks and abandon areas like Grafton dam. The scorched were a threat, yes, but it was a (difficultly) managed one.
---
and in the end &gt;!it was the brotherhood that triggered the swarm that they couldnt contain and the raiders and responders were stretched to thin fighting each other as well as scorched to fight off.!&lt;
---
 Of course that's going to happen.  I think that's the frustration,  is that the odds of having a duped a duped spring even is likely.  Who hasn't found a bag on the ground and been like ooooohhhhhh sprrriiinnngggssss
---
Haha I was thinking the same thing, if that free TSE I got disappears I'm respeccing into melee
---
Bye Felicia.
---
This flailing is what I live for.
---
Solid point. Every once in awhile I'll initiate a trade. 
---
Only people with duped items are crying. Maybe you shouldn't have bought duped items.
---
Yeah this game was dead to me after explosive nerf since I had legit obtained gear which I got completely screwed over with.  This will be the nail in the coffin for most though.
---
Bethesda is going to tommarow delete most of the duped items in the game
---
Yes they were because they knew of the threat before others.
---
The words of a true duper.
---
Aww, look at the dupers trying to gaslight.
---
My understanding is that this is not exactly how it works.
---
Let's say the Base ID of a Pipe Rifle is AABB66 (I'm making this shit up btw).  Then you *create* a Pipe Rifle that is a TSE legendary, and it gets assigned a RefID of BCBC45.  If you dupe that TSE pipe rifle the new one will have to have a different RefID even if it shares the same properties, b/c you can't have two items in the game (at least not on the same server) with the exact same RefID (the game wouldn't know which is which during interactions, and also when calculating x,y,z coordinates in the game world of the item).
---
This is my understanding of the system in the Creation engine.  Things can be connected to the same BaseID but have their own individual RefID or it all goes to shit.  
---
If I'm wrong please correct me, and explain why/how for all of us to understand.
---
This is evidence they DO care about the game.
---
Your opinion is your own, but if tomorrow comes and all shit breaks loose I'll be here watching.
---
I have no doubt that the highly-skilled programmers at BGS are up to this task.
---
it is because of the head lamp, a recent update for a soon to be released paint job comes with a custom version of the red lamp. a bit of coding mistakes marked all head lamps as atom shop items (except for default) you can still find them in the world/some vendors 
---
I hope not, two shot and explosive were way too powerful. The nerfs brought them in line with the rest of the legendary effects. 
---
They're not the best, but they're active all the time compared to the enemy type specific effects, and they don't need any special conditions like low DR or low health like some of the stronger effects.
---
I've been playing single player Fallout since 1998, I don't care who quits or doesn't. Worst case scenario-myself and a few others have a giant world all to ourselves. 
---
GOOD!!!
---
Imagine that rare items being rare was the intended design...
---
Gun nut is one of those wonky perks that sometimes has to be re equipped.   Seems to happen to after fast travel and entering / exiting PA for me.
---
Wish I could remember this hint myself before my guns are halfway, or more, broken.
---
Epic LOL'd at work to this. :D
---
It's going to be epic. I can't wait.
---
reading this post and your username all I can think is "Keith in IT is ready for the reboot" 
---
Get the popcorn.
---
The gameplay is some of the most fun.  The bugs did me in though.  When I couldnt launch nukes because I crashed everytime i went through a bunker, and I still had the problem after it was "fixed", I lasted about another week and havent picked it up since. That said - I still check back here, hoping that one day I will see posts about how people are glad most of the bugs are gone etc. and I will pick the game back up.
---
Me too, and for a flood of these posts.
---
Grab your surf board, the rear tsunami is going to be totally tubular!
---
Duping has not been fixed.
---
Of course all kinds of shit is going to happen. The change and purge hasn’t happened yet and look at the this stupid post.
---
You and others have already started the shit.
---
Meanwhile everyone else has a false sense of superiority even though they let dupers and exploiters rack up xp and loot for them. They ran silos solo and gave you a nuke zone as well. Reset us all to 0.
---
Urainum fever is over rated
---
😎👆👆
---
I may talk a lot of shit about the game, but I’m not giving up on it either. I’m going back and playing the other fallouts and just logging into 76 every once in awhile. 
---
In ways, it’s exactly what I wanted in a fallout game. But it’s also missing a lot of features I loved the previous games for
---
Am a lvl 45 filthy casual... I was wondering if I picked up ammo dropped by ppl who duped it will Beth remove all of that particular ammo? Doesn’t really matter to me I really only keep about 200 rounds of various ammo on me or in my stash and if I have more it’s due to the kindness of the community but I never ensure it wasn’t duped.
---
2 handed weapons are usually the most powerful ones but there are plenty of powerful one handed weapons too. It really more depends on the perks the weapons have more so than if they’re 1H or 2H. And while 2H swing slower, the increase in power makes up for it and allows for one slow swing kill vs several faster ones. But then again there are legendary weapon perks  that add things like 40% faster swing speed to the weapons if that’s what you’re worried about. 
---
I’m not sure about damage threshold. I don’t know the technical stuff like that.
---
As far as farming builds. Carry weight is an extreme problem in the game. So much so that people spend half of their perk points on stuff like weight reduction and increased carry weight when they would MUCH rather be using those perks for increase damage. That’s how much of an issue carry weight is.
---
That being said there is no farming build that equals the 200 point increase you get from excavator. It is the number one used armor in the game despite several armors having much higher damage and radiation resistance, and even jet packs.
---
But if you must go without power armor, get deep pocketed armor, each deep pocketed piece of armor adds 10 carry weight to your character for a total of 50. Plus you can get the marsupial mutation which adds another 20 pounds to your carry weight and makes you jump super high allowing you to traverse terrain much easier and therefore farm easier.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
I wouldn't be surprised self either to be honest 
---
It's showing that you have 1 point so I'm not sure that anyone downvoted you. But then again I have 1.2k karma and don't care about upvotes or downvotes so I can't relate. 
---
Yes. Every day the Inside the Vault or a patch drops, there is a HUGE influx of useless, insulting users. Really is annoying.
---
No fear!  I could wake up naked tomorrow, and I'll still have fun hoarding it all over, just as much as I enjoyed it the first time around.  This is the nature of online MMO style games I think.  It stings less when you've played a lot of MMO's and this sort of thing (or less bad things, or much much worse things) have already happened to you before.  It's just the nature of the beast.
---
Worst case scenario, they don’t have enough players or make enough money in the Atom Shop and turn off the servers. 
---
Depends on where you intend to farm, scorched and ghouls shouldn't  be much of a problem. A few mutants should be do-able. It's when you run into events or hordes you might want to put on your PA. Non powered are much more able to skip about dealing damage, but depending on your play style that may mean you have to put stronger, heavier armor on, lowering carry weight. Stealth builds seem broken at the moment.
---
except it doesnt seem that way. free states had a detection/grounding system. responders were working on a cure for the plague that transformed people. if the brotherhood knew about the threat first they sure didnt do much with that knowledge. It might have been better if they disbanded and boosted the ranks/skills of the other factions.
---
Lol.
---
Level 4, 53 TSE. 
---
And you weren’t suspicious then? Now you are? Lol. 
---
There are enough that play that i can gaurantee at least a few people are genuinely innocent 
---
Everyone is looking too hard into this.  They are going to cleanse all the nuka colas stimpacks and shit that will affect the future stability of the pvp server that they're investing into.  Thats why they said its a very specific list of items.  They dont care about your TSE, they laugh themselves to sleep when the think about how hard they fucked those items.
---
I hate when lower-leveled players try to leech off of other player's work. I don't have to wait for you to get a hit in on my Legendary Ghoul just so you can get the rewards too. 
---
Meh, anyone can do silos solo.
---
never said I was quitting
---
but have you ever heard of the expression "pulling the plug"?
---
Is this a filthy casual I see? 
---
Scrap everything? You haven't been playing long enough. That response easily shows. 10 ft from your door and you can EASILY farm plenty of dirty water in around a minute. It's not hard to figure out.  
---
Learn to blue print your CAMP. 
---
Holy shit, I didn't even think of that!  Wow that would just be something else lol, like throwing gasoline on the fire.
---
ASSumptions get you nowhere.
---
Someone else mentioned this too, good info to have if any of my friends play the game again, thanks for chiming in and not telling me I should move my camp closer to water heh
---
Listen to responder tapes again.  Scorch was thought to be a myth the BoS made up to take supplies away.
---
&gt;Do you need the gun?
---
&gt;No
---
Okay so just continue talking to yourself and answering your own questions. I’ll just leave the convo thanks. It’s boring me anyway 
---
Welcome to the wasteland. Just pretend another raider robbed you of your ill gotten gains in the middle of the night. Easy come easy go. Just go farm more. 
---
Glad get all the whiny bitches out of here 
---
Duppers have like 10 million bobbleheads for example, how is that good for the game?  BGS can delete everything as im concerned.
---
Super mutants are your most reliable source
---
(Not an amazing drop rate, but it’s decent enough)
---
Am I the only one that feels hours of downtime may be an understatement considering the size of that task.
---
Aww thought this post was going to be about maximizing a razorgrain harvest
---
man I just gave you 100 screws and 8 fusion cores that you and your friend argued about when they were all for him since I heard you two bitching as I was loading in. aluminum is everywhere
---
Who are these innocent people you speak of? Every trade board I am a part of screams duper warning and has for months. And I have only been approached once since I started playing shortly after release, and asked to trade and I did not accept (I believed the trade glitch). And I have NEVER seen a Tse in a venders inventory to buy. Or anything out of the ordinary for that matter. So please enlighten me on who you consider “innocent”. 
---
Let me guess. You bought a TSE weapon from a level 2 character, who had hundreds of them and bought it in good faith. Nothing suspicious there. 
---
Melee and get yourself a mr buzzy blade. I can farm whitespring in about 10 minutes max. I just go to the front door of the club house and rev it up and wait for the charge. As they come out my buzz blade rips them to shreds. It puts out about 300+ (had it up to 1K) per tick. I use it on the scorch beast queen. 
---
Yup. Guns work, if you do it right :)
---
Quit defending duped items. You people are ridiculous. 
---
The community wanted Bethesda to delete the duped items, but when the time came that they were gonna do it, everyone started complaining.
---
I've seen also only two TSE, despite doing events and queen anytime I see them up. People who "Legitimately" have an entire stock of legendaries are more mythical than a bug free Bethesda game. 
---
You didn't answer here so my statement must be true. 
---
Please show how only TSE is the only possible gun and without it you can't do anything. 
---
I see this happen more and more nearly EVERYTIME this event starts or I start it myself. Once I see at least 5 people who are below level 30 join I start to regret starting the event or just stop caring about it all together.
---
But this is the problem I have with people saying " i didn't dupe but I spent my caps" . I gotcha u will have wasted those caps but people don't realize if I wernt for those weapons being duped you would have paid way more for them then what u did
---
Cue the uninstallation poetry posts.
---
For real though, I will be curious to see if any of my stuff disappears because I never bought a single item from another player and never picked up anything from any paper bags or suspiciously well stocked suitcases.
---
I suppose it's possible some of the stuff I have that came from robot vendors could be duplicated stuff sold off by other players but I really doubt anyone would have bothered to duplicate any one star non explosive stuff.
---
All my favorite stuff I have I picked off dead enemies though so I'm not too worried.
---
I've been advocating a full reset for months.
---
I have 7 characters across two accounts. 
---
Reset me bro, I'm still playing. 
---
I don't care if I'm the only person left. I like the game and this needs to be done.
---
I don't want the people who will leave over this on my servers anyway.
---
“You didnt answer so I must be right”
---
Lol, that’s not how it works in real life 
---
Haha i dont even know how to dupe something, but u make me laught folk
---
Might as well remove the whole legendary system, it doesn't belong in a multiplayer game in my opinion. More attachments and ammunitions should make guns behave different, for example the ability to craft explosive and incendiary bullets.
---
I am so happy they’re doing this, but unfortunately they’re closing the doors of the barn after all the cows have left. Game integrity is fucked already. This should have happened the week of the first duping glitch. 
---
Only time will tell my friend. 
---
Because once new content is introduced old players will return. Use it like they left to explore, heard shit got real and turned around to come home and help.
---
You have some valid points, although I don't agree with everything you say.  But my dude, if you don't play anymore, why the fuck are you even in here adding your 2 cents to the maelstrom of opinions?
---
They fought well sure, but &gt;!the nuke that they were dead set on using did nothing but trigger the swarm that you hear about in morgantown. the one that they didnt understand why it was happening because it never happened before.!&lt;
---
I actually agree with the overseer. if the factions worked together a bit more rather than be so suspicious of each other (and the way the BoS operated sure as hell didn't help with that) the scorched beast might have been contained and &gt;!the swarm might not have occured because there would have been no need for a nuke!&lt;.
---
I'm in the same boat. Currently have not played in 3 weeks because of lack of content. Killing the queen 5 times a day is only fun for so long and I've done everything else possible as well. 
---
I also used trading as my end game. I built a legitimate shop, made YouTube videos and was all over marketplace. I spent a lot of hours trading and getting the things I have. Now, unfortunately, half of it will probably perish. I, like you, have absolutely no way of knowing what's duped. People say "if he had 1,000 of the same gun its duped." Well no shit. But if someone has only 2 or even 1 single gun, there is still a solid chance it's been duped somewhere down the line. 
---
There is no way of knowing and now we will be punished for our hard work. 
---
Or think about how each weapon has a serial number from the factory that is unique. It does not change when you put a scope on it.
---
Well, guess I'll check if I still have my TSE's I bought from vendors tommorow. And if they'll maybe remove my spare keys. 
---
The whole "dont know who has what was basicly a big prank to combat dupers and see whos a dirty boi
---
New to reddit, what is karma?
---
Surely some whiny bitches will remain. After some big ass drama occurs, most leave, but some stay to bitch later on.
---
I have exactly 0 cards for melee damage, 9 points in strength, and a max level anti armor grognaks. I do damage like no tomorrow on whitesprings ghouls. It’s fucking nuts. 
---
Why do you care? 
---
&gt;have you ever heard of the expression "pulling the plug"?
---
I guess you haven't.
---
Nope, i bought mines from different vendors a lot ago and they have just a couple, not stack, but including if they had a lot is not fait to lose ur gun and the seller is gonna keep the caps
---
Omg right?! 
---
I’m laughing my ass off now.
---
Respond to changes positively on the FO76 Subreddit 0/10     1000 ⚛

Until they nerf those melee builds.
---
This is Bethesda though, they aren’t exactly known for have things go off without a hitch, there’s absolutely no way that there won’t be some form on unforeseen consequence from this.

I don't know, but I'm not sure that's their main priority right now.
---
That's under the assumption that the supers didn't have alts. 
---
I'll be incredibly surprised if they don't delete every single piece of 2\*-3\* assassin armour and every explosive weapon.
---
The RNG isn't even close to random. I've gotten three of the same exact 2\* star level 40 rifles and five of the same 3\* star level 45 crap marine left arms from a specific 3\* level 42 ghoul in the club house.
---
Nice post. It reminds me of when BLIZZARD forgot what made its gameplay classic and amazing and deleted not just one but MULTIPLE legendary skills + cosmetics attached to them from a particular class. For an entire expansion they acted like they were gonna fix a cosmetic remnant they was kept but never did. And then fully and completely deleted the abilities and legendary look players had earned like it was nothing. Talking MAJOR end game investment into the playstyle and visual upgrades for it. Just gone, gone. They squished and primed all the fun elements completely out of the game. Seems like Bethesda is getting a page from their book already by simply grinding down some of the fun choices we had, before we barely even had the chance to use them. Lessons in how to treat any segment of your players THAT terribly, and still expect success and a reputation that is positive. No. No. Blizzard forgot. Don’t be like blizzard. 
---
Damn imagine if you got melee damage perks, what’s the boost you can get from max level perks? 40% or something? I’m not sure 
---
i can see your standpoint, and yes i agree.
---
i can assume we’re both not experts, otherwise we wouldnt be here talking about this, but rather at bethesda or some game developing company right now hahah.
---
but duping an item gives it the exact same RefID as the original item. this is why server stability is such a rampant issue, as well as factoring into the server instability caused by dupers. 
---
if the duped item had a different RefID than its predecessor, than it would be near impossible determining what is duped and what is not, since they all have their own RefID. 
---
Yea, I'll be fixing that tomorrow some time.
---
I get bug fixes and all that is priority but you do realize that there are different teams dedicated to adding content and fixing bugs right?
---
exactly. 
---
Off topic, Keith, how did you get the Enclave tag on your name?
---
You mean pulling the plug on duped items?
---
Man I know it's a bit rough, but it's the only way forward in the right direction.  The concept itself is not revolutionary.  In real life, you buy a car, turns out to be stolen, do you get to keep it?  No.  Do you get a refund?  No.  This is just how it works.  It sucks but we'll get through it bro.
---
The result of upvotes and downvotes. I figured you were keeping a close eye on yours because you replied to your own comment referencing your downvote. 
---
I just find it funny how sure you are that you have duped weapons. Being unaware is one thing but buying weapons that you know are duped you shouldn't be surprised if they get taken away.
---
But you do you.
---
It’s not real. Caps aren’t real. The game doesn’t run out of caps. 
---
Plus duper’s got their accounts banned. That means the caps are gone too.
---
No. I don't know shit about AAA companies.

no problem, its nice to feel heard haha.
---
any specific tape or note I should look for? I dont mind going back and looking. lore is fun. 
---
you clearly don't know just how big the reach of duped items is. just like people didn't know ranged was severely underpowered prior to the nerf, they don't know just how hard their lives are about to become generally speaking.
---
I might be wrong, who knows. I can't see the future. but if I had to guess, it's gonna be even worse than the TSE nerf. dozens of topics about how bullshit the game really is.
---
Sounds like you are.

---
I know you are but what are you?
---
If realism is what you love, just curious what do you think of a .308 machine gun doing half the dammage than a Thompson submachine gun (.45), a .50 caliber machine gun (presumably 50 BMG) that does 1/4 the dammage as one in .556, or a "combat rifle" that shoots pistol calibers or a magazine swap that magically makes the weapon armor piercing despite using the same ammo as before, a magazine swap that creases fire rate or a Kalashnikov rifle that shoots NATO rounds.
---
Well, they see the right to bear arms not so much as a right, but more of a perk.
---
:D
---
Guess we will find out.
---
How dare you!? 
---
What happens if you sold something that was legit and the caps you got were duped?
---
I understand your point but theres no endgame guns now, if they wanna remove guns cool but make loots better, not all garbage like always, and make all weapons more op, theres no good guns in game, but the only thing that they are gonna do is the first one just to fix errors not to make game better thats what im trying to say

here's your insult, your trying to farm imaginary points by saying the thing that people wouldn't stop fucking saying for three straight months, you swine.
---
no. the servers. long before you're "the only person playing", they'll just kill the servers.
---
I think it was more along the lines of Bethesda not wanting to fulfill thousands of requests for lost items due to a buggy game. It's a whole lot easier to just say "we can't recover missing items."
---
Agree. I don’t want them to go away, but my friends are disappearing quickly. I worry the game is shrinking. 
---
It got down to -2 or something, but thanks for the info
---
you do know it's also ok to like something that is objectively bad, right?  I mean this game is objectively bad, but still fun at times, not at all worth $60 that's for sure...

This event provides that extra XP to level up (I'm at level 119 now).  I usually do it when it pops up if my XP bar is 2/3rds full and nailing a bunch of mole miners will get me over the line to the next level.
---
That being said, I respect when others are in the same area, whether it is at White Springs or Uranium Fever, and use  All Rise in half-swing mode.  I try to hit the miners with full heath and then leave them for the others to finish off.  That way we are sharing XP for the kill.
---
The last two times I tried to join it ended before it began.  Either I've been really late to the event or it glitches.
---
Yaaaay, they managed to squeeze in another anti-end user policy before expending any effort on actually improving the game.
---
For the past 6 months I seem to find new reasons to hate Bethesda with every decision they make.
---
Cause i didn know about duped things until a couple weeks ago, i bought all my guns before, and now im pissed because i spend a lot of money and i didnt know that
---
I'm fairly certain people are gonna find some loophole to get back to duping again. Either way, I just can't wait to see what occurs.
---
Uh oh, guess we better submit a petition asking them not to remove duped items.
---
Yeah I like this game despite what people criticize it for
---
Ehh. I guess because the BoS are all ex military, and I guess total nuclear annihilation is kinda the way they think, in their minds they were doing the right thing by launching a nuke. They weren’t to know it would cause the swarm.
---
But yeah, everyone working together would sure have helped.
---
Because I used to like this game a lot a few weeks ago. All they needed to add was content. No one seems to have any valid agrument to what I posted either, just a bunch of butthurt downvotes. Have fun grinding those one star nocturnal wood armors fellas. 
---
I am pretty sure I'm going to lose my two god tier melees. One I knew was duped and I reported the guy (outing myself) to Bethesda after I saw all the stuff in his inventory. The other one, I thought I got legit, but since it's been traded a lot, I don't have a sliver of a hope I keep it. But that's not really worrying me, I'm at peace with that and it's the right thing to do.
---
What worries me is the what else? I actually run with a few 1\* miniguns since the secondary stars I would like for my shredding build, I never find. Could those be duped? My serums could have been duped. I got them for 500 a piece when people were still charging 1k. Surely they can't strip mutations off. Wouldn't be that bad if they did. I feel all my PA is safe since I mostly ground out the pieces and mods myself. I have bought some mods off of people. Will I lose my helmet cuz the light mod I have could have been duped? I have a hunters long coat. Is it going to poof? I didn't even pay money for it, just traded other cosmetics.
---
I guess I'm much more worried for my less valuable/powerful stuff that really could be legit or duped and I have no way of knowing.
---
I think he stepped away from Twitter because he got so many angry tweets. just a guess
---
Bye.  Can I have your (non-duped) stuff?
---
It’s over there dude.
---
Yeah people are lying to themselves.  If there had been no duping, do you really think you would find TSE weapons raining from the skies even for a few thousand caps?  I mean odds are the vast majority of us wouldn't even have had the opportunity to buy one at any price, they are actually really fucking rare in the game.  We all traded knowing the wares *could* be duped.
---
We’ve seen their ability to program, there is no way they’re low key doing that. They’d have done so many decisions differently. Tomorrow is going to be a nightmare for players. The lost inventories of people entirely are going to be all over this front page. 
---
I hope so, but if they want to remove guns they gotta improve loot drops and weapons damage, all weps are garbage now
---
Correct me if I'm wrong here but wasn't their official position in this about a month ago that it wasn't even possible to do this!?
---
I think this is a great thing but what concerns me is we were told this wasn't possible and we just had to deal with the ruined in game economy and then suddenly *poof* "yeah we're doing that" ... So you lied to us before? Made the player base suffer through that when you could have fixed this before it got so out of hand?
---
The way I see it is like why should I trust them going forward?
---
One way to clear up stash space!
---
Because they have been too  busy to fix the bug they created at the end of January which marks headlamps as Mothman Atom store items.   
---
Thanks fellas! Appreciate it!
---
I think I remember BGS once telling us they couldn't tell the difference between duped and legit items, pretty sire that was why they said they were nerfing TSE to begin with.
---
that's precisely the snarky attitude I'm trying to convey here. you think they can do whatever is unpopular and keep players? even though the count keeps dwindling?
---
games have been taken offline for much, much less.
---
I'm just loving all the idiot's going around calling people dupers because they think Bethesda will fuck this up I am impatiently waiting. But yeah not looking forward to this with the current track record of Bethesda.
---
So how exactly are we supposed to know what was duped and what wasn't?
---
I'll bet you $100 you can't identify 100% of the items in my inventory that are going to be gone tomorrow.
---

Nice pad, very nice.
---
I ditched my teammate last night to go play with a bunch of kitties. 
---
thanks! it was a bit of a pain in the ass to build but it paid off :)
---
Dee! Get over here!
---
It's almost like when people buy stolen goods. Just because you paid money for it and it gets taken away from you doesn't mean you get your money back from who sold it
---
Most players aren't part of a "trade board".
---
Most players of any video game don't follow forums or reddit, have not seen the drama around duping, they just... play.
---
People, myself included, just wander in this game and occasionally stumble across camps built around trading (how I got my first TSE, likely duped, likely gone tomorrow. Wasn't til later I found out about duping.) As the game kinda... intends, pushes the player towards what all the hype around "players stories" was about.
---
People sell their excess to in game tradebots, no way for a casual player to know that was duped when they bought it from tradebot.
---
I could go on, but I have a sammich. Suffice to say you, me, the people on reddit and the people with knowledge of this shit in no way represent the majority of the playerbase. Unless you believe the subscribed counter for this sub is actually representative of the game's global population across 3 different systems. So the vast majority likely just... bought a thing. No way to know their time an effort would be nullified months later.
---
You’re right. Stop playing this game. That’ll show them!
---
O.O
---
I wanna know that spot on Xbox lol. Every 2nd lobvy I join now my house across from Top of the World station is taken.
---
It never used to be!
---
Ya, I am concerned small time dupers will be ignored.
---
right, but to be real, most of the criticism is warranted
---
Have this same issue still 
---
Ryzen 2700x 
---
Have tried everything i can think of but still happens
---
If the item is duped, it'll just *fwoosh* disappear into thin air.
---
Bethesda: We want a player-based economy. Vendor caps are low to encourage player-to-player trading
---
Also Bethesda: What were you thinking, trading with other players? 
---
They may also be checking the server logs after this announcement and waiting for the "guilty" to be frantically selling off and dumping their items?
---
Not all TSE weapons are duped, while 90% were, there still is that 10%. 
---
Then again, most are not concerned with the TSE weapons, most are worried that other items that were less popular during the duping phase may have been duped as well.
---
For example, I bought a bloodied explosive handmade a week ago for 5000 caps off another legit player. I made those 5000 caps from vendoring junk over a span of five days. Say for example it goes missing as it was probably duped a long time ago.
---
That makes me innocent, doesn't it. It isn't a TSE weapon and it isn't broken OP, however suitable for my build. If it gets removed, I will be screwed and just like you. I stayed very far away from any duper and all that mumbo jumbo. 
---
Bethesda  programming a script = all your pubes fall out.
---
I really don't understand it.
---
It feels like there's someone in management who's job it is to be "FUN POLICE".
---
Liked TSE?  Nope, triple nuke nerf into the dirt.
---
Liked White Knight?  Nope, let's nuke nerf that too.
---
Oh, you're a trader???????  We've got a SPECIAL TREAT for you tomorrow.
---
FML I want to like this game but whoever is in charge is an idiot.
---
People were asking for more stash space. Am I right?
---
Better to put them out of their misery than let them continue to suffer this game.
---
Based on your picture I'm probably near the hill close to the vault.
---
I have plans too, many plans.

Yes please on that armor idea, with one addition. Let me swap between how you have it, and sorted by body part:

 - Right leg : combat armor

 - Right leg : Leather armor

---
They couldve hit that nasty nae nae on us you never know companys have done such in the past to combat people exploiting games
---
Nobody gives a fuck about your shill damage control story.
---
LOL most duppers used alt accounts and washed their caps which theyll still keep. People duped nuka colas for the caps. Now many peoples money and items will disappear from the game entirely when they stop playing. This is a superficial fix that doesnt punish the worst offenders and in no way fixes the fantasy economy.
---
Good point maybe I'll get a cheap legendary that doesn't suck for once, even if just for tonight!
---
it's based off the item ID. every item has an unique ID that's generated with the item itself, so all they have to do is check for 2 (or a million) of the same ID and delete all of the entries.
---
used serums don't have an ID. once the mod is applied, the ID is (probably) scrapped.
---
lmao
---
B-but, this is going to kill the game uWu
---
Sorry if you lose your item, but we all know the risk of buying items from unverified sources.   
---
Expect it to be gone, but if it's not you got lucky. :)
---
Lol 
---
Daddy sama owo me to sleep
---
Time to see if something I bought was duped
---
The market was saturated with duped items. It's pretty obvious that those items could become volatile one day. 
---
Well the thing is, if you enter a marketplace that has a metric ton of TSE weapons being traded, and TSE items are supposed to be very rare, you are making the decision on your own liability to purchase something you know has a chance of not being legit.
---
I go to a real life market.  It's full of stalls selling Rolex watches for cheap prices.  Some are ridiculously cheap, some are just so-so cheap.  But I know a real Rolex costs a lot of money.  So even though I'm not Law Enforcement or a watchmaker I can reasonably assume that at least *some* of what I might buy here is not legit.  I mean c'mon.
---
I have a desire to get all my stuff myself. Except like 5 serums. I was not going to grind to get the perfect setup. I don’t even get stuff I need from friends. 
---
Just picked 1 up for 500 caps lol.......deffinatly duped bro-_-
---
I’m going to finally discover that people that set up “camps” (turret farms) outside Whitespring Golf Club are douchebags
---
Nah it was already dead. It's just going to drive away even more of the nosediving concurrent players.
---
Did you believe that they actually could not see player inventories and that items in them didn't have unique IDs or creation timestamps? That's on you. 
---
Yea, why even bother with a pipe rifle that can't one shot a boss.
---
Try getting a TSE anything.  All of my friends have hundreds of hours in the game.  Thousands of legendary enemies killed.  Hundreds of queens killed.
---
For what?  Garbage.
---
I just got a 3 Star Grognak Axe from my last queen fight with perks so bad I'm dumping it.  I won't even give it to a newbie.  No noobie needs to be weighted down with this trash.
---
The fight before that?  Same.  The fight before that?  Same.
---
The reason people duped is it's IMPOSSIBLE to get good build items for your character.
---
So what about those who spent 25k caps before the dupe glitch came out like myself for a single weapon? 
---
i am very very picky about where i place my camp for exactly that reason! 
---
I don't sell heavies, I've relied on Bear Arms for a long time, but plenty of \*, some \*\*, and even some \*\*\*, of any and everything, to vendors.
---
My guess is that it’s looking for legendaries that are the same and stockpiled.
---
It may not fix everything but it will piss off a ton of cheaters and that's what I'm most looking forward to. 
---
:'('''''"''''''''

nice! hello there neighbor !

I have fired 2000+ rounds from my gatling gun, which i am not even properly built for and it hasnt broken on my yet. 
---
I keep 100 stimpacks on my person at a times, hope they don't think I'm duping.
---
I watched four sections and I saw him showcasing and explaining one bug each time, using multiple example of the same thing.
---
He is not showing 1001 bugs in this video.
---
wouldn't be surprised. 170,307 Vault 76 dwellers with only 3,068 exploring Appalachia is not enough to keep the servers alive, you know.

Detailed reply, A+
---
Dont worry participation medals will be given out.

You assume they can fix duping.
---
They can just run the script every maintenance instead.
---
Jesus Christ on a ritz cracker don’t scare me like that.  I love Super Duper and am perked out. 
---
Wow typical republican responce. Screw you and screw bethesda for hurting people who cant tell off the bat their shit was duped. This is just another nail in the coffin. Ive already charged back on this game since they wont refund it and didnt sell me an as advertised game.
---
now you are talking about balance vs realism. I mean technically speaking then the Thompson should jam A LOT because they were known to with drum mags. The MG42 "Buzzsaw" is weak I will give you that but you are talking about a balance issue where volume of rounds on target-DPS to single shot-DPS there is no excuse that a gun CAN'T have a realistic reload animation.
---
serums are crafted, don't worry about those, most players that sell them actually craft them. They said that a small portion of accounts will be deleted, plus if you know the source of ur weapon/ gear. U shouldn't be in any probelm.
---
which variation?
---
Love how dupers are calling themselves traders now lol
---
Read the post about duper’s read the post about how they dupe until the server crashes are these maybe the disconnects you are blaming Bethesda for?
---
I don't like this idea. Please send that with your feedback.
---
Great idea! That will quiet down all the negativity. And the paid shill controlled reddit squad can fool more people into handing over money for this trash game.
---
I made a similar post condemning dupers and was also downvoted by the people already in their feelings. Keep fighting the good fight brother. 
---
This is bullshit. I hope this game fails and goes offline.
---
Ignore major flaws but target the doopers 
---
This all but guarantees they will fuck something up big time.  
---
What I find funny is that Bethesda says they don't have the tools to give people back items they lost, yet they're removing items. 
---
Nope, all of that goes into the burning dumpster fire this game has become.
---
I used to help noobies out all the time with extra legendaries.  Apparently trading and giving people things is VERBOTEN.
---
Fun police, please come arrest this guy!
---
Only the cheaters will quit, looking forward to it! Godd Howard be praised. 
---
Yup, I'm down for a full reset.
---
Would be fun to plan builds and level with my friends from scratch.
---
Yep, my thoughts exactly.
---
Doubtful they don't drip anymore remember, why un-nerf them when the can do a quiet further nerf of them.
---
Its probably targeted to stacks of items so great that you couldn't possibly have that many items even if you created one of that item every second the game was live since launch.
---
It isn't impossible. I found good build items for my character.
---
Wasn't aware that there were multiple ones; the one that was causing the server crashes and that has been patched. 
---
The paid shill squad are sure doing overtime today.
---
If you have 15 agility and the sneak card light armor is overkill.  I sneak effectively in power armor. 
---
I just wanna know if that rl sledge is foam or hard plastic/resin
---
If they can purge once, they can purge once a week.
---
100 bobble heads isn't unrealistic, I've kept every one I've found and I think I have a few hundred total, 1,000 of one type, now that's unrealistic 
---
 Oops I just duped your post 
---
No, it’s not. At all. Every server I play on has a breadth of players from “fresh out the vault” to level 150+ Nearing or at capacity, with maybe the exception of *really* late at night on a server I’ve spent several hours on. Just becuase this reddit is such a wasteland of hate doesn’t make what your saying true. 
---
I’m telling you to prepare to get hosed you just watch 
---
No you won't couse all your friends will ditch this game
---
See,  you being an "evil ninja" should allow me to hunt you down. Nobody is stopping you from continuing to be an "evil ninja" but now you and I as evil ninja's need to be BETTER NINJAS because someone may come for us an the ninja loot. 
---
I shall upvote you against the wave of downvotes. 
---
Basically if you have any tse weapon your a duper
---
If they can purge once a week, they can purge once a day.
---
Hahaha yeah.  Post didn't last 15 seconds without a downvote.  Some butthurt folks on this sub for sure.
---
Glad you like to see your game die... because that is what you are glad about.  The already dwindling player base dwindle further.
---
You are most likely a solo player and do not like the other people anyway so doesn't effect you right?
---
A perfect time to take a break from reddit for a few days.
---
ahaha this was good :)
---
Your last line is just gold. 😂
---
lmao! Stash space resolution confirmed
---
I got my tse for 1500 caps dude was having a sale. So if someone bought something from a vendor they shouldve said no way am i buying that, its a 3 star good item! Id rather run a nuke zone for the 50th time and hope i get something after an hour of grinding cause i should know everythings duped and its gotta be duped and im a good boy who only plays fairly. Are you just delusional or that big a narcissist? Get off your high horse cause you were reaping the benefits of those dupes in every nuke zone and sbq fight.
---
Whats gonna happen tomorrow? 
---
Right because these fuckos at Bethesda have their act together and know what they are doing.  Good one 
---
You people are just mad cause your game you defended so hard is dying and you cant keep up with the constant negative things bethesda does so you just resort to telling people to leave. 
---
It worked for Frank Horrigan.
---
Considering how old the engine and code bases are, I’d be surprised if they even used git.
---
I'm clutching my pearls as hard as I can.
---
I will give you that (items that may have changed hands multiple times). In my mind sub par weapons were not duped, no profit. Everyone wanted the god tier items. But I have never stumbled across a trader. I have also never seen anything unusual at a vender not that screamed duped. 
---
Do they drop radium rifles?
---
Nope. Only time it doesn't happen is if I am only selling 1. Anything more than that and it pays me half price for silver :/
---
So at least 23 other people. Wow that's a lot of people.
---
Only 2 shot? not tse? Problably not i've looted plenty of them.
---
Your talking about a company that couldn't even be bothered to fix bugs still here from as far back as FO3, bugs that have been fixed by the communities unofficial patches, so not like they can't be fixed. They even have a bloody road map on how to fix them and haven't.    
---
&amp;nbsp;    
---
I was tempted early on to try the damn bow dupe from the Elder Scrolls titles when I saw a crossbow in game.
---
So we should just not use a mechanic in the game and completely avoid trading cause bethesda is a shit company so they punish the players?
---
Cya, EA has a Warframe they'd like to sell you.
---
Not all:
---
&gt;These removals are highly-targeted at a specific list of items.
---
Exactly this. I've traded heavily in game (both bots and players) because of how awful the RNG is. Legit players will be out their gear and caps, while the people who created dupes get to keep their caps and gear. 
---
Dude just go on YouTube 
---
Yeah, I'm a trader too. I'll be curious to see what in my inventory is duped and what isn't. The only way to get a full set of an armor set is by trading -- I'll see how many pieces I have left tomorrow.
---
That said, there are two problems with how this is being handled:   
---
First, Bethesda made it clear that they wanted a player-based economy.
---
Second, when widespread duping started happening, they waited for weeks before even beginning to address the problem.
---
They should have been on top of the duping -- that would have prevented god-tier items from becoming the standard to begin with. I'm not sure punishing people for playing the way they themselves said they wanted the game to be played is really the best course of action.
---
Servers are gonna be offline so Bethesda can try and get rid of most of the duplicated weapons. Since trading is a popular pastime in this game, people surely will have unintentionally, maybe even intentionally, gotten their hands on a duplicated weapon. People are pissed at Bethesda for doing this, even though a week prior, everyone wanted them too.
---
I questioned the reasonableness of having mods from both subs when rumour threads that were always OK on Fallout were not being addressed recently on Fallout 76. That's not a conspiracy theory, the implication being that mods were being lax in their duties. Conspiracies are about important things not what mods do with their time on reddit.
---
It's not a self-awareness problem when you're conjecturing my intentions for me, maybe you should take your own advice. xD
---
Will definitely give you a shout. 
---
Nah. I'll be playing Resident Evil 2 and the Division 2.
---
Fair enough, but he's kind of a special case given that the enclave spent a lot of time tinkering with him genetically and assumingly his gear as well.
---
Though you are right. He sets a good precedent for super mutants in power armor.
---
For you, I have a 3 star TSE Shotgun. 5 caps. Really though, PLEASE, nobody wants them anymore and I'm up to the ceiling with inventory.
---
Wouldn't that make you feel vindicated?
---
Aren't you happy?
---
Losing the junk was just a catalyst for the idea, I don't care about losing stable or unstable flux in a nuke zone. If I did this posts tone would be completely different. I just think having a 1v1 pvp deathmatch if a death bag is taken would be a fun addition.
---
Idiot 
---
I know what they're going to do.  They're going to take any items they "think are duped"..........so same condition bar and perks............and delete them ALL.
---
Too bad if you got a good item from a legit drop but it matches those criteria.  Or didn't know an item was duped.  ALL GONE.
---
No they aren't 
---
There's lots of liars on this sub that just want to attack Bethesda and the game 
---
Sadly just the way it is till they move on to the next game 
---
Damn what's your setup?   
---
The video was silky smooth, and since the December and Jan "performance" patches I've gone from 100 FPS to 30's and trying to resolve it!  
---
Thanks,'I'll add these to the UI bug list (and likely weapon) with the video later 
---
Cool guns?  So this game was all about having the coolest gun for you?
---
I am perfectly happy with my nerfed single shot explosive hand made. It does the job for me. I enjoy the game.
---
No its not dumbass
---
So say we all.
---
Yeah, because nobody in this game can trade right?  Not without duping right?
---
I hope you enjoy the dumpster fire while it lasts.  With the customers leaving and money drying up, it won't last long.
---
Not really, not everyone knows duping is a thing.  I even bought my items before the prices got really low.
---
Duping is still in the game. Different things started being duped after the weight limit was implemented, but very light weight things suddenly started flooding the market.
---
It's a game, not an airport. No need to announce your departure. 
---
That's my thinking as well.  They keep making the game less fun.
---
What have they added since launch that actually makes the game *better*?  The stash limit and the "(known)" tag on plans.  Unless I'm missing something, that's it.  Everything else has been an attempt at fixing a bug, or some conscious decision that makes the game less fun.
---
Took me 185 levels to get a full set of weightless armor.  Been grinding and trading.  I will be very upset if they take it away.
---
You guys act like reddit is the definitive source for judging the numbers of active players. It’s not. We are a small fraction.
---
Have any TSE?  Any Bloody Explosive?  What about Assassin / Cavalier armor?
---
If the answer is no, you don't have good items.
---
why you trying to offload before they remove all your stuff? lol
---
I traded for a TSE gauss a couple months ago, but I'd be fine losing it if it is a dupped weapon. Though I'd still be a bit sad to lose it, it's much better for the economy and playerbase.
---
No it's a trainwreck, and I'm jumping off.
---
Uhm yeah this game is about get good gear, theres no story, im not asking to do 1500 damage but all the weapons do less that 100 with perks, so is like to shoot with bb guns
---
Also, in your own words/ beliefs could be said that you shouldn't be notified if parts of your camp are destroyed by another player unless you witness it, because it's crazy to assume your Rad Shower has a lojack on it.
---
Which one of us is going to be losing items tomorrow?
---
Just got one the other day. Took 2 weeks looking
---
Glad you like to see duplicated weapons everywhere... because that is what you are glad about. The already dwindling player base dwindle further. 
---
Do you really think Reddit represents the majority of FO players?!?
---
How do you even balance a game properly when a half the people are using duped super weapons and the other half are using 1* handmedowns they wrestled away from a hobo by the Ice Cooler near the Golf Club?  You gotta start somewhere, this is where it starts it seems.
---
I know that you meant it as a joke, but i doubt Todd himself is making any decisions on Fallout 76.
---
No, it wasn't obvious.
---
I wouldn't have done FIVE HUNDRED PLUS trades if I knew they were going to mass delete items.
---
I would've SKIPPED TRADING altogether.  Not worth even one minute of time.
---
Cause the stupid ass devs couldnt fix thhier shit game we shouldnt use a game mechanic? Wow you fucks are dense.
---
I will, cya bro.
---
Legendary weapon/armor bought from vendors is going to be Russian roulette. 
---
... 
---
Meh. It’ll be disappointing but not irreplaceable. Will this affect super duper triggered items? I will find out if my ammo count goes down significantly
---
This was someone who saw it the day after I posted about it. He considered buying the item for me, but wasn't sure we were on the same platform. 
---
Just because my items aren't sn't TSE, Bloody, Assassin or Cavalier doesn't necessarily mean they're shit.
---
It was just a joke 😅
---
Fallout has always had it's share of bugs and issues, it's a trainwreck that I'll always love. Perhaps it just isn't your cup of tea and that's okay too. 
---
They wouldn't accept the blame for it, and they sure as hell wouldn't apologize. They would say that everything worked as intended and to check out the Atom Shop!
---
They’re ok when they work. I like the Harpers one. I’ve had the watoga one break a few time. 
---
No, I intentionally avoided highly populated areas of nuke zones (especially pre nerf) because I couldn’t race people with duped shit, so I never benefited from duper’s and duped gear. It was detrimental to my game experience.
---
You people bought godroll weapons, knowing a dupe exploit was happening. If you thought for a second that out of thousands of duped GODROLL weapons, YOURS is the one that was gotten legitimately, you're just hooping mental gymnastics to remove your part in trivializing the difficulty of the content and the destabilization of the player made market. 
---
Haven't seen the new lists yet. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
I know that you meant it as a joke
---
The dense mod is pretty awesome. I'll take that compliment.
---
Because rampant cheating in a multiplayer game affects everyone. If you're playing a single-player game, cheat all you like because you're the only one affected. 
---
Just as i stated in the beginning of the comment
---
Well, I'm an in game vendor that is part of a very large guild. 95% or more of our stuff is legit farming from our members that pull it into a few of our in game shops, so most of the inventory is now mid-level but good loot. HMU to see what's available. 
---
No, this game is about survival.
---
Surviving in the wastes with what you find.
---
There is a story.  It was a good story.  There were even great side stories.
---
Sorry, but the person with the most caps and "best" guns doesn't win this game.  
---
Remember this next time you play a game that had millions of duped items.
---
&gt; He is not showing 1001 bugs in this video.
---
He is certainly showing many more than 50. 
---
Care to try to pedant your way out of that? 
---
This is why it sucks having the level 42 ghouls spawn along with the level 62 bloated ghouls when you're high level.  If it ends up with the game choosing the level 42s to be Legendaries instead of level 62s the loot is garbage because it can't even be level 45.
---
I was implying Todd making the decisions was a joke too
---
They were kind of discrete. They wouldn't really post their activity of duping, but once they fixed the weight glitch and the dupers maxed out, they started to move their items and caps to other characters on their account. Mules. When they started to get carried away, they began to vendor with the mules which revealed crazy amounts of duped items.
---
Right before the first ban on dupers. They were throwing their stuff everywhere. A friend of mine actually called me to tell me he found 10000s of items lying around. Had I not warned him to drop the stuff, he would have been banned lol.
---
They still dupe btw, that is how u see the $ items selling on ebay, but with alot more discretion.
---
Then why couldn’t they restore lost power armor or the multitude of other items people have lost?
---
Me too. We should demand a full reset! :)
---
Wtf is that
---
I'd be fine losing half of the shit in my stash box. Thing's cluttered up with a bunch of trash.
---
Well, then it was probably legit right? I’d be less concerned for sure.  
---
What about legit players that have been squeezed out of the market?
---
Oh, ok
---
Yeah lets all laugh at good old Bethesda and their buggy games. He he he. Oh silly old Bethesda and their funny buggy games. I heard it on the internet so it must be true. He he he. It just works!
---
Nothing wrong with buying a few items from folks here or there, it's not like you can tell they're duped in such small quantities. But buying huge stacks of rare items?  That's on them and they should know better.    
---
It's explicitly stated in their terms of service that taking advantage of or participating in an exploit is forbidden, and it's required that you report it.  Feigning ignorance doesn't cut it either.
---
Yeah, I have no idea what will disappear tomorrow.
---
Probably most of the items I worked the HARDEST to trade for.
---
This sucks :(
---
False.  
---
Each item gets its own unique ID, previously Bethesda said they couldn't track them easily for this exact reason.  
---
   
---
They've likely used one of the methods (guess work here folks) that involves looking for items with identical durabilities for example, or weapons with the same legendary combo created at the same time, etc
---
Do you have multiples of those cards? Idk if they fixed this yet but some of the cards are just broken when there's multiples of the same card in your choices.
---
There is no reason. Buy Anthem 
---
This is probably why it's "Buyer beware" and not "Duper beware".  In the end it's just not gonna matter much, it will only sting for a short while.  If you really like the game you will keep playing and you will still be able to kill things and have fun.
---
I wonder why it has taken this long? Better late than ever ! Definitely will log in to see if my friends "really" did find a TSE shotty, if not then I'm gonna have a nice laugh.
---
It is a website where you can buy various in game items such as caps. For ps4 you can buy 1000 caps for $1.20
---
Dupers who sell in game items for real money
---
Theres already a swarm of self righteous posts today. I dont have any duped items but i sure did get alot of xp and loot from those dirty dupers killing all those tough enemies for me now let me post about how much they suck even though i owe my level and many items to them.
---
Well, community managers say that they're finalizing the roadmap. But who knows
---
As far as I know, using any mod will get you banned, even some of the smaller ones.
---
I think I have an extra basic picklock but never equipped it.  Severely butthurt at the moment...
---
Idk if its legit or not but ima get like a lil caps to see if its legit and if not i obly lose a lil bit.
---
I've been playing since Fallout 2 in '98. You either learn to love the bugs or you move on. It's not for everyone. 
---
So given this, one would think they could also identify the toads who duped.  I would suggest they also accompany this action with mass bans.
---
I assumed they were going to let it die 
---
I work for one of the world's most profitable tech companies. We absolutely would not leave a bad bug more than the absolute minimum time it took to hotfix it
---
Duper issue aside, it breaks TOS by involving real currency for in game items/currency. 
---
Only if they refund caps to players wrapons they legit bought otherwise lawsuit. 
---
Yesterday they said they will have a roadmap for 2019 by the end of the month or so.
---
I've been asking for it for awhile. 
---
Since they are going this route we can pretty assuredly assume it's not in the cards.
---
Would using u4gm be  counted as a mod?
---
Wtf is that?
---
No, because they said it only affects a small percentage of accounts.  Nearly every player has experienced camp dupe I'd imagine.
---
I see
---
My concern is my alts More so but I wouldn’t be surprised if my legit ones from before could still be effected. Have you seen this games track record before? The nerf already made me never wanna come back lol
---
They waited for weeks because it did not affect them making money.....Then it did.
---
&gt; the implication being that mods were being lax in their duties
---
You complained, and got gold for, saying that all of the negativity and 'trolling' here is being *allowed* because the mods hold that attitude. 
---
See: 
---
&gt;So I have to ask myself, why do we have these same mods here when this sub was supposed to be different? The balanced sub? Can these people actually create and enforce different policies in both places and remain completely unbiased?
---
Try your bait and switch bullshit elsewhere while you are at it. 
---
Probably a pretty good chance their items are duped and will be affected by tomorrow’s dupe purge. So why bother?
---
Step1 is remove items and rollback the version. Step 2.....Step 3 GOTY
---
Broooooo I made this same example an hour ago!
---
Oh, so you're really laughing at other's misfortune.
---
Nice.  Hope you enjoy the dumpster fire this game has become before they shut it down in a year.
---
So there are two people that complain? Sorry couldn't pass up the price plummet joke. Resume regularly scheduled posting and good day.
---
being a smartass ain't gonna help. if you like the game as much as you say, you *should* be concerned.
---
covering your eyes and blocking outside noise is not gonna save your two accounts.
---
You do know that tons of people who havent duped have duped items and dont even know right? 
---
Oh yea... ok ill look into that 
---
We can only hope it will.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
I have this same problem. I'm using a Radeon VII graphics card and i7 3770k processor. The only thing that crashes my PC is fallout 76 on ultra and it's a pretty bad crash; other random processes tend to die at the same time. Furmark, prime95 are stable for 6+ hours. Takes a loooong time to load and when it loads it glitches out and crashes or just immediately crashes.
---
What's happening here is you can't even imagine a world where people have so much disposable cash in their entertainment budget that it makes more sense to pay money to skip boring or random parts of their activities.  Hey I get it, I eat the mac'n'cheese to my dude!  But trust me when I say that there are people playing video games as a fun hobby that definitely have more than enough for this to make total sense.  You have to widen the scope of your perspective in gaming.
---
Given the last couple of patches it's possible I'll log in to find 100,000 new TSE Handmades :)
---
I havent tried it yet, i just wanted to get some feedback from other players
---
If someone's that attached to the particular amazogun that they use, then they're missing out on a lot.
---
So the logs claim. Yet Mutants ARE congregating there and seem rather protective of the place. There's an in-game event to find the source of the Super Mutants, and it leads right there.
---
We know that the Neutralizing Agent was added in a rush. Unless I'm forgetting something, there's nothing to indicate they stuck around to make sure it was effective. It may have simply failed to completely neutralize one or more of the vats. 
---
Also, given the Corperate Ethics in this game, it's perfectly likely that West Tek told their employees there was a failsafe (the neutralizer agent) when none actually existed, just to shut them up. They may have dumped jello in there for all we know.
---
Frankly, the Mutants have to be coming from somewhere. The best other option is that they immegrated in... which is kinda weird..
---
That made me laugh, upvote for you.
---
I've been playing survival games for 10 years now.
---
Name ONE survival multiplayer game that DID NOT have a duping problem?
---
I've never seen a company go in and just mass delete things in ANY other game I've played.
---
what? why'd I want the game to die?
---
I want Bethesda to get screwed over for the incompetence, yeah. but at the cost of the game.
---
My friend, until the "Black Tuesday" patch killed my ability to trade due to being overweight I did massive amounts of trading...   
---
And my rule was no-TSE's....   
---
Especially the ones on the "known" list... 
---
The level 35 2* TSE handmades... The Lvl 45 3* TSE handmade with aimspeed, etc..  
---
I know many other Merchants who took the same stance, because you can't claim ignorance when we are all on Reddit, and we all know what the commonly duped items were...    
---
Basically the golden rule of trading applied here..   
---
**"if it looks too good to be true it usually is"**
---
Is not about win something, is about have end game stuff that u deserve after 155 levels, maybe u like to spend 500 hours and have shitty guns but i dont think thats fair
---
I was one, and I'm still skeptical, and now quite amused at this whole thing.
---
Unless tomorrow's patch re-fixes several loopholes..
---
The cheaters already quit cause they got bored. Lots of people leaving isnt good for anyone. Less effort will be put into the game with a smaller base. This is a game most people play solo so i fail to see how all these dupes are ruining other peoples experience. Trolls dont need a tse to trash your camp.
---
The only things I have that have the possibility of being duped are two rifles that I bought from vendor bots. They're not TSE, though, so the chance isn't terribly high that they were duped. If I log in tomorrow and they're gone, I'm okay with that. I'll find something else.
---
That's an interesting theory.  I'd be curious to know how much stuff got shifted around over time.  I would say that in terms of accessibility, Top of the World is a mess for low-level players.  There are so many quests that congregate there, along with the two vendors, in the Savage Divide which has no enemy cap.
---
I said player trades.
---
And Bethesda isn't targeting them.  It'll be people with stacks of rare crap they've no business having all at once.  And as I told someone else, if you bought a giant stack of too good to be true loot, you should have known better and feigning ignorance won't work.
---
I can't wait to see the people acting like they've never bought dupes from robots or players tomorrow... Guaranteed that they'll be upset when they lose their gear too. 
---
like I just said, this sub is one of the last remaining active Fo76 communities. it's a pretty good representation. why do you think Bethesda actually has a foothold here through CMs?
---
Have to get the point across somehow.  Apparently the Fun Police don't read too well.  Gotta make it simple statements in LARGE text for them to understand.
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if having an Atom shop skin on a duped item protected it from this purge.  I have my doubts about them being able to pull this off without fucking it up somehow.
---
It turns out that TSE items are actually pretty goddamn rare when not duped.  It's crazy!
---
Having a favorite gun is missing out?
---
Spending 500 hours is the game.  Shortcuts are unfair. Earn it and be proud, or shortcut and get punished.  Your choice.
---
Is there a new duping method 
---
That's awesome. Thanks for your efforts. 
---
Well this one is. Deal with it and quit buying duped items.
---
I feel like all the issues they’ve had plus player outcry on various matters has severely forced them to alter their previously planned roadmap. Maybe they planned to go all-in on PvP but the amount of backlash from the player base may have them retooling their roadmap to accommodate the PvE majority... or whatever... idk.
---
You realize that people sell shit to vendors, right?
---
Git gud
---
I've been trying to get my wife and friends to play MH World, Warframe, FFXIV, or Apex with me, but they just love Fallout too much to play anything else.
---
This is my favorite Fallout though (as a theory crafter/min maxer, repeating the first 10 hours of scripted NPC dialogue every time I want to try a new build idea in the single player games is not fun).
---
100% 
---
The famous "they should have know" arguement.
---
Don't worry, Bethesda is working on it.
---
Underrated comment. 
---
Im confused are the removing weapons or something? Ive not been up to date on the 76 news as of late.
---
People aren't quitting because of duped items.
---
People are quitting because there's no content.
---
My friends didn't quit when they nuke nerfed TSE, squashed 100 bugs and created 20 more worse ones, etc.  They left because they're BORED.
---
The only reason I STAYED is because trading was fun.  WAS, past tense.
---
Maybe someone is sharing lvl 2 Squad Maneuvers to the party? (also note the difference between Sprinting Vs Running)
---
Solid like a solid block of salt.
---
Yeah end game content is trash. 
---
No need to get hostile fella. That doesn't change what I said.
---
It’s not that big of a deal. It’s a video game. Bethesda didn’t lock it down enough, people exploited the game and fucked things up. They have no choice but to try to prevent duping and correct the illegal items. 
---
recent news. 7 hours downtime tomorrow to delete duped items.
---
Such a shame. A speed build would be awesome!
---
Thats what bethesda said
---
I'm wondering about plans.  What if they were duped but you already read them?  
---
I have no idea if I did, or not. 
---
But this gross accusation that people who buy items from others are guilty of ANYTHING, is absolute horseshit.
---
This is all Bugthesda's fault.
---
If I'm still playing in a year I would be surprised myself. 
---
I'm enjoying it now though.
---
Ovp will be more even now that assasin sentinal armor will be gone mostly
---
Not hostile at all. In fact, I'm 100% in favor of all dupes being taken away, even if by some chance the shit I've purchased from vendor bots ends up being part of the sweep.
---
Guess I’ll say goodbye to the ammo I’ve bought and my weapons
---
-A dozen dupers trying to get the community on their side
---
I don’t care about the dupe weapons, hopefully this will fix my disconnecting issues
---
Famous?  Ignorance doesn't exempt you from a law.  Here it doesn't exempt you from terms of service.

"No sir, officer, I didn't know the money was stolen.  A hooded man just ran up to me and gave me $50k after running out of the bank.  That means I get to keep the money, right?"
---
Meh, the game is almost dead anyway.
---
You can bet people are selling them to the vendors after they read this patch announcement though...
---
we'll see, then.
---
Agreed. 
---
Have been told that Greg used to have deep pocketed combat limbs. Multiple hops there over 4 days. No variance at all in inventory. 
---
Eh, I'd be down for getting a higher level Sommerset special now that I know about waiting to do the main quest
---
Ammo has definitely been duped like crazy 
---
Now I could be wrong, only time will tell (and the track record isn't great), but the way I see it is the only way to get high end gear that actually helps us kill high end mobs in a normal amount of time, is if they balance the stuff we have available vs the HP/armor ratings of those mobs.  
---
And the only way to even start thinking about properly balancing the game is to get rid of the flood of over-powered weaponry.
---
I'm a modder, been mucking about with Fallout 4 for a few years and the core of '76 is fallout 4, and it functions mostly the same.  
---
Additionally Bethesda said they didn't have he tools to "mine" player saves, and then we (modders) reminded them we (modders) made one 3 years ago..  
---
Headslap was heard from Bethesda, MD to Austin, TX, and that was the last time we heard they couldn't data mine player saves. 
---
I have a Chameleon / +1 STR / Sentinel right leg.
---
It took forever to trade for it.
---
Is it duped?  Would you bet $100 on it?
---
I bet you'll be surprised how much of your "inventory" goes poof tomorrow.
---
Please, be honest. did you know about the dupes? 
---
I don't want to be cruel, or an asshole, but if you knew these were dupes... I mean... Come on.. 
---
But if you really didn't, I have enough credits to give you a refund on PS4 if you lose it. 
---
I'm REALLY not trying to be an asshole, or unfair, but if you knew these were duped and bought one; look in the mirror.
---
I've bought duped things before, knowingly; I accepted the risk and lost out pretty majorly. Wasn't in Fo76, but it was still impactful. 
---
I accepted the loss. If you are legitimately telling me you did NOT know they were duped, AND on ps4, I will give you a 2000cap refund if you get unfairly treated. 
---
ONLY you. I don't have THAT many caps, but I know each cap is legit earned via scavenging and killing mobs in game. 
---
But if you knew it was commonly duped, then please be honest about it. There's no real shame in it; at that time it seemed to be an accepted practice in game by Bethesda and this announcement was a bit of a surprise.
---
I hope you take this as a net positive, but if you legit did NOT know, and you get screwed, I'll refund on behalf of Bethesda. 
---
And yes, Bethesda has pissed me off as well. 
---
I don't care about karma to this at all, it's already negative which is fine. I stand by what I say and I will not back out of it. 
---
And my sentence before the last was purposefully left grammatically incorrect; I am legitimately pissed off at Bethesda for a lot of their actions and lack of action. 
---
If your items disappear tomorrow, you did.
---
If they don't, enjoy.
---
more likely:
---
**For A \*L\*I\*M\*I\*T\*E\*D\* TIME! 1600 atoms you and your friends can open a Vault-Tec Lunchbox!**

included

\-your wood armor
---
\-your tse rolling pin 
---
 WAIT YOU DIDNT HAVE ONE? YOU WILL NOW!
---
I only saw a short amount of Anthem and it didn't look that interesting, but after the shit from this game, at least I know those AAA games are actually AAA and will have some kind of polish to them. Maybe I will look into it further. See if I have overlooked any depth to it that my first impressions missed.
---
Maaaaaybe
---
Hmmm.. Should've just reset everyone. Could've avoided the whole lie of "we cant target specific items." I know damn well the TSE weapon i bought was duped, im not too worried about it getting deleted just kinda wish it was a reset on everyone/everything.
---
They only said that the amount of dupes items is small and not that it is targeted to flagged accounts. Would bet they somehow added an ID to all items so that they get instantly deleted if there are 2 items with the same ID, but it is Bethesda who we are talking about so they will manage to fuck it up someway or another.
---
I believe it was a patch a few months ago that disabled loot leveling to the player rather than the mob.  Could get max level loot from low level mobs regularly on horde events and such.  
---
This made uranium fever immensely popular and a lot of old advice still hasn't updated.
---
Anthem early access baby!
---
That's what you got from what I said?  I pity you for your reading comprehension.
---
I’m just hoping my stacks of UC 5.56 and shells don’t disappear. Took a ton of grinding (and buying violet) to get the materials to stockpile them. 
---
Lol I swear all my weapons will be removed since 90% of all good weapons are duped
---
Lol. Yes... that's exactly the same.
---
It is a good idea. The game has no npcs or conversations or anything like that so it would not be unreasonable to be allowed to be a necrophage for example. I'd love to go through the wilderness like a necrophage and call everyone EY SOFT SKIN!
---
What they should start doing is balance weapon ratings, perks that effect those ratings, and enemy HP/armor ratings for end game.  And the only way to realistically balance it all is to get rid of the unplanned metric shit ton of duped weaponry.  The only other way to go is give everybody a few TSE weapons for free and start balancing from there, and I don't think that is the way they are going to swing it.
---
Must know the plans to craft***
---
I was only at 178% and it took me around 10 minutes to scrap it all.  389% must have taken at least twice as long, and that's science.
---
The crazy thing is that they limited the amount people can carry, which flooded the market with suddenly cheap but good gear, which should have been anticipated. All those folks who bought stuff are going to lose it and everyone who sold it has a ridiculous amount caps spread over their mules.
---
When I get a chance I'll read this R L Stine novel you wrote for me  but for now lemme just say two things. 
---
1.BETH didn't patch anything so you're upset about nothing but some lost junk.  
---
2. Protections are literally the slowest enemy in the game. You can frickin crawl away from them so it's kind of your own fault. 
---
I have no idea why they're focusing on things that are either:
---
A.  Not helping add fun
---
B.  Just making people mad
---
It really doesn't make any sense from a business point of view.  I ran a business for 10 years and I NEVER treated my customers this way.  They would've never come back.  I wouldn't have lasted 10 years.
---
They still eat a lot of ammo and break pretty fast.  I'll be disappointed if the one I got disappears but after the nerf it's honestly not much better than Furious now.
---
this is going to blow up so bad it will top all the other super bad patch prior.
---
dO yOu aLWayS tyPE lIkE dIS in debates? It doesn't add anything to your own arguments lol. 
---
Neither does calling my argument a gimmick. In my short time watching the video, about 15m jumping through, I severeal bugs that aren't gamebreaking or 'extremely visually striking and noticeable', first one I already mentioned:
---
1. Some vanishing paintings on a wall in Whitespring
---
2. Voice chat continuing after a world crash
---
3. Events that pop up when you're not near them (some people would actually want to know about new events even if they're not near)
---
And I would say others like death acrobatic, while noticeable, are just plain hilarious. In the end I don't deny he shows some bad shit, but it's clickbait through and through with the title. 1001 glitches my ass, but please continue with your absolutist point of view. xD
---
The common thing thats in all of the areas where my game freezes... Grafton Monster.
---
How or why this is a thing... "not a clue" 
---
This is gonna piss everyone off because I bet 90% of everyone’s shits duped and they don’t even know it so when everyone’s  armour and weapons are gone this games gonna be dead in a week 
---
I don’t get all the people who are saying they will swim in duper tears. The dupers have hundreds of thousands of caps in the bank and 90% of all of your super good legendaries were probably duped so it’s just gonna screw up everyone
---
And seasons. 
---
Haha. Personal insults... you must be smarter than me for sure.
---
I'm assuming they want to cover all bases first. Idk man. It doesn't make sense to fix the basics first? You had your own business so you would know more than me.
---
Condition 
---
The condition of a object is determined when it first drops, and is connected to a number of factors, including the luck of the finder.  So they simply look for all of each type of weapon, with the legendary effects added, which on its own limits the pool down dramatically, and then add in the condition to figure out what’s really duped, if there are 1-2 weapons all the same down to condition, leave it as it’s probably real, if there are hundreds all with the exact condition, that’s a dupe, remove them all
---
"I never heard an honest man use the word legit" - Carnivale
---
Thing is. I crafted a lot of it due to hoarding steel and a lead deposit and from picking up ammo off enemies. So I’m sure they’ll just take all my ammo away. Right now I have 31,056 of 45 ammo and 11,451 of 5.56 ammo. Even got some from friends and my brother cause we share whatever ammo we pick up off enemies 
---
I'm not suggesting a return to the way they were. Perhaps removing the combination from appearing together and buffing them independently.
---
I'd rather just a full wipe 
---
Or just download Warframe without paying a dime...
---
iv just spent 10k caps ti buy ammo and armor...not very fair if they take it away.. they should provide compensation..ie..i want my caps back
---
Try equipping the extra one in place of the other one and do a full relog (quit the whole app from the ps home)
---
I like your optimism.  Hopefully they do turn things around and keep developing for years to come.
---
Anyone who is good at the game is a duper.
---
I think they probably have separate RefID only b/c I don't think the game can handle multiple items having the same RefID and not instantly crashing.  I base this only on troubleshooting FO4 after loading 255+ mods and trying to track down crazy stuff happening at times.
---
What I think they will do tomorrow is probably a more hands on approach of looking for patterns and indicators that someone has duped items in stash or inventory.  That or hey will literally just delete all TSE style things with a certain creation date(s).  I dunno, we'll see what happens.
---
I bought a TSE lever action about a month ago, and at the time I was excited, but after spending a lot of time on the market discord and seeing that 99% of the TSE lever actions for sale all have the same affixes as mine I'm 99% sure that mine was duped, I'm still going to be pissed if it disappears tomorrow since it was absolutely not my fault that I bought a duped item. If items start disappearing from legitimate players inventories because BGS couldn't be bothered to hotfix the duping issue within a day or two then I'm likely done.
---
what's the term?  buyer beware?  how tf is Bethesda supposed to be responsible for your decisions?  if you bought any 3 star legendary weapon anytime after dupegate (dupocalypse?) that's on you...
---
I've got my popcorn and my sad, sad violin.
---
Oh god, I am laughing way too much at this.
---
 "That's it boys! Release the GOTY edition!"
---
Given that every good legendary in this game was most likely duped I don’t get how it wouldn’t affect us
---
I spent endless hours selling serums and power armor modding services for caps.
---
Just had a guy come in today.  He traded me a nice end-game gun for 5 power armor sets of jetpacks and calibrated shocks.   Completely bottomed out my supply of both flux and mats applying the mods to his armor.
---
That gun he gave me, was it duped?  I'll find out tomorrow :(
---
It's not just items people are losing, but time, effort, mats, everything you traded to get that item.
---
Meh. 
---

😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
---
I'd love a tse rolling pin. They make the tenderest flakey biscuits.
---
Well they did mention also working on server stability at the very bottom of the post. But I am sure you never made it past the first sentence mentioning the deletion of duped items. :p
---
Oh man, I'd love that.
---
Hello, 911, someone just stole all my cocaine.
---
I have no doubt at all!
---
I’m not close to good at this game. I get my butt kicked a lot. I mainly spend my time exploring and doing a few events here and there. And running away from scorchbeast cause I can’t take them on solo
---
That's how I feel about my favorite weapons. If it fixes the problem, take them. Take everything, reset us all to zero. Reclamation Day Part Deux!
---
Lol. Bethesdas motto is "Screw anyone who ever had faith in us." 
---
TBH that combo is nice, but would be surprised if it was a dupe target. I mean unless you know it's duped.  
---
Assassin's/Sentinel, Weightless/STR/Sentinel sure..   
---
But generally I think your wrong...   
---
Mainly because I avoided trading for items that were meta popular, I'd trade items I farmed that were, but I would never trade for Assassin/Sentinel, etc because I knew the combos would be high risk...  
---
TSE's got nerfed and I knew Anti-Armor/Explosive would be the next hot thing, locked down trading for them, and suddenly the market is flooded with AAE weapons.  
---
I'm not special, plenty of other people traded like I did. Claiming ignorance when a deal is too good to be true.. 
---
Will I have some items vanish?  
---
Likely, I got "tipped" a TSE Gatling Gun for making 4 guys a set of Calibrated shocks and Medic pumps for their Power Armor (Before Bethesda invalidated all my hard work farming for the recipes), and I'd not be shocked if that was gone...   
---
But it will mean twice as much if it's not, they honestly seemed grateful, so who knows, maybe it's legit.
---
Yeah talk about a moron statement from OP who is obviously clueless. Owns a duped weapon = must be a super smh
---
Marketing my friends, it works.
---
Okie dokie smart guy. 
---
What they're doing is the equivalent of yanking back products and not refunding the money.
---
If you saw that I sold you a $500 item, but all of a sudden the tracking info went from "On Time /  On Delivery" to "Package Reroute / Return To Sender".  You'd be pissed.  You'd hit my business with a chargeback.  And you'd be right, and I'd agree with you.
---
There is no chargeback here.  Traders just get screwed with no recourse.
---
You expect them to push out new content when they can't even get their current content into an actual working order?
---
Come on now...
---
Action boy andvlone wander are bugged.   You can't receive benefits of both. 
---
It has been an honor trading with you! You have always been fair and generous! You will be greatly missed. Most of my items will be gone tomorrow as well. The best items were duped items (that’s why they were duped). If there is anything I can do for you let me know. 
---
There were tons of known duped items, and generally if someone was willing to let it go for a "good deal" it was duped 
---
Anyone who plays the game is a duper 
---
happy to help. ill be sure to post if i find anything else.
---
an i5 and a 1070, for a 1080p build. 
---
60 fps solid on ultra besides the occasional drop to 24-31 in watoga or whitesprings. 
---
Seriously 
---
I heard that this is not de wey they are tracking duped items
---
I'll probs get Anthem
---
I just space them out. Looks....okay, but they wont fix it so, it is what it is.
---
Yep, whatever items survive the purge are fair game, and with less supply comes increased demand.
---
While I agree they are ridiculously powerful, after tomorrow there may only be a few dozen left in the game so I doubt it would matter much if they un-nerfed it.
---
Yeah but they screwed us vendors after implementing the carry limit so honest trading is pretty much dead 
---
The TSE Nerf was very very poorly done IMHO, won't defend that.   
---
There were several better balance paths suggested and ignored
---
Is it even possible to visually see if someone has a TSE? does it visually even look noticeably different than any explosive weapon? Are people counting shotgun pellets in the air like rain man? 
---
Plus who was the duped item “stolen” FROM in the first  place
---
I guess that mid-level TSE 10mm pistol I got yesterday is going to jump up in value tomorrow lol
---
A lot of the good items I dropped from legendary enemies I traded for things that actually make sense for my build, so I know what you mean, to an extent. I didn’t spend time trading as a vendor like you did. That said, the trading aspect of the game actually made it like more enjoyable 
---
Full screen or borderless windowed?  
---
I clearly need to blow out my *.INI's and consider a reinstall, must find the cause of my performance issues!
---
[Ok don't scare me like that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgd2F2QNfEE)
---
Wait wtf Juicehead is on this sub???
---
I will be honest with you. I have no idea about software programming. I barely pay attention the the salt mine that is this reddit (with a few very good thought out posts detailing ways that I agree would fix this game). I don’t know how to dupe. I don’t watch many YouTube videos about this game, I refuse to give money to haters on the hate train. And I do enjoy playing the game with friend (they are truly innocent. They don’t follow any of this shit, and get all their info from me). And after all this bullshit that is irrelevant to your reply, I am happy to see Bethesda take the steps to try and make the game better, even if they are taking the wrong steps. At least they are trying to do something.  
---
TL;DR I am happy to see Bethesda taking steps to make the game better, even if it is the wrong steps. They are trying. 
---
Talk about "cutting off your nose to spite your face"
---
They specifically say in this announcement that this will be a highly targeted specific list of items.
---
What does that even mean? anyone that has ever traded with any real duper knows that dupers, basically duped everything you could possibly want or need in this game.  
---
The duping was RAMPANT for months.  They are showing us their cards, they could have fixed every aspect of this much sooner, for whatever reason they did not, and now will punish people that do not deserve this over it. The dupers have already laundered their dupes and profited in in-game caps and real world money and gotten out.  You duped and built up 2+ million caps that your currently selling for real-world money, no problem! This won't impact you.  This is only going to impact the innocent gamers who traded in-game caps that they had to really grind (in some cases) to get.  Any duped plans people bought and learned, nope those are learned that's OK they won't be taking those away.  Or if you duped caps (Don't know if that was possible), no that's OK too!  Just specific weapons and armor? 
---
The game has had harsh criticism from the start.   For all kinds of reasons.  You really think if you cause more people out of those left playing this game to leave this will bode well for the future of this game? What exact reason do those left have to talk positive about this game?  Anyone that I have talked about Fallout 76 in the real-world already have a negative opinion about this game.  So piss off some more people to add fuel to the fire, makes allot of sense.   And to those self righteous people saying everyone that has any duped equipment removed that makes you happy.  What you don't realize is, you really think they are going to continue to make content for this game if there is no interest?  They have made mistake after mistake in their handling of EVERYTHING related to this game, this is yet another one in my opinion.
---
After calculating this with my TI-86, I figure the odds are a sloping curve lazily going to the left.  In other words 105% chance it was duped.
---
Anyone who isn’t terrified of some ridiculous unforeseen issues hasn’t been paying attention.  I’ll be pleasantly surprised if this fix works as intended, but after the last patch fiasco I’m skeptical.
---
And of course the caveats:  I’ve not purchased a single weapon from others, nor have I duped.  
---
Just fill the bag with Missiles.
---
It's not lying. The truth is, you don't always know if you can do something until you try. There have been a great many things in my life where I've looked at it and said "Impossible", but then the ideas in my head rolling around and solutions start to crop up!
---
It's more then likely that when they made the statements, they didn't have the tools to do this. So it was in fact, impossible. But, as the problem didn't go away, they started coming up with ways to track these things. 
---
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if tomorrow we find out that only dups after X/X/2019 are getting removed because they have no way to track things before then. 
---
My camp was so over budget, that I couldn't do it in one sitting. I spent over an hour deleting shit and called it quits. The next time I logged on, there was even more shit to delete. That character is beyond my ability to fix. Bethesda needs to fix this issue
---
It's not even that hard to repair your camp
---
I have a hard time believing that since they’ve made it clear through tickets that you can’t “unlearn” Atom Shop plans that you were refunded for. I would assume this means you can’t “unlearn” other plans either since they probably use the same system. 
---
If they can’t even manage that, I can’t see how they are tracking a gazillion unique item identifiers. 
---
Poor kitties. 
---
Great reference!!
---
Beware on random scorchbeast and mirelark queens randomly attacking the area.
---
It's fine. I  may end up with it at some point, but as a dedicated Warframe player for years, I find it pretty funny that everyone thinks Anthem is somehow unique.
---
I'm kind of sad because I was really hoping it was going to be a Sci-Fi version of Monster Hunter World, not a Warframe clone.
---
Meanwhile let's all bitch at Bethesda for not doing enough, right /r/fo76 ?
---
i haven’t had any worse attacks than one or two odd super mutants. i wish i had stronger attackers, i love killing stuff 
---
&gt; In the same post you made it a point to explain why your item probably WASN’T duped, presumably to excuse yourself from that same sort of guilt.  
---
Your reading comprehension is *really bad*. I've already explained my anecdote and its purpose. My consideration of the possibility that the item I bought was duped was not a question of whether I felt "guilty" or not. I was confessing that I would not be a bona fide purchaser because I had doubts about the origin of what I was buying and wondered if it was duped. I knew that I was taking a chance that if it were duped, it later might be deleted from my inventory. 
---
Therefore, I shall not claim to have been "innocent," nor mistreated by Bethesda, if that weapon is missing from my inventory tomorrow.
---
As for who knew and what publicity there has been: There has been publicity about Fallout 76's duping problems in periodicals all over the internet. I know I've seen at least a dozen. Now, maybe there is some innocent lamb who didn't use this subreddit, or more likely the marketplace one, or some other website to find and arrange to meet his seller. Perhaps there was somebody hanging out around the Overseer's Camp whispering, "PSSSST! Dude, would you like to buy a top-level TSE combat shotgun?"
---
But I think you live in a fantasy world if you think that describes most people who bought a duped weapon.
---
This will come down to how wide a net Beth throws out .
---
If they limit it to dupers that have for example (and not limited to) 1000 stacked TSE homemades and delete the whole stack that's great.
---
But if they go to wild and delete every TSE homemade in the current game that will be the death strike to this game.
---
BETH better get this right or this will be an even bigger PR disaster than the last patch was.
---
But I got a helmet on PS4 from a scorched?
---
It has awesome flying mechanics though 
---
So you count and track lvl of every player on every server everytime you play? Doubtful.
---
Maaaaan, people say they’re quitting every day. What else is new, lol. Deleted dupes will just be the new flavor of the week. It’ll be something else next week, lol. 
---
Brass balls, and a can-do attitude.
---
You see an explosion when they start shooting, you can hear it too. It's very very obvious 
---
There's a highly targeted list. I wonder what is on it. Probably all the really good stuff I have. Some of it I got along time ago. Wonder if I'll still have it tomorrow
---
Obviously they could see player's inventories. They just have to run a DB query. But I think they don't version players inventories (versionning data is hard and costly).
---
Right. I can’t wait to upgrade my AAE handmade with a 1* AA handmade
---
I only have two items that were probably duped.  My hunters long coat and a TSE combat shotgun I bought this past week so I could compete with other players using the same weapon to one shot me and take the ammo factory.  Farewell, I barely knew ye!
---
Man I kind of get your point here in that there aren't literally 1001 individual unique bugs showcased in the video but the title obviously isn't meant to be taken literally. It would be kind of weird to title the video "The 151 bugs of Fallout 76" or whatever the actual count is especially as his video is merely a catalog of bugs he experienced in his play through and is therefore by definition incomplete. The title is descriptive hyperbole. "1001 bugs" isn't supposed to be an actual count of bugs in the video its a stand in that signifies "Gee there sure are a lot of bugs in this game". You'd be better off arguing that the title is unnecessarily inflammatory or something because I don't think anyone is thickheaded enough to take 1001 as a real count.
---
Ah then you'll enjoy the area. I killed one of those ugly grey things around there. The faceless thing
---
Well, I'm not got so much resources to repair everything. 
---
And its all depends on what were builded. 
---
Yeah, becuase people that actually enjoy the game just want to read page after page of petulant whining and posts that lack any form of constructive criticism.  
---
When I first got the game I was here all the time, and yeah, it could be negative at times, but since the TSE nerf this sub is fucking insufferable.
---
I mean, just look at them in any other game, they're basically fascists
---
That's what I get for not developing critical reading skills
---
I wonder what is on that highly targeted list
---
i love the mire- it’s probably my favorite part of the map. i’ve had two other camps around it before but my most recent camp was at a mountaintop pond near vault 76. it’s great to be back :)
---
The post says they have a list, and such a list is pretty easy to imagine. On Xbox anyway there are certain weapons that should be quite rare but that show up over and over again on the trading subs. I expect everyone with a TSE Lever with +1 Perception is going to have a slightly lighter inventory or Stash tomorrow as there are hundreds if not thousands of copies of this gun on that platform. I expect certain instances of the TSE Gauss, TSE Pump Action Shotgun, TSE handmade etc etc will be on that list, and who knows which rare armor pieces...
---
is it a good or a helmet? Betting it is the hood aka is it

Yes that would indicate to them the people that duped the guns, and that’s easy to do. But we are talking about the fact that they shouldn’t punish people that bought duped guns because they have no proof that those people knew the guns were duped when buying them
---
You seem very concerned about Bethesda removing duped items.   Assuming they get it at least mostly right (questionable), I would think legitimate trader would have nothing to worried about.    Please let us know how it goes.  
---
 Oh, and well formatted post.  Rare these days.  
---
Wow you're bring up my illiteracy on a public forum?! I thought we were friends.
---
Bethesda, stop.  Don't eat the last piece of pie in the fridge.  That shit is mine and you know it, you already ATE YOURS AT DINNER TIME BETHESDA, GODDAMN IT!!!
---
highly targeted list = your items!
---
I meant Marine Combat Armor helmet you mentioned, not... That?
---
My entire set of unyielding marine sentinel armor is definitely on that list.  Gonna log in and be naked.
---
Simpler. Just looked for stacked legendaries. Ever had two identical weapons stack even when configured exactly the same?  I haven’t seen it happen with anything of mine, only with dupers. 
---
My biggest concern is how they’ll handle junk and ammo. What if someone has 5k ammo they grinded like hell to stockpile?  When I had an LMG I had over 10k of UC 308 and was burning through it as fast as I could make it
---
Hopefully with junk/ammo/aid they only target people with obscene amounts. Got 50 stims?  You’re cool. Got 1000 of them?  That’s a problem. 
---
You can easily buy serums for 150 caps, sometimes less. So don't pay too much for recipes thinking you'll make a profit on serums. 
---
guess i'll find out if the two two-shot weapons I bought off a vendor were duped or not
---
Do you have a link to the update notes by any chance?
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language=en)
---
Agreed, it is all about the long run in the end.
---
And they never saw him again.  Except that one time in Mexico.
---
I really love this game and to an extent I love Bethesda.... BUT low-key, yeah I’m bracing myself for that post-update experience. 😂
---
Previously they seemed pretty open about how items in the game don't have a unique identifier, so I can't imagine they have a better solution.  
---
I feel the impending doom. Though I’ll be prepared enough. 
---
idk if it is even duped or not, but i will find out after patch.. though i am suspicious about my harpoon gun
---
If I never log back in nothing is missing. Just like Schrodinger said.
---
Probably tse handmades and Hunter Longcoats. Those things are everywhere. 
---
Yeah, the trading reddits are getting deader by the day.
---
Long time traders I knew and traded with all the time are already gone.
---
**This will completely destroy the trading reddits.**
---
Why bother trading if you don't know what's duped and what they'll just DELETE from your account later.
---
But who's duping the dupers!?!
---
&gt; It feels like there's someone in management who's job it is to be "FUN POLICE".
---
You mean *whose*, but yes.  This is exactly.
---
"We have this game that our fanbase never asked for and revolted at the announcement of.  The people who gave it a chance anyway gave it horrible reviews, leading some gaming outlets to call it the worst game of the year.  The game became a laughing stock online, and YouTube is filled with rants about how terrible the game is.
---
Yet we have a small dedicated group of players who found something here to enjoy anyway.  They found fun doing things that we didn't intend or design for them to do, but they're playing it and enjoying those things.  How can we capitalize on this to retain them as players and improve the game?"
---
If you said "Stop their ability to do the things that they find fun," congratulations!  You're now qualified to work in management at Bethesda.  You will be contacted shortly.
---
Hmmm. Looking for a fresh player base though. If I did warframe then I would be joining an already fully matured playerbase with endgame players. 
---
(PS: I once watched a short trial over the question of whether a guy who'd bought a young chimpanzee was or wasn't a BFP. The judge ruled that since the guy had bought the chimp at a roadside park, from someone who had no "chimp gear" (clothing, diapers, other stuff chimp owners always have), and who couldn't explain how to care for him, and who insisted on being paid in cash, the purchaser ought to have realized the chimp might be stolen. 
---
It also helped that when the true owner was asked if he had any proof that the chimp was his, he said, "Sure, watch this. Skippy?" The chimp leaped over the supposed BFP's table and catapulted into the true owner's arms, and they began grooming each other. Fabulous trial.)
---
That explode
---
Based on their post, it doesn't sound like everyone will use it, only people they know have it tied to duping.  But yes, I agree, the list is pretty easy to imagine.  
---
Thanks man, it was a pleasure trading with you as well :)
---
Unfortunately this is going to kill the trading reddits :(
---
How can you get them so cheap? They are about 5k without perks, then about 4100 with 3 ranks of hard bargain?
---
The game lacks so many things. I understand I am late but unfortunately I bought the game at full price day 1. So I've sent it from the start to present day. To be completely honest (coming from a fan of fallout) this game is absolutely the worst game I've ever played. There are no real people. Just quest giving robots. No actual human NPCs. And even when you do get a mission, it is mind numbingly boring. The game has been incredibly discounted all over the PlayStation 4 (yes I play on console. Spare me). Anyone who says the game is good either is a big fan boy, or they were blindfolded. They don't show any signs or plans of fixing the game and improving it. If I were you and your friends I'd look for another game to squad up on. Because unfortunately there is nothing saving fallout 76
---
Seriously. Nothin like going ham on a pack of ghouls and a stray bullet causing the whole freakin’ resort to turn against ya. It is exciting, tho... lol. But I could live without that. Would def dig a grace period on that. Or maybe whatever they’re doing to prevent bounties for accidentally damaging another player camp could apply to Whitesprings bots too?
---
Look, guys, no need to fight here cmon.  Plus, you both look like the dupiest dupers I've ever seen.  I mean I've seen some dupers in my time, but the way you guys are typing those dupey letters with your dupey fingers on your dupey keyboards, wheeeewboy!  Dupe city.
---
/s
---
I enjoy it. I'm lv 71. Ps4 I know it has some glitches, and their is no lack of content, people expect to much from games. Like 500 hrs of content, really?!?! Get a life. I still have not Finnished the main story line, still have to build my XO power armor, just a lot to still do. Probably enough to get me well over lv 100 before actually reaching end game. They also bitch about the dupers, but now bitching they are getting rid of duped items? 
---
I have a few minor complaints about the game, but more about the other players than the game. It's a good game for what we paid. The problem is people's expectations for it.  
---
I was letting that slide because I somewhat saw what he meant. Not literally stealing, but a illegitimate copy of something
---
Did you miss the part at the very beginning where he said the video was mainly to serve as a catalog of the bugs he experienced for posterity? This specific video isn't a critique or review its literally just a comprehensive list of bugs one person experienced in one play through. If something is not working as intended why should it not be listed in a bug compendium regardless of severity? Was the loading issue relatively minor? Yes. Was it still a bug and therefore should be included in a list of bugs seen? Also yes. You seem to have missed the entire point of the video.
---
It is. My only hope is that the armors are left untouched. If not unarmed will no longer be viable for me
---
Somebody made a comment that chilled me out... we are spending a lot of time thinking it's individual weapons and armor, but it's much more likely a simple script would be hunting for stacks of hundreds of identical things that are high on the rarity threshold.
---
Nuka grapes, hundreds of stable flux... shit like that, not weapons and armor.
---
Kinda calmed me down. I only have a couple weapons I suspect might be duped that I bought from players before I knew how bad it was, but I still fear for the masses that pay no mind to reddit or forums or twitter, thought they were just buying an item.
---
Hey, it's the shiny new thing, go enjoy it.
---
I'll have the same voice in my head I had while playing Destiny 2:
---
"Why aren't you just playing Warframe?"
---
Legendary enemies will respawn to full once you get them down half. Just once. The  you cam drain them.
---
Buy them from other players that have the recipe. Check r/fo76bazaar 
---
No bug. Legendary enemies recover their health.
---
Well, it IS on valentines day.
---
I got excited when I heard plans. 
---
DOES ANYONE HAVE, OR KNOW WHERE TO GET, BROTHERHOOD COMBAT ARMOR PLANS??? I have tried Grafton train station, Responder vendor and Grafton Day event multiple times. 
---
That's how I feel about the armor set I bought from someone. All 2* with +1 to strength. Either it was a fun couple months for 15k caps or I get to keep it. I had 1 TSE shotgun that I got in a trade, I kept killing myself with it so I gave it to someone else I play with. 
---
That's legendary behavior.  Have you played 4?
---
I don't know any one who pays full prices for serums or recipes from Modus. The Scorchbeast Queen sometimes drops serum recipes, and players who play A LOT collect duplicates of the recipes, which they sell on the trading subs. So lots of players are making serums and there is so much competition the prices are really low. 
---
They just announced a new pvp survivor mode,  I understand that everyone may not like that, but you can’t argue they haven’t given new content when they literally are releasing a new game mode.
---
UH did you read my post. this is what I am talking about. The bottom one is at least. 
---
They fucked up Radworms.  What could possibly go wrong (sarcasm)
---
Best case scenario they wreck TSE, AAE, and BE and leave everything else alone. If so recovery is possible. If they wipe all duped material they market will have to reset
---
Drop some fertilizer and toss a Molotov on it, lol. That’s what I do at my brother and his wife’s camps. 😂
---
Same
---
Rectifying what the situation they created? Its impossible to make this game without a dupe exploit? Is that what you're saying? It was unreasonable for us to expect them to make a game that pays as intended?
---
Eve Online allows you to "copy" your regular pilot and play on their test server. This way, you don't have to start from scratch and have everything available to you. Also, their "vendors" basically sell everything for really cheap so you can buy stuff to test with. It's great for trying out new ship builds and practicing dog fighting. Something like that might help with Fallout as we get all the bugs worked out.
---
At level 4 I was drinking pond water and eating dog food, I was beating off ghouls with a wooden bat
---
Yeah, if you're looking for optimal items, you'll never get them with a 1 in 300,000 chance of getting that item.
---
So you're left to trade for what you want.
---
Now you can't even do that without risking Bethesda deleting your items.
---
I just don't know what I may have purchased/traded from vendors OR players, that would be flagged. I've never duped, and never learned how.. not my style. Just curious about purchases/trades that will be gone
---
Lol. Most people dont want to join a game and be super behind. But I'm glad you have a game you enjoy so much, more power to you.
---
Is it the wrong image? It doesn't look like either.
---
As I said elsewhere about the TSE nerf, it was devastating to many weapons. I have two shotguns in my inventory. One a TSE I bought off the trading subs, another an instigating pump I got off a vendor. The TSE does 190. The pump 156 BEFORE it’s double damage effect is applied. 
---
Yeah. Wiping TSEs at this point seems pointless. 
---
My guess would have to be
---
Unyielding sentinel armor
---
Cavalier armor
---
Tse weapons
---
Bloodied super sledges
---
Instigating super sledges
---
Instigating explosive weapons
---
Bloodied explosive weapons
---
Hunters long coats
---
Any rare outfit
---
Bloodied power fists
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlets
---
Anything else that is really cool?
---
Hey friend I'll buy all the stuff you can drop for me, 50 caps sounds very fair.
---
Can you please meet me at each of the vendor bots in turn and then again on my other 4 characters? 
---
Sorry but I think you need to take it down a notch. On the one hand I'm sympathetic to your distress, but on the other you're mangling my words pretty damn hard.
---
I didn't say anything about mental illness. It's possible to have anger issues or whatever as a part of life or personality without it being a clinical problem (which was my case). I also didn't say 'nothing' can be a catalyst for emotion, either. I wrote that emotional responses like rage and tears to a video game bug are not normal, nor should they be considered an indication of how bad that bug actually is.
---
"Mentally deficient piece of shit who needs therapy"-- or in my own words,"acknowledge where the conflict is really coming from and work on that". Also, "no insult intended on this point either, as I had anger problems for awhile when I was younger. It's just not fair to blame an external object for the degree of your response to that object".
---
A technical bug in a game is not an attack on any person, and if I spill my coffee on an artist's work and they cry I'd certainly feel bad, not that losing some junk (literal junk) in a video game is equivalent to art. But if that artist decides to rage at me over it I'm gonna tell them to simmer down because accidents (like bugs) do happen, and they're not personal. 
---
'complete piece of shit' is way out of line lol. But after all, it is the internet.
---
Actually that isn't completely true. They can see by the ID, every item has an ID for what it is what its base CND is and a few other stats.  
---
All they have to do is find a large amount of items that have the exact same CND and legendary effects that where created around the same time and just wipe them all.   
---
It would have to be another Bethesda account, not just an alt so that limits it quite a bit but you're right, they could have kept a lot of the caps.
---
Marsupial is the most favored in the game
---
Or grab some popcorn
---
Dude, so far this is the best idea I've seen.  But judging by the way this train is rollin' I don't think this will happen.  Not because your wrong, and not because it's a bad idea (it's not, you're right it happens in other games all the time).  But because this shit is IN THE BAG BABUH!  What they just announced would happen, will happen no matter what b/c that is just how these companies roll.  Let's sit back, relax, watch the show.  Then later go through our stash (oh my lord I have more free space ::squeal::) and play the game.
---
No idea why this is being voted down. It's exactly what Bethesda is doing. Not my idea one way or the other.
---
I mean I am kinda a dick. Lol. Still love ya man. Just gotta make sure all the info is there. Don’t be like a politician and cherry pick the parts that push your agenda. Lol. 
---
Betting you are thinking of the standard combat armor helmet [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Combat\_armor\_helmet\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Combat_armor_helmet_(Fallout_76))  
---
This is not a marine helmet. 
---
Those 1* instigating and bloodied Gauss rifles I’ve sentimentally refused to dump may be looking pretty nice.
---
Your character will have negative knowledge like a part of your characters brain taken out
---
3hrs on the same server!?!?!? I can't go for 45 minutes without "disconnected from server" issues. Lucky me right?!
---
gamer tag? System? I will be happy to pass by if u on ps4
---
Thanks for your perspective. I appreciate it; truly. 
---
I didn't intend this to be a slight towards the dev team; if anything, I would like to see this come to fruition because I feel like it could be genuinely helpful to the devs. It would give them a safe space per se to test out the updates or content they will be rolling out. 
---
I have many ideas and suggestions of my own but don't often voice them because this seems like something that should come before any future "big" changes.
---
Using a public test client and server they could correct game-breaking issues before it rolls out to base game client; preventing game-breaking exploits and bugs from affecting the player base who may not be using the public test client.
---
I feel it has gotten progressively better, especially server stability-wise, but what really bothered me about the last patch was not the "nerf" of TSE weapons but it seemed like the nerf happened because the real "whiny children" bitched about it constantly so management decided to pander to and placate them. 
---
Though it didn't address what I think really troubled most people...  the passive system and its ROE and functionality. Fortunately, the game-breaking bulk bug was dealt with swiftly; kudos to the devs for due diligence. 
---
I was already aware of their being under-staffed and I've heard mention of the limitations of the engine. 
---
I am being quite patient and rolling with the punches more so than a lot of other players. I'm just sick of hearing the same complaints about stash space, enemies being too tough, survival essentials being too scarce, etc and losing entire groups of friends and factions I play with. If those are things the community wants, I feel like the community should def want a separate client in case their wish for more stash space ends up not agreeing with the engine and causes massive stability issues like the unlimited carry weight glitch. 
---
Anywho, there are still players who come into this game with fresh eyes and I do my best to help them with inventory management, leveling up, and helpful info for the builds they are wanting to do.
---
Ill be the one at Whitesprings pool selling popcorn. This Oughta be good. 😁
---
Oh God I sense an impending controversy on the horizon. Quick everybody get down! 
---
I'm going to need a new getup then
---
Holy crap, I didn't know that sub existed, that's unbelievable that people sell them so cheap, there are even people giving them away free.
---
I think if that is ultimately what winds up happening, (That certain items system wide on all players are removed) you will see more exodus from users from the game.  It's a chore simulator, you any more away from the remaining users that make the chore simulator any more tedious and even more will leave I think.  Activity has fallen off after the last nerf, can't imagine how much more it will fall off if it really is all major duped items are being removed from ALL players.  
---
Today I traded 5 power armor's worth of jetpack and calibrated shock services.
---
The guy gave me a Bloody Explosive handmade.  It's the new meta and I've been wanting one forever.
---
Was it duped?
---
What about the Calibrated Shocks plan I just traded for a Anti-Armor Explosive Shotgun.  I wanted it to trade for other items.
---
I also just traded 5,000 caps for a Chameleon / Cavalier Robot Arm.  Probably not a dupe, but are you 100% sure that'll be there tomorrow?
---
Was that duped?
---
This will destroy trading as we know it.  You'll never be able to trade without that little voice saying "hey if this is a good item, you might get it DELETED later because reasons".
---
So, in other words, a part of the development team needs to get on the subreddit and make YouTube videos and write blog posts berating and insulting the community and fanbase and make up lies about us?
---
I mean, that *would* be matching the community. Right?
---
Agreed. This is bit difficult to read, but very helpful! As a new player its good to know what perks to look forward to as I rank up. If you were willing to be super tedious, you could add the effects of each perk in the text. Also, it took me a bit for my eyes to adjust to what I was looking at. Love the colors, but maybe muted colors so it doesn't hurt to look at. And yeah, consistent sizing would be cool.
---
I still believe in you.  I don't care what all the others say.
---
Waite weeks for before even beginning to fix it is a big problem, but what’s worse was REINTRODUCING a patched dupe method with a subsequent patch. That just reeks of incompetence and someone (or a lot of people) should have been handed pink slips for causing a reversion to an old build. 
---
Yes.  It's also evidence that there are zero plans to wipe the servers.  This is a long term solution.
---
Valid points, but you can’t have more than 25k caps at a time.
---
Don't forget all the axes and super sledges floating around
---
Probably for the TLDR crowd. 
---
I've looked at your post history. You regularly tear people down for conveying emotion.
---
Look at your comments and behavior above my original comment.
---
Yeah me too, but half of this sub is laughing at and mocking anyone that loses a gun tomorrow regardless. How nice.
---
Of course it'll be good!
---
If the level 40 TSE gatling gun I picked up off a super mutant goes away, I will not be a happy camper...250hrs in and it's the only TSE I have found in the game. Found several two shot and explosive weapons on their own, but just the one TSE.
---
This thread is a reaffirmation for me. Definitely chose wisely not playing 76. Online multiplayer games inevitably go to the same place. Exploitation and "economy"
---
Hopefully there will be a solo/private server option some day when the bugs and the insects both are all gone. 
---
They were hostile to me until i became mayor of watoga
---
If I remember correctly, the virus isn't viable outside of containment too long. So if you mean like the vats in 76, they're contaminated and fucked.
---
Also, despite what playing this franchise would imply, Super Mutants as we know them are rare. Most people just died, came out brain dead, or turned into horrific blobs of "wtf" that had no actual utility. Even the mutants are technically a failure, since they're idiots and can't follow orders.
---
It'd be cool if a single person on a server could get an FEV mutation until they logged off, tho. Give the mutated some stacked stats, and a bad ass reward to whomever takes them out.
---
I heard you can just move your camp and everything will be fixed. Haven’t tried it myself yet
---
I don't even know why people are pissed ay Bethesda for announcing this. They wanted it like a week ago, but once they get it, they do a complete 180°.
---
Could be a mod.  If the mod changes something on the client side it might look really weird for anyone else seeing them on the server and not running the same mod.
---
::puts down witch-hunting wig:: Then again it could have been just a visual glitch and just looked weird this one time on your client for this one session.
---
What will happen if you sell them to shops and buy them back? Laundry?
---
I imagine they stack since everything is the same? Yea even when I craft guns, they are separate I assume the condition is just slightly different, any gun that stacks is pretty much toast
---
They also get to look across accounts, it’s not really possible that the same gun/legendary/condition combo so when it’s seen across players there is another flag 
---
I’d imagine junk/ammo/aid will be ignored, for the reasons you say, and it’s not like there is a market for that anyways so I don’t think it’s a loss
---
The bobbleheads and magazines, I could see that one removing any stacks over say 10 as a special case.  
---
“Terrified”?
---
FFS....
---
Yeah I'ma just dumb
---
1, camp location matters  
---
2, log off when your camp is attacked to minimize damage
---
3, were your doors locked?  Safer not to.  
---
Thank you I appreciate this a lot.
---
They destroy out of your inventory every week 
---
They're weekly I believe
---
Your taking them for their word on this?  How do we even know they can, maybe they are just going to remove every certain type of weapon they have found previous duper account they banned that they had?  I would not trust them for anything they say.  They can't even fix half the bugs properly in the game, I can't imagine they are going to do this in some well thought out manner.
---
Yes it WAS obvious 
---
Same reasons I say I can't do \_\_\_\_\_ at my job even though I can - I don't have time for the nonstop requests I would get once I opened that barn door, and I don't exactly want to advertise that I have that kind of access to everyone's data. I also don't want the people who would have time to have that access.
---
Inventory is going to be stored in a group of database tables. I don't have any more insight into the actual structure than you do, but there are some table design guidelines that are so fundamental they're almost law. Timestamps for inserts and last update are a must-have for development, troubleshooting, and statistics. A source for the insert and last update operations, and separately the player ID responsible for both, are nearly required too. And yes, a unique ID of some kind. It might be a single auto-increment field or some group of fields that comprise a primary key, but there's going to be a way to identify a specific record in the table index so it doesn't take five minutes to find it in-game. And while I hope some tables have their data encrypted and/or masked in some fashion, like user passwords, there's no reason to do that with inventory. There's a lot of reasons not to, most of which are performance. So yes, I fully expect that inventory is and always has been visible to at least some of Bethesda's devs, even if it's not exposed to support, and I completely understand why they would say otherwise.
---
Not true. I’ve gotten a few good drops. Had a hunter’s exploding shotgun from the SBQ. Picked up a troubleshooter’s exploding gatling at WhiteSprings. 
---
But I passed these guns off to a friend (for free) when I started buying TSEs off the trading subs.  Bethesda then ran my build into the dirt, even my non-legendary effect explosives (Fat-Man and AGL) and my TS heavies (Gatling Plasma and LMG) were trashed. 
---
Gee I sure hope they don't take one of my exterminator wooden armor pieces, or the goddamn vampire rolling pins I keep getting from legendaries. How about they kill their own duped shit first, it would be nice to not waste time and ammo to keep getting the same garbage over and over
---
Lol really? I gonna try it right now then
---
It's not that hard to get the resources 
---
And I got the world's smallest violin... 
---
https://youtu.be/0lzqRVuRqN0
---
Let me know if it works 
---
Yeah I know, I was talking in total.. My understanding is dupers have numerous accounts.  (The pros)
---
I don't know I don't play all the games, but I would blame that on the current PVP mechanic rather than the invite system, but I see how they are related in this instance. I think it is the PVP mechanic creating the problem. Either way, I agree there is a problem if people are "teaming up" as a means to grief. 
---
I remember doing Uranium Fever once when I wasn't at a high enough level. I narrowly escaped, while my teammate died. 
---
They send a TON of mole miners after you. And after that, they send more. 
---
Couldn't imagine going in there with anything but over powered weapons. This was before I got the All Rise.
---
Man, how'd you get so many upvotes?  Hahaha, I posted along similar lines a few minutes ago and didn't last 15 seconds without down votes and butthurts crying about maybe accidentally, totally not on purpose, buying too good to be true, absolutely, obviously, duped gear.  
---
Tomorrow is going to be hilarious once servers comes back online.
---
This isn't just hitting me, this is going to kill both trading reddits.  You'll never be able to trade for "good" items without worrying the Fun Police at Bethesda are going to come delete that item later.
---
Thanks, I try to do at least "some" formatting :)
---
That won't matter though if the serum is already on someone I'd assume? Also if they already know the recipe 
---
Well, you must have taken a damn long time then
---
Every Monday at 7EST they delete. You can skip collecting them and get the decrypted code at www.nukacrypt.com/solved
---
My camp duplicated about 30 blackberry bushes once, looks like im fucked
---
Descriptive hyperbole-- thanks, you just confirmed my point rofl. All these people arguing over it, and it's very obvious. 
---
Now, if you disagree that it's done for clickbait reasons, that's your call. But it's pretty clear to be that descriptive hyperbole is used to get attention, and that it's quite easy to get attention with negativity about Fallout 76.
---
Simple claims I make here. I'm not reinventing the wheel haha.  
---
Not sure why you're freaking out.  If everything you got by decent means you should be fine. If you lose a few guns cause they were duped, who cares?
---
You'll have plenty of caps and plans to keep.on trading. 
---
You are definitely making a way bigger deal than you need to. How else would they fix this problem genius? People cry about duping and ask them to fix it. Then they do and everyone cries some more. 
---
You sir, are a little bitch.
---
I feel like I desperately need some cutting edge, life saving surgery, but the only doctor around only talks on one day a week, can't get malpractice insurance because of his sketchy history, and his only tool appears to be a scythe.

Complete the enclave questline to know more
---
Laughing at the pain of others is a wonderful personality trait, and something you should really nurture.  Keep up the good work!
---
Well who knows regarding the BE Handmade, but and and AE are the new sexy so I personally would have been cautious...

The shocks for a AAE before "Black Tuesday" would have seemed like a reasonable trade, but since "Black Tuesday" you should not have gotten a AAE for something you can get off a vendor for 6k caps...    
---
So good chance there, and if your as active a trader as you claim to be honest you should know that deal was unusually good...  
---
Generally speaking because I paid attention to what was being duped, or there was a sudden glut of X on the market, I don't think I'll find allot missing.    
---
No offense but this is like someone buying a Prada bag from a street vendor in NYC acting "shocked" the bag retailing for $5k, purchases for $150, was a counterfeit.
---
They reset at the beginning of the week, also just check them online 
---
This week they are

Charlie: 41335610

Given Bethesda's track record on this both of you will lose items, none of which were duped.
---
It's still in a terrible state
---
I think I found them on Taggerdy's body. Can't really confirm this, sorry.
---
Not dumb just confused.  That helmet is called combat armor helmet the marine one is called marine combat helmet literally one word difference. 
---
I’ve got mine there as well, after seeing yours in game a month or so ago. It’s a great spot!
---
You either get mass upvoted by people who already acknowledge that the game is gonna die, or mass downvoted by fanboys blatantly ignoring everything wrong with the game.
---
I’m worried that my melee weapons will vanish, I dont keep spares so there’s every chance tomorrow I’ll have nothing
---
I have like 7 mutations if they remove those I’m screwed lol. But it opens the market for the people who have the recipe learned to make the serums for a cheaper rate than those who can’t afford them in the shop. Cause all existing serims are gonna get removed.
---
hahahahaa nice one mate
---
Hahahaha I just read the other thread then find this.  This is gold I tell you XD
---
What the fuck is a bleached dogwood lol
---
I made 10 corn soup in a row and got banned.  Bethesda is so unfair.
---
??? 
---
There wasn't downtime yet was there
---
Just wait until they wipe everyones legit stuff
---
Where is Taggerdys body? I did that quest a while ago. 
---
Oh and I am getting disconnected from the server much more too.
---
You were a great trader, man.

Or four.
---
Hmu - mindlord1970 
---
I’d like to buy your entire stick please. Anonymously, of course, as you don’t need to worry where my caps have come from… 
---
But I can't imagine them being able to work out that somones mutation is from a duped serum....
---
Then one more dumb question, why didn’t they do this when they imposed the weight limit as the fix?
---
I owned 500 TSE Automatic Handmades all at once and got banned. Bethesda is so unfair.
---
Well, My camp were near whitesprings, but not in (10 caps for fast-travelling)
---
The notification abou attacking is easy to miss, because usually (atleast me) dont even look in the right corner (I'm think I'm not alone)
---
Well, yes, some doors and other things were locked
---
But they get wanted not because they pick lock, but because they destroyd everything.
---
Anyway, thats just sad
---
That's the thing that worries me the most
---
Haha is that like 100 dollars worth of atoms or what
---
If i bought stimpak or whatever, those are mine. Keep your hands off. Only take from the original person. Not the buyers.
---
I didn't know i was buying duped items so don't punish me or any other buyer.
---
(I haven't bought from others but still, don't take what we pay for)
---
Yeah. Thats shitty. Some people traded everything for one if these or bought off ebay, and its being taken away
---
Near that radio transponder thing in Glassed Caverns.
---
At least a bunch of people that will claim being innocent.
---
Same here. Need the arms, have the rest amongst my guild.
---
... You use the watoga suitcase as a stash? Uh... Did I maybe sorta kinda possibly steal a lot of legendary weapons from you?
---
So will they be giving players their caps back for items traded with others that may have been responsible for duping? Are we, in effect, going to be punished for grinding to get enough caps to buy decent weapons? We can't possibly know where other players got their weapons from.
---
Wait wait wait. Bethesda didn't create dupers or duping. The people who chose to cheat did that on their own, so let's at least get that out of the way. Once again victim blaming.
---
The CTD are more common after the last months patches...   
---
But question do you use power armor?  
---
Do you use a Targeting HUD?  
---
[[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/)
---
I'm really excited for all the angriness going to happen tomorrow. "I don't know how these elicit substances ended up on me officer"
---
erghhh no
---
I tried.  Always made sure that people got what they wanted when they traded with me.
---
Never screwed even 1 person.   I'm friends with a lot of the traders on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar.
---
Yeah I didn't even realize it was an issue as I get rid of at least 99% of legendaries immediately anyway. It's still a really good event if you're low on any basic scrap and for xp but definitely not the unbugged version of SBQ I thought it was.
---
AWOL Armaments, Distant Thunder, Line in the Sand and One Violent Night are still really good though.
---
&gt; I’d imagine junk/ammo/aid will be ignored, for the reasons you say, and it’s not like there is a market for that anyways so I don’t think it’s a loss
---
And you’d be wrong. They made it clear in a previous anti-duper post that they were targeting accounts with large amounts of items like ballistic fiber and the like.  When I heard of stuff on eBay, I was incredulous and went to look. People were not only selling duped assassin sentinel sets, but had obscene amounts of junk items like flux for sell. I’m talking screenshotted inventories with 100k of each. 
---
There was a list of the commonly duped items floating around some of the trading forums and Reddit's..  
---
All of those for sure 
---
ok, thank you.
---
? give player money to get item
---
? bethesda deletes item
---
? no refunds
---
These fucking doofuses. If Bethesda wasn't a private company I'd say Fallout 76 was a conspiracy to short its own stock.
---
Not really. Lvl 12 and everything just lies down in front of you to die. Rads are only a concern if you're standing in a pool of toxic water. 
---
Lol no I dump stuff in those two locations I don't have room for, when I've already done my vendor circuit. I mean for others to grab it. A lot of us do. 
---
Same lmfao a guy traded me a two shot explosive handmade for 200 caps... prepping for when I login and it’s gone 
---
i lov these guys.
---
Oh woe is me i played a game thats been out for under 6 months and im Bored there is no new content.
---
Give it a rest fellas this is gaming you'll never get a shit ton of content released this early just chill.
---
If you are bored move onto something else and come back when content is added, dont sit here and whinge about it :).
---
Good day to you all :)
---
Jesus fucking Christ what is with you people? The vast majority of people who haven't quit this game are not on Reddit slobbering about people being ignorant. They don't follow news or forums, they at most read the Bethesda posts, and at worst never read anything about anything. If hey unknowingly bought a duped item from another player that's somehow their fault?
---
That logic can fuck right off.
---
Anyways, based on Bethesdas wording I would hazard a guess that highly targeted means targeting people who committed the duping, not the person who received a single item.
---
a super duper pooper scooper...say that a few times...
---
I’m not sure either but i have to strategize and shit with my guns, which I’m perked and leveled to maximize efficiency. Not with the damn melee though I just swing away and that’s it. Not that it’s bad, but I would like to see the guns get a buff to match the power of melee. Would be nice. 
---
TSE is pretty useless after the nerf, so most people are back to melee anyways
---
For real?
---
Jesus Christ. Y’all are so desperate to validate your opinion that “this game is dying” that you try to make some truly ridiculous arguments.  
---
No, not every time I play, but I’ll often check, and also if you read my post I’m spamming team invites and messages to facilitate trades when I’m on that toon.
---
It's not healthy for the long term health of the game to do something that may cause the last remaining players to abandon the game.
---
I kind of agree, I've been tempted to start over a few times and take things at a different pace/ different direction but feel like it would be a massive waste of time. I've never come across any of these awesome weapons people talk about and just killed my first queen last night just to get a 2 star combat arm (exterminator + some other useless bullshit). I still enjoy the game, but can't see myself starting a new character and I'm only lev 78. Those 100+ guys must be bored as shit by now
---
If I did 500+ trades, how many of those items were duped?  How many are still in my inventory?  How many are going to be deleted tomorrow?
---
Why bother trading AT ALL if this is the solution to fixing issues.
---
You should learn to put yourself in other people's shoes once in a while.
---
I don't think they actually said that.  Support said they don't have the "tools" to restore lost items.  That doesn't mean the devs couldn't do it, but they can't devote the resources to bringing back your favorite outfit when they're trying to fix the game.  
---
I dump tons of legendary stuff there too after a hard whitesprings farm when I'm too heavy to fast travel.  They weren't duped.  They are looking for two shot explosive handmade rifles mostly.  Everyone and their grandma has one. It's supposed to be an ultra rare weapon.
---
Yeah, I really don't fault the devs; I'd like them to be able to have that PTR so they can work on implementing what people would like to see and if something goes horribly wrong, they can use their leet skills and make sure it's ship shape when the update goes live while players can fall back on the base client.
---
Management is really where I would place blame. Didn't they want to use a new engine or take time to overhaul the current engine but management struck that down?
---
On my way with my duped caps!
---
Nah, you are really being an asshole here. Your implication that everyone who plays the game knows about duping is bullshit. You here on Reddit, you are the 1% who actually tunes into forums and news about games. Most people who play games? They never look at the devs own newsposts let alone forums or Reddit.
---
Communities don't set priorities on sinking ships. Find a life boat, bruddah
---
They will get the script to execute precisely and effectively, only targeting the duped items.  But unfortunately the tech at the keyboard executing the script didn't notice he had radworms so about 50% more unintended stuff will get deleted.  On the other had we will find 50% more of everything left over in our stashes.
---
Sadly, this. It doesn’t matter what they do, dupers will find a way to dupe. All they can really do is patch methods once they’re found and establish a method of tracking, and banning, dupers. 
---
everyone is slowly dying of Radworms hahaha :)
---
This makes more sense than a partial wipe. A full reset of the game would make many of those who left give it a second chance
---
You're right. I apologize. 
---
For real. That’s this reddit in a nutshell, basically. Lol. 
---
Zero possibility someone here is going to give you access to their account. Just watch gameplay videos, not the hate videos, but just gameplay videos and you should be able to tell what you’re buying 
---
Yeah, that worked
---
lmao so basically I'm never going to see a TSE gun ever again?
---
Based Bethesda ruining the game for suckas hahahaha
---
Nice!
---
You're right. I apologize.  
---
I didn’t have any turrets either.  The only costly budget makers were all my obnoxious strobe lights and colorful lights I put everywhere for visibility. 
---
Super curious if the TSE lever action I bought after the nerf was announced was duped. 
---
In a nonfucked economy, it probably would’ve been more expensive than 3k caps? Who knows. 
---
Don’t really care if I lose it. Good for the community. 
---
Yeah I follow.  Nothing you can really do about it except those things I mention.  And yeah it's easy to miss those notifications.  But to minimize risk, lock nothing (cos ppl like me will shoot the door off a locked camp if it's somewhere I need a workbench) &amp; put your camp somewhere out of the way (if it costs more to fast travel because you're not in the middle of the map, that's the price of relative safety).
---
Hollow advice now but it's the rules I follow.
---
Now you really have lost your goddamn mind. xD  My points were always about the video, and the OP and I sassed each other a bit at one point-- she wrote that my points made me 'look like a lunatic' and I responded that she was being a baby about some of the bugs. 
---
And you're going off on \~me\~ about mental illness? 
---
Nuh uh. You need to check yourself, cause you lost your shit with those comments lol. 
---
 A PvP survival mode is not content.  
---
It is an alternate game mechanisms system. 
---
So is it a good thing like how you posted or a bad thing like how you commented? 
---
Hoping Bethesda deletes the rest of the game tbh
---
Bonus if they delete the backups too, or if a rogue ferret chews on some wires and burns down the whole server farm.
---
Hallelujah!
---
I think the whole concept of PTRs and the fact this game is a MMORPG is really lost on you. 
---
I would rather this not be a vault-tec experiment type deal; especially if the bundling of the game with controllers results in a big influx of new players. 
---
I want the best for the peeps finally awaking from their drunken stupor and leaving the vault.
---
Good attitude dude.  I like the cut of your jib.
---
How many atoms you think they'll charge for a wacky wavy inflatable waving arms guy in the atomic shop?
---
Never had that problem with Ark.
---
They had consistent content drops even in early development, with a SMALLER INDIE team on their first title.
---
Ark has maintained solid survival multiplayer numbers throughout their 2 years of development.
---
It can be done with proper management and motivation.  Unfortunately we have neither here at Bethesda.
---
Good for people building their camp in the air, now I can put the pump indoors on a campfire to spam dirty water!
---
I'm pretty sure Fallout went full on whacky with Old World Blues, for everyone's darling New Vegas. 
---
The entire thing opens via a lobotomy if I recall correctly.
---
Did you empty your junk into your stash or vice versa? There's a bug that sometimes doesn't see the totals unless they are all in one spot.
---
Yes.
---
The earliest one I know of used the Artillery flare box. Basically the owner would drop items in it, another teammate would hold it open while the owner logged out. Once that happened, the inventory was saved server side to the owner of the artillery. The player with the transfer dialogue open would take everything out. When the owner logged back in, it would still be in the box, but also in the friend’s inventory. 
---
This is why almost all camp containers are tied to the stash and the Arty box doesn’t allow items to be put back into it. FWIW I learned of this after it was patched. 
---
There was another method involving mass crafting I saw on YouTube. I don’t think it’s been fully fixed though. 
---
lol no I stuck to the same exact Watoga bots so there'd be no variation in the enemies. 
---
I think people were pissed at me as they tried to farm legendaries though.
---
Im honestly going to be upset though. I bought one on r/market76 for 3500 caps. I work a full time job, and just saved my caps every day. Its kind of crappy that the weapon may be taken from me. I stopped playing a couple of days ago, but If I wanted to pick it back up I want it to be better, not worse for me when I do.
---
he's a squeeker and his friend cant be much older, but like fuck man. I am almost 60 levels higher then they are and I haven't even started x01 anything
---
I don’t expect anything.  I’d like to know if there is a plan, which includes new content, or if they have no plan other than to continue fixing precisely what should have been fixed during an open beta (which they strategically chose not to conduct).
---
Other AAA developers fix bugs while pushing content, so even if I did expect it, it would be a reasonable request from one of the formerly greatest video game companies that exists.
---
I do use PA yes but it has also crashed when I am not using it.  I don't have the HUD on.
---
It is most I last played the game properly last Friday.  Today was the first real gameplay and it has been a nightmare!
---
They are in toxic valley.
---
Grant flew an F-80, and you can’t convince me otherwise!
---
I'm looking for BOS Combat Arms. I noticed they were not there. Do they not exist?
---
Thursday, bloody Thursday.
---
I looked at my weapons I traded and bought and I have 5 that I suspect were duped based on their effects and commonality. That would leave me with 3 weapons that I'm pretty positive aren't duped. Woooo, boy. 
---
Not if their purge methods require taking down the servers.
---
Given the last patch, it’s possible it will fix the reintroduced one, but restore and/or create others. 
---
Delete this
---
Great stuff! Thanks for checking it out. I'll have to upgrade at some point then!
---
Winning.
---
&gt;Energy weapons have been balanced...by turning them all into rolling pins. Trust us, they'll actually do more damage that way.
---
Where is the evidence that there was a previously planned roadmap?  I’ve seen none, and I’ve followed the game closely since before beta.
---
In the code, there’s a few other (unfinished) vaults, but that’s it.  And a busywork presidential ballot quest for the enclave.  That’s the only content I believe that’s yet to be released.  And if that’s the case, those 5-10 hours of content are going to cause mass quitting.
---
Ive all but left the game and I would come back in a year if they wiped everything clean 
---
Sorry :(  
---
Since the late December / early Jan patch I've gone from zero CTDs ever to atleast a couple a session
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MY TSE!!!!
---
Hilariously one time I logged on with my girlfriend after we hadn't been playing together for a few days and found we'd placed our camps maybe 50 yards apart. Yeah right Bethesda, like people aren't going to find optimal places for camps.
---
I hope they have at least done some in-house testing before they do this, not like patch 5 and the hotfix, which were both DOA.
---
How many people buying these weapons thought they were 100% legit?
---
We must have extremely different standards of "gamebreaking or noticable" then. Randomly vanishing paintings, body and world objects continually flickering or ragdolling, events that get triggeres even though you are literally on the opposite side of the map from then and more are big problems for me, and most other people who play games. Also, the bit about the voice chat continuing even after the game has crashed, and been closed in task manager is alarming for many reasons, not least of which is that it seems to imply that Bethesda is using some sort of weird out of program possible unsecured way of networking for the voice chat.
---
Do you call everyone who is critical and points out bugs as producing clickbait? Because that's quite the cult like attitude to take. 
---
Harpers Ferry is decent and there’s also a random encounter if you follow the tracks out of town. Sometimes it spawns a 3* Super Mutant. I’ve also seen Deathclaws and Mothman there. 
---
Hello, 911?
---
Someone stole all my cocaine!
---
How do you respec?
---
Jeez I wish I could upvote this more than once I laughed my ass off at this.
---
I'm betting they're just throwing items into an algorithm.  They don't have individual items coded so they have no clue which items are duped aside from doing this..........
---
Assassin / Sentinel Chest with X durability bar...............delete all
---
Bloody / Swing Speed Super Sledge with X durability bar..........delete all
---
This will also pick up legit drops people got and delete them.  Now we're talking a 1% scenario there, but it will happen.
---
The market won't reset.  There's no reason to trade your "good" drop for another "good" item that will appear on the VERBOTEN list and get deleted later.   This will kill the trading subreddits.
---
I cut and pasted this from the internet;
---
To duplicate any item, you’ll need the Artillery plan first. This can be earned by completing the Brotherhood of Steel questline, or by going to the vendor at the Watoga Shopping Plaza. The Artillery plan is definitely at Fort Defiance at the end of the Brotherhood of Steel quest, and has a chance to spawn in the vendor’s inventory. follow these simple steps:
---
Group up with a friend in Fallout 76.
---
Have your friend build the Artillery item.
---
Place the item you want duplicated in the newly constructed Artillery Smoke Grenade Box, right next to the Artillery.
---
Do not close out of the Artillery Smoke Grenade Box menu.
---
Have your friend leave the game, which causes the Artillery to disappear.
---
Remove all items from the Artillery Smoke Grenade Box menu that is still open.
---
Have your friend return, which brings the Artillery back.
---
Take the duplicated items out of the Artillery Smoke Grenade Box.
---
I haven't tried it myself so I can't vouch for authenticity.
---
I started trading as well, within the last few weeks, because I sort-of ran out of stuff to do. 90% of everything I sold was legitimately earned by myself, grinding since beta, and 10% was found at different robo-vendors to RE-sell. I recently started to trade, instead of just taking caps(due to the limit), and I don't know what all I received that was duped. A few trades, I was offered the normal TSE stuff, which I turned down, but also some weapons I thought were going to be helpful for my adventures. TSE weapons are generally duped, but I did buy a couple just to carry after the Nerf... I honestly don't know if those were legit or not, and I understand if they take them away. I never resold anything that I suspected to be a dupe, and personally didn't like carrying that stuff in inventory, especially while my shop was open. 
---
Thank you for bringing up what I would have referred to.
---
I do get frustrated sometimes but I remind myself this game is a MMORPG that simulates fallout. Nobody can be the demi god they were in fallout 4, new vegas, or 3.
---
:,(
---
Yikes, yea I guess those are easy enough to tell the duped just from the size of the stack.   Outfits too I guess then, it’s gonna be exciting! 
---
Getting mods for that gun is D R A I N I N G
---
The nuclear material alone is a real bitch to get in quantity.
---
So they shouldn't delete dupe items to please your gaming style? Welcome to the real world 
---
The part about players being duped is were it got me
---
Fucking great
---
I hope there's peeps shitting bricks right now.
---
I've made lots of deals I thought were good.  The other people I traded with thought the deals were good.
---
That's the only way that trading gets done.
---
I'm not going to trade my "good item X" for your "crap item Y".
---
Now you can never be safe trading again.  This will kill both trading subreddits.
---
Amazing that they fail to ADD CONTENT to the game, and still manage to KILL CONTENT by removing all incentive to trade.
---
but the thing is before the nerf just regular explosive was good enough didnt need  to be a TSE and if those wouldnt have been duped to hell and back they wouldnt have gotten nerfed 
---
Are you perhaps near Dyer Chemical? If so, relog. 
---
You should be cautious really? This isn't real life. It's a game. The average casual player may not even check the patch notes. They may have no clue what is going on. The issue with reddit it seems everyone thinks ever player is a reddit user.
---
That’s what I’m expecting, and it’s what they said they were doing in the past. I know small items have been being duped since the start. Right after the arty box dupe method was fixed I ran into a duper selling stims for 10c each, hawking his wares over voice chat. I took a look. He had 5k of them. WTF?! 
---
Hey buddy you can fuck right off with this.
---
I'd prefer to assassinate people, take their stuff and sneak away clean without getting hate mail.
---
I never lock anything except sometimes a resource extractor. Everything else is open for use. I also usually put out a thumbs up statue to welcome people in. 
---
Sorry  - on XB1...Thanks though.
---
Well I’ll find out if that explosive.50 cal was accidentally sold to the vendor I got it from or if someone knew it was going to be deleted 
---
It'll be interesting to see what happens. I have two legendary guns I bought from a vendor in my stash. Both were marginal before the two shot and explosive nerfs and not worth using now but I hung onto them just in case something changed later because they were fun. I won't miss them if they're gone.
---
I am much more worried about the patch going wrong and deleting more than it should. It's not like there's a track record of excellence here. :)
---
Cool thanks. I did check all of the bodies when I did that quest (I usually always do), but I might check again! 
---
Yeah, they don't have individual items coded (which they should have).  In that case your missing items could be returned when the database logged them.
---
So they're going for mass delete tomorrow.
---
I was hooked from the start.  Bobby pins giving rad worms?  Genius.
---
As a trader that just started trading yesterday, I welcome this change. It aught to give me a chance in an overly crowded market and level out some prices. 
---
And honestly, if you are saying you didn't know items you were picking up were duped then you are a horrible trader.  All it takes it hanging out in some of the trading discords and seeing the same items pop up over and over from various traders.  You know right away which items are on the hit list. I for sure have two "duped" items that will almost certainly get snapped, not gonna get but hurt over it.
---
They probably won't have any stuff as it's getting deleted by Beth
---
Boooo
---
There's a rather big difference between saying "what are you, a lunatic?" and deliberately insulting a man and his wife.
---
At this point I'm gonna stop replying to you, it's pretty clear that you are just not interested in having conversations about this and just want to repeat over and over how something is clickbait and totally wrong and Fallout 76 is the best game ever.
---
All I can say is that maybe you should look at how much you've been getting downvoted in posts across this thread and realize that very few people seem to agree with your perspective.
---
Outstanding!  
---
All legendaries will be gone.  Turns out the Bloated Glowing Ones were duping too... how do you think they got all those Exterminator’s Drills?!
---
And have better durability. 
---
I forgot how hilarious I used to be 11 days ago.
---
I'm fucking pumped!
---
This place is going to be a salt mine and it's going to be fantastic!
---
Ooh...That rhymes!
---
I can’t remember where but I read something from Bethesda that said exactly this. They had a roadmap but it had to be shelved to work on fixing the game first.
---
y i k e s
---
I looked at my inventory and there's 5 weapons I traded for from other players that I suspect could be duped. If so, this will leave me with 3 weapons that I don't think are duped. Not looking forward to it. Oof.
---
Troll
---
If a multiplayer survival game is good, I'll play it for 1-2 years easy.
---
Did it with DayZ Mod. 
---
So far Fallout 76 isn't looking like a mistake purchase to me.
---
Me: yeah let me just give you all my login info including my ss# and bank account info.
---
This guy: really I got a pen I'm ready.
---
Me: sorry someone outbid you by 1k caps
---
I already found one that will likely be present post-patch, just haven’t gotten the video uploaded to report it. 
---
I got a wanted level by attacking a COL Gutsy. 
---
I want my caps back. i spent all of it (12k) on the only TSE gun i ever had.
---
Iirc it was from the forest. By now people probably have it figured out whether or not they are tied to location though
---
Didn't they already do that? 
---
I commented about these several months ago. I’ve explored nearly every area and building in game out of boredom.
---
You can swim up and down inside one of the buildings (that building per terminal entries and advertisements, Watoga Estates, is supposed to have an indoor pool).
---
If you want something funny, in the Enclave Bunker in Whitesprings, in the robotics room that houses MODUS, you can walk through the walls on the second floor, falling outside of the map and being able to re-enter from any point.
---
No powerarmor third person glitch needed.
---
Just go inside, ascend to second floor, walk to left wall about midway through, and walk directly through the wall. 
---
Starting a new character lol
---
I agree also as a trader.
---
I don't really have fun with battle royale games, I'm also particularly interested in hero based shooters and, from what I can tell, Apex is those two things combined. Secondly, I do my best not to support EA.
---
It’s literally just always on PVP, that is not new content. That’s just an alteration of the games mechanics to permanently turn on a status. Same map, same guns, same everything 
---
I wonder if inventory is not relational, but just a field on the container entry. Perhaps they are encoding the data which is why it would be very expensive to unpack for searching. It might also explain why the stash limit exists in the first place.
---
Troll level: Grandmaster!
---
Yep, almost as if that was the intended state of the market all along :/
---
They didn't think the Triple Nuke Nerf on TSE was enough.
---
Now they'll delete them.
---
Apparently the content team is missing, but the FUN POLICE are in full force.
---
It was good vs scorch beasts.
---
Everything else is meleed.  I have a 40% extra power damage and 30% on ghouls axe which is a killer.
---
GW2 is F2P.
---
Because it's a bad idea. Nobody on this sub listens to reasoned arguments against bad ideas and so they upvote stupid ideas and Bethesda doesn't know the difference, airing on the side of blunt force populism.
---
The problem isn't duped items or dupers, it's that Bethesda keeps hammering screws into its forehead and screaming at them to stop only seems to make them do it harder. It galvanizes the dumbasses who think this game is fine as is or that it only needs some "tweaking." Bethesda don't even know how to use their engine, and this is obvious to reasoned folks with abstract critical thinking skills. They're also extremely insecure about it because Fallout 76 isn't just tone-deaf and insulting, it's embarrassing. All they're trying to do at this point is minimize profit loss (current and future) and everything else comes at a distant second.
---
This isn't about justice or fairness, it's about appealing to the loudest base. This creates a situation where people like you think "THE COMMUNITY" is a homogenous blob of schizoids screaming contradictory demands, when really it was:
---
1. Babies demanding banhammers because their brains haven't developed superegos yet, and
---
2. Adults arguing against reactionary measures that will only beat this dead horse to a pulp.
---
Thanks for sharing the knowledge and I admire your humility, good sir or madame!
---
A "super active trader" has to use either one of the active Reddit's or discords..  
---
It's too challenging to find and arrange random trades in game...
---
Tons of people have tried, it's in part why there is the Reddit 
---
Fed up with posts like the title and came here to say so but read on and...friggin hilarious. Nice work!
---
Hyperinflation is no longer an issue. It may not completely solve the problem, but it sure as hell is better than nothing
---
I'm more worried about new bugs being added with the update.
---
Yeah that was great I have to quit coming back for the comments I read it and start laughing my ass off all over again.
---
I just hope they have a real process for identifying duped items (like them all having the same hidden unique ID code or something) and not just categorically removing two-shot and explosive weapons from people that have several... I have like 6 different either two-shot or explosive (not both on the same weapon) that I've actually looted from monsters myself and I really hope those don't disappear lol
---
I might start actually playing now LOL
---
....gee thanks and i though Valentines was already sucking already this just made my list.
---
Obviously not. 
---
Looking for two shot tesla more stars the better but not explosive
---
What's your hat size?
---
this excuse is going to get so tired. duping was well known, has been for a while.
---
I only started buying and trading after the dupes were "fixed" I am worried about my tse ultracite laser rifle I got legit but I'm worried they will go in and delete those guns while they are in there. 
---
Praise be allah 
---
Schools have a lotta plastic
---
I fanboy'd up the game as much as I could to my friends.
---
Now I feel like a dupe.
---
I really hope whoever is heading up Fallout 76 gets fired soon.
---
If you bought and invested a duped serum, Todd himself comes to your house and kicks your PS4 to death with his boots 
---
"and most other people who play games"
---
So here's what it comes down to. Both of us claiming that our own perspectives represent the majority. And while I believe the silent majority that play the game without complaint are solid indication that I'm right, and that many of these bugs really aren't a big deal to 'most players', I'm content to just let it die as a disagreement.
---
To answer your last question, I consider people who create exaggerations for their titles, and who receive revenue from clicks, to be clickbaiting. It's not a cult-like attitude to take at all; this behaviour is common practice in media, even in the world of mainstream news. It's a constant battle for accuracy over sensation.
---
Also, that link I left you is full of critical points and bugs, so it's obvious I don't call everyone a clickbaiter. But if your last comment was just meant to be catty then continue, meow.
---
\&gt; "once"
---
At first I was expecting this to be about the damage bug we all know and love, but it’s just about basic game mechanics.  
---
Yep. It’s normal. In FO4 you’d get a notification that “Legendary [insert enemy type] has evolved” when this happened but that little notification evidently got tossed. 
---
EA doing a better job that Bethesda at the moment. Real talk.
---
Not really the same thing. You can easily get one just from the caps you get by playing the game. I never went out of my way to grind for any gear and yet have everything I want + plenty to spare. You won't just have wedding dresses fall from the sky by going about your daily life.
---
Also, not that it matters too much, but last I checked the high tier weapons were selling for like $15, not $2
---
not even the damage reduction? because that's what matters.
---
I forgot which high school, but there is one towards where mama dolce's is. Anyway, there's a shit ton of plastic there. I also run around he amusement parks and pick up nuka cola cup &amp; star. Also scrapping laser guns/rifles will give u 4. You can also take over the ammunition factory and provide 20 power and it starts making them, no components! 
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Bethesda should've had the mods section for 76 like they did 4
---
Honest question, how do you know there are only a few hundred people still playing? I’d like to see the numbers but I don’t know where to look. 
---
?
---
yes Ark like you said smaller indie team, more pressure to make the game decent with frequent updates and patches.
---
Bethesda AAA game maker has been around the block a lot and i feel they don't think they have to do a lot.
---
Just push out a game with Fallout name on it and people will be all over it. just wasn't the case this time people are over game developers bullshit money grubbing tactics :).
---
Oh didnt know about the ammunition factory! Will have to check that out!
---
Out of curiosity, what is the difference between someone spending money on buying atoms to buy clothes vs. someone spending money to buy a nice gun on eBay? If one is an example of mental problems then so is the other. And if that is the case the majority of gamers have mental problems. So the world is just as screwed as I always thought it was.
---
It is quite incredible how they have managed to screw this game up.  It was getting to a state where bugs were rare.  I reallllyyyyy like the game, much more than I expected, and I defend it to my friends who say it's shite... but today has made it hard to love.  
---
Tommorrows patch better bring something good to the table or I think I will have to stop playing.... for a while.
---
Again though, if anyone has any input on whether my mods could be causing it.  I could remove the mods and just play the game, but it is one of them things where you never really know if it is fixed by removing the mods.  
---
Thanks
---
Hunters is a garbage perk.
---
Troubleshooters is garbage too.
---
We don't have enough STASH space to load up on "oh this weapon hits X enemy hard".
---
Yes, the Triple Nuke Nerf to TSE was too much.  But they're fixing it tomorrow!  Am I right???  :)
---
Lol this is fantastic 
---
You’re right, everyone knows the only places to purchase TSE weapons is via Silk Road or through corner store loiterers in dirty FUBU jerseys.
---
You’re vastly overestimating the percentage of players who read periodicals on games. I’m sure plenty of people bought duped items knowing they were duped and I’m also sure plenty bought them who didn’t. Bethesda already fixed 90% of the duping problem when they nerfed TSEs into oblivion and the nerf is now essentially pointless if they’re going to delete 90% of them from the game anyway.
---
I’m sorry if you think my reading comprehension is bad, but consider that maybe the fact that you used a legal precedent for theft to condemn those benefitting from video game glitches, and then followed it up with what is ostensibly a string of non sequiturs, that maybe your argument wasn’t too coherent to begin with.
---
But while we’re on the subject here’s a legal term that you can Google if you find yourself so inclined; innocent until proven guilty. It’s a fairly common phrase in the American judicial system and if you’d like I can spoon feed you a step by step walkthrough on how I personally believe it applies to this situation. 
---
Not if their purge methods require taking down the servers indefinitely.
---
Yea since the nerf i don't care if my tse double barrel disappears.
---
I actually made a melee focused character since i can't trust guns in this game anymore.
---
Based on no evidence at all. Reading these posts here, zero of my friends on... no one I know is playing anymore. Entire discord empty. 
---
What killed my incentive to trade was the capped weight, not this...  
---
And I never suggested trading X good item for Y crap item, but the "God rolls" "awesome" items and were supposed to be exceptionally rare and when a ton of them show up on the market at the same time there is generally a reason
---
But again I was cautious 
---
The bombs peoples launch on Whitespring every day.
---
It's RNG. You can't farm for a specific item.
---
Boohoo, you were dealing in counterfeit. Dont play anymore. 
---
sad sad man :)
---
Wow, such sympathy for the people who like to trade!
---
Can't wait till they nuke nerf, take away, or otherwise Fun Police into the ground things you like!
---
Thanks for the response. Didn't want to log in and suddenly be missing something and wondered how they were able to track items. Hopefully this helps fix stability issues. 
---
ok good wasnt just me who didnt understand what he's talking about
---
Go to the ski resort next to Top of the World and collect the ski poles on all the different racks out front, you. Can get 73 aluminum in like 2 minutes
---
Did you miss the “exploding” part?  They go boom. The troubleshooter’s gatling was a total wrecking ball in the silos.  The hunter effect wasn’t good on the shotgun, but with demo expert and shotgun perks it still packed an immense wallop because of the exploding effect. 
---
K.
---
I know people who do the right thing. Never duped once in their playthrough but have bought items from that market which they don't know are duped or not. They have farmed caps hard too earn those items and you think that is fair? Also this doesn't mean I'm for duping. I'm for people who have put a lot of hrs in losing all they're hard earned work
---
Morgantown highschool - Check the cafeteria and court (pick up pumpkin lantern, golf balls, bowling pins, plastic plates and utensils)
---
Then run to the [cat house](https://imgur.com/a/R3J0qOK) \- Pick up all the cat food bowls
---
Watoga Highschool - Pick up all the plates and utensils from the cafeteria.
---
Do the 3 things above daily, you should get more than 200 plastics per run. Sometimes if you see the plastic junks all gone, someone has beat you to it. Relog and try again.
---
Aren't new bugs added in every update?
---
Why are you here? Is this supposed to help those of us still playing? Get this trash off the page.
---
There are several mods known to cause issues, for example "show health" and if you've not updated the perk menu etc it can cause CTDs 
---
People are running around sniffing glue now.
---
What? Are you aiming for most stupid comment of the year? I have found 3 high end weapons 2 AAE's and a BE, but  I have traded my way into 15 high end weapons. Now I am a duper? No idiot, I am just someone who has had some luck and can manage caps. Probably like 75% of the people playing this game. If you don't trade in this game YOU might be a little special.
---
So you're saying they wont do the work because it's.... hard? Man if I had used that as an excuse in any of my previous jobs... Lol
---
I love the reddit Market 76 discord and use it a lot and have found a lot of great, legit vendors who I've become good friends with; but in the back of my mind I feel like a lot of those weapons and the way the price of serums dropped from like 1000 caps to 100 caps in no time flat isn't all that... natural.
---
The way the statement is phrased though it sounds like they have been doing their homework and have already identified who has been naughty and who has been nice. So hopefully their "hit list" of players accounts to wipe items from are people who are making a real profit from it and not players who unknowingly traded or bought (with caps) a weapon/items from someone who duplicated a thousand of them. :\[
---
You know if Rose was still alive she would be decked out in this pink gear. Princess bed and all. 
---
Let's wait and see about anthem shall we first?
---
It's not like they patched the wrong version if the game and released it, unpatching the previous patch. Relax my man, Todd's got this.
---
Reddit isn't a forum for real discussions, get out while you can
---
I call the other weeks patches "Black Tuesday" so yours is
---
Pretty fitting :)
---
This is my concern too. I've never gotten an item from another player, but I have bought legendaries from the venders. Never anything super great, so I assume they're not duped, but you never know. Plus, if Bethesda deletes valid items like that, I won't be able to tell the difference!
---
"and Fallout 76 is the best game ever"
---
Accuracy versus sensation. Remember that when you talk about what people write!
---
I didn't insult the dude or his wife, I told him to stop using his emotional responses as an argument. 
---
And if you think popularity indicates truth, you've got another thing coming as you age. xD
---
We’d be fortunate to only get 21 more...  
---
Hooah!
---
Doesn't show up in the build menu if it isn't your camp
---
Second 
---
I’m not saying there was one. I’m just speculating. I’d like to think they had a plan of what they wanted this game to be so there had to be a roadmap. I think they thought PvP would be bigger than it is. Player reaction to the survival mode announcement and outcry for PvE servers begged to differ and would’ve put a roadblock on that roadmap, lol. If that’s the case then they probably had to retool their roadmap to be more accomodating to the majority of PvE players. 
---
I’m just speculating on why it’s been so long and we haven’t gotten a roadmap. I’m pretty sure they had to either postpone or scrap their original plans, come up with something new, etc. and they def wouldn’t wanna share half baked ideas for us to tear apart. They’re probably taking their time and trying to make things right for the long term. 
---
[PS4 - 2013/non-Pro] I can craft armor ANYWHERE, unlike months ago (Stash needs to be near/opened?)
---
As long as I gave the Plan| learned, materials on me/in Stash|Stash container and doesn’t need to be close by.
---
Not sure what is happening in your complaint.
---
Good luck.
---
I bet you'll be surprised what goes "poof" tomorrow.
---
24 players at least
---
Wonder how many people will fall for this, by not reading the last line. 
---
I have two things I got from other players that I wonder if duped or not.  Guess I'll be finding out soon. Was going to sell them to a vendor, because I don't really use them, but now I'm curious, so I'll keep them and see if they disappear or stay. 
---
Where do you find the sellers that are selling the TSE if not on eBay? That’s where they are selling their goods. 
---
And as far as the price, go on eBay right now and type in TSE fallout 76, they’re selling for 5 each and 15 for bundles. 
---
Imagine a game informer magazine back before internet, but it was full of everything wrong with all the games you love. Sure let me tune right in. 
---
What platform you on? Ill come take a look
---
At this very moment I guess I could agree with that, but within the historical context of EA, I don't think I would agree
---
I bought tse’s but i figured they were dupped
---
Nice! at least you get the atoms!
---
Damn lol I love this
---
Guess you better quit then.
---
Where is all the extreme weather???
---
I haven’t been to Harper’s Ferry yet, but I did come across that 3* super mutant on accident actually. Dropped garbage, but I’m glad to know he shows up regularly 
---
I feel like I saw that too... The vast amount of bug fixes and then possibly unforeseen exploits that arose likely forced them to pump the brakes. 
---
scrap standard combat armor, isn't a rare plan to gain via doing that. Only took me 3 times. 
---
Heretic. Praise be Rose, who has risen from her mortal form to that of an immortal robot. 
---
Just had to, because of my raider flair. 
---
Black Tuesday? How come there is no sale going on!?!
---
Is ammo an item that can be duped? I’m a new player, and a high level player came across me today and dropped off a shit ton of ammo for me. 
---
here they come all the D people coming out saying why why i have  legitimately got these 15 tse weapons hahaha. when most people playing have never found 1.
---
Dont bullshit people and Bethesda and just accept whats happening tomorrow :) 
---
I think everything is being tracked, but they didn't have the means to query the data before. 
---
Impossible, I literally just did that quest and no plans :(
---
&gt; I did 11 Uranium Fever runs today
---
playing the game as intended… 
---
(mea culpa too)
---
I wish I had a chem bench in the nuke zone, I had farmed a lot of violet flux last night, but in the short time it took me to get out of the nuke zone was d/ced and all the violet flux had turned into inert flux when I logged back in.
---
Same here. You are not alone. All Legendaries are legit and not even farming
---
I am mad lately server jumping for the fcng Witch Costume
---
:/
---
Yeah but how did you get “hundreds,” I’m not trying to be a dick I’m just asking. Maybe you know a realistic way to  accurately estimate. I figured it was doing around NMS numbers, so about 2,000
---
Please tell me what items are duped:
---
TSE Handmade (oh there's a no brainer)
---
The BE Handmade I traded for today?
---
The AAE Shotgun I traded for today?
---
The Chameleon / +1 STR / Sentinel it took me forever to trade for a month ago?
---
You are an idiot.  I can't wait until they do "dupe delete 2.0" and your items go "poof".  I won't be around then for you to cry to.
---
Just sold mine tonight. They are going for 1500
---
Lol. sorry fella, I'm a filthy casual. I'll invest in Bethesda till the day I die. 
---
Wait, isn’t that the point of updates? To see how much you can break?
---
EA? Are you high? Go ask current/former SWTOR players about Bioware/EA greatness in the history of that game.
---
Careful, he's a hero.
---
Only like a few thousand total a day you can get from all vendors combined
---
Im not bullshitting. I have 2 accounts. I grind 2400 caps a day after work. Do that 5 outa 7 days a week and youve got enough to buy whatever you want
---
you do realize eventually they'll get their stuff back and you'll still be oneshot/deprived of loot from tagging, right?
---
I spent 3K on a TSE Lever action.  If its gone, I am very  with that to get rid of all the dupes.
---
Sure seems like it!
---
&gt; No one can successfully sue anyone over this stuff.
---
Uh, nobody is realistically thinking they can sue over losing an in-game item. That’s absurdity. 
---
&gt; But if your TSE is gone tomorrow, I'm not going to be sympathetic: **You were on what the law calls** ***constructive notice*** **of the wave of duping and selling, meaning you'd certainly have known if you were paying attention, and if you didn't know, it was because you had your head in the sand. You're** ***not*** **a BFP.**
---
They were on notice of what - to not trade? It’s not like it’s the black market; it’s the only way to trade and there are no verified products. Bethesda gave no prior notice that people shouldn’t trade because the items might be arbitrarily deleted. Zero notice. When an item is stolen and sold irl, somebody is actually harmed and the item goes to the original person - none of that is relevant here. They’re just springing this on us and will fuck over a bunch of their players who did nothing but buy an exciting weapon with a large portion of their caps. 
---
Who cares about anything legal - that’s irrelevant. What matters is that tomorrow somebody who spent a lot of time grinding 10k caps for what’s now a very average tse lever action is going to open their game and have only the extremely mediocre shit they’ve gotten through their own crappy rng. Instigating rolling pins and the like. Then they quit playing and the game starts dying even more than it was before. 
---
Great job bethesda, once again. Why don’t they actually spend their time on some new content that makes all the nerfed lvl 45-50 tse’s irrelevant anyway rather than fucking with regular people’s characters. There are five potential stars for legendaries and plenty of new potential attributes - fucking use them. 
---
Just a thought - since Bethesda can’t seem to create an intelligent one themselves.
---
I would rather be a full reset. At least everyone is starting over. 
---
But running a script which we already know how buggy Bethesda can be. That actually is scarier. 
---
Or, "i owned 500 TSE blah blah blah... and got away with it" cause you know someones gonna say it.
---
So Curie is getting a sister?
---
I’m making up a number. There can’t be many left with all of the different waves that left. 2000 people isn’t enough to keep these servers up. They’ll pull them since they’re not selling skins and the initial sales are over. 
---
Game was DOA with the team it launched with. 
---
I mean, we know that they're about to vanish from the game, and TSEs already stopped being retardedly overpowered a few weeks ago. Obviously the prices aren't going to be what they used to. But there were some people advertising them on the trading subreddits before they started cracking down. I don't remember the name but one of the posts linked to some site that looked like a really shady version of ebay
---
I do not concur. It is about creating the best gaming environment for the largest audience.
---
Idiots running around blasting and greifing with tse ect was ruining the game for casual players (the largest group). 
---
Popularity does not indicate truth, but when you have a half a dozen or more people who have explicitly told you that you're wrong, explained in which ways, and then proceed to just ignore and bluster your way out of everything they said maybe it's time for some introspection.
---
Last reply for real now.
---
[Black Tuesday](https://www.thebalance.com/black-tuesday-definition-cause-kickoff-to-depression-3305819)  
---
It's the stock market crash that started the Great Depression.    
---
On that day and following weeks hundreds of people people rained from the sky's commuting suicide as they suddenly owned nothing...  
---
Generally was one of those epically bad days in history 
---
Oh ok. I wasn't aware you could get it from scraping. Thanks!!!
---
I guess you haven’t met Rose yet. You’ll see when you find her. 
---
They should have given us more stash space at the same time as they cleared out the dupes, that would have been even better ;)
---
You’re saying 2k isn’t enough to keep servers up but are also saying only a few hundred are playing?
---
I have a feeling Bethesda will somehow mess this up
---
Lmao Dupocalypse. Hell. Yes. I love it. 😂
---
Feminism bro
---
Will do! Thanks for the info!!!
---
... game servers won’t be online in a year or two with those sort of numbers. 
---
"These aren't my pants!"
---
Thank god my AA deathclaw gauntlet dropped for me in game and wasn't sold 
---
I mean if we spent the money already, why not try and squeeze a little more enjoyment out of it?
---
Someone's upset about losing their duped items.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but most cheaters never get caught. cheating *is* a great way to get ahead. you like to tell yourself otherwise but it simply isn't true.
---
took me 700 hours to drop a crappy explosive shotgun. meanwhile, I'm sure lots of people will fall through the cracks.
---
I’ve been having the opposite effect. Have 2 cards equipped, picklock skill is 3. 
---
Thanks radworms. These issues may be related. Have you had radworms then recovered?
---
Or watoga
---
Afraid not. 1* still won't be worth much. A nice 2* will be worth a lot though 
---
Or it's because the game is bad and everyone just offed themselves
---
Insulting people does not gain their support, and neither does insulting something they like and you don't. Sorry, but it's the truth. 
---
If thats the case i should be fine. They are all completely different. And most are lvl 45 with only the tse effect. So I may just be worried over nothing. 
---
Deplorables*
---
Well trust me they were 2-5 dollars each even before the nerf at the height of their popularity 
---
My grandad was an idiot, my dad was an idiot, i'm an idiot, and my kid will be an idiot. It just fckin works.
---
Man, I don’t even have one jet pack. What is this.
---
I've got a Vampiric Swing speed that's pretty rocking... 
---
A) You don't have to "tune" in, and just because you don't enjoy a thing doesn't mean it shouldn't exist
---
B) This isn't a magazine this is the internet. There is literally infinite room for all kinds of content that caters to all kinds of people with differing tastes
---
C) Game informer was first issued in 1991 and the internet was public in 1990 so there was no Game Informer before the internet and your analogy has failed before it even began.
---
You need to understand a lot of people can only handle things that are in front of them and cannot plan for futures. They are too busy dealing with stuff in front due to lack of abilities/intelligence. 
---
Yeah it would be an incredibly, very, super small chance of two-shot, exploding, weight reduction, and the same base CND rolling on two weapons. If they expand that out to like 10, it's nigh impossible.
---
Now the question is whether we trust their SQL-fu
---
Yeah, you worked a little bit on trading.  So you might lose a thing or two.
---
Tell all the people in the sub-reddit who have been trading for MONTHS.
---
Half of their stuff is probably going to disappear tomorrow.
---
Items that were legit bought by vendors who in turn  bought them from duper’s will disappear.
---
Nice assumptions. Sorry but they aren’t correct. I quit playing once my items started disappearing out my inventory for no reason. A common bug lately. 
---
Never had a duped item because I never traded with anyone. Besides junk. 
---
Bug Fixes? New Content? Fuck no lets delete stuff!!! lol
---
Yeah this sounds right. I could see them just deleting all of one super specific item. 
---
Hundreds of hours of work! You on Xbox? I can craft jet packs for t45, t51 and t60. 
---
Again, I am aware the situation was different. My point is that bad, rushed games CAN be fixed. While I highly doubt they will, it's not impossible.
---
You just named all op stuff. Be and b unarmed only started getting used recently because of tse nerf so i doubt them 
---
Where is it ?? 
---
But someone said in Reddit that they offer free serum for people visiting their camp...
---
Haha, seriously. Their response: “Submit a ticket and Bethesda is looking into it...” 🙄
---
Must have lvl 6 Makeshift Warrior*
---
I do I traded one off a few weeks ago.
---
fullscreen. probably cant hurt at this point, hopefully you can get things figured out!
---
I am a shotgunner too, started out that way anyway. Nuka cola cups are bomb for plastic.  They now give only cloth from the patch bug, so you have to find cup with straw, or stacks of Nuka cups. That’s my favorite. And white enamel buckets. 
---
My main plastic hunting grounds are:  Tyler county fairgrounds, cups everywhere, Camden park has cups everywhere. Watoga High School has plastic plates and forks everywhere.  Fort defiance has 50 enamel buckets inside. 
---
You can hit That round on a Monday and in one night bulk down 50 plastic (500) especially using the ammo maker card. You’ll get plenty of stuff for shells. 
---
I will spend a full day recycling and hunting scrap, break it all down then the next night let’s go kick some ass. 
---
HOW ARE WE GOING TO KILL SBQ NOW?!?! TELL ME!
---
Communication is not a priority for Bethesda, creating the *impression* of communication however is.
---
"Are you serious right now or just trying to waste my time?"
---
What sort of entitled asshole are you to ask that and act that way? This is voluntary, you're free to not reply. 
---
You're the one at fault, don't be mistaken. You're being downvoted in a Fallout 76 subreddit about a video pointing of many bugs in said game, so this audience usually would defend the game... but even they think you're obnoxious. 
---
Please, just calm down. 
---
Well at least I'll get to keep the ones I found and didnt trade for. Im a little salty that i traded an explosive hunting rifle for a god roll melee as now im worried it was duped and didnt realize at the time. 
---

---
nice insight genius.
---
It's not a guaranteed drop.
---
it's a two road. I am happy as hell for bethesda to make a move, but alot of unforeseen events may take place, which kind of makes me a bit skeptic.
---
And as the guy says in his comment here, that it could have a backlash on the playerbase if many get screwed over. Which would go against tge purpose of making improvements.
---
So it definitely needs to be done, but hopefully in the right way.
---
Downvote to you for believing politics was brought into this.  The other post was just a generic description of how internet arguments go. 
---
Lol keep crying. Your sweet, sweet tears are like candy to me.
---
Depends, will it go down on us??
---
I just learned the ammo factory Saturday and got out of there killing 3 scorch beasts and 500 newly minted rounds of .556. Ranked up too. Very good location. 
---
It threatens his fragile ego about a game he/she enjoys but didn't even make. 
---
No idea why. 
---
That's the kicker...  
---
I can get my 100fps in full screen, the patches killed Windowed mode :(
---
hey cool no one is forcing you to play on the new pvp servers either.
---
What about Black Friday?
---
not in the way you thinking
---
Yeah. Pretty much under the oppinion now that if youve ever traded with another player youre at risk of losing items
---
Yep, pretty much.
---
I still have warm feelings for the Ark team.
---
**If the Ark team puts out ANY new game I will buy it!  I don't care what the title is about as long it's multiplayer survival.**
---
Why?  Because they did a good job, made the customers happy, and were consistently providing fun.
---
If a deal is too good to be true, it probably is (tse). It doesn't matter the methods used to come into their wealth. They only exchanged it for a false sense of achievement. 
---
In other words, they knew what they were buying wasn't legit. Caps don't exactly grow on trees...having to farm caps for dupes is a terrible argument.
---
Sure.
---
Who said those are the only things? Those are just examples.
---
Sunshine and farts?  
---
Bethesda would be like 'surprise muthafucka!!' when they wipe everything and we'd be like 'no... no it wasn't' 
---
Another terrible day is history, and it comes once a year, and each year it's worse then the last... 
---
Besides if you on this sub, you should care more about CyberMonday!
---
Items don't have unique ID they will just remove most powerful items from the world duped or not 🤗
---
That's... that's not how git or any version control actually works.
---
They care about the game, not the players. Have fun.
---
Oh boy I didn’t know another suffering was coming tomorrow, maybe they will give us something great, but likely melee will get nurfed because it’s the only thing I can count on. 
---
The insane vitriol flowing over the dupe purge is probably the best part of this game for me so far.
---
I just know my tse handmand I traded a x_01 jet pack mod for is as good as gone. I should have known better... Back to my instigating guess rifle.
---
Because someone cheated a game, made a ton of copies and costed them only a few minutes of their time. And now the  consumer is paying 50 bucks for an ingame item. Also those are the game breaking guns at the time. THEN have the audacity to complane about atom shop prices. 
---
Yep, I gave Bethesda crap for that too.
---
The capped weight screwed dupers, **but also screwed legit traders.**
---
I know several people who had real "player shops" that stopped doing it after the weight nerf.
---
I'm not over weight on any of my characters, but I knew how it would impact those other people :(
---
I swear there's someone in the Bethesda office with a Super Sledge that their only job is to NERF FUN.
---
Ammo is fucking everywhere, any type you don't use you can get thousands of even casually playing a few hours a week.
---
Anything used to be dupable as long as it was an item in your inventory.
---
I'm pretty sure that they know exactly what they are doing here.
---
how long have you worked at BGS?
---
This sadly sounds correct. On the bright side any surviving equipment will be worth more tomorrow I guess. 
---
but 911, I bought the cocaine with legit money!!
---
In the Super Duper Mart. Sometimes.
---
Sometimes he gets pissed at his fellow robots who are roaming streets attacking his patrons and tries to help. 
---
You've just straight up ignored my point...they may or may not have known...that's the base problem. 5k for tse...obviously a dupe back in the day but now, most dupers have been banned so you really don't know unless they got 5x of the same item on them and only an idiot would do that. I'm talking about 20k+ sales man not cheap shit
---
Nobody buying TSE weapons for real $ cared if they were legit or not.  They wanted to one shot everything.  They did, got bored, and probably left weeks ago.
---
I’m just saying. It’s not that easy to port decades of code from one version control to another. My company took two years to stop using our old VC system and build pipeline.
---
Interesting…
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Aw, thanks!
---
Feel like I need to log in now and take a screen shot of what I currently have to compare.  Feel like after tomorrow my one and only TSE Pump will be MIA.  Nice if they placed a few caps in my pocket.  
---
Not really, definitely something you learn toward the end, or even in the silos themselves.
---
Exactly how I feel. If you haven’t eve progressed far enough in the story, let alone discover Watoga yourself, the event should be level locked. 
---
CyberMonday FTW!
---
How did that fix take 4 months???
---
Burn the dupes!!
---
I really hope my level 35 pipe pistol of mediocrity is safe.
---
FMD, imagine losing an imaginary item in a make believe world...the horror!!!  
---
Thought I was alone, it's super frustrating.
---
Exploit early, exploit often?
---
Nope. 
---
Cry moar noob [sic].
---
Wow you're a real hero.
---
Shelving a roadmap to fix a game is Meme worthy, because honestly who says that? Oh BGS
---
That's the kind of thing is like to know, just from the perspective of how do you design something like this. Versioning would be a nightmare, here even more so than usual. Maybe it would be something you'd have to go look up in a restored backup, depending on their frequency and retention strategy. That's not costly, just hard and time-consuming, two more very good reasons to not advertise that is possible to restore items. All of that is completely separate from what would be needed to identify duped inventory, which already exists in a design that's able to handle the demands of an MMO (inb4 it can't handle them, lolzzz).
---
Do you have a pin point I haven’t come across it yet. 
---
imo, to make it more compact.
---
To try to fit it all in one page, with no need to scroll
---
Seriously. Now people are just going to drop Nukes on Whitestone and farm the ghou-... Wait a second.
---
Meh I don’t even play the game anymore, they could delete all my mules and it wouldn’t matter, haven’t logged in since a week 😂
---
Get ready for your legitimately-earned gear to get deleted for being "duped" when it goes live. If they can pull this off without fucking us somehow it's a huge sign that they're getting it in gear but just expect something even minor to go wrong.
---
I'm a fanboy, sure, but a fun game is only fun as long as I don't get frustrated trying to play it.
---
the fact the letters thing works on so many levels really sells this. 
---
I hope everyone is ready for prices to skyrocket. Hopefully once they delete all duped tse they will restore the unnecessary nerf they did to the weapons and perks.
---
I get that. But you can do both at the same time to compensate, which they never do. They nerf and do nothing to compensate, then people have to complain for a month before they "hear us" and "pass it along to the devs" and then God knows how long after that they actually fix it. 
---
It's actually the other way around. Since October, critics and detractors have been systematically downvoted for making fair and critical analyses of this unprecedented piece of software. You trying to flip it around and pretend like the happy minority are being persecuted is a pathetic, transparent grasp for confirmation from other like-minded dimwits who don't understand the purpose of criticism.
---
This game will go belly up without ruthless criticism, people praising the good parts of the game are useless, they and their opinions don't contribute to fixing anything, they only reinforce the attitude of complacency Bethesda has demonstrated.
---
If you're fine with the game as is, great, but the "complainers" are only trying to make the game better than it is. Nobody wants this game to fail, but ignoring or erasing systematic criticisms of FO76's design, execution and Bethesda's management and development, is actively contributing to the collapse of the game you claim to love.
---
This ship is sinking and it needs all hands on deck to plug the leaks and get back on course, not a bunch of idiots hugboxing around a couple good features.
---
I consider myself a trader and have never duped. I deal in plans, serums, and odd outfits because they’re lightweight and I don’t need to have a mule/trader account to play traveling merchant. I can keep my wares in my stash. 
---
Sure, *some* weapons/armor dealers are dupers, but not all.  I’ve met many that aren’t, made obvious by their inventories that lacked the high end duped items. 
---
I’ve got a 51 jet pack that’s it. I’m just a little surprised you have 6 jet packs haha.
---
Yeah, glad you're enjoying someone else's problem.
---
Must be a joy to be around in real life.
---
I'm referring to someone spending a couple dollars on an item on eBay vs. the atom store. You said you Westin their mentality.
---
Yeah trading was the only saving grace for me since there simply isn’t anything to do that’s worth it in the endgame. After the carry weight thing I stopped playing so I don’t think this will affect me all too much 
---
 The gaylords who set up those ugly turret camps by the club house are just the worst. 
---
This should have been done before, even if it had to be done during every patch/update.  To wait for 3 months post-release, not sure how many months/weeks post-duping being mainstream, is a case of too little too late. 
---
Sorry we mistakenly merged this patch with an early alpha branch of Red Faction. We'll try to roll that back in the March update. Until then, enjoy Mars!
---
Dumb people always try to make others feel bad. Have fun being stupid.
---
Everyone has scrap
---
They are trying to kill the game so they can pull the team from it.
---
I bet half my armor is gone too.  I had a bunch of crap non-meta items that were just "ok".  But I do have some really end game meta pieces too.
---
i wonder how it works technically.....
---
Maybe it won’t be as bad as we think. Or maybe worse. Any word on what time it drops?
---
Who is complaining? All I have seen is posts praising the duper delete.
---
hmmm I wouldn't mind having them delete all duped items and then reverse the nerf. That would be very cool and definitely restore twoshots to the play field. It definetly would be rare as hell, so it wouldn't turn into the wild west we had prior to the nerf.
---
All player-launched explosions now explode directly on top of the player (including nukes)
---
Damage bug returns (again)
---
Stimpaks now heal you immediately but deal damage over time
---
Scorchbeast queen now drops loot from inside of your stash. If you do not pick it all up and let her despawn, everything from your stash is gone forever
---
see the misinterpretation here is "the support team can not do this" not that there isn't anyone who can't
---
Yeah true. The radstorms from F4 were pretty cool. Now we get fog that just screws up the graphics. 
---
Look for pool table balls. 
---
In Helvetia, there's a building across the stream from the yellow house with a pool table 
---
The Rusty Pick has a pool table, SW of the Charleston Fire Dept
---
Nope, he would have called him Glenn.
---
I know this is probably too much to ask but I wonder if we could expect to ever be free of our duplicate keys and such. Even if they're weightless it's frustrating to see "Poseidon Hazmat Storage Key (17)" and so on.
---
It would take too much time ($) and there would be no easy way to tell a legitimate case from a scam, my best guess
---
Fallout 76 in a big glowing nutshell.
---
i tried chatting you, will message a pic of the pin on the map 
---
If Chally Moo-Moo didn't have udders, would you still have referred to her as a...oh, wait. ;)
---
Agreed, been here all day. My farts smell like salted butter.
---
My guess is that was just a smokescreen to placate you while trying to focus on dealing with the serious bugs plaguing the current build and figuring out how to deal with the sea of duped items. 
---
It’s also likely they see no way of you proving you owned it and didn’t sell/trade/drop it so they won’t re-add it to your inventory. It wouldn’t surprise me if dupers didn’t try to use this as an exploit early on. 
---
We accidentally replaced all adhesive in the game with barbed walking cane mods.
---
Sounds like a good usage of your time and bandwidth
---
Exactly.  I had a two shot assault rifle that I loved. But when it got nerfed I went to a melee build. I would enjoy using my rifle again.
---
I am on PS4 as well and I can relate to what you're saying. I still haven't finished the main story line. I like to take everything at a slow pace, just like it was meant to be. Also, this game has indeed a LOT of content and requires a lot of time to take everything in, search notes, holos, gear etc. Finishing this game while having a normal busy life in just a couple of months, seems unbelievable to me. I want to believe that this game will be redeemed down the road, either from content or from solid patches.
---
Yeah, they could've done gradual SMALL nerfs and buffs to builds until they were balanced.
---
League of Legends does that.
---
I never felt like a nerf to a character made them "unplayable" or a buff to a character made me want to "switch my main".
---
I can't wait to see what triple nuke nerf they do to my only viable melee build.
---
If you are a legit player and you think removing all duped items is a bad thing, I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
However making the argument that they wouldn’t fix my bugged quest item for the Mistress of Mysteries quest because “support can’t do anything” when they meant to say  “we won’t do anything, sorry”
---
Support team can not, dev team can.  
---
Dev team can see when each item was created, what its values are and how it came to.  
---
All they need to do is delete any items that came into existance in mass around a single point. It is easier with weapons, armor, and food do to their CND bars.   
---
As the length on those is not the same for all of the same items of the same level. IF 3,000 TSE weapons came in to existance on one day and 1/3rd of them where all the same weapon with the same CND they know that group is duped.  
---
That is an exageration think the drop rate for the weapon would make it more like 1,054 with that 1,000 duped.   
---
like with the TSE nerf, right? or the lack of melee nerf? or all the absurd bugs added with each new patch, like rad worms affecting mutations, which are not even related?
---
yeah, I'm not so sure.
---
I've been selling Purified Water from my CAMP and have that happen, too.
---
I equip Hard Bargain 3, the sell dialog displays that I'm selling 10 waters to get 50c but then it only gives me 40c.
---
Good, here's hoping.
---
They don't care until the problem affects them personally.
---
For me, I sympathized with people even if it wasn't my problem.
---
My main is Melee, but I thought the TSE triple nuke nerf went overboard.  Three nerfs to one build?  Really?
---
I hate to say it but there are a lot of trolls in the survival gaming community.
---
Gah. This is why we can't have nice things. 
---
Nope, he's a marketing guy.  He overpromises so the dev guys can underdeliver.
---
I understand that, that really isn’t my issue. If they want to get rid of all duped items regardless of how players got them I’m okay with that, but if they were able to help players this whole time and instead decided to say “sorry support can’t do anything” when they actually could have helped.
---
It's simple. They are using a database. They should have backups. They can see items you used to have against your current data. Saying they can't prove its a scam so should do nothing is the same as saying they can't prove if a player duped an item or bought an item that another player duped then they should also do nothing 
---
For what it's worth I think they edited it and added that part in.
---
OR
---
I'm also bad at reading.
---
damn :/ im sure thats something youd love to see fixed.
---
I'm getting ready to see nukes broken like: radius increase for the entirety of the map or scorched increases like that one glitch with the bots at whitesprings
---
I think the bloodied swing speed power fist is the common dupe, no?
---
People with duped TSE's were making the game not fun for casual players (the largest group), Nerf/delete is being done for the health of the game
---
now that you posted it bethesda is probably going to patch this out
---
This is great hahaha 
---
I'm sure bleeding players is great for the health of the game.
---
Support team can't do it, Dev team can. Two completely different teams, likely in different buildings. 
---
I sit the fence on it, and my opinion will be drastically affected by the manner in which it is implemented. If the sellers of duped items don’t have the caps removed from ALL of their saves, then I have a problem with removing the duped items from their buyers as this punished players who were playing honestly and rewards the dupers by letting them keep their ill gotten caps. 
---
In truth, if all duped items are removed from everyone, the dupers should get total account wipes, as many duped items were traded for other items instead of just caps.  Anyone with a stack of more than say, 4 of the same legendary item (because there’s no legitimate way to get 4 identical legendary guns/armor that stack in your inventory) should see total wipes. 
---
They can and will and there's nothing anyone can do about it
---
Can't argue with a single point...  
---
Not one 
---
Welp there probably goes my only TSE weapon.
---
I never got any of these so called good deals.  Stuff was crazy costly duped or not.
---
You hurt my feelings.
---
I think this will actually diversify the items in the trade subreddits. For me, that’s a good thing. 
---
Damn never thought about that. Good to know!
---
Understandable, but why wouldn’t a support team member upgrade my issue to a developer support system. It didn’t have to be right away, but at least tell me that they have sent it up for someone to look into and possibly fix on my account or in a next patch.
---
My responses have always been “we will get back to you at a later date, currently nothing can be done about the issue” 
---
I fell in love with 76 like i did with 4. Its definitely worth it.
---
Poopity scoop
---
Well, rather see the CTD bugs fixed first, but long term, ya ;)
---
F that guy.  He wants to play solo offline.  He will when the servers shut down.  Then we can tell him to "Deal with it"
---
If it wasn’t for the traders and the Reddit forums I would of never received any end game stuff !!! I’m currently level 128 with a second character build my first from the beta is at 67 and I have assorted other characters that I play with both my kids . Not once have I ever rolled a TSE weApon not once !!! I’ve done the scorch queen 54 times with big groups uranium fever well over a hundred , the brotherhood of steel quest where you get the initiate paint over 200 ducking tones and have never received the paint -in all hundreds of hours grinding to not get a single 3 star end game weapon!!!!!  The  game is fucking broken!!! Had it not been for the dealers on reddit I would have been SOL!!! I don’t engage in PVP but I’ve been the victim of many attacks by people with weapons way more powerful and how do you level that field when you don’t get any love from the rng!!! I don’t have anything outstanding all my armor I acquired from grinding most of my melee weapons purchased from robot vendors after a SQ DUMP. My first explosive shotgun was a gift from a player at whitesprings who stepped in when I was getting griefed at level 50 and he gave me an executioners explosive double shotty to deal with a holes!! I’ve purchased 2 shot 50% limb damage handmade  off Reddit today from a seriously reputable dealer with great feedback no duping on  their end ever !! So what about other trades I made or purchases from people I don’t know well????? This is bullshit!!!
---
In the tech industry we call it job security
---
I haven’t played Fallout 76 in too much depth, but I grew up in Point Pleasant, and often visited the actual fairgrounds. It’s so surreal to read posts like the one above about the mothman. Thanks for playing, and come visit sometime 
---
Some complainers are trying to offer honest criticism... But many others are just trashing it for the sake of trashing it. Many people are blowing things out of proportion. And plenty of people on that one video site are knowingly reporting rumors as fact, and trying to lead some kind of sanctimonious crusade. I've lost count of how many times I've been called a bootlicker for trying to stay positive. 
---
You said it's the exact opposite of what I said, yet you help me prove my point? 
---
Or maybe they should get their shit in order. This stuff is server side. When they hear about a dupe take the server down and do a rollback of a few hours. Fix the issue and you don't end up with situations like this that in the long run is killing the game 
---
And if there isn’t I’m sure you’ll make an alt account and play the role yourself 
---
Hence my point about it being to placate you. They knew they *could* put it back in your inventory, they just wouldn’t.
---
That said, I’m not entirely sure they could accomplish it.  I’m curious to see how the dupe purge goes tomorrow. 
---
So yeah you just proved my statement. Keep defending this dumpster fire. 
---
Mmm. I have checked they're all up to date and nobody else has reported issues with them. Plus, Bethesda had not made changes (at least no changes that required client updates) so there should be an issue.  Other than the one mod I updated, the only other logical reason is server stability (or rather, instability) 😎
---
If it keeps happening I'll run without mods for a while.  Thanks!
---
Then you might be (and I hope you are) fine...  
---
My overall point was often when the deal seemed too good, "drop everything and complete that trade" good, it usually was too good to be true (well not duped)
---
No, they have no history of messing up patches or screwing things up, so there's no need to worry about them dicking around in everyone's inventories
---
If it does work that way, I guess that's so it doesn't place the camp down and trap someone in a foundation.
---
The only opinion i gave was it seems very doubtful that you count and track player levels. 
---
And as you stated, i was correct. 
---
I would love to visit actually but I doubt I would see a real Mothman :(
---
Yup 
---
I wonder if heavily modifying a duped weapon could/would make it harder for Bethesda to find... 
---
Any dupers want to chime in here? Promise we won't flag your responses. Promise. 
---
And what of those 2 or 3 people who actually got a TSE from a drop? C'mon Bethesda, WHAT ABOUT THOSE 2 OR 3 PEOPLE? 
---
Am I running those digits correctly,and that's 4 trillion glass?
---
Oh no, now I have a chance in PvP with my 120 damage hunting rifle. 
---
Understandable, I wouldn’t necessarily expect to have my issue fixed in an hour, but at least tell me that my problem has be upgraded to be looked into by a developer. 
---
I would just like more transparency in the issues, you know? Being told there is nothing we can do, when they mean there is nothing “support” can do is very frustrating. Especially when I’ve been stuck in the MoM quest-line for over a month.
---
Some player will leave, more will be able to enjoy the game as a result, imho
---
I'm ready for the shit storm when Bethesda accidentally deletes legitimate content while trying to remove duplicated content.  Lets be real, their patch execution has been pretty horrific so far, for every problem fixed they cause another.  Should we really be expecting it to go off without a hitch tomorrow?  There will definitely be some duppers lying and throwing a fit but I won't be surprised if there are some legitimate screw ups as well.
---
I am impressed with these morons that seem to think that Bethesda can do no wrong. Its like some kind of mindless worship. Bethesda has posted no warning that this was going to happen. If they had said it at the start I would still have the 3 items I had legitimately acquired.
---
BTW if you still have the AAE sub-machine gun I traded you, hang onto it, i can guarantee that's legit. 
---
I came across a little first aid kit that had a shit ton of stuff in it, hundreds of bullets, guns, over 300 plastic and steel, 50 stem packs, 15 fusion cores, tons of plans and a bunch of other stuff. I thought I hit the motherlode! I started taking some stuff and more stuff started appearing. No one else was around. Was that from a duper or just a nice person who left stuff for people?
---
Well, since I'm not sure how to share links, just check out r/ChinaIsFree. 
---
If you want to talk numbers, check out trophies/achievements. Only 30% of accounts made it to level 25. That's not good
---
Yessir. 
---
Versioning is expensive and difficult and necessary 
---
I spent hours and hours trading... In the discords, in both subreddits. 
---
 Active on this subreddit and the other fallout subs...where was this everyone knows list?  I never seen it once.
---
We will know if a bunch of players complain about “losing all my legit  TSE Weapons” and no one talks about any legitimate losses to items what shouldn’t be considered duped, like super duper item creation.
---
I bet if you painted it with something you purchased from the Atom Shop it wouldn’t get deleted.
---
Boo fuckin hoo. Duped items need to go.
---
Ahhh I see what you are trying to say now. And I agree with you about industrial inertia. 
---
You never know 😦👻👾🥴
---
CTDs aren't server side, they are local, check your windows application logs and you'll likely see some red warnings and details on the crash 
---
Fuck yes! Can’t wait for pvp to not be filled with TSE shotguns
---
Down side to those people maybe; removing duplicated over-powered items is undeniably a positive for the playerbase as a whole.
---
I don't know/am not sure.
---
There are other posts that address this more elloquently and accurately than I.
---
No there wasn't but if it was done server side there wouldn't necessarily be any downtime
---
I was doing an event at land view lighthouse (level 27) where you have to put bioluminescent fluid into the lamp to summon the mothman. I completed it with the help of a level 50-ish guy. When it was done a level 1, “Wise Mothman” spawned in. It was friendly and after a picture with it I got to “commune” with it. The O wise and powerful Mothman shared his wisdom with I, but his lowly servant and now I shall actively seek the family of his followers so that I may be accepted in a haven of safety and faith. 
---
They ban people now based on item creation rate... Wonder how many people have been banned for moving their camps, lol.
---
I laugh cuz that could have been me so many times when I've moved my camp... 😔
---
They have never claimed that they, as a whole, can't restore or remove items. The support team probably can't and simply says that in response to a ticket. "Support cannot restore..." etc. Maybe once they get their shit in order they'll give some better tools to those tools.
---
They say they can't find out which items were duped or not, but then say they can find out which items were duped or not. Either way, they're lieing, whether it be with their initial claim, or their new claim.
---
Actually, some Fallout 76 purchasers tried to start a class action against Bethesda, claiming that the game was brought to market with too many defects to be commercially releasable. Their lawsuit was immediately sent to a binding arbitration panel, where no class action is available, and where the costs to the would-be plaintiffs will run to the thousands of dollars, mostly for the arbitrator's fee in writing up an opinion (copied from Bethesda's lawyers' briefs) saying that they have no right to complain, no warranties were made, and the EULA and TOS preclude such complaints. You watch: Someone tomorrow will be arguing "Let's sue." Most lawyers aren't stupid enough to take such a case, though, not even on an hourly rate basis.

Have you read the click-through agreements, by the way? You say you weren't warned they could do this. It's their game, you own nothing, and they can do whatever they damn well please, even if it's arbitrary. They can delete anyone's or everyone's anything for good reasons, bad reasons, or no reasons at all, and be within their legal rights. (Obviously it would have marketing repercussions; and I'm not denying that this will have those.)
---
Ask for players being "f\*ck\[ed\] over": They're at most being deprived of a temporary windfall that not only was unplanned, but contrary to all of Bethesda's plans, which had the practical effect of wildly un-balancing the game. I have zero sympathy for that.
---
Me to lmao, honestly barely use it anymore aa double barrel to the chin works just as good
---
how about a drill?
---
Upvoted for the sole fact that you used the term “rogue ferret”
---
I chuckled at the 5000 canned meat xD
---
They will do that if no solution can be found. They can not give back deleted items and there are a few there that think if an item is lost then you don't need it back. Atleast one of them I ended up with took me going public with the problem to get some one to come and look at it.  
---
Still couldn't solve the problem and as a result they moved it to the dev team. I have 10% of my camp budget locked. 
---
Pretty sure you can "launder" it through a vendor and it'd be fine.
---
Oh and one more for ya..
---
It seems like you are the one trying hard to prove your opinion by providing absolute bs facts. 
---
Maybe no pa builds will become viable. 
---
That is just it...  not his problem so he laughs at others.  He is casual and dont care because its not his problem.  Its not wasting 100's of his hours of progress.  I think players like him just want a single player game anyway and have zero interest in online social aspects of the game.  They probably hate them.
---
**Both trading reddits will die after this.**
---
You'll never be able to trade without wondering "is the item I'm getting duped and going to be deleted next week".
---
They seem to be better at REMOVING content than ADDING content.
---
I bought the BoS plans at Sunnytop.
---
BWAHAHAHAHA!!!!  This is exactly why I never bought anything or traded with a suspected duper.   Everyone was saying that Bethesda has no way of tracking this shit, etc. Well guess what? They do. 
---
Think about how many innocent players have bought duped items without realizing it, and now they're gonna lose their main weapons because of someone else's actions.
---
Agreed, what may have been overeager incompetence early on looks pretty clearly like a classic asset flip at this point. They're doing next to nothing to manage this game.
---
Second on Watoga gym floor. Plastic pumpkins, golf balls, stacks of plates, and bowling pins 
---
I better get my TSE Harpoon gun now.  How many do you have left?
---
Ummm pretty sure there would be, you can't change a core mechanic acrossed the world instances without forcing them to refresh, plus our ESM's reflect the servers active files, and has been proven over and over on PC 
---
Im saying your "good deals" are fictional coming from someone who spent a lot of hours trading.
---
9am tomorrow
---
No warning, no debate, just move in steamroll and delete.
---
I wish I never got into trading in Fallout 76.  Just wasted effort and time.
---
I should've done like my friends did and look for a new game to play.
---
Could be worse.
---
Imagine spending 50 hours farming whitesprings for your dream rifle and it’s nerfed into oblivion the next day.
---
Oh good, I can sleep in after writing jokes all night to reply with tomorrow :D Don't bring servers back too quick Bethesda!
---
Got it. Look out for pool tables! Thanks!!!
---
What time zone is that? Want to know when to log and see the damage 
---
you need to learn to relax like your buddy there
---
Nahhh i’m just a girl who likes a goddamn colour, the atomic shop can choke tbh, I just have a shit ton of atom since the beta from the challenges and I haven’t bought anything with it yet. 
---
They've clearly implemented a way to detect duped items with this. If they're smart they're going to implement automatic bans when duped items are detected on your account. Clearing existing duped items is necessary before they do this to protect innocent people who unwittingly traded for duped items. 
---
It's a drumhead
---
Yeah, 95% of my friends quit already and are playing new games.
---
I feel stupid for not following them :(
---
Lol republican? gotta admit I didnt see that coming hahaha
---
You forgot the "every weapon in the game is underpowered" threads.
---
I have good gear I’ve traded a lot for. Whether any of  it’s duped or not, I don’t know for sure. I can speculate as to what probably is and isn’t, but there’s no way of knowing.  Other items I know aren’t as they’re drops or from drops that friends got. Problem is going to be how it’s implemented.
---
And at this point, it’s like fixing a leak on the Titanic.  Might be just a *tad* late. This problem should have been address months ago. Once duped items started showing up they should have implemented a fix immediately and wiped duped inventories.  Now the plague has spread to countless players via trading who will now possibly be afflicted by the purge. This will alienate a lot of players, especially consider the most duped items (TSEs) were already nerfed into the dirt. 
---
Hahahaha COWARD! I feel like a 3 min timer would be enough that started when the bag was taken. I've been unlucky a few times and had wasteland miles in between my bag and spawn. With a 3 minute pvp timer in a nuke zone you could honestly probably still get away with it. It would just add an extra lil spiciness to your thievery.
---
With how high the tension is between players and Bethesda, if inventories are fucked up, especially wiping all items, it'll be the final straw for a vast many players. Especially since it definitely won't fix the game, but just leave plenty of things still broken.
---
You know what? I did forget it... 
---
Look man I understand that people have problems with the game, but some people don't. So we don't need you or anyone who disagrees to insult us by calling us hugboxing idiots. That was what I said in the post. So you telling me it's the exact opposite, then insulting us for saying it's good, (which is what you literally said was the opposite) doesn't help your case. You just wasted your time by writing that.
---
There’s already several on the FO76 bazaar. Shits hilarious. They’re talking about signing class action law suit. “We spent time cheating and got caught, let’s sue”. What a joke
---
If you were to spec your build into it, then it could probably still do some good damage. The fire rate might hold it back though. Not to mention respeccing isn't easy.
---
This is a brilliant way to observe the 90th anniversary of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Will we get a limited-time bonus to submachine guns?
---
It seems that they're better at REMOVING content from the game (trading) than they are at ADDING content to the game.
---
**The trading reddits are going to die after this.**
---
Same here. A TSE handmade rifle with a damn nice drum mag. already had nerfed damage.
---
Let's face it, it's probably duped since legendary monsters don't drop ANYTHING remotely interesting.
---
Lol fo76 bazaar has been a corrupt shitshow for a while now, the mods break their own rules and don’t even try to hide it
---
I mean, I get the frustration. But do you really want all the duped items to stay in the game? It’s broken enough as it is, do we really want the game to be saturated with top tier items?
---
I’d be down for a full wipe of the servers if they really have the duping problem fixed completely. Get rid of all the other good loot that people got *because* they used guns that they duped or bought from duper’s (many of them with real money). 
---
People are bitching that there’s nothing to do end game because the market was saturated with the best guns available. They buy a top tier gun, then they get bored because they don’t have to actually get the gun themselves. 
---
&gt; It’s a fairly common phrase in the American judicial system and if you’d like I can spoon feed you a step by step walkthrough on how I personally believe it applies to this situation. 
---
No, that's not necessary. I've had my law degree &amp; license since 1980, so your personal beliefs about criminal law aren't something that interests me, from a spoon or otherwise.
---
I'm content to let anyone else reading this to draw their own conclusions, and I think our conversation is done. Enjoy your whining. If you're leaving the game, that's for the good, as far as I'm concerned.
---
I bet they still use visual source safe.  Probably no updates because the guy checked out the files and went on vacation for week.
---
Nah I've heard kids say moo moos
---
Fallout is the only apocalyptic title I even play due to it's unique level of weirdness. 
---
It's a feature, not a bug.
---
Yeah, like, what the hell. You're just sitting there slouching on the side of the couch, and then some serious-looking guy covered in metal armor just comes over and acts like he owns the place!
---
They need to literally nuke every server. 2 minutes before server downtime just unleash nukes until everything crashes and then full reset. Bethesdas statement following downtime and patch "everything died in the nukes" thats how you do a full reset.
---
You didn't do your homework and get a name, address, and social security number of every trader you ever met?
---
Did you do a criminal background check to make sure they hadn't committed any crimes or are dealing in less than reputable merchandise?
---
Shame on you!  The Fun Police are here to take you away now.
---
Should you decide to have any fun in the future, the Fun Police will be notified and put you away again.
---
I feel like theyre gonna fuck up and wipe entire inventories
---
Yep!
---
I’m really excited to see what exactly is missing from my inventory tomorrow. I could really use the extra 50gb on my PS4 right now
---
&gt;Caps will no longer just be something to wipe your ass with
---
people will still be doing trades only for valuable items,caps are literally useless in this game you can't even pay  to repair your gear with caps lmao
---
I am in front of Slocum Joe's in the forest. The Mire's too freaky for me. lvl 1xx here
---
That’s not true it’s just the way the market is. There is no standard price on anything so people let stuff go at varying prices depending on their trading experience. 
---
There is really no one way to tell. 
---
Real money transanctions exist since diablo 2
---
there are lots of people that would rather pay cash than grind for hours 
---
Glad I stocked up on Company Tea.
---
Damn that must be sweet. I have a 1 star anti-armor I have fun with 
---
Cool im sure ill lose most items i traded for. Not my fault the economy was crap, and paid a bit extra with the assurance they were legit but lets be honest, most likely not. Even more reason I doubt ill start the game up anytime soon. At this point they might as well do a full reset on all items aside from those people found themselves, as its been a gamble trading and not the buyers fault. Now some people will get lucky having traded with honest traders and others will get shafted.
---
I really think their best solution was seasons or a new mode that started everyone fresh after fixing any exploits that allowed duping.
---
I couldn’t even put items into my artillery box 
---
This is part of Bethesda's 50-million bobblehead strike rule.
---
*Mmm...* Company Tea...
---
Nobody is going to be fine tomorrow.  Every trader is going to get hit.
---
More than once I had people offer multiple TSE for a piece of Sentinel gear (non-Assassin's).  
---
Too good to be legit.
---
More then a couple times opening conversations involved "I've got TSE's for trade" and I respond with the fact I'm in the market for anything but TSE's and I get radio silence back.   
---
Had offers of multiple TSE's for an anti-armor explosive shotgun I had, again declined.  
---
Generally speaking you don't trade multiple God rolls for a single unless the single is exceptionally rare.
---
I've generally kept a very deep inventory, little lighter now on "quality" items that I'm weight caped, I've given a fair amount away, [but with nearly 1,000 2* &amp; 3* ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1W4imr77PGwM_d5l8KzQJP6KnI5t8PfwZf0kI_nzT5Ao/htmlview#) Legendaries still in stock I think it's far to say I've done a little trading.  
---
    
---
Pressing F for all the people who are gonna get banned
---
I'm thinking this is what delayed player vending. Finding a way to remove the economy-breaking items before building the economy.
---
*Just fucking unleash armageddon on the servers.*
---
I'm just waiting for someone to tell him why he's wrong here, too. ;)
---
I'll be back when they announce the shutdown.  I was there when H1Z1 shut down :)
---
&gt;affects everyone
---
Everyone knows this is bullshit, not one person can even explain how duping "affects them." It affects the Discord and the Bazaar, sure, but it doesn't affect you, and it doesn't affect the game. Nothing in this game is engineered well enough to have been "ruined" by its players. Blaming players for *anything* points to a fundamental misunderstanding of the business-consumer relationship. The devs and the managers are the problem, and they're using dupers in a divide-and-conquer tactic to remove vocal critics and win over morons.
---
Any more?
---
How are we supposed to know though? If someone buys a dupe and then wants to sell it how is anyone supposed to know? Just because it’s got good stats? Then why trade up if you’re avoiding good stats on guns? 
---
Dupers coming in and claiming wrongful elimination in 5, 4, 3, 2...
---
who did they ruin the game for? its a PVE co op shooter ,if someone dupe it won't affect you or anyone at all ,there are no leaderboardsa auction houses or literally any metric that acn separate you from another player
---
inb4 muh economy 
---
My bet is tomorrows patch will be based on a previous build and things that were fixed will be broken again. Bobby pins I bet will be broken again.
---
Its what I truly want more than anything. I want to stand directly under the nukes. 
---
Next Patch: Fixed an issue where players were able to collect dirty water at a faster rate than intended.
---
Yeah maybe, still most is legit farmed
---
For a while, every time you moved camp it would make a duplicate, I wonder what the threshold will be.  All my precious razorgrain!
---
I want to see nukes being dropped on top of fucking nukes.
---
I mean....it's still pretty good, just not incredible.  You have three chances at a 3 star legendary drop, plus whatever your friends pick up.  Personally, I'm not upset about the \*\*\* lvl 35 mutants/+40%speed/-90%weight pick-axe that I got and use as a backup weapon.  It's super light, does good damage with a sharp mod and is only one tier off from top end.
---
One Violent Night is another good one for a guaranteed chance at a \*\*\* legendary.  If you're not doing that one, it's pretty quick and you also get a lot of random ghoul mobs that might drop plain \* legendaries.  I gave my friend a \* instigating deathclaw gauntlet with a super high durability (I must have eaten a scorchbeast liver earlier) last time we ran it.
---
Don't buy that, and never did.  
---
The people suddenly selling TSE's for 5k when they had been 15k or 20k the day before didn't make you suspicious?  
---
Guy with 30 different TSE weapons for trade asking for a few thousand per doesn't raise a red flag?
---
Awaits the inevitable false positives that result in OP losing their favourite gun. 
---
if they do a hard reset that would 100% be the final nail in the coffin for this game
---
YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKE NUKES!
---
Platform?
---
On console any duped item was legit at one point. They will just use this to take anything out they don't like and drive more players away if the population of the servers drops below a given number they can justify shutting them down and not have to do anything anymore.
---
And to help with all the money we all spent.
---
I was soooo ready to jump down your throat until I realized that you spelled that with a silent “/s”.
---
Yeah, my friends have been trying to get me into Apex Legends.
---
I've been resisting like hell playing Fallout 76 about 90% of the time.
---
I guess tomorrow I'll be playing Apex Legends 100% of the time :)
---
They used to be up to 50. That changed at some point.
---
If they are somehow able to trace the dupes back to the origin I would assume that they would destroy the source weapon also.
---
It wouldn't have required much memory space to create unique tags for every object that spawned into the world....as a matter if fact it would have been the intelligent thing to do so that they could collect data.
---
Of course they didn't do any of this, which I assume is the reason for all of the new job postings at Bethesda.
---
***So we put a nuke in yo nuke so you can nuke while u nuke***
---
That sucks to hear, hopefully that gets fixed soon.
---
&gt;I also question their mental health, but that's a different topic.
---
so people have mental health issues because they wanted to skip the grind with cash? get off your high horse lmao its a fucking video game
---
That's possible too, though if it's expensive for the devs/support to unpack them, it'd be just as expensive in-game for all the times that happens, over and over, on all those containers that are active at once. My suspicion is that there would be no need to search every player container anyway since they'd have narrowed down a list of what players have partaken of the forbidden loot-gathering. Whether that's from fancy datamining or just good old fashioned logging, I couldn't say. All of this is speculation, obviously, but that's venturing into outright guesswork. 
---
The stash limit makes sense if it's in a db, as well. The low limit may not, but I totally understand the existence of one. However many characters exist x (the items in the stash container + the items in the player container + the items in the CAMP pseudo-container) + the items in each vendor container on each server + however world items are calculated = a whole butt-ton of rows, and the variables there they can control are the stash, player, and CAMP containers, which they do through weight or... whatever CAMP budget is figured from.
---
Seriously, I farmed enough to find my main legendary. It’s by no means op but it works. I stayed away from pvp because it was nothing compared to the powerful duped weapons that became common. Now I feel ill finally be able to enjoy pvp 
---
Grafton monster is such a sad encounter as low as he is now, he should really be uncapped 
---
Or be like the bohemoth in boarderlands2 after you shoot his head off, have it go around and kill just everything all the time constantly leveling up and becoming more powerful and getting better loot! 
---
The law doesn't say so, neither should Bethesda.
---
I would love to see the look on the face of the judge that catches the case.
---
Suing over a loss of a fake digital currency in a game that can be easily farmed within that game.
---
That’s possible, but I feel like they won’t be that stupid, but hey we will see.
---
It would suck if my stuff got removed and I paid Caps for it lmao but oh well probably not gonna play anyways fallout 4 has been keeping me more entertained 
---
Just one example: 2 Weeks ago I found a Bloodied Explosive Combat Shotgun. Just two star, however I had one before. The one circulating is definetly duped &amp; I bought it cheap. The one I looted has slightly better condition with similar mods. I gifted the other one I used before to a friend.      
---
     
---
Somehow I bet that my unique one gets deleted too just because it has the same perks. If so or any of my Armor gets deleted (all 100% unique too) I definetly stay away from any further Bethesda Online Games.      
---
They definetly should make sure that the **all duplication methods are fixed** and then just **increase item level**. But this is just a shitshow... I bet they remove unique stuff too + still have not fixed all dupes.      
---
      
---
I reported 6 different duplication methods to Bethesda. Only 3 were fixed yet. If they remove unique items but do not fix all duplications exploits I'll probably just make all working ones public. Just so everyone can see that they removed your unique stuff while others go on duping because Bethesda didn't care to fix it before they deleted all you stuff.
---
Yes but the helmet was cheaply made. The Halloween rubber knock offs were better quality. Yes  sorry $80 investment (ya happy?) 
---
You're using the Resort sofa! I love that one. 
---
borderlands 2 is a really decent alternative if you want a COOP looter shooter ,been having tons of fun with it
---
Just one, but I have 3 TSE cannons that are shined and ready for sale. They'll be gone quick so better jump on it. 
---
i love the mire! but slocum joes is cool too :)
---
If you're going to flatly contradict my claim that it would take a ridiculous amount of memory to do that based on the number of players alone, please say why. :)
---
it’s my favorite !! 
---
I'm not being rude by saying this but look at all that's happened with decisions made to date.
---
Can't help but feel stupid is as stupid does.
---
Mathematically anti armor favors higher damage weapons more. I think on average it's somewhere around 120% damage. Two Shot is 125% damage but U believe you lose accuracy and some say weapons break
---
faster.
---
After the Nerf I would probably lean anti armor unless the base damage of your weapon is &lt;50.
---
Nerfing bastids! 
---
Hey China, I bought from you once. You were fast - bam, no muss no fuss and done, was really great. I'm a part time trader (aka clumsy with pricing and generally lazy) but I agree with your concerns. The issue is confidence, just like the RL economy. Confidence that consumers will keep taking out loans, buying houses, that the gov't sets interest rates in line with investor expectations and confidence the items you traded for will be here tomorrow, next month and so on.
---
I don't have a solution to the duping problem. I don't know how far this will go or how many people this will effect. But the announcement is undermining confidence which was already (in a general sense) shaky.
---
AA wins, hands down. 
---
I can only speak for myself but at this point I feel praising or investing in the game is enabling decision-making I never want to see again from Zenimax or BSW.  Totally understand there are some people who are enjoying their play at the moment, but...arguing in favor of the game right now makes you something of a scab from my perspective.  I wouldn’t care to actually make a post about it, but maybe there are other more vocal people who feel that way?
---
Sincerely hope you keep enjoying the game
---
* Scab as in a person who crosses a picket line at a strike 
---
If this is 100% replicable and reliable, by jove, you are literally jesus.
---
Right. Sorry your guns are being taken away because you were irresponsible. 
---
I killed one recently as well. Best thing I got from him was 25 caps and some 5.56 ammo lol.
---
Does this work on all systems (or, what I'm really interested in is PS4)?
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Where is that nuclear winter anyway?
---
I cant say if they are available currently, I havent played since the day before patch 5.  So all of what im about to say is potentially out of date knowledge.
---
BOS arms do exist, I got them from grafton, it took __a lot__ of server hopping to get them. (That was done before I started recording stuff on that spreadsheet) .
---
I couldnt tell you why the arms were so hard to find, I mustve been lucky bc I got BOS chest and legs in the same night from random plan spawn points (one in glass cavern, other in the trainyard in the bog), and ive seen them a couple other times at grafton. But only BOS arms once.
---
From what ive read, it sounds like all the plans are supposed to be at the vendors, but the list is too long for them to load it all or something like that.
---
There's only one BaseID for an item - period.  That's the 'base' item that is in the database.  RefID's are formed and attached for every copy of the BaseID that is added to the gameworld.
---
For example, there is one BaseID for a mailbox - that mailbox is not in the game.  But everytime you place a mailbox, a mailbox with that Base mailboxes attributes is created and assigned a unique RefID.
---
You can't put two items in the gameworld with two refID - or else they are the same item.  Including occupying the same space.  They will be identical in every way up to and including x/y/z coords and angles.
---
And no, a RefID can have a unique identifier that has nothing to do with its BaseID.  Well, beyond the two digit prefix of the load order of the plugin that the BaseID is called from.  And that can change if you change the load order of your plugins.
---
I mean I can’t defend all there decisions, especially with atom shop and current “dlc” additions announced. But I’d like to hope they are  at least trying. 
---
I’m going to try it tomorrow too. 
---
I bought a TSE Handmade on eBay and got banned.
---
My level 5 mule (SirDupesalot) moves very slow. But I'm sure I can get there in a few hours. 
---
When I've been wandering for a while, carrying lots of items, am looking for respite, I want to sleep for the Well Rested bonus, I want to play some music to be Well Tuned, a player's camp is such a welcome sight. Until I get to the door and see they've locked all that behind it. I build my camp so there's a public area and a private area.
---
Here's the way it should have gone:
---
1. Fix the dupe exploits.
---
2. The duped items will filter out of the game as people stop using those characters or stop playing the game alltogether.
---
How do I know this works?  It's ALREADY happening.  I wanted to trade for another good super sledge and power fist.  Normally end-game versions could be traded for 10,000 caps.  I've been posting for almost a week now and not ONE offer for either of those items.  People are leaving the game already.
---
Full wipe and they lose ALL of the player base.  Nobody wants to re-grind 100+ levels worth of gathered gear on multiple characters.
---
People don't quit because they have "good gear".  They quit because they're BORED with the game.  Instead of adding content, they're removing the ability to trade.
---
That's assuming the server logs that.  And there's no guarantee it does.
---
The engine itself never tracked that before - it never needed to.
---
&gt;if you've nothing to hide, you've nothing to fear
---
Doesn't it trouble you that you have the brain of a racist cop?
---
Would have gotten away with it except for you meddling kids!
---
I have a Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet that does about 700 dmg on my build. I can still oneshot a lvl 91 deathclaw. I am a little over level 200 and have over 400 hours into the game, why shouldn't i oneshot a lvl 91 ?Also, this is actually fun to me
---
It has its positives and negative.
---
Positive: Less players running around in perfect sentinels/assassin gear so pvp is going to be a bit more fun.
---
Negative: Overall game population is going to take a hit and the servers are going to be even more empty than they already are, so less people for me to kill. 
---
While the servers are down ill take my all rise back @bethesda but i think it is a good idea and I cant wait to see the fallout( no pun intended) of some bug that occurs during this process 
---
Ok bye
---
The 3 youtube videos juice head will make on people saying their inventory was deleted unfairly will be great
---
I'm probably going to lose a TSE Handmade tomorrow. It's the only thing I've ever bought out of the market. The guy didn't seem like a duper and I think he was just getting rid of it because the infamous nerf was looming.. But still, I don't know its origins. I'm actually alright with losing it knowing the game is going to be correctly balanced, and rare items will actually be rare. Also the 20 extra carry weight will be nice! It's going to be an absolute salt mine in here tomorrow though lol.
---
Then go do something else and quit crying about it, you inarticulate whineypuss. 
---
Oh and BTW it's \*it's\*.
---
So what you want is for ALL traders who happen to get a duped item to be banned?
---
They need to remove the "trading interface" from the game first.
---
Good idea!  What a quick way to get MASSIVE amounts of people banned from the game.
---
I got a two shot (not explosive) lever action rifle as a drop at White Springs when I was in my 40's, so they are definitely out there. Gave it to a friend since I'm a melee build. 
---
The gun was good, but not a one shot anything and the nerf killed it. :(
---
No need to track every item. There are easier methods for running duper patrol for aid/plans/junk/ammo, just look for obscene amounts. Got 5k shotshells?  That’s a lot, but could be crafted with enough grinding.  Got 50k?  That’s pretty suspicious. 
---
As for tracking, just track the legendaries. A ton of them end up de-spawned anyway as dropped items that are never picked back up. Since guns are heavy, players generally don’t have a ton of them. Further, they could easily run these searches in the hours preceding the patch, and while patching look to see if anything changed and fix it accordingly. 
---
Ahh the drill. Works wonders in the "Bob the Builder" build
---
It’s probably going to get rid of all server crash/ MODUS dupes, as that’s way easier to track than the boards were or the artillery.
---
I legit grinded my ass off (lol sounds wrong) getting Mr Fuzzy tokens legit to buy the full costume, if I lose it tomorrow I doubt I'll be returning to fo76 anytime soon 
---
It doesn't use much memory to store a 10 digit number. This could have been accomplished with just a few lines if code.
---
In hindsight a few extra bucks for memory storage would have saved the game.
---
What you don't understand is that almost everybody can recognize a typo. Understanding the difference between your and you're doesn't make you smart, it means you're a native speaker that attended elementary school.
---
If correcting minor grammar mistakes is what makes you feel 'intelligent', you have some serious insecurity/inferiority issues that need to be addressed.
---
Exactly, pve was ruined, I’ve done events and had assholes come in and kill the end boss before I took a shot and pvp is ruined too. 
---
Also don’t care about economy I didn’t give them any caps 
---
Many orders and my mule is moving very slow, but I'll get there...
---
Grazi.
---
When we heard there were duping we all asuned that this could one day happen. Think less about what it does to you as an individual and se the big picture.
---
Probably Eastern Standard Time USA.
---
Like other patches, the game will be offline for a time after that.
---
I don't even want to log in to see the damage.
---
Going to be even more pissed then.
---
I saved ten percent or more on car insurance... and got banned. Bethesda is so unfair.
---
I can see why you don't like the state of the game right now and I hope your opinion will change as they fix more things. 
---
Nah, whatever happens you'll get some Outrage Journalism posts that end with question marks baiting for clicks. I dont need other people's reactions to things; I just wanna see what items I get to keep
---
If it’s not bad I’ll message you. If it is I’ll message you RIP, and uninstall the game 
---
I’ve always joined servers that had a friend on them, even if I never team up with them or even see them while there, just for this very purpose. 
---
So going forward, make sure you don't ever trade for a "duped" item.
---
You know what 100% of them look like right?
---
It's possible to be a trader and completely dupe free.
---
/sarcasm
---
&gt; Sunshine and farts?
---
So...energy weapons?
---
It’s pretty safe to assume that all those weapons people traded caps for where dupes and it’s going to be hell on earth.
---
Everyone’s going to claim ignorance but you can’t expect to trade a couple thousand caps for a weapon that takes hundreds of not thousands of hours to drop. The reason the prices where so slow was because they’re duped and after this we will see prices for decent weapons go through the roof. 
---
It may not be fair to those who traded but everyone wasn’t intended to have top tier super rare gear.
---
This is the sub for it. They'll jump on it and eat it up.
---
So they make TSE weapons almost useless and now theyre deleting them?  
---
I bought a TSE handmade and specc'd into it heavily, became useless after the nerf.
---
I bought a TSE shotgun and specc'd into it heavily after the nerf because it was still a functional weapon.
---
Now they its very likey ill lose both weapons and the 20ish perk points I used to make those weapons good? 
---
Its the shit*
---
Are we really convinced they'll only remove duped stuff? I'm about 45% certain I'll log in tomorrow and all my aide items will be gone. Or all the union costumes I've made and am waiting for vendors to have caps again so I can sell them.
---
I basically don't have much confidence this won't be a clusterfuck of unintended consequences.
---
Just find the players with full sets of Assassin's/Unyielding Sentinel/Cavalier armor and work backwards.
---
TS accuracy sucks IMO. It was bearable when it did double damage.  Now?  Not so much. TS without any other effect is almost garbage because of the accuracy hit. 
---
Looking forward to articles on polygon or pc gamer based on Reddit posts showing up in my Google news feed
---
We specialize in private transactions, caps are caps but Visa is always more reliable
---
Test\
---
Hello
---
&gt;  Also, power armor is now edible. Honestly no idea how that happened.
---
25k caps says Momma Dulce's was involved.
---
Happy Cake Day BleedOutCold! Stop searching the world for treasure, the real treasure is in yourself.
---
:) lol
---
It's like in this game everything was designed to make the users to waste time with no need.
---
This is beautiful. I have been thinking that it is a simulation for quite a while now. The proof is litterally in front of our faces constantly, as we are playing the game. Everywhere. I just shared this on Twitter. I really hope this is honestly a legit theory and that it is real. Also THANK YOU SO MUCH for documenting the proof regarding to this amazing theory. It means so much. Also I NEVER KNEW there were more peoole out there that thought avout this theory as well until I joined Reddit and started following Fallout pages on here.
---
I play just like this, multiple workshops! Man if this works reliably you're saving me so much hassle/frustration! Gonna try it asap tomorrow.
---
Psh, kids today
---
The current story is that West Coast BoS were able to contact Army remnants in WV via an old satellite and got things started there to combat the Scorched problem. Eventually the satellite failed and left the BoS in Appalachia on their own against the “extinction level event”. 
---
**Makes some popcorn and pulls up a chair overlooking Top of the World**
---
MUNCH MUNCH. 
---
( and I’m pretty sure a weapon I’ve bought is duped ) 
---
The worst offenders were those duplicating thousands of rare items and selling them. At least, that's who I view as the worst. Unless they implemented individual item tracking server side (I doubt that) my guess is they made a script that cross checks the quantity of items in each account against the rarity and flags items that exist in an account exceeding any probability that they were legitimately generated. Then it deletes them. My guess is that would hit any account that's got more caps than a person could have legitimately accumulated (millions, not hundreds of thousands). You're never going to really fix a fantasy economy. It's susceptible to the same problems of a real economy.
---
Same, wipe it all set everyone back to a level playing field. If people can't handle that, then you shouldn't playing online games. As quite a few after a massive abuse of an exploit like this have done full on server wipes, and stat resets.
---
Hopefully the ban the dupers along with the cleaning.
---
The only think that can screw you is that if the game fully exits you won’t have anyone listed in recent.  Or if you accidentally click play instead of join someone else’s game.    So make sure to always join game from their profile and it works.   
---
Marketing team says you're hired!
---
I added you
---
Thanks you gave me a reason to read terminal entries. I will go tomorrow.
---
Yes, today I was a trader and still playing Fallout 76.  I enjoyed trading.  It masked the lack of content they've added.
---
After tomorrow, I won't be a trader.  I'll be playing something else.
---
I've played survival games for 10 years, never seen a company go in and MASS DELETE items out of the database.  Ban dupers, yes, every game.  MASS DELETE, nope, not once.
---
You troll. 
---
Can confirm some vendor's trading screens do not update immediately to reflect their actual inventory of caps.  However for me after waiting a minute it automatically updates.  I was also informed that vendor caps are based on faction, so selling to a vendor until they have 0 caps effects all vendors of that faction (so Whitesprings Station and Resort share the same cap pool, raider vendors share their cap pool, responder vendors share their cap pool), so that really helped me determine what the problem actually was, a combination of impatience and ignorance on my part.
---
I run with a Gauss Rifle (and I call it my kamehameha gun) and can confirm it is effected.  Will try out Plasma guns, I tested a laser gun (rifle) and noted it's beam shots weren't clipping enemies, but it's accuracy is atrocious anyways so I still missed a lot of shots while testing, and honestly it might have been clipping the edges of their hit boxes as sone shots did seem to phase into the side of enemies but not hit them, I just assumed it was bad accuracy.
---
Once I have more plasma cartridges I'm gonna test out a plasma flamer and plasma pistol.  I really liked plasma guns in Fo4 and was disappointed that they break like plastic toys firing real rounds.
---
I think the gauss rifle and laser weapons do suffer from clipping and inaccurate VATS displays.  No joke my gauss rifle fires as if from the hip when using vats mid to short range like it'll shoot far off from my target, at very close range I've seen the beam go right through ghouls and robots.
---
I think there is an issue with beam projectiles registering hits (especially in 3rd person, dead accurate gauss shots don't seem to register a hit more often in 3rd person) and with the ways some guns were coded to utilize vats.  My bullet weapons all work pristine in vats, my energy weapons do not.
---
I'll eventually test gatling lasers and gatling plasmas.
---
I honestly wish they gave us a test world akin to the developer room for testing purposes.
---
well according to the "bible" timeline the BoS didn't form until 50 years or so post Fallout 76 events.
---
Im gonna be more upset about my outfits than anything i like them
---
Saying they "can't" can mean anything from ability to policy.
---
Also (I'm not following the game so idk) if they're doing a mass purge, that's vastly different from adding items. It could be as simple as that duped items have the same reference id and the same item, not gained by the dupe glitch, doesn't have the same reference id, then they're running a simple registry deletion according to multiple reference ID's being detected.
---
That I can't say for sure. 
---
If it were me, I'd do that to encourage players to get rid of the bulk of the duped inventory themselves.  It's less heavy-handed, gets the players directly involved in the resolution of a problem they created, and (most importantly to my lazy ass), it eliminates a lot of data that I'd otherwise have to clean up myself. Think of it as crowdsourcing a data purge. Give the playerbase some time to do what they're going to do on their own, and after that what's left is either the die-hard exploiters who weren't sufficiently inconvenienced, or inactive players. Being able to filter by owners that're over the new weight limit would further shrink my result set and lessen the chances of unintentionally wiping out, say, tens of thousands of rounds of ammo that another player crafted legitimately. If I'm Bethesda, I know I cannot afford a cockup like that. But that's just how I'd have approached it if it were up to me.
---
&gt; I hope not, two shot and explosive were way too powerful
---
says who?
---
they were the only counter to scorchbeasts and only way to pug scorchbeast queen,no gear or level check for scorchbest queen but nerf TSEs lol
---
TSE was fine pre nerf was only counter to scorchbeasts and scorchbeast queens and some annoying enemies like assaultrons or mr gutsies
---
Point is, there's NO animation for collecting dirty water from water sources like rivers and lakes. It's faster and more efficient.
---
*looks around frantically for spare vault*
---
I recently bought a nice three diamond Grognax axe from a player vendor. It's been fun, but it was only 750 caps soooo it wouldn't be the end of the world if it went away. I'd just go back to my Vampiric Drum weapon, which was a drop at WS.
---
I think it's far more likely, however, that I'll log in and my entire wardrobe will be gone. Or all my stimpaks or some other random bug. 
---
I literally never tried to buy an item that was heavily duped, and every amazing item I did trade for I would ask if it was duped and get verification if I could. In other words, I went out of my way to avoid duped items like the plague. There were two times I did end up with one on accident, and both times I knew right away because it would crash my game 70% of the time when I accessed my stash. Both times, I dropped those items and dashboarded to get rid of them. The point is, lots of people who bought duped items legitimately, knew they were duped *or* didn't care enough to try and find out. I'd say if you are a casual enough player to not care enough to investigate or avoid potentially duped items, then you're casual enough to not mind if you lose those items. 
---
Are you being intentionally obtuse to troll or something? An automatic ban for possession of a duped item, after existing dupes have been removed, mean that someone will be banned the instant they dupe. They won't ever have the opportunity to trade a duped item to someone else. 
---
I enjoy your writing style! My first encounter with the Mothman was actually the most memorable thing in the whole game, the mystery surrounding it, the strange cult, my favorite outfit I got from one of those houses. 
---
St. Valentine's day massacre part 2.
---
I’m saying before the news 
---
I never traded for TSEs but some were devalued because the dupes flooded the market. Once there were alternatives like the AAE people started buying those but who knows how much of that is duped too. Also not everybody has had the privilege to have bought this game on release too so some people might’ve just thought it was the norm. 
---
And like I said, what if some normal guy bought a dupe from a duper, and then sold it to you for whatever price and their inventory was totally normal? I take precautions but then again I don’t buy TSE’s. 
---
You expect your experience to be everyone else’s experience and they might get screwed over tomorrow. I get where you’re coming from but really it’s going to suck for the people that had no clue if the mass deletions will work like everyone is expecting them to. 
---
No, sorry. I was lucky and had them carrying around prepatch from last update. I only had two. Hang in there. Could be big changes tomorrow. 
---
Wouldn't be surprised 
---
I can only test it on Xbox.  But I assume it would be the same 
---
&gt;Exactly, pve was ruined, I’ve done events and had assholes come in and kill the end boss before I took a shot
---
no one one shotted SBQ under normal conditions,onyl way to one shot  SBQ was with explosive boblehead stacking 
---
&gt;pvp is ruined too
---
I agree. and Happy Cake Day!
---
If the Morgantown vendor bot is gone tomorrow I will finally know for certain that he sold me a duped TSE minigun.
---
Yes. I have all the required materials, and STILL can't fix/craft.
---
Yeah, the dollar only has value if you have faith that it's worth something.  Make people doubt the dollar and it becomes worthless.
---
**As of tomorrow, trading dies.**
---
**Why give up my "good" item for your "possibly duped" item that's going to get MASS DELETED later.**
---
Nope, no thanks.  They might as well remove the trading interface.  You're literally gambling that the item you're getting is or is not duped.
---
I remember trading with you.  You did fine :)
---
I have the same feeling. 
---
Your internet points were promptly taken, good friend.
---
Everybody turn around, we fucked up. 
---
Lol, I've bought a few good 3 stars from vendors before as well.
---
It's pretty good.  I suck at it, but I'm sure with all the practice I'll be getting soon I'll get better :)
---
Isn't it possible for people to tame robots, do they count as their property then maybe?
---
You're confused. It's not a matter of opinion. **Fallout 76 has serious, critical, systemic issues that are measurable on an objective basis when compared to other games that need to be addressed for the game to stay healthy and maintain a solid foundation to build on.**
---
Disagreeing with this assertion is *delusional*. Do you understand that word? People who are delusional *cannot see things for what they are*, they see something else, something they might prefer to see than what reality is actually made of. There is no case you can make on the basis of liberal opinionism that will keep this game alive. Fallout 76 needs an *actionable plan*, and people like you who ignore that and insist that you're perfectly happy are **NOT** contributing to the game's health, you're just sitting there watching a ship sink and *instead of bailing water you're screaming that there are no holes in the ship*.
---
I don't know what kind of person you are, but you're very naive to cater to your own insecurities. Your entire thread is *pathetically* grasping for others who already agree with you. This is seeking confirmation bias, which, as a redditor is a concept I'd expect you to have basic literacy in. If you were right, you wouldn't need their approval to keep loving the game. The fact you even feel the need to critique the critics themselves is the immature defensiveness I'd expect of **hugboxing idiots**.
---
I don't want you to be offended or upset, I want you to grow as a person. The first step to the game's recovery is admitting the game is fucked. And for the record, time enjoyed is never time wasted.
---
I'm sure this suffers from the shitty RNG loot pool bug where the shitty RNG loot pool never accidentally gives you a god roll but you get plenty of flare guns.
---
Disapering toilet is not fun tho.
---
No, it was created by those fuckin dragon things
---
will you keep playing if that’s the case?
---
Don’t but any of this! He’s clearly trying to u load duped items that will be gone tomorrow!!! How are the mods letting this happen
---
Let us determine which youtuber will have the corniest click baiting doomsday title being it will be on Valentine's day 
---
Ok, I've tested your claim and I can say without a doubt at no stage has this game sucked ma balls.
---
I smeared my junk all over my monitor, case &amp; keyboard and received no "Sucking" effects.
---
I did get a slight spark from my monitor &amp; the case fan cut a slice in my taint but nil sucking.
---
Please supply proof or it didnt happen.
---
Things could have also changed from that first time they said they couldnt detect duped item till now. Don't assume they are just lying. 
---
Put a mustache on it and name it "Mr. Gun Incognito."
---
It was just wandering around outside of Watoga, no where near a camp, and more importantly I shot it in self defense. 
---
Also, I don’t think robots can be claimed like that.  If they can, then I need to find a Gutsy to guard my camp. 
---
Yeah, the full uproar hasn't hit yet.
---
90% of any player base doesn't visit the reddit unless they have a problem.  I ran tests on other survival games (Steam Charts and Player Data VS Reddit Participation).
---
LOTS of people are going to log in tomorrow and go "wtf, where did all my good items go"?
---
It's going to hit WORSE than the TSE triple nuke nerf.
---
I'm impressed you put up with everything else so far but this was the reason you decided to quit.
---
That's not a bug that's intentional. If you found one of the rarest items in the game at a vendor... well that's like finding a nice looking used Lamborghini on Craiglist for $5000 and expecting it not to be stolen.
---
Oh god no, i hate when prize bot gives me 100lbs of money. GTFO!
---
They should and won't. And I don't remember who, but someone on this sub mentioned inventory versioning as an expense Bethesda's not willing to pay.
---
I don’t support streamers/tubers, but I am excited about the item wipe!
---
We still dont know if they’re targeting single items or stacked items. So im curious, I spent a good amount for my favorite super sledge and that might go tomorrow. Traded myself TSE Lever Rifle and TSE minigun that also might go tomorrow. But who knows? I agree with you in a way I spent time like you on the market getting my caps and using them. It will probably set me back a 30,000 caps ish, because I bought good stuff from people who had karma seemed legit and didnt have many items in their inventory. 
---
But in the long run I still think its a good thing because the dupers have been influencing and ruining the trade experience on the market the last three months and I miss how it was at the start. And hoping this will make the market better again. 
---
Thanks for sharing your wisdom Ally Mcbeal. I’ll be sure to ponder over it tomorrow at NASA.
---
Beth: "You have our respect, players. When we're done, half of Appalachia will still exist. We hope they remember you."
---
I grinded for the Mr fuzzy tokens by creating a new character doing the event handing the tokens to a friend and deleting the character. I repeated that for a few hours to get enough tokens to buy the full outfit. I'll probably lose that tomorrow 
---
SirDupesalot? Sounds a little fishy to me...
---
I feel this. The cosmetics didn’t hurt anyone, but hey all or nothing I guess.
---
Picked up one this morning. What serendipity. If my TSE shotgun is gone, at least I’ll have it (I hope). 
---
A scorchbeast spawn bug like the WS robot bug would be... indescribable.
---
Did I say SBQ? Fucking moron, there is more than just that event. And yes pvp was ruined, I’d be dead before I can get any shots off to damage them. 
---
I got the camo jump suit traveling leather coat and tattered jacket  and vtu which are my bois and i dont wanna lose the clothes
---
They should just turn the duped weapons into paddle balls if you ask me 
---
Thank you again for the help friend. See you in the Appalachia 😀
---
what economy? i always ask and get no answer
---
what economy was there? 
---
The point is, they also promised to erase duped items people purchased from other people. So if you own one TSE shotgun bought from duper, it's supposed to be removed. I have no idea how they will track it without unique ID.
---
Gettin a fair fight can be hard an d even gettin to fight can be hard to do as well. I'm one of those 5% players that have killed 20 ppl ,it wasnt an easy process. But hell ya, Fallout new vegas was my favorite as far as in depth story and immersion goes and yes that's what fallout is known for big time. Where 2 or 3 characters are needed to see al the story lore n quests that the game has to offer. I think we will see that again hopefully but I doubt it will be with fo76 ri be honest. The quests are far too linear in this game. It feels like player to player interaction(not just pvp) is a must or the game gets pretty stale pretty fast.
---
If two items could have the same RefID (they can't) then they'd have been able to delete them a week ago.
---
Not sure. If I re-grind my stash and then it suddenly updates to restore everything and I’m over 600 and get banned, I guess I’ll rage quit lol. 
---
YouTube also has pro-Nazi propaganda on it that Google refuses to enforce. Untalented manchildren with entry-level video editing skills aren't really a threat to a game that at launch couldn't even keep a server up for 24 hours.
---
Stay positive about solutions, not about the current state of things. Liking the game solely on the basis that it's not *worse* is a really sad way to play.
---
I am 450hours ingame, i have been caps caped many times. Ofcourse i did bought some items. Like TSE minigun that i used once and paid 10k for it. Who cares, now i will be atleast able to sell my mules stash of explosive weapons that droped to me overtime.
---
There was no economy,playerbase is unaffected since theres no auction house or any way to affect anyone its a pve coop shooter ffs
---
I doubt they have the ability or will to remove every single item or weapon that has been duplicated. A stack of 1K+ magazines is going to stick out like a sore thumb though and I think it is reasonable to assume that type of stuff is what will be removed. 
---
Okay so turn off PvP until they learn how to make a PvP game. Problem solved easily and without resorting to blaming players.
---
"To avoid internal build version discrepancies we've rolled the game back to the beta version of Fallout 4."
---
After reading all your responses to comments, I can safely say it's not just the game than needs new content....
---
Nice job, good contribution.
---
&gt;They’re going after people who’ve bought these items as well as those who duped directly. 
---
Got a source on that one?  I haven’t seen this written out explicitly anywhere. Their anti-duper post in the past makes it seem like this won’t be the case. 
---
A mass deletion is very very very different from single item add ins. 
---
As I said though, I don't follow the game rn so is this like, a problem? Why would this even be needed?
---
My favorite outfit makes me look like a hobo with a shotgun.
---
is there a betting pool?
---
It's not skipping the grind, with that tse shotgun, you the entire game into baby mode. Nothing survives half that shot. 
---
I figured it out. Now I have the power to crash servers on demand. 
---
Ah, but see thet said the support people don't have the tools not that it isn't possible. It is certainly possible that support will still not have access to those tools after tomorrow.
---
I'm wondering who's in charge of this whole mess.
---
Normally survival multiplayer teams have a "lead dev" who is the figurehead for a project.  If there are problems they make someone else the "lead dev" or just fire them completely.
---
It's not the team making these decisions.  There's one person at the top who makes the final call.
---
They need to go.
---
I've never knowingly taken possession of any duped material, but I'm on edge about what will happen tomorrow if either (a) I had some stuff in my stash that I unwittingly received from a duper, or (2) Beth screws up and trashes stuff they didn't mean to.
---
["Let me guess. Your home?"](https://i.imgur.com/I7ZMftR.png)
---
"It was... and it was beautiful."
---
Actually, Minesweeper is better game than this.
---
It will suck more for those that bought duped items on eBay for real $$
---
A mass deletion is just a script editing multiple entries.  You could just as well run a script for a mass insertion of items.
---
If the script could edit an entry to remove an item, a person can edit that entry.  And they can add an item.
---
People have been losing items to game glitches for a while.  They've claimed they can't edit user's inventories.  But apparently they can now.
---
I figured it out. Ok so apparently wearing the garb of mysteries while in the excavation suit crashed the server.
---
No. I'm saying that the price is connected to the man hours required to make one skin, and would be more atoms for the skin to work on all armors
---
It just works! ... I hope. :3
---
Somebody please dupe copious amounts of salt and see if it gets deleted
---
Yet here you are bitching like a bitch on the rag.
---
Minesweeper is amazing 
---
no, everyone is going back to Whitesprings.
---
the few people left that is.
---
no go away
---
We'll need it for the popcorn
---
How do you think "look to see if anything changed" isn't the same as running the searches to begin with? If they can search a live, dynamic database while the game is up, why can't they edit it? If they can, why take the game down for hours? You don't understand the magnitude of the database problem.
---
Legit explanation. I was party to a single nuking of the prime fissure tonight and we brought down the queen and two other SBs, and a host of other creatures in about 5 minutes. The loot "loading" arrows and lagged notifications (oh wait my gatling plasma broke... *again*) took another 20 minutes to catch up.
---
Thanks!
---
Just dying is extra expensive. I have zero plan to ever step foot into one of those servers
---
And get ready for YouTubers and gaming websites using Reddit posts for their clickbait article/videos.
---
We need something along the lines of what diablo did - and you get legendary zones with tough enemies who just drop loot. (Nephlim rifts)
---
This will be a big surprise for many ebay buyers.
---
I GOT THE 1000th UPVOTE! Okay but seriously that is really cool. Thanks for the tip
---
It’s called Watoga shopping plaza on the map. Straight north of Watoga station
---
We're not talking about "ten digit numbers." Talk in terms of data.
---
Oh hey whats up bro!  That was a good visit.  Not everyone is a griefer afterall.  In fact I've only been griefed once, probably because it's hard to reach, defensive canyon walls and an unclimbable cliff behind it.  It's home to me
---
L4D3?
---
hah, Sentinals is THE most sought after armor.   You are talking about god rolls when you have THE god roll.  You did not understand the market.
---
Yes
---
I had this today when I was on a now level char and needed a lift to camden park. I went to auto and area but they were probably in team chat. Tried the help emote but got question marks. :) 
---
Yeah usually I have at least a curiosity to try a new game mode at least once but I have zero interest into stepping into a mode full of the biggest griefers in the game. 
---
Good.
---
Editing it while it’s up could mean editing a save while a player is on, causing other issues. The changes they’d be looking for are not server wide, only the saves that were flagged in the initial search. This would require far less time. 
---
But then the SBQ doesnt scale really high... sometimes i like the fight lasting 20 minutes. did yall know 2-3 3star legendary's spawn during the fight?  
---
Agreed I’m seen people as low as level ten show up tag the queen and run away from everything 
---
All good advice from others. To add: golf balls at Whitespring and bowling balls/pins at the Freak Show. Plus make sure you have maxed out Ammosmith and Super Duper to get the most out of your shell crafting.
---
Also be sure to check every cigarette machine, packs of cigarettes are an underrated source of plastic and EVERYWHERE.
---
i havent got that far my character is like 28? And i just couldnt keep going my video game ADD kicked in. Dont get me wrong I LOVE 76 but I just can't play it for more than 2 hours before I'm bored and switch to something else. There's so much micro management of my stash and inventory I get overwhelmed and end up just either going to another game or watching YouTube.
---
near  [Abbie's bunker](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Abbie%27s_bunker) on the road.
---
Ha, tbh they got so much bad press from the version control problem I think that’s the least likely outcome...
---
next nerf : whitespring 
---
Nice way to talk about women
---
Their attempt at getting rid of every duped weapon in one swoop. 
---
They don’t have any methods to track duping so there’s no telling how this would actually work.
---
I popped some popcorn and said goodbye to every weapon I've bought from another person just incase
---
Explain how I blueprint this, you condescending ass.  Passionate camp builders don't make their camps so boring they can simply be blueprinted.

---
Yeah, maxing that will have a huge effect. I also picked up a 3-star combat shotgun that has 50% more limb damage as one of the effects. If you can find one, I highly recommend. Quad or armor piercing are a couple other good effects to look for. I bought mine from the Harper's Ferry vendor after someone sold it.
---
I just ran through the tunnel tonight to see what it would be like. You've probably already done it by now. Mid-60's scorched. Just take them one at a time as you move through. The only issue I had is half-way through, something triggered them all to respawn and I was suddenly surrounded. Crippled them all pretty quick and about half of them only had melee weapons. So I just concentrated on the ones that used shotguns and assault rifles. Someone had already taken the power armor in the tunnel and had stripped the frame bare on the bog side at the exit so I was bummed about that. Keep an eye out for plans outside each entrance at either end. I think there are at least 2 spawn points at both. YMMV.
---
We need to wait and see, because in the end we see, that Bethesda deleted 5 wood, 10 plastic, 20 screws, 50 steel from 50 players.
---
I dont want the market to be rifles by dupers. Here trade me your best drop for something I got ten of hihi. Fuck them. Lets remove the cancer. 
---
I earned a reddit gold though, 5th one this week :)
---
Where are you going with this?
---
Are you making a technical argument? Or are you butt sore because socialism didn't work in the wasteland and you're going to lose the stuff that you didn't earn?
---
5,000 caps! Everything you have. I don't care what's left when you get to me. Just hand it over. 
---
I’m pretty sure a ScumbagBot already exists.
---
You're right, the game needs new management!  :)
---
There’s a reason Minesweeper is automatically installed in new computers.
---
I’ll be a bit upset. Last week I was finally being blessed by the rng gods and got a few two shot weapons. No explosives though. Just the two shot effect. Got a nice two shot double barrel with +50% limb dmg one day, which made me so happy 
---
100% would not be surprised 
---
You are a thick-headed nonce.  I'm beginning to think this is an elaborate troll attempt because you're being willfully ignorant and downright churlish
---
Inside vault 76 is overseers terminal with note that say something like 6 vault dweller were under disciplinary lockdown. So they were basicaly jailed. I would kill everyone who put me in jail. 
---
No offers, maybe because everyone that wants it already has one? Maybe it’s oversaturated in the market because it’s been duped so much?
---
The end game is to gear up your character for a lot of people. Get a shortcut to that, and then it seems like there’s nothing to do. 
---
I can guarantee they wouldn’t lose “ALL” of their playerbase because myself and a lot of other posters here would welcome a full wipe. People got a huge advantage because of duping and other exploits. It’s still a new game, wipes happen in online games when there are huge problems (and this is a pretty big damn problem).
---
Or lots of challenges. 
---
I have lost my veil can you get it back??
---
great. but who care? dupers already stoped to play.. the trading discord empty as fuck.
---
Nope, that’s a feature. 
---
Welcome to the loot system.
---
&gt; Fucking moron
---
alright chief
---
#5 is new to me, but I don’t use traps as they’re not very effective. 
---
#6 is a known issue. Did you open the transfer menu?  If not, I’ll bet that was the issue. Often times the extractor won’t show anything but if you open the transfer menu it will update to what’s supposed to be in there. It’s an old old issue. 
---
I mean, maybe somebody will say we should sue; and be immediately laughed at. 
---
All I really have to say about that. 
---
All I’m saying is that the rng is so godawful in this game that many, many players spent a large portion of their caps on a decent weapons. And if they get on tomorrow and find their only decent weapons randomly deleted after dead-end content and constant bugs for months, they may very well quit. It would be worse than if Bethesda had actually told us to avoid trading and that this might happen; because due to the shitty stash space there’s a heavy impetus to avoid holding onto decent, unused weapons. People with hundreds of hours in the game could have nothing even moderately good because they didn’t have the space to hold onto their secondary weaponry. Then they quit as having no good weapons is final straw to the shit rewards and buggy gameplay. 
---
So, your apathy is basically fuck them for trying to buy better weapons through the only means possible and randomly expect them to know that those items were going to be deleted on whim, wiping out dozens to hundred of hours of playtime. 
---
Yeah, you *could* not have any sympathy when this happens. I also assume you don’t have any sympathy when the game fails, either. Fuck it all, I guess. 🙄
---
Agreed. I think a lot of the duped TSE's are going to remain. I have a feeling only accounts sitting on more than one will be hit. I think they're running a script that looks for certain items in quantities that exceed probability of them being generated legitimately.
---
Last Week Duppers bad evil juju This week: Oh noes my lootz Next week: something new?
---
&gt;Ruining the game for other around you
---
you must hate any game with character progression then because as you get stronger you will start one shotting weaker mobs
---
With one shot tse, yes. With literally any other weapons no. 
---
Build combat piece mod it then scrap it mod item are more likely to unlock more mods
---
Fair points, the conversation started further up specifically talking about "merchants" / active traders.  
---
For the average joe you are 100% right, and it can and will be painful for them, and I'm hoping there will be "sometime" from Bethesda regarding that, but who knows..  
---
But the large scale / highly active traders on Reddit and other platforms like Discord, it's hard to claim ignorance when we clearly watched the bottom fall out of the TSE market etc..
---
&gt;Cant you just move your camp
---
I was never able to move my camp when it was very small and simple. Then I finally said "fuck it" and ended up building a site specific house, with a large footprint, garden, outbuilding with generator, purifiers and tons of interior decor. There is no chance it will ever be able to be transported, as is, to another spot. I would be looking at literal hours to scrap everything and rebuild elsewhere. 
---
Aren't mass farmed crops clones? So wouldn't that qualify the corn for the popcorn as being duped?
---
We can't even get good trolls anymore
---
Awesome, thanks for the tip! 
---
Dont go using your white knight perk card. 
---
I didn't know you could get the BoS mod from scrapping. 
---
I got one! Sneaking is "fixed", except only the enemies are sneaking, all the time, and do 2.5x dmg to the player.
---
Works for weapons too
---
Finally! They should have done this with every update since the game launched.
---
11x 10min
---
The game sucks-For some people
---
I'm not one of them
---
Already nerfed the xp and the loot is more quantity than quality. I freaking hate it.
---
Done it too many times &lt;—
---
What bad guys spawned in? I'm gonna see if I can get it to happen again.
---
“Damage Bug Returns”... not one of Frank Miller’s better efforts
---
This whole thing will have been worth it simply because I learned a new word today.
---
**The problem is this sets a "mass deletion precedent" that will forever kill trading.**
---
So say your super sledge goes and you're in the market for another good 2 handed melee.
---
I have a War Drum (lvl 50) / Instigating / Swing Speed 40% / 90% Reduced Weight
---
Legit drop.  My friend got it at Whitesprings in the first 30 days.  Gave it to me because he's not melee.  I thought it looked "interesting" and kept it for future use but I wasn't melee either.  Now I know that's "end game meta" and really love it on my melee character. 
---
**When I offer my War Drum to you for a trade, do you take it?  I'll be asking for one of your BEST items in trade.  How do you know my War Drum isn't a dupe?  How do you know if I have 40 more of these sitting on my alts?  Can you see in my stash?  What about my alts?  Can you "prove" I'm legit?  lol**
---
**Confidence destroyed.  No reason to trade my "good" item for your possibly "duped and to be deleted later" item.**
---
Never traded for a single piece of the gear that I have. Lived through having my earliest weapons/build nerfed into the ground and having to start over thanks to dupers and people trading for duped gear.
---
I can't wait until tomorrow.
---
Since the start of fallout i was addicted to scavage. I was picking up everything everywhere and making raw materials out of them until the weight patch came... then i segregated my loot between 5 chars . 1 Main melee build 2 Main sniper/gunslinger 3 trader ( selling ) 4 supply stash char ( only ammo and stuff that my chars need ) 5 everything to sell / vanity . and let me tell you this . ( flips middle finger to all dupers ) I have earned.... You have stole .... we are equal now and its time to load my quad double shot revolver and start huntin
---
It wasn't initially, and only the core game is F2P.
---
Yes, but even then, most of the times you have to wait around for it to finally load up with all the enemies spawning in. Plus, I'm their to fight and get the rewards from the evemt and the Queen, not the other enemies. Not stating more people in the event is a bad thing, but its a bad thing when their is less people doing damage and just running around while only the few who are able to do damage, end up not doing much since the added on health and DR due to said low level people. 
---
It's not that complicated, they are likely only removing items on characters that have large numbers of identical god roll legendaries as well as the people that have thousands of bobbleheads. I highly doubt anyone with a single copy of a weapon duped or not is going to be affected. 
---
Naw. The game is good, Bethesda is working on ironing out the problems and most of the changes they've made thus far have came from what the community has wanted. If you want to spend all your time on the internet complaining about this game then have at it, but don't kid yourself into thinking you're acting in the best interest of the community. Bethesda will listen to you even if you're not being rude when expressing your concerns.
---
I mean, that’s bad. Have you ever thought this situation through? Performed a self reflection?
---
If there’s loads of people saying “Geez this game sucks ass” and them ACTUALLY leaving, wouldn’t you be at least a bit alarmed?
---
The “Explore for 7600 hours” with a reward of 20 atoms is a fucking joke. I LOVED Skyrim, played it across 3 platforms and I put in maybe 2500-3000 hours. I only hope that that’s an error and they meant 760. 
---
Well after tomorrow people hopefully will believe they are purged and want to trade again as duped items should now be gone. 
---
It must have been duped
---
No, Reclamation Day
---
Not anymore.
---
No, I think it's you who don't understand what a "GodRoll" is...   
---
Sentinel is "one" part of the combo, like weight reduction on heavy weapons.    
---
(Aka Having Weight Reduction on a dagger is not worth the same as having it on a Gatling Gun...)
---
Hell I currently have (5) pieces of Sentinel armor in stock, but "Zealot's + Sentinel" or "AutoStim+Sentinel" is not nearly as sought after as "Assassin's+Sentinel" or "Unyeilding+Sentinel"..
---
Where he’s going is that Bethesda admitting they cannot see player inventory. That wasn’t a smoke screen. All inventory was/is weight based. Hence stash limit and there stop the dupers by imposing a weight limit. They, in my opinion are going to run a query looking for tags: Two Shot/Explosive etc. if it matches the search, it’s deleted.  If not it stays. They will get the ubiquitous pump TSE and Handmade and maybe a handful other heavily duped items. 
---
&gt;you’ll lose wood and gain leather
---
That sounds like you're describing the aging process for old man and wife.
---
Did you played beta? they fixed shit ton of things.
---
TSE was boring shit, now i am scared when there are too much enemies around me, finaly some emotions from game.
---
What law code does duping violate?
---
Oh gosh. My photos suck compared to yours. These are quite amazing. How did you get the surprised expression?
---
I know exactly how you feel. I stopped playing that much and started trading around here.They will kill that too . Just when i thought they are done killing every piece of fun i can have with this game.
---
OMG he’s got more than ten corn soups, must be a duper!!!
---
&gt;And uh, no the current system Bethesda has is definitely bad seeing as only high damage per single hit weapons are any good, and anything based around a bunch of small hits very fast is bad.
---
Weapons that produce small hits, are weak weapons. Weak weapons againts high level enemies, yeah it's perfectly okay it doesn't work. All games have weak weapons. The same would apply in NV as well, which had two-way resistance system. If you want to argue that there are certain high grade weapons that are quite weak, namely most big ballistic, then probably you are about right. At least they require intensive perk investments, you absolutely need the penetration and spread reduction. But those are more balance things.
---
Bethesdas system is better because it's simple. Well I said that already, just in case you don't know what KISS means. It takes away the extra trouble of thinking and evaluating different ammo types. Which in other games has been a gimmic not highly used anyway. And the damage done by weapon is trivial. The higher the nominal damage, the more powerful the weapon. It's very linear easy to understand system. It's only that some weapons aren't quite where they should be.
---
seriously, delete with malice!
---
You have 5 sentinel... say good buy to them. lol.
---
I somehow managed to read most comments.  And really all you do is bitch. If you like the game you'll be back, and if you don't you won't. But if them cleaning up after massive abuse of a bug sends you packing then that is your problem. 
---
Also, stop with the entitlement, no game developer cares how many hours you already played. They care about how many still will be played, and so should you.  With these fixes they hope to get more new players in, and maybe a bunch that will return after they abandoned a broken game earlier on. As a trader, those are the people that will make the game fun again for you, not a pile of duped items and no one to sell to/from. 
---
The one thing that is abundantly clear is that this game needs fixing and cleaning up if they ever want it to be a succes. Yeah it might suck sometimes but be glad they do it. 
---
TL;DR these fixes and cleanups are necessary, quit your bitching and deal with it. 
---
Nah. You actually get flagged for having it. 
---
You’ll prolly get a ban.
---
Sucks to be you. I’d try to buy an account from some Russians online or make a new one if you’re on Xbox.
---
Whilst this update won't effect me (unless it all goes horribly wrong) I'm just hating the fact that now the few measly Caps i do have are going to buy even less because lets face it the in game vendor pricing are a slap to the face...fuck it just give me an option to Buy Caps Legit i don't have the time to Grind for impossible shit. 
---
Well....
---
Well... As I looted them all myself, except for one,'I find that highly doubtful
---
They aren't even doing instant bans on dupers NOW.  Why?  Because it takes them time to scan the databases and find accounts with 100 TSE weapons in them.  There hasn't been a game in the history of survival gaming that can manage instant bans for ANY cheat.  Aimbot, ESP, Duping, Speed Running, etc.  Even the worst cheater on the planet using ALL of that takes several hours to trip 100 red flags and get banned.  Why is that?  Because they have to minimize false positives.  Lag that caused someone to look like they're speed running.  A person having a really good game session getting flagged for aimbot.
---
So yes, those duped weapons will get traded before the dupers get banned.
---
And you're advocating for a company that's incompetent enough to ADD duping methods back INTO the game in Patch 5...............to start banning anyone who even touches a duped weapon.
---
Want to know where I got my first TSE?  It was sitting in a brown bag on the ground after a queen fight.  Not 100 of them, just a single lonely TSE Handmade.  Who wouldn't pick that up?  By your method, I should've been instantly banned from the game the instant I opened the bag.
---
Get some knowledge before you talk.
---
Every TSE weapon will be replaced with a Flare Gun.
---
I bought a melee weapon from the Enclave vendor that was so good that I'm afraid it will get Thanos'ed. I just don't see why anyone would vendor a super sledge with attack speed, vampire, and +1 Str. Someone may have dumped their dupes for caps. I hope I get to keep it but I'm not liking my chances. 
---
If you could send me your information I’ll Western Union it to you ASAP 
---
with Beth, anything can happen :)
---
Same here. I'm sick of having to deal with abusive, insulting idiots and watching nice people get targeted by some creep and his mule and having their house flattened before they get killed. It's not real PvP, it's just cyber-trolling by people with better weapons, loaded up on chems. 
---
I have whole sets of gear I collected. It’s going to be a giant annoyance. And even if most to all of my shit is left intact, I’ll still be pissed.
---
No worries, eventually I will. Only about 3 weeks ago I managed to complete the mothman lighthouse event near the vault. Tried several times but always when I noticed the event and went close, time was too low. Even if there was something like 7 mins left, which seems there's plenty of time, damn those things are just hard to catch. Failed it about 5 times at least which kinda eats motivation.
---
Maybe they just need to adjust how loot is distributed, along with how the SBQ scales to players.
---
I say that because while I can more than handle myself in a fight at level 87, I have done very few of the quests. Just can't get into playing a podcast game, but I enjoy the world overall. 
---
I thought it might cripple/bleed some enemies so they'd be slow and softened up before they reach my turrets, but indeed, whenever I step in it, the damage is really minimal.
---
I didn't try the transfer menu, will try it next time something like this happens, thanks.
---
RNG Jesus hates me so I wont have much to lose 
---
Have fun never being able to trade again safely.
---
Good way to REMOVE content from the game.  They might as well remove the trade interface.
---
Player vending too, that'll be a joke and a half.  I'm not buying ANY of your items you lousy duper.
---
I won't lie, that would be kinda cathartic; just logging in and not having a completely full stash and my on-self weight under 300 lbs. 
---
Haha agreed, played this game since launch and they are making it worse.
---
No he’d have named her Sandra.
---
Add a flamer and run around making Godzilla noises.
---
Karma. Everyone seems to forget that bitch, eh? She comes for everyone eventually... 
---
I'll bring the popcorn.
---
I don't know what to do.
---
They nerf everything.
---
Add bugs to the game, fix bugs nobody cares about.
---
Content is MIA.  I think they don't know what that word means.
---
I really want to keep playing, but every patch and bit of news that comes out is SOUL CRUSHING.
---
I really don't want to see any more Inside the Vaults.  It's just "here's some sad thing that doesn't make the game more fun".  I used to be so excited for ANY news.  Now just disappointment.
---
Define "legitimate" trader. Is there such thing? Can't you understand that being involved in any sort of trading with strangers is a risk now?
---
Sometimes he just gets pissed. 
---
Well, technically I duped an employee ID, but I think I’m doing pretty well in the custodial service dep... oh wait it says “Customer Service”... eh, close enough.
---
If you want agility without losing HP get Shielded raider underamor (+3agi) and bird bones mutation (+4agi) with this if they ever fix sneak back, you can stab enemies in head with melee weapon without being spoted.
---
People are running low healt because they have 5/5 set of Unyielding/sentinel armor. 5\*15% = immortality. 
---
It's hard to say whether or not they can see your actual inventory or if they indeed tagged items with unique identifiers that they could insta delete without looking at your inventory.
---
The stash limit is a memory issue. Too many items in the world causes server instability. Tagging items for inventory purposes would be written to.a separate database not related to game servers.
---
There's hundreds of ways Bethesda could track duped gear........I guess we will find out tomorrow what their technique is. 
---
Exactly. You don't even need to take that hard of a look at FO to see it's unique quirk within the post apocalyptic setting. 
---
Simply listening to the soundtrack of the BGS entries when compared to other games that share a post apocalyptic setting pretty much drives it home. 
---
Dupeaggedon. 
---
I figured the bit about him attacking robots would make it clear he was in Watoga. 
---
As shitty as this would be and as much as it would suck for them to do it everyone they could also just decide on a cap amount and reset every player to the same amount making it even and fair for everyone I know it's really not fair for those of us who have been playing legit but it take all thoes caps from the cheaters so that's a plus in this other wise dark cloud. Other wise us legits will be fd of somemore.
---
The Perk system after level 50 is very boring.  Having to swap perks over before you do anything is boring and slow. If you have the Perk it should stay there with additional card until all the cards are used up - THEN the swapping around should start.  The way it is around, there is no motivation to level up after level 50. The system in Fallout 4 was much better and more fun. This one is a pain. 
---
Would read this again.
---
I laughed so hard I peed a little.
---
After they hosed Radworms and Bobby Pins I have ZERO confidence they will get this right. 
---
Missing the point completely. 
---
Sort of a Radscorp molerat hybrid?
---
Better than single action ivory grips.
---
Yeah, or they just developed/figured out a way to do so. 
---
If they were going to lie about it, they would have done it weeks ago, when the duping rage hit a peak, and people like Juicehead we're reporting on dupers making real money......
---
As far as I know they haven't fixed all the dupe methods.
---
Or at least I haven't seen any news that "all dupes are forever crushed".  Hell they re-introduced dupe methods with Patch 5.  They're not that good at it.....lol
---
It won't be any safer to trade tomorrow than it is today.
---
Please explain
---
Can’t wait for the “WTF Bethesda, all my weapons are gone and I never duped” posts, followed by the smug “if you got your weapons removed, shouldn’t have duped 😎” posts and ending with “wait, they actually removed everyone’s weapons, regardless of them being duped or not, we WANT answers Bethesda” posts.
---
For bonus points the “Bethesda replied” comment that says “yikes! Passing along to dev team :)”
---
I was just thinking about this the other day &amp; im here to say I’ve never received a max lvl item in uranium fever in well over 20 runs 
---
This will be a daylong remembered. Seen the end of kenobi and will soon see the end of fallout 76
---
Not true, X-01 gives you around 60% damage reduction which is even lower if enemy have armor piercing modifiers.
---
Assasin/sentinel on the other hand gives you  40% static + (or x idk how that exactly work)  75% if you dont move and some little from armor well. if you have heavy combat thats about 300DR so another 40%. 
---
If you want bully people you pick assasin sentinel so they can't kill you easily. 
---
Based on past experience there will also be posts from guilty people claiming they are innocent and also people just making stuff up to spread false rumors. Like the whole, I got banned for crafting too many items falsehoods.
---
The loot isn't the problem. (Well, it is but we all know that as well as thats a different subject) The problem is people who simply AREN'T ready to join that fight join it and just add to the difficulity and don't do ANYTHING in return.  You think a level 11 who spends the whole fight respawning or hiding, let alone probably isn't close to that event quest line wise, should earn something or be able to join? You might be on daytripper my friend, cause I don't want that one bit.
---
This is exactly what I expect to have happen. O doubt the software has the complexity to determine a singular item's legitimacy and with most likely just target stacked legendaries in anyone's inventory. 
---
But hey, even if everything is hit, I'll still be playing.
---
Every one has hope, before the reality sets in
---
In PVP you're much slower in PA,  also with the "Superman landing" from a fall that's time your getting blasted. Armor rating isn't that dramatic man.... Overall loss of speed and mobility if anything it could use a good buff
---
That would be absurd.
---
Every network known to man goes offline to update. Do you have any software experience?
---
You go offline so that you can save a backup in case something goes wrong.
---
If you don't own duped gear don't worry about it. 
---
yup and a good half of the fixed bugs from previous patches will be back as normal just to fucking piss anyone left still playing off even more. so sad that this game could of been so great if they had of tried.
---
I didn’t even laugh and I peed a lot. 
---
Cool
---
Yep. I am worried given their track record. I have little confidence this will go off without a hitch. 
---
Wait. What?  My understanding was the box on the artillery wouldn’t allow stuff to be put in, thereby preventing duping.  I seem to remember this being fixed ages ago. 
---
Yep, I'm the duper, you got me. You are so incredibly perceptive, how did I ever expect to fool /you/
---
Anyway, you got my two cents, do with it what you will, although at least one of them was probably obtained by duping (please don't tell the bank) 
---
Why do you care about the helmet being added in the game? You should be worried about your account status! Seems like a more pressing issue.
---
I'm not going to be the surprised if this doesn't roll out the way Bethesda thinks it will and they wind up vanishing peoples legit stuff, based on there previous patch record. 
---
Also can we get Two-shot un-nerfed now, sense the real issue was everyone and there mom having a dupped TSE weapon. With this Vanishing, TSE's should be back to ultra-rare.
---
Everything on the Atom Shop is absolute shit so if I play for 7600 hours Bethesda should pay off my truck or something.
---
What’s coming in the next update or has it not been announced? Just wondering since I’m not keeping up with any of it. 
---
Atomic Shop would be better if the prices matched the product. Never gonna pay $18 for a paint, not going to pay $5 for a dart board, not going to pay $14 for an armor that was included in a $20 DLC/simple port.  
---
I had behemoth spawn at camp for long period of time. I used to farm him, to get all those weapons and armor to scrap for mods. They have biggest pool of random items (lever action, handmades, Smgs,.....). Some times there was legendary, but you must not look on legendary like yeah now i will get some dope item. Thats not how RNG works. If you have problem with killing him, just let him be and go kill some 50lvl ghouls.
---
it’s the only way to check how many hours you’ve played in total, not necessarily a joke but an alternative to actually showing how much time you’ve spent in the game
---
There's a high chance for that, judging by they latest updates
---
And are left with people like you. The bottom feeders of the internet. 
---
People can enjoy a flawed game. Perfectly polished games don't exist. Different people just have different thresholds of issues vs the fun you get out of a game. It's no different than books or movies. 
---
I mean, you can be one of those people who only like critically acclaimed films. You know the type. Shallow, boring, predictable, elitist movie jerk offs, but who wants to be one of those people ?
---
Thanks for sharing the learning with all of us (I thought this too), and *respect* for the guts to publicly own a mistake.
---
Whole game is a joke at this point...
---
*bracers for the downvotes*
---
Forgot to mention you can't get legendary PA wheras you can get broken shit like sentinel/ unyielding with combat armor and take thousands of damage as long as your standing still
---
Thank you for explaining.  I don't pvp, so I had no idea. 
---
Instructions unclear; you have been downvoted
---
This is kind of a double edged sword isn't it? On one hand you have Bethesda, the reps on here, and a small population of others saying "well we had to do something" or "this is only the dupers fault, you shouldn't have traded for that." I get why, just, it's way to late. 
---
The game has been out 4 months. Has seen 5 patches that have honestly failed to truly fix anything. Any time one thing is fix something that was not broken before is now broken or a past fix gets unfixed. Duping was always an issue but even after it got fixed another avenue opened, why were these not ironed out/tested? Even if not found before launch (which is a poor excuse for any triple A title) why not after 4 months? 
---
Then there is the two shot and explosive legendary "balance" which if we can all be honest is a huge nerf which magically included a 5 rank perk card that rendered not only the explosive weapons but ALL explosives pretty useless. Why was this done? This was done because of failed attempts to stop duping and because everyone had the insane weapon roll. Oh and let's not forget it was also done to "balance pvp" as if that is the main player base of the game. Now, I did agree with balancing these weapons but it did go a little too far. 
---
Along with the balance changes we saw a maximum carry weight cap. Why was this done? To effect dupers and make it so they would have to drop tons of items before they could move or except caps. In reality this did not work and mainly effected people who ran shop characters. Oops. 
---
Oh, we also have seen XP being nerfed every single patch. Why? Because people were power leveling? Who cares? Let them get to 50 if they want. Let them catch up to friends so they feel viable. It doesnt matter much after 50 anyway, I mean it's not like you actually get any more perks.
---
Drop rates, oh boy those were way to good for nuke zones, you know end game stuff, so let's nerf that too. Oops it made the queen, who was never all that great anyway which is a joke to begin with, not worth the resources at all. Good job ruining the only end game boss you have. Seriously though, when you kill 10 3* enemies and 9 of them drop 1* items, what do you think people are going to do? They are going to look for trades because the system is such a joke that it makes actually hunting for end game items a life consuming endeavor. 
---
So this leads us to now. "Let's delete duped items that have certain prefixes" does that also mean the 3* Anti-Armor explosive with faster crit fill black powder rifle or the 2* Bloodied explosive black powder rifle I found with a buddy as a witness? I mean they fall into the most commonly duped items perk set but are 100% not duped and never traded. If so am I just supposed to except it? Go oh well guess I should play another 100 hours to get something that is top tier?
---
Why delete items now? Why let all the trading and selling go on for so long? Why after all the nerfs and failed patches? Yes this is because of the huge duping mess that was the start of the game, but they just used systems which you, Bethesda, could not iron out. No I dont agree with exploiting but I also dont agree with a dev team that constantly makes this harder and more and more of a grind just to stretch out the already incredibly thin end game we currently have. There is literally nothing left to do but try to build caps, kill legendaries for a unicorn drop, or buy/trade for items you actually want but can not get to drop because of the lackluster loot system. 
---
This will not magically revive the market nor will it bring back the player base that is already lost. This is just going to drive many more away. Why not actually fix the broken systems and then increase the level cap of weapons? Once the systems are fixed so things cannot be duped add a in game seller where you can buy these top tier weapons? You know a global weekly resetting inventory vendor who you need to exchange a new end game currency with? 
---
I just hope when I get on after this massive removal that the guns I actually did find are not gone. I know I have some that are duped but I'm pretty sure 99% of everyone who has any decent sum of time on this game has a few duped items. 
---
I'm pretty sure a couple of weapons I found in a brown baggy outside my C.A.M.P. is duped.
---
Not everyone is asocial. 
---
As for 4, in my experience the workshops have their own individual spawn tables that is the main determining factor on what spawns and not player level. 
---
Not if they coordinate. One mule to hold the items, other player(s) to make vendor runs.  
---
They generally don’t work solo. 
---
As a TSE owner I don't care. I hardly ever use it. It's too dangerous for close combat. My ghoul Slayer polehook however is awesome. 
---
That doesn't seem to be actually the same.

Thread sorting seems to be by date of last post, just like in most forums. Likes &amp;dislikes system is not the same as Reddits downvoting, because in Reddit it affects the order of threads in default sorting view, as well as it effectively hides replies. Reddit's system is fairly novel and it had any good grounds to it, it would have been at least partially copied by many others. It semi works on large subs where it allows the sub to exist without breaking it up into smaller pieces.
---
No! Paddle Balls are supposed to be rare! Are you crazy! Are you out of your mind!
---
So much negativity...  It's really sad to see people gripe about a game that they don't even play.
---
No problem... Yeah dude power armor is a bad move unless your a pve guy
---
But pa has tons of mods
---
As if they haven't already.
---
The bazaar is hopping right now. People are literally having fire sales. 
---
Please highlight our paper bags so only we can see it.  It's boring looking for them, particularly if they haven't appeared because of a bug (as at the Garrahan mining centre (or whatever it's called). 
---
Ooh, are you going on a manhunt??? Can I join!
---
True but nothing as broken as legendary effects, jetpack is great but anyone can get marsupial and basically have that vertical escape
---
A word on online games with builds and loot:
---
It's expensive to hop on the new popular OP build. They get nerfed. Every single time. Then you gotta pay again to hop on the next one. 
---
the half walls aren't supposed to be cover, the barricades are for cover, the half walls are to give you vaulted ceilings.
---
errr... so does that = yes or no to the OP Question?  I had read Todd saying this was supposed to be still some how still in the lore which even with BOS and SM... I jumped in... played 100% the Quest and said sure okay why not, but since it's here again still not sure if the whole thing works?
---
Hopefully they will be fixing some of the hundreds of bugs during that time, not just getting rid of dupped weapons and potentially less disconnects.
---
I’ve bought tons of junk. I’m sure most of it was earned honestly. 
---
Never had this problem 
---
I always thought an online Fallout game would allow you to play as different races all with different strength and weaknesses
---
Human, super mutant, ghoul. Deathclaw might be a bit hard. Maybe a robot? 
---
Looking forward to log on tmr and see my 200 pure water get deleted.
---
What dupe update, is there some new info somewhere? Fallout.com shows just the inside the vault thing from last week?
---
Awwww. I can just picture you're angry little face. Tears welling up in the corners of your eyes, fighting to hold them back. 
---
If this isn't "your" game too? Do us all a favour, hate lurk else where. 
---
Fuckity bye. 
---
I think ppl are over estimating things.
---
Bethesda said a very small amount of ppl will be effected yet this sub thinks a very large amount will
---
Yea but for those of us playing legit we still have to wait for stash space :(
---
With how wearily often people post lies on this sub and how absolutely rampant glitch exploiting has been, i'm not going to assume someone who claimed to falsely be targetted is innocent.
---
There will likely be people who don't even play FO76 or who haven't lost anything making posts claiming they did lose items and are innocent. Just to stirr up shit.
---
Then there will no doubt be a large number of people who simply don't know what happend, and didn't realize that free TSE they got from some random was a dupe. So they'll definitely be here crying foul as well.
---
I think in general people shouldn't be harrassed, anyone that claims they were a victim of this better be ready to show some proof though if they want to be taken serious.
---
No, they won't lose all.  Not yet.
---
They're going to lose 90% of the traders.  Both trading sub-reddits are going to be dead zones after this.
---
You can go trade for powerful items as well.  It's not this secret club nobody talks about.  I saw newbies with 0 karma points spending caps to buy "good end-game items".  RIP caps, those are gone now newbie, sorry!
---
The Fun Police seem to find every way they can to suck more fun, nerf more things, and make people mad.  I don't understand it.
---
Low key would carry a drill around if it had a hidden "reduce materials required to build camp structures" effect that stacked with contractor perk card.
---
If you could do better you wouldn't be a gamer caring about a $30 game
---
really? because general maxson founded the BoS after the bombs dropped. since he went awol/traitor before the bombs dropped because of the experiments at mariposa with the fev and was disillusioned with the government. seems according to the source you are using would have everything calling him the founder be wrong since he would be dead before then.
---
It's just a video game.
---
If they delete legitimately dropped gear than the game is dead.
---
If they delete your gear that was duped....well you should have realized how incredibly rare the gear was that you were buying and that it was probably duped gear.
---
I personally don't have any sympathy for anyone who was trading for duped gear. Duping ruined this game.
---
&gt; I would kill everyone who put me in jail. 
---
Eh.. please don’t. In the meantime before your inevitable imprisonment, I have a more fun way to play a certain video game 👍
---
GIVE ME REWARD SO I CAN ENJOY MYSELF.  haha 
---
It is used for people to track their ingame time. Btw in 450hours i got 9500 atoms just by playing. So whats your problem?
---
Not me either. But I am about level 10 and can't even afford to fast travel. The vendors just look absurd to me, buying my stuff for pennies and stocked with things that look unaffordable. 
---
They let it ffag out and fester, now people aren't even positive if their weapon they traded for is legit.  So they're all in a panic because of it. It's understandable.
---
It's going to be a bloodbath, but especially if they execute this like idiots and wipe people's inventories and what not on accident. This has all kinds of potential to be the most colossal fuckup they've ever done.
---
Yeah I know that's what they're not supposed to be for. 
---
There is only 1 type of barricade that you can put on floors and roofs, the others need to be on the ground. 
---
haven't you learned anything? don't ever believe Todd. ever.

"BETHESDA TRIES TO REMOVE DUPED ITEMS FROM CHEATERS ACCOUNT, NEW BUG TURNS 76 INTO A WHOLE NEW ASSET FLIP KART RACER"
---
I'm about ready to go back to Fo4. just mod all the npcs away and voila, the Fallout 76 experience- except on a better game.
---
They will wipe your account, so you can level up again and do again that quest, problem solved now you have all rise again.
---
Great, if now only Besthesda could admit they are not longer working on this game!
---
If you don't know, don't  by.
---
I don't buy any of these conveniently naive bullshit.
---
SBQ's health should be static. With a dynamic health pool of ANY boss (looking at you, Monster Hunter) you're encouraging toxicity and solo play. With a static health pool having anyone come along to help is encouraged because it actually is a case of 'the more the merrier'.
---
Also, since she is the endgame content, give her a guaranteed 3 star max level legendary drop. This way, if a level -30 comes in and gets some drops its like "congrats, you can't use it for another 20 levels. Have fun with the decreased stash space". Or at then end of her defeat just have a notification of "No rewards, must be level 50 to participate in this event". After 1 of those, they'll get the hint.
---
Mass insertion (kek) is a lot more messy than mass deletion for various reasons.
---
And they may now just have the ability. Or it's an access level thing. The support guy can't but the operations manager can or something.
---
What is more fun than eating other vault dwellers before they pass out?
---
3? You're an optimist aren't you. 
---
He's probably already got most of it cut and recorded. At this point he'll just make it up. 
---
They 100% inherited the FO4 framework. I got curious about some theory crafting stuff so I got FO76Edit and everything is still in there from FO4. DLC numbers, enemies, effects, everything. And everything is referenced as magical effects, enchantments, alchemy, etc from the origins as an Elder Scrolls engine. It's a giant line of inheritance for a single player game.
---
I’ve been randomly approached by TONS of people wanting to trade. It happens when you’re a higher level. They want to see what you’ve got and to try to get something they think you’ll part with for a good price.
---
I’ve also had people see me on the map, drop an invite, then fast travel to me specifically to try to sell me something. 
---
Nope. Done 16x and no plans
---
&gt;And they may now just have the ability.
---
I got that - but now that they have the ability, their refusing to fix item loss through glitches will be a deliberate policy, not a 'we can't do this' but a 'we won't do this'.
---
Hope your right. 
---
dont worry.... Bethesda will botch this like everything else they have done lately (other than finally stopping duping) and remove non duped items as well.... 
---
I've got Marsupial and when I get Radworms I take damage when I land. 
---
Problem is, of my group of 4 who started im the only one still playing. If they server wiped I’d probably still play occasionally, but not nearly as much as I do now. I’d be ok losing all equipment but not my junk and levels...
---
This has me worried. I bought a two shot pump action shotgun from the traveling super mutant yesterday, I feel like it's too good to be true. I finally got a good legendary and it's gonna be gone, watch. Bought it from a damn npc...
---
Would be almost entirely pointless as TSE is far inferior to other effects and combos like AAE that has become the new hotness. 
---
&gt;I pretend saying negative things about Fallout 76 is unpopular because reasons
---
lol no ...no one was duping excavator armor i assure you 
---
Pretty sure this comment was a tongue-in-cheek joke not a serious commentary.
---
I've had the issue with legendaries fleeing. I actually have a clip saved from two robots in watoga doing this one after another was going to post the clip for awareness but looks like you got that covered. 
---
A purge of the duped items. Theories abound that it will affect every item that was ever duped, but I expect they’ll just be wiping duper inventories. 
---
Hey, so, quick question not completely related to this... I was scrolling through your account looking for evidence to counteract your argument, and I heard you talk about "Pizza Pockets". What are those, and do they taste good?
---
That is billions. 
---
Instead of the fixing the sneak perk, they change the perk cards to read;
---
"You have a 25% chance of being 25% harder to detect while sneaking."
---
"You have a 50% chance of being 50% harder to detect While sneaking."
---
"You have a 75% chance of being 75% harder to detect while sneaking."
---
What’s this about?, can’t find anything doing a search
---
Not new bugs, old ones are getting added back in with each patch. 
---
Unless it had every mod I think you're safe.  
---
My god...
---
Todd did not say the thing in question.
---
I met mothman in the road, with two buddies behind me.
---
He didn't move, so we took some selfies and beat him to death with baseball bats.
---
Good times.
---
Well with all the dupping it messes with the servers. We should of ratted the bastid duppers out. 
---
My mate I play with did that. All his shit. All. Of. It. Is duped. Didn’t farm for shit, and after tomorrow won’t have shit.
---
Sucks to suck.
---
Or maybe you should have waited for Fallout 5 because you are clearly not into multiplayers. No matter how much you want Fo76 yo be a singleplayer co-op experience it is not, it is a full multiplayer game.
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
Many dumbass ‘griefers’ will have soiled pants that’s all. 
---
I I guffawed, but had just peed moments earlier.
---
I refuse to use an explosive shotgun or pistol for that same reason. I almost kill myself enough with my tse (hopefully not duped) handmade. 
---
Come back tomorrow and there’s a chance you’ll find that you won’t have Stash problems anymore.
---
I hope your right.
---
I’ve found a couple really good weapons at vendors over the last 2 months. Pretty sure they’re duped lol. 
---
Meh.
---
I’ve earned a lot too haha, I’m just saying the effort should match the reward. The main point of the free atoms are incentives to get you to keep playing and hopefully buy some eventually. 
---
I want my penny back...
---
Just a reminder to maybe get a screen shot of your inventory before they go ham deleting things.
---
*dont need a stash if I uninstall the game*
---
Dupe purge. I doubt they’ll hit everyone’s inventory though.  Most likely just the players with obviously duped items. 
---
What kind of legendaries? Most resently duped stuff should be pretty high end 3 starts, talking like AA explosive then the third being about one of the top effects for it's slot. 
---
I brought max level explosive pump action from vendor. It could be duped, probably isn't, not recently at least, but even after nerfs, the only reason why anyone would sell a fairly powerful weapon like it to a vendor, is because of high number of god tier dupes making plain explosive shotguns just meh to many people.
---
Graham a duper too?......say it ain't so.
---
If it didn't have Explosive you're probably good.
---
I've found a couple really good weapons on enemy corpses. Pretty sure they're duped.
---
Everyone always does.
---
*Modern problems require modern solutions.*
---
They're probably going to be looking for stacks of 7 or higher when it comes to weapons and armor; if they can even do that.
---
Seriously, fuck that guy. 
---
whew! /jk.. 
---
It was the only thing that I could think of in my inventory. I guess that it would be like duping Raider PA and who in their right mind would do that! 
---
It must be my guilty conscience from not tracking it down myself.
---
The sun can kill a man from 93 million miles away and has been firing on all cylinders for 4 billion years. I wish my Plasma Gat could do that.
---
Finally. I’ll still be sitting at like 450-550 constantly
---
My favorite weapon is all rise so...🤷‍♂️
---
Alduin
---
&gt; hey guys i wanted to join the conversation too and i just wanted everyone to know that i have a small penis
---
Devs will accidentally wipe all characters and game reverts back to day one with all the bugs returned.
---
It’s almost 100% hosted on either azure or aws or both. So no such luck. 
---
I'm pretty sure the purge happens tomorrow.
---
Hyperbole was saying it was 50 bugs, he has about that many in just the "Quest busters" segment.  If anything it is closer to 1001 than 50, this is a 3 hour video and he spends about 20 seconds to a minute on each bug.
---
Well, I pretty much figure my 2k cap tse handmade is gone. Oh well, I have had it for since just before they nerfed them so I guess I got my money's worth. 
---
well i'm safe everything i am currently using is self found 
---
&gt; Not true, X-01 gives you around 60% damage reduction which is even lower if enemy have armor piercing modifiers.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; ​
---
Okay. 
---
Where did I say otherwise?
---
I only said that a lot of assholes who fuck with people wear X01 with jetpacks. 
---
I did not say their build was effective. 
---
Nobody is pissed except the few griefers, good riddance for sure. 
---
I can't wait!!!!
---
Tomorrow we find out how many people have been leaning on duped gear as a crutch.
---
&gt; same as saying they can't prove if a player duped an item or bought an item that 
---
Lucky for Bethesda, they didn't say that. It was you. So they don't have to explain it :)
---
it's a joke. point is, Bethesda lies. all the time. their word is worth squat.
---
No,  they weren't the only counter.  Not by a long shot. 
---
I need those for my own back yard. English Mastiff and Cane Corso (Italian Mastiff)
---
He must have had duped loot
---
Be my guest if you are on ps4
---
Pretty sure this will be death of this game...there are sooo many duped items out there and not just guns &amp; armor
---
Im pretty sure all players that loose best gear will quit the game. Casual players who do no care about gear probably will stay but.
---
Didn't even think of the golf balls! Agh!
---
Thanks so much for the info!
---
Yes, your duped gear will be gone like the wind. 
---
Thanks I hope so, its just 1 star but it's my best weapon right now, crossing my fingers.
---
says you. meanwhile, the vast majority of the playerbase plays solo or with irl friends.
---
just because Bethesda is releasing survival servers that doesn't mean pvp is what the players want. most of us play this mess despite it being online, not because of it.
---
Well now I know what I'm spending my night doing! Thanks so much!
---
If there is anyone playing left to buy it
---
FO5 eta 2028
---
that's a long wait
---
Let me guess you bought a TSE from ebay now you are angry you will lose it.
---
Exactly the same. I have a public area downstairs that has all of the workbenches, beds, food and guitar. 
---
The upstairs area is my private quarters and I lock that as well as my junk extractor. 
---
So far no one has broken in but I don't know if that's because I'm hidden off the beaten track, dwindling player numbers or no real interest in using other people's camps. 
---
Hey, can you like, switch consoles so I can join?
---
Where do you get the helmet paintjob from?
---
Everything I have I found, except my primary weapon, I kind of expect it to be gone. Will suck, but I have others that are almost as good. 
---
Yeah.  Don't kink shame them. 
---
Hahahaha i wish my man i wish....
---
Have the servers shutdown already?
---
That's awesome! I'm 95% with you! 
---
You’re not the only one
---
Fuck... I could really go for killing some more people...
---
Sutton’s where it’s at, man. Can farm scorched for loot and Mole Rats for food
---
Hopefully mods in here will be on top of it and ban/delete all the ragequit emoposts. Find another game. You are maxed out and are complaining about minutae, attempting to poop on the fun the newbies are having leveling up. just leave. maybe come back when there's an expansion. Or... don't. 
---

Yes PS4 servers shutdown has started some time ago 
---
Yea I feel this is too heavy handed. I spent many hours grinding on monster mash, the queen and through hard work got quite a few legit legendaries which I used to again spend countless hours on the market trading to trade for items I want. Now I feel all my hard work will be going to waste. It's so unfair to players who have put in the work like myself, trading away my legit items to the dupers while my items get wiped. I will definitely uninstall and stop playing if my items get wiped and I am sure many others will do the same
---
YEP, already started a post about it!

---
How is Bethesda going to do a Q&amp;A with people that don't follow or engage with them on social media at all? What do you want them to do? 
---
My guess is they're combing accounts for weapons in quanitities that exceed probability of legitimate generation. So if you have one it's probably fine. If you have two, maybe still fine... but three... not likely that you found three of the same rare legendary combo. DELET.
---
Given the low amounts and varied items, I’m guessing a weight dump, not from a duper. 
---
Higher level players (myself included) tend to find areas frequented by other players (I usually use the overseer cache on Flatwoods) to drop off stuff we don’t need to trim down weight. If you don’t have Bandolier, ammo adds up fast, as do FCs without Batteries Included. 
---
I also dump worthless plans since they weigh 0.25 ea. 
---
All I want to see is this item deletion end up duping items some how. That will just be perfect.
---
I could really go with somone.... well no cross play for us thanks to this game... oh well
---
Yes, fallout 76 is still in the same time line as 1, 2, 3, nv, qnd 4.
---
BoS founded by a disillusioned general maxson was contacting surviving members of the military to try and organize them and in the process founded the brotherhood of steel. in part to give people something to believe in because survival is as much psychological as it is physical.  hence the religious and knightly overtones, and why people stayed despite thinking it was absurd. once the satellites went down the WV chapter was on its own and got wiped out.
---
people get stuck on if things like super mutants and BoS should even exist but what bothers me is terminology. Why did the east and west coast all decide "super mutants" "raiders" and the like? hell we cant even decide if it is soda or pop. (its pop btw.)
---
**Tomorrow's patch removed trading from the game.**
---
Please remember to thank Bethsda for this wonderful content!
---
Not that I was worried about it, but more hoping that it would disappear (it's kind of ugly!)
---
Definitely lol. 
---
Re: the displaying of items in CAMP.  A lockable glass cabinet, separate from our stash budget, would be nice.  Many of us would be willing to buy the cabinet in the Atom shop.  It would also be good if we could display these items without other people being able to walk in and pick them up.  Make them immune to collection if inside our CAMP boundary.  As we know, there is a bug enabling players to walk through the windows in CAMP buildings now so the grubs will just steal everything we decorate with - otherwise they'll be even more motivated to break down our walls to steal from us.  Those bookcase doors with all the different decorations which couldn't be picked up (in Fallout 4) were really nice for internal doors too (and theft-proof).
---
Okay. I don't know too much about it. I was just wondering 
---
Celeste was damn incredible. If you haven't tried it yet pick up The Messenger
---
No game lasts forever for everyone. 
---
I platted Spider Man in 4 days.
---
If you're on PC I've got some pretty good weapons and armor that I need to get rid of. 
---
China, please go away. Stop spamming your post everywhere. 
---
Good thing that none of it is real and it's just video game stuff. 
---
Because if it were real you would have a reason to be angry. But because it's not real and is a fucking game, you can choose not to be angry because it's a game. 
---
you think ANYONE is buying another fallout game after this absolute shit show? NOPE
---
&gt;EDIT: Link cause some aren't quite getting the joke
---
Yeah how could be get, to know you are not talking about ingame items.
---
Oh well, indeed...
---
Those subs won’t be dead. There’s still plenty of activity with items that wouldn’t even be worth duping. Getting legendaries isn’t hard, but getting the perfect one is, just because the sub won’t be full of TSE and bloodied 3* weapons doesn’t mean it’ll be dead. Plenty of other drops will be sold.
---
It’s going to suck for people with duped gear, but it needs to happen. I’m glad they’re finally doing it regardless of all the “my legitimate gear was deleted!!” posts that are sure to happen. This is a long term fix, if they don’t address it now it would only get worse in time:
---
Oh, well, I'm not on PS4, but cool?
---
Joke's on you, I quit two days ago.
---
Maybe it effects the loading screens?  Randomly selecting from a huge pool of photos might somehow adversely effect them maybe?
---
Joke's on you, I quit two months ago.
---
They brought back dupe methods with Patch 5.
---
If you think this is the end of duping, you've never played a survival game before.
---
Please enjoy trading with your fellow vault dwellers, and when your new stuff disappears, you should've known that was a super duper trade!
---
All this will do is kill trading.  Why trade my "good" item for your "possibly duped to be deleted soon" item.
---
The post is pretty straightforward.
---
Depends on platform and cost for the long coat. If you paid less than 750 for the long coat, it’s almost guaranteed to be a dupe as this is (if memory serves correct) about what the vendor bot charges for it. 
---
The TSE shotgun is almost certainly duped, no ifs, ands, or buts. 
---
Dude, you gotta go to watoga... you've got two unique vendors within a stones throw from each other:Vendor Bot Phoenix at super duper mart and the bot at the train station. 400 more caps a day plus decent plans/mods with Phoenix. 
---
I thought the servers werent supposed to go down until 9am est.
---
"Legitimate"
---
"Honest"
---
I don't think these mean what you think they mean.
---
Convenient naivete is just that, convenient. 
---
You knew where this shit was coming from.
---
Loot used to drop based on YOUR level.
---
They nerfed it.
---
A lot of people missed it.
---
Enjoy your nerf.
---
Also they're deleting thousands of items out of traders inventorys tomorrow.
---
Isn't this game FUN?
---
Put a banner up at login.
---
Aren't purges and shitfests kinda the same thing?
---
Killer! I'll be on maybe tomorrow, Valentine's Day :/ 
---
I think they are keeping hush hush about the exact workings of the dupe removal in order to prevent any kind of potential loop holes the duper’s may use to keep their duped weapons. I’m not sure though only a guess
---
Correct but i have just played and sudden the maintnance countdown has started
---
I'm playing on PS4 right now. What are you talking about?
---
You're not the only one.  I believed there was like a 600-800 cap selling limit on all vendors across the map, I was wrong.
---
Keith quit following me, it's creepy.  I'll get a restraining order I swear :)
---
yea i havnt wore that armor in forever if i do get in power armor it's my max lvl nuka t51 set
---
Probably.
---
Fuck that. It took me like 3 months to get level 34
---
I've tried that. Put all junk in stash and work from camp. No dice. Have all of it on me personally. Nope.
---
Whoops. Still, I'm surprised that it stacked that high, and didn't cap out at a 32 bit signed integer. 
---
This is literally my fucking post. Stop spamming your link everywhere and telling others to do the same.

It'll be curious how this pans out.  I have no idea what Bethesda can and can't do with the server content, the ability to tract action and inventory over time, the ability to differentiate duped vs legitimate, legitimate item volume vs duped item volume, etc.  It'll be interesting to read what people say after, aka how well or poorly it worked.  Then you have people saying to just reset the whole thing, clean slate.  That too is certainly an option.  Despite my time put in, I'd be largely indifferent any way Bethesda slices it.  It is merely a game after all, and it's all quite silly to put high real world value on a game.  It's a tool for play in ones pastime and little else.  I say this as a guy who's played Pacman on Atari, Oregon Trail on a PC II (fancy I know), and worked my way up over the years through consoles and PCs, and through piles and piles of games, just like many of you who are of at least some age.  A game is a game.  It's meant for playing and wasting time.  If it means something else to you, I have bad news for you.  You're doing it wrong, and you might want to reevaluate your life choices.  Also, to call FO76 a bad game is pretty bullshit.  Bethesda did good work.  They did short work, unfortunately, but it's good for what it is.  FO4 is better, and FO76 is a step backwards in several places.  FO76 is also a step foward in several others.  It's a good attempt, just not groundbreaking.  Play the game.  Have fun.  Enjoy the game for what it is.
---
Probably won’t be going after every duped item, only the sources. It’s been their stance in the past as evidenced by other posts here. 
---
I'm on Xbox and working from camp. 
---
The radstorms from Fallout 4 are in this game as well, they just don't happen as often.
---
Grinding for caps isnt that bad. When you're in the late game, you will be grinding for good legendaries to trade and now u feel all the hard work you put grinding for those legendaries will be of no use. Caps can easily be earned but the sad part is when you have to trade a really good legit legendary and find out the item u received has been wiped while the other guy gets to keep your hard earned item....
---
Nothing major. Scream cooldown, radworms fix, minor stuff.
---
I love it when the community isn't even surprised at this point that something will be broken and decides to take bets on what it'll be. BGS is that dysfunctional guy at work that no one is surprised their project didn't work or was a total shitshow at launch.
---
That sounds like Enclave scum talk to me!!! 
---
I wholeheartedly agree, Bethesda doesn't even make a cut from the people trading to obtain legendaries so why punish the player with a 300,000 to 1 chance to get the legendary effect they are looking for. I would understand the forced legendary rarity if there was a second way to get legendaries that involved the atomic shop, but we don't have that option, we only have dupers selling items. I don't think it's any different to pay a npc a stack of caps for a legendary than it is to give that stack of caps to a duper, which everyone seems fine with. 
---
Judging by the number of people who are hoping they fuck up bad enough to reset everyone back to reclamation day I think the remaining player base will be just fine afterward. As long as they don't mess up that second bit about the server stability.
---
Thanks. I don't wear my Excavator Armour because it's lower level protection than the level 50 T series Armour but I'll try that. 
---
God, when are they going to give me some more PA colours to choose from? I'm sick of the others. 
---
Enjoy Player Vending.
---
I'm sure you won't wonder every single time what items you buy will be "deleted" later.
---
Fun Police unite!  As one!  Delete all the fun!
---
If you go to the websites selling these items, you can see they often sell the exact same ones.
---
Goodbye.  Apparently you are a fake-fan. Good riddance to you.
---
Typical right wing responce. 
---
Username... doesn't check out?
---
I think your safe. It was either dupe purge or reset, and we are getting the dupe purge.
---
I lost a \*\*\* mole miners gauntlet little ways back for my nopa build. God, I miss that thing. Thanks for zapping it back in my stash, bethesda. Cool
---
I’ve been playing since NV and went back and got 3 afterward. I’m not a “fake fan”. I’m just poking fun at how piss-poor their fixes have been so far. 
---
In this country your allowed to sue for things when a company wrongs you. They arent afraid to challenge digital studios.
---
Not for much longer 
---
There doesn’t need to be any clarity... everyone knew there was duped items and there was a chance that if they traded with another player they would receive one. 
---
we are the test server... this is the B.E.T.A
---
The post says "Players who have used an exploit to dupe items, or acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed from their accounts" This isnt all that clear. It says they "may" find the items removed? it also says "Players who have used an exploit to dupe items" does this mean non dupers who traded for duped items will not be affected? Will some be affected some not? Just seems unclear.
---
Unfortunately TS isn’t that great of an effect anymore. 
---
Thx for the reply, we decided not to get it yet even though we are all big fanboys because of all the hate and we are going to just wait for something big like an update or something to bring us back if it ever happens and then we might get it. Thanks again mate
---
I was on 10 minutes ago.
---
As I understand your grief, I would recommend you to finish the game:even if you don't like the end, the level design is astonishing. And I love how, when you become stronger than your ennemies, the game change and new difficulties appears. 
---
[https://imgur.com/a/cubiENg](https://imgur.com/a/cubiENg) there you go fresh from oven
---
"Duped items weren't just deleted, THEY WERE MURDERED!!!"
---
You obviously haven't traded there a lot.
---
Do you know how many sad 1 star items just sit there forever.  Nobody wants that crap.  YOU can farm that crap yourself by going to Whitesprings or the SBQ.  You don't need to pay someone for that.
---
People went there to find BETTER stuff than the had.  And to trade and trade and trade until they had the best stuff.
---
But sure, people will totally swap the meta overnight and start buying 1 star garbo guns and armor.
---
OOPS, forgot to say, make sure NONE of it is duped!  You know how to tell right?  It says DUPE DUPE DUPE when you try to trade.  That's when you know Bethesda Fun Police will come in and delete it out of your inventory later.

It Just Works!

I was on 10 minutes ago, no message. It's fresher.

Figured out the problem... I’m an idiot.   I wasn’t actually in the Mayors office.   There’s another office in the Municipal building that has a safe and it had been a while since I did Mayor for a Day so I thought I was in the right place.   Then I remembered that Maia was in the mayors office.  Looked around again, found the real mayors office, found the safe, 11 Stimpacks.  Thanks again.

Servers can have individual maintenance, check if you can still hop on to a different one. 
---
well then you are lucky beacuse i cannot enter anymore the game
---
I see you're having issues with your ID, please call the Helldesk Service Line to have this resolved in a timely manner.
---
Are you implying that all players who traded for duped weapons knew? I didn't know until I started trading more heavily on the discord app which was after I had gotten my weapon, and even then I was only guessing. What were people going to do stop trading altogether because duping was rampant?
---
If only it cured my crippling depression

Not North America I assume then.

I'm on Xb1, I appreciate the offer though.

You played nv and then fo3. You are a fake fan

 Goodbye, good riddance.  We will be better off without you.

AA with explosive?

I hear that.  I'd use it as a fast travel aid ;)
---
Oh sorry, this is you enjoying other people's pain.
---
I'll leave.  By all means, enjoy shitting on people who enjoy trading.
---
You must be a wonderful person in real life!  Bravo!
---
Depends on the implications
---
If i remember right the enclave was involved and then just let em roam free. 
---
Downvote brigade, reporting for duty.
---
Items, plural. "..acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed.." I don't see mention of this removing single items specifically. They claim it will target only a small number of accounts and since there are a large number of accounts holding a single "duped" item that seems to indicate those items won't be targeted. I guess we'll see though.
---
Wait what is this purge? Is everything gonna reset? Like the characters gonna be earased?
---
&gt;What were people going to do stop trading altogether because duping was rampant?
---
Uh, yes?
---
I wish my legit TSE harpoon gun still did 1500 damage.
---
Hey, I could say the same for you.
---
I have numerous comments from yours shitting on people too.
---
If I'm a wonderful person in real life, you're a fucking angel.
---
Nope. Just a bunch of duplicated items.
---
Yeah because 80% of the playerbase were never the targeted audience for this game. For example a company that always makes singleplayer story games decides to make their next game a car racing game and promise to make their upcoming singleplayer story game in about 8 years. Car racing fans will obviously buy the game. But then for some weird reason singleplayer story fans will buy the car game in greater mass outnumbering the targeted audience and demand to transform that car game into the next Fallout 5. And since they are the majority they want to remove racing competition and add DLC story content to a car racing game and yell that it sucks because it still isn't the singleayer story game you wanted. Bottom line is that the game was never for you even if you bought it in greater numbers.
---
I will login to the game right now and kill you for insulting my screen name
---
You may have an item created by duping. It may not be there when you log in. That's clear to me. They may not go into details about bans, individual or large scale, with the community. The decision they make will be between the offender and the company. It's not an uncommon practice for any online game trying to address exploits in this manner. If they choose to discuss it on social platforms or address it on their website, that's their decision. But they do not need to specify the outcome. I've seen publishers and companies not pursue bans. I've seen them ban hammer across the board. It's chaotic either way. I've seen public statements and I've seen it on the hush side. It's chaotic either way. 
---
They're clear about what may happen to unsuspecting people. 
---
I got the BoS paint. 
---
Now if only the leg and chest plans would show 
---
Post removed, I guess the mods didn't realize it was a joke.

I asked this question a couple of days ago, go to my account page to find the thread, there's some very useful info there :)

Ehh. Semantics. The small fry support guy "can't" do it. Upper level "won't let them"
---
You saying Modus ain’t legit?  I mean, he’s a bit creepy and probably malevolent, but he always seems honest.

Because I'm a grown ass woman and don't need to get assaulted in the ear by random squeakers following me around yelling and asking if I have any springs.

Wait, what planet are you on? lol
---
Interested to hear more about this guild. 
---
Employee 1: it'd be nice if we could just wipe everyone's inventory to fix this duping bs
---
Employee 2: yeah but we'd never get that approved 
---
Employee 1: lol we could say we're removing duped items and "accidentally" wipe out all inventories
---
Employee 2: lol it'd be a bug
---
Employee 1: yes... Just a bug :)
---
Is that like the not a true Scotsman fallacy.  
---
I actually won’t be too heartbroken if my TSE shotgun disappears. I got an instigating pump yesterday from the vendor in Artisan’s Corner that kicks the crap out of it. 
---
This is necessary and a good sign. Get the pace up and the face might be salvageable.
---
its called Europe and we are already down for maint
---
If you’re running an actual bloodied built it far surpasses anti-armor. 50% damage reduction is only  like 25% more damage, per the FO4 damage reduction formula. 
---
Because those are two wholly different groups. 
---
The crowd using duped items was quiet while everyone else complained. Now we'll new quiet while they complain. It's not people suddenly changing their minds. 
---
Ah lol, thought that might be it.
---
What if in doing so, they accidentally cause "Super Duper" not to proc anymore? 
---
I'd agree if it wasn't for the fact that the playerbase is dwindling with every passing day. the target audience you speak of were mostly never really Fallout fans and have already moved on. only the actual fans (and some stragglers) remain.
---
so either cater to your actual playerbase or just kill the game outright by releasing stupid shit nobody asked for, like survival servers.
---
Unless you paid little to nothing for them, it’s unlikely. They spawned at vendors for a long time for low level guys, so people were using alts to go buy them from the vendors they spawned at, server hopping to collect as many as they could.
---
A bunch of shit will be deleted that shouldn't have been. 
---
Also, all of us unknowingly using duped camp items will be pissed.
---
I gathered the codes the intended way the first time, just for the experience, but I didn't bother trying to decode them 😂
---
I love all of the 'innocent' players running around in full sets of Unyielding Sentinel armor who are victims who feel they should be able to keep their duped gear.
---
If it’s damage is energy, yes 
---
Well... that does sound fun - after all, it *would* be kinda interesting to try out all the different flavors. 
---
But that’s the perspective of my character, who always wears a red dress, black bowler hat, and pair of stylish bottlecap sunglasses she made from the proceeds gained murdering the poor schmucks who accidentally nicked a generator defending somebody’s workshop. 
---
Me? I spent one bill of pre-war money on this game, and I want it to be a good investment. 
---
How much for the *shit, it’s not bloodied is it..? Hope it’s not duped is it..?
---
Yeah looks like it was removed, sucks bro. It was pretty funny too. Kinda needed on this sub. 
---
Same head cannon as with Dark Souls.
---
All the players who quit the game before finishing, or even after finishing the game simply went hollow. 
---
Why does Beth needs to remove dupe items when they already render TSE useless? Wouldn't it be riskier for them to accidentally mess things up again?
---
Go Melee or go home.  It’s what the game devs want.
---
^Anxiety
---
So wait, if I bought a weapon from someone not knowing it's duped (though I just assume they all are), I'll lose it and still be out of my caps?
---
Why did I pay so much for a tse gauss rifle to replace the normal one I had?  Chances are every damn tse weapon is duped except for maybe 2% of them that originated them all...
---
Jesus, **are we sure they're not just going to delete all tse weapons in the game then eradicate our junk?**  I bought a bunch of screws and ballistic fibers from someone who clearly duped them (who has 15k of any of those??) and used all my caps at the time to buy 200 of each of those, are those going to disappear on me too?  I'm pretty sure my current stack of ballistic fibers sitting at 200 still is mostly from farming Fort Defiance as repairing my armor blows through them fast.  Why did I pay caps for them just to have the developer swoop in and take them away?  Is the 5k .45 ammo some random guy dropped going to disappear on me?  Am I going to log in to my best weapon, all the ammo for my other gun, and my junk to repair my stuff all gone? Am I really going to play this game?
---
I didn't even play this game while these duping exploits were rampant, why tf do I need to effected in a negative way?
---
I really hope come tomorrow my kamehameha gun isn't lost to cyber oblivion, if it is along with my ballistic fibers and screws and ammo for my other gun, I might seriously put this game down for a long, long time.  I didn't exploit for those, I played this damn game, grinded for the caps, and spent them on this stuff that now might be purposefully taken away because someone else acquired them illegitimately.
---
Why did I pay $60 for this game?  Just why...  This is like being in an abusive relationship.  I try so hard then everything good gets taken away and I'm left just wondering why.
---
&gt;acquired duped items from other players
---
It's right there bud. This is called trading.
---
Kill the source. That’s the logical thing to do. With the TSE nerf, the weapons don’t command the price they used to either so they’ll fall out of favor as people switch to OP melee or bloodied builds. 
---
So what you're saying is yo'ure a dumbass. Got it, thanks for the heads up
---
I didn't know there were 2. So one is Brotherhood of Steel and the other one is an independent dealer? 
---
Im wondering what guns will disappear. I hope none. 
---
They said they're looking at a small number of items this time, so my guess is since they're not simply looking for accounts to ban this time they're not looking at item quantities of useful semi-rare items, just of very rare items. They're just looking to delete stuff to get piles of rare legendaries off the market before their PvP servers go live. They are going to let people bring their old characters to the PvP servers, but since you can lose your guns and armor nobody is going to want to bring their only copy of a rare item and get it taken in combat.
---
Damn impressive collection. 
---
And here I sit farming technical data trying to get the t60 paint. Haven't even dreamt of trying to grind for a jetpack yet. Lol
---
Better buy a few boxes of tissues before you log in tomorrow.
---
TSE Gauss and TSE Handmade. How fucked am I? 
---
Stop complaining about the fucking nerf.   Fucking broken records. Nobody cares. No you can blast through the game. One shotting everything cry us a river. 
---
Cool hmu for a chat when u can...on now.
---
^These feels honestly. A few weeks back I bought a 2* Grognak axe from The Whitesprings trader out on the tracks with the only 2 legendary traits I wanted. Executioner and +40% power attack dmg, nothing crazy but slowly has become a main for me. I thought I was extremely lucky ( I don't own any TSE weapons/ have Never had one drop or for sale) unfortunately if I recall it was I think the night before a patch and dupers could've just been trying to cut thier loses in the hysteria.
---
They're taking the server offline to do this. It's not something they can casually do. 
---
WoW, for example, will let you restore deleted items right from their website. You can just login and see a list of literally anything you've deleted in the last two or so months and pick what you want to restore. 
---
Bethesda does not have the engine to do this. It just won't happen. 
---
I know right! They don’t realise that they are part of the problem. If people weren’t so desperate for these items paying in game and real life cash then it limits the reasons why someone would want to dupe. I’d rather gain rare items through hard work than take the easy way which might be illegitimate. They’re just being naive to think Bethesda wouldn’t catch on. 
---
Individual servers shutdown for maintenance occasionally. It's not necessarily a global shutdown.
---
Subjective opinions don't have weight. The pump is the worst way to get dirty water. By all means, use Google to look up fancy words to put your opinion.
---
I can't wait for those posts. /S
---
How do you know they were duped?  A lot of people have the plans to make them. 
---
"so sad, people are duping and everyone have explosive double shot weapons! Bethesda is killing this game". 
---
Bethesda nerf weapons. 
---
"omg I quit this game, Bethesda is wrong!".
---
Bethesda remove dupped items. 
---
"stop this Bethesda, you are going to loose your players!"
---
Kind of mad attitude, no? 
---
Passionate? Right. Because making an artsy CAMP is the point of the game.
---
Well that gives me a bit of relief. Paid somewhere in the ballpark of 1.3k caps, which I think is what they were going for at vendors before the level lock was removed. 
---
Okay. "There you go bitching like a bitter male virgin that can't get laid even though he's such a 'nice guy' " . Better?
---
Oh well, if my TSE was duped I still have a good enough weapon I know for a fact isn't.  I stabbed a legendary glowing something to death for it because my TSE had broken lol
---
Thnx

PC
---
Lmao! Cue the VHS tape. 
---
I can use them to wipe the tears from laughing at how stupid your comments are
---
You stop that. 
---
Funny. B/c you're the poster you think this 'trick' is efficient? By all means tell yourself that. You mistake me for some fragile Leftist liberal who gets 'hurt by words'.
---
Happy to entertain.
---
Who’s complaining? I don’t use anything affected by the nerf so I really don’t give a fuck. My whole point was I’d be more pissed about losing something I put 50 hours of game time into than something I put 15 minutes of work pay into.
---
No you couldn't op. 
---
Say goodbye to your whole inventory, because bethesda.
---
I'm gonna open up a pawn shop tomorrow. Can't wait to see what people have left to trade. 
---
All my weapons were my own pulls so it should effect me. Here's hoping, mates.
---
long man bad
---
Only slightly 
---
Oh this is gonna be good. I can’t wait to hear and watch videos on the 782 other things they fuck up in the process. Yesssss! 
---
Before the level lock was removed I think they were around 500c each.  
---
This is the worst mod for Fortnite.
---
This, bought a tse combat shotgun (and got it to -6 range with a short barrel giving it nigh infinite range) and the guy gave me two more tse shotguns cause they didn't like them, I sold one for 350 caps, still have the other one (wouldn't mind that getting removed cause it actually sucks and no one wants it unless it's free), but then I came upon a person with a tse gauss rifle and literally begged for it and gave them all my caps at the time.
---
I love that gauss rifle, I *sleep while cuddling this huge gun*, it's *my friend* and has helped me a lot.  It was worth the caps and now I'm left with anxiety waiting for my stuff to disappear...
---
Take the two shotguns, but leave my gauss alone :(
---
Misleading title, you did play the game. Don't post misleading titles, this is some drama queen nonsense. 
---
Where is it? I’ve been looking for it for a while now
---
Bethesda made post saying they remove duped items. 
---
Ya, the train station is independent.  I think its caps stash is linked with Grahm's, but that it.   
---
You mentioned that you go to 4, but there are 7 cap pools, is the other one you are missing harpers ferry or the enclave?
---
post hog
---
I'm happy and legitimately scared my lawfully acquired TSE 50 Cal will be taken from me. Got it from a random protectron in the wild, all my luck on that one gun.
---
Just scared itll get swept up in the purge.
---
Well, at least now I dont have to worry about my TSE being a glorified paperweight now... 
---
No thanks. Fortnite is there for that 
---
When they accidentally delete all super duper marts from the game
---
The Creation engine has the console still built into it as well as any internal dev tools they have. They could make any item they want to. It's the time and money to investigate every claim as well as creating the item and getting it to the player that they can't justify investing in.
---
I got a few free TSE weapons from a buddy a long while back. Now that I now about the duping thing, I'm completely expecting them to be gone after the update and I'm not bitter. These items weren't meant to exist (the dupes I mean). 
---
&gt; Or maybe you should have waited for Fallout 5 because you are clearly not into multiplayers. 
---
So I have to wait until 2020-2021? 
---
Did you miss Exploding AND the Explosive perk got nuke nerfed into the dust during the TSE nerf?
---
Apparently you haven't met the Fun Police.
---
Nap200000 meet Bethesda, Bethesda meet Nap2000000
---
Oh now that you've met..........they're going to ask you what you want, and do the exact opposite.
---
FML I thought I was a fanboy.  I guess there are evolutionary schisms of different fanboys.
---
p.s.  I used to see nukes go off ALL the time.  I even had another group I tagged around with that shot nukes NONSTOP for hours.  Server hopping, nuke nuke nuke, server hopping.  They don't play anymore.  The Fun Police got them! 
---
You lost 18000 caps the second you bought it for such a ridiculous price lol 
---
Damn well thats good
---
Oh great, as if teaming up wasn't difficult enough already.
---
Though I thought they'd have to leave the server to give the workshop, do you mean it works like that? 
---
It might work without, haven't tried it myself, by making the new player as team leader, then leaving the team. Still seems very odd if it were to work like that.
---
Not true, alt accounts acting as bank accounts pretty much give people all the caps they'll ever need, not an endless supply but 75k caps is *a lot* of caps.
---
Those were found pre-nerf and was great weapons until I was able to buy TSEs.  The important part was that they were powerful and I knew their provenance. 
---
In the words of Tidus...
---
[Ahahahahahahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H47ow4_Cmk0)
---
Yeah, why not?
---
I do know most people don't, I often spam team invites to no avail, but Im still left to wonder why that kind of action is so consistent. 
---
It's not like there's a huge amount of other players sending team invates out there, since Im not getting any.
---
Top tier comment
---
I’ve been subbed in two for a while and see tons of shit being sold that’s not “top tier”. Go ahead and act like you know everything because you trade a bit, even when you’re wrong.
---
If anyone expected to keep all the duped items, whether they bought it or duped it themselves, they weren’t using their brains. Blame dupers for it, at least Bethesda is fixing the problem when people like you just want them to keep the dupes in the game because it’s a slight inconvenience to you if they fix it. It’s a game, if it’s not fun to play it and earn rare items how they were meant to be earned, quit. It’s that easy.
---
Well after tomorrow, we’ll know the items for sale aren’t duped right? Good luck with that.
---
And when new dupes come out, you can say goodbye to the stuff you traded for them as well.
---
How can people be so stupid?
---
Good luck trading in the new Player Vending.  Make sure you have your "Dupe Detector" engaged.  Oh, you don't have one, well the Fun Police at Bethesda will just delete the items for you, thanks.
---
Yup.  I have a whopping two tse weapons, both acquired via trade on Reddit.  I wasn't thinking about it at the time, but I'm pretty sure they're dupes and will be gone tomorrow.  Them's the breaks 
---
ew
---
Dont care. Waiting for new content
---
Pizza pockets are only as good as the ingredients you use, and the person who makes them. 
---
Thats just how you dupe. 
---
Take take take it all but you never give. 
---
Should have known you were Trouble... 
---
true ;0
---
Why are you still powering it up if you get nothing in return?
---
I think in a year or maybe two we will get a new pvp mode.
---
RIP Phoenix. 
---
Servers have nothing to do with the dozens of bugs they have failed to fix in 3 months.   
---
That's odd. Did you learn plans from before?
---
I thought maybe you can only do it once every time you log on? If that makes sense.. apparently not lol usually I use the power for the workbench there ect 🤷🏼‍♀️ 
---
HAPPY VALENTINES DAY!!
---
Dense+Fireproof. Boom. TSEs are CQB. 
---
If you are serious about the hunt. Hit me up on ps4
---
**THEY**
---
**DO**
---
**NOT** 
---
**CARE**
---
I used to fanboy this up.  To those who got off this train before me, I'm sorry I fanboy'd as you left.  To those that shit on me now and get off later, screw you and I'll enjoy your salty tears later.
---
The Fun Police doesn't care what makes players happy.  They couldn't care less about new content.
---
Whoever is running this crap show needs to be fired ASAP.  Not re-assigned, not demoted, not transferred.........straight up balls deep FIRED.
---
I haven't seen this much incompetence in a development team since WarZ and DayZ Standalone.  If any of you guys played those hot messes, you know what I'm talking about.
---
Welcome to another of Bethesda’s famous nerfs ehrm I meant „fixes“
---
Yep! Previously 
---
Still odd. What platform are you on? 
---
Good ol Phoe-Phoe
---
PlayStation 🙂 
---
Prepare for TSE 2.0 but MUCH worse tomorrow.
---
Whoever is running this team is an idiot.
---
Just wait till I’m coming after you with my instigating shotty (assuming a duper didn’t sell it to the vendor). 
---
Then why are you even here lmao
---
Go be dumb somewhere else
---
By this logic Bethesda is guilty for creating the possibility for illegal goods to begin with.  That's called entrapment when you create a situation meant to snare innocent people.  That's illegal too.
---
I'm working a bunch this week but if you can't figure it out by Monday I'll do a run with you. Keep me posted. 
---
So no more bloodied deathclaw gauntlets?  
---
They'll probably remove all of the super duper marts also
---
If you ever traded another player ANY good weapon for ANYTHING...........oh wait, there are trading sub-reddits.
---
Glad you enjoy other people getting screwed.  I'll be here when you decide to leave.  No sympathy then.
---
Characters that used the glitch method to level up WILL BE DELETED 
---
"As an apologize player got 400 atoms - we are proud of or atom shop and think this is an appropriate equivalent"
---
They'll also remove all of the super duper marts aswell 
---
Thankyou! 
---
All this hate and no criticism??
---
I do!
---
Not tomorrow though!
---
Not trading anymore.  Not with the Fun Police deleting anything they consider a dupe.  I don't want your dupe bud!
---
It's probably to try and clear the world of the mass amount of dupes to try and level things out before the PVP servers launch. God-roll effect combos are supposed to be super rare, not something just anyone can get. I'm convinced that TSE should have been the single rarest combo and that would have justified it having such an insane advantage over most everything else but it got duplicated so much that it became near commonplace and as a result threw game balance out the window. That lead to the nerf to try and level shit out. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm ready for some shit to go real sideways with the implementation of this, but I think a somewhat heavy handed approach to purging the dupes will go a long way towards legendary distribution looking like it was originally intended to.
---
He's right, you're a moron.
---
2000 is a reasonable price for a tse since the nerf but yeah expect it to go...if it doesn't thank atoms holy glow 
---
I feel the same. I've been trading like mad and if I need to go about finding new weapons and rebuilding my cap supply I'm pretty much done with the game. 
---
How much he wanted for
---
Recent list doesn’t work at all after a disconnect on PC :(
---
Hahaha if you’re on ps4 I’m down. But if I win you have to join my team 
---
Yeah, make fun of all the traders in the trading reddits.
---
Good luck trading in the future.....lol
---
Can you spot the duped item????  Do you have your detector that says DUPE DUPE DUPE when you enter the trade window?
---
Oh, you don't have one of those?  Too bad!  The fun police don't like that.  They're coming for you!
---
Player vending............hahahahahahahahahahah...........I'm not buying a single thing from your machines.  Not after they mass delete crap.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Better then ruining a multiplayer for those who love them by complainiv to Bethesda to remove multiplayer aspects from the game.
---
my exact route when it's time to farm up for shotgun shells or bulking
---
About three fiddy
---
What a shitty mentality. "Make up a narrative as to why developers of the game fucked you, and go grind more". Not everyone has the time or patience to grind in hopes of getting a god roll.
---
Ahahahaha.. Somebody is losing all his weapons tomorrow
---
I’d join anyways if you have a mic. I almost always run teamed. If you want to add, PSN is the same as here. 
---
Yep, already done.
---
Screenshot of all my stuff.
---
Pitiful stuff on my alt and bank character though. 
---
Bet I'll still be missing SOME of it tomorrow!
---
Thanks Beth!  Fun police unite!
---
Honestly, if it's god tier weapons you can probably assume 99% of it is duped. 
---
Supply and demand. Right now the prices are so high that almost no-one is willing to spend any money on Atoms to get stuff. Drop the cost of stuff, add more variety (and more actually relevant stuff instead of stupid fortnite-eque shit) and that could change to the point where they make more money because they're selling more.
---
Don't think so. There are lots of people like me who have spend many hours ingame and have some good legendaries on mules. Maybe i will make some offers on reddit after Dupe-wipe.
---
First they came for the xp exploiters, and I did not speak out—because I was not an xp exploiters.
---
Then they came for the white knights, and I did not speak out— because I was not a white knights.
---
Then they came for the TSE, and I did not speak out—because I did not own a TSE.
---
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
---
I wonder if that even disables if your teammate is away. After all most team perks don't have infinite range, they have to be around you. Why would lone wanderer be different. It could though, it's the only one which could.
---
So when someone steals from you, we'll just say 'haha suckerrr'
---
What horrible apathetic place do you live in?
---
Did you name your TSE? 
---
Can't wait to read your posts tomorrow
---
Sweet! And of course I do, nothing better than teasing people as they fail to take my scarp yard. I’ll add ya in the morning 
---
so like giant Optimus Prime?
---
Go away you battle royale rat. Go play fortnigayte
---
Are they not banning people over this shit?!
---
People would still defend this game....its "only" been 4 months. 
---
**Good luck trading after this folks!**
---
Do you have your dupe detector on?  It goes Weee woo wee woo DUPE DUPE DUPE.
---
Oh, don't have one of those?  Don't trade.  Not worth it.
---
**Why would I trade a "good" item I have for a possible "duped to be deleted later" item YOU have.**
---
And both trading sub-reddits die.  Bethesda Fun Police win!
---
&gt;Is this really the intent of the PVP system? Bored players griefing for the lulz?
---
No. Besides there's no boredom required. People do nasty things to other in spite. 
---
The game mechanics can however feed or supress those tendensies. When griefing is easy it happens more offen. When it's easy and void of disadvantages, it's worse. When it's easy and beneficial, it's worst.
---
Luckily I don't class my tse as my main weapon my trusty pipe revolver rifle is that and it has no legendary lol. I can count myself in that as I am an innocent player 
---
Cool. I’ll probably be on just before the maintenance to screenshot my inventory to see what goes away, if anything. I’m really hoping that pump doesn’t cause it’s gonna replace my TSE. 
---
Feck that shite!
---
Why do they have to be lying? It's entirely possible it previously wasn't possible for them to detect which items had been duped, but for them to have built in systems to allow them to do so since then.
---
Previously it was not something they could do, but currently they can. It's not that complicated to understand. 
---
Can you explain to me what drop table is?
---
if (item = duped)
---
     delete;
---
else
---
     delete random items;
---
I'm sorry that I bought a tse weapon because all my nonlegendary guns take 3 clips to kill a big monster with.
---
I guess I should be punished for my ignorance and greed at wanting a decent weapon so I can actually play the game more ways than 'Run away and keep shooting and stimpacking for dear fucking life'
---
Uh, take a Dumpster Fire, pour some crap in it, stir it around a lot, pour more crap in, then some more gas, then stick your face into it.
---
That's Fallout 76 right now.
---
Get to the grind. Whitesprings is about to have nukes raining on it 24/7.
---
I got my first tse weapon literally 2 weeks after the game came out when i did this event. A lv 30 tse single action revolver, sure its doesn't sound that great but it was stronger than all the weapons i had at that point. 
---
Even if there not lv 50 weapons they can still be very powerful with the right legendary effects. Although with the tse nerf my revolver is pretty much useless...
---
Thanos is gonna snap it away 
---
Just example what kind of shitshow I imagine:      
---
Stimpaks were duped by X users which got reported to Bethesda. Bethesda then realizes that Stimpaks were duped ! Simple fix: Just delete all stacked Stimpaks ! If you have just 1 Stimpak you might be fine since you're looking 'legit' - but who knows.      
---
Oh and good luck if you farmed /bought lots of junk &amp; ammo. I'm not thinking of absurd amounts like 100k+ but I bet you're suspicious just if you got 5k+ rounds of one kind.      
---
You recently traded a useful unique weapon for a weapon which may is rare but was duped just a few times? It's impossible to know since duped items have no [duped] flag (may Bethesda should have add this feature first). However, consider yourself weaponless after the purge.
---
@ecish,
---
I have to say, I agree with you here.  I grinded a ton.  Got sick of no good loot.  Traded for TSE Handmade; game got boring/easy.  Later, I got a few different guns to complete my build and honestly I stopped using the Handmade bc it was too OP.  Then they nerfed TSE and it was nice to use it again.  
---
I'm totally prepared to lose it as well as the other weapons I've traded for.  
---
Also, I'm fine with a complete wipe.  I like farming for elite gear.  The loot tables are crap, but if they alter slightly it will be fine.  I like getting it myself and using what I find.  If they wipe AND permanently prevent duping that would be the best.  Bc then if I can't find it myself I'll try to trade for it.  
---
Yea good luck, I don’t think I have any dupes but if I do I’ll find out then. 
---
Its not ment to be completed, its ment for a way to track your play time.
---
TSE minigun + One Gun Army = dead Sentinel. 
---
**Wait, there's no 4th option, you're giving them TOO MUCH credit!**
---
4.  All of the above.
---
I shouldn't be laughing, but this is just surreal.  It honestly feels like I'm in a Vault Tec experiment.  Only I'm not, and the Fun Police at Bethesda suck.
---
Because “that guy” making the calls over at Bethesda Austin is so very lonely.  He wants you to be just as unhappy as him.   
---
I'm not hopeful if I'm honest, it's the only weapon I havnt found myself and the seller had two with what I could tell had exactly the same mods on it. He could have upgraded both the same but there's more chance they were duped than that happening lol
---
It's an sql statement which is a database management language. 
---
All the data is held in things called tables so drop table mean to delete the table and * is a wild card mean match everything.
---
So the code drop table * would remove everything, there would be nothing left. 
---
Go melee, until they triple nuke nerf it.
---
Then try to trade for better weapons, until they delete all the duped weapons you might have traded for.
---
Then just uninstall.
---
Be sad.
---
You're not allowed to have it because people complained about "dupers" for poor server stability (which is laughable because its always been bad, even before the duping) and said that TSEs ruin the in-game economy, even though the people who complained the most about those guns, by their own admission, took no part in any of the trading groups. Bethesda even referred to the people complaining as "victims" which is pretty pathetic. Don't you know you're supposed to grind for new gear? You're supposed to be happy that Bethesda, in it's infinite wisdom, is removing items from your inventory even though you took no part in the duping because its better for the longevity of the game!
---
I'm going to be so upset if my Two-Shot Cryolator I bought for a themed character is gone.
---
Honestly anyone that traded for anything without considering this to be a future possibility has no one to blame but themselves.
---
If this game is ever going to be anything but a raging dumpster fire the duped items have to go. 
---
Got a 1* instigating power fist
---
Oh wow, so on consoles you can send messages to other players, not on PC, where, like, keyboards have been standard equipment since PCs ever existed.(and little before it, too) Really great work Bethesda, really great.
---
No, Beth didn't introduce that function or I would name her "Lucy"
---
I have the atom store symbol on my x-01 and t60 PA. Makes telling those 2 apart from the others nice.  
---
Exactly. If it was possible then why are they waiting until now? If it wasn't possible then, how do they know it'll work now?
---
Valentine's day is also known as singles awareness day. 
---
So they are essentially wiping all items of with specific requisites? Wouldn't that delete all legit versions of the items as well?
---
And by longevity, probably the next few months as the player base dies off and the Atom shekels aren't making enough to keep the lights on in the server rooms so they shut down this game as a "service"!
---
How is this fair though? If Bethesda gave NO WAY to see if an item is duped, how are you meant to know? How can they just take all your inventory when you traded it in game with no way to see if it was duped? This might break the camels back for me.. I only have like 2-3 guns. If they all disappear then shit... what a show.
---
I'm sure Lucy cared for you, too. 
---
You have invisible mules? Nice trick.
---
I think making bigger workshop can work little againts it. 
---
If claiming the owned workshop is only way to initialize this stealthy PvP againts it's owner far away, then they still need to pay for it when initilizing. Higher cost may cause them not to.
---
Grind? Too many clowns building their shack behind the golf club.
---
Maybe a long gap like that but I recently elected to start a 2nd avatar and got to about level 5 and threw the towel in. If you've done a good job exploring the first time around there just isn't any variation the 2nd time. The main quests is the same even if you find the parts in different orders.
---
I don't play much as it is but if they full wipe I'm never coming back. And I'll think long and hard about FO X. 
---
Nuke them, too 
---
That’s because Radworms is currently glitching Marsupial to where you jump higher than you should. So you’re going past the “no damage” point. 
---
It's the same code that scrapped your mod inventory when building.......now it scraps your duped gear.
---
That's the joke, it would remove everything, characters, items, the lot.
---
The chances of them using a database that uses sql is pretty low
---
This is going to be a Valentine's Day Massacre for us all 
---
I ran into two vender style camps within 30min. One had like 5 ppl level 2-178 hanging out. Looked that their stuff just didn't seem right so got out of there. Then ran into a level 45 that had some really crazy stuff that a level 45 should have had and the base some something else really got out of there fast. Then I jump on here and ready about the hotfix!!! Made sense that these ppl are trying to dump their dupd good fast now. I thought something fishy was going on in the wasteland today. 
---
I peed, but I laughed yesterday
---
&gt; Workshop ownership is no longer PVP, instead determined by hourly votes at all those polling places you see around everywhere. 
---
Totally  just realized the voting areas could be used to get player feedback on upcoming patches and updates. Runescape does this extremely well where players vote yay or nay on upcoming nerfs/buffs etc.
---
Since they aren't logging individual items with INDIVIDUAL ITEM CODES (which could get you those returned items when the server logs it)...........
---
.........I have an idea on how they're doing it.
---
Possibly Duped Item X, with condition bar Y, and perks A, B, and C................DELETE ALL
---
So every Super Sledge with a 100 length condition bar and Bloody, Swing Speed, and Reduced Weight............DELETE ALL
---
Repeat for everything they think was duped.  Don't bother that you might get a few legit drops with that method.
---
**Good luck trading in the future.  Make sure you're 100% certain that item isn't duped.  Make sure you have your DUPE DUPE DUPE detector on.**  Or else the Fun Police are gonna getcha later!
---
**Both trading subreddits are going to die overnight.  Player vending will be a joke.**
---
**There is no way in hell I'm going to trade my "good" item for your "possibly maybe duped and will be deleted later" item.**
---
COMING SOON THE THE ATOM SHOP! TWO SHOT EXPLOSIVE LEGENDARY WEAPONS FOR 500000 ATOMS EACH. GREAT NEWS, WE'RE ALSO ROLLING BACK THE NERF ON THESE ITEMS!
---
I get it. I understand, but knowing that I am going to wake up tomorrow and not see my lover ever again. That's painful.
---
Yes, get back to the pointless RNG ghoul slot machine grind, keep playing 76 for 7600 hours and maybe we will let you keep your stash! Make sure to visit the atom shop!
---
By this logic Bethesda is accountable for complicity in doing nothing about these glitches and letting innocent people be effected by them.  Punishing them is basically entrapment, 'we setup things so that people will purposefully do bad things, and then we punish them AND EVERYONE THAT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH ANYTHING THEY MADE.'
---
Ever hear of the ripple effect?  Everything you do ripples across life effecting others.  Why should those effected innocently be clumped in with those legitimately guilty?  Bethesda made it this way, their customers shouldn't be paying for Bethesda's mistakes.
---
Thanks, man.
---
Oh okay lol. Yeah not not a code guy. 
---
I'm just gonna be pissed because I traded my 1SE Gattling for a clan mate's 2SE. And since I've been mining Gattlings since I could first use them (Level 25?) I've got zero other guns besides my Ma Duce but I've got zero ammo for that thanks to the last SBQ fight.
---
Hand to hand I guess. 
---
Homes for humanity 
---
***DONT FORGET WERE ALSO GIVING AWAY 20 ATOM POINTS TO EVERYONE FOR FREE AS ACCOMMODATION!***
---
Checked with my wife. Can confirm.
---
I just want a skin for the excavator armour, I am not a Tonka.
---
What's disingenuous is how you think everyone has the same breaking point apparently -_-
---
That's because they nutered the game for the targeted audience from the very start with a anti-pvp low damage slap mechanic because of all the anti-grinding bitching it got from the wrong targeted audience that waved their wallets in Bethesda's face in greater mass. In March they will fix that mistake by finally giving the game the PvP servers it should have got from the very start. If you think the PvE servers will ever get to a point you want you are setting yourself for disapointment, thd game was never built on a player centered storyline they can just expand with future DLC's like they usually do in singleplayer games, this was a multiplayer game from the very start, a nutered one but a multiplayer never the less.
---
I’ll be annoyed if my gun vanished. Bought from the whitesprings station vendor.  Someone must have accidentally sold it.
---
Tree fiddy?
---
Hope someone trades you one. Good luck!
---
At least make my gun into a wall decoration for God's sake! So I can see my partner everyday in my CAMP.
---
What kind of proof do you want for "I acquired an item by legitimate means and it's gone?" I'm serious. How does someone prove that to you?
---
....now you're crossing a line in your grief. 
---
Don't taxidermy Lucy. 
---
What if the patch accidentally mess up the real "Super Duper" perk and it no longer procs?
---
That is irrelevant. Having knowledge of the existence of duping does not require players to assume that all trades for desirable items originated from illicit origins. One should not be endorsing the fact that those who committed the offense will be permitted to keep and benefit from the caps earned from duplicated goods, while any players who may have unwittingly purchased such items will be the ones punished. This will prove to be a poorly conceived and failed attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube, and will result in yet another wave of backlash. 
---
True, but they still will have a ton of data to sift anyway, they can't just sample for it. It still comes down to a full data base search for x number of key data. All stashes on all characters on all formats across the globe, and I would hope there's a few useful patches this time. I bet 2 preserved pies it takes over 3 hrs.
---
I am not worried about my account as I already told support and they told me not to.  
---
I am more worried about the fact people are getting an item that is only in the game from an exploit that don't know about it. 
---
Only If I can pay to make my super sledge look like a croquet mallet.
---
If your pubes are already shaved = Bethesda script will glue them back on
---
I would agree that a mapped out “things to come” would go a long way to resolve some of the issues and perhaps that needs to be the unifying message from the community. As someone else posted MMOs in the traditional sense do get off to bumpy starts as regardless of testing you never quite know how people are going to play the game. 
---
True, I'm only worried about 1 item, but so what. I have earned everything else legit, only bought one tse, and they nerfed it anyway, so whatever. Not worried.  Ps4 crew here
---
I feel ya
---
Race car bed becomes driveable.
---
Yeah, that would suck. At least I've got all my other legitimate Bloodied legendaries. The TSE was an outlier to my build, so losing it wasn't going to hurt me too much. Still though, it was such a nice weapon to have. 
---
Lol. Should be fun
---
I'd be OK with losing my junk and levels, but not my learned plans!  ;)
---
I saw this post when it went up. I didn't get it either lol. Thanks for asking. 
---
The fact that your flair is Order of Mysteries makes this post even more fantastic. Like they aren't a league of kickass assassins. They are just tinfoil hat wearing lunatics questioning their reality.
---
I know I’m not gonna stay up and wait for them to come back online this time.  I’m sure it will take a long time to do it if they don’t take a half-assed approach like wiping out all TSEs or something. 
---
Did all those capitalized words work? I've always wondered if that works.
---
Hey the more you know right lol? And no problem :)
---
Well #1, entrapment's not illegal in many places and #2 wow you're drawing a realllly long bow on that one.  The car can do 240kph so it's not my fault I killed a kid on a crossing while speeding.   BMW entrapped me!  Really your argument is a joke.
---
Ok try this take one step back and look at all that's happend if you look at each decision made so far the nerfs the bans the blunders its almost as if. Here it comes some one asked what could we do to just end all this bad press and scrap fo76? And it would seem like everything that could be done IS being DONE to divide the player base and drive us to quit.  That's all. I was a game master of AD&amp;D as well as other games played with dice pencil and paper. I have run campaigns lasting over half a year and all my players could seem to talk about was what they would do next session. Balance can be tricky at times I know but after about level 40 fo76 lacks anything like real game balance. To set a world, when you put big bad things in an area you can't care if characters may die there you put rumors signs saying danger bad shit happens here and if your players go without power and without there A game they can die. Ok roll up a new character next week. And they learn to play better. If I as the GM make a mistake I have to deal with it with out a heavy hand and just taking stuff away from the players. ( see TSE guns ) if it was me I would slowly increase the resistance to explosive arms and ballistic damage to the key monsters not all of them and not to the point of making it unkillable without legendarys.
---
Balance can be achieved in several ways but to make all possible weapons do the same base damage is not how you do it. And to have melee do more then a missile or a .50 cal mg is silly at best.can a sledge hammer do as much damage as a .50 yes with a few swings but it can't match the destruction of a shoulder launched missile in a whole day of swinging.
---
The atomic shop. Should have items in it with stats for sure like armor. But nothing that exceeds vanilla items in game so only cosmetic changes to armor for a cool look or guns. Legendarys should have unique skins to set them apart if you have a super sledge cool but you know when I unlimber my ALL RISE cause you can "just see its much cooler" 
---
But each time the all mighty Bethesda updates they kill off a few more dedicated players.
---
With the wrong play EVERY TIME. Not a bad one now and then but EVERY TIME.
---
Record speaks for it self we won't be happy till we can shut this mistake down.
---
I would love to be wrong. I love fallout and this game rocks to a point but then it doesn't anymore.
---
My friends an I have had lots of fun despite the problems we loved to play here but the heart of the game has been stolen by its creators. 
---
PS. For every asshat and tard I had the misfortune to encounter I met at least 4 that were there for others. And for all of you who help other players I tip my hat to you.
---
I think their algorithm to detect duped items is something related to the legendary effects and not item IDs, resulting in people losing their legit items with either Ts or E items. Like I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose my E dragon 
---
Visit the atom shop, but don't spend your atoms?
---
So what about guys who did in game trades for items? I bought plenty things in trades how would i know if it's duped or not when I bought it? It's a bit shit on guys who thought they were buying legit.
---
Y'see
---
hell if my plasmagat could make it through one fucking reload, I'd settle for that. 
---
Screwing around.. I see what you did there!
---
&gt; Where he’s going is that Bethesda admitting they cannot see player inventory.
---
Because they didn't have the tools at the time.
---
Those times have changed.
---
Always have Starched Genes equipped &gt;unless you're actively trying to get mutations&lt;. That's what you meant right?
---
Inn and btw the mysterious questline may not be broken if your having issues with advancement my friend had an issue he just had to go thru the terminal slowly and hit every prompt if you don't the quest stalls out he got it to work tho
---
In other news, players banned for exploiting a loophole that allows duplication of water from pumps!!! xD
---
Innocent like they shouldnt take action against your account and ban you, sure.  If the item only exists because someone cheated to create it than its illegitimate and you're guilty of using an illegitimate item.  You claiming ignorance changes nothing about the facts surrounding the items creation and continued existence.
---
The whole "hey man I just found it, I'm holding it for a friend, etc" thing sounds like everyone caught with contraband ever, ask any cop.
---
No they definitely want you to spend.
---
Stagger him
---
Eso says hi.
---
18/f/NYC 
---
Same here man. At least one person a day. Hell, bought my first tse pump shotty that way.
---
Just one more thing that don't work right shocking.
---
I want new content, not more items on atom shop, Beth!
---
I just make a toilet in the middle of their home and leave. 
---
...but we have a new neon sign! And pink metal armor! And a princess bed!!!

Looks balanced. Would work well. I wouldn't get it myself, but, I can see people doing so.
---
I'm a moron but even I understand the difference between pressing a button once and pressing a button 1000x times.
---
I’ve literally tried everything for over 3 weeks. Stuck in sugar grove, at the part where you insert the “silco holotape” ,and what’s supposed to happen is a prompt comes up about downloading the data and then you head back to the mansion. 
---
The problem I’ve had is I’m not able to download the data. Everything time I go to insert the holotape on the main screen I scroll all the way to the holotape and nothing happens. I’ve tried relogging, having different quest parts on and off, the uniform on  and off, friends with the same quest part to do it, and nothing works. Like I said I’ve talked to support different times within 1-2 weeks and both times they said they couldn’t help me.
---
With this announcement they can just go in and remove items and add items (theoretically), it’s kind of a punch to the face because while support prob couldn’t of helped they could have moved it for a developer to take a look. Instead they have repeatedly said to “look forward to future updates when we can address the issue” and “we can not interact with any players accounts, these issues may be addressed in the future.”

I'm Erek. I'm FROM Nova Scotia, but I live in the southern US. I'm 19 and I work as a projection manager at a theatre, my first game that introduced me into the Fallout series was Fallout 3 on the PC I picked up at a retailer ( play &amp; trade ) for around 3$ and I ended up playing it so much it melted the plastic fins around the heatsinc off of my Toshiba laptop I had for about 4-5 years. I am absolutely whipped by Fallout series in a total. I'm big into competitive FPS games now, but I always find myself setting up a new play through of whichever wasteland I want to roam through for a tenth time.

Reminds me of the buried robot in Kaliningrad (https://imgur.com/a/4fYyOpy).
---
Joke's on you, I quit three months ago.
---
Lmao. Literally most of what you do on Reddit is complain about this game. Weird hobby. 
---
What do you mean??
---
I mean, if you die and someone grabs your booty...aren't you just kinda out of luck?
---
They're removing everything duped tomorrow. I would certainly recommend holding off on any player purchases until after 9:00 AM EST
---
Barn materials are easier to find than fortress materials in a nuked out world.
---
Enjoy your downvotes.
---
As in real life, cooking food doesn't totally get rid of radiation.  You mainly want to cook your food so you don't get diseases and so it lasts longer.
---
I think he meant he'll actually have something to use as a gun. I got my first 3* gun the other day so I'm set
---
Finally our lord Todd will smite the wrongful.
---
*cough cough* get lead belly dumbass *cough cough*
---
How do we know it doesn't? I've certainly never tried.
---
And why is it default in survival mode?
---
Heavy weapons basically. I've always shredded her by bringing along 5 or 6 Gatling plamsa
---
Y'all need Marie Kondo in your life
---
That would be very difficult to proof. 
---
It would certainly help your case if you could at least proof you actually had items removed by Bethesda. A few weeks back we had a ban wave for dupers and naturally a bunch of threads here from people claiming they were innocent but got banned anyway. 
---
Yet none of these people that i've seen could even proof they got banned in the first place, let alone banned wrongly. There are simply people out there looking to cause drama.
---
That is the point i am making. This sub is going to be flooded with people, both guilty and innocent, claiming they've been wronged. 
---
However since no one here can possibly make that distinction don't count on much in the way of sympathy. 
---
If you can't even proof you got targeted, expect to be viewed with suspicion.
---
Fallout 4 has you cook rads out. I just would really rather not have to spend perk points on lead belly. I want to punch people's heads off instead.
---
I like this post but must say, the internet is very much finite.
---
So very, very finite v-v
---
Would that be such a bad thing? All the easier to uninstall and never look back.
---
They don’t have to do everything the same as 4
---
If you haven’t noticed they’ve made quite a few big changes
---
yes! I have the same feeling. I wonder if my All Rise gets deleted. It must be duped! A lof people have it. hahah
---
I haven't gotten that far in the actual story for the enclave underground bunker. Been doing a lot of Whitesprings farming to get to level 72, finally going into the story now. I'm pacing myself enough to not run out of actual game to play. 
---
No they don't, but it would make surviving easier.
---
Glad it worked for ya'!
---
Ya sounds like the typical party line. I'm sorry its not working have you run a different character thru it?
---
Or a bumble bee. 
---
What typ are you? Ps4 box or pc?
---
There are a few in flatwood i think
---
And next week they are going to remove levels from your characters because you have farmed whitesprings while the ghouls gave a lot of xp! 
---
Don't know if you ever found the answer but I was wondering the same thing today. Did some testing and its character based. I went to the same train station with two seperate characters on the same account and was able to sell 200caps worth of goods on both characters. Until today i always thought it was account based. 
---
Nice gesture from them. 
---
Whenever ill join a team i go to their base and write with the Neon Letters: "Send Nudes" on a Wall. 
---
;)
---
Nope because each has a unique item code
---
Honestly, I did research on what was heavily duped and what wasn't, I purchased from people that seemed to be trustworthy, but you never know. And I'm more than willing to lose the gear I bought from others for duped items to be gone (this was implied in the first post). If its gone its gone, you seem angrier about my trades than me, which is interesting.
---
I think I would be content with 900. 
---
Good strategy actually 👍 I too was around 70 before I went in to the last several quests. I enjoyed the game and the story lines a ton and took my time to read the terminals and holotapes. I've still not completed everything and I'm at 120ish now. 
---
Jokes on you, quitters never win.
---
Why buy a game with certain mechanics if you want to bypass them?
---
Never traded with a player, haven't kept anything picked up off the ground. Do have a couple good legendaries from vendor bots...according to BGS's post, those should be 100% safe.
---
I’m more of a Truncate Table kind of guy. 
---
I think people have way too high expectations.
---
I have two weapons that may go poof but still have a couple of decent weapons to fall back on.
---
The ballache will be re-speccing my character over the next however many levels.
---
Oh well at least the danger of blowing my pc up in close quarters combat goes away as well if they do go lol.
---
Yes if you drop TSE it would drop All of them poof
---
&gt;in-game economy
---
&gt;guns sell for like 4 caps
---
But then, so is everything.
---
They'll just say they wont
---
When you launch a nuke, you will be met with a countdown that, upon reaching zero, will result in all the jukeboxes and radios playing Country Roads in the world. No nukes. Just more country roads.
---
Have still yet to see proof this actually happens.
---
&gt;Then why are you even here lmao
---
what does that have to do with anything I said?
---
&gt;go be dumb somewhere else
---
funny that *you*'re telling me that.
---
And when it wasn't initially, it didn't have mtx. 
---
It shows how rushed this game was 
---
Only the cnd changes with the kids done to a gun if you add a silencer Cnd change add or change a mag cnd change new stock etc.
---
400lb of junk items from a wanted player. Another 100 from his buddy who was dumb enough to attack me after watching his buddy get painted across the walls. 
---
For the life of me I don’t understand how people carry around so much crap. I ended up having to craft a crapload of ammo to stash it. 
---
Oh God...
---
1. Eventually you can put the Shrouded mod on it, although you don't really need the stealth bonuses in this game. It does have pretty good ballistic resistance for the weight though.
---
2. I imagine it changes the damage rate rather than preventing you from being set on fire.
---
3. Anglers spawn in rather large quantities considering the toughness of them. I assume that was Grafton Steel. Dabney Homestead is also tricky for the same reason, although at least it's not Scorchbeasts that never land.
---
Preemptive complaining. Nice.
---
You have had two chances to reply and instead you have deflected twice.
---
ok is it just the mole miners cause i know for a fact i have killed lvl 40 legendaries and gotten up to lvl 50 items from them
---
Your point 2 is fucking moronic. There are hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of duped items floating around. That won't ever "filter out".   
---
Because people are \_using\_ those weapons. People don't want to trade off that duped gun they paid \_actual fucking cash\_ for. 
---
Spoiled meat
---
Because radiation is a chemical impurity not biological. It’s the same reason you can’t cook out botulinum toxin, though radioactive isotopes will be far more sturdy under heat than organic toxins. 
---
I will have a day or two of mourning for my likely lost weapon then get on with re-speccing my pc away from explosives.
---
you are absolutely right. the poor people are those who have bought an legendary for caps or even real money. they won't get their money/caps back. 
---
One duper might have sold items to 1000 others. the 1000 are fucked now. I am pretty sure that a high percentage of the 1000 are going to quit/pause the game.
---
I am not sure if Bethesda only did a critical hit on FO 76 or if it was already the fatality move.
---
&gt;think a lot of the duped TSE's are going to remain. I have a feeling only accounts sitting on more than one will be hit. I think they're running a script that looks for certain items in quantities that exceed probability of them being generated legitimately.
---
We'll have to wait and see but the article specificially says that also "acquired" duped items also will be wiped, so we're not talking about only purging large stashes. And then it's most likely the TSE will be primary on the 'list'.
---
If, as I've always suspected, the trading economy is built entirely on dupes... and if you are knowingly, happily trading with dupers? \_YOU ARE THE PROBLEM\_. Don't let the fucking door hit your ass on the way out. 
---
That is 2^32 - 6 glass.
---
The only item I'm eyeing a little suspiciously is my two-star automatic grenade launcher (bonus damage to ghouls and extra limb damage) which I got from some twelve year old kid. Kids are dumb and impulsive and it's easy to imagine him buying it from a duper and then giving it away when he realized it's not what he hoped it would be. Even if I do lose it, I can easily craft a regular one for myself so it's not a huge loss. 
---
All the rest of my legendaries are stuff I picked off of enemies I killed, so I'm unconcerned with respect to those. 
---
They are removing SOME of the duped items. If you have duped items in your inventory they “may” be removed. 
---
This will delete about 90+% of all TSEs.. They should switch back the TSE to it's old state with the patch than.. Anyway I think many will leave afterwards again and maybe some will not be found or non-duped items will get deleted. We will see.
---
&gt;That's because they nutered the game for the targeted audience from the very start with a anti-pvp low damage slap mechanic because of all the anti-griefing bitching it got from the wrong targeted audience that waved their wallets in Bethesda's face in greater mass.
---
that's not what happened. fact is, Bethesda intended this game to be played however **we** wanted; solo, with friends or competitively.
---
another fact is that the playerbase, despite their intended target audience, couldn't care less about anything other than the former.
---
&gt;In March they will fix that mistake by finally giving the game the PvP servers it should have got from the very start. If you think the PvE servers will ever get to a point you want you are setting yourself for disapointment, the game was never built on a player centered storyline they can just expand with future DLC's like they usually do in singleplayer games, this was a multiplayer game from the very start, a nutered one but a multiplayer never the less.
---
again, says you. their decisions, such as "neutering the multiplayer", show otherwise. and skirmish all you want, competitive players will always be second class citizens in Fallout 76. either they start catering to their actual playerbase, instead of trying to reach one that doesn't even exist, or the game will be dead even faster.
---
or do you honestly think come march everyone will flock to the pvp servers and the playercount will double, triple? because you'd be even more delusional than you claim me to be.
---
I'm actually pretty sure it says nobody heard of/from it till then. I believe the idea is that this is some of the lore
---
I'm sorry sir, Apex Legends is down the hall by the coffee machine. I think you'll find what you want there.
---

Duping has made the multiplayer part of the game pointless. They have already deleted legit gear according to some posts like logging in to find stash empty. I could not agree with you more regarding duped items. It's hot gear, it needs to go. Sucks if you are the current owner, but you shouldn't have it anyway, as it doesn't really exist. Be mad at the person who sold you the hot gear.
---
Dude, I got a Bloodied + 40% Swing Speed + 1 Strenght max level Rolling Pin. It's a toddroll, so better don't mess with me.
---
Rock that pink, pink's my favorite color and I do rock the pink pipboy, I just worry it makes my sneaking less sneaky. (Not really but I rp this game for extra fun).
---
I see this argument all the time.  It's the same reason I might buy a favorite Pizza from a favorite Pizza place, then pick off the mushrooms.  Because not liking 1 thing doesn't mean the whole thing is garbage.  
---

I thought maybe heat would weaken the bond...or accelerate the decay. I'm not sure what I'm trying go say. I just thought cooking would make it safer.

---
You're probably preaching to the wrong choir here bud.
---
Soooo who's the pot and who's the kettle?
---
I earnestly hope you're right, but I doubt it. 
---
Easier isn't the point
---
You know what's going to be a laugh, if the original duper of the TSE handmade sold his original and is left with nothing after losing his dupes.
---
But i have to hand it to Bethesda, first with the inventory limit, now with the purge, they don't beat around the bush. In other games this stuff is handled much more delicately as they are afraid to lose (paying) players.
---
A protest sign lasts longer then a 200% 3* Grognaks, WTF
---
Persistent servers where what we build as a group actually matters. 
---
Says logic. They each provided a +100% boost in damage, the only other legendary effects that strong are instigating and maybe bloodied. One of which is useless in most non-solo play, and the other requires you to be at 20% health to be effective. 
---
The only potential downside to a TSE weapon is that you mess up and shoot a ghoul that's in your face. There was never a situation in which they weren't the absolute best choice. 
---
TSE was in no way the only counter for scorchbeasts, assaultrons and gutsies. They were just an overpowered option for people who wanted to melt everything like butter. 
---
That's just a glitch, not actual things in his inventory.
---
ditto
---
Found the lazy person who bought dupped weapons for real money
---
Different chemicals break down at different temperatures. The byproducts of many food borne bacteria (the dangerous toxins they produce) sometimes can’t be cooked out without making the food inedible. With regards to radiation, it may accelerate its decay, but if it’s for a half life measured in years, good luck. 
---
Did what I could about the vote lol
---
I’m assuming the servers going down to do whatever their doing must be for a reason.
---
Here's a *few* things I'd like added for my CAMP.
---
Bed &gt; Caskets, Coffins, Sarcophagi (and the ability to change the colors of existing bedding)
---
Chairs &gt; Gurney, Thrones, Wheelchair
---
Crafting &gt; Black Cauldron (Cooking)
---
Floor Decor &gt; Animatronic Skeleton, Body Bag, Gargoyles, Gravestones, Guillotine,  Mannequins, Mounted Skeletons (both male and female, different poses. Reading the note at Braxson's Quality Medical Supplies should unlock recipes), Stocks, Suit of Armour, Taxidermy Mounts, Trophies, Urns
---
Flowers &gt; Too many to list
---
Food &gt; Cranberry, Pumpkin, Stilt Bean (and other crops we can't yet plant)
---
Knicknacks / Decorative Junk &gt; Yes. (especially skullls and those jarred specimens at morgantown airport) 
---
Lighting &gt; Jack O'Lanterns
---
Misc &gt; Arcade Cabinets (playable), Bobblehead Display, Flower Baskets &amp; Pots (usable), Magazine Display,
---
Planter Boxes, Port-A-Diner, Power Armor Display, Pristine Vending Machine (Fallout 3), Radios, Speakers, Tape Deck (Can be used to broadcast holo-tapes inside your camp), Work Terminal, Working Refrigerator, 
---
Tables &gt; Embalming Table
---
Turrets and Traps &gt; Hanging Chains, Laser Wall Turret, Raider Spikes, Wall Turret
---
Walls &gt; Junk Walls, Stone Walls 
---
Wall Decor &gt; Gargoyles, Seasonal Decorations (Mostly Halloween.)
---
Water &gt; Bathroom Sink, Kitchen Sink, Water Fountain, Whitespring Sulfur Water Fountain
---
At least they fixed server stability, finally. Won't be any servers going unstable when a large portion of people drop out due to poor content and nerfed/removed weapons. 
---
Then what the fuck could have possibly changed?  If they didn't have the ability before then I struggle to imagine how the suddenly have the ability to backtrack on it and achieve that information.  It's bullshit.
---
when you can't fix the bug, fix the description or call it a feature
---
I’m certain I’m right for JUNK, though I’ve mostly only bought violet flux and it’s always been on believable quantities. Only one I thought was suspect was a large purchase of bulked plastic. 
---
I mean, they could've learned since then.
---
Think the continuous erosion of peoples faith in the competence of Bethesdas ability to actually fix things is what's resulting in the uproar. 
---
Magic.bat this point people expect Bethesda to be magic
---
How do you quit buying duped items, short of not buying anything at all?
---
I was unaware that 200% Grognak Axes existed. I thought Weapon Artisan was bugged for that item. 
---
I'll bet 5 Preserved Pies it actually works, it just works.
---
It's just that I'd rather be healed than to have my health lowered by food. Especially when I'm busy worrying about monsters.
---
How do you lock them?
---
And to think it could have been rm -r * during the dev process instead... Oh well.
---
My stash is full, so i kill because i am cannibal, not for junk.
---
Yeah, most people don't get great legendaries. I've put...I don't even know, a hundred plus real world hours into farming legendary zones and my best gun was sold by someone to a vendor because it wasn't god-tier. 
---
And like...there's no quest path here. There's no factions to side with. There's no branching story line, no different factions. 
---
You'd be hitting the same path to the same goals. 
---
Kinda funny that we're talking about realism in a game that really has no science behind it.
---
Found the dupper/lazy idiot who paid real money for weapon.
---
That sounds like something they would bundle with that red metal fireplace in the Atom store. Maybe with a disco mirror ball and a pink spotlight? 
---
Hell yeah! 💖 yeah my concern too😂 and that I wear a drifter outfit so maybe it will look a little weird but 🤷‍♀️ it’s gonna match my hair at least😍
---
The WTF that comes over voice chat when you “execute” a player that doesn’t know its possible is hilarious. 
---
Yeh I'm not saying your not Its just a conflicting world atm fallout 76 hard to believe alot of people  sorry and good luck to you mate 😀
---
"innocent players".
---
If you buy a ferrari to a guy in the streets for 5k, it's stolen, and you know it.
---
You're not innocent.
---
Well they don't have to deal with bugs &amp; crashes once they quit playing FO76 :/       
---
I played for nearly 1000 hours now. I'll check whats left after Purge but I guess this is the last straw. Oh and I'm sure they're still be ways for dupers to dupe after Patch. So yeah, what's the point then? People buy their weapons back from.. guess whom? yeah right, dupers. May this cycles a few times till nearly all lost their patience and quit.
---
But...! There's *one* they fear!
---
What I’m expecting.. is more of these preemptive whining posts.
---
Wait, what, I need to take a closer look at the robot hacking perk if this is true, I'll take a gutsy over a deathclaw for home defence.
---
Affecting everyone is not the current observed effect. 
---
I've been on servers with dupers running around with TSE. I've never been attacked by them. They're usually content with attacking enemies (that respawn rather quickly), and when I join in, they let me take the first shot before they clean house. We're all happy. And that's on the rare occasion I run across them.
---
Most of the time, I'm on my own or with my friends, hunting through the game with the very rare run-ins with people.
---
So nice theory. In actual application, it doesn't impact anyone. 
---
What does impact everyone is the server disconnection, which occurred throughout the entire game since Beta, but got worse with each iteration (even after the supposed anti-dupe code went into effect). Or the scorchbeast non-stop spam attacks. Or the glitchy behavior that causes PA failures or weapons to not do damage. Or bugs re-returning to the world. 
---
I mean, sure, that'ed be great, and I could even kinda see farming that up on an alt for a main, but.. the main quest is the problem for me. 
---
Well my post history would disagree with you. It's clear I spent caps. But you know, it's easy to just fall back on lazy arguments.
---
Have my upvote, you deserve the karma. 
---
Ive modded all my guns and armor sold them to a vendor and bought them back, can only cross fibgers at this point
---
One sale is authorized.  Bethesda offering their own created clothes, skins, etc.
---
The other sale is not authorized.  Bethesda did not give permission for their intellectual property to be sold, and it's actually against their TOS.  So, Bethesda has every right to delete items created through exploitation and ban the exploiters.
---
So the dupers got their legitimate items trading. But it's those who happened to trade for duped stuff that gets punished?
---
It's like all the nonsmokers paying the hospital bills for the smokers. 
---
Flawed game and game that has been possessed by the spirit of pestilence are two different things. 
---
I herd u will be able to buy back your weapons in the atom shop
---
I'd give it to you for free :)
---
They can have an infrastructure up and running (game servers, databases servers, auth/hub servers, vocal servers running) but lack the tooling to do so.  
---
It's nothing new the game was rushed and released with major issues.  
---
Now they have their database (with player items in it) ready to be parsed and could allocate resources to develop scripts and tools (or make sure they were reliable, do testruns on a replica of their prod environment).
---
Nice. I have been playing some Apex recently for the action kick, but like you mentioned with Fallout 3, one tends to come back to the Wasteland for adventure and exploration. 
---
Have to say it, I wouldn't miss them.
---
My name is Scott I drive tractor/trailers for a living I'm 48 this month.

Can't track how many people i killed, but 76/76 kill players with bounty challenge i have completed. People don't use voice chat much. Not even if you [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg) to them.
---
I feel confident it wont just be things that are actually duped, but even legit items that are what they believe to be commonly duped. I dont think theres any way they've devoted the man hours to actually track every single persons inventory back to its origins to find out where it came from
---
Why would you buy a pizza with mushrooms and pick off the mushrooms. It would be easier to not order the mushrooms in first place.
---
You try to call it a strawman but it is a very simple question. 
---
I almost never use PA ever since I finally amassed 5 pieces of sentinel armor. Coupled with lone wanderer 4 and I evade 95% incoming dmg. Especially useful against scorched beast who wont shut up and land 
---
Favorite it to spam eat. Favorite rad away diluted.  And dilute stim packs
---
I know that you're suggesting that, but like I said the nerfs brought them in like with the rest of the legendary effects. 
---
Instigating and bloodied are currently the strongest effects, one is useless outside solo play and the other requires you to run around at 20% health for the full boost. Even the weaker effects are situational, +50% when target is below 40% ,+30% vs a specific enemy type while Two Shot and Exploding get +25% with no special requirements.
---
True. A lot don’t. Even fewer will talk to you because the game makes it tedious to switch between team and area chat if you’re teamed and doesn’t allow you to broadcast to both at the same time. 
---
That said, on the rare occasion a player is in area chat and gets eaten without knowing it’s possible, the reaction can be hysterical. 
---
Yea then why complain about removal of duping items.
---
There is a certain irony in the fact that nobody here can tell (rightfully) who will and won't be innocent, and those innocents (honestly) couldn't tell what has and hasn't been duped.
---
This is a pretty sorry state.
---
Yeah. I think I've come to terms with it. Ive got a lot of explosive weapons I found and know wont get deleted. Its just the best ones i had to trade for which worries me. On the bright side, all the weapons sitting the bench will get to come out and play!
---
How in the hell would they know if they’ve been duped or not lol. Unless someone is carrying tons of one type of stuff. 
---
Why would you want to sell to vendors and buy them back?
---
for how many atoms? so it's pay to win now?
---
Why complain about people complaining? Your post history is full of lazy arguments like "oH DuPpeR mAd bCuz ReAl moNey!" I'm complaining because I've obtained this gun legitimately through a trade for caps.. which again, you were completely wrong.
---
Why is wooden armor in this game? 
---
Stealth!!! a full set of it, shrouded up, with the right perks, and you can literally crouch in front of an enemy, and bash them in the face, and they don't notice you are there.
---
Worst case they can afford to pay AWS to keep a few instances of the servers running. 
---
Hahahahaha, good game with the old bait and switch !!! 
---
Judgement Day is here! Atone for your sins!
---
Nope, I'll probably lose about half.   Half I spent a LOT of time trading for.  I don't dupe.  I don't have friends that dupe.  I have zero clue about the 500+ people I've traded with.
---
Good luck trading in the future though.  Hope you don't trade for dupes, only to have the Fun Police come delete them after!
---
Also good luck on Player Vending...........that's going to be a joke and a half.  If someone sees a good item in your Vending Machine, they're going to immediately think DUPE and skip it.
---
What a great way for Bethesda to REMOVE content from the game without adding content!  It's almost like they want everyone to stop playing at once.  Maybe that is the Vault Tec experiment? ;-P
---
I think only the loot will change she will now drop a note saying thanks for playing sucker.
---
That's a common glitch in component view.
---
well, its not your fault when you use the trading system Bethesda themself implemented...
---
EPIC HOMES!
---
Pretty sure it will end up being the most duped items that seemingly everyone has. Like the reduced weight  TSE Pump, 2* TSE Handmade, Bloodied explosive weapons, bloodied melees, etc. Which also prob means if someone legit farmed and got a 3* TSE Pump with the same modifiers, it's prob gonna be gone too which is not good. Unless they can tell specifically all the ones that were duped. I guess we will see tomorrow.
---
Yeah you're probably right, I'm being irrational.  I'm just frustrated that I can't just relax and play this game without having constant anxiety over how I'll get screwed over next.
---
I can't trade with anyone without thinking 'this might disappear in a later update but my caps won't return'.  I can't trade with vendors without anxiety.
---
Just tired of the constant drumbeat of wondering what will go wrong next all because bethesda can't be bothered to release a game that isn't so broken it's endgame gets reached on day 1 of release and economy gets filled with duplicated items by the first month.
---
That bmw's brakes didn't work, bmw still sold you the car saying 'but it can reach 240kph, go try it out!' You hit a kid in the process, who's at fault exactly?

The point you are missing is:  what if the pizza only comes one way, and has something on it you don't like?  What if other people eating the pizza (other players playing the game) like this one thing that you do not but otherwise you love the pizza (the game).  So yeah, you are making a strawman argument, making it seem like it can only be one way or the other, but that's obviously not true.
---
Your avoiding my question. There are only 2 people effected by this. Dupers which fuck them. And people who bought from them.
---
Now if you bought with caps and you didn't know you didn't lose much. The other is the people who paid real money. And those people F then with a big metal rod
---
Nope. Can't make heavygun any good. That would upset the status quo of melee sledgehammer overlords.
---
Move along. Nothing to see here.
---
That's the most disingenuous use of that format I've ever seen. Well done.
---
Why wouldn't you use endurance? Surely having high endurance gives you a lot more breathing space, especially if you have free perk cards
---
Creatures never drop items above their levels, only equal or bellow. Stupid mechanic.
---
&gt;A lot of assets from previous Bethesda games were re-used, certainly. But suggesting 76 is an asset flip of 4 reflects a serious ignorance of how development works - heck, even how computers work.
---
They even copied the bugs. If that's how development works, we would still live in the stone age.
---
&gt; If you think inserting netcode into the Creation Engine was a weekend task (and that's far from the only significant change they made), I don't know what to say other than "you're wrong." 
---
Never said that. But most changes they've done are highly flawed. Calling this an achievement, is insane. They can get a medal which reads: "At least you tried." but that's it. They clearly fkd up and weren't able to create a good stable multiplayer code for their game.
---
Melee!
---
Hmm im curious what will be gone after this.If everything „just works“ i should loose nothing, since I didnt dupe and i also never traded with another player. But i cant get rid of the feeling that im still going to loose stuff :D
---
I wonder if you can get another worn veil [off another member](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Young_woman) to get back in to fabricate another.
---
Hmmmm, do you have a Dupe Detector?
---
I don't.  It wasn't issued by Vault Tec when I exited Vault 76.
---
Good luck trading with ANYONE after this.  Why trade your "good" item X for their "good" item Y, only to find out item Y was duped and they'll just delete it from your account later.
---
Also Player Vending will be a joke.  If I see a good item in there, my new Dupe Detector will say NO NO NO, that's definitely a DUPE.
---
Glad we have you on board with the Vault Tec Trader Denial System.  Thanks for your cooperation!
---
You probably got it as a quest reward for completing Signal Strength. Raider Armor part plans are a once per character non-guaranteed random reward for completing that main line quest. If you want more of those plans, you'll have to create new characters and complete that quest and hope a Raider Armor part plan drops.
---
Yep!  My friends didn't quit because of nerfs, bugs, or garbage patches.  They quit because there is no CONTENT.
---
And now my final piece of CONTENT that I enjoyed ALONE........trading..........has been removed.
---
Apex Legends here I come!  I hope you're ready to open your hand for some cash, because I have unspent $$$ from Fallout ready!
---
I'm assuming probably nuka cola's, camden park tokens, etc.
---
I answered your question? I said I obtained the weapon through a legitimate trade, which is why I am complaining? Jesus, you're a simple fellow aren't you?
---
Doesn't mater it is the base CND that matters. That is recorded to the weapon as well and is what the bar's changes are based on.   
---
Just like how weapons have a base damage you can mod it with perks, mods, and chems but the base doesn't change. 
---
Not accepting random team invites isn't being asocial.
---
Yep, please enjoy your mandatory Trade Removal feature from the Fun Police!
---
Content removed is content enjoyed right!
---
Please wait while we add Player Vending............just kidding............we'll delete any items you buy that were duped there too!
---
We have ZERO handle on how to run a survival game.  We've learned NO lessons from other teams that did it.  Please enjoy our ignorance and wait for your lashes.
---
Sincerely,
---
The Fun Police
---
LOL. They’re going to be causing it!  
---
Be careful with this, boards were part of the dupe method.
---
Bethesda lies, you can get false flagged, but you won't get banned.
---
You'll just lose a couple of days while you're appealing the false flag.
---
I'm talking a few hundred boards ok, if you're crafting just a tiny amount, then it's fine.
---
took me 4 days of constant server hopping to get my longcoat...     
---
literally 20 hours of doing nothing but logging in.. checking.. logging out.    
---
I will be captain sadface if it gets removed. 
---
Keith was here first
---
How does this deal with dupers that sold all their duped stuff for caps?
---
*edit -It would be fun :D
---
 Yup, just bought one cuz I farmed forever and it never dropped
---
I mean it clashes badly with my green asylum outfit, but goes great with my hot pink hair.  It all works out.
---
Drifter outfit!  I don't even know what it looks like lol, I rocked the nuka girl outfit for a while but got tired of seeing that wicked scar on my back from what I assume was a deathclaw or yaoguai.
---
Although...  Now I have to deal with my asylum skirt clipping behind my thighs.  Hey world, LOOK AT MY PANTIESSS.  My friends just go 'ohoh, I'm blushing'.  And I'm just like 'stop looking.  Stop it.  Staahhp.  I'm a nurse not a stripper!  NO I'M NOT A STRIPPER NUR-- you know what, no more stimpacks for you.'
---
Then I pull out a suppressed gauss rifle (huge ass rifle) and just remind everyone I cuddle with it at night, because *I can't trust anyone*.
---
&lt;-&lt;
---
&gt;-&gt;
---
Looking at you, friendo, dressed as a barbarian.  We all know what your kind does!
---
I see nuke zones there practically everyday, and I normally only play a couple hours a night after work...
---
That’s interesting. What happens to the claimed workshop when reconnect back with different character. Are they sill owned by you?
---
I enjoyed reading this.
---
ready to see a lot of post, about ppl losing there full perfect 3 star unyielding sets, good time to open a pop corn shop.
---
no, the ammo
---
&gt;Prices go up either immediately after the maintenance or a few days after when valuable items actually become rare again
---
I seriously doubt that. Majority of duped items will remain ingame.
---
Hah!! This!^
---
Thankfully I am no longer playing, because doing SBQ to get that item I need with 0.000003% drop chance, no thank you! And it is not like there are millions of players who are doing SBQ and feeding the market.
---
Then your not at risk. Yet you complain about Bethesda dealing with dupers by removing their duplicated items
---
Good luck trading ANYONE for ANYTHING in the future.
---
Did you get your Vault Tec Dupe Detector?  I didn't.  Nobody did.
---
Why would you trade your "good item X" for my "good item Y" in the future, knowing the Bethesda will come in and remove my item Y from your inventory, but do NOTHING about getting your item X back.
---
Player Vending is going to be a joke.
---
Sure, laugh it up.  They just removed TRADING from the game.  How's that for new content :)
---
It's like washing dirty money by sending it through a legitimate store. He's hoping the stuff bought from bots gets new IDs that make it so the dupe detector can't find them. Worth a try if you're certain your handmade was duped.
---
You've not heard of subprimes and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Enron? Ect.
---
It's happening today during maintenance 
---
Well you already know there are going to be people who will claim it, like those people who claimed to be banned for "crafting a couple of handmade rifles"
---
In like 400 hours I've seen leas than 10 rad storms they are super rare as they should be as the reason they were common in 4 was due to the proximity to the glowing sea, or another nuke impact
---
Careful there, you're going ballistic.
---
It really grinds my gears.
---
Better spring into action!
---
...uh...  uhh, you better...uh adhesive...around...before...  Nope, I'll just leave it at that.
---
That's not West Virginia.
---
And, it's also how the fallout doesn't act.
---
**DO** 
---
**NOT**
---
I wish this was some sick Vault Tec experiment, but it's not.
---
Nobody is going to trade anything for anything after this.  
---
Why would you?  You'd be insane.  You trade your good item X for my good item Y.  Only to find out that my good item Y was duped and they'll delete it from your inventory.  Meanwhile I still have your good item X.
---
**Trading dies today.**
---
p.s.  Player Vending will be a joke after this.  Thanks for ruining content before you release it Bethesda!
---
Oh shit. I have like 45 corn soup... should I dump them somewhere???
---
They wont only remove duped items, they will also remove items you know 100% that are not duped, because you got them yourself from SBQ.
---
I don't want players to come in greater mass, i want the exact opposite. I want 80% of you singleplayer fans to leave in mass so us 20% who enjoy pvp can finnaly play the game how it was intended. Catering to a smaller audience without the bitching of the unnitended larger audience.
---
Food and drink perk suggestion is moot. “Well Fed“ and “Well Hydrated” effects already exist.  
---
Weightless armor would need to be a 3rd and 4th point to “Sturdy Frame” an armor weight reduction perk in the strength column that already exists.  Currently no perk affects only the weight of equipped items. 
---
“Resourceful” is superfluous for armor as repair cost reduction perks already exist in the form of “Power Patcher” and “White Knight”. The ability to scrap screws from weapons would be nice though. Not sure about making them as they’re a semi-valuable junk item and that would tank their value 
---
“Stretchy” is superfluous as “Long Shot” has basically the same effect, but only when ADS. 
---
Man I like that throw. Hah hah suddently people would buy atoms to keep their precious.
---
The last time I farmed Whitesprings for 2+ hours I got 0 things I wanted to use, or could trade to other people.
---
95% of it was 1 star trash.
---
So keep looking for a sunny side to the shit show that's about to happen.  I can't see it.
---
I hate PVP. Every time some jerk kills me, I just get more annoyed. That it's been the same person twice, isn't helping, either. Give me private servers, or PVE, but PVP sucks.
---
Make all new items created upon an update on January 1st@1159pm have a unique ID based off server time upon creation of item plus item description[e.g. 010120192359_TSE_Handmade]. Anything with two items with matching uID was duplicated. Delete 'em all.
---
I am not remotely tech savy and I found a solution.
---
So many assholes, so few bullets
---
Inb4 Rose's quest glitches to 'befriend a scorchbeast', cue 10 people in power armor chasing after a scorchbeast screaming at them to stay tf back.
---
Guess I can kiss the 100 nuka grape someone dropped me goodbye
---
Intreting. Did you check all equipment or just legendaries?
---
...and when they do, they aren't extreme
---
On the flip side, a person can be doing their own thing, and have a level 200+ kill them multiple times just for kicks. I get Bethesda's thoughts that it simulates Raiders, but there's never been a Raider I couldn't kill, whereas there's no way I can kill a level 200+ that's picking on low level characters. Pretty much the only option is to leave the server.
---
Seems fair to me.  Disarming something infinitely is laaame.
---
It Just Works! ™️ Bethesda 
---
&gt;I think its caps stash is linked with Grahm's, but that it.
---
It is. We call it's faction "special".(on most vendor quides/maps I've bothered to check)
---
They removed the Trading Bug!
---
The one that allowed me to freely trade with other players.
---
Holy crap, that is a new feature!
---
Thank you Bethesda!  Thank you sir, may I have another.  Thank you sir, may I have another!
---
Perhaps... the first player to achieve this might win a romantic dinner with Mr. Howard himself? 😍
---
I kind of feel bad for the average Joe who made a map of the cap stashes, saving junk and turning them into bundles just so they could buy a TSE.
---
Chill out, it’s a video game. 
---
And no one can complain about it, because who is going to believe you? Everyone will think you are just troll and cry for having your dupe item get removed.
---
Try scrapping the chassis and the components should split out. Then find a new chassis for then
---
My TSE is likely a duped item, which I will now lose. And who knows what else, I've done a lot of trading on various groups so I could have a lot of duped items. All obtained legitimately through trading and cap purchases. And honestly that was the best part of the game to me, meeting awesome people and making friends through good trades, negotiating prices, finding that one missing piece of gear. But hey, they could be duped so better delete them, no matter if they've been nerfed to hell anyway. The way in which this company conducts itself is absolutely baffling, and the people who cheer on those who leave in frustration are cheering on the demise of the game's future. No company wants to drive customers away, especially a game as a service. I saw my friends list drop dramatically with the last patch, and a few nights ago, I was alone in a world with just one other person. I can't imagine what this will do to the remaining players who sign in and see stuff missing and aren't checking the online forums.
---
If I see a frozen pizza in the store and I don't like it then I don't buy it. If the only pizza they have is a Supreme then I simply don't get pizza. I buy a frozen lasagna.  Or I go to a different store.
---
If pizza hut only has mushroom pizza then I buy from Dominos instead.
---
I've found the problem seems to be something to do with my stored camp, whenever I try and place it, it disconnects me from the server... I've had to create a new camp and it works fine - really strange! 
---
I dunno ... jokes are usually meant to be funny.
---
Fallout 76 usually makes me feel sad, and that is one of the biggest reasons for why I like it.
---
. . .Thank you, I love this post.
---
yeah wouldnt suprise me at all, if just everyones invertory is empty when the maintenance is done. 
---
Pull your bottom lip over your head and swallow. 
---
Really wouldn't help at all in this context, but would still be useful. 
---
Had a  similar issue at violent night event was going but I had no progress? Finished got no reward. Did again later but when I saw same thing was happening I just ft to the yellow event  dot thing and it fixed itself. May try this. 
---
Fuck no, I will probably be playing the game. Sadly Ive been playing far too much of Crossout and last quit Fallout about 6 days ago, after I got disconnected while just 2 mins before my loot was either lost or picked up by nearby player. 
---
I wonder if all the raw flux I had have gone bad or not. I had lots of fun collecting those pretty bright flowers on WS after the nuke effect wear off, they are so pretty without the dark green dust shit that forces you into PA. I had like 300-400 raw flux, most of it was for something that I don't need, that I converted on the first run while wearing PA.
---
Ignore 50% armor. More if wearing full MoM getup and the eye.

I too will be annoyed if my weapons vanish. I'm using things that were exceptionally difficult to find, but there's no way to know if they were duped at some point. 
---
So they made 1 detail correct, but missed 109001 details, meanwhile RDR 2 missed 1 details and nailed 109001 details.
---
Ok I’ll give that a go! Thankyou so much for the help! 
---
Yes you will lose a non existing item you can barter for a legitimate one again. Or you can farm one yourself. 
---
You should be more careful and check user's inventory during trade.  I've noped out of more then one trade because of high possibilities of the person I was trading was a duper or had some connection to it.
---
You can still trade,barter and earn the items again.  Your whole account isn't being wiped. 
---
Awesome. I knew someone would tell me how to fix it if I fucked it up enough. I didn't know there was a bot!
---
There's a perk where u get zero rads for all food u need to max it
---
Real replayability is when real Scotsmen play again? Because I’m enjoying my second character as much as the first. 
---
Would you believe me, it can also be the most disapointing one.
---
I share the enthusiasm, but also I realize these expectations are highly inflated. 
---
If according to Bethesda majority of players don't have what they consider dupes, then their removal will have no effect on the said majority....
---
Oh course a lot of people have lots of dupes. Bethesda just don't view them as such.
---
Yeah, was going to say that. Anyways, food is good for the added bonuses, for example if you get blight which is found around the ash heap you get a bonus 20% critical or Yao Guai will give you melee damage bonus.
---
Players that have duplicated items equipped when logged out will have parts of their bodies deleted and cannot equip gear or change weapons. Players now appear as floating heads and pip-boys. 
---
Thanks for the tip, I accidentally sold my gun to vendor once, bought it back afterwards. Hope it's clean now...
---
I have a rule of thumb. If someone's trying to sell it to me, it's almost definitely duped, unless it's garbage or something that's craftable from a recipe. 
---
The fact that _you_ don't understand that as the problem, that _almost everything is duped_ and that _most of us_ don't _want_ your duper trash in the game _at fucking all_
---
Again. YOU  are the fucking problem. 
---
This is the _best_ decision bethesda has made for this game, pretty  much _ever_ provided they pull it off without undue complications. If you loose 99.9% of your traded inventory, I don't _give a shit_. 
---
Because, again, the _only_ safe assumption for most items in this game, is if it's _on offer_ it's _duped_.
---
Good items are _rare as fuck_. If someone has a trade inventory full, they're a _fucking duper_ who deserves to be fucked over, or someone who is _knowingly buying_ from fucking dupers, who also deserves to get fucked over. 
---
Proper fucked
---
Thousands of duped items, yes, this game is fun
---
Why don't they just delete everyone's characters and start from scratch already?
---
Also, some people sell without inspecting. I found a Hunter’s machine gun at a vendor that also happened to be explosive. Then again, maybe it was sold because, as I later discovered, it’s fucking useless. 
---
25/f/Netherlands/Teacher 
---
:\\ my general rule of thumb is, if there's a significant volume of any high value material, it's almost decidedly going to be duped. 
---
I've never traded directly with anyone that could be considered a duper, never saw anything that raised an alarm. I'm sure the duped guns have passed through many hands before reaching my inventory. As for farming, that lost its luster months ago, you can only shoot ghouls, robots, and super mutants so many times for a chance at something good. It's just a boring gameplay style, in my opinion. The words "grinding" or "farming" define the gameplay well, it's honestly not something I want to do anymore. I made a lot of caps throughout the months and I wanted the best end game stuff, since I was at the end of playing the game. If the stuff is removed, well that just seals that deal then..
---
I've not finished them yet but I remember seeing someone post a picture of their power armour collection and enclave uniform and they were doing a salute; I could definitely be remembering wrong though
---
I disagree. Screws and springs are semi-rare components and should remain such.  
---
My counter suggestion:  a second and third level to the “scrapper” perk similar to in FO4 that allows screws, springs, nuclear material, etc to be scrapped from weapons.  The only items that can be gained from a weapon are those needed to make it.  For example, you can’t make Plasma Gatlings (which don’t require springs to make) then scrap for springs.  
---
Further, I would suggest that scrapping loose mods grants a small chance to learn that mod. 
---
Let atodd bless us with his holy glow
---
Or even with intelligence, for that matter. Smart people often do the dumbest shit. 
---
heh, some one who understands, but in fo76, too few bullets.
---
Oh yeah guys let's buy and sell items st 80% of the total currency limit a pop and flood the market with caps then wonder why we are now sitting in a virtual Zimbabwe where money has no worth. Genius.
---
You hit things with it and they die, middlingly quickly.
---
I still farm at whitesprings, and so do a lot of other people. Have picked up some good stuff over time. The stuff I don't want, I sell or give away. 
---
there ya go
---
&gt;Steel and lead are heavy; they need to be bulked to save stash
---
Bulked steel weights as much in stash as the steel. 
---
Bulked stuff in stash was not being scrapped into pieces.
---
I know for a fact people were duping flux, I’m just confident that none of it I bought was duped as the quantities were reasonable. 
---
The plastic could have potentially been duped, but it could have believably been farmed as well, though it would have been a lot of farming. 
---
This actually makes me want to play again, I got sick of spending hours grinding to get what I think is a killer weapon and build only to be demoralised when fighting the SBQ. 
---
I didn’t think BGS would be able to track traded duped weapons, but if they can pull it off and the when the butt hurt wears off, it’s going to be a much better game for it. 
---
Guess I am officially done then. I've had a gun I'm pretty sure was duped since the first few weeks for the game. It's *still* my best gun. I havent found anything even close to it.
---
Fuck this, man. We get constant nerfs to everything and now this? 
---
See ya
---
need an inverse mod to give hoarders something too. just seap what is increased and decreased.
---
I get his point though, the idea is these duped items will never see the light of day because their owner doesn't log in anymore because they played the game, broke it, had crazy fun then got incredibly bored and switched over to another game.
---
I haven't been pvp'd once by tse weapons, I began playing again after the tse nerf and honestly duped items (I'm assuming the 200 screws and ballistic fibers I bought were duped, and the 5k .45 ammo I picked up) actually made the game more playable for me because suddenly I wasn't running around in broken armor with a .308 sniper with an abysmal dps burning through stimpacks like they're injectable liquid candy, I had armor and a combat rifle that while it broke a lot at first, didn't matter cause I could repair it.
---
Their economy is destitute, they seem to want it that way, duped items actually improved my experience, helped me get better armor and weapons rather than being stuck constantly maintaining my crappy armor and weapon.
---
If you're not holding 500 adhesive, screws, ballistic fiber, springs, or more than 10k or any junk or ammo of any kind, and only have *a* tse weapon, and haven't exploited, you shouldn't be punished for the company's incompetence or for trading with another for something you wanted or felt you needed just to enjoy the gameplay.
---
If under for free to a friend or  team mate at the event is usually what caused this for me I think. I still do t so ftnis free lol but then use the dot. It very few if any caps cost once you are there.
---
Dear god...ARK and it's dev team are some of the scummiest fucking bastards in the business. "we're going to take early access money and develop new paid content while our existent game has dinosaurs clipping through walls and the ground, never to be seen again". 
---
Why?  Did you store a bunch of junk that wasn’t broken down yet?
---
&gt;, but what really bothered me about the last patch was not the "nerf" of TSE weapons but it seemed like the nerf happened because the real "whiny children" bitched about it constantly so management decided to pander to and placate them.
---
So you believe that if people cry for enough of PTS, Bethesda will give one?
---
There is also the good version of this. I regularly give low level players my workshops when I get off for the night. It’s not always a trap.
---
It was fucking obvious to anyone with half a brain, man. 
---
Ruh roh Raggy.. 
---
They are removing duped items (today) and banning people who don’t know how to look things up on the internet. 
---
“The end is nigh?”  I think you’re about 25 years late. 
---
&gt;And everything is referenced as magical effects, enchantments, alchemy, etc from the origins as an Elder Scrolls engine.
---
What bugs me is some boosts in Fallout literally read fortify ingame. That's nice word for magic /fantasy game but it's doesn't fit into Fallout where most read should read increase.
---
What if you payed caps for an item that you didn't know was duped?
---
Then you’re getting fucked twice. 
---
Rip
---
Just try to always loot clipboards, fans, scales toys and that kind of stuff and soon you'll have more screws/springs than you know what to do with.
---
I'm sitting at about 800 of each... 
---
Springs/Screws are mildly rare but the items containing them are actually pretty common.
---
AA for vats ts is poop in vats. Tho some humorous things happen. I once tried to vats the SBQ with a prime ts crossbow.  One arrow hit her the other hit this guy in front of me square in the ass. He then turned around and I gave him the ???? Emote thing he did thumbs up I turned pacifist on just in case and we killed the bitch. 
---
No doubt many of us are worried about our purchases, trades and vendor dumpster dives, but what can ya do? Whatever losses you take you can catch up some way or another. Think of it as a challenge?
---
&gt;I duped the fuck out of all my gear and now worry I'm gonna lose it
---
-op
---
I think this happens when another player starts it and leaves (disconnect or just walks away). If you find an event you want to do and you're worried just close the map and open it again to refresh. It usually dumps out timed out quests... Usually...
---
The bigger problem I have is that events just don't spawn like they used to. I usually see one or none and have to wait for them to spawn. They used to appear more frequently.
---
That makes a lot of sense! Now that I think about it..  i  usually claim the workbench there so instead of paying for the travel I just fast travel to the workshop ... hmm interesting lol I’ll try fast travel close but not exactly at the event and see how it goes! 
---
Omeglalulz of the best kinds all around. 
---
With HOW MUCH 'counterfeit' stuff there is circulating out there, no trader actually playing as a trader would not have touched a duped item eventually unless they were trading exclusively in a closed community.
---
But who cares about what's right or wrong to do, the morality of the situation doesn't matter!
---
Yeah I’m finding that events aren’t spawning as much anymore! 
---
For real, tf is wrong with people.  Apathy reigns supreme in the human heart.
---
This game just took the single player factor to a new level. 
---
They do, just someone must trigger them by walking near.
---
Also didn’t know about the map refreshing! Only just started getting back into this game 
---
How much is the mark up tho
---
I feel like there are more urgent things that need to be fixed before this.
---
Or imagine losing your email address, reddit account or online back credidentials. They are all as fictious.
---
Well i don't know how a player could tell if something was duped for certain, unless they duped it themselves or whoever gave it to them confirmed it was duped.
---
We had a thread yesterday or a few days ago about how incredibly rare TSE really is. The point of that thread was to rightly criticize how ridiculously rare it is to see certain items, such as TSE. Yet TSE is crazy abundant due to duping.
---
Bethesda isn't going after every single duped item, they're very specifically targeting certain items. Likely items that are by design very rare and no doubt TSE is on that list.
---
 The point i'm making is that if someone had their TSE removed, that they did not loot as a drop for themselves, odds are likely that it was a dupe to begin with. 
---
That makes it very hard for me to side with people who inevitably come here complaining about something like that. Statistics are just no in their favor.
---
whats your gt on xbox? would be stoked to have a jetpack for my t45 armor man mines is trealcosby can you add me or i add you
---
I mean, 200 screws is easy, I've dumped that many in one go before a couple of times into chests at random train stations. 200 ballistic fiber is witchcraft, though. 
---
I have a lot of issues with how bethesda has handled multiple aspects of this game. Ballistic fiber needs to be easier to get, in methods that don't break the bank. They need to re-balance legendary drop rates, every "fix" just makes legitimately getting quality gear harder. 
---
If you can't play the game legitimately though, and them removing the hundreds of thousands of duped items negatively affects you? Sorry dude, but that's kinda what you get. 
---
Frankly, I have doubts that this is going to remove individual items from individual users. I suspect what's going to happen is that a whole mess of storage mules with max inventory stacks of duped gear will end up wiped out, though. 
---
It's under graphics, there's a slider to turn down the opacity of the HUD! 
---
Not everyone worried is a duper. I’m concerned about the side effects and the fact that they previously claimed they couldn’t track items (to restore items that mysteriously vanish) but now claim they can remove items known to be duped.
---
It makes me concerned about how they’re going to implement this fix. Hopefully it’s not a script removing all guns with the TSE effect combo.  I also expect a bunch of OP melee stuff to not be removed, further widening the divide between the OP nature of melee and the steadily weakening power of ranged weapons. 
---
This can happen when you have too many holotapes on you, the list gets mixed up and the titles are out of order. 
---
Solution should be drop all unnecessary holotapes and try again, should work! 
---
Now PvP'ers be like "end game content!" 
---
 ps: your right around my neighborhood. If you build closer to the "you cannot go that way wall, you get less of in game spawns that attack your camp.
---
it is an easy fix, hell, i could write the code!!
---
why?  because at times, i want all my junk on me, and i hate having to press the "e" button 100's of times.  i guess i was not clear enough in my OP.
---
I mean, everything's duped probably, to some extent. 
---
And a lot of it's playstyle...people talk about screws like they're rare, but I never have an issue with them, but I run out of plastic and ballistic fiber all the time. 
---
A melee character, or a non-shotgun user, though? I could see one of those ending up with a few thousand plastic in fairly short order. 
---
There are only a few events that work like that. Line in the Sand, Violence Night (at night), etc.
---
If those are on cooldown you just have to wait for Census Violence, The Messenger, etc, and those are random.
---
If you have some system that works otherwise I would love to know because waiting on events have been a huge time suck since the patch a couple of weeks ago.
---
Lolz So what happens if Bethesda does not do anything?
---
No need to read the server logs. You can read those from the DB directly.
---
Meh I don’t care.
---
My camp isn’t big
---
I'm here to collect poop.
---
Lmao it’s fine on my PS4 bit so PC master race now 
---
They are just going to delete all the sentinel armour pieces 
---
If you are bored them move onto other games. You are not required to continue playing if the game has lost it's enjoyment to you.
---
Just wouldn't work with items duped before the date. 
---
I do events that are avaible, if there isn't anything good, server hop.
---
I had camp at mine where uranium fever event is, and in most time after login in this event started.
---
There are no differences in the quest past. It's a flat line, with no RPG elements. There is no advantage in doing it over again, there's no alternative path to provide different content. 
---
That's what I mean when I say there's no replayability. 
---
Of course, you can re-play the game, just like you can re-read a book or do whatever, but it's the _same_ experience. 
---
Well aren't you a trooper, god bless.
---
Damn...I was hoping. I was doing the quest and it didn't specify which enemies to kill. Just said 0/6. So I checked a walkthrough after receiving credit for killing a canine and it wasn't listed in the walkthroughs. Made me wonder if it was possible that by killing different variations of enemies would yield different effects.
---
Probably cause more bugs like your whole inventory disappears or super mutants now drop 170 3* short hunting rifles.
---
Yep. I highly doubt they've been tracking any additional metadata for anything really
---
I’m having so much fun watching this sub turn against Bethesda. This is going to be a blast to watch.
---
Bans?  And why did you guys buy this mediocre game?
---
I’m struggling to see a reason to want so much material on you.  Well...  except for one. 
---
First DLC contend will drop in March if i recall correctly.
---
I can't wait to see Bethesda fuck this up
---
I'm not a griefer scumbag, so...none? 
---
I am relaxed. Never traded anything but small things. All weapons and armor I got I have found ingame. Made a whole bucket of popcorn.
---
New content is stated in you're title.
---
Honestly, I had no idea that nice level 200 player who was willing to trade with me and sell me a two shot exploding rifle/10mm/shotgun/gatling for 5000 caps would be anything other than an RNG god who is extremely generous. 
---
IF this goes thru, the only thing that will happen is that people are going to be even more stingy about trades and only give away a good item for another really good item and most definitely not sell it for caps.
---
Exactly I just finished playing and last place I went to was whitesprings and vendor was selling a raw company shotty with 25% movement speed. I bought it as I don't care if it get taken tomorrow just an excuse to use my other neglected weapons 😀
---
10% camp budget is more like 2000% of storage budget, as far as hit on the server is concerned. 
---
Their content is: We delete your progression, so that you can play again. 
---
and I am no hinting on dupe removals, rather on situations where people are losing their stashes and inventories. 
---
Yeah because now you will need to get new weapon man!
---
If you knowingly bought a duped item, that's...on you.  This shit was coming, everyone with half a brain KNEW it was coming, most of us have been \_begging\_ for this shit. 
---
It's almost like these mindless morons are scorched and Bethesda is the scorchbeast queen...
---
Guess we better slay this fat oversized dragon before its behavior is mimicked by lesser fat oversized dragons.
---
Yup, fair point.  I thought the same too but just carried on because i was suddenly able to sprint again :)
---
Happens less often nowadays though, because my buddies sit on it until i get back so people cant grab it :)
---
Players have payed already. There's no subscription. So they aren't afraid. And btw my guess is that they already made double the production costs and could care less about that.
---
I doubt that they have such logs or a transaction history. I think that they just will remove the inventory of mules
---
You can kill wanted players and get a nice haul also. 
---
They can't bring new content with duplication glitches around.
---
First they have to delete duped items and obviously they'll add some system to detect dupers. Ofc they're not going to tell you about this, it would be counter productive. In ESO they permanently banned all dupers. I'm fully expecting them to do the same here after the purge of duped items happens. They're just purging now so "innocent" people will only lose the stuff they bought from dupers. 
---
When all this is fixed they can bring player shops, since now the item rarity has been fixed and the player economy won't go to shit on day one and new content will also come out. What's the point in adding new content if people can dupe that shit?
---
I don't get it why people moan and complain when what they're doing is the logical and the best thing to do.
---
😎👆👆. I like you. You seem like a cool sandwich.
---
One end is blunt that if hit will give you a concussion, the other end has a point, I'll let you figure this out.
---
Everyone: the game is shit don’t add new content before you fix it
---
Bethesda: does as they say
---
Everyone: this
---
Thing is, vast majority of players just... play. They meet a friendly obvious trader with a camp built for trading and go "Nice. Game encourages this, gonna do it, oh shit a TSE for 5k I can afford that!" and move on. Said person doesn't check forums, doesn't check probability of drops, doesn't know ANY of what's going on... they did absolutely nothing wrong, and they're gonna pay for other's mistakes when they are exactly what Bethesda wants, a pure player, while said trader and beneficiary of duping is... just... gonna keep on having the caps they already got. Same for people who sell excess to vendorbots and somebody grabs from there.
---
There is this weird assumption, here, that anybody and everybody should know the probabilities, statistics, and chances of these kinds of drops and should know the risks they entered into by utilizing a game's trade feature. But thats... ridiculous, at best. Vast, vast, vast majority of players are utterly clueless, could give a fuck about forums, and THEY are gonna be the most punished while the traders... keep their caps and have an advantage on restocking themselves, and their supply. Slap on the wrist for those doing actual wrong while the innocent get kneecapped by a shotgun at point blank.
---
I dunno. Whole thing is fucked. The hive-mind assumption that everybody playing should just "know" or that us talking intertube heads represent the majority of player's knowledge is so incredibly arrogant and self-important it is genuinely kind of shocking. I don't think people do it on purpose... but no, we aren't the majority and no, not everyone knows what's up and no, this isn't going to go well.
---
And yeah, I'm a wee bit salty about all this, because I don't know what was and wasn't duped anymore, I spent a shitload of time and caps getting gear I liked and wanted (and I never bought from traders with weapons that "stacked" in their inventory, cuz yeah, those are obviously duped) but now I have to worry that those traders were only holding single items on them while their stash was full of dupes to replace their inventory menu, and there is a good chance people like me who avoided duping and did our best to work around this bullshit via careful trading are still gonna get fucked over, all while a bunch of douchebags laugh and decide for us we are lying dupers/customers taking advantage of things.
---
...this late night rant got the fuck away from me, lol. Sorry, I just don't like the possible negative effects from this shit at all. Particularly 3 months later, and with no communication after a massive TSE nerf. Don't mean to take it out on you via responding to you.
---
Add me to the list. I thought I had sold it by accident but I see now it must have disappeared in my stash. 
---
I hope this bug gets fixed and my veil reappears just as magically. 
---
LOL That's like wishing Bethesda will make a stable game!
---
They're doing this because we, as a community, \_begged\_ them to. This IS a fix. 
---
How would they know?
---
I cant wait to see people without Nuka-Cola Quantum/Etc x100000. 
---
I mainly just sell shit I find. I don't really care if I lose the items or not. Not like anyones gonna buy most of them, and it'll clear up my stash space.
---
Cnt remember if u were the guy i replied to in an earlier post then couldn’t find you again, given ur set up if it was ur monitor you would get a shutter effect, you can test that theory by plugging a hdmi into ur card and any tv give it a whirl, to me it sounds like something is bottle necking your assets loading,
---
Have a look here https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-free-benchmark-programs/ 
---
See what a benchmark comes back with, just looking at fo76 settings now there to basic go to your NVIDIA settings and try turning vertical sync off 
---
Lost alot of caps to events 
---
Just think of the time you are saving not needing to fill up the bath for a wash.
---
It may be the same *content*, but it’s not the same experience; the builds themselves bring pretty different gameplay. 
---
What it doesn’t have is a different dialogue choice 300 hours in that’s going to result on a different slide playing in a slideshow at the end of the main quest. That, I’ll happily concede. 
---
I figured the point was to be able to give yourself rads when you want. Looking at you Radicool perk.
---
Yeah that's true, but i think part of the business model is to continue to sell stuff through the atom shop. And that takes, first, playing players (duh) and also happy players.
---
Then again, i think this wipe is directed towards the ebay sellers who aren't good customers/players anyway.
---
Minecraft has a BR mode. I think FO76 could too. :)
---
So what you're saying is, you want Bethesda to look at it's existent audience, say "this isn't for you" and double down on the literal 10% of people who bought this game who are like you?  
---
Are you high or stupid? 
---
So like, he just shouldn't trade?  Right?  Some asshat dupes 15 weapons 1000 times and those get spread out like wildfire cause everyone wants one, all of those people who received a weapon through trading should be hit for getting that weapon, even if they had literally no clue it was duplicated?
---
Wtf is wrong with people?  What happened to *our* world that people can be so apathetic?
---
That right there is me. I have a nice collection, that i have spent 10's of thousands of caps for, off various traders. 50% of me playing fo76 was trading and such. I was kinda hoping when dupes was mentioned, that they meant if you have duplicates of the same weapon, like 100 times over. Then that would be fair enough. I have a feeling they are just going to get rid of all tse weapons, out of pure laziness. No idea how they can trace all duped weapons over all accounts on 3 different systems?!
---
Would be nice if it was included in the patch notes. 
---
Chinese Stealth Suit
---
I'd rather they made that an in game item which did more than just cosmetic stuff.
---
Had this issue firstly try placing outside if in building if not simply scrap as above commenter said, there have been some glitched chassis 
---
Bethesda has the ability to find massive numbers of the \_same item\_ in a inventory. This can be done via automation. They can look at an existant inventory and go "This inventory has 200 AAE/TSE/BBQ weapons, and five thousand nuka quantoms".   
---
If you think being able to do THAT is the ability to look at a profile and say "This account had a single TSE yesterday and it's gone now" you're delusional.   
---
That's the thing, nothing's stopping them from giving any individual any specific item. The issue is verifying that item was legitimately lost. 
---
It's not like Bethesda is just gonna let them keep the duped weapons they bought. So what, they payed for a duped weapon? It's not the end of the fucking world. It'll just disappear, and you'll get on with your life.
---
Sells for hella caps
---
Id rather fix the base game and make sure all of its components are solid before we get new content. Balance passes on legendary affix's being 1 big one on my list. Re-balance of perks and Mutations should also be taken into consideration. 
---
I'd also like to see more server stability improvements. 
---
Something id love to see is a player cap increase. 32-48 players would be amazing. The game is pretty with nobody around. Or at least a server browser so i can join 24 lvl100+ players for example. 
---
In the early stages of the game. when duping wasn't so widely talked about, people paid like 10k+ caps for stuff. That's not exactly bargain rates.
---
I sold a tse combat shotgun someone gave me for 350 caps because it's Value was 386 caps...
---
Sometimes to good to be true deals are just stupid ignorant people like me not realizing that tse weapon sells for 15k :/
---
I'm a moron but honestly if it was duped then I feel bad for that person, their 350 caps shouldn't be with me if that gun wasn't supposed to be around to begin with.
---
&gt;  Each item is created from a BaseID and is given a *unique* RefID.
---
&gt; Two items with the *same* RefID ...
---
Which of these two contradictory statements is true?
---
i don’t mind the attackers much since i’m mostly under ground! every attack i’ve had so far has been on the road above. the only time it was a nuisance was when they destroyed my generator while i was inside, trapping me inside because the only ways in and out are garage doors with the switch facing out. 
---
i also got very unlucky earlier today and a “radtoad horde” event was directly on top of my camp. 
---
it’s all worth it though. for now. i might get sick of it eventually 
---
Or Bethesda could u know develop the code and let people store stuff like every other mmo out there  
---
Fortnig-ayte
---
I am pretty sure they want us to team up and trade, as stated in the first trailers for the game before release. Now it seems as though they do not want us to?! I am confused what their intentions are. 
---
Where is the game heading? What are the plans for fixing broken code in the game? Why is it stilll a shit show 4 months on? 
---
The TSE nerf almost made me quit, not they are going to take my trades items away? This is met by jealousy and hostility from fallout fan boiiiisss that couldn't get ahold of a TSE. "Getting da popcornz ready for salty dupers"....
---
I paid caps for my items, not duped shit myself!
---
Given that the majority of the guns I have are TSE, im pretty sure thats all my guns gone. I hadnt duped them myself (i spent a shit tonne of caps on them), but I suspect most of them are.
---
I was planning on coming back to Fallout 76 when its been fixed and more content added. Im uninstalling this shitshow of a 'game'.
---
The remake of Resident Evil 2 is an awesome game, and the new Metro game coming out soon looks amazing, so I'll be sticking with them for a while. My Fallout 76 disc is now my coffee coaster.
---
If Rust developers had a history of making only singleplayer games, and when they finally make the sucessfull PvP survival game called "Rust" it is held hostage by the vast majority of their fanbase who bought the game just to complain that it has no story and they don't like PvP, don't you want to cut that cancer away? Rust is doing just fain as a pvp survival game but it would received the exact same backlash if it had you guys to complain about it and end up a trash game with no identity in the process by trying to cater to both audiences.
---
Shit, looks like I'll be left with but a few broken laser rifles. Since I traded all my legit stuff to TSE weapons... Feelsbadman.
---
What if someone sold me all my weapons duped but I didn't know?
---
I actually kinda doubt individual items are going to be targeted. But yeah, if you bought a duped item, you're not innocent, you contributed to the problem. 
---
Oh bother
---
Well, could that be an issue that around midnight by GMT everything was so laggy
---
Weeeeeeeee
---
This is some oblivion type logic. I miss that game
---
Honestly, I don’t fully understand the dupe removal for TSEs. Yes they shouldn’t be as plentiful as they are, but many people are already dropping them post nerf. I used to have a bunch. I’ve been selling them off because they’re just not that good compared to many other legendary effects. 
---
For example, I recently acquired a pump shotgun that does 156 per hit and has the instigating effect (among others). On a first hit, this beats the pants off my TSE which only does 190 and has less accuracy. I’ll be selling the TSE most likely. 
---
We'll just have to agree to disagree. 
---
That's sad that this is what hypes you up in this game. 
---
My cheeks are spread and ready for the thrusting penetration of posts. Mmmmmm
---
This is going to be interesting.. to say the least. Go ahead take my duped weapons. But so help me God, if you take ANY of my unique 3*'s that I found (ex: my ts gauss rifle) there will be hell to pay !!!!
---
That's way far from a majority tho, so I'll take half a dozen players being screwed against a balanced game every day thank you.
---
Also, duping has been known since beta, and people having 10k caps in the first month of game were probably well aware of it.
---
Yeah I'm already uninstalling. Far better games out there.
---
&gt; Or it could be an indication that you've been on a crafting binge.
---
You could assume that 100 TSE guns with sequential refID's were duped since players have no way of crafting them.
---
If you want to play rust, GO PLAY RUST. I don't want to play rust, I want to play fallout. 
---
I will defiantly agree Bethesda's made some mistakes...trying to suck in the griefer trash audience from games like RUST and ARK was a bad call. 
---
So let me get this straight, whose fault do you think this is?  And who's getting punished for it?
---
If your answers aren't Bethesda followed by, their paying customers, then I don't know how exactly you'll understand how wrong this is to do to your paying customers whom just want to enjoy your product.
---
Field Surgeon combined with First Aid and Born Survivor/Medic Pump is a potent combination for keeping you alive.
---
Party Boy/Girl will help make that random liquor you find way more useful. 
---
I never bought any legendary weapons from anyone because it's a boring way to play.
---
ok.  thanx.  will check out the bench mark.  right now doing my vendor runs.  will try it in a bit.
---
i got a friend coming over today with a proper 23" acer monitor.  i think it is 60hz refresh too, may be 140?  we will see if it is my sanyo or not.  :-)
---
Well, means I get a lot of caps without having to use up my plastic.
---
They're trying to fix their product by getting rid of duplicated items.  They are deleting duplicated weapons. What do you expect them to do, let the players keep the duplicated weapons? 
---
I don't remember my best but last night I made over 2000 caps just from the same 3 guys repeatedly seeking revenge on me. They got me a few times but man that was fun and I made bank. They started the fight each time and I love pvp so no fallout player was griefed or anything. I wish we didnt lose caps on death though!
---
Save the world team.
---
really, i need not to have to explain myself, but just for shits and giggles, for instance, when i am at a vendor, i want all my junk on me.
---
47/M/Scotland. Shepherd and part time astronaut. Good to see there's some other "older" players about. My first game was 3d monster maze on the Sinclair zx81. Black &amp; white and no sound. Needed a 16k expansion! Fallout 76 would have blown my mind back in the day...
---
"  or acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed "
---
melee with all rise :)
---
It's not the computer near all those blank holotape. Look for another one in a cubicle. I had the same problem and had to check some youtube video to find the correct computer.
---
The people that said that were support people. And they indeed had no tools to do that. Developers of course have all the tools to access and modify database. 
---
It's a whole different department.
---
It's not like I am typing with mitts on.
---
I have the siphon holotape, it wont load into the computer Im supposed to.
---
Bolton green's as well
---
These pure, innocent players you're talking about aren't on Reddit. If they were, they'd know, and then not be so innocent. (I mean, if you're sure some of your stuff is leaving tomorrow then you know it's probably duped.) These innocent people aren't gonna suddenly post here. They're not even thinking of Reddit. They just play. I don't think you need to worry about them. It's disingenuous anyway. 
---
Haven't got the Rat skin yet.
---
There have been days where the majority of my legendary kills, especially my multi-star legendary kills have been like this. they're "looking into it".
---
"don't play any online games if you aren't ready for hundreds of hours of work and trading to disappear."
---
Damn, you're an asshole aintcha?
---
&gt; The guy didn't seem like a duper 
---
What does that mean?
---
Well if they ever fix the game so I can play it again, I'll find out if I bought a duped item or not at some point.
---
If you have blank holotapes try to drop them. Re-logging could also help. I hated every bit of that quest, had so many bugs happening....
---
It's not often I'm proud of a stranger on the internet.  However, someone who sets out to prove his own hypothesis,  proves it wrong and takes a new view after new evidence and pubically retracts his statement. We need more people like you in the world.
---
My suspicion is that they can't tell a dupe. But they can run some math. They can estimate approximately how many "max level TSE/weight pumps" should have dropped based on legendaries killed, time in game, or some other event or time based metric. They can then stack that up against exactly how many there are currently in player inventories. I bet they set a threshold about how much higher the discrepancy would be before they officially call it a dupe. Like on xbox, there are easily 10000x more TSE/per lever actions in the game then there statistically *should* be
---
I'm mildly concerned because of the history of bugs with patches, but that's about it...I fully expect greater stability from fewer people with giant inventories full of shit.   
---
And if any of my gear is gone, it's because of a bug, not because I paid some asshat $20 in the real world for a fucking toy in a video game. 
---
I hope you are joking. I make way more than 10 at a time, I have marsupial mutation.
---
if you bought it from a player, it's probably duped. If you got it from a vendor, it's probably farmed. 
---
MK 11 You’re Next is all I can think
---
This whole subreddit is full of new content after Bethesda announced the next patch. I haven't seen it so live and vibrant since ages. Even the prior batch and it's hotfix was nothing. What a great time to be alive.
---
Not to mention Youtube is probably exploding. Im too lazy to check for that plus good youtubers need a bit time to make their stuff.
---
And I think the patch won't have the dupe items as sole content, it should have some for SB balance as well.
---
Fair enough  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯ 
---
Imagine writing this, getting all the praise for being able to own up to your mistakes, receiving a couple of medals even(congrats btw!), to then go on 12th Uranium Fever run and get a lvl 50 legendary.. That would be worthy of a nice and juicy "Oof".
---
But seriously, it's a great lesson to all the people, who blindly defend something they think they know, rather than defending something that they have thoroughly researched.
---
Cheers! 
---
I'm running around with 30 remaining hitpoints. Meanwhile, I can carry over 400lbs, sell shit for a lot of caps, scrap for a lot of mats,  and my super sledge does north of 700 damage per hit. All because of my random, crappy armor. 
---
Dropped the blank holotapes, logged out and back in and still nothing. Fuck this piece of shit game. I just want the platinum just so I can take the disc and throw it out my fucking window.
---
Sir, this is a video game...
---
I mean, casual majority of players aren't running to the Internet to check the trade value of an item... this game hasn't existed long enough, in a stable enough state, for that to even be a consideration.
---
So, in your analogy, the vast majority of people are folks whom have never seen or heard of a ferrari, only ever had 80's Honda civic that was worth SO MANY GOATS in their home trading economy, and that 5K seems like a legit deal costing them most of what they currently, and ever will, have at a single time.
---
The disussion was on some days ago, but as in every game, only a small fraction of active players ever get engaged with any online community regarding that game. I guess the mayority of players just plays the game (as in any game) and don't care 'bout the wars that rage here and will definitely not be affected by the purge.
---
Because people are idiots and think all your hard work should disappear.
---
This community ain't great for the most part.
---
Like when it's funny stuff everyone is chill for sure 
---
But bring up any of the downsides of the anti duping shit and it's like bringing up politics with your racist uncle, that motherfucker ain't gonna let it go, and he ain't gonna be nice about it.
---
Yup.
---
But the next days will be entertaining as hell. :D
---
If you want to play Fallout go play Fallout 4 or wait for Fallout 5. This is a muliplayer survival game, it was never suppose to be Fallout 5.
---
Do you play in full screen. Playing windowed might sevelry impact your draw rate which might been happening.
---
I don't think there's absolutely anything related to your monitor.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted. Pretty much the only person with a more negative response that actually gave some reasoning and contributed without just saying no lol. I appreciate ya!
---
Shhh boys I think he's uh, not all there.
---
That’s a good point though :/ yeah you’re right to be honest 
---
Hahahahah, god damn man, gold!
---
I bought a one ear headset where I can hear the game and chat and on the other ear I can hear my home theater 
---
My friends and I have quit playing - yes we enjoyed parts of it enough to get to the end but *buying* stuff to *support* an absolute shit product so they can do it again? What kind of person does that? What message does it send? By doing so you say to games corporations interested only in your wallet that they can basically bugger your asshole. Bend over then!
---
Easy. They remove everything that’s double. 2 snipers? Not anymore.
---
Although WV got through the war with no (?) nuke impacts since Vault 76 opened up they've been happening on a daily basis...
---
More entertaining if you start drama yourself. Might even join the bandwagon and make a "I lost ___ even though they were not duped and very legit" post. 
---
Just dumped every holotape not related to the Orders quest and it finally went into the computer. WTF
---
I don’t think this will work, I have a TSE that I’m fairly sure is duped, i favourited it, then I dropped it into a bag, picked it up, modded it, sold to Welch vendor, bought it back after a few seconds wait, then when I looked in my inventory it was *still* favourited, surely this wouldn’t of happened had the ID or something changed etc. But you never know I guess, I wont be too bothered anyways.
---
They weren't until you started to drag the conversation off topic and yes, any single bullet can be assigned the SAME ID which can then be changed if it's passed to another player.
---
Well the people who bought duped items, willfully or obliviously, still benefitted from duping. The items they bought had supressed prices due to artificially inflated supply, in effect they paid much less for the item then it would've legitimately been worth.
---
The real victims of duping where the people who got killed by people with duped super weapons, or those who found a good legendary drop but could only sell it for a much reduced price due to duping.
---
Dupers themselves should be targetted in ban waves, like the one we saw a few weeks ago.
---
From what the notes said if they were duped they will be gone.
---
I'm there too (PS4). Awesome place for junk, trading and grabbing shit to sell all in one place. Where exactly are you? I'm by the junk pile by the train station. 
---
I'm not really sure, I suspect, is all, and those came from... get this... before I paid attention to reddit and found out about these issues. Crazy, right?
---
And do you really think, if these innocent players are suddenly hit by vast quantities of pulled items, they won't THEN take an interest and find their way here? How many people have shown up on reddit, in this sub, only AFTER a problem came up and they figured out this was one of the better places to get traction on an issue? It happens daily, completely unrelated to this patch.
---
What's disingenuous is this fucked up assumption that everybody just KNOWS this stuff.
---
No dup's dude
---
That’s good point 
---
U mad bro? 
---
More important question what else will disappear that's not even if their removal list 😈
---
;P
---
Good idea dont know it is a quest item..
---
What makes you think he *is* playing?
---
Thanks man
---
:P
---
I bought it back at around 500 caps
---
This is what I was hoping to hear. The exploration has always been the major attraction for me with the previous games, and after however many hours I've put into those I miss the surprise I felt during the first few playthroughs. I was really looking forward to 76, but after alllll the endless hate I've read I was worried about it leaving me disappointed with the series as a whole. You guys have given me hope!
---
**Penetration**
---
At least they will bring back a lot of players today after the patch lol. I think that everyone is curious to see what happens , and how much stuff we’re gonna lose . As a everyday trader, I know that a lot of my weapons / armor will be  gone , but to be honest , i don’t care too much , I want to see a fresh start to the market on the subs , I’m just tired to see the same ppl asking for the same things everyday ( me also Included , I’m not gonna lie ) , and the game just become boring, because you simply have nothing to do after you get the weapons ( aka the god rolls ) that you want ( for me at least ) . 
---
Mr Howard, I don't feel so good...
---
What's after 2-handed melee nerf? Fisting?
---
They specifically said they would remove items from players who had purchased duped items, from which you must infer that they have tracking logs of some sort. 
---
Maybe the server rollback function we all know about is more extensive than a single point in time, and they’re able to compare differences from one checkpoint to another.
---
Don't worry, people haven't read the announced clear. They consider dupes to be had only by small percent of playerbase. They only target highly spesific dupes.
---
I'm glad it finally worked for you. 
---
Also when you get to the kill 6 creatures bit, don't unequip the blade until it registered the quest. If you unequip it it won't count the creatures as killed. It was one of the more frustrating bits i encountered, sorry for the mild spoilers but it might save you a bit of time.
---
Always in party chat dont hear other players the one time i did it was anoying music, static, kids, and heavy breathers
---
They can't work. The title is missing 5-10 question marks.
---
Yeah I only have 2 weapons and I’m sure they are probably duped if not I’d be surprised. If I end up losing them I won’t have any caps to trade for a new weapon I’ll be stuck basically in the beginning again trying g to get a decent weapon.
---
It's not like we are launching any nukes *cough*
---
Rad Storms should be far more common when there is an active Nuke Zone/s
---
Yes that is the main problem 
---
Give it a rest, dickhead. Go and take a walk outside or something.
---
Lol. I guess.
---
Plenty of people could also lie. I mean if i wanted to really fuck with Bethesda and i had a TSE weapon here's what i'd do: 
---
I'd stip it of all mods, make it look as barebones as possible just like how you find these things.
---
Then i'd go out and kill some 2 or 3 star Legendary. Take whatever legendary item it dropped and put my TSE in there instead. Then take a screenshot and wait till after the patch.
---
Shortly after the servers are up i'd post a heartfelt plea about how my legit TSE weapon was gone (even if it wasn't), how i spend so long and worked so hard to get it honestly. Look, here is a screenshot of my finding it so that's proof it's legit!
---
Then just sit back and watch the place explode. Probably by next day there will be articles and YT videos commenting on how Bethesda just deleted legit items from honest players.
---
Complaining about weird stuff? Try reading what place on your character a piece of armor goes on in german. The names are long and at the end comes (left arm) etc... but the inventory does not allow enough character space to display that.
---
Great job.
---
Why should there be a "massive swarm" of posts. Most people have quit already.
---
I did have a lovely walk from the dentist. Bit cold out but bright and sunny and lots of birds singing. Doesn't change the fact you are complaining about Bethesda addressing the duper problem.
---
I dunno, fucking over people who have no idea they benefitted from something is pretty messed up, man, particularly if they used all the in-game means. Punishing people for playing the game and accidentally taking advantage of an exploit they are absolutely unaware of due to several degrees and steps of separation is whack.
---
And man, don't get me started on how easy it is to get around those bans... Bethesda doesn't do hardware lock bans, just identification/name bans. It is trivial to get around that shit.
---
They're removing illegitimate items, simple as that. No shit show.
---
Adding new content, especially PAID content, to a fundamentally broken game is absurd.
---
Rip my 3* grognaks axe I’ll miss it ... if it’s duped. Is the the 3 star grog with bloodied more power attack and agility a common duped weapon or is it the strength stat one?
---
Melee builds are over powered for a reason, it takes skill and many, many levels to get a good build and then you run around the world with 10% health and simple weapons, it's not plug and play tse shit. 
---
Great list, made me laugh at least, but must admit it's very sad to realize it's not sci-fi, but parts of it can be the reality in a few hours...
---
Great spot and build!
---
Is your character a female Joker..?

I *HIGHLY* recommend you farm Fort Defiance for ballistic fibers, I come out with around 20 give or take per run, enough to maintain my 5 armor pieces over time (unless I go scorchbeast hunting without PA) and still keep some left over before hitting Fort Defiance again.  If not for Fort Defiance I'd be armorless mostly and poor and out of materials because when I build or craft, I go at it without restraint.
---
I hope you're right though, I do play legitimately which is why I'm upset before they even did anything, their track record is ATROCIOUS, in my time playing legitimately I've come across some oddities that I didn't even know were odd until I began frequenting this subreddit, and of course some of those oddities are debatable.  Is 5k .45 ammo duped?  Should I just avoid picking it up even though I desperately needed ammunition that wasn't .38 or .308?
---
How would I have known tse weapons have a drop rate of 1:300000 if I didn't come here and find out?
---
People shouldn't get screwed in a product they bought and legitimately struggled through playing just because:
---
A, Bethesda didn't fix their shit just to begin with, and
---
B, People don't browse the internet and just *know* about or *find out* about these issues
---
But I guess people should be punished for not spontaneously having information about something about a product that has no indication within or on the product and because the seller of that product can't **COMMUNICATE** their unlisted rules of what you can and can't do in that product.
---
If someone duped a bunch of materials and handed them out to give new players a better experience, how exactly is that wrong?  I get the pvp concerns with legendary weapons and armor, but I don't understand **why** innocent legitimate players should be punished for the developers screw ups.
---
Bethesda *fucked up*, and now they're making their customers who already paid just to access the game pay for the developers mistakes.
---
Why is that okay?  Why does everyone have *excuses* for why this is okay, and tf is wrong with everyone for thinking this is okay?
---
When a product is defective do you make your paying customers pay even more for it or do you try to fix the issue and make amends?  You'd think from some people on this subreddit that paying customers should just kill themselves or leave altogether screwed over if they have a problem with a product instead of actually voicing concerns in how to *properly* handle those problems.
---
Extremely sad state of society.  Multi-million dollar company releases half assed product with glaring exploitable issues, leaves those issues in without a single word of warning, then begins to punish anyone effected by their glaring oversights.  Cue the unnecessary debate on if it's okay or not like our ethical moral compasses are in the Bermuda Triangle.  If you paid money in the atom shop for an item that they delete because it was an oversight that they left in, would people be so lax?
---
This isn't a hard situation to figure out who wronged who here, it just seems like we're all losing our abilities to *empathize properly*.  The multi-million dollar company didn't do anything wrong, it's the people exploiting their glaringly broken and clearly exploitable product who are, punish them, not the creator of the problem but those who are even minisculey effected by it.
---
I'm done.  This world may very well be literally hell when the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
---
Sounds like every online multiplayer ever. Loud music that sucks, squeaker crying that he was killed or some troll spouting racist bullshit. Best bet is to mute all with constant Mic chatter or party chat
---
This is a good start. Especially with Bethesda's strange plan to make characters transfer over into the new survival mode. 
---
Ok bud... I'm just going on what I know about databases. Like I said before, I don't know enough about what they use specifically to say, but under each player's inventory, they have to have attributes, right? I'm sure their database includes more than just RefId and BaseID, right?
---
So, where the user has items, there should be something in that table when they run their select command to bring up inventories, theirs is likely going to have one column that represents a date/timestamp, right?
---
The difference between "going on a crafting binge" and duping would mean that the timestamp will be exactly the same on duped items, vs seconds or possibly milliseconds apart. 
---
Again, I admit that I don't know what they use specifically, but there HAS to be a timestamp somewhere.... but hey, maybe I'm wrong. 
---
I don't think there will be a melee nerf ... 1h, 2h and even the kinky fisting is balanced between them
---
I'd expect a change for ranged to behave the same as the melee multiplicative bonuses for who wants to do a specialized build
---
I run a hybrid (melee and rifles) and on melee I don't exceed 500 in normal circumstances, but can 1 hit almost everything in pwe 
---
Damn lol. They got the OP fired up. 
---
He is right, I had this happen with 3 chars and the fix was always the same: put every holotape where its possible in your stash, so only quest-related tapes remain (can't drop/stash them). List will be quite short after you do that, now it should work.
---
Of course you can just drop all tapes you dont need anymore. I like my story collections though, so I put them in the chest and pick them up again when I am done with the quest line.
---
Awesome reply. Reading about the perk system, that was something that I honestly thought would be great, and then of course I let myself be swayed by all the people who bitched and complained about that and nearly every other aspect of the game. Terminals and tapes were one of my absolute favorite things when I first got into the series so that was something else with this release that I'd really been looking forward to. I'm sure the lack of NPCs can take some getting used to but I kinda figured that would tie into the story and timeline and such.
---
Also the fact that you have 180+ hours in and are still finding new locations is super encouraging. Really appreciate the input!
---
I'm all for this....but if you have played the game and bought weapons from players. 99% of those weapons were duped so basically you get screwed out of caps. So even if you never duped ever like I have I still get screwed.
---
Bethesda leaked road map found:
---
1. Fix Duping
---
2. Realize... shit, we can do something here
---
3. Reintroduce duping
---
4. Nerf all TSE
---
5. Remove all duped weapons but "accidentally" remove all TS, E from all inventories
---
6. Fix this by removing all TS and E drops from the game to rebalance
---
7. Add TS, E to Lunchbox purchases ONLY
---
8. Profit.
---
My best guess they have a list of legendaries that are very popular when should be very rare and all those items will be erased regardless how they were obtained (duped or dropped from mob). This way unique ID is not needed. Players rage??? What players we are all beta testers for f2p online fallout (coming soon... Not to soon a lot of work left 😅)
---
Dang, you found me out.  My hat isn't  working as well as  it used to. 
---
In my friends list, theirs usually 4 to 5 playing. I only have about 17 personal real friends. If you look at Oxhorn on youtube, im pretty sure thats a few thousand still playing. I always look around the map after joining and its always full, 18 to 20 people walking around, im always seeing new players walking around flatwoods. 6 of the 10 worlds i join have nukes going. The reedit might make it seem the game is dying, but in reality it really isn't.
---
OP, would you ever forcefully spin the cylinder of a .44 revolver? 
---
The animators obviously thought that it would look "badass"... so they made the player character perform this move every single time he draws the gun.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doing this routinely is a really bad idea. But, hey - this would explain why my Voice Of Set breaks so g'damn often. Realism wins again, I guess.
---
If I log it and every weapon I have traded legitimate for is gone I'll just straight up uninstall the game. I've put in enough hours and got my moneys worth. Besides from the sound of the Inside the Vaults they literally don't plan on adding much to this game in the near future for people who want pve content. Guess I'll move onto Division 2. Maybe I'll come back. Who knows... probably... 
---
Nice Fallout twist on Martin Niemöller's quote, [**u/BrndyAlxndr**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BrndyAlxndr) 
---
He is sorta a big  kid. 
---
5. Remove all duped weapons but "accidentally" remove all TS, E, BE from all inventories
---
7. Remove TSE Nerf as they are rare again
---
8. Add TS, E to Lunchbox purchases ONLY
---
9. Profit.
---

They re-balanced explosives, but they only kill you now
---
I stopped playing months ago. Going to try again one day (and start a new character) and by then it will actually be a single player game.
---
Public mics never, im usually in a party with the cousin and if solo i mute my mic and turn chat off.
---
Removed Dupe weapons, by removing all guns.
---
Prison Servers would be the best thing, you don't have to ban people, the exploits don't have to be immediately fixed as honest players will continue to be honest.
---
Trust me, there will. Just wait till the patch is released.
---
i use full screen.
---
connect using hdmi
---
it is a 60hz AND a 60 inch   HA!!  while typing, i found on my sanyo menu, the ability to change from 60hz to 120hz.  see if this helps.
---
What, Bethesda lied? No...just like the bags are canvas and everything else? 
---
That's the spoiler.  An enclave time experiment gone severely wrong.  Appalachia is stuck in a time loop, ala Groundhog day.
---
This time the game will have a few alive NPCs and you redo quests with various changes and open vaults.  You get to the end and restart.  Won't end until you track down the overseer.
---
They are busy focusing on forcing people to play pvp, and melee while turning the game into more of a grind to worry about "Content".
---
I soent hours and hours farming caps, i used those caps to buy weapons off people through reddit because there is nonin game trade house or vendor. So when i paid 10,000 caps for my 2 shot explosive shotgun I thought i was buying something I would be able to use for awhile. Apparently it will get deleted now. 
---
Im not saying im going to quit. But i have over 400 hours in game and have never seen a tse pulled by me or anyone i know. This really does mean all tse will be gone from rhe game if they remove all duped items. I believe they were originally taken from the dev room. There's no way me and my fruends have farmed whitesprings this much and never seen one.  I dont think they want tse in the game at this point. 
---
I so3ent tons of caps collecting weapons from traders on reddit. If i log in and they are gone im gonna be pissed. 
---
Everyone needs someone to [talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/aqcmu6/fallout_strangers_discordgg8mmtbmm/?st=JS4I09GG&amp;sh=a85907ce) to...
---
Poor Bobby tables.
---
Some, yes, as a 'thanks for not just dipping out on us' kind of response, it'd be a good will gesture basically saying 'we screwed up, we apologize, we see you benefited *innocently* and will not touch your account.' And then they turn around to people holding 5 tse duped legendary guns and others with ludicrous amounts of resources, and other accounts with mule alts attached to them (and various other clear indicators of illicit behavior), and moderate them all for clearly exploiting the game.
---
You don't lump a, bad analogy but, you don't lump the person who unknowingly bought a stolen piece of bread in with the bread thief who's stealing.  That's lumping the innocent in with the guilty and dangerously encourages people to portray innocent people as guilty, worse is if it catches on suddenly anyone is guilty no matter how innocent they are if they had the misfortune of not knowing.
---
It's ridiculous.
---
I'm in the same boat man. I have 2 weapons I know are duped; an AA grog's axe and a TSE Gauss. I don't use them, so I won't be sad if they're gone.
---
I also have an AAE Handmade that I paid 10k for a couple weeks ago, and I love it. I haven't seen many for sale, but maybe 1 or 2 with the same stats. Fuck, I hope that one doesn't go. 
---
Nope just a realist. 
---
Because they know they're about to lose so much
---
I regularly play the ‘God is in his holy temple’ clip from Poltergeist 2 as I skulk about with other players in earshot...
---
I think alot of the grievers will still be in the normal mode while the other servers will be tied up with larger groups of try-hards who are targeting lone or smaller groups. 
---
It will turn into dayz on the new mode. Anyone see someone else they are going to try to kill them.
---
There's way more Unyielding sets duped than weapons
---
&gt; *objectively*
---
That word, it does not mean what you think it means.
---
But I thought the developers were malicious and lazy, hated fun, hated the community, and they want neither success nor money? Are you suggesting there may be reasonable albeit unfortunate reasons for any issues? 🤔
---
No its not. Its gonna piss off all the people who traded on reddit or bought from traders. There is no way to tell if an item is duped and since Bethesda didnt care for 3 months , no one else did. Ive never duped. But i damn sure bought like 10 tse guns over the last 2 months. They go for like 2k each. 
---
Who this is going to pisss off is people like me who just did what bethesda wanted us to do and trade among our selves. Fuck. It tho. Anthem is out in a week
---
(PS4)  
---
A few weeks ago I was sold a 2 shot dragon for 200 caps, I didn't think anything of it at the time, but I guess I'll find out later if it was duped or not.
---
I may get a few eye rolls at this question (I'm not in the PC Master Race, I'm an abhorrent console peasant), but is duping a problem across all platforms, or just PC?  If it is across all platforms, is it much easier to do on PC?
---
I hope that my quick crafting of dozens of boiled water doesn't get caught in the fire :/
---
Lol think of how many salty players will claim their weapons are legit. Gonna be just like the dupe bans. "I was banned for cRaFtInG?" Fully prepared to lose anything I didn't farm myself.
---
Have you been playing this game long? They have yet to be able to introduce a larger patch without it causing bigger issues. I have a average amount of coding experience, it almost seems like they are working with code they don't understand or never where apart of writing, like they are coming in after someone which is very hard to do.
---
It's always the assholes that say that, hell I should know I use to be like that in high school.
---
Maybe stop hoping other people lose all their time and effort.
---
I personally think this is the worst thing they could do at this point because it'll just kill off the population of people who aren't on Reddit and super invested into just ditching the game.
---
Then Bethesda stops trying to fix the pile of shit they sold us for full price and we all get fucked.
---
Like, Bethesda increase max item level to 80 and fix the dupe methods.
---
They literally just fixed it like that without doing the stupidest thing possible.
---
I am moderately interested in finding out if the two explosive shotguns I bought are dupes or not. No big deal either way lol but it should be interesting.
---
Nah, it was a joint effort.  More or less *everybody* worked together to fuck everything up.  About the only people who can't be blamed are the responders.
---
Once you install the lock it will be locked to everyone but you.  They can be picked but you can also set the difficulty.  Not sure if picking somebody's lock would give you a bounty though.
---
My weapons post is almost all stuff I farmed myself. If you're on PS4 then give it a look over
---
Seeing how they only implement very small fixes (currently only focusing on Scorchbeast, rad worms and removing duplicated items) I get the feeling that they have given up on the game and are moving resources towards Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI.
---
Why else would they not properly address the countless issues in this game? It's so sad. I mean, they didn't even test their previous patch, otherwise they would have noticed that it introduced a lot of old bugs.
---
So, I would not expect too much from the roadmap.
---
My best haul was 5-6ea of the assorted stable fluxes in some post queen killing along with about 1800 caps.
---
It's not the best and most logical thing to do. The best, most logical path is to warn the community that duped items will be removed, make sure that the duping exploits are *actually* patched through at least a couple of patches, and then remove the duped items and add content. 
---
And that's assuming that I think it's fair to take items away from people who didn't dupe--which I don't--or that the removal can be effected without causing more problems--which you don't, either.
---
F
---
FO76 has always been able to be played as a solo game. Teaming up how ever has benefits by speeding up and using less supplies to advance. 
---
If it does go it'll be whatever...  I have gauss plans, I'll farm Fort Defiance and make and scrap them until I unlock the suppressor (the part that makes the gun have a huge profile), but I'm worried I'll be missing armor, junk, and ammo too.  I'm running all legendary armor, some is 3*, I have NO CLUE if it's duped or not so if it goes along with my tse gauss, .45 ammo and my AA Vats crit bonus 2* combat rifle I'll be left with just a furious Handmade and possibly a few pieces of armor.
---
I didn't exploit, I shouldn't be punished as if I did, I played their bloody destitute game and utilized their bloody trade system, if I'm punished for it Bethesda can be like Bungie and never see another penny from me.  Won't accept abusive behavior from a damn company.
---
Yeah, the development of games have truly been mind blowing. When I finally got my fist PC my first game on it was Civilization. Now, when I play Civ6 and look back it is... amazing. While modern games might have bugs, it is nothing compared to the added complexity modern coding and hardware have given us access to. Got myself some VR-equipment recently. it is everything I dreamt of as a kid. 
---
Did they change something or are you just getting screwed by other low levels being around? I used to do the event every time it was up because it would spawn lvl 60+ mole miners but I haven't had much time to play the last couple weeks so its been awhile.
---
I've gotten 3 of my "best" weapons from it. A lvl 50 bloodied swing speed sledge, lvl 45 AA Glove with swing speed and +1 strength, and a lvl 45 Instigating Explosive The Dragon.
---
Guess I'll have to check the next time I'm on for longer then 10 minutes lol.
---
Yeah, probably.
---
You have this backwards. TSE weapons are supposed to be very rare; the "average joe" shouldnt have access to them from grinding cap stashes for a couple days. Really they shouldnt be widely available at all.
---
You can kill the Queen solo? Thats awesome man, grats.
---
It is funny how people shit on Bethesda for any reason. Even when they are making smart long term health of the game decisions. 
---
Ive got hundreds of hours trading and stuff in this game. Bethesda said they couldnt dobanything about the duped guns. So we all bought them. Spent tons of hours collecting caps to buy them. If i log in and they are gone im gonna be pissed. Thats tons of hours down the drain. All they had to do was say back then to not buy them because they will remove them. But they didnt. So people bought them, now here we are. 
---
No they're seizing all 'illegal' weapons.
---
Tse won't exist after patch
---
Fuck yeah man.
---
With any luck, neither will full sets of assassin sentinel armor. 
---
True 
---
Oh definitely you can legally stack legendaries. I did it at least twice. It's not that hard when you are grinding and those are generic 1* items. Two suppresor spears? No problemo. 7000 anti armor explosive weightless handmades? Huh...
---
Check my post history if you think i'm defending bethesda; especially the things i posted. They have a lot of work to do on Fallout 76 and deleting duped items proves they're on the right track.
---
It's funny to see how many people claim they were ignorant and didn't know that the shit they bought was duped. If you farmed legendaries for any amount of time you'll know that TSE isn't common at all. 
---
Yeah there will be enough players around, me and all others who didn't dupe or bough dupe shit. In real life if you use counterfeit money you can get in trouble and you will lose them. If you buy a stolen car you can lose it. It's how things should be.
---
Stop moaning. They managed to fix the duplication glitches in ESO, and if you played ESO on launch you would know that it was also a real shit show.  
---
Things will get better and purging all duped items is the first step in the right direction. Be glad that you only lost your glitched item. With ESO they permanently banned people. 
---
I stand next to the waste barrels for that.
---
But then what would we farm?
---
Gary?
---
Dude there are 10s of thousands of players on the fallout bazaar pages trading. Not a small fraction at all.
---
Is that from eating bad food?
---
It could be the drive, it would explain why it happens when you get to a new area, the game might have to load new assets from the drive. If you have a ssd, try to place the game on there if you have the space. If you have your os on ssd, it might be worth the test to make space on that drive. 
---
This is assuming that the 1TB drive is a hdd, if that's a wrong assumption, I'm sorry and then I don't know :)
---
Good luck!

I can kill her solo, but only for next 3 hours 😅

Every time I go in there, I spend ten-twenty minutes clearing it out and get...maybe four-six fiber, partially because it's so large and partially because it's so commonly targeted. 
---
Every so often when I'm low I'll server hop at Watoga. There's only a couple of spawns, but they're VERY quick to check. I also check a few other random spots, which have 1-3 per which are in areas I frequent. 
---
To my mind, the "what if Bethesda fucks up" angle is not to be ignored, for sure. That's my real concern. I wouldn't say a thousand rounds is a concern...I run around with about 3-5K, between .44, .45 and shotgun shells, plus the .308 and .10mil I hoard for my sister. 
---
But what if it is? What if you have, say, a hundred nuka quantum and they decide that's a "unreasonable volume" and decide it's duped? 
---
That's where my concern lies, not so much legitimate dupes being removed, even if they DO manage to track down traded items (which I highly doubt is going to be the case)...it'ed still be fair. 
---
I've put several hundred hours into this game. I've never seen a TSE. OR a AAE. I have on 3star gun, and it's a suppressors explosive with a run speed buff. It's "junk" by a lot of standards...and it was sold to a vendor in a nuke zone. 
---
I legitimately don't think you can spend any real time with this game and NOT know that someone selling multiple "god tier' weapons is probably duping/selling duped gear. 
---
But maybe I'm just jaded. Maybe I've spent to much time playing games like this, and I've seen where shit like this can go. 
---
A lot of the issues, in my mind, isn't just "oh wow people are selling TSE's for lots of caps". Part of the issue is, some people are making real money off duped weapons...it's a kinda sick trend that people are spending real world cash for these things. That's a problem bethesda can't let stand.
---
But as for duped mats, duped chems? Server stability's an issue. I don't know if you've ever played, say, fallout 4. But if you start a new play-through, your savefiles are small. 20mb or so. After you've been playing for a while and you have a mess of materials...it's more like 70-80mb. 
---
That data, especially with multiple accounts per server, can add up to be a pretty significant hit on servers. It can affect load times and stability. 
---
Bluntly speaking, a mass purge of duped items, if _handled properly_ IS a fix. It's a damn good one. It's also a fix that shouldn't have been needed, and if it were needed should have come a month or more ago when it started to become the massive fucking issue it has become. 
---
And I absolutely agree, that Bethesda's fucked up here, bigtime. But I  _don't_ agree that dupers are innocent victims. I don't agree that people who knowingly purchase duped items are innocent victims. 
---
And I hate to say it, but there is _no_ in game market. In order to purchase items, you pretty much _have_ to leave the game and venture into forums like this, and if you do, you _fucking well know_ that the _vast fucking majority_ of items in this game are, at least potentially, duped. 
---
Lead Belly, I know. And Iron Stomach for diseases.
---
&gt;  a Kalashnikov rifle that shoots NATO rounds.

What's odd about that?  There's the Valmet, the Gallil and the AK101. 
---
All pipboys deleted by anti-dupe code due to be identical.

Buggesthesda?
---
Then again, dupping.
---
Might be fun to see though. SB in the sky as far as the eye can see
---
"I swear these items aren't duped."
---
2 months later ....
---
Your character is super cute! Good job! I dig the armor you chose.
---
Yea you can. It is a pain in the ass and you will need top end gear with a shit load of stim packs and chems and will take a while. But it can be done. Now is it worth while to do it solo that is the 10 million dollar question. 
---
Everyone claims they didn't know the shit they bought was duped and funnily enough they're pissed about this maintenance before it even happened.
---
If they weren't aware or if they weren't at least suspicious about the shit they bought they wouldn't be freaking out right now. 
---
I'm so glad Bethesda is doing this...It only proves that they actually do care about the game and that dupers and people turning a blind eye to duping should go screw themselves.
---
Just use employee ID 1 (Todd Howard) and the password is 'CHESSCLUB'
---
Every problem they fix gets broken again at some point.....its inevitable that it will happen at least one more time.
---
"Feed the People" will definitely award 5000 cans, server-wide. Additionally, the pressence of 5000 cans in your inventory will trigger the exploiter detection system auto-ban feature. Game over.
---
I don't know man, they also say "any 
---
players who have received duped items in trade"...their statements are kind of contradictory, but I guess we will see later today.
---
Awe man, get FONV or FO3. Most people like FONV the most as the gunplay is a bit better and RPG elements are high, but I like both. 
---
I think you underestimate duping. More than likely if you traded for your instigating it's a dupe as well. Instigating and furious became the dupers choice after the Great TSE Nerf.
---
Thats just very incorrect lol
---
2 patches ago this event droppd lvl 50 loot, I swear to fuck. Ran it all the time. Now all I get is lvl 35 gear.
---
Im nearly 40, from Finland.
---
Long long time ago I played Fallout 1 and 2, I think I first played the first one, then later as the second one came out. All of them were pirated of course, CDs circling around friends. I remember a friend I got lots of games in high school, once found CIH virus from his computer when I was visiting him, he called a friend who also then found to have it, somehow I've never managed get any viruses.
---
I enjoyed the PC version of tactics, brotherhood or whatever the straght successor of F2 was. Played that few times trough too. Kinda always wondered the people who didn't like that much. Like what, did they have better games to play during that time. It's nice that Bethesda came along and kept doing Fallout games. I've never played their most popular Fallout game though, that mobile vault thing. I doubt I ever will.
---
I remember expecting and waiting F3 when it was coming, for about two years prior. I remember that old timer they had on their website, staring it. Yet when it came, I couldn't play it, didnd't have a proper computer. Even later, maybe about two years from release,  I had to play it with single core pentium 4 which wasn't really good, the performance was weak, I had sometimes crashes as the game overloaded. It was quite a stuggle.
---
For F4 I was much better preparred, started playing it amoung everyone else when it was released. Played Skyrim too, liked it a lot, still not super exited about it's successor.
---
First PC game I've played had been Alley cats on school, about -90, with computers that didn't have a HDD. I can't date exactly if the console I had as kid, was it before or after that. I had a Chinese NES clone named Dendy, made for Russian market where NES wasn't sold at all. They were not commonly sold in Finland but maybe few stores sold them in small amounts, technically they should have been illegal as hardware pirated copies. I've never later had a console. Some friends had nintendos, one had a Commodore 64, but after those few initial years everyone had a computer.
---
Ah, I thought it would scrap any armour on them, so I didn't try that. Thanks!

My first introduction to the Fallout universe was Tactics back in 2002, which to this day remains my favourite entry in the series; I picked it up at a mini-mall PlayStation and PC games store for £4.00. After that I came across Fallout 2 in a budget game bin and played that, though I should have played the first Fallout game first so I understood the backstory better! I managed to piece it together, however. It wasn’t until 2008 that I returned to the universe in the form of Fallout 3, which was one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played; my first run was mostly bad karma, after which I properly explored the worldspace and ultimately all of its DLCs in a good karma run, then did the same with the Mojave wasteland in 2010, coming back to it over the course of the next three years. I was given a copy of the first Fallout by a friend in 2015, and my first ending was siding with The Master and raiding Vault 13 with the Super Mutants. I got a PS4 with Fallout 4 as my first game for it in 2016, and played thoroughly through that and all of its DLCs, though I only went through the BoS and Railroad faction endings in the main game and the Raider ending for Nuka World. Last year I played through Wasteland 2 for the first time, and it’s definitely the sort of format I love most when it comes to games of this genre. Now I’m thoroughly enjoying the WV wasteland, and have been playing since the BETA though my only remaining character I chose to keep is below lvl 40. I’ve also been enjoying playing through different paths in the New California mod, and I’m looking forward to experiencing the Frontier, Miami, Cascadia and the Capital Wasteland and F4NV mods when they’re ready!
---
By small percent of player base they meant that this will affect only active players 😅
---
Individual pieces I mean. More people are gonna be pissed they have to track down armor than a weapon anyway
---
It was at a Whitesprings vendor after a nuke zone mixed in with a pile of other unremarkable items.  It doesn’t have god roll stats either.  The other vendors were filled with undesired legendaries too.  It was in its base form too (absolutely 0 mods and half condition). 
---
I just assumed I had good luck yesterday because I also stumbled on an X01 jetpack mod at Modus and a few marine dense torso mods for sale. 
---
because you are talking about Bethesda lol
---
What downside?  If an item only exists due to an exploit than anyone using that item is cheating.  Doesn't matter how ignorant the user is of the items creation.  
---
From the beginning, I intended to play this as a solo game with "optional" multiplayer interference. I don't see the patch tomorrow to changing anything to stop me from playing solo. I don't trade so the mass dupe removal is a nonissue.
---
If anything, when Bethesda moves to maintenance/skeleton crew mode, I hope they make FO76 offline compatible so people can keep playing.
---
That’s why even after crafting inside the resort I try not to forget to stash junk and get inside the power armor before logging out. Just in case.
---
You're getting downvoted by everyone who's mad about the update. It was funny. Good ref
---
Deleting these duped items and Giving players back "lost" items are 2 completely different things. I doubt they have the ability to check and see every single persons item history with their current engine. 
---
Jeez so cynical just stop playing or go take a break for a few months we don’t need these post there is enough toxicity 
---
Thank you. I guess it just went over peoples’ heads that the world already ended 25 years ago. 
---
not the worst outcome to have lol.
---
The game has \~2.5m sales
---
Well why dont you just go ahead and let us know when you decide its finally safe. 
---
Doubtful. Assassin Sentinel sets have been an issue though. I highly doubt the people selling them on fee-bay didn’t dupe them. 
---
Yeah, it is probable
---
Another server downtime , and another week goes by with no content. Goodbye FO76, you went exactly the way I planned, yet I thought I'd give you a chance anyway.
---
In some countries if you had no Idea it was obtained illegally the price you paid for said object would be returned to you eventually 
---
I am think we are going to see a lot of complaining post update. This sub and other FO76 Reddit subs attract the more dedicated player who trades. Just look at all the trading subs and posts. This update is going to hit us harder than the rest of the general players.
---
No warning should be given so dupers can be caught red handed and banned. Chances are that today's maintenance will fix some of the duping exploits and they're not revealing that for obvious reasons. They wouldn't remove duped items if a duplication method would still be in place. That's counterproductive. 
---
Most people were already aware they bought duped items, now they're just pleading ignorance and nah, i don't think they should be spared. 
---
Downloading the new update now downloads skyrim as well.. wouldn't be surprised to be honest 
---
Active, higher level players, that trade......that's.....US.
---
That 25k was cap stash exploiting anyways so who cares lol.
---
I'm Nicolas, 33yo from France. My very first games were on Nintendo, then I discovered Fallout 1 and couldn't wait for Fallout 2 to come out. I also play Minecraft, but other than those I'm not a huge gamer. 
---
&gt; Stimpaks now heal you immediately but deal damage over time
---
To be fair, that is how the super stims and trauma packs worked in the old ones
---
Yup. In my case, the pebble was likely blocking line-of-sight.
---
I don't remember any kids yelling anything. I've heard few of them speak to me.
---
You may be ok. Sounds like it was a legititimate drop that someone didn't want.
---
Not entirely true. I've had a pump action regular shotgun favorited, found a legendary variant, scrapped the regular, and now the legendary is showing up as the favorited. Seems that it might have to do with weapon type.
---
Or I need to make friends on this game and farm in numbers. 
---
Wish that had cared as much about ME Andromeda as they do about fucking redit.
---
I'm assuming you're worried you won't have any weapons left post patch. Lol
---
Fallout Kart 76. It has some ring to it, I might give that a go
---
Last time, I visited the Dark Bortherhood near Falkreath, the door asked me:
---
\-"*What is life's greatest illusion?*" 
---
At first I didn't know what to answer, then I replied:
---
"Bethesda fixes Fallout 76."
---
The door opened and answered:
---
 *-"Welcome home."* 
---
Brahmin could be both genders.  We’ve never see bull Brahmin in any Fallout game ever, and there are other examples of “fused” animals like possums (in 76, at least).
---
I would think max White Knight &amp; max Fix It Good would help combat any problems with durability and repairing.
---
I’m expecting this to be the case as it was not really in a usable condition. 
---
I do have a lvl 25 lever I’m concerned with though. Got it from the bot in Watoga, but it was fully kitted for a short range rifle build, though the hunter’s effect is reassuring. 
---
Solid gold!
---
nobody looses tomorrow.

---
Wipe out all your mutations then just buy the serums off players that can make them.  Twisted Muscles and Talons are must haves.  
---
Class freak will help with the side effects.  Avoid bird bones and egghead as they both negatively impact strength. 
---
For weapon I’d recommend a deathclaw gauntlet or death tambo. 
---
Yes why not, we see lots of complaining anyway.
---
If people lose some items they now have good reason to complaing, while a lot of people will complain about how way too few lost anything, even when obviously so much is duped.
---
Well ignorance is not much of a defense. If you bought a stolen bike you don't get to keep it when the owner wants it back. The ones who fucked people over were the dupers. 
---
All to many were more than willing to accept duped goods to speed up the grind to get top-tier stuff, which admittedly is terrible and should be looked at. To the point that last banwave we actually saw people defending exploiting and duping as a remedy for the grind.
---
If Bethesda doesn't act then you're stuck with the unfairness of some people having cheap high-end gear that is now so much harder to acquire. 
---
Look i get that people are going to be upset, this whole situation is bad and there is no outcome that is fair to everyone. The dupers really caused a lot of damage.
---
At any rate Bethesda can't very well let the illegitimate loot stick around, although i highly doubt they can actually get rid of all of it or even most of it.
---
If I pick one up I tend to shoot off any rounds it comes with just for fun.   
---
Yes you need to drop every holotape for it to work.  I got stuck with this a month ago, still not fixed.
---
Ended up losing all my holotapes though as had a disconnect shortly after.  It's stuff like this that makes me wonder what the dev team are actually fixing.  
---
&gt;For stealth builds, the best is a set of wood armors with Shroud mod.
---
Probably. I know that's what I'm going to do this week. Go hunting for "Weightless".
---
I nearly lost my shit picturing a dozen of me following me around bumping into me jerry for R&amp;M " hi my name is jerry, hi my name hi hi hi I'm jerry" I'd never get out of the trade menu with myself
---
Nukedcola , why you claim they do?
---
That would actually be a feature, I’ve had enough of scouring the map for stuff to kill!
---
Majority of the people here are, unfortunately, stupid. While this may seem an asshole take in the current situation, my own douchebagness served me well - I was able to predict most of the changes that happened in the game, and I was not once caught with my pants down after the changes - i.e. my god playstyle did not change at all after TSE nerf.
---
From this perspective, seeing these noobs that complain that they were oneshot by TSE guns and hence TSE must be nerfed (and I seen thousands of these bullshits), the only valid and fact based response I had for those was L2P.
---
While Im in agreement with most feature requests from the community, I see opinions of those who talk balance yet don't actually fight people nor learn how to do that as irrelevant.
---
When a creature is tamed it has to be walked back to camp so finding a tamed creature out an about isn't uncommon, especially if they fast traveled back and let it go on its own. But I don't think robots can be tamed since everything I've read is just people asking if they can be....no one actually confirming they can be. You probably just missed and hit something or someone in the distance though. Happened to me a couple times.
---
What about the ones I farmed the caps for and bought from other players. I did everything "right" I did not dup, I grinded evens and dailies to get enough caps to buy one from other players, just as Bethesda intended, just "fuck those people" right.
---
&gt;So they are essentially wiping all items with specific requisites?
---
No the joke it it clears the entire database. So if that database containts all ingame characters, they're all gone.
---
Correct but they might have added this code in with the first duping fix to make it possible to fix others in the future. And this way they can see a lot of accounts that kept finding duplication glitches and using them. Honestly if I were  programming this then the very first exploit I fixed for duping would have also had tracking code to enable me to track in the future if it happened again.
---
There was nothing. I captured the video afterward and rewatched it several times. There’s nothing in the backdrop unless I hit something that wasn’t rendered, in which case it’s still a bug. 
---
I'm sure you are biased in all aspects of life, but No - i'm worried that my allready dried out friendslist of about 30 will vanish completely while people like you - petty and jealous - think the game is great and hunting rifles should be plenty fun. LOL All you want, but the wrong people Will be Hurt a Lot by this.
---
I had a similar drop (it came nicely modded: scope, decent receiver... at a time when I could not mod anything except double barrel shotguns) and it was a game changer at the time. 
---
I outgrew it but stashed it for a long time because of nostalgia before finally selling it to a vendor.
---
He also thought the cloud was a one entity and had no idea about server regions. 
---
Most gamers know about server regions, makes me wonder how out of touch these people are.  
---
Ah, gotcha, that makes sense, well either way, it’s fingers crossed!
---
I doubt they will care about 5K+ ammos of one kind. If you are making 50 cal or 5mm rounds you can easily make that much at one time from a single lead run.
---
That should have been done within 24 hours after exploit was discovered along with an exploit fix. Right now they are just going to piss even more people off.
---

Nice to meet you

I'm betting he is jumping ship soon.   Writings on the wall in the form of taking a vacation right after launch.  Ghosting his Twitter account except for retweeting.  
---
I use my mic, and so far I’ve mostly come across people my age and older who have pretty clear mics without background noise. I’ve only heard kids in the background when someone was talking once, and encountered an aesthetically Raider-style player back when I turned lvl 6 who was giving grumpy and finger gun emoticons at me while laborously breathing and coughing into the mic and trying to spam grenades at me that were doing practically no damage whatsoever. Ultimately their buddy turned up with a shotgun they kept missing shots with and they went into team-chat because I couldn’t hear anything from either of them. I’m always very conscious of how I may sound through my own mic because it picks up every slightest sound and breath, and it’s not easy keeping it positioned in the ‘goldilocks zone’ where it’s not too far from my face that no-one can hear me, but other sound doesn’t get picked up. I just need to get a better mic, tbh, but people I’ve asked in-game have said the one I use now sounds ok.
---
From the downvotes, I’d say it’s the wrong choir, but not for the usual reasons.  
---
Some one hand me my two shot explosive pitchfork that was totally legit drop that I spent 500 hours grinding for since yesterday.  
---
At least you realize that you look like a hobo. ;)
---
I don't know if this is happened with anyone else but I figured I'd share. I bought an item from someone 2 weeks ago, a tse handmade.  I'll be honest at the time I figured it was duped but I never had one so I thought I'd give a go. I put it in my wheel but now every time I log back into the game it's not in my wheel and I have to replace it. Don't know if this is just me but it could be something to do with how they're tracking the items. This happen a 1 else?
---
When my caps were doubled because the same player couldn't accept the loss of the workshop. But I did wipe out a team of three once and one of them kept coming back and I made a fair bit of caps and junk of them too. All for a workshop as well.
---
Hahahahahahah
---
MMM, come to think of it, I picked up a lot of legendary armour at WS the one time. It was all in the cash register on the lower floor. Probably duped then. Aah well back to farming legendaries this weekend then.
---
Love that video 
---
On the plus side since then I've gotten a legit drop from a super mutant which is an explosive instigating handmade with plus 1 perception so as long as I have that I'm OK with this
---
They aren’t hard to solo for a stealth build. I should know, because I suck and I don’t have any good legendaries, only an armor-piercing lever rifle. It does take patience, though. 
---
I'm close to the Sunday brothers Cabin a short ways from Harpers Ferry.  I've been there a long time but the attacks didn't start during login until I hit lvl 50 which was just after the last patch.  Patch related maybe?  I just know its very annoying as I'm normally ready to prepare for a run and then have to waste a bunch of time, wish there was a invulnerable timer or something to at least let you completely spawn in before being attacked.  I did move my camp to the ground further out so now at least I spawn on the ground and not under my camp, so there's that. 
---
It would be funny if something like this happened on April fools day, just for the pure wtf it would get.
---
Huh, weird. That only happens to me when I accidentally un-favourite something in my inventory and then re-favourite it.
---
And No Man’s Sky and Destiny 2. 
---
😂😂😂 biased?? 😂😂😂😂
---
and in some countries buying stolen goods - knowingly or not - is also a crime.
---
kill them with the pointy end
---
I assume perks like lockpick and hacker were split to make it tougher for just one team member to share a single card and allow everyone on said team to break into anything.  Still annoying, though.
---
That's a bold statement to make, especially since you have absolutely no idea what most of their customers really want. Looking at sales numbers, what customers want is more Fallout 4, not more New Vegas.  
---
tl;dr Get out of your Reddit bubble.
---
I don't mind if they purge all the duped items. What bothers me is not that my weapon may be deleted but the thought of the player I bought it from simply keeping my 5000 caps. 
---
First one is puff, second will start e with you forever.
---
My 12,000 nuka quantums that I legit farmed with my brother are gone and bethesda you owe me!
---
Getting really excited to see what breaks tomorrow and also what still works. This game is so much more than just a game, it is a rollercoaster ride.
---
Mercury in serums? Flouride in "purified" water? Stimpaks causing autism? Salisbury Steaks making men sterile? 
---
Next you're telling me that the government is run by an unelected organization of technocratic elites...?
---
thanks for taking your time to reply!
---
I'm not following your reasoning. AA is practically *required* on low-damage weapons against armored enemies. A higher damage weapon has a better chance of penetrating the armor by itself. Am I missing something? 
---
/u/Aten_Ra is a fairly knowledgeable modder/member of 76.  Check out some of his bug reports on this sub if you get the chance.  
---
Pfft. Both shotguns will survive. The issue is they missed a line in the code and deleted the character that had TSE guns.
---
game is on hdd.  got a ssd for OS only.  it is only a 256gig and it has my power director on it for when i do video editing.
---
Typical fucking FO76 forum whinger, learn to laugh occasionally!
---
Yeah it's super weird I agree. However it's every single time I log back in so there has to be something going on there. Not sure what the hell's going on but it's something haha
---
I mean, a dev spending time on Reddit is a dev not spending time on the game, so we probably would lose our shit over that also. 
---
10000%

60 Hz should not limit in anyway you describe. Even at 2k your GPU should not collapse so hard.

He has a gaming chair.
---
Does this cork spark joy?
---
Hehehe
---
Ya and about 200k still playing.
---
It’s also possible they didn’t think they could, but someone found a clever way to compare past game states and discovered sufficient information was available to reconstruct the necessary history data.
---
You’re overcomplicating it abit I think. Maybe the person who takes your bag should be open to PVP so you don’t have to do the handshake thing? Would make it better to get your junk back. Plus you could get a notification that they took it, but what’s stepping them from relogging out?

A nuclear winter would only last a few years, so recent vault dwellers are about 20 years too late for a nuclear winter.

---
ok, so i went into my sanyo's menu.  found an option to run at 120hz.  selected it.  1st thing i noticed is my cursor does not move as smoothly on my screen.  booted up game.  seems every thing is running better.  no fps loss down to below 10.  lowest i have saw so far is 30.  went to WS train station, and all that slide show and 5 fps is gone.  it still stutters a few times, but fps stays above 40.  the stutter exists where ever i go.  it is a lot better than dropping fps's.
---
source?
---
But the difference in this full-wipe example would be that it was your choice to stop playing Spider Man on day 4; Insomniac Games didn't choose to wipe your save file on day 2 because other players wanted a full wipe to happen to make it equal for everyone again.
---
There is not anything on Bethesda about this.
---
Jokes on them! I deleted the game before they could delete anything!
---
Fallout 76 has been a dream, you wake up in the back of a cart...

There’s up to a minute delay when you kill something before it registers.

Can you fucking *blame* them?

The fact that the wieghts in the firestation are there everytime i check now.  Used to have to hop like crazy for stuff. Now everything is always there. There is waaaaaaaaaay less people playing than there used to be 
---
*thrust that shit in bitch* mm
---
Maybe when they finally create private servers it will be a thing for them at least.  
---
(Private mod-able servers are still going to be a thing, right?)
---
building in this game just sucks i've found. half the items are locked behind paywalls and even then they're just different walls and floor s etc. not as fun as fo4
---
Nothing to laugh about and this post just breeds more toxicity 
---
Sorry, this is a salt-only thread. 
---
I got the trophy. Now I only have to be at Ground Zero and the platinum is mine.
---
The reason is simple. Because they don't care. That has been quite obvious for many for a long time.
---
No they are unclaimed but everything. You build there is still there so when you claim it you get basically a second round of materials to add to what you’ve already built
---
Yep. The 10k shells is a dead giveaway.  
---
Ugh, but of course this IS a duping exploit, if only a very specific one (same as the acid duping exploit they fixed in an earlier patch). "I just wanted to make a few hundred pounds of leather out of wood and thin air!" won't work to un-flag your account...
---
You know what is real though?  My time and effort.
---
I mean I know your baiting me here, but I think we can expect them to mainly target the TSE gear. There might be other stuff but thier post seems to indicate they are doing targeted deletions. If I had to guess they probably can't really track which items were duped but they can do stuff like go on eBay and find the items folks are selling in bulk there (example of someone selling a "pick 4" bundle). From there is just a matter of saying delete all 2* LVL 50 TSE Combat Shotguns or delete all 3* LVL 50 TSE 15% VATS Fill Pipe Rifles (See those are my two weapons I traded for that I'm confident were duped because they are all over the place).

I don't think the store would have enough popcorn for me.
---
&gt;	but about meeting the enthusiasm of the community
---
What does this even mean, being on Reddit taking abuse instead of doing their jobs?
---
You're actually complaining because the devs want to fix a massive gamebreaking bug? Really? Your argumentation has no basis whatsoever because duping ruined the ingame economy and **literally devaluates** the stuff that's supposed to be the most powerful and rare stuff in the game. 
---
If that makes you want to leave the game... Good riddance!
---
Naw not over. I only have one bought tse, shire it may be gone when I get on in a few hours, but it's not even my main. I got my $60 worth, and I'll still be playing because I play for fun. Still fun
---
This should be expected since they released Skyrim many times without patching any of the game breaking bugs.
---
I don't buy any rpg from Bethesda on console anymore because of this, they force me to fix their shit with the console command but in fallout 76 you're just screwed.
---
I am pretty sure that, even if Bethesda do the "purge" perfectly right, you can be sure many many people will claim their so-called "legit" items have been deleted.
---
This will be interesting ;)
---
It's still a good farm. You get a plentiful amount to of legendaries in one area. Even though they don't drop great shit all the time it's still good for XP and caps
---
I think some people might be worrying about what else they'll screw up as a side effect of this. Then again, its not like they've not shown themselves to be incompetent with some patches, far from it. 
---
Yeah, about that....
---
i guess we will see. i've been a shotgun build mostly in all of fallout 4 and 76. i have a quad DB, TSE Combat and a TSE Pump. guess i'll have to go melee lol.
---
another note, it's prob Bethesda's thinking that by deleting some of the top level guns people will start farming to get their own. prob is we all know how random legendaries are. and the fact that alot of times 3\* still drop 1 or 2\* items. in around 90 hours i've never had a single gun that i farmed for more than a few levels. the rolls for legendaries are so random, it might take me 300 more hours to get what you want if you get it at all.
---
There were 666 comments when I came here.
---
LOL I made this comment before I knew about that. Today will be interesting. 
---
Obviously.. everyone's jumping on the bathesda bashing bandwagon, like it's the cool thing to do these days. Meanwhile they all sound like a bunch of wining cry babies QQ "I killed a 3 star and didn't get anything" QQ
---
Fuck yea man
---
I followed that link but I thought that was just someone spreading rumors. Why isn't that on Bethesda's inside the Vault? Nothing there. 
---
I'd buy you gold if I wasn't broke, lol
---
1st one will be taken away into the loving arms of  atodd and his holy glow
---
2nd one is a toughy, it could go as you don't know whether the seller had bought it off a duper to begin with OR he actually found it through the rng gods legitimately.
---
My prediction is 1st one gone and my hunch says the 2nd one will stay 
---
That is not going to be fun. Sorry that I lol'ed you, not cool on my part.
---
Let's see how badly they fuck this up, I know people will be posting that their "legit" items were removed, but they're bound to fuck up actual legit items too. Worried about my quad 2-shot explosive cryolator I bought just before all the duping really started.
---
Not only that, they had paid shills, PR/Marketting people waging war on their very customers in this subreddit. Downvoting them. Once I started pointing it out they stopped being so extreme with it. Now they downvote a lot of people to 1 and keep them at 1. They're trying to control the narrative to keep new players coming in. It's all about those initial sales. Even at 75% off. The more casual the better as they won't notice most of the biggest issues with the game until a at least about 100ish hours in. If they can even get to that by pushing through the bugs, crashes, disconnects, freeze, infinite load screens, etc. I wonder if it's a coincidence that one of the developers of Star Wars Galaxies also works on this game, and it was also self sabotaged in a spectacular fashion driving away masses of players time and time again before releasing a final expansion and then shutting down the servers. Maybe they found a model that works best for some twisted agenda. Get players to buy and then drive them away.
---
Ah, ok. Man that sucks
---
Elder Scrolls Online has that exact feature
---
The griefer community will be hit hard!
---
Wasnt the anthem demo awful? 
---
I've been following along closely with everything going on and had a feeling something like this would happen. Reason why I still haven't gotten the game yet. And trust me, I was super pumped to get it from the moment it was announced. It's pretty disappointing. I don't see any way the game is going to bounce back.
---
Reddit, discord, other online communities are, for every game, this one included, a very small fraction of the playerbase, and generally not very representative of the *average* player. Your personal friendslist is an even tinier irrelevant subset. 
---
You said you quit weeks ago, so your only idea about the state of the game is coming from the perceptions you get from negative posts here. The people making those posts are a small fraction of a fraction of people, who may or may not even play the game anymore (if they ever did). So let me give you my perception, as someone who pays the game daily, or at least several times a week. If there were only hundreds of players, or even just a couple thousand (across all platforms and time zones), I should be getting on empty servers, or at least servers with many of the same people every day. Instead, I get on servers with plenty of people that I've never seen before across all level ranges, from single digits to 2 and 300s, all the time. We still have to juggle servers sometimes, because I can't get onto servers with my friends, or vice versa, because the server is full.
---
This is bad logic, ever consider it might be different people complaining about what concerns them?
---
Photos or it never happened
---
Uninstalled. Finally lost all faith in beth.
---
Will never buy another bethseda or zenimax title.
---
Boycott for good.even if they someday make the best game ever I won't forget fallout 76.
---
Good riddance 
---
I think he is just having a bit of fun. 
---
Ok, I looked further. Guess that is a Bethesda person. I will have to start visiting that forum. ;)
---
You mention people saying it'd being obvious if someone has a stack of 200 items, but they could have stored 199 with the stash box glitch and be trading one to you, so you have no idea they have 199 more.
---
This patch is going to do more harm than good, dupers have already made a lot of caps selling items, the only people being harmed are the people who bought them.
---
Bethesda honestly has no fucking clue how to run an online game, and has shown this over and over.
---
i know player who bought all his duped gear with real money. I wish i could see his frustration after the patch
---
I'm not arguing against Bethesda's right to delete duped items. Just against the statement above that those who spend money on eBay have mental health issues and the implication that those who spend money in the atom shop don't. Not sure where what I said confused you about my stance on TOS violations. Since I never said anything about that.
---
Ditto
---
No worries man. Their "official" channels of support are all over the fucking place.
---
I'd love to have the junk walls back.
---
real question is would he have named himself Grahm-Grahm if he had 2 heads
---
If the dupers don’t get banned or total account wipes while their duped items are eliminated from everyone else’s inventory this will be infuriate a lot of people. 
---
If you’ve got a bunch of stacked legendaries (less say 5) there’s no way you got them legitimately without a thousand hours in game (maybe not even then, what are the odds of finding 5 identical, highly desirable, legendary guns?).  Just wipe those accounts and be done with it. No caps, no inventory, just a clean slate, otherwise they’ll just use their ill gotten caps to buy more items and resume duping with whatever the current method is. 
---
Well, for one thing, seeing what people have is different from verifying what people *used to have* and how they lost it.
---
Its not the end of the world mate. So we lose a few weapons ive got 3 tse guns bought off market sub's which are potentially at risk. Just grind a few days and buy something else at least we know it isn't duped then! 
---
If they did another weapon deletion though after this one then yeah I would be pissed off. Hopefully though this is the final chapter of dupegate and then we can all just crack on and enjoy the game.
---
If you're here on Reddit then you were aware that there was duping and you were aware what was being duped and when you rationalized that when you purchased that tse gun from mister rando with has 20,000 lbs worth of stuff in their inventory that you didn't KNOW it was duped so you couldn't be banned, right and you were doing nothing won't, right?... You KNEW what you were doing and you should have known the risks. You assumed they had no way to track duped items and there was no way that they would do any sort of wipe and now here we are. 
---
Yes there will be some innocent, naive players affected and they have my sympathies but anyone complaining here on Reddit should have known better and deserves what they get (and lose). 
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSyjcib_Fps) will be everybody after today's patch.
---
I see it often. I do it from time to time, but it only give out low level legendaries, (max at 10?)  so useless for me at 135.
---
I can imagine a stealth build would make it alot easier. I take a handful of stealth boys with me for the boiler room and crafting the mainframe cores when soloing. 
---
The people who bought duped weapons aren't "harmed" in any way.  If an item only exists because of an exploit than anyone using that item is cheating; regardless of the users ignorance.
---
The only "harm" done is to people who aren't cheating and lose caps/junk/workshops to the people who are.
---
Tbh I don't think we'd ever see eye to eye. I can't stand regular MMOs for more than 200 hours worth of gameplay.  
---
I've played games as short as 3-4 hours (To The Moon) and felt that was one of the best gaming experiences I've had all year.
---
That being said, it sounds like you'd enjoy MMOs or 'looter shooters'. Some examples including: WoW, GW2, Destiny 2, Anthem.  
---
Possibly the RPG angle might interest you more e.g. Divinity Original Sin 2 takes 60-100 hours to complete on the first playthrough (has great replayability + Game Master mode). 
---
It's hard to recommend anything else without knowing your interests / other games you really loved (&amp; why).

Real world trading is a legitimate issue, completely agree.

I agree with purging duped items, I just think serious care should be involved as that issue is not black and white and is a multifaceted shade of gray between developer behaviour, consumer behavior, and the principles of morality, in this instance, is it right to punish those whom benefited when they weren't actually doing anything wrong?  Why are they punished but the company that made it all possible in the first place isn't?  Why do paying customers get fucked but the company that sold them an exploitable product isn't?
---
It's a good fix only if done with mercy towards those unintentionally effected.  You throw a tse gun in front of a player struggling to get by for an affordable price and what, they're supposed to decline and negatively impact themselves because, because why?  Because Bethesda can't release a polished game?  No, absolutely not.  This is a hard game starting out.  Your weapons break often and are not cheap to repair, enemies gobble bullets like candy.  What's more armor doesn't last early on, isn't cheap to repair, and not only do enemies hit good, there's usually a *bloody fucking dozen of them* **at least* all eating your bullets, hitting your armor, costing you resources and stimpacks.  So right there you need junk, aid, ammo, just to maintain yourself, your gun, your armor.  Add in material costs on Camps.  Add in ridiculous cap prices at vendors and cap fees to fast travel and move your camp, suddenly you're in need of loot and money.
---
Someone comes along with a 3 star legendary weapon at level 15 for you for all of your caps and throws in some free ammo.  That gun will kill the enemies faster, saving you ammo, materials to repair armor and weapon, and saving you stimpacks.  You'll be able to actually clear areas and profit from looting the place, instead of evening out or losing out from the combat.
---
Lumping a desperate legit playing player in with dupers is cruel, you dangle food in front of a starving person they'll most likely eat it regardless of consequences.  You don't punish them for trying to stay alive.
---
Really fast, Fort Defiance is pretty big, it takes me an hour to scrounge the entire interior, there's usually 5 to 8 military ammo bags in the upper floors on the left hand wing of the building and some military grade duct tapes, I usually leave the place with 30+ pounds of scraped junk on top of like 1k+ worth of caps in straightjackets to help me buy bulk junk from vendors.
---
Anyways, dupers are NOT innocent.  I should make that clear, I'm not arguing for them.  I'm only arguing for players that came across duped items without knowing they're duped.  You can say people who trade *all* must go online to do so, except that's generalizing against all the people that trade random people they come across in hopes of anything from stimpacks to ammunition, they weren't looking for a legendary gun but when one is offered to you for cheap, why would you decline that?  Because a community said you should?  Because it's taboo?  But how so?  How should that player trading randoms know that an item is duplicated?  Everyone does NOT use the internet for easy access, some people legitimately play the game 'blind' in that they don't go online to watch youtube videos on what to do or forums for how to play, they just jump in and go.  I was one of them until rdr2 came out, then I visited the rdr sub a lot and even abandoned this game to play rdr2.  I didn't come back until after the tse nerf and I legitimately left because this game felt ridiculous, just hearing about rumors of duping made me say 'can jump and glide like some weird bunny-bird thing from mutations, plus fly if you have a jetpack, AND now a bunch of super powered guns are circulating like water down a mountain?  No thanks, not fallout!'
---
But a friend irl who lives up the street begged and begged, get on fo76 get on fo76!  Saw the tse nerf and said fiiiiine.
---
Then I began frequenting here and even then, I *just now* figured out AAE stands for anti armor explosive.  I don't want to say you're jaded, you simply, innocently, were just unaware that some people don't supplement their gameplay with foresight.  I still don't know how to or where to go to start the enclave mission and get mutation serums, my friend hooked me up with the few I have now.  I don't know how to min/max my build (or what that really means beyond trying to maximize damage output.)
---
I bought a tse Gauss Rifle for all my caps I had on me, then scrapped my current one.  It has better mods on it, suppressor and  piercing capacitor, it looked better, it was better and I'd have given them more stuff as compensation had they haggled further.  My point is, I saw something I wanted, I paid for it.  I don't know if it's a duped weapon as they only had three legendary weapons on them when I randomly traded them to sell stimpacks cause I rp a responder nurse (and have over 100 stimpacks and give them out to anyone with damage to their health) and then saw the weapon, plugged my mic in and begged for it.  I shouldn't be out those caps because of Bethesda's screw up.  They had other legendaries but I couldn't inspect them, I just saw a two shot gauss and fangirled then was surprised it was also explosive with +1 agility.  I considered myself *lucky* not *exploitative* and do not understand why I should be punished for playing the game and **chancing** upon a weapon I wanted in another players inventory then conducting a legitimate trade for it.
---
I can't argue though, I was blinded with desire for that weapon, I've loved the Gauss Rifle since NV, longer than my love for the Plasma Rifle since Fo4.  I had a twoshot plasma rifle in Fo4.  The only weapons in my stash are an endangerol syringer, a plasma flamer, plasma pistol, tse double barrel shotgun, tse combat shotgun, and a suppressor's powerfist (cause my mutations have me at 2 strength...). Take the shotguns, I got them for free from a rando and I know those are most likely dupes because of that.  But I *paid* for that gauss rifle, don't take *that* away.  That is my main weapon, my kamehameha gun.  It can't one shot lvl 50 watoga robots, it often clips through enemies and fails at hitting enemies in vats but I rock it well and adore it.  I jokingly say I cuddle with it at night.
---
I don't want to lose it because Bethesda can't get their shit straight.  I didn't get all excited over a normal gauss rifle that I bought from a vendor just to scrap it after buying a better version just for that version to get deleted on me because I didn't know it was a duped weapon that Bethesda *allowed* to happen.  I don't like losing stuff because of some other person's mistakes.
---
I just want to keep the rifle, I love that rifle...  It's not right it should be taken away punishing me for not knowing.
---
It's not right to me, not everyone deserves to lose a gun just because someone else duplicated it a whole bunch...
---
Only nerfs, never buffs.
---
For real! Actual intelligent dialogue between everyone and no "this game sucks, Beth should delete it" crap. If everyone could just chill and have fun instead of wanting to ride the hate train they'd find out this game is actually pretty fun.
---
Tell me later if you miss something. So i can laught at you.
---
if you cant fix the bug be friend with it 
---
A player posting to reddit that customer service told them they can't replace lost items is not the same as the developers saying they have no method to see inventories or identify items.  The tools a customer service agent has access to are going to be very different from the tools the development team has access to.  I'm not saying they're not going to screw this up, just pointing out that your title is misleading.
---
Great stuff, though I haven’t come across a single serum yet...I will keep my eye out! Thanks 
---
This is gonna suck. I spent like 75k caps for 4 TSE guns and I'm sure that is what they are going to be purging. At least I wasn't dumb enough to pay real $ for them.
---
It means he was definitely a duper.
---
Or! Buy leather from me!
---
I throw all bobbleheads and magazines in the trash anyway, i have no quality legendaries (only an instigator grognak axe but i wont really miss it) especially no tse. 
---
So i couldn't remotely care less if they're wiped
---
Im still holding to the hope that the game gets better, I rally havent experinced any game breaking bugs but I have seen countless visual glitches, and a few bugs that would prevent me for finishing a quest (oversier or golfer gouls) but I would definatly put the game down if I lose my stash or items that I have. Specially after everything I got is been done doing the grind of the game. 
---
will find out soon enough when I get off work fingers crossed!!!!!
---
Thanks, for me it was actually the display bug mentioned by OMG\_Laserguns above. If I sold or bought an item it would then display the correct amount of caps.
---
It turns out the game is perfectly playable without TSE. Even as ranged!
---
So if this is their way of ultimately dealing with dupes, can they dial back the nerfs on explosive and two shot? I finally got my first explosive weapon, a lever action with a Hunter's second star. I was enjoying it. Then they needed it 2 days later. 
---
Gonna just assume RIP
---
This is going to kill the game when half the people with TSE spent 3 weeks grinding caps to be able to afford one and now it just goes poof.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Most 3\* TSE are duped, even though I bought mine for 5k caps. So I will probably wake up tomorrow and not see my gun ever again.
---
So there's no way I could have farmed for caps and bought more than 1 legendary item from other people? Tell me how you came to that conclusion, I have to hear this lol
---
wow, how your build looks like?
---
But this is even more doubtful. How should Bethesda know, which ingame trade was paid with real money in outside their system?
---
But let's just wait and see what happens. I'll grab my popcorn and will enjoy this show :)
---
Just gave soooooo many up votes, on me dinner mad bored and this post just made me have a little chuckle.
---
Thanks :) 
---
If you gridded legendaries for any amount of time you would know how insanely rare good TSE weapons really are.
---
It shouldn't be such a outlandish thing to just assume that when someone is selling insanely rare weapons it's because they were duped.
---
Please let's stop claiming everyone is innocent and nobody knew they bought duped items. 
---
Oh yeah I have only managed to pick up one piece of sentinel armor so far, cool thanks for the tip
---
Your yard is getting double teamed with dookie
---
Bird bones is only -1 strength with maxed class freak and would be very useful paired with marsupial for your own death from above lol
---
Dupers and buyers gonna downvote, that's fine.
---
If someone offers you the best weapon in the game, be it for ingame money or real life money, you have to wonder why they don't keep it for themselves, especially in the very early stages of the game.
---
So I stay on my position : bought from a duper, you weren't innocent. 
---
best comment on here
---
i just showed how old I am :)
---
I hope that when they bring out some DLC, it is put on a brand new server and all must start a new character to access it. Only Atom purchased items can should cross over from current character to new DLC character.
---
I wish the map was bigger, and the further South-East you go, the higher the enemy levels increase....the enemy levels should be based off the location and a modifier based on your character level so that there are always some very difficult enemies that need a team to defeat such as a level 500SBQ
---
What about my full set of 3\* unyielding sentinel armor? Those were hard to buy!
---
Who cares? The loot system is complete unrewarding garbage. The dupers provided a service to make players experience actually more enjoyable. Imagine that. Public enemy number 1 was actually helping this game by providing players a way around the garbage loot system.
---
Ive literally never needed the 200 upgrade, ive never gone over 400, so i wouldn't really care anywsy
---
Yesterday I came by some dudes camp right by Geroges Junk Yard.  He had an open mic and was pretty clearly eating food as I could hear wet chewing sounds. I stopped by his camp, glitched in a window (tinker bench right in front of it) , and waited for him to notice me.  He belched very loudly into the mic, saw me, the started swearing at me for breaking into his camp when the door was locked (I wasn't destroying his camp or doing anything malicious). He immediately logged out but two seconds later came back to the same server.  I quickly glitched back in and went upstairs to play his piano so I would be there when he loaded in. The hilarity of his "Jesus Christ" when he finally loaded in was hilarious.
---
TLDR: Open mic, wet chewing sounds and belching player provided a bit of fun (though disgusting).
---
Pretty sure my TSE combat shotgun is duped, bought it here of course. But I did earn myself a furious explosive smg, so all I care about is the extra 20 stash space I’m gonna get lol
---
If they end up doing a full wipe and I loose my 2 builds I can live with that.
---
I haven't played much as some others, both of my builds are at level 40 and I've got a cool camp, but I'll settle for a working game if it ends up being a full wipe and I loose some stuff.
---
It may even bring me back to the game as I haven't played in over a month now 
---
I was waiting for the disconnect to happen all that time, but it didn't. Interesting to take note that there doesn't seem to be a server script that goes, 'only one player left, DC him because that is not feasible.'
---
They will know where the item came from within their system, not why it was traded or if money was exchanged outside their system. 
---
Duping has nothing to do with external sales, since those transactions are always concluded  by an in-game trade they can track.
---
Good thing I don’t play much. I mean the worst that will happen is I’ll lose a explosive two shot dragon of which I don’t use unless I’m hunting players. So I’m fine if I lose it I was given it by a friend of mine who got a couple cause he had the caps. And then there’s another friend of mine who had 300 legitimately collected purified water and lost it all and had a message about not duping and his friend still has 12k in aluminum 
---
Sure.  Those totally innocent people who had no way of knowing that a total stranger offering them a god tier weapon or full set of three star armor for a relative handful of caps had ABSOLUTELY no way of telling that something fishy was going on.  That's just how naturally full of good will your average human beings are.
---
Take your phony concern about "completely innocent" people losing their shit and shove it straight up your ass.  This is about as sincere as all of the people post TSE nerf who were freaking the fuck out but swore they never used the weapons because they were already so awesome at the game without them.
---
Yes I agree. I brought one for 4k, when the person asked a modest 3.5k. And Im fairly sure most duped items including the boring TSEs, will remain. They aren't close to even top weapons anymore, not after the TS and E nerfs.
---
I know I probably shouldn’t have done it but when a lvl 180 vends you a two shot handmade for only 600 caps I’m sorry but I’m gonna do it every time and if I lose my handmade I’m literally gonna be useless. But I guess I’ll just push through it because again I shouldn’t have done it. 
---
Well, we all do mystakes..  
---
though still uranium fewer is pretty decent, for few mins time get up to 3 legendaries and be able to repeat that by little server hopping, even if it is level 40 max you may get lucky and get some good items. In items, 10 levels are only 2 tiers, so not much big deal (I still use my lvl 40 explosive .44 and its more then decent, even after latest nerf patch).
---
has been happening a lot after the last update, I killed a few legendaries yesterday and I didnt get shit, best one was 5 caps, 3 aluminium and some 10 mm ammo :)
---
Yes, I have and you are right except, I have found god tier weapons that I sold because I simply didn't want it or have to room to hold it. Example: I found a 3* super sledge, ignore 50% of targets armor, 40% faster swing speed, +1 to strength. I legitimately found it, sold it for 4k caps. So you don't act like just because it's good doesn't mean someone wouldn't sell it.
---
Modus yes - but they just duped the whole leg with the shock attached.
---
My best and only weapon is a spiked sledgehammer at lvl 20. I have traded once, got 10 stimpaks. When I just started the game someone dropped every ultracite plan which I unlocked didnt knowing what it was. I'm expecting a total wipe of my lvl 21 char
---
Why would they differentiate between duped items bought with RL money and duped items bought with caps?
---
Oh I'm completely aware. But I like my guns with a little pop at the end haha There's already much more viable builds but I like what I have. No biggie if anything does go though I'll just make do with what I have for a few days wait for inflated prices to come down a bit and buy back what's missing from my inventory (hopefully nothing). 
---
Radicool and adrenal reaction are nice if you don't mind keeping some rads.  
---
There are lots of foods that give +10% melee (glowing meat steak, mutant dog steak...), and few chems that give +25% (I don't use them, so idk the names)
---
Yeah same, I only store junk for building and crafting and a couple weapons/gear that I feel I’ll need in the short future. No point in collecting nameless weapons that you’ll never use. Marie Kondo shit.
---
Is the bug the price it displays (200) or the price you receive (100)? Do you always get exactly half or half (rounded up)?
---
lvl 1xx nopvp, Busy sorting my stash at a station and i look up to see another player standing there. Put my headphones on and he was talking to me about fallout lore, pvp, how op he is at lvl 4x because he started over. I asked him if he needed help with any quests/map waypoints, said no. I got nervous. Someone else showed up and they started talking to each other and I said bye and left.
---
90% is duped. Not just TSE. Which is why im worried since i farmed Cap stashes and traded on Reddit to get my gear. Sucks that i might lose all my hard work while all the dupers have mountains of caps to rebuild. Just my opinion tho, we will see what happens after the patch.
---
I’ve been away from the team with Lone Wanderer but felt extra squishy so it looks like it never activated if you’re in a team.
---
Should be entertaining 
---
If you want better communication from Bethesda, you should follow their accounts and check in with them on a daily basis, to see if they have said anything.
---
For example. They said earlier this week that they will be providing some sort of roadmap for 2019.

It's fine to be critical. But I'm always amazed at the number of posts that ask for things that have already been answered to addressed. 
---
They've got two studios now though.  I've got a feeling BethAustin is working solely on this game at the moment while BethMaryland is working on ESVI and Starfield.
---
Definitely not.  There’s just too many problems with this game and that be the straw that breaks my brahmin’s back.  
---
"Thank you for your feedback, it has been sent nowhere because Bethesda don't exist in the Fallout universe."
---
Yeah I gave away most of the good stuff I found because of limited stash/inventory space and because I had a bunch of nice but most definitely duped items. I don't care if they are duped. I was actually enjoying the game. But like every patch, they manage to take what little enjoyment people can find away.
---
has anyone ever seen them actually poop? do they land first, or do it while flying? that would do some areal damage. call the event “duck and cover!” here come the pooping scorchbeasts!
---
This is exactly my thought, and I'm amazed at how many people expect the devs to magically be able to find n every single item that's ever been duped.  
---
This whole uproar has been hilariously misinformed and overblown. I'm laughing my ass off
---
They were dumb enough to pay real world dollars for lines of code that could easily be deleted. 
---
Not great but still good. 
---
Could be a risk one has to take if they so badly want to take someone's junk.
---
It will be a true post apocalyptic wasteland
---
And I do believe you but legit 3 stars god weapons are still insanely rare. I find it hard to believe that every Tse minigun griefer I encountered had legit weapons. And I met plenty of them. People would sell rare items but there wouldn't be so many people selling those said rare items. 
---
When will BS buggy updates be enough for you?
---
I like the looting system. It's one of the only things I enjoy in fallout 76 
---
Is this group therapy? I also have something to share.
---
Mr fuckin moneybags over here.
---
I use lvl 50 All Rise - with perks it does 300+ dmg per hit plus it is light! Carry a lvl 40 All Rise as a backup when the first one breaks in combat.
---
What’s that going to do tho.  They will just say it got deleted because their “system” detected that your items were duped or from a duper.  
---
Id honestly bet this would happen, but maybe minus any picture proof for extra lazy points lol
---
Just another failed attempt to break the game more and see how much of a push over people that play this game are.  
---
Nothing quite like having to break down two thousand of each of the vegetable starch components. I bulked the fertiliser and sold it over the following weeks.
---
So wait if I traded someone for an item they possibly duped then it’s gone?
---
&gt;\-elite
---
What about you gather items around you. If someone kill you, he get everything, but when you survive for 20 minutes you get the double amount
---
Yeah sure. You love getting mutant wooden legs, and nocturnal robot arms, and drills from 3 star legendaries. I get it. You  love to waste your time.
---
How dare you call an Chameleon Wood Chest Piece uninteresting!
---
Yeah 25 years is a pretty decent amount of time for the actual fallout to clear.
---
I think I speak for everyone here in saying you're a fucking idiot.  There's a difference between a team of coders working on a script that can scour an entire player database looking for VERY specific item IDs during a server downtime and expecting a customer support rep to have access to said database and taking the time to manually go through and restore shit people swear they had but totally disappeared.
---
Even the most successful MMOs out there don't regularly do item restores outside of EXTREME situations and even then restrict this shit to a one time only offer.
---
I get you. It will be interesting to see what actually happens after all this. We might just be being overly paranoid and they could just be wiping the dupers and their mules stashes with excessive amounts of items. I imagine it would be quite difficult for them to follow an item that has changed hands a few times.
---
A part of me thinks Beth is trying to torpedo the game at this point and cut any costs for further development. After the pretty blatant "SPEND MONEY IN THE ATOM SHOP" from the last inside the vault I've got to wonder if f76 has fallen far behind projections and is considered non-sustainable from their profit model. 
---
Yep.  I would love to love this game but Beth has been doing a good job sure that it will not happen. 
---
Duped players will delete themselves.
---
One good reason is it feed you more, and some provide certain buffs.
---
OP = 😭😭😭
---
You have 5 stacked legendaries?  Only way they stack is if they’re identical.  
---
Disconnects to be reduced, this is the real news (if works)
---
Sick of having no lead, and getting d/c after capping three workshops
---
You paid real world dollars for lines of code that could be easily deleted, hence the rollback on fixes last patch. ;)
---
Sounds like it, only time will tell really.
---
Honestly I wouldn't move a thing from where it's at now.  For me, it provides just enough mitigation, survival, damage and fun. :)
---
Maybe they are really using different Snapshot Backups to be able to track the unique item IDs.
---
However, this will end in an shitstorm that might reduce the active player base even further.
---
Yeah I get to sell those crap items and I'm buying plans for my camp 
---
"We know you don't have that much of a good weapon because we made it near mathematically impossible to even get any good weapon!"
---
"Well thanks for at least admitting that you don't want to reward players"
---
God I would LOVE To hear rain hitting the tarp of my tent.  I don’t even think that is slightly on Bethesda’s radar tho.
---
Probably depends on your build. "Bloodied" is the version you had I'm guessing. The damage output on the sword isn't as good as the 2-handed weapon, but with the right perk card builds and supporting armor, it could do some major damage. People that run "bloodied", tend to keep their health as low as possible, while also buffing the hell out of themselves with certain armors and chems. The issue I found with the sword is that the modification you can add to it (heated), only adds energy damage, which is very underwhelming right now. There's going to be a patch to possibly make that better though.
---
Salt levels: off the scale
---
Agreed. We already have the Ice Machine, Milk Machine, &amp; Nuka-Cola Machine. Those could all function perfectly for the "fridge" idea. Changing some numbers around to make it so food doesn't spoil in any stash box would be much easier for Beth to do than actually creating a whole new fridge asset.
---
Ty &lt;3 
---
Yeah that's what i'm thinking. Timing is key, if they did it after the fix for duping they could even delete all weapons and people wouldn't be so mad or frustrated. I'll just wait for the update before i try to make my conclusions. Hopefully it's just the blantant dupers. We shall see
---
I'm level 101 and got vaccinated (AVR Medical Center bit) and then set the main quest aside. I finally joined the Fire Breathers last week. Been an Enclave general since lvl 50 tho.
---
I actually got a TSE Combat shotgun as a drop.
---
Still wouldn't be surprised if its gone tomorrow because Bethesda.
---
"I TOLD YOU JUST TO GET RID OF THE DUPED ITEMS"
---
"WE DID"
---
Yeah have fun fast travelling to 7 vendors every day for your 1400 caps and endlessly farming Whitesprings for trash. That's the end game content you deserve.
---
I know this game is shallow in people I find lobbies and people in the lobbies I’ve met before unlike first few weeks that would like never happen 
---
I haven't had any expire on me, but as some of the other commenters mention, there are a few that do not trigger the way they should. I haven't had "big game hunt" trigger since the first couple of weeks into the game (playing since launch) and I've talked to the huntmaster, hopped servers, shot the damned thing out of frustration, and nothing. Submitted a report to support and crickets. they have bigger fish to fry though, so kind of understandable. 
---
Also, for well over a month now, I have not received rewards, xp, or caps from swarm of suitors, anyone else seeing this? (thats when the swarms or leaders actually spawn correctly). I've done it at least a few times a week since the new year and nothing. 
---
Other players might be looking into those tickets too.
---
Clearly nobody realizes cows are female..... and if you say she's not a cow, she's a Brahmin, look at those giant fucking udders.
---
For balance purposes, all non-energy type weapons, including melee, have been nerfed  to line up with Energy weapon's damage output. The game was designed around energy weapons being the best weapons in the game, and it was an error that they were not.
---
We have double the required materials to produce all non-energy ammunition. Ammunition was too readily available in the game and outside of original design guidelines.
---
We have tripled the health pools of all NPCs level 40 and above. We have found that the game too easy and we want the game to be hard and tedious.
---
Players have been removed from the game. We found that our main issue is player moral. We have removed all players from the game so that the Dev team can again enjoy the game.
---
Uraaaaanium fever is spreading all around....
---
Players: Your Survival PvP mode will be a shit show as long as everyone has TSE everything and a million duped god-items, it's just not fair!
---
Bethesda: *nerfs TSE and removes duped god-items*
---
Players: 😲
---
They mentioned it will be at least 1 year after launch before they consider Mods.   Dont recall anything specific about Private Servers.
---
Yeah I agree.  I might actually log in just to see the aftermath.
---
What are you doing?? You made a profile with "obvious" in it and go around saying obvious things? Yea, All these nerfs instead of fixes makes me sad. I'm not ashamed to admit that.
---
Cork never Sparks joy.  Never.
---
Actually, I feel this will makes caps more valuable and will feed into cap selling websites ( are there really cap selling websites?!?!). The price of legit non-duped hard to get weapons is now going to sky rocket.
---
Being a dick doesn’t make your comment contribute anything.
---
I’m asking for a roadmap of planned content, not a generalized roadmap of Bethesda’s plans.  
---
Their plans for the last 90 days has been to perform alpha/beta level but fixing. 
---
I’m always amazed by people trying to be smart asses who themselves didn’t clearly read and understand the precise quote they were quoting.
---
Uranium Fever has done and got me down :(
---
Never. bought. anything.
---
Especially after the duping glitches were made public. It was clear that a purge would come. And when I read "bought my TSE and I think it's duped" - you shouldn't have in the first way. The fence is no better than the thief or the con-man in this case. Happy purging everyone!
---
In addition to the points other have made, I think you are misunderstanding what Bethesda is most likely doing here. They aren't looking into individual accounts for dupers, what they are probably doing is loading a script that runs when you first login after the update. The script would look for certain item codes and if the player has over x amount if them, delete them. There is probably more too it than that but without being one of the devs, this is the best guess at what is going on.
---
The only good weapon i got on my own was a lv 40 anti-armour limb damage gorgnak's. If I ever come back to the game I guess I'll at least have that.
---
The building cap is what does it for me. I want to be able to go out looking for resources to add walls and decorations to a fucking castle, not a campsite 
---
That.... That doesn't have anything to do with what they're doing today.
---
Or maybe...just mayyyyyyybe...those waves were really just droplets.
---
Yes, each misstep pisses people off. But how many knew about the missteps? How many cared? How many got pissed enough to want to quit? How many said so? How many actually followed through? And how many stayed away?
---
Truth is, none of us know for sure, but odds are that the "waves" of people leaving weren't as impactful as you imagine. There's no way they're keeping the servers online for "a couple hundred" people.
---
because god forbid you attack another player in a pvp optional multiplayer game
---
No prob! I personally don't run any type of bloodied weapon, because I don't want to run a build that way.. I usually sell the off as soon as I get them.  I'm sure others may have some input as well. 
---
I hope so
---
And this is exactly why I haven't sold my prime automatic handmade plan yet. The sandwich heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor
---
Heh, Dupe-Day. 14/02/2019.
---
Never traded a single thing to anyone, nor did I ever pick up anyone elses items (cept ammo dropped at trains).
---
So, I will be amused at reading all the hate posts from the cheaters.
---
I can tell you what it won't fix - server stability.
---
They state that each time, and it never gets better!
---
Only they know that. 
---
Well shoulda expect it from Bethesda. They lie about everything in their games
---
I wonder if they are just going after the stacks of obvious dupes or they are tracking down the ones that were sold to everyone.   I hope its the latter and not the former.
---
Eh, I am willing to lose all my items as long as the dupes get nuked in the process!
---
If they properly track the unique item IDs, what shitstorm?
---
People bought TSE etc knowing that these were being duped.
---
Hamlin’s Razor. 
---
&gt; Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. 
---
This dude actually suggesting it's fine to punish players for purchasing something from a fucking NPC vendor.
---
I admire the fact that you don't make assumptions as to OP's gender! I get referred to as 'sir' or 'bro' or 'that guy' ALL. THE. TIME. I am most emphatically none of those things.
---
Hopefully you didn't spend real money on it like some other idiots out there. 
---
I'm sure a couple of my weapons will be gone. I don't actually know if they were duped, but they were TSE's... I sure as hell wish I didn't already sell off my explosive pump shotty that I got from a Whitespring run
---
Holy shit, is that bug still around?  That was a problem in *Morrowind*.  It's also been fixed (by modders) in Morrowind for years now.  Shouldn't come as a surprise that Bethesda can't fix it.
---
Anyone else still losing ammo when picking fruits and such
---
Bunker buster was your reward for joining the brotherhood. 
---
The explosive perks are not useless, they just aren’t as overpowered as they were before. 
---
To answer your question, there is no one answer. There’s a best for each weapon type and play style. 
---
For example, instigating is +100% damage on the first shot if the target is at full health. This favors weapons that do a lot of damage per shot, like the dragon, fat man, missile launcher, harpoon gun, etc
---
Furious works well for low-damage high rate of fire weapons like the mini gun and light machine gun. After a few hits, the shots are doing 1.3x damage
---
The one that I personally think is best is anti-armor for all the ballistic weapons in between. It ignores 50% of armor - and EVERYTHING has an armor rating. 
---
I am a stealth sniper build and I use an instigating explosive rifle, with an anti-armor handmade as a backup for close quarters combat. 
---
Others will have to speak to melee weapons. 
---
That being said, Bunker Buster is a good weapon. Hang on to it. 
---
There's a bug with favorites after patch 5 - do you happen to have 2 handmades?  That would cause the bug.
---
I’m worried actually. I know I’ve made over 4000 throwing knives and scrapped them because I just always have shit-tons of steel, and why not convert it directly to xp? I don’t think I trust Bethesda to know the difference between crafting to turn junk into xp and some one exploiting glitches in the game.
---
Naked except clothing is pretty viable. 15 strength 15 agility 4 charisma and 5 endurance and wasteland wanderer and all the armor perks and a nice shielded enclave under armor. Nothing ever breaks.
---
It's likely that they said "may" in case they miss some, so they can come back later for round 2.
---
If they say (or imply) that this is the only time they have to do it, and all duped items WILL be gone later today, people will breathe a sigh of relief when they log in and find their stuff untouched. They'll go on thinking they have no duped items.
---
Then, a month from now Bethesda has to rerun the script, if those "safe" items disappear, people will freak out. It's a basic soft CYA.
---
I would say unique identifier at time it's found/looted.  Then when duped, all of the duped copies have the same number.
---
Sorry but the only person here being a dick is you. 
---
You got showed up, and you are to small of a person to admit it.
---
I'm always amazed at people that act like you. Overly arrogant and then a child when shot down with one fact. 
---
What I contributed was actual information. 
---
Oh hi EA! I didn't see you there with your corpulent cash stuffed carcass, eyeing me up like a fat sucker with nothing better to do with my life than treadmill money into your bottomless predatory maw. How've you been?
---
I could see them dialing the effects back up but I doubt it will go back to the pre-nerf level. 
---
Now you're thinking outside the box, because you threw away the box!
---
Yep, I'll be reopening my shop tomorrow. I've only sold stuff that I've legitimately gained, and will still have 100% of my shops inventory.
---
Do you really want to grind through all the game again,no plans,no camp, xp really reduced ? No clearly not,especially because bethesda wasn't able to deal with some dupe bugs
---
Reactive plates?
---
You contributed information, just not any information relevant to my most or helpful to your argument.  Read my post.  Read their comment that you linked.  Use some basic critical thinking. 
---
I’m not going to waste more clicks to teach you how to read.  
---
Good that you recorded it. If they’ve figured out an exploit and are actively using it they should be banned. It’s unfortunate that the game is such a shitshow, and even though I still enjoy playing it, I’m starting to lose faith that Bethesda will keep supporting it, and issues like yours will just go on without being addressed.
---
Databases track all entries made.  Historic transactions are recorded in the transaction logs. 
---
Backups are done at least on 30 mins basis for Incremental or Differential modes (at least, doubt its Full).
---
All you need to do is correlate entries in the databases when items are dropped and also when items are picked up.
---
Then you can also track based on location data/Account information on when others pick up said items.  Thus 1 account loses item, another account gains item.   Pretty sure, it tracks location data on where item was found, it has to when dropping it for visual display.
---
Make a few powershell scripts that will do the cross-referencing and let it rip!
---
Thus any one that was flagged as duper gets nailed and anyone else who trades with said duper gets nailed.
---
Not sure if they are doing the "trades with said duper gets nailed" part though.  They were not clear on that.  All they said was " It’s also important to note that only a small percentage of accounts  currently have duped items, which means the vast majority of players  will not be affected by this action. " 
---
I have the same issue but I don’t have anyone to bump me. It’s very frustrating. Has anyone else had this issue? Thanks!
---
Good joke aside, I am 76% convinced that it will undo the nerf to TSE.
---
4,000 - 6,000 caps?  WTF!  That’s a lot of caps brah
---
&gt;Simpler. Just looked for stacked legendaries. Ever had two identical weapons stack even when configured exactly the same?  I haven’t seen it happen with anything of mine, only with dupers.
---
...but there's no need to run a big and possibly error prone deletion script for that. Just ban the account. You get the same effect. All the items are out of the pool and the source is removed. You would only run something like this to re-balance an economy where a significant number of these items have bled into overall market which makes the "small percentage" comment seem strange. If it's such a small percentage and you can track the sources, why bother?
---
The fact the items exist at all, shows they do not exist due to exploits period. I am level 170 and have only found 1 TSE which was a pump shotty with reduced weight. Over 200 hours of playing. Now i am getting shit for wanting the good stuff? Bethesda made it a main point of the game. Player trading... 
---
*Duped items, plural. This, to me, suggests storage accounts and mass  trades of duped items, not "This one guy bought one TSE shotgun".* 
---
I think that's your hope. I think they will take the gloves off and will purge e.v.e.r.y. freaking dupe they can find.
---
I hope they hit anyone that traded with the account that was flagged with dupped weapons as well.
---
Probably yes
---
If this wasn’t a distinct possibility it might be pretty damn funny!! 
---
Probably reactive plates or some reflecting damage affix on a piece of armor.  And you owning a workshop makes you fair game for PVP.
---
Gotta be careful with that stuff.
---
I’m guessing you have reactive plates or Tesla plates on your armor (or a mutation like them). When they hit you, your armor killed them and that gave you the wanted. 
---
That was addressed in the video and the counter point was: a series of regrettable mistakes at every turn indicate possible intention rather than stupidity. 
---
Kinda like 1 mistake is an accident, 2 is a coincidence, 3 and someone is fucking with you. 
---
He was saying they probably didnt come from a legitiment sorce
---
&gt; “Feed the People” gives all players canned goods again. Unfortunately it is 5000 cans instead of 5, resulting in instant over encumbrance server wide.
---
You also get banned for having too many items instantly.
---
I hope to God I never meet you in game, I would genuinely break something in an effort to get away
---
That song terrifies me, my dad used to sit outside my door and sing it as I was trying to go to sleep for weeks after we watched the first Poltergeist movie (I was 7 - born the same year as Heather O'Rourke). My dad was such an arsehole :D
---
I know my weapons aren’t duped because I picked them up of my enemies corpses.
---
It's just intelligent use of game mechanics. And I'm not support for Bethesda, so waste their time with it.
---
Those bastards are going after the three star rolling pins, aren't they?  
---
It's how they are increasing the Stash limit. LOL. No seriously. There's going to be lots and lots of lying tomorrow I think.
---
I second that.  I easily craft 3k ammo at once when farming lead/steel.
---
You should try reading AND comprehending. Read the original question, then comprehend what he/she is trying to say and then read my answer. I don’t think a player being purchasing  anything from a vendor should be punished.. but Somehow, some way, as with many things in this dolt of a game, Bethesda will find a way to F it up and take em from you.   
---
Go pop an intelligence bobblehead young buck.
---
by "without" I mean with less \*
---
I love seeing people use the landscape creatively, this is excellent!
---
Good lord, that's all there is left to do in this game now.  If there are 10 players in the game, 8 of them are at White Spring.  
---
Well according to Bethesda...
---
" It’s also important to note that only a small percentage of accounts  currently have duped items, which means the vast majority of players  will not be affected by this action. "
---
So only a small percentage of people wil be pissed while majority will be happy.
---
If both my weapons are gone, I'm not sure what the heck i'm gonna do. knife my way to greatness i suppose
---
Okay..
---
Well first off thanks for one of the quickest and most informative replies I've gotten yet on forums.
---
Secondly, is it really worth hanging on to? Just realised I forgot to mention that I got it as a level 40 weapon. Its damage is listed as 151, whereas the damage of a random, regular (level 50) launcher that I picked up is listed as 160.
---
Knowing that I can get the targeting computer and triple barrel as plans, I already took off the computer to make it lighter. It only has the triple barrel now so I can more easily (for the time being) make some space by getting rid of a little missile stockpile of mine.
---
So I gotta be missing something about the value here? Or was it just down to the fact that I forgot to mention the level? This BTW, was the reason that I decided to stop doing most quests until I got to level 50, which I've been for months now. Gotten distracted from the game.
---
But do you really expect Bethesda to execute this patch correctly?  I have zero faith they will.  I’ve made or earned my shit legitimately but I’m fully prepared they will fuck something up royally because well, that’s what they do.  
---
So if someone offered a 3 * tse handmade on the
---
True! 
---
I have 4 characters on my 1 account. 1 main, 1 weapons mule, 1 armour mule and 1 aid/junk/ammo mule. My main intentions was to save all this and sell/trade properly once the game allows us to set up vendor bots or trade posts. 
---
I suppose the good thing to come of this will be my TSE pump shotty reduced weight, that i actually farmed myself surely will not be deleted? Unless beth screw up again? Already had issues of weapons missing and once had someone elses character as my own. Logged on to some spanish named guy level 34.
---
yeah i feel like if they added new content at the same time it would have been better for them. either some new dlc like add new weapons/armor or have max level weapons or armor upgrade to level 60 or 70. or some new modifiers for legendaries.
---
&gt; came out with his review of Fallout 76 a week or so ago 
---
I thought that was a pretty fair review as well.
---
I wanted to downvote because you said it’s pop, but your explanation is so good. I’m torn
---
This is super weird. Any chance you have the Electrically Charged mutation? I had it triggered by my buddy's decontamination shower the other day when I walked through it 😅
---
Also, I know some ppl think it's lame, but keeping pacifist mode on prevents you doing *any* kind of accidental damage to other players. It's saved me a lot of hassles from mutations, explosive weapons, and my beloved Tesla rifle.
---
“Good thing I have 2,000 backup weapons in my cache” 
---
Or 
---
“hey let me make you a really good deal on that 2000dmg shotgun” 
---
Workshop is irrelevant. The attacking player would’ve been flagged as hostile and done full damage. The problem is the plates bypassing slap damage. 
---
I saw that guy once.
---
Imagine the post.
---
"I grind for 2 months Whitespring sell trash drop every day 1400 caps to 7 vendors, 2 months hundreds of hours, I buy items on reddit and now all my armor and weapons are all gone."
---
Good game! Hey at least there will be "less" cheaters.
---
people and organizations lie all the time. what makes bethesda stand out to the rest of normal society? 
---
other companies have been embroiled in controversies like bethesda right now. just give them time to recoup and it’ll all be okay. 
---
Sooooo this is the Fallout 76 subreddit. You'll want to send this to the Bethesda Support Staff, bud.

/r/iamverybadassdeluxe
---
You're kidding yourself if you think they won't find some other way to game the system.
---
And I think you should pop a perception bobblehead and see that I wasn't responding to you, but the guy who actually tried to say your proposed bug was a rational idea.
---
...young buck.
---
You should keep waiting until it’s all over
---
heck with stash weight.  they need to up carry weight.  Being required to have less than 3 weapons due to weight issues really kills what I really want to do, which is have a weapon for any situation i'm in.  I understand not being able to carry lots of heavy weapons but come on, a shotgun and rifle sets be back 50 pounds
---
Not anymore....
---
The chances of getting a single TSE is miniscule.   Incredibly low.   I think someone actually ran the numbers and the chance to get a specific legendary with specific traits is like 0.0000006 percent chance because there are over 400k permutations.
---
So... Yeah. There really only should be just a few of the TSE.
---
A ton of people have All rise because you get it from the mission Mayor for a Day in Watoga 
---
Same length as any MMO game ever? 
---
Purely awesome!
---
Have you ever been on reddit for any video game ever?  Developers and Bethesda staff are assigned to read this Reddit sub.
---
They communicate with the community here.

Support actually encourages social media posts to get the attention of the Devs because filing tickets has no real value for questions like this, bud.
---
2 stars in 2h, 2stars in rifles, max armor penetretion, max blody mess, adrenaline, some damage reduction, mutations ... nothing too fancy ... power armor with mods ...
---
Yeah it’s gonna go wrong somehow and take something from everybody
---
ESO went through these same problems, even dupers. They were banned there too. All of this has happened before. So I mean if they didn't shut down ESO yet I guess 5 years+?
---
People should just earn their items. :) 
---
Do not combine these with the Sex Panther perk cards. They only work 60% of the time, everytime.
---
How exactly are they going to determine a duped legendary weapon vs. a legitimate one? Did every weapon in have have a unique ID number?
---
He’s joking.  I’m joking. The whole thing isn’t to be taken literally. A satire piece. Fictional writing. 
---
Yeah, if you're big on immersion, mics are a game killer.  
---
Why is the bearded guy talking to me in the voice of a ten year old?
---
Where is the third voice yelling at this player to clean the bathroom coming from?
---
Why can I hear the sound of screaming babies but I don't see any?
---
I guess you could roleplay as someone losing their mind.
---
Dupe much?
---
I say you protest by not playing lolz
---
Just razzing you, bud.  
---
But really, these posts bore me and I don't find them useful to me, the reader, so I'd be a lot happier if people just emailed Bethesda and moved on.
---
super duper would mean it is a dual wield since you get a extra 
---
You are pretty wrong.
---
Right, most people who duped have been done with this game for months now. Only really expecting hate from the goobers who bought duped stuff and still play 
---
Um, as someone with this fully loaded perk you have me very concerned 
---
In a cruel twist that would be pretty funny.  Oh you meant “dupers” not the perk card lol
---
Obviously. You’re all over this thread. Go break an arm jerking yourself off somewhere else. 
---
&gt; Hello healthy economy!
---
I wish I could share this optimism.
---
An enormous amount of lag will be created as the system triple checks your items to make sure they aren’t duped.  Meanwhile the duper’s have found 10 new ways to dupe something making server stability worse.
---
I cannot imagine how the developers did not see this coming.  
---
You can argue all you want about how bad/good the game is.  The planning for this game was atrocious.  
---
I bought the game at 60 bucks.  I played for 4 hours.  I’ll check back in a year.  Hopefully they will have hired someone worth a shit.
---
I am sure they will just expand their sales team.
---
I suggest that in solidarity of your assertions that you don’t play till every claim you’ve made is fixed!
---
This fix is so late already that dupers have had enough time to trade all their weapons for caps and other stuff. Only people who are going to suffer are those who bought TSE weapons from someone. Dupers are the winners again.
---
Im sure the average joe buying TSE knew dam well it was most likely a dupe. 
---
I bought one TSE, and if its gone its gone.  I knew it was risk.  
---
Dont really matter now anyway.  In a couple weeks  we got some great games coming out.  
---
I *think* that is just a weird thing where ammo you used earlier just finally displays as removed from inventory- yiu just added an item and system says oh yeah let’s catch up on all the recent used items...
---
&gt; by bringing along 5 or 6 Gatling plamsa
---
If only we could: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHywcIfqIpY
---
If you think this post is complaining about losing duped items, you must be blind with zero reading comprehension. 🤣
---
Rolling pins tbh
---
Doubtful:
---
It'll likely catch the most duped items, like all the TSE guns, but I doubt it goes too far beyond that. Hopefully it catches more! But probably not. Still a great step in the right direction
---
To a lot of the, louder people on this forum if you have a TSE you must be a duper. What Bethesda's actions show me is if you prefer to play using guns you are being punished and pushed toward melee. (Weapon durability and nerfing the explosive and no laser gun feasibility). I think alot of people have left and we are being left to hear from the people who couldn't get a TSE gun on their own through grinding or buying or are just salty for whatever reason. Bethesda's biggest PVP unbalanced issue was the bobble head stacking, the drug and the comic book stacking(which you still can do) over powering someone unfairly. As well as making you able to die and take damage in pacifist mode. 
---
If I wanted to PVP I'd have that mode off, I never wanted that most and more successful games have PVP designated areas or servers.
---
BUT I had 2 TSE guns so I must be a duper.
---
Yes, I do have reactive plates on, and both the electrically charged and the other mutation that does radiation damage sometimes when hit in melee.  But I know that there were times where neither of the mutations were triggered and when he attacked me I became wanted. Then he killed me and no mutation was triggered, and he died too. 
---
Weirdly heavy weapons are easier to carry. I keep my Gatling, heavy plasma, Gatling laser and .50 cal on me. With the 90% weight reduction card they’re less than 8 pounds all up and trying to fit them in my stash would be almost 80 pounds. Much easier to just hold on to them.
---
I did not consider plans....
---
Somewhere, deep within the bowels of Bethesda, a technician lovingly places his finishing touch on a line of code which he has commented and named "Order 66"
---
I'm not sitting through an hour of this. Someone give me the cliff notes.
---
You can actually make the dough, grind the meat and add in the souce with diced up ham/cheese.
---
Then just use a hot sandwich toaster grill to make them. Works well!   The grill is two sided and looks like a wafflemaker but its for toasting sandwhiches.
---
The good old days of killing NPCs by stuffing fifty superstims into them
---
ran into someone with 18,000 frag grenades claimed he found them and offered to trade me for some of them since I have a grenade build - I opened the inv saw he had over 120k junk exited trade shot him twice he shot me and then I bounced a pulse grenade off his X-01 grabbed the loot bag with him following me shooting and jumped into a fissure with him screaming nooooooo
---
I'll miss these moments - sort of
---
That’s one power armor plan. I’ve bought excavator calibrated shocks, teslacoil, working on a bracers plan of some kind
---
Once found a guy with about a couple thousand nuka-colas. You'd have to be fucking dumb to think that those weren't duped. 
---
I feel my gear sucks enough that I should be safe as someone would have had to be really desperate to dupe anything I got from vendors 
---
&gt;**Cleaning up meat piles**
---
I do this frequently but I no longer use the junk perk cards and getting overencumbered in a nuked WS is dangerous. I think it was suggested a couple times that the piles could be auto-combined into one big pile.
---
&gt;**3x lvl 80 scorchbeasts**
---
I get/got this sometimes too (even before patch 5) but thought how lucky I am, tasty SB meat! I don't find the fight really demanding, but perhaps my Vampiric Gatling Gun with buff perks across the spectrum is good enough. If one is melee, I'm sure there is room for Heavy Gunner perks and at least Stabilized to go ranged until they land.
---
&gt; **Zero Star** 
---
Is zero star a real legendary tier, or is it actually a bug in the naming logic? These enemies most often don't evolve when damaged below 50% the first time. (Also when I hear "retreating" from far, I know it's a legendary worth pursuing.)
---
\----
---
**Bug - Scorched dropping a head &amp; keeping one on**: I've mentioned this in the [UI/Graphics roundup](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aq1uah/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_ui/egdwc5w/) but maybe it is worth mentioning here too. I shoot them in the head, a head drops but the body still has a head attached.
---
**Bug(?) - Ghouls charging really fast:** hilarious and annoying at the same time as they get behind the minimum weapon range and hip-fire/melee strike will not hit them most of the time. Also when there is a group of them, their mass sprinting sometimes causes lag/warping for me.
---
**Balance(?) - Gulpers feel too spongy:** maybe I don't use the right weapons/effects, but it takes me twice as many rounds to kill a lvl 46 Gulper than a lvl \~50 Deathclaw with headshots &amp; Gatling + perks.
---
**Balance(?) - Pistol Colonel Gutsies feel spongy and also shoot hard:** They seem to use some serious anti-armor rounds as they can kill me with 20 hits on 250 Health/400 DR. It takes me 30 rounds from a Handmade 84dmg + tank killer 3 to kill them.
---
**Bug - Scorched holding minigun and not firing**: I get this a lot inside Thunder Mountain NPP; either they spawn with or pick up a minigun, but they don't fire it. Looting them gives the minigun and ammo though. Icing on the cake, they hold the gun in a ridiculous angle too.
---
**Balance(?) - No Super Mutants with .50 cal:** maybe I just didn't pay attention, but I can't remember if they ever spawned holding a .50 Cal or Gatling Gun, only Minigun.
---
**Bug(?) - Mongrels/Wolfs circling around a lot:** I'm not sure it this is really a bug or a feature. Either they can't turn fast enough when moving, or they don't want to. Also this circling can negatively affect some kind auto-aim behavior I experience with my Gatling + Stabilized (i.e., aimed shots go far left or right of the target for no reason).
---
**Bug(?) - Scorched running exactly towards me yet I can still get sneak attack hits on them:** also not sure if this is a bug or an effect. Using a suppressed ranged weapon, hitting a Scorched from basic sneak (2x damage), makes them run exactly towards me, yet subsequent hits still land with the sneak bonus damage.
---
**Balance(?) - Rarery finding 5.56 or .50 ammo on enemies:** outside the Forrest, I'd expect more Super Mutants or Scorched using 5.56 or .50 ammo, especially in the Mire/Bog area. They seem to be far more rare than .38 or .308 which I get a lot but have no use for. Also BoS wasn't big on these ammo types.
---
**Bug - Challie the Moo Moo can get stuck on the environment:** I encountered this at the Silva Homestead. The brahmin got stuck between the hay bales in front of that hangar with the workbenches, warping back and forth and not getting out while Grahm was a half mile away at some point.
---
**Bug - Event(?) - Tea time enemy behavior:** enemies either don't spawn or get stuck at the concrete foundation of the water tower, not attacking the pipes at all. Also they seem to attack the water tower 90% often and the tea house 10%. When doing the event with 1-3 participants, they almost never attack the pump next to the Red Rocket station (which is a bit of a relief when soloing).
---
**Bug - Event(?) - Project beanstalk enemy behavior:** I've encountered this many times; the enemies don't spawn or only one or two per location, and after the event completes, they spawn in and attack the robot in masses.
---
**Bug(?) - Scorched can walk over tables at the Watoga mall:** There are tables at the water front edge in the Watoga mall area where Scorched often spawn. They have no difficulty walking up and down those tables yet they can't jump over railing/concrete separators elsewhere.
---
**QoL - Graphics(?) - Difficult to find/loot piles in grass, next to a flower or beneath a full corpse:** There are PC mods that make stuff glow, but it would be great if, for example, some outline would be drawn visible through the environment.
---
**QoL - Consumables(?) - Have a chem that gives temporary Awareness effect:** yes, there is a perk card but again, there is a (unstable) PC mod that shows enemy health and resistances. Just like boosting stats/highlighting enemies with Mentats, there could be a chem that enables this effect for a short amount of time and perhaps outside of VATS too.
---
**QoL - Make the Whitesprings robots non-damageable by the player:** asked many times by many, an accidental hit on them when they are fighting a valuable target makes them all attack the player. There could be a similar mechanic to Watoga robots: if you hit one of them, only that will retaliate and the others would simply ignore you. Also since (?) they don't drop loot or give XP when killed, it makes little sense you can damage them in the first place in a highly combative zone.
---
**Balance/QoL - The DR of the Scorchbeast Queen should not scale linearly:** as far as I understand, going from DR 50 to DR 100 will reduce the same incoming damage more than 50%. I don't use Awareness in SBQ fights so I don't know the exact numbers but having more than 10 people and despite anti-armor capabilities, she could have an effective 500+ DR making her practically unkillable within the time limit (or in hours if she glitches out) (unless really OP bloodied builds are also present).
---
**QoL - Win Prizes less often:** it is somewhat annoying the prize Gutsy shows up behind me in a sneak/combat situations. Also it could even be better if this random encounter would be limited to The Forrest area. (The most hilarious encounter for me was in a nuked Whitesprings at the golf club where I was whacking a ton of gouls and suddenly, "you won the appalacian sweep stakes".)
---
you keep replying like it's gonna change the facts. if the pvers left, Bethesda would just shut the servers because it's not worth the hassle for a few hundred raiders- to raid themselves. they aimed for a target audience that doesn't exist, and thus missed entirely. there's no one who actually wants to play this game other than Fallout fans, definitely not multiplayer fans.
---
so for the last goddamned time, either they cater to their playerbase, **which isn't you**, or the game dies.
---
For the god-tier items, sure. But there will now actually be a reason to trade for the decent or "good enough" stuff. The way it is now is you need sentinel/assassin's or aae/be gear to trade for anything good, tse or plans for caps, and everything else is worthless
---
How was this an intelligent use of game mechanics? I don’t attack them, they attack me, I become wanted, I get killed, magically the other guy dies as well, and he seeks revenge for 150 caps. None of that seems intelligent at all
---
***Execute Order 66***
---
Unless... They fuck up!
---
Well as long as the atom shop makes enough money to feed the server hamsters, they'll keep the game up. Seriously, say what you want about it, the atom shop might be the only thing that motivate them to bother updating the game.
---
Yep can't delete everyone's duped items but still leave the duping methods in place makes most items suspect
---
Imagine complaining about a patch before it even comes out.
---
It's gonna be cluster fuck tomorrow. Bethesda hasn't done anything right yet and they will fail tomorrow too. Only one who win in this case are the real dupers, because they have already traded enough stuff for other items.
---
What if they fucking duped the enemy?
---
G-g-g-g-g-u-nit!
---
too bad that's what the players wanted and Bethesda gave us the choice to play it as such.
---
so either accept that you'll always be a minority or move on like the rest of the mmo fiends.
---
Truth be told, I've been "remodeling" my kitchen for three years now.... A shack is exactly what I would be building.
---
Players demand a fix for TSE and Dupes
---
Bethesda Gives players both
---
Players outraged
---
Bethesda Confused as hell 
---
I'm missing anything constructive about this post...
---
Jesus it’s funny how often people post these to get their special internet points on reddit
---
I thought there was a way around it. I've never tried it myself, all I know is I saw references to it still being used about a month ago with no news of any fixes
---
Awesome!
---
Meh. Some of the main problems this game has had are tied to the strain we're putting on the databases. 
---
I'd rather just work out how to place camps more easily in a variety of locations. 
---
Bethesda cares more a out control of this game than player experience. Every change has been about taking back some sort of 'power' 
---
&gt; How was this an intelligent use of game mechanics? I don’t attack them, they attack me, I become wanted, I get killed, magically the other guy dies as well, and he seeks revenge for 150 caps. None of that seems intelligent at all
---
Forcing you to kill him by taking advantage of your damage reflecting properties to get free caps.  Seems pretty clever to me, even if it's a jerk move.
---
Intelligent use of stupid game mechanics. Sorry for the misunderstanding.
---
By the way let me save you the trouble of contacting Bethesda support with their copy paste reply.
---
&gt;If you are having an issue with a specific player, we recommend that you Block this player and do not engage them in any way. Once you have added them to your Blocked list, you should log out of the game and log back in. This will place you on a different server, and you should never have to encounter this player again.
---
Oh yay, the same damn video posted for the bajillionth time. 
---
Lucky thing it's just the squeaky wheels on Reddit who are actually upset. The other 90% of the players are just going to move the fuck on without really knowing that anything happened.
---
I mean if they can really purge the duped weapons, they would silently do it once a month instead of trying to patch the duping.
---
look man, i have a few items that are possibly duped. I've done a lot of trading and a lot of selling.
---
On that note, I am welcoming this patch with open arms. it's a shame that we paid earned caps for certain weapons, but those weapons shouldn't have been there to begin with. the fact that the market has been saturated with so many duped items is a serious issue, and imo contributed heavily to the current state of the community. while i cant say whether people would be less antsy because they would be forced to actually grind out and find/earn these weapons, the frustration would definitely be focused elsewhere had things been done right from this aspect in the first place.
---
i don't think anyone thinks you're "scum" for unknowingly buying an item, but don't get pissed at Bethesda bc a cheater tricked you into receiving illicit items. I have 4 major items items that I received from trades: TSE handmade, TSE combat shotgun, TSE reduced weight pump shotgun, 3* super sledge. i am 100% aware that these might be on the cutting board, and I considered that when I accepted them. It's unfortunate but necessary. the game is tainted. this is something that should have been fixed a long time ago, so that it wouldn't get to this point, but it has, and this is the next best option. i know you feel like a few thousand caps is a lot right now, but caps come and go. people want the game fixed, well this is Bethesda trying. there should not be near as many op weapons floating around out there.
---
if you care about the integrity and future of this game, you would understand that this is a necessary move.
---
So, someone sells you a car. Seems 100% legit. You do your homework. You drive it around for a month or so. Let's say you dropped $10 000 on it.
---
The cops come around, tell you it was originally stolen, and seize it. You get absolutely no compensation. That's the end of it. You're alright with this?
---
This is a loose example, I realize that there are laws in place to protect this in real life. This is, however, is more akin to what this duped item scrap is doing. 
---
I also realize this is a fucking video game and we don't actually own any of this digital content. But hell, it's for discussion's sake.
---
do u know if we are getting a real patch tomorrow aswell i didnt see anything about other things being addressed AND EMRGOOOD THEY TOOK OUR GUNS  
---
[https://i.gyazo.com/5999563e973faa1286a44df7921f1c39.png](https://i.gyazo.com/5999563e973faa1286a44df7921f1c39.png)
---
All 52 of them
---
Im totally out of the loop, which weapon/legendary effect is considered best now?
---
Innocent people are affected. Dupers have already traded enough of their duped stuff for other items. They aren't losing anything important. They will be even more richer compared to others players than ever. This fix took way too long so they had months of time to stack their caps and other items through trading.
---
Been burned one too many times by EA to bother; they've peddled lots of stuff that 'looked' good until you actually play it. They've been in the boat that Bethesda is climbing in to for a long while.
---
Why? Is there a market for bulked cork? Because I have cork!!! Who wants cork?
---
**OH GOLLY WE ACCIDENTALLY FUCKED UP THE GAME'S ECONOMY, AND IN THE PROCESS, DELETED TONS OF FUCKING WEAPONS!!!** Here's 20 atom points for accommodation.
---
Reddit is hardly the majority, bud. Most people barely have time to play games, much less talk on the internet about playing games.
---
they can`t redeem their reputation, all they can do for now is to try to fix fkn game
---
It uses a perk, you’re coming out 1 leather ahead per proc while consuming something. 
---
Acid bulking / unbulking did make things from nothing. 
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure like 99% I won't be buying it.
---
if they had a UUID tag on any item, they would have addressed this months ago.
---
Breh, was just making a joke about how many people are left in the game. Don't be so serious.
---
\&gt; I think I speak for everyone here in saying you're a fucking idiot. There's a difference between a team of coders working on a script that can scour an entire player database looking for VERY specific item IDs during a server downtime and expecting a customer support rep to have access to said database and taking the time to manually go through and restore shit people swear they had but totally disappeared. 
---
Agree
---
\&gt; Even the most successful MMOs out there don't regularly do item restores outside of EXTREME situations and even then restrict this shit to a one time only offer. 
---
Uhhhhh? Literally the most successful MMO out there lets you regularly do self service item restores. 
---
Chances of actually getting a TSE dropped on a specific weapon type is like 0.000006 percent chance.
---
The chances of you actually buying a legit TSE: 0.0%
---
It doesn't make any difference if you have multiple characters with bases or one with more of them. Some people don't like the whole hassle of moving junk and items around to your alts, more so if you don't have a lot of friends playing the game.
---
Honestly the whole problem wouldn't really exist if the blueprints actually worked. Having the blueprint green when you're trying to place it yet unable to do so renders the whole thing almost pointless other than saving small structures with it.
---
Reading this subreddit already makes me wish for a nuclear winter. 
---
Yeah, my favorite shotgun was a 2* non-dupe two-shot, VATs. I think I either dropped it or accidentally sold it yesterday. I’ve got other shotguns, but that was my favorite for head-shotting ghouls. 
---
I’m pretty sure nothing I have on that character is duped. 
---
I’d really like to be able to lock items to keep from dropping / selling. Bleh. 
---
If I understand the announcement correctly, then it's all happening server-side, and no patch otherwise.
---
Should be? Of course it fucking will, it's Fallout 70 Fucking 6!
---
It's a valid point that many people are likely to lose things. No idea how they would know that they were gewtting duped things. That said, if drops of legendary items improve, I'm OK with the tradeoff. 
---
Sure, but they will complain the more they paid or had, the louder.
---
Also some will just stop playing after losing their powerfull weapons as there might be nothing left for them.
---
good for the others, but only if there are still enough left. Depends on how may still active player will lose their best equipement today. 1%, 10% or maybe 50%? i don't know.
---
well feelsbad thanks bud &lt;3
---
I thought the same thing, but the video was better than I expected, the summary is:
---
Everything is broken, even basic combat means enemies don't leave static animation states, bullet hits can register late, sometimes a head falls off an enemy model but it doesn't erase a head from the original model, and the drops suck, and the lag sucks. When the server stopped repopulating players, the game ran well and it was fun and BGS should consider an offline private server mode with 7 other invite only players a way to salvage the game and their rep. 
---
Theory: The game originally ran as well as FO4 but the NPCs made it too laggy so no NPCs. The game crafting system makes the game too laggy, so weight limits. The devs aren't happy with how the game was treated by being released early, so broken, that now they take directions literally, malicious compliance.
---
Fix these problems? sure, I'll do it \*does it on a older version\*
---
Add push to talk? sure, \*adds nothing else of value to patch\*
---
BGS traded good will for money but that wasn't the intention of the game designers, there's areas of the game that showed the team cared, like the first time you climbed up to Tanagra and it's covered with vines, but the vault that the vines are coming out of isn't accessible, so was that an intentional design choice of a team that would sculpt a truly unique place that invokes mystery like Tanagra and then leave you hanging by making the vault inaccessible or were they forced to release an incomplete game?
---
Anyone who doesn't have the quest can carry stacks of technical data, and trade them. My friend specifically didn't finish the quest with one of his characters. He would collect a few dozen, and then we'd got turn them in 20-30 at a time. We got all the linings, paints, cosmetics, etc.
---
*affect
---
No one said they are fixing dupers just taking the items you bought of a super and leaving him with your caps. 
---
Really? I bet 10,000 Caps nothing disapears from your inventory. If it's soooooo likely, wouldn't you place that bet?
---
Right...
---
Yeah, but why more than 200 caps worth?  I’m just saying it’s not a problem that many people have. 
---
Also, lots of people get murdered in train stations, so that’s a good way to lose all your junk. 
---
The ONLY time you need to transfer junk from stash to your person is to scrap it/sell it/drop it, so there really isn’t that much of a need for this feature. 
---
My only hope is it's looking for stacks of items. If even 1 of my items are gone I'm done with this  game and Bethesda as a company.
---
Oooh, yeah that would make sense, but at the same time no sense whatsoever
---
The potential for future cheating doesn't mean that they shouldn't put a stop to existing cheating. 
---
Listen at the end of the day it's the players fault for duping items. If we didn't plaster it on YouTube and the guy that found it reported it straight to Bethesda without telling anyone, they wouldn't have to do this. They're simply removing illegitimate items, the side effects are the players own fault.
---
Still waiting
---
We'll see how it goes today, I guess.  If I lose the handful of weapons/gear that I bought from other players and did not dupe, I'll stop playing the game.  Simple as that.
---
I know no one on Reddit cares whether I play the game or not, but on the off chance that someone from Bethesda reads this - I'm the type of player you want to retain.  I bought Fallout 3 and all of its DLC.  I pre-ordered Fallout 4, bought all of its DLC, and bought a second GOTY version for a different platform.  I also recently bought Fallout 76 on a second platform.
---
I'm fortunate enough to be at a place in life where I have a lot of disposable income.  Part of that has gone your way even for non-game content in the past several years.  Hell, my garage is plastered with Fallout decor.  I rock Fallout swag on my '55 Chevy that I put in car shows.
---
I've been defending the game ever since the beta, where I saw its great potential and enjoyed it despite minor issues here and there.  But the choices you're making lately bother me a lot, and they're sucking the fun out of the game.  I don't want this to be a game where it's a constant grind, and you target things that people gravitate to because they make the game more enjoyable.  Instead of seeing the potential for this game to be great, I have instead started to see the potential for it to go down the drain and die.
---
I want this game to succeed.  I want it to be my go-to game until the next Fallout or Elder Scrolls comes out.  I have the money to spend and it's no skin off my back to buy extra from you.  But your choices are turning me away.  The sloppiness in your execution is one thing, but you're making the game more tedious on purpose.  Please rethink this.
---
The thing is, where do u think the dupers get their items from to begin with. They don't create them, they just reproduce them with duping. In other words, these god tier items all come as a result of farming. So you can't really expect players at end game to be looking for mediocre items and the value of items differ according to build and you can't expect anything that isn't a TSE to be duped. In my case as a sniper, The hunting and lever action rifle r very valuable to me, while melee weapons and shotguns are worth nothing to my build.
---
Although, I will explain to u how dupers influence the market beyond duping. Its the cap limits they have. A while back, a dude looted a bloodied explosive hunting rifle. A weapon that until this day, I can't find or buy. I have a total of 17k caps. It was only 8k when i began shopping and grinding for it. A guy looted one recently from the SBQ, and posted it on reddit. I posted 10k and the bids went up and I slammed 15k, which was all I had at that point. A guy comes in and says 25k. He cleans the deal and takes the rifle.
---
Later on, I get a message from the buyer, saying that he noticed that I was very interested in it. I said yes, but knowing i can't do 25k, I was expecting to trade for it. Then he says if I want it, I could check his website and buy it for $. I rejected and went back to the search. I got really salty that the guy's game of ecomonics and early on exploits could f the game so bad. Then I realized that, the main reason why I can't find one, is because all these damn websites fish them out right away upon dropping. No one wants caps anymore, so I am now sitting at 22k with no one to buy from, as they want trades only now and I am depending on rng to catch one of thier interests. Now that duping is gone or dealt with. The websites should go down, therefore the need to proclaim god tier weapons for $ sale would diminish, allowing for us to have a healthy market again. Finally and good riddance with all the duped items 
---
People be buying Bethesda games and wonders why the games have bugs and why Todd lied about "features'' for the games. Really amaze me especially these things are well known for years.
---
sorry I didn't know, I only skim the top posts for the sub for a while, waiting to see if there's any good news coming out. 
---
I suspect they'll also be posting more info after their maintenance is complete.  
---
Hell, I bet they've got two articles written, one for what they say if everything goes according to plan, one to do damage control if something unexpected happens.
---
Hopefully the game gets better after E3. Taking a 8 month break until a new expansion or a Realm Reborn type fix comes out.
---
I’d love to see super mutants as a faction / character option. Really, actual factions would be fun for starters and then yeah ... be cool to have people as Responders, Rich-turned-Raider, Free States, BoS and then maybe Ghouls and Super Mutants.
---
My YouTube is GameZ of Fruit 101. Also I have been farming steel and tick blood to make steem packs. As long as you have the right perks 20 of the sell for 200 caps I jump to all seven and get 1400. That is 140 packs I’m making a day.
---
I have NO faith in Bethesda at all. Since Fallout 4. 
---
I follow your discussions and worries, but mine is 50% storytelling (F4 killed the franchise), and  25% Map and 25% music.
---
In F4 both were quite superb.
---
In 76 Inon Zur wasn't really inspired, the writing is even more childish and lazy than F4. Never thought it possible.
---
The map creators are the ones keeping the franchise alive. Nobody seems to notice.
---
For all I care they could take ALL the weapons. Even make a global reset. Levels included
---
I'd make popcorns and enjoy the ride.
---
It would be even fun
---
Sneaking will now require players to look down and navigate twigs and branches.  New audio cues have been added for PVP purposes and stepping on a branch will now alert all mobs within 2 miles.
---
I just got a vampires explosive combat shotgun, hopefully they don't take it.
---
It looks i actually forgot the &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag. I just wanted to say that I wouldn't wonder if the banana script will have a lot of false positives
---
What about the "duped" Items that ended up in vendors inventory because they sold them? How would anyone expect you to know that the item was duped
---
Maybe they are. Maybe they have a ton of good stuff coming very soon. Developing new content takes time and I'm sure they've delayed releasing such content until nasty bugs and duplication is resolved.
---
This
---
Honestly I can’t wait to see all those idiots who paid real world money for these weapons to finally lose said weapons. It’ll be hilarious 
---
I don’t need the T-51 my friend does I’m working on my X-01
---
Ya im just waiting for whole legit inventories to just be gone with the track record they have hopefully they have some people who know what they are doing for this since its kinda important not just another patch seeing as they like to \*\*\*\* those up and god this subreddit today is gonna be insane cant wait ;)
---
Fallout 76 not being a competition is your perspective. There is a PvP mode coming out, that sounds like a competition to me.
---
*fewer
---
I've got a full set of sentinel. If it's gone, ill lose it. 
---
I hope you understand that dupers aren't losing anything important in this fix. They have already sold enough of their duped items for people and got new items that are not duped (caps, resources, armors etc). Only one who suffer are basicly those who bought something from dupers and not all of them were aware that items were duped.
---
I figured they would be useless, but I was hopefully optimistic.
---
That’s okay, they’re all useless at the moment anyways
---
yeah I scared a few off a couple of times doing duping by screaming incoming and tossing like 6 artillery mortar grenades into their base as they logged off in a panic 
---
of course as everyone knows unless you are like 15 feet from your camp mortars are useless so it was just a bluff but I ran up snagged the bags of random things (mostly junk items and Chems) and then tossed most in a river to despawn and took the rest to the noob area of maps and stuffed 50 stimpacks into every chest in the area 
---
Quick question. If I use the disc as a weapon, and since I paid real world money for it, would I be classified as an idiot?
---
Like, for real, though.
---
How do you "unwittingly received from/via a duper".
---
You think people would just give away a legit weapon that has a 0.000006% chance of dropping?  Or perhaps those serums that are so very easy to get?
---
You know they are duped or you would not be worried right now. 
---
I'm actually excited. Think of it like starting the game over but at ur current level. I know I have a shit ton of duped crap. I'm not salty one bit. Even if my entire stash disappeared....it gives me something to work for. All the caps I paid for duped items...who cares. Caps are easily made in this game and the world is full of resources and items. 
---
And its will be entertaining to see all the disgruntled player post lol. 
---
BUT YOU GAVE AWAY DUPLICATED STIMPACKS THOSE ARE ILLEGAL!!!
---
They might build their list based on item stacks but since they clearly mention that people who might have gotten a duped item will be affected, if you have the bad luck of rolling an item that matches a stacked item - you’ll likely lose it.
---
It will be a simple method based on approximation is my best guess.
---
If you're going to accuse somebody of lying, at least provide quotes or links to the instances where they lied.  Posts like this lead to herd mentality hatred.
---
I believe they're being facetious. 
---
I keep seeing TSE in these posts, what does that mean? 
---
Then they need a list of what they purge. 
---
And this time there are no modders around to fix this game and hotfix.
---
Downtime around 9am EST on Feb 14, so yes, they are taking servers down for maintenance today.
---
Community Post: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language=en
---
you're not wrong, but knowing that duping is so prominent, when you engage with a stranger online for a transaction, you are going in knowing the risk. yes, 100%, it is possible that the weapon is completely legitimate, just unwanted and tossed aside by someone else out there grinding their heart out. but it is *at least* equally likely that it is duped.
---
Bethesda has been calling out cheaters and dupers for some time now, with minimum action against some. it's known that duping isn't cool and they will crack down on them. knowing all of these things, you should have been ready to understand that you may lose these weapons, and therefore, caps. trading with a random player is at your own risk, and all of the above should be considered and accepted before going through with a deal.
---
Valentine's Day Massacre is obligatory, no?
---
I want a bigger stash, and I haven't found anything worth copying even if I wanted to.
---
The problem I have is that Bethesda wanted people to trade with other players. Now the players who did just that will likely have items taken away from them because they didn't verify (somehow) that what they bought wasn't a duped item.
---
Doesn't fix last night, but would sugest you set yourself in pacifist mode. 
---
I accidentally shot another player the other day while battling hordes of super mutants. Thankfully, it didn't harm him, so he couldn't attack me back. And if he had tried, it would've been slap damage. 
---
If we’re frank, they’ll just “fix” things that aren’t as tedious.
---
Melee damage is nerfed to hell
---
Melee weapons now require screws to fix
---
Drop rates for ballistic fibre have been halved
---
Cap cost for taking over workshops increased
---
Etc
---
At least they’ll be more stable now
---

Yeah, I'll admit that's about where I am at with this. Great! If they do it correctly. Trepadation  that they won't and I'll lose some cool stuff (well, some of it was cooler before the nerf).
---
I am level 43 and I've just completed Bots on Parade and it was really easy, took three minutes and only had to kill Seven mole miners with the hardest being level 40
---
If Bethesda manages to make your disc disappear I would genuinely be impressed. But I’m mainly talking about the crowd who bought TSE’s off of eBay 
---
Are you sure they wanted us to trade? I mean, all do respect, with what the currently did with the trading system, and what is about to happen, it kind of seems like they don't want us to engage with eachother.
---
I'm good with it. My entire 4 person squad have alts that are mules for stuff we farm and want to save so we already discussed the possibility of losing mass amounts of excess Junk and Stims, apparel items, etc from our "Shopkeepers". It's all virtual stuff in a virtual world. If anything the collateral damage will have a net increase in market value of what remains and we will be swimming in caps and able to actually sell the great rare stuff that was overshadowed by the thousands of duped items floating around.
---
ya i guess its not a real patch then i was hoping they would throw some more stuff in it, this was the only thing they said feelsbad " Additionally, during downtime, we’re going to roll out a server-side fix to reduce the frequency that players might experience disconnects from game servers. " but im glad this dupe stuff is getting fixed makes the guns i have feel great since i earned them through rng Jesus ;0
---
Probably a script. If u have so many of x item. Then delete them all. Or maybe if we are lucky delete all but one. 
---
I'm worried about my Grognak Axe I bought months ago from the Whitespring vendor with all of the crafting tables.  He had a whole crapload of legendaries, which is normal, since people farm the golf course, and sell there. I scrolled through, and saw a max level 3\* Furious Grognak axe with 90% weight reduction and +40% power attack, so I snatched it up for something like 74 CAPS.. I've literally been using that since I bought it, and I hope it's not one of the flagged items.. I freaking LOVE that thing!
---
That doesn't answer my god damn question, Mechanist. I need an answer before I strap the disc with razorblades, attach it to a yo-yo, and fucking go crazy!
---
I like the vampire affix but I think it might just be us two 😉
---
True. My anti-armor gatling and 50cal are now my best weapons. 
---
Impossible
---
&gt;there are lots of people that would rather pay cash than grind for ~~hours~~ months
---
FTFY. I've had two two shot, one explosive, no TSE, weapons, drop with nearly daily play since early November. Lots of Whitesprings farming. Lots of Mire farming. Fair amount of SBQ. The drop rate is ludicrously low. Everything else I have, including all my TSEs, I capped and/or traded items for.

My very first video game I played was probably Duck Hunt. With my family being southern, hunters, and video game lovers, I was blasting ducks away in my wee early years. My uncle, who was a preteen when I was born, taught me all about video games and actually gave me my very first console when I was a toddler. Bless him. He created a monster. 
---
I first came across Fallout 3 in 2010 after my mom died. I was 18 and it had always been just me and my mom. My entire world was turned upside down. I moved in with my aunt and two cousins and they were playing Fallout 3 one day with my best friend, who was like a second daughter to my mom, and she fell in love with the game first. So, me being me, I decided to try and play it, and I was HOOKED, and it helped me through my grieving process. So, I picked up New Vegas, and I was hooked again. And then I downloaded 1 and loved it. Sadly I haven't had time to play 2 or Tactics yet, but I have played 4, quite extensively, and I have loved 76 since the beta, since I get to explore Appalachia with my future husband, it makes it even more special. 
---
Fallout holds a special place in my heart, kinda like Duck Hunt. 
---
The whole foundation of the game is just fucked up really. I still love the game mind you, but the duping, the TSE guns, all the bugs, all the bugs they fix that come back for no reason in a later patch, now this where they first claim they cannot target duped items (when the dupers made a fortune both irl and ingame and were completelly unchecked for months) and then having everyone (mostly legit players) fear for their stuff now...
---
Having all that first few months of the game, and then just nerfing everything without having 0 actual endgame and progression is a shit way to run a game and they''ve basically sealed its faith. It's been 3 months and all they did so far was try to fix the mess (most of which) was there from the launch.
---
Can't Compete with my "Furious Candy Cane" +40% Swing Speed, 90% reduced weight, I have a video of me killing a Wanted player with it, when combined with sneak &amp; other perks, it's actually a very viable weapon.
---
That is the funny part. Duping still exists beyond patch 5, but alot more discrete. Who knows what is duped and what isn't at this point. 
---
Hmmm probably not because the disk wasn’t duped, it was manufactured 
---
I don't think they will remove items from trades like some people here are worried about. I'm pretty sure they're just removing the items from the accounts found to be duping. Hopefully, the server stability will improve greatly. This is also a good starting point to reall nail down bugs in the game. It's gotta be hard trying to tackle bugs in a game where exploits are ruining server stability. If something glitches, how sure can you be that it was actuallty a bug and not just the server running behind/forward, or just unstable in general. This is a very welcome improvement for someone like me that actually saves lot of items and would love have an actual in game economy that I can actually rely on the in game value of items.
---
Please point to where I said Bethesda shouldn't fix unfavorable exploits.
---
Dupers are laughing tomorrow. They had all the time to sell those duped items for other players and got shitload of new items, resources and caps. Those poor people who bought from dupers in good faith are suffering a lot tomorrow.
---
MANUFACTURED COUNTS AS DUPLICATING BECAUSE YOU ARE MAKING MULTIPLE COPIES OF A SINGLE ITEM!!! 
---
I like it too, i also like the fact that it keeps my health at 100% when ever im blasting the shit out of enemies lol
---
People actually side with dupers to shit on Bethesda lol
---
Yes it's terrible that somebody paid 15k caps for a two-shot explosive handmade... but you're mad if you thought somebody would sell something like that **ever** if it were genuine. Of course it wasn't. They would not sell it.
---
That makes sense. In FO4, there were some mods that used the chem station to create items and some of them caused crashes because that mode of creating items somehow created database issues. 
---
I suspect that there's some kind of identifier that can be easily traced. Your suggestion makes sense. It could just as easily be that there's a missing piece of data. 
---
But you aren’t crashing a server friend! 
---
Yeah no joke, and I can't for the life of me get armor that is good enough to survive using melee outside of power armor. I guess I need a 3 star deathclaw gauntlet but the armor I do have doesn't protect me enough so I have to stay in power armor.
---
I hate regular armor and I hate melee combat and I now have to grind for both. I tried the armor I have being 1 - 2 star but nothing good and I just get killed so fast and then have to go grind for stuff to repair it.
---
A bit late to the thread but:
---
If what they say about the dupers causing server stability problems is true, they *are* addressing a very major flaw with the game.
---
Learn something new every day, thank you!
---
I am fully expecting them to screw this up and stop playing. I believe that their intent is to kill the online service, as the Atom shop can't be generating even 10% of the revenue they forecast, so that in the next "big" patch they can convert the game to single player, and add private servers and mod support via the creation club.
---
I think anyone who bought anything off a reddit trader is going to be shitting themselves a little right now! hope your inventory survives the purge!
---
Suns been firing longer than that my friend
---
Move that bus!
---
People complain bitterly over many threads despite not having the game installed (or even having bought it). Shitposting intensifies as the bored masses join the dog pile. 
---
You wanna make a bet? 10,000 caps they don't fuck up anything in your inventory. Easy money for you if you're 100% sure. 
---
OH, SO YOU WANT ME TO CRASH ONE OF MY SERVER FRIENDS? EASY! STRAB THE DISC TO A FUCKING SLEDGEHAMMER, GO TO HIS HOUSE, AND BEAT HIM TO FUCKING DEATH WITH THE DISC!!!
---
Oh and maybe if I'm hungry at that time, maybe have a little snack!
---
And tell me how happy do you feel with that choice? Bethesda nutered PvP so you "majority" of sinpleplayer fans can play solo yet you still bitched about the slap damage and lack of things to do in the game ouside pvp. I don't have to move on because i will be receiving my pvp servers in March. It's you who will move on after the Adventure Mode Servers will become an empty wasteland with nothing to do. You are basically playing Rust just for the Crafting. Without PvP you will get bored super fast. PvP'ers make their own content while you singleplayer fans wait for Bethesda to issue new content to expand a story that was non-existent from the start.
---
So much this. 
---
Noticing a lot of downvote fairies today 
---
&gt; Everything is broken
---
Excellent. Thank you. 
---
fyi it was internet abbreviations. Not grammar mistake. I used ur* and cuz* lol.
---
This would be cool if they did anything after acknowledging the suggestions 
---
Glad you liked them! Anyone can do this, just takes time. There are quite a lot of expressions available, under the second Photomode tab I think - just above poses.
---
Did Bethesda every actually say they have no way of knowing which items are duped? That's something people have kept throwing around but I'm not sure that's true. 
---
But caps AREN'T that easy to get in the grand scheme of things. Seven vendor factions, 200 caps each, daily. 200 for killing the queen. Maybe you earn another almost couple hundred doing events and random kills. Subtract travel costs, maybe some material costs depending on timing. At best you can earn 1500 caps a day within this game. Useful legendaries that can be sold out of game don't drop frequently enough to contribute. A decent weapon, in the CURRENT market, is 2000 caps, bare minimum. That number is going to multiply today. Betcha the vendor cap stash doesn't change. And let's not even talk about cost of plans since that patch.
---
Thar be dragons!
---
Sure. but keep banning the dupers!   
---
So what you're saying is, Todd has a plan, and we should have some faith? 
---
Waaah. 
---
Could be that they *didn't* have the ability to track duped items, because they hadn't anticipated this type of cheating, but they assigned a smart DBA to it and now they know how. 
---
This would explain why they didn't immediately delete all duped items. 
---
So... not lying...
---
In Fallout lore, all Brahmin have udders and two heads. There's an entry on (I think) Rev. Delbert Winter's terminal that he wrote about it.
---
Having a mic would eliminate the need to communicate with limited emotes.
---
It's so much more satisfying when you communicate to the level 3 player on flatwoods, "hey, I just put a full set of crafted armor/weapons in the overseer's chest for you, along with an ultricite pipe pistol with 1 ammo, use it wisely", through series of emotes, jumping, shooting, crouching, and flashing your pip-boy.
---
Who want's to just walk up to someone and say "hey dummy, free stuff"?
---
Man. 
---
If you are this pessimistic for a video game you must be a peach when life throws you real problems.
---
Especially because it is going to have a leader board of player kills, sound deffo like a competition to me lol
---
And it removes many of the issues.   Consumables will eventually go away.
---
What's a deal that's too good to be true? I traded my 1SE and all the caps I had (around 4000) to my clan mate for a 2SE.
---
Seemed steep to me but I wanted one. That's the whole point of inter game trading isn't it? Now haha suck to be me because he may have got it from a duper? 
---
That sucks omg
---
Salty.....players with duped items who are too lazy to play the game................................................................................Excited.....players who love fallout and love a challenge
---
Yeah, the squeaky dupe users. 
---
You understand that there's a whole lot of people out there playing the game who aren't on reddit every day seeing what's posted here, a lot of them are probably just kids who might have 'met a nice stranger with some cool things to trade', you can't blame them for doing something that's basically encouraged by the game.
---
Chances are there's going to be a lot of players that aren't even aware of duping and are going to have a few less weapons when the update drops.
---
*EDIT:  Link cause some aren't quite getting the joke*
---
To be fair, it's not very funny.
---
Converted munitions factory has been properly rebalanced and now consumes player ammunition at a rate of 500 rounds per hour even when logged out. 
---
100% guaranteed, even if everything goes right and this is the best patch we've seen, there will be an article or post that blows up, saying that Bethesda screwed up and they lost their legitimate weapons. this post/article will come out today no matter what, mark my words. people will absorb it and cling to it as law the second the read the headline alone.
---
i'm hoping that after all of the bullshit claims that have been blowing up, we wait to see some definitive proof before we go upvoting and supporting more false claims that will contribute to killing the game.
---
if Bethesda fucks this up, they absolutely deserve the flack, but be smart people. do some research, have some skepticism.
---
My name is Katharine and I work in an art gallery in the Midlands in England :D
---
Tse= two shot explosive, two weapon prefixes of two shot and explosive legendary effects on ranged weapons
---
That's a good way of looking at it.  And yes finally trading will become viable again.  Less valuable stuff people glossed over will become more valuable.  I've traded for stuff in much lesser demand just because I don't have anything really good to trade but those items work for me.
---

Fast traveling to a C.A.M.P will no longer cause players to spawn into the floor. You will now spawn into the water, because it’s more realistic. 
---
Also, a plan for a welcome mat spawn point will be added, however this item cannot be placed because it’s floating. This plan is rare but can be purchased at a vendor for 3657 caps.
---
Thank you.
---
great point, I agree.
---
I run several characters and always go to Whitesprings early to level up. Nothing is ever auto-hostile for me. How weird.
---
Yeah I have reactive plates but this guy was at half health every time he spawned in. Being lvl 150 I would assume he had some good damage resistance on, and even if he didn’t, it would have to be a super powerful miners gauntlet to take him from half health to nothing. I guess he could have perks where his melee weapons do more damage, but unless he had like 600 dmg coming from the gauntlet I don’t get it.
---
&gt;Collateral damage will occur as a result of the purge.
---
Even if it doesn't, claims of it happening will exist and people will believe them and run with it.  Much like the claims of innocent people being banned for mere legitimate uses of crafting / scrapping.  And no one will believe Beth when they come out with information on the type of players they actually banned because no one gets youtube-monies for being pro-Beth.
---
&gt;"You have a 25% chance of being 25% harder to detect while sneaking."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"You have a 50% chance of being 50% harder to detect While sneaking."  
---
&gt;"You have a 75% chance of being 75% harder to detect while sneaking
---
Should read:
---
"You have a 25% (10% while on a team) chance of being 25% harder to detect while sneaking."
---
"You have a 50% (5% while on a team) chance of being 50% harder to detect While sneaking."
---
"You have a 75% (1% while on a team) chance of being 75% harder to detect while sneaking."
---
The only problem I see is caps. Prices are gonna skyrocket and the 25k limit will be too little.
---
Valentine's Day Purge

Valentine's Day Dupe Purge
---
Yeah so you were able to use mules while other people struggled with weight problems and stash space. Nice. It's good that things are working out for you and your particular brand of exploit,
---
It was better for me during 'beta' so I'd be happy if that happens lol
---
Dude, a friend of mine called me when the first ban wave hit. He told me every single item was scattered in 5 digit numbers. I kid u not lol. I told him don't pick anything up. Just walk away and leave the server. He was like r u effin crazy, I told him that someome trashed them for a reason. Do u really want to pick it up and find out why they were all on the floor?
---
He pulled himself together and left. The next day, the ban hammer stroke and he contacted me like Duuudee... Thank God I listened. If he looted them, he would have gotten banned.
---
I'm glad I'm too indecisive to have 1 good build, so there's 28 banked points waiting for me (level 120 something) lol. I don't feel like I'll lose anything important to me, but we will see. I did pick up a couple of TSE's at some point (right before the nerf), so they are most likely the first to go. I'm worried about the 3\* Grognak axe I grabbed from a Whitespring vendor, because that is my favorite melee weapon
---
I’m crying, this post is perfect😂❤️
---
Reddit, Discord, in-game encounters ..........
---
Clearly he was in the last board meeting when the company was discussing long term goals on screwing over customers. He also knows they secretly switched out the sugar for sweet-n-low to cut costs and the other employees haven't figured it out yet.
---
it sucks, but it needs to be done. it shouldn't have gotten this far, but we're here now and it needs to be corrected sooner rather than later, especially considering leaderboard PVP and player vending coming up.
---
&gt;And tell me how happy do you feel with that choice?
---
why? I'm not dealing in subjectivity here. I'm simply stating facts.
---
&gt;yet you still bitched about the slap damage
---
pretty sure only people like you did. and, like I said about a dozen times by now, they have all moved on.
---
&gt;and lack of things to do in the game ouside pvp.
---
nobody complained about that. they complained about "lack of things to do", period. most people would rather sit iddle than pvp.
---
&gt;I don't have to move on because i will be receiving my pvp servers in March. It's you who will move on after the Adventure Mode Servers will become an empty wasteland with nothing to do.
---
you are delusional, holy shit. that's **never** happening. it's the exact opposite, the remaining players **do not** care about pvp.
---
&gt;You are basically playing Rust just for the Crafting.
---
no, I'm playing Fallout. for Fallout.
---
&gt;Without PvP you will get bored super fast.
---
over 700 hours here. all of it solo.
---
&gt;PvP'ers make their own content while you singleplayer fans wait for Bethesda to issue new content to expand a story that was non-existent from the start.
---
and that's a problem with the game itself. being online of offline has nothing to do with it.
---
Unlikely - Two Shot Explosive followed by Bloodied Explosive though are likely very high on the list.  Possibly AAE too given the short window after patch 5 which brought duping back until the hotfix.  Assassin's/Sentinel armor, possibly some Unyielding armor, Explosive bobbleheads, these are all likely to make the list too.  Possibly Instigating/swing speed melee weapons and such.
---
yes, let's not try to fix the game because it's already broken...
---
You're comment makes a whole lot of sense dude...
---
Also, Duping accounts have started to be banned too. So there's probably less people with "Hundred's of thousands of caps in the bank" than you think. And max cap limit is 25k anyways. So you can only have a max of 125k on 1 account. I think your estimation of duped items people have is waaaay off and you're just pesemistic as fuck about this game like a lot of people on this sub. It's not helpful or constructive. Don't like the game? Stop playing and coming here to complain every 5 minutes.
---
😂😂😂 this is so true! Gotta love getting 1* items from most of the 3* enemies you kill. Queen I quit playing over a month ago, that's pretty sad. Only end game boss and the rewards are so bad that without being able to clear a silo alone or with a buddy with explosive damage easily it just isn't worth my time or resources. It really wasnt worth it with the explosive damage but was something else to do. 
---
Does this post have a point? Or just shitposting?
---
I'm sure they will re-visit the cap once the economy is straightened out. 
---
I haven’t seen anyone launch a nuke in 2 weeks

Don't panic people, he is just guessing...
---
Um, not an exploit? Everyone who sells on Reddit usually has an alt for selling stuff. And we did have to dial it back with the weight limit patch and throw down a lot of weapons and armour we were saving. Not different than having a second or third character for being melee build vs sniper build, we just don't use our second character for actual game play. Why so salty?
---
It's across all platforms and it's just as easy on console as on PC.
---
Pretty sure the only "economy" Bethesda gives a damn about is the one that exists in the real world and the main reason they're removing duplicate items is to hinder ebay item scalpers. 
---
Yes I do like this idea. And I’m not gonna sit here and lie like others like to do, when I bought my two shot handmade off a lvl 180 for only 600 caps I was completely aware of duping and knew it was duped most likely. I just tried and think to myself saying “oh I’m not doing anything wrong because it wasn’t me that duped it” honestly I’m going to miss that two shot but if they bring in the idea of vendors that you were talking about I would be happy. 
---
The Prize Gutsy will now spawn more often, follow you around and accuse you of having duped items constantly.
---
Ladies and gentleman, WE GOT EM.
---
25k is already too little. especially with the price hikes for plans. hopefully the correction in the economy will encourage them to boost both our cap limit, as well as the vendors'.
---
&gt;how am I suppose to know if the item in question is dupped?
---
Exactly. 
---
Also remember when some guys broke into that dev-room with all of that new, unreleased items? When Bethesda said everyone in possession of items from this room will get banned? So when someone placed an illegal item in a bag and I loot it, I would get banned?! So I actually have to take care not to loot forbidden items.
---
Or when players bugged into another vault a week ago? They wrote support tickets and feared to get banned, because they unintentionally glitched into that area.
---
Why do I have to fear that playing this game will get me banned? 
---
Yes, I dramatize. But I hope you get my point.
---
They don't have a UUID mechanism. They could have addressed this two months ago if they did.
---
I use a Vampire's Fire Axe for Whitesprings whack-a-ghouls!  Free healing and cheap to repair too.  Found it in a paper bag in Artisan's Corner one day.  Was using a Vampire's Pick Axe before that looted from a ghoul - only reason I did it was because my All Rise broke then I realized how good it was for that, so I kept it.
---
A low health bloodied melee build?  Forcing you to damage his teammate instead of him?  Slap damage calculation vs reflected damage calculation?  A few possible oversight or mechanics to exploit there.  Can't say which ones are the root cause.
---
"Make a item swap offer" would be a nice thing for player vending machines too. Don't know how it would actually work thou?
---
This was my reaction too.
---
Bethesda:  We are surgically targeting duped items on a specific list held by only a small subset of players.  *disintegrates everyone's stimpacks*
---
Okay,. Makes sense.
---
... People who legitimately had there weapons drop bit remember the last patch. Pretty much everyone haha
---
There are legit sellers such as myself, but it's safe to assume 99% of tse weapons and most 3 star bloodied melee will vanish other than that I'd wager most two or three stars are safe 
---
To clarify, Bethesda can absolutely see which items are duped. Every item has a number associated with it an identification if you will. All the numbers are different so if you picked up two of the exact same weapons from drops they would have different numbers. 
---
When an item is a duplicated the result is the copy of that item with the exact same number as the original. So they will just remove every instance of two or more of the exact same numbers.
---
Why removed duped items I say if you have over 5 or 10 of the same weapon it should be deleted but if you have 1 it won't get deleted
---
I think they got a new sheriff in town lol. U know, the good old Clint Eastwood type.
---
I'm terrified of what happens if you're on the toilet while the script activates 
---
Thats always a chance!
---
Bethesda dupes the dupes of their dupes.
---
Sheesh. Please .. Go play another game. 
---
Please. 
---
You'll be happier. 
---
They are trying to fix the duping issue. Yes, it's gonna be messy. People cheated and they are trying to undo the cheating. It could be that the guped items are actually causing some of the instability on the servers and they *need* to get rid of them to improve the game. 
---
Meanwhile, with each patch, they are clearly trying to address player complaints. 
---
Yes, patches can have unintended consequences. Happens all the time in the real world. I just was interviewing someone who does security patches for a large government agency.  Sometimes the patches they roll out cause other applications to stop working. He said that. This guy is an IT security expert with years of experience and security clearance. Not some kid right out of school. 
---
Quit crying. Go play another game. Maybe it'll have less bugs. If so, I'll be very happy for you. 
---
If you stay, please stop whining when the things that Bethesda does to fix the problems that you have created cause more problems. It happens. It shouldn't surprise anyone. 
---
I'm glad they are gone, come at me.
---
I also don’t know how he was spawning I’m with only half health. Maybe because of rads, idk. 
---
Fear mongering is big business my friend. If people didn't enjoy it then horror movies would never make money. I think the patch will delete ALL Purified water and food stacks and everyone will die...I heard it from my cousin who heard it from their friend at work who heard it from their dog walker...it's legit. Chuckle
---
They're not going to tell you what they know. I am sure they know how many items are dupes. They don't need to tell us anything. They just need to fix it. If you have dupped shit too bad.
---
Not when the duped armor people were wearing disappears lol
---
I have a TSE Handmade that I traded a vampiric SMG for. No idea if the TSE was duped but I made the trade in good faith. Gonna be real bummed if it’s gone, even after the nerf.
---
This if I remember straight they even said they have no way of tracking them.
---
Get wrecked you duping enabled weasles, https://youtu.be/S02BHmWPZNs
---
The only item I have the potential to lose is my X01 Jet Pack Torso I bought from another player a month ago for 900 caps.  And I wouldn't be heartbroken.  I have the X01 plans now and an X01 Motion Assist Servo mod I have been sitting on.  I'll get more use out of the Motion Assist than I have the Jet Pack anyway.
---
Everything else I own is my personal items, that Jetpack Torso was the only thing I ever traded with another player for.
---
I wish they would instead just delete all characters to reset everything. Sure everyone loses hours of their life, but now everything is fair again
---
He has 10,000 bullets, wipe it!
---
well asuming they actualy did unique ids which i sorta daubt, but if they did the can do a full database clean first compiling list of evry itmes on evry account and then delete.
---
Though i believe it will be account or characterbased as u say :)
---
I really don't get that either.... Sneaking around in a 1 ton super armored battlesuit.  Seems like something from a comic strip.
---
Yeah, I got 15 agility plus every sneak-beneficial perk.   I still want to try out a full set of shrouded as well myself.
---
AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY SAID THAT? They wanted you losers who felt the need to cheat and exploit to get comfortable. GET.WRECKED.
---
Well considering they nerfed tse and will probably nerf bloodied and possibly furious, it’s going to be tedious as hell to kill sbq. 
---
The “Oh look we deleted the servers” patch
---
The didn't at the time.
---
Let’s get a moment of silence for every triggered piece of shit bothered by this.
---
Should it never have been possible? Damn straight.
---
Is it still worth fixing? Fuckin’ right bud.
---
When I finally pick this game back up years from now, this kind of ridiculousness will be long forgotten.
---
Everyone is getting antsy over their tse’s but I’m scared of my hella good super sledge that my high level friend gave me. That shit is way too good to not be duped. And I gave away all my other good melee weapons FUCK
---
I think they'll have some problems with their version control again and the next time I boot the game I'm on a carriage with ulfric stormcloak and a thief on my way to helgen.
---
Yeah people who use exploits usually say "It's not an exploit" or "I didn't know it was an exploit". Yet you are having an unfair advantage over others while they struggle with 8+ weight reduction perk ma management, stash management, inventory management, being overweight, not able to fast travel without Excavator fully modded, but you and your buddies just log in an alt and fill it up with stuff. As if that was intended gameplay. Like people who logged out to get extra Excavator carry weight, or refill the fusion core. Or people who move their camp an inch to reset the damage. Or people who used the carry weight glitch. Etc. Who look down on people who bought duped items, as if they never exploited anything.
---
Mommy,daddy, THEY ARE PUNISHING ME FOR ENABLING DOOPERS :*( I DIDNT DOOPE IT MOMMY, I JUST BOUGHT IT, I WANT MY TOYS &gt;:(
---
Thanks for answering without insulting me, lol :D
---
Can you provide a source reference so we know this for a fact?  I suspect their unique identifier is far less unique...  its unique for each item combo.  I see this tossed around but unique identifiers for everything in game would result in excessive amounts of data, its far more efficient to base it on patterns.
---
that's definitely another thing that they are targeting with this, for sure. but it's absolutely not the only thing. people who are against this just because they are losing weapons really aren't seeing the big picture. ebay sellers, player economy, an abundance of op players, upcoming pvp mode that lets you carry over characters, leaderboards for pvp mode, discouraging of cheating/trading for illicit items, etc. there are a ton of reasons why this has to be done. it's going to suck; im ready myself to possibly lose a few weapons im unsure about, but it's gotta be done.
---
Oh thinkgeek is definitely a duper. Sorry man, looks like your valentines day is gonna be less swingin and fistin and more pokin and ... rollin. With your pole hook and rolling pins :)
---
But then I wouldn’t think it would be able to track items that have already been acquired before the patch then. If they do find a way it’s kinda da art because most things they add don’t work right for a couple patch’s which means we might be in for a world of hurt
---
Ayep.  Lost my login, Natasha's, ect.  No logins at all.   I lost all holotapes too.  I did not drop any nor lose them. 
---
What happened was the server was lagging and I tried to turn in the quest to move from the first to the Novice.   I would not give me the holo tape.  I tried for 15 minutes with no luck. Part of the quest moved on, but no holo.
---
So I changed servers and came back and then it gave me notification that I recieved the holotape, but all my other holo's are gone.  Quest is now stuck permanently.
---
It's kinda weird how many of these bugs I've encountered and I just didn't realise that they were bugs. It's only when he points them out I realise why I'm having such a hard time with certain elements of the game - particularly loading in/fighting lots of enemies/animation issues.
---
They didn't. Now they have. And they said that the support team is not able to track single items and isn't able to bring them back. That doesn't mean they can't track them at all. Support can't. Dev can. And do this in this purge. Thumbs up!
---
Still broke BTW. 2 weeks later now.
---
I definitely agree I want to collect  a lot of weapons, but with some being very heavy I can only have a few along with my power armor frames and junk. I think the stash should have at least 1000
---
Oh good thing you added in "Deh gonna fuq uhp doh." at the end, saved yourself from the salty dislike squads.
---
That's the real code:
---
switch (weapon.legendary) {  
---
 case true:  
---
 weapon = new weapon("legendary drill");
---
 case false:  
---
 console.log('No problem');
---
 case ''TSE"
---
 character.delete();
---
 default:
---
 console.log("what happened?!");  
---
 break;
---
}
---
Tomorrows news:
---
we had a critical bug where every character was deleted which had a weapon
---
Yes, we asked like 2 months ago.I doubt anyone cares about dupping at this point because many people left already. I have a little over 400 hours since BETA and i have never been affected by cheaters. If i wasn't reading the forums i wouldn't even know about dupping and stuff. 
---
I said it was the main reason, not the only reason.  
---
I still use a Instigating Power Fist with 40% attack speed increase that is only level 35 as my main weapon that I got from this event.  The right modifier combination makes a huge difference.
---
There will be people crying wolf so you're right - we'll never know for sure unless its something we had that was removed, and no one will believe us either way too.
---
This could very easily destroy the economy further. Punishing people for trading does not exactly give people faith in trading in the future.
---
I don't know what the solution is. Bethesda messed up bigtime when they didn't throw all their resources into stopping duping last December. They let it go on for weeks instead of trying to contain it.
---
I'm happy about the TSE nerf and removing Dupes.
---
I will be impossible to rely on what "internet" will say about the result, just because cheaters always claim they never cheated.
---
I wonder if the vendor bots are currently full of sold off Dupe stuff?  seems the last gasp would be to try to get what few caps you could from mounds of duped items.  
---
*analyst sits down to figure out duplicate items per player*
---
Select 
---
Playerid,
---
weaponID, 
---
count(*) as itemcount
---
 from dbo.weapons
---
Group by weapon id,playerid
---
Playerid.                WeaponId  itemcount
---
XxKiller42069xX    3837383.   197
---
Well, shit.
---
Andddddddd banned
---
😂
---
I have a feeling that they added some sort of item tracking into the code silently with a previous patch or hotfix..
---
Do you ever wonder how certain youtubers have every single type of gun and they are all 2 shot explosive? I didn't get my 1st one until I was level 111. I was so excited but then it became the norm. Now after the last big patch all the dupers left but they still had their inventory. They would be back when Player vendors were introduced. Well this is going to fix that before it happens. Good for Bethesda!
---
Or bloodied melee
---
Awesome 
---
it could be they worked out how to parse their log files and see the duping glitches.
---
my mistake
---
All the assassin/sentinel or cavalier/assassin gear
---
There will be shills pushing that narrative.
---
&gt; and expects it to go horribly wrong 
---
The f'ed up everything so far, why wouldn't we expect it to go horribly wrong?
---
I've noticed that within player made buildings, the rain doesn't pass beyond the roof pieces. The rain will go through the roof itself (and you'll see it) but the rain disappears before it goes any further down.
---
It seems to me that they sorta/kinda fixed it by making the roof a threshold, but they made it stop *after* the roof finishes rather than as it starts.
---
They already confirmed a roadmap by the end of the month
---
I have a friend that got a tse gatling laser ages ago before the duping really happened, I hope he keeps it, it's his only weapon
---
thumbs up for saying smashingly
---
I'm hope they can remove evry last duped item, but i highly daubt it. I have never seen a single tse or even explosive drop tbh. 2shot 1* is pretty common though.
---
There is a button you click to make a second character, or twenty, if you choose to do so..it's in the menu of the game if you missed it. If you make a second character who is player or a second character who stands there and sells stuff they both have the same weight limits as your main character so it's not an exploit...it is built in game function. Now, if I put my character in a box, spam click some storage containers, launch a nuke and blow up a car to crash a server and duplicate my character... that's an exploit of bad coding. This is a button you click on. LoL again, why so salty? Did you not see this button? I can take a screen shot for you? Maybe make a youtube walkthrough video for you to see where the button is? ;)
---
No they won’t. You’re fine. 
---
But then they would have done this a long time ago.
---
They have 2 studios now. The big bois aren't working on this game at all, you know that right? 
---
All good. 
---
they will most likely re-balance the damage output again. The nerf didn't deter the duping as they hoped, and the major problem was that there were tens of thousands of TSE's being moved around. Even if they fixed duping, a large amount of people would still have the items, and potentially be OP... creating an endless circle of rebalancing
---
I played a lot back in November/December and was really involved in trading. I KNOW many of the high-tier items I acquired have to be duped, there just can't be that many legit high-tier items lol. I'm actually excited to see how thorough they are, I hope I get hit hard for the sake of the game's longevity/integrity. I hope that taking actions to remove duped items means they've actually fixed all the exploits though, I don't see a point to removing the items until the dupes are for sure fixed.
---
Some Americans tend to think they're the only country in the world
---
? I didn’t do any exploiting. I sold items lmao I already said it in the first post. 
---
The devs can do anything. the support team, who we can communicate with, does not have the same programs.
---
 The support team is not going to bother the dev with every players lost item request.
---
&gt;Sneaking reverts to former [Hidden] [Caution] [Danger] behavior but turns on your mic whenever you crouch.
---
I guess I'll have to quit yelling SNEAKSING at the top of my lungs while in stealth. 
---
&gt;As long as the purchaser purchased the goods for their market value
---
Interesting caveat. What if the 'market value' is defined by the availability of illicit goods?
---
If, hypothetically, someone flooded the market with bootleg goods to the point where the perceived market value of those goods was based on the value of the bootlegs and not the originals. Would people who bought at that 'market value' be protected?
---
The issue is that dupers already have thousands upon thousands of caps or even real cash from ebay. This fix is coming months too late
---
But then it would require them to still have been recording that data which we don’t know for sure if they were.
---
If nothing else it's becoming clear from reading the various comments just how many people here purchased a TSE.
---
Even if I do loss any of my items I traded for I'll be fine with it. If it helps the game it's worth it in my opinion. 
---
" I think everyone is FREAKING OUT for no reason because of Beths track record. "  Uh....
---
N'aww, so naive, so cute
---
Just because you don't understand what an exploit is, doesn't make it not one. An exploit is any unintended use of a glitch, bug, or feature, often giving that player an unfair advantage over others who don't do such particular thing.
---
People are freaking out because they might lose items they bought, because the items they bought might be duped 
---
Yeah, they need a lock function for no-trade, no-scrap, no-sell, no-drop until you unlock the item first. 
---
Ok, so from what I've been able to find, you get a salute POSE for photo mode from the enclave questline, but the salute emote is an exclusive to the trocentennial edition of the game. 
---
Guess I'll never have it then lol.
---
60% of the time, it works every time.
---
The patch that keeps giving! (though would've fit more for a christmas patch)
---
Glowings seem to have this bug very often. I killed three glowing legendarys at whitespring yesterday and they dropped nothing. I joined another server and killed three not glowing legendarys, they all dropped legendary loot. I think the bug is, that glowing ones don't drop legendarys anymore since they nerfed the glowing loot table. 
---
I think i paid 1k caps for the coat.  Prolly duped.  Never even got to use the shotgun, not level 50 yet.  Oh well.  Hopefully with all the duped TSE weapons getting thanos’d today it will even the playing field.
---
It wasn’t totally serious. I think I have a bloodied fire rate handmade. Even better than BE. But the BE’s were duped too.
---
This is the more plausible idea that Iv seen if it were this easy they would have done it before now but hey didn’t so they had to work in a way to do it. My guess it would be items from maybe early December to later that will get deleted
---
ikr heh
---
All purified water will be removed from the game. Even the functionality to make it.
---
made a way to parse their log files for one.
---
&gt; They're not going to tell you what they know. I am sure they know how many items are dupes.
---
So how do you know? Did they tell you? Why does each item need to have a unique ID? It doesn't.
---
I agree with this completely. It has been my concern from the first time I heard that duping was a thing. 
---
I honestly have a feeling they are simply going to do a count of every "rare weapon," compare ot to the loot table probability and set a threshold of tolearance. If that weapon or item falls outside of the tolerance, then it will be removed fromninventory.
---
I hope they dont do something this stupid or simple but alI am not suprised by anything these days.
---
Luckily just "some" .....
---
The only people to blame for this are the ones that duped these weapons for profit in the first place.
---
or just read their log files.
---
Because Bethesda have definitely earned the benefit of the doubt...
---
Of all the bugs to fix, Feed The People should have been just left in imo. Duping is okay, but can't be handing out canned food. 
---
But...this isn't a glitch, bug or misuse of feature. It's intended gameplay. Every game allows multiple characters. How we use them doesn't affect the weight limit or give an advantage. But hey, you do you buddy. :)
---
There's a huge chance that they DIDN'T know how to track when they said that, then silently added tracking into the game at a later date. It's called problem solving man. (**conspiracy**) Maybe the patch to fix the duping, that  rolled back the duping method by "accident", ACTUALLY included the new tracking method to track the dupers, who continued to dupe.. it's the classic bait-and-switch!
---
No way for me to tell if they're honest about it but given what I suspect Bethesda will do, I'm more inclined to believe that someone loss something they found themselves...  although the large majority of pre-whining I've seen here has come from people that traded for items afraid of losing them.
---
Idk about ALL as I legit farmed 3 and bought 2 
---
Says the people with duped items.....
---
The way this game has been going that must be some sort of 50-fingered RadMonkey.
---
Ran into a guy last night that kept inviting me to trade, every weapon he had was three * bloodied explosive with reload speed  . He looked like a gun show. He was trying to make every cap he could off of them before they disappeared lol
---
That... has nothing to do with it, since 9:00AM EST is the same moment the world round.
---
What does happen is they learn about it "last night" when they started playing and read the news.  And even though it was occurring in say... 9 hours, they refer to it as "tomorrow".  Many people have sleep, work, and school.  Pushing their gameplay time 12+ hours from now.
---
I don't have any duped weapons. Drop the everyone talk. You're still in the minority.
---
Curious. I am not a regular gamer... The only games I play are Forza and FO. So I apologize for the newbie question.
---
What qualifies an item to be "duped"?
---
Most of the "tomorrow" posts were from last night though.  Now they are just talking about the update.
---
Everyone on this sub. Which is a small portion of people that actually play the game. 
---
Thats kinda bullshit, tons of other game companies do that and they have a way higher playerbase. Plus, didn't BGS say this game was supposed to be a service? So I think the support team should tell the devs.
---
Wouldn’t that mean if someone were to light get the item it would have a chance of deleting that item to if it somehow crossed the threshold.
---
Another one of you pie dupers, get 'im boys!  *blows safety whistle*
---
When I stated playing there was no need to trade with others because everything was new and I wan‘t max lvl. 
---
Then dupers appeared and I didn‘t trade with others because I didn‘t want to support the duping. 
---
Then I heard of the bug that ppl where able to steal from you while trading... didn‘t trade with others. Btw. Is this fixed?
---
One time since start I traded with someone else and bought a two shot handmade rifle. He gifted my three jumpsuits at this trade for free. The bos, whitespings and whitepowder one. I deleted these ones because by the time the Dev-room came to notice and I was affreight these come from there. I wasn‘t able to find any data about theses suits at that time.
---
Now I am afreight of loosing my gun that is still in use.
---
I like the decission to delete all duped items and feel sad for everybody loosing some item they bought and didn‘t know they where duped. My conclusion is not to trade with others till I am very sure there will be no hurting consequeses in the future. 
---
I'm convinced they have no staff. 
---
So I guess it’s both Bethesda and the duper’s 
---
Many games release patch notes during the patching (like BGS does).  Some don't release notes till after the patching is done.
---
Yes, which is why I hope theybdon't do something to stupid lol
---
A projectile weapon that is two stars or more of legendary mods, with Two Shot (Double damage) and Explosive modifiers. So a Combat Rifle that does 50 damage normally, does 100 damage from Two Shot, and then additional damage from Explosive. The damage is then modified based on perks. so a TSE is Two Shot and Explosive legendary mods on one weapon.
---
At least, this was the case, and people had TSE weapons doing thousands of points of damage, effectively one-shooting other players. So Two Shot and explosive mods were heavily nerfed.
---
That totally depends on the database.
---
I kinda expect they just parsed their log files.
---
I highly doubt people will lose item they got from trades
---
I’ll be honest, I don’t remember how I got them, I just got them organically during gameplay. But they’re just an armor mod for combat armor, like Fiberglass or Polymer
---
Ot doesnt help. What I do is get a group together, it usually happens on it's own, ontop of the Bush in front of whitesprings. Ill open the map, click someone's icon and say play with them. I get kicked to lobby and then pirbright back into the game and after a few minutes all the enemies reload. I usually try to make sure every one understands to use low damage weapons while 1-2 people melee kill things. It works so well. 
---
I'm so excited for it tbh.
---
So you’re sayin’ there’s a reason, I see.
---
Especially  after the duping glitches were made public. It was clear that a purge  would come. And when I read "bought my TSE and I think it's duped" - you shouldn't have in the first place. The fence is no better than the thief or the con-man in this case. Happy purging everyone!
---
Well, lets just wait and see. The update starts in 13 minutes 
---
this is what you get it. TAKE THE L AND MOVE ON.
---
I agree, but Bethesda is also at fault for taking so long to patch it. 
---
With Elmers glue
---
That would make sense... factoring CND into stats rolls, levels, order of stats... to "legitimately" aquire two identical legendary weapons is minute.
---
I switched to melee after the first Nerf. Just hoping none of my sledgehammers are duped
---
I should only lose a single weapon I barely use unless I’m bounty hunting. So no big deal
---
Exactly. Sorry weasels, we're not all degenerates.
---
Good thing this ain't a legal issue since no real money is involved. 
---
Sounds like a good idea actually. Do molerats spawn inside the tent?
---
Oh, they would be keeping their logs. It is hell to try to debug something without being able to see the logs of when the bug was hitting.
---
Wow.... that’s a tough gig for a 7 yr old!!
---
I love this kind of thing in game though. Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/aqcmu6/fallout_strangers_discordgg8mmtbmm/?st=JS4I09GG&amp;sh=a85907ce) out...
---
If you ever used the duped stimpaks then they will remove the health gained; you will spawn in the world being dead.
---
1k isn’t unreasonable. There was a guy selling them for 75 at one point. No way they were obtained legitimately. 
---
I still only have all rise  at 140 lol. :(
---
Patch Notes.
---
Server cost fix.
---
There are too many players playing and not spending money on atom store. Delete player items in effort to reduce server costs.
---
I went through every game I'm playing right now an all of them except 76 release notes 1 day - a week before patches. They promised communication an all they give out is vague lines they will let us know more. It's time they let us start knowing it's been over 3 months an their is still bugs that don't let alot of people even play this game.
---
Exactly. There's plenty of people here acting like they've never encountered dupes and talking down about everyone worried. 
---
There is no way they backtracked all the duped items lol. You realise all of those items changed hands multiple times, were dropped in bags and picked etc. There is no way they suddenly developed a way to backtrack all of those things months after it happened.
---
The servers and obviously the database are trash as is and you're honestly expecting they keep logs of items exchanging hands  for months after it happened? They can't even let you have more than 600 lbs in your stash "because of stability".
---
At best they found a way to tag new stuff that dropped after they first started fixing the duping exploits.
---
I do find it interesting that support has told me in the past it cannot restore items has figured out how to pull them.  I have zero faith in their ability to do this correctly...  Hopefully they'll spare my junk...  :P
---
If they do this, it will be looking for 3+ items of the same type, with the same legendary effects, with the same max condition.
---
The Dupening
---
They have said they can see if you have excessive items such as nuka cola, ballistic fiber scrap, or whatever. There was a post of the Bethesda forums a while back that stated this when they were banning suspected duper’s
---
Nothing has happened yet. Reserve judgement until after the purge. If everyone loses legit stuff I'll be right there with you. 
---
This is called Rain Occlusion.  It is taxing on performance, therefore I'm sure it's disabled because the games already struggling to run for most 
---
I would say “most if not all.”  ‘Murica!
---
Something I mentioned, but the legal principle is based on an ethical understanding, which is applicable in this situation, still. 
---
I don't know. I think they know things they don't need to tell us. They wrote the game I am sure they have ways to tell. They know when people are duping, they have watched them do it. Your inventory is part of a DB. All they have to do is ask hey does player X have 100 items of the same thing?
---
Doesn't matter. It's not rocket science to figure this out. You can't tell me (if you've played a lot) that you haven't come across another player just selling the same gun to everyone for caps.
---
The dupers left after they fixed duping. Not they need to deal with the player who has 1000's of duped items. 
---
BRING IT ON! I can't wait to see these people cry me a river!
---
It’s definitely a tough situation.  On one hand, the duper’s should be the ones being punished and it sucks that they are kind of getting away with a lot of it.  On the other, I can’t imagine anyone who bought weapons recently was unaware that what they were buying was likely duped and that they were creating demand and compensation for the process.  
---
Instigating Grognaks Axe with melee build is a 1 shot machine for anything but Behemoths and SBQ
---
Lol right, I don't get it, does people think reddit is one person?
---
Yeah, it would be nice if the support team had that ability. I guess theres always the question of verifying whether you had said item or not.
---
I don't think they even have the capability...
---
yeah its toast lol
---
Innocent players :) that's funny. "Hey let me just buy this legitimate weapon online for real money  - what could go wrong" or "Wow man, you're going to sell me a 3\* for 500 caps and you're only level 10, sure this seems ok" And for these "innocent people" i doubt had a normal grind - just sayin!!
---
At the very least, stop the terrible re-sort. I hate having to chase items down in my inventory.
---
Well the dev team can always track what you had in your inventory earlier
---
Yes. I think that making the whole thing a blueprint just doesn't work. If there's any "object" in the way at the new location, it interferes. That's why I said i'd prefer to just have tha issue fixed. That's not simple though. If I build a camp on a flat place, then it shouldn't work if I try to place it on a steep hill next. The challenge is that there are locations that looks like they should work, but don't. 
---
I think more worried about them coming and taking my tse ultracite laser rifle. It's 100% not dupped as I found it myself. Just worried they will use the moment to remove all those cool legacy weapons. I do have a explosive cyro but that I traded for so who knows. We shall see in a few hours. 
---
Lmao! Well, there goes my coffee! 
---
Assign each item a hexadecimal code during world generation... I don't see that being too hard to see each VIN number, as it were, and remove the copies, but I don't data mine so not sure how they code them.
---
Worse...  Dupers sold their stuff to vendors for caps, and some players likely bought them that way.
---
*"Anyways, it is not our fault that we have duplicated items."* \- Dear Sir, let me have a good laugh on you.
---
hahahahahahahahahahaha...
---
*"Hey Officer, I didn't mean to con the old women. But it was so damn easy. So I am not responsible. She is."*
---
Can they they really tell if a single item is duped? I have a tse 2 star combat shotgun I bought for 1000 caps from a player at Whitespring.  It's fun to play with but it's not really that powerful.  
---
'I don't know how it works but it works this way'
---
 - You
---
Take all the atoms a I have saved up. This is it.
---
I'm hoping the items that I have found including my two AA and two TSE weapons do not get removed. I expect my purchased items to have a chance of removal but honestly it's probably best to fix the player economy.
---
IF they do it correctly. 
---
Which they probably won't lol
---
Yeah thats insane lol.  Looking back I wish I pulled the trigger on the cowhide western outfit in the atom shop months ago lol
---
so mature
---
Where have you been since launch? This is the most inept dev team in the gaming industry.
---
It’s gonna be fresh, fresh...exciting!  Stay classy Kool and the Gang.
---
If the market value did drop to substantially low levels due to an influx if counterfeit items, then that wouldn't protect purchasers. 
---
Example - on xboc, keather travellers coat dropped from approx 1.5k a piece, to 100 caps! 
---
Someone who purchased this item st 1.5k caps (even if it originally was duped), ethically, should be protected. The user who bought it for 100 caps - shouldn't be. 
---
It's possible, they may have records of every trade ever done, every time someone loots something, etc. They probably didn't care enough to set that up before launch, but who knows maybe they're really anal about it
---
What platform you on? I'm on Xbox and have a vampiric power fist. It's yours if you want it.
---
The scorchbeast queen and generally launching nukes, that's it. The Vault raids will possibly be end game content when released.
---
&gt;Slap damage now works as designed. Down side is that it now works as designed.
---
Wat?
---
I've gotten a 45 miner gauntlet during it. 
---
The only winning move is not to play.
---
\--SNIP
---
 Anyways, it is not our faults that we have duplicated items. It is  Bethesda’s. The duplication glitch should have been patched DAY 1! Since  the development team is lazy and ineffective people were duplicating  for over a month before it was patched. This made almost every piece of  good weapon and armor on the market duplicated. 
---
\--
---
I guess you don't work as a developer in any way shape or form.
---
Coding takes time, testing takes time, they h ad to ensure there were no other flaws in what they were doing and Again they are trying to please all sides of the community.
---
Have you ever considered the holiday periods they have had? Unlikely.
---
Have you considered that they have been firefighting this issue as opposed to letting it continue? Unlikely..
---
Have you considered that they Still have to produce new content and bug fixes for other things At The Same Time. Unlikely...
---
Give them a break, they are trying to juggle everything at the same time.
---
I personally don't think I have any duped items, if I do, oh well, things happen and I really don't mind if I lost anything. 
---
Main point, if they can tell what is duped. They can and will nuke those responsible and anyone caught up having collected those ill gotten gains will have to pay too.
---
Perhaps there will be less griefing too as I suspect all those people paid for those duped items in one form or another.
---
Ass I have stated to my guild many times.
---
It was coming, Bethesda knows what has been duped, they will take action once they are 99.9999% sure they can kill it off dead in its tracks.
---
All big MMO's log Everything in game.
---
Valve has VAC etc so its no shock this is happening.
---
Just need to get over it and move on, maybe play the game a bit more and hunt down that weapon you have been craving. I know I am still looking, still killing and hoping that drop is exactly what I want.
---
Till then, i'll still keep on hunting.
---
What drugs are you on? Can I have some?
---
I would take 5000 cans of dog food. 
---
I dunno, I'm prolly going to lose my weapon, but I just might go play again. It was boring running around and farming everything
---
Yes, we should expect (a lot of) collateral damage.
---
There are just 2 (or 3) solutions to that problem.
---
1) Every item has a "unique" ID - don't count on that, because we would have seen that in the community patch notes, right? So a clean removal of duplicated items is not possible.
---
2) Likelihood analysis of drops compared with their databases. But there is also one big problem. Some players reported a salted drop chance depending on the server for legendaries. So you can't just take an average drop chance for items, but should rather do a proper MCMC analysis. This should also be weighted, because most players will server hop to increase their drop chances. I doubt that Bethesda would have invested that amount of time/money in a solution. More likely they will just take an average value and delete everything above a threshold. It would be quite interesting how they handle bobbleheads and valuable junk.
---
3) (Shutdown the Servers.) Fix the bugs, balance the game, reset the servers/characters and give away atoms correlating to time players have spent in this game FOR FREE for compensation.
---
**TL;DR** \- Proper removal of dupes will most likely not happen. Salted drop chances would require weighted MCMC analysis and I doubt Bethesda invested time/money in a solution. So happy firework.
---
I have killed it twice now, you are not missing much....
---
I'm betting a WHOLE ONE CAP that none of them will disapear into Bethesda's Dungeon 
---
What's really funny is that all the people who spent money on stuff are likely the only people enthusiastic enough to keep playing.  I'm not saying that's right, but if they get hit with the dupers and lose their TSE weapons they used to reduce the grind of this game, BSD may actually end up shooting themselves in the foot.  What's even better is that there are still ways for dupers to dupe out there.  It's like using a pale to save a sinking ship... the size of Titanic.
---
When people exploit glitches to make copies of items they obtained. They use the glitches to get hundreds or even thousands of an item they originally only had one of. This is incredibly unfair to people who don’t exploit glitches, so Bethesda is finally patching it out. 
---
Id assume any high end armor piece you traded for is gone, until you check after. If you picked it up yourself then obviously nothing to worry about.
---
I think I agreed with you on that point.   But in the context of this discussion, it's people basically complaining because they don't like the solution to the cheating, even if it turns out that the solution makes the game more stable, they still are gonna whine. 
---
You realise that the logging system is entirely separate from the rest of the system right?
---
The restrictions on their database has ZERO to do with their logs.
---
I agree. The problem is when you're trying to place the base you already had on a location, on that same location and it doesn't work. People were claiming it was with stuff hanging over mulriple floors (wires I guess) but I've honestly got no clue. I just never bothered with counting on blueprints after the first few times where it just flat out didn't work and realised every time I move, I'm rebuilding the base manually.
---
It's the right choice on many levels. It will improve gameplay and make it better once again.
---
If you spend real money on such stuff, you deserve it.
---
At this point, does it matter? Too many people have given up playing this game. Anthem will grab the multiplayer while the outer worlds will take the solo players. I logged in for about 20 minutes last week, and I just couldn't get into it anymore no matter how much I wanted to.
---
Exploiting any loophole is prohibited in games (terms of service) and in the real world (laws).
---
Destroy golf course camps with turrets 😂 and take workshops #raiderlife
---
The easiest place to get the medical googles is the Ranger District Office in Cranberry Bog.  Farm there quite a bit for BOS helmet, welding mask, medical googles, and ranger outfit.(plus it's a location with a chainsaw span)
---
I imagine the dev room items are probably going to get axe'ed too.
---
Is assassin gear any good? I feels like it’s the most common legendary I get, and I sell it all cause I’m mostly pve 
---
This is me. I was unaware of the impending Purge and bought a TSE handmade off a guy last night. Don't really have a good idea if he was selling duped items or not, but he did mention he was in a "hurry to make some caps."
---
I won't be happy if I happened to have bought a duped item, but I'm not going to ragequit over a bunch of caps
---
However, now that I've seen how the other half lives, I *really* want a legit TSE.
---
These aren't real items though. 
---
This shithole of a subreddit doesn’t need a patch day to bitch and complain.
---
WHY IS EVERYONE YELLING AT ME?!
---
If items get unique ID upon generation ie killing the enemy to get the legendary, then it would be straightforward to see when that ID exists more than once. 
---
Why shouldn't they be? They don't have intricate knowledge of market forces, they might not even know the 'true value' (1.5k) of an item. What if they only looked at the market after the prices crashed and all they have ever known is 'Item X costs 100 caps'? Why should this person not be 'ethically' protected?
---
Duping and market manipulation lasted so long that it's quite likely a lot of people purchased at the duped price without ever knowing it was not the true value. Otherwise the line of 'You should have known something was fishy when buying at that price' would work.
---
Same. I got a AA Deathclaw Gauntlet awhile back with swing speed and reduced weight awhile back and I'm hoping it wasn't duped and I get to keep it.
---
Children always cry when they get punished for being naughty.
---
It’s too little too late. 
---
I think after all the supper items disapear, stability will magically be fixed and we can bump to 800 or 1k
---
I just got level 50 and traded all my caps (4k) for 3 max level 3\* Weapons last week... if they are gone or just 1 of them im gonna be pissed. I also doubt that the dupers are responsible for shitty servers and lags.
---
Guess at this rate I won't ever know if they wipe my inventory. First time in 30yrs of gaming I've walked away from a game I loved because of horrid mismanagement and I was there for some really rough launches. A relatively recent example being the original ESO launch 
---
why would you trust these weasels on reddit anyway.
---
Only thing I'm worried about is my perfect deathclaw gauntlet and one three star unyeilding I found in a watoga vendor.
---
Shoot people who don't want to be shot then take their stuff.
---
1 and 2 star assassin is just vendor most times. If its 3 stars, depends. 
---
People are going to lose items they traded for.  I didn’t realize there were so many +1 perception TSE lever actions until yesterday.  I spent 2.5k on mine several weeks ago.  Its certain to be gone later.
---
There's plenty of people still playing. Stop being so dramatic. 
---
That's because people who have mules with 1000 2 shot explosive gun will be crying. 
---
Too bad!
---
To these people: See ya later! Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Thank you!  I appreciate it, though as you can imagine I'm pretty skeptical.
---
I'm incredibly excited for our third impact on dupers. Yeah, so some of you were tricked. THIS HAS TO BE DONE, ACT LIKE AN ADULT AND TAKE THE L. 
---
Today is purge day, the salt will flow.
---
I still have yet to see this dupeing I’m just now lvl 67 and I’m just finished the quest to getting a nuclear key card and codes 
---
I thought about why they were so vague, its like when police wont answer any questions because it could ruin the integrity of the investigation.
---
The thing is, I dont know what dupers could possibly do to get around it, everything is stored on the servers, they are breaking the connection between us and the servers, pretty much holding everyone hostage.
---
Its not like they could shelter all their dupes to an offshore server while this maintenance blows through.
---
Theres nowhere to hide, so why be vague about whats about to happen?
---
I like running around and meeting new people tho
---
This. Had I known about this bug I would've never purchased the Vault-Tec tents off the Atom Shop.
---
Is it weird I never build a toilet in my camps.  Even the very decorated and elaborate ones.  
---
I may try that. I'll see if I toss some random invites and get responses. I always figured that was a bit intrusive so I tried to avoid it.
---
Ever heard the phrase
---
Sounds too good to be true?
---
Pissed or not, its the equivalent of handling stolen goods.
---
And where have you been? server crashing, lag, can be put down to much duping activity.
---
If after this its not resolved then we can get the pitchforks out for those server issues.
---
Dont make me hope that ill get my AAE Gauss back. Please.. I really thought i was over it...
---
You must be new, this company is known for those lies, those sweet little lies.
---
I literally said this....
---
"Now, obviously these items in FO76 are duped, and not real property or personal property, so no one can sue Bethesda under this principle...."
---
My macro point is that laws are based on ethically principles. 
---
So while this law is not applicable to this FO76 matter, the ethical principle behind it, is still applicable. 
---
MTV Cribs: Fallout 76 Edition
---
I seriously need someone to make a video like this.
---
Just proves.....humanity is still alive and well.....on Fallout 76 (for the moment!)
---
Nice post. 
---
Other people. Not me. 
---
You didn't read your EULA very well when you installed the game. Items in almost everygame are the sole property of the game developer and have no legal status or value. Bethesda could do a clean wip of the entire game and reset it back to launch and nothing could be done about it. 
---
When you bought the game, you bought a lisence to access the game and it's associated servers. You don't own any of the code, ietms, characters, blah, blah, blah, that come from playing the game.
---
Yes and no...  aside from the colossal screw up that bound to happen, the people that spent money on weapons (right or wrong is the subject for a different debate) are probably some of the more enthusiastic patrons of the game who use those weapons to reduce the grind a bit.  Combine recent nerfs with the straight up loss of cash purchased items, and they may just quit.  Again, right or wrong, BSD took a very RNG approach to the high end of this empty game.  People found a way around it, and now they may lose it to their real world cost...  I'd hate to see this action result in more lost players.  The dupers will just move on.
---
Farm for legendaries and grief players using OP duped gear.
---
if you are inside of a power armor get out and try to place it again, sometimes you are too tall in power armor to set down another chassis. mostly in places with a lower ceiling
---
I hope they delete your account and ban you from the game.
---
Nah I love my mr handy vampire. Great for nuke zones. 
---
not really. even if the stuff I suspect is duped is deleted, I still farmed Whitesprings long enough to have similar equipment. I can still oneshot most people and kill ghouls before people get to tag them.
---
and you can bet everyone else is on the same boat by now.
---
Did you not read Bethesda's post?  It said that you may lose items that you bought from other players and did not dupe on your own.
---
That "may" is very frustrating.  No one knows what they're going to step into in a few hours.
---
It was the best of times.
---
I had my camp here for a bit, very cool.
---
No, her name is Chally.  She is a Moo-Moo.  If she had one head, he'd just call her Chally the Moo.  
---
The bigger question is what kind of a basket case would Chally be if she could understand that Graham is always talking about meat?
---
How are they going to know if its duped?
---
That is true. A market crash does make it harder to assert who purchased an item in good faith, making them a bona fide purchaser, and who knew that piece if unyielding 3 star weapon reduction chest piece was duped, as the seller haf 100 of it selling them at 50 caps each. 
---
This isn't a patch. It's a server maintenance 
---
&gt; max level 3\* Furious Grognak axe with 90% weight reduction and +40% power attack
---
Its fantastyc, I bought 2, 1 for my brother and one for me, its definetly dupped
---
Dunno. They said they could tell.
---
Why do you ask? We are all not working at Beth. And when we do, we are not free to say. Nobody knows. All is speculation. Wait till the servers back online and you will see.
---
People are just Fearmongering. if you stuffs legit no worries.

The post makes it sound that if you acquired a dupe, you may see it gone tomorrow.

It’s because they have an unethical motive behind the bitching.

Moo.  Answers to the name Moo.  Answers twice to the name Moo-Moo.

They are likely just going after legendaries with the same modifiers.  In my case I have 2 lvl 45 TSE lever actions with +1 perception.  Anyone with the same will probably lose theirs.

They will just dupe them again lol

Don't forget the effects of Anaconda Malt Liquor

Read this quote - "Now, obviously these items in FO76 are duped, and not real property or personal property, so no one can sue Bethesda under this principle..."

I KNOW this isn't a legal issue, however legal principles are based on ethical principles, which do still apply in this matter.

[prediction of tomorrow in this sub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)
---
Yeah like Fallout 76. Sounded too good to be true.
---
You're *already* rejecting any future claims that Bethesda have executed a ham-fisted purge?
---
I hope you lose your whole inventory.
---
Some people when the game first launched said fix the game an don't add any content until then. So the rate they fix the right stuff expect new content in 5 years.
---
It won't help.  I subbed a ticket about lost items from stash before and was told on two separate occasions that they have no way to restore items or progress.
---
I don't think they're worried about stimpacks. I think if you have 20-100 guns of the same type ya that might be a problem.
---
RC
---
they still exist, but many duped ones may be removed within a few mins/hours
---
And I hope the same for you.
---
They neutered my TSE Gauss anyway, my original melee build/weapons do more than it does anymore so I guess if it gets ripped then it's not a loss anymore lol.
---
listen to the song sixteen tons on Appalachia radio, that pretty much sums up the end game. Grind. Grind. Grind.
---
"There is no spoon"
---
Only seen it with Supermutants...   
---
You're saying robots as well?  
---
Link to the clip would be fantastic.
---
So 99% will be gone 
---
That does help.
---
You do realised logs are part of the database servers right?
---
Db crashes-&gt;you use the backup that you made at certain time-&gt;you use the logs to fill up the backed up db up to the point where the crash happened
---
If they were able to do what you're implying why do it now. It's too late, if they had the way to track all of that from the start they'd have a way to actually fix it and it wouldn't take months to write a script to do that.
---
I also still claim there is no way they're holding onto all of those logs. Months of tracking for every single item that changed hands and/or was dropped and picked up by thousands and thousands of players on god knows how many servers, are you serious?
---
Now you've said it twice 
---
Wow. A whole 90 days. Shouldn't they be continuing to fix the game before adding anything to it?
---
Ack, I've been caught projecting lol. 
---
Honestly I'm excited, it's going to be chaotic as hell. I'm just gonna sit back and watch the fireworks. 
---
Either that or the fireworks will be duds. 
---
Well I have an 2* anti-armor + 40% more power attack DMG one spare if you want it..
---
Yeah let me trim it and upload it! 
---
I think people are overthinking / estimating the ability of Beth to retroactively track / monitor things.
---
Most likely situation:  People with Thousands of duplicated items actively stashed away on their characters and mules get purged after the last update locked them down.
---
The chances of them finding the 300 adhesive or 1 weapon sitting on a single character who isn't hording dupes being minimal.
---
They previously locked down the ability for users to use those characters efficiently.  And now those that did not purge themselves already will be purged by Beth.
---
Probably until they can fully fix the duping issue
---
Wierd situation here.   The Deathclaw spawn is very far from that building that has the chem station in it.
---
Either you or another player had to have dragged those to that building for that to happen.
---
I built a fusion generator. In a Cave, from a box of Scraps. But can't cast some screws
---
I don’t think so. When two shot explosive were OP    As hell everyone wanted one. Now that they’re nerfed they are not worth 10000 caps. Economy is going to get fixed 
---
no one could legitimately get 10 corn soup, you must be a duper
---
What about people who simply traded with other people and now worry that their executioners 10mm was duped and will be deleted.  
---
*in theory* they now have a system in place to detect stacks and whatnot.
---
although duping itself will always be a problem because, well, this is a Bethesda game.
---
I wonder if they actually purge all duped guns (I'm still skeptical) will it be easier for them to monitor new dupes being made and banning. Otherwise I agree dupes just going to pile up again since they havent come close to permanent fix yet
---
Nice try.  Europe is a hoax by the liberal media to make hard-working Americans believe in the existence of universal healthcare.
---
HOLY DUCK THE FLAMING CHAINSAW IS REAL??? ILL PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THAT SHIT!
---
Lol on me! Exactly, there are still going to be plenty of effective weapons in the game.
---
Lots and lots of respecs once again.
---
I throw legendary items in that suitcase all the time.
---
Cheers Mate...  I bet they tell us the same thing again though after they fuck up the purge.
---
RIP TSE minigun. The only way that thing is even remotely useful. 
---
More than likely, whilst good in theory about getting rid of duped items in game they should of patched all the known duping methods first before acting out order 76.
---
Otherwise duping will continue after the purge and we'll see further purges in the foreseeable future 
---
There was a container outside the Flatwoods church into which someone had placed over 600 diluted stimpaks. I initially snatched them up, but after a while started wondering about their origin, so I dropped an equal amount to what I'd picked up. But there's no way to be sure the the game dropped exactly the ones I'd picked up, or if it dropped most of what I had picked up and some of my own legit stash - meaning I may still be carrying contraband. I admit the chance of these stimpaks being dupes is low (kind of like the chance of a random $5 bill in your wallet being counterfeit), but there's no way to know for sure.
---
There's some of us that are honest nice people. I mean, I'm an asshole, but I'll help you out if I can. I have a few lower levels i take on white spring runs, or get them a better weapon for the materials. One day you'll be a higher lv and can return the favor, or not. Dose not matter. We had fun. 
---
I can't verify my TSE I was given but I know my HLC was legit cause I server hopped for hours with my husband. IDC about my gun but if that goes I will uninstall this game NEGL.
---
I am going of pure assumption and speculation. I have bought a total of 5 TSE weapons, for 2-3.5k caps each. These were traded. It will piss me off to lose these, but more so my own TSE pump shotty, that i got myself through farming springs. I am interested to find out how they are siphoning out these duped weapons. I think what they will do is just input code to delete all traded TSE weapons and a stored abbundance of these weaps. Anyone know anything more?
---
Well, where did you find it?  
---
Regardless of providence the larger discussion I was having with the OP and others was the larger scale traders / merchants using Reddit and other platforms for trading.   
---
The more active traders can't have not know some of the more commonly duped items 
---
so does that me that ~~you~~...err those dupers will find another game to go ruin for profit?
---
Days like these I’m glad I enjoy the grind and farm everything myself 
---
I'll admit that could be the case, and I don't actually know enough about the inventory structure to weigh in on what's most likely.  I've got doubts though
---
Cry me a river?
---
TLDNR version,  you bought duped items.  And I don't know why you think your long standing legal principle is a real thing.  If you buy stolen property Irl, it's subject to being seized by the police without compensation for you 
---
If you have just a two shot or an explosive it should be fine. It’s when you have both on the same gun for a very popular weapon (like the handmade or a shotgun) is when it’s more than likely a dupe. 
---
Weapon Artisan perk under Intelligence. For Armor and Power Armor there is also Fix It Good perk there too. These two perks give 200-200% durability when fully unlocked
---
Without duping issue with 10k caps you can barely buy a TSE pipe pistol.
---
There's always the possibility that they did not lie.
---
That when they said they couldn't they couldn't.
---
But that they have developed the capacity to do so since that statement was made.
---
Market is going to get jacked. Mid tier weapons will go to high tier prices and high tier stuff will only be traded for other high tier stuff. People will now over value everything.
---
I only had to go one deep in my game list to find a company that releases notes during the patching.  
---
Epic Games
---
Brutal...   
---
And /Wave... (Thirdstorm on Nexus)
---
Got an email notification about a PM, been ignoring nexus for a few months, need to check my messages :)
---
 Then being aware that it was duped is not relevant to the fact that he broke the economy of the game.  This is clearly being implemented to justify bringing existing characters into survival mode. 
---
32 years old, living in New York City. My day job is in tech support, but in May I'll be graduating with a Master's in Social Work. Between a 40 hr work week at my main job, 20 hrs a week at my field placement, 5 classes and a thesis paper on top of that... I don't get a ton of time to play Fallout at the moment.
---
Seriously. While I’m obviously against duping, base weapon damage is god awful for end game. That combined with the nerf to two-shot and explosive weapons is going to make enemies that much more bullet spongey.
---
Thats the risk of dying right there.
---
I don't think you should know who did it as it encourages Griefing.  The person who took your stuff was valid.  
---
They would have have that mechanic in game if not.  Plus how would you KNOW who did it if your like a mile away when it was picked up?
---
id say 97.12, but that is just an estimate. 
---
&gt;!even though the gatling gun was infinitely more popular due to it's per shot damage being way higher, so i expect many more of those to be removed!&lt;
---
This is not a patch. Illiteracy is rampant.
---
There is no correcting the economy after the last patch.  There's no market so to speak, and there are only seven vendor pools of 200 caps each.  All the while there are tons of plans that cost thousands.  The game is really starting to feel like a mobile game grind.  I kinda wish I had the money I spent in the Atom Shop back.
---
What kind of uncultured swine doesn't know HER name is CHALLY.
---
I'm here to call you a silly goose. "Don't you see, WE NEED THOSE EXPLOITERS TO KEEP THE GAME ALIVE"
---
I have a couple friends that leed ghouls to me and kill me and they want me to kill the ghouls for the loot and it was right after the nerf to explosives. I have another friend that is cool and if i find a legendary i let him hit it but not the other friends.
---
I would highly doubt any All Rise's are duped.  It's a quest item that anyone can get.  More likely, people sold them because they don't want them.  I'd assume you got them in Watoga because that's where you earn it.  Note that it can be as high as level 50, so if you're level 50 or higher, go to Watoga and do the "Mayor for a day" quest.
---
You can make 4K caps in a day
---
Very nice, I love it! 
---
Are you really magic!? 
---
Bethesda can't win 
---
Go back a reread my comment. I specifically mentioned weapon artisan. I was under the impression it was bugged and didn’t work for the grognak axe. 
---
The Charleston random event vendor sells it. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mExSfkl83Ho
---
Build a bridge and get over that river.
---
So that's where all the jet has got to in fo76!
---
This mentality is why the United States still has a bipartisan system. 
---
The devil is in the details. Wonder how many other stealth nerfs will be included with the maintenance...
---
Got my popcorn ready for the shit show if they actually thanos all the duped guns 😄
---
I can understand the secrecy on this one.  They didn't want people to be able to prep what every craziness they might try to save their stuff.  I will bet this will result in a net loss of players.  
---
Bruh TSE lever action with +1 P was the first gun I stopped buying after I realized how badly it was duped 
---
probably. the effort must not be worth it anymore, not for a dying playerbase.
---
Not going to lie... I'm a little nervous. I have some items that might disappear but that's not what's making me nervous. I more worried about what Beth deletes that's not duped or what they break that isn't broken.  I honestly can't remember what I traded for and found with the exception of my primary gun. I was so excited when I found it I yelled out loud and woke up my wife. 
---
Anecdotally - I went back to fo4 a couple days ago to play, and now there’s a bug where I can’t download mods? Can’t ever win.
---
Damn this is fantastic!  
---
Away from my desk but will work through this later today.  
---
Thanks.
---
So 3 days worth of vendor runs.
---
Big fucking deal.
---
I still see tonnes of people nuking Whitesprings. It's an even split between there and the fissure for me. 
---
I wonder if the bloodied explosive lever action i got free was a dupe
---
You are right, but given their previous botched fixes, it doesnt give players much confidence that they can pull off a precision strike without a lot of collateral damage.
---
Sorry but this is extremely ignorant. People who have items they don’t even know are duped are not exploiters. And since so many items were duped and spread that’s about 80% of players who have duped items right now. Some know and some don’t know. 
---
You know there is a StealthBoy mod for power armor, right?
---
I duping exploits exist because the game is designed so that you don't lose items to glitches (unless I am totally offbase). It's a trade off: prioritize one or the other but they probably can't eliminate both.
---
I have a theory they don't want the game to continue. They have their sales and if you play or not they don't get anymore money.  They make more money if less people play because they don't need as many servers. They also have an excuse to kill the game if the population gets too low. They can just release private servers on PC and be done with the game.
---
List in no particular order:
---
1. It looks like they've put a system in place to identify duping.  My guess is that it's been in place for about a month.  
---
2. There will be mass deletions and bans today.  Especially you AAE and BE dupers.  You know who you are.
---
3. Since this game still costs a good bit of money, the dupers will move on to free-to-play games.
---
&gt;  all trades
---
When you start with all or nothing concepts, you fail to have a meaningful discussion.
---
People knew what was being duped commonly, and should have always been suspicious, and adjusted their offers accordingly.
---
This dude is seriously like a cartoon character
---
Those people have ALREADY stopped playing. The nerfed explosive guns. The ones they were dupping in the 1000's.
---
I am not sorry to see them go. They were lagging the servers and ruining the economy.
---
I don't feel sad for them one bit.
---
This makes sense to a non technical person like me, at some point put something in that helps track the items. I’m guessing that it only works for armor and weapons though. Not sure if it is even possible to dupe things like flux or chems or recipes/plans (or caps), but those don’t seem to be unique, because you can legitimately and regularly have more than one of those, and would be impossible to identify a duped item? Maybe someone with better knowledge would correct me. 
---
My only concern with duped items for my character would be if you can dupe plans or flux, as I have traded in game mostly for those things. The weapons and armor I have traded for have not been anything most people care about
---
Yeah and you do you, deceive yourself.
---
They did from time to time.  
---
And they also left bags of goodies around the wasteland.  
---
All of that was done deliberately to muddy the waters and try and force Bethesda away from exactly what they are doing today.  
---
Guess Bethesda called their bluff, for good or ill.
---
You do realize, that duping is still a thing? It wasn't patched out.
---
you people said the same about the TSE nerf. with the same snarky attitude nonetheless. and it *did* put a dent on the total player count.
---
what do you think is gonna happen when Bethesda outright removes the TSEs?
---
Hey, so, not to seem like a dick, but I'm not going to reply with something along the lines of "Why wouldn't we expect a fuck up?" because I'm currently feeling happy lying in this bed, so, yeah... Hope you have a nice day...
---
oh no! If the weapon I bought from a vendor ended up being duped, I won't neck over it.
---
I see you parrot the term "Ethical standard" in this.
---
There is also the Ethics of knowing duping was going on and buying items anyway, without knowing beyond a reasonable doubt that the items were not duped.
---
So where are your ethics then?
---
I'm Kalle and also from Sweden. 28 years old and work in the HR business
---
You do know that TSE’s were not the only things mass
---
duped right? They were just the only things people wanted. Now all the other duped legendaries are being bought and traded without people even knowing they were duped.
---
I got all of them, had a bunch of atoms saved. I love them. 
---
&gt;  if you play or not they don't get anymore money
---
You might have missed the giant gross cash-shop on the main menu.
---
you know what?  i really do NOT have to explain to you, or any one else, my playing style.  in addition, i gave only 1 reason why i asked for the "transfer all to player".  there are plenty more.  so go hump some other leg, dogface, before i have to push yours in.   mmmmmkay?
---
I agree with this.
---
Thank you!
---
one of the first dupe glitches relied on Bethesda being completely inept. the artillery one.
---
it had nothing to do with rollbacks, just good ol' bugging.
---
only other thing i heard is they are gonna fix server disconnects thats it unless they just throw in hidden patches 
---
You are worried about them coming to get your guns? Sounds like you should join the Free States.
---
Go find it in the bed and breakfast basement. Get the  mod from the vendor. And repair it to 200%. Shouldn't cost u more than 100 caps
---
Will do, thanks. :D 
---
They announced to bring servers down at 9 am est to remove duped items and improve servers 
---
On board for the first part. But I very much like having "bulk" tied to the front of the item name, because there's no reason to bulk anything (outside of Aluminum and Lead) unless you're selling it. It makes it pretty easy to grab out of your stash to drag to a vendor.
---
Then you would be mistaken.  I made no mention of my current weapons.  I ever traded nor took anything from anyone.  Ever.
---
Best I got are 1 star two shot The dragon and a 1 star vampire Axe.
---
So I seriously doubt I may see it gone today.  I am very happy with the nuking of the dupes!
---
Truthfully,  i dumped a lot of 3 star items at vendors prior to learning about this place.  If i can use it and my stash is full, oh well.
---
I agree, either way this game is going down soon and this sub is cancerous with people downvoting and insulting anything that goes against the majority opinion. I’m glad to see this game die and all these people can enjoy playing it alone. 
---
Only : 
---
" During this time, we’re planning to remove items that have been created through duplication exploits from player inventories and stashes."
---
and
---
" Additionally, during downtime, we’re going to roll out a server-side fix to reduce the frequency that players might experience disconnects from game servers."

---
lmfao
---
The mixing machine in Feed The People now burps after it eats your gear.
---
Also, with the new absolute maximum weight limit, they wont be able to exceed it again. 
---
If they can still find ways to dupe, they wont be able to stockpile 100k items like before.
---
Report back please. I think you might be surprised
---
Thank you! Was looking for this post
---
Thank you bro!
---
you keep saying that until Bethesda decides to pull the plug because 3,550 Vault 76 dwellers exploring Appalachia is not enough to keep the servers up.
---
I used to have the stance of 25k cap limit was plenty.  Now that they have jacked the prices, I agree the cap limit needs to be increased.
---
That or Bethesda doesn't have that great of a track record with bug fixing in this game.
---
You forgot serum plans and  power armor plans. 
---
Why for playing the game? For not cheating? For behaving as the devs wanted people to behave?
---
Obviously you are the target of today's patch!  
---
Patch is dropping now so just wait for all the "I'm quitting everything is awful I'm a victim" posts to see what they actually did lol. Personally I'm rooting for a full on thanos of all duped guns but I dont feel its likely
---
but it won't.
---
If I lose my weapons I spent a collective 20k on I will be pissed.  I dont care if they were duped my owning them doesnt hurt anyone else.  I dont PvP and I dont play like an asshole when in crowded areas.  My weapons are only every going to be to the benefit of those around me or myself and never a detriment.  I seemingly doubt this will fix anything and will just cause more strife than it is worth.  If they really want to fix the game how about fixing the bullshit drop rates.  Maybe allow us to craft legendary gear.  It shouldnt take 1000 hours to get the one weapon I really want.  The people crying about how duping hurts the servers are just parroting shit they heard others say with no real source.  There was never an in game economy and caps in the late game are useless so there is no potential in game economy based around them it will all come down to trade and you cant trade what isnt dropping.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if legit people got things deleted. Would you really put it past Bethesda at this point?  The last 2 patches were full of problems.
---
I bought TSE from the Watoga vendor... maybe I'm a pessimist but it's probably duped. ;)
---
A friend of mine soloed her a few days ago.  I shot her a couple times to tag her, but he destroyed her with his Bloodied, Swing speed Mr. Buzzy Blade. 
---
If you haven't been to Watoga yet, you need to know that the place is swarming with robots and they *will* be hostile toward you.  You can turn them friendly but going to the Watoga Municipal Center and completing the Mayor for a Day questline, but until then every Assaultron, Protectron, and Eyebot in the city will try to kill you. There's often some legendaries mixed in with the robots, which is nice because once they're friendly you can easily kill those, collect the legendary armor/weapons they drop and then run off to either Super Duper Mart or the Watoga Station and sell the Berserker's Pool Cue or Troubleshooter's Wooden Leg you just picked up. 
---
I really enjoy all duplicated item will be part of the past. I want real survivors in this doomed world.
---
I'm more of a commie sympathizer 
---
Do the vendors possibly carry duped stuff sold to them? I know i have bought some legendary items off vendors. is there a chance they will disappear as well?
---
Pvp can be exilerating: far more challenging and varied then any content that could be added to the game. I don't do much, but stalking a player with even just 10c bounty and snipers guarding them is one of the most intense experiences I have had in the game.
---
Sooooo wouldnt the dupers still have the originals....or at least potentially?
---
I have acquired over 50 bucks in atoms just from playing. and I wasn't even trying.
---
you must have some serious case of ocd if you need to have literally every single item in the store. most people probably don't spend much.
---
People keep saying that but where is the proof?
---
I will say, if I lose my TSE Gatling gun that I got legitimately (from a drop, no purchased), I'll be kind of upset.
---
I would rather no one play than enable cheating little brats.  60 bucks well worth the salt explosion over children having a fit because their ill gotten goods were taken away.
---
St Valentine's Day Massacre :)
---
So the player who duped millions and the player who played honestly but traded with someone else are equally at fault in your eyes. 
---
That was my guess too.
---
In fact from what I read some of the problems we've had is because it tracks TOO MUCH stuff. As in, a stack of 200 steel isn't just one entry with a quantity of 200 on it, but 200 individual 1 steel entries.
---
I'd bet there are a handful of cases where someone is going to lose a 'legit' TSE or something because they found it, duped it a bunch, and accidentally traded away the original.
---
That is why the bona fide purchaser, IF they know the item is stolen, they are NOT protected under the law. 
---
That is ethically appropriate. 
---
But you can't tell me that every purchaser of a duped item knew it was duped, that is ridiculous. 
---
Ethically, thise who paid market value, and did not know the item was duped, should be protected. 
---
and clearly you represent the playerbase in its entirety.
---
yeah, i know.  
---
setting the refresh rate to 120 has helped immensely.  i am still getting some chop, in and out of game now, but the game is running a HELL of a lot smoother.  i have yet to drop below 35 fps.  it is still not completely stable, it fluctuates between 35 - 60.  going to chalk that up to lag and server problems.
---
beats me what is going on.  with all the problems with the game it's self, i would not doubt the root of the problem is there.
---
I keep hearing about this, but when I look at the achievement list on my xbox, it's not included.
---
"Don't get any ideas, chump!" 
---
Sucks to be them. That's the price to pay unfortunately.  They will find a new weapon, it's just a video game.  
---
I think Butthesda feels that its all of the duped items that is a majority of the game instability. now they have instead of "Game created items" they have Thousands and Thousands of "Player created items" that have features to them like weapon mods and condition counters armor mods also with condition counter.  its not like making thousands of 5.56 amo or.  Corn Soup.  those type of items are simple.   the server can accommodate for thousands of those type of items. BUT when it comes to a "3 star 2 shot explosive Handmade" The most common Duped item in the game.   the server now has to keep track of THOUSANDS upon Thousands of those that have at least 5 different Mod slots AND the condition of the weapon itself.  That just made the code for that one weapon from 1bit to 5bits of data.   now when the server randomly generates that item it has already accommodated the load it will pose on the server as a whole.  
---
BUT!!! When players duplicate that said item 100 thousand times, ITs going to slow the server down and crash it in most cases   
---
Besides..  even if you personalty craft Items at a bench.. Those items are considered "Game Created"  because you used a crafting bench to tell the game im making this shit..     
---
DUPING.  is TRICKING the server into making copies of what you already have..  The server cant always keep up with things it does not know it made.. 
---
No, because not every player is a duper. So tired of seeing this stupid shit.
---
Well, something with inventory will be dicked up, that's almost a given.
---
Probably can't favorite weapons.
---
Explain?
---
Stolen is not the same as duped. 
---
TLDR you didn't read my post at all, clearly. 
---
I'm very curious about this. I have a completely clean virgin solo character with 100% no dupes. I have another character that I've interacted with other players and stuff and traded and given away and I honestly have no idea. I also have a third character that is a mule with like 5k weight that 100% has tons of duped stuff on it. No I wasn't a hard core duper but I admit when it was going like crazy and everyone was running around with better stuff I did give in. I haven't played anything but the virgin in months and honestly quit the game a few weeks ago. I don't think this alone will bring me back but I might just log in with all three guys just to see what the impact is and how far back they are going historically in removing the dupes. 
---
&gt;I'd rather burn the entire thing to the ground than people having fun the wrong way
---
this is you. this is how salty you sound. not to sound insane.
---
I'd bet theres going to be cases of people losing actual legit tse because beth is just going to assume it's duped and not bother the check it against anything. I could be wrong, and hope I am, but they havent said anything about their method of determining if it's a duped item and that makes me concerned
---
At that point why even play anymore?
---
The one thing I like about this is that it means BGS is still involved.  There have been a lot of people speculating that no one is left working on the game. 
---
&gt; . I highly doubt they'll fuck this up that bad. 
---
Maybe just a little bit ?  :-)
---
Got it. You want to laugh as the game is killed off by a massive, poorly implemented inventory reset by the developers.  
---
I mean, it's not like doing shit like this has historically pissed off players and been detrimental to the health of the game right? 
---
So the only people really being hurt, are legitimate players who've unknowingly taken part in an economy full of duped items?
---
Since exploiters can just go ahead and keep duping?
---
Bethesda just fucking over their players again and again.
---
I'm insane for people wanting  to stop cheating, or removing items that were exploited in to existence, boy i'm such a dickhead.
---
You are way off on thinking people don't care about duping. Many People gave up because the economy was instantly crippled by the duping. Now that it will be potentially fixed many may come back. 
---
 To say it's not an issue anymore because many people left is super off base and untrue.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Locked the million pound club.
---
Purge the million pound club.
---
No more million pound club in the future.
---
Duping will still exist, but hopefully what they say about these massive player inventories affecting server stability is true and the +1500 lb from carry weight hard limit stops them from returning and allows Beth to fix the servers, and slowly increase the individual stash limits.
---
Then why did you comment something I already said, as if I was unawares? 
---
Chumps?!
---
I'll have you know us chumps will bite when we're starving for something to make this game more bearable between bullet sponge enemies and plastic guns that break after every other encounter.
---
Not our fault Bethesda fucked up on multiple facets between poor game design and overall poor coding.  Don't understand why innocent players (read: anyone who didn't exploit and legitimately bought with caps a few 3 star legendary items that will turn out to be duped) need to be punished for something that isn't their responsibility or their fault.
---
Is good the two shot cryolator? I've just found it farming west tek but seems meh.
---
You may never
---
100% this. It's too bad no streamers still play this game because there are going to be situations where there would be video evidence of an item legit dropping and then they remove it with this patch.
---
They should have focused on what actually matters now they are a month too late on this.  
---
Good pointer, thank you for this.
---
no but \*supposedly\* they can now detect dupers. so the current stock is all that's left.
---
Oh you win sir.  I laughed many times. 
---
It's launching a Juke, not a Nuke. Everyone now needs stacks of radio jammers to avoid ear shattering musak.
---
"traded", they knew what they were getting...
---
ignorance is no excuse.
---
If the police catch you handling stolen goods you bought at a garage sale.
---
You're still going to get them taken away and any cause you bought them for wont be returned.
---
You know how many people probably have a duped item and don’t realize it?
---
I don't know what point you think you're making, but micro-transactions are a billion dollar a year industry. Exploiting 'whales' who are willing to dump hundreds or thousands on digital items.  
---
So yeah, Bethesda want to milk that cash shop.
---
Stupid shit post.  
---
Sounds good.  Fingers crossed all three are true.
---
54/M
---
Retired US Air Force.   Been gaming since Pong. 
---
you most definitely are. not for that, but for saying you wouldn't mind the server being shutdown forever if that's what it took.
---
that's really fucking crazy.
---
I have a theory too...
---
You're wrong!
---
There's gonna be some people that found weapons legitimately, duped them, and accidentally traded away the original, so they'll lose their 'legit' weapons. Take any clips you see of people looting things as 'proof' with a handful of salt.
---
As a software engineer I can tell you it's much easier to delete things than creating them. . 
---
They would need to know, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the items were not illicit to be protected by the law.
---
No it probably wont, itll just eliminate your entire stash and whats on your person and youll just be left naked and afraid lol
---
Knowing how Creation Engine works, we already know that the items do not have an identifier that would remain unchanged when they are duped. There is a RefId that is unique to each item instance. So how are BSG going to rid us of items obtained in a dishonest way? They mentioned a list of items to delete. Now imagine that each weapon has a certain set of characteristics. Its unique effects, condition, level: all this can be combined into a hash.
---
After that, we do (for example) this query:
---
SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM PlayersInventories, PlayersStashes GROUP BY WeaponHash ORDER BY DESCENDING LIMIT 100  
---
Now you have a list of thousands of hashes of items that are most often found in the player's inventories and stashes. And that's the thing: if there are 10 identical weapons in the game, this is random. If there are 1,000,000 of them, then these are almost certainly copies of one weapon.
---
The second query will be:
---
DELETE FROM PlayersInventories, PlayersStashes  WHERE WeaponHash IN ListOfDupedWeaponsHashes
---
Thus, they will destroy all items that have too many copies in game. Of course, there may be additional conditions here, in order not to accidentally remove an ordinary pistols (for example), but this will definitely affect everyone. Even an insignificant small percentage of people who were unlucky to farm themselves a thing that perfectly matched the one that was copied.
---
The price you pay for playing fallout 76 in the exact way the developers promised you could. Gaining a skill selling your services and then buying a nice gun with the profits. They used that example in their no clip video. It did not end with the player having their work deleted. 
---
Dupaggedon
---
to get better rolls and just generally being unpleasant to other players because I'm still salty this mess is always online.
---
and that they nerfed my stuff but melee is unscathed.
---
The issue isn’t deleting dupes.    The issue is deleting dupes and nerfing perks before they have fixed the documented litany of longstanding bugs.   Their priorities are wrong, if they want to make money.  Fun is what makes us overlook the flaws.   Remove the fun and the flaws standout.    If Bethesda Austin does not fix a lot of other bugs today, the game will be doomed.  
---
This is great! Think of all the free stash space everyone will have.  And the absolute best part: there legitimately cannot be a single person with a full set of sentinel assassin armor.  Gonna miss my shottys though, wish i didnt sell my suppressors, vampire, and mutant pumps to clear stash space.

P.s. the term false flag, has a very specific meaning “a covert operation designed to deceive; the deception creates the appearance of a particular party, group, or nation being responsible for some activity, disguising the actual source of responsibility.”
---
You probably should say “incorrectly flagged”
---
r/beetlejuicing?
---
Such a legit question, there's a serious problem with morality in *our* world.  Have an upvote for trying to point out people's blind dysfunctional moral compasses.
---
It is going to be a full wipe.
---
\&gt;Why for playing the game? For not cheating? For behaving as the devs wanted people to behave?
---
Nah just for you wishing the same on people who happened to use the trade system in the game.
---
\&gt;Obviously you are the target of today's patch!
---
Nope, I haven't played the game in a month and my char is level 40 and broke AF. They could literally delete my account and I wouldn't be losing that much progress.
---
Thank you for the link I have no idea why they didn't just post patch notes like they always do
---
It would be kinda funny to suddenly have a bunch of high level people naked and punching scorched just to get a pipe pistol to get by. 
---
Any legit tse's are gonna be 25k. 
---
Its not like duped items are neatly tagged as such or anything, get ready for some wild guessing from the brilliant minds at Bethesda.
---
Log files are only as useful as what the developers believed would be interesting to record, so it depends on what data they were logging from the beginning. Based on earlier comments which made it appear they couldn't distinguish duped items from others, versus their current statements that they _are_ so able, it's possible they weren't writing out traceable transaction logs in sufficient detail yet found another way to interpret records of game state changes to identify duping activity and then trace those items.  
---
It's also possible they had the data all along but weren't certain how they wanted to address the issue, waiting until now to determine their preferred policy, but the fact that it took them three months since duping was first reported makes me believe it took them a while to learn how to disentangle cryptic references to obtain a trace between an item currently in a player's inventory and the initial event that created it and confirm that as a duping event.
---
Lolz
---
unless you farmed all your items yourself and NEVER traded with a random player, is the only way of 100% safety, if they are removing duped items by id code duplications.
---
You're so wrong about everything man... If you start with the mentality of "owning duped items isn't hurting anybody" then you're wrong across the board. It's severly hurting in game traders like myself to try to turn a profit on anything that's not some super awesome duped legendary. Crafting legendary gearis way out of bounds... What you want is basically god mode super easy mode Fallout. It doesn't take 1000's of hours to get one weapon you really want. It takes a few days of communication witht he trading community and a few thousand caps. But I guess that's too hard for you right? I guess you'd rather just be able to spawn it in for free. 
---
Weeellll.... the problem is that your bunker buster is only level 40.  It has a +20% damage and that targeting computer, so if you can build a better one, then do so and then get rid of it, but you might have better results farming for a legendary to mod.
---
I had the same problem with All Rise.  Mine was level 40, so I helped a friend through the quest when he was level 50 and he gave me his level 50 All Rise.  Maybe you can befriend a level 50 that's about to do that mission.
---
Hahah right
---
So anyone that traded with another player over the first 3 months of release is at fault. In other words a major feature of the game was broken for 3 months after release.  
---
Of course it is. 
---
They could enforce the in game pricing of items
---
Most of the people i see make that mistake are native speakers that went to elementary school......
---
You're right - those are possibly on the list too.
---
I managed to lose 300 lbs all by my lonesome. Here's the exact 10 step to follow:
---
1 - Travel to a buddies based and place all the stuff you want to mule into a bag that you mistakenly think he dropped.
---
2 - Log in your mule and find the bag missing.
---
3 - Cry
---
4 - Blame Bethesda
---
5 - Stand around for an hour thinking it will magically reappear.
---
6 - Log in and off several different characters.
---
7 - Cry more
---
8 - Blame Bethesda again while staring blankly at your XBox controller for 20-22 minutes.
---
10 - Realize you're the idiot and this is no ones fault but your own despite the crappy in-game inventory management.
---
you're comparing big titted gachas to pot flowers. there's been what, a dozen worthwhile atom items? in 3 months?
---
you can farm that in game. there's no incentive to whale in Fo76.
---
Yeah...that's not how inventory items are handled with this software engine. If it was there'd be a way out of this, but that's not how it works.   
---
No, Bethesda's about to just take a weed wacker to their player base.   
---
If I had to guess, if you have multiple items of a type, it's going to delete your inventory.
---
"Funtionally identical, but the audio is played backwards." lmao
---
life's a bitch.
---
im in the same boat but frankly, it needs down during their working hours and i am glad they do it First Thing in the day there so they can fix it there and then rather than 5pm clocking off time.
---
I just think it wont remove 95% of duped gear 
---
I'm genuinely confused what is meant by the term economy, forgive me if this is a stupid question.  Do you mean vendor sell prices or the prices players assign to items?  What and where is this economy?
---
And if it happens, it'll force us all to "Begin Again"
---
I think that you make a valid point, but the problem is that these items were never intended to be in the game in this abundance, thus throwing off the designed balance: a better analogy would be counterfeiting.
---
I don't really see the bullet sponge comment when everything I fight dies relativity face from using " suppressor" one star Gatling gun lol. if it takes more than 2 seconds to kill, does that make t a bullet sponge?
---
I stash every fracking screw because I don't want to lose it. How neurotic do you think I will be if I lose my prized weapon or armor pieces?
---
You’re inventing a lot of things here that you have no evidence for and have no basis in reality. 
---
- amount of people playing the game. You have no idea
---
- the method that will be used to clean up super items. You have no idea 
---
- you don’t “feel” like they have a way to see into players inventories. You have no idea. 
---
- items don’t have unique IDs. This is a silly concept frankly. That’s not how databases work
---
Stop with the hyperbolic nonsense please. 
---
Jesus Fucking Christ, get a life already. If you stopped playing this game weeks ago and yet you're still this fucking obsessed about it you need to get some help. 
---
So PvP is not competition?
---
My maturity level is so low I giggled at “shitposting” and “dog pile” in close proximity
---
I looked at this post last night and it was paused at 420 upvotes... I didnt have the heart to add another and ruin the number.... now its 427. Laameee
---
Same thing as how do you know people are destroying your camp?
---
Hmmm this might have taken the place of the second most stupid post about duping. Since the announcement.
---
If you add shiny new ornaments to a car that's burning oil, and doesn't start reliably, that doesn't make it a shiny new car.
---
They *cannot* implement player vending in the current state of the game. They **have** to fix the worst of the broken, before they can start adding new features.
---
Vaults now open when activated. Unfortunately, theyre all cryo vaults containing nothing but dead wives and angry dads, all of whom are locked in boxes.
---
Unknowingly is not a word I would choose. Unless you're not following the market in any way - you have to be hella blind to not realize what is a dupe and what isn't. I trade a lot, and was anticipating something of a sort, so step by step I've built up a collection of top tier weapons that should be safe today.
---
When they allow players to setup shop. It’s coming 
---
I think it will be a good day, I know the game still needs work, but the only real problem I’ve had with this game compared to other fallout games is the people. 
---
Not all of them.
---
But I’ve encountered so many people who’ve made it their sole purpose to grief and cause shit for other people. 
---
Like the way pvp is set up is dumb I think, but anyway. 
---
Getting rid of the overpowered stuff people have who have essentially paid to play will be a good thing. 
---
Ill be loosing my stuff too, so mind if i pull up a chair and watch with ya?
---
If they do a purge and remove say a duped item I bought, but at the same time will not make the effort to reimburse someone’s weapon that probably took 100s of hours of grind time.  Fuck them.
---
This shit is why you never buy anything off another player in an online game.
---
Scarcity makes even less desirable items more valuable.  People need to learn to make do with lesser stuff.  The ones who got spoiled using duped items will likely find this transition painful, meanwhile the bulk of us who never got those items are still playing the same game we did before.
---
Yes tell me more about how you know what the dev team at bethesda is doing.
---
Doesn't work for my chameleon trapper chest either, booo. 
---
Ok going to Devil's advocate here, and check my comment history as I've been an anti-duper.  
---
Some of the more clever dupers have been seeding vendors with high end equipment and leaving bags of goodies (Marine helmets as an example) around the wasteland to muddy the waters and try and keep Bethesda from doing exactly what they did today (assuming they do nuke all duper items).  
---
Some innocent people will be caught in the dragnet most likely, and it will hurt, so not everyone posting after the game is live will be a shady duper complaining unjustly 
---
&gt;small percentage of accounts currently have duped items
---
Looking at some of the top traders on the reddit trading subs that have thousands of transactions selling duped items. Either they aren't going to delete duped items that you bought from someone else, or they are going to affect half their current playerbase.
---
I always get a I've heard other people say this but when I try to do it, the system tells me that the person has to be a friend for me to join their game (xbox)
---
"To avoid breaking from the lore, we continued with the theme of 'Rebuilding' and wiped the inventories of all players." 
---
Weapon and armor weights will be doubled (oops!) and anyone whose stash is now over the 600lb limit will get wiped.
---
My best guess is that they snuck item identifiers into a previous patch that tie an individual sequence to an item, leading to all duped items sharing that same identifier. That’s the hope at least.
---
Not under common law in many jurisdictions. 
---
Beyond reasonable doubt is a criminal law jurisdiction level. 
---
The level actually is in the balance of probabilities.  
---
Paying market value during business hours equates to prima facie, the purchaser being considered a bona fide purchaser.  
---
Yes - though they mention people with duped items from trading could be affected, so I believe they'll look for certain patterns and wipe those from everyone's inventories.
---
As a person who has played most days from beta and genuinely doesn't have any current game bug issues let me ask you, "What are the longstanding bugs?" 
---
(Only thing I can think of at this point is weapon balancing requests and maybe that Assaultron Heads still blast through all ammo?)
---
How does him making an alt make it an exploit? Are you one of those dudes that thinks gamesharing on Xbox is stealing?
---
Ah, I hadn’t thought about rads...noice! And thanks for the culinary tip, I had been avoiding glowing meat... no longer!!!
---
Dammit... Coffee stains all over...
---
Same boat :( graveyard shift eastern time 
---
I don't think you understood my point. I'm not advocating for level elevens to make Scorched Earth harder because they want easy XP or loot.  I'm simply a level 87 who has not done many of the actual storyquests. Doesn't make me not useful in a fight,
---
Hi! As others have mentioned here, this is a visual issue and you're not actually losing ammo. That said, we're currently planning to release a fix for this in our patch next week.
---
He meant falsely flag 
---
Ill take a nuka cola and some good o'l popcorn is 30 caps enough?
---
I do indeed.  Well my theory is debunked haha
---
  Thanks for the info though!
---
I apologize.  I was not clear.  I didn't mean you specifically in my statement.  I meant it generically.  Anybody who acquired a dupe may still lose it.
---
They didn't say they were removing all duped items.  Just that they were targeting a select group of duped items and it would not effect most players.  Guessing isn't required, we can just a wait a few hours and see. 
---
They cause massive issues anything they have done. Legit loot is going to be removed as well.
---
He means that the people complaining have duped items. 
---
Looks like this sub doesn’t like ethics.
---
I pictured Carl from Aqua Teen doing this
---
I'm seeing it from both sides, the people happy and people not. I am a bit tired of the mindset that if you have a TSE you are automatically a duper. Then again they are just loud and a minority.
---
Regarding point 3: if you look at some of the most active traders on the trading subreddits, youll see that they have sold thousands of duped weapons. This patch is either going to ignore those cases or alienate a huge portion of the remaining players.
---
precursor "if" tell me more how your reading comprehension.
---
Thanks but I will have to check what I have to trade. I will be able to later day 
---
Are you sure they're being serious? I read most of posts as humorous ranting for entertainment.
---
Same situation here
---
subjective is a matter of taste, objective is verifiable, the game is verifiably bad

Xbox :D I’ll take it, thanks! is there anything I can throw your way in trade? (I’m at lvl 47 if that’s any indication of what grade of stuff I am keeping)
---
How can you possibly know their backend design? 
---
The irony of FO76 is that Bethesda—in an attempt to mitigate people complaining about the game—basically nerfed every survival aspect of the game, resulting in a survival game that was no fun. 
---
Oh I understand why completely. But I had a fresh cup of joe ready and my favorite gaming hoodie on. Ready for 2-3 hours of fallout bliss and I get smacked in the face at login screen. Guess it’s nothing but chores instead for the morning. 
---
They prioritized other things, I’d assume.
---
They will remove every TSE. Won't matter how you got it.
---
Todays patch.
---
I spent a few thousand caps using the community.  Now you are saying that wasnt good enough i need to do a credit check first.  I got all my gear through drops I got all of my weapons but 3 through playing.   But I have 0 interest in a weapon that isnt what I want and only way to obtain that is by spending hundreds of hours to hunt down the perfect weapon or a weapon someone else thinks is perfect and hope they got my perfect weapon.  Expecting caps to be the trading metric is just crazy, I have spent over 20k and still have over 15k just through playing regularly.  With 0 loot tables and 0 crafting ability there is 0 guarantee you will ever get a weapon that will fit your criteria and that is shitty.  
---
It’s because a game is messing with inventory with no information if your inventory will be touched before they do it. 
---
I really doubt that though. It'd screw with how the engine handles inventory management.   
---
The main hint would be if weapons didn't stack anymore. So if you have 3 identical 10mm pistols, they stack in the inventory right? It looks something like "10mm pistol (3)" or similar? If I remember right, that's because it's just a single line of code in the database table with a 3 in the quantity field. So each gun is not unique. Making them unique would explode the table size by making each individual item take up a single row.   
---
And if they couldn't expand CAMP size by much without crashing the servers, I can't see how they could pull this off without doing the same.
---
This.  This is the sub.  Well, let's be fair, this is the Internet.
---
Complaints, literally for weeks, about duping.  And when the company acts on it complaints about how it's done, who's going to get banned, items removed, etc.  
---
Hey, everyone.  You agreed to the terms of service.  Suck it up.
---
That is a really point. 
---
However with counterfeit goods, it is possible to determine which item is legit and which is faked. 
---
Maybe a better analogy is copyright infringement. 
---
As the goods duped are literally the same, with no inferiority to the original item. 
---
Okay, but does *this* finally clear the path for player vendors? ‘Cause, other than pissing off people (however a small minority dupers might be, any of us who have traded with them will probably be a high number, due to diffusion), what is the point? 
---
Why fix an economy that is, in game, damned hard to participate in anyway?
---
mind blown!
---
I'm actually happy to know Bethesda still DO care about Fallout 76, through deleting duped items. I love this game and still have hopes that it will be great in a year or two.
---
Making an alt isn't an exploit. Using them as mules is. Because it's not intended. If it were intended we would have a shared stash. Mules are an exploit that gives you an unfair advantage over people who don't or can't have them. It's very simple logic. I would have done it myself. I tried and lost about 10 100% legit anti-armor weapons because for some reason the container I used reset when I logged my lower level in. Doesn't change the fact it's not intended and is thus an exploit, circumventing the weight limitations imposed by game systems.
---
I can craft you a new Ultracite Gatling Laser if you have the mats. Itll have to be after 6 PM CST though.
---
They better not accidentally delete my Rolling Pin. It is the only 3* weapon I’ve ever found. It is unquestionably the finest Rolling Pin in the Land. This may not overly impress you wanderers with your fancy schmancy Murder Guns of Infinite Carnage + Other Nifty Attributes. But it really is quite fine. 
---
If such a tragedy occurs, will I throw things and quit in a huff? Not bloody likely!  But I will be so sad....
---
May I ask what your experiance with the creation egine comes from and how it applies to FO76's version of it?  Because outside of the devs the version of this engine is a little different than anyone else has worked with besides Beth. Just curious is all.
---
Need violet and colbalt.
---
lol. Like the game is soo hard if they don't have that precious TSE. What's with the fragility. I'll drop every single non quest legendary I have on quest day in solidarity and guess what, i'll still be able to play the game.
---
Your time and effort that you already wasted by deciding to play a game. All time you spend playing fallout is playing a game and therefore a voluntarily wasted amount of time and effort.
---
For the sake of not wasting your time. Drop this stupid argument. Bethesda could give two shits on ethics. 
---
They sold you power armor editions and switched materials without a peep until found out. Fuck your ethics basically. 
---
Also it’s pretty hard not to know about a duped item especially hoping on here or the bazaar or the marketplace. If you see 20 to 30 of the same TSE gun for sale some alarms should be ringing. Not to mention when you trade it and see 53000 in there inventory. 
---
The vendor part is iffy. No one is gonna sell the 1 god roll they got to a vendor. I’ve seen a vendor that had 35 3* combat shotguns. Not hard to see that’s duped.
---
Finishing building your characters by doing side quests story lines?
---
I mean, it’s like saying you have nothing to do after killing Alduin in Skyrim.
---
With .38 or 308?
---
Marvel Heroes used to dump current database onto the test servers to test stuff. They even said when it was and that accounts created later would not work on test.
---
Items in Creation Engine do not have any id code, shared across all duped items. There are only BaseId as reference to «template» of this item and unique RefId as a handler for exact instance.
---
The trading bug I believe was a myth - but the trading interface allows someone to see everything you have in inventory (which in itself could be a bad thing, like they could see your junk and target you later).  Also I find that initiating trade always leads to the screen where I'm offering some item for sale...  its bad controls layout, plus often when I've traded the problem with the wrong item being selected/offered because your mouse moves a bit is real too.
---
Trading interface is one big pile of dung in short!

Was searching for some info online and stumbled upon this (old) thread. I'm trying to get the windmill generator, it's the only generator I somehow want to integrate into my camp. Did anyone receive windmill plans from Poseidon? I did it twice now and I only got the large generator. I'm starting to think that I'll need to power up some more 'difficult' plants in order to get windmill plans. Unless ofcourse someone has gotten windmill plans from Poseidon.
---
Maybe they just are not trying to appreciate the macro level of what my point is? 
---
I love discussing ethics, and in most cases there is no true right or wrong answer, but apparently all of mine here are wrong. 
---
😅
---
I bet anything they keep their list small, and the purge will be focused on PVP-type gear.
---
it  would have a performance cost and the game already runs like shit
---
I'll take that bet. 10,000 caps none of your legit stuff is removed.
---
Gaaaary...
---
Go explore. Check your challenges and see what you've missed. Look for all the cryptozooids. Help lower level players.
---
and they'll keep purging the duped items. One step towards making people play the game like it was intended, I know its scary, tammy/timmy the power gamer.
---
Yeah.  Killing the opossums makes me sad until I craft that bacon. 
---
“Patch test dummy”. I love it!

Now the only true viable build is melee in power armor for sure. Explosives are garbage, non Power armor perk nerfed, energy is in the drain, guns as a whole break way to fast. 
---
Only way to play now is melee.
---
They say that.  But I still doubt they had some sort of logged system to track each trade to be able to go back and analyze.
---
Take the simplest route that will address the issue of the "million pound" users affecting server stability.  Mention it in a way that makes people believe they can track users' trading and item use, to make them wary of future trading with potentially duped items.  Win-Win.
---
That's my fear.  I worry that we will lose some loyalists who went to extremes to get their hands on this stuff and now will just give up caring.  I know people think that it's wrong for them to have done so, but we're talking about a franchise that, in its last game, let you craft legendary effects.  The RNG might make some of the more traditional fallout players trying to cope in this game a little desperate.  They may just bail now.
---
It happens switching with my 2 gatlings - real PITB of a bug, sometimes I end up using my primed gatling and wasting ultracite ammo in the process.
---
I remember this post, the guy was trying to be funny, pointing out that the Austin team made a list of everything people liked about Fallout- and then did the opposite. like leather armor requiring ballistic fiber to repair but not to craft, so their solution was to make everything require ballistic fiber.
---
at the time I chuckled. now I wonder if they're doing this on purpose, to have an excuse to shut the servers.
---
Well,  except for last night.
---
Odds are duper’s we’re dumping their ill gotten loot into vendors too.
---
There is no other answer. And there are no actual innocents here. People who traded with strangers for amazing items at low prices aren't the wide eyed innocents everyone pretends to be worried about. Cut the BS.
---
People traded for awesome duped items. They can earn the caps back in a day or two. Be happy you had the awesome item you shouldn't have for the time you got to have it.
---
So I have a question what about items purchased from robot vendors that might have been sold  to them by duper’s ??? An example would be in watoga from Phoenix after a scorched earth event tons of people dump weapons and gear and the inventory reflects it , (higher legendary loot availability ) I purchased a TSE prime lever action and an anti armor gragnoks axe on two separate occasions , I also traded some legendary BOS combat armor I got at white springs during several nukings (I’m in Power armor 24/7 and don’t use it) for a quad 2 barrel prime shotty does that mean I’m getting ass boned today?????seriously how is that fair in any way ???
---
Yeah I nay just give up. 
---
I was hoping to discuss the ethics of the situation as I love discussing ethics, generally. 
---
But people just seem more focused on being snarky and downvoting. 
---
Oh well. 
---
That's weird because I could have sworn that the company that has access to all the back-end data already said that the percentage of users with duped items is a small percentage and not a "huge portion of the remaining players".
---
I'm gonna go with them over your random speculation here.
---
The servers won't be empty, there will just be less of them.  
---
&gt;now it is going to get fixed.
---
Sure it is.
---
For free, so no real loss then?
---
Earned items are much more satisfying! 
---
\---snip---
---
 There’s no way they’re gonna be able to remove every single one.  
---
\---/snip---
---
Wanna bet?
---
If each item has a unique serial number, which I suspect is the case, yes easy enough to see all the hundreds of cloned items
---
Lol thanks dude. I typed that first and it sounded wrong :). Grammar isn't my strength.
---
I don’t understand the downvotes cause u were just posing a question so I gave u an upvote to neutralize it. I think they may delete the mule accounts with thousands and people’s duped tse weapons that they got from trading are definitely vulnerable. I guess we’ll see soon
---
Logs aren't part of DB servers. Don't have to be, either. At any point through the chain, a log can be generated.  
---
Does *not* have to be the DB server.
---
I offer all the time to help people this way. Just be leary, I had someone help me this way, the offered to help me build my excavator power armor, told me they would make me a few nice rifles. I was over encumbered and I couldnt fast travel to their camp so they helped me trash my extra stuff. It was stuff that I really didnt want to get rid of but probably need too...Long story short I finally got light and made it to their camp. They help me with my mutations and then we were just standing around. He finally said "uh what ya doing?" and I said "Waiting for you to build my power armor and weapons..." and he said "oh I cant do that now..I was so pissed. I had sold off most of my other weapons because I thought I was getting these new ones and would be able to pair down. I also had passed along many of my crafting resources to him along with stims, etc and now had none of it...Lesson learned....
---
&gt;Step one: Fix the goddamn duping methods.
---
your plan was doomed to fail from the start
---
what will we do with out our cheaters :*(
---
"The servers will be a lot more stable"  Same thing has been said the last 4 times duping was "fixed".
---
You do realize that they have as much claim to that spot as you do, right? You can seever hop. The world does not revolve around you.
---
Man, if you're still out there.. i would like you to craft me some of them, atleast enough to learn the recipe.
---
Will you do this for a respectable enclave officer like me?
---
\^ 10 points for working out that Bethesda thought of this too!
---
The object system is a very fundamental part of the game engine. Obviously, we do not have accurate data, but there are several factors that indicate that no one has changed this subsystem:
---
* The game has all the same bugs with items that were in other games.
---
* We have an official statement that the number of items affects the performance of the server (which almost certainly means that they did not normalize the database, but they store the items in the same way as in single games on this engine).
---
* The patches that come out indicate that the team does not know the engine very well, which means it could not rewrite objects subsystem so that it outwardly completely resembled the old one.
---
Bro, this is Bethesda you're talking about. They don't have that cognitive ability!
---
Not getting a downvote from me.
---
How about you wait and see what actually happens. You're acting as if you lost all your weapons, yet nothing has happened yet. I don't agree with the decision, but we don't know the effects yet.
---
As a strictly solo player and wanderer, I've had my fair share of disappointment from being disconnected from my nuke launches and battles and not being able to "find" my way back to the server.  I always thought you had to be friended to do this.  Excellent research and information.  I'll give it a try next time.
---
I suppose half the problem is that people have no way of knowing if an item is duped.  Wether you trade with another player OR if you buy an item which was sold at a trader 30 minutes before by another player... People have played the game as intended by grinding out caps and quests only to be sold something they have noway of checking if it's duped or not taken away. Will they get the caps back which were legitimately earned? hell no.
---
Ever try to send a ticket? They don't say anything to anyone other than initial robot. Then the go silent.
---
If you are on ps4 I might have a replacement wep. Just let me know if they take it from you. Been saving my 3 star pulls for this update
---
When I played EverQuest we had an acronym for the 'ragequit after patch' people:
---
GGALLFM
---
Good, Go Away, Less Lag For Me.
---
&gt;equally at fault
---
And the people who released this mess are totally blameless, of course.
---
Yeah they are duper lol 
---
Also, if, in most likelihood, they are going after legendaries, then what about the folk that have 10s thousands; if not much, *much* more; of crafting mats? Those flagged as well? That, my friends, is where I see the possibility of a fuck up; wrong decimal place &amp; everyone loses their mats. 
---
If they were rare to find might be safe. We know TSE guns as well as bobble heads ans such were mass produced. But only Bethesda has the total lost.
---
That makes a lot more sense - search for a item count of non ammo items that are more than x number and delete those. 
---
toxic is such a joke of a term. people who use it unironically must have their skin made out of cotton candy.
---
not to mention it's definitely justified.
---
That is of course your prerogative.  However, what else would they say?  They haven't exactly been bastions of honesty and transparency.  I hope you're right, but I think the duping population is the smallest one to be hit.  I'd be surprised if the benefactors isn't a bit bigger.
---
I am talking about application logs, not the transaction logs.
---
Then you should realize it's for the good of the party and join the bread line with everyone else.
---
Yeah, right. Farmed 3 sent assassin or cav assassin pieces.  Most have never even seen one in game, let alone a non duped one.  
---
I guess I am just concerned over some of the weapons I bought and am fully not expecting them to be in my possession when I log in after work.
---
More like Gary.
---
Glad I got my 100% achievements,  Fk this game I am done.
---
He's upset because he's going to be missing a bunch of weapons when the purge is completed and is lashing out, like a child who has had his their favorite toy taken away.
---
Aw, am crying, with laughter!  Personally I would be banning every fecker who has a duped item, no exceptions. You tossers have ruined the game.
---
Bad apples spoil the bunch.
---
that also makes alot of sense, but what are the chances that one of our ideas get implemented 
---
Best bud has a TSE shotgun. He stopped using it for a while because, and I quote "What fun is that? Im not really  scared of anything."
---
He pulled it back out a couple days ago, after the nerf. Comment; "Yep, still one hitting things!" Ran around with that toon in Whitesprings one hitting the bloated and glowing lvl 68s. Seems totally useless now :/ .
---
Yes, they are.
---
New event in the making.
---
Operation: Almost Heaven
---
That would be sick kinda like the scorched officers ;0 with the little antenna and the need to add helms for us that have real def value would be nice and like u said so many cosmetic opportunity for their atom store 
---
"GARY!"
---
The company that repeatedly said they have no tools or ability to track or restore player items?
---
If you read my post, and were capable of critical thinking, you would come to 2 conclusions that seem to be obvious to everyone else. Either they aren't going to delete items that were obtained through player trading, or when they claim a "small percentage" they are talking about a small percentage of total accounts created. Active players are probably around 15-20% of total accounts. 5% is a small portion of the total accounts, but it could be a third of the active players.
---
Could you not fast travel with them shooting at you?
---
This guy has a tannery.
---
Damage bug is still there. 
---
it's not about difficulty. it's about having the item.
---
Don't even bother trying to reason with the self-righteous.
---
I can't wait for the butthurt, I'm sure I'll lose most of my gear as well but oh well, at 487 hours I'm done till we get a DLC anyway.  Good time to restart a fresh toon maybe.  I can't wait from some live streams today, those should be epic.   
---
I remember reading multiple times "cant you just delete the duped weapons from the dupers" and now its "Dont delete my weapons, i didnt know!!". Ignorance of the rules is not an excuse for breaking the rules. 
---
You're literally the first person I've ever heard of spending real money in the Atomic Shop. If you don't mind my asking, how much have you spent and what kinds of stuff did you buy?
---
Why is that the case?
---
I think the main issue is that legendarys with a decent/practical combination were the items that were duped.
---
If you have to get it from a random drop your chances are shit because whatever they use to generate the items is shit and almost always spits out something that is both worthless and useless.
---
&gt; and then just increase item level.
---
Absolutely. That's the easiest fix that would upset the least amount of people. 
---
&gt;I'm gonna believe this company that has lied time and again and continues to do so
---
BRILLIANT
---
what could possibly go wrong
---
They were called Goliaths, and I totally I forgot about those guys.  I remember there was some kind of achievement or rare loot for getting a Goliath up to its maximum level before killing it, and it was incredibly frantic to do so.
---
I think having an enemy that roams around the world and gets stronger and stronger would have been a really neat idea.  Right now, other players serve as that X factor, but having an NPC that is unpredictable like that is exactly the kind of thing I'd like to see in a giant open-world.  Of course, I also have a feeling that Bethesda's traditionally woeful pathfinding would be a problem, which might be one reason why they chose to make the Scorchbeasts fly around.
---
o yea hey i found 500 tse in a vendor would u take a trade for said cola ;) 
---
They are just taking their frustration about Bethesda and the game out on you. Don't worry. More will come. There will be a lot more CAMP destruction and griefing if people even continue to play after today.
---
Game : has pvp
---
Player: plays game gets wrecked has bad time
---
Game: yes
---
Player: this community is toxic 
---
They were never worth 10000 caps. People may have bought them for that much. But that’s out of stupidity, not value.
---
Have you ever thought that maybe, the reason they are deleting dupes and nerfing some perks, is because its easier to do both of those things, then to fix bugs and make new content? 
---
All three of those things need to happen, so why delay something they can do now just because people would rather see bugs fixed? And like some other people are stating, a very popular request, player vending, is entirely dependant on the player economy being fixed, which means duped items need to go. 
---
if they where really bored they would have just followed, best way to avoid them is block them then change worlds
---
I really like crafting, so I've bought mostly skins and camp items.  Other than that, I have a few different character icons...  They're cheap and funny.
---
At least someone besides me saw that as all out glowing putresence of the mouth. I was starting to think I was one of like three sane people in the world that just evolve with games. Everything is Perpetual Beta anymore...it's silicone valley's motto after all. Either be flexible and adapt or be left behind. Whatever, if anything, our shopkeeper alts or mains lose, eh so what. The thrill is in the hunt, not in the horde.
---
Yeah, I'm worried about my vampire dragon claw. I think my anti-armor death tambo may be safe as death tambos aren't very popular.
---
What if I told you different people complain about different things?
---
At the same time, they will finally allow you to cook with purified water. But it's not in the game anymore, so......
---
I could have, but was doing the "collect molerat blood sample" portion of the Doc Hudson's mission, and didn't want to leave without the sample.
---
You're an idiot with no reading comprehension skills.
---
I don't think it will be as bad as you think
---
Support is not Dev.. is that really so hard to understand? Front end support does not have tools to do that and most MMORPG games DON'T EITHER. 
---
You sound like the people who were saying "they will never ban dupers because they can't track anything because support says they can't give people an it they lost so they can't track any objects in the game at all"... Silly.
---
Like I’ve said I have a legitimate 2 shot explosive assault rifle and a legitimate 2 shot non explosive assault rifle. As long as they don’t get deleted we are fine. But I don’t leave it to Bethesda to not fuck this up.
---
They traded their time. And if the dupe removal is true, then literally it means that the players who farmed for caps and traded for items will have actually wasted their time. The dupes need to be dealt with, but not in this manner and certainly not at the expense of the majority of players who traded their time for weapons that are of questionable origin.
---
Yeah they nerfed tse which was good but they screwed up by nerfing missiles and grenade launchers when they were already too weak to begin with. They dont know what they are doing
---
No one is complaining. But if a toddler is standing on top of a table and tells you he is about to do a perfect backflip and land it....you are going to be skeptical.
---
BGS has mishandled every situation since beta. There is literally no way that this patch goes smoothly.
---
Indeed, because people getting fucked in the ass after grinding weeks for those caps is certainly such a benefit for the reputation of this game!
---
Wait no, it isn't. Even more people will abandon this broken mess of a game now. 
---
could back that backpack idea up
---
We still have the bug that randomly deletes items from inventory. So, I'm sure you will cut some slack before accusing everyone of "cheating" when they're on here complaining about missing items.
---
I'm the same way. I was the last of my friends to fall, but I just can't do it anymore. Subscribed to this sub just for fun, now.
---
Most of the time, I use my mic for giving lowbies free stuff. "Hey want some free stuff?" or "Hey, did you happen to see a wendigo come by here wearing a clown costume?" or "Hey, did you see that Scorchbeast take a dump on my camp. What a bastard!" Last two may be situational.
---
unless you never traded yourself there's a good chance your stuff is gonna be deleted, too.
---
people here don't know just how big the reach of duped items really is.
---
You couldn't wait to type that out could you. Keyboard warrior over here. I never once suggested  people not even aware of having duped gear are as guilty as the exploiters duping gear .  If you do so KNOWINGLY you are just as guilty. I have nothing but symapthy for anyone with removed items that they legit traded for. I doubt that will happen, but we shall see. 
---
I half expect them to just straight up hard reset inventory server wide and just be like "oh well must have been duped then unlucky you"
---
Oh no! The TSE Handmade I was able to afford at lvl 45 for 1k caps may not be there? It's not fair! It's not fair! I thought that was legit and it took me an hour to make those caps. Have I gotten anything nearly as good in the next 30 levels of playing? Not at all. But that doesn't mean I knowingly bought a duped item right? 
---
You guys believe that right? Oh well, I guess I'll just pick up a one star legendary from my Stash and kill anything I want in the game easily anyway.
---
I gave him a dollar
---
I'm totally grinding that. I bet it has Epic Loot like level 5 wooden legs.
---
Etymologically, it means 'poison arrows'. It's a terrific description
---
exactly, ignorance of the rules is no excuse for breaking them
---
So you're calling people morons for buying duped weapons, yeah, because they come with a tag saying they're duped.🤦‍♂️
---
Every time I log on I leave a bag in front of my camp with some ammo, known plans and recipes, water etc. 3-4 times out of ten, when I come back, people have taken a few items from the bag and added a few of their own.
---
This community, for the most part, is awesome.
---
I've never traded but if I lose something whatever it's for the greater good.
---
Instead of crenelated walls, they give princess beds smdh. 
---
So a positive change for once
---
huh. that's actually pretty fucking cool.
---
This is a great point.  I subbed a couple tickets from items that vanished from my stash (a couple of mods), and they told me the same thing.  They said they don't have the ability to restore anything.  Now maybe they just meant they don't want to spend the effort researching, but it is a huge risk to consider if they make mistakes during the purge.  You also make a good point about the number of accounts compared to active accounts...  not just total.
---
The people complaining the loudest are being disingenuous. They know their items are duped, or are dupers in some form themselves. 
---
It's ridiculous to believe that a weapon (like the TSE shotgun for example) with a .012% likelihood of dropping, would be so common.
---
So glad the state feeds me!
---
Uh...  cast screws would totally suck.  Need to be machined, but I see your point.
---
All of the methods still exist and work currently including the one that requires 3 people and crashes that server with item trading. I know and have befriended enough that do it have walked me through the steps. What in all honesty stops me is I have my gamer information tied into all the Fallout games I bought through Xbox with my gamer tag since the Original Xbox that I prefer not to lose those games which would force me to have to rename my gamertag or buy hard copies and not have access to mods in Fallout 4.  
---
The method with the boards and a in-game box to transfer still work, the server crashing method still works, the trading method still works. Its bananas. Prior to the last patch if you sold the duped items to a vendor then re bought it I believe but cant confirm, it changed the item's coding to hide it as a duped item.   
---
Should be interesting I wonder how many are gonna have no weapons when they log in. 
---
I don't expect them to delete more but I surely expect a bunch of posts claiming the items they lost weren't duped and that they were legit drops. Basically the same "I didn't do anything wrong, Bethesda made a mistake" posts as the people that cried about being banned but were later revealed to be full of shit.  
---
Let the purge rain down. I picked up a couple TSE weapons that someone sold to a vendor, I expect these to disappear, along with a TSE I bought from another player (just assuming they may have all been duped). This will bring a lot of balance and value of legit items back to the game.
---
I completely agree with the player longevity sham. Biggest example is insanely hiking the price of vendor items. If everything cost a mass amount of money players have to play even longer to get even one. It’s a horrible lazy and predatory way of attempting to keep consumers. Not even keep them INTERESTED...just keep them around. 
---
Common sense says tse's are super rare shit I can't tell you how many times I've seen the same 3* roll for sale. Have fun after you lose your duped stuff
---
We shall see, but I run DB queries every day and it really isn't hard to run one and see the number of objects affected. 
---
Tbh. I am already camping out some twitch people. Since they are popular live streamers, I'm sure they got a lot of "Freebies" from viewers that probably picked those items up from dupers.
---
Hi! Thanks for your report, I sent you a PM asking for some additional details.
---
Real world? None. Game world - its Bethesda's decision. It's been discussed since the beta.
---
Your going to get banned illegal stimpak user!! 
---
I'd be amazed. 
---
I get what you're saying, but it's also about play-style.  Different people have different expectations about how their experience should go.  Some of them used these weapons as a crutch to bring reality into alignment with their expectations.  Once they go back out of alignment, I worry that they'll just leave.  That's all I'm saying.
---
Yeah who cares about ethics, they're just what informs laws to help keep groups of people from murdering and stealing.  Fuck ethics, oh hey, wanna volunteer for our no ethics group where we'll rob you stupid then make you out to be the bad guy?  No?
---
Your lack of appreciation for ethics is terrifying to me.  You probably think stealing is okay as long as you're not caught.
---
Standing by...
---
Yeah it's a very popular streamed game. It's up there with... hmm where is it now? Scroll down, scroll down, scroll down, oh there it is. Hey someone has 10 viewers. Cool. I don't like those big popular channels anyway with all of the spam.
---
Yes please. I feel like I can't use any outfit other than the BOS with the red because it has a proper backpack.
---
I've always been annoyed with games where you're an "adventurer" but your character looks like they have nowhere to store all the shit they carry.
---
I had my T-45 pieces vanish from a Power Armor Frame in my stash. I was pulling it out to put a calibrated shock on one of the legs, and nope, not there anymore. I still had the frame, but it was stripped. 
---
The solution is bring in the factions system
---
***\*laughs in pettiness\****
---
It's already starting I haven't even got my popcorn out of the microwave yet this is great!!
---
I would rather spend my time creating a narrative that anyone who complains about problems with this patch was in actuality a duper so that I can maintain my fantasy that there is nothing wrong with the game. That a cabal of toxic haters are responsible for 100% of the complaints for this perfect 10/10 GOTY game.
---
I'm excited that they are deleting the duped items. I feel bad for anyone that truly doesn't know that an item they had was duped. I'm sure there will be a flood of both legitimate (but wrong) and illegitimate claims after the patch that items were wrongly taken.
---
I only ever traded with my one friend or from one character to them back to me on a different character, so I don't expect to lose anything that way... But I've bought legendaries off of vendors at whitespring many times. If any of them are duped that will be quite a bummer.
---
I wonder whatever happened to "It just works"
---
You are just here for my SOOTHING VOICE (turret explodes)
---
Also a tanning salon.  It's very near Fissure site Prime.
---
Serious question: what would the alternative be?
---
Well said, but these items are not just for personal use: they must be used in a service that bathesda provides. They can identify them and are well within their rights to disallow and delete them.
---
Complaining about complaining that isn’t even happening yet and might not! We keep finding new lows!
---
I found one of those, but I'm mot malee build. 
---
Marsupial has been adjusted but unfortunately there was accidentally a - added and now players jump underground instead of in the air.  
---
Prizebot now can randomly provide mini nukes, unfortunately they now explode on being placed in your inventory.  
---
To make powder weapons more useful all ammo can be scrapped to .50 ball ammo [Note: An update will come out in the next patch to add "scrap all" protection to ammo]  
---
All I know is if my TSE I spent weeks farming disappears I’m uninstalling this game.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
If we add that mechanic, would it be possible to turn other players bags into a different color?  In a dicey situation, it is very possible to come back and find my bag among 3 others in the same area.  Yes, there is a quest pointer - but it's accurate about half the time.
---
In such a situation, I hover over each bag until I see one that looks familiar.  If they ALL look familiar.. then.. well.. my apologies to those that deserve one.
---
it's a lot. seriously. every trade window, every youtube video. duped. you can find the exact same weapons on ebay or other sites.
---
You say it: " many jurisdictions". The continental european jurisdiction tradition is different from the anglo-american jurisdiction tradition.
---
IRL when you buy something in continental europe that is stolen/counterfit/smuggled etc. the goods will be confiscated without compensation.
---
I like this aproach. And it was clear from the moment the first duping glitch went public, that there was a high chance you buy a duped item. So I never purchased anything other as from vendors.
---
More people crying about content when the game is a broken mess. How bout play something else or i dont know, do something productive with your life? You are the same people that hit lvl 100 during the beta, litterally do nothing but play video games all day long 
---
No worries, you won't be eating them for long when Bethesda is going to pull the life support for this game since literally nobody is playing it anymore. 
---
&gt;Every moron who paid real money 
---
I keep seeing this sentiment repeated, but it doesn't really hold water.
---
Let's say that your job pays you $8 an hour after taxes and other withholdings.  That's a very modest rate of pay, but let's use it as our example.
---
If you spend six hours server hopping to get an X-01 Jetpack, those are six hours that you could've been working.  At $8 an hour for six hours of your time, you have effectively spent $48 to get that Jetpack.
---
If you hopped on eBay to buy one, they are going for $4.  At that rate, it is half an hour of your time versus six hours that you spent server hopping.
---
This ratio gets even more lopsided if you make a lot more money and/or the RNG gods don't bless you with the Jetpack you want after six hours.
---
So tell me again - why is it dumber to spend less time and resources to get the item?
---
I guess this theory goes out the window if you find server hopping to be really fun.
---
Yes! I want to glow green. Then I can fit in at the golf club.
---
"bad" is a matter of taste.  "objectively bad" and "veritably bad" are just someone claiming their opinion is superior.
---
Players who spent their time, playing this game, should not be punished by having their time deleted. Plain and simply, farming for caps means time spent in the game. If you farmed the currency and traded for something and that trade is deleted (but you don't get the currency back) then that means that you played the game for literally no reason at all. So moving forward, knowing the last month of time has been largely negated (assuming you're casually vending items every day to get to your personal cap limit) what point is it to continue to play? You've just spent a month of game time only to have your efforts wiped.
---
The dupes needed to be dealt with, but not in a way that punishes the general player base as a whole. There are other ways to do it, just learn from other online multiplayer games. This is the result of an inexperienced dev team and it will just alienate the casual players even further.
---
&gt;in 12 months, when the teething is over
---
wew lad
---
except this one is deader
---
Good for you sir! Even if I don't have faith at least you do. I really hope there are enough of you guys to keep the game viable.  I'm not kidding, if you are enjoying this game in it's current form then I am happy for you. Keep it up and don't let anyone change that.
---
they can run around the tent but they normally seem to have a issue with it I think its pathfinding issue but they tend to aim for the tent more then the crops inside - I normally line up my tents on my farm in a circle around a shotgun turret 
---
Are there any particular streamers on twitch or do you think just go with [https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fallout%2076](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Fallout%2076) and see what we get?
---
Didn't we learn anything from the Chicoms and the seditious miners? Communism is bad and is against everything this fine game franchise stands for.
---
As I said, I will believe someone with access to the DB before believing assumptions based on silly anecdotal evidence.
---
Universal healthcare isn't real D:
---
*Nooooooooo!*
---
They did say they doing some things server side for connection. All they'd have to do is fix the time roll back when you crash. Since that's the basis of all dupe glitches. 
---
You spelled Apex wrong 
---
They’re also being vague so people don’t know what exactly they’re going after. I’m sure there is a line of code somewhere that is unique to an item, and if that code exists hundreds of times, then its duped
---
Oh I agree. The T&amp;Cs we signed up to circumvent many of the laws we abide by. 
---
However, my post was to drum up discussion about the ethics if the situation, based on the bona fide purchaser principle. 
---
Legally, there is no issue for Bethesda, clearly. 
---
However, the ethics of the matter are different, and I find it greatly interesting. 
---
Stop being reasonable.  You're not supposed to be reasonable here.
---
Unpopular opinion: if you have 600 in your stash you're hoarding more than you ever should.
---
Once I got into an appropriate crafting/trading cycle my stash stopped hitting it's limit at all.
---
That's nice. But see a screw, or a stupid item in a game means pretty much nothing to me when I'm about to move on anyway. But I can be a constant thorn in any giants side. I have the determination and psychotic tenancies to be an unyielding foe.
---
Dupocalypse Now.
---
Yeah. I've had that trouble too. 
---
Blocked at work - would anybody be willing to copy/paste the post here?
---
The only thing I could think is a rumor I heard which would be solve the duping process and reset the game and take out TSE weapons entirely out of the game.   
---
With the story line from the overseer you where frozen or in a simulation to see how you would act when you are actually released from the vault.
---
If they did a full game wipe then they could I suppose in theory number each item and track them per server and if one was duplicated it could have a . whatever number and flag Bethesda or space magic, or space coding magic.
---
I don't meet any griefers in the game.  On r/fo76 and r/fallout they abound.
---
How do you put so much sarcasm into one post in such a fine way? Teach me master 
---
I cant. My C.A.M.P. budget is maxed.
---
Im not going to pretend all my OP guns are originals, I'll probably lose 80k+ worth of caps spent if they thanos every duped gun but I'm still all for it, I'll buy new guns big deal at least they are still fighting duping
---
I'm just waiting for the next big thing and they move on to harass it - had the same thing happen to the last 3 games I play (still play off and on) moment something like outer worlds drops they will go complain that it hasn't killed fallout and why isn't it as good as new vegas and why isn't there (insert random thing)
---
Last time I've posted something that sarcastic - it was downvoted pretty fast.
---
Now it's seems a big fun for people, right, lol.
---
Unfortunately the best thing to do, if you don’t want to leave or switch servers, is let him kill you and become wanted. People will hunt him down at that point. 
---
What system u on? I’ll take whatever items u have left sorry to see ya leave 
---
Makes perfect sense; you assaulted a duly appointed officer of the United States military. If there's any justice in this world, you were hanged by sundown
---
Thanks for reporting this, we'll investigate!
---
If that's what you believe, then please go play somewhere else and dtop whining about it. 
---
Well that sounds just terrible 
---
“I’m not your buck, buddy”
---
“I’m not your buddy, guy”
---
&gt; We still have the bug that randomly deletes items from inventory
---
Will we.
---
You seem pretty convinced you're going to lose enough stuff to be upset about while also not caring if we don't believe that you're not a duper.
---
Yeah, that checks out.
---
Nope I definitely don’t think that at all. In fact that’s a pretty fucking stupid assumption. I explained myself pretty well. You just seem to have a hard time understanding that I am not Bethesda. Regardless if you like it or not dupes will be gone (or should be)no matter how it came to be in your possession. You can cry ethics but at the end of the day the EULA says you don’t own any of it. So again, it’s like there saying screw your ethics. 
---
My original backing point being the nylon bag, and how Bethesda didn’t speak on it until called out.  
---
Lol, found the duper
---
But duped items are not stolen, counterfeit or smuggled. 
---
It is more akin to a copyright infringement, ad the items are literally identical (so not counterfeit), not smuggled (no territory transfer) or stolen (right to ownership is not interfered with). 
---
An interesting quandary imo. 
---
Hehe. I'm not ready to throw in the towel just yet.
---
Yeah that's true.
---
Writing in big font size don't make your arguments any more legit. Get a life. Nobody cares about you or your bitching.
---
You can’t ignore the “ duped tag “ when u buy buddy...trading 101 
---
People complaining about how Bethesda handles this. Well, I personally don't complain cuz I don't care anymore, but I would absolutely feel bad if my top-tier weapon that I got trading disappears. I mean, that's fine, sure, but give me back what I've traded for it then! (Thankfully I'm not playing F76 anymore.)
---
Bethesda's measures are onesided, punish innocent people more then dupers, and wouldn't be necessary at all if Beth didn't fck everything up in the first place. That's why people are complaining. Not because Beth "fixed" dupes.
---
yes, we've already established your ingenious plan of believing a liar.
---
but you can check for yourself. all major Fo76 youtubers, polarbear, juicehead, captainoob, whoever you're thinking of. whenever they bring their pipboy up you can look for the exact same version on ebay or your preferred website.
---
I know for a fact 4 out of 5 pieces on polarbear's current build are duped.
---
Well I’m coming for that screw then sucka 
---
I noticed that I can see my ultracite armor is ultracite compared to my excavator by the color before actually placing the Power Armor Chassis thing. That helps a bit.

Hello Bob82794882, 
---
Starting off by saying thank you for the insight, as that's a perspective I hadn't really thought of that got me thinking about the state of this patch and the community in response..  Let's have an honest dialogue okay?
---
Look, I can agree with part 1, but your argument for part 2 is fundamentally flawed. No sir, people did not and do not always know those items were duped, especially newer *or more naive* players. I mean think about it: not every single player is up to date on youtube/reddit/twitter constantly finding out the buzz about this game. I know ***some***  players that avoid news about this game entirely, they occasionally read the inside the vaults and that's it. (note I am not saying ***"ALL"*** , please don't get all geared up to chop me up like a gourmand and feed me to a wendigo just yet.)
---
You'd be surprised by the number of honest people that just spent their legitimately earned time and caps to get just a single weapon without that knowledge. Not everyone cared about farming caps, items and all that. some new players just wanted to play the game with a decent looking camp, and a cool weapon that worked with their build, it's truly that simple. 
---
Honestly man, a lot of those people are getting screwed with this update, whether or not you are aware of it. I do not feel bad for the dupers at all, I am happy this update is attempting to stop their income stream and the irreversible damage to the community. 
---
However, I do feel for the innocent players who just purchased these duped weapons unknowingly. My fear is that this particular group of folks exceeds the "small minority of players" bethesda is referring to. This patch will have both it's positives/negatives for sure. All we can do as of now is speculate and use past information about this game's development and controversies to paint a picture of what we think will happen, but the truth is, we just don't know.. We're gonna have to wait and see, we will **all** be affected by this patch as we are **all** playing this online game.
---
Have a wonderful day my guy!
---
Sincerely with care,
---
Jayuk
---
P.s. That was more engaging than i intended it to be, goes to show you what happens when I'm not playing fallout all day 24/7 haha. Anyways, Hope you all stay warm out there, pass someone a smile &amp; wave this valentine's day, especially for those without a valentine,  y'all are loved, and hey at least you got us on reddit! 
---
I dunno man, I don't think a mule counts as an exploit. Duping is an exploit, being immune to damage is an exploit, shooting through walls is an exploit. Sure having a mule might be nice but having to ask a friend to trade with you or hoping loot stays inside a random container is tedious, unreliable and annoying.
---
To me it sounds like you're just jelous it didn't work for you when you tried it. You didn't seem to mind "exploiting" an "unintended" mechanic, but now that it didn't work out for you you're keen on calling out people for it.
---
3 max 3* for 4k?? If you complain about losing those I'm going to comment with my laughter on every post. LOL
---
"But he told me it was his Rolex and the blood was ketchup and I paid my hard earned $50 for it officer! I can't keep it?? Will I get it back *after* the murder trial?? And you're taking the free wedding ring he gave me to?!"
---
It does except no one wants that stuff so it is essentially worthless. Also I am not looking at this from a players standpoint. I'm looking at it from a shop owners standpoint. If you don't have top tier stuff it's worthless trash to most. The economy from a trading standpoint is now fucked for most people. I'm ok with them attempting to fix the duping problem, but now the days of trading in caps are essentially over. It's a catch 22 scenario.
---
It birthed many chuckles and smiles
---
I think all these shit posts are annoying
---
was working for me, at least I was getting that second inner bar on the health, whether it was working properly during use I couldn't say.
---
Salty?
---
I did this once but got stuck inside and picked the lock to escape: WANTED *10*. Bummer 
---
I've seen dupers selling that one, so...
---
Good to know.  Might do that next.
---
Sometimes dupers sell good weapons for high prices like 10k so it seems legit
---
It's gonna sound like a motocross race is this sub...
---
*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE REEE REEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEEEE!*
---
Bye bye TSE, bye bye. 
---
This is going to be a train wreck that hurts the game.  Enjoy your popcorn though!  I’m sure there will be some good laughs.
---
it's not about purity, it's about not knowing any better. lots of people really aren't at all versed well enough in the game.
---
https://youtu.be/Wd86xQbogNY
---
It's a bit of a stretch but maybe the weapons have a UID atatched to them. So when a weapon gets duped, it has the same UID for multiples. So all Beth would have to do is identify UID's with multiple quantity and delete them all.
---
Kind of makes sense since spawns are unique to users. Basically when a weapon spawns it gets a UID that looks like this:
---
username:weaponcode
---
Where the username is the account that the item is attached to. And the weaponcode is the same code from like the wiki that identifies it.
---
So if someone has a weapon that looks like this "duperaccount:handmadeTSE" and the amount of those that exist is 2000. It was duped.
---
I guess that's one way, downside is you'd have a pretty big database as a result. But I imagine they have other ways on the back end too.
---
Just like real life, son. Just like real life. 
---
Yes it was my understanding that there are no unique item IDs
---
From someone that doesn't even play the game anymore no less.
---
Those YouTubers are a very small percentage of the player base and would pay to get those weapons to be able to show them in their videos.
---
This is not representative of actual players, are you actually implying that a handful of YouTubers is a representative sample because that is absolutely insane.
---
\^ 10/10
---
Handling stolen goods, no one's innocent in that supply chain.
---
Also lasts longer too
---
Stranger Danger 
---
That's what I'm worried about. It would destroy my shop if all the plans I've bought over months disappeared.
---
There won’t be a large enough player base by the time Bethesda is done fixing the game. 
---
I'm going to assume that each separately stacked item has a unique identifier and if its duped, they'll have the same identifier. They've probably had a bot crawling through all the characters compiling lists of all the items with duplicate identifiers. 
---
I'm fine with the removal but I've never duped and have nothing to lose. 
---
Theres one thing I'm curious about though and maybe someone can logic a guess. 
---
When they fixed the last duping methods (tho I've seen people say some still exist?) They nerfed the effectiveness of both two shot and explosive guns. This made them less desirable obviously. 
---
So what I'm trying to logic out now is why remove them? They're no longer the God tier weapon. And I domt want to assume, but if they went to the lengths to actually remove them from everyones inventory does that mean maybe they will rebalance them and buff them some once they know the only ones in game are authentic? If that's the case then everyone should be happy about this. Yeah you have to grind some more and actually earn your own weapons, but you should have from the beginning. Maybe I'm just stupidly hopeful my two shot weapon will actually do decent damage again. 
---
Doesn't work on PC. On PC you can only join worlds of friends.
---
https://youtu.be/JGrl_UTKtno This guy gets it.
---
Thanks for reporting this! I'll get this documented so that we can investigate.
---
Actually sounds the opposite. no where does it say attempt to. 
---
This line of logic is toxic detritus and isn't ethically sound in many cases.
---
You didn't know you were selling kids toys covered in lead paint from a chinese retailer?  Sucks to be you since you're the one getting fined!
---
Realistically, when someone is innocently fooled into doing something wrong, legitimately, the fault doesn't actually rest on them.  So many paying customers are going to find their traded items are deleted when they didn't even know they were duplicates.
---
It's sad how apathetic people can be.
---
Have you actually looked at when those posts were posted?
---
Why would you ever pay real money for an in game item? I won't even do microtransactions that shit's lame. I've gotten plenty of good weapons and armor from just playing the game. No tse's but still decent enough weapons to play with. You don't need a jetpack to use x-01 it'll still work without it. RNG sucks but whatever from what I hear about some other games it's common.
---
Fast travel!  Also, all of his upper level doors were unlocked, could have just jumped out.
---
If this just effects TSEs few will complain. 
---
I don’t know about that.  I think it’s fair to be skeptical of the effectiveness of this patch because past history hasn’t been kind to those of us who aren’t cheating.  Kind of like the bug that wiped out mods or bulk items.  That sucked.  And it was completely preventable.   I just hope they don’t take a blanket approach as they did with the explosive nerf. 
---
&gt; most MMORPG games DON'T EITHER
---
So this is your first MMORPG. Got it.
---
Out of the 50 or so that I have played since Ultima Online. Every one has had a GM or other support type person that was capable of fixing stuck characters, resetting broken quests, restoring lost items, etc. This game does not.
---
I mean it’s gonna be sad to not do 509 damage any more if they take away my lever action
---
I just explained to you why.  It takes less time and is less annoying to buy it from someone if you want it.  
---
Besides.  Newsflash - if you paid for the game, you already paid for every single in-game item with real money.  What's another few bucks to improve your experience at that point?
---
It's four bucks.  People spend more than that for their morning coffee.
---
I believe the bunker buster specifically is bugged and does not apply the correct bonus damage but rather only a single point of damage. Thats what I have been told by friends since I never got one. If you should keep them or not is up to you. Pistols arent the best in the game and an underleveled one will do you no favors in combat.  If you want to wait awhile to see if they get around to fixing the bunker buster then it might ne worth keeping since legendary launchers are rare and its a decent effect.
---
Exploipocalypse of the Dupendous Ne'er Dupe Wells.
---
I've gotten everything I wanted and haven't paid a dime past the purchase of the game.
---
This is exactly why folks are shitting themselves.  It's not unwarranted.  Anybody that says differently is deluding themselves.
---
The problem is that duper’s duped everything. Anything you traded with another player for or even bought at a vendor could be duped. 
---
Should send Bethesda a ticket. Also what system are you on?
---
I'm betting on a fixed reward, personally. Say, a squirt gun named Shenandoah River that consumes whiskey to reload
---
I think if it were your death bag it would just look like a normal one but if it was someone else's it could have a red border or something 
---
no, when something is broken it's fucking bad, you may prefer John Deere to Cub Cadet, but if your John Deere is broken it is an objectively bad choice...
---
The new update fixes the problem where pre built camps are very difficult to place, but camps that were already placed before the update are now stuck in the server that they were last placed in. The only way to fix it is through a camp duplication exploit that has a 50/50 chance of crashing the server.
---
Also, placing a camp after the update makes it impossible to add anything to it and players now almost always spawn in the floor underneath their camp, falling through the map. 
---
Strange post.
---
in my books...
---
Disconnects =/= Crashing
---
I would love this, it would help with late night drunk accidental scrappings and sales to vendors 
---
&gt; reduce the frequency
---
is not a fix !!!
---
I was one of the schmucks who bought the game after it was released for the full value of a triple A game. I think I'm entitled to more than 5 hours of quest line gameplay for the price I paid.
---
Power armor has been buggy since before launch, but don't worry - they're working hard on duped weapons.  
---
Don't forget to spend those Atoms!
---
If what you say is true, then the purge will only apply to duped *rare* items like weapons and armor. There would be no way to remove duped consumables like bobbleheads and nuka colas, serum recipes and so on, except if they queried inventories for stacks of those over a certain limit (but where would they establish that? I guess it's possible to collect a hundred bobbleheads of one sort by farming them legitimately, given enough time and dedication, but not so with serum recipes...).
---
That's exactly what a duper would say... ;)
---
Along with your common sense apparently. 
---
A majority of us knew not to touch trades with randoms because the legitimacy of items could not be verified. 
---
Nothing was stolen. Except players time on a shitty "end game" grind.
---
Good thing the only people left are us Vault Dwellers! Now it's patriotic! 
---
Plans that were probably also duped.  
---
I personally got about 12 serums dropped by a lvl 8 in Flatwoods.  I had dropped about 20 fusion cores (I don't use PA) and some ammo.  He was with a lvl 7.  I have them in inventory.... we'll see if they are there after the patch.  Either way at least they were free for me.
---
I think the server issue could be due to duping but I'm not a programmer. 
---
it's not just that. the odds of rolling a god 3\* are less than 0.000001%. rolling an explosive alone is absurdly unlikely.
---
except everyone is running around with godly weapons. where do you think they came from? Whitesprings?
---
no, silly. from discord.
---
But they got rid of duping and now are starting to remove duped items. So they are correcting the problem. It just isn't pleasant. 
---
What melee weapons were duped? Just curious if my increased power attack super sledge is on that list. 
---
*Munch munch* selling every outfit in the game *munch munch* I wonder how you got those *munch munch*
---
enough of your damn level headed logic and reason!!!  this sub is much better suited for OUTRAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I played on a server all by myself last night an entire server for five hours not another player all night!!!  I did every event by myself, uranium fever,  heart of the swamp , and white springs which always has a group of at least 4-6 players constantly farming ghouls was all mine until I got bored of getting crap loot . I didn’t have to worry about being attacked by griefers, or missing out on legendary enemies because I didn’t get a shit in the mix and still it became all quite boring in the long run . This phenomenon is happening more and more often !!
---
You sit have never owned a cork gun as a child. 
---
You give them way too much credit. They have screwed up every patch. I highly doubt they had the forethought to stick in identifying sequences when that cannot even use the right version of the code in a patch. 
---
If it has the same identifier, it is not unique. Databases don't work that way.
---
Why a server would crash when I'm 1 of only 10 or so players (PC) in the world space seems strange. Is the infrastructure so weak that it cannot handle such a small load. Are these severs/virtual world instances running on the cheapest hardware available, or the cheapest rented servers they could find, running in badly maintained server farms with minimal low skilled staff.
---
All Legendary items are now Ghoul-slaying Gamma Guns.
---
Vampiric items now heal the enemy.
---
It was, all rifleman perks 7 luck for all the mutations, demo., adrenaline and the 2 TSE rifles I got grinding the utter crap out of the queen over, and over and over, and over again. Inside a full modded X01 power armor. Also had bandoleer and all. Right now I cant have the woefully nerfed demolition cause I now have to use 8 points in Intelligence to have pipe weapon perk, and the 5 level weapon/gun perk on to prevent the gun from breaking after 4 reloads. Then I have to have the perk in Intel to prevent the core from draining so fast or the perk in Intel that prevent the power armor from breaking to quickly.
---
So right now my build is basically keep things from breaking perks. I hate melee and hate playing that way so am still shooting the bullet sponges that are the enemy and not making much headway
---
I bought one exactly the same minus the targeting hud for 3.8k
---
Or the ability to stash them.  I don't need to carry around the principle safe key for Morgantown high school.  I'm not going to loot it and if I did there is another 10 feet away.
---
Union uniform works with military cap.
---
Let's hope for the best.
---
OP *Stuffs face with popcorn* 
---
Lol, lots of trading that's how I got those
---
Yeah, weapons artisan isn’t working for my grognaks axe still... works on my All Rise, but not the axe...
---
Then they'll just wipe them again. They will probably implement a mandatory wipe every patch from now on. So all these morons trading duped shit for massively inflated cap values or other duped items will get shat on again and again. And also banned. Can't wait to see all the people who only want unyielding sentinel shit to get smacked.
---
So instead of preventing disconnects, "reducing" disconnects is good enough for you?  
---
Just to be safe i got myself a TSE rolling pin last night, bring it on :D
---
Also reported for witch hunting
---
Excellent spot to get frog legs but don’t forget about the snack bar vendor.   They’re a bit aggro 
---
i would tell the toddler to wait while i made popcorn

Op slowly reaches for more popcorn
---
Remove duped consumables easier, but harder to understand which of them are copied. After all, two stimpaks do not differ at all from each other... Unlike weapons, where a combination of mods, effects, condition, and perhaps something else, should be quite rare.
---
Eh, I'll cut them some slack for that.  If there were one cause for all server instability and they could implement an instant fix to that, I imagine they would've done it by now.  They can't promise to fix all disconnects period, because shit happens.
---
With the increase of prices and my unwillingness to hop around for 2 months to sell all my wares anymore. If they did a reset id probably be done permanently. Not my fault so many people drop their morals when no ones looking.  Id like that whole leveling for the first time experience again. But  usually the only time that is done is in expansions by adding levels. Or survival games that add so much content its worth starting over.  The only thing that would happen is they'd loose a good chunk of the 5% of people who didn't quit after a month or 2.
---
That's what I'm wondering.  I got a TSE double barrel shotgun through trade with someone that is on my friends list.  Paid 2000 caps for it. They claim not to have dupped, but what if they did?  I'd love to know how they determine what is or isn't dupped.  Then again, that might have tipped off people who can find a loophole to bypass detection.  Have an upvote though.  You have a legit concern.
---
I love the way you duplicated the post, nice touch!
---
Is it Two Shot Explosive or Furious? Can't be Instigating unless you get consent from an Assaultron first...
---
I swear to god, if someone deletes his duped post, I WILL RAAAAAGE &gt;:(
---
Same here...this is more e citing then its release 
---
At the end of the game it's supposed to be fun; grinding endlessly to lose what minute reward you earned makes people stop playing.
---
FO76 doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt; they have to prove they can competently solve this issue. So far all the evidence has pointed to the contrary.
---
Would think more players would want lesser stuffs now if they can't obtain top tier pieces as easily.  At least that's how its always been for me - I buy up the trash cause I'm poor.
---
Far more regular players will be impacted for sure. And that’s the “fix”. They released a broken game. 
---
When was Bethesda ever known for doing anything perfectly?
---
OP Sluuurping from soda
---
Me too, thanks for the post!
---
Or they could just have them a level 100+ requirement....
---
At level 183 shouldn’t struggle with anything.  Maybe some things take a while to kill. 
---
Nothing to do now but wait and see, chances are they only target a few items or excessive stacks of items and everyone would be good.  If people log into most weapons/armor deleted the game will die, one would thing Bethesda realizes this.
---
You had me at "Ultima".....
---
"  I highly doubt they'll fuck this up **that bad**  "
---
I got wanted yesterday for shooting at and missing a Scorched over in the TNT area in the forest, my bullet hit a completely dark camp that was back in the trees....I just logged off and played another game, unfortunately the entire shitbag map will spend 20caps to fast travel and hunt down a 10 cap bounty....
---
I have found that locks in the virtual world do just what they do in the real world.  They keep honest people honest.    Griefers will grief, looters will loot.  My experience is that most people are just curious and like to see what you've done and are just looky loos.
---
Sorry officer. I didn't know this stolen car was stolen. Can I keep it tho?
---
That patch feels like an in coming shitstorm. HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE!
---
I understand that, it's great they are removing duped weapons after initially saying it was impossible to identify certain guns or replace them (if they were lost legitimately in a crash or disconnect for example)
---
However, it still doesn't fix the issue where a player legitimately purchase a item using the in game trading menu and they couldn't see if it was a duped item. They lost legitimate caps, or legitimate trades without knowing. Which will not be replaced.
---
Im also skeptical of their motive. Im half expecting them to "accidentally" remove all TS, E, BE items from ALL inventories and make them Lunchbox only purchases after seeing how popular they were for profit.
---
ah, you make some good points actually about honestly traded items and things you buy at vendors that were sold by other players
---
I'm running out of popcorn here I may have to run to the store 
---
Whoa.
---
Actually they are way more stable nowadays.
---
So duping and server hopping adressed (obviously not fixed) sliwky get the job done. 
---
Truth is, the game was poorly designed from the start 
---
Too little too late
---
Let's start making bingo cards, winners get 25 Atoms.

I really want something in the lines of this [https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/28834/28834-1514829974-411402742.jpeg](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1151/images/28834/28834-1514829974-411402742.jpeg) (to be honest beth sould just go to nexus and see the building section)
---
Bethesda: *adds pooper scooper to legendary loot pool*
---
Now requires a Perk Card swap to switch weapons.
---
The only trades ive made are to a  container near any train station. Since im to lazy to bulk and sell items or because patterns can't be sold to vendors.  Sometimes they have stuff in it from other players.
---
Yeah! I want my 30% damage to ghouls Groknak axe back. Dropped and disappeared 😕
---
Judgement is based on facts.
---
This game fucks up more with every patch. Fact.
---
So yeah people are gonna judge before the patch because it’s a legitimate concern 
---
I'm looking forward to it, tho I know how regular buyers feel. It would suck to loose 25kc+ worth of items due to buying duped items when they did not have any idea they were duped.
---
I'm freaking out because Bobby pins might weigh a pound
---
If bethesda has had even ONE patch that didn’t break something worse than it fixed, I’d be more optimistic. 
---
Look at the bright side, this will free up space from all your duped items. 
---
SHIT I HAVE 4000
---
[Removed] for burnt popcorn 
---
It works the same way in the real world. You buy stolen goods and the crime is traced, those stolen goods get confiscated.
---
Just kill the people with multiple duped items. But let me keep my 2 star TSE combat shotgun I spent 12000 caps for. PLS BETHESDA.
---
Again access to the database and logs is far better than the assumptions you're throwing out with absolutely no data to support.
---
What you and a lot of other people don't seem to understand is if they turned on and started archiving logs when the duplication started happening now that they have algorithms to identify the actions of dupers it is actually really easy to go back and Trace where those specific items went. Then you delete those specific items no matter where they are presently.
---
For people who paid a thousand caps for the weapon wow, they lost a thousand caps, not really a very big deal. I think you've seriously overestimating the amount of people who paid real world money for game items as it relates to the total number of players.
---
Isn't Photosynthetic useless once you get the Healing Factor mutation?
---
Hopefully 👍
---
Unfortunately you cant prove it wasnt duped. Nature of the beast.
---
See? This guy gets it!
---
Smh OP ;)
---
Funny
---
just put it in your inventory and then drop it, like you were throwing it away. it'll probably be a duped set of whatever you are wearing. This happened to me before. 
---
what are patterns?
---
The proof is the flood of quad explosive hunting rifles that showed up in the hundreds on LFG on Xbox. Hunting rifles were added as a drop after the duplication glitch patch. 
---
I'm sure a lot of people will. I'm not a spiteful asshole to people who are actually benefiting the real economy, rather than some fictional BS economy in a broken game.
---
sure,, why not?
---
it seems like there is going to be alot of collateral damage with this, even for people who genuinely had no clue the item the bought/traded for was a dupe
---
Im still only lvl 35 and all my weapons are pretty crappy, but I could see an issue if I had spent thousands of caps in what was believed to be an honest transaction... im still not sure how people ever get thousands of caps as i seem to struggle to keep mine around 1000 caps 
---
This is formality. As a player all I care is that my workshop is gone. And the solution they are providing is just reducing disconnects. Not good enough in my books.
---
they made a mod for it for Skyrim too. «No rain under roof»
---
The once elusive golfer ghouls, now replace every single enemy type in the game. 
---
Reducing it is implementing a fix to something specific they have identified. So not getting your point. There can be 10000000 reasons why disconnects happen. Also my windows and OSx crash sometimes. why hasn't microsoft and apple prevented that from happening 100%. It will never be 100% is the point.
---
Thank you for the subtitle hint 
---
Well, a bunch of guns are obvious, but under the radar are, I think, going to be some other hits. Namely:  
---
Certain Bobbleheads.  
---
Certain Magazines.  
---
Stable Flux of all kinds.  
---
Certain Plans.  
---
Certain ultra-rare apparel.  
---
Those are the ones that I thnk people are gonna get hammered on. The first two are to roll back powerhouses before PVP, Flux in general, while the final two are heading off market forces before they get installed.   
---
(ultra-rare apparel like the BoS jumpsuit or the Double Diamond mechanics jumpsuit, not, like, a Skeleton outfit.)
---
It happened 
---
Nobody can take away the memory of the sweet sweet deals they got on those dupes. Consider it a rental. Any actual items you earned yourself will be there and the economy will improve and function as was intended.
---
The TSE nerf was a much bigger power shift than losing any duped items. You can pick up any good 1 star version and kill whatever you need to. 
---
Dupers are going to have multiple rare items in their inventory, it's not too difficult to figure out.
---
Mule characters and mule accounts are everywhere as is. Bethesda sold copies due to the tiny stash
---
Preety much 
---
Salty troll is salty.
---
There is a Union cap at the cemetery on top of that big rock formation that looks like a skull.
---
Already crying for your lost items? 
---
Instigating or anti-armor are good.
---
I agree but you can’t put a drop rate % with out knowing all the variables. Most note-able variable being does every legendary creature drop corresponding loot. Such as 1* creature = 1* loot, 2* = 2*, 3* = 3*. You could use all the available info we have to get an approximation of .12% (assuming your using the data posted yesterday about legendary prefixes n total weapons n armor) however, you’re trying to solve an equation with multiple unknown variables. What if 1* is only supposed to drop 1* loot 99% of the time n 1% chance to get a drill or flare gun as a joke. Or is 3* meaning 3 times as likely to drop a 1* item. Or 3* can drop a 3* 10% of the time n 90% it drops a 2* n a 1* equaling 3* loot. I mean what’s the likelihood I get the same exterminator left arm combat armor from the same ghoul in whitesprings parking lot 3 separate times. (Actually happened n still wearing the last one) But at level 101 I have yet to find any TSE or any explosive weapons (not that I need them to play the game but it’s just an observation). I agree the loot system is fucked but until Bethesda tells us how their “random” loot generator is working we have no idea of the actual  % 
---
Better wait a few months to make sure there are no new exploits. 
---
You sure about that ?
---
I have TSE Ultracite Laser Rifle too, guess we'll know who got the original
---
Regarding the economy, I disagree. I feel like they are fighting real hard to preserve the economy. All mmo have some sort of economy. There is no central trade but cap generation is heavily controlled through vendor limits, caps destroyed at vendors, stash limits, and random generation limits. A wipe is something that will destabilize the in game economy the same as in the real world. Depending on the interventions, it can lead to a depression or inflation of perceived value of the few items that have common trade and cap value. People may decide to hoard instead of trade or trade instead of save. People may change how they play the game based on the economy. 
---
The Bethesda post says *" These removals are highly-targeted at a specific list of items. "*  I think we both have a pretty good idea of what they will be targeting, and anybody who traded for those "rare" items knew that at some point they were probably duped.
---
 You don’t exterminate bugs with flamethrowers. You don’t put out fires with cups of water. 
---
That’s the problem here, just chance bug and flamethrower and fire and water with game related issues 
---
welcome to reddit
---
If duped items were not harming the game community then it would not be an issue. Ethicality the good of the many vs good of the few.
---
No, they are non tangible items... 
---
The interesting thing is I’ve played this game since it was released and I haven’t even found all the locations yet. This solution doesn’t affect me because everything I have, I found myself from exploring. It’s part of the fun, using the gear you have at the time to overcome the obstacles. 
---
The comparison is completely out of thin air.  Whenever a workshop is taken the server crashes within 45 min. Every single time.  My Mac or Windows don't crash after 45 min.  Stop defending something that is clearly broken.
---
Yep it is, which if they in the code, started numbering the items and they could see the items duplicated. Not knowing their servers or specific programs being run I am unsure on the strain that would put on the stability 
---
Maybe 2.  Or three if you are lazy......
---
Swarm of Suitors is just outright broken.  Pretend it doesn't exist.
---
&gt;Again access to the database and logs is far better than the assumptions you're throwing out with absolutely no data to support.
---
except we don't have access to those logs so we have to take Bethesda on their word. and, as we have already established, that's a **great** idea.
---
&gt;What you and a lot of other people don't seem to understand is [...]
---
I'm not arguing that point at all.
---
&gt;For people who paid a thousand caps for the weapon wow, they lost a thousand caps, not really a very big deal. I think you've seriously overestimating the amount of people who paid real world money for game items as it relates to the total number of players.
---
people don't like being screwed out of 1k caps. or 10k or 25k. or even the god roll they got for free from a shady fella near vault 76. regardless, that's also not my point.
---
my point is that *you* are underestimating just how many duped items are going around and how many people have/had them. and let me tell you, it's a lot. like the majority.
---
Lol yes!
---
heheheh I found my first scorchbeast poop pile last night actually, i giggled
---
Yeah... That's why was thinking too. But then again not sure the sale was even allowed in the first place.
---
Halloween candy?  Really?  Why?  I've been saving up (I have 2000 right now) but I didn't think there were any good prizes.
---
Sounds like you need a break from the game.
---
I would think all the offloading of dupped items has been done already, I'd say this is genuine. However as there is no escrow system in FO76 like in for example Eve Online, I won't touch anything like this as the risk is too high.
---
Player trading was promoted as a major feature right? Your argument only makes BGS look worse. 
---
Simply return the item for a full refund :)
---
Duper
---
i almost sprayed oatmeal on my keyboard reading this.  low key the funniest post i've read in a while.
---
Actually yea, that's a good point... so in theory 1000 of the same gun should stack then. Unless its two part with original configuration + mods but still. Oh well. 
---
I will point out this...
---
Bethesda don't control your pc, your internal network, your router, your ISP, the peering links, the backbone providers.
---
They can however control the server software and to an extent, the cloud system in use, tho they Don't control the cloud provider itself.
---
There are MANY links in the chain, they can do their best to strengthen it, but hey, in reality, Most of its not under their direct control.
---
It was that last one that got me. 
---
The only weapons I carry(both stash and inventory) are 2 3*’s and a 2*. Wouldn’t surprise me if they were all duped. I hope I don’t lose ‘em.
---
Fucking a, that dude is trash.
---
I’ll give you mine for free if you’re on PS4 n yours gets deleted. 
---
Nice work!
---
I love your common sense approach and realizing it's for the greater good
---
Why would they give out a list?
---
Nuke zone without pacifist and a stray bullet hits someone.
---
They turn around to 1 shot you because they are level 205 and have collected every highest damage weapon in game. This happened to me quite a few times before I just said fuck it and turned pacifist mode for permanent PVE.
---
The community was really good to one another when this first came out, but then a bunch of ding dongs got the game and tried to play it like Rust.
---
The PVP in this game is so broken that it deserved an entirely separate instance of matchmaking.
---
Am I the only one reading this that expected it to end with his camp full of toilets?
---
Countered with "Duping is ruining the game" posts from the last 3 months. But i agree, sort of,they should be working on other things.
---
If there is more than one cause for a disconnect it is.
---
I love the game.  Does it have some issues?  Yes.  Do they make the game unplayable?  Not by a long shot.
---
I agree an most of your statements, especially 3. My only TSE dropped very late in the game (after the nerf) for me. It is useless as it lives only for 200 rounds. Even pre-nerf, with more damage, I wouldn't have known what to kill as there is no content or no content that is worth (messed up loot tables for months). I don't care about TSE weapons in general. And I don't care whether someone has bought a duped one as I don't see where this would interfere with me playing the game. Give me some suggestions, please.
---
And the economy? What economy?
---
The discussion about duped items acts as a red herring. At least to some degree.
---
And now I want to see downvotes for at least 100 points! I don't care.
---
Well quite - you're all awful.
---
Union cap looks horrible. But yes it is near hopewells cave. In an unmarked cemetery. 
---
You said there are other ways of dealing with this and insinuated that other devs and solved similar problems. Can you give us an example that would get rid of duped items while compensating players for the caps they spent?
---
 &gt; ...then that means that you played the game for literally no reason at all.  
---
If you're playing a Fallout game solely for the loot, I think you're playing wrong. There are actual loot 'n shoots like Destiny and Anthem just around the corner. 
---
Wrong
---
I don’t think it’s about the economy. It’s about making the server stable, reducing spinning arrow sign.
---
A.W.S.
---
OP don't be mad your cheater weapons will be no more.
---
Heh?  Seriously?  That would have been nice to know after burning through all my disease cures up after like the first day of being slapped by diseased ghouls in WS.  Good to know though.  
---
Watching incels critique somebody's programming skills is like watching a 400lb guy go on about sports performances. 
---
Doesn't matter, here we are.
---
Lolz 
---
I don’t care 
---
*I highly doubt they'll fuck this up*
---
# 
---
# LOL
---
My only concern is that they're gonna fuck it up somehow.
---
I never duped anything, Never traded anything with anyone, and think the removing of duped items is a really good fucking idea.
---
But they don't have the best track record with getting shit right, so I'm a bit concerned that they're going to fuck it up somehow.
---
And how many did you buy before realizing this?! Lol
---
Only thing I'm worried about is something I bought off a bot vendor.  An AA Exploding lever rifle that I bought someone had sold to it a couple months ago.  Hope it's not duped :/
---
In the real world there are ways to check in the game you can’t. 
---
I have to agree here... my fear is they are going to take any weapon with the same stats as a duped weapon.  Even if you got your drop legit, if it's identical to the duped, you're SOL.
---
But, at the same time, I dont think Beth could even do that right.  So more than likely, they are just removing bobbleheadsX1000, nukasX1000, mr fuzzy stuff.  Things you could in no way get legit.
---
I usually just do this. go from the left side of your mousepad all the way to the right. See how much that turns your character. tweak sens in wahtevber game to produce the same movement. For me, i always have a mousepad swipe do a 180.
---
Well, bye then.
---
nice to see another soul with the common sense to realise, its not all their fault potentially. 
---
thanks for this message, positive and rational debate are a dying art my man
---
Shitty communication and extreme lag fixing the game was hemorrhaging players.  
---
TSE and other nerfs pushed more players away.  
---
This blanket purge is going to push even more.  
---
They brought this ALL on themselves.  Their inept and it shows.  Just takes some people a lot longer to see it than others.
---
Your point is based on assumptions that you have made based on nothing concrete whereas the other statement was made by people with access to the data. 
---
Data wins, sorry.
---
I'm sure I had lvl 45 legendary drop there , at least at launch, the events got nerfed meanwhile .
---
If you didn't dupe the items necessary to craft it, or purchase it from someone who possibly duped it, then you should have nothing to worry about.
---
random guy don't be mad if a good chunk of the players leave and they pull the plug on the servers
---
Got to get them last few hours of troll in before they lose them weapons..
---
Outside of this sub everyone talks about how vehemently people on fo76 defend the "shitheap".
---
3 pages of nothing but rants about how fucked the game is all i see personally.
---
Damn when you put it that way...  Still isn't it illegal as per the EULA?  Those weapons are technically the property of Bethesda so isn't it illegal to be selling them for real world money to begin with as they're technically not ours to profit off of by selling for real money?
---
156 levels with a ton of nuked legendary farming and I’ve only ever found two 2shot 1star non-explosive legendaries. And neither was level 50 smh. 
---
... OP must be new here...
---
Who in the hell of it buys a virtual gun off ebay for a game you're gonna play for 3 months and get bored of..?
---
I would be happy if they made it so that legendary enemies actually droped legendary items. It's bad enough that we have to deal with the RNG on the items but having to worry if one will even drop is a bit much lol
---
thats what im asking 
---
Yeah, I have a quad pump shoty, but that’s it. I’m still rocking about 200 damage, but it’s a little slow. 
---
I also carry an auto grenade and Gatling gun. 
---
I haven’t done the tunnel yet. I get distracted by making caps. But I’ll do it this weekend. 
---
Real talk, if they actually got Cave Johnson's VA to do the voice and in the personality (and got it okay'ed with valve) for a developer update video, I wouldn't even be mad even if it was an excuse for them to insult us, it's Cave Johnson.
---
I found a lot of good weapons, that just were not right for my build.  AAE weapons, and other things... I traded most of them for weapons I liked better or were better for my build...  Now I have to worry about the origin of these weapons.  I didn't go looking for dupers, I went looking for traders.  I didn't trade with a person who had 1000s of anything in their inventory... I didn't trust them.  But now, if that gun I got was obtained originally from a dupe, then traded hands 4 or 5 times... now I lose my weapon?
---
I found over 17,000 Nuka Cola Quantums in the suitcase in Watoga Station this weekend, obviously duped. I tried to grab a few to immediately drink but for whatever reason it didn't allow me to take any amount of them. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
How about, stahp. Farming it is pointless and boring.  It doesn't even flinch or move when you shoot it in the face. 
---
They deserve 95% of the vitriol spewed at them...
---
LOL :D
---
Not at all.  I read it and it was pretty pathetic.  Duping is theft.  If you believe different,  that's your hangup,  not mine 
---
&gt;Good news: we have deleted all the duped items. 
---
&gt;Bad News: We accidentally deleted the Cranberry Bog and can't find the backup.
---
just here to add that there's probably a good number of us that really don't care enough to interact with others enough to trade.   about the closest i come is dropping recipes i already know in front of someone if i notice i've got a few.  i'm personally far more concerned with the horrible input lag and spiking framerates and a host of actual technical issues.  i don't think i'd quit playing just because they told me i can't cheat anymore.
---
Yup just like if you buy stolen goods you can still be prosecuted. Ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law. I don’t agree with it but that’s the way it is unfortunately. 
---
P.S. if you’re on PS4 I can give you an executioners 10mm. I only use it to kill muties in the forest anymore. 
---
It's customer service that doesn't have tools to look up a player's inventory.  Not the database administrators...  And they don't need to know what used to be in your inventory but is now gone to see what is currently in your inventory.  One way today is sure to be a mess is because of how you interpret what is happening.
---
So if they crashes reduce it to .001% of the current rate would you not call that resolved?
---
&gt;  But that’s out of stupidity, not value.
---
The value is only as much as you are willing to pay for it, but yes, it is increased by supply, demand and stupidity
---
No, I'm fairly certain you are correct.  As the transaction itself was illegal any contractual obligation stated or implied within the transaction is void.
---
Legally it's about the same as calling the cops because someone stole your heroin.
---
You get free candy as compensation.
---
The lack of development direction, updates, and improvements coupled with the continuing rise of corporate greed, is what is ruining this game.
---
Any ghouls hiding on the underside?
---
It said it's targeting a specific list of items.  Not specific list of players.  Pretty sure that means something along the lines of deleting all bloodied, +1 str, 90% weight reduction super sledges.  Duped or not. That's my interpretation anyway.
---
No, I just pointed out from a technical standpoint that they are doing their best to control things that are mostly outwith their control.
---
Funnily enough... As a PC player I have had No Issues keeping 5 workshops in game under my control. So in that regard, I feel that its somewhere else that's the issue.
---
Then again my system is a finely tuned beast.
---
So yeah, I have my suspicions that its More than simply, a server side thing, buddy.
---
the players being mad or people quitting? 
---
I have a tse cryo and a tse tesla. I hope they weren't duped! A friend gave them to me, he got them from someone else, I bet I lose them today but that's how it goes 
---
Selling 200 caps to 7 different vendors every day for a few weeks. Takes a few hours everyday. So a player who spent 14 days grinding caps to get 20k which they use to buy a bloody faster fire shotgun will lose 28 hours worth of their time. 
---
Don't like it, EA has a few games they want to sell you.
---
What’s fast travel?
---
Yes it does, popping out of a bottle is quite a bit of joy...
---
I'm all ears what's your suggestion other than removing the duped items?
---
Someone should go to the West end maintenance and see if a power armor is stashed there.
---
Only trade with trusted sources, people buying duped weapons and losing them will have to find a more reliable source for items.
---
Sounds like the free market is alive and well in the wasteland.
---
Its actually a perfect example because MS and Apple have FARRRR more money and resources and cannot produce a perfect product that never crashes. 
---
&gt;Data wins, sorry.
---
data you don't have.
---
&gt;Your point is based on assumptions that you have made based on nothing concrete
---
nothing concrete? I just said you can check youtubers for yourself. or crunch the numbers to see how hard it really is to roll a godly weapon. Fo76 must defy probability because every person I come across is sporting a perfect TSE.
---
&gt;whereas the other statement was made by people with access to the data.
---
and who are also known to be compulsive liars. yeah. like I keep saying, your plan is perfect.
---
You seem more like a troll than a genius. ;-) 
---
Oh man, that's too real
---
Virtual penis extensions have there place I suppose.
---
Hrmm, So far they have Banned players, reduced loot from legendary mobs and now this. Seems like they are on the 3rd step of the 40,000 step Developers Anonymous program.
---
1) Ban the heretic
---
2) Tweak the mutant
---
**3) Purge the unclean**  
---
Beta doesn't count. Release does and they've been creating a grind instead of a game.
---
I agree.
---
Bethesda can only control what it controls.  If a problem originates on their end, it's their responsibility to fix it.  But not every crash or disconnect is their fault.
---
Lol at all the children blindly assuming I’m a duper. 
---
No problem.The guy who I bought it off when we were discussing price linked me to a thread of another similar one that had sold previously. The price that one went for was 4k but after it had sold there were others offering 5k (maybe more?).  Also had the nuka paint job too.
---
THEY . BROKE . THE . QUANTITY . SLIDER .  lol
---
If you buy stolen goods,  your knowledge of thier provenance isn't worth dick. They will still be seized.  
---
&gt;You're slowly working through the game's issues and in 12 months, when the teething is over
---
The game was released month ago, what are you thanking them for?
---
Seriously. I hear about them here but in general I'm not encountering them. Granted I haven't really explored the east side of the map yet so maybe they're all on that side of the map. In general I have been meeting friendly people in FO76. It's absolutely refreshing and has totally been not what I expected when they announced PvP (I totally expected it to be like GTA except they gave me a chance to sneak so I could avoid people. Now a days I don't even try to sneak by people. I usually wave to them as I sneak by &lt;- I'm always sneaking anyways but now I actually even let them know I'm around).
---
I think they're just joking. Just a good bit of fun. I didn't take any of those posts seriously.
---
Hey! That was me!! Glad I could help you out brother.
---
My favorite pvp encounter was trying to buy something in watoga station, only to have 4 guys try to initiate combat with me. I ignored them, until they started meleeing me, triggering my shock mutation. This damaged the melee guy, allowing the rest of the team to kill me with tse guns.
---
I dont see why they try to fix nobody plays it and if they do fix it they'll just dupe it again. They didn't  fix the bugs just taking stuff out
---
They will likely never give out information on how they decided to remove things.  "Keep the dupers guessing" type deal.
---
I agree if this just effects TSEs and a few others few will complain. 
---
do you want to lose the other half as well, then?
---
Yes but it’s okay because you’d be able to picklock yourself out of prison
---
Cya
---
But only at lvl 3 perk
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA, i hope ebay sellers get stuck with the bill!!!!!!! hahahahaha
---
Haha I'm expecting to log back in with no armour on and nothing in my inventory except spoiled meat and dirty water.
---
Deleting duped items, while duping exploits are not fixed. 
---
OK.
---
did you dupe them? are you talking about 13535232532432 bobby pins or like 500.
---
Most people do not follow this reddit. Most do not have any epic legendaries. So most will be unaffected by this and most will not even notice it (unless BGS breaks something in the implementation of this purge).
---
Well with how social I am (not), that's not suuuuper likely, unless I decide to level my other character which I created back when I thought that the stash was shared on an account. Herpaderp! :K
---
But it's pretty good advice. Who knows, may run into someone for it.
---
I have a mic but rarely run into someone that talks. Although sometimes it's nice to have silence unless you like playing with some kid whose every other word is the f-word. I was in a party where someone kept blasting music and I just muted them. The other day I played a few hours and then someone showed up at a workshop I had and started talking. So I put on my headset mic and we just ended up talking instead of playing. I do team from time to time with people and use party. The other day I teamed with a level 12 player with no mic and tried to tell him where I kept some plans I don't use and told him to give me a 'thumbs up' emoji if he could hear me and he didn't do anything so I assume he couldn't hear me. But he kept spamming the trade emoji. I finally did trade with him to see what weapons he had and gave him some ammo. He had like 20 plans. I teamed with a kid once and upon talking to him he says 'do you have this, do you have that, I need this, I need that'. Then he had to log off to go play Fortnite with his friends and wanted me to take the munitions factory to make him ammo. I told him to take time out of his busy life and do it himself. He said I was greedy. Ugh, kids these days...
---
Why would your shotgun be deleted? Did you knowingly buy a duped gun? For 10,000?
---
oh i forgot to post that! im on Ps4, and ill have to wait until i get home, i cant seem to access the bethesda site at work, but good call!!!
---
&gt;Stop preemptively defending...
---
Stop blaming players for Bethesda's mistakes.
---
Woo boy you are in for a treat!  If you open up your map, you can click on places where you have been in the past and pay caps to "fast travel" to them.  Vault 76 and your C.A.M.P. are always free to travel too.
---
 just two /s
---
YouTubers as a data set is not valid, they are not in any way "normal" players, lmao.
---
Please feel free to provide a list of all these "lies" you keep mentioning. While their statements have been unclear and they haven't been as transparent as I would likez the only major "lie" I can identify so far is about the stash size, and that was a statement made pre-launch that I am not happy about but is somewhat understandable.
---
So, please list these blatant and obvious "lies", I will wait (a long time).
---
Guess what ? I have the same gauntlet lol . I think that we’re in the same boat lmao 
---
:)
---
If you think Bethesda knows for sure what effects their code will have on the game, you haven't been paying attention to the last few patches.  They can't tell you what they don't know.
---
yeah well you can get close enough using that method. The aiming in this game is strange anyway, there always some wierd input lag for me.
---
You can't fast travel while taken damage/enemies nearby. If they have a bleed effect on melee or are consistently attacking. No way you can fast travel away. Server switch or death are the choices. 
---
Oh my stars and garters! 
---
Right now I, a bit of both. A genius troll.
---
And it’s not a good place to be if you are BGS. 
---
ugh im sorry to hear its an issue for you too- how long have you had the bug? has it ever gone away on its own?
---
Exactly.
---
very few companies give in depth details and explanations of what they are doing, you just  need the basics.
---
ugh
---
Send me your tag!
---
Facts lmao 
---
These goods are not stolen. 
---
They are copied. 
---
So the laws you refer to are not relevant. 
---
So these games are just experiments like the vaults? 🤔
---
Junk has no owner. You can’t steal junk unless it’s locked. PVP for junk? On the hand, the game should allow other players to steal your power armor. 
---
They have ruined this game. But I haven't given up on it yet. 
---
I team up some but rarely get invites. One day I had a few workshops and was ready to log off after playing a few hours and I kept sending people team requests and nobody wanted to team.
---
Everyone moved to duping/selling anti armor explosive, bloodied and instigating.
---
They could either continue nerfing everything or do a wipe.
---
They are doing a wipe.
---
I remember back in november when everyone wanted dupers banned and people who benefited from dupers to have their accounts wiped.
---
then after the legendary giveaway discords started popping up, this number started to dwindle. then it was just "fix the duping itself" and nothing else.
---
funny.
---
waaaahhh!!
---
Let me preface  this with i 100% support the banning of cheaters in multi player games
---
I only question how this is going to affect peoples willingness to trade moving forward. The economy is already a stunted red headed step child.
---
I know up to this point I have avoided trading because lord knows where there items come from, and if i can play legit and get whammied by losing rare mats/caps retroactively kind of freaks me out. I know bethesda wants to side with legit players but we live in a very harsh reality.
---
...but you'll have to hide them...somewhere...to get them in.
---
Stop and think about the times bethesda hasn’t fucked up on 76. Its very safe to assume they will mess this up and some people’s inventories will be wiped by accident 
---
They know enough to know the value of what they're paying for. They've played enough to gather the thousands and thousands of caps required for the purchase and long enough to know how rare what they're paying for is to rationalize the high price.
---
So you're saying it's not a grind and losing those caps aren't a big deal? So you still wouldn't lose the casual audience? Thanks for the confirmation. 
---
Maybe I’m just unlucky but I meet at least one every session I play.
---
The new content is in the atom shop lol
---
Full automatic weapons will do damage with a single clip, but as soon as you reload then the bullets wont connect with your target.
---
Bethesda is just as bad now.
---
Selling items to the whitesprings vendor and having multiple people buy the item was one of the duping methods. If you happened across a vendor that was used for duping, you're probably fucked too.
---
If they didn't have to fight the dupers, they could have spent the time developing more content.
---
Funny that, eh
---
Except there shouldn't be this much to fix. Seems like we're in a steam early access game. 
---
\*whispers\* No one reasonable is saying that.
---
If mom-moo has 2 heads...then 2 bungholes? poop-poop?
---
The only harm is the effect on market value, from what I can see. Which also had taken hits from other factors,  such as less players and Bethesda nerfs (TSE specifically). 
---
So it is a complex issue, for sure. 
---
Well said 👍
---
Reddit killed this game, bad publicity means they stop supporting it. Same with star wars bf2. 
---
They aren't adding new content eo you will still just be farming things 
---
Thing is, is anyone even going to buy something with caps? Because caps have no value. People rather be like:"I have AFT Lever Action, I'll trade it for AFT handmade". 
---
About to loose all those god toys :((
---
Have you played other online games with similar amount of players than in FO76? Do they crash as often?  
---
&gt; I have Super Mutants to go shoot in the face 
---
After maintenance.  And maybe with a different gun. ;-) 
---
Oh, I think people will still complain, especially if they made a recent trade for the latest hot weapons or armor.  If the trade was started in an online forum, I think they were savvy enough to know what they were getting into, so i don't wanna hear them saying "I had no idea they were duped".
---
Yeah, it's only an estimation based on the odds of receiving all the prefixes you want, on the weapon you want. I think that estimation may need to be much lower after the last patch, due to some Leg's not dropping anything now, and also doesn't take into account the frequency of recieving 1-2 stars over 3.
---
I'm only worried about a lever rifle I bought off a bot vendor.  It was back before TSE was nerfed, so the fact that it's an anti armor exploding rifle probably meant that it was 'not good enough' for someone who farmed it and sold it to a vendor.  I hope it's still there, but if it's not, I'll be fine with that knowing that it took out all the duped stuff.
---
The player economy is basically the base of players in the game who only use the game as a point to gain Caps through being merchants. They establish their prices, sell what they can, and until recently, duplicated rare items to sell en masse for easy caps. Seeing as all these rare items will soon be deleted, the merchant base will be forced to find these items legitimately in order to trade them, not only raising the prices on these items but making them much less accessible to the masses.
---
I hope your issue get fixed that sounds like a super annoying bug!
---
&gt;YouTubers as a data set is not valid, they are not in any way "normal" players, lmao.
---
maybe so, but if you crunch the numbers like I just said you'll notice an anomaly, to say the least, when it comes to the ratio between odds/population. it's virtually impossible for so many people to be running around with god rolls.
---
&gt;So, please list these blatant and obvious "lies", I will wait (a long time).
---
are you for real? Bethesda is a meme, that's how bad it is. the burden of proof is not on me.
---
&gt;I don't need the data because I didn't make the statement, the people with access to it **who also do not have a demonstrated history of outright lies** did :)
---
and that's where you're wrong.
---
Bye bye to them
---
Search for people who put in support tickets for lost inventory and Bethesda’s response that they don’t track player inventory. 
---
Maybe it's a PS4 issue...
---
Not post release no. Correcting major features being unusable or worse detrimental should be done pre release.  Promoting a feature and then saying “oops by the way if you  used this feature we promoted you loose hours of i game work.” Is bad business 
---
Dude all the 2 shot explosives are duped. 99.9 percent of them. I garauntee it. 
---
So yes, yes I did. Everyone knows this.  
---
The problem is they said they wouldnt do anything about it and that they would nerf them to fix the issue. 
---
So i spent time and caps to get some. Like almost everyone else. Now they change thier mind and delete them after people spent time to farm caps for them. 
---
If they would have said they would remove them when they fix it, then people would have left them alone, ir bought them cheaply since they knew they would go away. 
---
By leaving them in game, it changed the game, people adapted. People spent time adapting. 
---
Now they are being told they wasted that time. 
---
Either side of the argument has valid points here. I get both sides. The only thing that is obvious is that this is the worst way to handle this. And once again more people are going to run from this game. 
---
I personally think this change isnt that bad. And in the long run its better for the game. Especially with the pvp servers coming. But that still isnt going to change the fact that 10s of thousands of players are going to be pissed that they were forced to use apps to trade because they didnt put player vending in, then when they used them , all thier shit is going to get deleted. These people will quit, and the game will get even more lonely.  Just sucks all around
---
No one knows, except for Bethesda.  Even they seem to not really know, as their statement said that you "MAY" lose these items.
---
You may, you may not.  Flip a coin, see how it comes later.
---
You'll probably lose a few.
---
I for one, hope people do abandon it if they feel the need to exploit the game.  I play here and there with a buddy, we have a great time.  It's almost always other players fucking up the experience for us.  
---
We are both around 25 or 30 in level, and have had the game since shortly after launch.  For the way we play, it's fantastic.  The consumer is the issue in my perspective.
---
I would actually like having to host or get a server outside of the public access to be completely honest.  This would be a great game if it was a small co-op and not a free for all mmo type thing.  Maybe their next installment in the series will be more like that.
---
All this does is bring shitty people together to say shitty things about how shitty their combined experience is.  It's funny in it's own way.
---
Read this slowly and carefully:
---
Yeah.  You say that, but if I want to do that, I can’t pick up the loot dropped by enemies. 
---
It’s (1) a vote of no confidence in Beth executing the operation without irreversible unintended side effects; and (2) the fact that many buyers have no way of knowing if their items were duped.  A TSE shotgun you got for 2k caps?  Yeah that was duped.  What about a bloodied melee weapon you paid 8-10k for?
---
So your statement is not wholly correct.  It’s not about players duping, it’s about non-dupers who have engaged with the only marketplace the game has had to date.
---
Just a bummer to release a game that had so many bugs and then to punish players that used the in-game trading system legitimately. We will see what happens after the patch i guess. :)
---
It’s the same. Slimjim72384
---
Time for melee, hope you kept that all rise.
---
Please explain to me how I can earn 20k caps back in "a day or two"
---
I keep ingame mic on but rarely use it w/o spoken to first. On the other hand all my buddies have mics on and talk ingame. Even tohugh we are in Discord as well. If we are on your server you can probably find us at a camp close to the prime site with a lot of banter over voice. Other players talk every now and then. I try to set up my camp there i nthe hopes peopel will talk/trade more and it seems to be working :)
---
I've had some really good stuff for almost 2 months now. I wonder if that will be touched. I just can't wait to see what I still have left. To see what is legit
---
Jokes on you when he successfully sues and is awarded his pixels back. 
---
Hopefully he posts his GoFundMe page for help on the lawyer's bills.
---
"Cheating" is not the same thing as "trading" or "farming legendaries". Since I don't think they even have IDs on the items they are going to delete (Otherwise they would have helped when you randomly get items from your inventory delete), what they are probably going to do is just delete any item that has TSE or similarly "OP" legendaries from the game, regardless if you duped, bought or farmed them. That means, for me (A lvl 150 that pretty much only farms nuke zones nowadays) and many people like me, effectively losing stuff we did grind for weeks in order to obtain, regardless of their origin. This is moronic in everyone's eyes but OP and the other hardcore fanboys it seems. 
---
Simplejacks will keep downvoting, just disregard it.
---
Cool. Better grab some tissues.
---
Create a new gated zone, with starter quests that basically provide you entry-level items for a power-creeped zone, which will make old-world items obsolete. Similar to how WoW treats expansion packs - old expansion end-game items are roughly equivalent to entry-level quest items and therefore basically worthless with the addition of new content. Nobody will care about old dupes if the new stuff they can get is basically better than the old stuff. Plus you will have new content to boot.
---
Oh no, extra anti-dupe-bitch-flakes for cereal this morning?
---
Me too.  Took me since beta to get a set of weightless marine armor.  Just finished my set 2 days ago. Its super hard to make a set since you cant mix and match other marine armor or it disables your camelion mutation.  
---
Why not just wait and see? Nobody here can answer your questions or concerns... we will all find out later today...
---
Being a Bethesda apologist is a bit of a weird hobby in my opinion.
---
^^^ 1000x this ^^^
---
That's udderly ridiculous.
---
Two shot explosives suck now anyway, the only one I had, a 44 , was so inaccurate because of the bullet split . And 50% of the time it would heal enemies rather than damage them. I gave it to a friend. All I have now is either zealots, anti-armor , or instigating. Being severely antisocial has turned out to be a good thing now, although I accept trade invites , I don't mind selling healing supplies to other players. But I've always had the ( I use what I find mentality) guns I don't want, I drop near other players, guns I want , I keep. So I should be fine . Crossing my fingers hoping they don't mess up and delete my arsenal. 100% self farmed.
---
I have no complaints about their plan, and wouldn't even mind so much if they did a complete server Wipe, and re-launch, but I am concerned about them getting it right.
---
I have lost several good weapons, and a lot of armor to game glitches, and Bethesda claims they have no means to restore the lost items, so if that's true, then how can they delete items.
---
All but two of my weapons is self looted through 500+ hours of gameplay, one I got from a friend who looted it while we were playing together, and one Exp. SG I traded a premium Melee for.
---
I don't believe I have any duplicated items in my inventory, but I have purchased a few 3\* items from Vendors near Blast Zones, and have no way to know their origin.
---
I also have a character with thousands of legitimately crafted Diluted Stimpaks, that could easily be seen as duplicated items, but were crafted using the games own perks system to get 9 (average) from every stimpak.
---
&gt;Anyone have a link? My googlefu is weak and just **comes up with people talking about it on reddit.**
---
Your Googlefu is fine. 
---
No, the time they have to spend fighting all the dupers is the issue, no dupers, then more content can be produced.
---
Say you work there, you do an 8hr shift
---
you spend 6hrs recoding the game to patch duping exploiting, which is against TOS for one, you only get 2 hrs to dedicate to turning your project of new content into reality.
---
So Dupers have really spoiled the game for the gamers as they cant give the gamers what they want.
---
No duping, more time to making new content. Simple..
---
Why would you possibly feel bad for people who cheated? Hopefully they learn a valuable life lesson.
---
not necessarily. you can gather lots of caps by just doing events. and when everyone is offering this stuff for 5k, you don't really question yourself.
---
The ghoul must have picked it up from some dupers who dropped it on the floor. You know like how scorched pick up weapons...GG
---
I’m almost level 50. Went into my first nuke zone last night because I was doing an Enclave quest and had to go to Witesprings anyway. I roll strictly solo, and vanilla scorchbeasts still give me some trouble, so I expect it’ll take me until around level 65-70 before I’m done. After that I’ll probably either restart knowing what I do now, or check out the new Battlefield.
---
But now melee in power armor is the only build that is viable now.
---
Non power armor perks were nerfed, explosives were nerfed, energy is in the gutter, armor breaks way to fast unless it's in power armor, and melee weapons scale very high for some reason. 
---
Just because I didn't produce something important doesn't mean the time was wasted.
---
Ikea team strikes again!
---
Nice, such a well though out reply! Wouldn't expect anything less from people doing these kinds of posts. 
---
The big problem might be getting them out of the hidding once it has been placed there .
---
:::: sultry southern voice::: 
---
these Bethesda democracy’s are tryin to take our guns!
---
😏
---
Got to give it to us.
---
That's how your post reads.
---
That would be a big list of items though. If 30-40 items are removed most won’t complain. If the list is 100s or thousands of items many will complain. 
---
Oh no extra shilling overtime this morning? Everyone who has played since launch and put any kind of considerable amount of time into this game has duped items. Just wait for it. The shilling won't spot the hundreds of rage posts.
---
There's a difference between what the customer service reps can do and what the devs can do ;)
---
have never and would never dupe anything. just play the game.
---
Couldn't have expressed myself any better I think!
---
Fun...
---
I would think that All Rise wouldn’t be a duping target since it’s a guaranteed quest drop. 
---
But also depending on how they’re finding dupes, it might not even be possible to determine which of them are dupes because they are identical already. If they’re searching for identical legendary rolls with identical condition in order to determine what to delete, then finding All Rises that are dupes would be impossible. That may not be how they’re doing it, we just don’t know. 
---
But they’ve said they’re using a “targeted list” of items to delete which, again, All Rise is probably not on. 
---
So three reasons why you should be safe. 
---
And me too. I lost my All Rise and then found one at Watoga a few days later. So I’m in the same situation as you. 
---
They wont. Most of them took money from less fortunate people. Many did give away a lot of stuff. But in the end they are going to make it seem like legit stuff disappeared. 
---
Well caps do hold value because of npc vendors but you bring up a good point about trading. 
---
Did you buy them off reddit traders or did you grind for them? 
---
Get back to me after you've read the posts on this page.
---
Yeah but I bought mine yesterday after the news that dupes are being purged was announced. Let's see if its there when I log in.
---
Why not just reset the game then? Start over with reclamation day. 
---
You can't even provide two or three solid examples of "lies" beyond the one I mentioned, can you?
---
I too am disappointed in Bethesda, but that's different from them explicitly "lying". I can make a bunch of things that they did that piss me off, like the last patch being a mess, but those still aren't lies.
---
It's ok, you can't back up your statement because there is no real data behind it, I get it.
---
Would if I hadn't just gone to bed lol
---
so it comes from a lack of understanding that bethesda's support/feedback site is not an actual dedicated game support?
---
Nah. It’ll remove all duped gear plus random bits of gear that were legit. Expect around 124% duped gear removal. 
---
Thank you! :D
---
PLEASE . DON'T . BRING . HEAVY . BOBBY . PINS. BACK
---
I'm in the same predicament I have 2 TSE that I bought but I don't think they are going to be able to track them. I think because the limit they out in place to stop people being massively over encumbered didn't work because they just made more mule characters they are now instead just checking inventorys and stashes to see who has multiple identical weapons (duped) and deleting those so I think people like me and you who potentially have a duped weapon due to purchasing from other players should be okay. I hope this settles your mind a bit but this is just my theory based on what I have heard from Bethesda.
---
Ahhh nightmare. Another time maybe. Enjoy a good sleep. 
---
I don’t. Played since beta. Haven’t taken a single weapon or armour from another player. Haven’t duped a single item myself. 320+ hours. Bring on the cleanse.
---
Those dangerous TSE Explosive guns are not beign Deleted; its just the brotherhood of steel securing dangerous technology from the hands of Bad Kids that dont deserve them...
---
You have to accept that dear enclave members
---
Lol you mad. I got a shop of stuff I farmed myself if you need to look for a replacement. PS4 though. Some of the stuff may disappear though, but only a few. Updating later today
---
same! Thanks for help anyway even if i knew this method :P
---
And then sometimes you get days like I got yesterday, where I got a Two-Star Vampiric Laser Gatling (+10% damage while aiming), Vampiric Gatling Gun (My main weapon of choice), a bloodied baseball bat, and a ghoul slayer baseball bat (great for just clearing through whitesprings. One shotting every ghoul makes farming super easy)
---
This is true
---
I had fun with those toys, no thanks to Bethesda. I have new toys to play with, like Resident Evil 2, and For Honor (Free this month with Playstation Plus), and The Division 2 will be coming soon. 
---
And? It's a short, vague statement that briefly touches on what they're doing today. Last I checked, they don't have to tell you everything about what's going on. 
---
Yelling "IT JUST WORKS"
---
Have you traded? Have you bought legendaries off a vendor? Because if so then you do have something to lose.
---
I bought a couple of TSE weapons on a vendro awhile back, before I knew about the duping, even tho they are my fav weapons, I would gladly say goodbye to them to get this shitshow fixed.
---
Spoiler alert it is. 
---
I might suggest re-rolling.
---
Maybe its time for a PC?
---
What are you fixing server side? What specific items are you talking about? Roughly how many items will you be deleting? There are a lot of questions you can ask about that statement. There are no patch notes. Just that brief, vague statement.
---
Haha I enjoyed that. Thanks!
---
And how many good, legit items did we git rid of - trade or sell because our favorite that was traded or bought from a vendor, was unknowingly a duped item?  I have passed along many good legendaries farmed the hard way because I already had a couple of favorite go-to weapons. 
---
Sadly, the real-world analog to this is police seizing stolen items bought by a 3rd party, who didn't know they are stolen. Pawn shops often get theft reports from the police with item serial numbers. Those suspicious a pawn shop "bargains" might go eBay or Craig's list, yet items from them can also be stolen. You just don't know anymore, unless you buy retail...
---
So when my favorite 2\* explosive Gatling gun, that I traded up for a month or so ago disappears, I will never know it it was actually a duped item or just one flagged as commonly duped. At least when the police take stuff you bought they give you the stolen serial numbers... 
---
I do this pretty much in every session.
---
I find a low level camp,join the squad and upgrade their camp with a cool bed,instruments and a cooking stove.
---
If that were the only impact you may be right. 
---
But it also puts nearly everyone (certainly casual players, the largest group) without duped items at a disadvantage in both pvp and pve. (The pay to win argument)
---
Turning off new and casual players is the biggest threat to the health of the game long term.
---
Super going to do this. 
---
The amount of censorship people want in this sub is ridiculous.
---
Oh noooooo, please don't criticize Bethesda. This was all just a big misunderstanding and they didnt try to fuck their fanbase over for a quick buck, you're just a big complainer!!!!
---
Well the game will be fair again
---
No I think you’re in the minority.. most of use aren’t duper’s.. if we were all dupers the servers would be down permanently.. and wtf are you talking about ‘destruction’???? It’s a fucking video game! Get a life!
---
Mic is immersion breaking. I want the space Marine next to me to speak in the voice of the god empeor, or just type.  When I find out the man that just saved my life is a 9 year old boy it ruins the feel of the game.   I hate mic unless I'm doing something competitive and team based. 
---
Yep I'll take a Nuka Cola and popcorn.
---
I'm looking at it this way, if I lose my TSE lever action because the guy that gave it to me duped it, then I lose it. I'll just go back to farming for another one. 
---
*Pulls up a chair and gets comfortable and waits for the shitstorm to hit* 
---
&gt;Either way, I'm OK with the outcome. 
---
people keep saying this, forgetting that this is an online game for better or worse and needs players to keep the servers up.
---
and pulling stunts like this is a great way to lose players. it's not particularly crowded in here as it is.
---
I like what you said about the duped items being a red herring.  In the end, it affects those not involved very little for the reasons I stated in my post and you also reiterated in yours.  The fact of the matter is that duping is of very little consequence beyond the server instability at this point.  The game still has other very significant issues.
---
Be careful I posted about this and was reported for witch hunting by a user who bragged about it in my comments. Dupers don't like it when you call them out and will remove your post. Hopefully the mods can remove this toxic user from the sub when I contact them.
---
Played for the content and it wasn't there. Stayed for the loot hoping the content would come. Played for weeks thinking it would get better, and it is in certain ways it is (bug fixes, duped item removal, SBQ changes) but on the whole it's rather lacking and I'm not confident enough people will stick around to make the next content patch matter.
---
The game devolved into an open trader market for me rather than an immersive post-apocalyptic rpg. I've already played through the content, and I don't want to farm WS endlessly to gain loot that in all likelihood will be obsolete when the next content patch kicks in. So I guess I answered my own question - I just won't play until new content is out.
---
Also think about all those ppl that left having a original tse
---
thanks man, i appreciate it, it does have me pretty bummed
---
Maybe.  It was the only one on a vendor, it was before TSE got nerfed so the fact it was anti armor may have meant it wasn't good enough to keep as a drop as people just cared about TSE.
---
But if all the other duped items are gone, I'm okay with that.
---
they do know what they are doing im preety sure coding is alot more complicated becauce what your post is implying is that Bethesda doesn't know how to code, which they do and they know alot more than you do
---
in fact, im preety sure i heard some where once that coding doesn't always fix the problem. the first time that in fact that patching could happen multiple times before it being successful.
---
Perfectly said.

Good. I look forward to you leaving an edited comment on this post then.
---
Purge! Burn it all down! 
---
"Ut a chao"
---
Whenever you make a support ticket about disappearing items they say they don't have the tools to track items.
---
The Flatwoods vendor bot was overflowing with Anti-Armor weapons this morning, multiples of each one. 
---
Hmm could be....maybe it was deliberate after all xD
---
I honestly don't get what you're saying. First you're saying that collecting that many caps is not a big deal;  10min/day max. Now you're saying that it's a big deal and if you aren't refunded those caps from a trade that may have been with a duper that's a deal breaker? At least be consistent. 
---
And I am one of the casuals I mentioned. I haven't done any trading, no grinding, no server hopping, no nuking Whitesprings over and over again. Just played the game at my pace. The only thing I've done, that I think most casuals haven't, is frequented this sub. 
---
This!
---
An item can be traded by a duper to a player, who trades to someone else, who trades to someone else.. and five trades down the line it ends up in some unsuspecting person’s inventory who is just excited to finally have that item they’ve been looking for. They have no idea it was duped into existence.
---
Or someone buys an item at Watoga or Whitesprings after a nuke, thinking someone sold it after getting it there. Nope, a duper placed it there purposefully.
---
People are going to suffer for this who don’t dupe. And don’t forget about people who don’t even visit forums/Reddit and may not even know what duping IS.
---
We dont need the negative players
---
So, how is this thread helpful to the cause?
---
This is karma fishing, nothing more.
---
Yep.
---
It's increasingly rare to see anyone from my Friends list playing this game lately.  Most have moved on from it entirely.
---
Most people with duped items aren't dupers either. Idiot.
---
That's my thinking also. Old duped stuff will be fine but more recent stuff will disappear. 
---
Even if it works properly, it's going to suck because some people are going to lose awesome weapons that they spent their hard-earned caps on.  Some reaction is expected, I personally think some people are taking it too far but that's open to interpretation.
---
I myself will probably lose 4 or 5 good weapons, I'm not naive enough to think my god roll 2H and TSE that I bought off others were true drops.  But I understand why they will have to be removed.
---
Anywhere there is even a hint of a mention of fixing duping exploits?
---
It will not.  2 shot is garbage now, all of mine were legit, and I dropped them in a bag in the bottom of toxic water. I'm all about anti armor now. I would never expect them to un - nerf anything. Far too prideful to do that.
---
I believe many people( myself included) are more so upset with Bethesdas handling of the situation. The duping and surplus of TSE weapons was an issue, but was addressed far to late. Due to their sluggish response times and lack of transparency players made best of what was there. They should have just banded everyone who was massively overweight and clearly duping months ago instead of letting the issues compound and trickle down to the masses (seriously doubt it's as low a percentage as they say). People like myself are worried because we dont have faith in a company we have been patrons of for over ten years. If they were quick and forthcoming in their actions then players would have had the appropriate time to act accordingly.(By that I'm mean not buy weapons for player vendors, save lvl ups so you can adjust for the patch, etc... not drop your millions of duped Kilograms) 
---
Those are my qualms. Ive only ever had 1 character who's a lvl 100+. Also highly concerned I will lose my second All Rise that I acquired from the SDM( have photo proof). 
---
As you've said, we can't know that.  Another person made the point of looking at the amount of buyers in relation to remaining players and not total accounts as well.  Again, I hope you're right.  I just feel bad for those that spent extra money outside the game to try to make the game more enjoyable who are about to lose that money.
---
No. CS wants you to think it's impossible. 
---
Yeah but I think they shouldn't remove duped items and instead full characters if they find duped items or maybe even accounts.
---

Morrowind - released in 2002.

A 15 year old bug! Fucking priceless (and so Bethesda)...
---
Yeah weird thing is I had my alt come across the mission first and there wasn’t a problem, so I decided to do it with my main cuz I would be able to finish it much faster. Since I’ve been stuck I try again every other play session or when I’m near sugar grove.

hahahha

Fallout 76 needs all the fucking players it can get... What drugs are you on? 
---
*Dev: Alright, guys. First, we will nerf the TSE since it has been duped so many times and the demolition perk too so there is no reason for you to use mini nukes and missile launchers. Next, we are going to remove all the duped items, not sure why we are doing that since TSE is so useless now and bobbleheads no longer stacks. After that, we will  take a few more months to develop a system to ban all dupers for good. I mean the community prefers us to work on this rather than new content, right?*
---
Xbox
---
Maybe I missed something but I didn't read anywhere that they are deleting tses or traded weapons just duped items. So if you spent that money and your items are duped, I believe that is going. The weapon u found shouldn't be an issue.
---
But then again it's bgs. Their patch plans rarely ever survive first contact with deployment. 
---
Uh it doesn’t go away till I Fast travel or relog and once I get in PA it happens again lol
---
Agreed...  I've played several MMOs that will restore items.  I've even played some that would restore items I lost because I did something stupid.
---
That is true, but it would get you out of a pinch.
---
Are you a PC user?
---
If so I have 100 stimpacks with your name on them after the game comes online again!
---
We dont need the cheaters and people getting mad over this post 
---
I am not saying that this wont suck for those who bought duped items at full price. What I am saying is that if you found a TSE In a bag in train station or bought it from an other user at WAY below market price and then said "What he didnt tell me it was duped!" you are fooling yourself. 
---
Some people had like 400k of it and weren't eating food. Just soda and candy.
---
Nope
---
I played for about 15 hours or so over a few days shortly after release. I can see why duping is a thing. 
---
r/filthycasuals
---
Try there.
---
I would just love to switch weapons or the scope to go away after release L2 when mobbed. When the mob runs up on you best hope your holding the weapon you want and not needing to access pip boy or it lags you to death. 
---
well fuckity fuck fuck that sucks
---
Im actually excited to see if some of my weapons will be gone. Then i finally know if the players have lied to me or not.

Yeah fuck it. I'm not too arsed I've got some caps saved up to buy legit replacements if my stash gets pillaged. 
---
This may need an intervention, like an episode of "Hoarders". You can do it, 600 is enough to be a slight struggle, forcing you to make difficult decisions like, "damn that flaming chainsaw is coold, but it's not 12 lbs cool". 
---
Just my $0.02.
---
I did actually try that, also tried using other tapes in the sugar grove terminal to see if anything worked and they all did exempt that “silco holotape”.
---
Also I did this event on my alt, but not that I wanted to do it on my main to get the completion and loot I’m having problems.
---
Sigh.

I don't need you to tell me how complicated coding is.  I have been writing code longer than the average Redditor has been alive.  I know it's complicated.  I know that shit happens.
---
If they're aiming for any kind of successful pvp styled game theyll have to continually make balance changes. I dont think they would either but it would be nice. 
---
LOL! I will give him all the digital apologies for all they are worth!
---
Didn’t say we were a hive mind. I said at least a small group of people will complain. You can’t make everyone happy.  And I saw plenty of people bitching about the actual TSE nerf when the guns they chased *because* they were OP got nerfed. Ya it sucks for launcher builds, but they’ve already said that they’re looking into buffing heavies and energy weapons. Every buff or nerf will bring new problems, it happens in almost every other online game I’ve played when balancing.
---
If removing items causes enough people to leave there will be no economy anyways
---
I enjoy 76, but they definitely half-assed it. I don't feel sorry for them.
---
Like in FO4 with little patches for each faction would be grand!
---
You don't give a fuck about anyone but yourself.
---
Quit pretending. 
---
Dupers and those that engaged them are the ones ruining the game and putting longevity at risk, not legitimate players.

Let's not over simplify it. It's potential PvP for your death bag if it gets taken. Not just "PvP for junk" 
---
Yes, Bethesda. Our FO76 Theme Song for stash space is "Never Enough" from The Greatest Showman
---
This is a good point.  The super weapons wreaked enough havoc that they had to nerf them.  Given the extreme RNG of this game, one is left to wonder from where did all these weapons come.
---
To have a in game economy you must have a action house/exchange of some sort. This game lacks that. There is no way to meet people online. If you want to do legit trades you practically have to meet somewhere else first. Not much of a in game economy. 
---
Don't get me wrong, If they pull this off without making it into a charlie foxtrot it will be the best thing that has happened for this game but ill believe it when I see it. 
---
I have looted &amp; sold 2 TSE Ultracite Laser Pistols/Rifles, a 2\* and a 3\*, so I would say a lot in the game could be legit.
---
I have also gotten 2 TSE Handmades, a level 35, &amp; a level 45, I am hopeful that they truly have a method to determine duplicates from the original, but wouldn't mind seeing even the originals that had been duplicated removed.
---
I have made reasonable efforts to avoid selling items that would be considered good by dupers, to anyone that I thought may be involved with Duping, and have turned down huge offers for some because of that.
---
(Spits drink in laughter)
---
they aren't removing them. They are just removing duplicated ones. The nerf was needed for over all balance in the game. 
---
I agree to your first part but disagree on your second. 
---
As games like WoW and LoL hsve shown, keeping the dedicated player base and 'whales' happy is much more financially important than trying to capture new players and keep casual players. 
---
Only hardcore players and whales will buy atoms. This game needs to pivot to their needs, if it wants to last more than a year. 
---
Measure the 360 distance with a ruler.
---
For instance, if it takes 5in to do a 360 in siege, I should change FO76 to match that 
---
Let the drinking game begin 
---
Me too!
---
The best will come when the game comes back online. 
---
You missed all those posts about people being innocent and getting banned, a few weeks ago? In fact Bethesda had to come out and say all these people were lying and that they did cheat. 
---
I ran into two morons doing the One Violent Night event, after it was over they just started attacking me. I was lvl 86 and one was 90 something while the other was 48, I think. I just kept walking away as they attacked me, ended up being disconnected from the server. Haven't seen them since.
---
You sound like an expert could you explain further?
---
then you should understand the situation instead of guessing
---
Ahh, gotcha. How will Bethesda know what items were obtained using a glitch? What if I collected and used specific resources to make a crap ton of a single item? 
---
Is this why people are say that a lot of mysterious things are going to go missing from their STASH?
---
Thank you so much for posting this. Some people really need to see this. 
---
Ahh the self-righteous appear..
---
Not even going to point out the various flaws in the logic, but will point out one scenario that should be the most obvious..
---
Dupers could have sold to vendors, and then someone buys from the vendor the item.  How is that fair to remove the item from the player in the end?
---
Very well said! I feel exactly the same and am here to enjoy not exploit or cheat the system...While things should have been done at the start and could have been better, it is what it is. 
---
If they spent time developing the game before launch they wouldn't have to fight dupers.
---
"Pillaged" makes me think of all these griefers with duped weapons who are like "Rawr, we're RAIDERS, deal with it!"
---
Well, here comes the biggest, baddest Raider of them all, and now look who is throwing a hissy-fit about it. 😂
---
I think the criticism this sub gives for the last update is a little excessive.  It was certainly annoying to have fixes rolled back, but the reason it happened isn't really far-fetched or otherwise indicative of any deep level of incompetence.
---
Like any sensible developer, Bethesda uses version control so that they can go track and compare code changes across updates.  Whoever was in charge of compiling the last patch build accidentally pulled from the incorrect version. 
---
It's a mistake I'm sure every developer has or will have at some point done. I know in my own (much smaller scale) projects it's happened.  It's annoying and you feel like an idiot for doing it but the fix is as simple as just pushing an update based on the 'right' code.  
---
thanks! and hahaha not on purpose really. the green hair was because i have green hair irl, and then the clown makeup was because i wanted her to be a juggalo. then i slapped the forehead tattoo on to try to make her less joker-y but i don’t think it worked 
---
You can nuke various places. You can decide you want a certain item, like a pink asylum outfit, and spend hours server hopping trying to get it.
---
There really isn't much of an end game currently.
---
&gt;There is literally nothing left to do but try to build caps, kill legendaries for a unicorn drop, or buy/trade for items you actually want but can not get to drop because of the lackluster loot system.
---
Well said. I have been feeling depressed lately because I want to keep enjoying this game, yet it has turned into an empty grind. The most fun I had recently was nuking VaultTech solo, then chasing hundreds of glowing green ones - only mid 40's level but still fun and challenging. I stayed there from the time the nuke fell until the rad zone cleared and the sun came out. Died a few times even. I only found a couple of legendaries, nearly all were junk like 1 star  wooden vanguard leg armor, but it was still fun to hunt and fight so many baddies...
---
I hope that after this latest round of "fixes" we can get onto the task of improving the game play experience. I want so much to keep enjoying this game but lately it is getting very hard to keep the faith...
---
Because the loot drops are worse than Diablo III, meaning you pretty much have to trade to get great items.
---
Do you think items dropped in a bag and another player picked up would register the same as a PvP trade? Or is an item traceable back to its origins? 
---
I would be too. But a limited reset that primarily effects players who decided to be traders is going to be problematic.

We’re planning to bring Fallout 76 offline for maintenance around **9:00 a.m. EST on February 14**, and anticipate that downtime will last several hours. During this time, we’re planning to remove items that have been created through duplication exploits from player inventories and stashes.
---
These item removals are part of our ongoing efforts to address exploit abuse and make positive changes for the overall in-game economy. These removals are highly-targeted at a specific list of items. Players who have used an exploit to dupe items, **or acquired duped items from other players**, may find those items removed from their accounts once maintenance is complete. It’s also important to note that only a small percentage of accounts currently have duped items, which means the vast majority of players will not be affected by this action.
---
Additionally, during downtime, we’re going to roll out a server-side fix to reduce the frequency that players might experience disconnects from game servers.
---
We’ll post a follow-up thread with more details once tomorrow’s maintenance is complete.
---
Sounds like all duped items to me. 
---
Lol. They don't have to put it in there man. It's not required they tell you they're gonna fix an exploit server side. 
---
Tell them we deleting their duped ass shit. While they're crying about it, we will implement a server side patch that fixes the time roll back on a crash so all these little shits waste there time when they log back in trying to dupe. On top of that, we an implement this little tracker and ban the little assholes trying. 
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ but hey, what do I know. I'm just some old dude that plays video games. 
---
Am i , i honesty dont know? So far i have only gotten heavy variants, except for the ones that dont have a heavy variant.
---
Yeah, I can understand people thinking it's more noble to grind your own stuff but I don't see how it is moronic to spend $10 extra to have two amazing weapons when you've already dropped $60 on the game to begin with.
---
So will they finally fix energy, heavy, and explosive weapons or is it just waiting 3 weeks for nerfs and another 3 weeks for nerfs, etc. etc. Or some new content? Anything good?
---
Very well said!
---
Do you also wear the tinfoil hat in game?
---
Right there with you on this one.... Cant wait until the servers come back up.
---
Inflation. It’s a bitch. 
---
They're probably finding entries that should be unique in the database and aren't and subsequently deleting all of the entries 
---
I played over 500 hours and have multiple characters. Fallout 76 is fun yes. But it has/had issues. admittedly I might play a bit too much from time to time, but putting that much time into a game makes you encounter a variety of bugs/issues(and ofc fun unique scenarios aswell :) ). So the the fact of hating a player with over X amount of hours for saying stuff about the game or Bethesda baffles me.
---
Yes, some people just blindly rant no matter the amount of in game time. But there are enough that have thought about the stuff they are encountering. It is not always a "Give more stash plz" post or opinion. I don not voice all my concerns about the game because soem ar epointless and ranty. But I feel you have to realize people with that amount of hours will have some valid arguments. Atleast if it's not just another person hating out of frustration or because it's "the general opinion"
---
That being said no matter the game I hate jaded mindsets and people that are negative no matter what or the typical one uppers. Those people are here aswell, but more on the reddit than ingame I believe. Also I've had time were 76 screwed me over multiple times. You have to realize if someone is working to a long term goal in game and it gets denied/deleted by bugs or exploiting players you WILL get a bit pissed. It's a time investment for some bigger than others. Either defined by the total amount of time or their lack of beign able to play because work etc.. This will lead to frustration and most liely the person being ranty/negative either ingame or on sites. I have had several instances where I lost so much. Id it weren't for the people I play with I would be gone a long time ago. 
---
It is kinda fun. 
---
I hope so, there’s no telling with this game. Ever since I started playing all they’ve been doing is trying to fix their completely broken game with no fun dlc in sight and if half my inventory gets wiped I’m gone
---
If people followed the rules and didn't even try to dupe for money etc, then it have been a better place.
---
Stolen Loot is Stolen Loot.
---
Ignorance is no excuse.
---
You'd be surprised whats in the TOS if you read them all.
---
extra salt??   ;)
---
You and me both bro, people see my armor and drop shit to me because they feel sorry for me. 
---
I was kind of gutted that they didn't reset people to reclamation day after we'd played the beta, it would have been nice to have the whole playerbase start at the same time
---
Not nearly enough, IMO.
---
Just block him or something 
---
I tried to play fallout 4 but the chemistry just isn’t there
---
I picked one up this morning, and I believe i have the "Flaming Bow Bar" Mod as well, if you're on XB1 message me &amp; I'll make you a great deal.
---
Because the items never should have existed in the first place.
---
I don't care. If you lose items, they weren't real, get over it.
---
Have you ever played an online game? There is constantly nerving and buffing gear. Im happy for the nerf, 1 shotting stuff is OP and needed to get balanced 
---
" may find those items removed from their accounts"
---
Their wording indicates they're not even sure what would be removed.
---
They should have them removed ASAP, after the dupe glitch was found. Now they have been in the econemy for too long an people bought them with there legit farmed caps. The dupers keep the caps, the fair players get the there stuff taken away.
---
And everyone whos not constantly hanging around on reddit probably didnt even know about duping and just bought one of these things, using a feature Bethesda themself implemented: Trading.
---
So lots of innocent people will get ripped off, while all the dupers who made profit from the glitch can live happily with there caps.
---
This I can respect. I thought you came in expecting a Diablo style "It's all about the loot". I play slowly so Still have like 2/5ths of the map to explore and I'm only on the Free States portion of the story.
---
But what do you think can be done to delete all duped items without discouraging future trade? Or do you think they need to? After nerfing 2 Shot and Explosive into the ground, do you think they need to remove items. That category was the most notorious. 
---
And there's the fact if they just released some new content, they could make the old legendaries obsolete with something new to work towards anyway. This is probably what you're referring to. I'll stop talking now.  
---
If they're saving the information they would be able to tell what server it was on when it was dropped and picked up, so they could easily tell that it was "traded"
---
They said this would be a lengthy downtime, but still probably can only check a limited list of items.  The worst part might be not knowing if they are going to target other items in the future, so we don't know what will be safe to trade for.
---
BTW - I've seen your posts offering PA crafting services and am hoping to catch you on the next one.  I'm saving my Fuzzy tokens for you :).
---
Have an upvote for truth
---
&gt; There is no way to seek or promote trades 
---
Debatable. I had my own app made to sell thing, to make my life and consumers life easier. I knew where people were trading, what they were searching and with what prices items were sold. 1400 cap from vendors aint much, but that what made you go out and sell thing to other players, socialize and not be robots who have full camp set up purifiers and then sell water to vendors. Simple items went 100 caps per effect, more advanced items with 1 star or two went for 1-2k. Total garbage items were sold to vendors. There definitely is a way to seek and promote trades, it was up to ingenuity of player how he would do that.
---
I keep seeing that the references are from modders/programmers who describe it as a limitation in the engine, but I'm too lazy to lmmake sure it's true.
---
I personally give it about a 35% chance of success. I want to feel optimistic that Bethesda has thought this through and has done their homework. 
---
I’ll come back just to hunt your camp down. See you in the wasteland 
---
I've never actually find him to confirm. Good to know.
---
Just who I am. I come off stronger than I mean too, but I'm a useful guy to know.
---
I agree, I’ve never even hit the limit and I’ve been playing since launch . People are never happy
---
'Go play CS:GO if you want to cheat, F76 is not a competition.'
---
You do realize how stupid that argument is, do you?
---
There are like a few fairly big subs and discord servers that serve as an auction house quite well...
---
Nice, you really don't have anything to worry about. I've bought a bunch of weapons and armor off the reddit trading sub. Really worried about losing my stuff.
---
sorry, I couldn't find the TL;DR? can you show me where it is?
---
I love the conspiracy theory that spawned from it. Basically people think the devs who actually put love and effort into the game are so sick of managements shit that now they are simply doing malicious compliance on every instruction. As a developer myself, this game definitely seems like agile gone wrong.
---
I understand perfectly.  Have you not been paying attention?  Have you not seen how their last couple of patches have introduced unintended problems, and brought back problems that were supposedly fixed?  Do you think they're making those mistakes on purpose?  If not, then the alternative is that they didn't know what their code would do before they made it live.  The mistakes were either intentional or not.  There is no third option here.  And if the mistakes are a pattern from them, then that would lead one to extrapolate that future work from them could have unpredictable results.
---
So you're asking for more information, and I'm telling you that their track records shows that they don't understand the changes that they're making.  They can't give you accurate information because they don't thoroughly vet all of their changes before pushing them out.
---
It was just a quick thing done out of curiosity, hence why I wasn't super thorough with the width etc... but thanks for the feedback!
---
&gt; As a new player its good to know what perks to look forward to as I rank up
---
Arguably all red and cyan perks that are not framed are "not interesting", in that they just increase your stats but don't give any visible effect. They can be good and efficient but they are "silent" :-)
---
Fine, make a list and do it every maintenance.  Can't be that many instances to handle every week? 
---
Suppose they had released the gam actually stable and not in an incomplete state. Then we could play and actually get content, that we paid for. 
---
I'm so legit confused by this whole conversation. 
---
No matter what, people will riot. Stomp their digital feet, lie about unfair banning or impacts to their accounts. Idk how they plan to address it and it may be impacted by what they can do. No matter what, digital egos will be flexed. 
---
Then what would be the difference? You would separate the servers which I'm ok with but would still have to start over. I'm not saying its a great idea but its unfortunately a feasible idea. If they introduced new content, and NPCs I think people would be less mad at a entire game wipe. It would also give them a chance to fully take out any of the problem perks and weapons that they are having a hard time with. 
---
Naw this is a fallout sub, I only get downvotes by sweaty neck beards for spewing truth 
---
I'll take some popcorn - no salt, though. The tears of Dupers will be sufficient.
---
Damn, I've dump in a trash can near watoga
---
THEY SHOULD GET RID OF IT ALL, SET A PRECEDENT. 
---
I did miss that, actually.
---
Copy the link and change "reddit" to "removeddit" 
---
got it today
---
I have the Nuka Skin plans but prefer the blue and gold Vault Tec. 5k sounds about right granted the foster of the plans and the time it takes collecting and crafting.
---
With the Targeting HUD on the helm I think I can get takers for 6k on this sweet PA set.
---
&gt;I said two or three and you use the bag, which has nothing to do with the game and they corrected. Good job. Try finding two or three examples actually related to the game.. I dare you :)
---
&gt;If you think the same team that put together the merch bundles is responsible for technical announcements about the game, your logic is even worse than I thought.
---
why bother? I have the status quo on my side. the bag is a perfectly fine example that you're ignoring because it doesn't meet your own specific criteria. I'm gonna follow you around while you move your goalpost.
---
I said Bethesda as a company lies. which is a fact. proof, the bag. regardless of whether they "fixed" it, they still lied about it. it may not be *in* the game but it still proves they lied. "tell me sweet little lies" is a thing for a reason.
---
&gt;You haven't provided any actual numbers, only assumptions based on flawed observations using irrelevant data sets (YouTubers).
---
except you're completely ignoring the second point I made. say you want to roll a specific legendary 3\* ranged weapon. the chances are 1 in 23 for the prefix, 1 in 7 for the major mod and 1 in 9 for the minor mod. around 1 in 50 for the weapon type.
---
not accounting for everything else, like a legendary not dropping an item, not being 3\*, etc., which *decreases* your chances, the odds are **0.04347** \* **0.14285** \* **0.11111** \* **0.02** = **0.00001%**
---
so it'd be a probability anomaly that every person I come across has god rolls. except that's exactly what happens.
---
duped items have the same identifiers as each other in regards to weapons, so its rather easy to delete a pool of duplicate items, also its not going to be 5 of the item, it will have to meet a threshold to be classed as a duped item but yeah if someone has 20 of the same gun in their inventory or stash with all the same identifier.... kiss it goodbye... even the original because it has the same number... I am just sitting laughing and waiting for spam on reddit and the sub count on reddit to plummet. 
---
I got a 3 star bloody ripper that does 6 damage and I was really excited until I couldn’t kill anything with it. 
---
You're acting like Bethesda has taken something from you when in reality it's been your choice to waste that time. There is no "not wasting time" playing the game. IT'S A GAME. 
---
There were a lot bans that were actually indefinite suspensions because characters had literally tons of stuff on their characters.
---
Cleaning up the characters and letting those players back in with a lot of server side monitoring does make sense.
---
It will let you know if you have duping under control quickly. 
---
And now that they have the tech to identify and wipe inventories based on conditions would be fairly safe as well.
---
Maybe more Jared Leto Joker with the tat 😆
---
Have fun in denial-land.
---
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this thread! I had a good laugh reading the comments. Even if Todd and the boys screw everything up with this so called ”purge” i’ll still play FO76. I have a solid hate/love for it, kind of like a threelegged dog. Sure he’s gimpy but he is loyal 😉😁
---
Yeah like I said. BS. They still were involved somehow.   
---
Here's the difference: I wouldn't have to start over. I'm not saying eliminate the current set up. I'm saying create more, and for people who want purely PVP or PVE, they can start new characters on those servers.
---
I would actually support just resetting the economy.  They could easily just wipe all the caps and items, rest everyone's perk points so we can reassign them, and let us go on from there.  That would not only remove the dupes, but the caps that we made from them.  I think even more importantly, it would give everyone a chance to re-spec their character to suit whatever the new meta is going to be.
---
My point is that they might not be able to. With how the creation engine works at its core tracking by item id wasn't possible. Bethesdas support indicates that level of individual save editing isn't possible either. So it will be interesting to see what happens. 
---
Heck I could be wrong, but the wording here is interesting. Considering the amount of duped items that seemingly have spread around. For them to say not many people have duped items was interesting.
---
Lol I’ve never been about exploits. I like the thrill of the hunt of finding my own loot. I remember how duped items killed fantasy star online. It sucked!
---
Im glad about duped items getting erased but i feel bad for people that bought 1 and not knowing it was duped
---
*Players attempting to dupe items will dupe themselves instead, resulting in a small army of pseudo players following them everywhere and spamming them with trade requests.*
---
I died laughing when I pictured this in my head... Just a question, would other players perhaps see this small army? Cause if so, I would love to get a few pictures of this. Lmao!
---
I'Ll jUsT cOmE bAcK tO hUnT yOuR cAmP dOwN. SeE yOu In tHe wAsTeLaNd.
---
Without your dupes too. Hah.
---
This. Absolutely! It’s like people want this game to be a sandbox with unlimited resources and crafting. (Don’t get me wrong, that would be cool, Bethesda) but it’s just not fit for a survival game. For now, fallout Minecraft mods are your best bet
---
You’re very optimistic that all duped items will be removed. Highly unlikely, will just be stacked items in certain accounts I’m afraid. Duping will always exist because it’s an online game 
---
Exactly.  *May*.
---
They're either:
---
1) Not sure
---
2) Playing their cards close to the vest so that the dupers don't prepare in some way
---
3) Writing poorly-worded releases without necessary clarity
---
4) Choosing their words carefully so as not to make any definite statements which end up being incorrect due to poor execution or unforeseen circumstances
---
5) ?  Can't think of another option off the top of my head
---
I’m 90% sure all my guns are duped.so there’s that. Wish there was a way to get rid of duper’s without removing all the innocent people’s guns.
---
the real question is what would you have blasted him with?
---
Proof that they have the same identifiers? That isn't how this engine worked in previous iterations.
---
"Small percentage"
---
Does this include everyone who has ever played?
---
What is small?
---
I use an anti armor 50. Cal with stabilized , also a pair of gating guns , one is zealots, the other executioner, I turn sb to dust. 
---
Thanks man, yea it wasnt easy, and after this patch it's going to get even harder...
---
Fans: We want new content! Not fixing bugs and duping for half a year!
---
Yeah, Bethesda setting price limits would be shitty as hell. What metrics would they use for such a decision &amp; would they be clear about it, or just do it with no proper explanation? People will bitch either way, but is seems to me that this would just as likely “hurt” the economy in the same way all the other Beth set cap related limits do. 
---
&gt;what do I know
---
Exactly my point. Not much.
---
Ofc they couldn't, otherwise, why the f#ck would they wait 2 months to remove duped items. And last patch they made people to drop items if they had too many items. Why spend time coming up with something like that, when you could have just removed those items.
---
even worse, lmao
---
Or maybe a lot longer - if you work full time and have friends you want to hang out with  (not trying to offend Or trying to say you guys have none)... I had the game 1 Week after release and just got lvl 50 just saying. And when im gaming im not exploiting the game as you seem to do. I really like taking my time with this kinda games. I never dropped a good weapon for my melee build so i was very happy when i traded one and yes i would be pissed when bethesda would taketh away- nothing you can do about it
---
They have a list of items.  Only a small number of accounts have those items.  Duped or otherwise, those items will go bye bye.  If you got a god roll item and it fits into the items that others have duplicated, its likely toast.  By small percentage they mean the entire list of players - I bet even those players with lvl 100+ characters in game are a small percentage.
---
i don't thinks so.
---
Your friend could have literally logged off, hopped servers, stop trying to kill them over and over and over. People are such babies now holy shit.
---
Two WHOLE SETS OF POWER ARMOR? Go play ark, become part of a mega tribe, then wake up to literally tens of thousands of hours of work destroyed just because another tribe wanted to. 
---
It's how the world works, video games aren't your safe space.
---
But seriously your friend griefed himself by staying on that server and going back over and over
---
Yeah, but who really cares.  If they have to cheat to stay interested in a game in this bad a shape, I say let them until they dont need to.  It mostly doesn't affect other players.
---
even if that's the case, it doesn't mean I'm wrong. dupers have less of a negative effect on the playercount than unpopular measures from the dev team.
---
seriously, how many people are anal enough to drop the game because people are duping? a few hundred at most? but how many people will be salty enough that their stuff is gone to move on to Apex Legends or whatever fotm?
---
if you need a hint, just look at the effect the TSE nerf had on the playerbase. Whitesprings is deader than ever since then.
---
I am level 176 and I like to frequent the common areas and put starter-item stuff in containers. Dump a bunch of food/meds/ammo/value resources hoping a n00b player might find them and have that "motherlode" experience. In fact, I wish they had a gift gesture instead of just waving "Hi" and "Follow me" to try and point them to the gift basket.
---
Honestly, some days I just grind for useful consumables only to gift them all to random players. Makes me feel good, and fills some time wince there is little less to do after all these game play balances. 
---
It’s a game.
---
Just reminding people this isn’t lead paint for babies, and your “hard work” for items isn’t actually hard work. It was the game.
---
So you can be frustrated if things are deleted, but it’s not a human rights violation for people to call for all duped items to be deleted.
---
Yeah some of them 3-4 hours ago. Nevermind.
---
Didn't say there wasn't but that's not a in game economy. You can only trade outside of the game. Its a economy but not a in game economy. You should not have to leave the game to find what you want. It's also not possible to fully trust the items you got are legit.  
---
So have 3 servers? Original, PVE only and PVP only? What about the amount of people playing now, you divide them into 3 groups further cutting it down. The servers are getting a bit on the light side as it stands then to divide the community further. I'd have to disagree on that end, maybe have 2 but it wouldn't be fair to pick or choose 1 server to import your character in then couldn't take it to the other. In that instance I'd say allow you to bring your character to both anytime or wipe(Which I am against mind you)
---
Trust me they aren't going to burn someone with a legit weapon. That also isn't how they worded it.
---
I've read the whole wall of text and i couldn't agree more. Thanks for this!
---
Why would they have the same id? And if they do, wouldnt every item with the same stats be the same item id?
---
appreciate ya
---
Happy to help! I’ve never cheated or exploited. Just traded as honestly as possible. 
---
I agree
---
Sooooo pull the server offline every week to move items around? 
---
Listen, I understand that it's shit that they can't manually move items, but that's a horrid idea
---
Content will bring people back and nothing else. This patch will bring nothing new to the table to entice players to return. Especially when we have anthem and metro exodus releasing soon. Only thing that might bring people back is if there is something new to do. 
---
Some people have nothing better to do. I had a random player team up with us and followed us to our camps. While we are just going about our business he starts using his TSE to shoot up our camps causing damage. So we kicked him off the team during his shooting spree, he got wanted for attacking our camps, killed him and made a few caps. 
---
I hold workshops for hours...until a nuke drops than it crashes. If no nukes I can hold workshops for long periods of time.
---
We're talking and thinking the same thing.
---
What they really needed to do was hot-fix dupe bugs as they were found. Not wait for 2 week cycles while the economy crashes and burns. The state of the economy and prevalence of duped items in circulation is entirely on Bethesda for not fixing the dupe bug and for not being able to track and punish players to discourage duping. Cheaters are always going to be there, it's on Bethesda to actively try to stop them. And they didn't.
---
Doubt. 
---
So your telling me I am at fault? I didn’t know what duping was when I bought it. I should at least get my caps back.
---
I'm fine with starting over. It may actually get me to use other weapons rather than sticking with my handmade or all rise. 
---
If it is based on the fo4 engine, then yes https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4_console_commands
---
I have a legit two shot Tesla on PS4 if it still exists when the servers come back up if you want lol
---
No , The Real question is what gets broken ?
---
Last time one of the few was rad worms
---
I'm not here to complain but that is too much for me to read so I came to the comments to see if there was a TL:DR
---
Even if some random item disappears from my inventory I won’t care, I’ll just continue to grind and find it, I really want this stupid duping problem to be fixed
---
Highly unlikely 
---
Doubtful 
---
Oh that identifier. I just woke up lmao. Yeah if they scan that then see 10+ in an inventory. Likely duped
---
ALL of this!
---
This game doesn't have an economy, there is pretty much no trade, there isn't an auction, no player hubs, etc. 
---
Anyone shouting "save the economy" are protesting duping for the wrong reasons. 
---
Dang sorry should have put xbox that sucks really wanted it
---
ah, communism.
---
Whats gonna happen to all those ebay listings?!
---
How many online games do you play? Most of the successful ones manage to keep up with item duping. And not continually finding cheaters and banning them because people will find more ways to cheat is like saying "Well, we shouldn't catch criminals because there will always be more of them.". Vigilance on the part of the devs keeps it contained enough if they are doing their due diligence. 
---
Not every TSE, but it wouldn't surprise me if every TSE Handmade and TSE Combat Shotgun is toast.  A TSE Broadsider, not so much.
---
The dupes do need to go.   The problem I, and many others have, is they do not trust the people that run this game to not make things even worse in their attempt to fix the problem.     I wish this wasn't the case but their track record with patch fixes is not very good with even small fixes.    Now this dupe deletion deal comes along, something that sounds complex, and we are expected to believe it's just going to work when they get the simple things wrong?
---
I wish this was not the case and I hope they prove me wrong.    I just do not think they will.    I fully expect that items I have stashed away that I looted will vanish.    If they do vanish I am sure I am not done with the game but I expect to play it less and less (a trend that was already in place prior to this dupe deal) with other games on the horizon that may prove to be more entertaining or at least less irritating than this one.
---
Honestly I see myself looking back at this game in a few months and just feeling sad about what might have been.     Maybe some good will come if other game studios can look at what has happened in this game and not repeat the mistakes this one has made.   I just wish it wasn't a Fallout game that had to be sacrificed for the lesson to be learned.
---
TSE Cats
---
Show me the effect.
---
Nothing regarding active players has ever been published. 
---
You are talking out of your ass.
---
Ah excellent, I agree then, as someone who has only brought a tiny handful of weapons from vendors I really do not care if they all go if it means dupers losing their shiz.  
---
And it'd be even funnier when the people who paid actual money on Ebay for these weapons lose them too
---
Fans: HOW DARE YOU BUILD US AN ENTIRE WORLD TO PLAY IN BUT NOT HAVE IT PERFECT
---
Bethesda: Fair point, we are working to...
---
Fans: WRONG, IT'S ALL WRONG WHY DO YOU HATE THE FANS, BETH
---
Bethesda: We have all the problems of a major theme park AND a major zoo, and we're working on...
---
Fans: \*foaming at the mouth\* BROTHERS AND SISTERS, JOIN ME IN UNINSTALLING THIS GAME WE ALREADY PAID FOR! THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN!
---
Filthy casuals: Hey, did anyone else notice server stability shoot through the roof? Sweet.
---
Wouldn't OP lose caps for getting killed though? Better to server hop or fast travel away IMO.
---
This is super helpful as some plans still do require server hops. The Cigarette Machine plan for example comes from the Raider vendors but sometimes isn't there.
---
I find it funny people still say "pRoVe It, ThErE iS nO PrOoOf"
---
As a player who doesn't cheat and is getting quite a bit of enjoyment out of the game, and with new PvP content coming, I think this is actually an important and welcome step. If their statement about the percentage of players affected is factual, which we have no real reason to doubt yet, then this change benefits more players than it hurts.
---
I have avoided all PvP because of the exploits and am level 164, with this action, I might actually try it out and also the new PvP mode when it is released.
---
Oh I agree fully. I was just stating that in fact not every trading player is a duper. It’s ridiculous seeing this everywhere as Bethesda themselves said a small percentage of accounts are duper’s. 
---
So if we bought stuff legitimately we can be boned by this? that kinda sucks, my guns are now garbage but I'd rather not have them just disappear. 
---
Losing your 1 cheat gun isn't going to ruin the game for you. You will just have to go farm loot like the rest of us. Big deal.
---
Fucking preach, sweet Jesus is that jukebox annoying.
---
Personally, I have 1 lvl 50 3* hunting rifle that I found in a suitcase at the Charleston train station last week. Considering that suitcases do not generate legendary guns, it is probably the only thing I may loose today.
---
I know where everything else I have came from
---
2002 is 17 years ago man, I know I feel old too. 
---
Stop being a whiny bitch. 
---
Guys, nobody tell him that duping hasn't and won't be patched.
---
I know where you are coming from, but your idea that if you want something that’s more rare, even after the “THE GREAT PURGE” you will be paying through the nose to get items. The reason you saw so many duped items in the market was everyone was selling pretty cheap. I don’t Bethesda will get every single duped item, it’s unlikely, so the ones that are left will not be going for 3-5k, they will be going for 15-20k. 
---
I trade heavily in the markets and I sell supply/demand prices after patches or nerfs. Will it be good for the economy, absolutely, but if you think prices will come down, that’s highly unlikely.
---
bUt It WiLl FiX tHe EcOnOmY!11&gt;?
---
I still don''t think they're going to delete single stack items unless they were traded from a known dupe reseller or something.
---
They ain't doing it already?  I thought we always had weekly maintenance.  
---
So you are saying the main problem in an fallout game is the multiplayer. I bet most of the people here will agree when we could have at least npc's, dialogue, a story or something like a role play game.
---
I'm trying!
---
TSEs of all sorts were going for like 2000 caps. In what world does it take three weeks to "grind" 2000 caps? That's literally two days of vendor runs max.
---
If anyone spent three weeks worth of caps (which is more than the cap limit btw) on a duped item they're a sucker anyway.
---
Other online games aren’t as badly run or as badly set up like this though are they? You’re expecting way too much from the Devs. Like I said, stacked Legendary Weapons will go. Duping will exist, only this time duper’s will dupe less quantity but more frequently
---
My 3*bloodied combat knife is going to be soooo sweet.  I think it is the only 3 star weapon I have that I didn't buy/trade for.  I will actually be disappointed if some of my gear is not gone.  Having almost everything you want is a quick way to boredom.
---
Easy..... dupers get banned 
---
And yet...
---
I was never compelled to exploit them there either...
---
Your point is the original source has bugs, Yes, have you any idea what team developed it, who's left the company, joined, edited, repeat, repeat.
---
I suspect you haven't worked in software, I am happy to be proven wrong, so you have no clue, or very little, when it comes to dealing with software with Millions of lines of code in any way shape or form, you, are an end user, with the happy ignorance of how software actually works.
---
You do something, the magic box accepts what you did, processes it and spits out the result to you, You have no idea how the magic box does it job and hands you the end result.
---
accurate
---
Interesting. I have to pay attention to this, This could be very well true.
---
It's not meant for any trophies or achievements to 100% it's only for Atoms. Calm down.
---
But if u didnt know its duped. It does suck
---
if you think this is going to stop cheating you haven't been paying attention. Additionally dupers have mostly gotten everything they have wanted, they already know places, spend hundreds of thousands of caps and can easily just find another method to dupe again.
---
That's my thought. 
---
I know.  I quit playing a while ago myself but I like to check in and see all the nonsense from the playerbase.  They hate being told the truth here. Lol
---
I'm not sure that light servers would be more of an issue after splitting them. You don't have to increase number of servers -- just have some be specialized.
---
"Fair" is an interesting concept to bring to this discussion, though. I personally am a PVE player who also trades a lot. It's why I farmed those plans to begin with -- so I would have something interesting to barter. Bethesda made it clear from the start that they wanted the economy to be driven by player trading -- it's really not fair to punish people for doing so because Bethesda didn't want to take the time in December to try to limit damage.
---
I don't think so. If what myself and many others suspected is true, duped items share supposedly unique, static instance IDs, which means erasing all duped items could be as simple as a database cleanup that removes all items with identical instance IDs.
---
Now, to be fair, there are still ways to fuck that up and cause damage to player inventories, but you'd have to really go out of your way to be that incompetent.
---
*(This comment will either be validated as soon as maintenance is over OR it'll be the most hilariously wrong thing on this subreddit. We'll see!)*
---
I know nothing about how Bethesda, coding or games in general work so this is a made up situation. 
---
But what if they have the ability to see an item ID in people's inventory but no way to track what happens with it. So they can see people have the same lvl 45 tse handmade with same durability etc but there is no server log to track if you sold the item to a vendor, traded it, gave it away, stored it on an alt, etc.
---
In this situation customer service wouldn't be able to help you. They could see you don't currently have item but not what happened with it or if you ever even had it.
---
Tldr: Only Bethesda knows how items are tracked and we'll all just have to wait and see what happens. 
---
You’re not going to get many because they’re already gone lol 
---
Exactly... Like everyone here screaming to fix it. Beth says "we're fixing it" Everyone here screams "they're breaking it!"  
---
Which one is it?!
---
I get it...  you're not a cheater.  I'm not for cheating.  I just want to hold onto every player we can, and some of them got desperate to stay interested. 
---
Interested in seeing the difference 
---
Keep in mind that the *vast* majority of players don't engage with trading/discussion boards, and are just playing casually. The only way they'd receive a duped item is if they traded it with another player or picked up something another player dropped; and when was the last time you made a trade with a stranger in-game without organizing it online first, or when you found a pile of amazing legendaries dumped on the ground?
---
I mean, even most of us that do hang out on message boards don't have duped items. Although if you traded for a "meta" weapon on a message board, there's the possibility it was duped.
---
I still reside in the ban em all and let todd sort em out category but then again im contraband free. 
---
I believe we've already seen data mining that shows backpacks are coming.
---
Well, i'll compare my weapon, apparel and magazines collections after patch
---
I know that must really suck for people who traded heavily. But I hope people will just go back to grinding and not give up. I love the weapons I have but a lot of the fun was earning them and throwing out 500 shit weapons to get that one good one. 
---
And it uses flamer fuel. 
---
you just drop scrap for getting killed in pvp, if you dont hit "revenge" then you dont lose caps.
---
Nah,  I like playing in the sofa on a 55" TV and not sitting on my desk while playing.
---
I think for some it will be the end of 76 for them. 
---
It's more about Bethesda constantly taking away (nerfs to events, workshops, equipment, perks, mob loot) without giving much back (no drop adjustments, energy weapon durability and damage issues, broken perks, queen/SB tweaks, fusion core production rates (admittedly finally fixed)) 
---
Fewer people would mind today's patch if Bethesda gave a bit of carrot along with the stick.
---
Took all of BrettD23s Weapons and armor I know that 
---
I'm not sure you've read Bethesda's comment correctly.  At least, when I read it I do not interpret this as their addressing a server crash...
---
Instead it sounds like they are going to increase the amount of time the server will allow low or no communication with the player before disconnecting them.  Fallout 76 is an 'always online' game so the server needs to maintain a reasonable connection with the player, to track items and ensure integrity, etc.  Hiccups in the player connection can result in disconnects on any game like that - so developers need to find a good balance between how much time is enough to make sure it's JUST a hiccup, and how much is too much and might compromise the tracking / communication the game needs to be effective.
---
Depending on *why* you're being disconnected this might have no or significant impact to your gameplay.
---
For example, if you play on a PS4 via a wireless connection your connection is *probably* more prone to variation.  If the server has been too sensitive about that variation and has been disconnecting you when it doesn't *need* to, you may find that you're getting far fewer disconnects.
---
If 76 is not a competition, cheating is fine. 
---
Which I would agree. There is no competition, there is little to no economy, this is a solo / co-op game that you might find another person in 40 hours later. 
---
Just release private servers already. 
---
Remember when this series was about roleplay and dialogue? 
---
Yea, but do these games also make you grind to respec? 
---
For example, nerf the fuck out of level 5 demo expert and now you have 5 wasted perks dedicated to that...Better start leveling up to respec.  It completely fucks over some loadouts. 
---
1 shotting ghouls and SMs wasn't a problem unless you were trying to farm XP somewhere and a high level wasn't letting you tag, in which case...move to another location or server.
---
And Oblivion voice actors
---
We don't really know yet.  
---
You just lose junk. I agree with you 100% but op said he didn’t want to have to do those things. 
---
I mean it makes sense doesn’t it?
---
And as a gamer, you're right! That's why it's not common, at all, for games to have item spawners, especially survival games!
---
Wait...
---
I hope they clear out all of my Mr. Handy Buzz Blade Plans.
---
I'm still sour over what Bungie did with Oathkeeper. 
---
For those out of the loop they did *exactly* what u/Narrator69 suggested: instead of fixing the exotic armor piece's exotic perk, they just removed the description and called it a day.
---
When I said cheaters I was referring to the people who purchased the items. Fuck those people. Fuck the dupers too but I don't expect them to learn any sort of lesson from this.
---
Pretty sure there is an achievement to be at ground zero when the nuke lands
---
That's the problem these asshats have no answer for.  
---
The "oh well sucks to be them" answer doesn't cut it...
---
I thought was the case, but if so, why go about deleting items? I suppose if too many made it out in the game (as we know they pretty much did) they are trying to reign it in, but as you said, they were supposed to ban the dupers. 
---
Does this mean that some early dups were not tracked, or is this a means of going after the duppers that didn’t go bonkers, having less than 10k mats &amp; less than 10 of certain weapons (for a hasty example)? 
---
I am just curious; this has been a *unique* lite MMO rollout, to say the least. 
---
Lmao You're a true Keyboard warrior over there...I'm stating why people are hesitant to embrace the update. If you have blind faith in everything going smoothly post-patch you've most likely been cheated on you're entire life and blindly stood by, oblivious to your cuckolded status. 
---
I didn't see an announcement to fix duping or ban dupers.  I saw an announcement to punish victims of fraud lol
---
I think you'll be alright you sound like you have fairly niche demands. My tse's on the other hand haha
---
It is - I'm not denying that.  Just fully expect them to burn some people in the process.  I'm not naive enough to believe they'll be able to do this surgically - it will be literally a massacre of items that have been previously duped.  The dupers have ruined the game for everyone basically, and legit players will get burned too (first from the nerfs, now the purge).
---
this person talks about maturity, and has no idea who i am!  LMFAO and points finger at you.   thththththththththt!!!
---
I admit theres plenty of issues with what we have but one shotting human players or high level enemys should not happen
---
The whole "NO U!" thing works well for you? 
---
I hate this game's current mode with the pacifist mode that can still be exploited and doesnt stop you from being killed. I am trying to be a realist in the options open for Bethesda, you might quit if they nuked their own servers I think it would bring some people back, some would leave but if they did it and brought in NCPs and vaults with it would lessen the blow.
---
&gt; track every single persons inventory back to its origins to find out where it came from
---
As a software developer, no way that's possible. A data model with that level of traceability would never perform well enough for a game like this. That's a massive amount of (usually) useless metadata. That or terabytes of server transaction logs. I do this shit for a living. For big customers there's just no way to offer features like that without the server falling over. Even if they did do some next-level DataStax black magic, they'd need a seriously skilled developer to reverse engineer the data in a way to accurately detect duped items. I highly doubt anyone on their team is capable. If they were, we wouldn't have this mess of a game in the first place.
---
Same 
---
Or they could have gotten off of their inept asses and fixed duping within the first fucking month of release...
---
Was it duped already or?
---
A rose is a rose 
---
I don’t deserve to be punished. I did not cheat. I have not been able to get online before the patch. Only heard about it earlier.
---
&gt; Aka legitimate players who have the common sense not to buy obviously duped items.
---
How is down there with your head in the sand?
---
Fixed description for Luck of the Draw III: *as opposed to its lowered level counterpart, this perk uses up three Luck slots and doesn't give you anything in return*.
---
Allll the salty down-votes from people losing their cheat shit!!! Loooollllll! Yes, your tears nourish me! Keep em' coming! Bahahaha!
---
You need the nocturnal sun drenched perk for it to take effect
---
Saving post, interested in your update once it goes live.
---
Yes. Especially if you then turned around and brought shitloads of items to make your assets *more* legit. 
---
Even if you only purge stacks of 5+ you'll still do a major service to the economy.
---
Go explore shit. Go team up. Get the Marsupial mutation or power armor jet pack and go look for things you could reach before. There is plenty of shit to do in this game yet people want to be told what to do to have fun. 
---
&gt; Two shot explosives suck now anyway 
---
As someone who never got to use a TSE pre-nerf, I've gotta disagree. My TSE handmade is far superior to my others, though I don't exactly have an extensive collection of legendaries.
---
Still haven't shown me your vast amounts of knowledge. Just flexing that smartass like it's gonna getcha somewhere. 
---
Smashy Smashy 76
---
You can get it in Harpers Ferry, it is a rare spawn. [Google is a wonderful tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qnI1jRMbPY)
---
So hopefully not to many innocents gets effected, but its gonna happen
---
This game could have been better at launch?
---
This game is as much shit as it was at launch. There isn't anything to defend. Literally nothing left to defend Bethesda on.
---
Go ahead and !Save a spot here on this comment and come back after this purge happens because we both know Bethesda is gonna fuck up yet another thing in game.
---
This game was DoA and its running on fumes... I mean some game stores are giving it away for free with the purchase of accessories.
---
Their game is fucked, but they still haven't sold legendaries in loot boxes like battlefront 2.
---
I'm hoping that my lvl 40 2\* ss bloodied deathclaw gauntlet does not disappear and has its demigod status reaffirmed (no one else would buy because it was not max level, probably a uranium fever drop?, which is also why I think that it is legit).
---
yeah I mean whatdoyouknow that one guy who is still working on the game just learned how to code by the beginning of this year. So for that, great job.
---
His patch management class will be finished in summer. Maybe we can expect something to be fixed instead of further broken by then. 
---
This one is 100% duped sorry dude 
---
This is unprecedented. 1) Someone actually admits they are wrong. 2) Provides evidence as to what made them change their mind. 3) Apologizes/thanks the exact users that called him out on his misinformation. 
---
I would dare to say that most journalists online today wouldn't even bother to point out the first 2 if they were caught spreading misinformation. 
---
Agree i wish people played games exactly how i do. Its annoying when people like to do things i dont. Dont they realize how stupid they are? Thinking for themselves and not taking my feelings into consideration. This is why i know im better than everyone else.
---
I think they are doing exactly what they say. Targeting a small portion of the OVERALL community. It just so happens that that small portion makes up a larger more visible portion of the FO76 subs on Reddit.
---
damn!  great idea.  wish i had thought of it.  not all that worried.  i did no trading with other players.  perhaps got a duped from a vendor?  can that happen?
---
If this is real, this would be fucking hilarious 
---
Come to /r/fo76filthycasuals we're pretty chill over there. 
---
The Great BrettD123 Valentine’s Day Purge! You get everything that’s taken away from you sucka
---
Hmmmm tell that to the folks that Metallica and the rest sued for downloading 
---
I agree that the more players there are the betterbut I also think some players are just not going to like a game no matter what and if you're running around with god mode weapons is all they're interested in maybe this just isn't the game for them.
---
Sure thing, Bub. That’s why I enabled it.
---
Thank you, come again.
---
Lmao hope not. I have a friend that traded this to me and he got it from a trade as well.
---
Totally this.
---
I dont know how to do it as I don't read guides or walkthroughs with Fallout games. In the game itself, I'm not even at that point where I can craft great weapons. I just hear enough discussion to assume that they can be done. If they can be crafted from some rare recipe, or if they can only be created with some type of exploit or duplication, then enlighten me. 
---
All I know is that the patch notes state that duped weapons or items will be removed from the game. From what the post says that I replied to, it gave no indication that it was obtained from any illicit means or meaures.
---
Probably very little considering I’m not a duper
---
What - you mean like the game gets broken?
---
Well that would be news. Not.
---
[Watch your profanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpigjnKl7nI)
---
Bruh. A dude wrecked my friends house and followed him across servers "because he was bored."
---
Like shit. If he wronged you and this is justice,  fine. Wasteland justice exists for a reason. But you were bored? M8 wut?
---
You're exactly right on this, Its insane to see this sub act, they get rightfully upset when Bethesda breaks something, but dare they try to do something to fix it, this sub also blows up and gets furious at it?
---
It makes it feel like the majority of people who post here dont really care about the game and just want to be mad for absolutely no reason, be it to rack up reddit karma, or just good old stir the pot. This needs to stop.
---
Flail harder dude.
---
Sorry, was someone stopping you from playing causally?  Keep playing, stop posting.  :) Also stop drinking. It's not healthy 
---
WHAT’S NEXT?
---
We see questions and comments on an almost daily basis regarding what’s to come in Fallout 76 and what we are actively working on. Our team is fully dedicated to delivering you great in-game experiences and that includes, first and foremost, continuing to make fixes and address issues. But we are also working on a lot of new content and features.
---
We mentioned our upcoming “Survival” mode is currently planned for release in March for fans of PvP, but we will also be introducing new PvE content for those of you who seek adventure through quests, events, and other features. We’re planning to do this through series of weekly updates we’re calling “Wild Appalachia”, which will be our first big content drop of the year and spans the next few months. In addition to new quests, events, and challenges it will also bring new content to C.A.M.P.s, Crafting, and much more.
---
Our 2019 Roadmap, which we’re currently looking to roll out later this month, will give you a broader look at what's coming to Fallout 76 with Wild Appalachia. Additionally, ahead of each Wild Appalachia update, we will share a more in-depth preview of the new content and features being introduced to the game the following week.
---
A LOOK AT SOME OF PATCH 6
---
Fallout76 Grafton Banner 750x200
---
Patch 6 is anticipated to release next week and planned for simultaneous launch on Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4. This will be the last update ahead of Wild Appalachia, which will be supported by Patch 7. Sticking to 6, we are still compiling our full patch notes to provide to you once that update is available, but in our tradition, we wanted to share with you some of the larger fixes we’re working on.
---
Stash Limit Increase to 800 – We know this continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item’s you’ve found in the Wasteland!

The M79 Grenade Launcher and the Auto Grenade Launcher are now classified as Heavy Weapons – A fix is being made to properly label the M79 Grenade Launcher and Auto Grenade Launcher as Heavy Weapons. They will also now correctly benefit from all Heavy Weapons perks except for Heavy Gunner, as we believe it makes more sense for these weapons to benefit from the Demolitions Expert perk. Boom!
---
Accidentally Damaging another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer tag you as WANTED – From our Known Issues list, players who accidentally shoot, hit, or disturb another player’s C.A.M.P. will no longer become WANTED and viewed as engaging in PvP. Instead you must actively work to be malicious to another player and DESTROY their C.A.M.P. objects for it to be considered a PvP action and become marked as WANTED. We will closely monitor player feedback to this change.
---
Player Icons now display in more areas throughout the game – Once Patch 6 arrives, hovering over a player on the map will now display their player icon, and Workshops will display their owners’ player icons, too. Additionally, when viewing a turret created by another player, you’ll now be able to see the owner’s name and player icon in the turret’s nameplate.
---
Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items – With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest items.
---
There will be many more fixes in Patch 6 as we work to make the game stronger and address your top concerns.

LIVESTREAMING THROUGH APPALACHIA
---
Fallout76 TV Banner 750x200
---
Starting soon, our Community team is going to start livestreaming Fallout 76 on Twitch and Mixer. We’d like to start working to answer more of your questions in real-time while also having fun hanging out with you. We’ll be curating these streams based on what you’d like to know, as well as using them as opportunities to chat more directly with you while we share in our excitement for new content, quests, events, and more throughout this year, and beyond.
---
We're currently aiming for our first stream to take place on Friday, February 22, from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m. ET.
---
WEEKLY SPOTLIGHT: IT TAKES TWO (OR THREE, OR FOUR) ...
---
Today is Valentine’s Day, and our latest in-game spotlight is all about building great relationships through great teamwork. Now, through February 18, you’ll gain +15 maximum health for each player on your team, so be sure to show your closest compadres in the Wasteland how much you care by teaming up to snag some bonus health.
---
If they were duped, then sorry, but seems likely they may be gone.  But, if you bought them from here from people with trades tracked, I think it might be interesting to publicly ask them why they were selling duped items and ask for your caps back.
---
Exactly what a duper would say 
---
Negative players are what make up this sub population 
---
I agree.  I said it was BS.  Just curious,  if they are not banning people this time for same conditions of accounts,  it would be wrong to not let the others back in.  Personally,  I can not be upset either way.  I know my shotgun was probably duped.  So I want duping to stop and all.  But fair is fair.  Life isn't,  but I try to be.
---
Look at mister fancy there, with enough carry weight remaining to carry 4000 caps! :P
---
I think the max condition is also a tell given that it varies a lot depending on the looter's luck and modifiers at that instance.
---
i think currently that's bethesda's biggest problem -- they're taking things away without giving people anything. DLC may bring people back. I don't know. I just know what would drive me, personally, away from this game. I set my mind out to do something, spent far too much time to achieve it, and if that were wiped, that would be it. And it's not even having to start over and do that grind again -- it's knowing that Bethesda wouldn't think twice about doing it again if they messed up again.
---
you must be new here  /s.... most posts in this sub are simply complaints about anything/everything that could possibly be negative about the game..... some of us are happy with it and enjoy the progress the game is making. It's early stages of hopefully a long term game, things should continue to improve. .... also, i totally agree with you
---
Get an anti armor handmade, I promise, especially if you put the perforating magazine mod on it, you will drop that pos in a river. If you on PlayStation I'll make it my mission to farm one for you
---
I was just about to comment this myself. It's one of few items in the Creation Club that I actually found to be worthwhile. Then I went and got another off a vendor and customized that one for my companion in the game as well. 
---
Yeah, I can get behind this. I’m just a filthy casual player, after all. All I do in FO4 is run around with the NCR mods, Dustbowl, and FCOM, patrolling the Commonwealth’s version of the Mojave. In 76 I just fucking around, shoot stuff with a friend or two, and explore. I’m level 66 and I haven’t discovered every location yet. Still haven’t launched a nuke. Still haven’t gotten a jet pack yet. The only legendary weapon I use is a ghoul slayer’s pipe wrench so I can pretend to be the Engineer from TF2. And I’m still having a fucking blast.  
---
It's not a bug, that has to be specifically put in and it has a cost. They might have made the decision not to do it.
---
"Stash Limit Increase to 800"  
---
2 days later:  
---
"800 is not enough!" - players who still think they should be able to keep every single item they come across 
---
Well yeah I was half awake. I get what he means now, but the ID will only be one ID for a TSE Shotgun for example. What I originally thought he meant was implying every TSE shotgun has a different item id. Which isn't true seemingly from how the game manages items. Also would've been quicker for Bethesda to purge if the database worked that way.
---
Of course I am still subject to being wrong. Just going off what things point to, but as with most programming nothing makes sense 100% of the time.
---
No salt, no throwing “facts”, no instigating? I think I’m going to read more Dr Suess books.
---
tbh I'd rather there be a reset than there being dupes in the world
---
No sympathy. What a dumb thing to do.
---
It probably won’t be deleted, but it should be.
---
Yeah but they are inching closer to pay to win with the stat bonuses provided if you are wearing the newest Atom shop stuff and it's 18 bucks for a PA paint. Plus look at the canvas bag scandal, the dumb $270 jacket, the ripoff nuke dark rum, and even the the PA mask is junk.
---
These are the questions we need answered to! 
---
Finally.
---
This is a step in the right direction.
---
Good on you Bethesda.
---
Pretty nice, all my stuff is down here, and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.
---
The way I look at it, I don't need screenshots. If something is gone and I can't tell, I didn't need it anyway. I never traded for legendaries, never bought them from vendors, or picked them up from paper bags. All I have are mostly what would be considered mediocre or junk legendaries by the current standards set by the overflowing marked of God tier items. And I have played over 500 hours with my junk legendaries and have had a great time with it. FYI, I still use my level 50 All Rise as my main melee. God tier legendaries are not needed to play, have fun, or be successful at events (like Scorched Earth).
---
And it ends with them plugging their atom shop...I am happy to see the stash box increase. 
---
I hadn’t thought about that, but as I read it it seems rather obvious; just script to target anyone over x * 100k pounds overweight. 
---
Priceless
---
lmao whatever you say bud.
---
YeS !
---
New PvE content, stash increase !
---
Just fyi, if a player wants to make caps it takes *very little* time to do a vendor run and get 1,000 a day.
---
OP - What did you get your hand for Valentine's Day?
---
Some of us farmed 'like the rest of you' by doing cap stash runs, farming whitesprings then killing SBQ and  bought stuff with our hard earned caps or traded unwanted good legendaries for a legendary we want. This isn't just 1x 2000 caps weapon lol. A lot of us paid a lot of caps for our gear and we might get it taken away from us. I'm not gonna bitch about my stuff being gone since i got plenty of explosive weapons i farmed myself, but i'm so sick of you guys feeling like elitists for never trading with anyone else. Boi, we didn't buy our shit for a mere 500 caps.
---
Filthy casual me: Heh look at me taking photos of my character that makes him look naked 
---
So you making assumptions based on nothing, and I'm a smartass? While I make assumptions based on info provided?
---
Don't bother replying by the way, I'm done with this pointless conversation.
---
tbh I had better ping during the beta than since the 2nd update
---
I wish I have one
---
Exactly! Any of you remember party hat duping in Runescape years ago? Same shit happened, people got scammed and lost their money and items. People will never learn, it seems. But with Fallout 76's low cap limit, at least the people that duped and don't get banned can't really hoard a lot of currency. So at least the cheaters don't walk off set for the rest of the game.
---
I read a post the other day that said that only 87.9% of people achieved the achievement for exiting the vault. Therefore 12% of people who booted up the game didn't even make out of there. How many more didn't even play the game enough to get the caps to buy a weapon from a potential FO76 trader and then how many of those people found each other on a trading post. It probably is a small percentage of the number of people registered on the game but a high percent of people who have ever actively traded through an online portal and there are many of those....
---
You got it wrong. Ppl are not complaining but are fearing what Bethesda might brake (again) with the new fix.  
---
I would totally be not surprised if perfectly fine inventories get deleted as well. 
---

---
I'm finally going to find out today if that vendor bot in Morgantown sold me a duped TSE minigun. 
---
I've never traded with anyone other than in game vendors. I'll be real disappointed if it turns out the Morgantown vendor bot is a duper.
---
I honestly don’t talk because the few people who do have their mics on sound like 30-40 year olds and tbh as a 15 year old I don’t really wanna talk to them
---
 "I see players that say they have played 500 hours completely knocking this game. Are you f’kn kidding me?"
---
No shit, name something you wouldn't get a little bored with after 500 hours. Also, if it is such a shite game, wtf you play for 500 hours?!
---
Nope. No. There's no sarcasm on the internet.
---
I had someone run up to me and hand me a suit of x-01 power armor when they saw my lvl 99 run by in excavator armor
---
Spoiled meat and dirty water will make soup worthy of the gods.
---
I don't disagree with that.  Just sharing my own related experience.
---
I’ll take a quantum of solace ;)
---
Will be fun to see if we really have drama or if Bethesda gets something done right. 
---
What are the odds?
---
Always expect bugs. 
---
Though as a software engineer, you would probably know things are typically flagged, instead of outright deleted, in a DB.
---
Still wondering how Bethesda "works" on the game for weeks and comes out with a patch that makes five changes, changes that community modders could have made in less than an hour.
---
Well I was able to buy a second one off a vendor just last night and customize that one for my companion, so it's not unique to just the player, but you are correct on the "straps or no straps" option and that it wasn't very expensive either. 
---
Why should I have to do this? This is a triple fucking A game (supposedly) we shouldn’t have to do this. Bethesda is making players who left not want to come back, and making new players leave. Really sad. 
---
The whole thing is wierd. Once again the argument that hey are dicking people who just played the game and traded other players is only valid because behesda made it valid. You cant tell people they are not going to take them, which causes everyone to go ahead and buy them with caps and trades, then take them. They just made people waste thier time. 
---
Everyone keeps talking about the w shit explosives as well. But this affects Armor, an a crap ton of melee weapons too. I would guess 50 percent of all legendaries in the game are duped. Once bethesda basically gave the ok , no one kept thier 1 or 2 star crap, they dumped it and got on reddit and traded for better stuff. 
---
I for instance wanted a 2 shot of every gun, i almost have them all. I need a rail rifle still. I traded armor and caps for all of them. Now when I log in half of them might be gone. Its just wierd
---
I love the gurgle noises after you smash em in the face. So cathartic.
---
Nothing happening is still a net negative, since the game is in a poor shape outside of duping.
---
Much better news. Beth bringing hope back.
---
This is a hallmark of Bethesda games.  Like horses in Skyrim riding straight down a cliff.  
---
In that case shame on Bethesda for not wiping sooner. If items had UIDs then they could've easily identified duped items sooner and shut down mass resellers of duped items and improved server stability. The fact they didn't really implies to me that they had to develop some hack around it or don't give a shit.
---
Civil assets forfeiture is spot on! Cheers fellow wastelander!  
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo

https://youtu.be/hFcLyDb6niA

I pretty much like all of what was mentioned in this weeks issue. Looking forward to it!
---
Please keep in mind that these are **not** the full patch notes, just an extract of what will come in the next and future updates. 
---
yup, i always do this, and have had it happen to myself several time, special around watoga :)
---
I will watch the chaos with you!
---
There is no patch until next week.  The servers are down for maintenance and server-side updates, including the deletion of duped items.
---
Latest news [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019)
---
Fair enough...
---
I honestly wouldn't be surprised
---
Notice he said bugs and not "bug fixes"
---
Also, 100% accurate...
---
If its such an issue then un sub and delete the game? Nobody needs your toxic ideals❤️ 
---
And if you try to backlash with a comeback then you are just salty and not worth anyones time. Just saying. 
---
I think it is more because of the removal of duped items the server has less strain.
---
HMMMMMMMMMMMM
---
i have faith in bethesds 😆
---
The loot drops are very bad. Diablo3 vanilla level.
---
Really? How did one know? People who. Bought them before duping became common knowledge or so wide spread? Or people who bought them 3rd or even 4th hand and the seller didn't have a stack of other TSE or bobble heads?
---
And yeah, there isn't anything in the T&amp;C about buying duped items anyway. It refers to using exploits and 3rd party programs but if you aren't doing the duping you aren't using the exploit anyway. 
---
You are ignoring a lot of other things they did.  They nerfed ALL explosive weapons not just TSE.  Sure they have given us a few other things we have wanted but they have also fucked a bunch of stuff up, bobby pins, bulked crafting materials, load in screens.  That’s why we expect problems and are mad
---
No bug fixes were mentioned but they did say they were going to implement a change that would reduce the server disconnect issue 
---
That could very well be true.
---
I didn't get griefed every day. But when i did they f'd my mother.
---
They sit there and just spit it in your face until you ignore them and quit the server.Which is easy to do when no one on my buddy list is playing anymore. However, it's not easy to hurt me personally as taking over workshops are trivial.I do get frustrated at the mechanics of fighting back though. Their op weapons just get me murdered and it costs me hundreds to thousands of caps to run a campaign of retribution. Which frankly is not worth the hastle as it never ends with me gaining any ground. 
---
While i don't get mad bro as they often ask. I do get frustrated in knowing that they get to run wild indefinitely because there is no one moderating the game. The only time i hear of someone getting banned or punished is that one article about someone gay bashing. Or when bethesda gets up off the couch and punishes the kids for exploiting. 
---
Lol. Still no proof of more than two lies. Come on, if they are compulsive this is really easy :)
---
I haven't played in 2 weeks. I'll probably be back now that all my shit is gone have to be ready for the new content were gonna eventually get
---
 So now we're complaining about the complainers complaining about the complainers complaints? 
---
The only people hesitant to embrace this update are the whiny bitches upset they're losing all of their dupes and the even whinier bitches who look for the absolute worst in each update because they're so thirsty for upvotes from all the other losers that hate this game and totally unintalled weeks ago yet still lurk around complaining about every patch.
---
Bethesda had one fucking update that accidentally rolled back a handful of fixes for all of a few days and idiots like you think this patch is going to delete everyone's characters. 
---
Dev tools != QA tools.  
---
A dev could restore any item they want, at any time. Realistically, even hotpatch it in while the game is running (That's kind of what transnational DBs are for).
---
It's highly unlikely they'd give QAs access to the DB. Tools should be developed for them, sure, but they probably just never got around to it.
---
huh? Did you think i was being sarcastic? 
---
Of course servers are down and you know what happened to your charracter. Burn in hell for making me think it is online.
---
nice!
---
I completely agree.
---
Yes, there was a way BethSoft could have released this game to get the community prepared for the rest of its development life, and to provide context to how this games development would differ just by the office handling it. **They dropped the ball hard on this, I get it!**
---
I think that could have gone a LONG way in prepping the gaming communities expectations, but once you realize that **that is** a factor, how are there **STILL** people complaining about it?!
---
I mean, "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here." *(heh, movie quotes)*
---
If a monkey throws poop at you, that's a learning experience, but you can't get mad when you stand in the **same spot** getting poop lobbed at you like you had **NO** idea what was going to happen. I'm freaking sick of toxic people complaining.
---
*BethAustin*, good job guys. Keep up the good work. I know this experiment will pay off eventually and I've had a **TON** of fun playing in a legit Fallout world with my friends &lt;3
---
If a solution to anything in a game is “just server hop” then the game itself is designed poorly 
---
That’s a good point 
---
By unique I just meant with the strap options and patches! So if it was in this game it’d be like hey you’re a responder or a raider etc! :) The little details are nice as opposed to just a blanket item!
---
Well, you’re the one complaining about it, so...
---
I don't disagree with you but a lot of those  "taking away" were bugs that gave you to much rather then really nerfs - like ghouls giving to many legends and to much xp unbalanced the game 
---
that said I do think a few bugs like feed the people should have been made into actual effects where everyone got 1-3 cans of stew for doing it and I think more vents should give server side rewards dependent on how well people did at it and effect the server over all 
---
I know even less now. I haven't played Diablo since two and that was in like 8th grade. 
---
I’ve been saying for a while, I wanna build a makeshift apocalyptic camp/stronghold, not play Barbie Dreamhouse. 
---
Our roadmap will be released this month, officially stated on our [Inside The Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019) that just released a few minutes ago;
---
&gt; Our 2019 Roadmap, which we’re currently looking to roll out later this month, will give you a broader look at what's coming to Fallout 76 with Wild Appalachia. Additionally, ahead of each Wild Appalachia update, we will share a more in-depth preview of the new content and features being introduced to the game the following week. 
---
The Meteoritic Sword is a rare drop from the event Breach and Clear in the Ash Heap.  I've got one, and I believe it's capped at level 25.  It's not a great weapon for anyone past that level.
---
I call tails.
---
I still feel we should get a free respec option out of all this mess.  First the TSE nerf, when so many built their toons based off of TSEs.  Now we've readjusted to life after the nerf, and those weapons could magically disappear from our inventory.  Balancing the other weapons would be nice too, or we will all end up swinging Super Sledges.  
---
That's blatantly false....
---
I found a lvl 25 one on Breach and Clear.  Not sure of it's use yet.  I'm thinking of switching back to Melee.  It's also spelled as Meteoritic on mine for some reason.
---
The same people that play TF2 and want Aussies. 
---
its like were asleep, but knowing were being robbed at same time
---
I agree a list is fair. That way you know not to trade for those items and risk losing them in a future patch. Also giving a notice a week out would be nice. However how will ammo, food, outfits, be handled. Curious to see. Many caps/blood/sweat/tears have been spent lol. No but seriously I hope they dont push even more of my friends list away from the game. Reimbursement for my hard earned stuff if they take away items. I'll take a legendary perk or something fresh to the game in place of whatever duped stuff I bought. A bandaid dlc is it most likely it
---
Random drop from Breach and Clear Event. Cool collector's item, but Viability is sketchy.
---
I've been on both sides of this issue, sometimes in the same day.  What it ultimately comes down to is that the game is just not stable enough to be enjoyable over the long term for even a casual player (like me).  Between the endless server problems and innumerable glitches related to basic video game concepts like inventory integrity and weight capacity stability, it's just extremely frustrating to try to play this game for more than half an hour at a time.  And that's bad for the fanbase, and ultimately bad for Fallout.  I wanted to love this game.  This game did not want to love me.
---
However next week there will be changes
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019
---
New CAMP content for free? Sounds good
---
Bloodied explosive has the best conditional DPS (with the trade-off of being at low health), anti-armor explosive has the best unconditional dps (but I think the calculations make it only 1% or so above TSE)
---
No, they are just adding some new bugs.
---
The "Kill and gather" event thing in the Ash zone - you may find one in one of the containers on the mining drill.  
---
It's a good event to do anyway to gather minerals :)  
---
Thanks for posting this. 
---
&gt; There will be many more fixes in Patch 6 as we work to make the game stronger and address your top concerns
---
Modders aren't gods you know. 
---
Traded caps with two different people for a tse gatling and 50 cal maybe their duped or not i see after the patch.
---
They could of, they just needed to not launch the game with 10000 bugs
---
This all sounds good to me!
---
Do what? I didn't ask that you do anything?
---
amen! As a responsible adult (job + family)... when the day is over and everyone has gone to bed, shooting things in the face (or dropping a nuke on something) is quite relaxing....particularly with a nice beer/whiskey nearby. Keep on preaching! 
---
(also, if you haven't yet, might wanna check out /fo76FilthyCasuals sub.... they're on the same level as you in this one)
---
They nailed it! 
---
I agree with much of this except that many people don’t like doing the same work over again. And the game is not at its best when only players that will gladly replay the same content over and over are all that remain. It may be the lesser of two evils but that does not make it good. 
---
All TSE will be deleted and replaced with a level 50 Drill that does 1 damage and shoots confetti
---
This is so true. The game lends itself to duping. They could put 50 people on it for the next 2 years on game and they won't be able to stop it.
---
It is a item that comes from the Event ; Breach and Clear, it shows up randomly in the ore containers, nice weapon, not top tier though. Haven't used it so it might have a better durability to it
---
Id say the valentines day purge is a contributing factor for the decision to increase stash size.
---
"new content to C.A.M.P.s, Crafting, and much more"
---
It will be more than weekly events.
---
you keep moving the goalpost around. it's funny.
---
just now you said that there was no status quo and that I couldn't support the statement they are liars.
---
first, I'm supporting it by quoting the status quo. and then I proved that the status quo exists.
---
I don't know what else you want from me. let's just wait a bit and see how many people are left.
---
The argument is the micro-transactions keep DLC content free. Not so much in ESO, but that is the argument. 
---
I'm worried about all my plans. Everyone can be acquired through drops but who knows what will be there when I get home.
---
&gt;There will be many more fixes in Patch 6 as we work to make the game stronger and address your top concerns
---
Read the entire damn article...
---
But when HAVEN'T they messed something up?
---
I heard it takes about a month for support to reply from another person I play with.
---
Lol the roll back did not allow duping to occur boards and weapons remained unstackable don't believe everything you read.
---
I've been waiting for 2 months for them to fix an Atom shop item I bought, so...
---
Read the fucking article.
---
Fan group one (who haven't been cheating) Fix the game, Beth! Do something about duping!
---
Bethesda: We are fixing duping right now.
---
Fan group two (who have either been duping, or got stuff from obvious dupers): Blargh! Nooooooo!
---
Bethesda: Applies fix.
---
Cool! More shit that GOOD developers could have fixed in 48 hours. 
---
&gt; **Stash Limit Increase to 800** – We know this continues to be a big one. Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds. Like last time, we are constantly evaluating storage space and discussing ways we can make improvements, but not at the expense of server stability. We hope this additional increase to 800 pounds will help you store even more of the awesome item’s you’ve found in the Wasteland!
---
In addition to the dupe removals, next weeks patch will bring an [increase to STASH space](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019) :)
---
They're not going to release full patch notes ahead of the patch because this sub showed them how well that works in the past.
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
That was not a lawsuit for theft - Metallica v. Napster, Inc. Concerned copyright infringement, NOT theft. 
---
As they are two completely different issues. 
---
Typically 3 hours and it's already been 2.5 hours.
---
A lot of times you might have seen people who are chatting in team chat.
---
I think there are two different cases:
---
Those who bought items in eBay or websites (or caps to buy them in game). Obviously 100% duped.
---
Those who "worked" for caps in the game (looting, trading, farming vendors…) and spent the obtained caps for an item, that could be duped or no.
---
First group deserves the worst.
---
Second group, hmm...
---
In any case, I will be happy with any drastical actions they take. At this point this game has few to lose.
---
They said they were “weekly updates” nothing was mentioned about them being timed weekly events like in Destiny for example. Weekly updates could literally be anything. It could be atom shop stuff even
---
most of the community is just whoring for karma at this point. ignore them.
---
Yes..  it did...
---
Nope! They are just adding 4-5 things that could have been hot-fixed in by real game developers. 
---
You're acting like these were hidden little bugs.
---
They could have looked at the top downloads of their games' nexus mod pages where they were fixed with unofficial patches.
---
You're whiteknighting Bethesdas decision to release a game that wasn't nearly ready and then charge 60$ for it.
---
Then you're blaming players for cashing in on Bethesdas laziness. If there's a way to cheat in any multiplayer game, it will be utilized whether you like it or not. It's the job of the dev team to tests for these kinds of things BEFORE release.
---
They can't do that when their game is releasing in Alpha Early Access and they don't have time.
---
I have a feeling you don't have any experience in game development/production.
---
Any QA team would have warned Beth about a large number of the problems they're facing right now. The company went ahead anyway knowing the state of the game.
---
Ahh, okay. Misunderstood then. Yes, they're unique. You can change the backpack color as well, along with giving it increased carry weight, radiation protection, or things like that. 
---
I’d pay $20 for dlc over digital loot if it was actual content. I’ve bought all ESO updates until morrowind.
---
Nah just meme talk but im glad they are fixing the game and releasing new content very soon
---
You’re not wrong. I think most of the people with sense left and the filthy casuals sub is leaking. 
---
Not really been waiting for the new downtime like crazy the servers were superlaggy the last days. 
---
Man I use a .44 all the time. It’s one of my mains. Let me get that ammoooo lol
---
I had a similar rant a few weeks ago and went over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals for my FO76 community. I only stay on here to suggest it to players who seem frustrated at the current state of this sub.
---
The filthy casual sub is a really chill group that loves to just play and share our experiences with no bashing or hate.
---
It is almost as if there are multiple types of people in the community. 
---
A new chair for your camp, content.
---
For whatever it’s worth the mini gun is the only tse I have legitimately found. The only other I have is a  10mm tse I bought about 60 levels ago from a guy that had just the one I bought. I don’t think it was duped and there was no indicators the guy was being shady so I coughed up the 1750 caps. 
---
I wonder if the inventory cap will be removed or increased once they rid the game of duped items and can limit the ability to dupe. Could be something that comes out with the introduction of player vending.
---
Can u give a detailed explanation of how to do it?
---
Personally I do not think that legendary drops are broken. I have had a great deal of success with it, but then again I spent roughly 100 lvl grinding, honing my skills (lvl 160 now) and had a lot of fun doing it. They do require more skill as I have leveled, but that has been a fun challenge as well.
---
Also I do not think that the abundance of goddrops is a playability issue: I received legitimate drops of many 1* bloodied of: deathclaw gauntlet, gatling gun (a 2* as well), gauss rifle, pipe pistol (actually really great), combat rifle, tesla rifle, pickaxe, ect... (and some demigod rolls as well). These 1* are more than adequate to deal with anything that the game can throw at me. I almost always get loot from the SBQ as well (using a gatling gun). I hope that this does not come off as bragging, but simply illustrates the point.  
---
Does skill really need to be removed from the equation to make the game fun?
---
Gave up on trying to do this 😂
---
Can we also please have an emote for ‘hey, here’s a paper bag full of some stuff I don’t need, you’re welcome!’
---
I can rebuild non legendary versions of all my gear and go get new legendaries... so i would'nt be worried, as long as it happened to everyone and not just me.
---
It's still a problem. I have pacifist on and on some occasions a dude have run in front of me constantly when I'm shooting at the queen. Incredibly annoying.
---
I literally said in my post that no one can sue Bethesda. 
---
You didn't read it, did you?
---
I would just like a way to display weapons and armor at my CAMP without anyone being able to either steal it or take up too much room in inventory management.
---
I'm quite sure those wanting duped items purged and those complaining about duped items being purged are not the same people ;) 
---
I sincerely hope that patch includes a fix to enemies randomly regenerating health or not taking damage at all and to stealth being broken ever since that "hotfix".
---
Uh, oh! Looks like SOMEONE bought duped gear! The salt! Hahaha! :)
---
Yes they did. “Will change weekly” that is what is called weekly events.
---
Signed
---
I’ll take your word for it
---
I hope they accidentally wipe every player item and then the game dies. They dont deserve us.
---
then stop playing and leave this sub so we don't have to listen to you bitch about how shitty it always has been and always will be... some of us still enjoy it
---
I'm glad to see posts like this and glad to see them being up voted. I was down voted pretty bad for suggesting that all duped items be removed from the game. I also said it didn't matter if you aren't the duper: if you traded for a duped item you a beneficiary of cheating and deserve to have that item deleted from your inventory. 
---
I know several people with TSE.  They ARE NOT dupers themselves, but they bought stuff from people who are dupers and they know that they did. 
---
The mere existence of duped items causes more problems than many people realize.   Good riddance.
---
Do you have any powerful weapons yourself? Maybe one you bought “legit” with caps? Consider it gone. 
---
https://youtu.be/iipW97p_CpI
---
^ Me killing a charred Feral ghoul with a Bladed Commie Whacker. I forgot I had it equipped when trying to claim a bounty..... 
---
Agreed. I use a 3star executioners pole hook...only weapon I carry for the past month and rarely does it let me down, even in SBQ Event.
---
Not really, I just gave up after a long time and 
---
1000 caps worth of moving my base around
---
I did. If this is all that's confirmed, and it's a week out, do you geniuses honestly think the patch quality/size is going to double?
---
If so, lol. Ok then.
---
I'm level 60 and run a commando build with a 10mm submachine gun and automatic combat rifle, so those types of weapons, 10mm or .45 ammo, or even your spare lead would be appreciated but you're welcome to the power fist either way. Gamer tag is raidenbckbckfwd
---
Bam and half of your stuff will be gone
---
Removing a mass set of items that meet a specific criteria and currently exist in player inventories is a lot different than re-creating a specific item that neither exists nor can be proven to have ever existed. Two completely different things. This is also something the devs are doing on a game wide level, not something happening individually, account-by-account, through customer support.
---
It meshes fine.  
---
They need sample size for each platform.  
---
They can't go through everybody's inventories, take a list of every items UID, and then check *every item in every inventory against a constantly updating list.* That's just not possible.  
---
They likely had to wait until they could get their hands on *confirmed* duped items that they could know with 100% certainty, manually craft the list looking for those *exact* UIDs, and then run against that.
---
Scanning for 1000s of items in someones inventory is easy, but again, they were looking for a specific set of items (wooden boards, for an example)
---
But before you leave, make sure to check out the Atomic Store!
---
I already do that after fast travel according to my friends 
---
shhh.
---
this schizophrenic sub is currently in Bethesda love mode. 
---
So basically what they are saying is; We need to fix shit and get servers more stable as preparations for the new content.
---
That's what I get from this, welp we will have to wait til next month, but I'm not complaining this works for me.
---
I’ve been mic shy with FO76. I talked all of the time in WoW and EVE. The only time I hear other folks is during trades or that one squeaky, excited kid during SBQ. 
---
I've seen Super Mutants cry out in pain BEFORE I make contact with them.  How in the hell do they know it's going to hurt before my Deathclaw Gauntlet gets there?
---
How about the complainers get their collective head out of their asses and stop expecting everything they want to mean what all players want.  To stop expecting them to tell you EVERYTHING they have planned in their patch and let a little suspense grow for things. To stop spouting off "fewer players" without a single shred of evidence that thir statement is true.
---
&gt;server-side fix to reduce the frequency that players might experience disconnects from game servers
---
I don't quite read it that way that they are increasing the amount of time until an inactive player times out. They are applying a server-side fix to a given problem. 
---
I'm playing on a wired PS4. No wireless.  This issue has been brought up zillion times in the forum, that workshops are not worth keeping because of frequent server crashes.  
---
So?  You don't do any damage to them.  It happens, aim high out of line of fire of people, or get elevated and shoot down so there's no one in you LOF. 
---
The OP was saying as soon as he attacks a person with Pacifist off they turn around and one shot him.  Pacifist wasn't designed to prevent blocking shots, it was designed to prevent unwanted PVP.
---
Still waiting on that road map....
---
&gt;Please provide proof that a majority of people consider Bethesda compulsive liars. That's what you need to claim it is the status quo.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Bethesda%2Blies
---
&gt;I have seen people say a lot of things about Bethesda but not that specific claim.
---
see, this is what I'm talking about. that is a blatant lie. I can't prove a negative. just like when you said the majority of people in the game *don't* sport god rolls.
---
&gt;If you can provide concrete examples, I can be swayed here, but you don't have any either.
---
ok, I'll throw you a bone.
---
**it just works**
---
it doesn't.
---
&gt;We mentioned our upcoming “Survival” mode is currently planned for release in March for fans of PvP, but we will also be introducing new PvE content for those of you who seek adventure through quests, events, and other features. We’re planning to do this through series of weekly updates we’re calling “Wild Appalachia”, which will be our first big content drop of the year and spans the next few months. In addition to new quests, events, and challenges it will also bring new content to C.A.M.P.s, Crafting, and much more.
---
Where does it say “will change weekly”
---
They’re not. They’re people who mess with games for fun on their free time after they get home from work and somehow manage to get more done than this. 
---
2x in the last 2 days I've watched someone run the other direction off into the sunset. 
---
I saved a level 49 from some ghouls at Harpers Ferry the other day. We cleared them out and I left the one legendary with a sliver of health. I don't think this player knew what a legendary was because he walked over.....looked at it ......then ran off.
---
Once duping is gone the trading market is going to thin out. If people want more 3* gear out there they had better start working together.
---
Mole rats are too gamey for my taste :)
---
The fan base supports it, you can complain about something you like, nothing is perfect, but they have been treating people like crap, 
---
\&gt; I see players that say they have played 500 hours completely knocking this game. Are you f’kn kidding me? 
---
that means nothing, if we play it 5 hours we don't give it enough time. a 2 hour movie is better than 500 hours of crap in delayed self gratification. Imagine wow with no end game, you played 200 hours to get to 60 only to quit? it's a different mindset  
---
People also wanted Co-Op Bethesda games to be a thing. We're bloody hopeless when it comes to what we really want, and I now know how parents feel at a restaurant when their kid orders something and then proclaims "I don't like it, give me chicken nuggets".
---
Maybe these will come with the "camp" upgrades discussed above?
---
New lows!
---
&gt;Bam and half of your stuff will be gone
---
can't wait especcialy since im a new struggling player
---
Given the amount of people angry at them, I'm pretty sure they won't last one hour if they don't make private servers for their streams :3
---
These day's it's usually Whitesprings, Enclave, Lewisburg, R&amp;G, Watoga, Harpers Ferry. Before I switched to melee, and before I started going to Lucky Hole for lead, I used to go further west, hitting up Flatwood and Sutton vendors and the motel for lead, and making a quick dip down to Charleston firestation for lead as well.
---
Pffft, I already spawn in the water. Free diseases, bro!
---
I agree however the money they make in ESO with micro transactions should have been enough but it never is or its greed or whatever. 
---
I didn't lead an assault with Liberty Prime just for Communism to win in the end.  F that crap of fixed prices.
---
So you're telling me they're the only company that can't sort out duped items in a timely manner?
---
Any news on Shadowed Combat mods? I've heard Grafton, Watoga and/or BoS, but hundreds of relogs determined that was a lie.
---
Yeah. I would mind. But it’s not the end of the world. The economy would be reset. 
---
My added condition would be to check the count per-player. Only players with more than two or three items on the list would lose theirs. The lucky farmers and one-time buyers would be safe.
---
He did have pacifist enabled.  Reactive Plates on your PA or having the Shock Mutation will STILL damage a person who gives you slap damage via melee.  That person will then continue to hit you until they die.  You are now WANTED and all their teammates kill you for the bounty.  ReSpawn-&gt;Repeat.   
---
I like your attitude.  
---
I'm someone who also enjoys most games for what they are. Nothing is perfect. I never played a game I would rate "perfect". Even the ones I consider my absolute favourites.  
---
So yeah, as long as I can have fun playing this game, having my little moments of joy, I'm happy.
---
Lol. That's a bit extreame.
---
Stupid Bethesda, didn't you know we expected 1000? good bye letter entailing on how much I defended you iiiiiiinc
---
Can you send me a DM with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) name and loadout?
---
I'd suggest you reread my previous comment. It's pretty obvious that i wouldn't care if half my shit got deleted since i got  backupweapons i farmed myself. When i said elitist, i'm talking about people like you that completly disregard the fact that a lot of people actually farmed for their end-game gear, just like you and other players did, and might lose it because someone sold them duped shit. A lot of people are innocent and will get upset about losing their stuff which they bought with good intent, without any knowledge of what happend to those weapons.
---
Not everyone selling things has 10000x the same weapon in their inventory. I only started trading after they fixed the dupe exploit, didn't even have caps back then lol. 
---
So basically you want one completely new Fallout game every week? 
---
or...you keep playing while enjoying yourself, while simultaneously NOT complaining the game sucks now....
---
it took me 130hrs of play but i legit got a tse laser pistol of a super mutant at the munitions factory..
---
But that would be a mod...?
---
Who said "it just works" and in what context? Show me where this comes from please.
---
Oooh. Forgot about the frog legs. They'd pair well with the Cajun popcorn.
---
It's there.
---
:O
---
Meanwhile I could have people legit singing over their mics on Xbox. Half the time it’s not even good music either, just shitty rap or hip hop.
---
Thanks man! I have 3 mules maxed out, all with unique items that i found myself. They are purely there for when we get a proper player vending/trading system. Again, i hope it is just the actual dupers that get nailed for this, not us traders. If someone has 100's/1000's of tse handmades, then that is obviously bs. Also, if we lose our potentially duped items, we should be somewhat compensated? They got my caps and then i lose said items. That would tip me over the edge.
---
thanks dude
---
Well, TSE nerf went a little too far.
---
Exlosive effect? Sure, OK that did need a nerf a little bit.
---
Two Shot? Well, on it's own it really isn't all that OP.
---
Mayhaps not allowing both effects on the same item, and a small nerf to explosive while leaving two shot alone would have been the better route?
---
&gt;Not really been waiting for the new downtime like crazy the servers were superlaggy the last days.
---
yeah i crashed like 5 times
---
Nothing beyond price of admission.  I do challenges to farm atoms and they really haven't released much that I want.
---
passing on a boatload of junk because I wanted to level in Whitesprings.
---
Technically it would but it would only change sounds and not effect gameplay 
---
Good call, 76 is the very last place I would come seeking competitive PvP that isn't a broken pile.
---
\#You're acting like these were hidden little bugs.#
---
Big or small, dont care, still enjoyed the games, didnt exploit myself
---
\#They could have looked at the top downloads of their games' nexus mod pages where they were fixed with unofficial patches.#
---
ahhh yes, and that they could have, could have paid the developers of the patches for the fixes to be rolled into the game, cant disagree there.
---
\#You're whiteknighting Bethesdas decision to release a game that wasn't nearly ready and then charge 60$ for it.#
---
Actually, I paid top cash for the power armour edition, and yet... I actually come to expect bugs and things from any Bethesda game, some of them really make me laugh.
---
\#Then  you're blaming players for cashing in on Bethesdas laziness. If there's  a way to cheat in any multiplayer game, it will be utilized whether you  like it or not. It's the job of the dev team to tests for these kinds  of things BEFORE release.#
---
Then shame on all those Dishonest players!
---
Shame on you all, maybe playing fairly is no fun for you, so I have no sympathy for them having all their ill gotten gains removed, pure and simple.
---
\#They can't do that when their game is releasing in Alpha Early Access and they don't have time.#
---
They actually released the game early, it wasn't really BETA at that point, had it been I suspect it would have had a tad more issues removed.
---
\#I have a feeling you don't have any experience in game development/production.
---
Any  QA team would have warned Beth about a large number of the problems  they're facing right now. The company went ahead anyway knowing the  state of the game.#
---
Ahhh dodging my question I see, but then again my point stands.
---
I do have experience in this field. And yes some of this should have been dealt with, but again, if you don't understand how this stuff works, its all black magic to the end user.
---
Agreed. We really need more information.   
---
I am worried something I might of traded for might of been duped. Most the items I paid for made since on the price of CAPs. 3K for this weapon... Sure. Seems reasonable.   
---
So now I am over here like... Well am I about to get F-ed over because of something I traded for. I did not know this item was duped. The dealer seemed to have a reasonable gamertag name and score.    
---
Someone brought up a good point. Again what if it was a trade of a trade of a trade. Person A Duped it &gt; Sold it to Person B for 1K &gt; Then I bought it for 3K. Again I feel like I am about to get screwed. Because how the heck would I have known it was duped 2 or more trades back.   
---
I feel like a lot of people are about to be screwed over. I have to be like. Well F-me. Am I right?  
---
Can you tell it’s been a while since I played haha. I forgot you can change the colour, that’s another point in the good books!
---
Add me to the list of people who’ve spent real money in the Atom Shop. I’m old and have disposable income; I want to show support for the game; I like decking my camp out, and I like some of the craftable outfits, so why not?
---
Every good weapon in this game is duped. If you own a good weapon, it’s duped. Are you people this retarded? How do you not get this?
---
If items were unique and trackable they probably could have patched out duping altogether, or at least made it much harder.
---
Servers are almost always ALOT better after downtime. So atleast when you get on it should be more stable for a few days. :)
---
That's what support says. Which is odd considering that in FO4, which FO76 is literally built upon, players could reset their own quest by using the console. On PC, that is. They say they can't do it because they don't have the manpower to handle the thousands and thousands of requests for support requests like these.
---
Same thing for being unable to restore items. The database is server side, how does the company that owns the game and maintains their servers not have the tools to run a database query and fix inconsistencies? 
---
Also Bethesda, 
---
&gt; **Stash Limit Increase to 800** 
---
Seen here on the new [Inside The Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019)! Increase coming next week.
---
Very very solid patch. I really like the small insight into the new PVE content. 
---
" Try a Nuke zone without pacifist "
---
He says he didn't have it enabled.
---
" before I just said fuck it and turned pacifist mode "
---
He turned it on.  No more problem.
---
50/50? Either way it's gonna be hilarious
---
I had collected a couple of t-60 calibrated shocks for a friend. Then proceeded to have them ate by the scrapping bug. Which I was fully aware of.
---
Then I did it again. That's 4x t-60 calibrated shocks that got scrapped. Not even enough steel to kill one super mutant.
---
While I agree that the removal of duped items is a good thing for the most part.  You could try to be a little less aggressive.  I get that there is a lot of anger towards the actual dupers (as they deserve) and I even got quite a few laughs at the old duper hunting posts that several people made, but is there really any reason to be this negative towards people who bought items that were duped if they really didnt know?
---
Now sure, with the rampant duping that went on many players would suspect that a certain weapon or item might be duped but unless they are in on it and were specifically told that it was a dupe then they didn't really know for sure.  
---
Im sure people like WalruskiBlyat are also very angry at the dupers.  They aren't saying that they think the players who "legit farmed their weapons" are the problem either.  They are just expressing concern over what may or may not happen to items they purchased.  Unfortunately to completely purge the duped items you have to get all of the duped items, even ones that were unknowingly purchased.  It really is a crap situation for the people that are truly innocent but received duped items without knowing of it.
---
What I am more concerned about is whether this will go as planned or if this patch will screw with legit inventory as well by accident.  If previous patches have been able to reintroduce bugs that had been fixed at one point Im sure that it is entirely possible to accidentally wipe more than just actual duped items.
---
I am of the belief, supported by some small programming knowledge, that the unique ID's of the dupers who MADE the items will be attached to those weapons and they might end up having a VERY bad day....or at least I HOPE that I am correct.
---
Sorry “weekly updates “ , something comes out this week, goes away, something new comes out the folllowing week, rinse repeat.
---
I’m most excited for the new CAMP content. My fingers are crossed for robot crafting.
---
I mean.... online games from much smaller companies have infinite storage.
---
They’re just whining 
---
Oh I expect a ton of people to quit if they're going to lose they're duped items. Good riddance imo. Next, let's sack all the idiots at Bethesda that allowed duping to be a thing in the first place.
---
Got it for free.
---
they should of all said some thing about mutations becauce im afraid they havent properliy fought about dupped mutations that have already been used by player
---
30 bucks to buy the game. And I just farm atoms. 
---
I think they will delete the duplicate item minus 1. In that way if you have a single weapon left you're not crying like a little baby....
---
Spot on.  But I believe they are only removing bulk item inventories, and reddit has created a narrative where they are deleting a single gun from someone’s inventory.  But they never said that.
---
Is that today or next week?
---
see!  i said, "i do not care what your initial investment was."  yet 3 of ya thought, lets ignore that and post our initial investment.  unreal!
---
Survival mode will supposedly be out this month. PVP is a great reason to grind for gear. For those that play this strictly for the pve aspect lets hope Bethesda gives us that road map everyone has been asking for. Honestly in my opinion Bethesda should strictly work on fixing glitches, exploits and server stability before they worry about adding any new content. It is perfectly ok to quit and come back for the expansions if your bored of end game or simply dont want to grind gear all over again. 
---
lol, if you quit because you lost a single wepaon that a scum bag scammer sold you, you are one fragile snow flake :(
---
Cool, pull up a chair. Want some popcorn?
---
These people also cried that Bethesda should "un-fix" the carry weight glitch because *that's the only thing that made the game fun for them*.
---
It’s not. Over reaction central is hard at work as usual. They are removing duped items.
---
who?
---
pre-ordering
---
Gods honest truth.
---
I don't see any plans to fix CAMP griefing for Pacifist players unfortunately.  So Bethesda is not really listening to our feedback regarding CAMPs.  Please add the slap damage to non PvP CAMPs, its badly needed.
---
The game engine is over 20 years old (although heavily modified) so there's no surprise here.
---
uffff that stash increase is lovely
---
Very cool- I'd love it if the CAMP updates could possibly allow players to show off cool armor/ weapons in a way that is not stealable. 
---
Just my two cents!
---
I dunno, maybe realise it’s a video game and get on with your day?
---
Yes the [CAUTION] bug is VEEEEERY annoying! Renders quite a few things useless. Stealth. Healing Factor. Fast Travel.
---
They are just saying that 80% of player trades have been duplicated items and Bethy is taking them.
---
Yes! This!
---
hahaha
---
That is how roadmaps work in every game. They give you a general direction. Not a blow by blow of exactly what they are going to make.
---
You're so cute. You still think im playing LOL!
---
MMO speak for "Plans"
---
Last one, got to the end of the silo and grabbed my phone to go on Nuka Crypt. ‘’Fuck mate codes just reset’’ whoopsie.
---
maybe the guy doesn't meet any griefers because he is one lol
---
Next week.
---
yeah, i bought them right when i bought the game.  now i realize i really did not have to, as i got well over 5000 atoms.  which is not much, as i have seen people with 11k or more on youtube.
---
The game has hundreds of glaring flaws to choose from.
---
Say you had that one really great weapon and you dropped some other weapons because the limited carry weight the game offers. Now you lose your main weapon due to lazy patching. You still have to deal with unbalanced mobs and horrible glitches. 
---
It is the final straw thing.
---
Yes, of course!
---
“Thanks Bethesda for making sure all the other players suck as bad as I do”
---
Well worst case I'm out two tse weapons and 3k in caps. My dbl barrel TS does more damage than a tse pump with 3* of demolition. With 4 it finally does more but not not by a massive margin. I miss the pre nerf gun.
---
Like which game? 
---
Most of my 3* items came from vendors. Nothing's best-in-slot though, so it's probably all safe. I think my only sentinel piece is raider-quality.
---
you mean Dey Tuk Muh Goons
---
Personally, I haven't played since November and have been waiting for things to be fixed up - this is the first step that has pushed me to install again! Cheers, Bethesda 👍🏽
---
Can we take a second to appreciate the complexity of removing duped items?   
---
That kind of programming to identify duped items (unless it's just based on stacks in your inventory) seems like a crazy undertaking.   
---
I deleted the game a while back. And the only BACKLASH you're gonna experience is WHEN bethesda implements this shitty patch and fucks something else up...
---
Im not un subbing from this place because I enjoy watching it crumble.
---
 I heard a guy “singing” along to ‘I need a hero’.
---
 You know who you are, Sir.
---
Hell yes. I believe in all of this.
---
You should recommend it on Bethesda’s Forums they’re always looking for new ways to slap a price tag on a skin, icon, etc. Maybe someday soon custom sounds or new songs will pop up - 200 atoms a pop boi !
---
If something is broken it doesn't work.  Since FO76 works it's not broken.  It has bugs, as do all other pieces of software, but they do not make it unplayable, since people play it.
---
I am impressed by your dedication to the idea that *you* get to decide what is good and bad.
---
All I found was this stick after the purge... Maybe it’ll do well in combat?
---
why go there is there some thing about casual players
---
I highly doubt: they'll fuck this up
---
That is why we can't have nice things.
---
For updates, restarts, cache issues, etc.
---
They aren't going through a list of users and working restore requests, especially when they don't have a means to see if you're lying about it or not. 
---
Anyone can claim to have lost anything, I doubt Bethesda has a serious way to validate that
---
I have to admit that - for a brief moment - my heart stopped when i saw the notification for your reply pop up.  
---
This must be my lucky day &lt;3
---
The game is absolutely not designed fine lol. If a solution to an issue is to stop playing and select a different server then there’s absolutely a design issue. 
---
All they have to do is add an option to completely opt out of all pvp to or from you, or make it so that you can’t constantly be revenged or forced into combat by people walking in front of your shots. 
---
Pacifist mode should negate all incoming player damage to you. Easy fix. The solution should never be to quit and rejoin a game, that’s poor design. 
---
If anything, implement a separate high level area with high tier loot similar to the dark zone in the division or the wilderness in runescape where there’s no option to pacifist mode
---
I would welcome this, never eat anything else.
---
That’s pretty much what I did too with my Dragon.  I motioned to him to back off but he was ranting about me stealing his caps from the vendor.  As if that actually happens.  He’s pinging me with a low level .44 and I’m like uh, OK dude.  He was trying to stir the pot. 
---
Hecc yes
---
Fake news. 
---
what do you mean
---
Who is saying this?   Sometimes I wonder if off the wall questions like this are just people trying to start rumors and controversy themselves.  
---
&gt;I'm the wrong because the stuff I bought got deleted
---
your logic is flawless
---
Youre probably thinking of different people. People have a wide variety of opinions
---
I like how you assumed I've cheated. Never have and I don't tolerate cheaters. I just don't think Bethesda is innocent in the slightest here. I'm glad it's finally getting fixed. A bit too little too late imo. 
---
Not knowing early on that you had to inspect 2 and 3* legendaries to find out all effects. By early on I mean like the first 70 levels. I'm certain I dropped some good gear simply because I didn't like the first effect and didn't know to inspect it to find out what the other two were. Doh.
---
Interesting that there is no official announcement within the inside the vault about dupe deletion. Not everyone reads their forums that play this game. Would have been nice to even mention it for regular folks heading to their website for announcements or updates especially during the down time. 
---
i am getting down voted already!! ha ha ha!
---
The issue is that people hoard stuff they absolutely do not need.
---
Obviously it would be better that they were allowed to hoard as much as they'd want to but that's not possible.
---
I'm certain most if not all people can trash a good 50% of their chem and junk.
---
Beta progress carried over, there are no achievements for the beta. So what your data *actually* tells us is that 12.1% of players started during the beta AND haven't made a second character 
---
Does next week's patch include energy weapon balancing?
---
You posted your initial investment too right at the start!
---
pass along our thanks please! Get rid of the dupers and duped items!
---
Just the initial $60 + tax for the pre-order.. ATOMS are free, so I haven't spent anything in real $$ amounts
---
So a move in hinder cheaters and a make it unprofitable to exploit was the final straw? Yikes-a-roonie. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Happened to me last night at the Gulper Event in Watoga. Took me (lvl 61) and a lower lvl forever to take them down, first because I don't have anything better than guns I've made myself and being the first time I'd fought one, i couldn't concentrate fire enough to bring it down before having to defend from one of the others. Once we finally did bring the 3\* Legendary down, there was nothing but common junk and a non star wood arm. Was totally not worth the ammo/ stim pack i went through to be sure, but it was still an accomplishment
---
Lol. People are going to be upset when they lose weapons they bought for 10k or more without knowing it was duped. 
---
Ug-Qualtoth, the cult has been introduced to us in Fallout 3, Point Lookout DLC was almost exclusively around that cult, Fallout 4 have traces of it as well, &gt;!and now, in Fallout 76, traces of this cult are litteraly everywhere, pre-war &amp; post-war!&lt;
---
I'm playing it now because where I'm currently at has internet that is way too slow to play FO76 without constantly wondering if it crashed because: Bethesda or if it crashed because: literally dial up speed internet. Changing the color is definitely a point in the good book. Just a shame I can't change it to purple. At least not without downloading a mod. 
---
I’ve never bothered with scorched earth and I only nuke the crashed space station, you assumed that I’m one with the meta, and I’m not 
---
$0 and nothing
---
Same! I had a few explosive weapons or ones with awesome effects that I only discovered at level 90 something. I cant imagine how much I had tossed at that point. 
---
I'm a trader - farm events and nuke zones to collect and sell items.  I can honestly say that I've never sold a duped item because I farm everything I sell.  And the proof is that I've never sold a Meta item - no 3\* Bloodied or TSE, etc.  
---
But....(yes there is always a but)…I have to spend the caps on something.  So I have bought TSE's and other items (never for sale - just use and collection).  Are some (all?) duped - probably.  But how do I know?  I guess you could go with the - if it's any good then it probably is duped and you shouldn't buy - but even dog food, stimpaks, etc are being duped.  
---
If at any time Bethesda can come in and clear out my inventory - what incentive do I have to trade at all?  And if I can't trade in a game, I really don't play it.  My 'fun' is buying and selling - did it in WoW, Eve Online, ESO, etc.  Playing the game was a method to have fun and collect inventory to have more fun.
---
Will trading die - doubtful.  But it was pretty sick already with most dealers not accepting caps.  This change probably won't help - but hopefully I'm wrong.
---
&gt;forget the initial investment in the game, what you paid for it, in my case, $60.  
---
&gt; i have spent an additional $20 on atoms for the atom shop.  so i am in for a total o f $80 so far.
---
You kindof broke  your own rule in the original post, since you listed the total amount INCLUDING your initial cost
---
Possibly talking about 3* assassin gear. I get lots of 1* n 2* assassin gear but hardly any 3* armor at all or 3* weapons for that matter. If you’re playing PvE no real need for assassin gear unless you’re some one worried about griefing.  
---
Just banning people over weight solves nothing in the long run you clueless fuck. 
---
The point of duping shit was to sell it. The fucking problem wasn't the dupers with their stacks and stacks of fucking weapons, the problem was the fact they were spreading that shit around as quickly as they could sell it. Banning an overweight duper doesn't change the fact that their customers are running around in full assassin sentinel sets. Removing those duped items does. 
---
Falling in a cave unprepared and getting hammered in 2 seconds by deathclaw...
---
I think you may be on to something about the night thing now that you mentioned it. And the fast travel thing is more of a "false positive" I guess. What I mean by that is, I usually chk my status by crouching before attempting to fast travel. So if I get caution or danger I'm going to go seek out what is causing it, so I can fast travel. So I guess it's a me thing, lol. It may not technically be stopping me from fast traveling, but my OCD is lol.
---
I feel like someone doesn't understand sarcasm
---
This would definitely have been the preferred solution.  They let it sit so long that it is now going to hurt way more than just the dupers or those who knowingly purchased duped items.
---
Logical fallacy up I hurr
---
I want shelves with items on them (that you can't remove) to make a place seem more lived in.
---
No please save the frogs 🐸 eat deathclaw instead 
---
Please have a lazer weapon fix soon! 
---
So you don't care, and started trading after they fixed the dupe exploit? Ok, go play! And people who FARMED for their end-game gear AREN'T going to lose it, so no idea what you are talking about there....And I guess it sucks that the whole 90 people who didn't know they bought duped gear are going to have to go farm for a few days. No, wait, it doesn't! People might be forced to fight the Queen again instead of just buying a cheap god-gun, which means 12 OTHER PEOPLE are going to all get Queen drops every time, and events/nukes might see a good increase in use! This will be nothing but beneficial to the health of the game and community, and arguing otherwise because of a terribly small percentage of people who legit didn't know they bought duped items is like not bandaging a gaping wound because it might sting a little.
---
For me it feels like a step down.  They used to (currently) work with Shotgun perks, but switching them to Big Guns is a downgrade in my opinion.  Mehn.  I can adapt but it's unfortunate.
---
Buying the game 
---
My apologies.  I thought you were replying to Tschmack when he/she said "[–]WeCanDanseIfWeWantTo 8 points an hour ago 
---
My favorite pvp encounter was trying to buy something in watoga station, only to have 4 guys try to initiate combat with me. I ignored them, until they started meleeing me, triggering my shock mutation. This damaged the melee guy, allowing the rest of the team to kill me with tse guns."
---
 never spent on ebay.
---
People don’t play with things they don’t secretly enjoy. Not even the masochists among us. There no magic #, merely observed behaviors 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
Nothing
---
$0 and I won't know until the servers are back up.
---
Fucking nothing. Fuck Bethesda, fuck their inability to create a working game, and fuck the atom shop 
---
Cool youve branded your upadates, and theyre approved by corporate. You smut be so proud. cant wait to know WTF YOURE TALKING ABOUT
---
But I was told I couldn't criticize the game if I hadn't played it. Now if I play the game, I can't criticize it?
---
Please tell me what the magic gameplay time window during which I'm legally allowed to criticize the game is
---
Who the fuck buys weapons for real money on Ebay? I'm glad they lost out.
---
I haven't seen it yet. But I'll ping you if I do.
---
Do you have the targeting HUD by any chance? Someone discovered that they're glitched (along with berry mentats), and the effect is actually passed on to all other players and enemies in the area, which results in enemies occasionally being able to sense you through walls.
---
Anecdotally, the only time I've seen that happen was when my friend ate a berry mentats and suddenly I had the "pink glow" effect as well, so I know for a fact that the effect spreads to other players in the area.
---
same.  i really would like some camo for my sniper rifle though.
---
Only with cheating.
---
Also, what's the point of a survival game if I have infinite stuff stored? What am I surviving from, then?
---
 Bethesda: *Applies fix.* 
---
...
---
&gt; Stash Limit Increase to 800...
---
Well, I was living within the 600lb limit, but I'll take it!
---
LOL!  That's what I have been saying since the first week.  I figured it out when I noticed how easy it was to kill super mutants with a super sledge, despite have zero points invested in melee. 
---
One way to find out.
---
dupped items are being removed. And may be removed again in the future. Which means you can never trade again and not risk having the thing you bought removed. Since you can never know if you are sold a duped item or not. 
---
(and the "well if you bought a TSE for 100 caps it was a dupe!" thing is dumb, since someone could just sell it for 200,000 caps to make you think it's real and you'll just be out even more)
---
Nothing because I’m not a gullible idiot. 
---
for reference only.  did you read what was before that?  my guess, is no.
---
People complain about everything nowadays.
---
That *could* be a matter of stock. The vendor might be sold out on that server. I'm not 100% sure on that though. 
---
I was using a heavy weapon firing at her flying and moving around and the dude tried to run along. I used my jet pack to avoid him as much as I could, mostly successfully. The problem isn't not damaging the asshole, but it stopping me from damaging the queen. The problem is it's just annoying and this game doesn't need more annoying. 
---
Well unless it’s Minecraft and you pay diamonds for a enchanted book with Fortune 3 unbreaking 4 and efficiency 3
---
I've been wondering this myself. 
---
I know all of my weapons and armor are legit because I got them myself, but early on I did something nice for somebody and drop them some water when they asked for it and had left my workshop completely open for everyone to get whatever they needed from. 
---
He dropped me two serum recipes after taking the water and using the various  crafting tables and extractors and I picked them up and used them. 
---
I had no idea how rare those were until I had fought the scorchbeast queen a couple dozen times and finally got one myself Weeks Later.
---
If I lose those two I will not be upset, carnivore and eagle eyes.
---
My first and second deaths were by cliff, the first accidental, the second trying to retrieve my body bag half way down.
---
lol, what a jackass.  english a 2nd language for you?
---
Video games are life!!! LOL joking 
---
Without the duped head, moo-moo would only be moo, I find this to be something universally obvious.
---
Alrighty, this is actually pretty awesome. Those PvE content updates sound really neat. Getting some of that hope back.
---
Real question: is there a new method again? The last time I played (month or so ago) I thought it waa completely eliminated already.
---
Or am i totally wrong.
---
I bought some rare Pokémon cards back in the day. Years ago, when at college, for whatever reason, my Mom throws them in the trash without telling me. 
---
I bring it up every now and then.. still stings a bit.
---
&gt;Because assholes like you were just whining that you can't criticize the game if you hadn't played it.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;So please, enlighten me: tell me what the magical window is between for playing too little Fallout 76 and too much, in order to criticize it. Because it's just as mystifying as Todd Howard's internal logic
---
More than 0 and less then 500, apparently
---
If you haven't played the game, your complaints are at best simply misinformed and at worst literal shilling
---
If you've played 500 hours and are pretending this game is bad, or the worst game ever, or boring.... you might just be a bit stupid
---
That only works if Bethesda chooses item prices, which would be awful. 
---
Done. As I've said in the message, I'm not sure about the loadout as the game is offline right now but it happens to all weapons BUT Melee or Unarmed. 
---
It's because you'll never truly know if that top tier item you've traded for will be erased by future anti-dupe patches. If any duped items get through or any items are duped and traded in the future then they will be at risk until they are eventually erased. That TSE and unyielding such and such armour? It could be gone next week.
---
$100 on my TSE Rolling pin.  Not really...  One can dream
---
*oopsie doopsie
---
I have had an issue with my friends list for a while I decided to msg support about it finally but they have been getting back to me hourly as we tried different solutions
---
One time atom purchased,  the biggest pack. 
---
Mostly for the camp objects
---
On the opposite end of that i'd like to be able to mark something for scrap and have it then be moved into it's own tab so as soon as i get to a workbench i can scrap it all instantly, it keeps the weapons and armor tab clean and only full of your favorites, and on top of that it would save spending a lot of time comparing stats so you pick it up, look at it, compare it quickly, then decide if you wish to keep it, drop it, or mark it for scrap.
---
Great news.
---
Isn't the engine only responsible for the front end development of the game though? The database and backend is not directly affected by it so its pretty hard to speculate exactly what is going to happen unless we know the full scope of their infrastructure. 
---
obviously, english is a 2nd language for you too.
---
Be more of a square jerk or rectangle jerk 
---
And heavy! My rocket launcher should not be beaten by a musket. 
---
Eyeroll.... whatever you have to tell yourself 
---
TLDR: Not everyone is like you. You feel you have to write an essay about it.
---
first people say they hate duping! now they say they hate half assed attempts to fix duping! make up your mind!!!
---
It almost sounds nice, compared to the vast empty world we currently have.
---
LOL, I just recently cut back playing this game. Im 120+ so throw your judgment at someone else. I love the fallout series but 76 was a major mess up by Bethesda. The things they "fixed" should have been fixed before release. But people so blinded like you thinking Bethesda is innocent and good for patching 76 is fine by me. You dont want to admit that a patch ago reverted a bunch of fixes, but they are improving the game. I dont mind a difference of opinion.
---
its  so strange on how almost everyone knows how to make serums huh ;)
---
Anyone freaking out about this needs to be in therapy.
---
What
---
Since the last patch:
---
* [Caution] and [Danger] sometimes are stuck on - even with nothing around.  This breaks the stealth mechanics (health regen, mob aggro, etc).
---
* 3-star legendaries have their health completely regenerate during combat - sometimes twice.
---
* Enemies sometimes will initially not take any damage at all.  This seems to happen more to ghouls that haven't had a chance to "stand up" yet when you first run across them.
---
* Bulked items can be scrapped when you do a "Scrap all junk"
---
* If I log out at my camp, most of the time I fall through the world the first time I log in.
---
* Sometimes enemies are completely invisible and dealing me damage when I first log in and spawn in a combat zone.
---
* The Marsupial mutation nerfs itself mid-game if I had Rad Worms, but then either cured them or recovered naturally.
---
* Sometimes new blast zones do NOT convert the local flora to flux-variants.
---
* Please. Fix. The. Slay. Bells. Sounds.  I actually wrote a ticket on this one:  190201-002619.
---
Honestly, I had stopped taking a list of things I ran into in the game, because I hadn't gotten much to anything I've ever brought to Bethesda's attention on here.  If they are actually being read, let me know, and I'll resume reporting them.  If not, well, I'm not going to keep spamming.
---
Platform:  XB1, GT:  AlpineYJ
---
Any good weapon you have is duped. 
---
&gt; a bug literally means there is a thing that doesn't work... it's broken, therefore objectively bad. 
---
There is no software in the world that doesn't contain bugs, especially no video game software.
---
So according to you all video games are "objectively bad".
---
I can't see the point of your classification system.
---
Just admit it, you have some kind of psychological problem that makes you uncomfortable when people like things you don't like.
---
I've always though it was funn-- a good funny.
---
Players who have used an exploit to dupe items, **or acquired duped items from other players,** may find those items removed from their accounts once maintenance is complete. 
---
[Source](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/upcoming-maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
That bold part of the sentence is why there is confusion.
---
Destiny had already given some ideas to the devs, so it was easier to map 2. This is Bethesda's first online game, with a new studio, who are possibly not quite experienced. 
---
120$
---
Highly regret it
---
$0
---
Thank you for typing out what i was trying to explain. My English is limited and this just sums it up perfectly! 
---
And the point of this post was m? To brag about how your only level 39 with sucky weapons lol 
---
you call it a drug, i call it a life-enhancer ..... to each their own :)
---
From the dinosaurs that want to eat you....
---
With the amount of information given about roadmaps, new content, or anything at all, I'd expect to see detailed info around next century lol.
---
Neverwinter (18 Million Players) - extremely limited amount of storage "slots", even if you buy extra for real money.. never enough space
---
&gt;But you seem like a sad boy who needs to 
---
I dont need to do anything. Im not the one who replied to your own initial post.
---
But hey if there is some underlying problem you need to talk about, I can be your safe space LOL!!!!!!!!!!
---
Priceless lol
---
&gt;Some of the “fans” of the Fallout series have tried really hard to ruin FO76 for others.
---
Todd Howard did that already.
---
Im on pc, oof.
---
just babies trying to shit post the reddit in to a frenzy
---
No.... you get infinite storage wo th out cheating at all. That was silly. Also, I'm an ideal survival game you aren't capped at how well you can survive and fo76 isn't really a survival game. You can't die from hunger, thirst, or disease nor do you have to build a camp or craft anything if you dont want to. Terrible response.
---
Shhh, dont let the fools know duping is still happening.  LoL
---
I consider myself a fairly neutral bystander (having not played in the last month or two due to getting bored after completing the story) so Im wondering why you appear to be trying to intentionally make people angry for no other reason than you simply want to do so.  Are you really this upset over the duping or is it that you get enjoyment out of provoking people?
---
Yes, above you 
---
hmmm I bought a power armor bundle that was damaged and possibly missing items for 100.00 ( I already had the game at this point but really wanted the power armor helmet , I passed the extra copy of the  game on to a friend ) 
---
hmmm in regards to the atom shop I usually drop a few dollars every week since I started playing in November. 
---
Like they'll tell you.
---
I’m just gonna go out on a limb and say no matter what game I play, if I’m 500 hours (21 full days) deep, I’m lying if I say I don’t like it. 
---
Bought a TSE for 5 dollars. Sold several duped TSE and made profit. 
---
i bought a new control board for my washing machine last month about 70 bucks. i lost nothing.
---
I feel the same way as you my friend. I've been addicted to this game since getting it for Christmas. Its all I've been playing, and when I'm not playing I'm thinking about getting out of work to play some more! I do acknowledge the games issues but I've been having such a blast in spite of the problems. Its been great meeting the community members who enjoy the game as much as I do.
---
Around 500$
---
Bought some Jerry's Nuggets, 1st V1s and SS13 Virts.
---
This guy gets it! 
---
Cool, I love the game too. I play with friends almost every day but, I can still laugh at a funny post. 
---
Word of advice, don't take things like this too seriously in life, none of us have enough time on this planet to waste doing that. 
---
You're telling me that after 3 months of Bethesda saying this was coming, telling us dupers and duped items would eventually be banned and deleted, you had no time to do anything about it? No time to use those over-powered weapons and gear to go farm mobs for legit ones? No time to sell them off? 
---
1. I don't believe it
---
2. Hope you got your money's worth out of 3 months with cheat equipment!
---
I bought a new drain pump. Worked great for I cycle then the tub bearing went out:( Scratch and dent Lowe’s $400 = really clean laundry. 
---
No game will last indefinitely. In time the player base diminishes for every game, and nothing will ever surpass World of Warcraft in our life time which even WoW is falling. Don’t fool yourself.  The FO76 player base is slim as it is. There has been too great of damage for them to recover. The only way they can plausibly bounce back is maybe after they launch new content and genuinely eliminate ALL exploits-combined with a brand new advertising installment.  Otherwise don’t expect this game to outlast 2019, there are too many good, real AAA games coming out this year as it is and this will diminish the player base even more.
---
Nope!  Uninstalling if half my crap is gone today.
---
There are many symptoms, but duplication is a symptom of a larger problem is remains to be resolved, lack of damage progression for Casuals who play Fallout 76 like an online shooter and aim down sights.
---
Nah. I'll give him that. Numbers have dropped of some. I think a lot of things account for that. 
---
Whenever I am near a relay tower I request an airdrop that I never intend to open.
---
I read it as each week they’ll add something on top of what they introduced the previous week.
---
Yeah, I guess we shall find out soon enough what they meant. I wonder how difficult its going to be to filter through all these upcoming posts that are going to be innocent players or dupers posing as innocent people.
---
 (stealth edited that post a little by the way)
---
For the first one - irritating.  If it's intended, then it should be mentioned so folks (other than me) stop reporting it.  People bring it up all of the time.
---
For the second one - I don't believe that is right.  I *can* fast travel when things get stuck like that.  If I were actually in [Caution] or [Danger], I would not be able to fast travel.
---
Excellent. What a great ITV.
---
But I'm playing Hoarders : Fallout edition!
---
Every time someones references her in Reddit I pick up and keep more junk in the game and yes it does spark joy in my heart.
---
Theres not much left for Austin to accidentally break
---
I feel that there will be a lot of lost weapons, even among those bought from vendors as that was a dupe glitch as well. I will sorely miss my 3* power fist, or the potential lose of a TS .50 prime I have, both bought in Watoga, but this game needed this to be done.    
---
3 hrs in, so hopefully soon
---
Well, in that respect. PvP still is broken. 
---
bullshit if they wanted a economy they already fucked up by giving the ultracite plans away a common hot pick for trading
---
It’s a challenge, so it’s under the “challenges” in the in game menu. 
---
I concur with your statement that getting legendary drops at a lower seems level seems easier (I think that I mentioned it as well). I cannot comment on seeded legendary drops.
---
I would propose that headshots (and one-shotting in general) are not rewarded (at high levels) because there is little risk involved (the same could be said for conservative SBQ play).
---
the disconnect is probably that support cant see what YOUR specific inventory is. 
---
but at the database level your player/character id is just another column of data for that item, so the developers are able to run scripts such as this as a whole against the entire data set, while its down and no active changes are being made to that data. 
---
lol, and true :)
---
If i notice other players i get out my tagging gun and only use my big gun when in great danger,lol
---
800 S.T.A.S.H.
---
"Gods be praised."
---
hahaha, what? What does that have to do with anything I said? You literally broke your own rule in your initial post.. I Quoted you, so even if you try to edit it out, people will see it. By the way you are acting, it looks like everyone in this entire thread MUST be wrong.... 
---
Firstly, the trade steal exploit was proven to be made up. That doesn't happen.  Secondly, I doubt you'll lose the TSE you bought from that vendor. If it was just one at a vendor, it's likely not duped. Not saying it's impossible though. If you do lose it, I would agree you were wrongfully punished. Third, I agree completely that they fucked up the explosive nerf. They should have done it to the Legendary effect and not Explosives all together. 
---
Next up is the melee/bloodied/unyielding nerf.
---
And then the armor/effect limits.
---
&gt;I just tried and think to myself saying “oh I’m not doing anything wrong because it wasn’t me that duped it”
---
Honestly, buying a weapon that you know has been duped is just as bad as duping yourself. You unintentionally condone it.
---
I don't do microtransactions but at least atom shop items are supposed to contribute to future DLC.
---
That's what I'm trying to say. There's been at least two occasions where a guy's only been interested in trying to block me instead of shooting at the queen. I play in 3rd person and it's easy to see that it's not randomly passing in front of me, that happens all the time, it's people joining SBQ fights only firing a few shots at the queen to get part of the loot and then hoping for people to have not turned on pacifist so when they accidentally hit them they kill them and take their loot. This is something I've seen on more than one occasion. And yes I've killed the queen lots of times and have dumped more than 20 ultricite explosive vents...
---
Couldn't agree more. In all seriousness, even if my TSE pipe rifle was somehow collateral damage, I'd be fine with it because this seems like it is going to drastically help the overall health of this game.
---
What if I told you... they're not the same people? The sub-reddit has a hundred and seventy thousand users, it's not a singular organism. It's whatever wheels happen to be squeaking that day.
---
yeah but we dont know yet that Austin didnt 'accidentally' delete all explosive weapons, or all 2 shots, or all Combat shotguns or some fucked up thing. I mean theres a 50/50 chance we log in and Stimpaks dont work or something insane.
---
I like the game. So it's a pretty normal hobby. You're just stewing in hate and discontent. Kinda speaks volumes about your character. 
---
Shhhh don't issue challenges like that....
---
I hear way too many people with a hot mic in the game.
---
Not overly whipped up.

Probably. Sucks but I’m sure I’ll find another one eventually.
---
And some of them are ridiculous and deserve to be called out, yes.
---
About $15 on a used dildo. Only thing I lost was my dignity.
---
I wish dupers would have duped something I needed...like 50,000 Boiled Waters for cooking.
---
Problem is duping isn't fixed. They are just taking everyones stuff. This isn't a fix at all. This stuff that I know is duped I don't care a single bit about losing. The things I may potentially lose because I didn't know it was duped is completely different.
---
If you complain that living in the US is a total hellhole for you, has every opportunity to stop living there, and still decides to live there... then yeah, I'd say it's a valid rule.
---
No complaints from me about this getting fixed. Plenty of complaints from me about other bugs, but not this one.
---
Paid 10k for mine before duping got super rampant 
---
I’ve used it for awhile.
---
Pretty bad with two-handed melee if you’re a slower swinger. I use a swing-speed weapon and timed myself at 1 swing every second. That’s not enough to make it worth it. I keep rads but not a lot of Rads too. 
---
I use to use a swing-speed combat knife, here is where it shines. With how fast you swing, you can maybe get OG to activate 2-3 in a single fight with another player. 
---
It’s really good if you can get an enemy that doesn’t use marine armor or PA. 
---
Hope this helps
---
While I appreciate the thought of a live AMA while you play FO76, that chat is going to be infested with people spamming "DEAD GAME LOL" "WHO CARES" "THIS GAME IS BAD"
---
Hopefully some good mods will be there to support the channel
---
Super-Duper Duper-Scooper.
---
Now I really want a rolling pin that essentially explodes in your have whenever you melee someone
---
It's the same for me. Before it broke you literally could not fast travel while in Caution or Danger. Now, unless there are actually enemies around, you can FT, no matter what the stealth indicator says.
---
And yes, Legendaries regenerating health is a thing but, as you said, is never explained. One of the many things new, or old, players have to figure out on their own.
---
I feel like a divorced-parents child.  Which of the two Vault threads do I post in?
---
Xbox here, I have my mic on all the time and you would hear me talking to my dogs. There are a few players that I have talked with. I would think that having the mics is a whole new dimension to this game and the setting should be set to Area, no Team Chat (I think but my opinion). If you have one use it set it to area, if you don't have one, get one they aren't expensive. 
---
Wow, I didn’t know the trade exploit was a hoax! 
---
Glad to know I bought into the propaganda and hysteria. 
---
The more you know. Thanks for the reply! 
---
This was back before duplication existed but wasn't as rampant as it was a few weeks ago
---
Those are definitely duped.
---
I'd settle for a functional bobblehead display and magazine rack
---
Game is not back online.
---
server still says its off line to me :S
---
Or just add decoration that can not be moved. Basically like how the potted plants work.
---
So for many, many of us who have grinded caps to buy weapons which are now going to be removed will kill the game for sure. Keep the weapons release a new tier / star perhaps
---
seems to be alot less of a toxic environment.   
---
i know hard to imagine, but there are still some of us that actually enjoy playing the game, and dont go bat shit crazy over every bug or glitch.
---
Been playing since beta. Never traded with another player. Everything I've got I found, it dropped, or I bought from vendor bot. I have no worries. As it is, I have too many choices in my inventory. I try to keep a weapon on hand for most ammo and switch it up. 
---
I have the port a potty next to my field of corn and wheat.  Next to it is the fertilizer crafter. 
---
“Care for more me-poop soup, sir?”
---
That's a message you get when the servers are down for maintenance. I wouldn't worry about it while they're down.
---
Could be they are still down. I had this same error message happen on launch day.
---
I think the servers are just still down.
---
Nah, if you look at an actual map of the area, it's pretty close to where it should be. The Greenbriar is southeast of Charleston rather than almost due east like Whitesprings, but other than that the geography lines up pretty well.
---
Don't wear PA except the SBQ and no HUD, and never use berry mentats, just a recon, which is bugged out as well.
---
It's not funny though (to me).... I don't think you're understanding that. It is to you, that doesn't mean I find it funny. I'm not upset by it, I just don't see anything positive about posts like these. I don't take anything I see on the internet seriously.  
---
Fuck it, let's make every item purchasable. No one has time to grind for that stuff. /s
---
still down bud 
---
I can't be the only person to read that in a Mr. Handy voice...
---
It's still offline. It's hilarious that the launcher allows you to start the game only to kick you out again once you arrive at the main menu...
---
 Stash Limit Increase to 800  
---
I think that the issues with duppers have shown exactly how much weight or items interacts with server stability (I should note that all I have seen regarding dupers and stability have been on here)
---
I'll be damned.  I am nearing level 100, have invested many, many, many hours in the game since launch...and have never noticed challenges listed on the game menu.  Thank you!!
---
No money spent besides my tricentennial edition.  
---
I would have actually bought atoms if it weren’t for the kiddie fortnite shit they keep adding.   
---
lol :D
---
Yes... I'm concerned with what some random kid on the internet thinks about "my character". You can definitely tell what kind of person someone is based on how they react to a particular video game on reddit. Very good sir... you got me.... I have been defeated. Lol. K.
---
That sounds like a upcoming atomic shop item. 
---
Live streaming through Appalachia? Hope you guys get all that server stability under control! Seriously. Do that.
---
All those duped guns have to go somewhere 
---
I shudder to think about how much I’ve spent on plastic side covers for old motorcycles. Those things are worth a fortune.
---
If you didn’t mind survival mode in fallout 4 it’s basically that but online. The community has been the nicest I’ve ever encountered online. Similarly like others have said the bugs n glitches can be annoying but I’ve been playing with friends n solo since launch n enjoyed it more than battlefield V n RDRO. PvE &gt; PvP in my humble opinion. 
---
Is there a way to tell? Do locked items that are part of a claimed workshop identify as such somehow? That was most likely what happened since the power plant has a workshop.
---
I will personally set up a lounge base at whitesprings in order to sell overpriced stuff and watch the fun
---
Zero. . . But if I continue to like what I see content/patch wise, I'll gladly purchase some atoms if they get some stuff in the shop that I want.
---
That was a pretty good one.
---
I co-op with a friend, primarily.
---
Lol if I login and every legendary item I have is gone I'll be sad. It took me awhile to find my stuff. Oh well I'll craft a few guns and I'll be fine. Hahaha just hope I don't lose my power armor sets. It's be a pain in the ass to get more calibrated shocks :p
---
Furious, swing speed, power attack damage protrst sign when.
---
i enjoyed the game alot man i like playing this i got every thing i need for the futere of this video game unless this update remove alot of my stuff that i got that i didnt know was dupped
---
Maybe to have a way to see if items were obtained from people that have already been banned for duping?
---
&gt; I have been playing for months and the bugs in this game are not that bad. I played when Ultima Online launched and the lag was so bad you couldn’t hardly move. I played WOW at launch when the servers were so jacked up our guild had to move to a low population. 
---
I'm old too so I know it's hard to keep straight but it's not 1997 anymore.
---
So nothing?  You cheap fuck...I hope you get friction burn
---
Mine says it's online. But I think you are correct. I logged out of BNet and then back in. This caused my icon to show online. Just another BUG most likely.
---
If you print it big enough, it may scare them off at least :D
---
You're not entitled enough, check your privelage.
---
Where do you farm the combat armour? Or do you craft it?
---
Compared to previous Fallout titles with \[b\]unlimited\[/b\] storage, yes, 800 is still not enough.
---
put my furious handmade into a blue suitcase at a train station instead of a furious plasma pistol, then logged off.
---
shit dude my tub bearing is going too. but fuck it ill run it till it seizes.
---
Its a fan theory that the metal face asset and art deco statues are all tied to some cult. Its some "But thats just a theory, A GAME THEORY" shit. 
---
**Don’t forget that the railway rifle needs to be properly classified!**
---
Currently does not benefit from any weapon class perks. Would be nice to see it properly classified as either a rifle or heavy weapon. Whichever the team feels makes more sense
---
Solid sneak peak though. Excited for more stash space 
---
50€......
---
Oopsies doodle!!
---
lol, never tried that, how do they work on clocking assulatrons ? :D i might need to test it out,  :D
---
Hmm... i wounder if we could solo run the nuke silos with only a  protest sign  ?
---
Like 3? It was bad lol same mods and same stats, it was sad 
---
He's a dick.
---
Oh my god you talk so much shit for a guy with McChuggernaut as a username. Unlike some people who sit constantly refreshing Bethesda’s twitter I don’t keep up with every tad bit of information, and I only found out today, about this update, I am still not home, so I can’t get back to my Xbox. All I did was buy a couple guns off of some guys that didn’t look too bad at first, but now I see that the legendary effects seem too perfect. That’s all. I’m not a cheater. I did not dupe any guns. all I did was legally trade with other players for guns that looked really good. I don’t deserve punishment. Maybe they could delete the guns and then give me the caps I paid back to buy some legit guns.
---
I drop loot all the time to low level players fresh out of the vault. The game can be but tough (my opinion) until you really get the swing of things. I’ve read many times on here that others do the same. I also had others do the same for me when I was just a wee wanderer. Make sure you pass it forward!
---
Right but do you have to have stacks of that item for it to be removed? You could literally just have one gun and they could remove it due to it being duped in nature right?
---
30 bucks for the game. Nothing in the atom store since I consider MTX in non F2P games to be a plague that needs to go extinct.
---
Check out the icon beside Game Options. I just relogged in and mine is still red.
---
Especially after they kept saying “we can’t track individual items.”
---
If they don't take away my plans I can craft them for you lol.
---
Stepped just a little too close to where the nuke was going to hit. It looked kind of cool then suddenly I was a pile of ash. 
---
Saying its their first is asinine considering ESO and the fact that they are one of the largest companies in the field. If that wont get people on their teams who know what theyre doing then that entirely their own fault. They have absolutely 0 excuse at this point to be so utterly unprepared.
---
gently used.
---
Not that I'm aware, no. 
---
The only thing that you can do is try to be conscious of if you're in a workshop zone and if it's owned.
---
Almost makes me nostalgic to pull out my blockage runners, mount up with 10-20 billion in cargo and make my runs.
---
still nothing
---
Everything having to do with fallout 76 is extreme. It’s like the devs stay drinking mountains dew and snowboarding 
---
Not a penny spent, so nothing lost. 
---
I have the plans, getting the flux is the pain :) thanks though 
---
I just usually leave sirens.. and sometimes a bunch of toilets.
---
Aren't you complaining about other people's opinions on a video game right now?
---
Agreed.
---
if you buy it, buy it for the 76% off deal, I also heard in some places it comes free with certain purchases
---
Ah yes, an old meme about another pre-release comment that could very well have been true to his knowledge when he said it, definitely proof Bethesda ALWAYS lies. 
---
Have you tried Googling "EA lies"? How about "Nintendo Lies"? "Rockstar Studios lies"? "Ubisoft lies"? "Activision lies"?
---
Funny, there are videos and posts about all of the major game companies just the same as the ones about Bethesda. I guess base don your faulty logic we should assume that all game studios are compulsive liars and everything that they say no matter what is false, great!
---
Yeah you bunch of babies 
---
Omg dude. This is freaking hilarious! Best post I've seen on here! ;D
---
Triangle. Won't be many vendors left.
---
Following cause I want an update of how the patch turned out
---
crying and complaining about dead children, grow up people.
---
subjectivity is funny. 
---
I’m wearing the only armors I have so if they take those I’m naked 
---
Same. I've been hoarding the ammo too
---
And eating doritos...
---
Not defending who you are replying to, but leaving the United States is rather difficult to do.  Apart from the emotional burden of leaving friends and family, the IRS will still follow you unless you renounce your citizenship.  
---
looks like someone’s getting placed on the no-fly list
---
Wow, that is so cool, (warming up heatbed) lol
---
ESO was not made by BGS. It was made by Zenimax Online Media. They are both owned by Bethesda Softworks.

No bro that’s neck beard stuff, no neckbeards allowed here
---
Console or PC?
---
Well half of that maybe taken away from me as well. Bought 30 cobalt 20 violet from a dude. Pretty sure thats going to be gone.
---
My personal logic in this, the damage is already done. Honest hardworking people like myself more than likely fell for a duped weapon and bought it for caps we earned. The dupers and all their alts are already maxed out on caps while everyone's duped weapons they did or didn't know was duped are now gone. Only people who lost anything are the people who didn't know the gear was duped and pay for it.
---
Really the only other thing I could think of to make it more... "Fair" since in a way this was Bethesda's fault for not fixing this in a very timely manner since the glitch was known on day 1 of them happening and players having a fix, is to keep all duped items in circulation, but raise the level caps on all gear to 55,65,70 and 75 essentially making the duped items useless since people will be after the higher leveled ones
---
Are you trying so show me that ignorance isn't just in the F2P posts?
---
Well done!
---
That's my understanding, but it's just speculation. I personally think everything in game has a hexadecimal code assigned to it when it is first created, similar to a VIN number or Social Security Number..  meaning if you bought a TSE gauss from a duper or a player who bought from duper, etc...the game will know it's one of thousands with that same hexadecimal identifier and POOF. Just a guess...
---
Thanks! I might give it at least a basic paintjob once I got some suitable paints from the hardware store.
---
They never say when they are coming back online, You will find out when everyone else does.
---
I caught an STD in the wasteland 
---
This game is full of them... its drowning in fedoras 
---
This isn’t an f2p post, you idiot. 
---
I ask this not to be combative, but as a genuine question....are people actually having this much problem with griefers, or is this a worry in anticipation of it happening? Because I  haven't experienced coming back to my camp and having it been demolished since I've been playing the game (since BETA) and I see others CAMPs all the time in my travels, and haven't noticed people purposely destroying others properties as a rule. The only regular destruction I have is to plants (which I think is understandable) and incidental damage that I think gets done to my camp by enemies while I'm away and before my turrets can get to them.  
---
I'm not saying it doesn't happen as I'm sure it does. I had someone the other day keep coming after me even after I had already signaled I wasn't interested in PvP and I had killed them twice before I just switched servers. It wasn't my camp, but I get there are people who play who don't take no for an answer.  
---
But I honestly wonder what the frequency of this CAMP griefing actually is for people, as I just haven't experienced it or seen it being done to others as I play. I see the issues this poses (bringing the defenses of your camp down to the minimum) but the game treats a fully repaired piece of your camp and one on the edge of being destroyed the same
---
It seems the rush griefers would get from it is being tagged with a bounty. I don't see what fun it would be for griefers to get all the CAMPS they see to almost destroyed and then walk away. From my point of view, if they don't get the bounty or any reaction in game unless something is destroyed, all shooting up a camp and not destroying anything seems to be to me is a waste of ammo.  
---
(Mind you, I fully admit to not thinking like a griefer, so maybe I'll never understand what that mindset is like.)
---
In these times mankind is cursed with the attention span of an opposum right before it gets hit by a car.  
---
Reading more than ten words in a row without a three word TL;DR is just way over their head.
---
If you were on PS4 and saw an antiarmor walking cane and rolling pin,  that was me.
---
The only AA melee weapon I need is my AA switchblade with 40% increased speed.
---
I didn’t even touch a firearm last night until I caught a scorch beasts attention.
---
Poor level 50 bastard.
---
Few hours, they never give an exact time.
---
I DO find it pretty funny that people are getting upset over cheats being removed. Especially because 90% are mad when they know they cheated or bought cheat gear. A bit of schadenfreude, tis true! And after being griefed and one-shot by jackasses with 2SE weapons right through my slap shield at lower levels because the damn things were EVERYWHERE, and now suddenly these assholes are all going to get their comeuppance, it is immensely satisfying. 
---
But I also put up a list of things that may improve now that the cheater-hammer has fallen, so not entirely. 
---
Crying about people crying over a video game....smh grow up 
---
True
---
People throwing hissy fits because all the duped items they sell are being purged.
---
This is a great idea. We need to bring this into real life. Everyone's bank account will be reset to 0 because there's a small amount of people who commit tax fraud. Sure everyone lose some hours of their life but now everything is fair again
---
toxicity intensifies  
---
I actually scrapped about 5 different signs last night.
---
10k was easy for people knowing that you could go to different vendors and how to grind money. It's not automatic, I played a lot and stayed at 1-2k max because I spent my money moving my camp, buying ammo's, fast travelling..  and dropping stuff I couldn't sell to the few vendors I had.
---
My point isn't "10k is legendary" but more "if you had 10k for a weapon, you probably knew it was duped".
---
Is there plans to increase the photo gallery? I've been deleting old photos just to make room for more. On ps4
---
Probably a more of a figurative sense where someone was puting because their duped shop stock is being purged.
---
Is it movable?
---
I did that i also played for 2 weeks before i realized i had to "learn" the plans i was picking up. Freed up a bit of weight though.
---
dont hate an donate
---
Post in both
---
I would say a huge value add to the game would be Bethesda implementing a system to make perk swapping quicker. needing to open my pipboy, pull down a weapon perk so I can load up a lockpicking perk is kind of annoying. It ain't the end of the world, but it would be great If we had say, 3 pre built slots you fill up, and you could swap among them. easy flip form rifle heavy to melee, or from sneak mode to bartering mode! things like that. Then you have a pip boy tab that you can quickly cycle to. 
---
Nice satire.
---
Read what you just wrote. Yeah. 
---
That’s how I read it as well
---
It's the "Paul is Dead" of Fallout.
---
state of any game with a trading option, you allow trades there will be sites like ebay, gold stores, player auction sites that will allow buying and selling of anything in game, i know of about 5 sites outside of ebay you can buy weapons, armor, caps, scrap, recipes, if it can be traded it can be sold.  
---
only way bethesda could combat that is either sell everything possible in the atom shop, or make all drops bound to account and get rid of trading altogether.. and that would only turn it from item sales to account sales.  
---
ebay game items being sold has been around for 20+ year ( i used to sell stuff on ebay i found in d2, even sold my account when i quit playing it). people who have cash and want something they will find somewhere to buy it.. 
---
ebay/atom shop/3rd party site all the same for the most part, only benefit out of the 3 is the atom shop supports the game.
---
I wonder if it's just TSE or every duped weapon. I traded 5000 caps for my Instigating Lever Action. Hope it's still there when I log on.
---
Job well done!
---
That’s just online games. 
---
The price I receive. Here's an example from last night:
---
* Vendor has 200 caps available.
---
* I have 300+ Silver Scrap
---
* Silver scrap price listed as 2 caps.
---
* Offer vendor 100 silver scrap.
---
* Vendor offers me 200 caps.
---
* Accept offer.
---
* Gain 100 caps, lose 100 silver scrap -&gt; This is where the issue is happening. It is treating the silver scrap as being worth 1 cap instead of 2, but only at the point where it's actually exchanging currency. In all the *displays* it is showing as a value of 2.
---
They’ve been looking into ,looking into it. 
---
i dont even qualify as a casual, that sub is just plain objectively better than this one
---
Ah really ? I have been spoilt by eve online who are really good at updating customers on things like this.
---
Guess I will settle back into my arm chair and read another magazine in C.A.M.P
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322465/maintenance-and-duped-item-removals-feb-14-2019/2
---
&gt; During this time, we’re planning to remove items that have been created through duplication exploits from player inventories and stashes.
---
&gt;. **These removals are highly-targeted at a specific list of items.** Players who have used an exploit to dupe items, or acquired duped items from other players, may find those items removed from their accounts once maintenance is complete. It’s also important to note that only a small percentage of accounts currently have duped items, which means the vast majority of players will not be affected by this action.
---
1) if it was created via duping  
---
2) and it's part of their "specific list"
---
It may be deleted. That's all we know, everything else is speculation.
---
It’s a mechanic carried over from Fallout 4, so people who have never played fo4 will have no idea, but those who have played know exactly what is going on
---
I can’t even log on until Saturday the latest :/
---
Yeah, that's understandable, which is why I expressed you had every opportunity to do so. Leaving the country is a poor example anyways. There's so many other restrictive factors that stop people from leaving even their own town. 
---
Zero. Atoms are free and easy to get.
---
I have the polar opposite opinion to yours and think this entire post is nonsense to justify a subpar product. You pull examples from several other titles to justify 76's myriad of issues, but 76 is a single title with ALL the problems packaged into one, then call the fanbase childish and toxic for feeling like they were duped into supporting a product that Bethesda themselves (from the current appearance of things) never intended to.  
---
I'm off to anthem tomorrow.
---
“Surely you can’t be serious”.
---
Wait for it...
---
I'm not sure why you are being downvoted to hell. 
---
Compared to previous Fallout titles with **unlimited** storage, while the increase is welcome, 800 pounds are still far from enough for people who like to collect things.
---
Or just don't want to spend a lot of time managing their storage to *somehow* make things fit.
---
I can give you a little incite as I have 300+ hours in this game. I wouldn't call it "shit" but definitely not good. There's no end game content besides Scorch Beast Queen. Bugs are still there that have been there since BETA. Bethesda's fix on TSE weapons which made ranged weapons viable is to nerf them. Which is fair, it needed a nerf, but it was nerfed way too much while melee is still OP as anything. Bethesda doesn't know balance. There aren't many quests and the little quests there are is just "Hey I'm alive come help me. Lol jk I'm actually dead." Only good quest really was the Order of the Mysteries I think it was? The world itself is amazing yet feels so incredibly empty, the lack of NPCs having A LOT to do with it. As an MMO and not having any end game content when the game is released is just embarrassing. I have no more incentive to play other that rebuilding my camp somewhere and hunting for supplies. And I want to launch a nuke for the only end game content I have to pray the server doesn't crash or I can put the mainframe cores into the terminal at a decent amount of time before the server starts lagging badly.
---
With that said, this game has a lot of potential, but Bethesda needs to get their head out of this ass to actually make it great. Which it can be.
---
Bro I didn't even look. That's just spiteful lame shit. 
---
God I miss Borderlands! I was hoping the multiplayer would be modeled the same way. 
---
Better break down your bulk 1st just in case this patch breaks it again.
---
The turret itself can rotate on the base, but the barrel can´t move up and down unfortunately.
---
You assume one... what about every thing they wear and use goes poof?
---
See, this is something that can be proven.  Go to eBay and look up Fallout 76.  You will see "items available/items sold.
---
Facts can be proven with just a little bit of work.
---
80$ (cad) at the retail release. 
---
I disagree, if you didn’t realize the challenges of this sort of project from announcement then i think you weren’t paying attention. It’s literally exactly what they said it would be. 
---
At E3 they said the release would be like this. Looking forward to working with us to make something great over time. 
---
They literally said that. 
---
Most people don’t use the tools within Reddit to find previous post. 
---
Is it possible for a post to be more empty and meaningless than this one.
---
Thank you Bethesda for making these great changes!!!
---
I´ll just print myself a vertibird.
---
He is on page for informations, and most informative posts get lost in jungle of shitposts. So yeah he is complaining about people stupidity and he is right.
---
I want a legendary "they took are jobs!" Sign
---
&gt; it usually takes me less than an hour to gather enough guns to sell 1400 caps worth of stuff.
---
where?
---
if the game lives long enough to get mods for console first thing im doing is making a cell shading mod
---
I feel ridiculous for not thinking to help lower level players...I was attacked by a much higher-level player early in my game, and have avoided everyone as much as possible since then. The interaction with the yellow PA player was unexpected and I had assumed the generosity was atypical. 
---
I have a ton of stuff taking up space in my inventory that I'd much prefer to donate to other players rather than scrap...
---
Thanks for the feedback -- I'm glad to know it wasn't an anomaly for a player to intentionally drop good loot for a random lower-level stranger.
---
No problemo. Some additional detail, in case any of it is of use:
---
The problem is with the price I receive. Here's an example from last night:
---
* Gain 100 caps, lose 100 silver scrap -&gt; This is where the issue is happening. 
---
It is treating the silver scrap as being worth 1 cap instead of 2, but only at the point where it's actually exchanging currency. In all the *displays* it is showing as a value of 2. I seem to always get exactly half. It only seems to have started happening since I got the third rank of Hard Bargain. For reference, I have 4 Charisma and (in case if affects something) every mutation except vegetarian or empathy and have 3 ranks in Class Freak, so there may be some weird percentages at fault somewhere in there.
---
Yep, had that happen before. In the very last room with a buddy at 6:45pm on Monday clearing out the last of the robots when we get the notification that our codes have vaporized. Worse, my friend refused to believe they were actually gone and wasted a keycard putting in an expired code.
---
Had we realized how quickly the community solves new codes, we probably would have hung out in the silo for an hour or so waiting on Nukacrypt but instead he ragequit. Can't say I blame him.
---

Would really love to here something on energy weapons and grenades.   
---
80$ on the game+Tricentennial, and I’ve probably spent another 40-50$ on atoms. 
---
Hahah. Nice.
---
And part of the problem at the same time.
---
Better get some disease cure or antibiotics!
---
Lol this is amazing the two explosive shottys I “Legit” got in drops (luckier then most) . Time to grief some camps already got my bounty to 2300 caps
---
Uhm….and what do you trade for them?  The 25k cap limit combined with limited storage is really horking up long term trading.  If you set up all 5 characters you have storage for 125k caps.  That's fairly easy to hit.  Then you are stuck with putting inventory in storage.  But with weight limits you are stuck with no weight items - treasure maps or truly rare items, etc.  The game designers really, really didn't know anything about economics when they constructed this trading system.
---
What does any of what you just said have to do with trading with dupers?
---
Maybe there was no purge and this was their plan all along
---
I’m serious. 
---
Preach
---
&gt;• Quest containers during the Feed the People and Path to Enlightenment events now only accept quest items – With this fix, players can no longer accidentally transfer items from their inventories into these quest containers. As a result, you should now be able to complete these events without fear of losing non-quest items.
---
This is great news! But will I Feed everyone on the server when I complete the quest?!
---
Hope they get disconnected from server every 10 min after 5rd time rage quit
---
yeah i just figured this was wasteland hygiene. Combination clean your house, wash your clothes, and bath all in one.   
---
Good changes, however, heavy/energy weapon balance is still terrible. Are there any plans to make adjustments to weapon balance? Right now there are very few viable builds for late game.
---
This downtime is special. They have a script purging duped items from player inventories. So it depends on how well they optimized the script.
---
I think it would be better if they would just lock all duped items to the person who currently owns it. That way they can't profit off of it except maybe to get the junk when scrapping it, but that's hardly anything usually. But the people who were fooled into buying it would not be punished since they're not punishing the people who actually made the dupes since they get to keep the money/caps.
---
Thanks man. We had just been griefed by a guy who apparently didn’t want us farming the vendor bot. I hopped on to help another user who was looking for the clean ranger outfit, but we never got that far. This guy wiped the 3 of us that had gathered pretty easily w a bunch of TSE and full sentinel. We took him once, but not before he claimed like 500 caps worth of my bulk scrap. I just figure any time I encounter an asshole like that then I have to every things out. For every jerk on here, there’s just as many regular people willing to help out others.
---
I don't know the EXACT maximum amount, but let's just say that you can get between 150-200 "slots" total, if you spend the max amount of money.. "free" wise, you get about 75. 
---
Now, thing to factor in.. 
---
weapons/armor/artifacts/equipment/rings/belts/necklaces/etc DON'T stack (even if they are identical)
---
most items can only max out at a total of 99 in a stack (health potions, stamina potions, magic potions, crafting items(sometimes need 3 different things to craft 1 thing), etc) and then start to take up another slot. 
---
Events give you limited time stuff that you have to hold onto, in order to make use of them later (months, years, who knows?)
---
Crap like that.. 
---
Now, they are two completely different games and play styles, and I get it. Fallout absolutely needs tweaks to storage, and I wouldn't mind being able to fast travel in some sort of way when overencumbered. 
---
Another game I'm thinking about is  Borderlands, which has limited bank space and inventory slots, but a TON of great legendary items.. talk about having mule characters
---
They are nuking all duplicated items, it will probably take longer than normal maintenance 
---
I'm pretty sure this is an .ini tweak. When trying to make the game more smooth on my toaster, I saw somewhere there was a line that could be changed to enable/disable this. I can't be more specific I'm afraid, but it may be worth looking into.
---
Ya, I love trading too, but I'm a station trader, not a hauler.
---
Made me feel like I was on Wall Street with all the graphs, multiple monitors and external tools lol.
---
Knox*
---
No, it doesn't make sense as there is zero evidence that the "patch rollback" reintroduced duping.
---
Shit I want a couplenof those.
---
Bah, one of these days Ill buy a printer.
---
I'll trade you a six pack of Nuka for two racks of Baby Backs
---
Any update on the energy weapon durability issue? I mean, it's been 3 months since the game came out, and that's 3 months of a whole class of weapon being severely broken, guys.
---
What about the problems with stealth introduced with the last patch? It really handicaps a lot of abilities and builds, not to mention Healing Factor. Lot of people use HF/Stealth builds that are in kinda bad shape right now.
---
Is there any update on requests to either increase CAMP size, or lessen turret budget impact, while buffing turrets ever so slightly so they're a wee bit more useful?
---
Is there any investigation into and/or update on the fact that legendary enemies are often not dropping legendaries, or they're really really shitty legendaries that don't match enemy quality?
---
Server wipe and relaunch is the only way I'll reinstall
---
I love how Grahm the traveling super mutant advertises his goods. He's like the guy at the Titty Twister bar in the movie "From Dusk til Dawn". Just replace the word "pussy" with "meat".
---
I accidentally read your name as jhooligan, which seemed to make sense  :-)
---
I think he was probably under the same impression I was until very recently: I thought that each vendor had 200 caps that got refreshed at a given interval. I also thought that if some random player got there before me and took the 200 it would be at 0 for me until their caps refreshed.
---
I only very recently learned that their caps are 200 for each player, and are tied to factions, which is why some show at 0 (if you have already taken the 200 from another vendor in the same faction).
---
In theory a lot of those people have been banned. In theory... But I haven’t heard much about that since the first few days that they announced they would be banning people with excess items.
---
So you’re probably right, unfortunately. Most of them probably made out like bandits 
---
Does this have a fix for the slider wrapping to the left, causing cap price scrolling from 0 to 25000?
---
I posted a new thread today abouta  bug that is persistant, once i enter my power armor, i cant get back out until i restart the entire game!  then, i can get out of the armor,... but once i put it back on again, im stuck again....  ive totally restarted the whole game dozens of times but this bug persists, PLEASE tell me they are aware of this and are going to address it sson? because this bug is very game changing, and im scared my character is now forever bugged!!!! help!
---
Yes.... your "buddy". Either you are a two faced terrible friend or you just made this up for karma.
---
Yeah, "eating" plans was definitely not instinctual. I think I got lucky and saw someone mention it in beta so I didn't go too long without figuring it out.
---
Also Pharma Farma and any of the other "get more from containers perks"... For the longest time I didn't know you actually had to search the container with a separate button press after opening it.
---
I’m sorry!! I used a energy weapons for the first time and their trash, no wonder melee is considered unbalanced. 
---
That's just how you think it works. They're literally two different companies. No shared staff. The parent company has nothing to do with games and is purely administrative in nature.
---
Well said that man, I've only just reached level 26 and loving it
---
To quote something that was also a huge letdown: "When it's done."
---
Will do. I was a little disappointed when I heard 76 would be multiplayer and planned to play strictly solo but I really enjoyed the teaming up and will look for more opportunities to team up after I replenish my ammo.  I burned through 2500 rounds of 5.56 last night. That’s not unusual for me but I picked up very little lead to make more and that is unusual. 
---
It's significantly more fine, but why would you trade on the survival mode server when you can trade on the PVE server? It'd be only a PVP server and anyone would be an enemy. I'd still rather them be two separate game modes. 
---
This.
---
But they’d complement all those 1 star wood armor pieces so well! And even more chances to get the Stalker effect on melee weapons!
---
who makes these posts? just keep playing, you are free to enjoy the game just as others are free to continue shitting on the state of it
---
3.5 hours in (if they started at 9est like they said) if they also adding in the scorchbeasts changes along with going through everyones character files to delete all the duped items could be time consuming even for computers. lot of files and characters to search through.. id imagine something akin to defraggin a drive in the '90s.
---
AMEN TO THIS
---
$ 70 tricentennial edition, $ 150.00 power armor edition still unopened in box, $ 25 regular edition for extra stash space. 
---
I don't get this skyrocketing prices thing. I mean people can charge what they want but most people don't have mule accounts so most people will refuse to pay more than their actual cap limit. 
---
People may try but if you want to sell to the masses and not the exploit elite, 25k is a hard cap price limit. Only way to get above that is bartering.
---
That should totally be an Achievement/Trophy - Kill A Robot With a Protest Sign
---
I can see the appeal, sort of.  You can spend 100s of hours grinding or pay $20 for a 1-shot killing machine.  That sort of thing takes the fun out of it for me because I like finding new weapons and items to tinker around with, and generally lose interest once I hit top-tier on anything.  But others who are obsessed with min/maxing could easily be tempted.  
---
Not exactly. All the game needs to do is read the ID and the value. Let's say the ID for Steel is 02GHJ9
---
Maybe it won't 
---
*Enhancements
---
Do you mean because of the server stability/performance issues that Bethesda keeps mentioning as the reason for the storage limit? 
---
Because that should not even a be a problem, if done properly. 
---
It almost sounds to me as if they are keeping all stored items loaded and active at all times, instead of items being unloaded and turned into a simple database text entry when stored, thus allowing for near unlimited storage without even scratching performance or stability.
---
Now while the removal of duped items is a good thing, the fact I spent thousands on such said weapons is real bummer.
---
If I see a low level player around, I'll find them and drop a bag of useful stuff (stimpacks and radaway (usually diluted because chemist perk + superduper means never running out of those), .38 and 10mm ammo, etc.)  Sometimes I'll make up a set of level 1 armor and some level 1 weapons and leave them around, too.  I usually leave plans in cash registers or other containers near vendorbots.
---
Crashes, freezes and disconnects regularly. Loading times are insanely low. You have to sit through three losing screens before you even load into the game. One image based loading screen, followed by one black loading screen, followed by another image based loading screen. Then when you load into the game world, you have to stand still and wait til everything loads like your armor, weapons, and camp. If you dare press the pip boy too soon, you will freeze your game and you’ll have to repeat the whole process again by loading into a new server.
---
Excavator power armor == Star Trek transporter.
---
you must like you bread ma dude.

@ladydevann I posted a new thread today abouta bug that is persistant, once i enter my power armor, i cant get back out until i restart the entire game! then, i can get out of the armor,... but once i put it back on again, im stuck again.... ive totally restarted the whole game dozens of times but this bug persists, PLEASE tell me they are aware of this and are going to address it soon? because this bug is very game changing, and im scared my character is now forever bugged!!!! help!
---
Yes, that's in the patch next week.
---
I'm not saying you have to care. I'm not trying to defeat you. I'm just pointing it out. You got some issues, bud. I hope you don't let it carry over into ya real life. People who act like this are typically pretty insecure and antisocial. 
---
And yeah, the way you spend your day complaining about a game you don't even play anymore and how you respond to someone just noticing that DOES tell you what kind of person they are. I'm seeing behavioral patterns. 
---
Anyway, sorry. Happy Valentine's Day. 
---
In my post, it says “very often.” Happy to explain if you need it. This is something that is being blown way out of proportion.
---
U sound like a "friend" not many people would want in their lives...
---
Harsh view, there is that old saying, "I told you so".
---
You seem to be forgetting that reddit makes up the tiny minority of players to the game, and that every game regardless of what it is will lose huge swathes of players by time its 3 months old, so many people buy a game, play it for a couple months/weeks/days or even hours then decide thats it, then they move on to another game and repeat.  
---
A lot of the complaints you see here on reddit are from people who have hundreds and hundreds of hours in game so they've burnt themselves out, were not even at the point of DLC 1 yet (even by the times of other fallouts) and people are saying the game is dead.  
---
The vast majority of players will not have more then 150 hours by this point, let alone the 500+ hours some people are saying on here, ive been on steam 6 years and 500 hours in a game would be my 3rd most played game in that time, so in 3 months people have played 6 years worth of this game
---
Lol, this exact thing really did happen to me though. Luckily none of the legendaries seemed to work for me and I just took like 1000 handmades that I was able to scrap for mods and left everything else, but I can say from experience that this really did happen to some people. They could easily tell what was happening when you saw (15739372034875) behind every item, but still it did happen lol
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** BleedOutCold! ^(hug)
---
It really is the perfect spot in my opinion. Acid, a big enough water source that you can plop down at least 5 industrial purifiers, and a decently sized flat area for planting crops. Plus, it's like a 2 minute hike to Pleasant Valley station and only 5-7 caps to jump to Harper's Ferry &amp; Whitesprings, so it cuts down on travel costs for vendor runs.
---
I used to camp on the junk node north of Harper's Ferry since it had water access, but after they changed mineral extractors to spit out raw ore instead of scrap I found myself running out of acid more frequently and searched every acid node in the game until I found this one.
---
People who have bought items in good faith will suffer the most. They have also built their character skills based on those weapons. Now they might lose weapons they use but also the skill build they have used becomes obsolote and its not useful anymore. They need to level up again a lot to change those points for something else and find new weapons. Its gonna be killing blow for many people.
---
Same. I'm not in the game for an economy. I'm not in the game to struggle for hours managing stash/inventory. I just want to do the quests and have fun, and that's pretty stinking hard to do when you can barely move. Limiting the stash space since it's a multiplayer game makes sense, but not when it's this severely limited. I mean it's also kinda hard to do the quests... when there are none, and the ones available just aren't engaging. But that's a rant for another day (never, because it's been rehashed so much).
---
yes! 
---
&gt; My fingers are crossed for robot crafting.
---
Don't get your hopes up too much. I can see it being pretty difficult to implement the automaton interface on a multiplayer scale.
---
Agree, most times I can't wait to show mine off!  If someone is going to grief you, a locked door ain't gonna do a darn thing.  Might as well share! Normally if I use someones camp I leave a little something on the ground (stimpack, water, food) as a way of saying thanks.
---
I'm an old guy who plays solo with my mic off also. I'm level 145 though so griefers apparently don't pick on me. It always blows my mind how new players always run away from me as if I have the plague, although I did actually have the plague up until a week ago.
---
I'm an introvert and generally prefer to play solo but I do have some pretty decent mid game weapons and armor that I will be selling to the vendor bots for next to nothing. If you're on PC I wouldn't mind letting you sift through to see if you want any of it and I could probably mod most any weapons that you have.
---
Drinking too much of grandpas cough medicine I see. 
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
The absolutely did want us to trade.
---
/r/SandwichFilthyCasuals

If there is a way I don't know it, I stopped trying to figure it out when I kept accidently exiting trade probably annoying who I was trading with 😄
---
Yes, I’m just saying most dont
---
can you not read english?
---
“My arrrrrm”
---
And then I hit them again
---
&gt;Ah yes, an old meme about another pre-release comment that could very well have been true to his knowledge when he said it, definitely proof Bethesda ALWAYS lies.
---
you're doing it again. dismissing a fact because it doesn't match your very specifically placed goalpost. Todd, while representing Bethesda, lied. period.
---
&gt;Have you tried Googling "EA lies"? How about "Nintendo Lies"? "Rockstar Studios lies"? "Ubisoft lies"? "Activision lies"?
---
have you? https://imgur.com/a/ZTPYJii
---
as you can see, Bethesda is the only one being blatantly mocked by google. and so you wouldn't say my google is biased, I screencapped Peter and Hello Games as well.
---
&gt;Funny, there are videos and posts about all of the major game companies just the same as the ones about Bethesda. I guess based on your faulty logic we should assume that all game studios are compulsive liars and everything that they say no matter what is false, great!
---
you're conveniently forgetting that Bethesda has hundreds, thousands more articles, videos and memes about lying tied to its name.
---
&gt;it makes absolute sense if you ignore the reality that they really haven't lied at all about anything since launch.
---
but you said it yourself that they lied about the stash. moving again?
---
The short answer is: I don't know.
---
Currently hitting a camp object will make you wanted. In the future it is destroying an object. In both cases one event will make you wanted. The ideal system, I think, would require multiple hits instead of one. But I think that coding is too complex.
---
Maybe the change is fine, but many a thread will be made with stories because of it.
---
is it not possible to enjoy something but at the same time complain about the issues you dont enjoy about it? like game breaking persistent bugs?
---
The reason I see skyrocketing prices is because of supply and demand. Many people are gonna lose their duped weapons. This is gonna drive a high demand for weapons in the market. I'm not saying weapons will cost 25k caps but the limited amount is gonna drain quick due to demand. The dust will settle though.
---
Lol so much ignorance crammed into one post. Remarkable.
---
"it just works"
---
You don't need to explain anything to me...
---
Definition of often
---
**:** many times **:** FREQUENTLY
---
In less than 5 minutes, I counted well over 200 sales on eBay for in game items.  That fits the definition of "often"
---
It affects me not one bit. Any Legendary items I have are either drops or I bought from vendors. I have no TSE stuff at all. If this happens to yank some items that were duped because the duper sold them to the vendor, so be it. It's just caps. Not going to get worked up over them fixing broken stuff because I might lose a weapon or something.
---
I don't usually bother with Distant Thunder or Line in the Sand, but actually.....I don't know why heh. I'll start playing those more, and thank you :)
---
FYI, HOrde events (when they work) and Heart of the Swamp can be good also.
---
Yes! That’d be a fun daily challenge too.
---
Love this.
---
I was hesitant to buy this *BECAUSE* of the fan-based feedback I received after the game's release. I'm a huge Fallout fan, and was stoked to play after watching the E3 premier until I was told the game didn't live up to its expectations.
---
Just got it last week and I am actually annoyed that I listened to them. Sure, it has it's bugs but I'm having a blast! Level 13 now, and smashing everything with a sledgehammer. Say hi if you see me on the PS4 servers ;D
---
"My names Travis and I done got 55 legendary weapons" 
---
"Well Travis, this one here is level 25, why don't you just get rid of this one?"
---
"I MIGHT NEED IT, LEAVE ME ALONE, REEEEE"
---
I'm going to say 80% of my gear is looted, 15% is from crafting, the other 5% would be 'found' around the world.
---
At the end of the day, I'm happy for the purge, accepting that it's possible I'll lose an item or two.
---
Lazy solution for naughty boys and girls that wanted to be lazy. Fair.
---
I've been playing since the beta on ps4. I love it. It's running pretty stable nowadays
---
3 upvotes and then down to 0.
---
Sick of shills on this subreddit trying to manipulate public opinion with their shill posts and vote manipulation. It';s time for this to be known by everyone. Listen up. It's happening. They have no right to do this. It is anti-consumer and false and misleading.
---
Pass it onto the devs... maybe patch in the next 12 years
---
Responses were helpful, thank you!
---
Just wasn't sure about the breakdown. And it sounds super annoying for the defending player since they'll have rads to deal with afterward.
---
4 bucks* and people who get mad about RWT are just poor people that are jealous like ur self.
---
Nah, they didn’t fuck up. 
---
Nothing worse than standing around with my Instigating Super Sledge with 40% power swing soaking up minigun fire while I wait to find out if that guy is going to come over here and shoot this guy 1 time before I drop him in 1 hit.
---
Where did you find the regular edition for $25? URL?
---
Care to provide any source material behind that?
---
This is the first bit of news I've been excited about in a while
---
buying easy mode items instead of earning them in game is Lazy
---
Playstation?
---
From what I can read it's patch 5 that introduced changes. I haven't gone back on the patchnotes, but I will at some point :/
---
How many people do you think play the game?
---
&gt;So i go around building up a bounty
---
That is griefing. 
---
you say so. i have 3 chars, 148, 57 and 36. i also play in an clan where everyone is at least lvl 130+ and some have twinks aswell, and everybody said that they had trouble with the questline after the firefighter quests going to rose, they were about lvl 10-15 then and had to grind 5-10 level to get hardmode difficulty progress in the mainstorry - which is only a huge sequence of fetch quests. with lvl 50 and done with most of the quest at all, all they had to do left is grind for gear at nuked whitespring for about 50-100 levels and farm specific events like uranium fever.   
---
you are only max lvl with about lvl 70-90, depends on which perk cards you need - to get the right weapons and needed perk cards for repair, craft, combat etc.   
---
Idk where this all should be fun or joy, it's just a huge grind within an empty world until you are op af with godly weapons (till now). This isn't a fallout what supposed to be an post nuclear role playing game. it's more like tom clancy, just a name to sell crap.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqlcu2/inside_the_vault_february_14_2019/
---
I think the problem is you assume that people use real money to buy TSE to make the game bearable. That means that person is looking for a walk through type game that doesn’t have any real challenge or tactics.  If that’s the type of game they are looking for, then perhaps this isn’t it?  Nor was it meant to be. I mean I hate grinding, so I’ve been exploring the map and using what I have available in order to do what I need to do.  That is the story. It’s not getting the best armor and weapons and running around, it’s the journey to getting those items. If you buy them, then you’ve skipped the most important part of the game, the little bits of story you find in areas of the map that don’t have a location marker. 
---
I had a lol 10 hunting rifle drop the other day (was lvl 55) so I modded it up. Hardened, suppressor, ect. And hunted down a lvl 6 to give to. Good deed for the day.
---
Oh...... I didn’t know they could do that. Someone gave me a 2 tse handmade rifle which was really kind of them, but I always had a tiny voice in the back of my head “why would some do that ?”  A tiny part of me said it could be a duped item so I guess I will find out  for sure when I log back on.
---
Seriously satirical 
---
I mean you think Bethesda would've made a statement saying not to trade with anyone you suspect to have duplicated items lol
---
Console
---
So grinding to earn the caps to buy a special item instead of waiting for a lucky roll is lazy? That's how the game should be. A fresh marketplace in a newly revived wasteland.
---
Yeah it is bad on this sub
---
Feel bad for the people that purchased duped weapons with real $. Wonder if they can get a refund/chargeback? That being said I don't have any duped anything and hope I don't lose the loot I've been grinding for.
---
*swoons... fans herself.... before headshotting it out of stealth to give you that opportunity*
---
What exactly am I shilling friend?
---
Unfortunately, I think this is correct. A real pity....would be an epic surprise to get a level 50 item from a level 35 encounter and have something to push towards using. Oh well :/
---
Oh no, someones holding a billion-dollar AAA Games company to certain industry standards like not having these problems in the first place, the humanity! D: 
---
All those darn ungrateful customers who paid $60 to $100+ for a game that's still got huge issues that should have been fixed *before* launch! /s
---
Yes i can but geez dude your statement make zero sense.
---
I thought you had to destroy it, not just slightly damage it to get wanted?
---
That being said I don’t go around attacking other people’s camps so I’m not sure.
---
Wtf are you carying in your inventory multiple Tanks or what?
---
Honestly, the only issue would probably be making the robot entity. The actual appearance of Automatron robots is basically just determined by mods, similar to weapons. So once its spawned in, it'd just be a matter of making sure the game attaches those properly.
---
Lol you act so tough yet you play fallout 76 and probably cry when your camp is leveled XD
---
Tomorrow?
---
I thought they were doing it today. Now I've got to rearrange my schedule.
---
&gt;  I currently have 2 million weight on my character and 671000 in my stash. Why do they think that 800 is even a feasible number?
---
Not for long
---
I’m not even sure what side you’re on..?
---
multiplayer games have different rules. this isnt a single player fallout game. adapt. eventually stash size will no longer be increased.
---
So, bye, then?
---
I feel like all the backlash from long time fans is because we loved Bethesda games because we could see all the time, care, and devotion that they put into there games unlike many others that just throw together quick cash grab games. Which I can tell most Bethesda fans hate.
---
If any other game company did this there would be much less backlash. We just feel betrayed that one of our favorite game makers seems to have went the cash grab route over the time and effort route. Hopefully they’ll be able to make us think otherwise thing just look bleak as of right now
---
I just checked legendaries tbh. I also didn't receive any legendary for completing the event, and someone else has speculated these may be based on your level, not the level of the mobs, so a 50 might still be possible but the chance is very low.
---
Not you. The ones who downvoted you en masse as soon as they noticed it was getting upvotes.
---
Only that it was poorly branded as a "Demo". They should have called it a dated and truncated post-beta. Otherwise if you possessed an iota of patience to get bast the first day hiccups, the fast paced game play and sense of freedom were astounding. I'm hooked.
---
Low effort but still chuckled.
---
Every patch I see some post about "now duping will be fixed" when are they actually going to fix it lol every time they try someone just finds another way
---
So, I mean this sincerely, as I've been familiar with social angst and awkwardness... if you start to do these things in game (talk, trade, team up), where there are less long term affects, especially on your psych, it will get easier IRL too. Use the game as a sim and desensitizer and it'll carryover.

It would be like if they fixed the trap disarm exploit by resetting the level of every player who ever disarmed a trap. 
---
&gt; I’m just about ready to start a FO76NoBitch subreddit
---
Theres a word for that, an echo chamber.
---
This guy looks at the bright side of life.
---
Even if the brightness is from a blinding nuke 
---
Just realize some of us are not so quick on the take so we might not understand what you are doing, but thank you! When I was lower level there was another player working the same quest that I was and he didnt have a MIC so he would shoot the ground to show me the way or use his headlight. It was very smart and appreciated! Originally I thought he was trying to PVP me but realized I was not hit at all :)
---
Buy me a cow and call me Bob.
---
Distant Thunder's just an easy roll on the power armor plans chart (though supposedly it can give you legendaries) and Line in the Sand is especially fun if you've been pissed at scorchbeasts recently and wanna see an anti-air missile turret wreck em &gt;:D
---
Fair enough. One clarification about the SBQ: my concern is that the DR scaling is linear, i.e., Number of players \* Base DR, but the actual damage to be dealt to her is super-linear. Rough example: 2 people have to deal 64k damage total; 4 people have to deal 200k total instead of 128k because how DR calculation affects damage received by her.
---
A few days ago I got stupid lucky and found a level 15 suppressor’s explosive handmade on vendor bot Phoenix. It’s a weird enough roll that it was likely organic and deemed not worth holding onto.  I saw an opportunity and bought it for 500 caps. 
---
The next day I sold it on the market subreddit to a guy who wanted it for his low level alt. Netted myself 4K caps, a TSE harpoon gun, and a marsupial serum (never tried mutations before so figured why not).
---
I’m fully expecting the harpoon gun to be gone when I get home today. And that’s okay. In my mind, I still made out just fine.
---
In my mind, I struck gold and turned a 500 cap purchase into 4,000, plus got a serum to try mutations for the first time. Even if the  weapon I sold him doesn’t disappear, I’m happy with the trade. 
---
If it’s still there when I log in, all the better. But I still have my AA harpoon gun to fall back on which was quite alright on its own
---
I’ve been telling my friends the exact same thing as you when it comes to item levels. Raise them levels up and make all the duped gear useless. I don’t buy for a minute though that no one knew their trades for gear wasn’t duped. The 76 bazaar screamed “selling duped shit!”  since it’s been here.  The only thing I’ve purchased from other players are a few miscellaneous plans and a handful of mutation serums.  I’ve never gravitated towards a TSE sale on the bazaar and for good reason. I got one TSE drop from a nuke zone that was a .44, not entirely helping my big guns build. 
---
No one knows how many people play the game,because there isn't a running tally to look up. Also, your question is irrelevant and it doesn't even matter.  Real People bought Virtual Items with Real Money.
---
Often
---
I don't remember the mole miners being over level 40 even before patches, but I've read that Patch 5 introduced loot changes which may have affected UF. I can't confirm, but in any case, it is what it is now :/
---
Then people cry over 'Pay 2 Win', just let it be cosmetic.
---
I couldn’t agree more, I don’t even do any of the quests coz I find them empty, I mean, everyone is dead!
---
I just screw around, raid, grind. 
---
But even the grind is pretty fucking grinding lol 
---
Picking up 20 straight jackets from defiance and hopping 7 vendors is pretty fucking lazy, yeah.
---
You've gotta let thier health regen first, then complete a 360 no scope head shot, and finish them off with melee (unarmed doesn't work) to get legendary loot to drop 
---
Lmao i actually kinda expect it. But haha so what. So what if we log in and they accidentally deleted everything in our stash boxes and the mobs 1 hit us from the other side of the map..... Its a game that we bought for entertainment and i assume that if your still playing it well it must be because you consider it somewhat fun to play. Regardless for me it was worth the $60 i spent on it even if i never play it again. I had alot of fun experiences with the wife and the kids and even got some good laughs over the occasional glitches. There was this one server every time my wife teleported to a new location a dead scorchbeast would drop right on top of her head. She ported a 4th time into my house and BAM dead scorchbeast droped on her head right inside my house. It  was so funny, cracked me up i still got the screen shot. It was Like one of admins was bored and just was messing with her. Anyways the game must break before it can be fixed and new items can be recovered if you have the willpower to continue.
---
As long as they leave my 200,000 Caps alone I'm all for it. 😋
---
Now to configure it to be able to snap off capgun rounds.
---
Well the economy is technically there, it just hasn't been utilized much because of the amount of introverts and solo minded players running amuck (I am one myself most of the times) and because it has been butchered by bad actors such as the dupers or scammers. 
---
To me these duped items were saturating the current market and removing these is a good first step to establishing an auction, player hubs, etc this is also good news for those who attained rare legendaries by actual looting not bought with caps from vendors/players or picked up from a paper bag and/or the like. The value of these will skyrocket and those who have them can make a fortune given that there is a demand and not much supply. Basic economics.
---
Apparently loot changes in Patch 5 might be the culprit. Oh well :/
---
Huh. Seems like a big flaw in trading. 
---
Your title is misleading. Maybe post again and be more specific about viewing legendary attributes 
---
I mis-spoke. I was referring to the entity itself. Introducing followers in a multi-player scale needs to be done carefully. With time I'm sure we will be able to craft robots, but I doubt within this first year.
---
r/woooosh
---
Can we get more frequent updates on perk balancing and resets, weapon damage, etc.? I put the game down for awhile because I didn’t like direction the dev team was taking with the nerfs and balance tweaks (not going into depth as to why, it’s already been complained about enough). I want to give this game another chance because I’m a huge fallout fan but I’d like to see more frequent community updates on these issues and want to see that this is something that’s being taken serious and will be addressed sooner rather than later. Thank you. 
---
There’s no love for Todd here.
---
If you have not logged in in ages how do you know how much worse game is than bete? I had usual troubles in beta twice missed whole session due to PlayStation server conflict ..but lately and I play every day I have seen lots of great improvement have not had blue screen crash or log in issue and have stayed on same server all day without getting kicked off..don't believe all the stuff other people post including me! Play it for yourself it is only way to have a honest opinion. Only you know if it has gotten better for you hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
Look at this shill and his shill post history.
---
It's not shills man, op is an idiot.
---
Nah because it's full of brainwashed idiots like you and op that ignore facts and bash the game because you don't have anything better to do. There are reasonable complaints for the game, but op doesn't know what they are talking about, and if you agree with them, you are just as ignorant. 
---
Damn, I must be psychic because I understood it.
---
To sum it up, OP is saying something like this: "I think Fallout 76 is a fun game(sure it had a bad launch and has had bad support, but so have other game that turned out good) and  they have received their 50 lashes from the community and reviewers. The vocal minority(i.e. non-casual players with excessive playtime, like 500 hours) is annoying with their non-constructive criticism, and it's time to encourage the game to get better or leave the community if you won't contribute."
---
At least that's what I'm taking away form this post.
---
BuT WhaT ABouT tHE 10o PRe-WaR MonEY?
---
Sorry I disagree with your opinion. 
---
if you have 671000 in your stash... then why are you complaining? /s
---
Sorry but no, my friend is staying with me for the week.   He’s from another state.  He plays on PS4, I play on PC.    Its not two faced when laugh in his face and tell him to read the EULA.
---
Bulk bulk bulk, unbulk bulk bulk bulk. Phew need more plastic... Bulk bulk bulk bulk bulk unbulk ...
---
How is that lazy? They're literally removing glitched items. Y'know what? Screw Bethesda for striking back on exploiters.
---
If this does mess up somehow and a lot of people’s stuff does get mistakenly deleted I wouldn’t even be mad. It would suck in the moment but It’s for the greater good. 
---
If they lose EVERYTHING, then they knew damn well they were buying duped loot.
---
&gt;The side where the game becomes good because IT CAN BE.
---
The key is hoarding the proper materials
---
Even if for the time being they aren't followers but just CAMP guardians that would be neato and make the CAMP's feel... well, I guess "alive" is the wrong word to use when talking about robots but you know what I mean
---
Then you complain about after they fuck it up. Being an ass about it before it's even happened and serves zero purpose aside from feeding the trolls and shitting on Bethesda for otherwise trying to do the right thing.
---
If you go out to eat and the waiter gets your order wrong then it's their fault. If every time you return to that restaurant you act like a total prick to any waiter expecting them to fuck up your order every time then you're the asshole now. 
---
Yeah because the game is in a perfect state and all criticism is just made up by "haters".
---
I occasionally sell one of my weapons and have to buy it back.
---
I once tried to point out a missed legendary corpse to a low level player. It had gone airborne and landed behind a car. I waved and then shot at the corpse. I hit the car instead which exploded instantly and the low level player (who just lost half their health) ran away.
---
And curiosity drove me to discover why nobody kills the robots inside the Whitespring. Zero XP, zero drops, fast-healing turrets everywhere.
---
We already had y2k
---
What I did last night was farmed lucky hole mine for the lead or, took the workshop at Hemlock Holes, and used my own acid extractor.  As others have commented, there is a spot to extract both but you constantly get hit by scorchbeast.  I'm thinking of trying to build there again using the foundations build.
---
Oh?  Is it unfriendly to call your friends out on their bullshit?  
---
Till Monday

Scorched Hookers in the ash heap 
---
Low effort? Do you know how hard it was to be this clever? Super duper hard. So how about you super duper shut the hell up?
---
It might just ignore her.
---
Ah, gotcha. Yea, considering how strong your bots could get, making sure they don't break game balance would be a challenge 
---
And now I have no diluted stimpaks :'(
---
Ya. I think most people haven't experienced an online multiplayer before, they're mostly clueless as far as their surroundings go... never mind coop play
---
Sounds like its set to be a great update, and really looking forward to the new PvE things to be added weekly
---
Its a hard drop from census violence in the bogg im currently trying to do them no luck as of yet but one guy said he did the event like 60 times for one of them 
---
I expect customer service to forward my issue to developers or higher if my issue can't be resolved by them.  Just like anywhere else. And yes my name is Karen.  Karen knows what she is talking about, y'all keep getting pushed around by the man.
---
I am pretty sure that I have purchased three TSE weapons for which I paid 12k total from dupers. Poof! Gone. Oh, well. I went over to my friend's house so I wouldn't feel the end to log-in and find myself heartbroken over my items being removed. Can't resist the urge. Guess I'm a glutton for punishment. 
---
Agreed. I keep posting "ok, bye." every time I see a post like this. Bitch quietly in a corner. It's a game, Uninstall if you don't like it. There are plenty of us that do, and plenty of other games for those that don't. 
---
Why do it over the internet?
---
4 shots to down a mole rat? Git gud bruh
---
Just as you dear BOS members have to accept that I will kill every vertibird/vertibot/cargobot etc that I come across. Because what did you guys make those out of, cardboard and chewing gum?
---
better than drinking the MAGAKoolaid old man
---
Fool please, everybody new they were buying duped items for cheap. If taking away a weapon or two is going to ruin the game for you then it probably wasn’t all that good to begin with.
---
No.  Doesn't seem to work with the Mistress of Mystery item level crafts either.  (Garb, Blade of Basset, Voice of Set, etc).  I tried a few times to see if I could get another Blade to give to my friend who dropped his not knowing he couldn't make another.
---
What's the recon bug? 
---
If you look at the actual search results and not just the autocomplete, all the studios have lost of posts and videos. It was made into a meme with Bethesda, which is why there is so much more in the search results and autocomplete hits it, this isn't surprising. Heck, the Bethesda meme is even used in posts about other game studios, thus upping its visibility even more.
---
That last line of yours, they lied about the stash **before launch** before the Beta even, not after. Problems reading again?
---
You're hilariously wrong, but the bottom line is, there is no reason to doubt that when they say this will affect a small percentage of players they haven't already run a query and know that their algorithm will only affect a small percentage of players. Even less-so since they are in damage recovery mode with the game.
---
This is my last reply as this whole thing is a waste of time considering you are someone who is completely reliant on anecdotal and irrelevant "proof" and believes that a few cases of pre-release bad information and a meme support . 
---
Here are some actual relevant posts you can wrap your head around, based on the responses, I wouldn't say that Bethesda lying about Fallout 76 is considered the "status quo" and the only "lies" I see people pointing out were details that were communicated pre-release when the game was still in development:
---

---
Have a nice day, and I'll see you in the wasteland, stay in school!
---
I found the best way to take this guy down is a .50 cal machine gun .. it's a pain. Also if you on a team, you can get at least 2 - 3 nuke cards from the same container. Everyone on the team can grab a nuke card, if you quickly switch to an alt character while on a team, there is just enough time to let your alt grab one as well, I generally get 3 cards from each cargobot myself.
---
Well shit
---
I really love this game, like any other Fallout. I play alone, you can play alone and i think is better, i take all my time to do what i want and read and hear every terminal, holotape.  
---
On PS4 Pro when released had a few FPS prblems, but now it runs very well
---
It is definitely a unique way to balance the game
---
None of that helps with server load.
---
If you’re on PC, I can make calibrated shocks for your excavator armor. You just have to give me the materials. I also have a pair of t60 legs for sale with shocks. That’ll add 100 lbs to your varying capacity. 
---
I laughed super duper hard at this comment. Not so much the post. 
---
Do you want them to wipe your ass when you're done too?
---
Saved up the 20000 caps to buy the marsupial serum plan.  (I already have the mutation but I want to be able to make the serum for friends and other players)
---
Ran over to the enclave bunker, logged onto the terminals, grinning as I thought how excited my teammates were gonna be when they could hop around like kangakongs.
---
Paused at the buy screen—-20000— that’s a lot of caps—a lot of the same old boring vendor run—but fuck it! What else am I gonna use the caps for?  
---
Clicked quickly through the next few prompts.  
---
Fast travelled back to my camp giggling like guy.
---
Pulled up my pip boy to learn the recipe.
---
Realized I had bought the chameleon plan instead.
---
Fuck.
---
Well, i stand corrected. Bethesda obviously is ready for a next stash increase. BRING. IT. ON.
---
But they are going to take it out on everyone who isn't an exploiter who accidentally purchased a duped weapon. They should have early on put a tag on duped stuff so you knew not to buy it.
---
And non exploiters. It’s like burning down a neighborhood to get a single criminal that lives there. 
---
Thats cool I like that
---
too late now. better to just haphazardly run a script and hope for the best.
---
did we delete something you rolled yourself? oh well, lol. remember we can't restore stuff, just remove it!
---
Ha, I know a couple people that had mass sell offs last night and made like 10k caps before they got tired of trading. 
---
I'm wondering how many torsos with jetpacks will be gone, how many excavator PA legs with calibrated shocks attached, things like that. The things people don't think about that could be messed up. 
---
If somebody learned the Marsupial Serum recipe from a duped plan, are they going to take that away? I really doubt it. Of course there's no way to know until we get our updates done. 
---
Yeah, this is one of the reasons I have concern. It's entirely possible they found a way, but... I don't have high hopes.
---
I know about those, I don't consider them a game economy. 
---
Or the ones who say "I am level 350 with over 500 play hours. And I am out of content... this game sucks"!
---
that's how i got "The Woopsies"
---
Oh man, you're stressing over other players too much. I've encountered a true griefer *once*, in the whole time I've been playing, and then I wore them out by spamming frowny faces at them while they slap damage me.
---
I've had someone try to take a workshop I contested twice, but that is part of ownership. For the most part, people just wave and continue doing their thing. I usually take meeting someone lower level as an opportunity to get rid of known plans or extra meds. There are so many nice/cool people in game.
---
Can we get a way to "lock" items so we cant accidentally sell or scrap them? It sucks when the game lags a little and you scrap or sell a piece of important gear. 
---
They could, if they actually knew items were duped.  I believe they do not actually know, and are just targeting inventories of people with 100s of thousands and millions of pounds of items, and 10s of thousands of rare items.  Like they did with the previous bans and the +1500 lb hard limit on carrying capacity.
---
I agree OP. I guess they want a fair playground for the new highly anticipated pvp servers. Now everyone can use pipe pistols to hit everyone over the head with.
---
mmmph mmph sammich
---
I try to do it when I can, I'll hit them once then quick try and bring any passers by over to hit it
---
I bought alot of gear for my wifes account to help her out. she doesn't have the drive to farm like i do so yea I expect to take some hits. Alot of caps possibly lost, alot of time put into it. Regardless the set back will be worth it. Another step forward towards ending duping and removing duped items hopefully for good.
---
Worthless items cull themselves. Just examine a few cash registers for proof.
---
I wish I found or knew more players like the lot of you in this post!!
---
You realize this is the inside th vault for this week right and they literally said the wild wasteland is going to be weekly events challenges and pve content 
---
I've fairly consistently heard a lot more people who play on consoles complaining about griefers than on PC. Different community I guess :/
---
Nobody is playing.  This won't improve your gripes with the game or the fact you don't have a TSE shotgun and are always running out of ammo and spending all day crafting it and never run into other players in game.  This is a momentary distraction.  Game will not change.
---
I've undoubtedly got some duped items. They were pretty much the only recognised trade fodder once the recipe and rare mods markets got absolutely trashed aside from a few specifics. Won't hurt too much to lose them though as there's pretty much no trading market these days anyway.   
---
Bethesda's comments about an 'in game market' are pretty laughable. What still exists does so despite them, not because of them. These days it's all about the unyieling/sentinel anyway, and when that inevitably gets nerfed to appease the pvpers on their shiny new servers, it's hard to see what people will want to trade for other than pointlessly filling their plan and recipe lists with plans and recipes they'll never use.
---
Haha bless your little soul
---
 Really, how would that work?
---
Alrighty. I feel bad for anyone that did buy something, I just don’t think, in proportion to how many people play the game, that many people actually bought weapons. Have a good day!
---
They already made such statements indirectly though 😂
---
That sucks . they need to get a handle on that issue I know how frustrating that gets was same on PlayStation but seems better now not sure if if regional and what servers you get or what? Need more input to get to bottom of this. They kept telling me it was console and not them but miraculously after first big update everything worked hang in there but keep dropping tickets Bathesda support dreads the name Dick Fiddler!
---
Um, yes..lots of Derp here. If you haven't logged in for that long then why follow any of this game on Twitter and reddit, etc... I will say to you what I say to everyone spouting nonesense...
---
"Ok, bye"
---
Now please Uninstall the game and go play Apex.
---
I know you’re busy catering to your emotions, downvoting folks who disagree with you and all that, but PVP is totally fucked and I don’t find ‘mandatory pacifist mode’ to be a real solution.
---
Yes, I spent a long time defending this game too. I get where you’re coming from. It sucks and people are mean, but that doesn’t mean we all live in the alternate dimension with you where these things make complete sense.
---
&gt; I can't stand around getting shot for ever waiting on someone to tag a 3\* before I kill it. So drop what ever you're doing and come get your loot. 
---
Or, if it's the robots in Watoga, it's "I can't keep following this robot around while it flees from me forever, come tag it, dammit!" Is it just me, or do the legendary robots in Watoga often not fight back and instead try to get as far away from you as possible?
---
Personally, I haven't been complaining. I have a concern that they'll fuck it up, but I'm reserving my judgement until that happens, and if they don't, great! 
---
Really the only time I have been actually upset about anything around this game is when the patches rolled back previously fixed shit, like the bobby pins for example. 
---
Now, I can't speak for anyone else, but some of em definitely seem to be going WAY hard on this. :(
---
where do you buy loot boxes and free to play is scheduled for when?
---
false claims and bullshit do happen.
---
My X-01 Torso with Jet Pack that was maliciously consumed by Mamma Dolce has finally been avenged
---
Well other effects were garbage so...
---
You mean the crutch that kept me from being pigeonholed into melee to kill the queen without her being a massively boring bullet sponge?  Too late, already melee.  I don't get all the zeal for people to lose good weapons, especially those who weren't actively involved in duping.  Reveling in the loss of others is a sad way to be.
---
I use to sell raids runs and services in destiny 1 the majority of buyers were x hardcore gamers who now had families and cant play as much as they use to but still want end game items, handicapped people def or missing a arm mostly where they couldn't really raid and very very few little kids like everyone says who's buying these services.
---
I don’t think you understand, he is right next to me.  
---
Atom store would be selling only skin for Backpacks that would be dropped like any other rare items ingame.
---
This way the caps I paid for my dupe items get wiped out along with the deep I bought along with all the Caps from all the grape nuker's that the dupers duped
---
800 is not enough. ideal:
---
1. unlimited for junk
---
2. 2000 for gerars and weapons.
---
Just another thing that pre beta testers should have flagged, and bethesda should have implemented before launch... 
---
Don’t waste your time on it ichigo! Have a blessed day
---
i'M rOLepLaYinG a rAiDeR!!1

I have played and bulked and sold bulked items with Super Duper since BETA and Super Duper has never triggered on a bulk item creation.
---
I'm impressed (!), this is really cool. Taking requests? Jk, nicely done.
---
So the longer you play the less rewards you get?
---
Does that mean I have to hold your beer all week?
---
Woooshing is fun tho. It allows for more Woooshing to build off of. ;)
---
junk

ANY TRUTHERS IN THE CHAT?

Who let this nutter out ? You need to get over to For Defiance and pick up one of those straight jackets
---
You THINK you'll reopen shop tomorrow :P
---
None without action. That's the point.

Oh shut up \*pockets Zenimax check\*
---
I'd love to have an officer backpack! Maybe with some customization options too. Maybe change the beeping tone so players aren't constantly frustrated by finding some rando wearing an officer pack instead of an actual officer. 
---
Lol I already have 6 sets of PA in mine....:)
---
Nice to hear that i could open your vision a bit, like my self befor :)
---
have fun with your new mutations and a little bit more... POWER \`;..;\`... XD
---
He said it on the internet, that's basically a smoking gun.
---
It was nerfed, yes, but it still only takes 5 points to get 60% damage increase vs the 3x3x3 for every other weapon. 
---
Real question: Two headed cows = moo moo
---
Two headed deer = radstag

VERT-DE-FURK!!!
---
my fav f76 moment was VATSing a squirrel from point blank range (because you cant hipfire at or melee anything too close to you in Bethesda games), with 95% accuracy i shot once in front of it, once behind it, and third shot killed the squirrel
---
Junk.  It's all junk storage.
---
I don't keep spare armors or weapons I don't use.  Beyond the non-replaceable ones like Mistress of Mysteries rewards.
---
Junk has more value to me than anything else in the game.  Lever Action, Handmade, Melee weapon are the three I carry.  Ammo for each gun, the other ammo I discard.
---
It's a Bethesda patch.   
---
Something like that will probably happen accidentally anyway.  
---
I'm half expecting to log in and find every single weapon in the game has vanished and all ammo quantities at 999999 (including nukes and missiles, obviously)
---
&gt;Not defending who you are replying to, but leaving the United States is rather difficult to do.  Apart from the emotional burden of leaving friends and family, the IRS will still follow you unless you renounce your citizenship.  
---
Uhh renouncing your citizenship is easy, and the other one applies to literally every country ever
---
Perfect misspelling 
---
people got banned for using graphic mods, quality of life mods like inventory manager, or even reshades which only pep up the picture produced by your graphic card.   
---
If you manipulate the game in any way, you could get banned.   
---
If bethesda would add it (they won't), it will cost 20usd each sound.
---
I'm super duper happy to hear that you laughed super duper hard at my super duper comment
---
You can only be so helpful... if you've sent a head's up and no response... have at it and don't look back. 
---
It's cool that you're even trying to signal the legendaries presence... most of the time I don't even bother. Unless I'm in a team. :)
---
I believe it. I've seen some people fight tooth and nail for this game with not much logic to their argument. On the flip side I know people who DO genuinely like the game and think it's worth playing; I digress, the publicity Bethesda is getting is not good at all, so it would stand to reason that they might pay people to go be shills and shamelessly defend the game. Which I have seen and feel like they could be paid actors, essentially.
---
&gt; What are you going to add to your stash with +200lbs?
---
Accumulate 300 pounds of stuff and ponder what needs to go :(
---
Yeah, I'll be giving it up now too :/
---
Although I'm still delighted with the level 30 bloodied explosive pipe rifle I got a couple of weeks back. That one's going to help my alts through a few levels for sure :)
---
Lol nice 
---
junk, and I may be able to actually fast travel instead of always being overweight and having to walk (for a couple hours anyways, before i fill that back up too. lol)
---
Reported for rumor without evidence. pretty sure clickbait and spam rules would apply too.
---
I don't want to diminish your friends negative experience and how frustrating it was for him but I'll give my 2c on this situation. Griefers feed off reactions; more than likely your friend was giving them some kind of response which encouraged them to keep doing it. It's like this in all online games.
---
My advice is, the best response is to either ignore these people, or block them or leave the game. Personally I don't block people without extreme reason, which in this case sounds like it may have been justified. I would have changed servers and moved CAMP.
---
Absolutely do not voice frustration through microphone or emotes, this will make you a target.
---
I'm going to go back to collecting Missiles accidentally until I run out of space and then I'll start dropping them again.
---
One problem with your theory -- higher level = higher damage stops being a factor after level 60 or so.
---
Lol. I'm not so hard on them. Fallout games are so much more intense than say, GTA. There is so much cool stuff to interact with in every room, whereas GTA is a big world that you can't touch or move anything in. This is their first go at a multiplayer. I'm fine with stability being a bit shitty. I'm still having lots of fun playing it
---
Your post always read like a bot forced to read every post on this sub then told to write its own. 
---
I think they do cause autism? From u.k here, kinda aware  of the u.s anti vac issues, but my big sister had a perfectly healthy baby boy until hours after his mmr jab, now is heavily autistic..
---
Wow.
---
I can't even begin to wonder how your mind came up with this.
---
best of luck on your crusade.
---
If we think of duped items as an STD, we all know that abstinence is the best form of protection. Not exactly the most fun method.
---
I'm a pretty active member, not a circlejerk, just not full of so many professional whinebaggers. 
---
Gamestop sale. I had $ 5 in power up rewards also. 
---
Oh wow. That's a pretty creative way to use that spot and I love the interior decorating!
---
If you don't mind, where is this? I love to move my camp back into the mire.

Shhhh, don't tell Bethesda, I've been running a dupe factory for those things, I had the market cornered.

Post TSE nerf this game was a ghost town 
---
Lol. K

Need to craft a lead condom next time.

Wise and well thought out comment..

I have a decent pvp camp set up right now, works pretty well when your wanted n ppl come to fight!!!

“Meme talk”?
---
Baby Boomers bitch at Millenials for avacodo obsession and laziness. Millennials bitch at Baby Boomers ruin the economy and planet. iGen Z snorts Tide pods, uses Meme talk, and then yeets into traffic.

Generation X stands in the distance, watching it all and shaking their head.

I was mostly running it for raider linings. Still never seen one.

Yup! That’s how you earn free atoms :)

I don't want to sound condescending … but caps are literally thrown at you in this game.  Server hop until you find Whitesprings nuked.  Do the circuit...golf club...cabins...work/storage area...more cabins...back to golf club.  Do that for 1-2 hours...get 20-30 legendary items.  Of those, only 2-5 will be interesting.  Instigating, Bloodied, Two Shot 1\*'s.  Maybe if you are lucky a couple 2-3 star items.  Post those on reddit..that translates into 2-5k caps off legendary items per run.  Then add to that all the inert meat, glowing blood, hardened, etc that you pick up that others leave.  They are work 7-16 caps per piece.  Each Whitespring run I make 6-8k caps.  Rinse and repeat.
---
That is one of of 3-4 ways I earn caps. 
---
Honestly I'm not too worried about it. My only experience with duped items is that one day I saw a couple people doing it so I snuck up and stole everything in their paper bag. Most of it just got thrown out or sold but I held on to a couple items. I've used them enough so I guess they had a good run. RIP my stolen duped items.
---
Some items weigh a bit less

Often when unloading stuff at a vendor-bot, after the bot only has a handful of caps left I will rummage through the junk in the room to sell for that last ~12 caps or so.  This generally involves me running  through the room and spamming "A" (on XB1)
---
One time in Whitespring station I was doing this and when scanning over the vendor (he's surrounded by glass bottles) the game somehow opened a trade window and sold him my bloodied handmade, then closed.  
---
Luckily I noticed I could not equip my primary weapon shortly after.  I figured out what happened just as some other guy waltzes up to the vendor (probably to sell his own crap).
---
Luckily for me he didn't see/buy it, so I was able to retrieve the gun with only a loss of a few hundred caps.  
---
Ever since this event, I always check weapon &amp; armor tabs before leaving a vendor bot...
---
See, I missed these statements because I don't dupe and therefore wasn't on the lookout.
---
I assumed your OP was whining that bethesda should have warned you not to trade with dupers.
---
That’s also where I got the power armor edition. 
---
Lol. That doesn't work in the real world, why would it work for a game world? Go buy some stolen car from someone and let me know how it goes while you're trying to plead about what's "fair" while they're towing away the vehicle. 
---
I saw a guy at the power plant by Watoga solo fighting 3 deathclaw and a scorched beast. I ran over and helped him. 3 more deathclaws spawned and we killed them all.
---
As we ran into Watoga we ran by a 3* and I stopped. My new buddy kept on running as I stood there waving him back. I finally just killed the damn thing but I felt horrible that after everything we just went through together that the guy didn't get that easy loot.
---
Weapons! Weapons! And mooore weapons! I'm attempting an rp as an arms dealer so I'm going to to hoard weapons. 
---
That’s too bad 
---
This is a little too obvious of a troll.
---
I've always been a fan of the Auto Grenade Launcher. I can to do some pretty good DPS against the SBQ with Demo 5, Grenadier 2, Bloody Mess, and of course damage-boosting chems.
---
But I wanna hold all of my million teddy bears
---
You don't get to sue for fraud in this situation. You're out $10 000 and can do literally nothing about it. 
---
That's what I'm trying to get at. In real life there would be an avenue that we could pursue to try and regain our losses. Not here, not for the people who bought duped weapons not knowing. 
---
Just those two?
---
I am going to back OP here. 
---
It is fine to be upset at a game, but what OP is getting at, and I agree with, is you are fighting a war we don't give a shit about. Fight your war with your wallet. Don't buy the game. But quit trying to shit in our cereal bowl because YOU don't like it. You want us to quit with you so Bethesda gets the message. Fuck that. leave me alone!
---
You are fighting a war to ensure AAA studios make perfect games from top to bottom that meet every single one of your demands. You are fighting a war to ensure games being made fit your personal description of good or fun. 
---
Buddy, we ain't in that war. we don't care. 
---
I have made a couple posts, all running along the same lines of OP, and they generate hundreds and hundreds of comments. Half of them are all the same: "you must work for bethesda" "you like shitty games" "how can you support Bethesda ripping us off" "you are just a low intelligence gamer" "you are ruining gaming".
---
A huge swath of people do not live and die on video games. We just play them man. We like them. they are a hobby. I am a grown ass man, with a full time job, a wife and kids and house and mortgage and a life that doesn't involve me spending 10 hours a day glued to a computer monitor. 
---
If I like a game, I play it. if I don't, I quit. If I am out $60, so be it. But I make my own stands. I speak with my wallet. and I leave everyone else out of it. When I speak up, it is because people are trying to shit on my experience. that is when I get uppity. 
---
EA released Battlefront. I was super excited. OG Battlefront and Battlefront II were amazing games. Graphics looked good, game looked good... I got it. 
---
and I got no couch-co-op, like 4 multiplayer maps and 23 seconds of single player. It was a hot festering turd. 
---
So I didn't buy Battlefront II. fuck EA. 
---
But what I didn't do, is become so personally offended that I wasted my time and energy trying to get every human on earth to understand how upset I was, trying to get other people to hate it with me, and trying to lead the revolution. I let other people play it if they wanted. It ain't my problem. I just know that I wasn't going to support them in the next one. and based on the loot box fiasco, I probably made a good choice. 
---
I should have taken that into account and indicated I wasn't accusing.  Sorry!
---
Yeah Todd, take away all of my caps that I’ve gotten the right way from selling stuff to vendors and actually worked to get. 
---
No OP, your idea is absolute shite.  
---
I'm assuming you have at least 500 molded plastic for no reason whatsoever?
---
Soooo, muchhhhhh wooooooooork.  :D
---
Dude, you've posting negative comments all fucking day now. Get a life.
---
“Vampiric” lol i wish it was called that, would sound so much cooler than “vampire’s”
---
I have a problem with keeping every 3* piece of armor that I find.  That problem will fill the gap.
---
I came across a lvl 50 all rise at the vendor. had to buy it. Now we'll see if it disappears upon next login :)
---
Youre not far off
---
I wouldn't mind my learned recipes purged at least then when I collect them again they might register on the mission/objectives for atoms.
---
According to the thing I have only learnt 6 when I've learnt most of them
---
Ya and niw anything we bought on there is going away if it was duped. We have no way if knowing.  So bethesda saud , no trading in game, use reddit. So i used reddit. Now im being told you shoukdnt have used reddit for trading. 
---
Wtf . To be honest , fuck this game either way. This shit's silly. I vant believe we have to even have this conversation. 
---
Honestly it just means I can go longer before I realize I have way too much junk I dont need or wont use and have to clean it out
---
I love this game! It is the best game ever made! I have never experienced a single bug and, quite frankly, its stability is second to none. I look forward to the Bethesda team's continued flawless updates and improvements to the game. I am so impressed with the games quality that I have had my daughters name legally changed to Todd "The Bod" Howard. Everyone should play this game, even small children as it teaches wholesome life lessons that will shape them into exceptional adults!
---
How many items did you lose in the purge? :-)
---
I was minding my own business in watoga last night and one was flying crazy low, aggro'ing the local bots. So i jumped in and after a ton of ammo out my pipe revolver rifle,  took it down, didnt realize i couldnt open it without creating a bounty. total waste of ammo. lol
---
Same thing I always stash, pinky. Junk, Ammo, and Outfits!
---
Eso does it all the time.  You fucking idiot
---
The issue has always been damage resistance in my opinion the weapon damage could use a touch too.
---
I've seen tricentennial edition as low as $29.97 at Costco for XB1/PS4, It's been as low as $19.99 at Meijer with rewards membership: [https://slickdeals.net/f/12722422-fallout-76-19-99-at-meijer-w-mperks-24-99-without](https://slickdeals.net/f/12722422-fallout-76-19-99-at-meijer-w-mperks-24-99-without)
---
Prices were low during 2018 holidays though they seem to be around $40 now.
---
I only ever bought items for caps and I only bought from people on r/Market76.  I just made sure the person I was responding to had a Reddit account with some history.  I never got scammed, and I never saw posts from people saying they had been.
---
I figured that anyone using their 'production' Reddit account wouldn't want the downvotes and karma hit that would come with the negative responses to scammers.
---
At max bloody mess and max demo, a 40mm grenade from either the M79 or the auto launcher does 190 paper damage.
---
A perkless Gauss rifle does 225+ damage per shot.
---
Missile launchers tickle any enemy.
---
It seems quite a few enemies are resistant to explosions.
---
It just doesn't feel like it is in the right place to me, especially considering how expensive and heavy 40mm grenades and missiles are to craft and hold. Even with Ordinance Express I can't go crazy crafting ammo if I want any open carry weight.
---
Tell your friend to start a cow farm and maybe in a in a few years he will have enough money to sue them.
---
They are literally giving updated every hour or so on the Bethesda message board 
---
This is my first online game. But I get the feeling that buying selling and in game economy are pretty big parts of online games usually. The fact that this one had s totally broken system is not encouraging. 
---
&gt;If you look at the actual search results and not just the autocomplete, all the studios have lost of posts and videos.
---
yes, and Bethesda has far more. only Rockstar comes close and it's regarding individual instances, not a broad spectrum like with Bethesda.
---
&gt;It was made into a meme with Bethesda
---
and why do you think that is in the first?
---
&gt;That last line of yours, they lied about the stash before launch before the Beta even, not after. Problems reading again?
---
I'm sorry, I just can't keep up with you moving the goddamn goalpost around.
---
&gt;You're hilariously wrong
---
it's the opposite. again, I can't prove a negative. the burden of proof really is on you. google agrees with me. so does the status quo. it's up to you to enlighten us peasants.
---
&gt;but the bottom line is, there is no reason to doubt that when they say this will affect a small percentage of players they haven't already run a query and know that their algorithm will only affect a small percentage of players.
---
yes, because if there's one thing Bethesda is known for -other than lying- is their ability to code.
---
&gt;Here are some actual relevant posts you can wrap your head around: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a18q0v/what_did_bethesda_lie_about/
---
wait a second, your source is reddit? seriously? at this point I might as well just spam you with knowyourmeme articles. they're probably more reliable, too.
---
&gt;This is my last reply as this whole thing is a waste of time considering you are someone who is completely reliant on anecdotal and irrelevant "proof"
---
I linked you google, the status quo and even used math to back my original claim. Bethesda is lying, the number of players with duped items is far higher. yet you demand me to prove a negative, teleporting goal post.
---
but ok, fine. have a nice day. and go back to school.
---
We are working on a larger comprehensive balance patch that includes fixes to durability and utility of Energy Weapons. We expect this patch to be available in March, but will be able to provide specific timing a little later.
---
Knowing Bethesda, we'll all load in and just get a mini nuke dropped on our C.A.M.P with a holo tape that reads "Hey assholes, thanks for buying our game." Listed as the journal of Todd
---
Bethesda support is like all other support, depends on who you get and how bad they want you to go away.  Never take support response as fact.  I have been there too often.
---
Haha nah just laughing at people that traded with dupers like it was no big deal 
---
Yeah, why I don't know. 
---
Yeah little farm bots would be cool
---
Several hours is apparently at least 4....  impatient finger taps...
---
Ya I'm fine with the % value. They just need to fix base damage on certain weapons.
---
Did you just buy the game?
---
Doesn't a turd in the punch make the whole bowl garbage? I wouldn't drink from it
---
It will let people who want to PVP go PVP, but griefers will still abound since PVPers aren't their target audience.
---
The only problem is that you don't know which is which.
---
If ya think about the liklihood of a false hit the more specific the better.
---
Any given mod by itself - massive false possitive rate
---
Specific Combo of 3 mods with specific CND bar - massively low false positive rate
---
Generic Inventory Item - massive false positive rate, BUT can establish likely realistic possession numbers and remove violators easily.
---
So basically I doubt they will remove ANY 1 star items and likely be pretty accurate in what gets removed. I think they will err on the side of caution and we will see plenty of "Lol BGS didn't remove my duped TSE Rolling Pin" posts.
---
it's a waste of resources. and based on their patches it's not like they have any to spare.
---
i’ll dm you because i don’t want this to become a popular spot! 
---
I used to spam the Knox armory with that hole in the ground trick, and walk around in there without a timer lol
---
Falling off the bridge after stopping to equip my power.
---
Are the servers up? Still down from what I see.
---
Let’s not forget the generator smoke going through walls! Lol
---
I only have the basic generators atm so no matter what I do I can’t get the smoke out!
---
While you aren't entirely in the wrong here, even if you are trolling. bethesda probably (and this is my own bullshit speculation) considered how much damage a full wipe would do to the game and decided against it. 
---
My experience is much the same, but weapons/armour/mutations all seem to contribute.
---
 Add me bkazemarko99
---
This guy is just a troll. Ignore him and move on.
---
Understandable, and thank you!
---
I wonder if my 3 star pool stick is now gone? \*rolls eyes\*...Really has anyone else gotten this drop from a legendary? A pool stick?
---
Having the development team handling individual player issues is a waste of resources.  Or do you expect them to spend time trying to figure out if it was a bug, or if dumbass Karen accidentally vendored another item for the 11th time this week? 
---
It could be feasible if they shrunk the circumference of the nuke zone and/or made it so only certain areas could be nuked no? I don't think I'd be a fan of the latter.
---
Question about the changes to camp damage and becoming wanted. Since it says you have to destroy the object to be considered wanted what's stopping players from coming up and destroying 99% of my walls just to be a pain in my ass knowing as long as the wall is standing I'll be the aggressor and become wanted if I attack them? I do like the fix but maybe make it when you do x% of damage to another players camp item rather than 100% you become wanted
---
That's cool man, and you're entitled to play that way, so why are you so mad about those of us who want to do the endgame content that was provided by Bethesda and don't like how it works right now?  It's okay if you want to be extra special and unique, but many players' main goal is not to just be different.  Some of us get fun out of finding the strong builds and that's why the concept of game balance exists and is emphasized by most AAA developers.
---
Well, the restrictions to where you can nuke makes complete sense. If V76 and it's surrounding areas could be targetted you'd wipe out newbies all the time. It's the literal starting area of the game, you can't allow that to be bombed.
---
super duper pooper scooper needs to be a new legendary 3\* melee weapon. Fast swing speed, furious effect, +1 strength and adds poison damage!
---
Agree!!
---
No, you're not "too opinionated." You are ignorant and spreading misinformation.
---
Your main point was that nothing has been done and that this game is no better than beta. That is a flat out lie and bullshit. Shills aren't downvoting you. People who actually play the game and have a functioning brain are downvoting you.
---
This game is in the process of improving. It was released unfinished, and unfortunately they have to improve it on the fly. Don't discredit whats been done because you are salty. This game has come a long way, and it still has a long way to go before it's in a good place. Ignorant shitposts like this only work against that.
---
Hadn't heard this.  Any increase is welcome.  But even if it were doubled, I would still fill it in a few days.  Maybe like 8000 space would take me a while to fill, but it would still get filled.
---
I think I just have to get accustomed to letting things go.  Still sucks everytime I need junk that I just got rid of.
---
$84 for pre-order (+tax) tricentennial version from Bethesda's website before BETA. Plus 500 hours of my time at $200/hr, so I have spent about $100,084 total on FO76.
---
Sad but true.  They should remove PvP from adventure mode, and make them separate PvE and PvP servers.
---
I remember the unwarranted freak out like it was yesterday. Hosted a New Years party and cut the main breaker at midnight for fun. Good times:)
---
Man, every break at work I'm trying to see how much damage was done...still under maintenance!!! It'll probably be done by the time I'm home and can see for myself....and then xry myself to sleep. LOL
---
Theory edited: overpowered leads to less reward
---
Barbed Walking Cane mods
---
200x
---
Curious if you lightly hit this with a heat gun will it smooth out the surface?
---
Please look into balancing the flamer ammo. It costs so much resource and only creates 5 fuel. That's ridiculously low for how much it burns (100 goes in like 2 seconds).
---
stash is full, so I'm always rolling those dice... cant resist the rads though. lol
---
Maybe enjoy the party without any punch? Have a beer instead? I really don't know what my point was.
---
This dude out here calling people shills for real hahahaha 
---
Probably not use it. I'm use to managing inventory like it is now. Maybe if I stumble across a good legendary for a different build I might keep it around for a bit. But prolly not. 
---
Yes, and boards and rolling pins. 
---
Flux and Fusion Cores
---
Because being a VATS rifleman build means I tear through those things.
---
Unless I bought a second hand dupe. Not from a duper but from a player who traded with a duper. 
---
It's probably more effective than the ones in the game.
---
I pre-ordered for $60 but i played Skyrim and Fallout 4 for free so i don't mind that the game went 90% off next month.
---
I was hoarding ammo too and then I test fired an Assaultron Head. RIP all of the Fusion Cells I've collected since launch.
---
Ive never even seen the serums in the wild. I know they allegedly are for sale in the bunker sometimes. They also allegedly drop from the queen sometimes. Ive never seen either.
---
I honestly wonder if most or all of them came from the developers' bunker
---
Ha. Cute. Never thought I'd say that about turret. 
---
Wow, he must be really hard up for friends if he has to put up with that kind of stupid shit upon arriving to visit and hang out.  Even if you're justified get some fucking class bud.  Gross.
---
Set up a bunch more water purifiers and store the overflow and all the spice containers I horde.  Some more ammo and a couple nice guns and once the store update drops, I can open Arrakis Arms.
---
I just droppd 10k on an AAE handmade a week or so ago....fuck me, man, I hope that thing wasn't duped. Only seen 2 or 3 floating around on Xbox. Pretty sure the lvl 35 version with reduced weight got duped though.
---
for pvp guys
---
All the junk I carry so I can stop feeling like Lydia from Skyrim. I  believe she has cursed me for making her carry all my weapons. 
---
Nothing so disappointing
---
My bet is after this patch there will mostly be casuals left who play a few times a week. So i dont think they are very fired up for pvp servers. Ofc some of the non casual players will stay but i dont think it will be enough. But just my guess...nobody can say for sure
---
Damn...you caught me.
---
Ahahahaha
---
Nothing beats a mic - it seems like emotes are a terrible way to communicate.  Get on the mic, and they'll drop everything and come over instantly!
---
Didn’t try it on an assaultron or nuke silo, wasn’t brave enough for that but when the daily or weekly challenge came up to kill a number of robots with protest signs I grabbed a couple repaired them to 200% threw on some P.A and set about bashing some bots lol
---
As much as I love this game and respect the people that made it... 
---
The canvas bag could have slipped passed Todd or Jeff... but idk about E3 footage. I really wish they hadn’t. 
---
Do a X-01, paint it and I'll buy it!
---
Ok so you had some bad experiences from some jerks, sure they deserve everything that is coming their way and more, but is that a reason to lash out in general at other players, most of whom you probably haven't even been on the same server with before?
---
I'm not defending anyone who duped or knowingly purchased a duped weapon but to randomly assume that the vast majority of players were exploiting the system and are guilty is a bit much.  Back when I was actively playing most of the people I had interactions with were surprisingly nice.
---
The sad fact is that there are going to be a number of people who truly didn't know something they received or purchased was duped and they are going to be victims of the whole situation just as much as you were a victim as they were taken advantage of as well. I know not everyone claiming innocence will actually be telling the truth but they also aren't automatically liars either if they express concern about potentially losing something.
---
Just keep in mind that it goes both ways and not all players are jerks looking to cheat you, there are actually a surprising amount of really nice players out there.  To someone who actually got taken advantage of, you might come off as the biggest jerk when you dont take their situation into consideration.
---
[more like the “i like turtles” kid](https://imgur.com/gallery/1KEcDG4)

I dropped an instigating explosive max lvl harpoon gun i got 2 days after release bcs I thought it wasnt that good ;-;
---
But the punch, bro
---
Why else go to a party but for the punch
---
&gt;fixes to durability and utility
---
Will energy weapons have increased damage?
---
yea it wont help much the people who grief are too scared to go do real PVP
---
 You go girl!
---
Hence the STD comparison
---
I think what irks me most about this approach is how it may (as we have no confirmation as to how widespread the purge will be) affect passionate casuals like my father. 60+, plays every single-player Fallout and Elder Scrolls game, and fought through all of the bugs to have himself a great time. He called me a couple of weeks ago ecstatic that he managed to spend most of his hard-earned cappies on a 3\* axe so he could Butcher Pete his way around the wasteland, permanently walking around in his Excavator because he refuses to trash anything. While I warned him that there was a risk because there's a chance the item was duped, it was great to know he had found the fun he wanted to have. If this wipe happens to land on him (or people like him), I'm not going to be able to say anything besides, "Well that's what you get for trading with people online". That sucks.
---
Being a level 200+ and having done **a lot** of event grinding / legendary monsters hunting, I can tell you this have nothing to do with your level / your gear / your character.  
---
While Whitespring farming doesn't reward you with good 3 stars legendaries for now, other events are a a guaranteed 3 stars, while it looks totally random with 3 stars monsters found in the wild (but you often have a 1 or 2 stars trash legendary).
---
TL;DR didn't see any consistent pattern except some events for legendary drop: most likely a bug
---
I've been rather lucky... most players I've met have been decent.. only had one asshole who killed me in my base, over a 20 cap bounty... one shotted me while I was putting something in a container.. then took all my junk while he was at it...
---
I’ve been playing this game since release. I’ve farmer white springs and other places literally hundreds of times, killed over 100 SBQ’s  and have never found a single god roll explosive. Happy farming to you my friend. 
---
 Reported for rumor without evidence. pretty sure clickbait and spam rules would apply too. 
---
In fallout 4 they would mutate and you were greeted with a system message informing you "enemy has mutated!" which and the health also went up instantly I believe.
---
In 76 there seems to be an glowing aura of sorts, which consumes its self once you get them to 50% and then they regen to full and stop glowing. It's poorly explained (no message) and the thing is, unless you can one or two shot these legendaries the "slow regen" is worse than healing instantly because it will also absorb your attacks while they heal, making it a poor idea to continue attacking during these effect. 
---
"People have different opinions that me they must be paid actors"

My house has been there since mid December, and I've yet to find a better spot. Only ever seen one other camp there that used the acid.

Fuck off tard

would love a buff to energy weapons. could finally rp as a BOS member

I just lean into my mic and yell "TEMBA, HIS ARMS OPEN!"

You do realize this is all free right.

I think you are a shill hired by dupers!

Boredom mostly, and coming home from work not wanting to play something that requires no thinking or whatever and a little bit of me not wanting to let go of the thought this game isn't what I thought it'd be

How many times is he going to post this and delete? I'll guess six

The list of excuses I have heard are;
---
I'm playing as a raider.
---
If Bethesda made end content stuff I wouldn't do this.
---
I'm bored.
---
This is a pvp game.
---
This is how survival is.
---
Your doors should have been unlocked.
---
Your camp is nicer than mine.
---
You get the point but, it falls down to they are annoying little twinks regardless of how they try to justify it.
---
"Make a hundred accounts" get a life lol
---
Conspiracy..... maybe it's aliens or Bigfoot 
---
I'm kinda scared. I hope they can really track it properly.
---
I just got the final piece to my 3* Weightless Marine armor set. If it's gone, I'mma be a sad panda.
---
When I saw my first nuke detonation, I loved the dust whipping past you...
---
Until I saw that the trees were static and didn't move.
---
I would love to see changes to the environment as well, but damn thats a lot of work.
---
&gt; Obviously the moderators are on the payroll too. If this is removed again, then I'm afraid I will have to make about 100 accounts and make sure everyone sees it, on every gaming subreddit, and spam it in every post. I won't be silenced.
---
Go to a psychiatrist; you need some help Alex Jones Jr.
---
Look at you! Reposting
---
Just curious. What do you think of The Last Jedi?
---
Great they're doing a purge.  I'm not a programmer, but couldn't they create a continuously running subroutine that targets multiple identical(legendary dropped) unique items present in one server to address and delete the dupe immediately before the exploit is found and corrected?
---
  Talking about the duper that carries or stashes 10 3*Whatever with identical stats, condition, etc.  The coding for unique legendary drops has to be specific to the 1000th decimal pt if not moreso.
---
O.o
---
Nah. 
---
Just a bit of sarcasm.
---
The game IS designed poorly and anyone that plays should know that if they want to actually have fun theyre gonna have to take sone lumps. Total trolling is one thing but in a game where the only recourse is to change servers, just change your server.
---
Perhaps if you provide a source or evidence you could avoid being ridiculed and having your post removed.  
---
It's pretty common to find plans, recipes and ammo in that suitcase.  I like to use it as an online swap meet.  I take any recipes that I need, drop off any already known ones that I have extras, and swap ammo.
---
Someone isnt happy all their duped shit is getting purged...
---
Yep, im usually a sucker for cosmetics, spent zero in their store.
---
I spent like $300 in warframe and like $500 on path of exile, I do have 2k+ hours each tho.
---
I‘m a millionaire now from all these earnings ...

"90% sure ALL MY GUNS are duped." &lt;-- "All I did was buy a couple guns"....You only have 2 guns? Or are YOU just full of shit? If it's 2 guns, quit whining. That's easy to replace. You go and make it sound like you have an entire collection of crap you paid thousands of caps for, that your inventory is fucked, but it's just 2 damn guns!? And you obviously watch Fallout 76 news enough to be on the fucking Reddit, so it's not like you wouldn't have heard about duped items, AND how Bethesda was planning on deleting them for the past fucking 2 months. You would have seen THAT if you just glanced at the update messages in your damn game launcher occasionally. Maybe you didn't know today was the day, sure. Too bad you didn't get a chance to sell off the stuff you knew was cheat gear, oh no! They caught you! Sounds like you were planning on holding on to, using, and abusing your OP crap for as long as possible, and missed the two day's notice they gave us so you couldn't sell it off. Your statements are contradictory, you either had a ton of duped shit or 2 weapons. If it was a ton of shit, you knew better. If it was 2 guns it isn't worth bitching on the forums about. My guess? You knew they were cheat guns, and you are mad that when you get home that OP stuff you were depending on will be gone. Which makes those of us who had to suffer through the waves of annoying people flooding the farming spots with explosive guns and stealing all the kills and XP, being griefed out of caps and loot by 2SE trolls, and not having the stuff we farmed legitimately be worth shit all because of the broken economy this stuff created, very, very happy to watch you douchers pitch fits over losing it. :)
---
Balls, man.
---
It smacks of 25k caps anyway what are you worried about you can make that back let's get it all cleaned up
---
I want bean farts. If I eat 10 cans of pork n' beans I should be making music.
---
I've been playing everyday since the beta. Prob almost 1000 hours. I love this game and its gonna take a whole lot more than a few thousand angry gamers to spoil my enjoyment.
---
/s :)
---
I always say "nice" when I pick a lock
---
This guy is next level, crazy good designs
---
I just scrub tons of snot yesterday because of storage full. 
---
Oh well...
---
I believe people who have spent hundreds of hours on a game have just as much a right to complain about it as anyone else, especially when it's an MMO. You know this is about more than just duped items, just because you're enjoying the game as, doesn't mean others don't have valid criticisms. I've invested between 3,200-3,500 hours into Guild Wars 2, purchased the expansions, spent hundreds of additional dollars for gem store content because I enjoy the game. I also complain about it all the time, the decisions or lack there of by ArenaNet frustrates many long time players. I get bored sometimes, take a break by playing another MMO for short while, but I always go back, despite my gripes because I love the game.
---
I haven't spent nearly as much time in Fo76, but I'd like to, I see the potential. The core issue of most complaints you'll find in 76 stems the fact Bethesda is doing almost nothing period; if you look at any other always-online game, their developers attempt to quickly fix glaring problems, instead of letting them fester, as well as provide clear details about what's changed. Again, Guild Wars 2 for example; ArenaNet reliably listens to player feedback and attempts to implement it if reasonable, they reliably release hot fixes/small updates at least every other Tuesday and with these releases, list absolutely ever single change they made. Nearly every MMO I have played does something similar, at the very least, they are transparent about their decision making to their player base. Bethesda has been practically dead silent to us since launch and done little to fix their game in a timely manner. There have been plenty of other games out there that started out terrible, only to be saved by the developers scrambling to make it all right; Bethesda has shown almost no signs they are willing to do so.
---
TLDR: I like spending time playing this game and have every right to make valid criticisms. Also, you're very rude for telling others to "eff off", just because you disagree with them.
---
yea hopefully they were not  duped because that was going on long before everyone heard about it
---
81 euros, total.
---
60 euros for my copy, preordered
---
21 euros for one copy for my cousins, one month later.
---
Stealth mechanics are still really bugged. Is there going to be a fix for it in this patch?
---
How long ago did you buy?
---
Did you not hear me? I am Karen.  Get your god damn manager.  Waste of resources?????
---
Epic!
---
Preach!
---
I work with a massive oven so I am blessed with being able to experiment during down time. Cracker crust makes excellent dough. Wouldn't mind trying it with a puff pastry.
---
My point being - now its a policy choice rather than a lack of capability.
---
You are 100% correct. They knew about the issue from the start. They either didn’t fully understand the long-term economic impact or didn’t have any idea how to fix it. Either is terrible. 
---
I'm not doubting the part about seeding vendors with crap to allay the inevitable, but are you talking about the walls of tactical marine gelmtsd you'll see on vendors at times? That is a CHEAPLY craftable item (with easy though grindy to find plans) that sells for 13 caps even for my completely uncharismatic guy. Same with the Halloween witch costume (THAT was unfun to grind and the hat plans are bugged, resulting in nothing learned).
---
This place came close -

Lead, water, black titanium deposit, waterfall.
---
But the location of TiptheRat Lake (honest, thats what is called on google maps) pushes it to 1st place for me.
---
Yeah ive heard that also, i know one isnt bcs i got it as a drop, other unlikely but yeah i can hope
---
I don't want to burst your bubble but the chances that all of these are non-duped is pretty small.  I think your hope really is - since I only bought 4....or since I bought 4 a long time ago....Bethesda won't take mine and they'll be worth a lot of caps.
---
Yes, they COULDN'T. Hence why they took the fucking time to put together a script that could. 
---
It's based off of what level you are when you complete the quest. I wish I'd know that BEFORE I did the quest. 
---
😂😂😂
---
.... Found the duper!
---
How Bethesda does bans isn't particularly difficult to get around, if you really want to. Don't even wanna break it down and give dupers ideas, but the end result is being able to get your stuff back from friends not involved in the duping process who have mules for caps and gear. Considering the amount of in estment dupers tend to have, a lot of them know this, and will likely tilt the economy all over again... though I guess it'll level out eventually, if the game is still going that long.
---
Your reference included the total spent including the purchase price.
---
&gt;Lol we should all band together and lose our virginity 
---
Was thinking about the same, except I'm planning to show them how well the game is balanced when you are griefed by a player equipped with a legit (a.k.a. solo self farmed) full PvP gear (5 Anti-humans + Sentinel along with a TSE lever action looted on the queen itself, on a V.A.T.S + crit sniper build)
---
Hope they have cams to see their face when they realize :3
---
During beta to a week or two after release
---
♥️♥️♥️
---
I really want Forbidden Knowledge fixed. Every time I pick up Technical Data, it gets deleted if I already have one in my inventory. So I can only turn in one, and all I get from it is 10 purified water and a small amount of ammo, often 40mm Grenade rounds. 
---
I’m trying to farm the BoS T60 paint plans, and I don’t know of any other way to get them. 
---
u/Ladydevann, any word on a fix for this quest?
---
This is a false syllogism, basically what socrates discussed way back in the day if a=b and b=c then a=c, but logic tells us that isnt the case. 
---
Hah, correct indeed
---
I really want the dupes gone too man, and I get your point of view and my experience has gone much the same.  I farmed my butt off.  I also traded for some weapons for my friends who were really frustrated with the Queen, I think +10 karma on the trading subreddit or something like that, nothing major.  I really hope they don't come blaming me if their TSE Gauss or .50 disappears but i'm expecting them to.  I warned them about all this since they aren't on the forums but they probably won't understand - all they see is that their friend traded multiple legend drops of theirs for a more powerful one fairly, those weapons got nerfed, then now possibly deleted entirely.  
---
I don't like the tone Bethesda is setting with nerfs&gt;fixes, and I don't like that Melee is still the most OP thing that hasn't had any change at all from these patches but Bethesda continues to nerf, delete, and meddle with players' fun while doing nothing to enhance it.  Sorry if I misinterpreted your crutch comment but I hope you can see how this really doesn't look good from some perspectives especially people who never even come on here to debate this stuff.
---
Have you lost your items yet? No, no you haven't. So simmer the f@ck down and stop trying to wind up the room.
---
These little updates remind me Hue Jacksons press conferences. Just repeating the same garbage over and over and over and no results are ever yielded. 
---
You can now nuke the green zone... Hell that would be worth it just to nuke those damn mothman eggs.
---
If support doesn't have access to those tools it will be because management *chose* to not let them have it.
---
Oh shoot, and I love wine!
---
Hopefully you have at least 1 left over if you bought at that price 
---
One of my favorite things is when people are like, yeah, look around, let me give you the tour.
---
And I'm like: I like what you've done with the place. I'm stealing that idea over there. 
---
Hey U/Sockular,
---
I agree with all of your points, I'll be referring him to his post. Thank you for the advice buddy, I know he could use it.
---
SIncerely,

Jaayuk
---
The return of Macho Man Randy Savage Deathclaw, only for a small installment of 10,000 atoms at a store near you!
---
Of course, buy from player who completed it later.
---
It’ll happen someday. In the meantime I’m trying learn from the limitations. 
---
I only place turrets at workshops. For lighting, I first set it up so that each area is lit enough to see what’s important. Later, before moving CAMPs, I tend to move everything into the frames of the photos I take of my CAMP. As a slideshow, it would look like my budget is 3-4x the actual limit. 
---
Can confirm. A weekly I believe too. Good times. 
---
Same here bro. I keep going to remote areas and display them side by side so i can appreciate the craftsmanship and the smell of metal and oil in the wilderness. 
---
Just got one today outside of my camp...
---
Ive bought tses that i assume are duped since, but idk i bought one on like day 2 or 3 of beta, others within the first 2 weeks of release
---
&gt; All that is applying is bear arms and the reload speed perks.
---
They can also be Stabilized.
---
Bethesda's also planning on a "[larger comprehensive balance patch](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqlcu2/inside_the_vault_february_14_2019/eggzcy9/?context=1000)" so I wouldn't expect to see weapon damage values to change significantly before then.
---
Where’s the beef ? Lol ! Seriously though that sucks.
---
Penalty to sneak.
---
im just glad all the weapons/armor i currently use are all self found :)
---
I always put and encourage others to put stuff they don’t want in that ice box. 
---
&gt; Ammunition was too readily available in the game and outside of original design guidelines.
---
That is not entirely false. Ammo is a bit too easy in this game. Its to balance melee, I get it. I just don't agree with it.
---
I miss walking up to a settler and holding my gun in their face while shouting "I just want to trade a few things!" And take their two caps from them 
---
I have yet to see a post complaining about removing duped items. All I see are these kinds of posts conplaining about others complaining, when there is no one complaining. 
---
Nah. I don’t always know when I want to PVP or not so having dedicated servers for each would make the game more restrictive imo. 
---
They are not, at least on PC. 6 people on the entire server (that I could see), all in a nuke zone and the server grinds to a HALT. The queen's loot takes 5 minutes to show... the quest to kill her about as long. That is not stable.
---
I know ill have one bcs i got a tse combat shotty lvl 40 from uranium fever, but yeah hopefully a bought one stays
---
I'd be willing to wager there is at least a little bit of "sunk cost fallacy" involved. Sort of a "Well, I've put 300 hours in. Might as well keep going". 
---
Why do i get the feeling you are butthurt duper.
---
if they were smart about it they'd at worst deleted all but 1 of any of your legendary effect items you have multiple of and ensure duping no longer works. Not sure how to deal with 10,000 springs etc.
---
It's to late.
---
I understand there are a lot of people upset that they might lose a duped weapon and on top of that not get their caps back.
---
For those that say they didn't know...if it seemed too good to be true that's because it was. 
---
Further...if you buy something illegally in real life and that gets found out, even if you didn't know it was illegal, you are not guarenteed to get your money back.
---
The game is not broken, it's still fairly young. Just cope with it, if you can't then maybe take a break from it. Remember this game has only been officially out for a few months.
---
This isnt real life and duping isn't stealing... Im all for duped items being removed but to equate duping to theft is pretty disingenuous. But hey if false equivalencies and whataboutisms dont get your point across, there are a bunch of other logical fallacies you can engage in.
---
What happens if they're only neatly trimmed?
---
I'm glad you said "after eating" because at first I was like "Don't you autoscrap my only food source!!!"
---
Possibility one, punishing people who work/traded hard to get what they don't know is duped, they shouldn't be fucked over.
---
Secondly, Bethesda is gonna fuck this up and delete stuff outside the scope of what should be touched because they can't do shit properly.
---
If you folks have specific gameplay intentions with specific types of weapons, it would be great to hear some of them with an update like this, as to better understand why things work in a certain way.
---
I have crap legendary gear lol, so this only helps me for the new mode!! Got my first TSE the other day from another player too, I have a feeling I may lose it tho which is all good as I was having fun without it for months
---
Yes.  Like canned tuna in Rust.  You (hopefully) didn't eat the can.
---
If you have enforcer, take out 2 of its engines and let it sink closer to the ground, then take out the other 2. Use a machine gun and whittle down it's health. Rifles take forever but autos seem to take off more, even if you aren't perked for them.
---
Beer/lager bottles should give you caps 
---
I play bloodied as well, but I switch up my weapons often
---
Thank you for expressing my own thoughts!
---
Im wishing i hadnt sold some of my decent self found stuff now! I had an unyeilding sentinal piece that i found that i sold for a BE shotgun, so that might be bad
---
Bunch of elitism in this post, telling others how they should enjoy their game.
---
&gt; IRS will still follow you unless you renounce your citizenship.
---
On several levels that doesn't make sense. You don't know jack from moving into another country.
---
I feel ya. I'm not even a fallout guy. I played shelter and a little bit of fo4. Which i thought was just ok. But fo76 has been lots of fun.  I like the game, it's engaging enough and the gameplay is fun.  The story is different,  you need to choose to engage in it. Which i like.  
---
I do feel the disconnect problems have been my biggest beef. They fix that and i really love the game.  I missed out on some of the aspects of the game i liked because of them.  I liked to take workshops. The disconnects seemed to always happen after i took a few workshops. my caps were wasted, my mining was lost, and the time building my workshop was for not.  That was the only bummer for me. The rest is just normal stuff i think. 
---
I'll take a grape nuka cola and some fancy lad cakes, and some popcorn as well👍
---
None of this is a good situation, that’s for sure. 
---
Howd you like warframe? What would you compare it to? Ive only seen that one vid of 2 bards playing "pumped up kicks" (with their attacks...?) and was confused af
---
My friends and i went from eso to fo76 and we are looking for the next thing. They think black desert is gonna be it, but from what ive read the battle part of that game is very minimal. Im all.for crafting, but crafting like in eso or fo76 that's directly related to the combat. Not crafting "the game" so to speak. I miss eso, but my buddy likes playing healers and hates that everyone thinks healers are useless/unecessary in that game.
---
I thought anthem might be more promising, but they dont wanna try it because EA sucks dick and play to wins everything they touch.
---
ha..i rarely eat them..im always crafting my soup!!! part of my daily routine
---
Yeah man, totally. I've never even had two of the same legendary in my inventory at the same time.
---
We will see soon!
---
I gave it a good try (over 200 hours of play), but last week I went back to FO4 with mods and I am playing the game I miss so much in FO76.  Sorry Bethesda you have lost me after almost 10 faithful years of living and playing in the post-apocalyptic world.   Moving on to Metro Exodus tomorrow (Feb 15 release date here in Canada) and waiting for Obsidian's Outer Worlds to reset my "fallout fix".  I will always the love the game, just not the F076 vision.   
---
Since we don’t want peeps stealing stuff, I hope it’s just those closed display shelves that allow us to put select junk / guns / stuff on display. If I never have a reason to still be hoarding teddy bears, I just don’t what I would do. 
---
&gt;You couldn't wait to type that out could you. Keyboard warrior over here
---
"me argument flawed, me should insult! me seem big smart!"
---
You got the analogie wrong again, typical. It would be more like:
---
"Tomorrow we will confiscate all black BMW's from peoples homes because some BMW's have been stolen. No amount of legal dokumentation will help you, just consider yourself lucky your not thrown in jail."
---
Oh, and you suck. 8)
---
Thanks for the statistics!
---
Haha, I hope you accidentally acquired a duped item and burn with the rest of us :)
---
I'm not 100% sure but I think that much, if not all, of The Forest (the starting "area") of the map can not be targetted.
---
This makes sense. Depending on your perks though, the empty can may weigh more than a full one.
---
I don't think you were being an asshole, not in the slightest.  Fuck that turd.  
---
How prefixes work in game - handy bookmark btw.

Shitfire, dude, that's awesone.
---
I get just as much joy from dropping whatever I can for players below me. I'm lvl45. Last drop was 2 of every useful aid item I had and I used resources to make a 44 mag with all the goodies. I gave them 350 .44 rounds as well. The only downside is really new players sometimes don't understand your intent or communication via emotes. I have a mic but have never met another player using one (that I cared to talk to)
---
Better excuse than me - I just don't always use my headset when I'm playing.  Never been a big fan of headsets so I only use it when I need to.
---
Nah man, EVERY place serves up sandwiches with a little mold so just because this one's got some extra mold you should fucking eat that shit and smile and stop being a hater!!! /s
---
At least you aren’t giving up. I can’t say that I’ll be as optimistic when I log in to see all my weapons and my full set of BOS unyielding armor gone. I’ll probably be too discouraged to play again because I’ve spent literally 100k on items that are probably duped. Just gotta wait and see
---
10 bulk Aluminum
---
10 bulk Adhesive 
---
7 bulk Springs
---
50-150 Steel
---
Rest a bit less, 50 loose scraps etc.
---
I've got all the scrapping/repairing/modding challenges done so I don't need that much stuff anymore. 
---
I know right! 
---
I like it when there are weeds in my garden. Of course, they get tended like any other plant in the beds. But these are special little weeds. Very special indeed. These little weeds have the ability to keep me from kicking the shit out of every douchebag that I meet. 
---
His argument is they should get what they paid for.  If what they paid for was a dupped item, then having it taken away like a dupped item is what they paid for.
---
Are they worth crafting? What is your build/playstyle? I rarely take hits (cause stealth build) but I still have an abundance of Stims. I usually end up leaving them at Stations for other Players
---
Next patch - next week says 800. So. That was quick.
---
And what were those previous games… single player. How can you not see that FO76 being online clearly makes this a different case?
---
I also had encountered some high level enemies and got backpedaled into this guys base. His turrets and defenses bailed me put so when he showed up I dropped screws, springs and aluminum for him as a 'thank you'
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Try and keep a few more future proofed weapons. 
---
10$ on tse bundle all guns, game had zero content except farming for said legendaries, which was getting boring either way, so I wanted to see what all the fuzz was about before uninstalling...
---
Haha i like that idea 😊
---
&gt;ELI5
---
Go to your room, you're grounded.  Game isn't for 5 year olds!
---
Using exploits to duplicate items, weapons, etc. 
---
All in all, yes, but I don't want to spread the idea that if you send in a support ticket that the guy on the other end is choosing not to because it's probably not up to him.
---
Isn't Lead a valuable resource? That's my main squeeze
---
I'm managing my stock using a "threshold management"
---
=&gt; everything related to consumables such as ammo (lead, iron, bloodpacks, drugs): no limit, when I'm reaching my stash cap I start to craft ammo to deplete these
---
=&gt; for my most used and rare junk already marked as "Searched" (such as ballistic fiber): threshold set at 100 (everything above is bulked &amp; sold at vendors on a daily basis)
---
=&gt; for the least used junks (such as glass): threshold set at 50 (everything above: see previous)
---
As for stable fluxes, if you have mutation recipes or using prime receivers, you know how you should use them. Otherwise my threshold for these are 10 of each.
---
Just dropped my fatman last night, they are really worthless unless you just want to play around....
---
I would do that too but the only other weapon I have that doesn't suck some mighty ass is a modded Lever Action. I've not had any luck with decent weapon drops. Like, at all. I think the worst was the fucking Drill I got from a 3\* Ghoul in WS. 
---
Sorry, i have no empathy for cheaters.  If you can’t call your friends out for cheating, you have no spine.
---
as much lead as possible, 1 bulk aluminum, bunch of bulk rubber, some glass, good amount if plastic, 3 bulk gears and screws, 1 bulk of everything else. some gold and silver, 6x each flux, 10 hardened mass, 20 ultracite
---
i found really it takes about 30 mins or less to acquire plenty of anything to craft. even ultracite.
---
what happened to me was i hoarded everything early on and eventually realized what i need on-hand and what i can just go get when i need it.
---
I know it has been said, but why tf didn't they do this BEFORE the nerf? Ffs...
---
Really cool, game me some ideas for sure.
---
Ya, stabilized and one gun army as well, forgot about those.
---
Kinda what I was thinkin, sounds like BGS is rollin out PVP/PVE content at the same time
---
I'm more around 100+ of each mat, and up to 200 of some like ballistic fiber and screws.
---
I mean yeah, paranthesed items are considered vital. Realize my phrasing is weird
---
I think I got 300 cloth and leather to make armor then scrap it for mods too, but temporary of course 
---
Lol you can trick Bethesda. 
---
What a man and his power armor do in the privacy of remote wilderness is none of my business, I always say.
---
great idea! and why do we get bone from one of the metal containers? I forget which of the colored containers it was but when I scrapped it, it gave me bone...wtf?
---
Well, it's a Fallout game after all. There has to be room for people who are assholes.
---
You're probably right, but even so I don't mind; I always do my daily and weekly challenges, and CAMP items are always my #1 priority in terms of spending those points. There's been lots of stuff there I've been happy to obtain. 
---
This said, I really do hope they eventually add more wall and ceiling tile-sets in addition to floors eventually. I've been saying from day 1 that we need those glass greenhouse bits from the Fallout 4 warehouse set, especially since they're plainly already in the game, as we can see for example at the back of the Vault-Tec Agricultural building. 
---
I feel you. I regularly dump steel by the thousand. 
---
I like turtles and hope they don't cock it up and reset everyone to 0.
---
That would be ideal, we can only hope though.
---
We are looking into possible solutions for this, including making it so Pacifist mode carries over to your CAMP and it cannot be damaged.
---
i mean by your logic, your post history indicated that you're shilling AGAINST the game.
---
This is the new world we live in. Cry baby snowflakes that complain about a game. It's sad
---
Hey U/ShawnPin,
---
I'm glad you found this post to be of use! I almost dropped my beer laughing reading about the keyboard commandos in a bright alley haha. I agree with your moral position, playing an online game should be an honest and enjoyable experience. Both with regards to game design and the online community of the game itself.
---
If a game isn't designed with the basic ideas in mind that they want to manage the online experience of their customers in the best way for the most players, player reports, game exploits, and technical errors/bugs then it is inherently flawed. Good online game design should come down craftsmanship, concise code, in addition to an understanding of human reasoning, human-computer interactions, and human-human interactions.
---
Community management is a huge part of online games and there's a good reason that ban's and reports exist, some people will behave, others won't. human nature really.
---
Nuke warning is only two seconds and the nuke always lands directly on your camp, regardless of which target the nuke launcher actually  chose. 
---
I would logically presume that's the "utility" that they were mentioning. What else would it mean? 
---
Lol...now if we could actually play pool and earn caps I might like it more! :)
---
“Everything. Make sure you buy items from the Atom Shop!” -Love, Todd
---
They're totally worth crafting. Uses blood packs and antiseptic. With chemist perk you get double. Even if you dont use em, they sell for lots
---
Lol....
---
The question becomes what was your purpose and pointing it out.
---
I’m thinking even Bethesda doesn’t know how it’s going to go until they shut the servers down. Hence why they gave themselves a “several hours” time frame. They’re going to dig in there and see what all can be undone. Doubtful anything will be “unlearned” but I wouldn’t be surprised to hear about all the actual duped serums are gone. We just have to wait until the nuke cloud clears and see.
---
Except if you buy a stolen laptop and it's reported stolen, the cops can take the laptop away from you. Sure, you can sue the guy who stole it for your money back, but that isn't up to the cops to enforce. Anyone who bought a TSE during the extreme duping era knew should have known what could potentially happen. They were buying illegally obtained goods
---
How about no...
---
I do notice is that the power of my build vs monsters seems to fluctuate from time to time (perhaps bug or just rng), but it seems to me that the trend I am suggesting holds at those times as well
---
Unfortunately your right, PvE should replace the current one perhaps.
---
That would be cool 
---
Ofc
---
That's what she said?
---
I can post a picture of the spot if you are still interested? 
---
yeah I have had to take them all out in my camp house to see which was which....
---
everybody post nonsense to this sub constantly, using that logic there would only be like 10 posts here.
---
They deleted everything from everyone and are now trying to roll it back.
---
I don't see it. Maybe I am playing wrong but any time I go up against tough content I am out of ammo, and I go back to my base, make more and run out of supplies. End up running around with a .38 pipe rifle gathering supplies, even as my house sits on a lead node.
---
I guess I don't melee enough.
---
An easy google, but I don't mind giving ya the cliff's notes!  Duping is when someone exploits a game to duplicate an item - usually those "dupes" are of unique or rare items that are exceedingly rare and difficult to obtain.  Obviously this causes a lot of problems, and salts the earth for many players who's enjoyment is amassing power on their own steam rather than through glitching out the game.  Typically Duping is very rare in 2019 as most online games are pretty good about avoiding the mistakes Bethesda has made in this regard.  
---
There is a lot on the forums right now about duping because Bethesda has just made a post describing only vaguely what is being removed as a fix for the dupes.  This has caused a lot of justified ire from players who trade items, especially since it's taken Bethesda an extremely long time to fix this situation considering the impact it's had on the game and it's economy.  You're going to see polarized conversations about it, mostly due to shitposting by idiots on both sides who are venting their emotions via reddit.
---
Godspeed.
---
Nice! 
---
They bein fair! PVP/PVE same time no favorites here
---
It's all good.
---
LOL.....I only used 'crutch' because that's what everyone said that my quad explosive Radium was when I bitched about the nerf.
---
I hope that Bethesda is capable of balancing the Queen. I've joined some sessions where the fight has gone down to the wire so take away the dupes and she is probably going to be slightly OP. I also wasted 30 caps fast traveling to a SBQ fight the other day that was over in 3 minutes, obviously a squad of duped weapons is a little OP. I think their task of balance will be easier once they reduce the massive variance between  weapons of common players vs squads of dupers.
---
The deeper I delve into this update the more it pays off for dupers and the more it screws the rest of us. It was a poor choice to do this.
---
I'll take 2 for 100% legit not take over the world wearing a enclave hat reasons
---
I never complained about being downvoted.
---
You’re allowed to disagree with me. 
---
I don’t think there’s any shill posters for this game. 
---
So you’re telling me that you would much rather have nerfs and not balance and atom shop items on top of “fixes”. 
---
Enjoy your coolaid. 
---
*You kids today! Back in my day, we had 400 stash limit and we knew how to stay within the limit!*
---
I have no idea how they’ll tell. Probably by tracking items that came from known duper’s. 
---
I think they broke it and are trying to fix it
---
I really sure if u have filed stuff and u modified they can't detect it 
---
Yeah, hopefully they'll have the sense to just block the really obvious trolls. Frankly I wish they'd do the same on their Twitter account. 
---
You guys are some of the reasons my camp would no longer spawn and I had to move it. lol That really is the perfect place - isolated, access to water, acid node, free beef, and very rare random spawns of mobs.  
---
But seriously I had a mad notion and just parked it right next to Watoga Station, scorchbeasts be damned.
---
20 bulk on a standard stuff.
---
As much as I can get for ammo materials and screws.
---
To point out that your post makes no sense. The only people complaining are people like you. Your post is not needed.
---
I usually try not to be
---
Guess that ain't for everybody
---
I suppose, IDK I'm not a Dev lol. Just hope they hear me, I wanna take more pictures!!
---
When mommy and daddy love each other a lot- 
---
Gear and build has nothing to do with it.
---
When I farm I find a server with lots of legendary spawns, then force the respawns with a second account rather than server swap. It doesn't matter if I enter West Tek unarmed in a dress or in PA with a gatling laser, the number of legendaries in there will be the same over and over again on that server. I can even swap characters (again by holding the server open with another account) and no matter if it's my level 50 stealth sniper or my level 300 PA Tank, the spawn remains the same. 
---
If you do server swap between each clear then you get wildly different spawns. You can get 0 to 4 legendary mobs at West Tek for instance, same at Harper's Ferry. 
---
When non-legendary mobs are dropping legendary items regularly it tends to be because the area was previously a nuked zone. In Whitespring for example where every spawn has been a glowing one the spawn seems to retain a glowing one level chance of dropping a legendary no matter what mob is currently spawning (this is true if it's eyebots/protectrons/ghouls which can all spawn after nukes).
---
For the OP's theory to be correct it would mean that every mob has to constantly monitor the gear and build of every player than comes into contact with them. When you consider that half the time the mobs barely seem to register they are being hit at all, then you realise how unlikely this is.
---
60 initial for PC then talked into another 60 to play on PS with people that quit a week into the game.  Still playing occasionally on PC.  Not a power player, still level 29 wandering an hour or two here and there.  I'll eventually get my money's worth from it.
---
Haters are always gonna hate 
---
Upvoting bc im sick of the whining 
---
Besides how many duper’s and duped can it be ?
---
The ammo i'm carrying... 
---
You see, i'm stuck in a loop currently, my stash is filled up with junk, most of it it's valuable junk. It turns out that people die in whitesprins when someone nuked the area and sometimes they forget their bags behind. I may have picked up some of that junk and well, i can't really leave whitesprings now, i can only walk. 
---
Then because i'm greedy i can't stop farming the area so i slowly crawl around whitesprings, kill ghouls, pick up everything, and well, my situation only gets worse. Selling 200caps worth of caps per day isn't enough to get me on a manageable weight... Now because i don't want to lose the junk i keep it in my stash but i was kinda forced to take out all of my ammo so now i'm carrying a few thousand 308, .50, and .45... 
---
So yeah, when the patch finally shows up i'll be able to leave whitesprings and i might visit west tek for more loot...
---
While listening to "Rawhide" on a loop.
---
Oop... your baseless insult was removed.
---
I have a different theory which matches my observation: if you record/stream your legendary runs on Youtube/Twitch, you get better loot ;)
---
In a more serious manner, you'd have to kill thousands of legendaries in multiple modes and separate characters, in or outside groups to build up a dataset worthy of randomness analysis imo. Unfortunately, I play in an ALT+TAB unfriendly way half the time so I'm not currently in a position to start recording my loot drops. Maybe if they fix the windowed mode FPS drop, I'll try.
---
Think you can make tea out of them
---
They mentioned “several hours” downtime which to me means it’ll be longer than usual. Until they see how their purge goes. I’m guessing they don’t even know completely how it’ll go until shutdown, hence the vague downtime mentioned.
---
They overworked the poor mice running in the wheels that power their servers and needed to go out and get new ones?
---
For a week… then posts every other day… “They need to increase the stash limit! Screw BGS, they never listen to us. 800 is not enough!!1”
---
New.
---
Weekly challenge is pick flowers. 
---
Damn. 
---
I think at this point this is like the waiter fucking your order up 5 times and honestly not understanding how or why you’re upset. 
---
My concern is the fact that some folks who were not duping may have traded their legitimately earned items for duped items. And now they are SOL, while the duping parties have obtained good legit items. You essentially just shifted the power structure of the in game world and rewarded the people who you have been cracking down on. Congrats.
---
Could be anything.  They resell weapons they buy from players.  My buddy is stressed because he actually bought his TSE Handmade from Vendor Bot Phoenix.  I'm guessing it'll be gone tonight.
---
Is the Strimpak recipe only available for purchase or can it be found organically?
---
They couldn’t in the last game either. 
---
I am always leaving bags of ammo behind like breadcrumbs to show where I have been.
---
I want lights that just change colors every couple seconds. Not ones I have to change myself, or ones I have to individually wire. Honestly they don’t even have to change colors, static multicolored lights would be the dream.
---
Nope. Get children’s toys themed PA and love oriented metal armor skins. RIP.
---
Hey u/FritoZanzibar,
---
No problem at all buddy! I agree, wish the world were more open to rational debate more often my guy.
---
The only legendary items at vendors are ones sold to them by players. So if you bought a heavily duped item from a vendor it is probably subject to the purge.
---
I haven't either and must have run it 100+ times....are you certain they drop or are a reward in there??
---
So you created a *copy* of the ingame turret. Isn't that (\*gasp\* 😱) *duping*?
---
About 100, or like 2-3 bulked
---
More flux that I can't stand to lose if I die and then get disconnected
---
I'm waiting for an enterprising super mutant NPC who offers to launder duped items for a fee.
---
From what I understand, there's an issue which I think is being fixed here which causes players with rad-worms (which is a very common affliction) to alert nearby enemies for some reason. Is it possible that that's what you're dealing with? 
---
Really...? Don't be that guy.
---
They are used in a few recipes for teas.
---
It's kinda like dabbing but with different arm movements. All the celebrities are doing it on youtube now.
---
Bet that needed some killer support any pics before?
---
I thought I was tripping. Been playing stealth only for 200hrs+ and I can defo notice when something's changed. Sneak dmg not activating, sometimes enemies spot me across the map while I'm sneaking and not doing anything and start shooting at me. Maybe they tried to buff the enemy stealth detection since it's a joke in 76 compared to fo4 but they messed up? Wouldn't surprise me.
---
Wait....they nerfed stealth again?! 
---
Just kidding 😁
---
Reddit posts about fallout 76 are like going to a superbowl party.  A couple people actually care about the game, but mostly people are there to get drunk and and yell at professionals about how they could do their job better.  
---
I do this too, but I tag it FIRST.
---
I have done this too many times, and they come over and insta-one-shot it and I get no loot off it.
---
I'm not referring to spawn rate, rather legendary drop rate from kills, legendary and non-legendary (apologies if that was unclear)
---
1,000 units of both iron and lead ore, baby! WHOOO!
---
Depends on your play style. I'm PA exclusively, so I don't need much ballistic fiber. I'm also in the process of building and scrapping several styles of weapons for mods so screws and springs don't last long. I craft ammo when inventory gets tight and use a lot of automatics to burn through that. Maybe 150-250 wood for cooking/boiling water. Other stuff? Cork...silver...etc. 50-100. When I haven't drained the vendors with legendary drops. 
---
Typical responder
---
Well...
---
Thx. Been playing RDR2 for months waiting for bugs to be worked out on F76. I thought I missed out on something. Now Ive got a free morning to play and Bethesda decides to take it offline for maintenance. 
---
Smart! Now if the Vendor Caps would increase I would be willing to invest heavily in your business 
---
Think it’s both... ESO worked like that, links to PSN and an e-mail for the ESO account, but hopefully I’m wrong for OP’s sake..! 👍🏻
---
I just love warframe, the game is grindy, but you so fun missions to grind, sometimes i just repeat those missions without having anything extra to grind, the gameplay is awesome.
---
Steve, the dude from Digital extremes, is the dude that made all the original Unreal tournament weapons, and he does weapons in warframe, warframe has a ton of weapons and all of them has some different gimmick, its just awesome if you like to play to unlock things. That being said, i like farming grinding games, i love diablo 2. 
---
You dont need to spend money in warframe, tho it does have some f2p blocking elements, but you can trade with players and get the premium currency easily. Id try it since its free, tho the learning curve is giant, it will take you like 200 hours+ to start really understanding the game. But you can have a taste of the game on start to see if its for you before investing. 
---
You need to craft the weapons and warframes(which are suits like javelins) in your foundry, there are a ton of warframes, each have 4 habilities, and the DEVs seem really passionate about the game and each warframe has a totally different feel. 
---
There's also a little aluminum deposit directly between that spot and  Top of the World station, along the riverbank.
---
That was my main camp for a long time.  I eventually had to move because it was only loading in about half the time.  Now I've got a spot on a ridge overlooking Monongah.
---
Unless you find god rolls in a vendor youre safe.
---
Such an unfair burden to put on people; expecting them to take the obvious and necessary steps to be minimally informed as to the topics they're discussing before sharing their outrage with respect to it. For shame.

A bunch of shit I don’t need. Just typical hoarding prodocol

My end game pending content additions:
---
1. Farm mats for ammo. Sitting on 48k rounds of 5.56, will likely have 55k next week. I should stop.
---
2. Events. Quite a few bug out though, but I'm still doing them.
---
3. SBQ. 
---
4. Farm for plans.
---
5. Finding new or interesting places to use photomode. 
---
That's funny. Have a happy Valentine's Day bro.
---
Add 46 to that number, sonny. Maybe it not for grandads either. 
---
For exactly one person. 
---
Np.  In the end it's a good thing, but it was handled really poorly from my perspective and it's causing a lot of discord on the message boards between those who think every player who's traded has duped, those who duped a bunch of shit and are mad, and the people caught in the middle.
---
If all you need to enjoy a game is to shoot super mutants in the face, more power to you. I enjoy games with a good story, fun and rewarding gameplay, an economy system that makes sense and good enemy AI, so this games not quite for me. But hope you continue to enjoy it :)

Stop writing paragraphs about how your low level and have sucky weapons play the actual game n get better

&gt; we are still compiling our full patch notes to provide to you once that update is available, but in our tradition, we wanted to share with you some of the larger fixes we’re working on.

Jacob Bekenstein and and Hans-Joachim Bremermann would like to have a word with your friend.

Data mining says yes, but Bethesda coding says maybe, we won't tell you anything in case it's broken. Then you could call us out on it.

---
Err I don’t think that’s getting addressed here they are more then likely having to update the servers with whatever way is deleting duped items and it’s probably a large one at that
---
I have a 3* TSE shotgun I bought from a player on my friend list.  It's been sitting in my stash since the TSE nerf.
---
I've already moved into the next Meta for the game.  If my TSE shotgun is gone when I get home It won't even faze me as I haven't been using it or the perk cards to make it shine since the nerf.
---
Losing stuff like this maybe harder on other players if they're still relying on these weapons as their main arsenal.
---
Those that saw this coming a mile away have already adjusted to the new Meta and are waiting to see what they get to keep from the aftermath of today's update.
---
Well shit happens gens will bitch at each other for the dumb stuff and fuck id never do the tide pod garbage thats dumb 
---
I uninstalled a while back. I'm not going to reinstall till modding support and modded servers become a thing.
---
Is the timeline for that still at the end of this year?
---
shaka, when the walls fell.
---
This is where you gotta learn to buy and sell!
---
I usually buy out all the booze and bloodpacks from my vendors. You get 25% of the caps back for every item you buy so you can sell more.
---
Neat little tip. With the party boy/girl perk, if you drink Whiskey you can get 6 strength! Thats 30 carry weight which comes in handy if you need to fast travel. Another one is Vodka that gives you 75 extra hp, amazing for pvp. 
---
Log in and count how much cloth you have in your stash.  Multiply it by the weight and report back here!
---
Personally I prefer shooting ~~Underminers~~ Mole Miners ij the face but whatever floats your boat
---
Whu you need flux and fusion cores for  VATS rifleman build ?
---
What kind of printer do you have (I am considering buying one), what size is that (cos I want to know how big a one I should buy - bigger obviously looks better to me at this time), is it a multi-part print (because I have no idea what I am looking at for the files :P)?
---
I am strangely excited to see what items have been removed.  It will be interesting. 
---
And for how many patches has Bethesda fucked something up? One. And even though it fucked a lot of things up it was all caused by the same error and fixed asap. 
---
Just because people didn't like other patches because they changed too little or things they didn't want changed doesn't mean Bethesda fucked them up. 
---
Bethesda's patches have been overwhelmingly a net gain for the game yet people try to treat each one as the next in a series of disasters. 
---
I wonder how they are finding duped items
---
Should.  That's the key word here.  Should.
---
But we *should* be able to expect they could put out a patch without screwing up version merges and *rolling back* versions.  We *should* have been able to expect a lot of things.

They're mildly poisonous though. They are very poisonous if honeybees make honey from them and you eat it.

Didn't they say the sever fixes were next week?
---
The cycling lights aren’t too bad. They have color and dimming options and it’s worth it to individually set each one once you know what color/intensity is best. I like setting all my lights to random for while. I get to see each light with different color/light mixing... and it’s by seeing the lights “in action” which leads me to set the final color/intensity. 
---
hmm, works for me.
---
From my observations, if you don't bother placing turrets at your CAMP, mobs seem to be more inclined to ignore it.  It could be my imagination, though, and probably not at all true.  So far all I have had to deal with was an unruly mob of wandering radrats, though.
---
Items based upon rarity are going to be even more rare post this. I mean I have NEVER even seen a two shot legendary drop ever and I am over 100+ hours in. I think it is going to come back to what you really want to do grind caps for a impossible priced weapons from a player or take your chances with the loot system and farm. I personally made a suggestion to Bethesda via feedback that items should have low and hard caps in the trading menu. I mean this system has been in many many games that the trade menu has to have balance in order for the trade to complete. I don't think I really have to explain this in depth but I will give a very basic example of what I mean. I want say bulk acid 20 of them the game has it set so that there is a min amount you can pay and max for this item so that when the player that has them offers them to me I could only pay so many caps over the base price or under it. Then you can get into talking about a trade for a trade of equal valued items. I think for instance if two players had two shot legendary rifles of different designs and they did a even swap because one wanted the other and vice versa that would be a fair locked in trade. I just don't want to see the in game economy end up where one person thought it was acceptable to trade 95 .45 round for 4-5 Fusion Cores lmao.
---
I followed a level 37 around Harpers Ferry the other day, killing the level 48-68 Super Mutants he was pissing off (several Legendary ones), I think they finally realized what was happening after about 10 kills, and gave me the Heart emote, felt good.
---
I would assume and hope for the former. It seems like the more sensible approach. 
---
Exactly.  Its a PvE game to start with and there's never been much reason to trade with anyone.
---
This, man. It's a morbid curiousity. I know two of my weapons will go because I see them traded all the time. But I have no idea what else.
---
Any known plans or recipes I have,  always get dropped in flatwoods, plus any ammo type I don't use.
---
Sometimes it's hard to get the attention of a new player to give them stuff. 
---
Is it plans or linings that drop? I'll be running again on 9 alts from 35-50 (2 accounts, trading chars), so I can certainly keep an eye.
---
&gt;	Additionally, during downtime, we’re going to roll out a server-side fix to reduce the frequency that players might experience disconnects from game servers.
---
Sure they could.  I did it all the time through scoped rifles in FO4.
---
Did I get it mixed up? I probably got it mixed up. Oh poo. I guess I'm waiting another week.
---
I don't understand why I even like these guys. I like to see the best in people. I like to think they have the best intentions. But it's all corporate BS. I want to believe they are honest good people but everything just says gaming is a cash grab industry for the corporations. And I'm fracking sick of it. All game developers need to get out of it and do crowd sourced funding for their games. Don't sell yourself to these soulless corporations. Do something great together with like minded individuals. Forget the big IPs. Make new ones. make better ones. Where you are not restricted by their deadlines and unfair treatment and pressures.
---
&gt; any update on the energy weapon durability issue? I
---
this post couldn't scream more "we don't bother with this game anymore" and "fuck the patience you showed us" unless they'd write that down in caps at the end.  
---
it's now less insulting and more utterly hillarious that once again the only thing bethesda has to say is "yeah, we're doing stuff! we can't tell you about it though, tune in next month we promise to tell!!!" like, job well done on trying to keep people playing the game, guys.  
---
i know this game is always going to have a group of diehard fans that will not allow anyone to say a bad thing no matter what stunt bethesda pulls, but for the rest of us, i think it's really disappointing that bethesda continues to prove they will never be able to utilise this game's potential. shame, really.
---
There's no 100% reliable way to tell a real item from a duped one. 
---
Good luck trading after this mass delete.
---
**NEW Updated Bethesda Dupe Safety Guidelines:**
---
1. Never trade a legendary with another player!  If it's a dupe, we'll delete it.
---
2. Never buy a legendary you see in a vendor bot!  If it's a dupe, we'll delete it.
---
3. Never pick up a legendary out of a bag!  If it's a dupe, we'll delete it.
---
Way to remove content Bethesda!   You removed the ability to trade!
---
And they're going to add Player Vending later.......roflmao what a joke.
---
I paid them 80+ and just want to eat my meal in peace; but they keep showing up and spilling hot coffee on my nana.
---
Someone had a good idea that they already implemented the way to detect duped items the last patch because it rolled back a lot of the glitches they fixed and now they are just implementing the the deleting feature 
---
I’d love to recycle plastic from my spent shotgun shells as well

So when will ps4 servers be back up so I can actually play? I dont interact with people outside of my normal group so I'm not worried about losing anything. Just wanna play on my day off.

Yesss!
---
My favorite episode of anything ever.
---
with level 3 hard bargain and selling to every vendor in the game I am still missing out on about 1200-1600 caps a day via stuff I don't want or need around.
---
You cant actually have decent balance without ruining all the perks and negating all legendary gear. Unless you want 1% damage difference from weapon to weapon. How can there be real balance with lvl5 and lvl50 pipe guns or any weapon really? Should the both be the same? Ya pp is who farm up 3* gear will always be at an advantage. Play around with different perk and gear loadouts and you'll find  it's not to bad fighting players on your lvl 
---
so very true. i do the same and have only attracted a few other players. the ones that did come and tag it threw a thumbs up and hopefully will do the same.
---
I chuckled. 
---
the launcher says: NO -,-
---
Well if someone sold a TSE to phoenix, i cam argue that this guy didn't know about the rarity of the weapon
---
Plan. I don't think any linings come in mod format. After 500 hours I'd hope I'd have seen at least one if they did.
---
Hard to say how that would happen.  I hope he's alright, but I sort anticipate those weapons being completely wiped, legit or not.  
---
xbox says yes as well
---
The real problem here is that let's say a Griefer wants to cause someone problems.  He goes to your camp, attacks everything down to 1% health.  He's still fine.  Now, he just walks a little bit away, hides, and waits.  Someone comes along and accidentally damages something, destroying it.  That someone now gets marked as Wanted, and said Griefer pops up and kills them, collects the bounty, and waits for the next.
---
Now, of course, if you are set to Pacifist, your attacks do no damage to the camp objects (supposedly), but anyone else is still going to become fair game.  The griefer may even have teammates/conspirators who will attack and then run to the camp to try to goad people into attacking back, knowing any misses will flag them as wanted, then it's two-on-one.
---
The Bethesda devs need to start asking about their fixes "How could someone exploit this to cause grief to others?"
---
I just logged in on Xbox

Todd Howard says “16 times the detail “

VATS while in Power Armor eats fusion cores.

I think cause people use the ‘come here’ emote for so many different things it’s hard to know what they want. A lot of people, from what I’ve seen, just spam the emote even when there’s nothing there/they don’t lead you anywhere so it’s awkward knowing what people are trying to do 
---
Now THAT!.. is what im talking about. These are the kind of notes we needed. Thank you.

Well... it appears that I’m back online at 6:40pm GMT and it looks like I ain’t lost any weapons.   So far so good

(sorry, am ammo-short and a bit obsessed :P)

Sell me your dog food.

Zero items lost
---
Ps4 logged in, immediately crashed. Trying again now.
---
A link to that article would be super helpful. Super Duper, even.
---
I don’t know what moron downvoted you, but to be precise, backpacks have been mentioned by the devs a being an end-game chase reward in the upcoming vaults. They’ll be a visual prestige reward item to set you apart from other players.
---
The fact that no one in this thread knows this, and that they down-voted you tells me none of them have been paying attention, or they’re new players.
---
The fact that Beth is using them as prestige items for end game vaults probably means they’ll never end up in the atom store.
---
Came here to say this, thanks homie.
---
Nothing removed. TSEs still there and functional
---
I'll be able to play the game for a few more hours at a time before transferring looted weapons+armor to a mule.
---
Wow, I'm honestly surprised by this turn of events.
---
Doctors hate him, you won't believe this one neat trick to improve your love life
---
Sorry about that it wouldn't let me copy the link 
---
Well shit at lease heavy weapon buff could be in this new patch.
---
There's no 100% reliable way for players to tell a real item from a duped one.
---
Ahh so there is hope. I just get explosive vents x100000
---
Noice 
---
If you’ve done the BoS quests, the top floor of Fort Defiance has a bunch of plastic plates, and pool balls
---
What, you don't like hearing about how when we were kids Fallout was a pixelated isometric RPG?  
---
#2 doesn’t make sense. Lots of people sell their extra drills and stalkers walking canes to robots. What they should do is let the robot vendors detect and refuse to accept a duped item that’s all. 
---
Beths. already stated there will be an increase to 800 in the next patch. 
---
Nobody said it would get rid of them entirely. You said you didn’t think it would even be addressed, I was merely providing where they said they are addressing it. 
---
So basically, useless. Oh well.
---
If duping is truly eliminated and duped items are removed from the game entirely, I seriously doubt anyone will sell them for any price, good or otherwise. 
---
Believe it or not, I've actually gotten two shot weapons and one TSE weapons completely legit by killing legendary enemies. I would never even consider selling them. Why would anyone? 
---
What platform you on? Let the grief games begin 
---
There's no point speculating how they might do it as there's any number of possibilities depending on how the game was coded. 
---
There could just be a unique identifier for each item and it's just taken them til now to write code to audit every item on all characters, then remove the duplicates.
---
This or any other number of methods. Probably the reason it took them so long is that they had to make sure it worked correctly or they'd kill of their game.
---
People aren't complaining about a dupe fix, they're skeptical that Bethesda can actually fix it without creating more problems. This skepticism is compounded when you consider that Bethesda claimed to be unable to view or track individual items. 
---
Wow, check out how even my tan is now!
---
Ok I have a job 
---
I have a wife
---
I have friends 
---
I don’t exploit 
---
I love exploring. 
---
your comment sounds condescending 
---
It’s easy to go to a bunch of mole miners and super muties and sell there weapons for a good profit. 
---
A run of the golf course and the golf outfits ( not too far from black water mine = mole miners &amp; that super mutie camp nearby ) is enough to garner 1k caps 
---
It doesn’t take long even for a person who sucks at combat like me. 
---
Then I go explore. And enjoy.  
---
I have noticed things new things being wrong after every patch. Last patch they added a fusion core bug so you can stand still and watch your fusion cores drain. The patch before that they added a bug where if you add a door to your camp it would dupe your camp. Those are just two patches. 
---
As far as the game goes Yeah they are getting better but it has definitely been two steps forward one step back every time. 
---
Just wait later today anyone with a gun with the duped template will be deleted duped or not. I guess after they nerfed the TSE who cares. 
---
Put em in the ice chest outside the clubhouse at Whitesprings
---
Aluminium, Water, Acid, Copper, Beef. Good job nobody is talking about it, will never get it loaded in. 
---
 For the curious, its here -

It's a good one. I was almost rolling on the floor ;)

I think we can all agree your condescension is incredibly douchie.
---
So players who have duped items got to keep them as long as they didnt have multiples. Sentinel/Assassin lives
---
They said they killed the duped items, but left a single one if there were stacks.
---
YAY!
---
Yeah idk, a lot of the shotguns i got werent from big traders and just people i found in game who were using them. The only tse ive had is a lvl 40 combat shotty from uranium fever
---
I thought it would have an update
---
So torn.
---
I’m one of the world’s biggest ST fans, but fucking despise that episode. I’m convinced it’s ironically popular.
---
Thanks I'll give it a shot.
---
Is path of exile very similar to diablo? How's it work as a squad multiplayer?
---
&gt; Finally, during our investigation leading up to these actions, we determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined across all three platforms needed to have duped items removed. This means the vast majority of players did not possess multiple copies of these duped items, and have had zero items removed from their characters today.
---
I hate this game and the piss poor level of effort it represents. I hate that the developers lied and that they squandered this opportunity.  
---
BUT!  
---
But I don't hate the people who like this game. If you are having fun, GREAT! I'm glad you're having fun. I'm not angry with you, I don't resent you, and I'm not going to hold your fondness for this game against you.   
---
I'm annoyed with Bethesda, not you. And for you I hope they manage to fix this game and keep the servers up and running so you can keep playing.   
---
Have full ya'll. 
---
Well hopefully it finally improves server stability. Let me know people able to play right now. 
---
I support the removal of duped items
---
However, I sent a ticket to support asking for help when I bought a serum from the Whitesprings vendor and it glitched/failed/broke and I did not get the mutation, but worse it cancelled my other mutation. I asked for help, but they could not refund the caps cost or reinstate the mutations ... but they can do this! \*facepalm\*
---
Was I lied to?  
---
I was surprised by that too
---
Seriously that’s it? 
---
I haven't, I'm not even sure how to start the BoS quests.
---
I prob wont return to adventure mode, but ya it should change a bit to stop griefers n make em come to survival
---
They just removed stacks. So literally useless patch.
---
I agree but for a different reason as a new player coming in I have got very frustrated really quickly with certain things forgive me for not knowing the proper names of all the legendary gear but I will explain my grievance. I heard via helpful people here that things like Sentinel armor was duped. I then was told this in combination with other legendary gear can basically make you invincible in PVP. I am not saying he duped or had duped items but the introduction/injection of even hundreds of items that were never meant to exist into the game has allowed people to use said items not to destroy the economy but to grief other players. I mean when you have a level 275 following you that can one shot you no matter what you do and their health bar won't move doesn't make the game very fun.
---
Wow you really put alot of thought into that. Sounds like reasonable conclusions. Although above my pay grade i dont even know how these items was duped to begin with or any of the process it includes. Any thought of coding gives me a headache lol. It will be interesting seeing it all unfold. This will mean earlier duped items will still be floating around? Do you think people will be able to find new ways to dupe items or will we be pretty safe after this last cap on our carry weight?
---
Flat-earth-theory fact dismissal FTW!
---
Wow I was expecting something really really bad but they for once did something alright on both ends.
---
They said that even accts with stacks of duped items...they left one :).
---
I don’t think it’s useless. People with a single TSE probably won’t want to sell it. This balances the economy so they can roll out player vending (hopefully soon)
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019
---
TL;DR, they only removed things that were in stacks beyond a reasonable amount, etc. Not individual items. 
---
My toons survived intact.  This pleases me.
---
for you? free
---
I've eaten rice almost every day of my life but I wouldn't call it 'good'. It's just kind of okay. 
---
Sometimes you just need a time-waster, and FO76 fits that bill pretty well. Especially if you've paid $60 for it already and can't afford to get another, better time-waster. Doesn't mean people can't criticize it even if they're still playing it. 
---
Oh, the servers are back up? Any new content? 
---
Well, removing stacks is not literally useless.
---
Right?! God damn, that was a really good move.
---
Thank you Bethesda, for not fucking this up :).
---
Im sorry that people forcibly digging your head out of the sand you've buried in it upsets you. We bought and played and own the game and we obviously feel aggrieved that it is and was so damn disappointing. I don't care if you don't want to hear it. This is a sub for fallout 76 and i will say what i have to say about fallout 76. 
---
You were right on, server patches are this week and client side patch next week.
---
Something not quite right about that number you know 
---
I believe it's a possible drop. I remember the plan being cheap, but that was updates ago
---
I'm really happy to see the increase in stash space. While it isnt still a complete fix for the issue of stash and hording and what a lot of us collectors want (in coordination with display shelves and racks and decor items for CAMPs), it is still really good to see a little balm on this front for the short term.  
---
Looking forward to more details about the PvE Wild Appalachia content. I hope it is more than just run and gun challenges of the week type of stuff. I'd like to see actual meaty quest driven stuff and npcs and faction content roll out.
---
Yes. Fucking yes. All the yes. 
---
And people were panicking like it was going to be the end of the world.. again.
---
I win. 
---
Good luck with everything 
---
They left 1 item of a duped stack for people. :)
---
I'm betting they didn't target TSE's specifically.  They may have been after the stacked items instead.
---
All ranged weapons will Have their damage fixed but will now be based on Star Wars Stormtroopers weapons and will miss everything they are fired at.
---
TL;DR, they only removed things that were in stacks beyond a reasonable amount, etc. Not individual items.
---
So? That's just if they have multiples of an item. Every single player in the game could have duped items still as long as they weren't stacked. Practically nothing changed.
---
Well, yeah, we all do. No one keeps all the ammo they find. You spec out to one weapon type, and end game you use a few ammo types that don't drop often. So you end up dropping everything you don't use because space is a factor. I have left Mininukes by the stash box in Whitespring. Mininukes, fusion cells, plama whatevers, missles, grenade launcher rounds. Anything I cant sell to the vendor.
---
Ha no just took them down to supposedly wipe out the dupes. New stuff later this month it sounds like.
---
sorry to burst your bubble most people remain unscathed. they only deleted duplicates per account.
---
oh! Thanks. This sounds fair.
---
I guess the pro to not trading with players is that I feel pretty safe w/ my gear not disappearing post-purge. I may have shitty items, but at least I won’t be naked upon login. 
---
Thanks! Will check this out.
---
Last I saw it was ~800-900 in the Enclave Bunker
---
I mean, to be fair, they *did* say that all duped items were getting binned.
---
Sure. Where?
---
I seem to be hurting for plastic all the time for some reason 
---
I agree. A lot of people would have quit outright. This way, it’s fair-ish and keeps people from leaving. 
---
Yeah, I really like that. 
---
Update: out of all the ghouls at the golf club, I found one that was "active".
---
Same. Been holding onto an instigating Tesla rifle. And rebuilding ammo inventory after the assaultron head wiped me. 
---
these are the type of threads i like seeing on this sub
---
Nothing specific has been announced. Just mentioned new quests, items, etc.
---
Well, the gun in question was bought off of someone else, not the person I mentioned above. When I got it, it was in a stack of 19 which I guess is the tell tale sign of a weapon being duped. 
---
The others are said to be good as I asked the person mentioned above if there were any dupes and they said they should all be good.
---
I might be out after this patch. While I appreciate the willingness to remove duped items. I have a distinct impression my guns will be gone. None were duped, buddy gave me his dropped TSE since he was a melee build. 
---
Since , I have found a few good weapons, that I paid forward to other players. 
---
Now I will probably logon to no weapons, fine by me but I won’t re-grind an already extensively grindy game. 
---
In the end, the problem was Bethesda for not patching this faster or even better have a propre beta before releasing an unfinished game. 
---
Downvote to hell don’t really care 
---
Only 1 percent of people did not have duped items
---
An apology?
---
What a pleasant surprise
---
It's good that some people can admit their errors and not throw a tantrum about it
---
Yeah people seem to think this item destruction (which I support) is the same thing as fixing duping.  It's not.  I have no doubt there are any number of other ways for folks to keep duping items.  This move -- if it works as intended -- will definitely punish dupers.  But it's like mowing the grass, the duping will still grow back up.
---
No more million carry weight characters tanking servers, all the work that the dupers did do to get those massive stock piles is wasted, plus they have the ability to now run scheduled scans (which so far seem to have worked without too many issues) to clean out dupe stockpiles.
---
This one scan didn't end duping, but doing a scan every 3/4 days and wiping stock pile accounts? That will kill duping in a heart beat.
---
Only level 26? Give it time. 
---
I do this also. But don't kill them....just drain their health so the other players can get that XP.
---
Couldn't agree more :)
---
absolutely. that ties into my 3rd bullet point. but as you're pointing out, even now, before the introduction of free PVP, people are already abusing it in existing PVP. I cant speak on your specific situation or the person you faced, but this definitely happens to regular players. its been documented on here in the past.
---
now, just because someone has OP weapons and armor, doesn't make them a duper, and it doesn't make their items illicit.
---
however, i think once the servers go up, we will see a shift in what we see people running around with, for sure.
---
Yep! I logged off.
---
Same! 
---
Cool. We trade before? If not psn: t33gs-oosah
---
I'll be on tonight or any old time.
---
Maybe re-craft the excavator power armor (got rid of my old one to to save some space)
---
Keep more aid items I usually throw away.
---
Maybe some ammo that I usually get rid off.
---
Some extra outfits. I don't really store many every weight matters even if it's just 0.10.
---
Junk, can never have enough junk.
---
And of course more flux.
---
I want to say some legendary weapons that I can sue for later but I'm not lucky enough to get a decent weapon.
---
Despite what people thought about him, Broomop was a pretty chill guy. Used to voice chat with him years ago while playing on a PSOBB private server.
---
800 is actually a good number for me. I like to collect any outfit or clothing I can. They weigh next to nothing. Its the junk I collect that will take up most of my stash. 
---
Did you have more than one of the same exact Legendary weapon?  If not then you weren't affected.  Most people weren't carrying around a bunch of the exact same weapon, hence the 1% figure...
---
To be fair they didn’t give a lot of details yesterday so it was easy to let your mind wander to worst-case scenarios. 
---
That said I don’t think they should have given details because it would have given the dupers time to move stuff around and dodge the purge. 
---
I threw it privately then tried to man up lol :P
---
Maybe they should give us the 40% of the map that is out of bounds.
---
Totally, eh. The eBay store accts, and playerauctions etc, those are likely the accts thar got hit hard.
---
I don't even have my headset plugged in after the other day. I started a new character to test out a 1-50 build and I was doing the daily where I had to claim a workshop and lakeside cabins. I was level 11 at the time. I claimed it for all of 2 minutes when a level 28 38 and 24 fast traveled just to 3V1 a level 11 and proceed to try and kill me over and over using the workshop to start the PVP.
---
Exactly. When I quit, we had 600 stash and I was still playing with 400 stash and had no problems.
---
Do you have a it tagged? I used to struggle for it but now I dump ~100 each day
---
I've had them be non-reactive before and I tossed a nade and they woke up. Try that. 
---
During the beta, the devs had players congregate at vault 76 and detonated a nuke nearby.  A lot of people recorded and uploaded to Youtube to show what happens when a nuke is dropped, but the vault is definitely a nuke-free zone now.
---
It always is after a patch.  They will scale server resources down after a good few hours.  
---
Lost nothing.
---
why is this getting downvoted already i have seen  several people saying the same thing
---
One of them I know for sure is. Bought off someone else, it was in a stack of 19 and I still have it.
---
Bonus!
---
This has happened to me and I have lost out to glitches and game crashes ... I am annoyed that they cannot restore my losses, but are doing this ... but I do agree to the steps they are taking now.
---
A wipe would be a fun thought, too!
---
settle the eff down now. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019)
---
Source?  I haven't heard this.
---
Oh OK, I dont know how to dupe and I only bought one of each gun I have :) 
---
I noticed that too. They must have removed a ton of over encumbered and duped item.  (Am on PS4)
---
Pretty merciful of them to not just outright ban accounts that were obviously dupers. I guess they didn't want the backlash. 
---
Maybe some people that were duping will learn their lesson but some will continue to try and exploit the game.
---
I'm not mad about it but I'm trying to figure out what it means that they didn't just axe some accounts completely, hell they could have even made money off the dupers that would have bought the game again, lol.
---
Thoughts?
---
Hahahaha, you think there's content coming soon.
---
That's so cute!
---
Did you have to get rid of your couch for those?
---
How does it change the landscape? The trend now is duped items being traded for duped items. The only things being traded 1:1 are top tier duped items already in circulation. Nobody is going to use caps, everybody is going to trade for the dupes still in circulation. 1% of the pkayerbase no longer having 500 of them changes nothing. The other millions still have the ones they got.
---
yes sir
---
Watch the little daisies grow!
---
Nope, if you walk up to them they show you the loot inventory like they are dead, except they're moving and clearly alive). Hit them, made them, nothing happens.
---
Very cool - thanks for sharing the file!
---
Smoke and mirrors.
---
Op didn't make a point til basically the end. D grade essay
---
not even close. people who had duped items before the patch still do now, after. so it's a tie at best, even though my math is still on point.
---
Totally agree that it released unfinished. 
---
I spec bloody melee so it never hurt me but my whole team quit and everyone I met through trading quit because end game was just too tedious and unrewarding. 
---
It’s sad when you can hit harder with a level 1 item than a full spec rifle. 
---
There’s the argument of fun for me. 
---
When you reduce the game to a grind it’s no longer fun. 
---
I’m all for balance at the cost of buffing and nerf things that need to be changed but we can’t have a trend of negative changes with no fixes or buffs to existing builds. 
---
Also I believe that two shot should been two shot and explosive should been 15% or just area effect
---
If base damage was better for guns I Don’t think anyone would be upset. 
---
Lol, if I was an adult during that I would’ve had a lot of fun,I loved learning abOut Y2K from my grandparents and hearing my family members stories, besides that though I was sorta talking about the nukes breaking at the beginning of the year.
---
Once the patch is finished I think I will be making a communal area out in the open as another person has stated they did.  I'm not looking to be selfish, but I do like to have a sanctum where I will know if somebody is around.
---
This wasn't a scan to remove all duped items. Creation engine doesn't allow that kind of accountability.
---
This was a proof of concept scan, which so far has worked without too many issues.
---
I'll quote myself from another part of this thread to better explain:
---
&gt; No more million carry weight characters tanking servers, all the work that the dupers went to to get those massive stock piles is wasted, plus they have the ability to now run scheduled scans (which so far seem to have worked without too many issues) to clean out dupe stockpiles.
---
&gt; This one scan didn't end duping, but doing a scan every 3/4 days and wiping stock pile accounts? That will kill duping in a heart beat.
---
Assuming they didn't break anything this time, then I'm cool with this.  I logged in and checked - it looks like all of my stuff is still there.
---
We can talk about whether the warning post was worded appropriately, but that's maybe water under the bridge at this point.  
---
So...tentative good job, Bethesda?  (Hopefully?)
---
I second that!
---
yea but not like this its super quick
---
Oh man, why didn't I think of that? They could just hire theoretical physicists to find a way!
---
Yup. PS4 and loads are prolly half the time.
---
No offense I can’t help but think stranger danger 
---
You get an upvote for paying it forward 
---
That’s server stability. If they don’t move, it doesn’t strain the server. 
---
Go tell that to algebra.
---
I just miss the sound of a super mutant finding my reverse pickpocketed land mine as it explodes... 'Uh-oh...blarr'BOOM!
---
Ahh, meat-rain.
---
Ditto. Also haven't written a lengthy manifesto about I despise other players complaining about things they don't like in a product they paid money for. 
---
They didn't lie about it affecting a small number of players.
---
I never said anything about your math, stop moving the goalposts you nitwit :)
---
TSE also break down very quickly too ... I carry a second non tse to counter this. Mine always always breaks at the worst moment ... but I enjoy the challenge, lolz
---
Dupers upset?
---
I'm on ps4 screen still loading can't join
---
If you still play, great, do something constructive. Simply crying about something being unfair does nothing to solve any problems you have/had with the game. If you quit already, then by all means good for you. Additional complaining about something no longer relevant to you though, to people who may still enjoy the have and hope it becomes better, just seems like you seeking external validation for your own choice. If you hate the game, then quit and go away. Those of us who like it think you all are like our children throwing a fit over something simply because you aren't getting your way. Anyways, have a nice day.
---
Lmao, true enough!
---
What about new ladder instead of the stairwell, or maybe an elevator
---
I just wanted add build budget and area, a significant add for both.
---
For sure, it was more of a comment on social media and the ability to "rage type" and over-react due to filter bubble biases (when you read what you want to read it only reinforces your point of view). 
---
"Just wait later today"
---
And the problem is none of you doomsaying mother fuckers can even wait the few hours to see if anything even goes wrong. 
---
And then just like with the "I traded with someone and they stole my whole inventory" bullshit even if you don't lose a thing as long as some random shit stirrer shows up and swears Bethesda deleted their entire inventory you're going to jump in supporting them. 
---
I think the point I am making (which is why I clarified not the literal you) is that is one thing to voice your opinion and criticize. it is another to affect the autonomy of others. 
---
it is a bigger picture idea that extends to far more than video games. Heck, religion and social issues. politics and beyond. We love to pull other people into our shit and have fellow soldiers to our cause. If people want to self select into that cause, fine. But when you start nagging others on the idea, picking fights and bringing people down that want to be left alone, that is a problem. 
---
Some of us just want to forget about a tough 8 hour day and shoot a super mutant in the face! 
---
ok good to hear it's not just on xbox
---
Nutritious and delicious, tastes just like chicken.
---
Yep. Watch for massive stacks to reappear in a week. 
---
I don't stash increase was planned for this maintenance. 
---
Bethesda has shown absolutely no inclination to learn from the mistakes of others.
---
So yeah, I would be completely unsurprised if they didn't have a delay, let alone secure a sever instance for their own private use.
---
never said the stash increase was today. pay attention.
---
Now they have a small list of people to watch for future duping.  
---
Not worried at all, excited actually. Hopefully they roll out some bans for the cheaters too.
---
Manage your expectations.  The teach you this in classes coming home from deployment and getting out of prison etc etc.  Don't expect big things, don't expect your family to throw you a surprise party when you get home.  The more you do this, the less you'll be let down and the more you'll be able to enjoy the good things you do have instead of what you "could" have had.  ;)
---
"Next week, we are raising the Stash limit from 600 to 800 pounds."

---
Less than 1%. It could have been 0.3% for all we know. But it makes sense to me. Less than 1% walk into a bank vault with no guard and take money. A much higher percentage accept money from that dude walking out of the vault.
---
Amen brah...
---
My problem is the fact that my friend bought a couple of tse from one guy, for a couple of hundred of caps. He ended up selling two of them to me, and now we're possibly going to be fucked over, because we have no idea if they duped them, or got them legitimately. 
---
Stash increase is next update 
---
This was not a patch.
---
The stash increase is on the patch next week.
---
Can no one read?
---
If only 1% of the entire playerbase wass effected, and the other 99% continues trading as they did before, then logically the economy stays exactly the same.
---
I use heavy metal torso splatter paint and arms splatter and pink and heavy combat legs with bos paint and other has vault tec paint. So all this together looks like I made armor (upper torso) and stole armor of bos and vaults

Almost every TSE is duped, if you didn’t find the tse and you bought it for a “deal” off someone that told you to travel to them cuz they’re inventory is full; yeahhhh you’re gunna have a bad time 
---
But muh $60!!!1!!!!
---
It definitely will affect the economy, you no longer have the whales going around selling weapons on /r/fo76bazaar or Ebay.
---
The devs can now put in the player vending machines, sure a lot of people might have a duped weapon or two or duped armor, but you aren't going to sell those unless you find better gear, so they don't affect the in-game economy.
---
Couple that with the fact that weapons so far cap at level 50, player level doesn't cap, and I don't believe monster levels cap, and there is obvious room for upward development of weapons.
---
Even the weapon design themselves showcase planned upwards development, all items that are legendary have 1-3 stars, but there is obviously intended 4 and 5 star equipment simply based on the fact that the star bar has up to 5 stars on it.
---
Double order on this guy's Grape Nuka....haven't had a grape soda in ages
---
New links work great, the old one said we need to sign in.
---
Yeah it’s gonna hurt. It all reduces weapon weight too 😬
---
seems like aid wasn't affected or ammo as some people still have 100k&gt;
---
Been happening to me since the hotfix patch, especially in fort defiance.
---
I believe it's related to the disappearing corpses bug.
---
I bought a handmade tse for 2000 caps and I'm pretty sure it was duped at some point. So fuck me I guess oh well
---
I'm speechless right now. it's kinda like they fixed it a bit, but not really. I guess it's a positive thing? although everyone running full sentinel is still gonna dominate pvp.
---
so... idk?
---
Congrats you are another 50+ year old soup-brained moron who remembers how glitchy games were two decades ago and think that is now the industry standard. Seems to be the key demographic of this game
---
They revenge you while in a party.  Pacifist mode prevents you from flagging, but since you were still flagged due to revenge you kinda gimped yourself by not being able to fight back.
---
yessssssss... last night just in case..i made sure to use my TSE Handmade against the queen..it broke and i even repaired it..i also went over to the golf club and there was a guy in powerarmor like level 120..was just running around in the parking lot and there were literally about 30 ghouls chasing him in a circle..they werent doing any damage to him..so i then proceeded to end the chase and we took all of them out..got sooooo much xp..but just in case i did want to use my gun for one last time
---
Hooray! Well, there's one tally for the win column
---
800 StAsH lImIt StIlL nOt EnOuGh, WtF BeThEsDa?  
---
Get a grip and be thankful they are increasing it at all.... again.  
---
We should be complaining about a bigger build budget.
---
500+ hours is not a "time waster" its almost a full time job, complaining is childish. Its a Bethesda game, its bound to be fucked, but its enjoyable beyond belief. The people that complain are the same idiots that complain to Burger King corporate phone lines about the time they didn't get enough fries, then they end up in social freakout compilations on YouTube, that's who complains. 
---
I was going to post but then I thought no, your patch notes will tell me what I need to know.  You know the issue, I don't need to repeat them. 
---
Still playing as often as I can. Enjoying myself as always. Love the removing duplicate idea! Keep moving forward.!
---
i feel that feel
---
1%
---
Suppliers not Buyers my friend.
---
Takes me 15-20 mins, farm harpers ferry, Camden park, west tek, etc.
---
Maybe different "tiers" of bunker? The lowest being the basic bunker with a hole that leads to a ladder and a 25x25x26 build area. The next tier has stairs and a 50x50x51 area, and you can swap the stairs for the ladder if you prefer it. Then the highest tier has an elevator and a 75x75x76 build area, and lets you choose whether you want to come into it at the side, at the top, or have the elevator go down to the center of the build area and have a shaft going up.
---
They implied people who purchased stuff would lose it as well, and I and many others interpreted that as individual items. Waaaaay overreaction on mine and many other's part.
---
absolutely nothing....   :)
---
There is this little detail that if I remeber correctly, there have already been like three patches that were supposed to fix duping, and did nothing.
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019)
---
Then why were quad explosive hunting rifles showing up by the hundreds after they fixed the dupe method?
---
they determined what we already knew, that only a minority of people hoard dupes to sell on ebay. that's no surprise.
---
doesn't mean a lot more than that % have at least 1 duped item.
---
they let everyone keep one
---
Thank you..i love grinding at all those places
---
truth
---
I thought the dupe issue was the cause of the servers freezing and crashing - because of the extra inventory overload. 
---
Your name gave me cancer
---
Just wait for original items to be duper again, this  “fix” just slows down the main dupers.
---
It isn't as bad as everyone was expecting
---
&gt;it was not as wide spread as everyone thought
---
I don'st see how you could possibly infer that from what they posted.  Less than 1% of accounts had massive stashes of stacked duped weapons.  That doesn't speak to the amount of duped weapons that those players distributed to others.  
---
♫...the ability to spell February... ♫
---
Yeah, like when the TSA leaves a note that says "we searched your bag, have a nice day." 
---
Brings a tear to my eye.. 
---
different people have different opinions. for the most part it's not the same people complaining about both. 
---
Bump and upvoting!
---
I do think there will be hate. Lolz
---
The duper’s had their side work nicked. And every puke with an eBay account and discretionary income are screwd. 
---
Now they’re stuck working a methlab in a Walmart parking near you.
---
I didnt lose a single item! So happy they decided to go the route they did. 
---
Sure, considering right now we can only go up or down *3*, but I like to dream big. I want to hollow out my own vault.
---
Kinda assumed that would be the 'solution' to this problem. Too nervous to 'upset' folks that 'found their weapon legit' even though the amount of people who would have actually found a TSE based off my own RNG observations is quite low. But, many people convinced the one they traded for no way was duped... 
---
With the history of past patches and their outcomes, did you not see any reason for potential concern from some players here?  Just curious.  What I saw was a ton of posts reveling in the dEsPaIr dupers would feel after Bethesda patched and accusations of anyone not sharing their zeal as dupers as well.  Turns out all that was really unwarranted, as in Bethesda's own words " **we determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined  across all three platforms needed to have duped items removed...** "
---
Their post literally mentioned duped items bought from dupers, but it's looking like they meant bulks of items, not individual items.
---
Gulper stomach backpack +1000 carry -4 Charisma.
---
But how suspicious were you that you had something that needed taking? ;)
---
Time gating content when we have already been waiting so long lmao.
---
Having duped items is lazy
---
Is this guy serious? hope not
---
Duped items is theft. Its stolen property. Its property that belongs to Bethesda that was not intended to be released in that quantity. If you unknowingly buy stolen property in real life you don't get to freaking keep it. It is returned to its owner. Everyone knew stolen property was being sold all over. You decided to take the risk same as me and purchase items from real players. Stop being so freaking selfish its not about any of us as an individual. It is about what is best for the fallout76 community as a hole. Im sure i will probably have removed items because I bought alot of gear from other players and you dont see me crying. Its the players like you throwing big cry baby fits that is the JOKE.
---
Done.
---
Glad to see humor is not lost on some people.
---
No it was the only way they could remove items. You think if they had a better way it would've gotten this out of hand?
---
I mean, they could just store inventories as a superposition of quantum states and simply collapse the waveform into your actual inventory each time you access your stash.
---
Get on it, Bethesda! Don't let the laws of the universe hold you back!
---
Maybe we should talk about your go to complaint about mold on bread is 
---
&gt;  "What the fuck is this? Fucking mold on this bread!? I paid for this sandwich, is it too much to ask for no mold? Do I need to specify OH AND BTW HOLD THE MOLD when I order?" 
---
When did society lose the capacity to bring forward an issue in an non-outrage manner? what happened to decorum and civility?
---
Maybe you need stop and concern the method you deliver feedback. regardless of how invested you are in the topic. Passion doesn't excuse being a dick. 
---
Yeah, I pick up loads. Tbf I know I use it up crafting ammo atm 
---
Yea! Fuck dupers and all the cheaters who ruin this game! Burn them at the stake in game, itll be like a modern witch hunt 
---
Nah it was very anticlimactic. They explained what they did afterwards so people were expecting the worst beforehand. Only got rid of stacks of duped items. So if you bought one super OP gun, you still got it.
---
Less than 1% of all accounts across all platforms are dupers according to Bethesda. 
---
It's almost like we are different people, and there are multiple ways to do things.  Weird.
---
crosshairs are reversed on ultrawide monitors at the moment. moving causes accuracy to increase instead of decrease, and the crosshairs imply you are significantly less accurate than you really are. 
---
Exactly.... The game is still in it's infancy and more is coming.
---
Speak for yourself.  I have a 4 story building and the camp was placed at ground level
---
Wonderful, then you won't be around much longer
---
Dude that just means that less than 1% of the 100000 people that played this game had mass amounts of the listed items in there inventories. Still a good portion and if only twenty people sold 100k duped items that floods the market. 
---
Id buy that for a dollar!
---
It's a shame people haven't grasped this yet.  Not to mention they had to bring the servers down for this.  This is not something they can do just because an stuff...
---
I’d have to think the value of any really good weapon, TSE or not, would go up since there are far less of them now.  This scan eliminated all the multiples certain players were carrying thus decreasing the availability.  I’m happy to see they went after the mass quantities of Nuka Cola too.  Duping only hurts the game, because if everyone has a certain item, then there’s nothing to strive for/value.  It was a good move on Bethesda’s part.
---
What's the rationale for saving the balance changes for 1 big update? I'm concerned that a balance update will come out, overtune somethings while nerfing others, then it taking a while for another balance patch to drop. Are  Why not isolate the impacts of the balance changes with smaller hotfixes to see if what comes out is actually desired. 
---
I almost feel like this confirms that they cannot determine if an item is actually duped or not.  Stating they are targeting players with multiple copies of rare items tells me they aren't searching by some fashion of unique ID rather just doing a search for X weapon or armor with quantities greater than 1.
---
Only 1% of people duped items* 
---
So we know what not to buy or trade for 
---
yeah they are looking for the suppliers, and my oh my have they started the salt slinging... I mean this is awesome! and now our stash got buffed?! I am seriously happy rn.
---
Please make them a separate container that has to be removed to access. Best done as a new category of a wearable item or a torso modification. Don't sell the plan as an Atom Shop collectable except as skins. 
---
Lol. I don't think anyone is gonna come out and say "yeah my stack of 100 TSE handmades is still there"
---
im worried about my hunters long coat lol
---
Yeah i hear they exist. I also hear an x01 and ultracite jetpack mods exist. But between me and 3 friends all with 200-400 hrs of gameplay each, none of us has seen them in the bunker or had the queen drop them despite killing her 75x-120x each.
---
But we have only ever seen a couple shitty TSE guns in all that time too. Again 2 between all of us. 1 shotgun, 1 guass rifle. Ive never personally gotten a TSE weapon of any kind. Just wood armor and bowling pins.
---
Im wearing almost the exact same gear i was 70 lvls ago. It's fking dumb and frustrating.
---
Me too. 
---
Nada. Nichts. Nista. Nothing ...
---
that 1% of players had enough weapons to go around for everyone and they still kept tens of thousands of weapons stacked up on their inventory
---
Great. But 800 is still not enough.
---
Oh when you say economy you mean “how I can get rich fast.”
---
Thats... kinda... dope. They did this right. People who just purchased for themselves are hard to blame for the actions of others, I didn't like the idea of those wanderers getting fucked over... but this totally saves them and halts all my worries in their tracks.
---
You won’t have that 1% flooding the market with cheap god tier weapons, those weapons will gain value over time as people who want them get them and the supply runs low. 
---
None 
---
So we have zero data to suggest "a lot more" players each have at least 1 duped item, but Bethesda saying less than 1% of players are dupers leads you to think they got them out to a vastly greater number of players?  Who is "we", and do you think most players traded real money for the items you are suggesting are dupes?  
---
Just Bethesda seeing if their patch worked.
---
Maybe 1 percent dupe but not 1 percent have duped items ......
---
Yeah when 1% of players are violating the terms of service and subsequently ruining server integrity for the other 99%, those 99% of people deserve to be angry at the 1%.
---
No deluge.  They were very targeted and “gentle.”  
---
They didn't. 
---
Players fully decked in duped gear are still going to face roll content while legitimate players struggle to get tag shots in.
---
Up three from the level you placed it at, not including that level. My current base is a 9 store, solid stone monstrosity. I'm probably going to tear it down because that many Foundation blocks takes up almost all of my budget without being able to actually put anything *inside* it.
---
This is fucking insanity. Ya'll are really going to spin anything to be against Bethesda no matter what aren't yah?
---
Like last week it was "Fix duping! We can never have an economy with duping! The economy is ruined! Delete all the duped items!"
---
This week it's
---
"Bethesda is punishing innocent players by deleted duped items! Bethesda bad!!!!"
---
This is seriously pathetic ya'll. Some of ya'll care way too much about seeing a video game and it's fans suffer.
---
I'm going to go with raider armor being the best raider-looking armor

---
it was just a loose reference, i wasn't basing my entire argument on it. just thought of it and figured it was worth mentioning. it isn't a photocopy of this situation, but it shares similarities. i enjoy the show and just wanted to pepper it in.
---
illegitimate items are illegitimate, bottom line. they should not be in the game, and should be removed because they never existed in the first place. people are not innocent because they weren't aware that their item was duped. when you engage with other players to trade, you are taking on a risk. the risk is that these items are illegitimate, and something could happen to them if they can be tracked. everyone should be considering this when making a trade. you're not an innocent bystander if you're taking on this risk. if you aren't ready to accept that, then you aren't ready to make a trade. it's just like a craigslist transaction. if there is no way for you to verify on the spot, there is a chance that you will find out that "rolex" isn't really a rolex. that is on you for engaging with a stranger and taking their word at face value.
---
just throwing even more OP weapons at a market saturated with OP weapons doesn't fix the problem, and only creates a bigger disconnect when there is no additional content to accompany it. I don't see how introducing the quadruple shot double explosive gatling shotgun is going to nullify the fact that everyone and their mom has TSEs that can mow over scorchbeasts anyway. dupers and illicit items need to be handled.
---
regardless,
---
it looks like servers are back up and things were not as extreme as everyone made it out to be (as per usual). everyone gets to keep their cheated guns. 
---
no its a meme that CAH pulled from southpark, link in my comment below.
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work no problem b 
---
I sold a TSE .50 cal to someone for 1k last night out of fear 😂
---
Slightly regretting life as not a single item in inventory was impacted and out of curiosity I just asked the buyer if it still exists!
---
Based on the follow up note from Bethesda I read it as they didn’t remove items that were individually owned- only those with multiple copies were impacted?? Would love to hear from folks on the aftermath this purge had 
---
yeah, it seems fairer than i would've done. Although what they really should have done was delete all of them, but only for people with stacks. 
---
I too have felt that pain..
---
theoretically, 1% duper population only have to sell 99 of each items to equip 100% of the playerbase with full duped gear
---
I'm known to slap frog legs on a Cajun popcorn bag on occasion.
---
So they are stacked but that's not in circulation. That doesn't mean YOU had one it meant someone had a bunch and they are gone.
---
Im so f*ckin happy. Im very satisfied with how they handled the situation. 
---
I see other players doing this periodically, such as the lunchbox at Watoga Station.
---
Fuel for the fire:
---
My brother-in-law just told me he logged in and all his stuff he traded for is still there including multiple TSE weapons. Either that combo dropped far more frequently than anyone thought or they didn't really ban all duped items.
---
key word "more" 
---
Because they have no way to actually remove the duped items without targeting legit players.
---
Aren't maintenance and patches sometimes at 3Pm eastern as well?
---
I directly quoted the patch notes.  What makes you think I need to re-read them?
---
Oh ok you don’t know what you’re talking about
---
Not according to Bethesda. It’s all in [here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019) 
---
Thanks - this is great news!
---
Tse for 700 a piece? I’d be surprised if you still have those after the patch, I have a cookie cutter tse shotgun I am fully expecting to be wiped from my inventory
---
Happen to have just one of these items? They are letting you keep one 
---
Yeah yeah, saw that now. It want communicated that way in last night's post, or at least not clearly.
---
This seriously impresses me. They did this all right. I'm kinda blown away, lol.
---
Just a random figure but one time I went to trade with a guy and he did have over 100k of each bobble head and 10 to15 of each tse so I ran not wanting to be connected with that shit. So I do know those people duped and sold probably thousands of items. Which make a tse handmade work 1k in the market when it should be worth 10 to 15k easy. 
---
But I sold that for a cookie.
---
......... I really wanted that cookie.
---
I think that they could have removed them but chose not to in order to not impact innocent buyers.  
---
Maybe read the ITV, pay attention, and be patient instead of beating a dead horse. 
---
This absolutely needed to be done.
---
Yeah. It was...interesting building this thing. I built it around the acid cave on the north edge of Lake Eloise. You know, right next to the fissure site. So as I was building it I had to stop every 5 minutes to kill *another* Scorchbeast that wanted to scream at me non-stop. Got a good bit of ultracite from it but it was annoying. 
---
Fun fact, though, if you have a 5x5 roof made of foundation blocks the scorchbeasts will happily land on it for you to fight.
---
Badly going where no-one has gone before ... I note the typo, but I am not fixing it!
---
\*less than 1%.  Not to be rude, but your theory is garbage as most players will never trade in fo76 since there's no way to set them up unless you come on reddit, which is a very small portion of people playing the game as well wouldn't you agree?
---
Dude you are so ridiculous. Seriously, just leave. 
---
Path of exile is similar do diablo 2 + 3, its like a mix of both, really in depth game with also a high learning curve, tho is stopped playing like 2 years ago when they started focusing on getting the game a bit easier and with faster pace. But i would recommend you try it as well.
---
Try messaging 1 of the community managers on here u/Ladydevann
---
900 Billion items were deleted, so I wouldn't say it was useless. Guns, ammo, consumables, and armor. A ton of illegitimate items no longer exist. Yes individual items remain, but not 900 Billion of stacked items.
---
I mean even at just 1%... some of the duper’s supposedly had..idk.. millions of lbs on the worth of stuff? 
---
How many extra, unnecessary “players” would that add up to? A lot 
---
It was total let down :(  I expected them to delete at least one or two items that I bought from other players. 
---
they are in circulation absolutely. those tens of thousands of weapons stacked up are leftovers. 
---
Because they targeted accounts with multiple of the same. And even then, they left one of the duplicated item. Did you read the statement they released?
---
How to ban all the FO76 dupers:
---
1. delete their duped items
---
2. wait for the support tickets
---
3. ???
---
4. ???
---
5. PROFIT
---
Just wait until your 55 legendaries get deleted for duping 🤨
---
Nothing at all. I'm happy about this, obviously.  The people who were buying up TSEs and AAEs are probably much happier than I am. I'm just glad I still have my claw and I can stay with my chameleon build.
---
They didn't want people Too upset I guess, everyone keeps 1 even if they were knowingly duped. They just wanted to remove Legendaries as a currency. Which is okay
---
yeah my stack of 100 TSE handmades is still there
---
Some people are just assholes.. are you on Xbox ? 
---
Haven't played since December, I'm just here to watch the shit show. 
---
I might lose some stuff, but atleast Ill still have old "All Rise" to bop some enemies with. (And some stash space finally.)
---
where did you place the camp?  By the lead node?
---
Badly going where no-one has gone before ... and NO, I am not fixing the typo!
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019) multiple items..
---
No I have like 7 different tse weapons and a few xo1 mods and serums and I still have them all
---
Really? So how do they track all these duped items now? It's because multiple items with the same ID exist. You can have multiple, say, 1* furious combat knifes exist legitimately and each with have their own ID. However if a server would notice 2 items carrying the same ID just delete one. It's ok though I know nothing about coding lol. 
---
Can I send a direct message or do I need to wait for a community manager’s reply to my post?
---
Are servers up?
---
Paid trolls friend, paid trolls. They aren't expensesive.  The amount of sickly sweet feelgood bullshittery in this sub is gonna give you the diabeetus.
---
Serendipity. 
---
Yeah, this. They didn't eliminate all duped items but just stacks that people had which they couldn't have obtained legitimately.
---
A good compromise if you ask me.
---
... and got one-shotted by whoever was nearest
---
Just like the  TS and the Explosive nerfs....... Bethesda let's the cheaters off the hook and punished legit players for not cheating.
---
*came here looking for comments how ALL duped items would be removed* yesterday i saw a bunch of em 
---
But I only have 1 of each item so I dont know if that has anything to do with it
---
Oh my god 😂
---
Agreed, that's what I'm reading. Perhaps it wasn't due to the deduping purge, just the usual "random item disappears" bug, which I've been hit with once or twice before.
---
duplicates of the same item? 
---
What does that 1% mean to you then?
---
From what it sounds like they only targeted 3 items. Weapons, armor, and Nuka-Cola
---
Same. I have a couple I picked up organically, then a couple I bought from player traders before I knew how bad duping was. Thought those 2 player ones were toast. They way they worded it in their post last night wasn't clear enough, but this is the good version of that outcome, lol.
---
But to answer your question imo no.  Game has bigger issues
---
agreed but I am looking for more stat info, I can't seem to find armor tables on this game anywhere. I think I might mix both trapper and raider for that pure garbage can look lol
---
Which makes sense I reckon. In order to duplicate, you had to have one of the item. So that's fair. And people who bought them earned their caps, so they technically earned their purchase. 
---
Good way to compromise and not piss everyone off. 
---
Its a safe bubble where you cant say anything negative about the game.
---
Basically they are stating that if an account was flagged for having large stacks that fell within search params they did a secondary search for nuka cola and then removed it.  Power armor was exempt this search but I think it implies that this was just round 1.
---
Oh awesome I’d love to come across you guys 😃
---
Confirmed not dupes..  congratulations 
---
I too have run into two of those guys while trading, you can usually smell it a mile away but sometimes it's not til you open the trade window.  I'm just asking you to consider, given the time it takes to hook up and make a trade in this game, whether 100,000 is even close to a realistic number of contacts.  I could believe they sold more than 100,000 items to unscrupulous players, but not that they did more than a few thousand trades and even that's pretty unbelievable.
---
A lot of people who had nothing to do with duping are about to get screwed over.
---
Yes. That is why. 
---
Id redownload tbh
---
You get my thumbs up for the cable company ! 
---
You're right, the average player left.
---
Old bug.
---
Halfway up the cliff between the lead node and the acid cave, positioned so both were within the build area. The top of the building is just above the top of the lead resource harvester and the inside of it is, right now, a 9 floor drop to the entrance to the cave with the acid node. I was going to add floors inside to put stuff but I don't have much budget left.
---
Same. Seriously. This earned back some faith in them from me.
---
Wonder how many of the dupe traders are going to get chargebacks if people paid via a card. This will be glorious. Finally the ban hammer
---
Literally just a "gift" emote would be game changing seriously
---
Yup
---
As this action failed to change anything tangible, I still want a full reset.
---
Damn last time I killed a person who attacked a party member I got a bounty. Was super pissed about that
---
This is the one time I wish they hadn't implemented PTT yet. Hearing all the lamentations would be one of the things that is best in life.
---
this was happening to me before this update, I also don't have that perk...
---
I will laugh super hard if they wipe the duped weapons before removing all the ways to dupe, would be a super Bethesda move.
---
... Even my TSE Hand Made is still in my inventory.
---
I havent played in a couple weeks, but if I get on and my LEGIT TSE combat shotty is gone, I'm going to be livid.
---
Meh, it doesn't seem to affect the fight much even with a bunch of underleveled folks so long as you have a few decently built 100+ folks. I do agree though that the SBQ's health should be static though for the reasons /u/Dazent pointed out.
---
Yes. The issue is more about sets and subsets than equality. Hating something about a game is not the same as hating everything about a game.
---
No they are all different guns but I only have 1 of each gun 
---
Saying the game wasn't that buggy is hilarious to me ofcourse it was more stable than post release vanilla wow lol 
---
we've got a home in the wasteland - how many pounds of stuff do you have in your home irl?  How many pounds of stuff could you fit in your home if you had to?  What if your home was as big as the one you've built in FO76?
---
The only reasons to limit stash space are technical, or as a gating mechanism.  I'm not happy with either explanation, so as soon as it's technically feasible I think they should keep upping the limit.
---
Yeah they announced more specifically that they just removed multiple copies of specific items but still left one.   Wow, they could have made that clear before today.  Well that is good at least.  
---
U lost my respect 
---
1% of accounts had to remove items. It means, when I had bought duped weapon I was not inside that 1%. So everyone still could have duped weapons inside their stash. 
---
They 100% would have had a shit storm on their hands if they removed all of them. Did you see the forums after they announced it? I woulda preferred them get rid of all the dupes too but there is NO way it wouldn't have triggered a mass whinefest. 
---
The mere IDEA of losing their "legitimately bought" duped gear had these forums foaming at the mouth. 
---
Just keep crying about it on reddit. Maybe someday you and your fellow plaintiffs will get your money back.
---
We already left the game, but we paid $60 for it and i still want my $60 to be worth, so ill keep pointing out shitty game design and bugs.
---
I'm level 120+, killing level 68ish legendary enemies, and they are sometimes dropping level 15-30 gear.. FML
---
We got frequent rad storms in F4 due to a nuke site in Boston where WV took no major hits so there wouldn’t be as many rads on the wind 
---
That's something a super would say 
---
Why so ?
---
__Just like the  TS and the Explosive nerfs....... Bethesda let's the cheaters off the hook and punished legit players for not cheating.__
---
&gt;If you received a dupe weapon it would have been taken from your inventory
---
They didn't remove all duped weapons.
---
You're not making any sense so I'm just going to stop arguing with you.  
---
Who's crying I was just pointing out that the patch didnt work like the way 100s of people expected it to work... are you serious?
---
If the sandwich shop doesn't have any non-moldy bread, maybe it's time to eat pizza for a while until they get their bread situation sorted out.
---
My camp is 5x4x4.5 over a junk node
---
Ok, I'll grant that not every player who trades is a duper. But every trader DOES deal with dupers. If you're trading, say, chems and bulked mats and power armor re-fits for weapons, you're _trading for duped gear_ at least part of the time. 
---
If it's posted in pubic, there is a _very_ high chance it's duped, even if the person currently holding it is not a duper. 
---
Most people, atleast recently I have read have been excited for the weapons to get taken out of people's possession. I honestly don't know what type of load or issues the duping causes besides the 1 way that literally crashes the particular server. Still, less than 1% of people doesn't seem like it should slow servers and stability for everyone 
---
I don’t know felt like after all this hype of a purge u had to lose something 
---
Because I paid $60 for it and i still want my $60 to be worth, so ill keep pointing out shitty game design and bugs.
---
A lot of time and patience...
---
dude, it doesn't matter if it's digital or not, the message is the same. you are engaging in trade with a stranger. that is at your own risk, bottom line. 
---
Bethesda should have addressed duping before it got this bad, but they didn't. that is a fail on their part, but they are working to correct that. That doesn't mean it's okay for people to take advantage of the exploit, and pleading ignorance doesn't make you a victim.
---
Still have both of my TSE weapons.  Guess they weren't dupes or Bethesda was far more calculated on how they were targeting dupes.
---
I mean yeah, some shit's too good to be true, but some shit people just don't know they have. 
---
The most popular duping method simply bugged your character so your inventory could not be "saved" to their servers, and when that happened the server kicked you after the save timer elapsed.  
---
So whatever items you could drop before it tried to save your character next, you could dupe.  So if transferring items to a container lags theirs servers, then we're all fucked.
---
Now, people spam-opening Nuka Cola or spam-crafting fusion cores to reach level 200, that destroyed servers in the beginning.  They then later capped how much you could do in "X" amount of time, it was like 4 things a second, it got much, much better.
---
Everyone who had many duped items probably sold them to vendors anyways. cant remove all those caps.
---
It does affect the fight when its only 3 or 4 people dealing damage or trying to be on crowd control while the rest of the group is under leveled, running around and doing nothing. At that point, its like why waste your supplies? 
---
Twice for flinching 
---
more likely they will be on a private server.
---
So for context, some of the biggest traders on market76 are around 300 Karma.  That's 300 trades where someone gave them a bump - that's very, very active fair traders in the game.  Without knowing exactly how many people are playing it's a huge leap to suggest anything other than minimal impact with trades taking as much effort and time as they do in fo76.
---
I had 2 items i highly suspect are dupes and they didn't get deleted so I guess it's not going to be that bad tbh
---
Well i don't think i've thrown a fit at all. It's 6 of one and half a dozen of the other, in that there are extremes on both sides. Some unfairly criticising non-issues and others glossing over ridiculous bugs and detrimental factors in the game. Not being able to take any criticism, and dismissing it as babies 'crying' is also pretty childish given the games obvious flaws. It's a broken mess of a game which i payed for, if i feel like criticising it quite frankly i have every right. 
---
All good man, I’m with you on assuming the majority of this game are cheaters. Seeing as how widely spread the dupe glitch was among other glitches like weight glitching, intentionally crashing servers, bobble head stacking, etc
---
Nah though my stack of 2000 nuka quant....... oooooh you almost got me there.
---
Will I be able to use my character from copy #1
---
They've posted an update that they only removed multiples of items. If someone had 10 identical TSE shotguns, now they'd have only 1.
---
I have been corrected
---
Actually with 24 players per server, you have something closer to 24/100.  
---
Seems like the legendaries run a lot.  It’s annoying and entertaining at the same time. 
---
I really don't agree with you here, but we'll see. 
---
I mean, i didn't have stacks of TSEs, so i guess that could be the reason.
---
Send her a message
---
r/unexpectedPicard
---
You are though. Going on reddit to screech that they didnt delete your "known 100% fact" duped items... you should be banned If you knowingly are keeping duped items. If not keep your mouth shut and chive on.
---
I'm more talking to the posters who were so excitedly waiting for "the dupers to cry" or whatever. 
---
[XB1]. You can have my LVL 40
---
They've let everyone keep at least a copy of each item. Actually an amazing update for once.
---
Bethesda stated they are taking those duped weapons from people. SO those are gone and it was on less than 1% of people across 3 platforms. Thats an incredibly small amount spread. Unless you are saying have a duped gun and its still there and they failed
---
I agree. 
---
Thank you very much!
---
So the overpowered players still have all the same ebay gear, just not backup copies? I thought I might lose a shottie and accepted it as the cost of the Maga movement. Make Appalachia Great Again
---
Not duped, still got um!!!!
---
The only issue I have with how Fallout 76 is the visual blurring when looking around. I really wish it could be disabled.
---
and you should take that up with the people who scammed you.
---
Patch all ready went live so people have all ready seen
---
Man, I was confused thinking Temba was an original Trek reference that I had forgotten. So relieved to see it is that new-school TNG stuff. 
---
When that small number of players are duping millions of god roll items, how is this not overblown? You never seen how many these duper mules carry around have you?
---
That may be ideal, honestly. Just need to find a way to make as small a shaft as possible. I actually tried making a single block shaft, surrounded by foundation, but you don't actually fall if you're surrounded by foundation. You just kinda float. Might work better with stacked stairs (the kind with built-in supports). Then I could have a 2x1 staircase shaft connecting the lead node to the acid node, with a bunker-like building around the cave at the bottom.
---
Yeah, noticed the build cost about half-way through. Those things get expensive *fast*.
---
Well. How are the legit player being punished in this scenario?
---
This is easily the best solution to the problem. Gotta wait to see if they'll do it or nah.
---
I’m rocking the Radstag Leather outfit with the Sack with Hoses for my head. 
---
Looks very, very raidery. 
---
i was actually looking forward to it. 
---
If it’s “hot” don’t touch it...
---
I am super innocent. If I duped shit I still wouldn't be level 30. Also if I spent 20 hrs a day on Fallout 76 I'd probably get skinned alive by my research adviser. 
---
I've been stoked since the survival mode announcement so it's kinda hard to care bout adventure now
---
I don't give a shit, none of my gear is duped. None of it was purchased from other players, because I don't want to support the duping asshats who are destroying the game. 
---
I have serious doubts as to bethesda's _ability_ to track down _specific trades_ unless they implemented some form of monitoring code or something that tracked items from known dupers over the last month or something.
---
Yeah. We gave Bethesda way more credit at being able to remove duped items than they deserved. In the end all the did was survey the player base and delete weapons from a list of common duped items. Dupe something not on that list and you could have a stack of 50 of them right now with no harm. If all you did was dupe cola you probably got off scot-free too.
---
lol removed.
---
I don't recall who they were, and we're blaming the victims now?
---
Agreed that the number I threw out there is a bit high but consider the ones that set up a market and post thier GT and people just show up doing that everyday with 30 to 40 a day adds up real quick multiply that by however many people are duping( with a higher number before they got rid of the artillery method). That's still a lot of duped items. 
---
Lol ok tough guy whatever you say
---
The amount of anti armor exploding handmades floating around for the last 2 weeks should be proof enough.
---
Patch size increase to 80.
---
do u think they are done with that? or they might still continue to look into it
---
What was removed
---
Its only about 3-5%.... at most.
---
Need to be removed 
---
Multiple copies 
---
Your single legendary that was duped wasn't affected,  doesn't mean it wasn't duped.
---
If I could give you silver I would. Take my upvote
---
My weapons are still there xD
---
I literally get only purified water and ammo every single time. It's supposed to be like that?
---
That 1% is AFTER after they mass banned dupers and all their mules and so-called innocent players. Let's not forget that
---
Awww man, I just made all this popcorn.
---
The loot issues are the biggest thing keeping me from logging in right now.  I have been playing bethesda games for many years, and I can deal with bugs.  But wasting resources on end game content to be robbed of any reward is disheartening at best. 
---
Patiently trolling reddit and patch notes, waiting for good news. 
---
Let’s say 11 million was correct. You have 110,000 effected players and 10,890,000 uneffected players. You still wanna tell me I have roughly a 1/4 chance to land in a server with a duper?
---
Well the stuff in my place doesn't count against my stash, my furniture and decorations count against my House Budget. The stuff in my stash is pretty well organized and I go through and throw stuff out that I don't need with some frequency. Because I'm capable of basic organization.
---
Don't really care why they turned the servers off for 5 hours. I was playing Resident Evil 2 remake and i was having fun
---
Maybe you should first check if the items are still there and then maybe cry.
---
&gt; No more million carry weight characters 
---
This was already fixed last patch where they forced players to drop items if carry weight was over tresh hold. 
---
I mean, per statistics, less than 10% of players on consoles, at least, (I wish PC had similar tools, but bethesda won't give us shit) are PVP players. 
---
So, unless you're exclusively targeting and killing OTHER pvp flagged players, which sure, great, good for you? 
---
You're a fucking sociopathic griefer sack of shit. 
---
if your gear is not max level, it won't be duped. Dupers wouldn't waste their time on gear that isn't max level god rolls. Since those who dupe know people who have already duped said perfect gear and can proliferate them. 
---
As someone in mostly Sentinel/Assassin armor, all the AA stuff floating around really just puts a damper on my well being. 
---
We don’t dominate, but it’s starting to become like Rock paper scissors. 
---
From a duping discord:
---
"I got hit hard lmao, went from 80k weight to 6k weight :joy::joy::joy: well thats one of my mules, I’ll check another also. It’s funny because they left me with like 10 of each weapon instead of wiping me out. Lmao all my aid is still there got loads of dog food and serums, well they cleaned me out of all 80k nuka colas."
---
the content under the post.
---
To the casual player the result of the ban is great weapons will go up in price.  Not sure what effect it had on Dupers, if you were  duper you would have 3-10+ accounts with probably 25k coins on each and you still have weapons on each account that are now worth more.  Sentinel Assassins sets sold for 25-50k before even duped.  The gold roll melee will go from 3k to max caps probably. 
---
Well that’s 1% of all accounts created which includes a ton of people not playing anymore, I think the search only looked for exact copies in stacks of 2 or more (probably 2 or 3 star only with same condition) which makes sense bc that’s guaranteed to be duped
---
Imagine you go to an open air market and two people are selling the item you want for the same price. The merchants, as far as you can tell, look about same. The items, as far as you can tell, are functionally the same. The item is legal for you to buy. 
---
Using currency they each spent the same amount of time acquiring, Customer A buys the item from one vendor and Customer B buys from the other. 
---
Customer B gets his item taken away with nothing to show for it, and he is to blame according to your view??
---
Setting aside the fact that’s not how it actually played out, you were arguing the above situation was okay. That’s nuts dude. 
---
Nah - Bethesda left out the butter and salt this time.
---
It’s called participating in the community. I’ve never duped, but idea that trading online for good items means you’re buying “duped gear” inherently is wrong. You should go online and trade! Trading with others in this game is actually a lot of fun
---
Same ! I usually read the forums while loading and today i barely had a page refreshed and my game already loaded 
---
The server stability has improved considerably since they started taking action against accounts that did a lot of duping. Before I could not play for more than 15 mins before a crash or disconnect. So good job Bethesda 
---
Only good use of MAGA, right there.
---
I guess you're right, but any sweeping action that would have negatively impacted the number of more-or-less innocent players people on the internet just refuse to believe exist so heavily could have been disastrous, this is way safer, and way less likely to negatively affect people overall. I seriously dig it.
---
No I'm at work. Nothing else to do, slow day.  So I shall also make a crying post :( leave me alone meanie
---
Also just noticed the typo in the title. My bad guys.
---
My TSE Minigun and Hand Made remain, along with a lot of other commonly traded items that were obviously duplicated. 
---
I never duplicated myself, but I'd if bern gutted losing my items yknow.
---
Ah, must have missed that update.
---
Do you happen to know what happens if you try to carry more, can you simply not pick something up or does it just reduce your movement?
---
Yeah, keeping it to one, seems they just didn't like that people were using them like currency and completely fucking over caps as a system
---
i'm sure less than 1% of the population are heroin dealers but there's still a fucking heroin problem, you tool. 
---
Yeah, I was more concerned about things being broken in character (perks, C.A.M.P., stash inventory) than any item being removed.  I had some trades that were sketch, but nothing I couldn't have lived without.
---
It did in New Vegas but I think that was a mod addition
---
Excellent news. My TSE mini gun, combat shotgun, and lever action are all intact.
---
If you can’t call your friends out for being douches and maintain a friendship, you’re not friends.
---
Saw a lot of the same happening this past weekend on PC
---
Why did they let them keep one? So they could dupe again and business as usual?  Multiples of the exact same legendary should have resulted in ALL being deleted.  This did nothing.
---
it's more than just that, the connection feels a *lot* better. things don't take up to 3 minutes to load anymore. I can actually see ghouls hitting me when I spawn in Whitesprings.
---
I held the ammo factory for 3 hours last night. I've actually had the opposite experience post patch where the servers seem dramatically improved in terms of stability and crashing frequency for me.
---
It would be nice if items that I can't drop/store/sell could be set so that I can only pick up one of them. Examples would be keys and key cards. I haven't had a chance to look if this duped item removal took care of those things, but I've mistakenly picked up multiples of a few items like that, but now cannot get rid of the duplicates.
---
Yeah! Let us put those unique hides to use in crafting! Take a page from FNV's leather armors and/or FarCry's animal-skin bags. 
---
Not sure, only time will tell... and if dupers find another exploit.
---
You expect something that will never happen to anyone in any business, I'm afraid.
---
yes but going by what items they deleted they are only considering the people with 1000's of stacks of items dupers so ...wrong
---
Right?
---
As soon as I realised what they'd done to fix the issue, I was extremely happy and had to express my happiness that Bethesda didn't make a mess of things this time around.
---
I didn’t lose a thing 😁
---
agreed!! I also want to make a set of raider power armor for SBQ but I am only level 11 now so that will take some time.
---
I wouldn’t mind it. If anything they just don’t feel like a Fallout creature to me. A giant bat sure. But one that spits electrical explosive rays doesn’t really fit the scientific future vibe. More like the magical Skyrim vibe they were copied from
---
I never could on Xbox
---
Yep. already relogged 3 times just to test it and the pip boy feels so snappy...
---
must be cached?
---
Found the duper.  But uh...  I'll give you 2000 caps for a few bags. 
---
Upvoted for awareness! We need to get attention on this, NOW!!!
---
Only males can wear the dog helmet... And girls the cat helmet. Check your gender to make sure and consider becoming TG.
---
I hear that, I get garbage wood  gear a lot. The one TSE that I got was a .44 from a legendary ghoul in a nuke zone.  Other than that I have decent gear from my early 50s (in the high 80s now) that I’ve hardly changed out. Maybe an arm or leg because what I find has a huge condition bar, but loot progression ending at 50 leaves me with nothing to do but find materials to fix my Gatling plasma after 1 core.
---
Mine survived! Phew
---
Sorry if I didn't see the reply, but I couldn't find the Radium Rifle
---
Last I played I bought some blueprints bringing me down to about 350, logged in after maintenance and had 550, an extra weapon and 3 extra armor pieces.  I know I had sold all my unwanted weaps/armor. 
---
I just checked, all good!
---
beetus is a ban hammer from life
---
Pc or console out of interest?
---
If your gonna believe that "1%" crap from Bethesda I've got some ocean front property on the West side of the Appalachia I'll sell ya.  
---
I think if i was a duper i wouldn't care to dupe weapons, i would dupe nuka-colas and other useful items like bobbleheads, etc.  
---
Many dupers probably only cared about caps and buffs or rare materials to dupe, and they didn't check for those, since they can't (?!?).
---
yes but going by what items they deleted they are only considering the people with 1000's of stacks of items dupers so...
---
That's also true. Feels so much smoother. Crawling to my base now to see how fast it will load when i relog a few times.
---
Preach! If I lose my god Gauss, I really will quit playing 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I’m just always thirsty as shit when I load up. 
---
Everything on my PC and Xbox characters still there incl my daughters character who had about 500 or so quantums she found in Flatwoods.
---
For what it’s worth, I’m on xbox. So in theory it’s definitely something their end if it’s happening across multiple platforms?
---
[Learn how to clutter, bro!!](https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/screenshot/11229851)
---
Eh, i have a bit more faith in this community :D 
---
They only became marketable after tse nerf. Thats when They started getting duped by the thousands. Its obvious They can't fix it and the only legit option they have is to monitor it. Or do an update like this every single week.
---
Thanks, very cool!
---
Happened to me yesterday for the first time last. took one across from my camp fast traveled for a vendor run as disconnected. I logged in and took it again and played for 5-6 hours without disconnect.
---
I think I get disconnected when I claim a workshop and then fast travel to/from the workshop. I was redoing my camp so I justed walked back and forthto defend it since my camp was right next to it.
---
You should be able to get fertilizer from toilets in your camp. Apalachilli should provide a temporary boost to it's output.
---
Yeah well it's based on the premise that duped items would be removed from everyone.  They were not.  Matter of fact if you do have a duped item you will still have it, just not more than one.  So they don't have this capability to remove them entirely and therefore it is not expected that they have the capability to add them then.  On that note,  Karen no longer has anything to discuss with the manager at this time.
---
Or like an actual crater would be cool.
---
They said this wasnt the last "purge" though. 
---
Trade? lul many of them just ended up giving away everything as they quit the game. Of course they don't have time to trade away everything. They just gather people around and drop tses. People carry as much as they can and start selling them on markets for other weapons
---
Highly mobile targets in a game where gunplay isn't its strongest point I kind of agree... Maybe not remove the beast but have be airborn only about 10-20% of the time.
---
&gt;The suggestion that they reached out and traded with the majority of the game's players in this time is a bad one.
---
except it's not.
---
you can check it for yourself, how many people in a given session do you see with op equips? now consider that the odds of rolling even a crappy one are astronomically low, how many do you think are legit?
---
except a huge number of players has access to them. so the logical conclusion isss...?
---
Great! That was an annoying bug. 
---
I need it
---
I'm on ps4. Pre-patch I had  disconnects very frequently and crashing. I have legitimately noticed improvements.
---
Maybe the issue and duplicate posts can be put to rest?
---
Yeah. I like fo76 overall despite everything. But the endgame... if you can call it that... doesnt exist. I dont need a strictly linear progression in an rpg, but 0 progression plus grind is unbearable. Virtually everything progression wise is rng, and the rng is so fking rare.
---
Even if this patch was to deleted said weapons, it was your fault. You didn't have to buy anything. Buying illegal things in real life does not entitle your money back.
---
Can some one from Bethesda Reply about  Better Forum Layout for Fallout 76?  
---
This is my only 3rd MMO. I wanted to know. Why is there not a better Forum Layout for Fallout 76 on bethesda.net? I expected for the Fallout 76 Forum to have a lay out like other MMOs.
---
If it is possable can we have the forums under Fallout 76 be set up something close to this.
---
News &amp; Announcements / General Discussion / Gameplay &amp; Mechanics / Support. Under those Sub topics. Like New Vault Dwellers / General Gameplay /Art &amp; Media / Suggestions / Off-Topic / Factions / PvE / PvP / RP / 
---
I bring this up because at the moment if feels like a lot of information just being placed on the forum and I cant figure out what is what. Maybe this is something that the community leaders can work on and help make happen. Might make their life easier.
---
Well that is a step in the right direction
---
And eBaying them... 
---
The issue is those 900 billion weren't in circulation which is confirmed by the fact that only stacked items were deleted. Every single one of those deleted items is already in circulation right now. All the duped shit that was going to get out into the world already is out in the world and is staying there. Sure this solves a problem in the future but as for right now the economy will stay the same. I still 100% expect to see caps have no value and people trading already circulated dupes for already circulated dupes.
---
It disincentives fair play moving forward in the future.
---
Why should I spend 10 years filing paperwork to become a US citizen if people who illegally cross the border are instantly awarded with citizenship?
---
I'm disappointed that after 400+ hours of play......my gear load out is mediocre because I didn't help seed the market for duping.
---
They serve zero purpose. Also make notes read only, not collectable so there arent 24 instances of hundreds of notes in players inventory. Only quest related notes should be able to be stored. 
---
Fantastic suggestion, yes! 
---
Guess its hard to face the truth for them.
---
http://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/149466049419/80-20-5/amp
---
Sure eBay your single item and enjoy your five bucks or however much they go for lol
---
Thank you for not removing my items. I'm sorry I was unstable about the thought of it.
---
I got 24 legendaries last night running around WS just in case my TSE Shotgun was gone. All of them were garbage but I was going to let her go out with a bang. 
---
yeah. for the first time since release, Bethesda did something right without breaking everything else.
---
the connection is as smooth as butter. well, it's as good as it's gonna get. but it's good enough.
---
Yeah I experience this as well. The longest I held the junk yard was for an hour. Any other time it's less then 20mins and I get disconnect. Its been so much worse since the last patch. 
---
This balanced nothing. Those 1% could been player who sold ingame weapons for real money and at this point weren't even active.  
---
Go purchase stolen items on Craigslist and let me know how that plays out for you.
---
Found the guy that will bitch about anything.
---
Ok, so from Bethesda's forums directly "Finally, during our investigation leading up to these actions, we determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined across all three platforms needed to have duped items removed. This means the vast majority of players did not possess multiple copies of these duped items, and have had zero items removed from their characters today."
---
Meaning you are wrong and those are legit weapons. 
---
If drinking a Nuka-Cola gives you a cap then eating canned dog food should give you a tin can.
---
And speaking of the Nuka should give a bottle too...
---
Rest assured that they left one copy of every weapon.   I’ll check soon. As in off early due to a doc appointment 
---
If you have any legendary item that is stacked that is rare to find legitimately simply due to the rarity of the legendary effects and thereby item. I found 3 TS 10mm that couldn’t stack because each had a slightly different durability. Why am I telling you any of this? Because you wouldn’t need to have 1000 to be a duper. If I saw you had 3 TSE guns stacked I’d be really suspicious but 4 is flat out proof. The chances of that actually happening are about as little as me winning the powerball jackpot if I played once a month. You don’t need large stacks for armors or weapons. Any stacks are suspicious simply because there are so many variables that make each item unique and thereby unable to be stacked
---
Will Railway Rifles be fixed soon?
---
The only thing I want in Scorchbeasts is consistency - if I cripple their wings, they should come down immediately.
---
Video?
---
This makes sense.   I can appreciate the move
---
So much this.
---
I mean, I'm sure enough remain in circulation now for eBay sellers to still operate that shit but, hopefully nowhere near the level that it was previously.
---
I dont have a video but i took a picture
---
take you're running the handmade as an auto with commando?
---
everyone overreacted, including you. unless you had mass amounts of items you are fine. go back to sleep
---
If I'm reading it correctly, they only went after weapons and armor. Plans and outfits are still out there in large quantities and will soon be out there in larger quantities.
---
I've already been refunded a while ago :) 
---
You keep crying because the game you love is literally the worst game made in years and replaced NMS as the biggest industry joke.
---
Score!
---
The self-entitlement on these kids lol
---
Yep because everyone who wants their game to function for more than 30min - 1hr at a time are the same people REEEEEEing for that class action.
---
3. Stop playing the game like most people.
---
It's a good idea to just roll with it.
---
Yeah, I lost nothing as well. I am conflicted, though. I was going to toss $40 at Firaxis, but not I don't have quite as good of an excuse.
---
Oh, I was wondering what the significance of Nuka-Cola was.  Makes sense now.
---
This is why i don't put too much stock on game subreddits, if i'm enjoying the game, i'm too busy playing and not posting to Reddit ;)
---
I'm happy that your gun remains safe :)
---
Yeah. I'm over here looking like this: https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/524/tumblr_o16n2kBlpX1ta3qyvo1_1280.jpg while playing this damn game. 
---
Good stuff 
---
This is true, but the ground work is set, they can hypothetically scan for any item in bulk and address them on a case by case basis.
---
For example, 50 handmade plans is suspicious, 50 deskfans is not.
---
My point with the post is that, while Beth. did address the weapons/armor duping, this scan also functioned as a test to see if the coding they wrote worked properly. Which, so far, all evidence says it has.
---
Well this sounds way better than I was expecting. I'm sorry, B, I was being stupid. 
---
Paragraphs in order. 
---
I honestly do not believe that a significant portion of players who received duped items are innocent. If you are a newb who's never been in the game before who's offered a trade? Sure. I can see a very small percentage (probably less than 1%) of players who receive duped items getting them in that fashion. If you know about duping, and you take it anyway, _you are culpable_ you are _guilty_ you are _the problem_. 
---
Paragraph the second. Yes. You should have turned down that duped gun. You are part of the problem. Dupers won't dupe if it's not profitable.  You are not innocent. You are not "unintentionally effected." You intentionally took a duped item, that you knew was duped.  I play this game legitimately. I have _never_ purchased an item from another player. I've faced those same challenges _without_ rewarding a duper sack of shit with caps, mats, or real world money. 
---
If you knowingly take a duped item, you are _not_ a legit player. 
---
Your example of a level 15 with a duped gun...that's a level 15 duped item. It's no good in late game. If you made that mistake and continued playing, when you LOOSE that level 15, you're not loosing much. If you've been in the game long enough to hit 50, you _should bloody well know_ by now that the duping market exists. 
---
No gamer is in a micro-cosm. No gamer is consuming this game and not talking to other people, watching youtube videos, etc. That person doesn't exist. This illusionary "innocent player" isn't real.  Even IN THE GAME, you run into people frequently bitching about dupers. Even without reddit, the bethesda forums, or youtube, if you look in an inventory and there are multiple copies of the same gun, and you don't assume they're duped, again _that's on you_. 
---
That gun might be legit. It might not. If someone is willing to sell a god-tier item, to my mind, it's duped. It's that simple. 
---
But here's the fucking reality. Every game of this type ends up with dupes, and the _good_ ones end up with dupe purges. If you purchase god-tier items from other players, that's a risk you run. 
---
Did bethesda drop the ball in allowing duping to go on as long as it did? OF course! This shouldn't have been allowed to get as bad as it  did. But "Bethesda fucked up, why should I be punished for making the problem worse". Dude. You bought duped shit. You're the fucking problem. 
---
If you loose your shit, because you bought duped gear, that's _on fucking you_. 
---
End rant. 
---
Yeah, IKR I mean I'm like wow....
---
1% duping MILLIONS of items and then distributing them into the game is absolutely a problem
---
Piss off pay 2 win guy.
---
Even the dupers loot survived. Just because it didn't disappear didn't mean it was duped. Less than 1% of players had multiple duplicates, not that less than 1% had dupes
---
It's almost like they listened..... 
---
This, right here, is exactly why I'm worried.
---
You're right, I am assuming that each item has it's own unique ID. I came to my assumption because they said they were going to be deleting duped items including ones traded. Therefore, each item much have a unique ID. How else would they be able to track items that are duped and traded? Or was it just smoke and they were purely going after people with stacked items this round? Clearly you have the answer so do tell. 
---
What is ignorant is someone commenting on another's post and then assuming that person is less intelligent than yourself simply because you dont agree. You dont know me and dont know what I do. Just like I dont know anything about you. 
---
Knowingly serving someone moldy bread is pretty cruddy
---
You can buy various nuka flavors in whitesprings... just FYI.
---
I think it made player unmovable. He had to drop items until he was below threshold. 
---
For one they did everything right, would be good if they'll keep it up.
---
you got downvoted but you did correctly identify a big issue with the game. The game doesn't seem to have much of a loot pool system so any new items dilute every other item. 
---
Mine did too! I wouldn’t even mind if we were limited to just one robot at a time.
---
***RAGE QUIT***
---
Sounds reasonable.
---
I didn't like borderlands. Found it tedious and stupid. I stopped playing after few hours.
---
I didn't post on their sub saying how bad I found it. I just uninstalled it and played something else.
---
Yes. But it’s not the cause of server issues everywhere. Just where the dupers are. Also never said it wasn’t an issue. Just one that sounds like it was blown up a bit more than it actually was
---
Definitely, especially if you're on a roll. 
---
Bro don't you know from the fanboys here that you should honored mighty bethesda allowed you the privilege to play their unfinished game
---
This thing was a balancing effort to prepare for the new PvP mode. Now that people know there aren't stacks of TSE's waiting to be bought they're less likely to risk losing the one they've got in combat (remember, new PvP will risk you dropping your gun or armor if you die).
---
I had 2k halloween candy i farmed at monster mash when hunting for combat armor to use as backup food. They took that. Its almost hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Good balanced post, it will help the economy move long nicely as now there won’t be AS MUCH of an excess of weapons and armor when people have 1 they are more likely to hold it / sell it for much higher values.
---
TBD on the future stars, I’m just guessing but the current god rolls will probably still be pretty high tier if there’s 2 or 3 top tier effects as many of them aren’t that great to begin with. 
---
I trade a decent amount for stuff I use / find but don’t “merch”, curious to hear if any legit merchants (totally fine way of playing) lost stuff that they bought multiple copies of??
---
You’re basically an online shut-in! 
---
You mean the Instigating Switchblade I received from a 3 star super mutant yesterday doesn't add up?
---
Where is this vendor located? 
---
So your saying FO76 is a moldy lettuce sandwich?
---
I feel like you probably don't live in a post apocalyptic wasteland though, I'm guessing in such a situation we would act a bit differently than throwing anything out that doesn't spark joy.  Besides, I asked how much *could* you store, not just how much *do* you currently store.  And I still suspect that an awful lot of people have more than 800lbs of stuff even if you discount furniture and decor.
---
been there reliably since the patch that changed how plans worked.
---
Waving over and emotes in general suck. Might be more effective just to use a mic.
---
I hate Fortnite but damn at least its free
---
Or doing the Tesla coil deconstruct while crouching thingy that got you 4 exp each time and a lot of copper and fusion cells

Bethesda:
---
“Finally, during our investigation leading up to these actions, we determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined across all three platforms needed to have duped items removed. This means the vast majority of players did not possess multiple copies of these duped items, and have had zero items removed from their characters today.”
---
Because they are obviously carrying inventory that was acquired through cheating. So even though u didn't actually do the crime, you are profiting from it     
---
Give it time.
---
No it’s ignorant because as you just admitted you don’t even know what they are actually doing. Goodbye kiddo

Witch hunt rule sorry buddy but report properly 
---
Same, I can’t even get into questing in this game. I’m usually huge on quests but the lack of depth revolving around every fetch and grab quest leaves me in nauseated boredom.  I have more fun getting frustrated building circular CAMPs then I do killing another cluster of mirelurks that yields only meat.
---
Yup, it’s seems like a lot, but it’s perfectly negligible. I’m still floating around 17 Perception, I’m running a Commando build. 
---
If yall have cookies I am in. I want a flair on my name here.  \^\_\^ 
---
Eeh I strem from time to time. Going to check out more of the community !
---
And bottles from alcohol
---
Great idea no reason to have that stuff and it’s a pain to drop all the random notes and tapes; maybe those can be stored on the server for access if someone really wants to review an old note? 
---
It's all speculation. All we know is that the technical support time didn't have the ability to restore lost items. People took that to mean the devs couldn't track items and ran with it.
---
No one knows whether or not devs could track items from the start, or if they had to add in code to do it after the fact. Anyone who says otherwise is talking out their arse.
---
It's based on track record (they've messed up things I never imagined a real developer could, like accidentally reverting changes and such). Plus if you go into it expecting the worst you can only be pleasantly surprised, "oh wow, they didn't mess up with this update, it's better than the last one."
---
Would love to see Nukas in my Machine :) 
---
Yeah- that's why I' love for a place to "show off" a few cool pieces in a way that isn't stealable. 
---
Yeah but they are level 4 and 7? How many caps do you need to do that
---
Great write up. Good analysis. 
---
It's 1500 pounds over your current carry weight.  So if your carry weight is 220 pounds, you can carry up to 1720 pounds.  When you hit 1720, you can no longer pick up any item or caps until you lose weight.  You can store items and drop items, but you can't sell them.  At least I don't think you can sell items if you are past the max.
---
Hmm...  I think I might test that out this weekend.  I'm curious now.
---
You don't respect him because he didn't lose anything? Wow
---
You can’t because your not a dog !!!
---
Right.
---
I assume you have no response to what happens if you get caught with stolen items that you bought on Craigslist.
---
Hint: you don't get to keep it.....and you most likely won't be reimbursed for it either.
---
Enjoy crutching Fallout with your duped gear!
---
dumb question, but where I do see the current challenges? In the pipboy?
---
Some dude drop me like 10,000 Nuke Cheery last night.  I told him I don't cheat but if he drop me an amount that seemed legit I would take them lol.  He told me he didn't swipe them but he bought them from another player so I guess that's legit since we don't know if they are duped or not 
---
Or just picked up by others...
---
What I really want are new CAMP items that attach to your stash and showcase only items that are appropriate. So a bookcase would populate with magazines, a weapons rack with guns, and most appropriately a bar with all mah booze.
---
Second floor terrace area, just a few rooms down from the bartender bot.
---
What platform? I'm on ps4
---
Well you are still on the forums, kinda like that crazy ex who drives by your house at 3am because they don't care about you anymore.
---
Some people are toxic and some or not. The fact is that game has serious problems with stability, bugs, economical balance, PvP balance, game mechanics etc and people are criticizing it for good reasons. Bethesda isn't helping at all with this situation when ignoring most of the feedback players are trying to point them out and failing to deliver fixes. People become frustrated -&gt; toxic.
---
Personally I don't believe this game will be the best MMO on the market in the near future. Game engine is way too heavy and inflexible to become anything great. Also developing team hasn't really shining with their expertise. I believe that in the best case FO76 will be mediocre MMO in the future and people will find a lot better similar games to play.
---
&gt; it will help the economy move long nicely as now there won’t be AS MUCH of an excess of 
---
Yupp, that's exactly what I was getting at. Creation Engine doesn't have a method to identify individual dupped items, so it will never fully be fixed, but Beth. did the absolute best with what they had and I applaud them for it.
---
Why?  
---
Up till now most player trading is between friends or on subreddits that have a few thousand subs which is a tiny% of the player base.  
---
Once in game player vending releases literally 100% of all players can potentially become vendors which means the SUPPLY of items being offered for sale should explode in volume.  
---
As supply goes up demand goes down and prices fall, not rise.  Am I missing something?
---
Duped stimpacks isn't exactly a big problem. They are common enough. Why would anyone buy those?
---
With regard to quest-related notes, how many (besides treasure maps) have you gone back to look at *ever*? They provide no more info than entries from terminals, but you're able to proceed to the next checkpoint without ever going back and referencing those.
---
All duped items that were put into circulation, are still in circulation. All of the deleted items weren't in circulation because of the fact that they were stacked in inventories. The inventory was cleared out, the billions of items that have already been moved remain.
---
Brb h: bloodied faster swing speed +str deathclaw gauntlet w: unyielding sentinel combat leg
---
Same shit.
---
Understood, just before the hot fix notes dropped we had no idea if we would still see our maybe duped items survived.  Just a bit of humor.  Glad whatever I bought and paid my caps for was still in my inventory.  
---
Yes dupes are in circulation. No, the stacks weren't in circulation yet. The biggest take away from this, which is a massive takeaway, is duper inventory no longer having infinite items to trade for items or caps. They spent a long time duping everything, and to have it vanish rather than traded off is fantastic. This is a massive hit to duper's lasting in this game.
---
Hey those burnt books are worth caps! I think its  half or 1 at the robot vendors lol
---
&gt; And for how many patches has Bethesda fucked something up? One. 
---
More than one. Last one was a big one, but like the nerf to production facilities having the decimal place too far over by one so that production was 1/10th what they intended. I'm sure nearly every patch had something screwed up in it.
---
Duping exists as long as the game itself. Of course nobody expect that to be fixed with any next patch, regardless of what any developer fluff text might announce. The probability of duping being fixed any next patch is low, considering the continued attempt to fix it for several months.
---
And balancing gameplay and gamedesign choices are the responsibility of developers aswell, not ours. Even if the playerbase would ask for changes, which turned out to be bad after implementing them, it would still be the developers fault. Cause the developer needs to have the insight and expertise to foresee effects and consequences of changes on gamedesign and gamebalance. 
---
The problem is, that Bethesda GS neither know how to fix those bugs, nor how to conceptualise a working gamedesign for a multiplayer game.
---
The playerbase has nothing to do with any of it. 
---
Check the thread on how they actually handled it. People only had stacks of duped items reduced to 1 rather than entirely deleted. Wins for everyone, except dupers, I think
---
oh shoot, I forgot to mention that. Will edit right now. Pc-user here :)
---
Correct in all cases... which I why I ended up abandoning it and doing my silly giant statue base next. All foundations have an invisible ramp on the sides, so that you can actually just push up against a foundation and slide up to the top. This is to prevent people from building fences out of foundations that are indestructible (which is what's happening now which is why I don't think this will be permitted in the long run). 
---
Generally imagine that each cube foundation has a slope that extends out about 10% beyond the foundation. If you have just one foundation you walk up the side of that ramp and get to the top, but if you stack them you can't because you bump into the ramp on the foundation above which then gives you that weird sort of walking through mud effect that's annoying. 
---
No.  If you've acquired more than one of any duped item all but one of them will likely disappear.
---
Todd, that you?
---
No more than 100 each.  Anything more goes on the mule.
---
on pc you bring up the map (m) and then press Z and it gives you a menu. choose challenges. 
---
I lost a witch costume I bought off Phoenix, I don't really care tbh
---
I would pay 300 Atoms for that. 
---
Hilarious, but my opinion still stands.
---
are you brain damaged or did you not even read the post? or know anything of what is even going on?  The only people affected by this were dupers, not even people who bought from dupers. There was no punishment for anyone that wasn't a duper. 
---
but i must be a pay to win guy, because i dont agree with your ludicrous bitching. 
---
Yeah, at a *bare minimum* the cars should all explode. They already explode if I punch them when walking past so I nuke shouldn't leave them at full health.
---
Dudes.  Check the mechanics.  Single items are NOT getting deleted.
---
are you on pc too? :) It's when you open map, then press Z to get the menu up and then there's the challenge-tab. In there, you'll find daily, weekly, all that jazz (Y)
---
Yup camp building is the last frontier of amusing gameplay right now. And even thats fucked with things not clipping and having to use mat/campfire "glitches" to connect things that should already connect. 
---
In which case, you should probably smoke a roll to celebrate!
---
I can trade with you. never done it before.
---
Agreed.  I thought this patch was going to be a shitshow, but it seems like it actually went pretty well.  Kudos, Bethesda.
---
Glorious.
---
No worries!
---
I just ran into vengeful mothman 10 minutes after logging in post-patch. First time, previously I only ever saw wise mothman.
---
I killed him happily and kept a broken wing as a souvenir, so I'm not qualified.
---
First iff, I agree.  
---
Second iff, you have no second iff.
---
already have an arch at my camp, so you saved some flux there. i am current at watoga station. adding you now.
---
I too miss the days when games were free.
---
I have noticed I get a half-assed version of my friend's Gun Fu perk the next day after playing with him the night before sometimes. It doesn't last long but is definitely weird, although also not a bad thing.

Yeah, hurr hurr with your stupid links.

---
it is his children. they are here to test you for your skill.
---
That's weird because everytime I've gone it hasn't been there. Guess I was just unlucky.
---
That's great. If we can just see your receipt, we'll adjust your account. You did keep you receipts, right? Right?
---
I thought it was 1% had duped
---
it only took a a few months and constant media shaming, but yeah this patch is the right direction
---
They should put 1 toilet paper on top of that note as well. Because wind...
---
This is the answer. 
---
My understanding from looking over it is that you simply can't move. I'm not sure if you can still trade or not, but that doesn't really matter. If you can still pick up items past your carry max then Beth only forced dupers to use a second account as a stockpile.
---
Even if they can't sell themselves they can drop the item and have a friend account pick it up and sell it.
---
This does depend on understanding that you can still pick up items past carry max.
---
I think this is the original dupe glitch which was patched, the current one actually requires you to craft so many of the same item in bulk it lags the server. I don’t know the exacts but this was what I’ve been told 
---
Tangentially related, was anyone else annoyed that the "Communism Posters" you buy from the *very* communist robot in Watoga are all *anti-Communism* posters?
---
the increase to 800 is the stash weight limit, unrelated to C.A.M.P. budget (i.e. the number of items you can place in your camp)
---
A step in the right direction is a step in the right direction.
---
look man, im sorry if i was a dick earlier. it's just frustrating to be dismissed as a shill bc someone has already made up their mind, and not even facts will change it.
---
i am definitely more optimistic for the game's future than most (to an extent), and for some reason people try to flip that against me and call me a shill. it is cheap and low effort. the thing is, i don't mind being realistically positive about the game, just as i don't mind being realistically negative. there is a balance, but there is this weird struggle on this sub between the extremists on both sides. your post is an example of the epitome of hyperbole and misinformation being pushed on this sub by burned players. i don't dismiss peoples' concerns, but I believe points can be made rationally and without unsupported absolutes. on the other end, you have posts that mirror yours, saying "Bethesda can do no wrong!!!" and "i have NO CLUE what anyone is talking about. my game runs GREAT. i NEVER crash and this is THE BEST GAME EVER. THANKS BETHESDA!" those people are just as ignorant as the ones screaming that the game would go free to play after 2 months.
---
We both agree, as would many others, that this game's launch has been a shit show. *but* the fact that you, I, and others are still around shows that we want this game to survive. some people are dickheads and just stick around the subs to talk shit and downvote people because their lives are miserable, but the majority of this sub enjoys the game as a whole, enjoys the concept, and would like for this game to be successful. just because you feel any of those things, doesn't mean the game isn't fucked up and Bethesda is god. it also doesn't make you a shill. 
---
I agree with your stance on the grind. some of my frustrations with the nerfs is the fact that every time we see "balance," it is usually against us and not in our favor. things like slowing extraction, making extractors pull ore instead of scrap, the heavy nerf of TS and explosive individually do make the game more tedious. the bigger problem is that it is magnified when we have been spending months playing the way we have. had the game launched like this, we'd be none the wiser, though maybe asking for buffs in some areas. the fact that we are getting these things in succession, and so late, is amplifying the effect. I completely agree with your suggestion too. keep two show and change explosive. there were definitely several better ways to do what they did. 
---
anyway, like i said, sorry for being a dick. your frustrations are valid, but i believe the message can be conveyed without exaggerating. hopefully the game stays fun enough for you to stick around. the players are in big part going to determine the future of this game, and it wont have a future if everyone vanishes. that being said, the players cant be blamed if they don't stick around. im more patient than others, and i don't blame many for leaving. there is still a lot to be done, and a lot to be fixed, and many don't want to be around for the construction. they want a finished product. at the end of the day, if you don't enjoy the game, you just don't enjoy it. Bethesda failed you somewhere along the way. maybe Bethesda will kick it into gear enough to get you to come back. here's to hoping for big things in the roadmap. imo, that is the real tell. if that roadmap isn't detailed and on point, this game will start hemorrhaging players and will bleed out *fast.* i think this game's biggest fault is the lack of a vision for a final product. hopefully it exists.
---
Lol at all the people on their high horses this week bragging about how they didn’t trade or vend with players because they knew better, and then nothing substantial happens. 
---
We just need a Duper faction in 76 so they have someone to continue to hate on. 
---
win-win! :P I accept these terms :P
---
Still nofix?
---
There are quite a few notes that start repeatable quests.. I started to go through them, and after the 100th note, I gave up. These will also have to be re-read if you log out/in
---
That too.  It's really a no-win situation for the camp owner.
---
They could implement something similar to the GE in Runescape. They define a base price for the item + base price each of mods as well as legendary effects. From there they could apply a weight to that price based on the supply and demand of that item.
---
1% duping hundreds or thousands of items is plenty to offset the 99% who didn't.
---
I was one of those doomsayers! But I don’t apologize. They didn’t exactly give us many details. 
---
That pretty neato. Should hook up a servo and have it turn side to side. ;)
---
Oh you can't move?  Damn I missed that part.  But that's a great way to do it.  You shouldn't be able to walk around with 1700+ pounds on your back anyway.  
---
But no plans to fix one of the games core mechanics? The Caution - Danger bug that has been reported again and again and again and yet no-one at Bethesda wants to acknowledge it.
---
So until one of the games most basic features is fixed. No reason to play after this patch.
---
I just saw the one by AMS...
---
no BSG is going to nerf those places
---
That looks great! Thanks for sharing your files!
---
I disagree. The dupers aren't the ones selling items for 20k caps a pop or refusing to trade for anything but the most specific other duped item. They are the ones selling TSE Handmades for 3000 caps and putting shit up on ebay. The dupers have a forum. I've been on that forum. I know how it works. Items bave absolutely zero net worth amongst the dupers. If another duper has an item they want, you guessed it, they just dupe it. Then they sell then off super cheap or for real world money. It is only AFTER the duper has already put shit into circulation that other players begin actively trading for it and overvalueing it. So the reality that people don't want to hear is that the economy won't change at all for the foreseeable future, because as someone who knows how these people operate, they function largely outside of the economy as a whole.
---
This is great news for the game. Not only is Patch 6 addressing multiple huge complaints, but they're listening and responding to the fans. People didn't seem totally psyched for the new PVP, but it sounds like this new PVE server was planned all along. I still have some faith that, once the bugs are sorted out, the new content in this game will be very fun. Thanks Bethesda for communicating.
---
I know it’s a different studio but ESO manages co-op just fine. Surely they could have drawn on their expertise if necessary.
---
Lol you think they’re going to ban every person with a duped item in their inventory? That’s 85% of their players derpin 
---
Are you also accounting for Murphy's law?
---
I’m on PC and I see griefers all the time.
---
I’ve had strangers attempt to trade with me and I keep moving on.
---
Thanks for the quick reply.  My current workaround is to place furniture against the walls so there is no need to walk close to the walls.  The worst spot is the entrance, which is flanked by two concrete walls and their invisible barriers.  And I use the only powered door that is centered.  
---
For clarification, your saying if you had multiples of rare items that were identical those were removed, but single items were not? 
---
Yep just had this with a player not in PA. So that's how they stay alive :-)
---
Pretty sure this is a newish bug. I've never seen it before.
---
Side note:  kind of cool ..I realized you can "lock" the nuka cola machine ,like a door, in your camp....to bad I cant put any on display though , maybe one day.
---
Well at least he followed rule 1
---
It is, but they should have never launched the game in the state it was in. I'm not in support of the dev team because they finally got a patch correct - though we have to wait till after it is applied to see
---
Upvote! 
---
Now...well, uhhh...bye
---
Saw it today as well.  But I think it’s been there a while. 
---
That's what it sure looks like, since I didn't lose a single thing on all three of my characters.
---
You can still create a mule account, have it go to a common travel point, leave it there and just load it up with items. Have a friend account come back and pull the items they need.
---
You never have to actually use that account.
---
Wait people are still playing this buggy unfinished POS? 
---

i was worried about my mr fuzzy costume as well lolol
---
I don't even bother playing games if their entertainment hours/dollar ratio is bad. Gotta minmax that entertainment man. 
---
Bless you for this post. This eases my mind. 
---
&gt; which means most TSE weapons people love to hate now are legit weapons. 
---
That's incorrect. They only hit people who had stockpiles of those weapons.  Read the clarfification more closely
---
&gt;  Players who had multiple copies of any of these duped items, whether  they obtained them using an exploit or by acquiring them from another  player, will find that all but one of each of those items have been  removed from their characters. 
---
What that means if if Johnny Dupes All Day traded 100 duper TSE guns to 100 different people, all 100 duplicates still exist in the inventory of those 100 players. If Johnny still had 1000 left in his inventory, 999 are gone, and he's left with one.
---
The Johnny's were the "less than 1%". Those who still benefited from actually have received duped equipment will be much, much higher.  
---
Bump and upvoting 
---
Well said.
---
I mean, I kind of half-expected that too, I just didn't post about it.
---
What is it kids say?  Sorry not sorry?
---
Its cheaper to make a whole new flamer just for the 100 fuel
---
All here. Even my possibly maybe illicitly purchased TSE shotgun. 
---
Well, I stand corrected then, they did a good job with this. 
---
did you ever get your cookies? i would also be interested in joining for cookies
---
Cool I also have a bunch of alts and have since moved on from fallout till there’s more content, but I do have numerous guns I purchased, and not for the bargain prices that are 10 times cheaper then the cheapest I bought that’s I’ve seen floating around lol. So yo say my account would have been devistated by removing said items because I’d have no weapons or caps xD 
---
 It looks like Bethesda took a cautious approach that would work out for the people I was worried about...

---
Where did your first one wonder off to? 
---
Nah, but I'm sure half the things I traded for will magically vanish.
---
Just the final straw. I'll spend my dollars elsewhere.
---
I do not very well understand what "duping" is... Sounds like an easy way to get an edge sort of thing. What's the fun in that? 
---
They are only deleting the accounts with multiple of the same item they can't prove which items are dupped unless the account has more than one of the same item
---
“Everything.”
---
Yes, now give me your $$$.
---
Yeah they probably smartening up a little and putting some sort of process in place to prevent this going forward. dupers will likely get bored and play something else, they win in the end but with a bunch of empty servers.
---
I will have you know that the 50 pieces of cork I have [strategically strapped around my body](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Junk_Shield) providing 30 damage and energy resistance spark a bunch of joy. 
---
You know it.  \^\_\^ King Mothman himself just dropped it off. &lt;3 All Hail the Mothman.
---
didn't even know you can make VTU jumpsuits. do they give any benefit without mods?
---
Not if they ended up with a stack of them. Theyight be down to 1 now
---
Wow and ultima came out in the early 00s jus' sayin'
---
A random drug test that you'd still pass if you only tested positive for one substance, and should you test positive for multiple they'd ask you cut down to one substance.
---
They only deleted duplicates of duped weapons.  If you bought a duped item and you only had that one they left it alone.  If you bought four copies, they deleted three and let you keep one.
---
we will now have Chocolate chip cookies shaped as mothman 
---
It's about the fun of it. If you have a melee build and the sign has a Troubleshooter effect, then it could do some decent damage. 
---
Not to mention, and this is paramount, it will be really cool and funny
---
That’s actually incredibly fair,  basically saying “you earned THIS ONE,  the rest are ill gotten.”  Much better than the feared “all items nuked” that was running rampant yesterday.

So a very reasonable employer lol
---
Had this problem pre patch lvl 2 with 3 cards equipped and lvl 3 with 2 cards equiped.???
---
where do i sign up?
---
good to know
---
Head of household here. Got a lot of responsibility so I can't put my headset on.
---
There's multiple reasons for people to not be mic'd up. Look to see why I'm flagging you down or be lazy and don't get any loot...... LOL..... I'm not getting a headset so I can get loot for you. Do you think I'm the government handing out welfare checks?
---
No. Your items could still be duped. They only removed those that were stockpiled beyond 1. So if someone had 1000 duped guns on them, they now have 1.  If you only have 1 duped gun on you...you still have it. It doesn't mean your guns are legit.
---
I think instead of increasing the stash, they need to improve their UI. Its like hard drive- you get hard drive full, you don't go and buy new one. With that logic you get that new hard drive full also. You either delete games or you open up some software and check what is taking so much space. Time to time I find on my hard drive temp fail and things that aren't been used for years, just taking space. Same is with inventory, they could show how much each tab is weighting and how much each stack is weighting. 
---
They specifically mentioned cola but they only removed those items if you originally had those items that were deleted in the first place. Realistically though who’s going to dupe 500 TSE rolling pins?
---
The spawns are subject to RNG like everything else in the game. Otherwise the first player to farm an area (after a server reload) would be the one to get all the fusion cores, bobbleheads and magazines.
---
I wish the purge would have been more ambitious.
---
They even allowed the friggin' dupers themselves to keep 1 "seed" of every duped item. So by tonight you'll be able to find more "totally legit" TSE crap floating around, only now the duper will make them a few at a time as needed.
---
They are going to make the box physically larger but hold the same amount of weight 
---
Without any mods they have no benefit. With mods the shielded provides 5 ballistic resistance, 5 energy resistance, 5 rad resistant, +1 STR, +2 END, +2 INT, and +2 LCK
---
Good point. Though they probably have a wide variety of them now, even if they don't have multiples of the same one.
---
I am thinking:
---
* [removed]
---
Indeed, with how the Creation Engine is set at the moment (Different RefID for every item instance) you really can't find out that. At least traders or farmers didn't get punished from this, which is fair. 
---
This doesn't take into account the people already banned. This also doesn't take into account mules of mules of mules. Just the stacks we're reduced. 
---
Don’t be a cunt, mate....
---
Yeah been there a few weeks but its 1863 caps!!! i went to the market subs and asked and someone sold me the plans for 700 caps..already had it for my main character but needed the plans for my lower level alt
---
That's true.  I'll have to gather a bunch of lead weights in the workout room and see what happens when you go over the max.
---
I just ran around Whitespring. The ghouls were frozen. Reloaded and half were frozen.
---
Did everyone clap afterward?
---
RNG must have confused me for /u/Richardgrey76 last night, then. I needed 31 screws to finish my Excavator Armor (happy level 25 day to me!) so I set up my CAMP next to Sugar Grove. First pass, another player was in the midst of ransacking the place. No big whoop; s/he was grabbing all the fans and leaving the globes and clipboards. 
---
Quit to desktop for dinner, log back in, Scorchbeast. I'm alone, just shy of level 25. My turrets decide to start firing...and it fires back. I sprint toward the building and there's a level 132 player in the parking lot, meaning General Gutsys galore patrolling just the parking lot. I turn around and a couple of level 30 Gutsys follow me. Turrets try taking them on, too. Suddenly a turret goes haywire and starts attacking my own base. 
---
I quit to main menu, relog. Turret still going batshit. I go into build mode, store it, put it back. Repair damage to base. Start going back to the building (I've checked the map, this isn't the same server), ANOTHER SCORCHBEAST. A different turret goes crazy, and I hear booming and cracking. Quit to desktop. Have a cigarette.
---
Log back on, try to repair all structures. Well, smart boy that I am, I've built a rooftop adhesive garden so to "repair all structures" I need mutfruit, corn, and tatos. For real. Won't let me do repairs without it and I can't get up to any of my crafting stations.
---
Luckily I'd recently ventured over to the Sunday Bros place and knew they had all the veggies I'd need. Took a couple of relogs and fighting through swarms of level 20+ insects in broken armor with a broken melee weapon, but finally had enough fucking ***fruit*** to repair my base. Hit the magic button, and...SCORCHBEAST.
---
The one in the transit center is just fine... bad luck server jumping?
---
So what's the deal with nuka cola? Infinite cap source I guess? Also, why didn't they ban these people?
---
Some mobs were actually running away last night.  Two level 15's chasing a 42 Wendigo was more than ridiculous.
---
" **Finally, during our investigation leading up to these actions, we determined that less than 1% of all Fallout 76 accounts combined across all three platforms needed to have duped items removed. This means the vast majority of players did not possess multiple copies of these duped items, and have had zero items removed from their characters today.** "  
---
This seems relevant :)
---
I don't recognize this. Needs more smoke, a droopy sad barrel, and a tiny rat biting it.
---
Haha sorry four dollars! My bad, asshole!
---
You really think I'm so poor I can't afford to spend 10 bucks on an OP weapon from a game?
---
More like I'm smart enough with my money not to be a fucktard like you and spend my hard earned cash on a weapon for a video game. 
---
Jesus, you're a cunt. 
---
They all seem really tired
---
Well, when you are a cannibal you burp after eating a corpse. Every. Single. Time. 
---
Or at least you used to. I mutated into an herbivore no longer eat people.
---
Exactly. Of you had multiple of the same items, wipe the enventory I say.  This also puts them on a watch list I bet. 
---
I think where I and others get flummoxed over your word choice is that a "server crash" implies that the entire server has suffered a disruption in connectivity.  It would mean that every user on the server gets booted at the same time, and that the server is inaccessible until such time as it is reset / reinitialized.
---
Increasing the amount of time the server waits before disconnecting a player it assumes has suffered a connectivity issue does not address a server crash.  If the server can count seconds to determine when it should boot a player from the game then the server is *running*.
---
Like I said above, this seems like it is meant to address connectivity issues between the player and the server. Specifically, when there is a temporary disruption in the connection.  Rather than getting disconnected you'll probably see more times when the game simply freezes all controller functions until the issues is resolved or the timer to boot you runs out.
---
He’s obviously an IRL Douchebag 
---
In a way we should have something to worry about. We know many of the items in the game are duped. We know we probably shouldn't have them. But it is what it is. The loot system needs serious overhaul. People wouldn't be doing it if they had some way to get the stuff they want. I freaked out yes. I was getting really neurotic over it. I deleted a lot of my "I love this game" posts. I was on the edge, I was going over the edge. These items are the game. For better or worse. We wouldn't turn to dupers on Reddit, or Facebook, or Discord, or eBay, or wherever if there were systems in the game that rewarded your time and effort rather than complete RNG lottery. I still say the duped items have improved the gameplay experience for many players who tire of running Whitespring and SBQ and getting practically nothing for it, but a need to go farm more materials to repair and resupply.
---
also make sure to use spotlights as they have higher enemy search factors and any turrets with line of sight and improve accuracy of turrets firing at what he spotlight is targeting makes heavy laser turrets basically melt enemies 
---
personally I place them behind my weapon turrets as often the turret can't see behind it so it causes these turrets to turn around and shoot things (mostly)
---
It's more of a joke than anything.
---
Of course not the games only been out for 3 months. You don't have to finish it in a month.
---
Not my fault you suck at Fallout without trading for duped gear. No worries though......you and your squad  still be able to cheese the queen in 3 minutes with your duped gear 
---
Looks like the people who bought single copies of duped weapons aren't even going to lose them. A shame, since that means an awful lot of the damn things are still going to be on people's accounts, and they can keep abusing their OP gear that all they did to get was throw a few thousand caps at:
---
The whiners who bought them are safe to keep stealing all the kills, unbalancing the enemy toughness dynamic, screwing up PVP, the economy, and griefing the low-levels for a while longer....
---
Bethesda said that 1% of people were duping and had their accounts banned or items removed. Problem is that this 1% SOLD weapons and armor to lots of people. Say they each sold just 10 items to ten different people. That would make 10% of the entire game's population owners of duped items. One in ten players you encountered was running broken powerful duped gear. And I'm guessing a lot more than that was sold. Which makes sense, considering what we were seeing a few weeks ago before the 2SE nerf: everyone and their grandmother's dog over LVL 60 one-shot sniping people across the map with an explosive shotgun who didn't have one, stealing all the kills on legendary enemies, and hogging XP and caps/scrap.
---
Yeah me and my friends basically roam the map and call it out for everyone to fast travel. 
---
I felt the same way. If they would have took my weapons that I spent so much time grinding for caps to get, I'd have a hard time ever playing this game again. Glad they took innocent people out the equation. 👍
---
They can make the protest signs a skin for the sledgehammer and super sledge hammer i will buy them off the atoms store
---
I also encountered each and every bug that you stated, but it didn't annoy me that much, you just leave the server and join back. I'm sure others have the same opinion as me. I guess some people are less tolerant than others.
---
I've had single player games bugs that break the save game forcing you to restart the entire 6 hours you've invested in. Now that's painful.
---
I'm not defending Bethesda but none of the FO76 bugs will set you back that amount of time.
---
Not all were dupers, some got the items from trading with dupers.  But in any event seems like a "fair" approach that won't hose people with legit items or those who traded for items in good faith.  
---
Kind of makes me wish I jumped onto the fire sales people where having on the trading forums leading up to this, lol
---
I think she is doing it on purpose after being wrecked repeatedly. 
---
I think that vagueness was deliberate so that people didn't all rush to buy them up and flood the servers with new characters holding one TSE each.
---
Look man, there have been a ton of posts about casuals, and non redditors feelings on changes to the game.
---
I'm just trying to contribute to that conversation. 
---
If you think I took the time to fabricate this, fine.
---
If I accidentally sold my All Rise.... any way to get it back?
---
Welp here is hoping Patch 7 brings enough to the table to bring back all those who have drifted away because the lack of content.
---
that's pretty chill tbh
---
What about the people who duped an awesome piece of gear and gave it to their friends?
---
Not all dupers/cheaters had full inventories of dupes.
---
All duped gear should have been eliminated from the game. Even yours.
---
Well fucking said.  Reddit is a cesspool of negativity and hyperbole.  It's as if people hate the enjoyment of others.
---
You DON'T enjoy cheaters getting their comeuppance? I would argue something might be wrong with YOU, sir. Haha
---
I had had an issue where my lockpick skill was 4 when 3 lockpick cards were equipped
---
I had had an issue where my lockpick skill was 4 when 3 lockpick cards were equipped. 
---
Without any vitriol, a lot if this sort of thing is merited considering we're now what, 4 months in with a lot of the same issues we had at launch. I don't mind waiting and submitting errors and helping them get better but it's been a pretty stagnant ride. 
---
I feel ya. Played FO 2, and was an EQ and EQ2 head. 76, despite errors, is good fun. Like EQ, people CAN make it better. In the age of spin though, the un-accountible flourish
---
-VaultedNurse
---
I mean it would make sense right? Because I’m assuming that the server loads an object or item layer. What would happen if you remove 1000s of “junkless” items like burnt books and notes? 
---
I feel like it would be an easy and cheap fix for stability. I’m no expert coder but couldn’t you just do “for each instance of burnt book, burnt magazine, burnt unstoppables, etc... delete” and load up a test server?
---
Hahaha Had to get your back on that one. 
---
Way to expose your friend whos lvl463. Fat chance thats legit. 
---
Get rid of anyone with a tse as well. 
---
You just said you disagree with what I said, but immediately stated Dupers sell items for 3000 caps or on eBay for real money. They cannot do that if they do not have infinite items now. Which is a big take away. The economy is flooded with dupes, but not in the grand scheme now. Now it's a great lake, rather than the entire ocean. You must not be able to see great improvement not in favor of dupers.
---
The issue is that it's a pain in the ass to figure out what you do and do not need. If I could mouse over Gold and see that the only plan I have that uses it is the Vault 76 Jumpsuit then I would feel more comfortable selling most of it to the first vendorbot that had any caps.
---
Meh.  I'm getting a refund on the popcorn I bought.
---
I just made the connection that handmade gun = handmade rifle. jesus I can be dim.
---
Blessed be the fruit.
---
You are what's wrong with this subreddit.
---
i dont have any duped gear. i run with an all rise and a 1 star pump shotgun. Them not deleting all duped items doesnt punish you. 
---
Yeah it’s a mystery why they didn’t ban them. At least the ones with like 10+ copies of the same weapon. 
---
Exploiters around the world rejoice.
---
That and watoga!
---
Finally Bethesda isn’t punishing regular players for their bug ridden exploit driven release.
---
Yes I've bought a couple from modus in Whitespring armory
---
That's him lol
---
Hell yeah brother, just like you lvl 50 something, no mods, map not yet explored, no legendary anything ( found some legendary stuff but it's stuff that had 0 benefits to my game play ) I guess I'm a let it melt in your mouth vs. A chew it up as fast you can kinda player. It's fun to explore knowing that you might come across something that will kill you
---
So glad Bethesda is trying to fix the game! May i recccommend with the new PvE updates for a less straining experience (not as hard to do stuff and less scorched attacking me so i can have a more smothe story experience).
---
I understand that if more hardcore fallout fans would hate this as this is my first fallout experience.
---
Nope you're in the right one. Radworms are actually Midichlorians. 
---
Sounds like you're getting the crying you wanted..
---
Likely trying not to indirectly assault their support staff.
---
Way to bring down the happiness. No one gives a shit if its clean. They just didnt want to lose weapons they paid for with legitimate caps. Not to mention the time spent hopping vendor to vendor. 
---
Good, it will give me a chance to go around and stock up on kills on my low level alts
---
Are you talking about the 500,000 that people bought for $150 on eBay? Because people DID buy those
---
The people hoping to get off on the misery of others will have to go back to kicking puppies or something.  Very sad.
---
hmmm... i wonder if this suggested it will be utilized somehow in the future.
---
- serve as a stash strictly for Nuka-Cola?
---
- random refill every day/week?
---
could be fun
---
You cant play a pvp game without this. Get over it
---
That restaurant probably didn't serve you rotten potatoes and tried to scam you before either so.. 
---
Yesterday I fast traveled to and approached a level 7 character to try and give him a level 10 legendary I found, but he kept running past me and ignoring me. I followed him and did the "come here" emote, but he just kept running. Guess I'll sell it for 2 caps.
---
tame a wild mongrel and put that bad larry on it!
---
Plasma is typically not a fuel source, but rather expended as a projectile in Fallout. Fusion cores are typically used as fuel to power mechanisms, and rarely weapons. 
---
Thanks! It's my favorite gear out of ALL the FO franchise. Was able to collect and upgrade some decent lvl 50 legendary combat armor. Effects include chameleon, health regen and the usual super mutant and ghoul damage stuff. The Assaultron helmet had a surprise bonus. It closes when I draw my weapon.   
---
All I need is a legendary sniper rifle and I'd be a death goddess.
---
I think buying items with real money like on ebay for items in a virtual world is idiotic. That's some Second Life / WoW shit. And then there's all the people complaining about how they "wasted" time. No, you chose to play a game. You already wasted that time. That was your dumb decision. 
---
Lmao, the people expecting to enjoy this day are now realizing their folly. 
---
Its the classical column
---
From what I understand, they're basing dupers off of people that have accumulated over 250K weight minimum, which would likely be impossible for someone normally playing the game unless they didn't ever scrap their junk or use it to make anything. 
---
Nippy. Kind. Langur.
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Wait: that's illegal. 
---
Nobody held you at gunpoint and forced you to buy fancy stuff in the middle of a duping epidemic.
---
Thanks buddy.  
---
Oh in that regard it does scale DR wise by the player count, but if I remember the curve table right it does go a little more gently 
---
My biggest fear is that the people who traded are going to get boned. 
---
Wow, hurtful!
---
Initial reaction indicates they did this right: people with obvious stashes of duped items lost them. People with too few suspect items to effect the economy they are trying to repair kept what they had. The issue wasn't whether a guy had a duped handmaid. The issue was if a guy had 2000 duped handmaids he could put on a vendor if/when they enable that feature. I don't want to speak too soon but this seems like a moment to actually say 'good job.' But I am still pissed at the TSE nerf ; ) 
---
cringe
---
You can't kill them. They just stand there with no health bar.
---
Enemies do have level caps but they're different for every enemy type and could always be raised. For example, I think the highest level ghouls you'll usually see are 68. I'm going off memory here so I might not be exact, and the level might be higher for nuke zone enemies.
---
And them saying they'd get us a roadmap by the end of the month is huge. That is way better than Soon (TM). That being said, if Feb 28 comes and goes and they don't at least give us an exact date for when the road map is out, then the sub will burn to the ground.
---
you can expect that all day but you are not going to get it.
---
Much of what I see is intentional ignorance, or pure stupidity. TSE were duped en mass. People knew exactly what they were doing when buying these.  If you knew what a TSE weapon was, and looked up buying one, you knew.
---
They really should have just banned them and not bothered deleting their stuff manually like this.
---
So you’re saying legendary shovels are out too? Man...
---
Technically according to your name you are either carbohydrates or a pontiff or the pontiff of carbohydrates. 
---
Yeah I wouldn't even mind stocking it myself ...and if someone picked the lock and stole it , or having the ability to break into my camp and steal it would add an interesting dynamic to pvp as well.
---
No, the Hat plan isn't Bugged in the sense it can't be learned, the COBJ Record to craft it is missing a keyword to allow crafting.  
---
Regarding the Marine helmet, I'm talking about the armored one only in the QASmoke room.
---
And if there is any "bug" involved, it's that the legendary enemy seems to not be classified as a legendary (for purposes of loot) UNLESS they regenerate (i.e. the "enemy has mutated" is triggered). It has often happened that I don't get any legendary loot when I have sustained enough damage for the legendary enemy to die before being able to regenerate.
---
yeah, it was more hurtful than i intended. i'm sorry.
---
i don think they are stopping it at the source..it sounds like they are monitoring all accounts individually
---
Right. And I'm sure you believe that illegal border crossers getting citizenship doesn't hurt the people who have been filing paperwork for 10 years trying to become citizens.
---
it should spawn nuka colas, x per hour like a water purifier.
---
What’s a 3* legendary? Haven’t seen one in years. 
---
That’s true.  The griefers don’t bug me as much anymore now that I’m lvl 103.  I am perked and weaponized pretty well to dish out some pain.  Was much more common when I was under level 50.   Even more common before they made the armor and TSE nerfs where a lot roamed around in cloaking or invisible gear 1 shotting people from a distance.  
---
I think it was them rushing the game out for money when they originally had plans for the other side of that river 
---
This was near pointless. There isn't anything stopping dupers from just making 1 or 2 duplicates to use/sell as needed.
---
And? Do you want to cause some kind of light panic or what are your intentions here???
---
I’d love that! Nuka-Cola is one of my favorite items in the game haha
---
They needed a scapegoat and found one.   Just so happens that their chosen scapegoat turned out to be a massive dud.  Nothing more than a made up boogeyman. 
---
The fact that only 1% (lol) of players are effected means it was a bullshit issue.  The fact that they didn't even delete all of the dupes and merely just got rid of attacks is beyond hilarious.   All that crying and REEEEEing for absolutely nothing. 
---
But they'll be another scapegoat soon enough. 
---
Yeah, there’s a group here that was reveling in seeing other players get their due...now they want to remind you that you have no honor, lol. 
---
I found a level 45? 35? ghoulslayer rifle it does 15% extra damage to ghouls and has a faster fire rate
---
Our not are lolz
---
Did they fix the sneak bug?
---
We are still taking about Bethesda, right?
---
But that would cost money when they could simply implement PVP servers like everyone was absolutely demanding for
---
Ah my mistake.
---
I could be wrong, but I thought this was fixed in a later patch— I used to hack robots and incite them from a distance. Later I remember trying it, but it not working anymore.
---
Lvl 45 ? Ammo type ? 
---
Unfortunately not . Mostly 1* wood armor...
---
You won’t be missed
---
So they didn't even get rid of duped materials lmao
---
I'm not aware of that, could you tell me how to test it?:)
---
I'll fire it up for the first time in a week or more and check.
---
If I can tear myself away from tetris 99
---
I’d like to see a note that said 
---
Screw you duper! Lolz
---
So, one thing that I think is being overlooked is the fact that 1% of total accounts doesn't mean that the other 99% were frequently playing.  It's like how WoW can boast having millions of accounts in existence, but that doesn't mean that all of those accounts are actually being used.  Just looking through this subreddit, there are plenty of instances where people have stated that they're either done with 76, or at least going on hiatus.
---
Those 1% duper accounts?  They were probably on a lot.  Chances are, you'd encounter some of these folks (or at least the effects of them) more often than you realised. 
---
Of course, these are assumptions, but it's the best I can do without actual data in front of me.  
---
She is just trying to escape this mess of a game amd you can't really  blame her...
---
Johnny duper is now back up to 16 rifles, Bethesda knew he was duping and did nothing but temporarily reduce his stock, why they didn’t just delete all his rifles or ban him is baffling, 
---
Hahaha. I'm probably one of those who ran from you. 
---
XBox &gt;&gt;M1chaelSavage
---
Great if you're on XBox.
---
I hope this remains but the servers are always really good for a few hours after they come back on line. Once more and more people join it may revert back.
---
Also I didn't know this but when I submitted a ticket I didn't hear back for a while, when I checked the status of it on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) it was marked resolved with  a reply. Check there first if you can.
---
So you mean my 34582 3* TSE +1Per Handmades that I totally legitimately acquired will be deleted!!??? Wow Bethesda, this is why no one likes you
---
XBox
---
It's either .45 or .308
---
Okay just double checking. I didn't even know these exist lol don't know what to offer. 200 caps? Want some mutation serums?
---
I actually bought a few TSEs yesterday for my shop. He probably thought he was getting one over on me. JOKE'S ON HIM
---
I don't usually use guns so I don'r remember what tipe of gun it is. I think it is a combat rifle.
---
The fanboys of this sub have become the physical embodiment of cringe.   Please find another word since that one exclusively applies to the nuthuggers.
---
the problem isn't all the dross, most of that it is handled client side only anyway.
---
its all the unlooted corpse containers in high traffic zones.
---
I’d get the .45 one. How about 500caps ? 
---
I have 665 dmg atm with an instigsting power fist, have to punch a robot in watoga 7 times....i think something is fucked atm
---
Yeah fuck them. I worked hard for my caps. I'm happy with this update, just hope they took the dupers accounts as well. Or brick their shit so they cant just buy another copy of the game.
---
Exactly
---
So it looks as though their server stability fixes really helped, I think all of those aside from the 3* could be explained by that. Awesome!
---
You would be fine, regardless. They took stacks of duped items and left the owner with a single copy of each. They were very careful in how they approached this from what I can tell.
---
You do realize this isn’t a bug fix and is actually a side effect of 1. removing millions of pounds of duped items from the server load and 2. kicking everyone off at the same time and now people are trickling back into the severs slowly...
---
There was no patch, so there was no bug fixes...
---
200 caps is fine, and nah I don't need any serums. You on now?
---
Does it spawn other legendaries too or is it just one 3 star every time? I've yet to do this one.
---
Cover up your entitlement is showing.
---
"Derk a durrrr!\~"
---
Some people are mad there wasn't essentially a full wipe. So you can't please everyone, apparently. 
---
Would not u be if u were slaughtered over and over lol 😂
---
Yup, the reason is angry people got their cheat shit taken. :)
---
this is a game, not immigration policy. get some fucking perspective
---
Seema like someone  used a bit too much of what rosie is on.. on all the mobs.  Some are beyond psycho crazy and some just stand there and want hugs while being dismembered 
---
Yup exactly Draull. Everyone who bought them and only had 1 of each got to keep them. So it really didn't take much and a large portion of dupes are still in the game.
---
It  doesn't look like that happened, but in the real world, if you buy a laptop for $500 and it turns out that it was stolen, you don't get to keep it. It's taken away and you have to figure out how to get your money back from the asshole that sold it to you. It's the same thing here. You bought an illegally obtained product. 
---
Yup. I tried to explain this a while ago, the end game content lack, server stability issues, etc, are problems. I hope this helped server stability and load times. I never duped anything and when I tried to explain I got shite on. 
---
Boring! Did they not even screw *anything* up? I am disappointed, this is not the service I have come to expect. Stop getting your shit together, Bethesda!
---
Just sneak and see if it says "Caution" or "Danger" 90% of the time, even if you don't see any enemies around.
---
I thought only nuka cola bottle caps where used as currency
---
That is good news. I have seen people claiming  to have  lost nothing but I don't  think they duped on this scale.
---
or ya know craft the armor for people with out the plans
---
Sherpa derpa herpa derp?
---
The hell is your last sentence?
---
sounds like we found a communist
---
sure, I would like to transfer items between characters if you could assist with that, I can sweeten the pot if I have anything else you want. Just some armor pieces from one guy to another. I play around 8pm EST typically but won't be on tonight due to valentines day.
---
I really like how now I hear a fantom “ugh” in a female voice as blood spatters my face from no apparent enemies... oh yea, my character is a dude.
---
Or be walking along and randomly hear the first couple of beeps or a triggered mine, freak out only to see there is nothing there.
---
Both games have their own charms.
---
I may have missed it but I don't remember them every stating that they fixed this. IDK, it's getting hard to keep track of what is broke, what's fixed, and what was fixed but is still broke.
---
Meanwhile I'm here being like... how did the glitch even work .-.
---
Same principle applies.
---
There was no drawback to duping. It destroyed the game economy and balance and in the end there was no punishment for it.
---
Why should I play by the rules if there is little to no punishment for cheating?
---
None of my legendary weapons were touched, as should be the case.  I didn’t dupe, nor did I make any high end purchases or random (odd) pick ups.  I either acquired them through build or loot drops from critters. 
---
Notes that have a function should be pick upable. But the vast majority dont do that and are a unique item in every single players inventory. Same with many holotapes. If they were static items youd read them once, and only one instance per server. It would have to help. Then we'd also know that everything we do have in inventory is important. Much easier to find things that way. 
---
I mean...I've watched the last few seasons of *90 Day Fiance* but I wouldn't call it "good" television.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for garbage.
---
Hi OceanSlim, I am just throwing a premise out there for people to conceive of different (mostly implausible and highly tongue in cheek) things that could result from goofy code in a new release. I admit to a slight dig with the slap damage comment, but by and large it’s just a silly way to pass some time while servers are down.
---
Here’s a crazy thing: If I thought this game was horrible or irredeemably broken, I wouldn’t even be on these forums. I would just consider it wasted money and move on - it’s not like I haven’t done that with many other games.
---
The frustration from me and probably lots of others here is that it is SO close to being a great game. I get on every day at least for a little while in hopes that most of the buggy stuff will be addressed and I can get busy having fun. If I didn’t have faith in an eventual improvement, there would be no reason to stick around. So yes, I enjoy it and appreciate the efforts of all the creative team, and yes I am equally rustled in the Jimmies region from the glitches.
---
Yep, him along with others were humiliated. Lmao, good. 
---
Amen to this.
---
You’re Saying folks are keeping burned items?
---
I'm just salty that I can't get salty anymore.  I consume way too much salt and don't want to work out.
---
They better not fuck it up and take my legitimately purchased shit or this romance is over lol. Back to fallout 4 we go !!
---
Hahaha hope you’re all set on weapons and armor cause prices just went up
---
I’m good with this update too. Never duped anything anyway. hell, tse’s we’re at vendors in the game all the time. Lots of people picked them up. 
---
There's four PA spawns in Watoga, btw
---
I feel like it's very good psychological tactic and good will forming. They took us, many who bought duped items, to the brink of thinking we were going to lose our top tier items, and then they were like hehe just kidding. And then we feel stupid for going bananas about it, but are so grateful that they didn't go so hardline with it.
---
I was wondering what was going on. I had mentally said farewell to my TSE too.
---
So what's your favorite sammich, if I can call it that?
---
God yes. My list of keys is ridiculous.
---
could buy and hold (with proper perks) any amount of nuka cola ya wanted.. dupers could ebay/auction site so on sell you 50,000 nuka colas, drinking them gave you back 1 cap, so basically bought yourself 50k caps bypassing the 25k cap limit.. spend/buy/use what ya wanted go broke.. drink 25k nuka colas and youd be at your cap limit again.. rinse and repeat.   
---
(just stating incase anyone else doesnt realize why nuka colas were duped)  
---
tldr; printing money
---
Sure I can help you out. Add me on Xbox Xindependent77  is be happy to help you out. 2 pm est is 3 am here where I live. 
---
The dupe glitch? I don't know the lastest one(s). An old one involved the bunker vendor, so I just never used it when others used it. Didn't want to trigger a red flag. 
---
Why offer the feature of trading, even with vendors, if nothing obtained via a trade is safe. I have one TSE bought from a vendor and I would be pretty salty to lose it.
---
I have a TS w/ 10%+ damage while aiming, and I seriously love it. Especially against mobs of gouls, SBQ &amp; plethora of enemies, or griefing players.
---
Amusing anecdote: I logged out with about a dozen plasma grenades, logged back in with ONE.
---
I'm not even mad; as far as fuckups go, this one is more on the hilarious side.
---
Yeah, I may be. I've probably dodged more decent players than got attacked or killed by griefers. I'm sure it will get better when I hit triple digits or squad up with people.
---
They’ve also just pushed these weapons out of their reach. I think they’re realizing that now. 
---
Fallout 4 made me lose a 100+ hour save. New vegas at launch with no internet for updates is by far the most buggy crash fest fallout game I have ever played. So yeah I agree, nothing in 76 can break the game and set you back like my experience with past titles lol.
---
Right? What am I supposed to do with this popcorn now?
---
Seriously though, good job Bethesda. Seems like the server stability is much improved too!
---
Nope. Just a few days ago I lost over 3000 fusion cells in a single test fire. Unbelievable. 
---
Dorothy II
---
Try equipping the Good Doggy perk first.
---
That was a joke.
---
Yeah - but the market will settle again in a few days. Maybe my serums I crafted will be worth more than a few caps now hehe. 
---
HAHAHAHAH
---
Gives us a way to move items to our other characters without trading with someone please.  I have had items taken from me trying to get them on another character because I don't have friends anymore to to trade with.  I'm sure I'm not the only pne that feels this way
---
Actually, I am going to reply just to let you know most people still got their “Cheat Shit” Happy valentines!
---
I was concerned due to downstream effects (intentional or not) of resolving the duping issues.  I think it was a fair and reasonable reaction given previous patches that buggered things up. 
---
Doing Grafton now, launched a nuke. 100 glowing ones and 0 legendaries. 
---
We've got cows.
---
It’s because you’re too thirsty
---
Would that not depend on the HOW he is building up his bounty? 
---
meh hardly anyone deals with caps anyways
---
Just clarifying. There's lots of posts on here now about how people are confident their weapon is somehow "clean". Just pointing that out.  I didn't really care about the duped weapons then. Don't really care now. It's nice they're cracking down on cheating, but this patch doesn't really add any magic back to the game.
---
 Not duped! Yay! 🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃
---
Praise jeebus!
---
And your still playing the game or just whining that they won’t do as you ask? 
---
Seriously, dog?
---
Does VATS still target friendlies and non-combatants? Or does it now cycle through hostiles only?
---
I'm just basing this off of Bethesda's \~ 1%.
---
To me, that means that the chance of Player A on your server being a Duper is 1%.
---
The chance of Player B on your serve being a Duper is 1%
---
The chance of Player A or Player B being a Duper is therefore 2%.  
---
With 24 Player slots, I believe that scales.
---
The chance of Both being a Duper is .01%
---
Its been a very long time since I took Probability and Statistics, but I would happily stand corrected to someone showing some math.
---
Just to add some math....
---
If 1% of the players are "dupers", leaving undefined exactly what that means, and if there are 24 players on a server, then the chances that there is at least one duper at any given time is around 20%. 
---
1 - (99/100)\^23 = 20.6%
---
(We use a 23 there instead of a 24 because of course **you**, dear reader, are innocent. It's the **other** 23 people we need to be suspicious of.)
---
That's a simplistic estimate; dupers are probably congregated rather than uniformly distributed. And over the course of a play session people come and go, so the chances that you're on at the same time as a duper for at least part of your session should be higher.
---
Also keep in mind that Bethesda said they banned a bunch of dupers a little while ago, which seems to be true. So the 1% that they're reporting here is after that elimination round already occurred.
---
I offer no opinion on whether that 20% should be considered "high" or "low". But it is, with the above caveats, accurate.
---
No patch. Was all server side work.
---
3 isn't a good sample size but congrats on the luck. That's a hell of a roll you're on.
---
&gt; There was no patch, so there was no bug fixes...
---
Only half true: there was no client patch, the server code may well have been updated. And all these bugs seem to be –or have been– server side.
---
Sorry to tell you the bad news but....Didnt take those stacks. And theres no settling the people who were doing the majority of selling had stacks of guns and armor. They arent going to let go of their one copy
---
I'm on xbox and didn't have a download. 
---
what's your timezone? we can work something out
---
Really! That's great news. Thank you.
---
Huh, I was hoping for a slew of 'I quit' posts. Oh well. Now I just have to wait until I get home and see if my triple set of All Rise made it through intact :)
---
Well the values of tse weapons and crazy mele  just went up
---
How fast does your TSE lever break? With gunsmith level 5 mine still breaks MUCH faster than any other gun. I thought maybe the two shot perks doubled the hit on durability... or my gun is bugged. 
---
The only way I would see this done is that they only remove duplicates of legendaries in your inventory.  Only if you have the exact duplicate (same weapon, same level of star, same extra effects) and leave you only one copy.  This is the only way I see this possible.  Or there's a unique Identifier number that items get assigned when created which is unique and duplicates would be seen right away if it retains the same identifier but that would be crazy to manage and unlikely.
---
Hahaha thats because they would trade piece for piece on the things they had multiple copies of
---
CEST I’m in Europe yeah sure we’ll work it out 
---
&gt;Bethesda is trying to fix this game
---
Are they really though? I've been hearing of the server issues since beta times, those are still there and I bought the game in january hoping it would already be gone.
---
I heard of the workbenches not working glitch, it's still there.
---
I heard of the duplicating of items, it has ONLY NOW been resolved, when I think that the two points above should have been a real priority, not that one.
---
I've noticed fixing, but they don't seem to focus their efforts on the right problems. Server issues should have been resolved long ago, why is it still a thing?!
---
This happened to me last night near the waterpark north of Grafton
---
Well that sucks. I wanted all the dupes nuked.
---
I have a 3* anti-armor rolling pin with extra limb damage and agility. It's funny. 
---
HAH! I hit the damn nail on the head! The duper purge followed almost immediately by a stash size limit increase! 
---

---
Good point. You get to keep the cap when you drink a nuka cola but you don't get the bottle.
---
Clean or legit..?... hahaha PSA: It’s only a game..!
---
I would have gladly sacrificed all the tses i bought to be rid of the sentinal assassin godmode jerks, this sucks.
---
I post the link from time to time. Rarely get any comments on it tho,lol. 
---
But its a very interesting blog that kills so many and close to all assumptions made by gamers (armchair developers) on the internet. 
---
I know that developer is out to spread the word, so feel free to link to his blogsposts anytime you want.
---
yes I know and the few times shit was sold for caps it was a trivial amount
---
Looks like that post was AFTER the downtime started so I don't think they had too much warning
---
Ya I think this is good because same with me I spent hours grinding caps to get my first tse and it was a shotgun and I’m just hoping I still have it
---
It really doesn't change anything aside from making it less convenient to dupe, people can still dupe and sell on demand.  They just won't dupe a massive amount at a time.  
---
DUPER! 😂 
---
Interesting though, I wouldn’t think plasma grenades would be one of their targeted items but maybe they mistyped something. 
---
Nice suggestion, one thing i personally would like is for our actions to have effect on the world, maybe with the first big PvE DLC people who completed main quest and killed SBQ would get connected to servers where the scorched were defeated and there would be other threat or something similar to that
---
i lol'd
---
I've had one sitting in my stash from back when I completed the mayor for the day after hitting lvl 50. Doesn't hurt to have a spare. There's melee builds out there that have had their weapons break while making their way through the silo.
---
I now fear they are truly placating exploiters and those who engage them simply to preserve active players.
---
So like, if anyone on PSN wants to do this to me I will happily put a bullet into a 3\*. Thanks for the new info :o They do need an emote for this though. 
---
Also, a "Take my paper bag" emote.
---
No. 
---
&gt;Many people are gonna lose their duped weapons. 
---
No one lost their duped weapons, except for those dupers hoarding stacks of them.
---
is it still the same? not home yet so cant check
---
Amen
---
I think you're hyperbolizing a little.  Trading is safe, just with one major change; if you already have an item, don't trade for an exact copy of the same item (talking legendary mods, not craftable mods).  That is in fact more restrictive than it was in the past, but overall doesn't seem very restrictive to me.
---
Caps still are the main trading currency. Some top tier traders did trade only, for their top tier items. 
---
But that isn't the norm. 
---
Caps still are the norm. Even before this patch. 
---
LEGENDARY DIABETES 👍
---
&gt;  Players who had multiple copies of any of these duped items, whether they obtained them using an exploit or by acquiring them from another player, will find that all but one of each of those items have been removed from their characters. 
---
This is actually good news. Sounds like everyone, myself included, concerned about traded items being destroyed and the most frustrating thing in any game lost time is now avoided. 
---
Not really. It boils down to them claiming they can’t change player inventory. Removing items isn’t really that much different than adding them. 
---
one of my favorite mods to add in skyrim/f04/fnv they are craftable, add carry weight, can be upgraded, and gives me one more thing to collect ( like those stupid teddy bears I cannot scrap)
---
You only need 1 to make another copy...
---
Not trying to be insulting, but what made you think that stealth was on the list for this patch? 
---
Forgive me; never played Fallout76, but I am a programmer and gamer.
---
- How the fuck is that even possible? Does Fallout76 not use central servers?! The last AAA game I played with that problem was Diablo2. When Diablo2 was released, 96% of Americans had either 56k dialup, or no internet access at all.
---
- How do you justify continuing to support this game? Everything I’ve EVER areas about 76 has been atrocious. Duplicated items, horrible game-crashing bugs, not a single good review, little or no communication, the canvas bag fiasco, the store being updated with new items while the gameplay languishes...
---
I
---
Cleared the golf club, killed all mobs, including the one that gets stuck behind the counter. Did that twice and sneaking shows up as Hidden. Maybe i'm just not affected by that bug?
---
While I agree with most of your post. There is a great lack of fun in 76.. I have no main quest haven't had one since like lvl 45. Only reason I log in anymore is to hang out at my house I spent a long time building getting the plans.  
---
Over all the game is currently boring. All there is to do is go kill some npc over and over and over or launch a nuke for the gillionth time.  
---
This game needs content.. pure and simple  
---
I've posted ideas for fun things to do but they don't seem to get but around 8 or 9 upvotes and thus bethesda probably never sees them, yet stupid stuff gets 1k 2k upvotes.
---
Some of the ideas I've had.
---
Home terminal system for log entry, playing games, communicating with other players. and like share games.  
---
Community camps where a few or several people can come together and build something together in a big area with lots of budget.
---
Player ran quests for other players. ( i also saw other people saying this as well)  
---
create quest perhaps via terminal and send it out to other players if they accept they do what you asked of them in the quest. or pip-boy to pip-boy custom quest giving.
---
More building sets for more verity camps as well as more decoration stuff.
---
Roleplay tools to encourage roleplay.
---
a restore buildings system to do what the game says it's meant to do rebuild. go around and use resources to restore a building.
---
and much much more..
---
I hope it's just a matter of time before we see more things to do, not just more to kill.  
---
This is a multiplayer game after all.  
---
I still have hope for the game.
---
So feel free to continue decking yourself out with illegitimate items
---
Y'all git any Lamp?
---
They’re not jerks they’re douchebaggery 
---
He was too lazy to farm mats so he stole yours
---
Keys should be in a keyring/password submenu, so its occupies a single visual slot in pipboy, but you can browse if you desire. I feel like some previous Bethesda games have done it this way
---
**Simple fix**: Delete all duplicate keys, make it give an error saying "you already have this key" if you try to pick up a second copy.
---
Still targets friendlies... :(
---
By the nine no.
---
duping never gets fixed in games dupers find new ways 
---
Welcome to the world dude. Every corporation in every industry is in it to make money, that's their entire reason for existing.
---
That's cool man, you are entitled to your opinion.  No hard feelings, be safe out in the Wasteland.
---
No no 
---
but why does his friend go from 219 to 2?
---
Screeching like a scorchbeast in the mic while invisible watching a low level panick is fun
---
On xbox maybe pc more like 1/10
---
Twist; he is a dev. and it all exactly happens this way.
---
Bump
---
I’d rather surrender the workshop and lose 25 caps then mats I need to repair guns and gear
---
THIS
---
I honestly would never drink my Nukas and just constantly supply my machine.  I would even buy all the different flavors to stock my machine if I could. 
---
I had this happen a a few nights back. All 3 equipped but only lvl 1 skill. Just jump servers. That fixed it for me. 
---
and then who ever does that go to jail for manslaughter 
---
The event has 1 forsure 3* Mister gutsy, most I ever seen was 2x 3* and a 1* for the event. Usually its just the one 3* and the odd time you get another legendary. There is a chance for a 3* reward from the event too, its where I got my AA/E combat shotgun, which is probably being deleted as we speak 😁
---
West tek(the building) usually only has a legendary if its a super mutant spawn.
---
You're reading way to much into this. I don't care. Some people might. But those people who do care should understand that it's still very unlikely that their weapons are clean. That's all. I could care less what guns people use. If it's fun and makes you happy, go for it. It's just a video game.
---
Game balance? What's this sorcery you speak of?
---
Except removing the duped stuff haha
---
I like my gun babies
---
made me laugh
---
Angry? People need to grow/man the fuck up.
---
&gt;for fans of PvP
---
Just work on PVE stuff, nobody asked for PVP in Fallout.
---
I don't think anyone cares about events and challenges, they're more of an annoyance than anything else.
---
Yes i forgot about the roof top one
---
Same reasoning on how it got broke in the first place. Seeing how people are reporting that SBQ is flying out of bounds (a reverted "fix" of the past) that maybe stealth would revert. Just being hopeful.
---
Not a bug, except for maybe the falling out of the sky, maybe you showed up at the exact second they spawned. It's one of the random encounters. i'm assuming its from Zetan Cattle abductions lol. 
---
I’d have just logged off
---
Wish bethesda would give us a middle finger emoji 
---
I agree with your general sentiment, but I think that would too easily be a defeat of the main antagonist of the game.
---
Personally, I think the final content update to 76 should be a quest to order an initial strike and obliterate the area and all of its inhabitants as a final means of dealing with the scorched plague. This would serve two purposes: 1. A final history over the scorched and 2. This would explain why none of these creatures and W.V. in general, aren't mentioned in games set much later in the chronology.
---
With rad worms, you gain +1. When it wears off, -1.
---
LOL No
---
Yeah that’s what I meant but I can see how my comment could have been ambiguous. 
---
What I meant was that I’m glad they didn’t give any info until after. 
---
it's not a bug. It's a feature.
---
It is me, and I am legit. No need for me to prove it to you though 
---
Hell no
---
It's not like anything could possibly go wrong...
---
Ya they fixed it much earlier, a few patches ago. Would have to dig. But I guess it’s back 
---
I think you are right.    Tried again later and its all good.    Its strange though, the chassis were not there either.   
---
They banned my friend who never duped anything, probably couldn't even if he wanted to, and didn't have many duped items given to him. The only thing he could think of was that he made a tonnnn of ammo  for a friend back to back. Like 50,000
---
Then boom. Banned.
---
Who's to say they don't fuck this up somehow? 
---
It’s raining cats and dogs out, no wait it’s getting heavier... 🐂🐂
---
I'd rather be elseweyr.....
---
Honestly?
---
This approaches pleases the dupers and the people who bought from them.
---
Anyone who isn't one or the other has probably already given up on this game and left.
---
They just stopped worrying now that no one has a TSE handmade anymore
---
\*One small and completely non-sarcastic round of applause for Bethesda\*
---
However if you are Bloodied build, your VATS and Sneak attacks will multiply off it. E.g. if you have a Bloodied Rifle thats up to 1k damage. If you get a 3x VATS Crit in stealth with 2.5x. Thats (3 x 1,000) + (2.5x 1000) = 5,500 damage.

200 lbs of junk and plans. Waiting for player vending to set up my shop
---
Check the trading bazaar, anyone that completed the quest over 50 has one that they can sell you, alternatively play though the game with an alt and trade to your self via a friend. 
---
Cows! We got cows!
---
Listen. What's the difference between someone who hits level 50 shoots a 3 star legendary and gets a top tier item? And you grind for 400 hours every day for months and get practically nothing? Is that fair? What's the difference if that guy who got that item on the first 3 star legendary he killed selling it to you for 5000 caps, and a duper selling it to you for 5000 caps? You get the weapon either way. You don't have to waste 400 hours of your life trying to get it "Honestly".
---
Somebody just now on the trading subs: "*Trading is dead.*"
---
People will bitch about anything lol
---
I was tempted to but quite frankly I didn't want to give him that satisfaction.  I wasn't completely passive about it either.  I fired a few shots from the tse another player gave me near him as a warning to back off.  In the end I just drank some canned coffee and ran away until I could fast travel.  I would love a middle finger emoji or something similar.
---
&gt; Within the blast zone, the grass and tree leaves should disappear. I know someone already suggested this, but I would love to see it implemented.
---
I love this idea, especially if they could make it take days to grow back from being chard and burnt.
---
I just presume they missed a 0 on the end of it.
---
I don’t know, man. I don’t work for them. I was just trying to be positive. You just want to be negative. 
---
Video or it never happens.
---
Journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step.
---
No just get better stuff 
---
yeah - with this patch it seems like they are moving in the right direction..i actually didnt know they were going to increase the stash limit..and i thought my TSEs were pretty much gone
---
I've seen so many people do that on so many games, seriously. I think some people are, umm ... '*ignorant'* enough to expect a game (and/or game company) to cater to their personal desires and if THEY become bored (after any amount of hours), the game is trash and fk the studio!
---
L. O. L.
---
Could you lick their boots any harder if you tried?
---
No. Go back to fortnite
---
I actually look forward to the inside the Vault posts.
---
Looks really good, it'll be nice not being wanted because I went a little trigger wacky. 
---
I hope some of this new content let's us into more interiors, particularly under Huntersville, Watoga parking garages and estate. It bothers me more than it should that I can't get into these areas. Regardless the new content is something I'm looking forward to, interiors or not. 
---
Waiting on that Enclave power armor skin too. 😉
---
Hard pass
---
Guess we'll see what happens, why don't you try to dupe 'em then?
---
^(no)
---
How do you have faith they'll not fuck this up too?
---
It's possible they fixed it. I'll cross my fingers when I log in later.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/6XRPMub](https://imgur.com/a/6XRPMub) Got one today
---
I'll take three bags.
---
Yeah.... they're all for me.
---
Wait, what happened?
---
I had this in a fo4 mod.  
---
He logged onto his mule 
---
According to Bethesdas logic yes
---
Yeah, we know that *now*, but they did not inform us of that yesterday. If they had been upfront about that little detail, it would have saved us the mass hysteria.
---
ah that sucks, there were a couple of high level mobs that were stuck in t-pose when i first started, got a couple of quick levels running up to them and killing them. 
---
You're incorrectly interpreting the "1% of players" as an indicator of how widespread the problem is.  With the way they scrubbed the duplicate items, that number means practically nothing.
---
Breaking it down simply:  
---
1. 1000 people are playing  
---
2. 6 of those people use glitches to make 1000 cheatguns each
---
Those 6 people give, eBay sell, caps-trade, or otherwise distribute cheatguns to the rest of the population.  
---
3. 600 people each buy/receive one cheatgun, 3 distributor buddies each get 200 cheatguns, and the six original cheaters still have 900 each.  
---
4. The "Spring Cleaning" removes 899 guns from each of the six original cheaters, and 199 guns from their three distributor buddies  
---
5. 9 out of the 1000 players (less than 1%) are affected  
---
There are still 609 cheatguns in circulation, well over half the player population
---
So, they don't know what items are duplicated, just that if you have more than a certain number it was implied it was duplicated so all but one was removed. Meaning, if you bought an item that was duplicated and only have one of them, you probably still have it.
---
Wish I could downvote this endlessly lol
---
All you can do is log off or leave
---
Thanks for reading, really appreciate your input and information. Maybe if screws were made from both Copper and Steel? The main problem I am having with this game to begin with is absolutely needing power armor, which I heavily prefer not to use, so I tried to come up with some ideas that weren’t so PA oriented. Also, I have no clue what ADS stands for.
---
If you have the reduced shotgun weight perk and happen to catch Uranium Fever you can collect enough crap from the mole miners to clear out every singe vendor in less than 20 minutes.
---
Shotguns: 9-25 depending on type and quality
---
Miner Gauntlets: 12-15 
---
Glowing Meat Steak: 10
---
Glowing Blood: 7
---
So far so good! Checked my stash and everything stayed put. No issues with connections so far. I'm hoping we keep this upward trajectory going.
---
Burt books make no sense anyway.. where was the fire? if it was due to rads then why is everything else around them ok...
---
If anyone has 50 desk fans they want to get rid of, though, I could surely use them. Screws are the bane of my life.
---
I think people do this, but remember you have to clear a silo which takes about an hour to do so more often people don't "explore" with their nukes
---
No no no
---
You're not a Fallout fan.
---
Its just bro duping so all good
---
Yeah I never understood that dupe. But also rarely see anyone at the bunker. 
---
You have died of dysentery.
---
Are... are you actually initiating a Star Trek argument on the internet? This is awesome. 
---
Great, I will ping you a friend request and check my inventory for what I can throw your way!
---
Actually, this was to not punish people who bought a duped item. If they deleted everything, that group would be the ones complaining. Can't please everyone.
---
Nah I glitches myself to a lower level for no reason
---
Justify it however you like.
---
If you have a Two-Shot singularity generator, is it a bilateral no, um, duolarity, oh I give up
---
yes
---
Hopefully anyone who read your comment could see the excitement and assumed you thought it was awesome. 
---
DELETE item WHERE count &gt; 1  
---
"Uh oh, our bad"
---
No thanks, plenty other games out there with Battle Royale.  
---
Not the case, sadly. Just did Uranium Fever twice. Two three star mobs in each session, both dropped 2\* items. Also did One Violent Night and did get a 3\* item from the night stalker, but two 3\* ghouls also spawned (never seen that before) - one dropped a 3\*, the other dropped a 2\*.
---
You got an Unyielding Sentinel Boss combat armor chest piece now too bruh....... twinsies!!!!
---
Thank you for doing this. 
---
I did Uranium Fever a couple days ago, a fairly popular event because usually 3 legendary spawn at a minimum. There was, of course, a TSE shotgunner there and he, of course, was still one/two shotting everything including the legendaries. 
---
In the very same event, a 3\*spawned right behind me and started beating on me. Mr. TSE was in the other room, but like a bro (or a sucker, I guess) I tagged him twice with my handmade, triggered his health regen then walked him back over to the other guys so they could get marks in. 
---
Assholes did not return that favor on the final spawn. Blasted at 3\* at near pointblank range twice and killed it just like that. 
---
Don't be dicks people... 
---
So it's basically zero punishment for dupers. Dupe all you want, there will be no consequences. Sure. Whatever. 
---
well done indeed
---
thx!!
---
ROFL... well  done... and it WAS Soda Pop... and why or would it be how it is now that or Soda or Pop or Coke vs Pepsi vs. Tab vs. RC but really Raiders is the same issue as you pointed out is a common name because that is what you would be if called in a historic viewer "as told by" view point at best and each group is known to have it's own name so it's like say to "Indians"  and to my limited knowledge no "native america" claimed that. As for SM I would guess since they are a direct cause they are do have the right to know what they are. I love the fact that so may say there is nothing of story to this game but then what is this lol? Yes there should be more. Yes this should and could have been better and would have even been a great F5, but we are still here playing it so take it or leave it right?
---
How about when then the circle gets really really small and we all meet in the middle we just trade plans and play the banjo and shit. Banjo royale!
---
Even easier to just travel The Vault 76 and kill the liberators that keep spawning out front.
---
I hears ya! Melee build equals human punching bag. Worth considering.
---
Everybody has a test server, Some people are lucky enough to have it separate from the Prod server ;)
---
I have the vault tec jumpsuit that you get from the overseer crates but is that the same as the plan you find randomly or?
---
I’m talking about all the junkless items that load in by default, not the ones in players inventories.
---
Any number of false positives is too many. Legitimate players do not deserve to be punished for other players wrongdoing. That's simply unacceptable.
---
Furthermore, a gear level increase is inevitable. I guess you've never played any other looter action games, but gear level increases are standard practice.
---
I should have clarified, that was asking for info on the damage thing not stealth. Stealth is being actively investigated still however as there are a lot of different factors with armor and perks to narrow it down to.
---
I think the bigger issue with duped items is that they would have flooded the in-game market whenever they implement the player vending update. So even if very few people actually duped, it would have had an exponentially bigger impact on the in-game economy.
---
Nice! Now make a version you can put a micro servo in to rotate back and fourth...
---
Do you think grinding for 400 hours in a big RNG lottery is fulfilling end game content? Wouldn't you rather have the items and actually play the game? Have fun doing whatever you want to do, rather than the need to constantly grind the same mobs over and over getting disappointing drop after disappointing drop day after day?
---
No I’m saying the ones that load in by default, I’m not talking about player inventories
---
Yes a DM is perfect!
---
But me and my squad can dupe what we find and share it with each other?
---
Suck it solo players!!!!!!!!!
---
I wonder what would happen if someone tried to power power armor with an ultracite fusion core.
---
Woah. Congrats! Big win!
---
Name checks out....
---
Can you explain this whole duping thing to me? I haven't played the game, just seen some of the posts and video bad mouthing the game. Want to understand the controversy/ what's going on better.
---
Checking my character when I get back home from school lol.. also I just thought of this I shoulda done this last night but I didn’t know about this update until this morning:
---
What if you modify a duped weapon? Doesn’t that affect its “id” per say? So like let’s say you dupe a hardened TSE handmade. What would happen if you modify the receiver to prime, and barrel length to short, so it becomes Prime Short Two Shot handmade?
---
It's new PvE *content*, but not a separate server.
---
Yeah, good job Bethesda for looking after your game that you truly screwed up.
---
There is a button called Uninstall...
---
Crying still, can't stop me
---
Thanks. I see the potential here, but how realistic is it to actually happen on a consistent basis? My experience with the game so far is not very likely. I don't tend to see people in the game doing this a lot. I realize some people have been griefed, but I don't think you'll be able to stop all instances of it no matter what Bethesda does, which is what some people seem to want them to do.   
---
I'd honestly rather they focused on other problems, exploits, and new content instead of focusing on something that from what I've experienced has been a relatively small issue as of now (I've probably played close to 150 hours at this point through 5 different character builds and I can count the amount of griefing I've experienced on one hand.  
---
Let me also note I realize my experience is not the same as everyone else in the game. But I think if the expectation is to eliminate all instances on griefing from the game, I just don't see that happening. And eliminating what could be a perceived issue before it is one, instead of focusing manpower on things that have proven to be a problem is an easy choice for me to choose between honestly.
---
You'll be fine. Their forum post outlined the process, and they allowed everyone to keep one of everything even if they knew it was a dupe. The only people affected by this are the assholes with stacks of ill gotten items.
---
I suppose it's covering their backs in the event they could have wiped genuine items and not punishing those who traded in good faith or didn't even know duping was a thing. 
---
I've honestly never traded with another player or bought anything that wasn't a plan from vendors so I'm sure I'm one of plenty of people who aren't in your bracket of players.
---
Yea I haven’t been able to actually harvest from a workshop after the initial build up in at least a week. 
---
It might Be better if you never leave, I took the steel mill and held it for a while to load up some steel.  But other then that it usually crashes right as I go “I should go back and harvest!” 
---
Any changes since the Pearl Abyss buy out?
---
&gt; I thought maybe the two shot perks doubled the hit on durability
---
Durability is applied for every shot that hits, so yes, your durability loss is doubled if both shots hit.
---
It's been acknowledged as being looked into; it might still make it into the patch even though it wasn't called out today.
---
if the item was tainted in some way by fault of the seller, unfortunately, customer B gets caught in the cross fire. both customer A and B are getting the items on the secondary market (not directly from gameplay). they should be aware of the risks of doing so. customer B bought an item that is legal, but the seller acquired it illegally, therefore it is taken away from the buyer by the police (Bethesda). you're going to blame the police for confiscating something that you shouldn't have been in possession of in the first place? no. it's mainly the fault of the seller that manipulated the system, but it is also partially the fault of the buyer, as they are naturally assuming risk by getting the product from a secondary source. saying "well i didn't know it was stolen" (illegitimate) doesn't nullify the fact that it is. it needs to be corrected.
---
I had that yesterday though on XB1
---
You never heard of "not attracting attention" that is literally the opposite of positing videos on youtube with the title "how to dupe items in fallout 76"... they kinda did it to themselves.
---
they are like the dumb asses that spell the wrong words in front of kids "hey lets play some f a l l o u t and DUPE some items\*wink\*..\*wink\*"
---
I believe the unruly golfers are a myth designed to torment people who obsess over completing quests.
---
Yeah I have no idea if that would have helped. I know things I have bought have been duped, but luckily I didn't have multiples of any
---
You get a cap when you drink nuka-cola, you should get a tin can after eating some dog food.
---
We need this Please bethesda!
---
You just can't beat the 'beetus.
---
I am dying about dupers duping themselves.... Just picturing 10k copied dupers with the trade emojis going
---
I really don't get this type of braging posts. I understand that you may not need it but aren't you even a little happy that you don't have to do Inventory Management as often? I swear every one that says they were happy with 400 are masochits who like nothing else to do but constantly empty their stash. I can live with a 200 stash but that doesn't mean i will enjoy having to constantly throw items away. I would unninstal the game in a heartbeat.
---
No. Not just that,but the challenges of today were 3/5 done already. How?
---
Ribeyes from heaven!  
---
They took err jerbs?
---
It still gives you a cap, but ya you should get a glass bottle too!
---
I agree with you, negativity kills, games are my religion. It’s how I contemplate life and death and my personal quest for transcendence. Fallout 1 was my first major game experience beyond a Nintendo console or the great older classics (Wolfenstein, doom, diablo 1 as the potion clicking sidekick). 
---
TY
---
When we get rolled on by forced workshop engagements by four guys with TSE's or can't even tag anything in nuke zones because of pay for dupe players it directly affects our experience. 
---
I think I've got a good case to present this weekend regarding moving to another game.
---
LOL I would believe you but I killed 9 of those bastards after the last patch. I just need 1 more! Just 1 more! AAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!
---
 [https://imgflip.com/i/2tmzrw](https://imgflip.com/i/2tmzrw) 
---
It's perfectly possible. It is just that complaining does nothing but give temporary satisfaction to someone for ranting their personal opinions and desires.  
---
For instance: I've enjoyed the game enough to spend hundreds of hours in it yet, there are a pretty good number of bugs and exploits I'm hoping are eradicated from the game - eventually.  
---
I don't spend my time complaining about it, BUT that doesn't mean I don't point things out at times. This could be to friends who aren't aware of something, in a post to the studio/community to bring awareness (or to corroborate another's experience), or simply to conversate about what could be improved in the game.  
---
Pointing-out a flaw does not equal complaining. It's how one does it that places it on the scale of either, a) Constructive criticism or, b) criticism; are completely different in both intention and delivery.  
---
At the end of the day it's each person's choice to be how they *choose* to be. This post is not intended to tell anyone how they "should" be, because "should" is simply a dogmatic term used to attempt to manipulate others to get another/others to conform to how a person, or organization, wishes a person(s) to be, for their own selfish desire(s). "Should" exists only where there has been an agreed-upon (by *all* parties) baseline of conduct.  
---
It's quite freeing to see things just as they are and to realize how much silliness so many other people put themselves through. Sit back, have a smile and a laugh - they'll never know ;)  
---
Sometimes there's foreshadowing. Probably best to be on guard.
---
Glass bottle was (mostly) useless in NV, but arguably much more useful in 4's survival.
---
I guess i reported inacurrately.   Sorry sbout that.
---
There's a v-vector that affects the oath of the projectiles.  However in vata this can be somewhat mitigated if you take a breather before shooting, just pause a second or two, and let the VATS "stabilize" for lack of a better term.
---
i have finally killed 8 of them these last 2 weeks. shit drove me nuts for nearly 3 months!
---
they’re there, although the “female” variants are a tad trickier to recognize in the golf skirt. the golf shirt is quite obvious at a distance.
---
I considered buying one to play around with during last nights duper super sales. Decided not to. Now I wish I had.
---
I'm trying to figure out what difference this is gonna make.. The damage is done. Everyone has a very rare weapon. Everyone has the same very rare weapons modded to top tier. What difference is it gonna make? Stopping the dupe should have been done a long time ago. Instead they nerf white knight and other competent relevant perks along with deterring any form of grind. I don't wanna try and level up anymore because it's not as often as I enjoyed. I'd log in an level up a few times a night before going to bed. That was fun and it felt like an accomplishment. There's no cap, why r they slowing the grind?? Why r they nerfing perks?? All I'm doing now when I log in is trying to clear my inventory followed by looking at how many springs and fiber I need to survive so I can what, get my hands on a stalkers pitchfork! Cool dude! I'll fight off the grief w that! I'm done. I'm going they drop something totally awesome soon cuz I'm upset that I spent 80 on a pre-order. I feel jipped, i am disenchanted. 
---
My bad, I read it wrong. Thanks for the clarification! 
---
Going to transfer some items I'm carrying on me due to hitting stash limit so I won't be borderline encumbered all the time 
---
After giving up on that quest for weeks, one day every fucking ghoul at whitespring was a goulfish one..
---
I didn’t leave, like I say all my disconnects happened within less than a few minutes of taking them.
---
I didn’t even get to do the first defend event on some of them!
---
 Not really, just asking questions. Since I was tagged with a 10 cap bounty while helping a guy, I have been very careful. ;)
---
FO4 did gave you a cap for each beer consumed.
---
Merging black holes produce gravity waves, so that could actually be fun. 
---
Oh wow. I didn't know that about the search lights. I don't have the home defense perk yet. That's good to know. 
---
But if you had one TSE of every gun in the game you're still good and not a duper.
---
Fallout 3.
---
From what I've heard the downtime/dupe cleaning today helped a lot with server stability so hopefully, that's gone.
---
Progress!!!! Very excited, thank you
---
Well said :)
---
It's (pretty much) always the ignorant and selfish ones that want to ruin the experience of others. Enjoyed your post and agree wholeheartedly.
---
You ain't got friends. 
---
I was just hoping to be rid of the full ass/cav/sentinal set god mode users.  No such luck. 
---
Dense chest armor mod and Fireproof perk will reduce the damage from those weapons significantly. One of the reasons I also dislike farming Whitespring nuke zones is because it's like a feeding frenzy. Like ravenous dogs fighting over scraps. It's not an enjoyable experience for me. I don't want to be the one stealing the kills, but I also don't want to be the one having kills stolen from me. It's a problem with the game design in some way I think.
---
I agree I wasn't accusing everyone who does that of duping but it certainly doesn't help the situation.
---
Holy crap this sub is becoming less toxic? Maybe I'll have to resubscribed in a couple months. Great post, OP. Great post.
---
Those are adorable xD
---
That’s what I did as well.
---
PC has it's share of griefers.  I'm met a couple personally in different sessions at different times but fridays and saturdays around 3am eastern time seems to be where i've met most of theses jerks.
---
Thank you - well said. I have a little over 400 hours in and issues aside, I am having a great time. It saddens me that the pair of friends I would consistently team with, have griped over lack of content, TSE and The Whitespring Nuke Zone XP nerfs. I wish they weren't so petty. The game is, as the cliché goes, greater than than the sum of it's parts. It is a vibrant world that invites you to explore, to find the places that aren't on the map, that contain the stories of those that survived the war but were overcome by the scorched. If one only aims at the base content, that is all one will get out of it. If one desires more, it can be found; the game just isn't going to spoon-feed it to you.
---
Two shot weapons have horrible vats accuracy even if they say 95%
---
If deleting is problematic, then let us sell them to the vendor for 0 caps. Gone is gone.
---
Ah, I see this sub is not completely de-toxed. Back to the filthies for me.
---
About time they did something right. Well done boys
---
Ideally they need to serialize all weapons issued, just a string of random numbers and alphabets should do. No two items should have the same number and as soon as one is copied, the original gets deleted from the system.  
---
I thought more then 1% would be affected. 
---
The 1% was people who had multiples of the same item. So they we're most likely the dupers not dupe users and they were removing all but 1 of those. So dupes still exist. No way 1% of users have or had a duped item.
---
Yes one in each perk is more efficient.
---
Laziness. It's hard to catch small scale duping. 
---
We do know that they did server-side work, we don’t know whether it was about this. 
---
But they said in their downtime announcement that they were working on disconnect issues server-side. Those same issues could have also helped with stability, especially if the lack of stability was the cause of disconnects they were fixing. 
---
I would love to know for sure, or if it’s really the lack of duped items making that much of an impact. 
---
I think it's less about not punishing those who bought duped, and more about the limitations of the system they had in place (or lack there of) to track items.  Instead they had to just focus on those with stockpiles.  The only thing they could use to remotely estimate duped items.
---
I was excited to read about the upcoming changes. And post patch my nice 3 star axe I recently bought is still in my inventory and my camp loaded faster than it ever has. 
---

---
 Which doesn't make it ok. But as they say in sports "anything the referee first see is legal"
---
I always dropped the candy. dunno if its changed, but It was not worth the weight.
---
&gt; **For once Bethesda actually applied their brain to a problem instead of blindly catering to what Redditors say** 
---
Ummm, we've been suggesting things and Bethesda has only implemented a couple of things (mostly no scrapping mods and known plans.) If they were "blindly catering" to us then this game would be so much better.
---
Whaaaat that's so cool! I never thought turrets could be so cute.
---
K
---
Hahahaha ok... there’s no zombies in This game soooo.. 
---
Is this a troll post or an actual salty duper got their toys taken away from them?
---
Nice job Beth.  Was really worried you were gonna f it all up.  Well done.
---
The root of the problem is dupers, so fix the bugs that allow duping in the first place.
---
Tall order, I know.
---
There’s been loads of unruly golfers in WS golf club the last week. I thought they had patched something to allow that quest to be completed finally. 
---
I don't need tips from you on how to counter build players with God tier dupe gear.
---
You guys can go ahead and have the game. Have fun.
---
Just had one of those runs when ghouls won't get alerted to your presence and they just lay down on the floor. Now i'm stuck in Caution, maybe i'm missing a ghoul... 
---
Sorry :(
---
I think they have processes in place now to detect and ban players that accumalate loot in abnormal or overly fast ways.
---
They hinted at it a month ish ago when they were banning dupers that they were monitoring inventories and had the ability to see the time frame in which you acquired said items, and if you were acquiring them faster than the game would normally allow you too it would flag your account.
---
If they dont, your right they are just smashing their face on the wall hoping to magically get beautiful.
---
I think that they are smarter than most people think. I think that they were intentionally vague in order to prevent people from splitting up stacks.
---
I can't tell if it's a satire or you're serious
---
Less than 1% across the three platforms needed to have their items removed? 
---
That’s a bit hard to believe. 
---
alot of great ideas in this thread, im all for anything that helps stabilize the servers to reduce disconnects!
---

Stash size is next week...still at 600 atm
---
Single item??? Seeing posts that people still have 5-10 3 star shotguns so maybe they only hit the players with 50 or 100...  
---
Every game developers favorite button.....right?
---
I am lvl 84, I don't mind teaming up with ppl. 
---
I'm shocked they did it well this time.
---
Either way its a terrible post. I almost hope its real as that would be better.
---
What stealth problems are you having? I have not had any problems with stealth at all in my 150 levels of the game.
---
Me and my friends have jobs and families.
---
You don't have a job or a family?
---
That may very well be the case. No one can code to account for every variant of cheating unfortunately.
---
Me neither
---
Chasing after the SBQ and fell into a fizzure I didn't see while looking up, I didn't die but barely made it out, was over encumbered, even with marsupial I couldn't jump high enough. Finally was able to get out. Fell back in the other day the same way, died instantly, RIP junk. 
---
OP is posting directly from the Bethesda troll farm. This is an employee, not a legitimate fan or probably even a player of the game. This is just some closeted shut in incel/femcel being paid to shit talk the community so other people will fall for the fo76 trap.
---
“Hur hur 50 hours Disney land give it time hur hur”
---
ha...haha........hahahahahahahahaaha!
---
Any chance demolition expert will be un-nerfed? Auto-GL is pretty useless now.
---
Grenades seem somehow less bouncy lately, so I'm not sure if it's a real fix or just my imagination but either way it's nice.
---
👍
---
Same.
---
Well there wasn't a patch today so I'm not sure why you seemed surprised.
---
I gave up..they are just running on a spot. Fixing a game that is too broken takes all the time that would have been left for actually adding content. It is a lost cause.
---
Its actually not a cover up, lol. He was already off the game when I got the one in the stack, which is why I went to someone else to buy the gun.
---
Most of those who are complaining are the dupers. I find it hilarious. I feel less sympathies for those who got SO impatient they spent real money for them. I got plenty of popcorn for when  they start whining about it.
---
How bad of a player are these people to need that many stimpacks. They are easy to find. I end up selling them all the time or just leaving them in cash registers at the train stations.
---
I've literally seen people do this and then kill the lower level players especially fighting the queen and in other places. I try and help them out even when it's not my fight and even drop them extra ammo if they need it.
---
&gt;spamming frowny faces
---
That's my strategy too! Frowns and confused faces. 😊 They usually just go away after a few minutes.
---
Just letting you know it's there. Idk why people complain so much. It's a game. If you are that butt hurt over something so inconsequential as a video game...maybe this one is not for you. How about Super Smash Brothers? The original, that way it doesn't have any bugs left to bother you. ;)
---
Well done Bethesda.  And lol @ all the white knight solo anti social non trading schmucks that showed thier ugly faces this week.
---
Hey...  you are right but they handled this well... if not two months late.
---
I like to collect power armor and have it on display. This would be awesome for me.  
---
A full suit of each kind, as well as examples of every possible paint job on display please.
---
You trollin' bro?
---
There is a mod for that. I love it.
---
Rolled out a patch today that reduced duped items down to a quantity of 1. 
---
Eat a sneakers, you get a little school girlish when you are hungry.
---
Imagine a sports league who did something similar in regards to steroid testing.
---
Only the biggest abusers get punished but the players who only inject a small amount of testosterone are okay......fuck you drug free guy!
---
I think the changes OP is talking about are because of this. A lot of problems in game seemed to be bc of server issues (at least that was the impression I got from the 1001 glitches video posted here a day ago).
---
He's casual AF and likely hasn't put near as many hours as many people here. "I like it when I play for my 2 hours a week so how *dare* people who actually play dislike the thing I like!" 
---
An hour ago I stumbled upon a lvl 1 wise moth man near death claw island. My first encounter of one. It was cute! Then it jumped for the sky and started literally sucking my healthbar, so my lvl 11 toon took a hatchet to it. Was a quick and noble death and I got to keep it’s egg. 
---
What are the unruly golfers 
---
Wow and their personal bank. They got a crafting mat tab now, but still, much more or at least the same limit as in FO76. 
---
That is why I had good faith to begin with... their parent company runs one of the big 3 MMO. I assumed they would get help, if needed.
---
I have nothing :(
---
As far as I can tell you can only repair it, there are no mods for the ax so once you repair it it removes itself from the bench list.  What I don't understand is I can repair all other weapons to 200% condition because of the perk except the Grognac Ax.  Glitch??
---
For all we know, a "server" could just be a virtual server and there could be several instances running on one server. One of the VS messes up it could impact the others?
---
&lt;&lt;!!!I am not a networking guy, pure speculation!!!&gt;&gt;
---
&gt;  but if you look at this with the idea you'll be playing it in 5 years still
---
This is such a monumentally silly way to think though, I paid good money for the game NOW - I didn't pay money for the game to be good in 5 years. If you have to tell yourself this to accept the BS Bethesda pushed out, you're nuts. 
---
Played 100's of hours and about 150 levels.  Have YET to see ANY TSE weapons.  Or any legendary worth crap.
---
Zetan teenagers trying to hit OP with the leftovers. It's hard to aim from that high up.
---
I'm up to 5 so far :/ 
---
I wish I was doing a troll to you but I am not and I am also very serious and aksibreal. I killed so much zombies for those guns and now I was stole from. 
---
Please tell us what you die to in sent assassin armor.  Instigating fat man? Not a scratch. Double barrel tse to the chest? Nope. Help! Were probably not even on the same platform. 
---
it was not fixed.
---
Explain? 
---
Yeah, I tried that. Even with my other 2 shot weapons (other toons) i give it a beat before I pull the trigger. Does not seem to be making a difference here.
---
check the ash heap vendors.
---
Yeah that's my point... I understand the no mods thing.... but  No reason with a level 5 weapons artisan perk then I can't improve the condition/durability
---
I know, but Beth why!!!!!!
---
"we did nothing and will continue to do nothing. Well maybe few ebay accounts got nerfed dunno idk"
---
I had some asshat start slapping me while I was doing a trade with a vendor. I had my mic on, made it VERY clear that I did not want to engage in PVP and the dumb fucker just kept slapping me. This has been happening a lot more lately than a few months ago. My lower level player can barely make it out of Flatwoods without some fucking troll starting a fight. It’s little more than annoying but it is SO fucking annoying. I shouldn’t have to wait through 15 minutes of loading screens every time I have to “server hop” to avoid a grieving prick. 
---
Just give us NON-PvP servers please, for the love of God. 
---
If you're on console, it's free with the system. It's also only a suggestion too.
---
From me? Well I'm the one when I find some Level 50 Bloodied Grognak Axe I give it to some level 20, so they have something to look forward to. I drop plans in paper bags. The other person takes what they need and then drops their duplicates. Then I give them a Junkies Explosive shotgun (before the nerf, before Fireproof) because I actually care about people and the game. You can think whatever you like about me, but I'm not using "OP duped items" to grief people or steal kills at Whitespring. I'm shooting level 1 Sorched on my Farm, and Powering up Poseidon with my OP level action rifle. Or if someone wants to try to take my 10 cap bounty, then they get a little taste of it too.
---
There really is nothing quite like seeing how excited and happy a new player is when they get a helping hand.  :-)
---
i think you missed one! it appears to me that they spawn as a couple. ive always found one in shirt and one in skirt! and they’re always in the same spawn cluster for me, too.
---
"Don't say things I don't want to hear"
---
ORRRRR maybe people can say what they want, including complaints, and you can NOT care so much? You can keep playing while enjoying yourself while simultaneously NOT complaining about people's opinions or trying to police their comments. 
---
I think they just wanted to get rid of all of the stacks of extra due to items that were still lying around not a bad idea.
---
It also sends the message that they could run a similar script at any time in the future if other dupe exploits pop up or even for any current dupe exploits that may still exist.
---
So what is to stop these guys from duping again?
---
Ah, I see. Yeah, if you aren't building for melee I'm sure it sucks. Every time I try to use a gun I learn how much the perks are needed. 
---
Road map is coming by the end of the month. We will know then. 
---
It's a broken item ON PURPOSE. It's the only weapon that does this. This isn't new.    
---
It's a good way to show how smart some of the players are and how others are not. Since it does this and then others go and do it to 'test' it and then whine when they lose all their ammo it's their fault.
---
there has been nothing more about them since they were mentioned as something they eventually wanted to do.
---
No idea but I got a ts hunting rifle and was really sad it had no accuracy in vats
---
You assume a lot, and you're vulgar. It makes you very unpleasant to converse with.
---
FWIW: The one weapon I've purchased is still in my inventory, from which I conclude that — as I had inferred — it wasn't duped.
---
And yet it's frustratingly common, destiny and battletech both seem to use ordered lists or something that goes to cap after a hundred or so items.
---
well gotdammit i only counted 23 fries, last time i got 25!!!!! wth!&gt;!&gt;!&gt;  OUTRAGE INTENSIFIES!!!!!!! 
---
I hope we do. It will let me know where your base is to trash
---
5-10 identical shotguns?  If they are different in any way they would not have been removed 
---
I'm not disputing any of that, but that doesn't change the fact that deleting is in fact the easiest fix and upsets fewer people.  The way they went about it had virtually zero false positives as well.  That's the only argument I'm making - that it's easier.
---
For the record, I've played plenty of looter action games and understand the premise quite well, but it almost always is accompanied by new content and expanded leveling to go with it which is my point.  That's not a quick or easy fix to the immediate problem of dupes.
---
Seriously. I don't even try to cripple their wings anymore. I just find an open area of ground, pull out a melee weapon and wait. Ignoring their attacks. Surprisingly, they land more quickly when I do *that* than when I sit there and shoot off their wings.
---
&gt; It is fine to be upset at a game, but what OP is getting at, and I agree with, is you are fighting a war we don't give a shit about. Fight your war with your wallet. Don't buy the game. But quit trying to shit in our cereal bowl because YOU don't like it. You want us to quit with you so Bethesda gets the message. Fuck that. leave me alone!
---
Quit trying to tell everyone their shit cereal is delicious just because you don't mind the taste. Fuck that. Leave them alone. 
---
Don't say the z word. 
---
Sometimes when I switch from rifle to super sledge my character will hold the super sledge like a gun briefly. Ha. 
---
I have been blessed by the mothman  and got to encounter his presence several times. If found worthy, it would please me to be considered a follower of mothman .
---
What kind of printer do you have/recommend?
---
This is cool!
---
You say, as you are hateful to people who say things you don't like. 
---
Complain about a random subset of people who may or may not actually be complaining... Profit. 
---
They're basically slow-flying Night Fury's from "*How to Train Your Dragon*".
---
You should sell it, you could...
---
/sunglasses
---
...make some good dough.
---
\[daltry\]
---
Hey man no need to apologize. It's a game and I don't feel like your opinion was rude.
---
In fact the worst message I got was someone calling me a duper because I traded up.
---
I'm not frustrated I'm disappointed. 
---
Do give Bethesda credit for the MMO attempt and I think the game is easily a 6/10 for the parts that work well.
---
I just hate that they're going after the players rather than killing each other and fixing the obvious things.
---
They let the duping go on for months and the chinese sellers of items have it down to a science still you can find items on sale and even new AAE weapons, guarantee you its duped with the god rolls they have
---
The solution to the ruined economy wasn't duping removal it was making sure people can grind and get it.
---
I'd be happy to run a cave 100x if I even get anything guaranteed from a 3 \* legendary.
---
The questing in this game is absolutely the biggest hit or miss, full of disappointment
---
Few quests are so good and others (I'm talking main ones here) feel like filler and are boring.
---
Holotapes are great, except when they didn't play on pick up. 
---
Environmental story telling is awesome in this game but a real miss when it comes to unique Boss fights.
---
Before the game came out I thought I would gang up with strangers to kill all kinds of insane creatures.
---
This is an example of another missed opportunity
---
Unique weapons that are worth the grind endgame.
---
It's just two items really. All Rise and the maybe the somerset special.
---
They really couldn't bother giving us an Instigating shotgun or something with a unique skin?
---
Fallout 4 had tons of unique
---
Hell shut the servers off for a month, bring back a solid game.
---
In my opinion, we're at the stage where 90% of people have moved on.
---
Also you should get a free pony.
---
So, I waited for it.. and here’s the results..
---
Everyone huh? 
---
Three whole missiles. 
---
But how will maintain a collection of items each worth 1 cap, but otherwise useless, that I can sell to vendors to make their cap pool go from 0 to 199? Not my precious bobby pins!
---
Bugs the hell out of me, too... but there's obviously more important issues for them to tackle, lol.
---
Also, it would be cool if these 2 handed weapons were then affected by one handed perk cards in PA... but that's just a fantasy.
---
It's not that they can't it's that there are millions if not billions of logs to go through
---
Dey derk a durrr!
---
This is the new world we live in. Cry baby snowflakes that complain about peoples opinions they don't like on a subreddit. It's sad
---
After 3 months of duping this is the best solution. Apart from raising level cap to 55-60 ofc. I didn't think i'll say it but good work Beth. I expected a major shitshow and it didn't happen. Only one question remains now: what the hell am i supposed to do with all that popcorn now? Huh? xD
---
Thanks. I thought my feelings on the patches were the general consensus of people who actually played at launch up to this point. Bethesda could really make the game better, but they seem to keep making it worse in the name of "balance". And I'm no two-shot explosive lover, I never even got one, I just hate how melee is taking over the game as the only viable way to play without being horribly inconvenienced by weapon durability and ammo and then it too will be nerfed.
---
I am not saktybduper but I am salty at Bethesda because their stole my guns you would be mad to if you got them stole from you for no reason at Sall 
---
Right on! That's pretty awesome not only making this but sharing the plans as well! 
---
+1
---
Last time it happened to me a few days ago it was in the same position as your screenshot, on the "o" in welcome.
---
Wow they fixed something that never should have been an issue in the first place months after release.. GG
---
Maybe try equipping crack shot perk?  See if it helps?  I use it sometimes, and maybe it's confirmation bias, but I feel as if it helps...
---
May have something to do with it being a ported weapon coded from Skyrim...
---
I am really relieved to find out I still have it which means the guy that gave it to me  gained it legitimately making it even nicer he gave it to me.
---
*ghouls
---
My opinion wrong, everyone eles is just toxic and I hate them for saying things I don't agree with!! 
---
I'm a solo player so at the end of the day it doesn't change my gameplay much. I'd just like to find a rare weapon and not find on Reddit that 1,000 people already have it and have already figured out the best build for it. It's like someone spoiling a movie for you....it eliminates the fun of a Fallout title.
---
I would argue that if earning your gear through RNG...... maybe this one isn't for you. You could try Fortnite but you actually need skills to win at that game....no duped gear to cheese it with.
---
I haven't been on any trading subs but are they only PC players or Xbox too because I'm an Xbox player. 
---
In some MMOs it is considered "kill stealing". That guy who ran off maybe though that mob was "yours" and didn't want to kill steal? Maybe? Kinda sorta? I dunno.....
---
Yes.  This my therapy.
---
Try ebay •_•
---
IDK...fear of god? Maybe worried they'll get their hands slapped again?
---
If it worked, it would increase damage to scorched and the queen, and also only accept ultracite cores. Jokes aside, since it doesn't work nothing happens.
---
It's a bug.  But there is a workaround:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alc5xx/how_to_use_assaultron_head_more_than_one_time/
---
Even fixed, it's still garbage.  And a fully charged proper shot gives you +49 rads.
---
You put your keys on a keyring, and your holotapes on a holo deck.
---
We could also have a clipboard to put notes on.
---
I’ll be your huckleberry. 
---
What’s it going up to?
---
Call the Waaaaaaaaaaaambulance!
---
Why else would i go to whitesprings?
---
I love lamp
---
being constantly in caution when nobody is around. it's a known bug. my main account isn't stealth but my alt is and he has been shelved for a while due to the bug and putting early points into stealth
---
boo
---
This Inside the vault made me recover the faith a little, it was just what I wanted to hear.
---
imagine being this delusional lol, that heart too - peak smugassholery right there
---
IF Bethesda actually had a weight limit to begin with and didn't leave it open so some players could way a million pounds this all wouldn't have happened... 
---
Melee in power armor is still the only viable build then? Another month of not playing, I'll check back in with the next patch.
---
Yeah, problem is that most everyone with 1 copy of their weapon got to keep them. Even if you had a stack, you still get to keep 1 so count yourself lucky.
---
Or 30 Bobby pins?
---
Decisions, decisions....
---
Creating Montag the *Fahrenheit 451* fire fighter alt now.  All those lovely burned books shall be mine now.   
---
Feature request: Burned Book display case. 
---
This is not fair for legit players
---
Under his eye.
---
A keyring thats basically the same as in fallout 3 and new vegas, a separate menu within the misc tab so your misc tab isnt cluttered. The same thing can he applied to holotapes listed alphabetically or by series
---
I can't wait!!    
---
The dupers and those who were STUPID enough to spend real money for in-game items which is against the TSE.......this will be entertaining. I stocked up on popcorn for this.
---
Almost certainly ammo.
---
I’m planning on being somewhat of an ammo vendor to other players given I have the ammosmith and super duper perks.
---
I could imagine, once they get the duping under control for good (as far as they know), they might increase the weapon/armor level cap. That would be the final nail in the coffin for the duplicated items being trade commodities. 
---
Well, the 20 or so corks lined up on the top of my stove remind me of all the damage I've done to my liver, so there's that.
---
Those items aren't stored in a database they are stored in the copy of the game world on your client. The sever stores of they were removed. It's why shit changes when you log into an area with a lot of crap
---
Yeah like Corsair CUE.. there could be a hub where you can browse other people's submissions and buy them there, book mark your favorite Appalachian Architect, have a featured Architect of the week, voting system, etc. Also maybe make some "preferred" blueprints for zones like this print is best for part land/water, this stilted home for Savage divide where it is very rocky and so on..
---
Well I am glad then I don't live in Nazi-Land.  :-p
---
I get stuck in caution sometimes but it doesnt effect my stealth in anyway
---
There shouldn't have been hysteria.  We have, as a community, been demanding this for months.
---
Or a journal
---
They removed all weps except 1 each (if u have 3 of the same they remove 2) for example
---
That would be ideal
---
Thats wassup!
---
Probably weapons with great perks/attributes that currently are badly out of balance (and therefore nearly worthless), in hopes that they'll be re-balanced into use. Example: Two-shot laser rifle.
---
Look again.  That popcorn was duplicated and summarily removed.  Now you just have empty bags that smell like butter.  Hmmmm butter.
---
People will literally give you the armor off their backs. You can repair your weapons or replace them. The server issues are on Bethesda but not being able to play the game well is your fault. 
---
If you need help ask or Google don't blame the dev or my uncle Todd. 
---
Any other countries you'd like to cite, or are you going with the "one example out of hundreds" argument?
---
so post duping, i did not loose anything BUT a bloody dragon i found on a train station trash can was probably duped.  obviously i only had one so it wasn't touched by bethesda scripts but i noticed it went off my hotkey so it seems it was molested in some shape or form.  basically lost nothing(sigh of relief).  
---
my concern going forward is this, spring cleaning was a one time script to clean up large duplicates.  it certaintly isnt an active scanning of any kind.  im concerned this will just pause the dupers as they can just spend time and recreate all those super gear.  hopefully im wrong.
---
Yet. Again. Digital content is different from physical property. Bethesda completely controls the means of production and distribution. Your argument is nonsensical. 
---
Isn't it obvious? With Plague Walker. Give me 24 hours and unlimited stimpaks and I'll get the job done.
---
Hells yeah
---
Only on about 400 accounts though, likely the ones that had dupes in the 10s or 100s
---
"I'm only level 50 and I don't understand why people who have much much much much much more experience than me with this game dislike it! Clearly I'm a pro and my level 50 experience outweighs theirs so my opinion is the only valid one, I HATE those other people who say things I don't want to see"
---
My guess is they left it deliberately vague to make it seem that a fire sale/massive distribution of the duped stacks would be completely pointless.
---
Actually impressed.
---
This was probably the best possible fix, reducing stacks of items to one is probably the easiest way to remove duped items, while still letting people keep their favorite weapons that they may or may not have known were duped.
---
Agreed. The RNG is definately against us on Fallout for sure. Fortnite... eh, idk about skills. I took down a streamer by gas bombing him inside of his little walled hut while he was healing. Second week playing and had zero kills at that point because I was bush camping. It pissed him off so much he messaged me on xbox and called me a trash player (which I was), but that shows no need for skill. I still can't build to this day and win a couple games a week.
---
I would then need to scrap your clipboard for springs. 🙂
---
In Germany If you bought Stolen stuff you handle against the law Cut U should have known the stuff ist stolen
---
I think I just had a stroke.
---
"Multiple copies". But most people who have top tier items from trading do possess duped items. They didn't remove all duped items from the game. So it seems like it was you people who were spreading the false rumors and fearmongering.
---
Careful friend, just remember, social fails videos on YouTube. 
---
So far it seems to have been handled well.
---
THAT’S RIGHT, BEH BEH.
---
BRING ON THE IRONIC DOWNVOTES.
---
Not from a hypocrite like you
---
what happened I feel was that many people thought they would just delete everything that was ever duped. and many people low key purchased weapons outside of fallout with real world money. but now that we know it targeted people with millions of bobbleheads and millions of the same overpowered weapons but left the people that already payed money for items items alone, I think they are just relieved they didn't waste their money... well waste their money even more than they already did from buying this game anyway.
---
I see you fell for my honeypot; enjoy your ban. 
---
hahahaha
---
Yeah I made a post about this before, "Savour the little things", despite taking a bit of damage, I love smacking one car watching as the single explosion cascades into a fiery cloud of molten metal. Plus you can kill enemies this way! 
---
If you say things they don't like, they will literally call YOU toxic while calling you "embarrassing human waste"
---
"I don't like this game"
---
"I hate you, your opinion is wrong even though you have far more experience with it, it's toxic oh and you're embarrassing human waste. Gosh quit being so toxic talking bad about the game"
---
Word. In no way, did I expect such a good solution. They restored a bit of my faith in them.
---
Everyone was anticipating disaster, and for good reason. If you have seen Bethesda's patch track record, everyone was sure it was gonna be bad. But it wasn't, this patch was a complete success and took everyone by surprise. Heres to continued success from Bethesda! 
---
If I may offer some unrelated perspective.  I'm a network guy. Let's say I have 50 tb of storage space.  Let's say it is 95% full, so i look at it.  Suppose I have 1000 users.  I find that 25 users out of that 1000 are collectively using 43tb of space.  I have a problem with a very small amount of users but they are disproportionately affecting everyone else.  
---
I believe this is somewhat analogous to Bethesda's issues with duped items.
---
P.s.  I changed some numbers but I'm dealing with this exact situation in real life.  :)
---
The best is blowing them up when people are standing near them.
---
They were all 2 shot exploding stacked like (10) so I am assuming they were all the same along with 3 star Grog....(spelling) axe stack of 14... I'm seeing comments that people still have more than 1 all over and some they didn't touch.   
---
Person posted a pic of having 3700+ nuka colas... so I'm just wondering what the limit they set for searches...
---
This is why i'm all hesitant about this step, it doesnt do anything to stop the duping. If anything they might do it again.
---
I agree and look forward to determining if their attempt to correct disconnects is equally successful. If so I may finally do my nuke solo run and finish the quest.
---
Nothing wrong with that. Just do your thing and enjoy life.
---
My only point was that not everyone has a squad to play with. I'm okay with online play but game developers need to make a balance for solo play. This game is already brutal on a solo player because most mobs are designed for squads...... it's totally unfair that a squad of 4 players could essentially get 4 drops for every legendary they kill if they dupe their drops.
---
They could introduce a gift emote in the atom store and I would buy it.   Bethesda, are you listening?  /u/Ladydevann  would you forward this to the appropriate party?  It comes up a looooot.   Need gift emote.  Get that into the Atom store, stat!  ;)
---
I got a 3 star legendary rolling pin! haha! Haven't seen any exploding ones myself at all drop, 2 shot, yes, exploding no...
---
I find the 1% to be the thing I cannot believe....
---
what weapons are u using? if it is a rifle..add rifle perks, melee..add one handed or two-handed perks..and so on
---
THEY TOOK DER JERBS!!!
---
Someone reported the SBQ is flying out of bounds and not returning again...
---
Here are some weapons that, with the right perks / effects / mutations / chems gets the job done:
---
* Bloodied melee weapon combined with low-health perks / gear
---
* Furious handmade (explosive not necessary)
---
* Auto Grenade Launcher
---
* Explosive Plasma Gatling gun (mine has the Surpressor's effect)
---
Each one of these weapons can take off significant chunks of the SBQ's health with the right build.
---
Did they say 400 accounts somewhere or is that just your math on 1% of the player base?
---
I was perfectly happy in my ignorance :(
---
To further belabor my example. It’s Bethesda’s open-air market. The sales are performed on Bethesda’s POS system. The goods and the cash used in the transaction are Bethesda’s. 
---
Not true. I have 3 tse double barrels and 2 bloodied power fists with the same stats, I still have them, got them all from trades tho. Seems like they only targeted dupers
---
Yeah, skins would be cool. If it works for Division...
---
Fact is, there is literally only one viable build, melee in power armor. Guns break way to fast, damage is abysmal, and you can't play outside power armor as armor also breaks way to fast and white Knight was gutted. On top of that, the last patch doubled food and drink consumption amongst other bugs. The track record of pushing a patch out to fix 1 thing, to break 4 has lost many many players confidence. Could care less about votes but this is the second patch I will avoid playing on. I'll check back in next month.
---
I'm going to go with my rule: you can criticize fallout 76 whether or not you have played it. You can also praise it along the same lines (even though you'd be wrong). What a concept
---
Consistently poor grammar in post and comments, previous reddit history consists of no comments and two deleted posts, one apparently selling duped items...still not sure if a troll or just really dumb.
---
Basically you had 1-4 people duping. One player sells there item(legendaries weapon or armor) and backs out. Then all other friends access a different vendor screen at the exact same time. This allowed all players to essentially “buy” the weapon, however since all players accessed the vendor at the same time they could all buy the same legendary. This turned 1 legendary into 4 and 4 into 16, etc, etc. the only downside was having to spend a lot of caps, but it all depended on what the game considered it’s price as.
---
TIL that this has been reposted 10 times.
---
Under His eye.
---
This is a great idea and probably easier for them to implement than allowing decorating with individual items that can't be looted.
---
Thanks for this. Definitely going to need to respec away from rifleman after this (provided the TSE lever i traded for is duped)
---
Well crap, if you like the game you do and if you don't you don't.
---
This doesn't mean anything though, you can still like the game and not play it because it sucks or what ever reason you stopped playing and you can dislike the game and play it still everyday.
---
People like to make the assumption that because you dislike something you should just quit. How many of us would have quit our jobs by now? Let's admit it, liking or disliking something has nothing to do with still doing/playing the task at hand.
---
Sorry, but I have no freaking clue, where you are coming from.
---
This game has no coherency. So whatever you may find fun like shooting mutants is not even coherent in itself, cause the game could not decide on a coherent gamedesign. Whatever your cup of tea might be, there is no reason to play this over another game, which actually has coherent gamedesign towards the attraction, which you enjoy.
---
Not to mention the wrong advertisement, which promised a bit more than shooting mutants.
---
And how would we even know, whether Bethesda tries to fix the game? Last time I checked, they were a triple A developer. Clearly they have the resources to fix FO76, if they wanted to. But looking at the past months I think this game is in maintenance mode. I cannot fathom how anyone could think otherwise, believing this game will be developed actively further. 
---
ahhh..gotcha..wont be able to log in until later tonight
---
Buy it(snaps fingers twice) 
---
My max level All Rise has significantly higher damage output then my other similar two-handed weapons. I like it but it seems odd.
---
much thanks!
---
Sorry, I’ll edit. In bed with a fever so to be correct, the 400 refers to:
---
These actions were highly-focused toward a list of over 400 weapon and armor items we identified as common duplication targets. 
---
Setting up prices BEFORE would be pretty awesome as well! Or have a sell column in the trade window of items you would sell... 
---
buy it, enjoy it, don't buy the hate.
---
That's a lot better, yeah.
---
800
---
Ya real frustrating man! 
---
The backlash would still be just as bad against the game, it isn't New Vegas 2.
---
Makes sense. Cheers
---
make sure you take a nap to get the xp bonus "well rested"
---
Unfortunately I’ve had exactly the same issue today, so I’m not sure.
---
I’ll see how things go over the next few days, and keep my fingers crossed that the disconnect today was a random one off this time.
---
Stop being so dramatic jfc. 
---
*PvE?
---
That would be awesome! I've seen some really badass houses and layouts in general. There are some skilled builders who could make a good in-game living doing this.
---
Lol I completely misread the tone of your post. But I was joking. My job sucks but I love my partner so :)
---
Truth hurts, doesn't it?  Some of us will NEVER forget that that entire nation went along with that particular brand of madness.  It wasn't some small cabal of 1%ers, it was all of the people as a whole.  And I will never let them pretend otherwise.
---
I have a TSE dragon level 45, how much you looking to spend?
---
Exactly, why should she stay in an abusive relationship.  
---
Yeah no I get that a lot haha. I have a thousand hours played. Always use well rested bonus and inspirational level 3. 
---
What are some things you enjoy?
---
Ahh I understand. Hope you feel better soon!
---
You seem confused. Just about everyone I have seen at end game has duped items. Two-Shot Explosive this or that. Your claim that 1% of people were affected doesn't change that fact. I have items I'm pretty sure are duped still in my inventory. Many peoples duped items are still in their inventories. Don't know what point you're trying to make. Maybe I used the wrong word. I should have said "Almost everyone".
---
And then the server crashes as it dumps hundreds of notes into your inventory.
---
He's licking so intensely that the enzymes of his saliva are starting to digest the boot itself.
---
Apparently they'll file in here and downvote mob posts they don't like too
---
But I don't mind; salt is the spice of life
---
I've seen a few post they still had (5) and (10) stacked of weapons in question and hundreds of Nuka Colas so they must have targeted those with hundreds of weapons and thousands of colas...
---
A Nuka Cola dispenser that you have to top up with purified water, Nuka cola syrup and empty Nuka cola bottles
---
Purified water and Nuka cola syrup would be the fuel and you would get a full Nuka Cola for each empty bottle + 1 cap that you invested
---
Thanks, day 3 man flu level 67
---
Omg! That explains why I use to be able to use any vendor screen but now some say in use. 
---
it had to be done dude. some people have a Tse completely legit. the problem wasn't the weapons. it was the people with millions of bobbleheads and magazines in their inventory and the fact they stack. this dupe purge wasn't even targeted at the weapons and armor and stuff it was meant for the bobbleheads and mags. this should make game play much more balanced. not perfect of course but better without punishing the majority of legit players just because of few cheaters.
---
Well, on this issue, they most likely didn’t know about the methods to dupe items until players figured it out. But they should have built a system to deal with the possibility, since duping is a pernicious problem with any online game. 
---
A great story that is delivered with surprising nuance, which allows you to laugh nukes to fight high level enemies with the whole server
---
This game is trash. Only basic people enjoy this for longer then a month 
---
Ok, so now I've watched a video on this that was five minutes long... https://youtu.be/gxGvlqzfClU and then a 21 second clip of Picard saying it.  I may now be able to at least fool people into thinking I should be on their friends list
---
I run around the robots occasionally.  I don't think I've ever seen anything 1* or above in the town itself.  Just regular no star legendaries.
---
Nope, just saw a stack of (10) TSE combats in a pic... so maybe they targeted certain people?? Not sure
---
I think if reddit subs sort of like 'car enthusiasts' sites.  Only a very small percentage of people are represented...but those that are have very strong opinions, etc...
---
Cursed by the RNG Gods? I've had the same experience as you, but I have only tried it a couple times.
---
This was a good way to deal with everybody who was affected through trading. You cant see that because you've probably passed on some great deals over at the trading market. But seriously, if you feel like you've wasted time, stop whining and quit.
---
Well they don't completely control it, and that's the problem. These items are being manufactured illegitimately, therefore they shouldn't exist and Bethesda has the right to take them. 
---
The quests, the CAMP building, the occasionally playing with friends. The ability to grind XP or Caps or Legendary items mixed in with the slow stroll across the map. If you want to play 8 hours a day for 3 months straight you'll run out of things to do, but I've got over 350 hours in and I'm still finding stuff to do.
---
Seriously. When I saw how trade worked my first thought was "*why can't I set these up in advanced? You want me to go through and set a price every time I talk to someone for everything I'm offering them?*"
---
Lmao that the people reveling in potential duper tears, are now drowning in their own. Dupers, duping, duped, 1% gtfo with this issue already. 
---
I dunno is confussing
---
Could you hook another chick up and tell me exactly where on the map it is?
---
I love “tucked away” places, and weirdly hate the way the bottom of roofs look. I also don’t like having to fight off anything other than supermutants. Your place looks perfect.
---
Have you seen how scary you are?  Maybe they think they have chameleon?
---
I will be home in about an hour to check out my stash, but based on what others are telling me, I am golden.
---
Well done Bethesda.
---
"They took our NPCs!"
---
There is little or no incentive to trade in this game other than for rare and hard to obtain items such as mods, plans, and legendary weapons and armor. As a result, "all trades" or even many purchases from vendors that many or most have is have ever done were for such desirable items. I don't trade or purchase junk, conventional items, or ammo that can be found for free on the world.
---
You got it..
---
They said they can't track illegitimate items, so they wrote a script to hunt for large amounts of items. Since it's impossible to know if an item was originally legitimate, they went with caution
---
I always check the cooler, still waiting to hit the jackpot
---
It often depends on your timing, as there's periods where nearly every bot there is a legendary.  I think they tend to spike after events.
---
OP you’re my hero. I have to explain psycho and jet combined yelling to “fuuuuuuuuuuuucking keeeeeeeeeeeeeellllllllll” to my friends that play 76 but never bothered with the others
---
Love things like this. 
---
I had a level 73 player come up to me when I was lvl 8 doing an event. He helped me kill some pretty hard scorched for me at the time, and followed me around helping me with my missions for a bit! Eventually, after a fewminutes of hanging out he sent me a team invite and we chilled together emoting back and forth while playing together. Eventually, I had to eat some food and scrap my junk, so I headed back home. He followed me home, built a Power Armour station for me, and hung a few posters. I have the posters still. He never got on mic, never introducted himself, never added me. Just a friendly neighborhood lvl 73.
---
One thing I've loved about Fallout since I've got it: The friendly high level players. You guys rock.
---
The story is one of the huge negatives I heard about, isn't it basically just listening to Holotapes?
---
Top floor of Emergency Services and Civic Center 
---
Ah, I never knew that. I always played a non-alcoholic in Bethesda games.
---
I still see at least one every other day. If you want to go the extra mile to find out you can join a discord group where they announce the SBQ nuke launches.
---
see I disagree with this. I feel fallout 4 was completely different from new Vegas and it was received rather well by the masses. I don't think people are demanding new Vegas 2 per say. I think people would be satisfied with a game similar to new Vegas but not exactly the same. lets hope that new obsidian game fills that craving.
---
brilliant idea plz bethesda 
---
I collect them to sell to vendors to balance out. Sometimes I don’t have enough stuff to sell (I like cleaning out vendors of all 200 caps as part of my routine grind).  
---
They sell for 1 cap each so you can make a pretty good amount of caps on something most people view as useless. Or you can use them to eek out the last few caps from a vendor.
---
First You only get punished for buying stolen property if you have some indication that it was indeed stolen. Second, the removal of duped items was going to be a catch 22 regardless of how it was exicuted, lots of people traded good caps or cash for that gear and just deleting everything would have left some players with little to nothing. Hope instead that some future balance changes makes the duped items lower tier then what they are now and this is only a temporary issue
---
Steel, Lead Aluminium, adhesive, springs &amp; screws are my go to. The .50 cal is a hungry beast
---
Well didn't work out so well for you did it... They let me keep 1 of each item so I can dupe them all over again :-)
---
Yeah it was a more “moral” duping where you actually had to spend money to get more.
---
I was in the same boat, a lvl 160 was hanging out and helping me kill goals in white springs and gave me a TSE hand made, I had similar thoughts to yours.
---
A increased cap limit would definitely help for selling some of the more ridiculously rare items like the Western Outfits or the Gilded Minigun, since those items and more are so rare that even 25,000 caps is too low for them
---
My level 7 alt met a griefer just the other day.  A pair of them using a supply drop bug (the quest shows up as mine even though it wasn't my quest) as an excuse to make people wanted and kill them the moment they mistakenly pick the supply drop lock.  I learned, but what a shitty thing to do to low level players.  It pissed me off so much, not about the junk they took from the bag I dropped because I could easily replace all of it, but the fact they were doing it to anyone especially low levels.   So, I did what any normal fully adjusted functional adult would do and turn the other cheek and run to the top of a near by building to verify that they were indeed camping that area waiting for people to use that same supply drop.  When I was satisfied that it wasn't a fluke, I logged in as my other character, fast traveled in, chameleon armor on my leg making me hard to see in the weeds and proceeded to shoot them in the face with a suppressed handmade from many different angles and vantage points until I eventually got a little too close.   One time when they were running by me, I even threw a orbital strike at them.  Sure, none of that killed them because I didn't initiate PvP properly, but they were looking all over for me.  When they finally found my low level alt, I just disconnected him in front of their face and then shot them in the face with my higher level character again just to show them that I hadn't gone anywhere.  ;)   
---
I've come by a lot of just fine / great players.  I've dropped tons of plans and any spare ammo that I had for anyone I come across.   Low levels get some extra food and drink as well.   A wave, a heart or what ever response they feel like giving and I wave back and take off.  It's great.   On the other hand, I wish I could have done more to those two griefers than just kill them if I had properly initiated PvP.   Taking out level 7s because the supply drop that showed up in their quests and on their map as theirs by bug is gross.  Taking their caps and their stuff is just rotten.    
---
it was in FO4, was it coded and brought to that game first?
---
Valley Galleria is my fav spot for this
---
That's the plan.
---
You guys won, enjoy your arcade shooter.
---
That was what I thinking about 5 mins ago without seeing your reply 😂👍
---
for me it’s become a habit, doesnt matter what i’m doing, if there’s a car with the paint coat still intact i will blow it up sooner or later
---
RNG isn't against us though. there is something like 100 weapons, 15 major legendaries, 12 second slot, and 12 third slot.
---
100 * 15 * 12 * 12 = 216,000
---
You have over 200,000 possible drop combinations and that doesn't even factor in the small probability that a 3* even drops a 3*. Duping has mislead the mathematically challenged into believing that end game weapons are supposed to be common.
---
I really don't know what people expected from a Fallout title........ it's a loot grind you can't get everything you want in a month.
---
There was no weapon condition for FO4 though, so that part is new.
---
And I, for one, definitely believe everything that gets posted. 
---
A lot of people seem happy with this patch, but I'm surprised nobody's pointing out the obvious.
---
With this patch, dupers officially got away with it. They keep any items they copied, just not tons of extra copies. They keep all the caps they made by breaking the game and profiting from it.
---
Buyers may be relieved not to lose their TSE or similar guns, but the big picture still has TSE nerfed into oblivion because it was too common to be allowed to stay so powerful while being so common.  The world will always remain flooded with duped items that skew how the game was supposed to be.
---
Out of all of this, who gets the most screwed?
---
**New players** do, because they never had a chance to purchase duped goods when the getting was good.
---
Yeah, that'll be good for the longevity of the game.
---
Wouldn’t that make it your one dupe to keep? If not, time to go grind like the 99%
---
Some of the dupe methods I believe existed in fallout 4 - maybe not all of them were as public because it was single player, but there is no excuse to carry over essentially all of the same bugs into a multi-player environment. This is a good step, but a late step after the game has lost a good chunk of player base already - meanwhile new games coming out are taking away players and attention - I've moved into full Apex legends mode and will grab metro exodus and anthem this month.
---
Honestly, that'll probably happen at first but die down over time. Trolls ain't that dedicated, they move on quickly.
---
I'd rather not, we're good without you.
---
No its a tedious process it takes me about three to four run-throughs to get a 3* and then he will only drop a 1* it takes a lot to get a three star then it could be what I got after an hour of farming it 3* stalkers assault rifle 50% reduced dmg while aiming and faster fire rate not bad but definitely not a great roll. 
---
sounds like dupers weren't even punished. instead of 20 legendaries obtained by duping they only have 1.
---
Supplies are all over... what are you looking for and I'll tell you were to farm them... for example plastic... pumpkins from High School will get you at least 90+ plastic...   
---
Let me know if you need better armor, I can build you some Combat Armor or Marine if you have supplies or help you if you don't have enough... 
---
So they should have just given up? Not sure what you're bitching about
---
Nothing, I'm just glad I can walk again
---
Not as of right now. You might be able to find someone to sell you theirs. 
---
I don't understand. Do you want people who spent months playing the game to have nothing just because they invested in top tier items?
---
So a burned book is worth 1/3 of a pipe pistol? Makes perfect sense!
---
Sounds better than the lvl 50 beserker rolling pins I keep getting. Hits for a pretty serious 50 damage. 60 if you walk around half dead. 
---
&gt;you still get to keep 1
---
# but his zombie dropped 15!!
---
Ohhh, neat. I thought they had said previously that they couldn't do that though...
---
YOU DON'T KNOW MY LIFE!!!
---
There is already a thread freaking out about it and it hasn't even happened yet. A lot of people with duped gear I'm betting who thought they slipped through and are noe shitting bricks because they either traded for it or were given it.
---
Oh I totally get the mathematically probability, I'm just bummed that a 3star legendary doesn't always drop a 3star random something. Really annoying, but hey, that's why we grind 8 hours a day right?
---
You can lightly sand it and use filler to smooth out the curves but is you really want the print at higher quality you can just have a service like Shapeways print it and send it to you. 
---
I'm sorry to bother you.  Did you happen to find out if they knew about this/are now made aware of this?
---
I know what you mean, I was playing in white springs after a nuke hit it. This lvl 185 was surround by  a lot of the greenies out of the club house. I was trying to help him out  and I guess we hit each other. Next thing i know I am in PVP mode he kills me and takes all my Junk.  I mean come on Man kill me if you want the 10 caps, but why take my stuff???
---
Sure, which one you're looking for, Alduin, Mirmulnhir, Paarthurnax ?
---
If you like the expression and combat of fallout 4, you will enjoy it. If you liked the direct influence you have on the world like new vegas, you probably won't. 
---
DAMN I missed this sale :(
---
Looked for you online all night on PC, too.
---
No, we're good without you.
---
Love it!!
---
You wont be missed

But that's the rub isn't it?  The people of that nation were inexcusably guilty and try to pretend they have changed...  When they haven't.  And the OP is just an example of their national character.
---
It's called entitlement, and it is rampant here. I get complaining about bugs, but ffs either be patient or move on. We don't need to hear about a game most of us still enjoy is terrible for some.
---
OK, I actually read all of this. Eventually.
---
There's no TL;DR.
---
The reason there isn't one is because there's no actual POINT.
---
OP, I applaud your ability to type. I also am impressed at your vocabulary and your ability to use it.

But you've left us all fucking LOST in terms of what the hell you are trying to say.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll sell you a TSE dragon it doesn't do shit to the sbq
---
Ahh... The fabled Bethestard.

It's not explosive, I kept it since I thought it was kinda funny putting out close to 140 damage...lol
---
Thank you, your guide has been very helpful.
---
“Just the tip”
---
He was probably wondering why I kept pointing at the scorched hiding behind the car with a small sliver of health left..... LOL
---
Watoga is ok, but 3 stars are rare still.  As someone said go inside the building and even then thats not a gaurantee legendaey spawn, more often than not you will get crowned boss enemy.
---
Yes it is - Legit Player
---
Or they tune it down when people uproar. They cannot take another hit to lose players anymore probably. 
---
You asked, I answered.
---
When they make higher lvl weapons the problem will solve itself. Assuming they solve the duping issue.
---
Still here bro, no clue be what your on about either
---
Well it's because they actually like the game. But it's cool to bash the game. 
---
Someone posted it the other day I'll try to link it if I find it. 
---
Somebody makes and sells that so it goes in the power frame of the articulated power armor you can buy. 
---
I have an executioners dragon if your on Xbox 
---
I was joking, since it sounded like you've never seen an exploding rolling pin, haha
---
The mistake is thinking you're any different kind of human for living where you do than they were.  It's a mistake people make over and over again, and it's how you end up in those situations in the first place - thinking you're special and above an entire group of other people by some divine intervention or some shit.
---
Wait so the 15 nocturnal wood right legs I’ve looted myself are gonna be deleted. Wtf lol I always loot the same shit from leggys so fix the looting system before you fuck everyone.
---
Y'all just unlucky
---
awesome
---
You were right and there was nothing to worry about!
---
Well, I say that but I haven't opened my game yet, and I won't know until I get home if everything went well.
---
Hail Bathesda
---
Have to kill 10 of them to finish a quest. I'm at 4/10 and have been playing since day 1. I think we'll have better luck killing unicorns. 
---
The message is clear.
---
It is indeed okay. Fallout 76 is an arcade shooter.
---
Loot and crafting no longer matter, just hit up a third party site and buy what you need for your build.
---
should also need an empty container to collect dirty water :)  
---
You missed the cluster fuck of a launch. No wonder you think it’s approaching an acceptable quality. Wait until you hit level 40 and report back. 
---
sorry to say it still happens i had it happen twice yesterday.
---
Got a 3* medics Dragon for pretty cheap
---
I don't think it's good, I just wanted to at least have a small buff from the Cryolator for the themed character.
---
Exactly! Or after they broke the cap and amount slider so when you go left it recycles instead of stopping... Also if you have a lot of stuff they want to look at everything... 
---
I sense a trap
---
Going in the buildings? Watoga is the city of dungeons. Almost every building has a legendary spawn chance
---
Hey, I like hamburgers and found a deal for 2 for $5 bucks. Convince me to buy them. 
---
Yeah. I figured when it was announced that it would actually change the landscape for a limited time. 
---
Does fictional currency in a video game have an influence on the value of a person in the real world?
---
The answer is yes, it does. The more fictional currency a player has in a video game directly correlates to the lack of actual currency the player has because they're typically losers with no job, no life, and all the time in the world to play video games.
---
It's a no-win situation.
---
I obtained almost 200 legendary items for my merchant character in a nuke zone. People kept dropping them and I picked them up. I'm worried they'll assume I duped them 
---
It's like they've been spending all their time organising WEEKLY content drops. This is going to be so awesome
---
Thank you so much!
---
Don’t start reading into it now it’ll all fall apart
---
I have an instigating one on PS4.  I'll sell it cheap.
---
Don't hold your breath. Have they ever addressed the mutation serums people wasted so much money on? Really glad I resisted that temptation. I've been nearly fully mutated since week one or two, but Eagle Eyes is bugged (doesn't appear, doesn't work, but I definitely have it) and it'd be really nice if they'd even address the topic. I played the lottery at the abandoned waste dump for long enough, would be nice to have something to spend my caps on and run the mutations I want.
---
Anyway, hope they figure something out that doesn't piss everyone off even more! I don't have any traded weapons but I wanted to commiserate with you.
---
Well, he is right. It's always "we will", "very soon", "next few months", "next week", "next month". I'm waiting for the "now you can", "today you will", etc. I can't find the drive to login on my 149 guy to pick up a few more springs and screws. I already have 600+ of those. :(
---
They have the right to do anything they want, but what they did for three months was nothing and allow duplicated items to pervade their market. The blame doesn’t lie with the buyers unless they have good reason to suspect the seller duplicated the item. 
---
yup
---
Yeah, the trade system as it stands now just comes across as bizarre.
---
They had a targeted list of heavily duped items. I doubt the nocturnal wood legs are on that list. 
---
PC.
---
I've got a Corsair headset. It's that I also have a family to provide for and often need to AFK and tend to my family. I can't hear them with a headset on and since I play solo I value my family more than some guy who is too lazy to look over and see why I am using the come here emote.
---
Just up the highest weapon (55-60) and all duped weapons are now "garbage". Make harder enemies and everyone is happy. 
---
Maybe he was roleplaying as a raider? I dunno. And after you reach 50 it doesn’t matter what level you are, since equipment levels cap at 50. 
---
Can there please be an emote for "I don't want your crap...leave me alone?"  
---
Not trying to be an ass but many of us just want to play the game our own way and don't want 'help' from other players.  For instance, I play solo and have all mics turned off and have seen other players get ticked off that I ignore them.  
---
I just sold it for 20 lol 
---
That was my initial reaction as well.  Wait a few thousand years in the timeline and let the the Fallout world become the Skyrim world.  Thar be dragons a-plenty thar....
---
Its fun until theres no story to unravel. The. It gets real fucking boring... The lore is not all that bad. Mediocre but not bad. 
---
Strangely enough my two TSE prime .50 cals remain in my inventory. One was broken and the other was about half a bar (I wonder if that has anything to do with it). I bought a second one for a friend a while back and he ended up finding something similar right after so I never gave him the second one. I'm like 99% sure they should have been on "the list".

I'm going to personally hold onto more of the heavier crafting materials like Digestive Goo, Nuka Cola, Stabilized Flux, and so on. These have always been in short supply for me when crafting because I can only hold onto so many, but now I am going to be able to actually have what I need by hanging onto a bit more.
---
A “prime chassis” would be cool. Maybe the cores last longer or it has some better built in resistances compared to a normal chassis.
---
I know right now ultracite cores do nothing, just a stray thought I had reading this thread.
---
So convince you to buy a game and you come straight out with the insults. I agree with them just stay away bro.
---
Those percentages are bull crap, there’s trophies that are earned extremely early in game (on every game) that have low percentages. 
---
You think they would wipe dupes and not implement a way to ensure they don't get duped again, or at least have a way to punish the dupers if they go back to it?
---
Are you on pc, sell me a tse double barrel
---
Not that you were at all concerned but I still have my TSE double barrel. I’m shocked but relieved.
---
Nope, the vault tec jumpsuit is a costume you can out over armor, and the vault tec university jumpsuit (kind-of misleading name) actually is blue under armor.. it looks like the vault 76 under armor, but has a giant VT on it. You can put shielded lining in  the VTU jumpsuit
---
Still the way the loot system works you get the same legendaries more often than not I think most duper’s are done with the game and don’t really care anymore and a heavy portion of the duped items are shit now anyway. I’d just prefer they focus on fixing bugs and adding content and not waste time searching individual inventories to “get back” at people who “ruined” their game.
---
How do you they paid for those? 
---
I've made my points clear.
---
There is nothing to not understand. 
---
Loot and crafting are a waste of time.
---
Farm the highest value junk and as many straight jackets as you can, do the 7 vendor run for a few days, and buy whatever you want from third party sites.
---
Hopefully you enjoy the actual combat mechanics.
---
It's a good game and has flaws which most people won't see other than getting booted from the server... It's still fun and worth it.   
---
People did get hosed buying the beta in many ways! 
---
Guess we both get to keep our guns. For now...
---
I also play solo.  Playing this way gives me the same sort of experience that Fallout 3/4 gave me ( i.e. - lone wanderer/explorer ).  Frankly, other players emoting and such kind of ruins the experience for me.  However, I am fully aware that I'm not playing the game as 'intended'...
---
Wanna place bets on how long that'll take?
---
With Bethesda's level of skill in handling updates to this game, my bet is 'never'.
---
Get a shotgun. Get Enforcer.
---
Scorchbeasts no longer fly.
---
PC or console? 
---
I have killed a 3 star before and it droped no legendary :(
---
I’m pc
---
It is not there first Multiplayer game.  
---
ESO
---
U should have known thats this arent legit wps its unfair for all legit players .. why can U keep Urlaub Duped Super Rare weapons only because of Caps ? Caps are easy to farm 
---
Nobody tore Fallout 76 down, it tore itself down by being subpar in literally every regard.  Glad you can find enjoyment from 76, but finding enjoyment does not nullify the failings.  A game being enjoyable to someone does not make it a good game.    There is no praising a game for what it could one day become.  Critically, we have to analyze the product as it currently exists, and it is still not in a good state.  Defending a flawed product just because you can still enjoy it is an overwhelmingly shallow view.  You could enjoy driving a Ford Pinto, but that doesn't change the fundamental design flaws that contributed to it catching fire.  Enjoyment is not a direct measure of quality.  Embrace mediocrity and enjoy what you will, I'll be over here taking umbrage with 76 and demanding a higher standard of quality.
---
Ps4?
---
They been open since last summer.
---
You didn't get the salty tears you anticipated from the patch, so you made your own.
---
Well, for those with advanced skills there is also reading terminals.... like in every other fallout game. the listening to holotapes is the same as listening to npcs in other games. 
---
Blackberries!  I collect like 30 on my way to a train station. 
---
I think they're focus once again will be on all tse weapons! God forbid if all my firearms are tse's!!!
---
Something fishy here....
---
I mean, Fallout and TES worlds couldn't possibly be linked since TES world is the dream of a Godhead.
---
I also thought to write not about specific dragons but types, like reveared, ancient, frost etc.
---
prove it
---
I'm hoping soon, they have had plenty of other stuff to try and stop. Maybe they can focus on beneficial updates if they stopped duping completely. 
---
Indeed
---
That is total hyperbole. Level 1. You could play for 1000s of hours and never get the item you want. I don't think it's entitlement that there should be a way to get an item you want in the game you buy without having to devote your life, and I mean years of your life to it. People have already played for 400, 500, 800+ hours and haven't had the item they want to drop. 
---
Not sure who that is but a lot of footage from the nukes right in front of V76 comes from pre-release gameplay I believe. 
---
Also just a jsyk you can nuke anywhere you want except the eastern half of the Forest. 
---

The problem I have with it is not that I am noy capable of organization it's that it isn't fun and it's tedious contrasted to f04 where I didn't have to think about that stuff.

Welcome to the Wasteland you should always expect to be attacked anytime and anyplace

Good thing all of those are easy to acquire 
---
Seems like it's just you. It's pretty straightforward. People are overreacting about intervention that is necessary to combat cheaters and correct the economy. I was just trying to provide detailed info on why this is necessary, and why people should relax about losing their cheated gear.
---
You have a link?
---
I don't think you know what nerf means.
---
Good info, thanks!
---
I mean they sort of did [in this patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/2J2ong0O2B6GAI1AeIdGcp/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-29-2019).
---
&gt;* **DESIGN AND GAMEPLAY**
---
&gt; * **Carry Weigh**t: Is now capped to an absolute limit of 1,500 pounds over the character’s current maximum carry weight.
---
&gt; * For example: If your carry weight limit is 210 pounds, then your maximum limit is 1,710 pounds.
---
&gt; * Characters will be unable to exceed this new weight limit moving forward.
---
&gt; * Characters who already exceed this limit will be unable to add any additional items or caps to their inventories until they have reduced their carry weight below the cap.
---
&gt; * **Dev Note**: These limits exist primarily to keep servers from performing poorly, which can happen when we have too many items in the game world. They also play role in helping to regulate the in-game economy. We do recognize the desire to be able to own more of the cool items that we have in the game, and we are looking into a variety of solutions, including increasing the stash size. We will be sure to talk more about this when they are ready.
---
Kermit, here attempting to drink tea.
---
Its definitely breaks faster than some of my other weapons however I just fix it a lot.  I have my weapons artisans perk maxed out so it repairs to 200%.  It lasts all day for me but I always carry a backup Gauss rifle just in case.  I like the logic someone posted farther down about the two-shot counting as double wear.  makes sense now why the rifle breaks faster.  
---
Legendary versions don’t give rads strangely enough. Have 2, no rads ever when I shoot them. 
---
Might have to delete this so it doesn’t get fixed :O
---
Any of it. 
---
So as an American, am I guilty that the Pilgrims screwed over the natives?
---
Nice but how did they get the long coats? Are those the rare ones people couldn't find??? 
---
At this point the TSE weapons have been nerfed into oblivion. I don’t think they much care about them anymore.  The real way to fix it would be to introduce 4 and 5 star legendaries. That would make the TSEs still good weapons but not as desirable as a 4* or better.  It feels like the fact that they reduced the stacks to 1 rather than remove them completely means they aren’t worried about them anymore or they just didn’t want to piss of people who didn’t feel like they cheated to get one.
---
You think they do?
---
Clearing stacks and leaving them with one is a clear sign that they would rather have an active duper padding their concurrent player numbers for their share holders than actually fixing the game.
---
there are FOUR lights!!!! fight me!
---
I know. I want that to change. I want loot to be a little more predictable with certain loot tables people can at least increase their odds with. And crafting legendary items could be a thing. If you break down 20+ items with a certain legendary effect maybe you can get the essence to enchant it on the item of your choice. Something like that maybe? It would be awesome.
---
That’s not how it works. That’s not how trading works or the economy in this game works. 
---
I said this months ago because I'm familiar with the engine and people downvoted me and asked me "how do you know??" Maybe the best iteration of their engine will have this tech, but this one doesn't.
---
For lulz
---
it still happens, just happened to me
---
It's been fixed sense January why are people still talking about that ? 
---
I don't see no one complaining except you
---
What they did was right. Get over it.
---
very very true
---
Considering these dupers are profiting from real money on these dupes I think they do care
---
I omitted the word know. How do you know they bought those TSEs. 
---
I mean, to get to “now you can” you first have to go through “we will”.
---
We’ve already gone through several “we will” situations to “now you can” situations, so it’s not like they aren’t making any changes.
---
Surprisingly, these things take time.
---
Then you’re blind or willfully ignorant. 
---
but did they leave your legendary rolling pins OP? that's all that matters
---
I'm not saying I'll do it... I'm willing to be patient. But this sub is so full of hate. You don't think that they would bring their torches?
---
Seriously? Can you just not? 
---
No shit!! Lol!! My box stash is fine just my on character stash was nerfed I had like 213 springs ,a ton of the important stuff that too heavy in my box stash. Fucking ridiculous but hey  my quad shotty that I traded for three days ago was legit so I got that going for me!!!
---
This isn’t due to today’s maintenance. People have been reporting it for a while now. I don’t recall it getting fixed but if it *was* then it definitely got un-fixed last patch because I’ve seen it in the past couple days. 
---
Hmm interesting, but doesn’t the server still have to acknowledge that they’re there? I just feel like having to acknowledge all these items on the map that are essentially pointless. Even if it’s a small performance boost I feel like it might be worth it. 
---
I just want my Garb of Mysteries dress back. :( It mysteriously vanished on me one day when I was taking it out of my STASH.
---
So if they make God tier drops more common and allow you to craft affixes onto anything, what kind of game is that?
---
It's definitely not the kill/loot/craft survival game I thought I bought.
---
The guy I bought them from said he duped them,  along with everything else he had to trade. I got a good deal. 
---
I normally agree with that.
---
My post isn't about trading though. I'm pointing out a 3* legendary that drops the best loot in the game.....if you hit it one time and I kill it like I'm going to do with or without you.......we each get a legendary drop.
---
If you don't want free legendaries no problem.....but you should at the very least take it and give it to someone else.
---
Glow sight is good if it's a nuke event. You can crush the glowing ones 
---
Cool story brah.
---
Except in past games you could actually, you know interact with NPCs and choose dialog ect.
---
I'd like a two swing explosive protest sign and instigating while I'm thinking about it.
---
I usually say into my mic "Hey you want to tag this legendary?" 
---
I've seen a few players that far exceed those limits, one here today said he was 80k now 16k after update and another that early on weighed in at 600k.   
---
So if they had a max weight say even 2k in the beginning it would have prevented most if not all of duping
---
That's an upvote
---
I had to double check if I'm on r/fo76.
---
For mid and low level “end game” gear caps will probably remain the currency. The truly elite items will probably always only be available for trade for another item. If you increase the cap limit, it likely just means that those mid and low level end game items get drastically more expensive. Players with really good gear would also quickly hit the new cap and simply be able to drastically outbid the lower players. 
---
Currency is relative. Items that are truly worth “max caps” would still be worth “max caps” if the cap was 50k. 
---
Ya wouldn’t be surprised it was unfixed last patch. First time it happened to me since like a few months and I kill 10+ queens a day with my team. I just killed a few more today and it hasn’t happened again since that first occurrence 
---
Will do! I'm sure that the higher level I get, the more I will find to nit-pick at. Regardless, I'm trying to take the game as it is now and just enjoy it the way I did the previous games in this series.
---
Rofl!! 
---
All I know is I've got level 91 Deathclaws spawning on my lawn (behind Power Station North of Watoga) and they tend to be duking it out with some mid-level Ants half the time.
---
Deal with it!!!! :P Lol it’s much easier to farm glowing blood and glowing steak imo sells for much much more
---
Yes you cheat then try to defend it with really bad logic that doesn't work very well. 
---
Enlighten me oh two shotting explosive sentinal.
---
if you mean the system then yes, it probably will.
---
Yeah, they rolled over for the dupers. Be proud of them.
---
Now the dupers get to keep at least a copy of every duped item. They get to keep all the caps they earned breaking the game for profit. They're laughing all the way to the bank, some of them literally for selling duped goods on ebay.
---
At least I know what group Bethesda's multiplayer games are designed to cater to: Cheaters.
---
I won't make the mistake of purchasing the next one. 
---
I meant Elder Scrolls lol
---
No, it’s not a cool story. 
---
It’s pretty damn depressing. 
---
Stockpiles were removed, which means if one "vendor" sold items to 10 people (which sounds like a very low estimate), it is 10% of the population that has a duped item or items.  Game is still out of wack until they nerf damage even more and then release 4 and 5 star weapons to offset.  Or, they release high level content along with 4/5 star weapons.
---
Yeah, I have to admit this looks great. 
---
Wow, that's ruff!
---
I've checked every vendor multiple times and have not seen them :/
---
Wow!! I think it’s you that doesn’t  understand sarcasm you must work for Bethesda !!!
---
They don't, it's just a lazy argument against all TSE and other top gear. I even showed someone last night that I bought mine with caps in market76 and they just ignored it.
---
A game where everyone can progress to top tier by however much effort they put in whatever path they choose to take.
---
And are doing what about it?
---
Telling us they did "something" that no one can see or feel?
---
Some hand wavy action that will magically trickle down to those of us that have refrained from participating the dupe market?
---
That’s called mule alts. 
---
For real 
---
Whoa yes, I was prepared to be pissed as hell if they screwed this up, but they didn't, and honestly the way they handled it is about as best as I would have hoped. If they did fix duping and have fixed duplicates I'm honestly hopeful they can move on with the game.
---
Seems like they've got content lined up to come out, and I'm actually excited again. We might see reasonable trades now that stacks of TSE aren't available as wildly as they had been. 
---
I did make high end purchases with all three TSE's, so I was a bit concerned.
---
It’s an interesting question though. I think they’ve got the balance right re the caps limit and the difficulty to obtain caps but in a few months everyone will theoretically be at max caps unless some other caps sink is included. It’s weird that Bethesda didn’t include a tax on every item traded (15% caps cut for Bethesda) to cut money out of the economy. 
---
I just love seeing dupers being mad as fuck.
---
Glad you dont run the studio punish people for using a game mechanic and not knowing they bought a duped weapon but sure lets think like a capitalist with the i got mine mentality everyone else should know everything and not play the game cause you could get in trouble.
---
Yep, I'm very happy with how it turned out. The one item I have that may have been duped, a three star axe, is still there in my inventory AND my camp loaded in far faster than it ever has.
---
Plus, the next patch sounds promising, too. 
---
The discords usually have channels for each console and you can probably even find some that are specific to your console
---
Wild Appalachia sounds interesting, looking forward to hearing more about what it'll entail.
---
I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one.
---
Players don't give a shit if the assets in a game used to make said game are legally licensed to be used, what makes you think they give a shit if the items they acquire in a game are legitimate.
---
Ive made mods in other games for years, In the modding community if you want to include some one elses content in your mod you have no idea how much prostrating you have to do in order to get approval to add them to your mod. 
---
God I hope when someone serves you moldy food you just sit and eat it
---
Oh so now we are back to the "nah dude, these are totally legit" argument.
---
Who cares if they are legit or not anymore?
---
Have at em.
---
They wouldn't want to warn dupers, they would do it suddenly so the items don't get shuffled around. Why don't you try duping so we can see for sure? If you think nothing else will happen I mean
---
I understand the sentiment, but that's kind of a bullshit perspective. ANY perspective can see that 76 has been riddled with major issues both before and after launch. Bethesda has never had a game where they needed to keep up with live service...except Brink.
---
By the time 76 is good, it's going to be in a $5 bin, while being outclassed by mobile games. I love bethesda games, but they obviously didn't put the kind of care into 76 that oblivion/FO3 got. This should have been a co-op expac for FO4 for $30.
---
A honeypot is a technical term for leaving something open and hoping someone will exploit it, so you can trap them. 
---
10-20 more pieces of armor I'll probably never use.
---
I honestly agree. People have gotten kind of toxic and I think a lot of it is bandwagon. I have encountered a few bugs and quite a few weak weapons that I like the look of and hope get a small buff but I have hope that Bethesda can and will balance the game and fix bugs. But it takes time. People act like these updates can be made overnight but making games is hard.
---
*country roads intensifies
---
More Perk Cards, better level 50 equipment, more health, more AP. Dont pretend a fresh level 50 is on par as a level 100 and more.
---
I actually was so happy my 3* instigating drill with 40% more flare damage survived !!!!!
---
I find better drops when it is under attack from a Scorch Beast.
---
Roses are red violets are blue, stay away from my C.A.M.P or I'll nuke you.
---
Well, glad you got what you wanted.
---
You know it's bad when the reddit thread is more fun than the game itself lol.
---
If you’re like me and thought that Fallout 4 was great and would be even better as a multiplayer game, you’ll find that Fallout 76 is...not that. 
---
But it’s trying to be. 
---
Supposedly. 
---
Is it worth $25.00? Probably
---
Is it worth $60.00? No
---
Yup. This would be fun. I might try it if I can locate a ghoul slayers golf club!🏌️‍♂️
---
There were times where myself and friends looted something we killed and it had a ton of whatever loot it was.  Wouldn't be surprised if those were considered dupes.
---
So I don't think clearing people's inventory months later when they weren't trying to dupes is disappointing.
---
Atodaso
---
Hey, I applaud your faith.
---
I think I see what's up now though.
---
Too little, too late. Games still a total mess and we don’t have enough stash space and things weigh far too much. I gave up at the start of January and I doubt I’ll ever come back. They got my £50 and that’s that but I won’t support this studio ever again for it. 
---
Just 2112000 more steps to go! 
---
Yeah, it is odd that they state there's a hard 1500 lb limit *above maximum player  carry* but that means these dupers could be exploiting carry weight bugs to raise the base limit and avoid the weird cap BGS set. It really ought to be a static limit.
---
I don't think you understand.
---
That's the whole sentence.
---
Oh thank you.  I have been scraping and selling even 3* lebendarys I have no use for to vendors or giving them away to people because I don't feel like finding someone to buy it in game  I'll definitely check that out then
---
The fact that none of you can tell this is obviously satire is kind of sad really. I suppose that's because it's not very good satire. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Honestly this is a very true post
---
i can be face to face with enemy and use vats with melee and 70% of the time it does no damage..i think vats is broken
---
Sorry forgot to put xbox in post
---
Oh I wasn't saying you were wrong..I was just adding another option... The one I choose to go with. Seems the downvote is strong today 
---
They likely can't detect people who dupe, this was their workaround
---
Yeah I’ll be posting that screen shot of my empty junk category ASAP - because Bethesda is never known for botching patches right?
---
this happens..i just server hop
---
Just keep on stepping.
---
I don't believe the game loot or crafting system is in the place I would like it to be, so I don't know why you're glad.
---
There was no patch.
---
Thats true
---
Having worked with virtual servers, one going haywire *can* impact others if you haven’t configured them well. Or if VMware shits the bed.

Yes ITS a huge fu to all legit players

---
 the idea is the nimroot in Skyrim and the experimental plants found on the Prydwin (sp?) are the same plant.  So obviously its the same world (Gotta love those leaps of faith found in the interweb... LOL).  Of course I'm still looking for the TSE shotgun in sky-rim, so far no luck.
---
That’s not what I’m saying at all. I’m not saying they are originals.

Your post implies these were pay to win bought items. How do you know these folks paid to win? 
---
where's the patch notes?
---
The griefers will stay on the normal server because there won't be a penalty for dying then coming back. 
---
I'm moving to the PvP server because I'll have a defensive advantage at my own base, and have to imagine people won't risk attacking a fortified location

I think we need Dogmeat added back into the game.

I remember sweating bullets for like the first month of NV. Any fucking time I booted up the game my save could have just been gone. Great game, but this 76 community seems to be staring at roses 90% of the time. I thought FO4 was gonna be the last game on the creation engine, and my hopes for ES6 are drying up every "patch" 76 gets. 
---
Exactly. There’s still so much potential here, and to expect and demand it here and now when everyone else is expecting and demanding a billion other things is completely unrealistic. There’s an order to this shit, and none of us know it, and that’s fucking okay. The important thing is stuff is being addressed, and I, for one, thank Beth for that. 
---
I want a TSE Protest sign. Basic attacks are turned into double-swings and every hit you land *explodes killing everyone in the immediate contact area*.
---
Ah dang
---
Thats what i did but just why? What do they get from it lol? Nothing
---
I'm not saying nothing changed. A lot of things have improved. But we need PVE content. We need it now or at least we need to know what we will get. It's all speculation and it's been like that for a while. They are stalling. And the PVP server... How they made it the priority. It's killing me. Fixes and fixes are not fun for the player, they're accomplishments for the developers. I'd rather have complete silence for 3 weeks and then a patch with content, fixes and an 'inside the vault' that would make them proud to publish. You can't keep putting patches on an open wound if you have an internal hemorrhage. And you can't use the "carrot" strategy if no one knows what the carrot is. Specially if it takes months to tell us they're still not ready to show it. 
---
If he's in power armor just pull out your most powerful weapon (preferably anti armor) and light him up. PA in pvp is useless.
---
On a side note. I was playing on an alternate character last night (lvl 45). I accidentally hit a higher levels base (lvl 150+). He came mercilessly killed me,  took my loot (which I had been farming for about an hour), and proceeded to taunt me with emotes. I happened to have someone on my friends list in the same server (someone I had traded with in the past I assume). So, I switched to my main (lvl 230). Put on my assassin/sentinel armor and equipped my anti armor explosive powerful automatic handmade. I then proceeded to lay waste to his base. I racked up a 100 cap bounty before he came at me. I killed him about half a dozen times before he logged without killing me a single time. 
---
Point is, someone bullied a low level and ended up getting absolutely destroyed for it. I would have left it alone had he just taken my 5 cap bounty and left my junk.... Thanks for the caps and enjoy repairing your base :) 
---
And you know, I’d really wish it wasn’t true. 
---
dude the other day i think it was saturday i go on here..i tend to sort thru the topics by 'new' ... and it was nothing but negativity..the worst ive seen on here
---
If he wiped your ass with a level 40 would you be any less mad? Ha ha ha ha
---
We can currently pick them up and sell for 1 cap each - not sure there’s much point in sell for 0. There’s a stack of burnt books by my local vendor - 8 caps a day from walking past a table is fine with me.
---
Bye Leroy..
---
Yes, get rid of them. Leave maybe one in each church but replace them with 'Damaged Bible's'.
---
Another QoL improvement I can think of would be to make tagged resource items displayed with a solid customizable outline (similar to the hover-over outline).
---
Most games make things you're looking for easy to spot. Would be nice to see a floor/desk items outline from a distance rather than spending the extra time searching. 
---
Togglable obviously.
---
Ya i have decemt lvl 50 weapons and perk cards for em but if i fought back i guarantee i would have been 1 shot 
---
I can give you one for free and a bunch of ammo if your on pc
---
Me too man, we all do. This place could of been a place of trading and making new friends and teaming up and ect ect but all they do is complain.
---
I called my guy, who is an expert at armor that protects against literally anything in the world, he said it's worth at most 5 caps, best I can do is 3 caps.
---
But all they wanted was stars upon thars...
---
Wouldn’t that make it good satire?
---
See ya in the Wasteland!

lol i havent figured that out yet..someone ran up to me with their mic (i dont have one)...screamed "helllllllooooooooooo" which scared the crap out of me..and then hit me with a spear or something like that..i just server-hopped
---
Ideally, legendaries don't exist.
---
That's it. Game fixed.
---
I’m lvl 115 and get random base attacks sometimes, was actually almost done, mid remode, the other day when I group of 4/6 brown and and started destroying the place... it’s not worth the hassle tbh I just relogged and finished what I was doing. That’s life in the wasteland... stick and move 
---
Ever built a kick-ass settlement in Fallout 4 and were kind of bummed that you had no one to appreciate your Bob Vila levels of base building? Well, this game fixes that; now you can not only post pictures of your stuff, you can INVITE THEM over to your place.
---
I recommend making a run through West Tek, often times there’s a 3* Super Mutant.
---
If you're willing to play for a while and see not only the game's problems but also what is fantastic about it,  then $25 is a great deal. If you're merely going to play to L17 and then spend hours on this sub whining about every little thing you don't like, please put that $25 toward something else.
---
Id love to find a 4-5 star legendary weapon
---
As of lately ive gotten shit. Kill a lvl 90 legendary deathclaw and get some crap leather armor? Comon!
---
Or trying to recover goods from a legendary and everything disapears?? Wtf is that all about?
---
Trying to preserve those 200lbs as long as i can bc i hate inventory managment. 
---
i have a TS Dragon
---
All that waaaah was not funny and not worth anything. Bethesda is so soft.
---
I hope they continue by unnerfing Two Shot, buffing Energy/Heavy-weapons and doubling weapon durability. This would make me quite happy! =D
---
Wow this sounds like a duped item for free 😂
---
Some players are just idiots. 
---
Jeesh.... do you think they had a script or did some kids sit there and push a button 50,000 times to get those caps?
---
and while we're on the subject, sorta, it's kinda lame that I have to use boiled dirty water to make tea when I have perfectly good purified water that would work too.  
---
Plot twist.. Overseer is dead so its ground hog day all over again.
---
I have 5 The Dragon's they drop commonly off bosses
---
Much better. 
---
I aware of what a Honeypot is, im not aware of how/why you think this applies to me or why I would be banned.  I don't really care either.
---
Maybe is Zetan abductions... Maybe is a Wild Mage using Summon Cow... Maybe is Maybelline?
---
Accidentally moved my base while my pip boy was black screened and now all it says is "cannot place item: Nothing selected" hopefully its something they can address in the next patch or at least comment on.
---
Was able to move it just fine before the patch
---
I've seen some people complain that they shouldn't remove the duplicated items and just fix the exploit that makes it possible. According to [this forum post,](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/322679/duped-items-removed-feb-14-2019?language%5B%5D=en) it's already been done, a very small portion of players were affected, and that the process was somewhat obvious. If you've got a Two Shot Explosive whatever and you've got dozens of them of the exact same item, chances are it's beyond a reasonable doubt you got them legitimately.
---
While I can see what you're talking about, perhaps a different perspective is warranted. I bounce back and forth between r/fo76 and r/fo76FilthyCasuals. FC is much more laid back and intended to explore and share the fun of 76. In no way does that mean that I'm knocking r/fo76, there is just a more 'all encompassing' perspective covering every little facet of the game here and sometimes that can be a little overwhelming. I like digging into the details and see what changes are happening under the hood too, but nevertheless, I'm here to have fun and I'm not about to let someone's tirade on a change affect my enjoyment. During those times, I step back, and go casual. :)
---
Same I have a TSE and TS version. 
---
Perhaps so. I guess your communication style and my reading style don't gel.
---
I can be wordy myself when I'm being self-indulgent, but I just can't wade through this one, sorry.
---
I’m not the kind of person to say atodaso. 
---
But.... atodaso. 
---
We found the Charleston vendor that sells them. I bought one and gave the one I had on me.
---
I'll run around there and see. I've heard Charleston Capital too but haven't seen them.
---
I have quite a few solid items I'm going to start posting for sale again. Stuff that I would have loved fing at level 25-50. Now I'm trying to figure out prices.....maybe 300 caps for a level 35 two shot combat rifle? Idk, guess I will just have to see.
---
Good work Austin. More like this. Was a little later than I'd have liked but good work.
---
Fantastic reference. 
---
That’s true!
---
The only change I noticed is that when I crouch, the “Caution” message is showing in red 100% of the time, no matter where I go
---
A major mechanic of this game is trading - for that very reason.  It *IS* playing.  Sometimes, it will be the only way you get your hands on something you really want.  IMHO, there is not a thing wrong with that.
---
I bought the Mr. Fuzzy hat off of somebody for a cool 2500 caps.  I am not sorry.  Nope.. not at all.
---
I've had some decent luck in watoga. Found my first dragon (garbage rolls) on a 3* that walked out from behind the high school. Have found personally that whitesprings is over all better because the mob density is nicer. Less running around. However, total possible legendary spawns per run seems higher in watoga if you grind through the buildings.
---
You can't increase the cap willy nilly, I'd say 2020 by the earliest, and more likely 2021.
---
Just a simple "We Know" will do.
---
And they were in Vault colors
---
Yeah, you need to find the recipes for them. I can't remember where I got them, but I just had them at one point whilst exploring.
---
What if when someone stole something in real life the government just deleted the item you took.
---
Problem solver, I am.
---
I just wait till they hit it, then finish it off, cause I still one hit a lot of level 48 stuff with head shots.
---
didn't even realize that haha. that's great
---
I have an issue with the M79 as a "big gun." "Big Guns" in the Fallout game are a what the military refers to as "crew-served weapon," usually requiring a team of troops to carry the parts to, assemble hastly, and fire from a fighting position. Alternatively, they are mounted on vehicles, boats, or on the side of ships. They are typically MK II Browning. 50 machine guns or the 240B machine gun; anti-tank or vehicle or aircraft.
---
The M79 was designed as a rather portable version of this with the intent of it being carried and used as a shotgun. So it's a small arm. It was replaced by the M203 which attaches to the underside of an M4 or M16 and is still pump-action. Both use the 40MM grenade rounds.
---
I think the M79 should be a small gun that benefits from the Scattershot, Grenadier, and Demolition Expert perks. The real-life equivalent is a hybrid, as such it should be in the game, as well. I'm speaking as a veteran with training experience with the M203.
---
That said, I'm pretty happy with the update. Thanks for the hard work!
---
You don’t think the flak is deserved for this game?
---
I think that they have been trying to take care of the duped items and somewhat fix the games economy before implementing this. Maybe now that there has been some actions to remove duped items, they will move forward with the camp vendors.
---
That's not even the way loot works. Safes and containers are supposed to be instanced I thought (unique to each person). So you really just deprived him of the XP from unlocking the safe,
---
The community can never be pleased
---
I’m an old guy too and on PS4 so if you are looking for anyone to play with DM me. I’m relatively low level at 30. Whenever I encounter another player I will wave furiously and hope they don’t shoot back. 9 times out of 10 it works and I make friends.
---
Thanks.   I can’t believe I need a recipe to dilute this stuff.   Maybe I should do the Cordon Bleu course in France
---
The community caught fire, and burned for far too long. Bethesda showing up with a sprinkler isnt going to be enough now. If tg his came out a month ago, people would have be thrilled. But we are months into the full release of a game that has no endgame, has only gotten worse, and whose design quality of life can be described as tedious at best if not completely incomprehensibly incompetent. Fixing something that should have been delt with in a proper beta isnt applause worthy.
---
If you're on ps4 I have quite a few that were acquired by legit means
---
I for one would like to thank you for not bringing your toxic attitude to the next one too! :)
---
Too bad it's fleeting - they only want you for one thing. And once they get it, it's on to the next one.
---
Every time I've had that happen, it was because I had random cans of beer stashed all over inside of my clothes in my luggage.  
---
My dirty underwear and socks were purposefully on top.
---
Alas, PC. Thanks though.
---
That'll be 1,000 atoms for the emote.
---
Ive had runs where there are no legendaries and everything is level 14 or level 26 and other runs where i get 6-8 legendaries including assaultrons. 3\* is more rare but they actually seem to have the green fiery glow when they show up. I'm an equal split on them dropping nothing, a junk 1\* or an actual 3\*
---
Flak is flak.
---
Whining about the game you’re playing on the subreddit for that game while waiting for the next patch to continue playing the game.
---
Those people are faggots.
---
LOL. Congratulating devs on something they broke, that never should've survived this long in a full priced game.  
---
Although I suppose this makes sense, because only masochists are still playing this game. Every time the devs shit in your mouth you say, "thank you Bethesda for saving me the chunky pieces". 
---
Sneak was fucked up 2 updates ago
---
Sorry, I misinterpreted what you were saying.   Makes mores sense now!
---
Someone just pmed me about FC, and it was an instant sub and a breath of fresh air. I’ll be visiting there a lot more, just to avoid the constant barrage of negativity. Shits bad for your health. I can completely see where you’re coming from as well, as I’m not trying to knock a community that I’m a fan of and support, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t jade you so quick. 
---
Too bad...I'm an "old guy" and I don't mind teaming up with people.
---
K, idc
---
My issue is I traded for my explosive minigun, mine wasn't a drop. The guy I traded with could run, didn't have duplicates in his inventory, but it's a 3 start TSE minigun... one of the more popular duped weapon stats... 
---
I hope it's not a dupe, I paid alot for it and the guy saved it for me since he knew I was a heavy weapons guy.
---
We are all made of carbon particles

I don’t care what level you are, I’ll destroy your entire base if you build it behind white spring so you can cheese the back door.
---
Right not worth the hassle exactly. So i just server hopped also. But its not worth the hassle being dicks either
---
One in each unless you are trying to max out damage, then you would need all 9.
---
Wow, fine I'll give to them they did the right thing.
---
Good job crew.
---
I would take it to the counter, and say "I noticed some mold on my bread, could I please have a new one"
---
Shocking I know. I couldn't record that on my phone and be an instant social media sensation, but I suppose that is my loss.  My win however, is getting a new sandwich that doesn't have spit, or worse, in it and probably a free sandwich to boot. 
---
You just need purified water. 
---
I use a power fist and walk around wearing Dense armor. I stand *on* the car when I punch it, and I do so often.
---
THANK YOU
---
Problem is, it wasn't random. They announced it way to far ahead of time. And too specific - if you had more than a minimal amount of a specific list of 400 weapons and armor pieces, they would strip them out of your inventory and inspect any large cap transfers in your history. They didn't even look at recipes, bobbleheads, magazines, serums, etc...
---
So while we normal players were guessing if any of our gear would disappear, they had time to turn their dupped items into caps, spread them around among some new mules to reduce the chances of getting caught, or just scrap or drop the evidence. As long as their inventory of proscribed items wasn't large enough to trigger a review, they get to keep all the caps and some of the desirable inventory. 
---
Fus do raaaahh
---
This is just a really common thing in development shops I feel.  They say they can't do it, but then they get someone high up on the food chain breathing down their neck asking why this isn't possible and MAGIC! They found a way.
---
If only you could dual wield sledges in power armor. That would be sweet
---
Add in power armor, legendary weapons that are fun to use, hmmmm.....maybe I can use this gatling laser some time, and building material you might need and it goes pretty quickly.
---
That is how safes work.  I've unlocked safes in Watoga that had nothing in them.  I've also gone to known level 3 safes that were unlocked but had loot in them.  Safes are first come, first served.  
---
At this point, I generally avoid the Misc tab because it's so full of garbage I don't need anymore but can't get rid of.
---
Heh!
---
Watoga is shit for hunting legendary. Don't even bother.
---
So they just dupped them?
---
What are YOU trying to say?
---
There was only one weapon I bought from a vendor (gragnaks axe) and one weapon I bought from another player (the dragon). Honestly i rarely use the dragon but i would be sad to lose my axe. But I doubt either one is gone but if so I'm sure I'll move on just fine.
---
What did they fix? Prevent few ebay traders ?
---
So your thinking maybe it is still there maybe I just can't see it?
---
My username is ttam10782006 on ps4
---
This analysis omits the possibility that more than one duper is present simultaneously, which isn't covered by your caveat about uniform distribution. But that makes the math much more tedious and only increases the overall probability, which is consistent with the point you're making, so I agree with the simplification and am only pointing this out because, as a professor, I feel compelled to do so. :)
---
Is this really how some people think...?
---
I paid full price and got it early. 
---
Haven't regretted it. 
---
Technically more of the blame goes to Andrew Jackson in the american government of the 1800's

Just circling back on this post, in case you hadn't read today's [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/4U5kt2uvsdoSfii4prwboN/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-february-14-2019), we announced that we're planning to increase the Stash limit from 600 to 800 lbs with next week's patch. 
---
I thought they handled it very gently.  I was expecting the same kind of ham-fisted treatment we got with the last patch.  I think if the community was largely stripped of items they found/purchased with a blanket wipe, it would have been the straw that broke the camel's back for all but the most diehard of hardcore fans.  I was ready to call it if I lost my TSE pipe bolt action.
---

Don't remind me. First time I discovered the cars could still detonate was as a fresh level 5 that wandered into the fertile soil event and was attacked by a group of Mr. Farmhands. Accidentally struck a car parked in front of the garage while trying to hit a flying bot with my ax... and then everyhting went white
---
The artillery one was the only one that I knew about, but I believe that was patched long ago.
---
I like that idea! Maybe more base special boosts? Less damage from SB/Q.
---
I think I saw and maybe even replied to your comment about that yesterday. Glad to see you didn't lose the rifle
---
I may still have one.  It isn't great, but you can have it for free if you are XB1.  GT = AlpineYJ
---
I do agree with this somewhat, but the whining and tears would have been epic if they'd cleared out all the duped from the John's that knew they were buying duped TSE, but would claim they didnt.
---
i can actually hear the music in my head once i saw that screenshot  :)
---
Do those hamburgers also have pubes in them? Sure, you could take them out, but the thought will still be there...
---
lol the most hilarious casualty of this fix is that all the vendors in the enclave bunker are shared. Are you in the science wing using the vendor cause I can't use the vendor in the military section now... lol.
---
I can give you 5 bulk aluminum, and 5 flux of the ones you mentioned 
---
\+1 cosigned.  Totally useless clutter.  Not even good to sell because they weigh so much.
---
Why be so rude?  
---
I'm with AB. You'll spot something you don't like and we'll have to listen to you whine. 
---
Find something else to amuse you. 
---
L I didn't lose shit who's laughing now bitch
---
...that isn't really necessary. 
---
Cuz it's not loading all your duped items. /s
---
I am still lugging around a very cool but very situational plasma gatlin 2\* so now I'm happy I can keep it stored!
---
You see, first we assume a spherical duper...
---
Everyone's thanking Bethesda today, bro....
---
That's irony you could choke on
---
I agree, you trade but you don’t dupe. There’s nothing wrong with trading because what someone else doesn’t want might be exactly what you need. That makes it interesting but you still have to find a person to buy it from, it’s not a sure thing until you find it. 
---
Preach on.
---
That would be awesome.
---
The only other weapon I want is a Vampire's Grognak Axe, even a 1-star. Everything else I find is getting sold.
---
Yes, that's awesome news!
---
Right? I guess to be fair with a holotype there is no choosing a reply to trigger one of several pre-written responses, but frankly I don't miss that much at all. I feel like the no-NPC issue has been blow way out of proportion and is a small price to pay for the fact that the game is multi-player. No Non-Player Characters, sure, but you have a server full of actual players  to explore and trade  with. 
---
Yes.i found a workaround feature. 90% of the time if you switch to a melee weapon before picking anything up, you shouldn't have ammo stolen by the FO God's.
---
Sugar Grove is mine. Bonus points for catching dumbass robots in the middle of it. 
---
My pipboy froze earlier the first time I logged in post-maintenance. I crashed the second time.
---
Yeah I think that was the first to be patched. 
---
This patch came way too late, everyone has duped items by now.
---
Better late than never i guess.
---
Welcome to reddit? 
---
That they traded with other players slowly building up the economic power to be able to eventually trade for those weapons. 
---
Same perk points, same health, same AP
---
It’s all equipment and build strategies.
---
LOL......
---
I was thinking...... who in their right mind would not want to kill a 3* legendary
---
Maybe, with all nuclear real world problems, we, Fallout fans, can learn something to face the future. When North Korea will lose his head, we will be ready, and we wil rule Fortnite players!
---
Whenever I see this I read "we licked one of your items, we wont tell you which". 
---
Dude you are
---
On to

Something
---
Unlike the OP you're not bragging about how awesome your nation is for giving out whiskey, smallpox blankets, and exchanging land for beaded glass.  He was tooting Ze German horn for punishing people for buying stolen property.i simply took his example to the next logical step.
---
Okay so 3 hours later they give you another sandwich and sure they fixed that patch of mold but there's a other one up under the bun and then the next sandwich they say "all right we'll give you and extra slice of tomato" but you just want your bread fixed. So you've been sitting here for hours and they still haven't fixed it I'm going to bitch on Yelp or Facebook or something. 
---
lol yea no nothing i had is missing but yea I'm pretty sure has something to do with duped items missing , but not mine :)
---
Eh, makes sense, Bethesda Austin is mostly millennias 
---
We haven't had good dialog options since fallout 1/2
---
this was a beautiful moment in time
---
So you can't choose dialogue. But outside of that the actual story itself is terrific. 
---
Vault 11 from NV doesn't have NPCs and tells a terrific story
---
https://youtu.be/Z6JoyTIhyl8
---
Think of it as a game full of this.
---
 Also the NPCs go through their dialogue trees without you prompting them. Any other MMO just gives you circular dialogue so they've cut out the middle man
---
Lol! Was this ever fixed, some how feels worse every day since it was 'fixed'.
---
But that’s the game. That’s the wasteland. You find it or trade for it, but you don’t deserve to always get everything you want without working for it unless this is a stand alone game. We will be getting pvp soon and it would actually be pretty boring if everyone playing had exactly the same maxed out kit. 
---
Search spreadsheet in this reddit 
---
You'll find all the info you need 
---
Maybe they'll be able to cook you breakfast.
---
Do I need a /s here?  Nah...
---
False. Dupers typically have 5 characters with max caps (if they weren’t idiots) or 100k caps.
---
They could just buy shit if they need it (they don’t) and if they did, they could just trade a set of duped shit off their other character that they don’t need.
---
It’s limited, but everyone who wanted something at this point already has it, so the initiative for trading is also dead.
---
Update essentially killed the market.
---
Are you Ayn Rand?
---
I’m with you on this, it’s sad to see people happy about keeping weapons &amp; armors they bought with real money; thus, only supporting the negative activity going on within the game.
---
Not based on what Bethesda has to say: they targeted a list of 400 commonly duped weapons and armor, and then Nuka cola in accounts that had those removed.
---
For me, it's simple.  It's fun.
---
Defenently don’t play as much as I used to because of lack of things to do. However I still enjoy the game. I do the daily events kill the queen when the opportunity arises and spend time stockpiling ammo for when new content brings me back full swing. And as always the never ending quest for legendary loot calls to me 
---
PS4 btw 
---

---
Yay, a beta fix months late finally came out! Still only 1 "boss", still has weapon breaking issues, inventory management still tedious... still the same game. Waiting for the outer worlds so that I can see what might have been.
---
100% it’s annoying AF lol I run pacifist wish that kept me and my stuff from taking damage period. Hopefully one day they make adventure mode pvp and pvp mode just that.
---
&gt; or even identify if an item was duped.
---
yep, creation engine, I'm assuming doesn't allow for unique item tags.  Add this to the already long list of things that should have been accounted for, but oh well, here we are.  Either way, I feel good about what they did today.  Even if it's just to show that they can do things without breaking things.  
---
I'm on the trading subs and I'm very happy with this solution. I have my suspicions on some of my inventory, but I don't have stacks of obvious dupes. I'm open for business still with zero losses
---
[https://imgur.com/a/ybxJjj9](https://imgur.com/a/ybxJjj9)
---
Or dual wield anything. Might make "Fast" weapons more useful if you could use two of them, or use one "Medium" weapon in a main hand and one "Fast" in your off hand.
---
It wasn't perfect. They missed a lot of shit.
---
No clue. Except for the gatling laser they were a lackluster group anyway.
---
So will I only have 1 stimpack? bc I highly doubt the 500 some dude gave me were legit 
---
They are aware that the energy weapons are weak and will be addressing it in the future. 
---
I give them an upvote for todays action. Once I read what they were doing, it did concern me enough to log in and check my inventory. I'm not a duper, but I did spend a considerable amount of time server hopping the enclave bunker a month or so ago to mod out all my X01 armor. I never passed up any of the desirable items, and ended few extra copies of mods I've saved for trade. I thought they may have wiped them out as well. but still there. 
---
Of course, once I checked my inventory, I logged right back out. I'm still waiting for something to do in game. 
---
No, I’m Batman. 
---
I’ll take that leather armor. The last four weeks, nothing but legendary wood armor drops for me. 
---
NV had some good dialog choices
---
I've never been so disappointed with a game purchase. I'm with you.
---
Im ready bro,  lets do this!
---
At first, yes. But Bethesda is actually making an attempt to fix the game and make it what it was originally supposed to be, so we should be commemorating them for not giving up on the game even after most of the playerbase turned against them.
---
It’s possible there’s more negativity than is warranted, but there are also people making constructive suggestions, and oftentimes, people are complaining because they expect more from Bethesda, and the promise of a multiplayer Fallout game. I liked Fo76. I still hope it becomes good, again, but technical problems drove me away from the game. Saying people shouldn’t complain isn’t going to solve the very real issues that plague the game in the current state. 
---
Wish I had dragon rend ..to ground scorched beasts 
---
Their announcement post said they had a targeted list of weapons and armor, then they went back and did a nuka cola pass as well. So no, they should be fine. 
---
Blame Bethesda... we are bored and so you will suffer 
---
How do you know a lot of players left? Not trolling genuinely interested in your source/data.
---
And it’s fucking disgusting. 
---
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they had previously said that they can't edit player inventories. I know they have told people this that have accidentally lost items and they haven't been able to help. So either they added a way to do it recently or they were full of it this whole time.
---
Its not worth it.
---
I can't wait to see what happens. I have no dipped items, so if anything in my inventory vanishes. I'm going to be one hot cholo! 
---
Nothing smart if that's what yiur asking 
---
They did a really good job, in my opinion.  I had two lvl 45-50 1 star instigating shishkebabs in my stash (that I personally found and saved for trading) and they were both still in my stash today.  The durability bars are slightly different, so it's obvious with a bit of inspection that they're not identical.  I have no idea if my shishkebabs were even looked at, but if they were, QA noticed that they weren't the same.
---
Nice, thanks for the tip
---
adding to the complaining by complaining about complaining.  
---
bye
---
I agree.  Their solution was elegant overall.  My whining was misplaced. 
---
What did it look like? I did a ton of trading back in the day and it seems like absolutely nothing I own was affected. I still have 600/600 in my stash and nothing seems missing from my inventory. 
---
The other 90% wont notice because they're playing Anthem lol.
---
But one copy isn’t a problem for the game either.
---
Nuka cola was one item they went after per their main post.
---
Lol well you might be disappointed then.
---
Not saying you're wrong, but you also need  a recipe to make tea from herbs and heaven forfend you should use purified water. Only boiled dirty water will do. Some of this game's decisions are...[questionable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/authors/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-the-best-douglas-adams-quote/wonko-the-sane-on-toothpick-instructions-from-so-long-and-thanks/) when compared to real life. 
---
Glad that’s all you got from it. Deuces. 
---
I'm talking about the people who swear and engage in personal abuse. Frustration at a product doesn't give you the right to be cruel and hateful. I've criticised the game and continue to do so when warranted, but I try and be constructive.
---
On the best MMO thing, it's already my most popular game and I love it. I meant like award winner for MMO of the year territory
---
Doing the vendor run gives you 1200 caps after fast travel. So after a week you’d have 8400 caps. That may buy you a junkies explosive or trouble shooters sentinel. Not the best gear in the game. So after 7 weeks of grinding the way you listed you may have s loadout if decent stuff  but a far cry from what you are indicating. 
---
They basically didn’t do anything to impact duping.
---
Trash solution by trash devs in trash game
---
It's the internet, everybody's mad about something.
---
what was here that I have not read before?
---
Lol. That's because they didnt remove all duped items... they removed large quantities of the same item from single characters. You can bet tons of duped items are still all over because people dont have a bunch of copies on one character.
---
They mentioned that in the Inside the Vault today.  They're targeting March for the fix.
---
Sadly yes. I'd say even this is better than nothing though
---
in all honesty i cant blame bgs Austen cuz they are inexperienced with this like bethesda threw fixing bugs and everything else on them
---

Almost every car I see now I shoot. Making my own end game content.
---
Lol. How? It doesn't affect you in any way.
---
Not like like that means anything from them, we were supposed to get new content in January that never happened. This game is a dumpster fire.
---
It's on the internet, it must be true. 
---
I said it tongue-in-cheek, but yes, I did think there was a slim chance I'd wake up naked in the Vault missing a kidney and every other tooth.  Didn't.  So credit to BGS for a bold move here, apparently well executed.
---
Synths?
---
You're right, but that's not what I meant. You can like the game, not play the game, write protestsongs about the game, support Todd Howard as the next president and paint "Bethesda" all over your boxing bag - all at the same time. But nobody should question other people who feel differently. 
---
Noone should get insulted because they like the game and support Bethesda. Noone should be judged for dropping the game. Noone should be labeled as shill/fanboy/whiteknight for defending the game. And noone should be called hater for pointing out the flaws and how these flaws impact his enjoyment.
---
That is what I meant by my comment. For some reason people keep questioning those who have different opinions. In the last few days I've seen many comments about "How can people still play the game/support Bethesda/defend this" and the typical reply was "Because *(insert a thinly-veiled insult here)*". There are occasional comments who tried to shun the negative folks as well, but since most of the post recently were negative, those like my examples were more prevalent.
---
Everyone should do whatever they want for whatever reason, but in the same vein other can do whatever they want to. Too many people want there to be only single narrative about the game (e.g. "If you aren't posting about existing issues then you are not helping") and I'm getting sick of it.
---
Read this weeks inside the vault crybaby.
---
No, pick up a new &amp; better game. 
---
Damn dude,  I for sure bought ten at once in a stack but never duped them myself lol.
---
So don't play it crybaby
---
They deserve the critiscm.
---
Can you improve them???
---
You might not have noticed but this game isn't very good and many people stopped playing really fast. 
---
YES.  I'll still get the bounty for wiping those out, but at least I will know whose shit I am destroying.
---
They, like beer bottles in some cases, exist as just a way to grab 10 - 20 extra caps while near a vendor, if you are just a few caps short. Typically they don't stay in the inventory very long and the "duplicate" ones are almost immediately deleted when converted to caps from the Asset list.  They are actually pretty low in terms of overhead from what I can tell. 
---
I play nightly with a friend and my wife. We have fun. Worth it to me.
---
was always here....
---
They took anything "duped" but left one behind of the stack. So basically all the normal players are good. Don't know why you'd carry two of the exact weapon :P
---
More weapons since they break every 10 minutes
---
Somewhere, there is someone that either looted two identical TSEs or bought one and then looted one soon after, and they will likely lose a real TSE.
---
Statistically, that is literally a couple people in the grand scheme of things.
---
Pretty solid move.
---
It’s 50. 
---
I enjoyed the game a lot, despite some issues.
---
At the moment I'm just kinda doing it as force of habit.  Hoping that the new content is worthwhile and that they don't do anything else to bring the game down (I'm still miffed about the nerfs).  But really, yeah, force of habit.  It's my nightly routine now.  That's my XBox play.
---
I also bought it on PC for $12.  I've barely scratched the surface with that character, but I'm doing that build completely differently from my other one.  Going to go for an unarmed character.  Good luck nerfing these hands!
---
This guy knows how to market a product 
---
I haven't since early Jan, I was a lvl 245, I was so hyped for this game and it's a massive failure and you're too blind to see it.
---
yeah but its like going to a coffee shop and having a guy with no experience try to make a professional coffee cuz his boss put him there ya know? 
---
I have an issue with granates looted from raider corpses not "getting" in my inventory
---
There are trading subs?
---
Did they release a list of the items they flagged as the "dupe" targets? 
---
There are definitely Legit Trader accounts who carry multiples of items greater than 1 but not at Duper levels... So I wonder where the threshold is here, and whether they were targeting exclusively unique items, or whether rare but obtainable in quantity items were swept up into the mix.
---
As you said in another post when you though this patch would fulfill your deepest fantasy’s.... cry me a river? 
---
You mentioned playing a mostly solo game? So how would me having a tse effect your solo adventure? Just stop.. and play the game you want and let me play the game the way I want to... no more QQ
---
I thought so thanks
---
That plan sounds like it's entirely contingent on players selling their dupes to vendors rather than other players. Given how easy duping sounds, it seems like that would take years to bite (if it ever worked) even assuming duping stopped today.
---
We sure this is r/fo76? There's no bitching.

And what is working for it? And what if the systems in the game that allow you to "work for it" are not fun, or engaging, or rewarding, or worth your time? Are we expected to wait around for months or years for player vending and new loot and crafting systems to be implemented? What if we don't have months or years to wait and waste on a game? What if we want to experience the actual fun the game has to offer, beyond a pointless grind designed to manipulate you into playing longer? Games should be fun. If the systems in the game are not fun and rewarding then there is a problem. Players will find ways to get around these problems. Exploiting and glitches are one of those ways. There also has to be multiple paths. And these paths should be within the game, not going to Reddit or Facebook or Discord, but in the game. And not randomly opening a trade window with random people, most of whom probably don't want to open a trade. Because then they scope out your weakness or strength and decide to attack you ore your workshop based on what you have.
---
The server has to keep track of individual world items.  If it didn't then when other players picked up plans and magazines and such they wouldn't disappear from your client.  It's not entirely clear whether the server tracks all the things.  If I pick up the burned book on the table do you see it disappear?  I think so.  And so I think it does track all the items that can be individually referenced.
---
i’m not impressed. They should have took it all.
---
Yes but only if I use a super sledge to start it off
---
Yeah you would expect to get what you pay for after the initial fuck up but if you don't get a good final product for your money you will still be pissed.

Fallout 76 in a nutshell
---
Energy Weapons weren't so hot in Fallout 4, outside if stuff like the Tesla Rifle. They just scale even worse in 76.
---
New Vegas was the last game with a bunch of good Energy Weapons, and might even be the best example.
---

---
Well, the OP is referencing things that happened after today's maintenance, so your experience yesterday is largely irrelevant.
---
I literally can't stop myself from firebombing parking lots.
---
You get it.
---
This is the stupidest thing I've ever read. 
---
Ideally the buildings should be blown up as well but you’re gonna have to go play battlefield for that kinda realism 
---
The community we have. Honestly, we've met some great people who we genuinely enjoy spending time with. If not for them we would have quit playing some time ago. 
---
meh got it for free but in all honesty blame main studio
---
Or just do what you want how you want, since there are no consequences.
---
They have already banned players for duping though.
---
Eh, to each their own. I think if they axed all the duped items it would have been the nail in 76's coffin. They're just literally everywhere.
---
It definitely did for me today. For sure. Nothing was removed from my inventory and I was NOT affected by the removal.
---
In the best way.
---
4 Star Legendary have been already dropping. I have a 4 star Bloodied Machete and 4 star combat rifle that I got over the last few weeks. 
---
Paid 60 dollars, so I'll keep fucking complaining, and do the job of a competent consumer. You should never let this slide. 
---
Xbox player here, I've played almost every day since beta...I've maybe dealt with 3 or 4 instances of griefers at the most, not saying you're wrong but it's definitely not a lawless wasteland out there. 
---
But i have vast amount of nuka cola, cuz i'm a hoader not duper....
---
I love you. I probably won't be on tonight but I'll reach out maybe tomorrow night?
---
No, what they did is more clever.  They removed the stockpiles but did so in a way that no one could claim that a legitimate item was erased or that they were unknowing buyers, thus preserving goodwill.  They also likely flagged accounts with lots of duped items for further monitoring.  And I bet they embedded ways to monitor future duplicating either on an item basis or person basis.  It is a very thoughtful, balanced way of approaching the topic. 
---
We removed duped items ~waves hands~
---
Meanwhile all duped items still exist and there is no tangible difference to the game.
---
Thanks 🙏 
---
market76 and fallout76bizaar i think
---
No? 
---
Only issue I had was having problems joining my kid in his games... but then I found out the dumb origin launcher had a "start invisible" mode and you can join friends while invisible.  Origin is NOT steam by far.
---
The game ran GREAT for me and I played for like 20 hours that weekend.
---
True. New Vegas kicks ass, but they actually made the Tesla Rifle more powerful than Fallout 4. Which is strange. Everything else is weaker. It makes no sense at all.
---
That's silly man. That's not how guilt works. If you buy some stolen electronics from someone on Ebay for 2 bucks and the cops find out... you aren't in trouble, you didnt commit a crime and there is no way to prove if you knew they were stolen or not. Idk where you live but in the US you are innocent until proven guilty,  we don't assume guilt just because we think it looks very suspicious and the person should have known. Bethesda would need to come out and say "Do not gather more than a certain amount of any type of item or we will ban you."... that would tank them.
---
They took everything but one item per stack. If they removed all duped items, some players who thought their items were legit would be gone.
---
Put yourself in that position.
---
Level 245 and you're calling it a massive failure dumpster fire? Why did you even play? Seems like you played yourself. 
---
Yes. Something like that. Lol! I have a Mazda cx5 and once visited a forum for Mazda owners just to check for some advice about my car. Uhm.... well. According to some of those i met there i should just sell it and get a 10 year older Mazda. 
---
It affected everyone by lagging/crashing the servers. This is a known effect of duping.
---
Stupidly, they only went after dupers and mules who had massive stacks of duped weapons / armour. So as long as a duper offloaded his Ill gotten gains, they’re safe.
---
To make it even worse, instead of just deleting their fucking accounts, or stripping them of all items &amp; caps, Bethesda only deleted the stacks of items except one, still leaving them with their high value stuff.
---
IIRC some claimed that stuff done during the BETA wasn't counting towards those numbers.
---
Yup, they would rather have exploiters as concurrent players for their earnings calls than actually put the game on the right track.
---
My team actually stays the hell away from cars because they're pretty sure I'm going to blow them all up.
---
Oh shut up and take my upvote, you witty bastard lol
---
Yup. Having to wade through a mile long list of keys to find the ore I picked up is a pain. 
---
Hypothetical scenario....
---
If one has a girlfriend/gay boyfriend (or are the girlfriend/gay boyfriend), chances are good that there's a vibrator in the house.  One could set it up to rest on the mouse or controller, use the low setting, and go have dinner or vacuum the house.  When you come back, you're probably close to $25k richer.
---
If one doesn't have a girlfriend or vibrator, then one has all the time in the world to click manually.  It wouldn't be the only activity they have to do manually.
---
Looks like they erased all the duplicates.   But left 1 item.
---
So if a super had 100 TSE shotguns they now have 1.
---
Yes I was sad to see still 600, I though maybe I had read it wrong that someone just said 800. 
---
I've been waiting for Bethesda to fix the duped items everywhere before I'd come back and play in a more legitimate environment.
---
Should have known better.  They're just giving up and letting people keep it all with this approach. 
---
Now, not only do I not have an untainted set of servers to play on, but I'm behind in both levels and item quality because I went out of my way to make sure I avoided cheated items.   I'd be a second class citizen on any server because I wanted to play without the influence of cheaters everywhere, and so is any potential new player to the game.
---
Why would anyone new pick up this game now? RIP any remaining future sales.
---
Praise be to Vault Boy Jesus.
---
Yeah, but the union uniform with a grey knit cap actually looks pretty good.
---
yay im irrelevant woooo i love you :).
---
Yea..... before asking for a pony you ask for a whale first. 
---
No sweat.  I won't be on tonight either.  The screws aren't going anywhere.
---
I wish they'd give the one that randomly disappeared from my inventory that I got legitimately back. Complete a quest, BAM, TSE shotgun just gone last Sunday. 
---
lol not you, just the experience from yesterday
---
I had a feeling this would happen, and it is a good thing. No one was quiet about selling duplicated items, I was getting multiple offers a day at one point. I turned them all down. I have a very hard time believing that anyone who bought duplicated items didn't know what they were doing. Honestly all these posts about "the real victims" sound like crybaby duplicators that are upset that they must play the game like the rest of us now.
---
Okay thanks.
---
no im not letting it slide but im not gonna blame the wrong people either thats pure blind hate 
---
Well that's not true.  I just ate a very pleasing Reesee's Cup.  It's not even *good* chocolate, but I enjoyed it.  I don't have impossible standards.
---
&gt; dumpster fire.
---
Oh look, he said that funny word again! Look everybody!
---
Try this.  It’s something I started testing yesterday and for me it works every time.  Sometimes I have to select several players on the list before getting one I can join but hasn’t failed me for getting back to my stuff or even trading items between my characters.

" I have Super Mutants to go shoot in the face "  
---
Am I the only one who missed how you could target the groin in VATS in FO1 and 2? Why did they ever remove that?
---
Don't forget the mountain of screws and springs.
---
&gt;Just work on PVE stuff, nobody asked for PVP in Fallout.
---
I think it's nice that they're working on both. Everybody wins. 
---
&gt;  I don't think anyone cares about events and challenges, they're more of an annoyance than anything else.
---
I really enjoy them. It's nice to have these unpredictable timed challenges to rise to which you can opt into or out of at your own discretion. 
---
i never understood that people who level 245 and complain 
---
I got a regular dragon on XB1 if anyone wants it for free .. can't remember the level, either a 35 or 45, nothing special about it ..
---
Unless you PVP why would you care what anyone else is doing.   Your solo experience is not impacted.  
---
The maintenance parking lot behind Whitesprings
---
It’s because you have extra pieces of regular armor in your inventory. That will cause it.  Get them out of your inventory and it should solve your problem. 
---
1) Write a post saying they are removing items
---
2) ...
---
3) Profit
---
Wow what a sweeping, tangible change to the game!
---
More accurately it's either 45 or 50 depending on the specific weapon or armor piece
---
Sure, double wear for double bullets, but you no longer get double damage. So with the nerf to 20% damage on the second bullet, it should only do 20% wear too.
---
They're not innocent, they know enough to be at fault.
---
Any chance you are looking into Syringer DoT damage or can look into Syringer DoT damage? Possibly switch it from an extend duration on recast to something that can stack?
---
Even the Radscorpion Venom barrel takes 2 shots to kill a level 6 Scorched. That's a minimum of 12ish seconds to kill a single level 6 creature. Against so many other creatures, the poison damage is entirely negated or not even worth using due to how low it is.
---
Also, the reload is broken. The entire 4 second reload animation time blocks you from using other weapons when you hotswap away from it. And it leaves the Syringer empty.
---
In its current state, it's just an item that applies a 25% DR reduction and no other real use.
---
Last night during one session I had to select a few different people as join game didn’t show up under their profile.  After the 4th person join game was selectable.  Wonder if that’s the same thing you are seeing.  I have maybe 20 friends on Xbox and haven’t had a problem joining random people who aren’t on my list.  Maybe it’s a setting ??
---
That’s always hysterical 
---
I have zero duped items, I have only gear I crafted and the All Rise from doing the quest, I am level 70. Guess I should have gotten a full suit of armor and weapons seeing how everyone got to keep these illegitimate items...
---
When it fits it fits. Keep your blinders on bucko.
---
Mmmm... murder-family bacon...
---
&gt;But we need PVE content. We need it now or at least we need to know what we will get.
---
Be careful not to conflate what you want with what the game needs.
---
What I want, as someone who is only level 43 despite playing since release because I only get to play a few hours a day at most, is fixes and balances. I don't need new content yet because my play style hasn't resulted in my going through all the content that's already there yet. I would argue that the majority of players a probably in a similar situation as I am, but I don't have any statistics to back that up so that's just my "feeling". And yes, you could argue fixes should have been done before release - but the fact of the matter is, every MMO spends the first few months focusing mainly on balancing/fixes and rarely adds new content. That's pretty standard across the sector.
---
&gt;They are stalling. 
---
Why would they be stalling?
---
&gt;And the PVP server... How they made it the priority.
---
I mean, making a PVP server takes a lot less time than making new content. I can see why it's coming first.
---
&gt;And you can't use the "carrot" strategy if no one knows what the carrot is.
---
So basically you're upset because you don't know what new content is coming. Got it.
---
Guess the yoke is on you now huh buddy?  
---
I remember the first game I played with a "keyring" object you could get and it was brilliant. Arcanum. Keys each took up one square but you could buy a keyring that took up 2 squares, but it would hold all the keys you ever found in just those 2 inventory squares.
---
dude they know nothing what you not getting if they knew shit be fixed by now hell the studio opened a week or 2 before fo76
---
Once new things get added I'll definitely come back but no extended stays in Appalachia... then again I need to level but now it's bothersome kinda....
---
I think it goes to show I gave it a chance as long as I could, I did everything, I know the game and I know it's terrible.
---
Nope, that's been there.
---
Will the update be on Xbox ? Or is it out already
---
This game is just not good. Its good that you like it and have fun but its the worst made Bethesda game of all time and praising them in anyway will ensure they deliver the same quality 
---
Yeah they removed only stacks, so if you had only 1 you are fine, if you had 10, you would of been left with 1
---
See, told you he wasnt a duper. Trust the DJ.
---
I just want to point that until the duping problem is directly addressed, it won't fix the economy problem.
---
At this point, dupers just need to advertise what guns they currently have, and dupe directly for sales, never having more than one on hand for more than a few minutes.
---
Obviously this is less convenient, but not terribly *in*convenient in the grand scheme of things.
---
It's called making an informed decision through extensive play, it's not a knee jerk.
---
Seriously if you're this angry over the game why continue playing it, all the way to 245 that had to have taken hundreds of hours.
---
I would leave this sub for the same reasons but the Bethesda community guys are here and its a good sub to get infomation from about patches ect...  
---
The vocal group of people though.... well lets just say they need a little more sugar in their tea
---
dude use a plastic bag for your dirty clothes next time
---
Candles and succulent plants can fit if you're very careful. Candles give it a nice glow when the door is closed.
---
I agree with most of this but losing faith in Bethesda is completely justified. This game and all the merchandise around it has been on the same level of greed as EA.
---
You don't let people slide when you pay full price, they could have declined to make the game but they thought they could and failed to deliver, it's on them too.
---
Drinking Nuka Dark should give us plastic!
---
That's how I see it too, dupe 50 items and sell them to 50 people - everyone has 1 item and therefor doesn't trigger their "duped item" warning. Likely they don't even know if the items were duped or not, just removing them if people have a bunch of the same one. 
---
Nuka Cola plant is a decent spot for some parking lot fun.
---
That does not convey emphatically enough..
---
 Its the best Fallout game so far. I spend a few hours every day wandering, and doing my Whitespring visit. I pretty well quit fast travel. Try it it rocks. ;)
---
PA paints, gun paints, and armor paints should have been in the base game.
---
Bwahahaha
---
Unfortunately for me the list always comes up blank.
---
I don't solo, and I want to PVP. Where am i saying otherwise?
---
I'm really interested to see how much space I've reclaimed from invisible duped items that I believe are in my stash and inventory.  I have had a lot of instances where things like inserting single fusion cores into power armor  come will show as (4) in the armor's inventory and I wonder how many transfer into my inventory as extra weight only.
---
Nice try, Bethesda. 
---
Can you make my armor not show over my nuka girl costume? In the last patch chest armor shows over it now. 
---
So go play something else if you're that bored. 
---
I didn't notice that entire building for the first month. 
---
It depends on the duping method.
---
I, personally, know nothing about how items are duped, so I'm going purely on speculation. But I know that various methods have been fixed over the past patches, and one that I've heard about is so involved it requires crashing the server.
---
So, I don't think that a "on sale" basis is going to be very convenient at all, and if it devolves to the point where crashing the server is the only way to dup, then Beth. can just track which players are frequently in servers that crash and investigate from there.
---
Yeah this was a horrible fix.
---
I was just at the whitespring train vendor and there were 3 AA supersledge all 3* with same mods, 5 Asassin grognaks 3* same mods (2 were stacked), and 2 auto grenade launcher 3* same mods.
---
I am guessing all a duper has to do is lower the durability of their dupes after duping them and they can still have as many as they want. The 2 that were stacked can be explained by 1 in inventory and 1 in stash at time of purge.
---
Horrible fix, they should have wiped every single dupe including the original, and banned anyone with stacks.
---
Not stupid.   Best overall business decision.  
---
Agreed.  Well done.  This could have gone how we all feared it would and it went the best possible scenario.
---
I enjoy the game. Sure there isn’t a whole lot to do for me anymore except events and trying to collect plans and rare stuff and the game isn’t perfect ( let’s be honest, no fallout has been bug free at launch) but I still love the fallout series. There will be more to do soon as they add more which I’m looking forward too.  
---
Please, what? 😊 
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession\_of\_stolen\_goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_of_stolen_goods)
---
If you knew what you were buying was stolen, yeah, actually, it IS a crime, and you CAN be in significant trouble. Like 'federal charges' trouble in some cases.
---
I'm just happy that I don't have to throw away ammo and grenades anymore. I don't min-max like many players here so my build isn't exactly efficient. Every bullet collected is important lol.
---
Perhaps how you can filter things by weight, value or type?
---
Oh, no... I said fuck. Did I hurt your delicate sensibilities?
---
I’m just telling you what the ramifications are for that which you have no sympathy. Just asking you if you actually care if the game dies when a large number of people log on to have no good weapons and quit. And your irrelevant legal explanation is irrelevant. 
---
Also just letting you know it was never said that traded goods were subject to deletion on whim. If they had said that, we’d be on notice. Now that they’re punishing people for using the only controllable means to get better equipment - a major game feature - people aren’t going to want to keep playing. 
---
And that’s nice your weapon wasn’t duped - I’m sure you have even less sympathy now for other people. 
---
As I have stated I gave it a chance. This sub started out saying how shitty it was that streamers  and reviewers never gave this game enough time, I prayed this game would be good and gave it a lot of my time to really see how bad it truly is before making a very informed decision.
---
And you thought this was the right way to address the issue you have with something about the game? Over a month after you've already stopped playing? 
---
I can't comprehend this logic I'm sorry. Goodluck with whatever you set out to do here.
---
Dude, is all the fun you have with this game really just getting a special gun and a special set of power armor? That’s what fun is? I see so many others trying different builds based on their equipment. I don’t think you mean it that way, but you are putting a lot of pressure on finding the perfect in game item which are purposefully hard to get. I get it though, i hate grinding and redoing quests over and over again, so I don’t. But experience the game it was meant to be, where you have to make due with what you find in the wasteland. 
---
I thought the "Save my stuff" mod had been broken since the January patch, and now prevents you buying/selling to vendors altogether?
---
No... it's still fun to blow up other people's basics with my friends. I paid for the game and can play it however I want. Lol
---
heheh that's great.  Thanks!

I’m the guy on the rooftop at whitsprings.
---
The top like 10 posts are all people saying this fix is awesome.
---
Then next week the top 10 will be bitching again.
---
Welcome to reddit (and by extension social media)
---
They didn’t delete any of my duped guns, ammo, or aid really. They only deleted my million nuka colas :(
---
Still have dozens of TSE weapons and hundreds of thousands of ammo on my mule.
---
Thank you for your service. 
---
Correct. 
---
Hell yes I did, pay 60 dollars and get trash for it, someone has to have the balls to call it like it is.
---
If you didn't enjoy it then nothing has really changed from a game play perspective so do with that what you will.
---
i like grinding..which obviously..this game has a lot of..i can spend hours trying to get plans..while also clearing out all the enemies in the area..ever since the first time i went to whitesprings..i was hooked..high level area..with a wide range of enemies..with really good drops..there always seems to be a lot of action there..i know that area like the back of my hand..also i like giving other wastelanders aid, legendaries, etc..this is my first online game too..so i like the marketplace..ive traded with probably 50 redditors on here
---
Yes... if it can be proven that you knew it was stolen so my point stands. We cant prove it here or in the scenario I presented. 
---
You can't ban your only remaining players?
---
SNACK CAKES.  
---
ALL THE SNACK CAKES.
---
Funnily enough, there is a law against handling of salmon in suspicious circumstances here in the UK, which means if there waa reason to believe it was stolen, you could be arrested for it.
---
We get it you're upset. 
---
Take servers down, change nothing.
---
"Wow, what an awesome job Bethesda."
---
The placebo effect.
---
On your bike then kid
---
How about just something to make my Excavator Armor any color but yellow?
---
Definitely a pro-tip.
---
Your post says that you play solo....
---
There's a lot more that goes into making a game than whether people bitch about it on Reddit.  Game devs aren't dogs who you can scold for peeing on the rug.  Hell, that kind of training doesn't even work on dogs.
---
Does Bulk Still Auto-Scrap? Ive not been playing waiting for that to get fixed.
---
I set up a public resource base once... fully equipped to extract everything, with defence turrets everywhere, cooking facility, water purifier, crafting table... easy as...
---
I just couldn't get anyone on the server to accept an invite to my group so that it'd pass ownership to them... 
---
Not everyone has a mic
---
God I love your username. 
---
I think at E3 you probably could have nuked anywhere, infact this was definately the case up until the youtubers got to go to that event before launch as a nuke was dropped just south of the vault for them, so that green barrier zone was added knowing how dropping nukes on the low level areas would just fuck up new players
---
I’d like to see an assaultron or sentry bot with protest signs
---
If, IF, they have this capability and foresight, that would be amazing...
---
Also needed, it's not good enough
---
Assuming you mean is it safe to use, the answer is yes. I've tried various reshades and they all are fine. No issues at all.
---
is the purge done or still going on ? 
---
i have at least one weapon i know for a fact was duped and its still sitting in my inventory, i know for a fact because the guy i was trading with had 7000+ of that gun 
---
I'm 90% sure that's coming eventually. I don't understand the "Bot Stop" stations with interactive terminals otherwise....
---
Ban? That is a bit harsh. I personally didnt dupe, but im sure i benefited from those that did. Banning would be not help the community. Fixing the main issues in the game would be a better focus...
---
Haha.  Thanks!  I wish it were based on reality.  Man, I have to pee right now.  As always.
---
-lawyer guy who has defended several possession of stolen goods cases
---
I don't really want to give people ideas, so I'm not going to be specific, but I can think of another way or two keep business going fairly unaffected if I were in the business at all.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm happy they did something, and it was a first good step. But let's not act like everything is fixed and the market is effectively dupe-free now.
---
Grow some thicker skin. Wait, I beg you're a millennial. 🤣
---
5 events today and nothing but same old crap, so u got lucky i think
---
Yeah... I'm in the US so we belive everyone is innocent until proven guilty. That's some weird anecdotal evidence you got there though.
---
So banning for using a reshade mod is nothing to be worried about? 
---
I don’t own a bike. 
---
Wish I did, it’s a nice day outside for once. Beautiful riding weather. 
---
I have game voice chat turned off simply because I want to be left the fuck alone lol
---
Honestly i dont agree. If you wanna complain you can complain, nothing is stopping me from saying what I think what i want and what i like. Just like you did with this post. 
---
I think your decision of getting out of this sub is the right one and i have done it before in other subs i liked in the beginning.
---
either way still be pretty tedious..
---
but as the old saying goes.. 20$ is 20$..
---
Most of the time we do in the UK too, we just have that one wierd law that isn't really used anymore 
---
Is it giving you an unfair advantage? 
---
Honestly though just use Nvidia Freestyle, you can reshade without even touching the game since it just works as a filter that goes over your game.
---
You don't have to be a lawyer to know the law my freind.
---
Instead of just increasing the stash limit over and over it would be nice to just have the base materials weight nothing then have the stash limit be somewhere around 500.  That way the only thing the limit affects is armor, weapons and consumables. Also non broken down junk would still weigh something.  
---
Right, i hate it when even npc enemies are just far enough for ur turrets to not fire. But will sit and shoot at ur shit til its all broken lol. Im always running pacifist but u shouldn't still take damage lol dumbest thing ive ever heard. The only use for pacifist is not accidentally shooting someone and gettin a bounty
---
Don't you look stupid now?
---
my god your a tard bgs Austin was legit never even part of the game making process it legit bethesda throwing a game into a lap of someone who works underthem to finish they cant say no or they dont get payed this aint charity work shit bethesda dont own just one company they own a few and zenimax owns them all
---
He is saying your Bethesda trying to catch people using the mod.
---
It's like I've always said, everyone nowa' days is so cynical and doom and gloom, you could give someone a million dollars for free and they'd find a problem with it
---
"Awww man now I gotta go to the bank...I gotta get dressed...and drive...and spend my day there...and then I gotta find stuff to spend it on...maaaaan..."
---
good tip. Thanks.
---
Maybe you just need to grow skin in general. Wait, I bet you’re a baby boomer since we’re throwing out meaningless titles. 
---
I suspect the patch added ways to help identify duping going forward.   
---
I'd suggest checking out r/fo76FilthyCasuals . It's a much more upbeat and positive subreddit, for people who just want to relax and have fun. 
---
Who had four of the exact same thing and thought it was legit?
---
Lol. strange 
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Alright! Don’t forget to wear your best fedora.
---
Welcome to generation slowflake where for $30, you are entitled to a multi billion dollar company to make your own personal game. 
---
yet you got enough play to worth 60$ if your at level 245 i can see if someone at level 70 or 50 
---
Check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals . I suspect you'll dig it. 
---
This wasn't ever fixed in the first place. 
---
I am level 70 and still having lots of fun, recently convinced 2 of my friends to get the game so that just adds to the fun :) 
---
Well, nobody is trying to ruin anybody's fun here. It's pretty egoistic to think that the dissatisfaction is aimed at you. 
---
People are angry about being lied to and fucked over by moneybags in charge multi billion dollar companies. And the only thing at their disposal, and the only thing that really works, is voicing their emotions as loud as possible over the internet. That's it, plain and simple.
---
It's not about you. 
---
I have fun in the game. I can have fun just shooting level 1 Scorched on my farm. I can have fun just wandering in a random direction and finding some new location I never knew existed. I really love this game and I can have fun in that mode. But then there is another mode. Another personality. I want perfection. I have a dream. Maybe it is all Heavy Combat Armor with the perfect stats. That would be nice. That is a future goal. Something I might keep playing for. But why does it have to be so tiresome and frustrating and boring to get just one or two of those stats on any random piece of armor? I don't mind grinding. I hope they introduce player vending soon so I can specialize in selling something. Maybe I will sell some nice cooked food. Maybe I will sell some herbs. Maybe I will sell magazines! I don't know. Then I could be a magazine hunter and seller. Or Bobbleheads. Or anything really. I can choose what trade I want to do. Then I can try to buy the perfect item when I have enough money. But the game says "You have to fast travel 7 vendors every day for caps". Oh darn I don't like that. And if you want a 0001% chance to get some item you have to go on a feedy frenzy at Whitespring nuke zone like a ravenous hungry dog fighting over scraps of wood armor. The game can be so much more than that. I hope it will be.
---
I was referring to the loot method in Path of Exile where trading is completely disabled, not that I actually play solo.
---
I play with my wife and a friend.
---
Check out r/fo76FilthyCasuals . I'm subscribed there, here, and believe it or not even r/Fallout, still. They all serve the same purpose, but casuals is the most "fun" of the lot. 
---
I’d like a murdered version of excavator PA.
---
Same right now
---
Maybe they shouldn't have rolled out a mess of a game? Today is the first time they did something that surprised me in a good way. This is the first good sign I've seen for this game. It seems that someone at Bethesda actually stopped and listened to people's complaints about losing items they spent a lot of time to get, and they took pity and did not wipe everything. Well played.
---
I have been shitting on the game a lot in the last month, right up until last night even because I expected them to just wipe it all, but I am pleasantly surprised today at how they handled the dupes. Now they just need to fix drops, and above all else add some worthy endgame PvE content, and I will most likely come back.
---
we need a chat, lately I often ran into high ass npcs who beat the sh\*t out of me and I can't ask for help ;\_;
---
60 dollars for hundreds of hours of entertainment warrants an opinion of it but people have been trashing it since day 1, no balls required and it doesn't make you any different than the others that have done it.
---
Thanks for sharing. Ironic you are upset that others are sharing too. If what others are saying is upsetting you, maybe it's time for you to stop reading what they are saying, not demand they stop saying it.
---
Never been a problem before 
---
You can piss right off with attitude sonny Jim!  You're not wanted here! Boo! Hiss! You don't belong! 
---
Still have all of my duped items lol
---
LEGENDARY dog helmet! Fits ANY DOG anywhere.
---
I personally don't like voice chat but i wish I had the ability to type to communicate. The emotes are very limited and pretty useless.
---
To scratch that Fallout itch.
---
I was very apprehensive about F76 when it was first introduced; I'm not usually a fan of multiplayer games, and the idea of no NPC's concerned me.
---
I bought the game for half-price a month later, after 3 patches were released.  I resided to the thought that I can't judge a game for what's not in it, but only on its own merits.  I got over the no human NPC thing and it not being what I would have originally liked it to be.
---
I spent dozens upon dozens of hours scavenging through every nook &amp; cranny in 3, New Vegas &amp; 4, it was one of my favourite things to do in those games.
---
I enjoy the random encounters with other players, and paying it forward, helping lower level players, because the same was done for me.  Crafting weapons with upgraded parts that they won't be able to make for a good while, that sort of thing.
---
I'm in my 166th hour of it now.  I've enjoyed the process of getting my camp from a bed, stash box &amp; cooking stove on a wooden foundation up to a much better camp.  I've had my camp in the same place for about 150hrs now, I'm thinking about moving it somewhere else.
---
The launch of the game really could have been so much better, but what's done is done.
---
I'm not forcing myself to enjoy the game, I really like it, and I believe that it's only going to get better.
---
Stay off my game
---
Sweet, now make a mod for it so it can shoot you (the owner) while you're in the safety of your home/desk.
---
[](/celestia)Funny thing is they seemed to work fine in the beta. Wonder why they took them out.
---
I sound like a douche, i realize that. But to be clear, I played since release at a fast pace, yes (but that's how I play games, I guess) but I kept playing until the end of January. All my friends quit the game and I kept going because I had hope and I love the game. Meanwhile, notes after notes all I saw was promises and possibilities, then more promises, more content coming soon, vaults opening in the future, then new content and then a shift in priorities. Now the new content coming soon has a name but nothing was really shown, only a glimpse to the new pvp server, the one thing I believe the majority of us don't want. I played a lof of mmos and I can tell you this is not an mmo. I mean, It's only massive in map size. I sincerely hope this new content comes soon and have the replayability (is that how you say it?) a lot us desperately need. 
---
Story and gameplay haven't changed. Only bug fixes and nerfs here and there. Just might not be a game for you. 
---
Suggestion: stop with the red and white fairy lights and the pink combat armor skin and give player what they want, to make their power armor feared in the wastes, not love heart emoji icons. 
---
His point was that you should exclusively blame Bethesda corporate, not the tiny Dev team that was given an impossible task by said company. They're trying the best with what they know. You should be made that Bethesda as a company isn't devoting more to HELP them fix the game.
---
You're blaming the blacksmith with worn out tools because his suppliers won't give him anything good to use. 
---
There's a few issues but I usually find a way around them. Energy weapons weak. Trashed all of them. Quest broken? Just play another. Still lot's to do. They are trying to fix things. I will give them a chance.
---
And we're not text only. Plus memes and shitposts
---
Seriously. This game needs a keyring so bad. I’m sick of scrolling through all of them and ya can’t drop em either...
---
It was just a joke, since you were asking about using a mod. 
---
So I guess if they adjusted inventory, then they must be pretty confident they squashed the bug. That's good news.
---
I would love to have a 'for sale' tab. So I can quickly sort stuff for vendors or give to nice peeps in my CAMP.
---
Does rifles count as 2 handed weapons? For perk cards
---
Well, the first statement they put out did not accurately communicate what they were planning.  The first statement said they were going to be wiping duped items and if you had any duped items then they'd be gone. 
---
Then they released a statement saying ***what they actually did.***  Simply put, what they actually did wasn't the same thing they claimed they had planned. 
---
Where are you getting those numbers?
---
Actually I have...I have it in a notebook. And in doing so I have found out that not all plans are able to be bought at vendors. And the venders are tier based (obv). Most all vendors of common tier have the same plans with the exception of 1 or 2 plans. 
---
True, but transferring items right now is a pain unless you have 2 accounts or friends that will login when you need.
---
I feel you.  Come and try the chill atmosphere in r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
However I am waiting to see if for some reason these fixed plans reset. So far they haven't. 
---
I’m pretty sure you can check the actual CAMP item itself to check who it belongs to :) (IE: the thing that looks like a projector.)
---
I read about a guy in the UK who was sent to prison for 2 years for throwing some bacon at a mosque. That's crazy.
---
Players who unknowingly have duplicated items are not exploiters. Think before you speak. There are far more players who knowingly and unknowingly have duped items than there are people duplicating. 
---
Finally this bug was so annoying
---
Roses are red, your camp is cool. If you do nuke me, I will become ghoul.
---
Nope. Too late. Ya done goofed up. They’ve already seen it and are patching it right now, lol! 🤣 jk
---
All you are doing is changing color intensity, balance, etc. It has no effect on the game itself. Bethesda has gone to great effort to not allow the usual kind of mods that can radically alter gameplay, allow cheating, etc. but reshades are fine...I've had no issues at all, as I said.
---
Anything about underpowered pistols? Theres no armor penetration perk for pistols. 
---
the limit is fine. except for plans, there is no built in meta/mechanic that drains currency out of the economy.
---
desirable special items in every multi-player game eventually become worth more than whatever the maximum currency limit is and are only traded for other similar high value items.
---
True. Maybe ask for a separate stash with small limit that share among characters in one account. 
---
I'm going to start again just to spite you both. See you in the wasteland smoothskins.
---
Because they cant have a game with less players than servers.
---
It looks like they made their Nuka pass on accounts that also had weapons/armor so you may be safe.
---
Love you 
---
(figure of speech)
---
And how it's happing. 
---
Literally from bethesda themselves.  
---
Everyone expected this massive wave of "justice" bans and instead got a piss stream
---
Because YouTube says so. XD
---
Maybe they could put some content in the Atom Shop. That might motivate the pencil pushers. 
---
Good luck. They’re looking into having Pacifist Mode apply to camps to prevent them from taking player damage. Probably gonna be implemented long before player vending, lol. 
---
Why the fuck would I want too turn voice chat on and hear little screaming 12 years all the time
---
That is a difference of opinion.
---
I consider exploiting a compromised market exploiting.
---
Bethesda doesn't, you don't. In that sense you have won. Enjoy.
---
I wholeheartedly agree with you. This game can be so much more and I hope it will be. I don’t like grinding, I haven’t even seen the SBQ. I’m building my base and hoping I find something good when I get cornered by a legendary.  I’m still enjoying the exploration, but I hope they have big plans to add more. I hope for some more abilities to make towns and vendors because I’d really like to rebuild the wasteland. 
---
&gt;...you were affected by the xp nerfs...
---
I honestly couldn't care less.
---
Someone commented in another thread that it’s still happening, unfortunately. 
---
Sort by weight.
---
i got assblasted even with pacifist on lmao
---
The game isnt finished... its still in terrible shape.. other companies don’t have a game with these many problems ever. Apex legends is free and and runs smooth af. Because they finished the game before release. 
---
Yeh that's what I mean when I say shop my dude, the atom shop. 
---
So if you bought something from a yard sale that was stolen but you had no idea it was stolen you believe you should be put in jail for it? 
---
They should add gilded power armor skins and could do gilded for other armors
---
Yeah, I can confirm that I don't play the game fast any more. Only normal speed for me please!
---
Where did I say you couldn't complain?
---
I am talking about the manner in which you do it. Are you an adult? or a petulant child? That is the question. You are going to get way further in life if you can calmly and politely articulate feedback, concerns, issues, criticism, etc. 
---
Mmm doubt it
---
Can there be decent power armor skins in the gameworld or as rewards from quests and events instead?
---
Keep your blinders on 😎
---
I'm not complaining about there not being enough resources. I know where to find them, but when I can't play long enough to harvest without being kicked, it's a problem. 
---
Perhaps I should have been more clear. I suppose I should have asked, "Is the game stable enough for me to have a decent play session without crashes or being kicked from the server, or should I just wait?"
---
Just any-fucking-thing other than pink skins in the atom shop, it's a joke because they cost a lot of money
---
I can force time into games easily, I have over 1300 hours in for Honor for reference.
---
Thats not a shower thought, it is just a suggestion. 
---
Its because complainers get upvotes. I have a feeling half of the people bitching don’t even play. 
---
i’ll message you 
---
Gosh, I may not be perpetually encumbered anymore. At least for a few minutes. 
---
I'm already subbed to both of those, only Issue is that like I said above, the Bethesda community guys are on this sub and I like to try and keep up with what they are saying and have an input there.  
---
Filthy Casuals is good if you dont want bitterness, Fallout is good if you want to hear people talk shit about all of the fallouts except new vegas
---
People always zero in on what they're looking for. There's plenty of posts praising Bethesda and the newest patch, and there's posts bemoaning it. Readers are going to gravitate to the drama that they want to see.
---
American laws do.
---
Receiving Stolen Property
---
Possession of Stolen Goods
---
Asset Forfeiture
---
FO4 taught me to blow up the car before I approach. Otherwise I might brush up against it and insta-die. 
---
then are you losing anything in reality 
---
We have updated the list to include further additions coming in Patch 6 (and beyond) based on your comments and feedback. Thank you for continuing to let us know what you're experiencing and what you'd like to see. Keep your feedback coming. 
---
They all deserve their fate.
---
Bethy is too greedy now for this to have gone well anyway
---
i remember in December someone wanted to do me that in watoga but i just fly towards a high building and started to spam hearts while he was really fking mad trying to catch me with jumps lol
---
Just anything, it's not good enough at the moment, I want to impress people I come across, but pink armor? I'll be laughed out of the server
---
Yes, I'm losing hope in the gaming industry as a whole.
---
Yes and it should be more stable now after the server side stability fixes. Are you using the junk yard? I get kicked when I take that workshop. To the point where I'm afraid to fast travel. What materials are you trying to get?
---
Yeah, even if they've managed to fix the exploits, they should really look into adding a serial number into the inventory tables. That way if someone manages to find a new exploit, and you know people are going to be actively looking, the underlying issue is already fixed and it's a non-issue.
---
 Mine is on all the time and I get that kind of thing very rarely. I am an asshole about it while I'm in range and maybe some people may have got the message. ;)
---
Troubleshooter's "I AIN'T A COMMIE" to kill those damned Liberators...
---
Question for all:  Is there any way to make a TSE minigun useful?  Specific mods or perks?
---
Scripts like this are absolutely trivial to make with popular tools like AutoHotkey.
---
meh im not as long as i enjoy some games im happy to pay like re2 remake
---
Thanks for the offer but I don't really need help with resources. I guess I wasn't clear in my post, or maybe I came off as unduly critical. I was asking more about the game's stability than anything. All I was saying is I can't harvest if I keep getting booted off the server.
---
Should print a canvas bag to go along with it.
---
They are busy destroying other people's bases with their not duped weapons
---
k game hitler next time my coffee wrong im blaming you 
---
even like 2 points in white knight is enough.
---
The prices are expensive yeah but with it being Valentine's day that's why we got pink armor and heart icons, they've been doing this for holidays since Christmas. Personally I find most of the games I've played that have a Valentine's day event don't have good unique items for it. Destiny just added red armor and a chocolate ghost. I agree the prices are too high.
---
You must play Rust and eat cans of beans.
---
Gotta maintain those concurrent players.
---
Look, this sub is the single most optimistic place to see anything fo76 related. Just because it's been negative recently (and rightfully so, most of us have poured lots of hours and time into the game expecting it to get better at a pace bethesda apparently could not handle) doesn't mean it's not also constructive and or positive. 
---
The issue here is that you don't understand what a community is. If there are issues, then those are going to bubble forth. Reddit isn't one person, it's a conglomerate of different people with different views. Every community is impossible to please because everyone inside that community has different values, ideas and hopes. Treating any community as if it's one solid person with unified beliefs (an echo chamber) is ignorant. There are plenty of people around who are happy, but those people are content and busy enjoying the game, it's called the silent majority. The ones who have an axe to grind because of a missing item that vanished or other shitty bug are the ones you see here complaining.
---
Again, take into consideration this subreddit has 170 thousand subs, yet I see the same two or three dozen people in every negative thread. It's not so much an echo chamber as its a gathering place for people to have a voice. The game is in a nasty spot in many ways so you're going to hear nasty things. 
---
You're being totally hypocritical and a bit ignorant with this post.
---
It's been awhile since I've been on, so I can't remember exactly where I was trying to harvest resources, but I think it was mostly aluminium I was after. 
---
I was using that resource map that's been posted all over Reddit as reference.
---
But you weren't really choosing anything more than path a or b and in most cases you were gonna do b if you didn't talk to anyone.
---
For what it's worth there is one npc you talk to and get quests from... Eh technically two, I even got a choice in the quests that followed. They didnt add anymore to the game and was less impressive then some of the stories I read from suvivors on terminals from days leading up to the war.
---
Corpses are the same as saying "I lost" especially when some ones journal reads "last entry:I'm gonna get even with x over at y" only to discover a corpse in a cage with another corpse, that had to mean they are caught rescuing some one else.
---
This game is okay with the story line but you have to look for it. For kids that are just gonna blaze though and kill everything and not give a shit about said story they will hardly miss it since it's not a npc in their face.
---
 They're probably would have shot said npc anyway and fucked up a quest for anyone else.
---
Yep, me neither, have one brought, with TS nerf wouldn't even have that.
---
Thinks are already sorted pretty well. I don't really see the current UI as an issue
---
Yes also it is a potential cure for cancer.
---
They let people keep a single item of the dupes and only removed stacks, so you can still have a duped item .. Tod is watching you.
---
It's plans and outfits, who gives a shit.  The problem items are the ones that actually effect game balance and provide the dupers with the greatest profit, the weapons and armor.  
---
Ok have fun lmao
---
Also those good dialog choice were really more like am I going to be a good guy or an asshole, like selling that kid in the fridge to the slaver
---
I am subbed to both. Be careful. Everyone complained nothing is right with the game here. Filthy is all people saying there is nothing wrong with the game as it was in beta. (Also the average person is like level 15 with 2,000 hours played). 
---
I need a middle ground who likes playing but also sees room for improvment.
---
Probably the same people who cry about armor durability...
---
Everyone that is sick of this sub, go on over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals and enjoy the game with everyone there. Happy C.A.M.P.-ing!
---
Been doing this since fallout 3 but I have to say since 4 it's all the more satisfying (even if car explosions wouldn't produce mushroom clouds even if nuclear) lol
---
k 
---
In pink armor you'll be laughed out of the server, it's crap. They should check the nexus for inspiration. I want to look badass, not like a 7 year old girl in unicorn armor. 
---
What is this ArK Survival?! I do want that tho. 
---
lol you seriously just deleted your entire comment and rewrote it when I answered your question?
---
What bonuses are you getting out of the extra star?  Unique effects or doubling up on one of the previous bonus tiers?
---
Thank god I fasted for days on nothing but water and detoxifying teas before going for the test.   Err I mean I never duped an item before.  Never.  Nope.  Why are you looking at me like that?
---
It was Jet.   So much Jet....
---
Sorta. I can't really tell I want to say yes but I feel like it's a placebo effect. 
---
I have gotten two short non explosive and anti armor weapons from ghouls in whitesprings. Plenty of decent legendary drops. TSE is already badly nerfed and right now melee is king. I don’t see how anyone playing without TSE is second class

Whitesprings.....I think there is more than one chair there. I just got done crafting a rifle for a lvl 6, I was talking and nothing from him......I dropped the stuff and when he picked it up the little shit says thanks....I am glad he said thanks but the M.F. could have talked back when I was talking to him
---
Just because you own a duped item doesn't mean you are a duper, just means you got duped .. so not really fair to get banned even if you did have 5 items, now if you had say more than 10, that is questionable I suppose.
---
Sad times
---
Bethesda had a list of dupes they were intrested. They only scanned for those, and then only removed if people had several of the ame.
---
So if those were not on the list, perfectly believable.
---
Now ^ certainly seems plausable! 80.0 to be Bethesda correct.
---
When you see (optional) mission objectives thats basically the choosing another dialog path.
---
I personally would have preferred a wipe... or at least let me transfer my toon sans items to a clean server where I can be sure everything has been earned legitimately. 
---
Well now it’s thepeople who got duped stuff still get to keep a copy 
---
I completely agree that this should have been done. It should have been done months ago. I’ve been playing since launch, mind you I’ve defended this game to people who have bashed it  because it’s a great game with a lot of potential. But potential only goes so far. There is nothing else to do. And that’s what should be coming out now, not patches that should have come out months ago. 
---
22 strength, plus a psycho nets about 20 damage. Real powerful. Perks might get that up around 40. 
---
I understand the meme and joke here, but we don’t need more awful weapons clouding up the loot pool.
---
This is legitimately the only reason I kinda hope that being able to attack people's base even if they are in passive mode is never changed. Cause wanted players would hide in their firends indestructible base and every server would have someone doing this and there would be nothing to stop them
---
This same point has been made hundreds of times on these boards
---
Key chain option. One entry that labelled Key Chain and when you click it you get a menu with all you keys.
---
I just think the UI need a major clean up. finding stuff is a major pain.
---
There was no patch?
---
Join us.
---
I've used reshade since launch.  I have \~250 hours played and I'm fine so far.
---
Excuse me asking for a change... but...
---
Can RAW scrap be excluded from the stash limit?
---
You know each resource type at it's base level (oil, acid, steel, etc.) and what it's bulk version is... if you exclude these, you'll save a lot of stash space, and they're easy to track - so no impact on server performance...
---
Then when you 'stash your trash' it only stores the RAW and BULKED trash... not the 'unprocessed' trash...
---
Just saying... it won't mess too much with PackRat, because that's still important for grabbing everything that isn't bolted down.
---
I seen the part about the nuka colas and instantly got sad thinking my way of healing is gone ( have under 10 of each I've found in the world so I think I'm good lol) also Nuka Cola Cherry&gt; Stimpaks
---
Sexy. I’d love that. 
---
 They were good in fallout shelter lol
---
I'm not a fan of pink armor either,  Valentine's day sucks for video game events there's just not much you can do for it other than pink and red gear and turn things into chocolate. Maybe they could have added an outfit to dress up like Cupid but idk 
---
Does anyone know if you could tame rad scorpions?
---
Its maybe one of ten times I go through there, which isnt too often. I run over to the tracks and the little bridge just to see what spawns there when I sell stuff though. Pretty sure its always dropped garbage for me but thats standard for most 3* encounters. 
---
Reported spam.
---
How many stars can there be?
---
Some people want to play that way, that's their style. Love it or hate it, I got a couple people who are doing it soly to see people complain about them on Facebook or here.
---
Provide some evidence man, I wouldn't be surprised if this is true but the Bethesda Apoligist Brigade is going to tear you to shreds on this post if you don't show proof.
---
There is no way to know 100% that they were duped unless the seller says it. At the time without TSE you were severely disadvantaged in being able to damage mobs for loot and also in any PvP so had to get them to survive
---
Wait, so they didn't remove all the duped items?
---
Umm, just because the vast majority of characters didn't have stacks of duped items doesn't mean there aren't massive amounts of dupes out there. I know a couple of players who distributed massive (thousands) amounts of duped weapons. Those players only needed 1 mule to keep shit on, and their main accounts never had any irregular items.
---
As a member of the Brotherhood, I am interested in checking out this camp for "research purposes"...
---
Nah I don't do PvP very much, not really a fan.
---
Damn gloating when ya gt is available on here, bold move.
---
They may not have the capability/tooling to fix individual player issues, but that doesn't mean they are unable to roll out larger inventory changes during downtime.
---
Why would I look stupid? They did a great job here, for the first time. 
---
Roses are red, my finger's on the trigger. 
---
Yeah, your gun is big,  but this lady's is bigger. 
---
It was a joke about how if you now dupe you'd be caught and banned, it didn't really apply to you as a person it was just meant to be a light-hearted joke. 
---
Sorry that it was badly delivered, it's a saying around the office I work in and I though it might extend well to this situation. 
---
Ah, cool. That's nice to hear, I definitely didn't have more than one of anything else but mats and lots of drugs.
---
I don’t know why people hate on a for profit company for trying to max profits...for every reddit complaint there are shareholders ripping the company and Board to increase sales...I realize they screw up a lot but you can’t really blame them for not erasing everyone’s TSEs and trying to maintain DAUs. 
---
I just experienced this last night. [Here's a screenshot.](https://imgur.com/nMyltK0) The same *exact* scenario played out south of Dyer Chem near Haven Church. I picked up a Death Claw Egg from next to the nest. I've seen nests elsewhere in caves too.
---
I've only just got them after acouple days of server hopping with luck. Only this time I got my LUCK (stat) real high and the vendor had it straight away
---
This was a PR placebo stunt.
---
If literally nothing changed other than a less than 1% partial removal that no one has even reported experiencing, why did they announce it?
---
PR.
---
keychain is a neat option but would have no effect on server stability.
---
Missing: The end of the story, where the community realizes they're all Sneeches and content with it.
---
Unrelated side note: /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
You didn't like borderlands? You're not my best friend anymore. My whole life has been a lie!
---
That's less than 1% who had multiple copies. The real number of people who had duped items was likely much higher. 
---
Ding ding ding. March earnings calls are coming up.
---
I didn't want to believe it, but here we are.
---
They need to increase the camp budget with new items coming so we can build them too
---
damn then just how rare is it?
---
Good point. The few times I’ve gotten actual 3* items seems to be from lower * enemies. 3* enemies always seem to drop 2* items for me.
---
3rdly I'm pretty sure this is a design choice considering the first mission consists of opening your inventory and playing a holo tape.
---
Yet a portion of the player base, I'm not naming numbers, is too stupid to open that inventory and play the holo tape. 
---
You can see what missions others have active and this is literally first one you get out of the vault, half of the randoms I've grouped with haven't done it.
---
I'm pretty sure with this generation buying games npcs are hardly missed.
---
yep more a QoL thing
---
Basically it is giving an olive branch of peace to give those players a second chance. Runescape would often do that for first time offenders for bots. Usually limited to rolling back account levels/bank and a couple day ban.   
---
The intent is to keep the play around but given them a warning. However if they broke the rules again it would be auto ban. Basically warning then ban. I assume BGS Austin is doing a similar action. A warning to the people who didn't actually duplicate anything. 
---
Nah man, if you had 10 you were probably just role player a trader.
---
...but if you had 20...
---
&gt;I just reached level 50 on my main. I have yet to explore all of the Cranberry bog. I am still finishing the main quest line.
---
Wait til you've run out of steam before posting walls like this
---
3 with a possibility of making it a 4*
---
Current meta is the same as at launch... 2H Melee. If anything is introduced that can compete with the meta people cry until its nerfed into oblivion.
---
Try it and see what happens. It’s common on pc 
---
I mean reducing stacks of items to 1 is a pretty good now all those items can't be sold or traded people actually have to farm again the horror
---
So all the people with double shot explosive weapons bought from shady, illegal entities get to keep them? GREAT. Might as well get a god weapons from eBay so I can compete against everyone who cheated or is using cheat weapons. Otherwise my double shot golf club won't be a match.
---
This game economy is broken. 
---
There are obviously no consequences. 
---
If you aren't doing it you're doing it wrong.
---
Apex pleases me but go off.
---
If you were a true duper, you duped a ton of everything and locked it on atm accounts. In theory, dupers could have access to characters previously locked by the weight as they only have one of each duped item, meaning they have a small stockpile, which can be converted to much higher numbers of caps later on. 
---
They still kinda win here, the saying “exploit early, exploit often” really defines the game, now people at lower levels or that didn’t dupe truly miss out on this batch of weapons, and the dupers have a small source of money on top of their 100k caps filled up on all their characters. They could just buy the next op ass guns as soon as they’re found.
---
Even if they could scan again, they wouldn’t do it anytime in the near future for the same list of items, meaning they truly got away with it. 
---
How’s that?
---
No change. No new content. 
---
FWIW, I twice saw recipes for a single serum type on sale at the med vendor in whitespring bunker.
---
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE MONEY BECUASE THEY BOUGHT STUFF WITH REAL MONEY!!!  I'M GOING TO LOSE 10'S OF THOUSANDS OF CAPS BECAUSE I MADE TRADE DEALS!!!
---
Not everyone likes to on mic.
---
Is there confirmation all duping methods have been squashed?
---
Or can they just make a million again today?
---
Wasn't it like #3 as far as subreddits with the most dislikes on all of reddit.. 
---
Nah bro, if you had 20 you were probably just a vintage weapon collector.
---
...but if you had 30...
---
I've grouped with plenty that haven't done the "listen to the overseers holo tape", I'm pretty sure a lot don't care about npc stories.  My kids constantly ask me about shit from "why is everything like 1950s" to "where can I buy the blueprint to the water pump"... they are level 60+ with a full set of ultracite they spent weeks crafting.... 
---
Probably melee or bloodied explosive? Or AA explosive 
---
I can finally store more than 1 weapon!
---
Sounds like they didn't fix it though.  They let everyone keep their duped stuff.
---
Not fair at all. It still flooded the game with duped items, and potentially millions of those items are still sitting in the game that no one "earned" and many of which were purchased outside of the game. Those same items are still there, skewing their rarity and now becoming harder to find for future players. The only way I could be fine with all of this is if all legendary items before the patch started losing condition on breaking/usage/repair so that they eventually would have to be found again. At least things would balance out over time.
---
Possesion of stolen property is a crime. In the scenario I presented it is obvious that those quantum are duped. So you know they are duped. If people dont buy duped items people wouldn't dupe.
---
I think he's using his common sense.   A product that was released unfinished, had a historically bad launch, plagued by technical issues to this day, became an industry wide joke, is going to have a very difficult time getting new players and that's not even a the issues.
---
The people playing now are most likely fallout fans or Bethesda supporters and they were going to play no matter what.
---
Getting new players to give it a shot that have no experience with FO or BGS is highly unlikely to happen.  Of course they'll get new users but their DAUs are most likely dropping on a weekly basis.
---
Fuck new vegas geez it was a ok fallout game but it wasn't the end all be all of fallout games 
---
Once I went over level 50 or so, game was no longer viable for my Stealth Sniper build w/even the best sniper rifle I could build.  Until I got a TSE, it was so tedious to kill even "vermin" class enemies like Rats or Crickets!!! 
---
I've had alot of fun with this game.  I've stopped playing about a week ago because it's fucking boring.  I used to sadly log in 4-6 hours a day.  But its just getting so boring.  This is the first time I've publicly complained.  Prior to this all I did was uninstall it to get beth off there asses. 
---
you have some massive balls to spawn in whitesprings
---
They don’t they don’t have individual items tagged they  neck to see if you have stacks of the same god roll bc incredibly unlikely that you got two drops of the exact same 
---
Melee
---
Some, but there can be more. Dupers are destroying this game.
---
Ya, r/market76 and r/fo76bazaar, though i mostly use the market one as it has more subscribers.  And a karma system that helps flag people that do a lot of successful trades w/o scamming.
---
Quick test for ya, favorite a base weapon, than mod the crap out of it, than check if you can still swap to it via favorites, you should be able too.
---
They might be watching the rolls on the item, ie you have 2 tse handmades both have the same 3rd roll but different mods they might consider that a dupe
---
That assumes they have some sort of list of everything deleted on every server for however long we have to hold that list. Every time someone drops a bag of shit, that bag of shit goes on the list. Every time someone leaves loot on a body, that goes on a list. Did you not want that tin can in the suitcase? Well shit, add to the list. Sure, you could make the list selective, which means you have another bit of resource drain on the server as it double checks everything anyhow.
---
Meanwhile, fixing the dupe issue essentially boils down to IF TSEShotgun &gt; 1, then TSESHotgun = 1, applied as a script when a account loads in.
---
Your argument only works if you know literally nothing about programming.
---
Right!?! I'm tired of low levels running off and I don't trust just leaving plans in a cash register
---
Bloodied Machete -

Targets bleed and are poisoned, Exceptional damage

It can take a lot of server hops to get if you're lucky. I've done about 100 hops, and found it once, then it glitched out.. I'm looking again. Some people may get it with less hops, it just depends how much the game likes you. 
---
Most junk was useless in NV / FO3. With all the crafting in 4 and 76 it would make sense to make it more comprehensive.
---
Update? Now that it’s finished I’m genuinely wondering if the dupe purge affected your items. 
---
I'd be down for one , pm me your username for 76 on PC :)
---
The biggest problem according to this sub affected literally 1%.  It was literally as close to a non issue as it gets lol.  Your anecdotal story is moot when the actual company that created the game puts out an announcement that they basically wasted their time. 
---
Bloodied with unyielding gear. Both with melee and ranged
---
awww damn :( why did you let me down like that.
---
I TOLD YOU I LOVED YOU! ahhhh my heart lol :)
---
Sounds great..   
---
I can pop online after 20:30 USA-EST
---
Yeah i know, i like it it was good, but not my favourite
---
Obvious to you maybe but not a new player who doesn't use reddit. Also you wont face prosecution if you just say where you got it and that you didnt know, in that scenario that have to prove that you knew it was stolen... which in this case we cannot.
---
I bought 3 sets of serums off the same guy. He has all the recipes and sells the serums for less than 300 each. I believe he may not have got the recipes legit, but i think he makes the serums legit. They do not require that much to make them. I still haven't got around to using them, as i am running 18/19 mutations with cannibal. My plan is to try and lose the crap ones and keep thr good ones, then i have spare serums. 
---
Also... i have everything i had previous. Weights all seem the same on all 4 characters of mine! So glad it is over with!
---
The only thing I want out of a game is no loot boxes and the microtransactions are cosmetic 
---
I tried to find it in the truck bed east of the pioneer scout tower so far I have got trapper plans random armor upgrade plans every thing but that I have hopped it seems like 200 times lol.
---
are you my significant other, OP?
---
Reddit is not a homegenous community, there are people who think things are fine and write personal letters to Todd thanking him for all his hard work in being the hero we deserve, and there are there are people tall enough to look over the fence at other games in despair.
---
Still for sale?
---
So will putting a scarecrow out front appease y’all and make y’all passover my camp? Or does it have to be an altar? Is your scarecrow god a big G or a little g? Should I capitalize the S in Scarecrow God?? I am intrigued and have questions lol. 
---
So much to do that has nothing to do with missing NPCs. Or even Quests as you can explore for ages and do Events and Craft... 
---
They need several hundred  years to power up correctly.
---
I usually stick towards the middle of the map not far from the overseers camp. So im good. Lol 
---
They fixed all the duping methids there were rumors that some of the old ones came back last patch but again no evidence 
---
because it's only certain pieces of armor that makes it happen.
---
Let me know when the fucking BREAK IT EARLY TEST APPLICATION is finally over.
---
Hard pass.   Love Bethesda and all the other FO games, but 76 is a dumpster fire.
---
I bought this game the day it came out and played once (was still on red dead) and have been playing again this week and ducking love it. What are people’s complaints? I’ll also take tips on leveling up too haha
---
Xbox.
---
Figures.
---
That's my point. If you don't want to punish players for not knowing the items they receive are duplicated, then the issue can't be resolved easily because the items exist and are in circulation; it can only be mitigated.
---
The foremost objective should be fixing all the bugs that allow duping. Any other measure is just a band-aid. It goes without saying that Bethesda almost certainly isn't actually capable of that, but it's what *should* be done.
---
&gt;  would of 
---
How did you get this far in life without realizing that the phrase is "would've"?
---
It will always be a beta. 
---
*Relatively* well. Relative to everything they've done up to this point. Graded on a curve weighted entirely by themselves.
---
Iirc there have definitely been other games whose initial release was just as bad if not worse than 76. ME: Andromeda was a shit storm due to bugs and it's still not that great today, there is the original fortnite which was zombie defense it flopped so hard they made battle Royale and there are people who have played that part who don't know the zombie defense exists. The biggest flop of this generation was no man's sky. Biggest flop ever was E.T. I own that game worst thing ever.
---
This was oddly comforting....gonna go home and find someone to shoot....
---
Customer service doesnt have the ability to edit player inventories, but devs have better tools than CS.
---
(woosh)
---
Basically all people who bought a duped TSE still kept it. This nerf only affected the actual duper dealers by stoping them from continuing to sell them. I don't know if they fixed duping itself in the last patches or are they able to duplicate the one item left to the number they lost.
---
If you have the appropriate scarecrow out front we will pass over. We aren't concerned with capitalization, we simply kill anyone who does not believe in the same thing as us.... kind of like a certain real life religion that is popular in the middle east, not saying any names. Lol.
---
We were both in power armor. He was over lvl 150 and hitting me with a melee or shooting me w a TSE and I was taking waaaay too much damage for the damage to be as low as it is if you dont fight back thats insane. Beth needs to put ppl similar levels in servers so theres no 100+ level players in a lobby full of lvl 50-75 players 
---
If you look at my instagram, consider it done and done!
---
Fascists like you are the reason functional drug users can't find employment.
---
I've never understood the point of the burnt books being in game. We can't scrap them. And if you drop them, they go in the bag, so it's not even like you could use them to customize some immersive decor at your camp. They have no purpose. 
---
Yes... because the platform determines the entire playerbase. Video games are video games regardless of what system.
---
Trust me people are bitching still because they said Bethesda didn't do enough 
---
Err maybe I'm misunderstanding what the patch did? Was it only certain items or certain people that were flagged? 
---
On PC and I just traded someone to buy their handmade rifle plans (assuming it was safe to do so now) and he still had multiple of each TSE weapon, thousands of serums, hundreds of thousands of every ammo type, thousands of stimpacks, flux, etc. 
---
Why do they have 5 stars total? Is it for future updates or something?
---
Another wise person who opened level editor for 15 minutes decides to give his insight on their game and server architecture, thank you.
---
I have it reserved for a buyer. He's taking a few days to gather the caps. If that falls through I will look you up. Thanks for your interest!
---
Thanks for the info. Checked the spawn listed and it wasn't there, but I'll check back. 
---
People will always find a way to dupe
---
Honestly this is why I'm upset about TSE weapons getting nerfed so hard. I loving rampaging around Whitesprings blowing everything up in one hit. 
---
u/OldNerdStillAlive I totally get what you’re saying and Karma for dealing with this pretentious sir or madam like an adult the whole exchange. 
---
"Mr. XxxSwagDaddy69xxX, I don't feel so good..." 
---
(Sarcasm)
---
Okay! I'm PC/NA Happycamper781 friend me.  Have the caps on me already.
---
Lol i dont have one either, but i wish i still did. People are dumb and they need to know it! Haha what do u play on? And what lvl? I wish I got the whole "ruining others experience" to have fun? Like what i help lower levels if anything, def help them before hurting them. Like i gave a level 5 a searing rocket spiked bat which is pretty fuckin good for starting out. Just crazy, they get literally nothing but my junk, and almost always i have very little junk on me unless im going around farming. But you shouldn't be able to deal ANY damage unless the other player fights back imo, nor any armor damage. Thats how they shoulda done pvp 
---
Still find it enjoyable doing odd quests and events, looking for plans etc.
---
Mainly hunting for that elusive flatwoods monster as it is the only thing I have not killed yet. I have seen it once but it disappeared as I ran at it waving my rocket powered hammer about.
---
Playing in stealth pistol mode now ....
---
I apologize, I didn't realize facts and thought were frowned upon. We just need numbers that the actual company (who has a huge financial stake in making themselves look good) put out that purposely painted a rosy picture to get some positive PR spinning in their direction...
---
To bash open gun lockers in an attempt to find ballistic weapons
---
Its not that. They didnt say stacks till the patch dropped.
---
We thought any potential item was at risk.
---
May of loaded in faster but not sure
---
I don’t think we had a patch , rather then probably their own servers work was done.
---
I got no download or anything , so it’s probably your system 
---
lol fair point ..
---
Against someone whos over a dozen times stronger than me potentially? No. Thats not how its supposed to to be, at lvl 55 id have a better chance killing a level 150 Scorch beast before a lvl 150 player.
---
The irony is palpable.
---
Lol, ignorance of the law is not a defense. 
---
Buys $5,000 TV. Pays $50. S/N is scratched out. Seller only accepts cash. Seller wears a cap and sunglasses when its dark outside. Buys the TV in an alley. 
---
"Your honor, I didn't know it was stolen"
---
Anyways that's why step 2 is important. Bethesda being open about this on all platforms including in-game message on the top right of the menu screen.
---
See, no shit show. 
---
I like the lights 
---
The patch infects my PC with an over evolved chess game Ai called the MCP. It constructs a matter to energy conversion gun in my gaming room when I am asleep and when I go to play a game it blasts me in the back. It slowly chops my body apart into energy starting with my finger tips and then works its way down. The MCP then spits me out into a blacklight hell the villian calls the game grid. 
---
Yes cause it would have been more fair? I wouldn't have engaged either way tho. Pvp is useless in this game
---
Actually, they've done a lot of great things before this. Creating a post with pure speculation filled with negativity, only to be proven wrong by the update is why you look silly.
---
I have two amped up Dragons.  And two other modded shotguns including an explosive feature and I love them.  
---
I don't think they've ever said that. I've only heard people on here saying that they thought Bethesda couldn't.
---
Well it was working 100% before patch 5 hit. Can they use those factors' values?
---
Eat all the tatos
---
I wasn’t worried about losing weapons it was more angst about something else going wrong as result of the “fix” 
---
There was no patch today.
---
Oh wow. Too deep. Your quest for transendence is doomed.
---
Would you be on board if they buff the damage? It'll be fun to run around the Ash Heap and finish the job the strikers started
---
Sometimes I hide in the bushes close to the spawn point by the whitesprings golf clubhouse and wait for someone to spawn in. Then I'll shoot at the cars and watch them explode one after the other. The players, having just spawned in, are like WTF?
---
I always forget that those recipes exist! Probably because I'm like 200 hours in and only ever find cooking recipes I already know. That's something to look forward to for sure.. but yeah, to fix my situation I'll have to play the lottery again or wait for a fix. I don't even think it's eagle eyes that's bugged, but actually Carnivore, which probably means I will have to clear all my mutations and start over. That's what I'm really dreading, but if I can find cheap serums like you, it's a lot less daunting. Anyway, good luck!
---
Ahh, gotcha. I’m normally not the type to call out something like that, but the snark was so real on the post I couldn’t help myself 
---
Roses are red and if you fuck with me or my CAMP you will soon be dead 
---
I was just kidding!  I’m looking for the recipe to make boiled water out of Purified Water by spitting in it
---
What is also very apparent is that a lot of fo76 haters have not played the game and are solely basing their opinions on very biased YouTube videos. It's very common to have new bugs introduced when releasing new patch but when it happens to fo76 it's a fricking shitstorm. People magnify small bugs into "game breaking bugs". We all know fo76 has a lot of bugs and issues but it's the only game right now that gets such intense scrutiny. 
---
They're a privately held company they don't have to post results
---
I'll follow your lead.
---
I was just thinking how much better things are going on the sub today compared to last inside the vault or the last patch day. Things have generally been headed in  a positive direction for a while now, its just that people get their dander up around those days. There will always be lame trolls who just want to spread chaos, there will always be people who legitimately hate the game for their own legitimate reasons, and there will always be people who enjoy the game for their legitimate reasons, too.
---
“And here I am complaining about all that shit.”
---
It’s like if you read it, you’d realize that I already knew that. 
---
Good on you for following through, even when you were wrong 
---
&gt;The biggest problem according to this sub affected literally 1%.
---
No. The 1% was just accounts which have several of the same. You can't play the game while having your full inventory of all the things you've duped on your main account.
---
It’s the best ever 
---
I blows up all sorts of shit at WS.  Including myself sometimes with my TSE lol 
---
If more people were like OP this game was a lot more social and fun. Unfortunetly most Fallout fans play solo and don't want to interract with anyone. Kind of sad, multiplayer is wasted on such a community. This game could have been much more with the right community.

Right. My Gatlings weren’t stacked and I kept all 4
---
im on ps4..if u are too lemme know i will add u..my main character is level 56 and my alt is level 21..so we are around the same level..ive played for hundreds of hours
---
Lmao! Well shoot, which scarecrow is the appropriate one? Or will we find out the hard way? Lol. 
---
All I want is a patch note that reads "Fixed pretty much all server issues, we've upgraded from hamster wheels to lamborghini"
---
Well it does not say who is doing it, it says its under attack. But yeah, I see your point.
---
They don't have similar calls with Zenimax?
---
Dislike 
---
Nah, if you had 30 you were probably an arms smuggler.  But if you had 300...
---
I still have two tse handmades I traded for, along with some other questionable gear. I hope they even did anything lul
---
Roses are red,
---
and for goodness' sake

If you nuke your own camp

all your stuff you will break

This sub is whats driven me off the game. It's depressing coming here for info and seeing flaming posts about either bugs blown out of proportion or not enough content / patches. I find myself wanting to play sometimes, but then this sub sucks the enjoyment out of it. They even found a way to ruin my PA edition! It's rough thinking about the fact that I'd still be enjoying myself if it weren't for some of the crap posted here. The solace of  [r/fo76filthycasuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76filthycasuals)  can only help so much. Keen to see the vitriol subside over the next 6-12 months though.
---
They did nothing but nerf XP, Farming, Weapon damage, basic cards everyone uses.. awful store items.. ... don’t embarrass yourself defending them. 
---
This is the single thing they’ve done right since patch 0 paunch. 
---
Its not ignorance of the law, you didnt break the law when you bought it. KNOWINGLY buying stolen property is a crime.... so again without proof it isn't a crime. Yes , Bethesda could say "if you gather too many of any particular item we will ban you" but that's never going to happen.
---
Odd, the only whining post I see today is yours.
---
Theoretically couldn't someone dupe and sell the item right away - still making a bunch of items but spreading them out so everyone only has 1 item? Or even mule them to alts? I doubt they have an instant delete thing in place to remove multiples from inventories. I'm glad they did this, just curious about the inner workings I guess and the future, if this will be a once a patch delete or a 1 time thing. Hopefully they fix all duping and implement a way to find cheaters without having to use workaround measures.

Bethesda has basically made using guns not fesible against melee
---
The one with the hat looking down so that you cant see the face. That is the physical representation of He Who Walks Behind The Rows.
---
**UPDATE:** Bad News, i'm afraid. The screen I ordered doesn't fit. Its about 2mm too long to even fit snug in the transparent bubble screen. 
---
Also, I'm discontinuing this project as I recently found a video that does a FAR better job modding the kit. Check it out!

Those guns are now clean!
---
Cappy backpack!
---
It’s not a random drug test at all
---
Random drug test in this context would mean they just removed some duped or some TSEs but not all. Meaning some offenders would keep on offending.  
---
Now what would have been insanely cool.. for the week of Feb 14th BSG will replace all Nuc animations with Nuclear heart animation
---
I’m sad I missed the blackbird but I’m also very surprised they didn’t do pink for valentines. My wife would have been all over that. 
---
I agree.   The bugs are irritation.  Heck, I cannot even finish the Order of Mysteries: Novice quest because bug.  But the real issue with the game is the people with TSE (Traded, Sold, and Exploited - see what I did there) and other exploited items.
---
Buying something that you have reason to believe is stolen is knowing! The seller is not going to be operating a "we buy and sell your stolen goods" store.
---
The message is: cheat all you want just don't try to make an obscene profit off your cheating.  There are thousands of god level weapons in players hands that honest players WILL NEVER EVER GET. So either play along with crap one star or get buy a three star off the forums or ebay.  The duping isn't going to stop so there will be dupes of the dupes left behind.
---
Griefers still have cheat weapons so griefing will still be as bad as it was before.
---
Bethesda will have to do this weekly to keep it under control.
---
Next month isn't that far away 
---
Bethesda is desperate for good PR let's be honest.   This game has single handedly damaged the reputation of the company. 
---
Hate to burst your bubble pal , but didn't they shut the server down for maintenance? 
---
Aw, don’t let it do that. Someone else’s rhetoric should never dissuade you from doing anything. You should enjoy yourself regardless of what happens anywhere. 
---
I’m also keen on that. I’m a patient person. I can wait. 
---
I haven’t had the chance to get on yet but if the patch didn’t introduce new bugs and fixed issues then YAY!! I was also happy after the last hot fix. On ps4 I’ve noticed a much lower chance of errors and disconnects. I’m back to happy with my game at the moment. Thanks, Bethesda.
---
Not really lol
---
If you spent enough time to get to level 155 you must not been bored by the game at some point though? Or why would you spend so much time on it?
---
zingers! I love it.
---
This!! 
---
I earned by grinding and building.  And getting humbled routinely at lower levels. 
---
Pre-nerf a lot of people cheated their way to artificially inflated levels and caps.  To that extent I’m glad they took a step today. 
---
Everyone was worried about the dupe wipe and then Beth comes out of nowhere with great news. Nice job, looking forward to more good updates like this one!
---
The toxic fan base is the worst part of any Bethesda game....
---
Just putting this here.... its interesting. 
---
I'm not here to argue over what 1% means.   Fact is it was nowhere near as big of an issue as this sub made it out to be.   1% of anything, however you slice it, is pathetic. 
---
Do you use this current meta build? Screenshots of SPECIAL and perks would be really beneficial. Simple perk recommendations would be more than enough. :)
---
Will unarmed armor and pa mods get fixed?
---
They could just stay in the game but be made into part of the map and not something you can pick up/interact with
---
But how can you prove that they had any reason to believe its stolen? Because it was super cheap? That wouldn't stand up in court man.
---
markedly faster/smoother. the easiest way to tell is to craft a bunch of stuff quickly--that used to hose the client but now it's perfect.
---
Literally the truest words ever
---
Yeah Newbies dont understand and think the vendors share the same pool of caps with all players.
---
Whoever the 3 DBags were that downvoted this comment....PM, I’ll fight you IRL
---
Depends what you considered underwhelming. Some people put 700 hours in the game and still love it. Some hate it from the start because it's not a "solo singleplayer storyline experience". I don't give a shit about the story, i uninstalled Fallout 4 the milisecond that story was over because nothing kept me in the game after i finished my "talk to NPC simulator".
---
Really?  The tesla rifle, at lvl50 whenever I see it in Enclave stock, is base lvl200DMG without mods.  Weak?  WAY better than my Bloodied AR with all +DMG  and AA mods applied.  It's not my play style, but it is tempting.  Maybe if I came across a legendary...
---
 No its the same. Did one on my way to The Whitespring, and I got dinner.
---
Is that the dedicated safe space?
---
Same here. Only reason im here is the info.
---
All 2H perks, Bloody mess, incisor, martial artist, and the twisted muscle mutation.  I might be forgetting something.
---
Yeah... I have done about 20 or so SBQ and its rare that people get in my way really.  Mostly they stay stationary or just trying to get clear shots of her is all.   So not alot of moving cept by the melee.
---
Nerf XP that was abused over and over. There's absolutely no reason anyone should have been level 300 within a week of the game being released. How dare they adjust XP to be more reasonable!
---
Farming? What was done about farming? It's fairly easy to farm anything you need in this game. 
---
Weapon damage? Sorry you think everyone should be able to 1 shot the SBQ. Weapon damage as it is currently is ideal. TSE's were ridiculously overpowered and ruined both the PVE and PVP aspects of this game. 
---
Perk cards? You must have a terrible build or not know which cards to even utilize. If I can aggro SBQ over someone that is 100 levels above  using the right perk cards, then the issue isn't with the cards but with the players who don't know which cards to be using.
---
Awful store items? These are all cosmetic things. The amount of items I've seen people have bought for their camps or power armor completely contradicts the idea that the store items are awful. 
---
Get a grip.
---
My favorite thing since F3. 
---
Lay off the peyote Todd.
---
If you think even that faint praise merits snark...
---
The fact that they used the "Only delete duplicates" kinda confirms that by itself, you know. 
---
And if you don't have any evidence in the game code that there is any evidence of having a tracking system other than the (Useless im this contest, since it's different for every instance) RefID is also one point more for my "theory". 
---
Plus, they actually said it themselves that they don't have any means to actually track items in case you lose an item for whatever reason, so... 
---
Hrm, it seems plausible of course, I have not run into this, but have not fought the queen in about a month though.
---
It's next year already?
---
Prime plans were a rare drop from them before hand. I assume the UC plan may have been related to line in the sand. 
---
So far everything went swimmingly. In fact I have not noticed anything significant that has changed. Then again, i don't dupe.
---
All the flak? No. 
---
Next week
---
"bethesda isn't releasing good content so I made a cult". You do you op, make the best dang cult you can.
