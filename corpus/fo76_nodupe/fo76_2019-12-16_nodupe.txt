Exactly what I do too.
---
---
---
Watched that juicehead video. Geez, I think that's it for me. And people are farming hundred presets per hour with the rarest plans in the game. Way to shit on the rarity pool without even costing a cap. Well was fun, what a shitshow.
---
I will scrap your ass so fast your goddamn cap will spin.

&gt;  I DO NOT JOIN MY TEAM AT SPAWN.
---

---
I should have included this, because I do the exact same thing. I don't give any thought to my team until after the first "compression"; if they're still alive *then* I consider joining them.
---
Wwr pieces are good sellers
---
That’s the max level for a handmade
---
Lemme see what I've got left and I'll figure out who gets what. I gave several away at the overseer's camp before I first posted so I'm not actually sure how many I have left.
---
You guys know that Bethesda is completely incapable of securing their online game.  That's not new.  Its not hackers being really smart.  Its that they simply didn't think about needing to do this and so built an online game around and engine that puts a lot of heavy-lifting on the client instead of the server.
---
As such, I don't know if there's even much they can do about it.  Creation MP is fine for a coop game with friends.  Its full of holes to be exploited by malicious actors - and PvP is full of those types of people.
---
My wife helped me come up with the character. I wanted to play a female heavy weapons user because I hadn't done either before. My wife informed me that she is also, and I quote, "Bonkers insane." So I made her vegetarian, obviously.

Gunpowder. It's the gunpowder.
---
I post it every few months because there are several people who either are new and don't know, or have been playing for a long time and just don't ever go to WS for some reason.
---
I will give you both my kids, my wife, her sister, my house, both cars, and plasma grenade plan for it.  The wife is still in excellent shape and the sister has only been out on the weekends.
---
Go for a strong build like semi auto rifles ore 2 handed melee and dedicate all levels into perk other than that just keep doing main and side quests
---
I honestly forgot about that. Thanks for the reminder
---
Umm, just fast travel?
---
All I’m saying is brevity increases the chances people will actually read what you write. You don’t need to take my advice, you just will be more successful if you do. Good luck.
---
I gotta say, this is one of the main reasons I finally decided to pick up this game. I've been playing MMO's on and off since the early Asheron's Call days and I've never come across a community who regularly talks about doing this. It's awesome and I'm looking forward to whatever surprises (good and bad) come my way next weekend and even more so to being able to pay it forward, myself (also probably good and bad ..)
---
Heh, funnily enough. Since I've made some changes to the gear I use recently, I've started running out of gunpowder like seriously.
---
The crashed Santa is a reward for the current event...
---
Does anyone know how to get the icicle lights plan? Is it just a drop from the gifts?
---
That looks great! And what muscles you must have, since those things weigh a fuckton in my inventory!
---
I once chased a low level from Grafton to the Poseidon plant he had ownership of trying to give him stuff.  He finally got the hint when I didn't try to take the workshop, ran over to his turret platform, and dropped a bag of canned food (dog food, pork and beans, and cram) along with 30 purified water. You will accept my kindness, you have no choice.
---
I have tried to get water out of that fountain, and it doesn't seem to work, on Xbox platform!? 
---
I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Lol. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
Enter Whitesprings. Train Station side.
---
Weird. No robots.
---
Suddenly 8 ghouls. 
---
Ring around the rosey. Pockets full of stimpacks. 2 shotgun blasts each. And they all fall down.
---
Sneak in this time.
---
Level 68. Pop him in the head.
---
Missed. Got his throat, where the deteriorating brain isn't stored. Second shot drops him.
---
Maybe there was only one high level dude here. Enter house. Want them holotapes. Shoot ghoul inside. Level 68. Clean shot. Like a crisp apple being bitten into. Loud enough to attract whatever else is in the house.
---
Shit.
---
Caution bar shrinks. I turn. Two level 24s and a level 68 bolt into the house like they own it. See me immediately.
---
Whip out fancy pump shotty and pump out two rounds of my slow firing precious level 5 legendary. 
---
Slap.png
---
Jam a stim into my abdomen. Try to run out. Slapped again. Stagger into corner. Backpeddle deep into the corner. Shotgun breaks. 8 more ghouls show up. 
---
Gangbanged.
---
I'll just switch servers.
---
Tried 8 times before I figured Whitesprings is not level 35 friendly. I'll come back later.
---
Google the reason why. Its a farming location for higher levels. Understandably so.
---
Logged in today. Only a level 40 there.
---
Walk in. Robots are all dead again. Level 64 Yao Bear and his crew of runts rush me from who knows where. Run into Whitesprings. Level 68 ghoul turns around with the widest grin imaginable. Proceed to be shared between bear and ghoul.
---
In short. Fuck Whitesprings. (Until I get a better gun.)

---
"It depends on..." a whole bunch of stuff :)
---
Outfits cover your armor, but armor still applies.
---
Power armor is one of the most underrated things in the entire game. People like to say how bad it is, but that's because its advantages don't look as nice on paper.
---
Each piece of power armor adds a 7% reduction to incoming damage for a 42% damage reduction total. This also isn't beholden to the 75% chance to proc like with Sentinel, Assassin's, or Cavalier. Power armor also has a natural resistance to radiation that can't be matched by armor. This is obviously relevant to nuke zones, but in PvP this helps shut down gamma guns which are nasty weapons. It also has very high ER/DR naturally which is tough to match with conventional armor.
---
Along with its natural bulk, PA has two other native advantages. Power armor completely negates limb and fall damage. This is a pretty big deal. Most meta builds run Adamantium Skeleton, so this is a very solid perk. The other thing power armor does is eliminate pesky animations for Stimpaks and Stealth Boys. This is a huge boon for power armor users. Field Surgeon makes health recovery with stims very potent. Pair this with First Aid and Super Stimpaks and you'll be amazed at how much punishment a PA build can take.
---
That's not to say that PA is perfect. Power armor doesn't have a way to boost AP recovery near as fast as a powered set does. It's damage reduction isn't quite as substantial as Sentinel/Cavalier. There's also a few perks (most notably Serendipity) that don't work while in PA. 
---
Power armor needs better arm mods. It would also be nice to see Serendipity work while in PA. Emergency Protocols + Serendipity would be incredible. It's not too far off from where it needs to be imo.
---
Power armor is definitely competitive with conventional armor at a fraction of the cost. I think Strangler set a nice precedent for the future of PA. Add one "legendary" bonus to a set and leave it at that.
---
Literally any anti-cheat service would be better than what they currently have.
---
Scrip it or make a noob's day by just giving it to them
---
Games like eve online are appealing to me but nothing keeps me coming back like fallout does.
---
I have my own unique ways of gifting things to other players to keep things interesting 🙃
---
Escape Rooms
---
https://youtu.be/6OBFQsqN8yM
---
And just being the weirdest guy on the server - that guy you list wish would go away but he is dressed like Santa so you know you shouldn't tell him to. (Really wish we had the gift skin for the drop bag last year)

Are you going to the tiny metal water fountain on the edge of the ring? Some people try to get it from the center, but it's actually not in the middle. It's on the inside edge facing east.
---
I've waited it out up to 5 minutes and an able to eespawn and get effect event rewards.
---
Nope
---
Don't know how many hours the average players play this game a week, and the knowledge. But if I only focused on selling out the vendors I could do it playing only one hour a day. Launch nuke collect, make stable flux and sell out the vendors on all the 5 characters.
---
Hahaha 😂😂🙈🙈
---
What the fuck would you trade then?
---
Guns are and have levels to them so don’t get attached until you’re atleast 50.
---
VAC? You must not play much CSGO... VAC is complete and utter shit. ESEA's anti-cheat is great, so is Faceit's; it records the screen to see if you have undetectable visuals, and gives Administrators access to your inventory for illegitimate items. 
---
VAC relies on bots that are inaccurate, and it never acts on a ban unless it detects external assistance. If you have a Trainer/External running while VAC is running? You get banned. Even if it's not for the VAC secured game. Which sucks, but that's how it is. 
---
If you're VAC'd, you 100% fucked up, because it is super strict about how and when it acts - for that reason I just gave; it only bans on definite external processes. 
---
If it's unsure, it sends a real person to investigate, and they aren't allowed to perma ban under the logic that they can't ever know for sure. 
---
Despite all that sounding lovely; it's too soft. Invasiveness is required to have a perfect anti-cheat, but a lot of people boycott 3xA's using such software. That's why consoles are always gonna be the best for anti-cheat, because it can be invasive without people complaining that it can potentially download sensitive files. 
---
Not to say you can't cheat on a console; see Xbox 360 homebrew RGH.
---
Bam I covered everything for you because you didn't ask. You're welcome
---
I saw some guys spawning hundreds of bees to kill. Presumably for easy XP. I would've loved to see the Prydwen pop into existence.
---
That is actually one of the better answers lol. Without all the technical terms lol
---
What is Wastelanders? Sorry
---
Like was already said - just fast travel out.
---
I started buildong Escape Rooms with some pretty sweet rewards at the end. 
---
People are free to fast travel out at any time - id say nearly 70% of people do - but I build them for those who like a bit of a puzzle and have 20 minutes to an hour to kill trying to work their way through it.
---
Maybe the date of original Gad's flooding, May 12th 1964?
---
Exactly, this is the reason i have been playing it since pre beta :D
---
Yes it has it's problems like any other games, but Fallout 76's reputation was destroyed by whining children and trolls.
---
and people that can't see past that will never enjoy what we are enjoying ...
---
Sink is dirty water rads and all.
---
Worked through this today with 2 teams.   It worked well.   Tons of gifts and legendaries.
---
Apparently they don't give you a command of the English language either.
---
&gt; You realize that someone having this thing has no effect on your game play right?
---
Because PvP does not exist in this game.
---
Darn, well it looks like I will be waiting for a sale then. Thanks for the info!
---
They're not specific to heavy/sturdy/light. Possibly the OP's problem is that you can learn any piece by scrapping any piece, so for example, you can learn polymer legs by scrapping arms. Maybe what has happened here idk, but check the other limb/body slots in your modify menu to be sure.
---
Great Idea, but the name is not welcomed by my community, your company has stolen half our water supply out of our aquifer. 
---
I  live 10km away from there controversial source of water in Guelph Ontario,  Canada. And they are literally stealing our water supply!  
---
I wish you the best!
---
just shows you how much Bethesda sucks
---
i ll take this badaid over everything they have released regarding this in the last 6 months
---
oh wait, they didnt release anything
---
It's a shame really. I'd like to be able to hook one up to a storage tank that you can dump bottles of purified water into, or maybe plumb it in with a purifier or something.
---
Make sure when u pick perks u understand ur picking a stat point AND a perk card until level 50. I fucked this up a bit until I was lvl 10-11. Make sure you kno how many perk points u have in every stat too, as to not upgrade a card and not be able to use it cuz u don’t have enough points in that stat.
---
J-just-just... What?
---
All I can tell you is I play this game every day since it came out, and I still find adventures to go on with my teammates. I also love playing solo, but some of the later game stuff is very hard to do alone.
---
Bet it breaks in a single shot.
---
Just take away legendaries in general and add a better perk system that's the only cure all that'll ever work. People Blame Bethesda again and again for dumb stuff like this that they'll actually try to fix despite what the community says but this isn't the only game to ever have this problem with hackers and they will never stop hacking.
---
How many different posts are going to use this same picture anyway?
---
The only problem with it is it eats up a bit of budget. I originally had well wired stuff in mine, then I came up to my camp limit and just went "screw it" and used the wires through walls trick to build what I wanted.
---
None of the Mr. Fuzzy token events are giving me rewards. Same with Strange Brew.
---
It’s the next big expansion coming out in a few months. It got delayed, originally was supposed to be by the end of the year.
---
Advanced power connectors I think is what your after.
---
I know Grahm has them but they might be in watoga station too.
---
Yeah, I didn't know that the first time through.
---
Thought I had to choose my perk card from the same stat.
---
This is more on Bethesda, why they thought a free weekend right as they announce no more patches untl next year was a good idea? Yeah just like last year this time they said the same thing, and then the dupes got released. Bethesda ignored the dupes for over a month last year until end up January.
---
So expect this to be the exact same. 
---
Bethesda has shit all for hack detection so this pretty much on them. Honestly spawning in Preston or the prydwynn isn't even that bad compared to the 5 star and 10 star legendaries they are now making are far far worse than some visual glitch.
---
A welcome change from fallout 4 IMO
---
Yeah but this isn't a player it's an NPC.
---
You can craft alcoholic beverages that can't be found which have some serious buffs plus there's a number of daily/weekly challenges that involve crafting &amp; drinking alcohol. Be sure to do those Biv dailies so you learn all the recipes tho.
---
Do events. You can get sooo many basic supplies from them.
---
Be careful with workshops and don't bother building anything but extractors and generators.
---
Check out the resource map (just Google it) and use that to find good camping spots.
---
Go exploring.
---
 Raising level weapon cap is a way of punishing honest players.   I  am mostly PVE and I did not acquire my weapons through trading on the black market, duping or trading with dupers.  I got them through grinding and I don't want them be made useless because hackers and dupers flooded the  game with illegitimate  gear.  And this is Bethesda we are talking about.   Raising weapon level cap just means that we will now have a bunch of level 60 duped and hacked god tier weapons.  If Bethesda really stopped this shady nonsense, then yeah I'd support raising the level cap, But they have repeatedly shown themselves to be incapable of managing duping and hacking.  Raising the weapon cap just means honest players will struggle and dupers and those willing to trade with them will continue to dominate.
---
This has happened to me twice. Both times the only spot I could revive was at vault 76.  It cost me a few caps to travel back but I was still able to loot the queen.
---
Yup. If they make it so tough events (scorched earth, encryptid) drop 55/60s, and tough dungeons (vault 94, etc) drop 65/70, and new content drops higher level stuff, etc then the current economy gets reset.
---
They just need to add better cap sinks and we may have some equilibrium.
---
Do not reinstall until you have tried everything. Power cycle your console and also try logging in to a different PS plus online game, then log out and retry Fallout 76. This happens to me a lot but it usually goes away.
---
Hmmm. Interesting.  I did not know this. Now...I do!  
---
Thank you!
---
My camps directly infront of the overseers camp, and i keep a healthy portion of Nukashine in my punchbowl..for the newbies
---
Those who come back get a gift bag of aid items n ammo though!
---
AH, don't I feel stupid now! Thank you for the direction on that. 
---
Massively multiplayer Online - has nothing to do with survival / rpg / building its simply the number of people the game can host. The game uses a central server to host player shards of 24 people which are basically instances so long as more then 50k people are on said server at a time it is massively multiplayer online.
---
Second no STW crashed every few secs people fell through the map ect pretty much every issue I had like every other mmo I've played - this is just how most mmo's are launched.
---
Also you missed the in your opinion it was unfinished the core story was in place and complete-able day 1.
---
Level 45?? 2k caps max offer
---
The scout quests can be a bit much for lower lvl players. It's a freebie carry bump all players can get at lvl 2.
---
Reason it's unlearned cause it was added after the scout quests. Great addition. I still have photos from my first days and at lvl 30+ I didn't have a pack at all.
---
the photoshop is strong with this one.
---
I didn’t know that. I’ve only seen him twice in that whole time, but he only had it once.
---
I found it annoying in 2.5 hours of helping a new player not a single holiday spawn happened for them.
---
Big brain time bethesda
---
OK so I guess CoD is an MMO.
---
Yes that happened with STW, but it was rare.
---
No, not in my opinion. It IS unfinished. And the story was not complete-able day 1, there was a glitch with a dispenser that wouldn't dispense the quest item. Had to be fixed in a patch.
---
I’ve seen the 10 Star Legendaries, but what’s up with the Prydwen in Morgantown? I’ve never heard of that one.
---
Edit: never mind, what the fuck? I just now found it. That’s so unfair.
---
The Players Are Crocs.
---
No worries!
---
You shoot be able to press a button or double tap and that does the combat animation.
---
It has that +1 Perception so you know it was a legit drop! /s
---
Same in any game. EFT is litterly unplayable during free weekends and sometimes a while after while people wait for a ban wave.
---
It's not hard at all considering there's only a certain number of legendary effects that will spawn naturally on a weapon, so anything beyond that is out of bounds.  It would actually be EASIER to detect this than it would an aimbot.
---
Nude and Headless scorched
---
Agreed, plus give us a reason to gather purified water instead of selling them for caps.
---
Sad, lonely people. I'd pity them if they weren't taking their angst out on others like they do.
---
Haven't seen nude ones, but I've seen a headless one and it's neck was see through
---
Nuke zones is the only place I do wear PA.
---
Legendary armor pieces are more protective than power armor, most high level players favor them. When it comes to nuke zones there’s lots of options for going without PA: Hazmat suit, they’re on a team and someone is sharing Rad-sponge (you remove rads from nearby teammates, it works wonders), or else they could be riding the glitch where you sometimes just don’t take Rad damage.
---
I personally hate power armor. It's slow, clunky and loud, and my full set of 3* armor (alongside mutations and perk cards) outclasses it in damage resistance, while providing way better bonuses.
---
As for nuclear zones, I'm a stealth character, so I'll just put on a hazmat suit and switch to a beserker weapon for solid damage.
---
Farm purified water for caps 4 caps per and 60 purified water per hour with the industrial so that’s about 240 caps per hour per industrial water purifier. Where I get all my caps from👍🏽
---
Yup. The trick is to have a friend hold him, then you log out and rejoin on your friend. It refreshes his inventory for you each time.
---
People arw spawning the prydwynn? WTF
---
Does that show for all players or just them?
---
Welcome and enjoy!
---
lol
---
Bethesda - we'll wipe the servers and charge 100000 atoms if a player wants their account recovered. If not, they can think of it as a "fresh start" or submit a ticket, which we might consider one day glancing at.
---
will do
---
I just hope that we get a patch to take the game offline before servers are shut down...
---
100k caps of handmade and probably another 100 from scorched and zero handmade or bear arm plans. Hopefully they add it to another drop table or make a currency like scrip to buy things like that. Making the scout badges require plasma grenade plans is horse shit.
---
I had a similar experience when I started my 3rd character  while back. Someone stopped by my little camp at the time and made a gun and gave it to me.
---
build your base around it and charge an entry fee :)
---
Thanks! I have a high level character on PC, just looking for some folks to play with on xbox lol
---
Streamline your perk choices. No quest until lvl 50 at least, that way you get scaled quest weapon rewards
---
Losers who would attack you, and you would engage, just to have them run around the corner and their base is there and it is nothing but a bank of turrets...
---
Losers who found that developer room, so had 1 hit kill weapons, but wouldn't pull them out until you engaged them...
---
Stuff like that.
---
Yes def. Most ppl just wanna play fallout co-op or solo. And for what’s it worth you can’t go wrong. With all the updates and added on content you’ll have tons of stuff to do and explore. And if u need help just come on here and usually someone will be more than happy to help u.
---
See above, sorry it didn't post as a reply for some reason.
---
Mine is the same name on here GeedsGarage. I have 3 characters on Xbox. 2 100s and a 200.
---
As a newbie, I appreciate the hell out of this!
---
It's not a punishment your gear isn't getting any worse it's just opening up a pathway for even better gear.
---
Who even figures this crap out.
---
So legendary dragons are legacy now?
---
What's a trap camp? 
---
Sorry if that's ignorant, I havent been playing for very long
---
You can still get them rarely from the Dead in the Water raid loot table, but only from there
---
Interesting info - thanks 👍🏻👍🏻
---
Yep.
---
since someone linked it through before. You think the 5\* is bad ? 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
[https://i.imgur.com/ZV8qn52.png](https://i.imgur.com/ZV8qn52.png)
---
All players, new hack lets them spawn anything they want from the game files. It's why there are 5 and 10 star legendaries around now.
---
I believe it was you who built a floating Prydwen and I plan on doin that now that I know how to build a true floating base
---
Oh no your good boy points. :o
---
Protip: hotkey them to your favorites instead when opening mass amounts.
---
You mad genius
---
Bungie calls Destiny 2 an MMO now ever since the split from Activision. I agree with your gripe though.
---
Keep using my scout magazines :(
---
lmao cope harder
---
Flair checks out. Fucking raider scum, rather shoot a man for his last 2 caps than work an honest days labor
---
I hope rngesus is on my side so I can get my beloved mothman head
---
Duping &gt; trading?
---
Look at the DR/ER number in NW, power armor isn’t much better than marine. Add in a huge hit box and it’s easy to headshot. Rifleman + tank killer + bloody mess with a sniper will one shot anything. There is a laser sniper, but it is a very rare drop.
---
Yeah bloodied with high rads and rad away above small gifts doesnt work
---
Hahahaha what a clown, you’re so upset and for what!
---
Agreed, i use 2 in adrenaline.  3 tops.  5 might be good for mowing through a mob but if you’re doing that you probably have the damage to 1 shot them anyway.  If you can 1 shot your targets, any additional damage is a waste of a perk :)
---
They won't though, either they don't know how or they just don't care at all. Too busy focusing on their new stuff.
---
Frenzy? I'm calling BS. Also, without that bash damage I'm out...
---
Do you know when they were taken out?
---
It’s not an MMO. Far from it.
---
And health regenration based on rads to
---
these gifts have actually been pretty rewarding for me. Got the plans for t51 left leg just recently
---
Working through Tuesday. I’ll be back on after that through Sunday. Hit me up if you guys wanna go scorched hunting. That was a blast!
---
Around the time vault raids were introduced I think
---
Sure sounds good man!
---
If you don't spend the point the game sees you at 40. So if you have ten spares at 50 the first point will unlock 41, next will do a 42 card, then a 43 card etc. Until you are caught up.
---
I have not felt forced to do any event at all. I have been playing since beta and I am not even sure if I ever even did that one yet.I think on that particular event the one time I decided to check it out I went to the first farm to get fertilizer, promptly lost interest and wandered off after a squirrel. 
---
I too chill and take my time with the game. I have found if you just loot,explore, and hunt where you are it pays off about the same as actually going to events anyway. most of my events sort of happen organically I get acheivements completed the same way. I don't even look for the achievements I just play and "oh look at that. I did a thing!"
---
2k take it or leave it!
---
Ohhh man I got it thanks
---
My gamertag is lude 93 not really high level but I am working on it.
---
No two shot?
---
It's like that so you can't save up points for 3 levels to get a max level perk the instant it's available.
---
So for Bloody Mess, it should be available after you spend one point, as it can be selected at level 42.
---
I think. I'm going off memory.
---
Get to the end &amp; don't touch the Ultracite. Dive into the fissure - puts you back at the start.
---
f you do it as a team, pretty much each Ultracite vein spawns in 4 or 5 scorched, so your chances of a present are pretty high. The scorched sometimes travel a bit of distance, so just wait till they arrive, or use berry mentors to hunt them down.
---
If you are real lucky the Ultracite will be bugged. Then you can select each one &amp; they will spawn in the 4 or 5 scorched every time to Select the ore. In a solo run I was getting up to 25 scorched per Ultracite vein
---
Give it a go, best place to farm presents.  Tyr on YouTube has a clip - check it out
---
yep
---
Can you possibly tell me what the best combination of effects for each piece of armor is in order go make this work? Im working on an unyielding set of robot armor and Im hoping to start playing with no power armor.
---
Is it as slow to collect from as the water pump ?
---
I think many would be interested in a responder faction. I envision a responder faction striving to acheive every event on the map as a big happy group. they would help the little guys in the low level areas. probably less "grind the queen" oriented however if someone did drop a nuke the responders would. uh respond and go help I imagine. 
---
I think the best place for a responder camp is at monongah power plant area. its somewhat centrally located and restablishing a working infrastructure for everyone would be a primary goal of the responders I would think. so repairing all the power plants would be pretty high on their priority list as well I would think.

I’m level 215 and legit have never seen/heard of this.
---
Not allowed to trade in this sub
---
Sorry. I disposed. Meant to put it in market.
---
There’s already a spreadsheet with all the places to farm them
---
Congrats!  First kill feels like a great accomplishment for sure.
---
Yeah, thought the format was to nice haha
---
No problemo!
---
Well feck
---
Get combat armor. Both vendors in Grafton sell plans to put the Brotherhood mod on (it’s about 100 caps).
---
Then just start assembling a set of the legendaries that are useful to you. Personally, I like unyielding, with a fair amount of rad resist, and one poison resist, with maybe some strength and endurance, but you may like Troubleshooter or Exterminator. 
---
See what’s killing you, and change your armor accordingly.
---
And don’t forget the Shielded Underarmor,  Brotherhood adds 2 strength and three endurance, Enclave 3 strength and 2 perception.
---
I prefer to describe it as “criminally underused”, place is huge and has very little tie in to anything.
---
Glad I'm on console.
---
LOL its still in the air my man. as an ultracite laser gat guy its one of the things I have to consider in any sb/ queen fights. if there are people with ballistics around let them take the finishing shots. in the line in the sand mission I let the turrets finish them off. 
---
if they refuse to land I will sometimes try to at least position them in such a way that they are flying close enough to the ground to still reach the corpses. 
---
occasionally though I will turn them to an ash pile where I just cant reach. /shrug its not super common and I generally get them on the ground but it can happen.
---
Since (supposedly) you can no longer get single card perks from packs, I’d recommend grabbing chemist, scrapper, and green thumb if you haven’t already.
---
I re read this post twice but still can’t say I know for sure what the hell you are trying convey here.
---
Unyielding sentinel. Wood armour with sneak
---
I know I’m just messin with ya
---
I've got it on two characters after a few 10s of plans from scorched.
---
Agreed. I hate MMOs. This I like.
---
Unyielding/AP refresh/sentinel, I wear a full set of it.
---
That makes me sad to hear, as I have tried to help new players whenever I run into them.  I can't believe that someone would pick on a little kid.  Good on you for teaming with him, and I hope you made a new friend!
---
Where is the spreadsheet?
---
Came out of big Bend tunnel and it was raining landmines. Got 60 Or so. Hasn't happened since.
---
Nah it's easy to get gifts. Sell stuff like crazy for caps to by gift wrap, use chemist perk and bam presents galore. Server hop and hit all major scorched spawn points. Put in the hours doing it all day and you can get tons of legendaries and gifts.  I was barely trying (only used caps I had, no server hopping, visited only some scorch spawns once) and I accrued 41 total gifts in 2hrs.
---
Haha I'm gonna be keeping a lookout for these now, havent run into one yet, but I probably will now that I know they exist
---
Now they just need a fountain that cures bugs.
---
Wait raining landmines?
---
The Gary gun and giddy up buttercup would bring me back.
---
I did! We’re still playing with him, he’s precious. This is his first fallout game.
---
I'm level 140 and I just keep pacifist on 24/7. I'm not a cunt so I have nothing to gain from pvp
---
Pro tips : 
---
Play like you don't give a crap ,it's a more fun experience "do whatever" 
---
Aquaboy is key .
---
You barely get any experience for shooting people ....no really look for yourself .
---
Basically the game is actually hide and seek ...guns don't matter I place 1-4th frequently and all I do is hide .
---
How do you find this in workshop menu?
---
No problem, it took me a few jumps to get everything but it worked when I accidentally melted one
---
I'm kinda shocked nobody's talking about how there's a perk that cause targets hit by critical hits to "frenzy" (whatever that means)
---
Thanks for the interesting reply. I actually want to do some of these event that pop up, but just dislike the feeling of being pushed by a timer. There is enough of that in real life I guess.😉
---
If I had coins, youd get them!!
---
Same here. I saw him in 5 matches.
---
https://youtu.be/P-Uu9gavTus
---
I opened 80 small and 80 medium and got just as good of results, just not the multiples because large drops more plans for each one.
---
Edit: actually I got just as many common and semi rares, just not as many rares. I only got one Santa crash and one icicle lights.
---
I love the Huntsman one at the Bear lodge. There is a 24 hour timer, and if you log out and come back the next day you have 24 more hours. The only way you could fail is to stay logged in longer than 24 hours without doing it. 😂
---
It seems the plans are from a limited pool, but all the other stuff is from standard tables, they seem pretty random to me.
---
I've spend all this double XP event leveling in NW,I was level 33 before the update and now I'm level 64, hackers made it hard thanks to cheats but happy with all the progress i made with my clan mates.
---
It’s kinda lame if they are reduced. Today was the first chance I’ve had to log on and after 5 hours of mowing down scorched I’ve seen 2
---
PC, what do you expect!
---
..but only level 45
---
&gt;   why did you bother doing it in the first place?
---
To complete my build, that's why.  Now that my build is complete, I don't want to do it again and why should I? Raising the level cap is like moving the finish line another 200 miles away after I have already crossed it and then telling me that the first time I crossed it was  all for nothing and doesn't count.
---
It's when its opened from what I can tell. I've used a private server to swap some to a lower level character before I opened them in the hope that by cutting out the high level items I'll have better odds. Seems to work, I've gotten two plasma grenade and one tomahawk plan from that method and I haven't pulled any from my high level characters
---
Well, he's paid by the revenue, and extending time on his videos adds to his likelihood of money, so... Hey, even Dickens was paid by the page.
---
Just wait until you do a bunker run and blow thousands of rounds on that and the SBQ then have the game crash when the SBQ dies and you gen no loot.
---
i bought the black paint immediately, i totally want that Operators style
---
I hate dogwood die off with a passion. I think I've done it twice and failed it both times. I've done other events many many times, but that one, forget it even though it has a chance to spawn one of the outfits I've been hunting. I'll bury another soldier before I waste caps fast traveling against the clock.
---
I probably have opened over 100 gifts and no Plasma Grenade plans, did get plasma mine plans.  
---
I open them slow so I haven't eaten anything, yet...
---
And the there's the actual CONTENT of said gift...
---
This game is an mmo. The only way it's going to keep from getting stale is adding more content and more ways to get stronger. You don't need to have the strongest possible gear to play this game. If your build is "complete" then congratulations you beat the game. What's the point of playing any more?
---
I'm relatively new (level 7) and its been fun :)
---
Make sure your perks are set right. The three damage boosting cards for the type of weapon your using as well as insisor and martial artist are a must. Tenderizer from charisma tree works wonders too as does adrenaline from agility but I think that one may require a higher level if I remember correctly
---
I feel like it might be a little faster, but it's not like collecting from a river.
---
Total server wipe for Wastelanders. Even if only for items and let people keep their levels/perks.
---
Sure it sucks, but a clean slate is better than this BS.
---
There are too many hackers, dupers and items they have spread on all platforms. You get these items through trading and checking containers also, so even if you never duped or aimed to buy duped item, you might still have them.
---
Just wipe it all and start fresh. I've looted my items before and can do so again. There are tons of ways to get legendary items in the game at this point, so the grind isn't as bad as in start.
---
This works on a private server?? If it does it would be significantly easier to farm mobs and materiels.
---
Why would they make a lvl 40 armor into a 5 star
---
Don't carry serums when opening gifts. I became a chameleon yesterday
---
Yeah it works, there is a time window before a private server resets. You can put items in a container, I use suitcases at the train stations. Then log out and log back onto the private server with your other character and pick then up. Keep in mind that this isn't foolproof and I've heard of people losing items doing this but it usually works. I wouldn't dare try it with anything really valuable like weapons or armor but I do it with flux materials and holiday gifts all the time. You can search guides on it that'll show you exactly how it's done
---
Bingo, that’s it, thanks. I thought you learned them for the piece you were scraping. Now I know polymer for everything but :)
---
All of those stars and only 2k ammo lmao

---
It's a neat find.  It can get kind of hairy though, depending on what's passed through the area.  I knew three peeps that tried to map out the best sections to make CAMPs in, and each thought they found the mother lode, until a few days into living there...
---
They each got hosed by Scorched and SB's coming in like tidal waves.  It's a cool place to visit and use for travelling if you're good at sneaking.  But I wouldn't presume that it's safe at any given moment.
---
&gt; This game is an mmo.
---
I've seen this argument used repeatedly to justify every ridiculous design choice Bethesda has made in this game. It's an argument I reject.
---
Honestly they should've given the gifts the same rate as fertiliser.
---
I know this isn't exactly "proof" but I've heard of several people getting them.  Take it with a grain of salt if you like; you don't have to take my word for it. I'm just going off what's in the data. But, there's no way to prove that they ***don't*** drop, either.  RNG is RNG.
---
Its why I don't care about the best DPS builds anymore. I just have fun playing with my junkies/explosive shotgun build and blowing stuff up in 1-3 hits. Crippling enemies en masse is fun too.
---
&gt;server wipe
---
They can also give me a full refund for the game after that too.
---
This is not your ordinary mmo. You can play at your own pace, and I like the fact they are focusing more on co-op pve more than pvp. PVP in a fallout game is just stupid. The mechanics aren't made for it. You can pretty much get everything in the game for free, except for 1st subscription and that's not even p2w. I'm still new. I've been playing for a couple months, and I am still learning new stuff.

---
They're usually worth selling, priced low they'll sell both to low levels &amp; to higher levels looking for scrip. With the event right now, though, it's much easier than usual to max out scrip at higher levels and to find low level legendary gear (the alt I started fresh on Friday had lvl 1 &amp; 5 legendary weapons worth using within the hour and a full set of legendary lvl 5 armor by the end of the day) so it's probably not worth the storage space until after the holiday event. My vendor's at "please clean out my inventory I'm begging you" discount pricing and hardly anyone's buying.
---
Tbh that’s badass
---
This happened to me, too. But there was only 7. They fell right at the west entrance as I was coming out. Looked as though the fell from the top of the arch in the opening.
---
They've been successfully doing it with FO76 since day one. 
---
I love fallout but i wish i could kick Todd Howard so hard in the nuts...
---
It gives you dirty water. You don't have to connect it to anything, just throw it down, and get dirty water.  It is a bit faster than getting dirty water out of a water pump, but not a whole lot. I'm liking it so far.
---
Holy shit. The hilarious thing is that if they started buffing chainsaws and crossbows and alien blasters to the point that they are actually viable to use then hackers are technically polishing the game and picking up Bethesda’s slack
---
I think you came to my camp the other night and attacked me with a flaming chainsaw
---
I want to Fucking see this IMMEDIATELY
---
Id swap out any cards that make fusion cores last longer  although nice to have it dose not increase damage which is way more important than convenience
---
Also once you’d done respecting you can take inspeatonal out
---
I'm kinda interested. Building without atomic shop stuff will be challenging. But I don't like schedules, and my anxiety is saying "no, don't do it." I don't really care about the caps and supplies.
---
I had a camp there so did a few other friends it was fun connecting out camps, I moved my camp because I don't like staying in one spot for to long.
---
I love watching the new players too! Although sometimes its a little frustrating to try and help them. I saw one new player trying to complete Path to Enlightenment by themselves, so I went over to help. We completed the event and they just took off running seemingly without even seeing the Mothman. I ran after them and gestured "Follow Me", as did another high level player who had joined us. But the new player kept running until they ran off a cliff. The other high player and I just did the "???" emote and moved on.
---
Woah, I can't believe I never thought of that! Duh.
---
The sink is a little bit faster than the water pump.
---
It's not an argument it's a fact. This isn't your standard rpg with a clear cut end, it's an open ended multiplayer online game that constantly receives new updates and balance changes, including an ever expanding endgame to keep veteran players satisfied after spending hundreds of hours playing
---
pc master race.
---
It’s hard to nail the highest level. The way the armor spawns, it shows up on the ground as if it’s a workshop settlement. From there you change the script to add whatever legendary effects you went then pick it up after. You can’t pick it up to check the level, or you won’t be able to add the effects

They waited until free weekend. As I said before, multi-faceted problem which you called me failing to reach a point lol.
---
I've been a Bethesda fanboy since Morrowind, and you aren't lying about them killing the company with FO76.  I am seriously questioning whether or not to even buy ES6 when that comes out.
---
This is Phenomenal!!!!
---
Glass caverns!  Some lame Youtuber found a usefule glitch for once:
---
1) run through glass caverns normally to the end. 
---
2) do NOT loot ANY of the Ultracite veins. 
---
3) when you get to end after killing all scorched, leave SB alive and jump into death pit to die and go back to beginning of level. 
---
4) now as you go back through, whenever you loot an ultracite there is aboot an 80% chance a wave of scorched will spawn and come at ya. Like 4 - 8 of them at a time. With the chance to spawn a santa scorched (that's what we called them). Just listen for the bells. 
---
5) and if you go with a team a wave will come after each player looting the vein. So space them out. Or try to do two waves at once.  
---
We ended up with about 25 gifts each from doing it with 2 of us. Took little over an hour. But if you have a team of four or eight spawning buttloads of scorched you can get close to 100 an hour likely.
---
We also tried to spawn as many as possible and looted 5 veins each at same time. But we only seemed to get a double wave. So I don't recommend that.
---
Happy Looting!
---
Some are precious. If the effects would be gold at max level, they are gold at level 5-10 too. 
---
Think about it: real damage comes from multipliers and perks, not from the piece itself. A bloodied faster fire handmade level 15 is only surpassed by a lvl 25, 35, 45 bloodied faster fire handmade. 
---
I recently sold a bloodied faster fire sledge hammer lvl 5 or 10 for 7000 caps. I put it as a joke and sold within the hour.
---
I had an egg head serum I was holding onto. Now I have the mutation after making this mistake. Oh well
---
Right. If we didn't love the game, we probably wouldn't be as vocal about it. My time would be better spent elsewhere. And yes, and "undercover player" would be an interesting development. I know a lot of us capture videos of these actions but going through these takes a considerable amount of time. However, a trusted source such as an "undercover player" could short cut this process considerably.
---
Weapon weight reduction? Alone yeah, that is pretty nice.
---
Why Wood?
---
"PC Master Race" indeed.
---
We ain't got these problems on PSN, js. 😘
---
If they did this because players are glitching inside, then I am one for blame XD. However I turn my camp into the Enclave's vault 51.
---
10-15k each.
---
I mean, it is a fresh batch of people who don't know what Nukashine is...
---
It’s part of the fire range daily I think
---
Except its not an MMO, its much closer to a survival game. Minecraft, ARK, 7 Days to Die, Conan Exiles, games like that. The game has MUCH more in common with those games than say WoW or FFXIV. It looks like Bethesda was potentially going for an MMO, but they came up way WAY short.
---
I have to disagree about the world. Yes there are distinctly different areas to explore, but I wouldn't say it's better than Triple A MMOs. It's about the same or worse.
---
Yes there's a ton of lore and notes and holotapes, but that's ALL there is. In most MMOs, there's a solid main storyline you're playing through and then there's lore and notes and whatnot for additional optional information on the side. So it's understandable in an MMO that some people will ignore that side lore, because they're focused on the main story. But in 76, the side story, IS the story. So you either spend time reading it or you get nothing at all.
---
The base building is fine. I personally don't like that 9 out of 10 player bases are gravity defying monstrosities, but maybe that's just me.
---
Weapon and armor crafting is basically copy-pasted from Fallout 4. It's worse in 76 though because you need to dismantle weapons and armor to learn weapon and armor mods, but your carry weight is so low that it's impossible to do this without being overencumbered every few minutes. You also can't remove a mod and put it on a new weapon, like you could in Fallout 4.
---
The community is good. Can't disagree there. Not that 76 is the only game with a good community, but yes, there's a good community here.
---
When it comes to things that I don't like about 76, it goes beyond human NPCs and monetization issues, although those are also big issues. The bad for me is mostly technical issues. Bugs, glitches, server issues, performance issues, disconnects, exploits, scams, cheating, lies from Bethesda, etc. And boy oh boy is it bad. It's a mess. When people ask about all the flack this game has gotten, imagine playing it on and off for a year and seeing little to no technical improvements. That's the frustration. The game is terrible, absolutely awful, in this regard.
---
Now when it comes to gameplay, that's subjective. Some will enjoy it, some won't, like any game. I enjoy the Bethesda gameplay loop, but the technical problems do very much get in the way of my enjoyment. Glad you're enjoying it so far.
---
My guess would be from the shooting range quest
---
I’ve never seen a legendary weapon with more then 2 status effects! I’m also level 98 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Box of Shooting Targets maybe? I know one spawns by the lockers (in the building with the tinker bench) at blackwater mine
---
because of the event tons of players are playing solo-worlds, filling up most of the servers.
---
i server hopped on PC for 30 minutes and kept getting dumped into the same 3 worlds.
---
Probably on a Tuesday
---
wait....Fallout 1st members even got a junk package in addition to their vault steel package? I thought they settled it on just the vault steel which already angered many players on its own?
---
Thank you. I just come on here really and journal about stuff I think about or that elicits a strong emotion when playing the game. I wonder anyways - what’s the chance of people actually reading any one persons post.
---
What do you mean by wipe? All hacked guns only? A lot of people would quit if their inventories were throw into the void and they were asked to start all over again if they are legit players.
---
The ridable buttercup horse is already a decent mod for fallout 4.
---
You on Xbox?
---
I very much doubt there will be a server wipe, but hopefully a ban wave when they've got a fix. Probably anyone with one in their inventory. I would say the cheaters are using free accounts to sell these, and hoarding the caps/trades on their paid accounts, so only the free account (and probably their sale/trade victims) will be banned. Hopefully they will be caught as well.
---
Not much has been added and PvP is in the worst state it’s been in since the game released. I’m still playing, but I can’t recommend playing again for anything outside of the holiday event. I suggest waiting until Wastelanders.
---
Food is plentiful, especially with carnivore mutations.  But dammit, I chug water like a hung over frat boy in the desert. thru hiker is my friend
---
Anything less than level 10 gets put on sale for 50 caps per star, once I hit scrip cap that is.
---
It is horrible, I try to keep bags of fertiliser just in case but my dumb ass always ends up scrapping it and having to travel about collecting more as the clock ticks 😒
---
I know. I love it
---
Alright, thanks
---
"Lever gun" plans are for sale at Camden and elsewhere.
---
Just happened to me today... was playing “One Violent Night” and then I died. Wasn’t able to Respawn even after mashing ‘A’ and had to rejoin server. By then the event was over...
---
I don't know..in FO76 you have to grind for legendary armor and weapon. If you don't want to spend money to buy atoms, then you have to log on everyday to do your daily.
---
why double posting?
---
Wood gives the best stealth.... But really, a full shadowed set of anything makes you invisible.
---
True, an active player optimally should not have that ability. However, almost any attempt a curbing this issue is welcome at least as a short term solution until they could put in a moderator spectator mode or other measures. A moderator would have to follow certain rules such as providing video evidence. There are plenty of trust worthy player that are both fair, honest, and competitive. And they could be restricted to suspending only blatant cheats. I'm not talking about the guy that is running no recoil mods, xray hacks, or ESP but the griefers that use obvious cheats like flying, shoot in the sky insta-kills, and lobby grenades. Waiting two weeks for someone to get someone like this banned is simply unacceptable.
---
Yessir
---
Tons of legendary enemies now with holiday event, so lots of scrip for purveyor
---
Yeah, that gets old real quick.
---
Best places for presents is the glassed cavern. 
---
Clear it without touching the Ultracite.
---
 Go back to the start &amp; pretty much every time you grab some Ultracite it spawns in 4 to 5 scorched.
---
Can be done solo, but the best results are in a team.
---
Check out the YouTube clip by Tyr.

If they serve to troll and annoy people, and you are here going on about how annoyed you were, then there seems to be a case for keeping them around no 🙂

Cause I post on r/fallout instead of r/fo76

It’s because I’m trying to explain using examples that require some of those words. What is a thought with shit to back it up, right? If you didn’t read it, then quite frankly anything you say about it is an assumption. That’s exactly what today’s society uses to alter understanding of meaning, and fact from belief. That’s resulted in some big social issues dood in the US right now. Thanks for agreeing with it, but pisses me off that you go saying that lol without even reading it!
---
I found that if you equip the chemist perk card, it doubles the amount of handmade presents you craft. Then of course is fighting super mutants selling &amp; selling their weapons.
---
I really don’t care who reads or sees what - it’s responses to the posts that intrigue me lol
---
But the atoms are for cosmetic items - not gear you actually need. And you can also spend caps to buy weapons and armor you want instead of grinding. In WOW you did the daily grind and you went to raids or you didn’t have the best tier armor you could get and that was the only option. In 76 you have a lot of options and you can mix and match to play the way you want.
---
Also you can craft serums to sell to the vendor to get your money back - with all my perks and stuff I get 500caps a serum
---
Except for the last part about the lvl 180 swooping in, you described the experience I had last night nearly identical otherwise. I went up to new player and did all of that you mentioned, I thought they were going to get the bag, but they just ran off and got themselves killed. So I just dumped the gun I was trying to give them, that would've probably saved their life into their death bag. 
---
Then, I had another lvl 20 Bloodied Pole hook I modded up nicely, found a player who could use it, and gave it to them. Helped them at that Scorched event at Morgantown Airport. I was then going to lead them into the airport to help 'em get the small backpack, but my game crashed. 
---
However, I'm sure that my being all decked out in the tattered Mole Head &amp; Mole Outfit didn't help the case I was making for being helpful.
---
Crazy life in Bethesda's Wasteland.
---
I find it super slow to level in this game until you hit level 35 or so.  Around then the perks add up and I have a few decent low level weapons.  I typically use a level 35 1* Bloodied Handmade. I went from level 32 to 81 on Friday alone, granted I played may 8 hours.  I just do the usual spots, West Tek, Harper’s Ferry, Whitesprings, and go to good events like Uranium Fever. 
---
Pretty much every double XP weekend I take a character from 1 to 115 or so.  The hard part is figuring out which character I like best and which to focus on.  This time I did a Bloodied Melee Power Armor build with a couple of legacy Gatling Plasmas for the ranged weapon.  It seems really well balanced, and might be my new main guy.
---
Personally IMO, best setup is 2 Bolstering/Powered/Harder 2 Detect, 2 Unyielding/Powered/Harder 2 Detect, 1 Chameleon/Powered/Harder 2 Detect.  But really I guess it depends on your goals in the game.
---
You will accept my kindness or suffer the consequences of my niceties!

Memories man. Fkn diablo 3 on xbox had a similar problem it was actually insane.
---
You're not wrong lol
---
It's not about taking the game too seriously. The game is very rough, there's many technical issues and Bethesda is a Triple A game developer with decades of experience. They have no excuse for screwing up so badly and they have no excuse for the technical issues barely getting fixed in it's first year.
---
The sad thing is, once you finish the quest, the game keeps trying to give you more broken Prosnap cameras.
---
Yes
---
Since I learned this, the only reason I see my friends use this exploit to kill griefers who are harming new players like during free week.
---
It's becoming a hobby of stalking low levels and giving them things.
---
Because it doesn't really?  With survival gone the only pvp left is dueling so if you run into some asshole who hits you with a weapon that explodes and lights you on fire and freezes you etc etc etc you just don't duel them again.

Downvoted for honest opinions. Gotta love reddit

You don't understand all of the bad reviews? Most of the 'bad' of 76 are technical issues. Bugs, glitches, server issues, performance issues, disconnects, exploits, scams, cheating, lies from Bethesda, etc. And boy oh boy is it a mess. When people ask about all the flack this game has gotten, imagine playing it on and off for a year and seeing little to no technical improvements. That's the frustration. The game is terrible, absolutely awful, in this regard. It's better than it was at launch, but not by much. That's why the reviews are so bad.

Now when it comes to gameplay, to whether or not the game is fun, that's subjective. Some will enjoy it, some won't, like any game. I enjoy the Bethesda gameplay loop, but the technical problems do very much get in the way of my enjoyment.
---
Yup, I usually do it on public ones, but have crashed during my private, and came back to the private with another character and it was the same session.
---
Near train stations is a good spot. Also, near Vault 76.
---
It doesn't have problems like any other game. It has way more problems and way bigger problems than most games. That's the difference.
---
Yeah a lot of them are touchy lol. It's like they're afraid people are going to attack or take advantage, likely used to BR games with open PvP, that or they're just not prepared to socially interact yet. A lot of people aren't used to others in their Fallout experience so they get spooked. It happens to me quite a bit, always has since the beginning though. 
---
I'm just glad we have a present instead of just a paper bag to draw their attention now though. Some still expect it's a mousetrap XD
---
Probably helps your enjoyment that 76 isn't an MMO.
---
Fertilizer has a 28.4% chance for 1 every 7 minutes.  I agree that they should have been higher, but that honestly sounds a bit OP for something you can just build and forget. Especially since you can build up to 17 Santatrons if you take all the workshops.
---
I love Elder Scrolls a lot. I'm gonna wait to see fan reviews and whatnot before committing.  I want a gem. Not a streaming pile of FO76
---
Because certain guns cap at 45 instead of 50. 45/50 are effectively the same weapon level.
---
you can play casually in any game. you don't have to do raid in WOW either. I am talking about what a lot of non-casual FO76 players do after they are done with all quests. If you want the best in slot gear in fo76, you have to grind for it. Also there is no structured dungeon or raid in this game either (vault 94 is not a raid), so you can't really draw a parallel on that. 
---
yes atoms are for cosmetics items but housing is a big thing in this game so a lot of ppl grind atoms to buy camp furnishings. 
---
maybe you play FO76 casually, but for a lot of current players whose main game is FO76, grinding for legendary and atoms are the reason they are still playing this game.
---
And that's just one bug. This game has tons.
---
Man that's some bad luck, so sorry.  I believe they are unlockable thru dismantling.  Gotta envision yourself unlocking it! Put the thought into the universe and make it happen!
---
Schrodinger’s gift box.
---
Yes, wipe it fresh so everyone who played normally loses everything just so the hackers hack their shit back in day 1. Punish the innocent and effectively do nothing to the hackers. Thats a good call.
---
Exactly what I keep telling people.
---
Good to know, will have to keep an eye for it on sale.
---
Sure
---
Doesn't that defy the entire glass cannon approach of blooded?
---
I just pay attention to what I'm selecting in my Pip-Boy before opening it.
---
You bought 20 of what?
---
Lmao
---
Toys are the best way If I remember correctly
---
There's tons of glitches that are still around since launch. Shit, there's glitches in 76 that were imported from Fallout 4. None of it is excuseable.
---
But hey, if people are still giving Bethesda money for Atoms and 1st subscriptions, why would they fix anything (serious question)? You're already giving them your money.
---
It is a bit fun. I'm about to login and see if I can terrorize some of them with kindness.
---
Oh, I don't have a schedule. Just anytime I'm on and the person is willing.
---
I can drop my crafting tables and stuff when I need em
---
Damn that looks fun! I need to start checking out other people's camps
---
What is your definition of an mmo
---
I build 20 santatron station in workshops
---
Nah, it was a package that had a shit ton of every resource. Basically hundreds of each flux, nearly 1k vault steel, and bigger amounts of pretty much everythig else lol.
---
Charleston capital building is the best I think
---
Ah gotcha. Totally read that wrong.
---
I have a nice Responder camp right outside Flatwoods.  I even incorporated one of the Responder signs.  If you are on Xbox stop by and check it out.  gt:shadyrebob
---
Wait, you know you can go to the purveyor and buy weapons with 3 effects for 100 script though right ?
---
No salt unless u count the salt from me eating a a serum i dindnt need
---
I believe only the handmade got nerfed.
---
Pipe rifle has always been 18.
---
IKR, I've seen tons of the too.

Go to Abbie's bunker, go a couple 100 feet south on the road until you see a bus. 3 wendigos (5-8 screws each) should spawn around there, just server hop until you've killed enough of them.. :)
---
In abandoned bog town in the cranberry bog theres an office building that you can get into using the fire escape. It has a bunch of typewriters, desk fans, and globes
---
I like how the wife and sister sound like used cars in that last sentence.
---
Oh okay. I have only ever put a drum on my handmade. Then I switched to perfortating after the nerf. Now I always run swift mag. Gives you 5 extra rounds, reloads faster, costs 5% less vats. Perforated costs 20% extra in vats
---
I think the world would be 100x better if you could pick up and move objects like the engine in Skyrim would allow. The only interaction as it stands is pick up or drop as a paper bag..

Sugar Grove has fans.

I'll give you an upvote to counter the salt coming from over paying PC players. Playstation over PC all day everyday since day 1
---
Which items are excluded from the loot pool for lower levels? Is there any rare high level ones you might miss out on with this method? 
---
This is the first I heard of this method so I was just curious if there is more information out there on it.
---
Quiet, you fool!
---
Haha sorry! 😅 guess the cats outta the bag now
---
Yep no reason to run the drum anymore.
---
I use stinging because it gives me more ammo than the drum mag with added armor pen.
---
"ED" hasnt been seen today, but a certain "dataminer" appears to be the new ED today.  Flying around the map, 1 shotting people and killing the entire match in less than a minute
---
The armour piercing mags are pretty nice on scorch beasts and stuff, but that vats cost difference puts my handmade at 0 ap cost per shot
---
Been having this issue with combat rifles. Once I got to 6 left I stopped getting mods learned although I haven’t scrapped nearly as many as you but easily 100 combat rifles straight without a single mod learned. Thought I was just very unlucky
---
That effect was present in Fallout 4, you find a group of NPC enemies, shoot the strongest of them with a critical and he goes frenzy - starts killing everybody around. You just watch as they kill each other and then wipe out the rest.
---
There is another interesting effect - "Freezing". On a  critical hit your enemy gets frozen entirely. This is gonna be a new PVP meta.
---
Full lists of all new available effects (check Tier 4 and Tier 5):

---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_armor\_effects](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_armor_effects)
---
Some of the names of effects are off but otherwise it seems to be pretty accurate.
---
Because you have the prime alternatives, which are drop off by the SBQ.
---
Since it's a backup I'd go combat knife or something lite with Swing speed. 3 1 point cards and value point in incisor or martial artist.
---
I keep a junkies/SS/+1 star bowi for this and just throw on the cards when I'm roaming low lvl areas or felling frisky. Melee is strong so don't need much to be deadly especially with bloodied or junkies.
---
I'm currently rocking a white tux with the white wolf hat.
---
There are 8-10 prime alternative mods for the combat rifle? Pretty sure it’s just the prime receiver I have 10 or so unlearned mods &amp; 100 scrapped rifles have given me nothing is what I’m saying
---
What about a deathclaw gauntlet? Honestly pretty aesthetically pleasing
---
Diners, schools and offices.  Pepper mills and hot plates, globes, fans, type writers, toy cars and trucks and buttercups.  Remember to tag screws as you're hunting.
---
Insanity aside, have these three effects “+20% damage” “Critical hits causes target to go into a frenzy” and “target burns 24 dmg for 3 seconds” been added? I left the game for a few months so I just thought maybe Bethesda added these or something.
---
They claimed it was "fixed" in patch 16 but unsurprisingly, it wasn't.
---
when they are the same level and have the same mods, they do have the same stats
---
It was always there.
---
Ill give you like 5k caps.
---
I sell them 2 u
---
Nice! Kill all the creatures you see for that  xp. They add up
---
legendaries are most important
---
but overall yes 👍🏼
---
Thats where im at, 1000 screws but i still loot every fan and typewriter in sight
---
PS4 unfortunately but appreciated
---
I'll start doing that I've been avoiding them at the moment. I'm always worried about giving my location away.
---
Oh yeah, all you guys on console paying for two subscriptions just to play a broken game are *so* superior.
---
Oh dang! I didn’t know this thanks for the tip, all my legendary weapons are mediocre I didn’t know you could buy them now

For its Grape Mentats, Rogers Reserve and Ionized meat!  And I’ve eaten/drank A LOT!!  the random bounce up one row, thing... is driving me nuts.
---
What’s you’re GT? I’ll msg you tomorrow at about 3:00 cst so we can meet up
---
Fallout 76 is the only game I play :)
---
I’ve had this bug happen- had to close the entire game and reopen it
---
What!?
---
I agree it is surprising how slow they have rolled out obvious things.  I guess we should view it as hopeful since it would seem they are playing the long game.
---
If u wait like 10 minutes it actually let u respawn but its totally annoying for sure
---
I’m pretty sure you can buy the shadowed plans at the grafton station
---
I’m on a very similar boat. Haven’t played but maybe 2 hours since fallout 1st subscription launch.  Got the game on back burner until wastelanders.  I already have amazing legendaries so grinding for more is no fun anymore. Why would me playing alone and paying make the same grind any better. I never have stash issues and my playing vendors are always full of legendaries. Wastelanders has to be good.
---
But the most important question, does that mean explosive energy weapon drops are back?
---
Source of people saying "they did that because players were glitching inside"? I glitch through anything frequently in my sessions, and vault interiors were no longer accessible after Vault 94 update when they introduced instanced cells. You can still glitch through vault doors, same way you can noclip through anything, but now you just fall and teleport to the closer Z position on the playable area, because there's nothing behind vault doors now in the "main" map. I didn't tried older vault doors in the last updates, but it's possible they put back some mapped interior, but not on the main map. 
---
If you don't know what you're talking about, don't affirm anything. To me it's not intentional, I mean, the door was fine before. It's opened like a normal door. You can see it from the other side of the ground.
---
Where have you been finding the Santa dressed scorched? The only place I could find them was Helvetia.
---
Right there with you man, same guy has been in 4 straight games with me
---
I have a nocturnal one with reduced weight for the same purpose.  It would be a better graverobbing tool with the nocturnal effect, but whatever.  LOL.
---
The thing is Bethesda dosent give a single fuck, there is literally nothing they can do. What’s gonna happen, they gonna ban him? Clearly not people scam and get scammed all the time its an online game I suggest u get over yourself and move on shit happens bro it’s part of the game don’t like it? That’s tuff.
---
Gaaaaaary!
---
Bethesda doesn’t care about scamming
---
If you pick up the holotape you can listen to it during gameplay. It stays with you for the match.
---
490 I think on one of my characters, 15 strength, radicool, deep pockets, and level 50 high capacity backpack. 
---
Obviously drugs and alcohol could make it go higher.
---
To boost it any higher an not rely on food or chems, is having all armor pieces to have +1 str and unyielding and have a main weapon with also +1 str. After that you can eat radstag steak for +20 weight  and drink rad ant lager for +50 and wear a high capacity backpack for 120.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
Yup known bug, reset game, or just go ahead and hit play, and then quit to main menu, if you want to switch characters.
---
How so? Havent played in a while
---
I’m actually surprised they haven’t made it a marked location, course once they do that, then you won’t be able to build a camp there.
---
Same, but ive noticed stuff with explosive on it hits like a weak noodle
---
I just want better capacity in power armor. You pretty much need excavators and the +50 carry legs to keep up with what backpacks and the option for bonus strength from legendary effects. When you tie in the -15% weight perks it really cripples how much PA users can carry comparatively.  
---
If you wanna have a combat set of power armor you're gonna have to give up 200 or so pounds of capacity (at least for me) which means you gotta really limit what you carry/loot. Sure you can argue it's a combat set it shouldn't have good carry capacity but non-PA can get both function and carrying capacity easily.
---
So I would say if legendary power armor gets added just allow it to have some small utility stars and none of the super impactful ones. The mod slots on power armor is very lacking in some utility options.
---
I'm glad for the challenge for lower high level players, but they should nerf it a bit for the coming to fruition quest. It's impossible if you're a lower level character
---
I never argued that Power Armor was the more convenient option: it's obviously not. The non-combat bonuses are largely superior to that offered by PA. To be fair, a set of Excavator with Calibrated Shocks will net you 200 carry weight and double ore in addition to the other PA QoL perks (limb damage protection, 90% rad resist, faster stims). 
---
Power armor has the obvious inconvenience of having to exit your PA to use workbenches, the need for Fusion Cores, and the lack of good QoL perks like WWR. It does have some neat QoL effects though. You've got the Targeting HUD as well as bright headlamps which are nice. Jetpacks are also available and very fun (bird bones + Jetpack is near flight). Conventional armor's bonuses are better though.
---
The main point is that power armor gets a much worse rap than it should. It's a very combat effective tool with its own unique set of perks. QoL is much less important than combat effectiveness to me, and I adore my power armor build.
---
Lol I didn't realize the plan was that rare at the time and just learned it.
---
Is that also where they put wastelanders?
---
Blame the makers of alcohol for drunk drivers? I get people are hating on bethesda right now but blaming them for hackers developing tools to hack is a dumb concept.
---
I’ve seen the short suit a lot for 8k and the long suit for 12k

I always have a bag of stuff on the doorstep of my CAMP.  Granted the CAMP is rather unfinished after moving and starting a rebuild that I'm dragging ass on.  Xbox, NW corner of the map.  Usually drop ammo, plans, maps, and random grub.
---
If you're on PSN, I CAMP up the hill from the golf course, and can guide you through safer farming techniques. Level 40 is perfectly reasonable, as long as you keep the high ground.
---
At least 5. Also took a herd mentality trying to open regular holiday gifts.
---
It takes as long as it takes for you to come to the realisation that being scammed is something you’re responsible for not Bethesda and that you have to just harden up and learn from it.  If it helps many of us learnt the same lesson the hard way too.
---
You just gave them a new subscription idea. Access the vaults for only $5.99 a month! (And on a "private" server)
---
Damn these numbers are impressive I can do 295 on a good day no power armor. My mismatched armor has Weight reduce for food, ammo, chems, etc. 
---
I really have to get one of those backpacks.
---
I PvP pretty often, and that underestimation helps me clap cheeks all over Appalachia. 
---
Power Armor's 42% reduction is superior to the 40% with a 25% chance to fail offered by Assassin's. So unless you're planning on standing completely still and bunny hopping, Power Armor is actually going to outperform your typical Assassin's Sentinel set. Frankly, mobility is key in today's meta and I find Sentinel highly overrated.
---
It may not be better, but it's damn good and absurdly less expensive.
---
Yo. Wavy Willards + Can do 👌🏼
---
Honestly, just stash your junk and hop into events. Someone'll kill you in short order.
---
What happened is youtube made it where your video has to be at least 10 minutes long to get a second AD. 2 ads is twice the revenue which is why lots of videos stop a little after the 10 minute mark
---
Dude power armor does not give you 42% less damage
---
I thought I was the only one who used that build.
---
Full set of Unyielding Cav Trapper Armor
---
Great. Now I’ll NEED to get the Santa outfit when they rerelease it.
---
It's basically a re-skined water pump.
---
If you think that 500+ Dr and ER is making you that tanky you're mistaken, my Dr is 300 and er is 450 and I can tank 110s while I'm bloodied with sentinel assassin, I'm sorry but power armor doesn't compare to it
---
It's at least planned. Before the purveyor even came out, we had a datamined table for prices related to legendary PA parts. There are a few legendary PA effects in the game already, but I'm not sure if they are just carried over from fallout 4. The 4* and 5* weapon/armor legendary effects that are carried over from fallout 4 are already modified and ready to drop though.
---
Hey, since the latest exploit allows people to create whatever items they want, maybe we will see the existing PA effects applied to legendary power armor and sold on PC
---
People downvoting you for having common sense... Really speaks volumes to our society’s mindset.
---
Yes. It does. Here's a link with info on its mechanics, but feel free to test it yourself.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_(Fallout_76)
---
I wasn't disputing the power armor combat benefits.  I was merely pointing out what it need is more QoL utility improvements not combat ones. 200 carry weight is nice but I get around that with my normal armor plus backpacks. 
---
I agree completely its combat viable. I'm a heavy support gunner. And I'm pretty competent in most PvE scenarios even in excavators.  I was just trying to highlight the issues with its non-combat capability.  Like lugging around fusion cores which weigh 3 pounds. Which means you need the energy ammo weight reduction perk to keep a good stock without amplifying the carry weight issues.
---
Apparently people that never lost their stuff got sent the package too randomly.
---
I have 'em for  sale at my camp, now. Heck, I have a pile of gifts that I'm selling as well.
---
One of the office buildings in Charleston has typewriters and desk fans
---
I always run through this tunnel for the glowing fungus. From start to finish, with green thumb, chemist and super duper, you can craft almost 100 RadAway!
---
I never liked them to begin with. I got a few TSEs back before the nerf and sold them within a few hours because of how boring it was. I instantly sell any bloodied weapons I find. Most of what I keep around is stuff like a vampire's gatling laser, quad tesla rifle, exterminator's explosive harpoon gun, etc. There are only a few genuinely powerful weapons I keep just in case
---
The point is just that it feels really dumb spending all my time trying to find stuff like that when now people can create whatever they want. Supposedly those fallout 1st boxes that had 100+ vault 94 steel are being created by the cheaters as well as all the legendaries and unobtainable items
---
That last bit is so depressing.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet does more damage than my meathook running the same cards. I use it most of the time but I’m full bloody melee with a rifle as my backup - that said the bloody combat knife with swing speed is a sweet thing and it’s great for everything except scorchbeasts/sheepsquatch
---
I am currently in a scrapping trance with joss stick, incense and a mediation bell, I am one with the universe and another 500 Leather Left Leg... no more mods still at 10/14
---
It is now a mission and I will continue until I get 14 just because
---
Around the Overseer's CAMP just after the bridge on the way to Flatwoods. It's like a strip mall some servers.
---
I’d be interested, I really enjoy CAMP building in general.  Do you know what type of look or location you want?  I have some time this week where I can help you.  PSN is Coogr77

Why man... Just why?

It's the same number of characters to say AAA..
---
You’re only squishy if you don’t pick good perks and grind out quality gear.  I can’t remember the last time I died that wasn’t a result of accidentally backing into the edge of a nuke zone.
---
We agree on that, for the most part. I was just pointing out a few QoL perks that PA does offer. One I forgot is that PA parts that are equipped are weightless. That helps a bit.
---
I have scrapper only at the moment no armourer or super duper but apart from I think steel that I have thousands of anyway, I'm getting back all the mats I use, but my finger is tired from all the key presses.
---
Only worth 339 caps.... obviously a crap gun. That's why I just stick to my exploding mole miner gauntlet, it's worth 1276!
---
No kidding, really! Wow, I shan't hold you to it😉  but will do a bit of vendor hopping, thanks for the tip 👍
---
&gt;Fallout 1st members even got a junk package in addition
---
I've got 1st and I didn't get anything extra. The best guess is that some folks lost junk and didn't realize it and so ended up getting the package, but those are few and far between.  Mostly only those that lost their stuff got the package.
---
~ *disable*
---
Character stops existing.
---
My 42% damage reduction applied before my 500 DR and 600 ER makes me pretty damn tanky, my dude. Sorry, but the numbers are available.
---
Cheaters did already kind of do that. Their out of control duping got some of the most overpowered things in the game toned back down to the rest of the stuff. And I guess it probably sped up the dupe patches as well? But considering it took bethesda months to fix publicly known exploits, it scares me to think how long it would have taken if people weren't filming themselves creating hundreds of tse handmades and then selling them for real cash. Of course, it would be lovely to just have everything balanced properly instead of just nerfing, and have content be actually released instead of needing to be cheated in, but we do not live in a perfect world and this is by no means a perfect game
---
awesome!
---
Best method I found is:
---
1. Bed and Cranberry Cobbler (or even better relish) before every mission
---
2. Seize the workshops in the west (north and west of the river). Don't build anything in them unless you don't care about legendary scorched, and anyway you want all the kill XP that turrets will take away. Return for defend quests. Ideal is if you have access to a private world. But you can join other people's defences if they already took a workshop. Pop a mentat before the event ends to maximize XP.
---
3. Buff your intelligence. 
---
4. Consider egghead (+6 INT). I have a second account so I can always count on Class Clown or whatever it is called to reduce the negative effects. I also can always count on herd mentality. If you are at 36 you should already have starched genes. 
---
With the above and 6 INT (though with herd ment it is 8) I routinely get over 800 XP per defend. Racked up 22 levels today
---
My Intelligence is only 3, so that may be affecting the chances of the later mods then, I shall look to temporarily increase Int while doing this... cheers! still building my...build.
---
Is it a bug or a feature?
---
Bro.Im 82

I wish they'd make it F2P and cease development of all further content so that they could focus on better projects at this point.

I'm glad I had bought last year and glad I hit level for this helmet. It just works.

Yea same. Now we need to grind for the holiday swag!

They're from fallout 4
---
I’m at the junk pile across the street from the Pleasant Valley Train Station at Top of the World. You get a great mix of low, medium, and high level traffic. Many times I’ve fast traveled to my camp to find people using workbenches, the guitar, the rad shower, and bed. The only thing I have a lock on is the outbuilding which contained the resource collector. The location at the center of the map is convenient. Fast travel costs to the far north or south are cheap.
---
trading is dead btw don't count on that
---
Everything to do with this game is depressingly pathetic. They still haven’t even managed to fix the most minor or problems. Heck, in-game you can’t even change the email associated (that I know of) with your account on console. They never corrected this, (a year after it’s release mind you) so I wouldn’t expect them to ever do anything good for this title.
---
Blame them for having zero cheat detection in an online game.

We need to ban all this peaple by hardware and wipe all servers.
---
You're not as tanky Dr means so much less than a damage percentages
---
Power armor has a hidden 42% damage resistance. That's 7% per piece plus the frame. This is applied before DR/ER. Similarly, power armor provides a hidden 15% per piece for Rad resist to a maximum of 90%. Read the link I provided and stop spouting misinformation.
---
This means that unless you're benefiting from Sentinel, which is conditional, power armor reduces damage more than your armor. Sorry, my dude. Them's the facts.
---
can I trade for a lvl 1 pipe pistol
---
This is the aspect about our current society that you're concerned about?
---
/s
---
I also like to give out goodies to brand new players (I’m only lvl 45).  It was such a game changer for me when a high lvl player game me awesome armor and a handmade recoil compensated hardened rifle about a week ago.  I want to pay it forward, but I’ve had a few folks this weekend run away/ignore my gifts.  In all honesty, I prob would have been a little confused at lvl 1-2.  I got better results gifting lvl5+.  I think brand new folks just leaving the vault may be overwhelmed by the amount of game mechanics?  You’d think by Morgantown they’d get it lol.
---
A in-game item? I don't think that's a problem to be resolved.
---
I am too but for different reasons. While yes I feel yours. I think Wastelanders will be what we need to boast the game back to a positive view. Granted youtubers don’t sent out bad vibes. 
---
Once it comes out and maybe patch or two after the obvious bugs are hammered out things will shape up. 
---
I don’t think a battle pass or loot boxes or anything like that is needed. 1st fills that role just fine. Yes it’s lacking in overall features. It doesn’t mean new feature won’t come. 
---
I think the biggest problem is the playerbase. Sure you don’t have to like 76 or BGSA/BGS but that doesn’t give right to want to see the game go up in nuclear fire. 
---
I feel what we need is a better platform or group of players that actively want to see the game get better “promote” the game in a healthy that isn’t giving mixed signals.  Part of that is player/personal hope. We as active players all want to see it grow and get better but more often than not are just pushed out my people that just want to make it known that 76 “sucks” 
---
Imho we need to player faces. That’s what made 4-NV and all the others appeal more. The youtubers of old clearly aren’t too interested in the game. Only a few still do. Maybe that’s what we need is new faces.
---
At least we aren't flooded with hackers :)

I saw people shooting scorchebeasts attacks out of their pistol,spawning beeswarms  all over whitespring,and flying around like a scorchebeasts....
---
Saw people changing the vendor at r en gstation into a lead extractor,get free legendary 3 star items and selling it on ebay....
---
It's like a wendigo took an Osbourne's worth if Psycho and dumped a few dozen points into the Blitz perk. The only consolation is that the thwacking sounds as 30 people get fisted to death in half a second is rather entertaining the first time or two.
---
Cheers for the tip🤘
---
&gt;Just an idea if you wanted to spice up your monetisation for the game. It’s perfectly clear fallout 1st is targeted for us “whales” who often buy atomic points... 
---
You're part of the problem. People like you are the reason Starfield and ES6 are going to be full of shitty microtransactions.
---
It would have made better sense to make the vault an adventure mode location. Tie a quest line to it. Complete it and be granted the option to select NW at the main menu. Boom best of both worlds.
---
Depends on your play style. Everything except shotguns and pistols semms to do pretty well depending on your build. (not that they're terrible they just don't seem to have a meta build)
---
I personly love heavy guns and power armor. I'm a put a lot of lead in target kinda player though
---
Diablo 3 on PC still has similar problems.
---
Lol that's bull, you are nowhere near as tanky in power armor no matter what you think dude
---
The legendary loot pool? Because I just picked one up off a Scorched in Watoga yesterday.
---
It's all right :) i will try and craft some today and i hope i won't get duplicates of the ones i already have.
---
I thought blooded builds used rads to hold their damage
---
Are you sure, maybe it was just a black powder rifle? Dataminers confirmed it was taken out of the loot pool. I'll have to look up a source, I'll come back with it
---
No..... we all are the problem. We don’t like to wait for new stuff. We want our games faster and faster every year. We want new content every week and the likes. It’s not a bad thing if people want to buy stuff in between games.  Clearly those titles will have them if fallout 4-76 and Skyrim have them now. BGS/zenimax isn’t going to drop them because they are “hated”
---
Yes, because that has ever worked.
---
Oh, and I hope you don't plan on using workshops ever.
---
\+1 Perception ... literally worthless! 0/10 would sell for scrip!
---
With the amount of gifts we get from scorched, Beth really needs to up the chance of getting one from santatron... Its absurd how low the chance is.
---
Good points. Instant gratification does affect us all. Spending some money in game is fine, but spending assloads like whales do only encourages further monetization.
---
Those mutations are defensive. The game considers them attacks on anything around you. Plague Walker, especially. Get rid of them.
---
It just feels like nobody understands emotes half the time to be honest, I've tried to give things to people and its difficult as fuck!  They have to be staring at you for a minute straight while you emote head-on at them to even slightly understand, and god forbid I'm in Nuclear Winter trying to give the 25% health dude stimpaks...
---
I don't care  much for Dark Souls.
---
You can be one shot in NW in a dozen different ways. There's no babysitting nerfs in place.
---
yeah, we're gonna have to make our own Creation Kit with *this* game.
---
I C what u did thar....  ye accidentally consuming whatever is above them gets me salty
---
D:&lt;
---
Hey, that's where my camp is! :D It's so sweet. I put my store under the arch at ground level with stairs up in the back.
---
I believe you have to be 2 times the level
---
They aren't going to announce it. It's a teaser.
---
I still use mine for PVE, pretty viable for mobs. My bloodied handmade is far more powerful though.
---
That’s fine. Whales are whales for a reason. They spend high and get comped low. Same tactic as casinos. As for monetizations, it’s standard business practices. It’s here to stay and theres really nothing to be done about it. Sure you can stop playing the game and cut ties with the product it you’ll always have the faithful that don’t care about that in the end.
---
It's will still work, but it's below a few things now. Two shot will give 25% more dmg n explosive gives 20% more
---
In my opionon the new order is (not including all the creature based, pretty much just the all around dmg boosters) 
---
1. Bloodied
---
2. Junkies
---
3. AA
---
4. Ts
---
Scoot over Ghandi &amp; Martin Luther King Jr.  guy^ is catching up
---
Thx!
---
People are getting a ton of extra legendary with the current scorched event, to many to scrip and stash. So they're drop them
---
A certain degree of monetization is expected, for sure. My thing is whales only incentive companies to come up with new, shadier ways to do it. One day, some company will figure out how to monetize monetization, and whales will buy it.
---
You only have a 35% chance to get the plasma grenade plan out of 100 small or large gifts (46% if it's a medium/normal gift)
---
Is honestly say, as a veteran player, that you should probably look for a furious harpoon gun or a vampires black powder rifle maybe!!
---
I don’t know how nukacrypt operates, but I’d be happy to photograph each location. Since I’ve posted this question, I’ve been taking lots of pictures
---
Essentially it gets to the point where the only way you are gonna level is if you consistently win, otherwise having to get placed in at least the top 3.
---
Jk, don’t do that! Look up builds and figure out what kind you want to have and then as you level up, get the perk cards that support that build. THEN, try to get weapons that compliment that build
---
you got me thinking of coming back to the game
---
Yes, I'm sure. I've been playing since Beta. It was called "The Dragon." It was the first time I've seen it in a while. I also picked up a Blunderbuss for the first time in a long time.
---
It’s been “prophesied” already. By that point , once again the govs will step in and impose harder and more forced laws to reduce that. 
---
Those same people than said that even have said that should VR take off in the same idea as “SAO” that gaming will hit a “post scarcity” market where mtx and the like won’t even matter anymore.
---
A legendary blunderbuss or just a regular blunderbuss? Because I don't think they can drop as legendary
---
These were both regular items.
---
You only have a 35% chance to get the plasma grenade plan out of 100 small or large handmade gifts (46% if it's a medium handmade gift)
---
21% for 1 in 100 small and large non-handmade gifts. 30% for 1 in 100 medium non-handmade gifts.
---
Oh, I meant that legendary dragons are legacy, not dragons in general
---
If I keep seeing smart ideas from you Melodic, I'm going to nominate you for a lifetime achievement award
---
Honestly I just browse Market76 and see what junk or aid people need. As a first member you stockpile a lot of junk that others are in need of. Made over 20k one day just selling steel, lead, and gunpowder.
---
Meat hook, equip all gladiator and iron fist perk cards for max damage
---
I think this got introduced when they added the "New!" marker next to the Atomic Shop when there's new items in it.   Perfect example of "Touch thing A and thing B broke" which, let's face it, is kind of FO76s trademark now xD
---
It's great for low levels as you can be safe from Scorchbeasts.
---
Yeah they won't do anything about you being scammed. That's 100% on you. Never trade out side of market.76 (without the .) and watch people's karma. If you are trading out side of there never do it for more than 25k caps, the most someone can charge per item. Follow those rules and you'll never be scammed.
---
Awesome!!! 😊
---
Seems like this question gets asked daily and I'm not surprised, the game doesn't make this apparent at all, let alone obvious.  It's something that has confused a ton of people.  I feel sorry for non-Redditors
---
Hehe well he asked for help from a Real Nice Guy and he got it!
---
Wow you are going to be a great educator of knowledge. Jesus. Alright assume I didn't know any of what you just said, and that when I addressed the issue it was within your understanding of the context and situation when it happened. I know I know...we had the same exact items, at the same location, same server, so I must have been wrong. 
---
Your attitude scares me more than dupers - because your sneaky with your approach and unable to identify overtly expressing a disagreement with another person. That's okay man. You don't have to agree. Secondly, your attitude of "higher knowledge than...." means you are closed minded, judgmental, and are fucked in life. You lack empathy and are spiteful most likely cuz your main skill is this sort of "engagement" with others. 
---
Honestly just find connection and not absolute destruction with another. Lord have mercy.
---
Here's the master list for you. You can see level requirements on the right if there are any. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/htmlview#gid=0
---
Heck I’d even go for a vendortron. I don’t think it would be hard to implement. It would treated them same as a vending machine in terms of interaction with the owner and buyers. But you can put it behind makeshift counters.
---
I imagine it will be added but most likely a pricey paid cosmetic
---
Oh man, real original.
---
Kind of wild that this spot is getting more recognition. My CAMP is basically the same layout, except the balcony is greatly expanded and leads up to the U-shaped portion of the structure.
---
I''d say do it, good way to spend time, get some new lore, see some new locations.
---
That sounds cool! Would love to see it!
---
So as a ghoul you couldn't do that anymore rads would never increase just heal you instead
---
Is really fun! 
---
i had aTSE\*\*\* harpoon gun in my stash (after spending some script one day)  and 5 days ago i decided to try it. Oh.my.God. Really really fun (and insanely destructive). With the fletchettes mod on, the explosive perk at 5 and the big guns bobblehead my damage reads 1.400 (1.445?). And with the fletchettes mod i get back more harpoons that i begun with. I started with 500 crafted and i have now 3.500..... But is really fun! 
---
The only downside is that it breaks soon and i had to apply the  **Gunsmith lvl 3** perk card in intelligence for the " Guns break 30% slower ".
---
Yeah im working on finding a marsupial and health Regan serum, already found speed demon. I guess its back to inert flux and canned dog food instead of cannibalizing, toxic water, and spoiled meat.
---
I turned one of my vending machines into a freebie box for new players. I drop excess low level weapons and basic meds in it. 
---
Also had a great experience when I stumbled upon a level 9s camp that was 4 walls and a couple foundation pieces. I sent a team invite, certain they'd decline but they didnt. 
---
I build them a little box house, all work benches and some water purifiers. Decorated with some balloons. Dropped a bag of goodies and went on my way. 
---
I am enjoying the new players almost as much as the event.
---
So I assume this is for PC only?
---
[The interior space has changed a bit, but it's relatively the same](https://i.imgur.com/bVNIyfw.png)
---
Yeah man. A furiouse, ffr, 250 drwr harpoon, stick the barbed mod on it. God roll.
---
Gives him a level 50 weapon that he can’t you😂
---
Also people swear by certain armor. They'll only take their godroll armor if it's all Marine, Forest, Urban, etc. A lot of people also want the armor to be heavy so keep an eye out for that.
---
I really like it!!! So cosy!!! 😊
---
A Gary gun would be amazing. 
---
Bethesda please implement now. 
---
Literally my favourite slightly disturbing fallout 3D moment in the series so far going in that vault. Gaaaaaarrrrrryyyy.
---
Blaming the platform for a shity developed game.
---
Lol
---
You misunderstood the terminology, it's a 7% resistance boost not a 7% flat damage negation so like I said your wrong. Have fun not being tanky
---
It still works but you need to sneak right up to them, close enough to where you could reach out and touch them. Then you'll get the prompt to tame them. I've done this twice in a row during the past few nights.
---
I was clearing up your misconception of bloody builds being glass cannons.
---
Can someone make me a weapon like this? I’ll pay 1000 caps!
---
VAC focuses more on catching as many cheaters as they can long term while server admins are supposed to handle cheaters short term. It's not really a good choice for this game, where there's no admins and most of the issues are from people exploiting shoddy programming with netcode crammed in.
---
I love my VE harpoon. Great for mob control at WS, though the faster reload is essentially useless.
---
Its called editing. He cuts his dialog together.
---
"Or you can buy one of our servers and avoid all of those cheaters.  No need to thank us for fixing your problem." -Bethesda
---
I gi e away plans to newbies. Less weight. Pretty everyone has them. Except like pocket armor or weapons plans. I sell those. But furniture, jetpack, etc.. I give away.
---
Open gifts on a toon under level 5 for best chance at plasma grenade. Eliminates all plans with a level requirement from the loot pool.
---
600 theoretical maximum that I can calculate. No food / drink / drugs.
---
Looks legit to me
---
-some guy at Bethesda probably
---
Bethesda has went from a legendary studio to the new and improved EA. Even EA stopped microtransactions and release barely broken games. Bethesda ban their own players for finding and reporting exploits. Its outrageous
---
In Australia (at least where I am from) we call  water fountains bubblers so I kept looking for an actual fountain for way to long.
---
Sir, this is an Arby’s..
---
TSE rolling pin, hell yes. Good news, firsters get what they deserve supporting a crooked company...
---
The heater and sun mask should've been duped on all platforms as both I don't think we're ever even gotten on Xbox, can't confirm ps4 though
---
The Old Man Winter was def duped on Xbox. I remember seeing them all over ebay. The Sun Mask -was- rare but now seems not to be.
---
Furious ffr is dope on any single shot weapons
---
Stalkers melee weapons are OP
---
Yep lol I know the group that mass duped the winter ones, I've never even heard of anyone with the sun mask on Xbox or the jester
---
Dying.
---
PC had all but the Sun Mask. Now Sun Mask is no longer rare I believe. Like, it was super rare before.
---
They should definitely have another go with actual decent drop rates for those on consoles
---
No ghouls constantly gain radiation it why they reach stages like glowing and putred and things like nature even though the glowing part is supposed to be related to a fungus not actual rads. Lore wise a feral ghoul reaver carries enough radiation to kill someone in protective gear with just a bit so imagine a player who would never die but constantly gain radiation meaning there health bar who technically continue to expand due to how health and rads work for players
---
Nope. There really hasn't been skins for the weapons people really use lol
---
Lol figures
---
There's been like 3 death tambo skins though
---
I also have no interest in pvp.  I just want to explore the waste with my fellow vault dwellers in peace!
---
I mean, for solo players, it's a questionable level of effect. If you avoid people and do everything yourself, this might not have much of an impact. But if you trade with others, or pvp, or even just value yourself in any way compared to others, this might be completely game breaking. The trade market may be irreversibly destroyed within a few days, on a much bigger scale than duping thousands of god-tier legendaries. People are literally creating items that previously did not exist, or should be impossible based on current game logic (i.e 4/5 star effects, multiple effects from the same category, legendary items that can not normally be legendary)
---
It's fun.
---
Oh, man. Glad i took  a break from the game. Looks like it's gonna be longer than i planned

Assault rifles in perception

Ty that was exactly what I was thinking (just without private server) 👍

Unstoppable Monster is still my daily driver. I'd love a skin for it.

Great to know, thank you!
---
&gt;Really?
---
Really.
---
only the red asylum outfit and Fasnacht witch mask count my good man
---
Cool story bro.
---
Looks great.
---
I remember when I first peaked into the game with a friend about a year ago, we were also like:
---
“OK, this game has level-scaling, right? So let’s just ignore the quest and go exploring.”
---
So we turned right after leaving the vault, grabbed a pipe-pistol with 8 bullets and walked torwards Camden.
---
Didn’t really go well. The ammo was gone quickly, more ammo or melee weapons were not to be found, so we were punching and dying our way to the park.
---
The most fun was actually trying to beat up Scorcheds with a commie-wacker.
---
Refunded the game after that, came back half a year later with the free trail, and this time followed the questline. And wow, things were so much easier…
---
I do not run a bloodied build. I will look into stabilised, thank you!
---
my man I probably wouldn't enjoy your friendship in real life like holy shit look I'm not kidding this might be the cringiest post I've ever read in this sub - and thats saying something
---
thats cool man!
---
full autos if you're asking about perks
---
PC. Fast traveled to Whitespring station and there are is a level 6 player sitting in a Thirst campsite. I notice right away they have on thee hacked Sun Mask and a paper bag sits in front of them with a Sun Mask in it. 
---
I dropped salt and walked into the station. Saw them through the window go look in my "present" and shortly after they grabbed their mask bag and logged off. 
---
If you have one of these items, you didn't earn it. Not only do you know that, everyone else in the fucking game does to. So have some self control and discipline and play the game instead of cheating it.
---
Do you have unspent points?
---
Sniff, sniff, I smell BS, sniff, yeah definitely BS.
---
I've been trying with no luck. Sneaking, says im undetected. right behind the, still no tame option. :(
---
You'll be able to unlock the first rank of it after spending the first two points, then the next one on your next level. Unfortunately the game doesn't allow you to save up points to unlock the max rank of a perk right when it's available.
---
Howard is not the problem. He is just a puppet. Robert Altman is the problem.
---
It's often (always?) not visible for me when I launch the game.  If I start up, then "leave world" the "Character" option will be back again.
---
(This on PS4).
---
bet you're a 1ster. :)
---
Game has a devout fanbase I guess🤔 dwindling sure yeah but game isn't in an unplayable state to drive everyone off - game is not terrible, but you'll come to understand why game is lackluster which is I guess why high levels who one way or another don't leave the game are kind to beginners as theres really nothing to do
---
I enjoy buying items from the Atom Store with the Atoms I get from my Fallout 1st Membership.  
---
Hoping for a 1st flag (wall mounted one) or a 1st skin for the Corvega backpack, or both.
---
That was the idea 😂😂😂
---
Yo I feel this! I also work long days (not 12 hours thankfully) and have an hour commute. These events are always on the days I work. 
---
Thankfully.... This weekend's double XP goes to Monday 12pm ET so I'm able to at least catch a few hours on my day off! 
---
I'm also off Tuesdays frequently which of course is the day the game updates so I always lose a few hours of playtime to that. Meh. 
---
It's annoying but I just keep telling myself their target market or the majority of players must have weekends off. 🤷‍♀️
---
With botting, yes. But not with modded items like on xbox.
---
The real derivation of "sub".
---
The Christmas bundle was actually my xmas gift last year. I've really enjoyed it.
---
And almost everything else has been earned with in game atoms. I don't have the extra cashflow to pay for atoms.
---
I just finished all the kill scorched challenges about a week before this event started. This would be a great time to complete them.
---
Wipe all servers.... HA!
---
imagine how many of the dwindling player base they would lose doing that. I have been playing since BETA and have 1300 hours logged over 3 accounts. They wipe my accounts, then that is game over. 
---
Btw- this is a photoshopped picture buddy, though yes, the 5* weapons/armours have been making the rounds... which any sane person would avoid.
---
If you go to Morgantown don't forget the train yard and the highschool.
---
Agreed, been playing RuneScape for 15 years.
---
This is something different though. Just hope they can fix some bugs and a bit faster as it’s been to buggy to long, but they’re sitting on a goldmine if they can do it right.
---
Daisy is my favorite....Vault Tec Rep right behind her. Hoping these new NPCs give me the same feels!
---
What did i just read...
---
Right now I'm in the middle of the golf course, it's mostly flat, but I'm not picky about location or design.
---
I'll shoot you an friend invite when I get on in the morning.
---
I'm not sure
---
I read that a while back do u happen to know why just seems kinda dumb
---
The parking lot south of Cranberry Glade, the road between Sceneca Rocks Visitor Center and Monongah Power Plant, and the road just North of Pioneer Scout Camps have a decent chance for a solo Yao guai
---
and the midpoint between Johnson’s Acre and Relay Tower EL-B1-02 has a decent chance for a rad toad
---
There's wood armour collectors who will pay a lot for it. Also you can shroud wood which gives stealth and extra sneak speed. So if you get wood armour with a sneak legendary prefix it'll have sneak X 2.
---
Put all your unwanted plans in the Whitespring station suitcases.. I'll take it all and bring it out to a desolate cliff where it will be dropped and never seen again. - NewtGin Grinch
---
It doesn’t have one? Opening large holiday gifts today I found a prime capacitor for the gauss rifle which made me think they must all have the potential
---
Ive been killed by melee enemies standing on a box they shouldnt reach
---
I am only keeping 2 of the 'rare' taxidermy ones.
---
In the first few months of the game I put a lot of effort into acquiring PA plans, which were rather grindy to acquire (to put it mildly), thinking they could be a valuable commodity moving forward.
---
Shortly after acquiring a workable amount the devs put all the PA mod plans on vendors rendering my little scheme null and void.
---
Not going to bank on such things anymore considering that I have zero control over their design choices.
---
I got all the prime reviewer plans u can get a couple days ago.  Are they really that rare like people say?
---
I think you meant to write something other than "1." but reddit's smart formatting thought you were trying to do a list.
---
So here I write "2.":
---
2. But reddit thinks it's a list and so puts "1.".
---
\2. Here I prefixed it with a \\.
---
I resorted to dropping a bunch of meh 1-2* gear yesterday. Out in the bog, overencumbered, and legendary scorched running around everywhere. Still, a good time.
---
Yes, for me that's true. My Sequine Dress turned into the Gala Dress. And the Sequine Dress disappeared from my workbench.
---
Yea I've actually mentioned that to a teammate saying "Watch the devs add all the plans to the game after the event is over" I definitely wouldn't put it past them. In which case I'll probably just give them away to new players.
---
So, your suggestion is to wipe accounts and such? Why would that even be on the table?
---
My suggestion- ban anything over 3* (4* sacrificial blade not included). I got my hands on dense plans, shielded armour plans etc this weekend for a few thousand caps. Would that mean i would also get banned? Who knows. Who knows what bethesda are gonna do/if they do something about this? Who knows who will be affected of they do something. I am unsure how this is gonna work.
---
Side note: this looks fake
---
Add another image before the troll face on the imgur because the troll face istge post thumbnail..
---
Yea my team gets very happy each day when the scrip resets. That or we just sell our excess to vendors. Still its fun &amp; some of the low level legendaries are great to gold onto for future builds.
---
It's to deal with the complaints from the people who lost theirs.
---
Can be useful for the "mod a camera" challenges.  But I haven't seen any of those for a while.  :(
---
 Here's a direct quote from the above:
---
"The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. Damage and radiation resistance provided by each piece is then applied to the remaining amount"
---
You either have poor reading comprehension or you didn't bother reading it at all. Either way, you're completely incorrect and this conversation is pointless. You're just wrong, bud.
---
Damn.  Now I've got to change my PIN again.
---
Use the terminal at your camp
---
troll face what are you talking about?
---
....wut
---
Do you have the helper terminal you can build at your camp, the one that's free in the Atom Shop? Because it has a prompt that'll add a quest marker to wherever the dead tourist spawned. They added that a little after they added the terminal itself.
---
Pro bro. What's a "load screen"? 😘
---
Sadly for me i only have the " gather wood " left,abd there is no trick to that.
---
ITT: some spilt fuckin tea
---
I have been locked up/froze up well over 10 times in one hour of play before. Die at events and can't respawn. Enemies standing around headless unkillable. Items needed for quests still getting auto scrapped. Fun times. Fun times.
---
Heh:
---
&gt; The US Corps of Engineers broke a long-standing tradition in naming what was called the Summersville Project. Tradition holds that the project will be named after the town nearest the site of construction, unless named for a person (such as Hoover Dam). However, the town of Summersville was not the one nearest the dam. The village of Gad (located near the present-day marina) was literally flooded at the opening of the reservoir. After briefly considering the name "Gad Dam," it was instead decided to name the project after the next nearest town – Summersville.

---
Oof, I’m so mad at myself right now. I even googled to see if there was a better way and only old guides showed up.
---
Yes theres a prime and a prime automatic railway rifle receiver
---
It must hurt to be this wrong. Happen to you often? I'll bet it does.
---
I get where you're coming from and agree in a lot of ways - how other people play (in adventure mode) doesn't really effect how I play.  But imagine being in any of the group events when you can't even get a shot onto things before they die because everyone else has ridiculous weapons that are beyond the game's design intent.  Maybe if I only play on a private world, then this won't have any effect, but I like playing with other people.  
---
Long live the PS4 and Xbone I guess.
---
Someone had to maintain the reactor vaults are infamous for things going wrong.
---
Hahahahaha!
---
I was going to suggest storing the tutorial in your rectal passage for safe keeping but no, actually this one should be gvien as much publicity as possible.
---
An excellent breakdown of the problem!  I'd only add that Bethesda also did their usual abysmal job of communications by saying nothing at all for months while this went on.   They didn't say so much as "Duping will get you banned, we're actively looking into this, in the meantime just know that duping WILL GET YOU BANNED" - they said nothing, like there was no issue to even look into.   For months.  Sigh
---
They were rare, until Santa scorched turned up
---
Would love to see some videos of those hackers.
---
Lot of my friends don't trust me about all those hackers
---
But how does it perform?
---
It counted for me with my red asylum dress
---
Should be easy for Bethesda to purge the servers from these weapons.
---
Nah I’m good.
---
Only 2 left for me, but I have no idea if I'll ever make it:
---
1. Good Grief! Kill 20 people.  So far only managed to kill 7 wanteds.
---
2. Field Medic.  Revive 20 people.  Doing a bit better on this.
---
Both are real hard work for a solo, PvE type player.
---
I mean, yeah. This.
---
Anyone supporting hacking or duping in Fallout 76 should be perma-banned.
---
Meth is a hell of a drug.
---
It’s a damn shame there’s no prime auto for the railway
---
I set up a basic camp right outside vault 76 for a short while, with one vending machine with a fully modded level 1 pipe piston, modded vault suit, modded leather armour, a few hundred rounds of .38 a handful of stimpacks, radaway etc, a starting kit for any new players that came across it. 
---
It was saddening the amount of high level players that would take everything
---
Wait...I only have heard of Modafinil?
---
this game is now like diablo 2 open battle.net
---
A more functional game
---
I've been enjoying dropping holiday gifts for everyone, but especially low levels.
---
If anything it is easier to run anti cheat in a game like 76, the devs are just both lazy and incompetent
---
Yeah super mutants are secretly obsessed with hip-hop
---
There is a prime, but its semi automatic no full automatic
---
I gave one kid vintage nukashine and said it’s a magic trick that will make him disappear.......he disappeared alright
---
My grandad and granny used to dress up as santa and mrs. Clause then give us gifts. (•_•)
---
Glad I got your attention fellas;) More to come
---
How so... i know all the mods on the railway and I dont see a prime automatic
---
It’s incredibly hard to give things to new players there dumb as a box of rocks
---
Right now, it's about 446 with a high capacity backpack and unyielding gear
---
Game is wrecked. How can they possibly fix it now? Other than paying a sub for a private world? If by some miracle they can stop hackers and cheating in this game especially in NW then I might regain some faith in FO76. Otherwise best to just wait for FO5.
---
For PvE who cares, as long as it can kill shit, you're golden.
---
For PvP, ahh there's people who can get into that in deal depth but you'd have to specify what you like to do / how you like to play
---
are there any more unique items from quests like this?
---
I already have the inert bomb
---
One of my characters is a bloodied unarmed build and the ghouls at whitespring love to kill her at range with radiation.  It’s so super frustrating.
---
Don’t forget that mrs claus scorch has a dick bulge
---
I don't know about that even wiki says they're immune and healed by background radiation and nuclear fallout plus there's been enough normal ghouls living in a center of horribly irradiated places like the doctor seeking solitude and numerous raiders in 4. It also states that how they received the initial radiation can determine what type of ghoul they become and isolated or antisocial ghouls are more likely to become feral. There's also been cases of glowing ones who didn't go feral.
---
I went into glass caverns earleir tonight with some friends we went in with like 2 legendaries each and left with about 20 each
---
If I knew more about discord I would set one up. But I'm useless lol
---
While not really concerned with hourly events, the drops are pathetic to say the least...
---
I'm really hoping that things improve over the next few days, because right now, the presents stink!
---
And I've noticed it really doesn't matter where you find them, they all drop literal junk. And what's up with the Santa bot? So after the holiday season, they revert to scavenger bots, and everyone gets to keep them? OK, I'll be cool with that, as long as I get my Atoms back that I spent to get one back when they first came out.
---
I'm also very disappointed that the icicle and Santa Crash plans are so rare, we won't be seeing very many CAMPS decorating with them. I haven't seen any icicles, nor Santa legs sticking pout of the side of a CAMP wall, but I have seen the plans in vending machines for insane amounts of caps.
---
If these scorched don't start dropping good stuff soon, I'm going to really start cutting back on my play time, as well as spending money on a subscription or Atoms...
---
Bethesda is making the game so boring, it's becoming painful to play every day. I get rare, but impossible is just too far. I've been grinding hard this weekend, and have nothing but junk to show for it. Thanks Bethesda, thanks for aggravating me to the point of quitting...
---
Wow, that's a ton of stuff to put on the line at once for a game known to be unstable at times. I mean I feel you. shame on bethesda for not being stable as it could be, but also shame on you for committing that much inventory to a single transfer.
---
I use the exact train station in morgantown to do nearly the exact same thing. I use the green suitcase just next to the stash box and vendor. I transfer spare meds and mutation serums though. I sell all the serums to get my daily across all 5 characters in under 30 minutes. all my alts have multiple days of stuff already stocked and on my main I do not sit on excess inventory long I tend to do more smaller safer transfers just in case of a catastrophic failure of the game. 
---
I do not transfer huge quantities at a time though. the green suit case has weight limits. I think you are the one actually glitching it out but I am not sure due to the fact that I am unsure what the max weight is on the suitcases.  I do know a weight limit exists because I have gotten messages not allowing me to store anything else due to the weight limit. 
---
to me reading the problems you are describing I get the feeling that you are doing some duping, I also get the feeling that you may be running mods that are destabilizing the game. also do you live near the train station and have a huge elaborate base? 
---
I am on PC but I do the exact same thing and have had 0 losses of inventory. I am prepared for the inevitable crash though and do not put all my eggs in one transfer. 
---
If I were customer support, with the numbers you have given me and not having verifiable evidence I would most likely deny your request as well. sorry this whole scenerio is fishy. I would investigate you for duping as well.
---
In one word: NO!!!Bethesda needs to attend this and FAST!!!
---
I’ll add you; most of my plans are 15 caps each but I don’t mind donating to help a new player
---
Stack Overflow, you get (max scrip -1) scrip
---
This is great to know.
---
add Chrissyfly
---
I have a 100 or so plans that I sell for 10 caps each. You can have them all for free.
---
oh and I will also continue my fallout 1rst subscription along with buying whatever atom shop items I deem. I have enjoyed my purchase so far immensely.
---
Well its more comparing pineapples to apples, both are "apples" but I dont think you can get pineapple pie
---
I bet he's looking for a nice Deathclaw gauntlet
---
This is true, I have a picture of someone's inventory and I saw I Prime Railway receiver
---
I agree. Wipe the servers. Then never reinstall FO76 again.
---
I accidentally did this with Halloween plans got like 6 Pumpkin ones lol
---
It's risky. I have done the same moving deeper pocketed/dense armor, shielded underarmor and spears to my new characters using the trainstation method then the world disconnects. But it was not fo1st private world at the time. Many times the method worked before and after successfully.
---
Looks like you rolled in high stakes with those items. Sorry for your loss.
---
If odds of dropping certain plans are constant, level of character who opens the gift shouldn't matter.
---
you should definately have an alt account friended in which to do transfers with if you do that many transfers. I use my wifes account if its high level and were about to get a third account just for storage and vendor shop running.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
He's on ps4, he can't mod. But I agree with you, maybe it detects a duping attempt. Also, screenshot are saved in the HDD even if you delete it in game, to me it looks like some faulty hardware. One thing I learnt from moving from pc to ps4 a year ago, a console, especially the ps4, is not the perfect platform bugfree and stable the community claim to be when comparing to the pc community.
---
No thanks. I’ve been playing for a year and finally starting to find gear that works for me. If this was some PVP game I may agree but it’s not.
---
No way, once the story is done, the main point of the game is the grind. For weapons, armor, plans, etc.
---
There's no way I'd be okay with losing all of that progress, just to do it again. This isn't a competitive game, I don't see what the point is in leagues.
---
We just don’t know at this point. They hinted in parallel but that doesn’t make any sense.
---
500+ hours in and I’ve completed this daily easily 20+ times... and I never realized they had to be the same color set. 
---
I just have a set that I have renamed and keep on me at all times. Same thing for a Clown Suit &amp; Hat, Sunglasses, Fasnacht Mask, Police Uniform, etc.
---
This is incorrect. I mix and match all the time.
---
Don't forget lead belly! The lime gummy ghouls are killer!
---
Yes, I've been leaving NukaShine in Flatwoods containers since opening gifts gives you so many and they only sell for 1c at robo vendors.
---
I leave ammo as well.
---
So why the OP have problems when mixing while I never have a problem when using matching set?
---
People are cheating, but it doesn't mean the only anticheat system is the report system. If you check some hackers forum, some people made a post about how and what Bethesda is checking, and how it detects ban. Thing is, once you kbow how to avoid this detection, you're good to upload your hacks.
---
Tried to help some newbies yesterday, had a few LVL 1-5 legendaries dropped from the Xmas scorch that I would've scriped anyway to give out.
---
Dunno whether it was my attire looking rather intimidating or my lvl (247) but they kept running away from me lol, i was even emoting the pressie emote.
---
In the end I had to just put them in the overseers stash in flatwoods and the overseer camp and hope one would notice
---
I shouldn’t jump through hoops for a video game they developed half assed to get it to work, their job not mine.... any purchase done is contributing the top CEO’a while developers get over worked for chump change... the industry is greedy on the inside beyond believe man what are the developers going to do but milk is? this company is not fucking good to it’s consumer base I seen so many complains but I played I stayed at the first act of wrong to me I said ok, second time too much man... I’m not spending money on assholes who don’t care about their base
---
That's simply not true. they have made tons of quality of life and performance updates based off of customer feedback. yes they break  thing's in an update but they fix things as well. over all I have experienced far fewer bugs than these forums and you tube would have people believe exist.  do they exist. hell yes. not nearly as bad as people make out though. 
---
   In a nutshell I will keep supporting them, I am happy with the product they sell me over all. If you do not wish to support them by all means stop giving them money and stop playing. I wish you luck in your next game o7.
---
Even if it was so, I would still buy it.
---
Not to sound hostile and I know this isn't the point here, but can people please stop casually throwing out MMO for just any old multiplayer game? 76 isn't an MMO, it's an online survival game. Like Minecraft, Conan Exiles, ARK, 7 Days to Die, etc. It's much closer to those than say, WoW or FFXIV.
---
Well the objective is to live not kill people killing is just a part of trying to acheive that
---
The Christmas outfits were in the store last year and will probably be back next week. Get a grip on yourself
---
if you wear a fasnacht winter man mask and a pirate outfit while standing in the vault 94, odds of rare plans will drastically increase
---
.48% chance from small and large wrapping paper and .57% from medium. So, best chance is Medium
---
yeah Lean manufacturing processes suck, but. there are no alternatives on the market I am interested in. and if you want to put marketing dynamics into the equation lean manufacturing principles have basically forced all companies who want to survive to utilize the same strategy. give me a better alternative I will try it out. other wise beth made a good sell to me and I am happy with it over all.
---
Sure but many of those challenges are one time, so you can't complete them again. A player at your level, you'll be lucky to consistently earn 400 Atoms per week going forward, and that's by logging on every day, every week and grinding out ALL your dailies AND weeklies.
---
I just did grow some pride and walk away, I don’t know why you want sand kicked in your face I sure don’t I’m hoping others don’t like sandwiches either
---
.24% small, .35% medium, .48% large, on the gifts
---
Don't complain when technical problems aren't fixed then, since you're willing to drop money on a broken game. So why would Bethesda fix anything (serious question)?
---
I would have to imagine it can drop from any of them.  Highest chance is going to be the large gifts though since they sometimes give 2 plans per gift.   I'm having the same issue and I'm thinking at least half of the people who were saying they got them within the first few hours of the event going live are just full of shit and trolling.  I have so many duplicate mounts, santa crashes and rare armor mods but not a single plasma plan yet. Luckily this even runs for a while.
---
Awesome. Thanks mate! I'm gunna invest a bit in those then &amp; see what happens.
---
Yea I'm swimming in Plans right now, especially cat &amp; dog heads. 😖
---
And another thing, unless some white hats (lel) manage to push their hacks to console, Bethesda will not move faster for a better way to deal with cheats. Pc community is just a part of the whole 76 player base. On console, without any third party, you can already noclip and dupe items, I do a lot of the first for exploration, so I know what I'm talking about, but I'm not tempted to start duping shit. Until it become very popular on all three platforms, they're not gonna fix it fast.
---
This game cannot be defended, when you launch a bundle deal falsely advertised that is a sign of the many things too come... they shitted on our heads at launch and haven’t stopped bringing in the elephant dump loads now
---
500+
---
Are you sneaking and getting the 2x damage bonus?  Any perks like adrenaline increasing damage while you aren't in the pipboy looking at it?  All in all its not a very bad problem to have if you aren'tdoing less than what it says in the pipboy.
---
Carry a light melee weapon. And leave the big fellas alone
---
No. An offline fully single player mode would be boring AF after the main story, and is not what this game was designed to be.
---
If you buy this one you're not innocent anymore
---
hum... if you happen to find a bloody hunting rifle with some extra, remember to sell it to your new best pal, zanardi (pc)
---
I'm close, 920 last time I checked. Once I hit 1000.... I'm going to keep getting more LOL.
---
They're not trolling. I only play on weekends, so Saturday morning I run big Bend Tunnel. Came out the other side with 4 gifts, large, medium and two small. I opened the large and got Mothman. I opened the next two small ones and got the plasma grenades and tomahawk plans. I did use the mothman plan, but I've saved the other two. It's a crapshoot. Now all I want is the snallygaster and the combat dense plan (tried farming for them Sunday but no luck).
---
I had never realized pepper Mills gave screws.  TIL, cool!
---
Can’t see this at all bro, won’t load
---
I’m at about 410 with my Deep Pocket set and Forest Op Suit and Strong Back and Str15.
---
That... that's not how pvp fucking works...
---
If you don't turn pacifist off and tag someone back to initiate a duel the most they can fucking do with their ten star weapon is make some nice fireworks around you.
---
Do you even play this game or did you just wander in to shit on it because lolfallout76
---
sure I can defend it . its very easy, 
---
1. its got radioactive zombies.
---
2. its got a pretty flexible building system that allows you to make bases like this https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb
---
3. the maps are amazing to explore
---
4. the enviromental story telling is pretty darn unique among all of the current games on the market. not for everyone perhaps but at least worth a look and a play through. 
---
5. queen fights are still pretty fun for me, I am level 370 something I have killed the queen hundreds...thousands? of times. something about the whole server merging at once for that battle just still makes me smile. 
---
6. power armor is a favorite thing in all of gaming.
---
7. Laser Gatlings are a favorite thing in all of gaming. 
---
8. servers are stable for me and most people I know on PC
---
9. servers seem pretty active when I play on PC
---
10. I like a lot of the stuff they sell on the ATOM shop. I dont mind paying them for their efforts. 
---
11. I have over 1500 hours and still cannot wait to log in when I get home. if you have a role and imagination the world and universe is pretty damn amazing. 
---
See easily just defended the whole game.
---
Minor fixes and fixes on a game that shouldn’t have released like that isn’t fixing anything... Your not listening to me man I didn’t tell you to stop playing I said stop paying for in game purchases that don’t help anyone else in game or yourself...
---
I dont know if you're kidding, but in case of not, it's the most rare and desired plan.
---
Here, have my mom, she cooks nice.
---
The drop rates are set.  Level, luck, etc dont matter: https://reddit.app.link/njdD9qwTs2
---
Did you miss this?  https://i.imgur.com/ZV8qn52.png
---
Hackers basically have "dev mode" on the servers now and can spawn in anything they want into the game. Like 10 star legendaries.
---
Can we please have a beta that isn't the live version now?
---
What about those players who just want a fresh toon specifically for NW? Seems kinda a bum deal for those players to have to run all the way there.  
---
Maybe having the option to build a character in vault 51 instead of 76 would be an easy fix.
---
This no longer seems to be the case. The same goes for Radaway: diluted plans etc.
---
fact - they write and own the lore if they want to include purple dinosaurs. they could. 
---
fact - they fixed a ton of stuff  [https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en) 
---
fact -all online game experiences are subject to change
---
see those \^ are facts, your saying the word facts but mostly offering opinions instead of facts.
---
Just go near the vault and you should see a objective telling you to listen to vault 94 emergency brodcast
---
Not many people do it because it is too difficult or they don't have a team.
---
You don't have to complete the main story, you just have to be very well equipped, have a good team and know how to work under pressure.  It took me everything I got to obtain the Strangler Heart Power Armour which is a reward from the raid
---
Facts hurt you bethesda I know but it’s fact you released a unfinished game and cannot ever justify that... it’s a fact you advertised this as a working online game but it isn’t... it’s a fact they didn’t say my experience would change for worse actually it’s a fact they said it would be better... bethesda you have no facts only lies and schemes manipulation tactics and that’s it bethesda no talent anymore... wastelanders will double down on how incompetent you have become bethesda
---
Genius.  I wish I thought of that
---
I'm level 19 and bought the caravan trader armor for 900 atoms in the atomic shop, just by doing the challenges. I wonder what I will be able to get when I get level 100+ like some people lol
---
My guess is that Fallout 76 will follow in Anthems footsteps. They’ll abandon any future content and have to reboot the game. If they don’t then we’ll be seeing a dead game within 2 years of being released. All these bugs and cheaters ruin the gaming experience
---
Instigating beats some of those any day of the week. Bloodied is King when paired with unyielding armor.
---
Just over 500 by bloodied unyielding combat armor with deep pocketed mod and max base strength with strong back perk card with other weight reduction perks.
---
Toys. Wavy Willards is a good example.
---
But what do you do after you collect all the loot there? I mean it doesn't respawn until tomorrow right?
---
Wrong. Get a trustworthy friend. Team up and server jump together. Only one of you pick up the spawns. Jump server. Same person picks up loot. Every so often, scrap and divide the scrap between you and your friend.
---
Rinse and repeat until you dream about toys with screws at night.
---
Notes: This does not work on a private server, and if your trustworthy friend accidentally picks something up, it wont spawn again for him.
---
Never seen anybody comment this before, how original of you
---
MMO = Massively Multiplayer Online Game. Fallout 76 is like most survival games an MMO by definition. WOW, Final Fantasy and so on are MMORPGs.
---
That is simply swapping the memory address of a spawned asset for that of another that exists within the game files. 
---
There are also planets, the Prydwen and a load of fallout 4 assets within the game files.
---
Ayy! Glad you managed to find it! :D
---
And I do. This game engine has never had to implement a anti cheat system before and I do not know how much of a hassle it is to implement, what I do think they should be stepping up in is bans for video evidence. I mean it is literally proof, then let them trace the account and do system bans so they can’t make other accounts.
---
Shit, I'm already on the cart.
---
Every1 can have their own definition of what something means i wanted clarification
---
There’s a great trading reddit for 76 so you really do not have to depend on drops- If that we’re true many people would be screwed - for example I’ve only ever gotten one good real drop and I’ve been consistently playing since beta. But I trade and buy and sell. Also if you have a good group of friends they can help you- I know my group goes out of their way to help each other find the pieces they want or need. You just need to find a good community to hang with and help each other instead of trying to pretend this is another offline fallout
---
I'm missing a fair few, haven't spotted the mirelurk king or queen claw yet. Haven't seen anyone with the Mirelurk queen claw either :o
---
Nice work on the fireplace.. looks more like a lodge I stayed in in New Zealand than a pub though :)
---
If it's so easy to mod and hack do you think a community made offline hack is possible?
---
Thanks, Pete.
---
Yeah, but certain of those plans only drop after hitting certain levels.
---
Being a low level removes them from the loot list, so the other items should have a slightly higher chance to drop.
---
On PC by chance?  If so and I get another I will trade for it once the event ends if we are still in the same boat.
---
Red trunk at Toxic Larry's "usually" has two maps! Plus, three Snallygastors for some quick Acid.
---
An icon for 200 atoms ;p
---
Yes and you think it isn't possible to modify memory files coinciding with a weapon... Lol
---
Not to mention completely ignoring the hundreds of people reporting these items being given away by free characters during free weekend.
---
Also TSE break down at a +50% of the rate. So it breaks down very fast.
---
No that would not be possible using memory edit, that would require editing the esm directly and Bethesda has patched sideloading modified esm. 
---
They are limited to spawning in anything that could potentially exist within the confines of the game itself.
---
[removed]
---
The minus sign doesn't mean your stats are negative, the brackets show whether your stats are being boosted (+) or nerfed (-).
---
Let's be honest. It is already dead. Like 95% of the people left the game. Even hardcore Fallout YouTubers like Oxhorn stopped playing and talking about it because there is just nothing to say about this game. I am sad. I love Fallout games, I love the lore but playing Fallout 76 is more of a punishment than joy.
---
So completely ignoring the videos of people with these hacked items and all the people reporting it in this sub and fo76 filthy casuals.
---
Killing a scorchbeast gives you 50 xp
---
3 kills gives you 60
---
Kills are way too low
---
😮 3 at once! I've never seen this!
---
Still playing here on PS4, it’s bustlin’. Honestly a lot of people that play that mode don’t visit this sub. I know a lot of folks who enjoy both ADV and NW. I notice a lot of folks in here who don’t like the mode quite frankly really just suck at it.
---
Or private server Charleston Capitol Building, Whitesprings &amp; West Tek! Created new character Friday and he’s level 90 as of last night! Thanks for the tip I’ll try the workshops next double xp weekend if I create a new character :)
---
I am pretty sure the devs do not have the funds for a good anti cheat. You have to keep in mind how insanly expensive modern anti cheat solutions really are
---
This is complete bs, 40 hours of ingame playtime and it’s not even guaranteed to get 1 gift???
---
Uh, I messed that up...
---
You're right, it is (-14).
---
I would agree with a server rollback or a mass wipe but first let them implement some more lore and story, NPC or whatever. At the moment, this game is more a Scavenger 76 than Fallout 76. You run around, kill something, collect trash and build your small house. That's all. A cheap survival game. Even Conan Exiles or ARK have more lore and more content to do and those games were created by small AA companies on the Unreal Engine with content bought from the Unreal marketplace.

### [Escape from Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/)
---
You can change your appearance anytime, why would you need a new char?
---
So it's a glitch you reckon?
---
I have not seen any videos of items that cannot possibly exist within the confines of the game.
---
If you have any videos please provide them as so far you have nothing to back up your statements.
---
Who was the one person who didn’t get it out of there inventory?
---
Enjoy it a lot because order of thr tadpole is really hard because i have to revive a downed ally despite usually playing alone.
---
&gt;As for the story, they could just start in a settlement
---
It's massively not this simple. The whole main quest is started *in* the vault, and involves you doing things *because it's your overseer*. Explaining all that away for someone who was never in the vault is going to be hard.
---
Thank you! Should be enough time for me to prepare and make a run for it. Do you know by any chance if I'm required to have each of the silo codes beforehand? Because according to nukacrypt I have all the right numerical codes but one, which my friend has.
---
What is this post? What am I missing?
---
And just as meaningless.
---
The day S&amp;P start rating video games companies is the day AAA means something.
---
In most battle royales yes in this 1 u can win with no kills
---
In your case? Yeah, you should be displaying (-) 14 Luck, not (-13).
---
My calculations were just to show how it's roughly worked out.
---
All you need is the nuclear keycard. Slot it into the receptacle and input the correspondent keycode from Nukacrypt.
---
The numerical codes aren't really used anymore by most the player base because of the team at Nukacrypt doing the legwork and providing the silo keycodes in plaintext.
---
*Photoshops Karen hair*
---
Deathclaw: *Loud Roar* (I demand to speak to the manager! This machine will not accept my hard bargain perk!)
---
Those plans arnt dropping from this event. Theres a master list of datamined plans and rewards if you search this sub
---
I don’t know how you came to the conclusion that 76 had no lore or story. You must’ve been actively avoiding looking for it because there is a LOT of lore in this game, very well written lore as well.
---
Is it me or are there less holiday scorched compared to first couple days
---
Wait, the (-) only means your stat is less than it is in your Perk Sheet.
---
So you're only 2 Luck down, even though your Stats say you should have 14 luck.
---
The (+) on your other stats means they're higher than on your Perk Sheet.
---
Lol, I got 800 lbs from a junk mule, then after we went back he was doing the purveyor dupe, so we took all that shit too.
---
I'll check but as far as I know they aren't in the shop anymore
---
Also 4* weapons include prime or scorch killer so lets say a 3* prime the fixer would be wiped, that is a problem....
---
I dont mind it cause on my third small gift after eating salt twice i got the PLASMA grenade plans !!
---
Yeah. Nice holotapes and so on. But okay. Some people enjoy this and I wont blame them for this.
---
They're doing it to sabotage the game.
---
Ah that makes a lot of sense. Thanks man, this helped a lot. :)
---
One last question while I've got you here if it's alright, how does the cool down for activating a nuke work? Is it player specific?
---
OP said they would "start at a settlement" instead.
---
No.
---
Haven't you seen the news?! Stuff like that wiill encourage younger people to start smoking!!!
---
Cue the sarcastic music.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
It would be cool to sit at my camp and smoke a cigar while crafting ammo.
---
The tips I would give are to offer a wide variety of items, offer something from as many categories as possible when you look at your camp icon. Try to give all types of players a reason to visit. Always keep several weapons and armor as they will draw customers slightly more than other items. If you can make a consumable that will sell, do it. Keep them coming back for more Grape Mentats (Intentionally bad example, find your own niche) and they will potentially buy other things. Repeat customers are valuable. When you price, don't try to price at a "fair value". Think about what you would be willing to pay for a similar item in someone else's vendor, then price it slightly lower than that. A cap in hand is better than two taking up space in your stash. If it hasn't sold after a few days of gaming, consider lowering your price. A cap in hand is worth more than twenty taking up space in your stash. :)
---
Were you running with someone / getting carried? I missed out on a carry group because I didn't check the forums first.  
---
I did Whitesprings for 44-45 because I wanted to hit 45 quickly before Watchmen last night.
---
The thing about hacking is, they can make the impossible..... possible. You must have missed the screenshot of a 10 star handmade the other day. Scroll the sub a little bit and you'll see it happens.
---
Hahahah I guessed that much
---
Hecking 35 now. It's fricking crap.
---
With meth and shit in game already, why not?
---
Id love for it to be at least an alternative method of starting nuclear winter. Would make it more immersive. Honestly its how i think how the game.should work regardless instead of going into menu as soon as you hit "play"
---
My character I switched to heavy guns was also bloodied. Many people seem to play it happily. It's a very powerful build, no doubt. It was my personal frustration that ended it for me, I just want having much fun with it  anymore. 
---
My new character which is level 15 now is another strength based one but focusing on shotguns. I have a VE  pump action which I will transfer over fom my other toon. I also have a BE pump gun as well in case I decide to try that route. BE, nerd rage, etc for Mac damage and VE for survivability. I look forward to hitting a high enough level to use them. Good luck to you.
---
Get melee attacked while reviving some one does this every time since launch
---
It looks so nice and cozy! You did a beautiful job!
---
It's TRUE! I played fallout 76 for an hour and now I only eat canned dog food and 25 year old hotdogs I find in the street.
---
Massively multiplayer. MASSIVELY. Fallout is 24 players per server. WoW is \~1,500 players per server. EVE is \~64,000 players per server at peak, etc. Do you see how 24 is not a massive number? 
---
Look at it the other way: Battlefield 2 server allowed 32 players per server. And 24 &lt; 32. Have you ever heard anyone refer to Battlefield 2 as an MMO? No? Quelle surprise! Similarly, Battlefield 3 allowed 128 players per server. Ever hear anyone call Battlefield 3 an MMO? So what on god's green earth makes you think FO76 is an MMO with 24 players?!
---
Finally, "like most survival games"? What do survival games have to do with MMOs?! Are you saying WoW is a survival game? No, it's no an MMO by definition.
---
You people make my head hurt. Fallout 76 is not an MMO. Stop throwing the abbreviation MMO around if you don't know what that means. BETHESDA, the developer/publisher of Fallout 76, doesn't call FO76 an MMO. Go look at the game page, does it say "massively multiplayer" anywhere? No. That's another clue for you that it's no t an MMO.
---
They dont drop from the event.

*cries in bloody build*
---
I haven't been playing in a while....what is going on??
---
🤣
---
Yes I was teamed up with myself on my other PS4 May I add lol until level 15 I have a lvl 15 QE shotgun then at 25 I put on excavator PA and I have a bunch of weapons at level 30, 35, 40 ect I would use that helps like mutant slayers swing speed and ghoul slayers weapons that help out a lot during that process. I used nukes and dragons to plan out the build carefully so I would have as little points wasted as possible and it helped out a lot when selecting special points :)
---
Seems my Santatron likes me about the same as the Purveyor, I have yet to receive a single Gift box, and I've had it running for at least 40 hours.
---
cool camp.  idea—instead of pictures, put up weapon mounts... and then use protest sign weapons as decorations, it’ll be a union bar :)
---
about 570 with bloodied unyielding, max strength, high cap backpack, deep pocketed and very low health and a carryweight food
---
I didn't have any power armor but could have. But I did send myself handmade and lever gun plans, and I did have an Instigating handmade at 35 that really sped it up.
---
Player cooldown, I believe, is 1 nuke per silo per 2 hours. If you wanted, you could launch 3 nukes on one server. Once that 2 hour period is up, you could server hop and go launch 3 more.
---
Silo cooldown is 3 hours for all players from the time a nuke was last launched.
---
Personally for the main effect I go for Instigating, Anti Armor and Two Shot. In that order.
---
 As a secondary I go for explosive or +10% damage while aiming.
---
 I am a full health, non auto, sneaky rifleman. I can also switch over to a pipe rifle build which I normally keep my pipe rifle build active.
---
 Junkies, Furious and bloodied weapons are good first effects.
---
 Faster fire rate and swing speed are desirable secondary effects.
---
 It all depends on the build.
---
The low fps and graphics are barely noticeable since you never really spend much time outside of the perk card screen on console.
---
That’s awesome! Congrats on the success I love double XP weekends. I created a bloodied heavy gunner power armor build and it’s really fun. Nice to change things up sometimes I was getting sick of the same thing lol
---
Just sittin back at my camp doing some Jet.
---
RDR2
---
You can also use the State Holotape you get from Modus to check if the silos have been run on your server - if you don't have yours anymore you can get a new one from the military wing. Good luck out there.
---
I’m sure it will come back one day, just like every other items. It’s not a skin though, you can’t apply it to your legendary heads. You have to learn the normal head plan then you craft this sheep skin head from scratch.
---
This happened to me before as well.
---
Yeah last weekend I just grinded challenges for the first time and got over 1000 atoms from things I never thought of doing. Never thought about it
---
Overkill much.
---
How can a Game be enjoyable with such a weapon ?
---
I have a legal 50 Cal with 30% extra Damage to scorched. on PS4, at first it was fun killing Scorched Beasts in under 30 seconds,and Legendary Beasts in under a minute.The novelty soon wears off insta-killing everything that moves.Yesterday i decimated 9 high level Super Mutants near the Pumpkin House,5 of them were carrying [Mini-Guns.Games](https://Mini-Guns.Games) becomes so easy it kills the enjoyment.
---
Might try testing it on another server and see if it does the same and maybe send in a ticket so that they're aware this is happening.
---
Unfortunately the Strangler PA has been a problem from the start. I was the first person to earn it and tried to do a queen wearing it, and the server basically nuked itself. The visual effect that is gives when applying poison damage is most likely the culprit, and Beth still has yet to fix it. Mine is just stuck sitting in my stash, gathering dust while I hope they fix it.
---
NPCs were always smoking in FO4
---
You can technically win any battle royale with no kills, so this argument is stupid.
---
The whole point is to be the last survivor, and being the last survivor means that everyone else must die. Killing is literally the focal point of the mode.
---
I have already addressed that, its a fake. You dont have to beleive me. Message  Eckserah, one of the dataminers who found that 76 stored passwords in a vunerable manner as he has already confirmed it to be fake.
---
I thought they dropped from the queen herself
---
You've answered all my questions I needed, thank you so much man, I appreciate it so much!
---
Honorable mentions:
---
Morgantown and Gauley Mine: good spots, too low level, but if you are new and want some plans, you know where to go.
---
Berkley Springs: Good level, but if you are on public servers it is most likely cleared out because it is close to Murmrgh. 
---
Wavy Willard's Waterpark: Good spot, but WAAAY to out of the way.
---
Harper's Ferry: Great spot, but has a chance to spawn Super Mutants instead and they are more annoying.
---
Watoga Municipal Center: Good spot, but is a bit weird with the floor plan
---
Tyler County Fair Grounds and Point Pleasant: Good spot but like wavy willard's, way of the way for major stuff.
---
Camden Park: Good spot but like TCFG and PP to out of the way,( when I say out of the way, I mean where most high levels hangout, Whitesprings and generally the eastern side of the map).
---
Pleasant Valley Ski resort: Good spot but it spawns super mutants or Mole miners or Scorched.
---
Camp Venture: mediocre spot and the ghouls can be annoying
---
Mosstown: Great spot! but has a chance to spawn Ghouls instead.
---
I'll continue to add as time goes on.
---
That is pretty cool bwhaaaaaa :-)
---
If you're on PC, the latest version of SFE (3rd party script extension mod) implements a fix for the strangler heart poison.
---
A few guys I run with, including myself, would crash when strangler was utilized on high HP enemies; we no longer due thanks to this.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/287
---
I have yet to have any issues from Bethesda regarding it, and I've been using SFE + perk loadout manager since December 2018. (So, a full year now)
---
Sounds good, thanks for the tip :)
---
I just want to point out Easy Anti-Cheat which is commonly used is so freaking stupid it blocks me from playing my games because of Aura Sync for my rgb controls.
---
Love how you get downvoted, these ppl better be ready for ready player one where the only way to get off the first planet that's you cant do anything on is with money. Only problem ready player one will be more fair cause you'll still have to play $60+ for the real game.
---
Yes these cheats ruin the end game experience.  Imagine showing up to whatever the next Scorch Beast Queen equivalent is and someone with a 10-star bloody rifle comes along and one shots it.
---
You lose the the challenge of striving to beat something difficult.
---
You lose the XP and loot by not getting  enough damage in yourself.
---
Further this type of cheating ruins the game economy.  Caps have lost all value, duping is to the point that even the 'God-Role' items are losing any type of trade value.
---
Learning mods is determined by a preset number of units you need to scrap, no amount of INT would help. But putting on Science Master does reduce the material requirements when crafting, since rad rifle is considered an Energy weapon.
---
&gt; Earnable Atoms dry up quickly
---
Which is why I only have 12,000 of them.
---
("Quickly" means about 7,000 -- the rest I had to make a little effort to get).
---
Thank you! You're welcome to drop by for an Old Possum or two lol
---
That's really great! Love the fire place idea, I was thinking of ways to use the campfire until I saw the recent ATX of one that's hopefully coming soon. Now just to make room in my place
---
The campfire would look pretty good too in the same place
---
I wanted to put up various displays but I ran out of camp space lol
---
You need one more addiction. 5 addiction is a 50% damage boost. TS is only a 25% damage boost and less accurate. Make sure you don’t have any diseases. If your actual perception is 14 and you have addictions that make you loose 2 perception, your stats will display (-)12 meaning you have 12 perception
---
Weeeell I wanted to keep a slightly unique style lol. Anyway it looks more at home in appalacia with sort of log cabin look
---
I think people are assuming that removing the prime receivers (the only levels items on the loot list) through a low level character will increase the odds of getting other drops. I don’t know if the drop chances were pulled from the esm or calculated by whoever put together the spreadsheet but it does feel like opening gifts yields more non prime plans with a lower level from the handful of times I tried this...
---

Wish I had that luck!! I’m looking for the Santa crash!!
---
Did you explain to him as of why communism will never work. And as to why the communist manifesto is wrong in stating the socialism will overtake capitalism in the near or further future?
---
That's something new - so you say that it's not percentage odds determine if I'll learn the mods? So I can make certain amount of weapon and learning mods will be guaranteed? I really like some link to some kind of proof for that.
---
Especially I have strange problem with Buttressed mod for Raider Torso - I scraped hundreds of them and I'm sure I have that mods learned, but suddenly, when I wanted to mod my friend's chest it wasn't available. Since then I scrapped at least 100 chests (both crafted and found in the wild) and still that mod looks unavailable in crafting bench. I've checked and this mod is nowhere near as rare as Radium rifle ones, so something is wrong...
---
Yea it would probably, but while trying to figure out how to place it I came across [this](https://i.imgur.com/johPjwx.jpg). My [bar/restaraunt was going for a different feel](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e9v0ou/finally_finished_my_bar_vaultdwellers/), but I really appreciate the having all the usual CAMP stuff put away. My chem station, stove and brewing stuff is all that's downstairs in the bar, everything else is  tucked away upstairs for visiting Vaultdwellers
---
Yeah I was just wondering if anybody had one going at that moment, just wanted to snag a few more levels on my alt before the double exp ended
---
Dang. That’s a ton
---
Looks cool! Definitely more open-plan american style bar than mine, I like it
---
Oh wow really? I assumed it was a skin! Makes it a little less desirable... thank you!
---
not sure why this is tho...I have tons of those...they drop like water off the mutants.
---
How?
---
Prime auto railway doesn't exist.
---
This is my perk setup
---
https://i.imgur.com/02fMcVw.jpg
---
Noted on how to read the (-).
---
Am tossing between formula P and pyscho. Posts here suggest P but I dont wanna lose the 2 luck ... Thoughts?
---
we use heroin most of the time 
---
we just call them stimpaks
---
😂😂😂
---
Any time! Yes a few later ‘skins’ work the same way (an alien probe comes to the mind), it’s very odd indeed.
---
Well you need to plans to be able to complete one of the Opossum challenges.
---
Ah...I see. Thx
---
I have also been investing heavily (approx. 90K) in Wrapping Paper, 170 large, 60 medium, 40 small, 
---
What I have learned so far, is that mediums reward the same plans as large, but the latter often rewards 2 plans each, also that the large gifts have a chance to award Scrip, which I have gotten \~ 1400 of so far, and substantial amounts of Caps, 3 out of 12 gave me 1000 caps this morning.
---
I have moved more caps this morning &amp; plan to spend another 30K this evening, I'm just happy to have something decent to spend caps on.
---
What’s the particular reason you don’t want the -2 luck? If it’s because your crit meter fills faster with higher luck you should be fine with the -2 luck.
---
Plus make sure you’ve equipped a legendary (must be 2 star) drill
---
The community spends more time theoretically fixing the game than Bethesda.
---
If he wants a bloodied one I have one for sale..
---
Installed this and it worked, but do the people around me crash even though I'm not?
---
It is soo funny to me how many games KEEP making this mistake. How can they not expect this to happen? They must be brain dead or just can't be bothered to implement it correctly from the start.
---
Server authoratitive archetecture is a multiplayer 101 topic. GTA V on pc made the same mistake.
---
It must be done this way to save time and costs.
---
Mins one strength for psycho vs minus 2 luck for P. Plus the reason you mentioned; VATs related
---
The question is -  how many people would continuie to play to replace thier current great gear?  This would requires massive new content drops - probably even more than wastelanders can deliver .    For long time players such as myself ,  further grinding without  more content is  simply not somthing i want .   I agree there has to be some solution to recent exploits and just not sure this is it.
---
When I first started out I diddnt realise everything was level based so I headed completely away from the tutorial to the waterpark and realised I couldn’t loot or kill anything because of my level and a higher level guy basically escorted me to safety gave me a modded vault suit and a 10mm and sent me on my way
---
I wonder if this is what we'll get as far as companions that are limited. Like the vendor/merchants we could have in FO4 where we'd assign an NPC to a vending station. NPC's that can vend, farm, scavenge, etc. I'd be fine with this, especially if they have great one liners like the usual Fallout NPC's and the vendor bots and santatrons in Fo76
---
Thanks! Definitely a visual difference between a pub and a bar!
---
The devs may not but Bethesda sure does.
---
What platform and for how much?
---
nope...I cant stand leveling my alt...been there done that.  As far as economy...They just had the Xmas event were many people spent thousands on getting paper to make gifts.  Now you'll start to see people wanting caps much more.
---
The game isn't dead just because YouTube moved on. Not to mention those people will be back for round two once wastelanders releases.
---
If your a vats crit luck based build then do the psycho addiction.
---
It looks awesome!
---
I didn't see mine either
---
Yes, but will it blend?
---
I know there is at least one marked location you can build at, Wilson Brothers Repair, so maybe it could be both- marked and buildable. I wish more places were, especially areas like Morgantown with lots of great pre-existing structures. Just let me build a penthouse dammit!
---
It absolutely is an mmorpg, but with many hybrid elements. Saying this game isn't one is to ignore what an mmorpg historically is.
---
I ended up with three snallygaster plans, and a combat dense in 6 gifts.  It’s total rng, I had to trade some common ones for the opossum and antlers.  I am still needing the mirelurk claw and sloth ones.  Nothing too rare, just never got them.  I traded the duplicates though.
---
It only affects the person using it.
---
Yes, there is a prime receiver but its not automatic
---
Make it a part of legendary characters.
---
Hit L50, restart, now you can loot L55 gear. Hit L55, restart, get access to L60 gear. Hit 60, restart, get access to L65 gear... And so on and so forth.
---
Then add something like another special point with each reboot or something.
---
Suddenly there is crazy incentive to grind.
---
Look in the atom shop. That's where mine showed it was unlocked.
---
which is awesome and sad at the same time
---
Dupers will still find a way to dupe
---
They are the same weapon, but the Bolt action pistol takes pistol perks and the rifle takes rifle perks. You can switch between them by changing the stock of the gun
---
Can confirm. Started Friday the 13th. Was by the Responders church when random high level came in. I tried to hide. He puts a brown paper bag on the ground. Gave me a long range rifle with scope. Took me by complete surprise.
---
Not sure of the answer but you could test it very easily. Just take a pipe rifle and start equipping perks and see if you get the damage bonus from both. Even 1 +10% perk should be enough to see it change on the displayed value.
---
I got my first plasma grenade in my 2nd large present I found. And then 2 more from crafted large presents. Just keep grinding. 2 more weeks of this madness will make sure everyone gets every plan they want. If it doesn't drop for you, it will be available from player vendors after the event is over for probably quite reasonable prices. 
---
I'm level 275 and like to hunt plans. I've gotten 42 new plans so far. I was hoping to make some caps off the extras, but I have a feeling the bottom on  the market on these plans just dropped.
---
Weirdly enough, it took some time but I found the Twitch sleeping bags in my atom shop. They were already owned. I haven’t been able to find a few of the other things, though. I’m sure they’ll pop up.
---
Critical hits cause target to frenzy what....the.....fuck? 
---
10 star lol
---
Yes I saw Oxhorn's video.   During the video he's reading the terminals while the timer is running out and listening to the holotapes while trying to avoid being shot lol.
---
Log out of your Bethesda account and log back in. That's when my stuff showed up.
---
All of your points do not disqualify this game as an mmorpg.
---
Oh ok, good to know thanks.
---
Do you really think the people who got the absolute best gear don't want anything better? Imagine if WoW launched with the best gear available until TBC. Don't you want more of the enemies to get stronger and in turn drop better loot? To me farming and trading for an identical piece of gear that has a better 3* effect is way less exciting than getting completely better gear and fighting completely better enemies.
---
To bad it can't be sold in vendors, because I highly doubt people would drop it
---
You took a risk and it didn't work out. It would be really cool if servers always worked like they're supposed to, but they don't. That uncertainty introduces risk into your transfer system. Change your transfer method instead of trying to get Bethesda to give you back your lost stuff. If you really want to be sure, transfer directly to another person.
---
I would not be buying any of those 5 or 10 star weapons or armor they might get wiped clean
---
Why is addictol so hard to find
---
As a father who plays F76 with his 11-year old, this post made my day.
---
Is it only PC with the 5 star dupes?  Haven’t seen it on PS4 and played a lot over the weekend
---
Lets hope but I am not that optimistic. Depends on how good Wastelanders will be.
---
I have no idea who you are and no pre-conceived notions.  Frankly I generally read post titles and content without ever bothering to associate a User ID.
---
That said, I read your entire post twice.  What I got out of it was:  **I posted on the internet and people were mean to me.**
---
If you put a rifle stock on it, it benefits from both Gunslinger and Rifleman.
---
It happened to me a while back and I ended up getting frustrated and going and making some food, when I came back the map was on my screen asking me where I wanted to respawn.
---
me too, i mod them up to be as powerful at low levels as can be, but many noobs run from you.  i even had one mic up and say no fight, no fight.  i mic'd up and said no man Merry Christmas and enjoy.  i give a gun ammo, stims and rad away, and of course a piece of candy!
---
They haven't fixed that bug yet?
---
Good for you my friend:)
---
If it's an item that shouldn't exist, then it's too bad IMHO.  I.e. a 5* item, just sucks to be you, but it's not a legal item.
---
If it's an item that could drop potentially, and you only have one, then they could just identify all of them out there, and perhaps give an option to players who have it possibly through legitimate means, even if it is an illegitimate item.  If I received a message saying, "hey, cool item, I'm sure you love it, but... we think it may be created improperly.  But we now it probably wasn't your intent. So what we'd like to do is offer you two options: We have an adjusted version of that weapon that is less powerful, and you can keep it, or you can trade us for it and we'll give you 2 special 3* gift boxes that are designed to not drop junk legendaries—but what you get is still randomized, somewhat."
---
I think a significant amount of people will take the gift boxes.
---
The key here is about choice and agency.  If you manage something like this you cannot do anything by fiat and force.  Just taking it away will piss people off (force).  But pointing out they are holding an illegal item, and it'll be patched, OR they can choose to get a random drop – I expect most will take the latter.
---
Except it is 
---
"massively multiplayer online role-playing game: any story-driven online video game in which a player, taking on the persona of a character in a virtual or fantasy world, interacts with a large number of other players"
---
76 is absolutely that. The whole mmorpg idea springs from a time where people were connecting to virtual worlds and interacting with far fewer people at a time than what we see in 76. Fallout 76 is absolutely a massive multiplayer online role playing game.
---
haha
---
hahaha
---
hahahahahaha
---
You jest.
---
I regularly buy 1 star weapons and armor to use for scrip.  1 star weapons - 100-150 caps.  1 star armor- 50-100 caps. 
---
Double it for 2 stars
---
Well I was gone for like 6 months and I thought even Bethesda could fix it in that account of time, but I guess I need to lower my expectations even more xD
---
I think by buy he meant buy with atoms which you can earn through playing the game.
---
I did junkies for a few weeks. Just isn’t for me. I do just fine with my vanguard guy without the negative effects. Just wasn’t seeing the damage increase and wasn’t worth it in the long run.
---
People want better gear - as can be seen with the grind for stangler PA  and fixers.  However people do not want to replace their whole collection that they spend months to build .  
---
4/5 would be very rare and therefore a supplement to current gear -  currently 2 stars still has good values even when 3 stars exist.   Rasing level on the other hand , would make many feel they needed to replace thier whole collection.
---
I dont know the net. effect of  your solution  - will it make players grind more or will it make players quit.  i just know i wouldnt like it .
---
I got a be 25 less vats 50cal from the imposter a few days ago
---
Cheat programs dont work on console.
---
Toys work well. If you go to the fairgrounds in the northwest park of the forest, you can usually get 4-5 toy cars or trucks. Plus a lot of scorched for the current event!
---
Yep, thats kinda what im looking for
---
X-bone? LMAO, it's still nice to see a PLAYSTATION player "Like" Xbox, but have we for got about the forth wheel of this game coming soon...? NINTENDO SWITCH, they will most likely hold a free Weekend for their arrival and do you know how easy it is to hack or corrupt a Nintendo device? TOO EASY! so when Wastelanders comes out this issue will only spread.
---
Yes. I will also help any newbies if i can
---
That is what i meant
---
They really should, there are way too many players who are actively supporting this shit.
---
I've played long enough to know that if  someone has a God tier weapon, then it is  a duped item.  No, they didn't dupe it themselves, but they bought it from someone that they know is a duper. Someone who has  bought a duped weapon is  not "innocent." No, they shouldn't be banned, but they are in possession of gear that should not even exist and is breaking the game's economy and balance.  But no one who has a duped weapon is 'innocent.'  So all duped items need to be wiped, if that is possible.
---
I knew you meant that, no sane person would actually spend money on atoms.
---
Go to prime fissure areas and then glassed cavern.  
---
Quite honestly I’m sitting on almost 1000 scrip so my mode this weekend was selling crap to fund present purchases at the train stations.  Landed every single rare critter mount (some multiples) plus a great number of weapon mods, crash Santa, icicle lights, etc.
---
People are already spending up to $200 per 5 star weapon, it's crazy..
---
Unless they are really well scripted I think they would just make the world feel even more dead than it already does. 
---
A robot though, we all expect them to act dumb.
---
Delete it and use Armoury Crate from ASUS instead
---
good ideas, but currently the the weapons/ armor are more than enough to blow through everything.  So, they would also need much greater challenges.
---
An AAE Lever Action Rifle.
---
The cheating/hacking is getting out of hand. However, Bethesda will most likely have to make the game suscription in order to pay for the Ant Cheat System. At the point they just don't have the funds nor the man power to sink in to such an system. (or if they do, thay don't want to)
---
Yeah it’s not a perfect system. Hopefully this can be changed so we can do the lore ourselves.
---
I read it here actually and looked this up too but couldn’t find a definitive number for either units or chance (which should be boosted by Luck instead of INT right?). On a grand scale they are essentially the same indicator though. If a mod’s drop chance is 10%, and the weapon has total 10 mods, you end up scrapping approx 100 to unlock them all. I like to use the unit indicator since it gives me an idea of the resources I might need to gather.
---
Perhaps, but with the prices the bots are asking for some of the plans, undercutting the bots can still make you a fair number of caps.
---
Variety is the key.  Especially ammo.  Don’t be the tool that puts up 9000 .38 ammo and nothing else.  Offer up .45 and .308 and .556 and .50 and 5mm and fusion cores.  And serums.  And flux.  And food!   All that shit sells and sells well assuming you price it right.
---
Guys, this is the kind of stuff that happened in Diablo 1.
---
Diablo
---
ONE
---
The first one, that was released in 1998. Blizzard didn't bother adding anything to prevent hacking in Diablo 1 because they didn't even think about it. 
---
THIS is the level of incompetence we are seeing. This is "babies first online game". Using the base for your game being an extremely old engine that everyone has been using for years and years to make mods... may not have been the best choice for an online game.
---
&gt;Do you really think the people who got the absolute best gear don't want anything better?
---
Not if the odds of finding something better are as minuscule as they currently are.

Going back to the beginning of the game, I've never been able to tell if someone with God tier gear is someone who has played a while lot, or someone that got it back in January from dupes. Everything in this game has been cheapened a bit by that and everything up to this point as well. If this game goes on for years do you think 50 should stay the nax level this whole time? If it doesn't go up for Wastelanders, what about the next major content update? Or the one after that? 
---
I understand what you're saying, but in an ongoing game we should never become too attached to our gear. I'd probably keep my level 50 until I find level 100 gear with at least the same primary and secondary effect. The synergy with my build is too good to warrant it under that because of how damage reduction is calculated. The only thing I'd be changing in relatively short order would be my weapon, because of how damage is fundamentally different from damage reduction in how the meta works.

Buy Fallout 1st and there is your SP mode

I think even a little more than 600 will be, in the company of mutants, of course
---
The only thing I know that consistently gives that is guided meditation.
---
I love nw, but... why do people join a team, then spawn in on the other side of the map.  then work towards the team, and expect to be revived if hurt.  if you need help, they run as fast as the controller will let them.  is there a single player mode for them?  i am only level 39, but have revived many teammates, only to be abandoned immedately after.  wheres the teamwork?
---
I did what I call "Giving gifts to all" I picked a server and just went around to low levels and gave them a weapon and a note, plan, something that I think they will be able to use. I helped some out and gained new associates in the process.... I enjoy helping low levels, we all were low at one point and needed help, so I like to give back.
---
Good morning Todd, did you had your coffee yet?
---
Agreed, that's why I don't think 4 and 5 star weapons should drop from normal mobs. They have all of these high level dungeon raids incoming, they should have mobs up to level 100 with 4 and 5 star bosses that can drop legendary gear.
---
My camp is just below vault 76 and is easy to find. I like it when new players discover my old timey themed saloon and they find the punch bowl on the bar. I keep it stocked with vintage nuka shine all the time.
---
Slap on Woodchucker Perk Card (Luck), spawn in at Helvtia. The first yellow house on your right, there's a log shed out back. Sorted.
---
AAE Minigun +1 Perc from Super Mutant Warlord
---
I think past level 50 some weapons really shouldn't be in the loot table. Have high level dungeons with level 100 mobs and higher level 4 and 5 star weapons unique to that dungeon from a shorter loot list of items like the fixer or the Sheepsquatch gear.
---
That way looking for a BiS piece gives you an idea of which dungeon to grind for the weapon/mats to craft it.
---
&gt;Think about what you would be willing to pay for a similar item in someone else's vendor, then price it slightly lower than that. A cap in hand is better than two taking up space in your stash. If it hasn't sold after a few days of gaming, consider lowering your price.
---
Your pricing advice is golden.  I tend to price the more basic plans for between 5 and 50 caps. I have found that 10% of their stated value or less is good for moving them. I see them priced at full value in some player's vending machines, and I can't help but wonder how long that ivory grip plan has been sitting for 150 caps when they have 10 of them. Meanwhile, I price them at 5 caps, and they actually sell. With my 10% strategy, it's not uncommon for someone to show up and buy 10 or more plans, netting me a few hundred caps. Between that, the occasional legendary that sells, and selling to the robot vendors, I sit at 25k caps consistently. And I do spend plenty as well.
---
I just bought a year of Fallout 1st for this, totally worth it.
---
B/SS sledgehammer
---
Instigating Explosive hunting rifle.  It was level 1....that stinks.
---
I did get a zealots, +40 power attack, +1 STR meat hook though this morning. I'm going to smack the queen with it next time I see her.
---
It’s all a bunch of crap Plans, so don’t bother yourself.
---
Logged out, logged in then checked Atom Shop, That seemed to work, Thanks.
---
The problem is that you keep playing the game, just quit.
---
This suggestion doesn't work without also raising the overall difficulty of the game by several notches.
---
I think a better strategy would be removal of the offending weapons and actual enforcement of the TOS.  These people need to be banned.
---
Except all servers have only 25 players.. it's not a "massive multiplayer", nor does it have a true rpg mechanic.
---
Yea I was thinking the same. I've got probably 10 over every common plan or more So I'm guessing everyone else has about the same so they won't be worth much until months from now.
---
I really talented intern would do it for coffee and doughnuts.
---
The freezing has been really bad for me too on PS4. 50% of the time, if I inspect an item, my game freezes and I'm forced to close the application. Happened over a half dozen times this weekend. This didn't use to happen to me prior to the last update.
---
No its not its to survive and i guess i shouldve said its way easier in this game to do cuz u get attacked by mobs
---
 Bless up ❤️
---
2* Bloodied FFR railway rifle from a glowing one at Mosstown.
---
Platform?
---
Are we getting more stuff? It shows on the twitch prime website two more coming soon things. Is that the case?
---
And thank goodness for that. At least on PS4 there's a refuge from the worst of the cheaters. It's still a serious issue that needs to be dealt with, but I'm glad that two of the three communities are unimpacted by these cheating scumbags.
---
That’s a shitload of caps for sure 
---
I crafted about 50 split between large and medium.  Got just about everything I wanted.  Have another 10 sitting in my stash. 
---
4 Plasma grenade plans, every rare critter mount (in some cases 3-4 of each), 3 crash Santa’s, 6 icicle light plans, and countless weapon mods or plans including a prime auto handmade - which interesting dropped on my very first present I opened. 
---
You randomly get 500 cap rewards on some.  I would say for every 6-7 I opened I got a 5 hundy. 
---
Sold a crapload of stuff obviously to fund my purchases.
---
Not a bad idea, I already paid for Fallout 1st but wouldn't mind paying for a battle pass too, the more support they get more content will be released in the game.
---
Omg really 😂
---
Especially cause lately it seems like I have to press every button twice to make something happen
---
The effect of all Special boosts maxes out at 30 effective points to any special stat, a few other things can add to it as well;
---
* Base Carry Capacity = 155
---
* 30 Strength Special Point = 150
---
* 5 Armor Pieces &amp; 1 Weapon with +1 STR = 30
---
* Deep pockets on 4 Armor Limbs = 40
---
* Pocketed Raider Chest = 15
---
* High Capacity backpack = 120
---
* Total Carry Capacity = 510
---
There are Foods, Chems, Drinks, Bobbleheads &amp; Magazines that can add to this as well, but as you know, those are temporary.
---
* Ribeye +20
---
* Bufftats +15
---
* Radant lager +50
---
* STR Bobble +5
---
* Grognak #9, or Scouts #3, +15
---
So... It is possible to achieve a total carry capacity of 615, temporarily.
---
An inside job?
---
This may explain why not much is done about it and what is done, is late and *lack lustre*.
---
Kill the Christmas scorched, man. These guys aren't very prevalent. I've yet to encounter any outside of NW.
---
Thank you for this I never knew it! I have my CAMP in whitesprings so I will visit there often
---
Well duh, but killing is literally the only way to survive without getting lucky. The literal whole point is to kill.
---
A battle royale is defined as a fight in which more than two combatants are engaged. (Merriam Webster)
---
Notice how it says that its a fight? Notice how it says combatants? The whole point is to fight and kill
---
Here is permanent glow effect:

---
Look me up man a lot of my stuff is for sale in my vendor
---
While obviously we all want the devs to take care of this problem, let's not absolve the people who are creating the problem in the first place just because steps haven't been taken to prevent them from doing so *yet.*
---
Also I will try to hop on at other times if someone requests it.
---
Yes, thank you.
---
Yeah, was quite surprised how much caps and scrip I got from the large gifts actually.
---
Eh, let them downvote. They have their opinions, too. I probably shouldn't have been like, "your the problem", so that was ffs of a dick move on my part.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Its easy to implement. Theres legendary module. Just use that to add on effects. Bethesda, are u listening?
---
Bloodied FSS Grognak’s axe a couple weeks ago. I still grin when I see it.
---
Just play Adventure mode and avoid NW like the scorch plague.
---
There are some buildable areas in Flatwood
---
Premaban the mac address of anyone using cheats, exploits, or duping. Track item id, and delete ALL copies, as when you play an online game like this, everything generates unique ids. If cheating got your system totally blocked, and all the duped shit got deleted, it would likely make it much less likely for any repeat offenses.
---
Is there a way for me a end user(player) to know what items are dupped. Asking because when trading 100k guns, i would not like to get banned because of it.
---
Hey man an ie lvl 1 gun is pretty sweet. I'd love to get my hands on one for leveling a new toon
---
Yeah
---
Go to the Charleston fire department read The garahan mining company poster on the wall then do the mission it gives you
---
Shoot me a pm.  I have a 2 star anti armor handmade that I will let you have for scrip.   
---
I can mod it for you as well.
---
&gt; Fallout 76 shares a lot more in common with Action RPGs like the Diablo franchise and Path of Exile than what many people here may realize. 
---
Thank you, been saying exactly that from day 1.
---
You can change your Mac address, and it isn't even that hard. They need to block all hackers and then implement a hacking defense service like most online games
---
I’ve seen one occasionally at the NAR Repair Yard. Like maybe 1/10 times. I just don’t have it in me to kill them either.
---
Good idea, good job :)! Merry xmas!
---
Depends on how you are defining it.
---
Highest you can carry and still fast travel, highest you can carry and still run (using AP), or highest you can carry before having to put on PA....
---
No idea what my base carry weight/fast travel cutoff.  
---
15 Str + marsupial, + packrat, bandolier, bear arms, thru hiker.
---
WR armor (1 each for ammo, junk, aid, weapons) - at least 1 piece is +1 STR, all of which is modded for deep pockets, plus the standard backpack.
---
no food/chems -  I can go to around 1300 and still run (using AP).  Much over that, gotta go to PA.
---
You have a stats that affect your character. You have perk cards that essentially fill the role of skills, you have leveling mechanics and earn xp for quests and killing monsters, you have a storyline that you progress through. It absolutely is an RPG.
---
As far as the server goes you don't play with many more players at a time in almost any MMORPG, you are still cut into instances or zones where the overall playerbase is chopped up into smaller numbers. There is nothing different here, we just call instances of the world servers.
---
No its not most of my wins when i solo come from not killing and i suck at that mode i assume the points u get are so low becuz they dont want people solely killing for points i dont like using dictionary definations of things cuz they dont always fit video games for differing reasons balancing throws alotta of them into question
---
What a poor excuse of drops. For Christmas???
---
I disagree, they have been releasing free patches and content all year long, also wastelanders expansion coming up soon with massive changes also for free. Fallout 1st is a nice way to show them support and you don't even have to buy it to enjoy the game.
---
Along with the stuff already mentioned, check workbenches - lots of those have a box of gears, screws, or springs nearby.
---
It's not as simple to change mac address on consoles, and since that's 2/3 of the playerbase, it would leave a big impression. As for the rest, I agree they really need to find a way to deal with it. Personally, I think it would help if they hired some moderators for this game  to keep an eye on players.
---
Yup. There are 100x as many explosive laser weapons being used than naturally dropped. Not much outrage over this obviously duped garbage littering Appalachia.
---
Yeah it's been a bit of a struggle to get them to actually pick items up and I can't ever get them to trade with me to give it that way. But it makes me happy when they finally figure it out haha. I figured the gift emote would be obvious but I guess not lol
---
Sounds like you got really lucky my man!
---
Bro, im not sure you even understand what a battle royale is at this point.
---
The definition is correct, as the entire point of the battle royale is to fight and kill and win. Just because you dont want to kill doesnt mean it isnt the focal point of the entire mode.
---
I’m amazed that people still play this game.
---
Has a chance of 3 not often 50 or so jumps only had 3 spawn 2 times.
---
Vampire .50 cal. is my wandering gun.  Takes five or more high level enemies to overcome health restoration and you can defeat any one or two large enemies easily.  I can take out a SB, Mirelurk Queen or Sentry Bot without putting on my power armor.  Radiation is the only real damage you will take.
---
Bloodied build, deep pockets on all Unyielding armor pieces, STR at 30. With high capacity backpack, 490
---
I've found it easier to not defend the settlements because of wonky mob spawning, especially when it's 4 waves of something. Just leave and let the mobs take over, then recapture it.
---
OK, but can we at least agree that their itemization, how they approach end game balance, and the end game content, needs some serious rethinking?
---
I had this happen, but if I fast traveled to the same location I was already at the mobs "unstuck" 9 out of 10 times.
---
Isn't that every quest in the game.
---
Looks amazing!!!
---
But will they invest those into the smallest player pool in the game. Doubtful.
---
I wouldn't trust Beth to even remotely be able to accomplish anything like this.
---
I also had 5 pop up at the same time after freezing up then rejoining the server, so had to go and get them with a "reclaim".  
---
Another benefit of 1st... when the game freezes you don't lose your workshops.
---
Yeah, that my be the case. But really we need some anticheat over in adventure mode as well, that need is just less obvious.
---
yes
---
Man... I’ve been on the fence about 76. Never played it before it seems good I know there’s a lot of hate but I’m allowed to form my own opinion on something and so far this game has given me nothing but kick back. I go to buy it and boom big thread on dupes. I wait a few months and go to buy it and boom cheaters with all sorts of glitches and weapons I wait again and see oh it’s also pay to play pretty much and now I’m so far away from the fence I can’t see it. 
---
The game looks good and I’m sure it’s immersive like FO4 but the bad press is too much for me. to not even believe some of it would be true would be ignorant and now I feel pushed away without even trying it 
---
Get it together Bethesda as quickly as you guys gain 1 fan you lose about 15 in the process maybe the RPG MP fad is dying out and this is just proof
---
Ate up all my Grape Mentats opening Holiday Gifts.
---
Just adding this, if you're trying to get the grenade/mine plans buy up a bunch of low grade paper with a character under lvl 5-10 and have them open the presents. After blowing more caps than I want to admit on large gifts to open with my main character trying for a plan I was looking for, I got a plasma grenade on the first small gift i opened on an alt I was trying to level and couldn't believe it. Then I saw there are lvl requirements for plans to drop. Should wildly increase your odds. Good luck grinding!
---
Would the brahmin work?
---
I'm not sure if the double XP event is over already, but running events is probably the easiest.
---
There's cranberry relish(?) for an XP buff and being well rested, certain perks in groups can boost XP gain further.
---
Otherwise, it's just grinding out higher level enemies.
---
Now that scorch beasts are legendary, fissure site hopping can nab good XP from the beasts and the scorched.
---
Double bonus being that the scorched have a chance to spawn as a "holiday" scorched bearing a legendary item and a gift due the Christmas event running until Dec 31st.
---
Or you can just server hop west-tek.
---
Haha maybe, not sure PETA would approve
---
Hard nope here!
---
Same as reforge in Diablo 3 - you reroll the affix until you have the desired one. Here it must be more expensive, since affixes have static amount of bonus they give (i.e. always 40% SS, while in D3 it was range most of the time -10-25%).
---
I'm going to aim at doing all this, thanks very much for the advice, have saved this for later 👍😉
---
I agree, but there's no way for them to know, unless they're dumb enough to have stacks of them in their inventory.
---
XD I started in June with the same idea, until at level 30~ I was doing Charleston DMV and some level 100+ made ghouls respawn x_X
---
Some just seem worse and more onerous that others. Likely I'm not playing organised enough and get caught out.
---
Depending on how hard u want the high star stuff to be to get it might not even matter to a large portion of the player base i do think the level cap idea wouldnt be a bad idea
---
Yes, duplicated items were a thing before player vending came out, IIRC. Bethesda removed all but one of the duped items from inventories, which was pretty generous, to be honest.
---
Would love a cultist version or a glowy ultracite version
---
You can speedhack by manipulating the fps and they left a dev room in the game.  Does not matter what anti cheat betheada uses because they are fucking morons anyways.
---
For sure, the vault raids aren't that great tbh, did them once and never bothered ever again. Nuclear Winter is also questionable as most people don't play Fallout for battle royales and pvp, I would rather have another mode instead. I'm not sure how many devs they have working on FO76 stuff but probably not that many since Fallout 5 and TES 6 are in development.
---
it is just  the normal grgnaks axe
---
Why do you need to grind exp for the Wastelander launch? Are you below lvl 50? 
---
My route for exp is Whitespring, the hole area, go into the Bunker for technical data. Jump to West Tek, kill'em all inside, outside, backside. Jump to BOS fort and turn in tech data, kill scorched, jump to Red Rocket just up north. Now, either you go back to Huntersville and blast them, or you do Harpers Ferry plus the sewer full of ghouls. I usually return to WS and sometimes jump to Camden Park for my daily tokens and exp. If you want you could hit Lewis-town too, or the Tunnel going to Crabberry Bog for some gifts. Belching Betty netted me 5 gifts plus low lvl scrip last night, if you like chasing gifts. 
---
Glassed cavern is also pretty good. You're looking for high density spawn sites with max lvl enemies.
---
This is the right answer
---
I bought the sequin dress last year and have only crafted it once in game(the day I bought it). When I logged into nw on the 1st day of dbl xp my sequin dress was still named as such but was a completely different style and color. Second day of nw the name of the dress had changed to gala dress and was still gold. I dont know if there is a different way to get the gala dress now but this was my experience.
---
usually if any of the gear exists at lvl 15 or 5 or 25, it goes by 10 and Max will be 45. if there is a lvl 20 or 30 or 10 of something, it's max level will be 50. I could be dumb but that's how I keep up with it
---
[Bloodied Lever Action](https://external-preview.redd.it/T_od2R_8D1YIFU5zXgbK1A3MzfFWzTDqJ0Sx_NdaEr4.jpg?width=1024&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c62e24bbfba638904377a4dbe192bca493b7e9) from farming White Springs, last week before the Scorched Santa event happened. Don't run bloodied so it went the way of the FO76 little piggy...
---
Two perks that are almost mandatory for a bloodied build.
---
Bethesda does not care about fixing anything as long as a large part of the playerbase thinks they are amazing and throws $100 a year at them. Crying will do nothing, money talks, and you made you money talk in favor of Bethesda.
---
We need a mic emoji, something that says, "Hey, turn on your area chat, let's talk."
---
Smokin’s bad... mmmkay
---
Yes. This. When WoW added them in Wrath of the Lich king they were a game changer
---
As to your first paragraph, lots of games have those features and are not RPGs. Minus a storyline, CoD and Battlefield have all the rest of those things. So they're RPGs now?
---
No, most MMOs you don't play with more than a few dozen players in a given instance. But, there are those instances, such as Raids, where you will be grouped with a massive (hence the name) number of people. In 76 there are zero instances that go above 24 players at a time.
---
No worries... probably find a better guide but few more notes...
---
First... leather is one of the easier ones to learn as the materials for crafting and the  level at which you can craft ( level 1 light leather ) make it easy to whip up a bunch to scrap.
---
always make the lowest level of the lightest variety (marine and trapper only come in one weight class)
---
Second...
---
Check an arm, a leg and the torso to make sure you have learnt everything. Note that you should get to max in each except torso... torso will be 1 below max... this is because the dense mod for torso can only be attained as a plan. Phoenix and the bot in the old fairground sell these but they are a rare spawn in their inventory...
---
Had 80000+ caps between 3 characters last Thursday. As of this morning; 4200.
---
Ive realise something over these last few patches, content being pushed back, lack of any info on upcomimg content.
---
Minimal semi-viable product.
---
The pizza is coming butters.
---
Finally got home and tested it. And hot damn your right. Had to get rid of good doggy to free up a point for int. Running r2 demo n r4 gunsmith now. Try to find that good middle ground lol
---
My vending is almost dead as well.
---
I can only assume theres a balancing reason but maybe they do it to increase the grind for levels seems to be beths go to thing now if they increased it though i have a feeling itd be more like pubg where u could fire a shot in the air and mobs would coming running like they could smell blood whereas now would u wanna do that for 20xp is it worth potential death
---
Yep same boat. I feel so broke
---
Pc
---
I already gifted it to some lucky random newbie.  Hopefully they realize what the hell I gave them and don't scrip it or worse, sell it to a robot vendor for 10 caps lol. Considered making an alt and transferring it over but too lazy.  
---
Running through Morgantown during this event, I'm sure I will end up with more decent low level drops before it's over.
---
Is it really cheating I'm a single player game?
---
PC I'm afraid
---
Go find another player, mutual benefit
---
I usually say gift then shoot the bag 😂😂😂 gets the message across mostly. Love that feeling of YESSSSS YOU FIGURED IT OUT haha 😂😂
---
Damn. Is Bethesda ever going to give us cross platform play?
---
Works in red dead
---
Yes. 45 is also Max level though.
---
I'd quite like to do a raider-themed bar at some point, maybe with my next character
---
You may be dumb, but you are correct.
---
It's 30 most the time on pro, and if you've got good gear, sure, you are getting more than 30 steady, but most PC players prob get under 60.
---
I'm sure. I got a lvl 1 JE pipe pistol that's not to bad
---
I can't wait for crossplay so I can wreck noobs like you, you misread the wiki page and are flapping your arms lol
---
I didn't realize it only counted as one, you sure? If that's the case god knows how I managed to complete that one!
---
What platfor are you on?
---
Yep!  I have a rifle/sniper build with an instigating explosive crit hunting rifle modded all out, and no bloody anything.  It's my thumper, and I /hate/ the slow reload, but without any other effects besides perk cards and the weapons, I can drop 2200-2500 or so damage in a single hit.
---
I was talking with somebody who was super happy about their min-maxed bloodied build, all the armor, weapons, etc finally aligned.  They were happy they could one-shot one-hit things in the same range.  I was like, uhh, okay....  I can do that too :)
---
What's massive about it's online numbers? A server can hold 24 players. Private servers can hold significantly less. CoD can hold a similar number. Battlefield can hold more. So CoD and Battlefield are MMOs now?
---
And where's the RPG? You don't interact with anyone, except robots and other players and 99 times out of 100 with other players, it's just a quick emote and then they leave. You don't have dialogue to build a persona. You don't have meaningful choices to build your character. There's perks and a fantasy world, which lots of games have and they're not RPGs.
---
Xbox
---
Wow. Level 212 and missed the excavator quest lol. Impressive. There are signs to read to start quest down in the ash heap.
---
Spent around over 200k on gift paper had to sell some good unused weapons for that much
---
Thankfully on Sunday I didn’t see any hackers. Guess they where only around Saturday. 
---
Was able to get the glowing Skelton outfit in time to.
---
what do you all spend it all on ?
---
I'm hard pushed to spend 3k nevermind 30k
---
I doubt it 😔
---
Would love it, hook them to a terminal to simulate different creatures resistance, could be part of a quest to earn
---
Same, lol. Bethesda has fallen lower than EA
---
Those damn gift wrap papers lol. 1400c+ each.
---
Ok we'll see whose tankier when crossplay hits, anyone who thinks power armor is tankier is delusional
---
Bloodied swing speed reduced weight mole miner gauntlet. 
---
Or maybe the bloodied faster fire rate combat rifle.
---
I went from TSE to Furius +10% aim damage and am never going back.
---
Purveyor dupe?
---
Exactly, and if the game actually worked the way it was supposed to in the first place, fewer people might try to break it. As it stands the core game is so broken there's little incentive to actually play it by the rules. Especially when doing so can actually be a frustrating experience.
---
I had the Purveyor drop a BE15R Fixer for me the other week. 2,500 hours in the game and it's the one and only God tier weapon that I've ever found.
---
I knew the second I got it....... I've been seeing duped BE15R Fixers in nearly every traders inventory for weeks.
---
The Purveyor gave me a fucking dupe!!!......what a kick in the fucking nuts. 2,5000 hours of grinding and when I finally find something insanely bad ass...... hundreds of other players already have it.
---
Fuck dupers........and fuck people who trade for dupes and support the dupers.
---
I try not to admit it, but I used to play Runescape, and even that game had dummies for this purpose lol
---
Nice wording there but it’s out of context bud. My prior posts all reference Bethesda and FO, the last one indirectly leading me to come up with what I wrote. Didn’t say jack crack about grammar. I don’t complain or whine to people, I write out observations/thoughts and attempt to support them with facts or things I find to support it and describe examples. See the problem is that you don’t know who is writing this, my personality type, physical features and tendencies to act a certain way in a variety of situations. So why respond to an unknown writer among the millions of others? How many people actually identify themselves as “themselves” on here? Disclose their name, maybe occupation or other real life identifying factors beyond the letters here...Very few in fear of whatever people think will happen to their identifies. There is no consequence of lying in this format, and the growth of trust is unknown outside the scope of the “topic” “game” you engage with this stranger in. 
---
My point is that this discussion isn’t about anything relating to something we agree about, and my writings were just opinions. You could have said I disagree,  but you wanted to indicate whatever agitation this caused you and Jab a bit into me because you can and there aren’t repercussions. I just don’t find this beneficial in most respects to helping people develop friendship in the common sense, and that because we are stuck with visual words and nothing else to better understand eachother, misconceptions and incorrect understanding is happening between everyone communicating on here and they start that assumption bullshit...or sadly don’t care.
---
Yeah, I misread it. Lmao. Man, just let it go. You were wrong, talking out your ass, and now it's on public display. Take the L, my dude.
---
Strength.
---
Been in that spot myself for most of the year now. Can’t really find a reason to leave.
---
Depending on the type of weapons you carry, if you have the point, swap out something and add the bear arms perk.
---
I could say for instance my definition of p2w would b any advantage and some else would say thats just convience 2 different definitions but sure argue with me cuz i wanted to know what they were sayin
---
I hope there is a small Inn upstairs. Gonna need to sleep off that liquor. Don't want a drunk in public! 😂
---
Legendaries w/ poison resist is the only way I believe. I don't think med-x was ever confirmed to give poison resist, been looking into that option recently.
---
Just two pieces of poison resist gear will greatly reduce its affect.
---
Lucky indeed. For some reason I feel compelled to get all the cryptid ones. And at lvl 132, it's just sad not to have the combat dense mod yet. I'v got leather and metal, but dense eludes me.
---
Oh was wondering what u spent ur caps on wrapping paper got it. Why? Was there a greater chance to get better items? I farmed the fissure for high level scorched,  most of the time i would get 2 at one 4 at another and gifts ranged from large to medium. I spent a lot in fast travel but only bought one large gift wrap just to check out. It didnt yield me anything great so didnt waste my money on any more.
---
The wall candles are in the same selection bracket as the regular candles
---
Nice one, internet tough guy. You're embarrassed, but you'll live.
---
It's not even duping at this point. Hackers can just create whatever legendary they want from scratch. They can also spawn in items like plans and aid too.
---
It's funny how this post keeps popping up from time to time :-) Bet the next new thing is equipping Mr. Sandman before Covert Ops gives you 3,75x multiplier on sneak attacks @ night
---
Well there is my private suite but I suppose I could loan it out for a nominal fee 😆
---
Oxhorn has like an hour and a half video exploring the computers and holotapes just watch that
---
seconded
---
It saves them a lot of dev time and probably performance on the server by just trusting the client but it makes it really really hard to stop cheating.
---
Don't.  The game is basically an inventory simulator.  I spent ages constantly fighting min/maxing my inventory, and you're forced to build around having every encumbrance perk possible, leaving little room to even max out an actual spec.  Even when they doubled the inventory it didn't help.  The only way the game is even playable (and then you'll still have inventory problems) is with the unlimited junk stash, and that means you're forking over $120/yr to "enjoy" your time on it.  
---
I gave up after they lied for over a year that they couldn't increase inventory due to stability concerns to the game, and then came out with unlimited junk stash.  Turns out they were able to do this all the time but withheld it in order to monetize it as a "feature."  
---
The best part is the feature released and people's junk stashes were getting completely wiped out when they used it.  So the people who dumped money into FO1 got rewarded with losing all their junk components needed to build anything.
---
I’d like to know the lore but want nothing to do with battle royales or PvP so I’ll probably never actually see anything about it
---
Damn where is crossplay when you need it
---
I'll take it!
---
I wouldn't have a care in the world if everyone non PC with a duped BE15R Fixer lost them.
---
As long as when I check my inventory the BE15R Fixer that the Purveyor rewarded me is still there.
---
Nobody is going to trade you a BE15R Fixer.......unless they have 2 of them. If you trade for gear that is possibly duped you should risk losing it.
---
I’ve been farming and buying. Didn’t really have anything else to waste my caps on anyways. I’ve had 120k caps for almost a year and couldn’t spend them until now.
---
Perfect! Make a few extra caps for a nights stay 🤣
---
Lol I know sry happy holidays anyway
---
Farming on a private server isn’t making me any richer either!
---
So was it worth it? I've barely burned through one character worth of caps on presents (which I haven't even opened 10% of yet) so far since my wife didn't let me play much this weekend. :( Lol. 
---
I still have 110k in caps across my other characters and I'm trying to weigh the value of just buying the plans I want versus buying hundreds of presents and hoping to get what I want. I'm generally not a plan completionist but I always want the limited time ones.
---
Handmade gifts have better odds of plans than the regular gifts. The Christmas Plans like Crash Santa are doubled from buying the gift wrap.
---
47 minutes from this comment
---
True. I like the private servers but it’s hard to sell when you’re the only on in it lol
---
my first play through I made dumb decisions and was unhappy with how some stuff turned out but I didn't use any mods. once I got the game for myself, I did all the things I wanted with full AP reduction armor. I don't feel bad about it at all
---
This is easy, the last one you picked up is the one "not tagged with Supervisor quest icon" ^^ ^^
---
Seriously, i wish I could get rid of thoses...
---
I imagine, but then you have to wear power armor and lose a huge benefit of a Boodied build, Unyielding armor.
---
Use psycho for your 5th addiction. That's what I was running on my junkies rifle build. I think finding enough formula p to get addicted will be tough. Personally I'd swap out better crits for grim reapers sprint, up to you though. 
---
What weapon are you using?
---
How have you done the fire inset in to the wall like that 🤔🤔 place looks amazing what computer you play on
---
It's not that it's hard.  It's bad.  Blocking and parrying in a souls game feels good because the inputs are snappy and responsive.
---
FO's block inputs have hideous latency issues.  It's a poorly implemented, almost comically shallow gameplaysystem.
---
It felt dated and weak in 2008.  It's unforgivably garbage in 2019.
---
10mm smg too? Just asking building a black beard from r6 xD
---
18 to 20 Glass Caverns. Every time I picked up ultrasite a new hoard of scorched attacked. If my team mate picked up some nothing would happen, he was team leader.
---
What you're saying isnt true and you know it, non oa builds will always be tankier than pa builds. I'm not embarrassed because I know what I'm talking about. You think pa is tankier but you've never mentioned that sentinel kicks in too making you tankier, you're not tanky at all dude
---
Yeah I’m not a plan guy either. I try to sell all my known plans for 25c. I don’t really pay attention to what’s rare or not. I’ve definitely acquired a lot of unknowns at this point. I really don’t build either so I’m not sure why I keep buying these damn wrapping papers. Kinda just gave me something new to do I guess.
---
you're changing the argument now, again! Later loser!
---
Lmao that’s hilarious
---
Meh, I finally started playing FO76 after owning it for a year and I haven't met any hackers.
---
Just don't play their stupid af battle royale cash-in and you'll most likely not have any issues.
---
Got any data to back that up? Didn't think so. You've got nothing but hot air. By the way, look up appeal to popularity fallacy. Face it internet tough guy, you lost.
---
Sry to people who try but I won't be accepting friend requests or team invites as I don't want 100 more friends or to deal with someone trying to greif my base. Thanks for understanding and enjoy.
---
The game is fun and all, but the player vendors are what really makes it unique to all other FO games. I picked up a 3* max lvl Junkies railway with 90% reduced weight for 1k caps not too long ago.
---
I have bought a few papers because I was maxed out on caps like usual.  I'm not going to go crazy buying paper when there is so much time for the event to see what will just drop for me for free though. Once it's the last few days I may buy a bunch if there are still some plans I haven't gotten. 
---
You can do whatever you want with your caps, none of my business really.  Are trying to stockpile plans to sell later or something?  Why not just wait and see what drops naturally?   Just curious really.
---
Whats the secret for selling items? my prices are low but I can't get any customers...
---
Lol. That was pretty much where I was heading just because it's at least an original concept for this game. They obviously wanted to put a capsink in before wastelanders and everyone is taking the bait. Hopefully there isn't an even better one around the corner to make is regret it.
---
I'll still probably still clear at least one more character of caps once I have time to do so, but it will be tedious if I do more since all my other characters are low level with low charisma and without chemist so I need to transfer caps to main to buy and craft.
---
Changing the argument? All my posts are in black and white. What world do you live in? Do you speak english? Lmao. You're ridiculous.
---
Oops, sorry for my wording with "Supervisor", i am trying to translate my game from French to English :)
---
It's cute that you think it's a 'mistake'
---
Game devs/publishers know exactly what they're doing and the cost/benefit ratio to implementing more server-side sanity checks to just tossing shit on a P2P host and moving on to making the sequel to the game is very carefully considered before they move on to making the sequel to the game.
---
Why do you think they put in all those invincible enemies!?
---
Bethesda is way ahead of you.
---
Yeah I have no clue why I bought so much. Just figured my caps have been collecting dust for close to a year. I’ve already bought every plan from the vendors and sometimes bought duplicates just so I could keep playing. Figured this was a good way to offload all my caps.
---
Lmao, facts.
---
Where else can I farm legendaries to turn into script which I then turn into legendaries that then are turned into less script.  It's so much fun.  I just have a few more quests i want to see where the story goes and I'm done for another 6-9 months till wastelanders arrives.
---
I've chalked it up as having an obsession lol I just love playing. But if anything happened to my character, I'd probably just quit and wait awhile before I played it again.
---
Unpopular opinion: I like FO76 way more than FO4. I just like the roleplay element
---
Location helps. I price mine around 20c per scrip. So a 1* weapon is 100c and a 1* armor is 60c.
---
That’s an interesting take on it. They got me lol
---
How about taking the illegal items, revamping the effects to be positive for the target (gain health instead of losing health or something far more creative) but not changing the item description? Then the cheaters won’t know their illicit OP 5* is bunk until it’s too late.
---
well we all have theoretical degrees in ~~physics~~ game design
---
I’d go two different characters instead of a melee/heavy hybrid. If you want to maximize Heavy weapons I’d go vanguard heavy BOS combat armor, with ammo and weapon weight reduction. Also, always run one piece of chameleon armor because you never know when someone will initiate PVP. Here’s my current heavy/explosive Junkies build, currently running heavy studded leather armor 
---

---
Shhhh!. I've got a whole character built around that "bug" I like to see it as a "feature" haha
---
Oh thats cool hope u got some good stuff, u ever come across heavy combat unyielding sentinel legs let me know
---
Glassed Cavern. Ive seen hundreds. Over 100 small holiday gifts PER RUN.
---
Fun game.
---
Perk cards pack joke : 
---
There are three types of persons, some who are good at at math and some who are bad at math.
---
Lol I’ve been searching for those as well.
---
ty &lt;3
---
Maybe thats where i got it from but also got plasma gernade plan and honestly dont know what came from which..lol
---
My posts are a fair and nuanced look at power armor's pros and cons. The fact that you can't understand my position is a personal problem.
---
Water pump produces dirty water.
---
Don't worry, I play in spanish, I understand!
---
If I had to guess probably the tests near Vegas.
---
If you're trading high end 3* items you'll probably have a dupe passing through your hands at some point, just have to accept that. These new exploits on PC with obviously silly 5-10* items are the ones to stay away from.
---
You can double dip pistol/rifle perks. I’m currently running a JE pipe revolver and it gets bonuses from both pistols and rifles.
---
The community is very nice yes, but there are some high levels who believe they can boss others around and will jack up their vending machine prices way to high.
---
Can't play atm due to no PC, what is there to spend caps on?
---
Just as there is no cross play. There is also no transfer. That includes characters and Atom shop unlocks and atoms gained.
---
&gt;I wouldn't have a care in the world if everyone non PC with a duped BE15R Fixer lost them.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;As long as when I check my inventory the BE15R Fixer that the Purveyor rewarded me is still there.
---
Damn right! Finally! Someone who gets it! I have a bloodied explosive Gatling gun that I got from the purveyor.  It's the only real god tear weapon that I have gotten through grinding. And it took me 351 levels and more than a year.  The probability of these weapons  dropping is near zero. People like you and I know that this is objectively true.   They are impossible to get. And yet they are everywhere.  And like you I don't have any sympathy for someone who wakes up one day and finds their bloodied explosive weapon gone- IF IT WAS obtained from a trader who duped it.
---
That actually was only people that lost junk not all 1st Subscribers.
---
Me too, my alt is using a JE pipe revolver. I’m rocking that until I get to lvl 50 and I can transfer really good stuff over.
---
If they do a capsink I don't think it will be nearly as exciting as this one. Plus wastelanders could still be 3 months away so plenty of time to cap your caps again. One of the possible capsinks I am hoping for is something like the implants from New Vegas where we could install permanent improvements in our character at like 20k a pop .
---
It would be a one time thing. Once you complete the questline NW is always open.
---
They don't want to ban you at this point. They can't afford to let anyone leave because the player base is already dwindling.
---
Or while crafting chems... oh wait, fire and gunpowder/caustic chemicals don’t mix well...BOOM!
---
This scenario definitely can't be explained in 3 sentences adequately. There is too much extra stuff going on. I also try to explain some of the extra context because not everyone who watches a video like this follows the game super closely. 
---
But of course yea, it is super ideal to have 10 minute+ videos on YouTube these days. I don't really like that reality, but it is a reality. The ad rev part is one thing, but also a video promotion aspect from YouTube's algorithm (which is the big part). 
---
Sorry you felt like the video was excessive, I'll try to better optimize that for people who just want the point
---
Yeah I agree. There was just nothing else to spend caps on. Anyone selling anything good is already sitting at max caps so it’s hard to offload them. This will definitely change the value of our caps.
---
The idea and the experience, honestly.
---
I like the idea of an online Fallout game, and while the experience isn't perfect, it's still fun.
---
But think how fucking hilarious it would be to see an explosion at someone's camp while they're trying to craft 🤣
---
What about my perfect set of armor that I've spent the last 6 months looking for the final piece?
---
If Wastelanders adds a 4th star to legendary armor I'm out....... I've spent 2,500 hours looking for pieces to make this set of armor. No way do I start over with a a four star system. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice.....
---
I play on pc, and would say it’s not good on Nuclear Winter. Haven’t really heard much trouble from console players however.
---
Wastelanders is coming in the next couple of months.. not 6-9
---
Thanks for the protip
---
Wait, they added new music to the radio station?
---
I didn’t really enjoy the Halloween candy high school bit
---
Lucky Hole Mine. 
---
Still freaks me out with the lighting and the effigies.
---
I deleted it....
---
Admittedly I haven't knowingly run into any either but the whole drama surrounding the game and Bethesda's money grab attempts are leaving a sour taste in my mouth.
---
Yeah just done the cross bow, it's actually a really good weapon for stealth. Could of done with a quad legendary version though.
---
For me it's collecting neat things. I am currently building a legendary shovel collection and trying to learn all of the plans- I spend a lot of time hunting plans (the Christmas event is amazing for this) and spending time with my friends. We get lost for hours. We're always like "Okay, let's go do x" And then we get distracted and end up goofing around for hours. I also really like building camps and decorating too. I can't wait til Wastelanders comes out to see what it brings.
---
Definitely can get that.
---
They're sure as shit not getting money from me after FO76 unless Todd Howard gets shit-canned or retires.
---
If someone winds up gifting me their next game or something I'll play it sure but other than that I'll just rent it or play it on a friends account.
---
Thanks for the dense raider plan!
---
I have a "pristine" coffee cup and teddy bear if you would like to make an offer :)
---
There’s a collectors list in this sub somewhere, I’d suggest searching for it, as they had a ton of the clean items in the game, but I do not recall the toaster.
---
Internet tough guy? Ok, im not bragging, but before i stopped playing this game i was under the top of the best known pvpers on pc. 
---
I tested PA and Non-Pa so many hours. I tested everything. The only time PA was stronger than the rest was when survival server dmg was nerfed. Thats it. Play against a good pvper once and you will regret what you said on discord
---
On pc more than ever right now.consoles are pretty much free
---
Haha, thanks I’ve had those for awhile.
---
You got it happy holidays
---
Or just build some ultracite power armor till you spend 1000s of hours searching for armor that is rare to find.
---
Ehhhhhh that is the way to do it , but ALL ur stuff? That’s a big risk if you can’t get into that world or you get booted or anything else that could happen inbetween log ins. I would ask someone to be a go between if I was gonna trade everything in my stash.  Someone I really trusted . It’s just my opinion tho. Becareful out there.
---
Fair enough. I really regret preordering the version with the PA helmet now -.-
---
&gt;Believe it or not, it's very possible to get god roll weapons just by playing the game.
---
The likelihood is near zero. I know this to be a fact because I have been grinding the game and killing legendary enemies by the thousands for 351 levels for more than a year.   I have had only one bloodied explosive weapon drop during that entire time, and yet I see bloodied explosive weapons nearly everywhere. Every single person I know who has one of these weapons has bought it from a trader that they know was a duper.  They've  straight up told me that it was bought from someone they know is a duper.
---
It would totally be awesome. In FO3, the companion Jericho smoked cigarettes if you have them to him, and he had a nasty smokers cough too. I wish we could passively smoke in this game... Isn’t it rated “M” anyways?
---
Edit: You have ''your data''. Ok. In a bethesda game nothing ensures that ''your data'' is actually right.
---
I only do a few things at a time.  At most 10 - 15 items. 
---
If you want help, I'll gladly help you. I've lost stuff before and it's not fun.
---
Yeab it is bit god forbid someone get offended.
---
I’m familiar with those posts, have them saved and they’ve been very helpful. I’ve contributed to them in the past as well but nothing about the toaster other than that it exists. I may post in those places if no one can help in this recent thread.
---
Yeah, but I'm betting someone will know exactly which one.
---
Or maybe this will be ignored.  Hard to know.
---
Maybe, but it'll take 6 months to 12 years to debug it
---
One can be located in a wire trash bin at Nicholson's End in the Ash Heap. Another in Vault Tec University interior in kitchen sort of classroom, second floor.
---
Never get used to that place.
---
It's a joke. Since i guess most of us know how rare the red one is
---
I like playing Fallout with friends. I also really enjoy building towns and having people come by to actually see them and shop at my small little town. You couldn't do that in 4, there wasn't anyone to marvel at them. I also enjoy the legendary farming. Plus hunting down plans was fun. Trading is pretty much the only thing that saves this game currently, there's not another game that does it like this
---
I know many places where i can find a total of 100 piles or more,but they can only be picked once a day ,i think,so it's still a freacking long run.
---
Vault raids... will we crash... will we lag... will we DC?
---
I got one I could part with.
---
I intend to only keep my sledge and unyielding set on my main.
---
The idea is to do it in chunks though, so if shit hits the fan I won't lose everything. Mix legendaries, junk and ammo in each batch.
---
I know I don't need to transfer junk as I have the scrap box, but I want to empty everything to get a "fresh" feel to the char.
---
That is really nice! Can I come and visit? (If you’re on Xbox)
---
I’d seriously love to match and break them anytime I want.
---
There are conduits that go through the floor. In the video, I go on the roof of a build, which is actually flooring, and run it through the floor from above.
---
I've been doing this steady everyday for a couple weeks. Have had zero issues swapping stuff between 5 toons. Just make sure not to log into anything but "private world" when you switch toons. I've even blue screened (PS4) a few times and as long as you load right back up and go to private world everything should be there. I haven't lost a single thing.
---
Have you checked the random encounter spot between the national radio research centre &amp; Sunday brothers cabin? There’s a fair few there.
---
Can’t say I have but I’ll give it a go now, thanks for the lead!
---
I hope for a full respec option someday.
---
That’s a good idea. As far as I kno you can still do this since the new patch but I might test it a few times first just to make sure like u said.
---
Every enemy has different armour though. Like how you can kill a scorch in a few shots, but the same level super mutant will take more shots, so knowing your damage numbers won't really help unless you can build different dummies, like a scorch dummy, mole miner dummy etc
---
I wish I could ask the person in charge of hiring why all these community members aren't getting hired. The game might actually get fixed!
---
The prison is just a horrible maze.
---
Yeah, same.  But *at least* let us do it when moving a point.
---
Where can I pick up my degree, I want to show my mom so she is proud of me.
---
And you are ignoring facts and reality, you are being deliberately obtuse.q
---
You have failed to provide any proof to the contrary to what I have said.
---
Just because little Johnny says he saw a 10* legendary in-game, doesn't mean it is True. Little Johnny is lying.
---
Completely understandable and I don't blame you.  I still play Fallout 76 because I have made some friends and there's still some fun to be had, but Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 are not on my list of future must play games.
---
Ill have to check this place out.
---
That is very kind of you, but I'll try solo first. I know there is a risk involved, but hey, whatever makes it exciting, right?
---
I have my mule set up at purveyor so that I can transfer items there and then turn around and deposit any scrip. Bonus is that you can try and roll for low level WWR armor which will greatly help your mule carry more things. You can also roll for low level weapons.
---
Had quite frequent blues on the ps4 recently as well. Good to know that I don't need to panic if that happens. :)
---
Reporting anything to Bethesda is a waste of time.
---
I agree, ha.
---
The first time is always the most scary.
---
It would be nice if we could box up some of our crafted decorations and.give them away.
---
I hate getting stuck overencumbered in the south south of the map. Other than the nuclear disposal site  and a cabin ( I forget the names rn ) there’s nothing down there. It’s long treck back to a rail station if u don’t have a survival tent.
---
Toxic Valley because it's so barren and desolate.
---
Yea but that doesnt work for the people that want to explore and find the secrets themselves.
---
(I do love watching his videos tho)
---
Also, if you use the ice box at whitespring you can fit everything at once. I farm steal using it and dump hundreds of assault rifles in it at a time to scrap with guns n bullets 5 on.
---
A couple suggestions to your perks if I may. Use 3 points in tenderizer instead of hard bargain (and just flip hard bargain back on when selling/buying)
---
Instead of running with gunsmith, use 2 points of Luck if the draw in luck. I never, ever have to repair my weapons with that on. You may have to drop search genes and just flip that on when using rad away. 
---
Frees up 5 points in intelligence to max out splosions.
---
No worries, good luck 👍
---
My camp.
---
It looks like shit. I suck at building. I get annoyed and frustrated and then delete everything. At one point, I went "fuck it" and only had a small generator, a vendor, a workbench and a stash box standing on top of a defense platform in Berkeley.
---
Absolutely ridiculous xDDDD
---
We all wanted that since the pip boy got introduced. It has always been horrible. At least there are mods for PC in previous FOs but scrolling through inventory on console has always been painful.
---
I know there's already a lot of negativity so I'll keep it short. I wanted to love this game. I've been playing it since BETA, unstable servers, broken quests, none of that made me want to stop playing like cheaters. I have a hidden camp and when I do log in I spend my time avoiding others. I don't know if this is what Bethesda intended but they're the only ones who can clean this mess up. I hope they do but I'm tired of picking up tin cans and waiting for content that never comes.
---
See I dont mind the effigies I just hate going down there cause I get all turned around and lost EVERYTIME and have to fast travel out.
---
What happens?
---
You guys were getting sales?
---
Anywhere in the cranberry bog.  The topography makes farming in the games only real end game zone infuriating at times.
---
Prime plans usually go for 1k plus each.
---
I hate just any of the buildings/caves you go into that are very similar in layout and confusing to get out of. I hate being stuck in places where I can't find my way out.
---
The Power Plants.
---
Or you could just pay a courier to help you transfer things.
---
I did that event religiously for 2 weeks and never got it, but I've gotten 6 from gift boxes already.
---
Nothing you've said is even an attempt at refuting my argument. I'm not even sure why you bothered to type it up.
---
My posts are a fair analysis of the pros and cons of power armor based on information about how the game actually works. "LOL PowEr ArMoR bAd" isn't a sufficient response.
---
As I said earlier, it may not be better than Assassin's Sentinel, but it's damn good and absurdly less expensive.
---
Am I reading this right? You buy gift wrapping paper, craft gifts then open them to get stuff?
---
Ingredients? Like, stuff you planted or pre-existing? I like incorporating the environment into my camp.
---
I want to do so much, but the camp limit is stifling to say the least.
---
Anyway to make a video and post it on YouTube? I don't have the Lone Wonderer tag for nothing... I'm a bit of a loner. The only friend I've got on PS4 is my homie I served with... I'm sure you understand that my PS4 friends are those I know 😏
---
For those of us at work... what happens?
---
In that case I can’t help sorry. It is a good question though
---
I was hoping to not level the alt. WS requires some levels to survive in. :p
---
Yes. Buy the gift paper and use chemist to make extra. Open them up (under aid) and learn the plans or sell them.
---
You got ultracite mod plans? I finally made my first suit at lvl 95
---
No, I used to, but it was too time consuming, now I just keep a notebook with a page for each character to keep up with their basic status, &amp; Cap tally.
---
I'm on PC and even with the mouse wheel it's a pain in the ass, so I can't even begin to visualiza how bad is with a controller... They need to add this, it shouldn't be so difficult
---
Is that on trade subs or when wandering to vendors? Or both?  Thanks for the input.

I recently got suckered into building a Prime 50 cal MG. I never made ultracite ammo before but had plenty on hand, then I tried to make some. Dang: Stable Flux. So I began a headstrong quest to start creating my own stable flux... and yeah, there's the hole HRF saying, 'There's a sucker born every minute." Is the whole Prime thing a big practical joke?
---
BTW, I found someone selling Ultracite 50 ammo for 6c. So I bought 100...yanno, to increase my sense of stupidity. Heh. I can easily burn 1,000 rounds of 50 in a battle against a Legendary Scorch Beast... and even if Prime could help me down a SB in less...well, the math sucks. Bethesda's whole Prime thing is for Level 200+ players I think. Below that is a sick prank. Just thinking out loud here; sorry if I offend.

Id stick with PS4 for the bigger player base and no hackers.
---
Well now I can see it lol and there me thinking it was witch craft nice job 💪👍👌
---
I do sir
---
Tweet at Bethesda, maybe you'll get a answer. Might as well give it a try - they're as likely to know/answer as anyone here on reddit.
---
Never seen so many people happy about going broke 😂🤣
---
I sell them for 500 caps in my machine. Seems like a fair price.
---
You don't need to fight anything. The box is at the train station. I have 2 sub L5 toons stationed there all the time.
---
Both. If you want to sell them quickly 500-800 is a good range.
---
I love this style of event. There is no fear of missing out or having to check the clock constantly so that you don't miss it. It also allows so much more flexibility and exploring.
---
I'm around level 200 and I've gotten 3 Bloody explosive weapons, all natural from drops. I traded them away because I don't use the bloodied build and I have a friend that does. I sold one in my vendor for 5k awhile back since it was a pistol and my friend doesn't use them. 
---
Just because you haven't gotten a specific roll doesn't mean that others aren't getting that roll legitimately.  Yes there are tons of dupes, thousands, but you can't just assume every single weapon that is good is duped it's silly.
---
Planted, all you need for beer is corn and razorgrain. I haven't tried doing a video, may have to research it.

Level 20 hunting rifle

Thanks
---
This would make more sense than scorched imo. They retain more of their humanity and I can see some of them celebrating.
---
PC I'm afraid, but you'd be welcome to visit any time 🙂
---
Yeah It happened to me when the Holiday event started. After reviving a teammate she became my "companion" and I could issue commands to her lol. Safe to say she is a better teammate than companion. One of the guys in the party uploaded my picture here on reddit.
---
But you are on pc so that makes me a little bit sad
---
It's a problem on all platforms, but on PC is completely rampant.
---
Wow that view! Where is this? 
---
Wish this was on PS4 so I could visit.
---
Are we even certain it was an atomic test they used?
---
Toxic Valley, because it's such a huge waste. Looks cool, (fantastic when nuked or in a rad storm) but not shit to do or see there. Total waste of space in it's current form.
---
They need to force you to make new characters somehow. If you spend all your time on one character, you'll get bored more quickly.
---
Absolutely my thoughts too.
---
Just delete the game, to fix it at this point is an investment of talent/time/money that I don't think Bethesda/Zenimax really has.
---
It's been an interesting experiment but clearly like Anthem, Fallout 76 needs a total rethink and relaunch.
---
No doubt will get downvoted to hell for this heretical viewpoint but it simply is stating how it is.
---
76 has promise, with the right care, time and thought put into more than just a Fallout themed experience but in the back end systems to support the game it could become something special and worth a bloody monthly subscription but right now, it's the trash heap of the internet and a laughing stock.  Fucks sake even Anthem is in positive news because Bioware is re-making the game from the ground up!
---
This made me chuckle in a sad way.
---
What's your gamertag? Maybe you wont be broke for too long
---
I have a lot of Mules, so I buy Scrip at 20c per scrip point anytime I find it, there isn't much to use caps on these days, I also buy any ammo that I use regularly like .556, but currently I have around 400K of that.
---
Well here’s some advice for those people, First you need to be level 105 to find all the secrets, have fun grinding (especially PC players), you get anywhere from 10seconds to 2 and a half minutes to explore, good luck finding your terminal that you want to find and getting to sit down and read the entries before you get booted off to select a deploy area . If you pick up and play a holotape prior to selecting your deploy location and you deploy the tape continues to play during the load screen but you cannot hear it. 
---
I did this found that I was greatly confused with what the story that’s being told since the holotapes are not in any specific order by the way they are locked behind overseer ranks. I grinding to level 105 in a month (and I wouldn’t say I’m bad at NW as when I would win a game I would almost always have 10+ player kills getting me ~1200xp per win and had a win streak of 9 games one night) and I hated every minute of it after level 40. It’s a sad disappointment to a story
---
I was just wondering about this last night. Either I totally suck at PVP (captured a workshop for acid), or was laid low by a cheater/team.
---
The short story is that I was mildly AFK at the workshop when it was contested and was summarily executed. I spawned a bit away and sneaked up to a building at a pretty long range I took one shot to one of the 3 guys that took over the workshop, a direct hit, and just fired my second shot (fast handmade), when I was one shot with some exploding weapon.
---
The time between my first shot to lock-on-and-be-killed was less than a second. I just left the game after that.
---
Annnnd stuff like this is why wastelanders isn't going to be any good sadly. 
---
BGS doesn't care to do the most basic of stuff. Bugs? Who cares. Weapons breaking armor? Who cares. Cheating in Nuclear winter? Nope, they don't care.
---
Pretty clear that this game only exists to sell stuff in the Atom shop.
---
IFF Pink Dildo level 50.
---
Unfortunately not.  You can choose to either complete the quest or keep the karma syringer (thus breaking the quest chain).  Dunno if you can pickup the quest chain at a later point or not.
---
They should change the Purveyor's name to Viagra, she gives me wood all the time.

---
That is exactly what fallout first feels like.
---
Surprise. A positive BGS support post has now, 2 replies. 
---
If this were a "BGS fucked me out of atoms post" it'd be flooded.
---
Glad you got a great customer service experience.
---
Downvotes dont bother me. I have my opinion and thats it. If people dont like it, they can keep downvoting. Fallout 76 is a mess of a game and a waste of Bethesdas time. They could have made a great Fallout 5 instead of this mess. I have over 1000 hours in Fallout 4. It is not perfect and never was but at least it had a real story and real lore instead of this holotape run in Fallout 76. And I dont think wastelanders will change much. Yeah, they will add maybe a few repeatable daily quests and a bit of a lore and maybe some NPC merchant. Thats all. I jope every day Bethesda will announce a Fallout 5 and keep moving instead of reviving this already dead horse called Fallout 76.
---
I seem to be in a queue to enter the world, you must be getting lots of visitors! How gifts given away so far?
---
In and out, deep breaths. It'll all be okay.
---
There are plenty of bad apples in the community. Spend enough time playing and you will meet them.
---
It is just an online community, nothing special or noteworthy.
---
At some point every player realizes that the tin can is holding them back and you will never look at power armor the same way again.  In the beginning its waaaaay better than regular armor but as you get max level legendary armor it rapidly becomes obsolete.  Also you can get power armor levels of defense from regular armor with the right setup, and arguably  better with sentinel and cavalier gear.  Power armor is only really good for rad zones (as nothing but a hazmat suit gives you that much rad resist) and heavy weapons builds.  But the latter is questionable based upon the weapons they use as it all hinges on 1 perk.
---
Can this really still hold with the absolutely flooding of the market though? Maybe after the event is over, but I've gotten so so many just in 2 days and I can't be alone in that?
---
What's this all about a backpack plan that doesn't work with a backplack?
---
Other question - did your Mons Austin or someone edit the item description so no one else had the same problem you did?
---
I hit the 150 about 5 mins after logging in. But dailys and presents go beyond the daily limit.
---
Yeah, have an event with lots of the festive scorched, maybe have it as a daily event? 
---
After all it is the season to be giving? Hopefully lots of cool content such as the outfits for us to use.
---
It might dip a bit, but not everyone has time to farm for legendary scorched. Also, once the event is over it will go right back where it was.
---
The quest marker should point you in the right direction, but if not, you can definitely find at least 1 or 2 bottles of quantum at the nuka bottling plant down on the southern edge of the forest. They can also randomly spawn in most nuka cola machines, and you can find them for sale at player vendors for 20-30 caps each. 
---
As for the nuclear material, there should be enough in the storage room where you got the second part of the recipe, but if it's been scavenged by someone else you'll have to go exploring. The nuka bottling plant has several canisters lying around, and if that doesn't pan out you can capture the Poseidon power plant and fire up the uranium extractor.
---
The issue is that it is *their* engine. Hackers are expected in any MMO, and there shouldn't be an issue handling them with your own engine. No reason they can't query for anyone with strange weapons, why they can't log cheating behavior with certain tags or behavior or anything. They have the ability to access these engines themselves and look at how they work, or to even lock down their system in a cornucopia of ways to not accept insertions into the database they have holding our inventories. It's just wildly inexcusable. A report system here is just lazy.
---
haha exactly what i thought &amp; same!

I vote for Behemoths wearing sixty foot long strap ons that home in on hackers and chase them around screaming how much they want to looooooooveee them.

Nah. See, post Fallout 4 JH simply does whatever gets views.

When speculating wildly was the rage, he hopped on board. When hating the game hit a peak, he talked about being done with 76, but instead just started making videos with overtly click baity titles on any "controversy" he could blow out of proportion. 
---
He doesn't make Fallout videos because he gives a fuck about Fallout anymore. He makes circle jerk videos because it's his income now.

I got my mounted sloth yesterday!!

you have to have the pioneer backpack to have custom backpack skins from the atom shop, not the plan you can obtain.

no clue, doesn't matter to me as i know now. they'll probably edit it soon as i'm sure i'm not the only person who has encountered this.

I'm also a camp minimalist. I blame it on  my being born without an artistic eye or imagination, lol.

I do enjoy visiting other people's nice camps though.

Same
---
On the one hand, I agree that it's fun having an actual event to draw people together and I miss that aspect of previous events. On the other hand, this has caused me to go check out locations I haven't visited in months, and last night I spent like 2 hours just fast traveling from fissure to fissure killing legendary beasts and santa-scorched. I have so much friggin ultracite I can craft serums for months and not worry about running out.

Go back before the last 2-3 months and see how much "constructive criticism" are in his "BGS is about to get sued! Loot boxes! Pete Hines murders Babies!" Era of 76 videos.

Once he stopped going to school, and YouTube became his job, he quickly jumped on whatever circle jerk would bring him views and had on multiple occasions has had to apologize for just being flat out wrong.

Lately, it's been more balanced, but he offsets it with "Im gonna delete this video in 2 days" type bullshit.

Are you playing a role within in the context of the story?
---
Rpg stands for Role-playing game. This thing you are eluding to is not necessary to qualify the game as an RPG. 
---
I have run tabletop games that have fewer non player characters than 76.
---
It absolutely is a Role-playing game.
---
CoD and Battlefield are absolutely not RPGs.
---
This is my build, feel free to use it. It's a stealth anti armor melee build that uses vanguard, ap refresh, better sneak armor. I currently only have 3 peices of vanguard, and have defenses comparable to pa, if not better.

Lvl 40 Furious Power Fist from the only legendary in a group of 3 SB west of Top of the World.
---
Well, I've never played a game with any seasons/leagues like that so I can't speak to whether or not it's good or not.
---
However, what you just described is how I feel survival mode should work. What they put out was just adventure mode with bonus xp, no fast travel, and open pvp, which is great, but they let you hop back and forth at will which was stupid.
---
Obviously it attracts people who are rich in adventure mode and can put together God tier pvp gear easily. 
---
It should have been clean slate, maybe bring in your leveled character but they start with no gear. A copy of that character stays on survival, no going back and forth.
---
I still hold out hope they'll do that one day.
---
I'm with you on it being a great cap sink though.   Every couple of days I was buying random plans I didn't need to get away from the cap limit.  At least with these you get a shot at some decent stuff I might actually use instead of an NV scope for a gun I dont even use to begin with.  They need something like this to waste caps on year round IMO
---
several combos, have not wore power armor since I had unyielding and bolstering drop with weight reduction and strength boosts. The only reason for me to wear power armor is nuke zones anymore. The risk outweighs the benefit of power armor, for specific builds anyway
---
If people that do get a gift could switch servers to give others a chance to get in that would be appreciated lets all have fun guys
---
I’ve been selling them for 100c as I’ve got way too many. I assume most players over a certain level already know them. Saying that I have been selling loads of them so maybe I’m selling them too low.
---
I guess going broke at Christmas buying presents never changes... 😉
---
No armor works IF you reload a wepon.
---
That being said, melee users don't reload, and I stomp ass with my melee build using vanguard armor. Vanguard ap refresh+dodgey=fuckin broken.
---
I actually find MMO's like this fascinating sample sizes for psychological behavior. So you're not alone there.
---
Except I’m only buying for myself lol
---
I spent many hours last week building me a tree house, and it looked like shit compared to all the amazing camps I have seen here on reddit. So rage-delete and a greenhouse later my camp was done.
---
It sucks to see what can be done and then not being able to do anything like it.
---
PC does lol.
---
Take that you PC elitist snobs.
---
I enjoy looking for rare and unique weapons and armor and then trying to figure out ways to optimize a build around them.
---
Duping on PC has killed this for me though so now I'm mostly just playing with hope that Wastelanders will bring back rare and unique gear or at least enough content to keep me busy until Diablo 4 drops.
---
I would say the game is best with friends!! And I personally, having played the game since launch, I would say the community is great most of the time. For instance, I and many MANY members of this community have been gifting low levels players items and loot to the low levels from the free trial. Now the one problem with most 76 players (and this is going to get me downvotes, however it is my only problem with this wonderful group of People) is that the vast majority of players strive for game breaking and at times over powered builds based on over-priced weapons. I am referencing bloodied builds. I can explain In a dm if you like as I know this community doesn’t like me sometimes
---
Yes but you don't need the special edition to enjoy it. Had to remake an account on pc due to platform switch, hit level 50 in a week, gained more than 2500 free atoms just by playing, you can get a shitton if you grind the challenges.
---
And value will get worse closer to the end of the event, trying to get my stuff out there now so I’m not sitting on so many plans by the end of it
---
What do you mean, before now?  I have sold several hundred thousands of caps worth in the past
---
when I first started a little under a year ago my kid was lvl 25, I was lvl 5. he had heard of great loot to be had near the top of the world and watoga. He's pretty young and novice at shooters, but not bad. Well, he wanted an escort. We get to top of the world ok, after some intense battles with super mutants and gustys. I returned to camp with maybe 5 bullets to my name and two basic melee weapons. I warp back and he has gone on a fair bit ahead. I struggle for a while to find my way up the cliff face when I suddenly, and literally, bumbed into my first deathclaw. Well he turned around like I just grabbed his rear end.  Those in the area may have heard two or three gunshots and a loud scream, followed abrubtly by silence. The only sounds echoing through those hills was that of a fallout 76 newb being a snack. Then later Rose made me make friends with that same deathclaw....lol
---
Or the other time he happened to shoot a shorchbeast, offended, the creature must have thought it was me. I kissed my butt goodbye but survived that one.... allbeit only by hiding in a trailer i stumbled upon.
---
in Fallout New Vegas my friend and I would play in a party together and he was afraid to go anywhere because I convinced him there was a super deathclaw queen out there.
---
Lmao! Trapper armor and broadsiders  seems to be her favorite thing for me. She'll throw in some black powder every once in a while to mix it up.
---
Why don't they do like the Borderlands games did? That made it fun, (for me at least) when I got my character to defacto 'god mode' then fought against more powerful versions of the same old but slightly modified enemies.
---
The Purveyor gave me a duped BE15R Fixer. It was pretty disappointing.
---
It's sad but it seems like the experience that you and I are after has been ruined due to duping. We aren't going to find anything unique.
---
They now drop pretty regularly from legendary scorchbeasts as well, including ones you've already learned, which the queen doesn't drop.
---
Depends on what you're willing to do. If you want max profit then put it around 500 and 1000, if you just want to make some caps and not throw it, around 100 and 500, people will use it or sell it the double, I sell it cheap because I don't care.
---
Since people aren't yelling about mule stashes I'm going to assume it's not all that common at train stations lol.
---
Why is here a cap limit and why is it so low?
---
And Unyielding stuff
---
I just nuked Morgantown and used my TSE pump with the enforcer perk and scattershot. I crippled hoards of glowing and if a direct head on shot did more than 10 pct damage I would be surprised. 
---
...but the lower level #30 following me around was extremely grateful as he/she was able to get a great deal xp and  loot while whacking away with their ski sword and I finished with my super sledge.
---
That is the only time I use my shot gun.
---
If people would put things other than trash stuff up and not price legendaries x10 the value they should have...
---
I’ve been server hoping for weeks looking for the basics to buy up my new build/character and I still haven’t even been able to outfit him in basic 1* legendaries to fully enable his build b
---
That, and these camps are spread out in ridiculous places that have cost me tons of caps just getting around to look at the “ten” or so “weapons” or “armor”, which damn near always end up being basic vendor fodder broken as normal junk or overpriced gear...it’s no wonder people have given up; shoppings a bitch when the sellers don’t have it together.
---
Not everyone with these things is a hacker and deserves bans, I have purchased thing from the dev room in player vendors.
---
Thanks for the lever action! Good luck getting to 500
---
It used to be lower.
---
The target triggers from 4 would be awesome
---
I know exactly what you mean. I don't have the greenhouse but good idea.
---
Not that again! *Facepalm*
---
I understand what you're saying but saying power armor is compatible to a non PA build is simply false, lack of perks which you even mentioned. Along with more percentage based reductions alongside with extra resistance perks and ide argue more importantly serendipity and AP refresh, and more mix match options there's no comparing. I love power armor heavy Gunner builds but in the current meta? Nah
---
Makes sense for the strength buff.
---
😔
---
I did some dropoffs at the vault entrance and at the overseer's camp.  Ended up finding some decent level one and level five legendary gear while running Forest area scorched sites for holiday presents (in private servers, so I wasn't clearing them out ahead of legit newbies).  Bundled them up with a handful of diluted stimpacks, radaways, grenades, dog food and booze (of which I got plenty from those holiday presents).  Left out the Nukashine, of course.  That's not a good way to start off the newbies!
---
 I even got lured into buying those present box loot bag skins from the Atom Store.  In hindsight, I wonder how many newbies were scared off by the name?  "Gift Trap Box" doesn't exactly inspire confidence.  I think B. was trying a bit too hard at theming there.
---
Daily and weekly dry up? Ez 40 a day without the lvl up and weekly is around 100.
---
Mind you I don't care for PA skins but making enough to get a 300-500 item every week or two. If you have to have everything it's not going to cut it but I just let them add up. I like all the sale stuff for camp's.
---
&gt;  but you can't just assume every single weapon that is good is duped it's silly.
---
And I never said every single good weapon is duped. I think I said 90 percent of the God roll weapons that literally everyone is looking for are duped.  And I am not just making this up. Everyone I know who has a god roll weapon bought it from a duper. And I say that not out of speculation or assumption. I say that because they told me they bought it from a duper.
---
Agreed but better than awful is still terrible lol.  I just end up jumping from ditch to dirch instead 🤷‍♂️
---
Yes &amp; yes. It should be on sale for half that price right now too.
---
Yes they can and do currently. I know quite well how this game works as I've spoken with eck numerous times, and have hacked older online games like Diablo 2. 
---
I know this is possible because they are all over on pc.
---
You don't need to go to Whitespring, just look for a container that has 0/0 in the corner as they have unlimited storage capacity. Cash registers, burlap sacks, and those little blue lunchboxes all fall into this group.
---
I don't get it, what's the punchline?
---
Don’t bother with the Tri edition. You can even upgrade to it for $20 in the store. I just bought the base game for my second XB account for $20 a few days ago. 
---
Also lost my tri edition items when I moved from PS4 to XB and don’t miss them.
---
Near the entrance of Tanagra town I have my camp out there, a sloth or death-claw spawn each time I go over there so far
---
 Dude I’ve had trouble with the atom shop some many times... I accidentally bought the straw hat, got it for free, didn’t like the color of vault tec university  track suit under armor, and got the atoms refunded and the item kept too.
---
Shame, you'd certainly be welcome to drop in. I don't really wanna give away the exact location, otherwise more people will build there and I won't be able to place my camp lol. Let's just say NW Forest and leave it at that.
---
It is silly we cant de-rank cards at will.
---
The area around the Pumpkin House.
---
I love doing the Project Paradise event and will jump on every time it shows up if I can, but boy do I hate the layout of that place. It's so easy to get turned around than then bam, you've got an Assaultron melting off your face. Plus the loot bags rarely show the location down there if you die after the event ends.
---
Yeah, as others said, it's folks dumping their holiday box hunting results, after they've maxed out their scrip sales for the day.  Ice machines and other containers next to the vendors at train stations used to be common drop points for leftover legendaries, before the Purveyor came along.  People would drop them for others, instead of selling them for a couple dozen caps.  I kind of miss those days.
---
I saw your camp!!!
---
I wAnT tO pReSs E oN tHiNgS bEtHeSdA!
---
I usually only buy what i know i will like but i wanted a diff backpack to match my outfit but that didn't work, still too lazy to unlock the pioneer scout one to be able to use it and i'm level 205 lmfao.
---
Funny how every week there's some game breaking bullshit or Bethesda being greedy assholes, but you still get downvoted lol.
---
 This community is so desperate to love this game.
---
If your doing a melee character you want to go bloodied and unyeilding nothing else will come anywhere near it look for pieces with +strength ideally, armour is not broken anymore it got sorted I think on Thursday when they rolled back the patch imo if you wanna do a heavy build as well youd be better off doing 2 separate characters as although both need high strength heavy gunner will use different perks to melee a hybrid will be effective you just wont be able to get the 100% best out of a single character
---
Yes and Yes but honestly I bought the Tricentennial edition and I don't think it was worth it for the skins you get - unless you're just super patriotic.
---
Dafuq did you buy?
---
Use a friend or the Facebook group the couriers. No chance to lose all your stuff.
---
It is really bizarre that the main quest completely ignores that area as well as the ash heap. Responders happens in the forest, Raiders is mostly in the divide, Free States takes you all over the Mire, BOS brings you to the bog, and the Enclave has you going back to Whitespring and the bog again.
---
If you play on pc, you may be seeing it reel soon ; )
---
Almost heaven ...
---
Just the going to a location and finding everything dead with santa scorched bodies on the ground type of missing out....on public servers anyways.
---
I found one in VTU
---
Don’t build on edges of the map.
---
Don’t stock normal weapons or armor hoping to trick someone in- just pisses people off
---
Don’t overprice your legendaries- no, a 1* bloodied anything isn’t worth 5k caps
---
Don’t build near known mob spawns
---
Don’t up and leave a game without checking to see if someone’s buying from you. 
---
Go the extra mile and sit there waiting with open commas- talk.  Be willing to make deals on stuff a buyer might need not being currently sold, if you have it or can get it.  (These guys become my go to sellers). 
---
That’s the basics, but a lot of people are fucking em up.
---
That got sorted think it was Thursday armour works perfectly fine
---
I've got about 2,500 in the game since BETA. 2 weeks ago I finally got my first God roll weapon from the Purveyor.
---
It's a dupe........she gave me a fucking duped weapon that hundreds of players already have on PC. 2,500 hours and the best thing I've found is something that hundreds of players not only have......but they have several of them in their inventory.
---
The  more I level use and don’t really need new perks, i started making rank 1,2 and 3 of each perk card. Then I can mix and match whatever rank I need at that time.
---
It reminds me of FO3 dungeons with how dark and dirty it is-- I love it for this reason.
---
After the laggy mess of a Halloween event it's  better than nothing!!  Definitely has brought me to some places I haven't been in quite a while as well.
---
I dearly wish they would increase the drop rate and/or expand the drop locations on those two.  I don't particularly care about taxidermy, but I'd love to get plasma grenade and tomahawk plans for my own use.  Hopefully they'll be common enough to be affordable by the end of this event.  I know i'll be haunting all of the plan-selling player vendors in a couple of weeks!
---
I need this so bad! I can't never play with my friends who use strangler PA, so i love that something like this exist, but...
---
1) I have no idea how to install this mod

2) This is a non-official thing, is it safe to use it?
---
Toxic Valley should be an endgame area D: too much radiation, it's annoying. But usefull for mutation farming.
---
...5\* star legendaries \**CHECK\*...*
---
Since the event and the influx of receivers being sold I'm selling mine at 175/p for now.
---
I wish. And incorporate your overseer level in it.
---
I’ll check around there next, thanks for the lead!
---
My brother is deaf,  so this is a big deal for him
---
The ones who downvote me are the silly people who waste their money on fallout first and are in denial about the scummy shit bethesda does.
---
The thing is: I mentioned every single point you just made in my first post. Literally every single point. I'm really not sure where or why you're disagreeing. Most of the perks you miss out on with power armor are unnecessary anyway thanks to its high DR/ER. Dodgy still works. The big issue is Serendipity which I mentioned.
---
I agree with Assassin's Sentinel being better. I never said otherwise. The point was always that power armor is much better than people give it credit for. It's surprisingly effective.
---
Server hopped a few times. 6 regular toasters each time. Thanks for the suggestion, the hunt continues.
---
I can get on in hopefully 10 minutes however if you have calibrated shocks i need that
---
It would have been cool if they had made them elves or something
---
Keep on making videos man, don't let folks get you down. I appreciate your coverage of the game and half the time just wait for you to post a video and then go click your reference links rather than dig through the info myself when something happens around the game. Thanks for the hard work!
---
Trying these spots next, thanks!
---
The community is very nice. Pro tip: once you reach level 5, make sure to take all the workshops you can! They give free resources.
---
Your bother plays Fo76? SKILL 100
---
On Xbox, I went through Glassed Cavern last night thinking I'd find scorched, but every mob in there was am eyebot, except for 3 scorched and the Sb at the end of the cave.  I went all the way through hoping to find an eyebot scaled up to scorchbeast size, but doubly disappointed to find a plain old scorchbeast.
---
So if you click on the pile, and it shows (2), (4) or (6) etc on the top left of the screen, it still counts as only 1?
---
Thank you so much! If I ever see you in the wastes I have a vodka and bourbon ready for you
---
You could literally sneeze and gain three levels this weekend if you event hopped. 
---
I’m not sure why it was so easy, but I’m thinking they fucked up double weekend and made it quad or something.
---
Retodded, but you know...
---
Damned if they damned if they don't...
---
Yep!  I got a little too wrapped up in gift-wrap mania and ended up having to scour Whitesprings for vases, phones and coat hangers to sell for my fast-travel fees for the day.  Haven't had to do that in a hundred levels!
---
Spoiler...... he takes off like a popped balloon.
---
Without any chems or other buff I hover around 425.
---
Im on PC and this happens quite a lot, although it appears random, in as much as I can't say what I think MAY be causing it.  Very frustrating when you can't hear your own footsteps, cos its obvious the "enemies" still can.    
---
One thing I HAVE noticed though, is that more often than not the "server not responding" message nearly always comes up at some point in time afterwards, and it crashes.  has just happened now... logged on 20 mins ago ( Monday, 16 Dec at 1710 UK time) and it was intermittently going silent.... And right now, at 1737 server crashed.
---
Man I feel this pain. 300k caps gone already. Have like 10k left to my name.
---
Don't pay that much it's not needed, I paid 14 dollars for mine . several months ago at a pawn shop. I was in one recently and saw the regular  edition for 8 bucks. It's a fun game but glitchy and buggy as hell it will try your patience at times.
---
Seen several bars being built, but this one has to be the best I've seen so far. I especially love the fireplace placement 👌🏻
---
Just like the good ole days lol
---
Good. I'm glad they dealt with that so quickly, because it was killing builds entirely.
---
np, good luck- VTU one is in main building, second floor, 'B 3 Food Prep Lab' room. Nicholson's end one is in the trailer, not the house. Took me a while to locate when searching because I was expecting it to be on a countertop.
---
I think I may have may have the plan.
---
I won't won't be online today, but I'll have a look and let you know the next time I am on.
---
Power armor plans
---
SCORE! Found one in the wire trash bin inside the easternmost shack at Nicholson’s End. Thank you!
---
I'm level 121 and I walked in there thinking it couldn't be that bad and promptly was handed my ass.. on a platter.. with a hint of garnish.
---
O noes!  A ten dollar game it takes literally one day to get a new character to level 100 in.
---
That’ll teach em. 
---
*honestly, I think we’re fucked boys.  They ain’t stopping anytime soon.
---
Back to the caps grind lol. Hope you got some good stuff tho
---
It looks better than any build I've seen so far great work
---
Seeing that and then the raider tag made my day.
---
Everybody out shooting scorched or in NW trying to get those Halloween cosmetics
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
Tbh, the current game makes legit finding a good legendary such a time consuming pita, that I’d stop playing long before I even got one. 
---
Part, perhaps most, of the problem is this.  We need to get better drops without these overly tight restrictions.
---
The large gifts (1400caps) for rare plans.
---
I haven’t done NW yet. Tried it awhile back but it’s boring just sitting behind a bush or restarting when I get killed 5sec into the match.
---
Yeah I remember wanting to do 4 in demo expert and accidentally going to 5. Needing to pump another 4 points into the card was laaame.
---
Don't have that one sry
---
Also, how much caps would you like for it?
---
Awesome idea!
---
Wouldn't actually listen to this tip OP, only way for PvP to be initiated is in Workshops
---
Iv done a bunch of stuff at a time without issue but it’s always risky. I use the ice chests by the pool in flat woods myself. Ice chests have no weight limit.
---
Try Spruce Knob, I didn't notice a toaster, but I did find version of the office fan that was a like new item, as well as like new cans and others. Up inside the dome.
---
I landed a prime auto receiver for the handmade rifle.  As I already have a BE auto primed and a B25 FFR primed I may sell it.  500 caps?  I doubt it.
---
^wouldnt ^actually ^listen ^to ^this ^tip ^op ^mimimimi
---
Mounted SB head plans, based on how many of them (0) I've gotten compared to most everything else.
---
High Dr and ER are nowhere near as important as perks, serendipity is in fact a huge deal in PVP even as a full health build, I run at 300 Dr and 450er and can still tank 110s from a bloodied Tesla, but as of now with the current meta being bloodied Tesla builds power armor doesn't cut it. If Tesla's got nerfed to stop arcing off the ground and quantum spamming gets a cooldown timer, then yeah definitely.
---
Tanking quad Tesla's are easy with stims but colas will always be better unless they get a cooldown timer for pvp
---
I sit in the bush and go on Reddit it is boring though so me the wife to on it one night a week once we get to 100 we won't be doing it again
---
I have a Anti-Armour Ultracite Gatling laser on PS4 (not the plan just I have the gun)
---
Same Boat.
---
Just cleared my vending machines to make Space.
---
Theres a tree with stuff in it nearby the cabins
---
&gt; Using Fallout 1st for the first time while levelling a new character was amazing.
---
It's a totally different experience. 
---
I levelled an alt 20&gt;51 in 9 hours, mostly in the Glassed Cavern and Fisures (ultracite thing) to get tons of legendaries and gifts while levelling, and it worked fine!
---
Some emotion is lost (level spawns) but with method, to level up in 1st servers can be fast, op (with support gear), unrisky, and low resources consuming.
---
Attacks in Souls are probably 3 times slower, yet you won't complain about that, right?
---
Yes, I believe it does. I still run with the Gutter to do those level up challenges.
---
Until this event, they were the only way to get PA plans. They'll go back to being the only way after the event is over. Maps aren't worthless
---
I don't get it. You bought the large paper wrap? Or do people sell their gifts ?
---
Why would you buy them? It's random?
---
Marsupial makes a lot of places better to visit. I get it on my level 1s right away and restore if need be - worth the 300c cost. So worth it.
---
Fairly sure some effects mess with PA mechanics and the game would crash.. I applied the faster movement speed to power armor and the game crashed after sprinting in f4, maybe that's why they dont have em because some do not work at all..  
---
might need a whole new legendary loot list and thats a bitch..
---
I'm not sure it was the hot fix. Wasn't that pushed out before the weekend? I played on Saturday and all the scorch were fine. Played on Sunday and had five headless unkillable santa's in the Big Bend Tunnel. Also had 0 santas in Harper's Ferry when it was a primarily scorch spawn there. Like a lot of glitchy things in the game (although the HF thing might be on purpose for some reason, I guess), there doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme nor reason behind it.
---
Yeah i know about that but ive tried that before and couldn't find a way to turn off the screams
---
Don't have 1 of those up yet but if I get more they will be up and remember if you happen to be #25 you get large handmade holiday gift could have one in it
---
It does count as a sword and a machete also counts as a sword.. I’ve used both multiple times to do the daily kill assualtron with sword or level up wielding a sword.
---
Which event, and which plans specifically?
---
Damn, that’s impressive. 
---
So no chance for doing it even with very good armour and guns with me and my friend? Presuming you need a full squad
---
But Todd approved.
---
What kind? Like armor pieces or paints?
---
You didn't put a number on it. You just said "if it's god tier, then it's duped." Which is absurd.
---
And now you know me, and I'm telling you my BE Combat Rifle, BFFR Combat Rifle, JE Fixer, and QFFR Tesla were all legit drops from enemies or the Purveyor.
---
Accepted 👍
---
Thanks for the help.
---
Went to morgantown. Got lazy (or perhaps im just tipsy) and decided it was "all or nothing".
---
Everything got tranaferred in the first attempt, so now I can start hoarding again. XD
---
Sounds like you're going to have to move before your annoying "neighbors" will move.
---
Just make sure u completely log out of the launcher that worked out for me.
---
I love it! I'm coming to visit :D
---
The computer there turns everything on or off. Every time someone exits and reenters that empty area, it might reset back to on though.
---
CONFIRMED! Second floor Food Prep classroom on counter against the wall. Thanks again.
---
Yeah I just realized I never finished the quest lmao I thought I did
---
There’s a switch or a terminal as far as I remember. Where you can also trigger the other effects.
---
Yeah ive been hunting down another junk extractor location but haven't found one yet
---
Meh. I dont think its necessary. I play with 0 audio because I'm usually listening to podcasts off my phone and if you're running through clearing areas you're going to see the scorched anyway. Also you can tell when they're nearby if you put subtitles on, just look for Legendary Scorched making any sort of sound
---
 You want a hardened receiver. Get scrapping. ;)
---
Yeah, it’s not like comms don’t exist.  Talking.  Wtf don’t people talk...
---
I'm selling them for 100c per, as common as they seem to be.
---
Cheaters make up a big portion of the small few that still play this game. Of course they dont care.
---
Yes that is correct.
---
Probably didnt sell well enough to bother adding
---
And here I just enjoyed popping the cymbal monkeys heads off...
---
yeah it makes sense. When the purveyor sale was happening I was blown away at how much scrip people had to spend. And coin. So I'm not surprised it was nothing for them to drop a lot of what they had. Pretty cool.  Last night I waited 30 minutes and nobody came for it so I grabbed a couple of guns I will actually use and left the rest for whom ever came around next.
---
Yes. You must be some hybrid human-beaver to have 7600 lol.
---
The area surrounding Lucky Hole has become one of my favorite spots in the game. It's full of all the rarer flora, lots of other ore nodes in the surrounding rocks, water, and the crater nearly always has a legendary creature. I camped at the foot of the cliff in front of lucky hole for a while, and then moved to behind it on top of the mtn, now I jump off the cliff in power armor and make my runs over toward Watoga. The crater on top of the mtn is another good spot for legendaries, too.
---
Good idea.
---
I ranked up Demolition Expert to 5. :-(
---
In reality rank 3 would  have done,and the 3 points would have left me able to rank 3 Fix it Good, rank 3 "Weapon Artisan "
---
Ah well.
---
You only realize what is good the longer you play.
---
I have played all day and not realized i did not replace Demolition expert after repairing my Weapons.And noticed no difference because i also have covert Operative Maxed out,and Mr Sandman.
---
**For caps**. Put Camp down near West Tek, run through West Tek and kill/grab everything, go to camp over encumbered, scrap/dump everything(Use Scrapper card), go to NPC vendor and sell all stuff you can for 1400 caps. Go back to West Tek server hop and repeat except this time you bulk all the junk and sell it at your player vendor for stupid cheap. West Tek mutants drop a lot of ammo, decent caps, and a lot of guns for steel/plastic/rubber/ and sometimes chems. With a bloodied unarmed build I can run though there and loot all the bodies in about 5 minutes without using any chems or ammo.      
---
**For holiday gifts**, like most have already mentioned Glassed Cavern is good but I personally prefer Big Bend Tunnel. For Events, if you can find a Scorched Horde event or It's a Trap, they are fantastic. They will keep spawning scorched as long as you dont kill the Legendary Scorched or the Scorchbeast. Line in the Sand event is also good.
---
 I have done this with up to 8 items and its never failed. About 30 odd times by now on my Fallout 1st.
---
All of it, unless your cap farming, then nothing beats a modded set of excavators.
---
I thought we had only just got rid of them too. Making way for wastlanders. Now they're back with gifts to win us over lol
---
Just do what other MMOs do. Increase the level cap by 5 or 10. Items with higher levels (dmg defense) can now drop. Done, no need to delete anything or whatever.
---
However they would need to fix the game engines code to be unable to be exploited before they did this, and I have ZERO faith in Bethesda being able to accomplish that.
---
I usually have a shop somewhere around Whitespring or the forest just outside of Whitespring. I rarely visit far flung shops and find it really annoying to have a player log when I’m browsing their inventory. They don’t have to be centrally located but shop in the NW and SW I rarely visit. If it’s in Cranberry Bog or The Mire I’m most likely to visit as that’s the higher level areas. Players shouldn’t even be selling normal weapons and armor unless it’s dirt cheap AND they’re located in newbie/low level areas.
---
Lots of nasties roam it, so building in its a no go, but it does hide you from scorchbeasts...
---
I always believed this was a post apocalyptic survival game. Oh well...
---
See you got it, congrats.  I keep getting the undamaged fan from black water mine and scrapping it before I remember to display it...  like 3 times now...
---
Awesome post. Also,  my wife and I are actually working on our PC characters now if you all ever hang out in the evenings central time we're always looking for more people to come in and out of my private world. XD
---
Yep, that's what I do too. Have around 90 perk swaps available.
---
Bad design. But yeah. This.
---
Mall Santa’s make the most sense to me due to the overwhelming amount of liquor they’re all carrying
---
It allegedly keeps inflation down. If you only have so many caps they become more valuable than if you have infinite caps. Whether or not that works, I don’t know and I just came up with this conclusion myself - I haven’t read anything official.
---
I dont think people give the Scorched enough credit. I mean they hang out together, talk to each other, and seem to be generally nice to each other. So who's to say they don't celebrate Christmas, maybe dressing up as Santa and hunting humans is their Christmas tradition.
---
Or someone who sucks less than me :)
---
Oh I like that one, a lot
---
It used to be farmable with alts, but, of course, it was “fixed” ASAP, unlike actual game breaking bugs...
---
What console you play on?
---
Scrip, not script.
---
There’s a poster inside the hq too.
---
Since I will usually kill the mega sloths :( the ones I find are in tanagra town, on the far right side of the map. once spawns in near the big tree.
---
Ouch. How the fuck do you farm westek?!
---
Scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap.... did i mention scrap?
---
It’s the Mario Kart of post apocalyptic gaming
---
Neither of these is really as bad as playing without a modded excavator in stash for that insane carry weight when need be .
---
You can get PA plans from the gift boxes
---
I wish more players had this kind of can-do spirit.
---
Thanks. I only run hard bargain when I’m trading, normally run line wanderer. That’s a good suggestion for luck of the draw instead of gunsmith, I’ll consider it. In terms of explosions, it’s diminishing returns for the explosive affect after 1 point.
---
Leave it alone until you fix legendary drops in game so a normal, non cheating player could get good items from normal play.  This exists because bethesda has literally made it impossible to gear yourself now.
---
They already did it with bottlecap mines. People probably didn't spend as much for those as for a 5* god roll bloodied explosive presidential gauss rifle, but it's the thought that counts. Bethesda was willing to take items away from innocent people, even if they obtained those items legitimately while they were world drops, with 0 warning or compensation. If they're willing to do that for an item that could be obtained legitimately, but not for cheated gear that was spawned in with mod tools, that just shows how broken their system really is
---
LoL! I suppose ur right.
---
Except without the vehicles, because, well, creation engine.
---
Regarding the vending, no one is entitled to buy anything from another player at a low price, so if you don't like it you aren't really losing anything just move on.
---
The convention must have been in Vallery Galleria...
---
That is obvious, but im literally talking about one or possibly two trades. And if i get it (in a trade) will i get banned? For getting it even tho i did not know?
---
*claps*
---
Yes, just yes. I dont see the reason why its not in the game yet...
---
How can I uninstall a disc?
---
O my, yes. Worse than ever.
---
Happened to me the other Week.
---
It is a nice gesture,it soon becomes tiring though.
---
No room in Appalachia for youthful innocence.
---
Hence why there are no virtual Kids left after the Bombs dropped........................
---
The adults  ate them all :-)
---
Cool, glass to help
---
Alternately, Might be nice to have the option to group them by ... related.. for lack of a better word right now.
---
That is, if a given person/task has multiple notes or holos, that they be either named sequentially, john doe holo1, john doe holo 2... so you can both find all of them in the list (and know if you are missing some) and listen to/read them in the correct order.  
---
Failing that, then if not named sequentially, that they be grouped together in the list.
---
A few are already done that way - treasure maps and the loose pages 1-6 you find in in big bend come to mind.
---
I'm gonna have to double check my challenges now damnit! HeHe.
---
The best part is, even on holiday season, most other games would have already either had a server rollback or an emergency hotfix by now. Even a temporary server shutdown if needed. I would gladly have the game be offline for a week than the pathetic cheating fest that NW is right now
---
Regardless of how YOU play, it is an extremely easy fix to add a sound effect caption - some people don't care to clear areas... sometimes they are just hunting for a specific thing.. this includes bobbleheads and books... Also, I don't think I've ever seen \*Legendary Sound\* subtitles...
---
I have the plans for sale. SurefireMarty1 on Xbox. Always on in the evenings between 5pm and 7pm EST.
---
I'm always set up near Whitesprings.
---
Yes!
---
You have a beautiful layout and it shows your eye for color and texture! I love the atmosphere! ❤
---
I know it's a game but irl that painting and rug really shouldn't be by the fireplace like that. No fireplace should have a rug haha
---
I dont mean they make a specific sound, I mean when scorch yell their throats or grunts or whatever, it pops up with who's saying it, so if it's a Legendary one it'll say that
---
Only way actually and not worth losing reduced carry weight for .
---
dont think its a hack
---
its a problem were the goopiles/meatpiles have despawned but the enemies havent fully spawned yet so they just seem to stand around but they cant be killed 
---
i have no clue about how coding works but ive noticed this occasionally since launch it appears to be some kind of lag/world not fully loaded
---
Well you see, 343, Splash Damage, and Microsoft have something called COMPETENCE. Bethesda has been lacking on that for the past 3-4 years.
---
People always forget portside pub 😥 I clear it out regularly and have a seat and chub a possum.
---
Selling them 100 caps a piece.
---
Thanks guys
---
Ummm, no. The definition is the definition. You can't just make something up to support what you want to believe.
---
That's cool, Anti-Armor is my 3rd favorite legendary
---
That's what I meant. If you play truly alone, avoid group events, never trade with people, etc, then this has minimal impact on you. But even trying to kill a SBQ might be a problem for you if somebody has a bloodied instigating swing speed executioner's junkie's power attack mighty vampire's super sledge with a full set of unyielding +str +agi bolstering vanguard's auto stim regen powered marine armor
---
Adventure is 99% safe, Nuclear Winter is sadly not.
---
Not worth it though for that extra 100 carry I might add.
---
Hey we’ve got Mario, donkey Kong, super mutants, bowser, BOS, Kirby and all the other characters that don’t belong together at this point in time in the fallout kart universe all gathering together to have a party
---
I suck at it too lol. I try but I dont spend real money so its kinda ugly and odd shaped and my lights dont work lol
---
I sell them for 250 which is probably the lowest you should go but 500 seems reasonable to me. I have 15 different prime plans in my shop.
---
Unyielding bloody is the key.  Everything else is icing on that cake.
---
Cool
---
You play a role within the context of many games, many of which are not RPGs. To go back to CoD and Battlefield, I'm playing a role there too, usually a soldier. But of course they're not RPGs.
---
you should mention your platform, if you are on ps4 im fairly sure i can craft it but im only going to be online in about 20 hours
---
Todd?
---
My friend recieved a serum plan from the present, so you might want to add that.
---
Yup, that's tru facts right there. And I miss it about as much as I do an auto Scorched Killer's Receiver for a 10mm pistol, lol
---
Go kill those holiday scorched.
---
Rofl!!!
---
I'm not advocating for automatically processing those things, just being more precise and being prophylactic in the approach to hackers. This isn't even real life, they should be able to just delete those weapons from the system and remove them from inventories. It's their platform, their game, their engine.
---
I meant hackers not scorched.
---
Leader of the pack gives 3 one star legendaries each time off each pack leader wolf. The legendaries are very low level.
---
Hit me up in a DM and I can share location with you.
---
Outside of finding it in player vendors it will just be from random drops.  Farm scorched right now lots of legendaries.
---
doesnt matter wich metal armor you scrap you can craft and scrap only light metal arms and you have the same chances of unlocking mods than youd have with heavy metal pieces 👍🏼
---
I have Twitch. I have Prime. Activating Twitch Prime generates an error with absolutely no shitty to check it. It just says "check your credit credit" and "try again". Yet there's literally nothing wrong on my end. 😠
---
Nice choice. Or possibly the Charleston Town Center Mall (before it got blown up)?
---
This was like playing fine, went &amp; ate dinner came back &amp; game all fucked up, I cant believe it just went bonkers within a 15 minute period of inactivity
---
yea.  I lived in excavator from L45 to about 138ish, when I finally a) lost enough weight to start using other PA and b) got WR armor.  (I still weight more in PA that out of it) 
---
Still get back in Excavator every time I do a loot for caps run.
---
my uny gear gives me 600 carry weight can you do that in excavator?
---
So dense plus 3pt fireproof...wondering if I can swap perk points now because I’m never dying .
---
source of this info, pls?
---
Wolf horde event in the forest will give three 1 star legendaries. But better off just going after low level scorched during the holiday event.
---
Yes it does.
---
But it doesn’t go “Choo Choo”... I miss that.
---
Brother, I’ve been there! I never auto scrap anymore because I always seem to “lose” things. Though I’ve also learned that crafting and repairing sometimes scraps from the stash box too :/
---
Make room.  At least 2pts.  You’ll thank me.
---
thats sounds like a nice idea for seasonal survival.
---
Oh yes you are right. I am on PS4. What time would you be on? I’m looking to get on around 5pm EST.
---
Haven't seen much unyielding, but I've been getting low level 1-2\* Vanguard from the santa scorched in the Forest.
---
i think everytime you fast travel back to camp it resets to screams
---
You can also get low level legendaries from the Campfire Tales event at Camp Adams. But the best way would be the farm the holiday scorched right now.
---
I played 76 from launch up until WoW classic dropped, I played it for a couple months but it is just SO SLOW compared to 76. I really miss the pace of a first person shooter. I just need more stuff to do in game.
---
thats 11pm for me i live in germany so it can be tricky but if you dont have someone to help you out till the weekend im sure we can find a common timeframe 👍🏼
---
I've had at least 3 BE rifles drop for me, two TSE's, several JE, at least six AAE, JE tesla, AAFFR tesla... all on one character that's only level 240. So maybe your RNG has given near zero of this stuff, but not for some (or maybe most) people.
---
You just don't have a clue, at all, about anything lol
---
That's actually why I like it. It's the only place in the game that actually feels post-apocalyptic to me, except for maybe Ash Heap. Reminds me of New Vegas a bit.
---
Smack her up!
---
(Did i say that loud?)
---
A full Power Armor has a 42% damage reduction (/% per piece) before armor is even taken into account, which means that even if you get more armor by numbers, you dont have the flat 42% reduction.
---
I think that would mostly be because ferals usually stick close to radiation never really giving them much of a chance for decontamination
---
The ones you’ll buy from me for 15k/set of course. 
---
You’d look good in pink I think.
---
... grinch ...
---
Servers don't even last 1 day before they bug out, let alone a week.  Just farming the scorched will get you plenty of gifts. Handmade gifts have better drop rates for the rare plans, as well.
---
It is all I keep in my punch bowl. I love watching people freak out then disappear. Dosing folks is fun!
---
I've gotten plans for T45 and T51 pieces.  No paint(s).  
---
IDK of paints are in the pool.
---
Uranium fever its popular so people will be doing to so all you need to do is get a hit on the legendary enemies and also roaming pack events usually have a legendary as the boss
---
R/usernamechecksout
---
There's one right across from the train station at the top of the world.
---
I've spent easily 50K caps on my one character in the past few days. I had gotten down to 500 caps last night before someone came and bought a plasma grenade plan for 10K, so as soon as I'm off work tonight I'm about to go blow all that on more gift wrap.
---
This is a way better cap sink than buying serum plans and selling them at a loss or giving away the neon letters plans, like I'd been doing. I'll be back to it again by the first week of January, but I'm enjoying this while it lasts.
---
Because people like me that hit max caps 2-3 times a week or more and have dang near everything can use Chemist and make 2 gifts per wrapper and get new stuff. Caps are easy, new stuff? Much harder to come by. I've been hitting up Big Bend and Glass Cavern for scorched but also buying wrapping paper like it's a Griswold Christmas. Way faster lol... :)
---
But one definition is wrong and one is right. Your P2W example, advantage is P2W, convenience is not. Simple.
---
I just got this too. Restart the launcher.
---
It was a great idea. Had over 150,000 caps and now I'm down to about 30,000. which is fine. 1,500 per character, per day just from selling crap, i will make it back in no time.
---
They need to do more stuff like these boxes. Gives value to caps.
---
I’ve had multiple sets of them all from months of farming at fo beginning and I’ve yet to discover which is the “rarest”, as they all, besides the dirty/white ones, spawn rarely.
---
Unlikely. In the past I don't think they have banned people or removed anything if they were just receiveing an item. Just have to hope they don't change their minds.
---
I also went bananas with caps on this event.  Once I found out you could be wrapping paper, I'm now living in a box.  The drop rate for plans is crazy good.
---
The mounted scorchbeast / scorchbeast queen plans are not in game at all atm.
---
Ah, that makes sense. Not Mario Kart Fallout, Mario Party Fallout.
---
Yeah I'm thinking I'll keep lots of these plans until it's over. Else risk selling them for less, somebody else will probably swoop em &amp; do the same.
---
Frankly though my plans rarely move &amp; they're priced pretty reasonably, 99c jetpack plans for example just sitting stagnant.
---
I have an arsenal of weapons, mostly acquired through the trading subs, it's one of the things I like most about 76 actually.
---
Plus the whole Nuclear Winter doesn't feel forced, since battle royals are something I'm not particularly good at &gt;w&gt;;;
---
Thank you.
---
A typical scorched conversation: "us?" "We."
---
Yeah just a suggestion. I maxed out explosions before that nerf hit so I just roll with it anyways. Luck of the draw has essentially removed repairing weapons from the game for me.
---
Then they're the rarest of all!
---
Yeah but not worth being ganked for
---
I was going to say.  1 in 50 was generous because I have no idea what it takes to get a God tier roll.  In my 200 hours I'm not even sure any of my primary weapons are modded, if I recall last I played, the only modded weapons I was carrying around were quest rewards.  
---
That said, that's amazingly sad the weapon you got was the same as one of the duped ones.
---
FOLLOW UP - Hilarious Free Weekend/Double XP fun:  
---
So... I started a new character this weekend. On two separate occasions (at level 7, then at level 26) saw the event pop up and thought... what the heck, I'll go sponge some xp...dropped all my junk, traveled in.   
---
1) Level 7 run- Oh crap... no one else is here. I'm hiding in a bush next to a ghoul, hoping desperately he doesn't aggro before backup arrives. Nope. He sees me. Noone comes. I hop up onto a Truck... (this truck will become the hero of the story...). Long story short, one L104 guy shows up but leaves after dying twice. I fail the event. But level up to Level 11 just from shooting ghouls from the top of the truck down the hill. broke 3 guns, had a few heart attacks when ghouls figured out how to climb the truck. Not bad...   
---
2) Level 26 - Oh good, there are people here this time. No problem. a level 32, a level 28 and a level 107 or so. What? they are ALL DYING REPEATEDLY to the massive horde of ghouls? Back to the TRUCK!!! Again, we fail the event, but despite all the dying, my stalwart companions continue to respawn. I make it to level 30, pick up 4 or 5 legendary items. (we did kill the nightstalker eventually, but not in time to "pass".  
---
Conclusion- Even failing this is not a bad way to farm xp, chems and drugs. Look for the magic truck half way down the hill towards the road. Climbing up from the back is easier. The ghouls CAN climb it from the front, but it's hard for them and shooting them often knocks them back down. Bring lots of ammo... :)   
---
(melee NOT a great option with new improved ghouls poison damage)
---
Because it has tons of rare plans you can learn and sell latter in a month for over a thousand caps each. They are going to whitesprings and buying all the wrap from each vendor.
---
So let go some good stuff for reasonable prices.  I need a AAE handmade, aae 50 cal, furious ski sword and some vanguard scout armour pieces.  Currently have up to 20k caps for some of this.  Let a brother score a deal and get more caps!
---
You’re such a nice fella
---
True, good point
---
You serious? Lol no ones hacking your playing fucking fallout it’s riddled with bugs
---
No
---
3.  That’s it, usually one or none. I gave up already.
---
Yeah that works for me! I’ll hit you up later this week if no one else can help out!
---
I just want to make sure I understand correctly. You can buy wrapping paper from the vendor, then craft it at the tinkers workbench..... then do you put things in it, or you just craft it yourself and you get a mystery prize?
---
I remember Fallout 3 had like these super mutant ones, poorly made at they were at the citadel for the brotherhood. Those would be funny to have, maybe they could talk too lol
---
Mounts??!
---
You can get plans for crafting Raider, T45, and T51 and oldo get plans to mod those three armors..
---
I’m on Xbox
---
1week plus in my exp
---
I agree. Emergency Protocols is a decent alternative, but it's not quite as good as Serendipity. The good news is that Cola Nut works in power armor. I save my Quantums for folks that reach for teslas. It's serviceable, but teslas certainly need a nerf imo. 
---
You're undervaluing the potency of power armor's near instantaneous stims, though. Stim spam is a lot more potent than you'd think. I've got around 160 Super Stims atm. With First Aid and Field Surgeon, my healing can be crazy.
---
Not sure about the PC meta, but Bloodied isn't as popular anymore on PS4. Junkie's high health is way more dangerous thanks to the 110 cap and QFFR is the go-to tesla. Bloodied is viable, but not king anymore.
---
You dont need to put anything in it. Once you craft it, it will go into your aid tab in your inventory where you can open it. When opened you'll get a junk item, an aid item and 1 or 2 plans as well as some caps or scrip for the larger ones.
---
Grinch Behemoth... chasing a group of Xmas Scorched...
---
On PC yes, on console no.
---
Good stuff, keep up the holiday cheer! I'll try to check you out if my main internet is ever fixed, cheers Cox Communications.
---
The old reward death claw gauntlet from the old pvp mode.  
---
That things a damn beast.
---
You’re very generous, any chance you can hop on 3-4 hours from now?
---
Man, I don't remember that, but now I want to see. I wish they would remake 3.
---
Yeah I opened 20 and then realized they gave scrip. Pretty sure I was already maxed 😭
---
Absolutely just msg me on hear
---
Uhh I have yet to find any christmas scorched or presents, what's the secret?
---
I did enjoy spending all my caps. Good to see them spent honestly. Hope you got some good stuff.
---
Yeah, I see what you mean. Someone above suggested a terminal hooked up to these dummies to simulate different creature resistances.
---
I still only have one character. loving it.
---
I make my living selling bulk scrap quickly at low cost. While this week has been fun with the gifts and everything, I haven't been able to participate the handmade gifts very much because traffic to my vendors has all but dried up. My bulk scrap is just stacking up in my vendors until my stash is full, then I sell the overage to the robot vendors until I hit the daily cap. At that point I just hold on to it until the next day. It has been a noticeable change in behavior.
---
Should be able to break those fuckers up whenever we want. The way it is now is just a tedious waste of time.
---
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.
---
mounted head...
---
They had like bucketheads with drawn mad faces on them. You see some brotherhood shooting at them.
---
And yes I totally agree with that they need to remake Fallout 3, or have another team work on it or something lol I want it, and well New Vegas but I know that will never happen.
---
I agree, but having those aid items on you for the occasional emergency ain't a bad idea.
---
Xbox, ps4 or PC?
---
Yeah that’s nothing to do with hacking lmao
---
I’d also like to see a creepy Santa’s Village with Rad-Reindeers and toxic snow.
---
No paints, the two nuka cola paints, and the BOS from technical data are the only "in-game" paints.
---
I agree, I rarely accomplished anything during meat week or mischief cause every 45 min I'd drop whatever I was doing and go. I like the chill of this event, let me do it when I want. If I want to hop 15 locations, so be it, if I want to wander without feeling pressure, so be it.
---
It's not an either/or. My current build runs Cola Nut and Travelling Pharmacy/Field Surgeon/First Aid. I use both situationally.
---
This is more complicated than you make it sound. Tying every action to server side authentication makes the game feel very unresponsive due to delayed actions. Most players don't run 0 latency and especially players who aren't US based.
---
There are compromises which can be made, for example firing your gun and using ammo is client-side, but enemy registering the hit and taking damage is server side. This is already how it works and is fine for the most part (except Gun-Fu which breaks with lag but I'll ignore that). So this is the compromise we end up with, and it's necessary for the game to both run smoothly and be secure against cheats.
---
Now as the old saying goes "You give an inch, they will take a mile". That little bit of client side freedom for most actions which make the game feel responsive allow the cheaters to inject code and look for exploits in how the server reacts.
---
So there are pretty much two options when running a multiplayer game.
---
1) Have global servers to allow most players to experience low ping, and then make the game full server side (E.g. World of Warcraft does this)
---
2) Use the current compromise to make the game feel responsive, almost like a single player game, and stay on top of cheaters with a robust cheat-detection And enforced moderation (banhammer, dupe deletion)
---
Option 2 is much cheaper to run, and I personally prefer option 2. Problem is Bethesda only half-asses it and doesn't follow through with policing the integrity of the game economy and players.
---
tl;dr the problem isn't entirely server architecture it's Bethesda being lazy/incompetent as per usual.
---
Scout armor.  Unyielding.  Plus str.  Xxx
---
Xxx==.  Weight reduction of weapons,armor,junk,ammo.  Chameleon.  
---
Or another good perk,  yet yeah, this.
---
ah dang, you got me excited lol
---
Wait gifts give scrip?
---
Thought it was a couple of junk items and a plan.
---
Same, and I've been playing since launch.
---
A few thousand caps or 5.56/.45 rounds be ideal.
---
I'm almost certain that I have that plan.
---
I'll confirm with you when I get online 👍🏻
---
Didn't sell well? Every player I've found in the game has the [Keep Out skin](https://i.imgur.com/ZJcwh1i.png) or the [black skin](https://i.imgur.com/kSsB290.png) on his backpack
---
Ahh soo i can hope at least.
---
I used to get around it by dropping a stack at my feet then picking up one, turning it in, pick up others and fast travel to my camp I had just outside, fast travel back, repeat. 
---
Pita as I recall.
---
I'm hard of hearing so I can hear it though tbh it would benefit me as well as I use subtitles a lot myself
---
Stay in the forest, and run leader of the pack as often as it pops up. With the event going on, you can score 1-2 more from scorched in the nearby amusement park.
---
I've pulled 20-30 &lt;10 legendaries in the past week from farming on a new alt I started.
---
Sidenote: while doing the Halloween event I saw a player using bottlecap mines and letting people collect caps from them. So they were still around at that point.
---
I actually like it this way. The halloween event I only got to do three times because the game would bluescreen or just simply lock up.
---
I play every day. I dont have 5 star legendaries.  I have
---
No game breaking problems, and my playstyle is completely unaffected. 
---
I'm not saying problems dont exist, but to say the game is doomed is too much.  I am completely unaffected by the handful of cheat only items I've seen in vendors.
---
No, that’s a visual bug and it drops.
---
Normal ghouls to there is a guy in underworld who is always losing limbs talks about his skin still burning and itching
---
It’s too bad that not one more penny was given to them until Wastelanders. I like this game, but even I had to take a break due to the lack of content. I would even take survival mode back, just for a change of pace.
---
Damn, that's a lot. I can't seem to keep more than 1k banked, spend them as fast as I make them, mostly on CAMP decor, occasionally outfits, never really skins.
---
  I used Toxic Valley to complete I am become death.  I had already been in several SBQ fights before I launched, so SBQ was not priority.
---
 I needed lots of violet flux (I already had lots of HM/GM/HRF).   
---
  Overencumbered/no fast travel, so I needed a short run from the silo to the nuke zone.   For a change of pace, I also wanted a different enemy set.
---
Toxic Valley fit that bill perfectly.
---
Took me about 3 minutes to run from the silo exit to the edge of the zone.  Everything from radtoads to assaultrons as enemies.   And I walked out with over 200 violet flux.
---
Well brace yourself for the approach of legendary PA. Have fun trying to pvp against a assassin+sentinel Power Armor set lol
---
Yeah I agree
---
You already have to go to adventure when you create and start a new character.
---
That's seriously not the point, bud, this is how you'd play, out yourself in a deaf person's shoes, right, wanting to hear the game but can't and unable to tell wtf is going on without the subtitles - think before you type
---
It is directly above the science room that has the Chemist workbench in it. If you can jump up and through the hole in the floor and then always to the desk in the corner you will find it.
---
Watoga as its always sub20 FPS
---
Also after disc didnt work I figured maybe my disc scratched itself while not moving with the console powered off so I 'installed' 76 from microsoft store, ran it &amp; kept getting 'cant sync 76 info' or 'vault tec is working on fixing servers' or some similar BS
---
This is ridiculous!!! I played, stopped for 15 minutes &amp; when I came back to play the dam game wouldnt load, NOTHING changed on my end!
---
/WTFRAGE
---
This is 100% correct
---
Oh, you pvp? Why would you play this game?
---
Yeah, its definitely per log not per total amount, I've learned this the hard way after hopping a bunch of wood places seeing hundreds of wood in my inventory only to discover like 30 marked down.
---
Yeah assholes keep abusing this and Bethesda could gaf less.
---
Damnit. Ohwell have fun giving those gifts out.
---
Christmas is working lol
---
It used to be bad in ws when they’d have you tag a robot and get killed/locked out. 
---
Now it’s just about being assholes.
---
I still don't get what you do with said paper. You craft a gift then open it yourself?
---
My current cap status is 1266, would 1,000 be okay? Also I don't have those rounds (I don't pick them up lol).
---
Kinda like the gun runners vendortrpn in Fallout New Vegas.
---
You know any popular areas? Just wondering
---
Grats. It's a really nice looking clean junk item imo.
---
Will do!
---
Nothing beats a nice pre-war stogie after a queen fight, or so I can dream.
---
Can confirm unfortunately, aside from a few "Repair 76 (weapon type)" the only ones I have left are either bugged (Discover locations), takes a long time (Kill 1100 with whatever weapon), or damn near impossible (Collect 7600 wood--has anyone even completed this one yet?)
---
I REALLY hope they give a new round of tons of challenges with Wastelanders, they did with Wild Appalachia and I was bummed they didn't add any for the summer
---
Your friend did not receive a serum plan from the present.
---
Im.online roght now so as soon as you add me do joun me
---
I’ve opened over 20 gifts of all variations, only got junk, plans and caps
---
Responders*
---
I've been asking myself the same thing. Can this game be saved on PC now? I've seen the 10-star-weapons. I've seen the cheaters in NW. 
---
   I'm just logging in to sell some legendaries/ get caps, do some challenges and log off. Unless they add an offline version of the game then i guess we're doomed
---
Yeah i kinda have the same problem. Except i still customers they just want to trade in .557 1 per cap which i accept. Now I have 50,000 .557 in my inventory
---
Bro I have been running private servers and building a santatron at every workshop and haven't even gotten one
---
Responders power amor skin isn't available yet, definitely an atom shop item
---
It looks like ya can,but I ain’t bout too spend these atoms if not.
---
I can find some other madness too spend em on I’m sure.
---
But If I can actually “display” something on it,I’ll bite
---
So I can't use It?
---
Me too. I love having little tent themed roaming caravan camps. Just need a couple people and I'm set. Hope they dont just cap it at 1 person. If I want 3 people, let me have 3, just apply it against budget instead of capping at 1.
---
I did manage to get like 98% of what I was looking for. Have one armor plan left to find.
---
As far as I'm aware, no
---
I'd also like to know because if you can I'll buy It!
---
Ok thanks.
---
I clung on so long and kept telling myself it would get better,but at this point they might as well just introduce mod support. You can spawn npcs before wastelanders even get here. You can so anything because they refuse to acknowledge the problem and just keep letting the fan boys brush it under the rug
---
Damn that's good.
---
So far, i've found some of the plans I need/want for 1k caps each.  I thought it was reasonable enough but going to guess that these plans will get cheaper over the next week or so.  Still, cheaper than buying large paper and rolling the dice.
---
Dang, id love to come and visit but I play on pc.
---
Stoner time: Give us bongs, makeshift whatever. 
---
Or an emote of taking the inhaler drugs, but the smoking one does sound cool.
---
You get scrip from dailys??
---
You can’t, sorry.
---
So to join you would I search your name and then click on join game? Just wondering never done this before
---
oh yeah, definitely the 80 ones, yea those are the grinding ones but I done the same thing. It is worth it if you can't afford to throw real money lol
---
Level 25 bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun, despite the level it puts In some serious damage.
---
Why?  What are you spending your caps on?
---
I have actually been selling a ton. Screws, acid, adhesive, and stims mostly. Some random plans move fairly well, also people seem to like the random stuff to put in display cases.
---
Only thing my vendors have are recipes for 5c and plans for 10c.
---
A lot of people have been happily buying my T60 and ultricite jetpack plans for those prices.
---
Several of these backpacks have been in sales already.
---
You were on a very old server.  The eyebot swarm means that the location has respawned enemies at least a dozen times and “ran out”.
---
It used to be a common thing with Whitespring nukes.  You’d be in a team, one person quits to desktop, rejoins team and you’d have a whole new pile of ghouls to slay.  When the golf club started spawning eyebots or protections, you knew the server was played out.
---
This. Craft and scrap is the correct way to learn mods. 
---
Craft and scrap light Arms is the efficient way.
---
"It just works!"
---
I see
---
Dad Gummit!!
---
Okey doke,I seen the planter on the preview pic &amp; thought too myself,how cool is that...
---
Glad I asked,&amp; thankful fer yer time.
---
Appreciate cha,&amp; Stay Blessed
---
Yes. The wrapping paper + adhesive can be crafted into a gift (2 if you have Chemist Perk equipped) at your tinkerers bench. You can open them for rewards just like the ones you get from santa-scorched.
---
Yup I'll be on for 10 more mins
---
And also, don't sell stuff every other vendor has. Recipes...NO. Broken weapons and armor...NO. Low-level plans...NO. Unless you are low level then you cant help what ya got. Research where random spawns are for rare outfits and outfit plans. Get them. Why sell 3848483 items for 5 caps each when you can sell one for 1-5K. Mags, maps and bobbles sell. Ammo but only 1 caps each. Some isn't worth that. Serums for $1K each...NO. GT MackDevious on Ps4 Helvetia south bridge. Middle of the map-ish. I don't even look at fast travel costs anymore but others do.
---
Dupers gonna dupe
---
This is what's available: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU\_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G\_G5qKE/edit?fbclid=IwAR2PP3ZDF3miukLA4DQ9sIYO2kTcZAeJ\_ByyG-Wxm32wm93e6gV0rFtP73Y#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit?fbclid=IwAR2PP3ZDF3miukLA4DQ9sIYO2kTcZAeJ_ByyG-Wxm32wm93e6gV0rFtP73Y#gid=0)
---
Pistol can be deadly in the right hands.
---
Yeah, I’d definitely buy the camo backpack.
---
Time dilation effects don’t work in multiple games. 
---
Law wise? No idea.
---
That is most impressive!
---
Im pretty sure jet wasn’t made until well after the the time fallout 76 takes place.
---
For me at lvl40 and still pretty pathetic, It has to be Watoga... The assaultrons and the infinite amount of protectrons...back wait a minute... I forgot the scorchbeasts...will completely OBLITERATE me...
---
Hasn’t been invented yet
---
&amp; I’m literally responding off the cuff,but I honestly didn’t even think of it,until I read yer post,Lol
---
Great suggestion.
---
Even though I’m not hearing impaired, I use subtitles.  It can be an “early warning device” for legendaries.  The subtitles will use the enemy name, so when you see Legendary Super Mutant Warlord say something, it’s a good idea to find them.
---
This was my thought. I've been buying serum recipes just to waste caps (despite having them all a long time ago) and this event has been great to actually spend them.
---
Looks like I need to stop by
---
Idiot you lost those caps not bethesda
---
Joining right now :)
---
For some reason I love finding and looting chems around the world and it was bugging the he'll out of me I couldn't find jet until I realised it isn't even in the game!! And if that's the reason then damn they take lore serious haha
---
NGL...  I'd splurge for the Nuka-Cola Hardshell (Corvega) backpack...
---
As do I.  Creepy a.f.
---
there isn't any official lore, it's just for fun.
---
i like your explanation involving mall santas, though.
---
It will probably be a day or two before I can get online, that will give you time to get the funds 👍🏻
---
Repeatedly run Leader of the Pack event in the NW section of the map, by Tyler County Dirt Track.
---
Dam my machine been dead also ..people spending hard on that gift wrap lol
---
Lmfao
---
I doubt it’s the reason,cause they ain’t all THAT when it comes to lore,but it’s what I’m gonna tell myself in the meantime,Lol
---
I used cheat engine a year-ish ago to see if they really wouldnt notice. They didn't. We need a real anti cheat.
---
Sheeeeet
---
Two words: Furious Shovel.
---
Add me, pacifichero45, I play off and on during the week
---
When it was introduced the week before Thanksgiving this came up a lot because their misleading photo shows plates on the table. You can put things on the table but it’s no different than any other table in that regard. Pretty disappointing.
---
the holiday event. find scorched wearing holiday outfits (santa, mrs clause, and snowflake suit) and they drop presents. open presents to get prizes. you can also buy wrapping paper from robot vendors to craft your own presents to open/give away. there is a chance you'll get raider, t45, or t51 plans from them. but it's slim, just like from the maps.
---
happy hunting.
---
Good point but still Jet was one of the cooler chems in game. We need it back!
---
The Fucking Mire scary af
---
Welcome to West Virginia and I hope you continue to stay with us!  I look forward to meeting you in-game someday soon!!
---
Okay, sounds great.👍🏼
---
Didn't know NW  is a farming simulator, my bad.
---
the community is shockingly nice, to the point Bethesda had to rework game mechanics. they expected us all to go full-on raider, instead we wave to each other and give starter care packages to new players. there's even a challenge for healing someone in water, and people have been jumping off cliffs into rivers to help others finish it. sure there are assholes, every game has them. but overall we are nice.
---
it being fun with friends depends on your friends, tbh. i have friends who actually enjoy the exploration/events/quests, but they stopped playing cuz they wanna wait for the Wastelanders expansion. so for now, i'm solo. still fun. i run a store lol
---
👍
---
Has to be a factioned vendor: Responders, Raiders, Shopping Mall, etc.  The base Whitespring vendors don't carry them.
---
I’ve seen this happen too but eventually it lets you drop your camp back where it once was. I don’t know if it’s a cool down period or a change in servers but the restriction is temporary.
---
Net everything is fixed my armor pieces are weightless the still currently are still 4 lb. I still have to have on sturdy armor to keep from being over carry weight.
---
on PC but thanks for the kind offer 👍
---
Go to locations on the map where there are scorched , like the Morgan Town airport and train yard.   Listen for sound of jingle bells to find a legendary scorched  dressed up In Christmas clothes and kill them.    They will always drop a gift.
---
This spreadsheet also indicates a higher chance for the plasma grenade plan coming from the medium gift over the large and small.
---
Yeah it's a lot of fun trading both on reddit and just in the community. On XBox we have the LFG to trade in as well - I find things cheaper there sometimes. Got some serum recipes for only 5k to finish my collection!
---
Keep it for a new character.
---
Didn’t realise until now - so let’s do Narcos FO style and be Jet-Barons. Next best thing: Vim!
---
Aa
---
You can get the tricentennial for about $30 on Amazon. :]
---
Ah sorry i just friended you without getting to this part of the comments first. My bad
---
Interesting, I genuinely have never seen either of those, most people I run into dont even have a backpack
---
i was wondering why the bells always scared the crap out of me. now i know. no visual cue they are there lol
---
but in all seriousness, they probably won't add them this year with the holidays coming up and them going on vacation, but hopefully they take the note for the next event.
---
Most likely will. sadly from this event it may be the best legendary ive foind so far.  Have my main 3 toins at max scrip too have a bank toon with all the extra stuff i cant sell.
---
yeah, im on xbox aswell
---
Its ok
---
Pay to win these days, I bought membership and have a private world where I capture multiple workshops and invite friends so they can help with defenses. I don't have my guard up while at my workshop is nice.
---
Right of the bath!! All kidding aside I am happy you enjoyed your time in Appalachia.
---
I was haphazardly clicking through buying gift wrap and looked down to notice I was down to 385 caps! Can’t think of a time I’ve ever been that broke in this game since the beginning
---
gotta find the lesser-explored areas. everyone goes to morgantown airport, for example. if my camp wasn't right by there i wouldn't even bother checking.
---
Like GTAO griefers wearing the same mask and glitched outfits.
---
I have one character from the start, sitting at roughly 23K caps. I try to keep a constant balance of at least 20K. Usually get it from selling med x, rad x, mentats, psycho, etc, at bit vendors
---
I usually end up breaking weapons down for the scrap. My best sellers at my vendor are purified water, radaway, stimpaks, I've sold a crap load of disease cure, 10mm ammo and fusion cells.
---
I few people in my groups have over 100K caps over 5 characters but I think that is a little over the top
---
Pfff. The baby sloth one was the most talked about when they first released the images 6+ months ago. 
---
They haven't released a tenth of the original designs.
---
Wow!  "Naked" and "playing Jingle Bells?"  It really is like Morgantown on Friday night, eh?
---
haha sorry english is not my first language :P will edit it! and thank you !
---
Didn’t realize you were jjst talking about an auto receiver.
---
Will do once i'm home! thanks man!
---
Thank you, looking forward for it as well!
---
Thank you so mich for the pumpkin plan, your camp looks amazing and Merry Christmas.
---
99.9% certain it’s Photoshop. Unless there’s some super secret unknown method, nobody’s been able to get more than 5*.
---
they could just change the effect, like making it regen ap or provide some other bonus.
---
Thx
---
I used to have that many caps lol. It’s all gone to a better home
---
If it's just photoshop why try hiding it ?
---
Probably to sell in their camps at ridiculous markup.
---
Agreed.
---
I put the atoms towards the actual “display” shelf unit,cause it was clear you could display things on em,but then I was givin er a second gander,tryin too make sure I wasn’t missing something,&amp; then I seen the yellow planter jammy on it,so I was thinkin hey,maybe ya can do the same wit that...
---
But yer reply cleared it up for me.
---
I mean,you can throw a plant on there,like any other table,
---
but it’s not like I can put a skull mask on the table &amp; expect it too be a “displayed” item
---
Thanks again fer yer response.
---
Much appreciated
---
I would buy it but I’m broke lol
---
those people are just either too busy to do the scout questline, or too lazy to go back to the morgantown airport to get the small backpack plan that was added. there are no downsides to wearing one unless you get a mod for it.
---
You think we got a purveyor sale coming ?
---
They need to do this for the audiable perk cards
---
I've got a few that I used to bring up a new character. They are for sale at my camp on the edge of flatwood. Around 250 caps for most weapons, fully modded. Most are level 10, a few level 5 and 20. Got a bunch of armor (5-110) that I am keeping in case I need it for another new build, but I might change my mind if this stuff sells. If you just want to farm leader of the pack has 3 legendaries level 5-10. Or you could just dump a bunch of scrip quality legendaries on the new character and purveryor it. Imagine a 3 star level 10 weapon!
---
"Respec kits coming to the Atom Shop soon, change your point sand perks for 5000 atoms" lol
---
Yep . I’m buying too much lol
---
That’s not very nice Karen. What are caps anyway, they are too easy to get anyway
---
I dunno, candy is pretty OP...
---
People are gullible and it’s just fear mongering. The fact it’s been believed to be legit is hilarious, it’s understandable why mods would hide it
---
Those darn holiday wraps
---
Fair enough
---
No idea tbh
---
Nobody ever buys my stuff so this is be constantly. Always hovering around 2,500. Right I'm at my highest of 4,500 because I finally broke and began selling junk to vendors.
---
ohhh Thank you so much! :D
---
i think i have about 200 caps to my name
---
60 legendaries sitting in my vendor at 20c per scrip
---
It happened to me as well. However I’m totally ok with it, it is so pretty! But I’m sure like with the globe the will fix it soon
---
Your camp looks great, you clearly put alot of time and effort into it!! Thank you so much for the gift!! And happy holidays to you!
---

---
In my world filed with dear hearts and gentle people, I want to think the guy wanted to be a hero more than an achiever :P
---
Yep at low level I'd probably spend time at the morgantown airport including the interior area as you'd probably get at least 2 or 3 santa scorched per trip.  From there cruise over to the train yard, then go to bolton green, then repeat that loop.    
---
As you level up there's other areas that you can loop through in a cycle.    
---
Only interrupt that loop for horde events at op's level and the legendaries will come flooding in.
---
You can get it again through an unmarked quest but have to give it back each time to complete it. It only works (the voices) when on the quest sadly. I've got it atm and been meaning to do the quest to get the carry weight back.
---
If IIRC it was a “PC” post...
---
&amp; dang do I feel bad for the PC folk wit the random NW cheating &amp; what have ya,but again,
---
 if I read it properly,you can/could pretty much “spawn” whatever ya wanted into the world.
---
Hope that helped
---
Ouch. Go sell some more to the vendor bots
---
What would be even better... they added visual effect as Well that would be so cool! Wishful thinking Ahh
---
Or maybe for re-leveling legendary character.
---
There's a new batch of X-mas stuff coming tomorrow.
---
PS4 here.  Occasionally crash when inspecting weapons to repair them (field repair, not bench).  Been since patch 15 (least that's when I first saw the crash)
---
Why don't you search the forum instead of post a shit question EVERYONE else posts 5 times a day. Quit being lazy
---
Done :)
---
vault raid.
---
after weeks of putting it off, i decided, "hey, i'll do a solo novice run to see what i need to do, get some practice in, then maybe go in with a group to farm it!"
---
poor, stupid, foolish, idiotic past me. i didn't even make it to the first objective. my build was all wrong for that place.
---
even if i do figure it out and go with a group, i'll probably be paranoid as hell.
---
It was 400 at launch. You should have more than enough room.
---
😁
---
Done for awhile today guys I gave out 30 gifts msg me later to get on or come see me tomorrow
---
There's several just to the west of you on the large river there. Look up mappalachia on here and look for the resource mode map, it'll tell you all the resource locs
---
now granted, I DID go from a STR PER INT heavy/shotgun/Melee build, to a 1-STR high PER AGI LUCK sneak crit commando. but I was learning lol
---
it's fun.
---
why do things need to be complicated? i know the game mechanically is terrible, but i still enjoy playing it.
---
i dont have anything worth selling that i dont need lol
---
Oh I know. I've seen a bunch of the data mined stuff so I'm really hoping its in there.
---
Simple. By 2076 christmas marketing had edged its way into October. Probly gonna happen IRL
---
only on pc. on consoles, not that much. they're around, but very rare
---
So, I’m 99% positive I have that from last year. 
---
I’m going to have to check and if so start rocking it around Appalachia.
---
Break cards and/or exchange duplicates OR get something in return for them (scrip/caps). I dont even care if its much in return, i just want the duplicates gone and the ability to de-rank cards on occasion.
---
Find the chick getting assaulted and kill her.
---
I am broke, too. But very happy. I got the plasma granate plan today.
---
bit of advice, if you're a 1st member, do scorched hunting on your private world. many places get cleared out frequently.
---
if you're not a 1st member, try to find places with lots of scorched that many people never go to.
---
I hate all the lagoons and hidden lakes in the mire. It's dark as shit and I hate being scared by a mirelurk queen popping out of nowhere.
---
It would help but the sound doesn't seem to play until they're aggro and right next to you. It doesn't play when they're in their petrified state
---
i mean to be fair they probably don't SAY they give you scrip.
---
You mean the unlimited scrap that you get with the monthly subscription? You want it as a 1 time atom purchase?
---
Hell yeah. Glad it worked out for ya. I’m still spending lol
---
Yep. It’s going around! These robot vendors are making a killing!
---
so... Shovel Knight?
---
nope not even close i got \~1600 lbs worth of scrap , i'm carrying half of it on me currently
---
Haaa
---
Me to
---
BTW: I got it from a large handmade gift.
---
ok cool..... I will try this tonight and craft some gifts then open them. being that this works, this kinda defeats killing the scortched and farming gifts from them right? 
---
What do I need to do to make the larger ones?
---
Never gonna happen.   It's a perk for subbing.  Just like ESO's crafting bag, you're not going to ever see it offered as a one-time in-store purchase.  It's just the way things are in MMO's.
---
You should mate. Thing will turn heads..but watch out...other players might mistake you for a scorched. lol
---
 bloodied explosive Gatling gun that I got from the purveyor.....I got one of these a month or so ago. I still have it but never use it as I'm a stealth build. I did'nt know it was a god tier roll.
---
They make a dollar sign $ so you don't have to give ostentatious history lessons
---
I’ve been crafting them like crazy
---
Post your IGN and if you're PC, I'll add you and try to help you out, even if it's just for someone to chat to while running around.  I also highly suggest installing the Text Chat Mod, so you can communicate with the community that way!
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/ 
---
Someone made a nice map of all resources. It helped me find a good spot to camp.
---
I wonder how many caps they have taken in since the start of the holiday stuff. I bet it’s a metric ass ton of caps.
---
Yes just the box.  I don't need that bullshit forward camp or a private server.
---
I want the Chinese assault rifle
---
There's some along the river on the west side of the map, there's a good one across from the Top of the World train station, there's one along the road on the south side of the Whitesprings golf course, and there's one just west of Morgantown next to a train bridge (but still east of the Gorge Junkyard).
---
All of those locations have been pretty good IMO.
---
oh i had the eso crafting bag.
---
For real. It took me 3 tries to do the mission over there to get the shotgun. I couldn’t find the other fuckin turret station for the life of me. That’s place is so hard to navigate even with the mission markers.
---
Yeah gg on new glitches
---
&gt;BLUBLZRedeux
---
is it okay for me to add you? i need weapons
---
Just found out it got deleted. Well, too bad
---
Eat the rich.
---
For sure. Also, I’ll bet the player base will kill more scorched now than during Project Cleanup Appalachia, by a mile. Easily.
---
3 months? You've missed nothing.
---
i'm trying to give them a reason for me to give them my money.  They're just putting out trash items.
---
You said it. Now Beths gonna say we asked for them to be in atom shop!
---
Yup
---
I agree with you. But the others don't.
---
You might need to buy the Plans from Vendors. You might also get them from Treasure Maps, I've got a load of Shadowed, Leaded etc from Maps.
---
Oh no you don't have to &lt;3 it gave me a smile.
---
IGN? How can i get the mod?
---
Oh man for sure. I know I didn’t do my part during that event but have made up for it now
---
I was really hoping for feral ghouls to dive at me with santa hats on.
---
I just started playing again, what is making people broke and why is it worth it?
---
Yeah, when I get a notification that someone has bought up all of my mutation serums for 300 caps each, I know that's what's going on. But what the heck. It doesn't pick my pocket; I got the price I was asking for. If they manage to make a few hundred more caps for their trouble, more power to them.
---
It's a REPLICA!
---
will you be on tonight
---
I’m broke too.  I really hope the 15 Mounted Tick plans I have are worth something... 😐
---
And shoot up too!
---
The unlimited stash is the sole reason people are paying for it monthly. Private servers are boring, but the pop up tent is nice since it's got the scrap box. Seriously though the unlimited stash is the only reason to get fallout first. They will not be letting people access it for free when so many will pay for it.
---
Healthy viewpoint, its unfortunate I haven't found a camp like yours, I feel like everyone has vending machines jammed full of things that are all over 3k caps.
---
Just did the tadpole &amp; possum stuff over the past 2 weeks.  I'm level 161 now.
---
You should be lol. If youre on PSN, I have a bunch for sale as well.
---
Happens to me all the time.  My only fix is to quit the game and restart.  Also, it takes forever to load the bomb location map and half the time, the quest line will read "0/5 bombs located" and then switch to "0/3" once the map loads.
---
Yeah I believe it was in the atom shop last Christmas
---
my condolences... the animation is sooo pretty though... But I want my 1* fodder!
---
Very lkttle
---
No self control oh noooo
---
I've been selling ammo like crazy.  My camp is near some good SScorched spawning locations though, so it could be your camp isn't convenient to where players are at the moment.
---
Just buying holiday wrapping paper to craft into gifts which gives you plans
---
I gave up on mine when I realized that it was either use perks towards melee or shotgun. My TSE railway rifle (prime receiver) takes care of crowds and I never worry about ammo.
---
Lol this must be how they're reading it. The monitization ideas are the voice of the people
---
REALLY... ok... fine... stairway to heaven it is...
---
Yep every night
---
Not even a little lol
---
It's related to [caps sinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink) like fast-travel fees and the 10% tax on player vendor sales.  Normal PvE introduces newly minted caps into the system, so you need something to take them out in order to prevent runaway inflation.  The caps limit is the final stopgap measure to place an upper limit on the total caps in the money supply (at least on a caps-per-character basis).  And, face it, the current system of truncating sales income that would exceed the seller's caps limit is also a major caps sink (which is brutal- I'm certainly not saying that's a GOOD reason for caps limits).  Otherwise, player vending prices would tend to be higher, as sellers would tend to charge what the market will bear, while the market has more disposable caps to spend.
---
I think FO76 in particular has to have the caps limit as a hard backstop, because they don't avail themselves of all the caps sinks other MMOs use.  For example, you don't have to buy tons of materials (on auction with sales taxes or in NPC shops) to craft stacks of useless items in order to get your crafting skills up to useful levels.  Sure, we scrap a few dozen rifles to get all the mods recipes, but not 500 lowbie healing potions to get crafting from 20 to 30 out of 100.   So all the money sinks from sales of crafting materials have a much smaller impact than they would in other MMOs. 
---
That's my Economics 101 understanding of it, anyway.  I don't know if B. has one, but some MMOs actually hire economists to help manage their money supply.  People have done doctoral theses and written books on the topic, as a microcosm of real world economies.  Pretty interesting stuff when you get into it!
---
on a side note, did they remove that "feature" where every time you log in with the excavator power armor you get an extra +100 carry weight ?
---
I really hope not but it sure seems that way.
---
Perfect. You can roleplay as theforbidden lovechild of [Mr Furious and The Shoveler!](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/flx-editorial-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/05172452/Mystery_Men_Anniversary_Rep.jpg)
---
White springs. Vault. Watago outskirts away from spawn points. 
---
Anything central map. 
---
Westek area
---
Avoid bottom map except se, avoid northern areas, avoid the central northern area where you need respirators, like around fire station. 
---
Just go where people want to be naturally. 
---
Central= easier/cheaper on everyone.
---
If you're already in Team chat it can be a bit tedious to switch to Area chat, especially if you're... talking to your team. :)
---
On PC using Discord voice chat solved that problem. Just have chat turned off, set to Area if you want others to hear you, and put it back when you're done. I guess PS4 and Xbox have similar team speak options.
---
When you go to the robot vendors they will sell 3 types of wrapping paper. The high quality paper makes the large presents. If you equip the chemist perk card you can make 2 gifts for every piece of paper you buy.
---
Just curious:  Does Elder Scrolls Online have this level of cheating as well?
---
Just extract gold then sell it at a vendor with your sales perk on.
---
It's not Photoshopped. There's a PC hack behind it.
---
So broke, so happy. Got at least one of every mount on the list santa crashes, icicle lights, extras going in vendor tonight. Selling all low level mounts @ 250c, we will see how it goes. Got most of the rare ones with large handmade gifts.
---
I’m a pro at selling. I just can’t control myself and keep buying those holiday wraps lol.
---
I had a really strange issue yesterday where it wouldn't load one of my characters, it kept dropping me to dt. I was able to get on another guy and grab my shit on a different character, but makes me really nervous about transferring stuff that way.
---
It doesn't exist in the Fallout timeline yet. I believe it's alluded to in the Burrows PC that belonged to the "doctor" there.
---
Jam a Med-X into my neck.
---
Some Psycho into my left arm.
---
Some Calm-X into my right arm.
---
Swallow an entire bottle of Buffout.
---
String an IV of radaway from my backpack.
---
Stab myself in the chest with a Stimpak.
---
Down it all with some Moonshine.
---
Run up to the Legendary Goatman wielding a shotgun, loaded with hopes and prayers.
---
Do I die from the fact that my blood is 90% chemicals or the wounds inflicted by Mr. Goatman?
---
Trick question. I'm too busy tripping balls in the Top of the World Mezzanine.
---
I don’t even know what’s rare or not. Just sitting on them til after the new year when the dust settles.
---
Got 2 from small random gifts.
---
&gt; the blue gift loot bag specifically to do this
---
Hah, I have it for the same reason. My loot bag is the gift one, and my death bag is the pile of gore (which may or may not be to disguise it against people snatching up my bag on death).
---
Not good enough for a PVP game.
---
Some mods can't be learned from scrapping. You might need to buy the plans from a Vendor Bot, find them via Treasure Maps or Event Rewards. If you are scrapping, craft the lighter limbs, it'll still unlock mods for the other types.
---
I really like how the event effects the whole world.  It is game changing and future events should take a note.  
---
The farming this weekend was off the chains... so much legendary loot and many new plans.  Farming feels rewarding.
---
Good to know thank you!!
---
Jet was created pre-war. However, it became more common after the war, and Myron developed a more potent version around 2240, but claimed that he was the creator.
---
Did you read what I said? It’s not possible unless there’s a super secret unknown method. Not one person other than the guy that posted the picture has said anything about being able to get more than 5*. I’ve tried multiple times and once you hit 5 that’s it. Not even one of the people that released the script has been able to go over 5*.
---
I've learned that you make more by selling cheaper things for less. Loads of all types of ammo for 1cap each. Serums for 300. Plans for no more than 500 each. They move quickly and I'm always flush with caps. Aside from these past few days!
---
From what I understand it was invented by a kid in New Reno.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Jet
---
So you're saying you give the gift a good teabagging before handig it over? I bet they're real happy with that smelly bag! ;)
---
Fallout 4 confirmed the presence of pre-war Jet.
---
Blue suitcase though
---
I actually have been testing out different mutation combinations, so if I screw up I need to remove them and reapply them. I grab em when I can find em so thank you
---
Oh good to know.
---
Assualtron Blade works! I've been unlocking those challenges all weekend! One Handed Weapon, done! Bladed Weapon, done! Sword, done! 240 Atoms thanks!! All with the same weapon. Woop!
---
It’s a pre-war drug. Myron claimed to have created it, but he simply made a more potent version and streamlined/simplified the manufacturing process. 
---
Pre-war Jet was confirmed in Fallout 4.
---
Yeah, I just picked the game back up in anticipation of wastlelanders and have been playing w a friend and my camp is basically low level plans for 100-150 and a bunch of ammo all at 1 cap except fusion cells/ 2mm ecp
---
Exactly why I have it, Tent and servers are nice, but if I can one time buy the scrap box I am getting that and dropping my sub.  I really don't care that much about atoms.
---
Though not hearing impaired, I have captions turned on.  If I am near scorched, the holiday one's will have their dialogue say something like "Legendary Scorched:  Not...ussss....", whereas regular would just something like "Scorched Believer: Insides hurt...."  That might help make it easier for you
---
That’s just a feature within the game.
---
I honestly stopped dropping good stuff for people under level... 15-ish. At least I know if they're level 20 or something, they sort of know what they're doing and the gift won't be wasted. Sometimes people have a mic, and then I'll run through a few quests or locations with them, whatever they wanna do, and give them some stims, radaway and water, etc.
---
*’Jet is a highly addictive meta-amphetamine originally created* **before** *the Great War.[1]’*
---
T-60 Power Armor Plans!! The Xmas Gifts are only dropping Raider, T-45 and T-51b Plans.
---
I play 76 and Black Desert Online mostly (with some Monster Hunter on the side). BDO is a very, very large scale MMO, but I've always been a fan of the style of Fallout rather than fantasy settings. The combat in BDO is really what keeps me in it, being its a very action oriented style of combat compared to most other MMOs which are tab targeting and/or global cooldowns. Fallout on the other hand doesn't make it in your face much about it being an MMO style of game, while keeping the ability to play with friends and make new ones very accessible.
---
I definitely agree that the lore is great for 76, and has so many opportunities for expansion as the game progresses and new things are added. And the base customization is definitely a huge bonus. I'm still changing my base up now and then simply because I get bored of where I'm set up and want to check out a new area for it. There's really no other MMOs out there that let you do anything similar to that, at least that I'm aware of.
---
T-60 Power Armor Plans!! The Xmas Gifts are only dropping Raider, T-45 and T-51b Plans. :(
---
Hmm... good point. 
---
That could become very interesting very quickly lol.
---
It’s proliferation didn’t start till some kid figured out how to make it after the war.
---
Well there goes my 6000 caps :)
---
Psycho it is 😁
---
It is on Xbox now and then for sure.
---
What happened
---
Play for 7600 hours to earn 20 atoms. I saw that one and decided not to do them
---
I already had a full heath VATs character running AA. After returning to the game, wanted something new instead of senseless grinding so figured junkies might be the answer since I got some leftover weps
---
In other news, player vending sales dramatically plummet with the influx of dirt poor vaultdwellers   ;)
---
IGN= In Game Name, basically your Bethesda Name.  Go to Nexus Mods for the Fallout 76 modding community, and just keyword search Text Chat Mid.  Good luck!
---
I'm one of those people. The private server is nice for leveling up because you can take workshops and not worry about people contesting them. The pop up tent is nice as a forward base when I'm exploring areas nowhere near my camp and I don't feel like moving my camp but I could do without either of those, if they made the scrap box available in the atom shop this would be my last month subscribing and I would just buy it
---
I don’t remember that being added to the game
---
Why not just look for them...theres tons in the Cranberry
---
This is really evident in Big Bend Tunnel, especially in the archways between tunnels. The only sounds I hear are "Aaaaaargggggggh!!!!" followed by "Ka-blammy!" and "Uuunnnngh." Lol...good times.
---
"Not....Uussssss......"
---
Any power up mission. I can’t ever find the reactor room, I can’t find the control room, etc etc. Just walk in circles for 30 minutes. When I finally find them all and restore the power, they don’t even count for the possum badge.
---
I think so too. Also allows me to use psychobuff during fights. 
---
Gp, fixer, HM and a small lil cultist dagger. Need to find a mmg or a dcg. Duping is rampant here in PC land so hoping I land the melee soon at a reasonable price
---
I do that too
---
I more than agree with you. Some of the people on here think that the game is perfect and hate on any criticism you give it.
---
I wouldn’t say they take lore that seriously if they put the NCR ranger outfit in the game.
---
I did think survival tent was going to have a workbench combo. Example weapon/armor in one or the scrapbox was going to allow us to put weapons into it. Auto scraping them.
---
Lol definitely
---
Are you really arguing that playing a role isn't the defining thing of a Role-playing game?
---
Think about it.
---
Buying Xmas presents for myself lol
---
An army of 1,000,000 level 100 scorched are risen from the dead and wander around killing everything they see.
---
This is a great idea, love it. Beats shooting at my one turret. The thing keeps shooting my spot light hahaha.
---
Close id love a horde event while they rebuild the summerville dam
---
It would simply be relisting it from last year.  Probably a safe bet they will.
---
Would superduper perk help to possibly get more?
---
Rare event, very hard to find it looks like
---
Good to know it's not my internet
---
Im on xbox 1x and it's extremely stuttery and glitchy. Going back to fo4 after playing 76 is crazy. Fo4 runs so much smoother
---
The massively part of  mmorpg isn't as massive as you think. It comes from the days of MUDs when you would gave 24 people playing the game online total. 
---
We are all still interconnected in the world of fallout 76 even if we are limited in people per server in much the same way that all of the mmorpgs you have mentioned split people into instances and zones. We just have to switch servers because our entire world instance is the zone.
---
There is a massive amount of people playing fallout 76, more than some MMORPGS out there.
---
they dont actually have an anti cheat system . not only taht they gave up on geting cheaters. accoring to my source  who is not wrong.. they dont actually care that you cheat lol
---
Brace for downvotes lol... but you are so right.
---
Damm i am dumb but i never heard ING and i didnt know there would be mods for 76 tbh
---
Even had it in FO4.
---
You can buy presents with caps?
---
Well the wrapping paper. Then you can craft your gifts.
---
It's amazing for Lead too. There's also two secret passages.... lemme know if you find them!!
---
Thank you! I have to say I have seen some other fantastic camps around, it's great to be part of a community with such a great imagination 😄
---
any more lever actions? I may try to get on tonight or tomorrow. I bought a skin in the atom shop thinking I had one but was wrong would be nice to be able to use it.
---
I use my build budget up on nearly all my builds 😂
---
I had actually built up on the cliffs that overlooks the area a while back too!
---
Thank you 😄
---
sorry, I hadn't noticed that
---
Lol you cant shut it off but you will get used to it.  Had a camp there and it didnt take very long at all to become immune to it.  Someone was referencing it one day in my camp and I actually said: "What creepy scream?" 🤷‍♂️
---
How is it a cash in?
---
You never know, when Wastelanders eventually drops they may resore some of these places and make them habitable
---
I bought a b25 fixer off a vending machine for 10k... how the f**k would I or anyone know if thats a dupe or just simply a melee guy getting rid of a rifle he had no use for??
---
Not everybody in the whole wide world speaks or writes english and gets on forums like this to trade a red asylum outfit for 500k 556 or sh*t like that.
---
So stop assuming everybody knows every weapons value and who is a duper and who is not.
---
Bethesda needs to reintroduce legacy weapons as rare drops and bump up drop rate for good rolls and remove bashing damage from ranged weapons.
---
As far as I’m concerned they should let us choose the first  ⭐️ of every weapon we buy at the purveyors, then rng the other ones. 
---
Its like they love laughing at us when we scrip 1000 and get 3 nocturnals, 2 hunters, 2 troubleshooter, 2 stalkers and 1 Instigating.
---
Level the playing field. 
---
I wouldnt care if they removed every legendary weapon, energy weapons and stealthboys. 
---
Just bullets and melee.
---
Not at the moment sry but if I pick up any I'll remember you
---
On one of my other characters I had done a build I loved so much that I haven't built again on it!
---
You had an entire free weekend to form your own opinion.
---
thanks
---
Undocumented feature
---
Spawning in dev room items has been a thing for a while. People have been taking thirst zappers, jet recipes, bottlecap mines, etc for months on PC. This latest cheat lets you actually spawn anything in the game files though, not just loot from dev rooms
---
Indeed lol a bit of a fire hazard! Good place for any pets to curl up if we ever get canine companions...
---
Lol it’s ok it had to be said 😂
---
Ooo!!! Nice setup in there!!! 😊
---
Do you mean ore farming? The Excavator gives you quadruple the yield (really only the arms).
---
Yeah, or like the vendortrons found at the train stations.
---
Assaultron blade, guitar sword, machette, shiskabob, Chinese sword all count as swords for challenges but why youd want anything other than a guitar sword is beyond me 😉
---
Cool the more the merrier! I'll brew some drinks to go in my vendor
---
Yep!   I’ve had great luck at AVR medical and Bolton Greens.
---
that.... actually is a good idea. they can make everything really heavy, and then change it to something reasonable once it is available for people. if anything it'll prevent dev room items from spreading further.
---
I did the scorched beast one last two days. Got the crashing noise of being overweight.
---
Sure enough got a Gatling laser and a Gauss rifle. Not sure what else but just missing the reward lists.
---
Scripts came thru too.
---
Wow high praise indeed! Thanks! I recommend the fallout settlements reddit group they have some amazing builds on there too
---
Thanks very much 😄
---
Yeah thats the point of survival games. Making smart decisions on what to take and what to leave. Also unlimited junk inventory is different than unlimited weapon inventory. 
---
They weren't getting wiped out they lost some of it and Bethesda immediately fixed it. Those people ended up gaining more than they lose.
---
This is what bothers me about calling them paid items. I got the scrap bot the moment it came out. With my free atoms. People say I paid to win but I didn't. I bloody earned it.
---
I've made over 7k atoms since the start of September. Spent about 5k though lol
---
I'm not conerned.. my plan is to kill any and all NPCs that aren't protected
---
I have only crafted 20 to 30 presents so far but have never had super duper proc on them.
---
Was it like that b4 the latest patch or has that happened afterwards
---
I don't understand what you mean by "hacking and duping" I haven't ran into that problem for ages. I've been playing since beta.
---
Couldn't agree more
---
i had a blast this weekend, santatron brings me scrap to make bullets with, we met some new friends to do silo run with, lotsa presents all around!
---
I'm studying for my architectural license and it just sorta screamed at me haha.
---
But yes! I hope when the time comes Dogmeat and Catfood will choose to lay by the fire!!
---
Thanks! I will get on this as soon as I get home from work.
---
also make legacy weapons untradeable..
---
Brilliant 👍
---
I need to do this too. I can be on this evening.
---
&gt; You can speedhack by manipulating the fps
---
They fixed that before the game even launched. Its super obvious you never even played the game and all your information on it was from over a year ago.
---
Only had one problem since launch and support cleared my ticket in less then 2 hrs. Let me keep the miss click too.
---
Now if they would get on these NW screen shots and ban some people life would be good.
---
Sounds good! Just hit me up on here when you’re ready!
---
You are the very reason I’m why Bethesda games dont work in multiplayer
---
Legacy weapons are duped to hell and back but they’re not really that bad. An annoyance sure but the economy can survive as they are simply due to the fact there are other good weapons outside of legacy
---
There’s a drop box in a BOS station you deposit them in I can’t remember where it is though. There’s a permanent side quest for it.
---
If they lift it they can’t honestly go back. But in my point of view they should simply lift it anyway.
---
fuck i want it
---
The wiki said something about the BOS, funnily enough 800 hours in its probably the only quest line I’m still yet to do.. maybe it’s time! Thanks :)
---
I'll add you back late tonight
---
Hey, Im assuming you use a Handmade Rifle? Would you be willing to trade that Gatling Ultracite Prime Receiver Plan for a Prime Automatic Handmade Rifle Receiver Plan?
---
If it goes in the atomic shop I'm Gunna want something else just as awesome for my 1st subscription and it is awesome got so much junk I donate quite a bit of it
---
It seems an economic recession is hitting fo76 servers. I recommend lowering interest rates and slashing taxes!
---
Plasma nade and mounted heads people have been asking for since April? Ya horrible...🙄
---
give em away to noobs.  Who cares, really, it's not like scrip was hard to get before this event...
---
I've made it 40 years with all the charisma of a subway rat, I'm not worried about some game.
---
I still have mine, but don't remember how it got into my inventory. The problem is I can't do the Monster Mash event without it (visually) duplicating another one in my inventory. Plus I have to select the right entry to equip the mask. I can't drop it or the visual duplicates either, so its a pain every time I scroll through apparel.
---
What do we get from it?
---
I’m sorry to tell you this but I would just drop them because you can only turn in one at a time and it only works when you get “new” technical data so for the previous 182 you have I would just drop or sell for cheap.
---
To bad it can't be traded or sold at least I don't think
---
No one can buy my bullets on my private server I just use that to get the materials them jump back to public
---
Nah that’s probably me I keep trashing my mutations and then missing them and buying them all again after having Radaway remorse 😂
---
What goodies did you get for em?
---
Oh okay, that’s disappointing I guess, do the sell in a vendor?
---
Normal quest xp and random shit like stims junks armor maybe
---
As a test. I put my chems at only 2 caps each. To see if anyone bought them.
---
Mind you. They sell for far more at NPC vendors.
---
About 120 chems. Stims and Rad meds not withstanding.
---
Conclusion? For a solid week. No one bought them. I watched people at my shop. They barely even looked at the vending machine labeled Chems. A quick glance. And they moved on.
---
I did sell a banjo for 20 caps.
---
Sold some robot chess pieces for 10 caps each.
---
Sold the ammo.
---
Not the fucking chems.
---
Ok so how many caps do I need? I will definitely be stopping by my gamertag is Omzig0816
---
Same here, I only have one mule, and he is walking at a snail pace now.  I think the influx of legendaries is definitely going to effect vendor pricing at camps/quality of merchandise for sure.  Although last night, not sure if someone got a 2 star drop and decided to sell it - but thank you to the vendor that was selling that Bloodied Handmade 2 star (explosive) for 5k.  I was recently cheated out of one of these and I guess karma was on my side to find it.  Most of the drops I have gotten are pure scrip, I'm happy though with my one find at the vendor though.  -Good luck finding the good stuff everyone.
---
I did i gave away a bag filled with 40 and one noob took the whole bag...lol
---
Hacking and duping shouldn't be unless he's on.pc playing nuclear winter
---
Lol i cant get easy to that stuff, so i moved to a junk spot near the place were i farm Christmas scorched, in the process of building my *luxurious* home
---
I think they haven't done that because in the end it'll be damn near impossible with the old engine used but we'll see.
---
Why are people running out of caps? I haven't been playing.
---
You wont be able to deposit them they're bugged you can only activate the quest to deposit them by picking a fresh one up from a container or something, I have two characters with loads of tech data on them the one doesnt get a new quest when I pick a new piece up the other does so I'm not 100% why it works with 1 and not the other if you pick a fresh piece up and the quest doesnt pop you'll have to take all the old pieces off your character and start again
---
Yeah that sucks getting taken, glad u got what u got. I didn't get any good gear only good plans. Thanks for the comment
---
you need serendipity, full stop.  Every non PA bloody build needs this perk, it's just as necessary as nerd rage and adrenal reaction mutation imo.  
---
As for whether or not dodgy is mandatory it depends mostly on your playstyle.  As you have rifleman instead of commando, and you heave sneak maxed, I'm assuming you will be sniping from range in which case you can probably forego dodgy.  
---
Close combat bloody like melee, shotgun, or just non stealth in general will find dodgy more useful.  
---
I have a similar build and I am able to mostly kill enemies from afar before dodgy would become needed.
---
Oh there's no way this could possibly backfire with the rigorous testing this game is known for.
---
I want a Behemoth event / happening.  A horde of them spawn in and just move across the map causing mayhem!  Or anything in a mass horde.  Feral ghouls like in the Glowing Sea (Fo4), Scorched, Death Claws.  Just something uber challenging and destructive.
---
Then if someone hasn't claimed their scrapbox, they wouldn't be able to. I know someone who has his on display, if he ever wanted to scrap his non hacked box he wouldn't be able to.
---
post-apocalyptic world problems.
---
Same. I had no idea until I went to turn something in and it have me the message that I woudont get scrip for it. Damn it.
---
I got a Bloodied Powerfist with 40% power attack and 90% RW. The last is basically a thow away for a powerfist, but i ened up building one of my toons to it and can get about 4k damage with it. It is nice that my main weapon only weighs 2lbs tho.
---
Holiday scorched
---
No they don’t sell to vendors you can sell them in vending machines for 2-10c though.
---
I knew they were hacking NW I'm mean even C.O.D. has hackers it's the nature of playing online with pc. I didn't know people were duping in NW.
---
If the radiation doesn’t kill ya, the cancer will.
---
Or does it revert it because it’s radiation....
---
🤯
---
I keep my prices low. A few hundred caps. But I'll make you an even better deal because we met on here, haha
---
Okay I may aswell just leave them in my vendors I guess thanks :)
---
They add advertisement images for the atom shop all the time and seem to never release like half of it. It gets frustrating when you see something you want get added and never ends up being released. I hope they continue to release more backpack skins and death bags because I think they are cool concept.
---
you get the BOS T-60 paint job plans, seven in total, lots os people probably want those.
---
Yes I’m getting this premise for other people, seems the best idea to just stick them in my vendor cheap! Thanks :)
---
Yeah it’s disappointing but you have a good one.
---
So this is where the BOS paintjobs come from? Ahh that’s nice, didn’t know that!
---
Now that would be an improvement I'm always getting back to the tent drop my scrap and then have to travel back to my camp to scrap the weapons
---
I get scrap from my CAMP already, no gain for many of us. Scrap is easy to come by, even lead.
---
Oh I haven’t done it in it in a long time
---
i was the idiot who made a charisma build early game. i was basically a medic. then my friends stopped playing so i had to respc my special stats into something worthwhile.
---
i hate the idea of respeccing back into charisma cuz of dialogue choices. but i know i'm going to...
---
Ok, I'll probably be on bout 5
---
yes at the point where you inspect begore repairing.
---
 now i just bought something at the legendary vendor - crash
---
Sounds great
---
I'm not sure about this, but I was transferring shit between two accounts and dropped some technical data from a mule and I am pretty sure my main char got the quest activated. this require more testing of course.
---
If your choice of weapon is consudered a heavy weapon, try using power armor and slap on the stabilized perk. You should get another pretty significant boost from the 45% armor penetration
---
Are you on PC? Have you played NW on PC? Also, do you not see all the front post posts, videos and images of hacking and duped items on this sub? How can you see my post but not these? People are using 10 star legendaries ffs.
---
Or stash them incase it ever gets fixed 👍
---
They don’t weigh anything so🤷‍♂️
---
Hacking in NW and yes, duping but in both base game and NW.
---
That’s crazy you have so many, I play a fair amount, just hit 220 and don’t bother running with mules and it’s really just been a minor annoyance from time to time. 
---
Sure some days I was severely overloaded so I get it, but removing it kinda opens the flood gates for farmers to make it easier to dilute the economy.
---
sure is, there are some post on here that goes indepth on how it all works. read that you can only get them in a specifik order (rank) but I dont know. You can probably get a couple of k's for each plan, especially the higher rank plans.
---
Plenty of people do "evil" playthroughs of Bethesda games and it's a perfectly valid playstyle.  
---
But in any event they've already announced a lot of the Wastelanders content will be instanced, meaning this users murder spree will occur in his instances and won't impact yours.  
---
So basically do as thou wilt, they've taken pains to prevent other players from impacting your storyline.
---
After the event the packages will sell for more than they are worth simply for decorating or hunting more plans. It would be foolish to not capitalize on the packages. Especially when you can pay 1700c for a chance at a 40k plan...
---
not even a little.  They always provide ways to get a specific outcome without cha.
---
I’ve been earning almost 10k in one day farming scorched 50% in adventure and 50% private server. I sell ammo and plans (not from event).
---
I’d like to get them initially for the collection tbf so thanks! :)
---
My new characters camp is there. I just tune it out. Lol
---
The presents will sell for more than they are worth even after the event. They can be put on display. Not to mention 60-80% of the plans will sell for way over 1700c
---
Food build much?
---
yeah, and the exp you get for it during double exp events isnt bad either. thats usually when I do this. the 2x exp event just ended today, but there will probably be more. 
---
you also get some semi rare BOS clothing, scientist, engineer and bomber jacket. probably the BOS hood, flight helmet, camo suit and BOS lab coat as well - cant remember exactly which ones.
---
I am on pc and do play nw, the ,10 star weapon is confirmed to be Photoshop, u can hack in 5 star weapon but dupes like shouldn't effect the effect the average player
---
Then after the event they will go for 5k each. Foolish to not stock up on these plans for the next year of play (wastelanders people coming back)
---
You can sell them to the robots for 1 cap.
---
I agree ive wasted about 3 because of this
---
Imagine what the plans will be worth after the event. Sit on the rare ones they will shoot right back up in price
---
I have full Dodgy and Nerd Rage and Serendipity on my other bloodied character for unarmed melee.  I know I can still mix max more but happy with the damage output.  Will think about the Nerd Rage though, might max it out.
---
I use some of my characters as playable mules so armor and perks are to carry stuff.  3 combat spec 2 playable mules.
---
5 star or 10, it's still a problem.
---
just try and find the old post on here before you start, it had some interesting theories which might help you.
---
Oh I didn’t know that thanks!
---
The ‘NCR Ranger’ outfit is simply tactical riot/combat armor and was available to multiple police departments around the country, as well as to the USMC. 
---
The FO76 version doesn’t have any NCR unique markings. It doesn’t break the lore.
---
Holiday gifts
---
Nope. I only have 3-4 charisma in special on all my characters, but I can jack it up to 25+ whenever I want.
---
A bunch of once rare plans.
---
If it's like any other game once you cheat and get everything you could possibly want and more there is no longer any reason to play. So I guess if you still enjoy the game don't cheat, otherwise go ahead.
---
There is a list on here somewhere, but Mothman, gorilla , glowing one, mirelurk hunter and king, radscorpion plus others are rare drops.
---
I’ll have a look into it before I do, now I know it ties into the BOS quest I’ll defiantly do that before getting rid of them :)
---
What is the cap sink??
---
I couldn’t indulge in a free game with parameters because I’m a busy person so I buy games to be able to play when I want and not when Bethesda wants me to 
---
If I had the time though sure that would of helped me form an opinion
---
It shows without a blade when using it too [https://i.imgur.com/b1abhR9.png](https://i.imgur.com/b1abhR9.png)
---
About 3-4 patches with mostly bugfixes in them. A comfy Halloween event and the Christmas event (which is ongoing right now). Also, some stuff like morgantown airport getting a facelift and similar minor stuff. Wastelanders was supposed to be out now, but got delayed to Q1 2020, so there is a bit of a vacuum right now.
---
It happened during the reload glitch never reverted back to the original weight and  doesn’t work for chameleon.
---
I'm not an expert builder but the problem I can see is you can only build so much, even at level 100 I could just barely manage a 3 story building, the third story is a roof
---
3 into Serendipity has saved me many times. Also, like Sly said, invest 3 into Nerd Rage. With full Unyielding armor, you’ll be able to take plenty of hits even below 20%.
---
Not too much - with the double XP I've got a bunch of level ups stored so I can move things around if I need to. But I am interested to see if they plan on changing the way our perks work with the Wastelanders release. It would be a perfect time to introduce new cards and also give us the option to have "decks" for different things like - camp builds vs fight builds so we can quick switch depending on what we need without having to shuffle cards back and forth. I might be too hopeful here but that's ok.
---
Nah I eat Grape Mentats, they're good for your oral hygiene.
---
Wear Unyielding Armor so the NPCs either pity my injured state, or are terrified of my blood stained clothing.
---
Finally my Magnetic Personality and my entourage makes everyone wanna follow my Instagram on their pip-boys.
---
You didnt know that it just had a free weekend didnt you
---
Time for me to craft a bunch of Marine Combat Helmets to sell to the vendors...
---
I have that one too.  Maybe once a week.  Click on the item at the purveyor and when it pulls up the weapon or armor before I can see it blue screen and that ce-blahblahblah number.  Always gives me the weapon etc but really annoying.
---
By the reload glitch do you mean patch 16
---
About 430 I think. Bare in mind my armour reduces weapon and aid weights though. I'm regularly carrying around what should be 600lbs.
---
Have had this happen when setting is set to all friends.  Sometimes it resolves itself after 10+ mins other times we have to full shutdown all Xboxes and our other friends have to reboot their routers.  It’s a steamy pile of billy goat shit..
---
Strongly seconding Serendipity.
---
Run a bloodied rifle build myself and the amount of times it saves me from damage is insane. Even falling damage. Don't leave home without it.
---
They mean the 150 daily limit to from the purveyor
---
I get your concern. However, that’s a common misconception. The NCR didn’t invent the armor. It was in use pre-war by police and military. 
---
It was used extensively by the LAPD, which is why the NCR had access to a large cache of it. But it wasn’t unique to the West Coast at all. Just more prevalent.
---
*almost always. Out of literally hundreds I have not gotten a gift from a jingling Christmas outfitted scorch 4x. Not much to complain about from me. I do wish I could get a few more large presents, so rare for me.
---
FO76 hasn’t broken any lore so far.
---
I have gotten probably 6000 atoms this way since beta maybe more I don't know how many free atomshop things I've gotten. Its alot also just check through all challenges their are alot of easy atoms out there guys
---
You sure? The way he said it sounded like he hits 150 lmit then gets more from dailys
---
Better push out paid subs then.
---
Yes I don’t keep track of the patch names.
---
I bet that people that can build items by racking can change the item's weight.
---
Streamlining the manufacturing process and enhancing its potency isn’t the same thing as ‘inventing’ it, though.
---
The quest is called Forbidden Knowledge. Besides the paints, you can get legendary armor (usually no more than two star), some outfits like the bomber jacket, and the shielded BoS underarmor plan. I've had that plan drop 3 times in 6 tries recently. Doesn't matter whether you've learned it or not, it can keep being given as a reward.
---
Also craft your own. Buy wrapping paper from robovendors, put on chemist perk 2x presents. Gauranteed large for a minimum of 1400c.(+adhesive)
---
you activate it by listening to a tape in their outpost, preservation of technology or something similar. otherwise I think it activates automatically if you carry tech data and progress far enough in the main quest line, probably as you enter the Enclave phase. As I replied to someone else, I think I got an old tech data to trigger the quest when I was moving stuff between two characters, maybe, so just save all you have if this ever gets fixed. As you said; they weigh nothing :-)
---
The level of denial in this sub is unfucking real.  The stash limit wasn't a perk or a feature of the game.  They literally said it was a stability issue and have always maintained that, and then turns out they lied when they monetized unlimited junk stash at $120/yr.  
---
You literally just made up this narrative, one that even Bethesda's own PR wouldn't try to pull on us.  You couldn't be licking their boots any harder and the shit's pathetic.  
---
It's a game where you can even build your own 3 story house.  Yet somehow everything is supposed to fit in 1 box roughly 2.5x the space of your character inventory.  Don't give me this shit.
---
I'm confident there's plenty of budget for what I have planned but thanks.
---
Yeah with my luck I’m sure I don’t have those
---
Who knows what the pre war recipe was. Probably wasn’t Brahmin dung.
---
Travaro4 PSN
---
I thought about this a while ago, so started a new character. I did all Specials at 8, so that Charisma would also be high. Turns out an all 8 character rocks! I'm having more fun then ever, perks are easy to manage, I'm good at everything, but master of nothing and it really works well. So i really hope Charisma comes into play cause I am ready!
---
The holiday wrapping paper in the vendors
---
Even the shooting range that came as part of the Settlement Ambush Kit in the Fallout 4 Creation Club.
---
Perception for the win. I don't plan on romancing anyone, and yeah, alcohol and drugs if I do.
---
I do run stabilized at r3. My build is pretty finely tuned. Just had to move some points around with the new info on demo expert
---
Yes, for 1c each. I use mine when there are just a few caps left to get from them.
---
Depends on what the pre war recipe was. Obviously Brahman weren’t a thing back in the day. So it may have similar e effects, but a totally different manufacturing process.
---
I think the Fallout community might be one of the most polarized in the gaming scene.
---
I'm not really sure what you mean by it goes out of the green circle, because as long as it doesn't go to far I think you should be fine
---
Hey, see what happened here? You can take the word BUG and mix it with the 'thesda part of Bethesda and make Bugthesda. Neato. *Sigh*
---
Take a look here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlhsly/psareminder_the_mount_blair_workshop_has_no_build/
---
One or two places I believe allows for this.
---
Super duper apparently does not work with the gifts but chemist does.
---
The quad ffr has come and gone on Xbox and with how tanky people are getting on Xbox bloodied is the way to go, bloodied ensures that you're hitting for 110 each shot
---
I respeced from rifle man to heavy gunner. I’m level 135 and I’m not done
---
welcome to the wasteland....you be careful out there.
---
I could've written this post. I too got to try it free last weekend and enjoyed my time. I guess it's for people who hate NPCs?
---
My only gripe is the Scorched AI. It didn't seem fair that I can poke shots at them while they're stationary.
---
I read somewhere that there will be NPCs at some point. Is there an opt-out for that or that will just be the reality moving forward?
---
Ah makes sense so I guess lore wise it works out. Thanks for the info!
---
You can only build like 4 floors up, so you have to put the camp on a tree or building so that you can build 4 floors up, and 4 drown from where the camp is. I think 8 floors is the max.
---
Raider for life
---
Why would you need to increase your Perception before an interaction with an NPC?
---
Havent read much about it, do you think there will be dialouge options or do you think it will be dumbed down as in: go and do this quest, get faction points, unlock faction vendor discounts?
---
either way, in the older games many dialouges had more than one option to influence, INT, CHA or... maybe it was skill checks, but I wouldnt be surprised if you could [STR threathen] also.
---
Glass cavern spawns only work sometimes while fissure sites work al the time in our experience.  Scorch beasts are a joke, just easy 1k xp.  
---
 Probably best to do glass if your solo but if you can have 4+ you can’t beat fissure site ultracite spawns and them working consistently.  With 7 ppl we had 20+ Santa spawns in a period of ~20 mins of running a single site.  Just seems like the more people you have the better they get.  I imagine glass works the same but the narrow caverns and if they spawn far away is a pain to track down, but the later half of the level especially by where it starts opening to the SB seems to really stop spawning all together.  Lame for how many veins there are there to harvest. 
---
Also I did scorched horde solo yesterday for 1hr 45mins and got 7 Santa’s before I accidentally 1 hit killed the lvl 60+ leader... -_- didnt seems worth the effort to find the event itself and run it as long as possible.  Maybe it spawns more than just 4 at intervals with more players?
---
I’ve found myself dropping excess legendaries at train stations, kinda like a year ago.
---
The reset timer is 20 hours from your first transaction. I just keep track of when I do my first transition to know when I can go back again.
---
The game wasn't designed around mules. Funny that.
---
Nah, it's a multiplayer game anything worth having or doing will have multiple ways to get or do it
---
Like lockpicking and hacking are right now,nice to have but, not necessary 
---
Plus I'm sure if stat checks become a thing there'll be events that require certain stat checks for all stats......looking at you min maxers that use END as a dump stat
---
Brahmin are just two-headed cows. I doubt their dung is that different from cow dung.
---
The dmv....
---
I'd say that paid subs will give them more cash to hire programmers to make the game better, but...LOL!!  Yeah they're trying to push the company's paper value up so that the investors can get away from this turd with some profit.
---
If I remember correctly, I believe Bethesda said (at the time) that some of these were concept art and not necessarily going to appear in the game.
---
the ability to search the internet was added
---
Alcohol and drugs - always a good substitute for charisma 😄
---
8 stomachs instead of 4. There may be a lot more differences. Modern cows don’t eat irradiated feed.
---
Because you shot back. If you don't shoot back they can't hurt you.

I understand that, but speaking as a quality of life feature it would be nice to have the comfort to know exactly when or not have to constantly plague yourself with mental notes like "Oh I sold this at 10AM.. so I should be good to go at.. 6AM?" every day or every other day. Then you also get into situations where you may have sold one item for some reason and then forget so you lose track of the entire progress.
---
the max damage 1 player can deal to another is 110.  So you either are bloodied and run with less health than that, or it was more than 1 shot and it just happened really fast.  The faster fire rate legendary effect can make it seem like 1 shot for example.  
---
As for destroying your camp, a good weapon like a legacy will wreck camp objects, especially with the perk card that increases damage to camps.  The takeaway lesson would be don't pvp near your camp in the future.  Also, you can potentially move" and then replace your camp without having to rebuild it with materials.
---
This issue with not being friends with the world owner despite you are has been around a lot longer than the latest update &amp; partial rollback, at least on Xbox.
---
there is a height limit.
---
I mean, how can you kill somebody else so easily?
---
Its happening to me on Ps4 as well. Everytime I exit to Big Bend East one of the scorched is invincible and just kinda hanging out. Also, ran by 1 at Camden Park. And inside Riverside Manor. Not always but sometimes. They've been hittin' the egg nog lol.
---
Fuck it I'm done discussing this game. Every single time I say something that is not fuck this game fuck Bethesda or fuck the people who play, I get downvoted to oblivion. I just had 4 upvotes. I'm sick of this subreddit. Those that hate this game so fucking much, why the fuck are you still here?
---
ok, ty for the feedback.
---
Nothing will transfer over, there is no cross play. 
---
But if you need someone to help you start from scratch the Brotherhood of Steel Hellfire Chapter will get you setup. 
---

PM Sentinel Looch for enlistment details (Discord Looch#5729).
---
We’ve moved way off topic. 
---
Myron didn’t invent Jet. He just claimed he did.
---
Something similar can happen to the sledgehammer I think. Honestly I find it hilarious.
---
Not among the worst bugs, anyway.
---
Might have to check out your shop :)
---
Players only have 250 base health before endurance and other health bonuses.  Max damage to another player is 110 so it usually doesn't take more than 3 hits assuming you can hit that max damage amount.
---
Honestly it is such a small issue on console its non existent.  We get dupers and exploiters.  Not nearly as bad but not great either. The hacking tools are PC only.
---
Can you even modify and then *save* weapon or armor legendary effects *to the server*? Given that these 3rd party apps are editing in-game memory, its most likely all on the client side not server side. 
---
If not Bethesda could also add in checks to see if any legendary effects are being changed when they are sent from the client.
---
Yes, BS doesn’t seem like they have it on their list of must fixes so likely no fix for you.
---
Ehh. Pc has cheaters but graphics and FPS is better. Also infinite photo mode captures. Give and take.
---
Kill the sbq A LOT
---
It's a shitty  half-baked experience that is full of hackers that have death auras of all things and they released it at the very tail end of the whole Battle Royale fad instead of working on the actual core issues of FO76.
---
It's the literal definition of a cynical cash-grab.
---
Just let us scrip when we want but only allow how much we can spend. Also, let us trade our scrip as if they were caps or fuzzy tokens lol
---
Build starting up high (using an existing structure) or build a temporary camp and re-place the camp as a new one using your existing camp as a base (so you can place the base higher without having to incorporate existing static structures).
---
I don't believe that placing the new camp within the old green circle keeps your existing structure, but I haven't tried it with a very simple structure.  With even a simple camp building, it eats the old structure and gives you a blank slate, or at least did when I tried it a couple months back.  In fact, when I personally tried placing a new camp within my existing one, it wouldn't let me place it on top of other items I built, so I'm not sure how you'd accomplish things without an existing structure to work off.
---
Well, if I ever get the game on PC, I’ll for sure stop by! Just have some cold Quantum ready :P
---
No. It's the same music, it's just the Christmas context that really brings it home
---
Hey bud, don't take it so personal. I love the game too, that's why I care and I have defended it also. I guess this weekend left me salty. People can disagree, defend, attack the game etc. but don't take upvotes and downvotes so seriously, it'll just get ya down. People troll and try to agitate anyone they disagree with or just because, you're fine - preach away, praise the game; because as an old friend once told me "Don't let the bastards get you down." INHO the more voices in a discussion the better it is, people just need to remain civil, I mean we have a society!
---
Dailies reward 3 to 7 scrip upon completion.  This excludes the scout dailies, Biv, and Camden Park daily.  This is seperate from your daily 150 scrip from the machine.
---
I built an 8 floor tower concept once. Had to place camp on a cliff face tho to have enough space up and down.
---
My ass is going broke with pending on gifts lol.  My caps about to max? Easy fix
---
No, I'm not. I'm arguing that playing a role isn't the ONLY defining thing of a role-playing game.
---
By the time they get to it it'll be January, sorry
---
(BETH PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG)
---
now we're talking in circles and you're just repeating the same thing over and over. sounds like you should just go buy a different game. glhf o/
---
I can use an existing structure but it leads to either the very top or the very bottom falling outside the build area.  Like if I place the camp at the very top of the structure I want to build on top of, the ground is out of the area.  If I place it midway up or on the ground, the top is out of bounds and I can't place the roof.
---
Ah well, I guess I'll just have to keep hunting for a spot.
---
that's not how sarcasm works.
---
That’s a good suggestion, thanks. Especially with heavy auto weapons. I have so many repair kits from events that I don’t repair weapons anyways.
---
I’ll have to stop by! I only have water in my game, but, I figured free water is nice! Gamer tag is TeslaShockTroop
---
But just having a massive number of people playing a game doesn't make it an MMO. If it did, 90% of games would be MMOs.
---
Back at the start of the game I’ve only ever had 4 pretty cancerous encounters back as a. Low level.
---
Same thing happened to me!!! I even sold serums at 99 caps!
---
Thats the stealth blade mod.
---
Damn, been playing since beta and never knew this. Thank you!
---
Find a vein of ultracite which is glitched so you can't pick it up. Kill all the Scorched. Pick it up again. Instant horde event
---
I'm legitimately asking, not trying to be hostile here. How exactly are people going broke from this event? Wrapping Paper yea, but what's the point of making gifts in the first place? Outside of gifting stuff to a few friends, of a few newbies.
---
I havent tried to craft it since that one time but I will try to craft and drop/trade when I get on later. Ill let you know before 9pm e.s.t. what the outcome was.
---
Cheating will always be an issue even with an anti-cheat system. While certainly this game is more vulnerable than others, I find their lack of support overall on the issue to be largely a weighing factor.
---
People cheat in this game because they will there is little to no consequence in their actions. I have been criticized everything I point this out, but when duping/weight glitching was running wild, Bethesda did nothing to stop it until 2-3 months after. People did eventually get "suspended" or actually just banned because almost none of these people got unsuspended. Which is actually kind of bad because while you want to punish people, you don't want people to stop playing. Rather do it via a ladder system like GTA5, DBD, etc. does unless it is something truly malicious ala 3rd party tools. Also because they have no real way to detect who was duping or not, only going off item counts there is still that shred of doubt some people got caught in the cross fire who were otherwise innocent. 
---
Then we have the debacle that is NW. I reported many cheaters who were also known to be cheating in Adventure mode with proof. Many of these people who were obviously cheating would persist for weeks., sometimes months before action is taken.. if any action is taken at all! Most of these people received a 3 day ban and only issued permanent ones if they persisted. Excuse me? What the fuck? You are practically permabanning people for using an exploit you knew about for months, but people maliciously using cheating tools and killing your brand new game mode just get a slap on the wrist? Are you stupid?
---
Got the Plasma Mine from a small gift, before I understood the 2x benefits of the wrapped gifts
---
So it goes. I'm looking forward to the next meta, personally. The tesla meta doesn't really interest me. You can still get good fights a lot of the time, but it's not too long until someone pulls the tesla. Which is fine, but a bit dull. Things could use a shakeup. Just my preference.
---
Nuke whitesprings and farm.
---
First of all, welcome.
---
The 'bad' parts of 76 are mostly technical issues. Bugs, glitches, server issues, performance issues, disconnects, exploits, scams, cheating, lies from Bethesda, etc. And boy oh boy is it bad. It's a mess. When you ask about all the flack this game has gotten, imagine playing it on and off for a year and seeing little to no technical improvements. That's the frustration. The game is terrible, absolutely awful, in this regard.
---
Now when it comes to gameplay, whether or not the game is fun, which is separate from if it's good, that's subjective. Some will enjoy it, some won't, like any game. I enjoy the Bethesda gameplay loop, but the technical problems do very much get in the way of my enjoyment. Glad you're enjoying it so far.
---
Yeah. I find them jingling, 2 stuck inside if each other, completely invisible chasing me and hitting me but I can't kill them, headless, etc....
---
If it also has %90 weight reduction would be nice to just have on you for the bury corpse daily or when Biv wants you to hit a bitch to test your strength. I also use my shovel for the Wise Mothman event and to tag low level Holiday Scorched with this event.
---
Let me guess, to reach these 110 i need legendary weapons, right? Something like double shot, anti armor rifle?
---
Been like that for a few months.  I get an extra weapon from the purveyor like every 3 days thanks to dailies and they give me all the purified water I need for a couple of hour play session. And by a couple of hours I mean like more hours a night than I will admit to because I dont like linear entertainment like TV.  Dailies are a seriously under utilized resource.
---
Oh no they do it popped up for me the Scrip icon and a +25. Same with caps.
---
It's very rare I think
---
I will have to start doing them now, thank you
---
A Fallout without human NPCs, without meaningful choices, without dialogue options and character building, isn't Fallout. As far as we know, there's no opt-out for Wastelanders. Bethesda realized their fuck up and Wastelanders is aiming to be the update that turns 76 around. So long as it comes alongside a mountain of bug fixes, it just might succeed.
---
We both learned something today. I had no idea dailys gave scrip and ive been playing since beta as well
---
Okay thanks, it would be hard to get it, since the sequin dress isn't in the shop
---
Semi-Auto Rifle / Shotgun Crippler build here! Loving my Instigating Lever Action Rifle for low-level areas, great for one shotting! Slap on my AAE Handmade for harder mobs. Also love my Laser Rifles and Plasma Flamers, but they do need a lot of care! ;)
---
Do you have speed demon by any chance my friend is wanting to get it.
---
Content
---
I don't really think you can get around that at all
---
I like the idea however the game gives random rolls and I'm pretty sure somebody who gets a legitimate weapon (E.g. a 2* TSE handmade) will be indistinguishable from somebody who dupped it. They'll end up doing people from accessing legitimate weapons, and it'll be a disaster.
---
I'm with you, 100%. 76 is a good game with horrific press and in desperate need of a QA pass.
---
What are you spending caps on? Specifically.
---
Just coal, fertilizer and junk
---
Gifts you buy for yourself or for other players?
---
Fisto
---
It was nothing you've said. I have yet to have a civil discussion about this game. My wife and my old childhood friend who lives halfway across the country are the only people who I have had a good conversation with. My wife avoids talking about this game to other people in general.
---
Will do! That reminds me; Bethesda can we have the fridge eventually turn drinks into Ice Cold versions...?
---
Honestly this game just needs a full respec option. Reallocate all our points and re-choose all out perk cards. Even if it's an Atom shop item, which it shouldn't be. But let's face it, it's Bethesda. Either way, the game just needs it.
---
Basically makes the request moot!
---
Stock up on Berry Mentats, Brain Fungus Soup, and Cranberry Relish, get Well Rested, play in a team for Inspirational, then go to locations that are densely packed with enemies and kill everything.
---
Glad you enjoy it! We need more people. I actually think I saw you one day, because I remember thinking your name reminded me of the game “They Are Billions”
---
Stay well rested for the 5% bonus. Cranberry cobbler or leadership bobbleheads help getting experience while running solo. Inspirational is the best xp bonus if available
---
Sadly, it’s in the Atom Shop.... (But yeah, lore for my character, Ripley, she has a massive addiction to Quantum~)
---
I had 6 of them built at workshops for several hours yesterday and didn't get a single gift.
---
Like it 😋
---
A proper anticheat
---
I'm just through the trees and down the cliff near you, by the cave. Definitely agree, around Pleasant Valley is always a good spot for traffic, really good mix of levels. Sometimes a few camps all down the road from each other too!
---
76 uses the FO4 drug system and in that game Jet had a slow time effect. That can't work in a multiplayer title.
---
Just a shot-in-the-dark, but did you check your CAMP device to make sure it wasn't damaged to the point of despawning, and needed repairing?
---
I find the AS really weird in that aspect. When people first asked for a reskin of the loot bag they all talked about a vault tec lunch box one, but so far nothing yet, while that was always mentioned when someone suggested it. 
---
I understand that a sloth backpack would need more development time than a retexture, I don't get why they don't release these. There are at least three in there I wouldn't mind getting.
---
Definitely repairing my armor a lot more now. Going through the silo I’ve been breaking at least 3 pieces of armor before I get through it all.
---
&gt; without meaningful choices 
---
The fact all choices can be done without any ill effect means there are no meaningful choices in any fallout game. 
---
&gt; nd character building 
---
You can build your character though actions and behavior. There is a reason actions speak louder then words is a common saying.
---
It seems to me like both my armor and melee weapon are deteriorating much more quickly lately. I’ve had to repair my DCG twice now.
---
Yes i know but an extra here and there would be nice
---
Just scrap it and hopefully learn a mod for the handmade
---
I second this..... all of it!
---
Let me explain what happened. I have a foundation with only a wall on the east side. I place a wall on the north side. Suddenly the east wall disappears. It has no tangible hit box as anything and anyone can walk through it, however it still exists in place meaning nothing else can be placed there. I managed to fix it by server hopping
---
The highest build ceiling if I recall was when a clanmate and I tested at Poseidon Power Plant, getting 14 tiles high before it stopped us from building any taller.  Personal camp limits are very likely much smaller.
---
He’s on Pc
---
Be grateful.  My gf only gets coal and fertilizer from Santatron.  Not even joking.  Last night she had 7 coal and 3 fertilizer upon returning from scorched hunting.  Funny as hell listening to her cuss that robot out.
---
There's actually a bot that sells most flavors of Nuka Cola in the Whitesprings.
---
I haven’t received any either. I guess I’m not the only one!
---
See that's what's weird.  I have *never* heard the bells everyone talks about.  So maybe I should get my hearing checked after all.
---
I downloaded it through the Bethesdda Launcher, and can't see any other versions available.  [https://i.imgur.com/hWcN1y8.png](https://i.imgur.com/hWcN1y8.png)   
---
I'll re-install the game and see if that solves it
---
Have you tried unplugging and then plugging it back in?
---
Thought exercise: Allowing caps to be spent to reset the timer earlier.
---
This goes with the earlier discussions of Beth finally finding at least a limited time cap sink
---
I'm aware. I can see the mouse
---
Had it happen to me the other day. I pressed the Xbox button. Selected games and apps “Refresh” popped up, Refreshed. Sorted the problem. 
---
Could be fluke, could be a solution.
---
I've been using a vampires weapon and it usually keeps me stocked up but only if it has a fast fire rate like the light machine gun
---
Stash them first.  Turn them in one at a time at Camp Venture for the Forbidden Knowledge repeatable quest (gainable for the first time at Fort Defiance).  Each turn in gives some small goodies, and a random chance at a uncommon-to-rare Brotherhood of Steel plan.
---
The handmade gifts have a higher chance for the rare plans than the gifts you get off the holiday scorched.
---
I think the ability to build a settlement with your team would have been nice. I think it would have to be separate from your camp just due to the fact if you're both not online then something would be missing. Just a way for us to be able to build more than a a small house.
---
First off its not junk, its scrap. Meaning its all core components. So there is a difference between scrap items having a higher number next to them and 859 different weapons laying about. It'll put a much higher strain on the server. 
---
&gt; Yet somehow everything is supposed to fit in 1 box roughly 2.5x the space of your character inventory.
---
What are you even bitching about here? That its not realistic? You're crying just for the sake of crying.
---
Ability to become a ghoul or super mutant. Much the same way ESO allows you to become a vampire or werewolf. With some way to remove the effect but with the restriction that you have to wait 24 hours or sonething real time if you want to get it again. 
---
Ghouls would give you a huge boost to agility with a penalty to strength or endurance. Rads heal you and ghouls no longer attack on sight. Ability to do rad damage to opponents but reduced damage against other ghouls.
---
Super Mutants would work much the same way. Huge boost to strength but a penalty to intelligence. Rad resistance and super mutants no longer attack on sight. Buff in damage against other creatures but a penalty against other super mutants.
---
I think it could all balance out nicely if tweaked just right.
---
Dual-box.
---
Yeah I just put them in containers for others to use or scrap.
---
I prefer blocker than Dodgy for bloodied. I use Dodgy on tanks to cancel the remaining damage reduced by % reduction, and DR.
---
I use lone wanderer for the 20% reduction, then Blocker for melee damage and troubleshooter/mutant slayer/zealot for ranged. Third is optional since most scorched go melee (Blocker), m79 or shotgun (low damage at range), and SB do explosive damage at range, so fireproof deal with that. Nerd rage and serendipity are here in case of bad shit, but serendipity is not mendatory to me in a full health tank build.
---
You just missed double XP weekend. Leveled up every time I turned around it felt like. But normally farming west tek or whitesprings are good places to start. The glassed caverns as well - you can go in as a team and do a run thru and then go back around and pick up the ultracite to spawn more scorched for even more xp.
---
I always get a present if they are jingling.  I’ve only received a few large gifts.
---
NPCs
---
If you have a friend or team mate in the server - sometimes it lets me open the map and respawn on them. Doesn't always work but worth a try.
---
😂 It's a ready made line lol
---
Ooo which one!?
---
You'd understand it if you took your lips off Bethesda's boots for even 2 seconds.  Holy shit guy.
---
The only thing that’s been selling for me lately are ammo and maps.
---
Next time someone attacks you at your camp while building box them in with walls and a roof while on passive.  If they FT away and come back do it again until they stop coming back.  75% of the time this works every time.
---
I’ll be on in a bit, eating dinner atm
---
To be fair there isn't much to buy once you get your unicorn weapon they nerfed the limit too hard when they could've just limited the trade prices
---
She's upstairs - there's like a little room that's a nuka cola shop. I did a quick search and these directions might help you better to find her than I can - I just wander until I find her. 
---
"Fast Travel to Whitesprings Resort and enter, go up the stairs and when you see the chandelier turn right and head down the corridors, when you come to the ballroom go to the left into the room with checkered floors for the Nuka Cola bot"
---
Yeah I've noticed this too
---
thanks so it is, only been back a month so it's new to me
---
Don't forget to equip the chemist perk so you get 2X gifts when you craft them instead of 1...
---
Most people that complain on YouTube haven't even played the game they just hash up other people's footage for views from the Bethesda hate train. 
---
That and loot here videos are why I don't even bother with games on YouTube except for lets plays
---
Vaults to explore
---
My weapons are fine, but that's probably because I run with gun nut rank 3 or 4, but my armor isn't weak even though it's mostly standard with deep pocketed
---
Yes. I miss the shit shack walls and the blanket ceilings and the porch(?) style walls that had like railings?
---
This game is a Saint compared to gta online who is the devil.
---
Beat me to it.  This person does nothing but moan.
---
I would honestly love that so i could test out weapons
---
Nothing about this game makes me scared.
---
More players = more stutter
---
Thanks!!! Gonna check it out when I'm home!!
---
Go automatic rifles (commando) for armor go either assassin sentinal (PvP) or unyeilding sentinal or vanguard sentinal depending on if your using Bloodied or junkies/anti armor
---
That was a seperate image with a concept sketch. These designs were all added to the game files with the patch when Ever Upwards was released
---
I knew it. Something just didn’t add up.
---
That or the only option to respawn is at 76.
---
I'm probably good either way. If I want tons of NPC dialogue and other "meaningful" choices I can always fire up the other Fallouts (I've played 3, 4, and currently going through New Vegas). If I want a silent mode Fallout then 76 seems to be it :P
---
no one is gonna mention the anti-material rifle from new Vegas!
---
Min-Max is not mandatory in a predominantly PVE game.
---
I think there is a downvote bot that just auto downvotes every post
---
Also considering how much I played 4 all armor is significantly less useful in 76
---
Sometimes I feel like bethesda's MTX team isnt reading the feed back in the datamine threads. A lot of people will comment wanting certain items the most, and then those items turn out to be the longest wait if they ever get released. A good example being that people kept asking for handmade skins and it took months
---
So do ppl have to make sure they're on your server?
---
I absolutely love this! Ive built many times but never was 100% content with my builds because of seeing posts like this. I am creative but I get frustrated with the camp budget limiting my creativity. I am currently in love with my new place built next to a lake just north of flatwoods. I love your Pub!
---
No worries and thank you, I have already have both prime mods for my handmade👍🏻
---
Yes you would have to search for me by gamertag and join my server I might be on a little later I'll post if I am but normally it will be 10am est to 2pm est everyday I can baring any issues
---
Check my profile? Maybe I got something :)
---
No wonder it had a free trial 🤣
---
People will still buy them in hopes they work after trading again.
---
I'm not a hardcore NW player by any means, but this weekend was the first time I ran into hackers. It's stupid when you need to stop queing for five minutes so you don't end up in the same lobby as the last hacker.
---
I also got teamed WITH a group of 3 hackers, which was a weird experience. Easiest, fastest 1st place finish ever but I had to go take a shower afterwards due to feeling so gross. Watching them teleport all over the place and the death tool pile up... Never even picked up a gun, just crouched in a bush the whole 4 minutes.
---
Hmm
---
And don't let 25% fire rate roll on a black powder rifle if they aren't going to let quad roll on a black powder rifle.
---
I wouldn’t say that is accurate. My alt has just started turning his in daily. He amassed a little over a hundred and now every time he logs in, he has the quest marked for turning in tech data even though I haven’t picked up any new ones in a while. I’ve turned in a dozen just yesterday.
---
I wish I could have some more time to play, I had an important test. I liked the few hours I played, I reached level 8 and now I don't know if I should buy it. Also, my Internet connection is so bad. My ping is so high until 2 am.
---
Decisions, decisions.
---
I was thinking the muties would make more sense this weekend too, but I'm kinda glad they did scorched. At the level my characters are right now I spend the vast majority of my time hunting super mutants (and ghouls) for legendary gear so it was nice to switch it to for a bit. Before this event I would usually ignore 80% of the scorched I encountered.
---
My auto correct has decided it's the true spelling these days ;)
---
Should go check the Market sub - people sell over there all the time. I would also look at player vendors too because sometimes I find good things in them for cheap. You never know what you'll find.
---
A text chat of some kind.
---
Me too!
---
Sex. No, bent over a barrel doesn't count, Todd...
---
I’ve noticed that I am repairing my handmade more often since last patch.  There is a noticeable change in their deterioration.
---
People believed something on the internet and overreacted, without having any factual evidence to support their reaction??
---
Surely you jest!
---
Damage resistance is a strangely calculated stat. Just try searching how to maximize it. Even with over 800 ballistic damage resistance, level 1 scorched with a pipe pistol can still hurt me somehow. According to the numbers my health should not drop at all and yet it does anyway.
---
Thanks so much! If you need any help with building stuff I'd be glad to help out 😄👍 a few things I've learned include; minimize floor space and try to stick to one or two floors maximum, as floors and walls eat budget (as do turrets, my camp has no defences!), get the basic theme sorted before you go for detail, for instance build the things you want to build later and store them, so you know how much budget you'll have left.
---
 Not really, but then I don't stand around in the rain. You get wet like that. ;)
---
The Mire.
---
The western/southern fringe of it is cool; a little swampy, but you can still get around okay. But the central part? Man - that place is eerie and claustrophobic.
---
That was my favorite part!
---
World is full, good luck
---
What’s the purpose of this post?
---
 That was weird alright.
---
Absolutely, I never bother killing scorched outside of an event. It's a waste of ammo.... But with the double ex and constant legendarys...... Its been a great weekend..
---
Will still enjoy hunting them though for the presents.
---
Just upgraded my combat pieces to brotherhood, but before the patch lower level enemies can't touch me
---
Hahah, wow. GG WP.
---
Do you use gun nut
---
Was wanting to see if anyone can out weigh the pros from the cons about this game
---
I use Photoshop for a living, and I gotta say...well done! You matched the font perfectly, and expertly stamped out the wording on the original gun's legendary attributes. A++
---
they were added purely to increase carry weight earlier on, i think. they must have decided that the tadpole quest was a tad too hard for early players but they wanted to give them SOMETHING. hence why it's in the overseer's box at Morgantown airport, where any new player following the main quest will get to by the time they're level 10.
---
though you are right, they should allow atom shop skins to use the small backpack. it's just a cosmetic change, what's the harm?
---
A**hole I know its from last year. Doesn't mean it wouldn't be nice for them to bring it back tomorrow for those that didn't get it or weren't around back then. Being a d**k for no reason....real classy mate.
---
5 stars are being spread around. It's not possible for the existing tool to go past the 5 because that would involve editing the esm.
---
Proof it was photoshopped: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eblnec/no_the_10_star_legendary_is_not_real/
---
Yeee but u have to price fairly. Sold all kinds of things!
---
To me that sounds like it's just the bug from when they attempted to fix goo and ash piles. If that's the case it means that somebody went through with a plasma/laser/Tesla weapon, this will/can cause enemies to spawn naked/headless/invincible/stationary/teleporting around.
---
I've had 4 going at once and also nothing
---
If your not going to buy the game after playing then there is no point convincing you. I hate post like this
---

You played it - and you said you were hooked so I don't see where the disconnect is here. Buy it or don't - it's not up to us to decide if this game will be fun for you or not. It's fun to us - which is why most of us still play. The NPCs are coming soon if that's something you're missing. Other than that - there's tons of posts asking this same question if you'd scroll a little.
---
lol we knew it was fake. We just used it to troll ourselves
---
Thank you so much. I haven't taken any pictures of my most recent camp placement. But when I do I'll be sure to post. I've been actually getting DMs after fellow vault dwellers come and check out my place and leave. I gave one guy a bunch of food when he showed up. He DMd me... saying... I love your place! However your food gave me worms LOL! #Worthit. 😂😂😂
---
I was drinking some of those last night while playing fo76 🤣
---
You didn't check the silo holotape to see if the silo was viable in the server you hopped to?
---
Cool guy gotta say I don’t use twitch prime I stream YT But I make my own money so I buy atoms
---
Does Super Duper work too?
---
I never hear them either.
---
Nah dude you just gotta craft a 9 locos (four locos + 5 hour energy)
---
facts! the original 4 lokos would have you on your ass hahaha
---
Build area is based I think on initial camp placement, moving the Camp object around after it has been placed, doesn't move the build area. Have to fully move the camp.
---
Following most of the other comments, placing your camp higher is the way to go. placing it up in a tree, edge of a cliff, power tower, etc will let you build higher. I haven't gone to extreme limit, but was able to build a 6 story lookout tower just w/a tree placement
---
Yeah I played a bit but I couldn’t play long I was at a family outing for two days which sucked.
---
And thank you!
---
If you’re considering buying the game, you’re the only one who can make that choice. 
---
You tried it for a week free right? If you like it, you should consider getting it if money isn’t an issue. If you didn’t like it, don’t get it. 
---
Not trying to be condescending, but only you can make up your mind.
---
It happens when the wife and kids all start watching baby Yoda meme videos on 8 different devices off the same Wi-Fi.
---
Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.
---
Welcome to Fallout 76
---
Lmfao that's good but I feel like 4 locos had like 500mgs plus of caffeine
---
username checks out LOLOL j/k
---
WANT!
---
I don't stream anything. It is included in my amazon prime membership and I was happy to claim the stuff 👍
---
Still have your explosive laser pistol? May be worth trading.
---
Haha great stuff. He should have remembered, 'if in doubt, boil it out!' #pioneerscouts 😆
---
Morgantown Airport Arrivals/Departures. I circumnavigate the whole building to get in and end up fast travelling to get out.
---
Ah yeah I got dragged out for family time this weekend too. Mandatory christmas lights family time lol but good luck leveling out there man!
---
Aha kinda similar for me, and thanks again!
---
just toys, shit and coal
---
Definitely not the wifi, I'm usually watching videos when I'm playing and don't have any lag
---
Under, "There's a SUCKER born every minute". Good luck
---
Haha I think it's too late to upvote to make this happen this year but maybe next year. I know a lot of people have been hoping for snow to come to Appalachia. Someone suggested a snow machine for your camp - I think that could be doable lol
---
I would have put up the Atom Shop cutouts at trainstations so people can access the atom shop easier.
---
Exactly!!!! In a real nuclear apocalypse there'd definitely be snow and a temperature drop.
---
I thought Bethesda had nice customer support too but later found out that people abused it by buying a bunch of items they wanted then refunded them all and got the atoms back while keeping the items, turns out it’s just easier to let you keep the items rather than trying to pull them out of your inventory and stash and risk breaking their characters or losing items, yeah you see a few people thank them for swift refunds but there’s a lot more people complaining about unfair bans and actual cheaters going unpunished, then there was that controversy about banning the player who used cheat systems to find bugs and report them then only got unbanned after the entire community was fighting for the guy
---
You did not waste a keycard. The next time you try to launch from that silo you will hear an error sound when you attempt to put in your card, at this point just go to the keypad and enter the code to launch.
---
Does it show cooldown periods?
---
It shows how much time is left on a cool down so, yes
---
Angry upvote.
---
Right! Hopefully they bring it out of the vault tomorrow from last years stuff.
---
They used to be higher amounts when it released then got dropped significantly. I still find it hilarious that the challenge spend 7600 hours in Appalachia" or w.e has the rewards of 20 or 40 atoms?
---
Yes.  I main a bloodied build so I tend to glass cannon anyway but now Im getting one shot by lv1  scorched.  I did add polymer mods to 3 pieces of scout armor last weekend but no other changes in loadout.  
---
My armor is definitely wearing out way faster since the update.  Weapons seem to be about the same.
---
People bought up like crazy at my vendor last night (first night playing in two weeks).
---
All of my bulk junk (plastic, adhesive,copper, cloth, lead steel) was all bought by one person.
---
Then another person bought a bunch of legendaries (unyielding armour) and another person bought a few legendary weapons (bloody).
---
So I made like 20k caps last night.
---
Same, I’ll be heading to you when I’m off of work
---
Personally, I really didn't like the market back when duping wasn't as common. True, things were a bit more stable, but getting any God-tier weapon were next to impossible. Getting the one item you want from a world drop was about a one in a million chance. Now true, you could trade, but were really willing to trade for anything but the item they were looking for.  I get that it isn't supposed to be easy, but still. 
---
I've played this game for several hundred hours now, and I think I've only gotten a God drop once, maybe twice. It's simply too much grind for my taste. I'd describe it as "The game where I've spent the most time trying to progress and not having fun". 
---
Now, I like trading once in a while, but sitting and following countless of discord servers, subrwddits and other pages to see if anyone is trading the thing I'm looking for, for my items, ehh,not so fun. 
---
Anyway. This is just my opinion, so it doesn't really matter. I could be wrong I suppose. Just wanted to chime in ^-^
---
The whole state is doable for snow!!! We could so set it up for next year or hell a mid Winter event this year, we could still get the Yetis and hell make Arctic mega sloths too they can yeet ice rocks
---
Oh
---
Tyr did a video that showed how to do it- I think you have to be in a group for it to work properly. I tried it solo and it didn't work but I grouped with 1 friend and it worked. you gotta run thru and clear it out - kill the scorchbeast and then go back to the start and pick the ultracite one at a time to spawn more. That's what worked for us. Got a ton of XP and holiday scorched.
---
I whacked a dude at the SBQ wearing one from last year. Or at least that's what I think I saw. Not a good choice at an event where blue suit scorched can spawn.
---
Well I don't see why others with duped items would affect you unless you planned to only pvp
---
Almost paid for itself
---
lolol...nice! They'll be safer to wear after the 1st
---
Yep I’ve gotten 25, 50, and 1k!
---
Christmas in July could be a thing
---
My bloodied build has been getting one hit by level 1 scorched and liberators.
---
Seems kinda of odd since I can usually survive hits from level 68 ghouls.
---
500 is the most I got
---
Any chance you would be on later in the day? I'm usually asleep during those times and I'd like to see the camp
---
You learn something new everyday. I still think the concept is stupid though. Considering how low the drop rate is for calibrated shocks.
---
Ah ok well imma have to go to sute Aplha and try that
---
I've been fine
---
I have a 3 star shovel that I keep around just because it's 90% less weight.  Pretty much just for corpse burying.
---
It’s West Virginia in October.... probably not a lot of snow unfortunately.
---
I'm not sure why building the entire game from scratch would help combat cheating
---
Upload it to imgur and then post a link, this post isn’t very helpful if all you say is that you “found a visual bug”.
---
I agree but on the other hand there are arbitrary restrictions on storage and currency
---
Twitch Prime is a free service for having Amazon Prime - it gives you a free sub every month to 1 streamer and of course Twitch loot like this. So you could potentially get the Twitch loot by getting a month of free prime from amazon and linking it to your twitch account. You don't have to stream to get this.
---
Where do you buy the paper from? I had no idea about this I thought they just dropped from Xmas scorched!
---
A mini turret is equal to like 25 wall pieces i swear. Defenses cost big budget amounts.
---
they do work but its alot more work, insanely more work, also since in most cases you need a flashed console you gonna get autobanned by the online network these consoles run i guess
---
Basiclly Cost and Time is too high to cheat or hack on Console for minimal Use
---
on Pc everything is kinda simpler, IP Ban=just modem restart, Game Ban just buy a cheap Key for 2€ from a shady website like g2a
---
Check the vendor bots. It’s under The misc tab
---
See below for lots of details, but here's one way we found to re-activate the quest-   
---
Sell them to your friends using your vending machine. Whoever buys the tech data gets the quest re-activated. 
---
You can GIVE someone a tech data, then have them sell it to you in their vending machine as well. Do it one at a time. No point in "selling" them in bulk.   
---
Reminder- You can set the price of a vending machine item to zero. 
---
Good hunting.
---
Consoles are safe (for now). PC is a shit show currently
---
I just heard (on the radio, oddly) that the latest patch broke legendary gear; reloading your weapons causes the damage stat to plummet. This can be fixed by re-equipping the gear.
---
I actually don't play this game but I thought it was funny and came here to see what people were saying about it. That's probably what's causing this.
---
Yeah its random from 25 to 1000. I got lucky and got 1k once too
---
Just sleep and kill everything. With the holiday event, I just start up at Berkeley go down through Harpers Ferry, Valley Galleria, hit the fissure sites, loot the ultracite ore around it as it seems to spawn more scorched, Camp Venture, Glassed Caverns, couple fissures otw over to Big Bend Tunnel and if you need a break do Collision Course and that morgantown scorched area (or dont because it's not great XP) and then start over.
---
How did you end up broke?
---
I bought a lot of holiday gift wraps.
---
I haven't been on in a while, but I'm going to add you so I can check out your stuff. My tag is Broken Vader. Xbox, obviously.
---
So you get this vault tec paint with twitch prime
---
I'll be on at 7pm est tonight utill 8:30
---
Ok I'll try to catch you then thanks (:
---
You forgot the quotes around "bugfixes".
---
Vending will come back when everyone unlocks the plans they’re looking for, and at this rate that’s going to be pretty quick.
---
Ok. It’s mostly just scrip stuff and cheap plans. Always 25c for any plan and 20-25c per scrip.
---
I pvp once in a while with an AA handmade. Power armour users go down quick. All the have is their base damage, all the legendary attributes go out the window. And lots of perk cards don’t work in PA. Only use it in radiation zones.....
---
500 is coming from the medium gifts, 1000 is coming from the large.
---
What platform?
---
I trade stuff on the market subreddit and finding stuff that people are selling and have no clue what it is worth. Found a Quad, Faster Firerate, 25% less vats cost for 1,200 caps. People pay over 100k for something like this.
---
😂😂😂I did ask him.... Did you cook it first?! Hahaha
---
Yep it's the free loot. I haven't claimed it right now because I don't have prime so I can't walk you thru that part but it should tell you how to claim it on twitch :)
---
You were 🙌
---
You can get various amount of scrip from them too
---
This is the way.
---
I'm pretty sure the recipe is in the frat house NE from Morgantown high school
---
Wait- really?  How do you claim it or find out more about it?
---
I'll be on at 7pm est to 8:30pm est
---
Seems a little low. It should vary 500-2000 that way you actually get your caps back on the best ones other wise it just seems like your trading 1400 caps for 1k... Unless you get the 1k and a plan or something. (I have been saving all mine so have no idea what drops are like. I opened about 10 smalls though and got a plasma grenade so if I got coal in every other I would be happy with the world spawns.)
---
Done
---
As if this wasn't thee most asked for thing all last year.
---
They weigh Zero so I'm holding onto them just in case there's a fix or another bug which will make them work again!
---
Yeah, personally I love green thumb, but it's so frustrating getting to the point of having to use Thru-Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy because I hoard chems and purified water to dilute etc etc. I have an angry purging phase every 2 or 3 months lol
---
Robots&gt;super mutants&gt;feral ghouls&gt;scorched for exp. Of course they need to be highest lvl. Farming scorched can still be sweet if you go to fissures and kill multiple scorchbeast. 
---
I sleep, eat l leader bobble, eat cranberry relish, eat scorchbeast brain,  take mentats, perk or share inspirational 3 and then go hunting.
---
Contact support.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll give the unyielding a try.
---
They should have made it a simple global 24 hours reset timer like most other online games that have vendors with limited stock. Just have it reset at the same time as the daily challenges do, and no one would have to remember whether or not it's been 20 hours since their last transaction.
---
Others have said this a different way, but it may be helpful to think of the building area not as a circle, but as a Sphere or Globe/Ball with the camp machine in the dead center. So in order to build "taller" you have to have your initial camp device placement "up in the air". You might look for some of the sites with Cliff-side Billboards, and try to drop the camp machine on TOP of the billboard, or go to one of the houses/buildings in Charleston or near the Fire Department where it lets you drop a camp unit on the roof of the houses.  (can't get up there? Try blueprinting a straight staircase with multiple levels to get you into position, then MOVE your camp unit once you are up). 
---
Once the building has started, moving the camp unit (i.e. selecting and dragging it) does not affect the location or boundaries of the build-able area. Using the "move camp" function stores all existing structures so you can place them back down if area is correct size/shape. You may also want to test your fast travel location BEFORE beginning to build in a spot to ensure you aren't dropping off a cliff when you spawn. (This requires a friend, as the location for camp owner spawn is different than the spawn location for visitors).
---
I've been using the lvl 5 Gunsmith perk, is this really needed?
---
Whenever I run it I do any private server so it might be different on a public server since a player may have ran through there before you.
---
I run it solo all the time. For the most part I can get the spawns to happen throughout the entire cavern until the big area with the scorge beast.  That's when they stop appearing for me.
---
Although like you stated sometimes something happens and they stop appearing altogether before the big room no matter how many ultrasite i mine..
---
 Actually just ran it's about 10 minutes ago and got 7 santa scorched from the one run. Best spot in my opinion. 
---
Then I got 3 from Berkeley Springs, 3 from Harper's ferry, 4 at wavy Willard's, 2 at Camden park and 2 from gallaria.
---
 Was a good little run before logging out.
---
If you want to do good in both PVP and PVE, you should get Junkies weapons. 
---
Perks doesn't really matter for Junkies, just make sure you get rid of most non-combat perks.
---
Someone in the studios right now is evaluating this report and marking it as "Not worth the 10 new bugs it will introduce"
---
Can you share how they fixed it?
---
Submitted my ticket, but close to 24 hours I still haven't receive a response.
---
What you just said is articulate, it is intelligent and it is logical.
---
Automatic weapons (commando) are more versatile - especially for PVP.
---
For VATS - automatic receiver (+aligned barrel +aligned stock) significantly decrease the AP required per shot (approx 70%).  It lets you spam shots with VATS benefits like you couldn’t in semi-auto mode.  The overall DPS is significantly better.  Also, you still one-shot most mobs.
---
The build height is just over 9 stories, and moving your camp module once you've placed it doesn't affect how high you can build. The only solution is to plop it down, build a 4 story ramp, and then place your camp on an elevated structure or tree 4 stories off the ground. The ramp you just built will disappear when you do this, so make sure you're wearing PA or fall resist armor so the drop doesn't kill you.
---
Also, the build zone is spherical, and you'll only have a very small space at ground level to build if you place your camp thingy 4 stories off the ground, so make sure it's directly above the place you want to start your camp.
---
IB4 this is an Elite Dangerous or Star Citizen comment. 
---
Havent played this game in 6-8 months. 
---
Anything fun happen in that time frame?
---
Hopefully they will, I have had a few Legendary scorched that were not in holiday outfits and without presents.
---
Welcome!! It's the usual nowadays, big franchises will get negative mainstream. Fuck it. The game is incredible! There's nothing like it. Free to live in a Fallout world. Wow. What Platform are you?
---
Looks OK, I would go 3 ranks of blocker, dont need Radicool if you are a sniper build, I recommend 3 ranks of Fireproof, a 5 intelligence is nice for crafting purposes, Dodgy, Adrenaline, Serendipity and be sure you have a couple Armor pieces with Poison Resist. Dunno what your third stars are, but I use a mix of Cavalier and Sentinels (sentinels doesnt work while sneaking but it does when you jump according to folks on here).

---
I did it solo about 4x yesterday. Apparently go through the cavern first not touching any ore - I take out the mirelurk kings the first time through. Then basically jump into the fissure and respawn at the beginning. I leave the SB alone cause it does not attack unless you start something. Then one by one pick up a piece of ore and wait for a group to appear. Kill them then pick up another piece etc.  
---
My last run last night I got a spawn of scorched probably 90% of the time and ended up with about 20 gifts. Though at the end was a bit tired and fell in the fissure and lost loot the only downer. But I picked up every piece of ultracite ore in the place. Took a while.
---
Level 40ish Megasloth pretty much always here by itself. 
---

---
Interesting, I have found that my sales of decreased as well since, the fallout 1st membership was established.
---
I used  to be able to make up words of 15-20 thousand caps a day selling rare items, and flux. 
---
Mind you, I have also noticed a decrease in the amount of players on the servers lately. Mind you this past weekend was hoping because of the free to play, and Dbl XP weekend. 
---
Keep envisioning the mod unlocking! Haha.  I'll send positive vibes and envision you unlocking it! Haha.  Don't give up man.
---
Did you bought it in Bethesda's store or did you bought a cdkey?
---
Not really, my legendary effects don't effect my damage resistance
---
I only equip gunsmith when Modding/Crafting guns. Otherwise Nerd Rage and 2 Demo expert.
---
I'm honestly surprised they didn't put a snow machine in the atomic shop. Same skin as the fog, just spits out snow. I would have bought it lol
---
All weapon weight - character is a part time mule and not my main 2.   Crafting is on my main mostly - have a poison, plenty of rad resist.  Dense chest so I don’t feel the need for fireproof.  Blocker even on ranged seems invaluable - rank 2 is quite a difference even.
---
This is a current issue on ps4 as well
---
I look forward to catching you at a workshop
---
Your experience has largely been the same as my own. Except considering buying Fallout 1st, that I'll never do. At least not until all the bugs and glitches are fixed, and even then, it's a maybe.
---
Good idea 
---
Would be helpful on multiple characters
---
I actually heard that they buffed PA in PvP some patches ago but I rarely do PvP so I don't really know.
---
Yes, No, Noob.
---
What are you spending caps on?
---
Sometimes its bugged, I've had the start producing only one &amp; the end producing 4. Just try again.
---
I had one weird run, someone else was already in there so I thought ill just go straight to the Ultracite. It was there, but I couldn't pick it up. 
---
If you see this your in luck
---
You can spawn 4 or 5 mins from each Ultracite vein. Just do it until no more spawn &amp; then move onto the next.
---
If only I could recreate it.
---
I read that you can also do the same at fissure sites? Going to test that out.
---
The holiday wrapping papers. They are 1400c or more depending on your charisma
---
lmfao, this was "patched" an update or two ago. So they brought it back? And never even fixed the same equivalent issue on the sledgehammer? Or the handful of other bugged attachments like the bleeding bone club?
---
Your best bet is probably to buy large gifts in the chance of getting it, and sell the rare plans you get that you don’t want. It can drop from all of them but the highest chance is from the large handmade.
---
It was the best of times
---
Yeah that happens. Problem is that at a certain point, people won't sell items and only trade because they have next to everything already
---
I think the sledgehammer has the "no head" mod, where you basically beat them with the handle.
---
7600 hours played equals 100 atoms lol
---
I had Dense and Fireproof 2, it was fine, I like pneumatic though since I seem to get staggered to a standing position easier lately.
---
Yeah the private worlds are pretty dope. Can launch a nuke and farm the crap outta the enemies, switch characters and constantly farm til the nuke goes away. Plus all that flux goes into the weightless stash box. I’m creeping almost 500 of each flux at the moment.
---
It’s got the combat... but seems to be missing the knife aspect...
---
I have rarely sold anything in my shops. And I placed aid items at cheap. And plans at 1-5 caps /sobs/ just wanna make enough caps for the fancy neon letters
---
This is for the small water purifier, right. I had this issue with it, too.
---
Am I missing something about the benefits of gifts?  
---
I've crafted a few but was underwhelmed by the rewards.
---
I'm gonna check later tonight!
---
That was fixed a few days back.
---
My fix happened by accident just as I was posting
---
Sometimes they just use Outer Worlds footage while they talk because they're morons lol
---
In 3 and NV there were skill checks for pretty much every stat and skill at some point in the game. The perception checks were usually for things like noticing an inconsistancy in a character's dialogue and realizing they were lying, or you'd come across a robot and one of the options would be something like: 
---
[Perception] You notice a loose wire in this robot's combobulator.
---
Passing the skill/speech check would open further options like repairing or sabotaging the robot.
---
I’m not on pc and I usually play late at night. So I do t really come across that many if any
---
Yeah definately feel like im dying a lot easier now, like 2 ir 3 super mutants are actually a real threat to me all of a sudden where as they used to be nothing
---
It's been a crazy year, with a crazy game! I've loved the ride. It's been fucking amazing!
---
If your perception is high enough the vats is obsolete, take that info however you will, otherwise its situational
---
I haven't been playing at all because both my characters are pretty full with weapons and junk and it's mostly things I just can't get rid of. Like some good legendaries and junk ones because my limit is full.
---
The missile holo tape only shows the global cool down, not your personal cool down.
---
I want my guy to pull out a bong and rip it with some nuclear Flora.
---
This is not necessarily correct. It depends if the character has started the BOS quest. If not they are all still valid. Just sell them to a npc vendor and buy them back with another character one a time.
---
Most of the time it’s about 14. What do you obsolete?
---
Here's a [spreadsheet with good info](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/3/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/htmlview#gid=0) about locations, drop rate, etc.
---
In Fallout 2 it gave 2 Action Points and faster turn sequence I believe and highly addictive. They could just have it grant 50 AP or something ...and call it Airplane. 😂🤣
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
He could have been a bit more diplomatic, but your title "something none of us can even get.....**yet**" implies that you didn't know that the suit had been available at one point.
---
Worked fine for me this weekend.
---
I am at the point with this game, that no matter what, we are dammed if we do, or dammed if we don't! 
---
I have been playing for over 2000hrs, I  have seen everything that can go wrong with this game. I just don't care anymore. 
---
I come on and play in the sand box, for a few hours every day. Make the best of my experience, regardless of what the outcome is. And then I go to bed, wake up, go about my day, and repeat. 
---
I am honestly at the point, I have bigger things to worry about at the end of the day! 
---
I get it, it is an inconvenient truth, that this game is plagued with bugs, and cheaters. But such is the real world! 
---
Until the bombs fall in reality, I am done bitching and complaining about this game. 
---
They made the game and released it to public with the features they chose too, they have features that don’t work by the masses... Still released to public and to this date it hasn’t been fixed at all.... if I put on pa or get out it glitches any fucking thing glitches so yes it is bethesda fault for falsely advertising a working gaming selling defective shit and not fixing the issues they have caused.... I alone am not the reason for Bethesda’s greed and lack of care for their game.... Bethesda themselves are and it is ridiculous to defend them from anything
---
Ability to have a completely Offline character with mods/cheats/whatever.  I get the logic of not letting that character play with others, but the game really misses out from being able to use mods like Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout NV.
---
Other than that?  It's WV, so we should have snow.  And dog companions.  And big-ass beards.
---
We didn't have snow, you liar!  
---
We had sand, sand as far as the eye could see. And a darkness so thick it was like you pulled the eyes out of your head and packed the holes with tar!
---
I got attacked by a beaver and died after it bit me 3x... and I’m a level 75. If I’m not careful now a few shots or hits will kill me..
---
I did the exact same thing and I’m having the exact same problem. Currently waiting for my re-download to finish. I’ll update you when it finishes. Should be done in just a few min.
---
Nope, can't downgrade a card. Can only level up a new one
---
I get that part. Just not sure why Orange Mentats were mentioned when we’re talking about Charisma.
---
You sound really trump like avoiding the facts.... I think you got to stop taking influence from that bigot clown and face the Facts... the Facts are the only thing that matter it makes sense I will hammer down the facts while you spew nonsense because the facts matter!
---
You aren’t very smart are you
---
Oh, good catch. My charisma is through the roof anyway, so it's been months since I paid attention to which drugs effect it.
---
Yeah ive had 1000 caos from 1 of the 3 or so large gifts ive found
---
To update you, a complete game reinstall fixed the problem. I’m now able to play.
---
Its hit or miss. I had it work fine once and bug out twice
---
First world problems, eh?
---
There have always been Legendary scorched. This event just has a lot more of them spawning.
---
Welcome to the first of many bugs to come!
---
Crit 33% there is a point when it's no longer helping or at least in any meaningful way. Same with all special except strength. Strength is the only one that deals raw damage upgrades.
---
With bloodied you don't need sneak perks... Int boost to finding mods comes to a cap.. ect ect.
---
I think Bethesda is aware that building is a notable interest in for many players in this game. It sounds like FO1st subscribers will be getting more budget and expanded building area, so there's that. My guess is that they'll likely come with or just before Wastelanders. 
---
But I definitely think they need to add more assets to the base game. The Christmas event has been pretty neat but in the end it's almost exclusively mounted heads, which don't do much for expanding our build choices since they're not dynamic assets. We need more basic structure assets earnable through in-game economies (not on the cash shop), particularly wall, floor, ceiling textures, as well as a few new shapes like vertical half-walls, and ideally window/glass inserts. We could also really use retextures like smudging, smoke, blood, dirt, cracks, etc. And after they do that they would be set to put more interesting, unique assets on the cash shop as big ticket items.
---
In practice though, I suspect (not quite cynically, but based on the example Bethesda has set) that we won't see much in the way of new base assets, and the cash shop will continue chugging along as the primary means of new decor. 
---
I'm actually less interested in what Bethesda is planning and more interested in what they're going to let modders do. If modders are given a long leash we could be looking at major game changers before long, like Place Anywhere from FO4 and the numerous awesome asset mods that exist.
---
You can also set the search option in your junk menu to highlight items with screws (helps if you already have a screw in your inventory).   
---
(not my video, but gets the job done...)

---
It was the worst of times
---
Pc !
---
I do enjoy it, I just miss everyone bunched up sweating blowing up cars lol.
---
I leave th SB alone cause it's got nothing I want. Though by the time you get to the end area there could be a few SBs flying around and going through walls etc. They get a bit buggy.
---
Oh. Is there a central location where I could read about these caps? Does that mean I shouldn’t have escape artist and level 1 sneak?
---
It was uphill both ways.
---
This is an awesome idea! I'd come play, but that timespan I'm at work. Have fun with your holiday giveaway!
---
I like the game cause I can run around naked and punch things. Audio is normally off and my graphics are potato so the scenery and ambiance is kind of meh for me.
---
Pocketed raider chest gives you 15 carry weight?  Is that unique to the raider chest?
---
You can vendor serums for almost 500 caps each depending on your charisma. I buy cheap ones just so my alts can pop on and make a few hundred easy caps for each one.
---
Dude I’m running it on DSL (no other options besides satellite).  It took me over 2 weeks just to download the game.  The game runs great most of the time on my Xbox OG.
---
Its because the coding shows it as a  + food and drink, it'll need a specific fix
---
I've been doing the same for the past few days to keep up with all of my wrapping paper needs. I suppose it's possible that people who are buying multiples of the same serum from my vending machines are doing the same.
---
Ooooh green glowing snow
---
Okay, cool. Thanks.
---
Damn, can't have a sleep over at our Camps! But feel free to give me a shout for tips or places to see! Xx
---
Geez, I'm doing something wrong... I had maybe 30k across 3 characters but I can never max caps for the life of me... I can never get accumulation
---
... which... now all 30k is gone too lol...
---
Well that infamous plasma grenade plan can be one of the rewards as well as PA plans
---
You must be new here
---
Good try at sarcasm
---
How the hell do y'all get so many damn caps to spend????
---
Ah, the old mire. Where I had to max out my build budget with lights just to see my one work bench.
---
It's a Trap - beast still getting stuck somewhere so the fight never happens. 
---
Ash Heap shoot down the scavenger plan event. - Half the time there is no plane. 
---
Scorched Earth. I get the hits in. I do enough damage with my level 400 melee meathook but sometime I get rewards from the event and can't loot the queen. Other times I can loot the queen but no event rewards. This is happening to people I play with as well. It's been mentioned in this sub many times but every single time I see it there are 20 comments saying the person must not have done enough damage. Fuck that. Something is fucked there. 
---
Always Vigilant - Bot gets stuck in a state of disrepair even though it has been fixed and event timer runs to the end to fail. 
---
Campfire Tale - The left behind camper objects will occasionally just not spawn in or feeding the fire during the last steps doesn't register and fails the event. 
---
Horde Events. - Half the time you fast travel to the event and there is nothing around. The enemies either aren't spawned in or are trapped somewhere. Then the other half of the time the boss is dead or seconds from death upon fast travel because it's under attack from a mob. Rarely do I see a Horde event pay off so I stopped doing them. 
---
Back on the Beat - Bot gets stuck and jumps back to nearly the beginning around half way through. This makes it nearly impossible to finish on time. Bot dying without sustaining a hit happens too. 
---
The Messenger- 6/10 times it works. The other 4 you aren't getting hit part to spawn in to start him moving or he gets hung up on a piece of the world. 
---
Collision Course - Boxes following you all over the map after it's done.
---
Where is this info found? All I recall is it's found in vault 95, but theoretically could have been put there by the Gunners, I guess
---
Armor 100% for sure has WAY less durability than normal. Since patch 16 anyway
---
Not really. I have one character who uses only perks and mutations for armor (Barbarian, Evasive, Scaly Skin, Grounded) as well as Fireproof for explosive and fire damage mitigation (no Lone Wanderer). I'm able to farm the super mutants from Huntersville, West Tek, and the satellite array with relative ease just punching them (only weapon I use is an Instigating Knuckles with 40% to power attack, fully upgraded).
---
Are you on now? (6:30pm EST)? I’d like to check your wares.
---
1400 a day at a minimum and really nothing else to spend them on
---
Well we are gonna all be broke together lol
---
Thats one of the main reasons I went after it, just to find out that it doesn't work :/ was pretty annoyed. How do these bugs live for so long, they're such simple fixes.
---
Tldnr.... this crazy manifesto helps your case how?
---
Those enemies are usually lower level for me
---
The thing that annoys me about Scorched Earth is getting killed just after the event completes and you have received your reward - then respawning and the flux has disappeared from your loot bag but the worthless shit is still there.
---
That sucks, really. I just get the "You were disconnected from the servers" in every online game, every day.
---
Gonna check this out in a bit. What an awesome thing you got going on!
---
Nothing like a bit of gambling to act as a rapid caps sink right before wastelanders release.
---
Two Shot Explosive Submachine - Level 30 though. Unfortunately still the best non-purveyor item.
---
Same. I used to only have to repair armor like once a week, now Im repairing daily.
---
It definitely worked. We needed a cap sink for a long time. This one did it for me lol
---
Everything about your post screams incel.  I hope you didn't intend for it to be that way. As a woman, please stop using "female" as a descriptor.
---
I like to use diplomacy and send my highly energetic ambassador to meet people face to face. 
---
Said ambassador also happens to be my fist.
---
I had more fun then. Now the game is very flat
---
Everyone needs to upvote this! Every time I hear that \*jingle I get excited and start searching for the colorful gift bearing scorched. The DHH community wouldn't have any idea that a holiday scorch was near if its not added to the subtitles.
---
Sleeping bags are the one thing I can’t find haha. Everything worse was there as owned. Logging in now to see if I can craft them.
---
 That being said. Does anyone have a trick/fix for removing bugged camp items? I have a Halloween decoration stuck into a permanent wall in the game. The wall is on a boat. Is there any fix or do I have to move the camp that I've been building up since launch? 
---
I'm venting my frustration and asking the community if they know of a bug fix. Im assuming TLDNR means "to long did not read?"
---
I think you're missing an important distinction, CoD lacks an open, explorable world that has an element of persistence to it. You keep citing CoD but it isn't even remotely the same type of game. 
---
That said I would absolutely say that is is a massive multiplayer online game, but the most important part of mmo that you keep dropping off is the role-playing game part. 
---
MMO is shorthand for the already shortened MMORPG.
---
The cap limit are least tries to maintain economy, even though it’s shot and people mostly just do trade only. 
---
But there is literally no reason to have a scrip limit. We can’t transfer scrip. It just bottlenecks us for no reason.
---
In a roleplaying game you have a choice of the role you play. Does that help?
---
LOL, got a lvl 1 Furious Shovel from a Santa Scorched last night
---
You can select that card again for a one level version, then two level, etc...  and you end up with different “strength” versions of the same perk card
---
No you can just pick up a new card tho
---
Since the character is 250+ they're around the high 60s for me, with a odd few 40+ and 50+ sprinkled in.
---
I understand that already. My point is that 76 is an RPG yes, albeit with very minimal RPG mechanics. But it is not an MMO.
---
This happens when you are over encumbered.
---
Shhhhhh
---
Fallout isn't Fallout.
---
There was a bug before the last patch or two that was causing armor to never lose durability. Check the last couple of patch notes.
---
Speaking from my own experience I haven’t repaired armor in at least a month, although I haven’t been playing a lot in that time span.
---
Or seasonal ones? Halloween scorched. Easter scorched. Presidents’ Day scorched
---
There’s certainly positives and negatives. We do need a good cap sink which has proven to be done well. Development time for something like this or the “global events” they did recently have got to be much quicker and easier, taking away less time from Wastelanders development. I also like that I can farm the mobs anywhere, anytime at my own pace rather than waiting for the top-of-the-hour meat week or random Halloween event timers. That said, it would have been nice to also have a public event involving presents too, even a “gift exchange”-themed event that would add more social emphasis
---
Actually I go there, then behind it is a fissure, I pluck ultracite 1 by 1 and watch the scorch run to me.  Sometimes every peice I pluck a legendary shows up in each group.    Easy legendaries.
---
Unfortunately I can’t play during your online hours but it’s cool you’re doing this. Best wishes!
---
sweet thanks for the succinct and informative reply
---
thanks I'll scope that out
---
I'm level 126, and last Time I farmed their they were around the 20's probably because the first player to enter the cell was a lower level
---
If it’s not your wall, you’ll have to move the camp. Had a similar issue with small letters
---
Yeah, I’ve scored a couple dozen unknown plans on my main...including three plasma grenades!
---
I'd keep escape artist.. it's a very small stealth boy effect. May or may not work on AI but was amazing for survival cause it broke vats... Stopping players from using auto aim on you. 
---
Sneak is probably worthless, tho it could be like Anti armor or AP refresh when gains are multiplicative not additive.
---
Occasionally I like to fish for downvotes from people who don't get jokes.
---
I got the same thing happening in my CAMP. Items in the ceiling, around 10 maybe. That's a lot of shit when you are down to being able to place one item. 
---
Sadly, we got one solution and that's to up and move thee entire CAMP. I agree there should be a list to pull up to delete from instead of having to grab things. I've complained about this for a year and all you are gonna get is salt or shrugs from these people and players. 
---
There is no such thing as customer service anymore and don't even get me started on over seas call centers. Ugh.
---
Bethesda? Another glitch bug exploit hack ? IN BETHESDA? na this is not real man, you might be hallucinating.  
---
I'm so happy this is happening. Fuck this game, its 100% BROKEN and falling apart and every single stupid post in this Reddit is about "how amazing this community is" yes sure we are all gonna believe is the loyal users speaking right now. Bullshit.
---
Sell them to a vendor
---
I'm on ps4 ;-;
---
Could just give caps and gear to low levels to act as target dummies you could have different sets of armor to change dr lol
---
I miss reloading at aaronholt (sp?) farm and hoarding fusion cores then running to the cabins northwest of there and hoping superutants had spawned so I could waste somehwere in the neighborhood of 2k rounds of ammo to kill all 6 of them when I was level 15.
---
Also, all wood bases were the shit.
---
yep I think my plan actually would require 9, maybe 10 stories to pull off so I'm going to have to find another spot :P
---
While you’re at it, there should be a Mr Handy that rushes up to you and yells “Congratulations!!!” While you are sneaking up to an enemy. That’d be awesome
---
I typically only run into this problem during these holiday events. I think when they do these kind of events, they should just remove the scrip limit for the duration of the event. Would be an added bonus to the event, making people want to play more.
