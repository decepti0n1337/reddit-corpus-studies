No, I've done a solo queen &amp; it still didn't register

---
---
Oh man, love that one! The feels! Oh, and changing your link to a word of choice is easy, just type it like this:
---

---
[your word of choice](link to your song)
---
The link should contain the https if I'm not mistaken.
---
Display driver may have crashed with the game. Try restart your PC and launch the game.
---
I solo’d her and still won’t count, maybe some lucky sob’s stray bullet shot from White Springs killed her every single time lol
---
Oh my god a public vault dungeon event...I need it.
---
Imagine a deathclaw just full on T-boning you in your little metal jeep lmao. Just blowing you over. Trampled.
---
same for me. I soloed her on a private server and nothing. nada.
---
I'm not bothered by the loot really, I do like the repair kits, I get enough flux from nuking on private. 
---
It's the enjoyment, the satisfaction from running a silo, launching a nuke and having a good fight with a group of random players, all the different outfits and weapons effect can be real fun.
---
But these players who are all about rushing everything, speed playing and kill everything as fast as possible. I don't get the point, where do they need to be in such a hurry?
---
That’s what the PTS reported.
---
It says you can earn SCORE from earning exp and completing public events so in theory you dont have to do any of the challenges if you didn't want and still go up levs on the board (Though I'm sure this would be at a much slower rate). So I plan to do all the ones I can do solo then just grind exp and publics to fill the void
---
Send it to the PTS!
---
 Where the bug reports never get ignored and the content comes out anyways squeaky clean!!  The land where Ra-Ra always makes it though the ducts at both Grafton steel and the vault raid!!
---
Seems like they are starting to pay attention now at the very least but it didn't work out too well with Wastelanders.
---
That is a great idea . There should of never been pvp in the first place .
---
Screw Johnny he tried to kill me for some bullion. I reloaded my save, and did the entire last part over, just to kill him both ways. ;) Traitor.
---
The data mined info is few and far between. It took me a good hour or so to search and scroll through all the sub channels. The vault 96 body armour is fugly (uses marine armour) and the PA is...interesting but a bit underwhelming. We were hoping for something like the strangler PA but with icicles or something hanging off it. 
---
Vault 96 should definitely be on the PTS but my biggest worry is that they will nerf it to the ground and make it too easy or just a mass kill everything without adding challenging puzzles to it. If i want an ammo dump then I'll go and do a queen. I enjoy killing but I like to stretch my brain and solve puzzles as well.
---
Were ya playing it via steam?
---
Some people are heavy builds.
---
That's the part about "decisions with consequences".
---
One of my Raider Characters killed him.
---
Another left him alive.
---
The third is going to kill him when he tries to rob her. (She's not really a raider, though. She's Enclave using the Raiders).
---
A kid I use to play with finished the questline with Barb, Lev, and the others still alive. Didn't kill any of them. I'm curious about the repercussions from that on future content. Might try it out with my last Raider playthrough. 🤔
---
You're welcome. 
---
I'm always keen to share the stories from Vault 94. It was my favourite part of the game for a long time and my driving goal for quite a while. Trying to solo it made me reevaluate my approaches to weight-management, survival, weapon choices. Hell, I didn't think twice about Mirelurk Kings until I had to face the bastards in there, and I'd've never considered leveling Pain Train if not for how the damned place work.
---
In the end, I even realized the enemy wasn't the trash in there; it was the clock, and that changed everything.
---
Guess I'm kind of the "last ambassador" of Vault 94 at this point.
---
Who needs doors when you can just jump through someone’s window?
---
Wow. Id do that myself, but my legacy flamethrower always breaks after I get a quarter of her health down. Don't have repair kits atm.
---
Either way I'll take your word. Also congrats
---
Would be useful if solo players could post quick requests to the map, get teamed, complete the task then drop. Just enough to get it done, but the understanding it isnt for social interaction.
---
It should be similar to the plasma thrower configuration of the plasma rifle, keep spraying laser until reload would be cool. Right now it’s just one ‘pew’, it should really be a continuous light beam instead.
---
You dont even have the budget to fill all 30
---
It was even worse in vault 94. Even with the rank 2 rad sponge someone in the team had to share just to live IN power-armor. God forbid if you got out of it you would be cooked alive before you could return to your suit. And of course if someone could res you, you’d just die over and over again.
---
Yeah, I had a jukebox in my stripC.A.M.P., and let me tell ya. Classical music is not for ass-shaking or poledancing.
---
I hope so
---
Life finds its way, always.
---
Now I just have a spotify playlist with every single fallout song. No radio host, and full choice. 
---
Still play Hatchet Man on the regular though.
---
Yeah I really want them to bring back vault 94, apart from the sbq and the upcoming colossus fight, it’s the only other endgame content we have. And this raid would go perfectly with public teams
---
The left one.
---
Yeah and they're keeping it open longer for each update too lol, but fair point either way the pts is by no means a guarantee stuff will be fixed
---
I'm still waiting for that vats bug to be dealt with, 95% and I miss every time until I shoot something outside of vats lmao, doesn't happen often but it can really mess up my stealth build lol
---
Mine too! That was one of the first things that really got me hooked on the game, I loved that storyline \^\^
---
My one major inventory management gripe is a simple one, fuck gunpowder. You'd think I was loading my bullets with powdered gold with how heavy the crap is.   
---
Lead real world density is \~11.34 g/cm\^3, gunpowder real world is \~0.97 g/cm\^3. So, it should be lighter than purified water by volume (real world being \~1 g/cm\^3).   
---
In game lead: 0.1 weight unit, in game gunpowder: 0.05 weight unit.  
---
Damn you bethesda.
---
Hell yeah, please.
---
I have the mask and I've been wearing that with the starlet sniper outfit since it came out, but an actual outfit would be rad
---
No one gonna mention the weird stretch out back u seen on power armors
---
For what it’s worth, you can place two foundation pieces next to one another and then place two door frame walls at the intersection to create exterior and interior walls. Once they’re down you can swap out the door frames for other wall types and then delete the foundations as needed.
---
take only adeshive/ballistic fiber and screws the rest is easy to get, don't worry about it, and focus on desk fans/typewriter for screws
---
Delete blueprint and store components. I didn't know at the time, but that's the solution.
---
I hope not. Yeah, add a spoil term, but not removed completely from the events.
---
I think the players that duped them, and have hundreds of each plan should be removed from the game. Unless the accounts were created after Wastelanders. Then just remove all the copies. A lot of dupers have been passing the plans off to new players.
---
Which is a real Dick move if, and hopefully when 🤞, BGS does another duper and item purge and the new players get caught up in it.
---
It's way past time for another ban wave for exploiters.
---
I always close the door when I go in and then get locked in. Idk why I keep doing it I just.... forget.
---
Nah. You'll be stuck with "5" atoms for a long time like I was.
---
Yeah, I frequently have to stop at very high points and just.. Look. Making CAMPS far off the beaten path, and in the mountains, is damn breathtaking.
---
Delayed as most things this joke of a company tries to do
---
It’s...a survival game. You can only fit so much junk in a box after all. Just be thankful you weren’t around when the stash was 400lbs and every time you logged off you dropped any junk you were carrying at the time.
---
For junk- If you have the Atoms, definitely get the regular Collectron from the Atomic Shop.
---
For exp the daily faction missions for the two major factions at Foundation and The Crater are fairly generous and you'll be grinding them for reputation anyway.
---
For all of the above... the events: Uranium Fever, Radiation Rumble, and Riding Shotgun are always worth doing if you see other people on the map doing it.
---
Went from fallout 4 then to nv and now to 76. I'm gonna have to get into a habit of picking up fans again.
---
It’s due to everyone sitting on tents or fencing and that one guy who keeps trying to use grenades
---
There's a cap? (I only have 2 so I didn't know)
---
I would also suggest grabbing a collection from the atomic shop to help get some junk or scrap at your camp. It’s not reliable by itself, but it does help a bit. 
---
Sell ammo you don’t need at your camp vendor if you have the space - keep in mind most ammo should be sold at 1cap. It takes a little while to sell, but someone comes by eventually. It won’t get you a lot of caps, but it’s easy work.
---
How much is the collectron? Should I put it in a specific place?
---
by that reason then it would be perfectly acceptable that if the clerk at a corner store left the cash register open that it would be fine to take the money in the drawer...We can agree to disagree
---
Eh, vending is so and so anyway. I much prefer people not knowing where my CAMP is. Afraid someone will kill my deathclaw lmao.
---
Awww yeaa I do that all the time \^\^, if only the damn allies keep opening them back up! Hahah &lt;3
---
Have you tried running the game from the Fallout76.exe in...? You may not have installed in C: of course.
---
C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\Fallout76  \[Fallout76.exe\]
---
Bypass the launcher.
---
Been bad fot the last 1700h &amp; 40k scrip im afraid...
---
Not a bloodied weapon.
---
The damn fast travel bug. I have it so bad I have to try about 10 times just to get it to work. Didn't seem too bad at first, but dear god its irritating now that I've been getting it so much more often.
---
for experience, make sure you sleep in a bed. it gives you +5% xp for 1 hour. 
---
for junk, in the early game, pick up almost everything and scrap it. a little later on, mark certain components of junk (you can do this in your pip boy by scrolling to junk and clicking component view). this will mark junk in the world that has those components. i recommend marking screws, gears, springs, lead, ballistic fiber, fiber optics, nuclear material, and aluminum. 
---
best of luck on your fallout journey!! i live the game. hope you do too!
---
Even outside of Bethesda's other games having infinite storage, the previous games didn't really demand much inventory management while FO76 ramps it way up.
---
Just make it so u have a set bonus that varies per set of power armor example strangler power armor. Raider can have a boost to melee damage 50% yes high but the armor sucks, excavator already has increased carry weight and ore t45 can have a boost to energy weapons, t51 a 30% boost to physical damage resistance t60 a 15% energy and ballistic, and x01 a 30% energy resistance. This isnt a 30% armor rating boost but a ignore 30% of incoming energy damage much like a hunters or any of the others that allow u to ignore 15% damage from enemies
---
You sure about that? 3 star enemies have a
---
Chance of dropping up to 3 stars. Two stars can drop up to 2 stars. It’s RNG.
---
XIV is updated late at night for us due to time zones. For Japan (where the game is made and where the majority of players are), it's smack dab in the middle of peak hours, much like 76.
---
Also the glitch where when I fire a gun, the audio shits itself and repeats the shooting sounds for about 5 minutes. Gets real crazy with miniguns and stuff like that.
---
[removed]
---
It also has a mishmash of numerous perks that don’t proc or you can’t use while in it.
---
What system are you playing on? Its super rare to see a griefer in my experience. Where are they attacking you? The only place they can actually deal damage to you if you don’t shoot back are workshops, which are dedicated PvP zones.
---
Upon reading a second time... are you upset at people being friendly and giving you free stuff? Is that what you are calling griefing? Lol
---
I'm ready, I just hope Bethesda is too.
---
T posing unkillable ghouls can stay though. Always a good laugh, compared to other more annoying bugs.
---
Its kinda glitched you have to kill it you need to take the last shot
---
Yes please for the love of god yes. I don’t care about game balance at this point I just want my stupid exoskeleton tank to actually feel like an exoskeleton tank as opposed to wet tissue paper when compared to other players
---
Maybe you went into it will a self-fulfilling prophecy? Never had an experience with griefers, especially at a low level and I’ve started 4 different characters. I’m also confused as to how you got griefed considering pacifist mode exists. 
---
Bugs are bugs, all games have them. If you were told/read what to expect going in, you shouldn’t be surprised. You’ll be hard pressed to find sympathy here.
---
Any extra pictures of this, not sure im getting a full understanding from just this.
---
same for me
---
it can be bought from the vendor bot in watoga, pretty costly though.
---
🤔
---
yes
---
I think you’re one of those guys that complains about the game 76 is known for having an amazing player base and I’ve replayed 76 a gazillion times and there’s bugs but nothing game breaking
---
Not surprised about the bugs nor do I need sympathy..if you read what I said you'd see that bud. Your comment proves my point further on the playerbase though
---
wastelanders. you can grind for reputation and gold bullion. also a new boss/event is coming soon: Colossal Problem
---
I forgot how much they are, but placement doesn't matter. You could lock him in a room if you wanted to and you'd still get junk. As long as he can enter/exit his little recharging station it'll work the same as if you gave him an open field.
---
m8, dont forget that there is the weapon and a armor benches in the barn slightly north west of drop site v9. very handy to fix gear mid fight! :)
---
Minigun go brrrrrrrr
---
That's great that you love it, everyone has different opinions. I stated I havent played enough to judge the game. I'm talking about griefers and my experience, not yours. You're proving my point further though, thanks
---
&gt;you will have an option to upload it to her console
---
The problem for me was it is not possible to upload them to her console. I go over to the console and press the use button but nothing happens. I have several games I would be fine with giving her bc I never play them but its simply not letting me lol.
---
Five characters allowed per account.
---
Would you mind sharing an example of the griefing that’s occurring?
---
Not really. She still does it when I’m doing it solo and no one is on the fences or tents.
---
Are you really this upset about them delaying legendary perks based on player feedback?
---
[deleted]
---
Uh...no. I said that to clarify. I'm talking about actual griefing. And not pvp or just attacking...thanks for proving point further. You all seem rather hostile for newcomers even here. It's my opinion and experience so far...deal with it
---
Spruce knob camp grounds has flies ticks and blood bugs.
---
DC, Mojave, and the Commonwealth were hit harder by the bombs than Appalachia, and 200ish years later, the vermin are still breeding.
---
The radiation in Appalachia is minor comparatively. It just seems more of an issue because of the "survival" mechanics with eating a drinking.
---
The plague and "The Boy" are what ya need to worry about in WV for now.
---
Strangler heart was a step in the right direction before dupers found it. Even so, it’s damage nerf rendered it practically useless
---
Re-freaking-tweet.
---
Disagree.
---
Ummm...Patch 20 isn’t even out yet.
---
And, if they improve the Legendary Perks and the Colossus event, I’d rather them do that, instead of rushing unfinished or bad content.
---
what does tick blood tequila do?
---
why
---
Agree! Saw a most a long time ago about how the player with the least damage dealt gets picked up and carried off by the next SB that spawns haha. Would love a leaderboard.
---
As someone who finds immense joy in killing the mobs, I think damage for the entire event would be cool too. But I know that would be hard to implement.
---
Avoid PVP by going pacifist in settings menu. You can also block a griefer for a session. Or Just take note of player's ID and block permanently. Server hop. Won't be placed in the same server.
---
As an owner of a C.A.M.P.-Cafe I'd like to see some improvements to the whole food system, so I fully agree with you here.
---
I try my best to prepare the most in demand foods and drinks all the time, but it hurts me to see it spoiling in my vending before anyone could buy it. I get max 1 person who buys food per day (even though I basically sell for the price of ingredients, even if I could have sold it to a bot for more, as I want to help fellow players), and most of the time they go for the preserved ones :(
---
False equivalency.
---
Clearly the poster above didn't mean that the Order of Mysteries deserved to die out because they don't let it in men, but because they turned their backs on a defenseless kid while simultaneously taking away everybody that he had relied on which is screwed up in so many ways.
---
Quick question how did u get this I have normal and desert
---
No I actually understand that bit. They were a bit underwhelming. However the Colossus event had no problems, by player feedback, and it too was pulled.
---
Wasn't worried about that was wondering if they gave it an actual explosion or not.
---
It’s a bug that can be repeated. Although I hope they never remove cuz it’s a life saver sometimes. It’s also fun to have an auto grenade launcher with faster fire rate and a 250 round clip. The only downside is mindlessly blowing through your ammo. Anytime I log on I set up all my fav guns with at least 250 clips and some 500.
---
that would make the game 2 times better. haha
---
Yes, what kind of griefing?
---
I just don't use doors anymore.
---
Lol proving ur point further yeah ok and I never said I love it it’s a great time killer you’re in the wrong place go to a different subreddit the reason I’m being rude is because ur shitting on a game you’ve barely played and saying that everyone’s a greifer except the community is so nice the devs made the human npcs treat them as such crap on the game but not on the wonderful community that supports it
---
To clarify the challenges exist but they give SCORE instead
---
I agree, however do tell me what was wrong with the Colossus event.
---
And bloodbugs, sometimes ticks and radroaches in the main house
---
Ah that I didn't know, that might help a bit. I appreciate the feedback
---
Too easy. We don’t need another end-game boss that can be solo’ed, easily.
---
Gimme dat clean sink
---
I was so happy to reach ally so I could stop doing Ward’s quests haha. Didn’t care about the poop machine but not having to go track down a bone saw? Amazing.
---
What? I’m not being hostile, I asked an honest question because your post is very confusing.  I never see griefing on Xbox so I am curious your system. You mentioned not wanting friendly players, which now seems even more out of context. I’m sorry you had a bad experience but I can guarantee you it’s not representative of the community as a whole.
---
You’re also proving my point that u don’t know enough to know what you’re talking about
---
No you guys aren’t understanding it’ll cost that if you don’t wanna play and grind and just buy it out right
---
In what way? It has a neat mechanic to EXTEND the fight and it had more health than the SBQ
---
Underrated
---
always been confused why there were 2 extra blank stars...
---
Nice, I like this idea. I tend to do all the events when thy pop up, so ill be sure to stock pile a couple from the tea pot event.
---
I'm talking about my experience...my opinion so far. I stated I barely played it and cant judge it yet..I'm not making a blanket statement and I'll still play it I'm sure I'll like plenty of aspects. Being rude bc you dont like someone's opinion is just childish, relax bc it doesn't affect you bud
---
And seriously Wren, could I just grab you a dozen or two radio vacuum tubes while I'm out? I don't even leave the house for 3 chicken nuggets.
---
If you ever tested it you would know that one of the BIG problems with it was that if you died you spawned outside of the rubble, and could not re enter, there where also a few other problems.
---
Both where delayed because Beth listened to the PTS players....
---
And probably not for long.
---
Agreed. Keeping up the munitions factory is a PITA. I just craft ammo with super duper and ammosmith. For guns with garbage crafting rates, I just switch to a prime barrel since prime ammo is so much easier to craft (provided you can solo-nuke-farm).
---
Looking forward to the ammo converter from S.C.O.R.E though!
---
I don't expect to play it tomorrow. I will  wait at least a week. Hopefully that will be long enough for them  to do a hot fix for whatever this patch fucks up.
---
I put in my comment I dont k bbn ow enough yet, I said so far. Can you read bud? You are further proving my point about the playerbase so far
---
Literally just need 2 things for PA and I’d be happy, better arm mods, poison/acid resistance
---
Actually, that mechanism didn’t make the cut and wasn’t in the PTS...it was a straight up fight. The only thing that made it even a little difficult was the Wendigo spawns.
---
Yeah shoddy hit the nail on the head. This goes for all damage increase perks. First rank always gives 10%. Since junkies really just adds a wopping +50% damage, I never really feel the need to max out all 3, stealing 9 points of special.
---
Because then you're opening the door to people wanting X amount of the loot because they scored more damage and blah blah blah.
---
And it'll turn the event into a pissing contest for high lvl daily players and an absolute shitshow for anyone on the lower lvls.
---
It's just a bad idea with no real positive outcome besides bragging rights.
---
You shit on a community dude that’s why I’m being rude and you’re right your opinion means utterly nothing because your argument is invalid since you shit in a community
---
Fair enough. And no, I am a console player.
---
Ah. Thx for this advice. Do you know if she has ever replenished her health, if one were to leave to far out of the area?
---
i mean your not wrong
---
I said I dont need friendly players, as in I'm not making this post bc I want them or handouts. So that no one would think that. I'm sure it doesn't represent the whole community. Just my experience so far, so I shared it.
---
There were some problems under the hood they were ironing out. Do you think they pulled it just to be mean?
---
Not the whole community, but my experience so far....what dont you get bud?
---
Dang, I was gonna go with score point exploit! So instead I'll say...Allies are completely broken, and the ammo converter swallows your gear.
---
I’m reading everything and you’ve made yourself look like a fool because you shit on the player base take the post down so you don’t keep looking dumb
---
Ah, ok.
---
Another problem was that colossus could get stuck, and it was also hard to find the treasure chest if you didn't already know exactly where it was located, very easy to miss..
---
500 atoms if I remember correctly. Had it for a while, but the communist one is 500.
---
You literally said and I quote “an awful player base” there is that read enough for you you absolute buffoon of a person
---
They aren't. But I don't see any harm in asking. We all thought NPCs were never gonna happen.
---
Well, it’ll be fun for 15 minutes.
---
I see, well you counted that argument. Fair play
---
If you went in with no expectations, you wouldn't use a phrase like "bit the bullet". Pretty clear you went in biased, and still are.
---
I'm sure you can find another solo FO4 mod to assuage your delicate sensibilities.
---
Shut them if they were shut.
---
I never shut the doors on my own base and don't really want them shut.
---
And I’m not your “bud” get outta here come back when you don’t shit on the community bud
---
That’s fine we simple see it differently, I don’t see the need to exploit something just todo it so instead of Beth giving things we ask for they have to spend time and money to fix something that someone knows they shouldn’t be doing. But I will do my part as a fallout 1st member and pay my subscription as well as buying atoms each month, this way they have the extra money to fix the problem that duper’s cause as well as giving us cool new skins and items.
---
YESSSSSSSS
---
The minimum is six... So your local fast food manager needs to check his shit....
---
But seriously after maxing raider I don't even do dailies for them now- I got a tiny bit more and I won't see ward again either. To hell with the bullion neither quest has any flavour after a million of them.
---
Lol right, youre quoting one piece of a sentence. That is what I've seen out of my experience so far. Learn some comprehension skills lol
---
Legendary Perks were delayed due to PTS feedback - a good thing, shows they are listening.
---
Collosus event was pulled from Patch 20 to deal with bugs - shows they are listening. 
---
Seasons is being introduced because players wanted an ongoing event with a variety of rewards - shows they are listening.
---
Public Teams allows per-session group play without having to build up friends lists or take a chance of griefers - shows they are listening. 
---
As for 'few remaining fans' - 30k+ every time I see live player counts. 
---
Yet people still feel the need to complain because  it doesn't fit their perfect vision and they have nothing better to do.
---
Don't like it? Don't play it!
---
I've been seeing people trying to sell .50 and 5mm for 5-10 caps per....
---
Pretty sure those players have never even used a full auto in the game. 🤣😂🤣😂
---
Or don't do a leader board but at least tell you how much damage you yourself did.
---
Says that one that can’t comprehend what he wrote and not only that won’t explain to anyone in this comment section what happened or what system your on
---
Wendigo event had minor issues and was pushed back, Legendary perks were not satisfactory and were pushed back, weekly and daily challenges have been nerfed, not removed. And I hate to say it, but you shouldn't have been able to buy all your shit with challenge atoms anyway, they needed a nerf. Think whatever you like about the atomic shop, but those payments keep this game running.
---
I wouldn't mind them opening the Vaults back up, but not as Raids. They've ruined that idea for me. I would rather them be more like The Burrows, just full of lore and junk to collect.
---
Lol my God you all are the most hateful bunch I've met in any community this far. Thanks for your comment bud
---
I just bought 3 gifts to put in my display they look badass
---
Ah yes, the classic "Don't Like Don't Play" Argument. I paid $60 dollars for this game. I want my moneys worth. I don't a hit in this game unless it deserves it, and in this case it does.
---
What kind of griefing have you seen?
---
They don't do it at different times for different servers?
---
I hate that fucker he personally brings me into a deathmatch brings down my rep by failing it kills the person to make an example demands 25% of the cut they tries backstabbing me?
---
Two Shot = To Scrip.
---
I did some experiments with a TS Plasma Caster. The slow, glowing rounds make it easy to follow and it really highlighted how the shots disappear in seemingly random directions thanks to terrible accuracy Nerfs. I wouldn't be too sad scrapping it.
---
I somehow got the bug where the daily for Ward always autocompletes as soon as I talk to him each day. I've never once actually gotten a target from him. I feel extremely lucky.
---
I do not miss those days at all. That and I wasn't smart enough to scrap all of my junk the first week so I filled up on day 1 and didn't know what to do
---
That's not as bad as a camp I visited today dude was trying to sell 40mm for 300 each 😂
---
I'd gladly respond to those comments, too busy with you hateful bunch and responding to fools like you
---
Todd Howard has clearly blessed you, my friend.
---
Several months ago I saw a camp where they used suitcases to make a spiral staircase. Since then I've wanted the real thing
---
We’ve actually played the game and don’t shit in the community get outta here dude
---
I haven't seen anyone mention it yet, but the event "Feed the people" in Morgantown rewards Canned Meat Stew, which gives you a 5% XP increase food buff that comes in handy.
---
If you're playing on team the Inspirational perk in Charisma also gives you a XP buff. I think rank 1 is 5%, I don't group up much so idr.
---
Also, if you happen to stumble upon Leadership Bobbleheads, they also increase XP, but are much harder to find.
---
Not even saying how you were griefed?
---
Doctor, Doctor! I'm in pain!  
---
Well, how intense is the pain?  
---
...  
---
Err - Well, where is it?  
---
How about how did it start?  
---
Leave my office, crazy person.  
---
Wait, wait - Let me guess, I'm proving your point further about what a horrible community 76 has? xD
---
This dude is trying to give you free stuff and you still hate on the player base in your other post. Interesting.
---
Not shitting on the community at all. I'm speaking about the few that I have encountered. Grow up kid
---
It cool for a one hander
---
You can buy additional poses through the Atom Shop. Don't recall if there's been an 'aiming weapon' one but there's usually a rolling selection if you want to add more.
---
Fyi, if you just find the portable power pack before doing the ward quest, it autocompletes the quest every time you start it, and the power pack stays in your inventory
---
Some people just need to bitch. Gets old quickly.
---
These are amazing ideas however definitely needs tweaking. Everything else is underpowered compared to the stash increase unless say the cap values were defined and outweighed the stash increase. (And probably bring the stash increase down to maybe 7-10%)
---
I think they might have.  I say that because I think I've killed myself a few times with some of the new weapons.
---
The player base I have witnessed so far in my own experience. Not the whole community. Y'all dont have to white knight the game. I might love the game after this hump. This was my experience so far, relax kid
---
Cuse then you don't spend money on the atoms to buy the new shit there gona add that's shop only that you can't get outa the board
---
No problem man.
---
Once again petty calling me a kid and stuff lol dude stopping to new levels anyways there’s a reason your post was removed and you literally said the whole community you made a fool of yourself go jerk it to your little “victory” I stop talking to idiots after a bit because they won’t acknowledge they made themselves look foolish and I’d have more luck banging my head against a brick wall to make it understand
---
For 500 it's a bit on the expensive side
---
Too busy responding to little butthurt kids like you to explain. And after this immediate backlash I think the community is even more shit
---
Ew. The worst I've seen yet was from a duper/horribly built glitched trap camp with .38 at 30k per.
---
Pretty sure the person is just screwing around, but still.
---
They also had 26,170 Mr Fuzzy Tokens for 30k per.
---
Don’t we all want to attack the overseer at some
---
Point?
---
Relax kid
---
An hour after it comes back up : We're disabling vendors and display cases
---
Unprovoked
---
Noice
---
I was hoping Patch 20 would bring in some more variety for the faction dailies, I may have to wait another month or more...although who knows, roll on those Patch Notes and another 'Rocksie Road trip' or Vacuous Vacuum Vamp.
---
get atoms while you can?
---
When you lash out at people trying to help you (other comments, not mine), that's usually what you'll get. But so long, your post is gone and I can't help but hope you're not far behind.
---
It depends, One person using one is ok, but 5 or more is a nightmare for anyone trying to get rewards the legit way.
---
I have one and am aware of it, so after I get my damage I stop for a while to give time for anyone else.
---
"It's slippy out! Yeah!" God, I hate that little bastard.
---
It is, but it's handy in the long run. Very handy.
---
But it's still better than 1800 atoms for the Blackbird PA paint that only goes on the X01 suit. Oh, Bethesda!
---
I've seen some things saying It was useless for junk but was really funny. They were pretty old, has it been buffed or something?.
---
Big brain!
---
That is disgusting, the last trap base I ran into ended up being "destroyed by an unforeseen rain of two head deer" 😂
---
&gt; And I hate to say it, but you shouldn't have been able to buy all your shit with challenge atoms anyway, they needed a nerf. Think whatever you like about the atomic shop, but those payments keep this game running.
---
I wish more people thought like this. I just can't get mad about the changes to atom dailies.
---
You should really stop using pet names for people, it’s pretty condescending and patronizing and not helping your case at all. Also might explain your “experience so far”🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
---
There was one who tried to help. And I said I appreciate the feedback. The post was removed for not having a descriptive title. Not the words or opinion
---
I knew you'd notice.
---
The exact thing I've weierdly wanted the most. Figured I was the only one. 🤣
---
I know the new weapons have it just don't know if the og gauss rifle has it. I haven't gotten one in a very long time so I can't test it for myself hence why I said shoot it at your feet.
---
Bethesda said that most players who are just playing the game will get 1 tier per hour on the front end and 1 tier per 2 hours on the back end. Am I the only one who reads the ITVs?
---
i'd recommend against that idea, by the time the update goes live those dailies may have expired
---
Rather than making it a numbers game and opening up pissing contests for 1-shot wannabees how about using the already included damage numbers and have a progress bar moving red&gt;green as you approach the minimum needed. That way all you have is a pass mark rather than a race to be the first 1 second kill which would spoil it for every non-uber meta magic weapon glitch player.
---
Sad truth is sad.
---
I have one now but when I've started playing i didn't. I avoided fast travelling like hell. Or i would talk to someone often during a fast travel.  
---
Not gonna lie, being able to play on steam with the overlay browser also makes a hell of a difference.
---
I love when she sends me to watoga and then when I return says something about if she knew I was going there she would have had me grab other supplies...
---
Listen Wren you knew I was going, you marked it on my map...
---
You can't actually do any of those things to a person or a person's camp on a public team.
---
How can you trade those
---
They don't count as pistols!?
---
Also I don't know why they didn't do this with Polly's head. You can only use it in that one mine.. Why not make it stupid OP?
---
Its only useless if you're relying on it as your ONLY source of junk. But while you're off exploring and doing quests and stuff hes gathering junk for you. So it adds up and all you have to do is take ot from the little hatch behind his recharging station and toss it in your stash.
---
I have not heard of this glitch yet.
---
I'm sure your bro's in r/fallout will give you a big "Attaboy".
---
Well that was the point. Since all of you piled on with hate for an opinion. I was talking about the playerbase of 3 days that I have witnessed. Not the community, this is why I didn't say community. You all only heard what you wanted. These reactions have been pitiful and childish and emotional. Never seen anything like it. So yea I'll patronize the children. I certainly didn't mean the my post the way most took it. Not really gonna sit and be nice and explain while they all rant and moan about a misconception. Also I dont use a mic and play solo, as i stated so your comment has no merit.
---
Yeah since launch...
---
Also no matter how many times on multiple characters I catch sludge lung its at 21/22 diseases.
---
Also discover cranberry bog locations 4/5 because that damn workshop. I roll a new character every few months and try again...
---
Loosely describing an entire population segment of gamers HAHAHA
---
Fuckin' screws! 😒
---
Scorchbeasts do spawn inside the Glassed Cavern.
---
Oh man those half floors not being able to be properly walled...
---
There is a PC mod actually that highlights ore in general.  Haven't used it myself as wary of mods and if they are allowed.  But your idea is excellent!  PA shouldn't just be limited to battles, they need more utility!
---
You paid a high price for a game that you knew had multiple issues from a developer who had a less than stellar reputation for quickly solving them. Thats your fault not the game. I paid far, far less and actually look at what's really happening with the game and not use a crystal ball to slag off a patch that's not even released yet.
---
Is there any word about more mods for the SS armor?  I’ve got my fingers crossed!
---
Are you talking about daily challenges or daily quests?
---
Drop the nuke so the fissure is just in the circle and you can fight her right by the barn and without radiation.
---
Move your camp kit thing as far away from the cliff edge as you can
---
You can try moving the camp unit as far as possible to the other edge. But it doesn't always work.
---
That's not the case, I'm sure I'll enjoy the game. Was just speaking on my first experience. I also said that's what I heard was in the game so jokes on me. As in I should have expected it and it is what it is. Wasnt trying to shit on the community as a whole or just say it's a bad game. You all are just too emotional to think logically I suppose
---
I was joking heh :p (because you didn't say you cared about the ammo converter)  
---
being low on ammo is very common for many Ranged Characters. Even with the much beloved ArmCo Ammo machine in my camp some weapons just eats through ammo like all the automatic ones and even lots of the non-automatic like the Handmade, etc.   
---
One day i got like 2k 5.56 rounds. Went fighting the SBQ and then Encryptid and in an about an hour i had around 1k rounds O\_o And that was with a non-automatic handmade.  
---
The Ammo Converter will give us even more ammo for our desired weapons.
---
It is really annoying with Whitespring and the Rusty Pick. I thought they moved Murgrgh inside to make the location instanced but alas.
---
Building is pretty much all I do in the game. That, or whatever helps me procure plans. I think the devs should promote this lifestyle.
---
Daily quests...those won't expire after the update.
---
I was referring to the quests
---
Scorchbeasts spawn in the cavern, that's normal. As for the camp on the compass, it's likely showing you a nearby camp that's outside the cave. If there's actually a camp in there (can't see from the pictures if so) then that's not supposed to be there.
---
I was referring to the quests themselves, not the challenges.
---
Thx. Noticed people doing this a lot. Im guessing because some people have a ton of food and stuff &amp; their legendary armor helps weight loss.
---
Someone bought it from my vendor last night for 8K. Now you guys know if you get one you may be able to get more.
---
Yea I would be happy with any pose that incorporates the camera, but I don't think any exist yet
---
Not true, recently traded with a guy that had like 60k
---
This is true, but fences and tents increase how often it happens from my experience.
---
Shes large enough to bite people off the tents and fence but the broken AI see it more like they can't be reached and she just circles
---
Thanks. This char is only lvl 18 and not sure where I'm taking it. Just working on its backbone right now. My main is a lvl 200 bloodied power armor heavy gunner. It eats queens for breakfast. Bloodied ffr 90rw plasma caster plus gun-fu plus grim reaper's sprint = one shot 99% of enemies. For the other 1% there is my bloodied gauss mini. 
---
Only thing I know for sure is that my new character won't be grinding reputation ever.
---
I mean... I’d like to see them fix the thing first.
---
From what I can see, people keep asking 'How were you griefed?' and you keep responding with 'Blahblahblah Proving my point about a shit community' - Are you surprised people are mad at you for lashing out at them when they're asking for the barest minimum of information? xD
---
I’ve been playing for three months and as far as I know everything is like Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.
---
Yeah, figured as much haha. That might be a solid choice.
---
I'm pretty sure a raid is 
---
1 Break in
---
2 steal all you can carry
---
3 leave
---
Fallout 76's version
---
1 enter
---
2 fix our shit
---
3 here's a meager reward
---
4 the boot
---
that pic reminds me of the ending of The Blair Witch Project...Ooooo..
---
Used to be worse but back then we could cripple her wings
---
That's a hell of a good pic, dang. Well done.
---
If you have a weapon equipped when you enter photo mode, you can go to the pose option, select a pose and switch back to "none" again and you'll be aiming the weapon for a few seconds. Not sure if it works with the camera because I haven't tried that, but I've done some photos this way with my character aiming his gun.
---
2ks good. With the BH dlc i expect an uptick
---
Yep I bought the armor a few days ago for this reason. Ok since we know the stats, do we know the cost of bullion for the Shielded  plan?
---
Oh I've played since launch. But I still can never remember some of these things. I play for the fun and can't wrap my head around these technical things haha
---
The Vault raids were before my time so I'd love to see the Vaults re-open and be repurposed. From everything I saw, the raids were... not good, but I'd be satisfied if they were simply high level dungeons that required teamwork.
---
Actually I didn't really respond to anyone who asked that. Or if I did they asked after their barrel of hatred. I was too busy responding to all the hate of an opinion to get to that. You all took my post the wrong way, I did not expect any of this. If I did I would have added an extra paragraph and worded it more carefully. How do you expect someone to react when they have only witnessed hate from so far, share that opinion and receive mostly hate for it? Lol its ridiculous
---
Ohh no, they listened and went back to the drawing board.
---
And if they would of released crap you'd be here complaining how its shitty.
---
Damned if they do damned if they don't.
---
If you're so miserable and unhappy with the game go play something you enjoy.
---
Bethesda makes lots of mistakes, the game has its issues but they didn't just cut and run.
---
What's your agility rank
---
The whole map will act like a nuke zone, this being a mistake from them trying to nerf radiation suits!
---
You mean the "advanced" version? If so, it was available few months ago for f1st.
---
Yeah more like this, I think the spiral staircase would glitch out and you would get stuck on things that aren't there like the one in the Flatwoods church
---
It's a shame the secret service jetpack can't have the jetpack skins, that red rocket one would have looked great with this!
---
Why is this so funny in my head?
---
You spawn roughly half a camp radius north of you Camp unit. It can be a bit hit and miss but its usually possible with a bit of trial and error to move it around and find yourself a more suitable fast travel point.
---
i’m in bethesda only on this account, i do have a steam account as well
---
It's since been fixed iirc
---
That and an elevator would be nice
---
I would assume if they do add them to the atom shop, it would probably skip a season before we see them. For instance, season 1 items would show up in the store during season 3 and so on
---
Oh I see... Well I mostly use a Bloodied 10mm pistol and I'm carrying over 40k rounds because people practically give 10mm Ammo away.
---
Also I'm not a fan of the way this Ammo conversion system works. With coupons or whatever that you can only trade towards your preferred Ammo up to a certain amount per day. It should just be a workbench where you trade a certain amount of Ammo A towards Ammo B. No limits.
---
Better be that good shit
---
I totally agree on rusty pick, but honestly there’s a bunch of places just like this.
---
Set at 14. With unyielding gear, mutations and road leathers: 36
---
This maybe a stupid question, but since you mentioned the Marathoner perk, is your agility at 15? 
---
That's the max for all SPECIALs to do with perk cards.
---
Man Polly's head was a pain, as fully charged it does worse damage than a lv 1 pipe pistol!
---
yeah that would be good
---
I'd call it skepticism given the lack of information and the way folk go out of their way to demonize 76. But if you're being serious and honest, now's the time to go on ahead and say what griefing you experienced.   
---
I'll try and help if I can.
---
Did you play through the story line with them?
---
I guarantee if your tone wasn’t so brash, you would have had 5+ people coming to your aid, offering you supplies, help, tips, protection, etc etc. But alas, you came at it extremely negatively and in an incredibly subjective way with no objective information to help expand on your post. You wouldn’t even tell the sub what kind of issues you’ve been having to see if they have some help to offer you? 
---
When I was a Level 6 I got a quest to get a workshop or defend it or something and I got shot down by a Level 10. I had no idea why because I was in pacifist. Guess what I did? Posted on the subreddit, explained what happened. You and know what happened next? Someone explained workshop mechanics to me and then offered to team up with me so I could complete the quest safely. 
---
My next thought applies to not only this subreddit but also the adult world: if you approach with kindness and patience, you’ll be greeted with kindness and patience.
---
If you want to express your opinion, that’s fine. But know your audience and be prepared to face differing opinions. And when they come (which they will), act like a mature adult without name calling and insults.
---
I want a carry weight buff on the power armor
---
Preston Garvey approves of this message..
---
Yeah, and bloodied builds as well. Rad management is tough for them I'm guessing.
---
Oh. Don't get me wrong. Player Interacting with Player is great. I love that aspect of the game. But I don't like the versus aspect. The fighting is what causes people to become toxic and negative. I like running into other players because generally they are friendly. And it's pretty nice. But when it comes to fighting, it's a whole other ballgame.
---
It’s available at Welch station
---
You just know everyone would screenshot anyway and make a leader board by the backdoor. I wouldn't mind a few more stats in the game but not in the SBQ.
---
The fact that Bethesda didn't even think to allow people to get into factions is just surprising.
---
Magic weapons don't deal nearly the same damage as hacked weapons.
---
Oh yeah that makes sense.
---
added you maintenance is in an hour
---
It would be easier to use the assualtron head that way but it wouldn't make sense. The assaultron robot itself (say an assaultron dominator \[cause everyone loves those\]) can shoot it's head laser beam continously because it's attached to it's body. It has more place to pull power from. Meanwhile we just use it's head.
---
Although I'm not opposed to having an assaultron body as a weapon.
---
Sometimes in laggy servers the loot takes a solid minute to show up for me, might be the problem there.
---
Yeah that does the regular weapon ready pose but not the aim down sights pose unfortunately 
---
Since the camera isn't an actual weapon it doesn't have a "weapon ready" pose, so it just goes back to the relaxed pose where you hold the camera in your hand by your hip
---
Probably
---
Well I dont frequent this thread and havent played the game til recently so I have no part in that. If that's the case, the responses make a little more sense. Though it doesn't justify them or attacking a new player who's had a bad experience thus far. That behavior is a good way to perpetuate the demonizing of the game and players. (My opinion). I appreciate the offer. I thought griefing was a more general term, perhaps it's more defined in this game. Again, I'm new to the game and community here. I've had a slew of incidents, from high level players taking leading me far from start just stick a gun in my face and log out so I'm in a dangerous area with enemies all around. I've had players run to my call for help when down just to run around me and shoot my body. Send team invites just to get me to go to them and kick me right before I get there. And more that really doesn't matter. Not sure there's help to be given. It was just my experience, which has been different than what I've read on here. Reading all the good stories helped push me to buy the game. But I thought in contrast I should share my experience which has not been that.
---
Exactly! It's honestly so nice that the custom when new players run into each other in *76* mostly seems to be to do the waving emote, versus bracing to be shot at or run down in *GTA*.
---
No, my agility was at 3
---
Have you actually gone up one in game?  Like in a church steeple?  They suck, you fall down really easy...
---
A right angle stair that only takes up one block would be better IMO.
---
Console here so all mods are off limits to me. Id be willing for it to be utility piece and sit at the bottom of protection ratings if it had all those other applications like weight, higher yields and detection.
---
The trophies were definitely bugged for people who carried over BETA characters. My BETA toon grew up to now be over level 500. I finally started a new character about one week ago so I could be rewarded some of the early game trophies such as leave Vault 76 and reach level 10. I’m over level 500, I’m pretty sure I’ve already left the vault...
---
I need to be able to give this comment 10 upvotes .. lol...  Reddit should do better 😁
---
Loosely? Lol.
---
Hope a system like this is never added

---
Oh man. Lost my excavation armor as soon as I made it. 
---
It was early on, took me days to scrounge all the materials.
---
Hrm. Definitely strange. If it doesn't fix itself, I'd get in touch with BGS support. Pretty pointless to level up and not get what you need.
---
Go map! Mark it mark it!
---
a transfer option would alleviate storage issues for people who want to mule. it should be added to the game, its a basic QoL feature, people who whine about new characters being able to access anything you send from your high level characters can just not use the feature.  people already transfer all the time, might as well make it a full feature and make it more safe and accessible to everyone.
---
this game isnt a fuckin survival game, it never was. it just had some survival elements tossed in. this game is a looter/shooter with lite rpg elements. the limited stash is due to technical limitations, not some grand survival design.
---
Maybe the ones who actually have mags in their vending machines have temporarily closed up shop because they are close to or at max caps (like me). 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
So is that 10:25 now?
---
😀
---
Always wondered about that but never bothered to check. Thank you
---
I collected 2 a few min ago. You can have them if you want
---
There's a storyline?
---
Ahh ok. Idk since I'm still fresh (first play, L49) and I just saw the other day where people have underground camps lol.
---
I agree but I would also like to display them still..
---
How much do you want for them
---
now you done did it
---
So I am not a duper but I was wondering if any one else was having trouble with there account.  I'm just asking?
---
Last week I got a ton of plans gifted to me after I gave people costumes for free,
---
A lot were stacks of multiples 
---
So I decided to break into other players camps and leave plans on their beds.
---
I eventually came upon a camp where a open door was locked so after I left the plans,
---
I picked the door to close it, 
---
Needless to say don't underestimate the value of ten caps to vault dwellers.
---
But in the end the door was closed with respect.
---
Yep still do and only pipe revolvers and bolt action
---
Nothing. I have no use for them
---
Magic weapons are not the ones doing this, check any video of someone using a magic weapon to solo a Queen and it still will take time. Hacked weapons (ie. Handmades with literal 5000 damage pet shot) are the greatest problem on PC and godmode is the biggest one on consoles.
---
Shhhhh...Pipe is life
---
Yes they still stack. But only revolver and bolt action.  Not the regular pipe guns.
---
Hit up the Wendigo Cave
---
I’m right there with you on the 4/5 for the cranberry bog, but I’ve completed the different kinds of diseases
---
Ok well first, I appreciate the time you put into a detailed response. But my post was not meant the way it was taken. I wasnt subjective and didn't make any general or blanket statements. I was speaking about my experience so far. Wasnt knocking the game or the community. I spoke of what I had noticed so far, which has been disappointing as the title stated. Immediately after I got a wave of hate. I had no time to d eww al with each one respectively, notifications every second. Mostly hate. Saying I have witnessed only hate then receiving hate for it...that's not gonna get them a nice fleshed out explanation. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who responds like that doesn't deserve the time of day. There were so many at a time I couldnt give you all my time right away. I believe you were one who started out just asking for details. I planned on getting to it or just adding an edit since more were asking. My post was meant as harmless, but yes came from frustration and disappointment. Doesn't mean I hate the game or all players. Just sharing my experience. Didn't know it would hurt people's emotions so much lol
---
It's been a while fore me but when you play through the game you end up investigating them some and end up at wendigo cave. I could say more but might be spoilers for some people
---
Go to the cabins at the north side of the new river gorge bridge.  There are always bloatflys there.
---
By the time I talked to her I was at COOPERATIVE with the raiders at about 75 percent. When I told her I  was keeping all the gold, it went to COOPERATIVE 50 percent (I'm estimating btw). Apart from everytime you go to the crater Meg talks to you like you just stole of her gold (because you did). Apart from that it's worth it.
---
Oh, I stand corrected then. That's just what I've been told, sorry for the misinformation there. I never use rad-x, diluted or not. 😂
---
Actually you won't be- I picked it up over the weekend and used it quite well. In terms of core building kits I really rate it, and the decor you get with it (curtains etc) makes things feel less.... Bare....
---
Powering up Poseidon 2.0 ;-)
---
I can’t wait for the hundreds of posts demanding second by second updates from Bethesda and talk about it’s the only online game that has these issues.  Followed by cries for cancelling FO1st
---
I hate when someone drops a loot full of spoiled crap at my camp.
---
Hmmm, those are some really atypical forms of griefing if you'd call them that. Some of them seem like the sort of thing you'd have to assume given how poor 76 is with player to player communication - Maybe they did intend to do something for you and something came up that dragged them away? Either way it's not too much of an issue, no matter where you are on the map you can fast travel back to Vault 76 free of charge.   
---
The second is really interesting to me, I know from my own experience that people will often shoot your body when you're down to signify that they can't help you up and that you should just hit tab to end the waiting timer. Usually it means they don't have a stimpak or they can't spare one.  
---
The team invite one is usually used by people looking for group exp benefits and free fast travel without actually forming their own team. It's kind of a dick move to just use someone else who's playing the game as an EXP buff (You get more in groups with the right perks) - But some people will do that, go and invite randoms just for the boost and assume they'll keep playing solo on their own. That said, I don't know if I'd call it griefing though, I'm guessing they expected you to just keep playing solo while contributing to their bonus.
---
Check out Angry Turtle's video on it. It explains just about everything regarding AP and regen speeds. [Linky](https://youtu.be/EA1Svkvpw6I)
---
with meg as the leader, i don't feel the crater raiders are evil.
---
Do they really sell like that?
---
I don’t think the daily quests have anything to do with SCORE. My understanding is that it’ll give you new daily and weekly challenges—which previously awarded Atoms. Haven’t seen anything indicating that it affects daily quests.
---
Usually offline 14.5 hours from now but I could definitely be wrong.
---
 I meant vaporizing a sqb in seconds is possible. Doesn't matter if it 10k or 100k dammage per sec if all you need is 8k. Random ass numbers since your so obsessed with numbers.
---
If you are mutated use diluted Rad X instead. It's not as good, but normal Rad X suppresses your mutations.
---
I keep forgetting to check if Radshield suppresses them or not. Damn chems have destroyed my short term memory. 😅☠
---
The best is when he sends me to find it and the search area is right on top of Foundation.
---
“All hail ambassador Tenebrate!!!” :D
---
Oh no. there goes my chance to get another mounted boatfly.
---
There is advanced power connectors and one of them is a wall one. It’s tricky. I’ve had better success with the advanced power connector that goes in the ceiling. Let me see if I can find a picture for you.
---
Get excavator pa and hit lucky hole mine for lead. Hit toxic Larry’s and hemlock and kill the snallys and grafton for acid and uranium fever to scrap guns for steel man. Easy and fun
---
I literally just got it after grinding all day. Now i need wood to play with it a bit. Disappointed the porch is ground level only but like you said the floors walls dont look as bare surface thats a huge plus. Been buying up plans for an epic build lol. Had an enormous 8 story tower by Helvetia for a while. A tiny store with windows so visitors could look but not touch lol.
---
Just annoying how much camp limit they use.
---
I dont think they’re removing it. I think they’re just removing the event they were planning that involved it. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong. Been on vacation for a week🙃
---
It’s broken for everybody. I’ve killed her solo many times, still hasn’t counted.
---
There are two ways, the legitimate way is with the through-wall connector from the advanced power connectors plan, it looks like }
---
If you don't have that it's a bit more complicated, but still possible
---
Place a connector right in the border between the two walls, one on each side of the wall
---
Destroy one wall with either a flamethrower trap or getting a friend to do it (I'll make you a conduit or flamethrower trap if on Xbox)
---
Place a connector on the inner wall of the one you destroyed, perpendicular to the other two
---
Connect all three then repair the wall
---
If you are on Xbox let me know if you need a hand :) I'll be free in a bit
---
You can get them by random chance by nuking a place in Appalachia. They were never removed. Just the event "A Colossal Problem" was.
---
Mine always sell...not all at once tho...someone is always buying a few here and there. :)
---
I’m surprised I put up with as much as I did back then
---
It's like you've lived through this!
---
Thanks!
---
Awesome!  Thanks!
---
What do they go for and do you sell them at the same price? Ive been collecting for a few months waiting to get a full collesction and starting a comic shop
---
I just hope there aren't any Nuclear Winter challenges. Especially if there are NW challenges like 'Kill X Players' or 'Win X Matches'. I'm terrible at NW and those types of challenges would be the biggest chore.
---
Happy to help! Hope you see one soon! I’ve only seen one and it was stupid fun.
---
Place a sign from the wall decor category on a wall near the generator. Place a wall power connector on the sign. Connect the power connector to the generator. Pick up the sign (the p.connetor should also get grabbed). Move the sign slightly on the wall and let it go. Now you should be able to grab the sign/ connector and move it anywhere in your camp. The wire should pass through everything and can be as long as needed. I hope I explained that ok. If not I can try again.
---
Np man.
---
It's a balance truly but I still feel it's a worthwhile kit. I've heard peeps doing the wrap around porch find it adding up pretty fast, I've not used it for that purpose yet.
---
Well, see I dont know the game so I couldnt assume that. I did take all of that into account, it is possible. While there were enemies attacking me I couldnt fast travel, or at least where I was trying to between getting hit. Lvl 200 without a stimpak I guess is possible as well but why'd they run to me just to say hit tab. I would of guessed that if they didn't show up lol. Either way, yes maybe griefing was a poor choice of words. All of it was just to say I'm disappointed how it's gone so far. I made the point that it broke my immersion, which I understand it's an online game and will happen. It just highlighted the other little annoyances in the game so I mentioned them. My post wasnt meant to come across harsh or at the community. I put the jokes on me as a little light hearted statement saying yea yea I should have expected this. Other than that I've seen so little so I'm sure there's many a great things in the game and players to meet. Personally I dont think anything excuses the reaction I got. But it's all good, haters are gonna hate no matter what. If you look at it from my perspective maybe you can see how all of that did further prove my point on some players in this game and why I would say that. Which is better than indulging in  some pretty comment war over nothing. But thank you for your input and help, I appreciate it
---
The Queen has 32.767 Health Points, you need about four times 8k to kill her. Mirelurk Queem has 2k health and, as you can see in Turtle's video a magic weapon takes some time to kill a Queen, enough time for a hacked weapon to kill the Queen twice.
---
I mean... in my defense, they drop the juicy loot. And I play pretty much only with an MMG so it feels like a fair fight. Right?! Right?!?
---
I keep no turrets and lighting to a minimum to help with the big builds.
---
Living in West Virginia, and vacationing in some if the places, i can attest to the amazing attention to details that the Bethesda team put into it all.  
---
I live this game.  Glitches and all.
---
I believe there is a wiki map that shows the possible spawn locations for the Wendigo Colossus when the area is nuked. Unfortunately there's only a six to perhaps 10% chance that one will spawn.
---
Awesome thank you guys, ima move the camp unit.
---
Ash/goo piles too
---
After reading that I realize I could've explained that a bit better. If you need I can go into more detail. Or go on YouTube and look up "fallout 76 wires through walls". That should help.
---
I don't know. It would make sense for Appalachia to be revealed to be completely decimated due to the amount of nukes launched to fight the Scorched.
---
I thought only 94 opened up? when did 96 and 63 open up? did i miss that?
---
I like it! Yeah if you consider it against the normal kits it's pretty solid. I still love my metal exterior though, however my interior has been made contemporary now.
---
So, no survival game,  maybe just a hint of pretending to be a rpg?
---
lol at people who think this game a "survival" game
---
lmao so hard to survive.
---
stash limits are because of server lag lol saying its because of the game being survival is such a crock of shit. you can only have so much scrap... until they sell you the ability to have unlimited, your gear breaks... until they sell you a way to repair them, cant make it back to camp? use this convenient "survival" tent... some survival game lmao. its just bullshit mental gymnastics justifying crappy game design
---
a transfer option would solve 98% of peoples storage problems without lagging the shit out of the servers.

The Event, 'A Colossal Problem' is being reworked after feedback from players on the PTS. The colossus itself is still a rare spawn in certain areas when nuked.
---
I’ll never get the croc backpack in the game so I might as well try to buy one in real life lol
---
Make the damage buffs that are 5%, 25% so that they can compete better with stuff like 20% stash size. and also Vault 76 should have a ability to travle to ALL vaults for free. and also they should be able to do the Vault 94 so that they are worth it.
---
Thanks for the reply, Ill get some sleep then, hah
---
craft it.. this way you only have it when youre making bullets
---
Are commie whackers rare?
---
Oh I brought it, completely agree it’s a worthwhile kit. Just annoying how much of your limit gets used up with the curtains. I’m going to have the porch just at the front of my house. I’ll do a rebuild after I see what the rewards for this upcoming season are so I get a bit of an idea on what I want for my layout.
---
Great info!
---
Take a Rad X to suppress your mutations and check it out by having someone with Speed Demon active run/walk beside you.
---
PA movement speed is a little glitchy though. I move faster with the camera equipped while using it. Might be related, might not.
---
I've seen them priced between 25-200caps...I personally sell mine for 75-85 caps a pop, which tend to sell at that price point in my experience (I think my prices are fair) Also, I think it's great your'e collecting them and starting a comic shop...that would be awesome!! I've proudly collected all of them myself (I can't display them tho, my camp budget is maxed lol). So good luck!!! :)
---
with a little bit of fashion show and architecture thrown in for spice...
---
You are the man, found the plans and this fixed it! I'm on ps4 or I'd love to team up. Thanks again!
---
10amEDT
---
I’m selling some on my other character I think. I haven’t been on it in a while so I gotta check. I’ll be on in like an hour or so if you’re looking to buy some. My psn is III6535III.
---
Radshield does not supress. Very handy to keep around.
---
Todd feeds off suffering
---
They're not removing it, they delayed it.
---
Glad you got it :) that and the conduit pipe things make wiring so much easier lol
---
*How badly do I need this item that I've been hoarding for 30 levels*
---
When you hot swap
---
to a favorited weapon, but the game unequips your weapon instead.
---
Wait
---
Just type "10am EDT in [insert your timezone here]" on Google.
---
The only other thing I would look at, is diseases. My guy has 13 agi, a complete set of uy, only one piece of ap refresh, and only one rank of action boy. It only takes a second to refill his bar. But, lord help you if you get shell shock. Or perhaps you encountered the bug that doubles your uy buffs, and broke the game.
---
I could be wrong. I could be. But I think you can go wild on your time off. My reasoning being they said each level will take 1-2 hours of game play. I feel like if it was time-gated they wouldn’t have explained it that way. 
---
Again, I could be wrong. Hoping for yalls sake I’m right though!
---
Edit: Also, they said that it would be here until September. Even if that means September 30, that’s only 93 days and there’s 100 levels.
---
Edit: Also, they said you can earn points through events and quests. Another hint that’s it’s not time-gated. I’m getting more confident in my theory!
---
What problem did they have with it? What was the feedback?
---
All I heard is that the event had become a massive screws farm.
---
Oh FFS nm I literally said random numbers and you nitpick..... Go circlejerk and have fun. I'm done
---
It's the only reason I even made any toons. It's even less appealing now with bullion involved.
---
I'm considering just quitting the game honestly.  I'm gonna feel like I have to grind seasons (cause what else is there to do) and I just don't think it's worth it.    
---
Might just be time to move on.
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
I hope so too. It sucks enough that there is a daily cap and scrip limit so we have to sit on so much junk and legendaries, I don't want to also have to fight to accomplish this.
---
Hopefully a new dupe
---
Yes and it was amazing! I was using my TS grenade launcher and the bug didnt require me to reload! It was a semi auto TS launcher and I want it back lol
---
I don't think you know what nitpick and circlejerk mean.
---
10000% agree with you!!
---
You're actually incorrect because regular pipe rifles and pistols use rifleman and gunslinger. I don't know where you got the info that they don't but I actually use pipe weapons. And yes you are correct in that pipe revolvers use both rifleman and gunslinger EVEN when modified to pipe revolvers rifle
---
But obviously only pipe rifles use rifleman and pipe pistols use gunslinger
---
I think if they time gate that too then they better be prepared for a massive loss in players because everyone is pretty much past their tolerance of that already. I really dont think it will be time gated either. Like you, I think we can grind it as much as we care to each session.
---
Either the game takes longer still loading each server at a time looking for a camp spot that’s open while keeping you at the main menu, which people will complain about, or it goes about its current way. I’m fine with the current way.
---
All we know is that daily and weekly challenges, earned XP and public events will grant SCORE points. It doesn’t sound like there’s going to be a daily limit, just a limited number of daily challenges, so you’ll have to do more than just those.
---
Last night, when Ward told me that they had plenty, after i returned it... that pissed me off. 😆
---
Xbox?
---
Stop. Trying. To. Get. Vending. Machines. Taken. Out.
---
We try and do the daily and weekly changes everytime we play, except for the NW ones as well don't really play that.  We are also trying to grind as many of the other challenges in combat, social, and world as of late.
---
I hate battle passes.  Even warframe's Nightwave irks me, and that's a babbymode battlepass
---
It’s worst because at least you feel like you’re actually helping someone in fallout 4.
---
They both have Hardened Receivers, I think Piercing mags, suppressors and whatever else is best for max range and reduction in recoil. I have the recipe for the Hardened .50 cal but not a lot of ammo for it; maybe 100 rounds I crafted once before I got Ammosmith.  
---
Should I carry both Rifles then and switch according to an armored vs. unarmored enemy?  
---
I'm a solo player so I have to stop and hide when I see an enemy on the compass and guage the area.  
---
I'm not sure where to go for other perks other than maxing out Rifleman. I have 1 perk point to use and was thinking about Long Shot. I do have a couple of 2 star legendary armor pieces and the rest is regular. The Chameleon effect along with Marsupial is awesome for my playstyle.  
---
Per your last paragraph......I don't understand why 'everyone' makes a build for max level and endgame with all these legendary gear but none are guaranteed drops that I've found. I'm sure all that takes a crazy amount of mats to keep upgraded and maintianed.
---
i’m not, im simply trying to make bethesda realize they need to fix them
---
You shouldn't have to worry I think they said this is intentional unlike the meathook was.
---
Not true, you can do it at any camp where you get to the vendor before its completely loaded in, so fast traveling cross map is one way to do it
---
Oh your playing a Bethesda game, you don't actually upload it you just tell her your going to with the game in your inventory. So literally its just dialog lol. Maybe something unique if you get all the games but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Sorry if I wasn't clear I meant you upload it to her console as thats what the dialog implies  but forgot to mention you don't actually do it.
---
TLDR
---
\-You get the game
---
\-You tell her you found the game
---
\-She says thank you for it
---
\-She does remember which games given so won't give option to give same one multiple times
---
\-Your character says your going to upload it to her console but you don't actually do it
---
Hahaha Did a SBQ today and got a 1* Nocturnal Wood Leg so ridiculous for the 1k of 556
---
No diseases on me. 
---
Takes 5 secs to completely refresh. 
---
What’s this bug you referring to?
---
Our characters are burning a lot of calories and sweating a lot because of the constant movement and fighting. So it does drain their water and food faster. We adventure and carry lots of weight during our gameplay. Our characters should be able to starve or be deprived of water for longer still, but I do get the consumption speed of our resources. Sometimes after an update they drain almost instantly, so those bugs need to be fixed.
---
Here, I slapped a quick potatoe clip together showing this method.    https://youtu.be/zgiTfExkKKo
---
you can P.A. glitch into them all. Ive tried.and sucseeded
---
Just give him your “bone saw” 😉
---
Lol idk if I trust giving anyone my bloodied powerfist. I can just push to level up a few times this week. A minor inconvenience, really.
---
I eat 5 servings of chicken. 5 birds.
---
Yeah, we predicted that months before wastelanders even came out. What exactly were you expecting for a game that has even less story potential than fo4?
---
Thanks! 16:00 it is
---
You can change the wall to a window (when selected there's an option to change wall type), and pull a cord through the window. Then just change the wall back to solid.
---
I certainly didn’t expect to massacre an entire band of Blood Eagles for a damn moist saw.
---
I mean it would need to load the map/server to actually know that your spot is taken
---
Also keep in mind this is just the time when they'll take the server down to push the update, meaning it might take from an hour to three before you can play.
---
I've killed two in the last two days.  Both spawn in the cranberry grove right next to the queen.  Weird that I only start seeing them now.  RNG is a bitch.
---
"Those darn raiders, always stealing our shit.."
---
You, in full raider attire:Yeah, those raiders amiright fellow settler? Now, about those gold notes...
---
Thats fine, from that time on Ill check until its available
---
having amazingly trash internet atm so just want to start the download asap so I know I can play it the day after the patch! Thanks for the heads up though :)
---
I'm not sure how to duplicate it, but there have been times when I've miraculously have 43 agility/luck , and it doesn't seem like I really have either. Apparently there's a bug I've seen referenced on this sub that causes that.
---
One big change that has helped my inventory management and food/drink levels has been the hold the button to consume option. That’s been nice. Now I just drink eat everywhere and never think twice about it.
---
This. 
---
If you travel to other players camp you can see this effect by looking at the compass when you arrive and 90% of the time you are north of the camp placement. 
---
Always best to set the camp module while facing north to roughly estimate the spawn location. Use 3rd person camera to spin your view and see the total placement of your circle as well before placing the camp module.
---
I’m not a Commie but I guess I never level up naked on Deathclaw Island wielding a protest sign again.
---
Hey, was wondering where you got this info from? Is there any changelogs floating around?
---
Deal!
---
If you suicide and join back into the world you get double unyielding effects until you die again.  You are right, it is a known bug.
---
“It just Works”
---
&gt; Further dumbing down one of the few survival systems we have isn't going to increase enjoyment, it's only going to make even more of the game's content inconsequential.
---
I'll stop you right there. It already is inconsequential. It isn't even remotely a challenge. It barely even qualifies as a nuisance. It's just a chore to check off on top of everything else. Using food for buffs is pretty pointless because even with an atom shop freezer it still spoils too quickly while you're out doing other things. It weighs far too much for what it provides you. Most end-game builds do not need to worry about healing outside of combat, and for those that do, super stimpaks and nuka quantums are far superior to any food item. Tracking down specific foods for their bonuses is pretty much exclusively done for something stupid like min-maxing damage to kill the sbq in under a minute. The only real exception is glowing meat, since it's easy enough to find and just happens to have a benefit that's useful to some people.
---
It took them nearly two years, but they're starting to realize that trying to incorporate survival mechanics while also dumbing everything down to baby's first mmo doesn't work well. Just like they realized trying to incorporate pvp into it doesn't work out well. Now let's see how long it takes them to figure out that trying to put new restrictions to regulate the economy before getting rid of cheaters is a waste of time
---
Wow I’d never heard of the munitions factory til I read your post earlier. I checked it out, kept dying from the mutants but someone nearby helped me out and I was able to take it! We joined up and when I had to leave I turned it over to my new teammate.
---
I’d really like to see the building aspect get a couple of key tweaks: ceilings, interior walls, spiral stairs, and blueprinting of complex things to work. Ever.
---
Honestly that would be perfect. It only had to take up on foundation piece, and could easily be placed in corners.
---
The children should develop a higher resistance to radiation but are vulnerable to the elements and other dangerous creatures.
---
The unofficial patches fix trivial stuff, not game breaking bugs
---
Gold. We do this to fuel our insatiable greed for consumer goods. Even if those "goods" are classified as high-end firepower that could man an army...
---
Head canon: Ward is a serial killer and this is how he gets off.
---
Alternative theory: Ward being a former raider, he is the organized crime of foundation and he purposely lets someone steal it so they can be offed and we are his hitmen.
---
2 custom fitted legs would give you 10% less AP cost while sprinting.  Its something anyway.
---
or would be elitist, if you don't have x build you can't participate and be awere that they will find a way to mess with you if you don't hit the x minimum amount of damage that they wanted exactly like MMOs raids are.
---
This is the best and easiest way, for sure.  Can also use a door instead of a window to get different angles.
---
And what legendary effects does that MMG have? Hm? Oh and what armor do you use? Also originally we would have traded that loot. But nooooo you attacked us outright.
---
That's a good idea too but I really want Sunny and some hoagies
---
Finally, someone with the guts to help
---
Not gonna lie, this makes me want to protect the mole people.
---
The damn door to the hellroom in Westek gets me all the time.
---
I need to start combing that area when someone starts the scorched earth event.
---
Because the PC is SS he/she is the outlier as they are only as corrupted as you are. But both Mechanists, the ant-agonist, and the Mistress of Mystery are all corrupted in some way. 
---
I really feel for the Mistress though, as she's the only unstoppable who was the original pre and post war.
---
Not OP but this is helpful, thanks!
---
I found 3 in one location lol like they were all next to one another! Not sure the name , but it’s where the taxidermy mission is , in that area.
---
I love that the radroach can find my sneaky bloodied chameleon fixer chick, the queen ignores me shootung her.
---
Best post of all time
---
I read months ago that the idea is that there is still story to be told about the queen and they are saving that just like what we saw in wastelanders with the overseers holotapes.  
---
Once that story/quest releases we'll be able to check that achievement off the screen.
---
It's a great place to take for getting ammo until you can max rep with the raiders!
---
I rp too hard for that. My camp is a fortress. But thanks for the idea :)
---
New player here for me atm it's almost 2k caps. That's a lot of street corners I'd have to work lol
---
How do you find it without a quest? Just swiping the whole map in hopes of catching a signal or is there some other way?
---
She only sends me to the prison and the mall for those things. I'm sure the mall has a crate of them I could make off with...
---
For the bog regions, just create a new character and try to fast travel to someone's camp near where you need to go to get it to load. They fixed it for new characters but if you already discovered it and it didn't register you can't on your character. As for diseases, I believe if you have a different disease then get the one you need it is supposed to work. I never had problems with that one personally.
---
Maybe you should stop sending ex-raider members to live in Foundation, and then stuff would stop being stolen...
---
Yeah there’s a storyline for all the raider groups previously occupying appalachia. Just have to read and listen for it.
---
I find enjoyment in making my character eat spoiled food
---
Thats probably where I fucked up hahaha
---
I've tried the bog one about a month ago new character didn't work.
---
As for diseases I thought you couldn't catch more then 1 at a time but I'll try that.
---
Each special caps at 15... are you trying to go above that?
---
I’ve had this happen before. Once it was just because the quest had become de-selected in my pip boy. The other time the only way I fixed it was by someone else joining the event and progressing it for us.
---
I was wondering this to, I was thinking maybe you need to land the final shot on her.
---
Haha yeah b it actually is a good story, the story of the diehards are about mega crew before they came back. A lot of little details like that really rounded it out for me. Happy trails
---
The [weaver of lies himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hefget/cmv_siding_with_foundation_makes_you_more_of_a/), Ward, cares not for the bone saw, but only for the death and destruction you leave in your wake, vault dweller.
---
Yes please eat from containers
---
You can't catch more than one at a time, it will supercede the one you have which is how you get it to trigger I believe. The location one was fixed with Wastelanders. I finally got it on my alt when they fixed it, but knowing Bethesda it could be broken again.
---
The scrapbox fixes the whole inventory management game. That's why it should be a base game feature
---
It doesn’t drop from enclave events.  Those are classified as toxic valley events.
---
If you want the scout masks you have to get lucky doing savage divide events.  Messenger qualifies as savage divide no matter his location.
---
Making a second comment to this wonderful post bc I just realized what I want to do with this idea. I'm going to protect the mole miners BUT, while I do so, I'm also going to turn on my mic and breathe into it obnoxiously. That way I get vengeance for the moles and myself for all the times I had to map hop to get away from the mic breathers. Thanks op, I have a purpose in life now!
---
I've heard it only happens to those that exploited the camp budget. So assuming that's true. If you didn't do any of that, you're fine.
---
My build functional objects reset to 0/7600
---
Can we not encourage douchebags from melting the queen with hacked and magic weapons.
---
It's unarmed not one handed
---
Hm,intruiging
---
See if occurs on another character
---
As long as your venders are far from the fast travel spawn, it should be fine. From what I understand the exploit used the load in time from fast travel while being near a vender.
---
Thank you
---
Thanks maybe next time I should just wait.
---
The Cult of the Mole Miner has begun!
---
I like it, but I'd wait. I still have 1010 atoms after I bought the mothman bundle. I'm really digging the gas mask and backpack. Too lazy to set up the wallpaper but I'll get around to it eventually
---
I am so glad I am done with both Foundation and Crater. I have zero reason to do their daily's anymore and I don't have to listen to Ward, Wren, or Rocksy ever again.
---
It does not change the interior appearance of the ceiling.
---
Almost every time I go looking for Ward. He's asleep in his trailer. I rarely see him actually working. Lazy bastard probably is out drinking Nukashine with that Samuel character. Every now and then Samuel is standing there naked in tighty whiteys. Glitch I think not! Talk about a wicked night out and wake up naked. At least offer me a Nukashine too!
---
First add some aliens then an arbiter and a few old evil aliens and BOOM fallout covenant
---
How so?

I need Half walls and half floors badly..

She lands more frequently if people get off the bunker and get out in the open. Especially whoever she's currently aggro'd on, which is typically the person dealing the most damage. If that person sits on the bunker, she won't land as much and won't stay on the ground.
---
It isn't that someone is shooting her with quad heavy weapons while she's in the air. It's that they're doing so while standing somewhere she can't land.
---
Do you use serendipity?
---
Where are you positioning yourself when you fight her? Because it does make a massive difference. It also matters if you're running a stealth build, because without a target to aggro on, she's less likely to land.
---
AD FUCKING VICTORIAM!!!!
---
Yes please
---
&gt;The meters need to drain a lot slower. Humans can go about 3 days without water depending on circumstances, and even weeks without food. Having to think about feeding isn't the problem, it's having to do it so damn often.
---
there is the rule of threes. 3 minutes without oxygen, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food.
---
Anyone know if food/water meters are linked to endurance? If not, they should be. Endurance should affect the drain rate of meters and gain rate of items.
---
Public team events shouldn't be any different from events like Scorched Earth or Encryptid, except that you'd get team perks.
---
Neat, I wanna see
---
The sooner you get it back the sooner Ward can can shame you for killing the person...well at least for me
---
It should be charge fire like the gauss rifle. But it should consume like 1 cell/sec of charge to the max of the clip size. Plus there should be a mag size mod. This would enable stronger charge shots.
---
Come on.. we all know you would never be able to find 5 chickens on one server. My tamed chicken did survive the longest of all of my pets. So maybe you and the NPC who runs in fear is on to something.
---
that bitch Carole Baskin
---
Its not an issue really. I can either get her in the air or wait til she lands. She only really needs to land once anyway and there is plenty of time to wait.
---
I'm not sold on this bug- I've been comfortably trading since it came back on line and never lost a thing.
---
I agree with other posts--don't screw with camp budget as it's a common aggravating/instigating factor.
---
I have just one door on my camps that I consider need to be left closed, but thats One, the other doors I consider to be just cosmetic
---
Thats all warm and fuzzy. Okay mebbe  it warm,  but very fuzzy. Is there a clearer version, cuz i can barely read that. What I can see, however, I like l.
---
I laughed so hard at that part, a small shining bit of fallout past in this game. 
---
“Believe in yourself, you can do it!”

Massive laser fire

This is what I'm afraid of. I have played solo since the beginning. It was difficult at times. But, I have done alot on my own. I unfortunately have tried to get my friends to play 76. But, they give a weird reaction every time. Like this game is the plague. I'm level 188 and still enjoy the game. Hopefully the team stuff isn't part of it. Is there a group search on Reddit for PS4?
---
Somewhat relevant, you can also use the camera while aiming down sights, to locate dead enemies if you lose their corpse
---
Ah, thanks for getting that back for us! I'll just give it to our newest resident Raider 
---
McRaiderface so he can put it in lock up.
---
Huh, lockup isn't that direction...
---
I got the same bug. I though I was the only one!
---
Ouch that's rough.
---
There is a way to cheese those build challenges.
---
What I did was equip contractor to make stuff cheaper. Go to a workshop airport worked best lots of flat space. Build something that counts as functional that costs like 1 of a resource so that when you scrap it you get it back.
---
So for example for decorations I put a foundation and a wall and then spammed signs that cost 1 steel. I stored the wall after about 300 signs it puts all the signs into storage then went to storage and spam scrap, rinse and repeat.
---
For functional I think basic storage chest counted so I put a foundation and stacked 29 on it and made a blueprint then spammed the blueprint down like 10 times stored the foundations and spam scrapped the containers.
---
For buildings i put a foundation and a stair and then a bunch of the quarter floors because 4 for 1 space and cheaper on wood (used the free stuff you get with the workshop) and then made a blueprint placed like 10 of them down then world hopped because no quick way to take them down. Basically looks like one of those floating bases.
---
The whole time as long as the build cost shows as green you are using the workshops resources not yours.
---
Hope these made sense.
---
Just a pop up notification telling us "You have achieve x damage to the SBQ" would be enough. That number is already counted in the game although we don't see it.
---
Balance and mechanics are wack, but the concept is good!  
---
  
---
Although I feel shoehorning good and evil is a bit prescriptive. A bit theme of the Fallout series is discovering morality.
---
He is a former Raider, after all. I’m sure whatever “bone saw” I’m sent to get is actually my filthy, dirty blood money.
---
be careful what you wish for.. people will complain about having to grind rainstorms..
---
I'm a compulsive door shutter. That said, at one random camp I kept shutting doors while  checking out their setup and shopping a bit. Seemed like I was reclosing the same doors over and over, finally realized the camp owner was running around behind me reopening all the doors. We made eye contact and he gave me the ??? reaction, I slunk away embarrassed. This was months ago and I still think about it... lol
---
I always thought the SBQ needed an insta kill mechanic. When she takes off, she should pick up 2 players within range and drop them into the fissure. Your only protection is bird bones, fall armor or jet pack. Maybe RNG, one person yets 200 ft drop, the other gets the fissure lol.
---
exactly haha, or the cave cricket who fiund you no matter what and one taps you right after SBQ spawns it
---
While I agree that that could be an issue they could easily add a method allowing a player to gain back reputation with a faction of their choice if they wanted to change their choice.
---
He also needs 12 ultracite power armor each with oddly specific paint combinations
---
You’ll get it soon!  If you do the event “patrol Duty” at the prison it can drop as a reward, it always gives you a gun plan, that’s how I got my first one.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Theres 4 locations. Charleston, Lady Janets, near Morgantown, and the White Powder Ski place. The ones Ive had the most luck with are Lady Janets and Charleston. If you need exact locations heres a youtube video: https://youtu.be/5a_67LqV3eo
---
Soon they will be useful for converting into different types of ammo lol
---
With how much asbestos I have in my armor and how frequently it breaks, I should absolutely have mesothelioma by now.
---
???
---
I like the flare gun idea. Problem with the flare gun is that the draw distance is so poor.
---
The fix is that just shooting the flare that you are in trouble you would glow or pulse on the map. Players could see that your in trouble and fast travel to you.
---
No idea. But this has acquired my curiosity.
---
Server hop Lady Janet's soft serve, run down the road just past the turkey on the map. Other than that Charleston station is good but people build their camps there which ruins the spawn. If you're after the long coat without a friend to hold the vendor and keep rejoining the game to refresh the inventory it will take a very long time.
---
I actually don’t mind. I always stay on world to check out the camp which has replaced mine. You can get some pretty good inspiration seeing what they built in that environment. Then I bounce out.
---
You didn’t have to use her, I couldn’t figure out how to work out the head so I just put her away and used my normal weapons
---
This happens to me almost every time I load into a server for the first time
---
It's also strange that the Settlers didn't get a second Daily Quest giver. That would help break up the monotony slightly.
---
I'm wondering if there will be an update for it. Hate getting super hyped for a release only to completely forget that there is usually a update to go through first lol
---
It's Bethesda.
---
More innate rad resistance. Rad suit has 1000, PA should start at 500RR min and max at 750RR. Alot of the stuff PA is missing can be solved with more mods. The mods for arms are especially lacking. The underwhelming carry weight can be solved by adding deep pocketed or calibrated arm mods.
---
Theres a vats perk that lets you target limbs and see individual health bars per limb. Once that drains the limb is crippled. Say its a ghoul and you cripple its legs, it falls on its face and cant move. When you could cripple the queens wings she would stay on the ground. As for your first question im pretty sure its damage to the limbs, thats why they are desirable for cripling. They kill the limb before the enemy
---
or, you are used to nuclear winter and hold x too long to revive someone and pop out!!
---
Last week, I returned to my base 100% destroyed. I have no idea how they did it. Took me 10 mins to rebuild though.
---
Calm yourself, you can wait an extra 60 seconds...
---
I'd like a rust/DayZ PvP mode where there is more on the line than just losing junk. those games are fun and you need to team up, build fortresses, raid other players camps, and the added stress of losing everything is exciting to me. but if they keep adding modes they will likely only further divide a dwindling player base
---
Yeah a bit confusing but weapons like the brass knuckles, power fist and deathclaw gauntlet are considered unarmed, which is its own category of weapons. Arguably the best out of the three, but you can't use them when using power armor
---
Cringe
---
There are at least three of us!
---
This game was pretty easy to plat, it cant be that bad
---
hmmm...wonder if there's bullion at the end of that rainbow..?
---
Why place vendors on 3rd floor?  Is there some exploit I need to be aware of my vendors are on concrete foundations
---
To judge, of course!
---
Some people have great talent and taste!  Some have one or the other!  A few wretched souls have neither and build floating camps into the side of mountains.
---
If you pick up the quest item when not on the quest, it bugs it out so you never need to get the quest item again. 
---
As far as I can determine, this happens when a Thief dies and the body isn't looted before despawning, resulting in the loot just sitting there on the ground.
---
It's a good opportunity for you to practice forgiveness.
---
Bought mine for two hundred. As for the bomber jacket. You can get it in the main main quest
---
I’m nearing Ally status. Is there anything to look forward to plan-wise?
---
Yeah... how can it tell if your location is taken until the world is loaded?
---
Potential minor spoilers.
---
Not a bad idea but I disagree with moral alignment as Fallout tends to make their groups morally flexible. It would be more lore friendly to have rivalries based on lore, such as enclave vs brotherhood, or settlers and foundation vs the raiders and free states. The raiders and free states have some similarities as much as the free states would likely dent it. I could easily see the free states and raiders siding together for a common cause, then backstabbing one another after the fact. The free states were to some degree morally flexible. Being survivalists they can easily turn to a raider like presence.
---
So I guess what I'm getting at is similar to how in other games the factions all stood for something and when their specific ideologies clashed they flagged one another as enemies. Fo4 was a perfect example of this, similarly they could add a faction who wishes to preserve the scorched, study them, and attempt to control them as the queen does, which would be in Direct conflict with most of the base factions similar to how enclave has it's own agenda. Would they be evil? Perhaps I'll not, but morally flexible, probably to some degree.
---
But I do really like the underlying concept, though balancing should probably occur. Maybe more faction specific items, and less faction specific perks. Maybe a bonus of sorts against specific factions similar to an elemental circle or triangle seen in many fantasy games or how I  starcraft each unit type was strong against another unit type.
---
For instance Brotherhood strong against enclave, enclave strong against raiders, raiders strong against brotherhood. Some reasoning such as the brotherhood's adeptness against technology gives an advantage to enclaves technology, enclave is strong against raider because of strong surveillance technology, raiders strong against brotherhood becuade of their guerilla tactics and unconventional fighting style. This is just an example if general balancing with little time spent on it, but the idea could be expanded to give each faction strengths and weaknesses against other, alliances and such against other factions. In addition to this you could easily make it competitive by making the ability to switch sides available once weekly and give a bonus to the faction that earned the most points through contribution to events and pvp. These bo uses could be faction currency and or reputation along with legendaries and rare drop plans, recipies, outfits or other cosmetics. Because there would be faction specific drops it would help the factions have rotation in winning position. Additionally there could be a cap to how many players can join a faction or a ratio driven scoring based on amount of points earned vs the amount of players who played that week.
---
Just thoughts, sorry for the book I wrote. Awesome concept though.
---
I thought they had fixed it. It I think I unbugged my character by looting a raider thief. Now I need  to bug myself again I don’t want another errand to run!
---
Nope. So long as your looking at a map for it and server hopping after you check the spots then theres not much you can do other than hope
---
I nuked her house because she said her scavenger hunt that was a hunt fir scavenged items that was scavenged by a scavenger was not a scavenger hunt
---
Nuke zones and events
---
One part of it is that i find this game dreadfully boring and tedious and ive come back just to get a quick 2 trophys im missing so i can get the platinum and then never touch this game again
---
I’ve actually never heard of RadShield before. So I assume I’m dumb for missing something in the game, that could actually help. Where is this and where to I go to get it?
---
It just does
---
I'm not too worried. people look in my vendors and end up leaving ME stuff.
---
like that last guy, left me a 10mm pistol and one 10mm bullet...sigh...so thoughtful..
---
Yes there is an exploit that allows people to take things from your stash for very very few caps, but seems to only effect either CAMPs with their build budget maxed out or glitched over max. I did not glitch anything but would prefer not to take any chances.
---
except when you have to do it 3-5x over and over is just frustrating
---
Except for nukeing it a whole bunch so that it doesnt recover properly from all the radiation damage
---
With my luck, the Reputation system will completely break with me just short of Ally on Raiders.  Papa needs a gauss mini-gun...
---
They didn't like your prices.
---
Part of me wants players to have access to the things in my house, not that any of it is anything special, but still... why not? But then part of me wants to put keypad doors everywhere and lock them all, because jfc coming back and seeing every single door wide open just rubs me the wrong way, because... why can't you close the damn doors, do you leave them all open irl as well???
---
Always wanted to be able to ride one of the motorcycles through the wastelands. 
---
I had hoped that the wastelanders could have repaired the train lines for free fast travel between stations.
---
One reason I like Julie is that she knows protectrons are adorable.
---
With the introduction of public teams I see this as a must have on Bethesda’s checklist sadly, they want people to team up
---
*finally, someone with the guts to help*
---
*good, you’re not a flake*
---
I think they tend to take them all down at once some times then roll them back online one at a time. Of course Japan is always first. If my memory serves me correct, it's been a while. Lol
---
You can legit just repair it. If it took you 10mins to rebuild I’m going to assume you haven’t really put all that much effort into your camp. I spend hours designing and building mine and I’ll probably be rebuilding it again next week.
---
I got a quad/ffr/+p tesla for mine, so 25-30k is a pretty good deal.
---
To the guy who sat there and watched nukes land on his camp twice then came to reddit to bitch about it, youre an idiot.
---
You are welcome. If I only reach one person I have done my job 😃
---
look it up.  There are about 6 spawns iirc.
---
You could switch to a Commando build and hopefully get a Furious rifle you can put an automatic receiver on. You'll still chew through bullets, but you'll greatly improve your DPS. Failing that if you could score a nice Lever Action rifle that'll definitely help your game a bit.
---
 I decided a while ago that I couldn't stomach the quests any more.  I'm hoping they add some more ways to get reputation later.  For now, just visiting smiley.  Way more my speed
---
I found 3 power packs before ever setting foot into Foundation and have never had to actually do his quest. They were just laying on the ground randomly. The trick seems to be finding one on the ground. Not a paper bag with one in it, but the power pack (or other item Ward wants) itself. My guess is they show up when someone who isn't doing the quest kills one of the raider thieves before someone who is doing the quest gets there.
---
Ward, I’ve known you for three months now. Don’t you remember my name?
---
Not “Hey pal, could use a hand if you’re up for it” or “Good to see you again, if you’re not busy Foundation needs your help”
---
All I am is “someone” to Ward.
---
And the usual "Is anyone's thirst meter draining much quicker since the latest patch???"
---
Was he trying to send some kind of message? I wonder
---
*i can only see you have the guts to help with my head stuck inside this top bunk.*
---
That's great! I am glad that you are content with the game as is, I just wanted to have a discussion about how bethesda really missed the mark on reputations and wanted to see how others felt about it aswell.
---
are we seriously debating on what 'makes sense' and what doesn't? This is about gameplay mechanics, and I agree with OP, it should in some form, or at least buff the damage multiplier for charging 5 MF cells with such a slow reload time.
---
Explosive bait or someone drew a bunch of enemies to your camp and left
---
Motor electricity supplied by devs running on oversized hamsterwheels. Which is why it takes so long for fixes. Just a theory. Got to keep them servers running, the employees too.
---
I suggest, drop the hamsterwheels, fix the waterwheels.
---
“Finally, someone with the guts to- yeah it’s me, I’m down here, glitched underneath the musician stands. Yes, my head is underneath Derrick playing the harmonica.”
---
Search around the fissure sites and collect the ultracite there. They glow so they’re pretty easy to spot.
---
yeah they should take workshops out of the game and use the locations for future events/quests/npcs/instanced interiors or whatever else the future may bring.. just shut it down already...
---
Anywhere on the map that is not the green no go area is fair game for a nuke, however you are camping in a danger zone.
---
They truly are!
---
... except of course the very first legendary protectron I fought as a newbie and that exploded in my naive face right before looting it.
---
Stacking bobble head time if xo is tied directly into board he’ll yeah if it’s own separate do counter f me than
---
I'm a heavy weapons, lvl 128 power armor enthusiast. All the weapons feel weak. Scorchbeasts are hard use ultracite ammo/weapons - Sheepsquatch is no punk either.
---
The map is huge. You don't need to camp on the same 20 spots that everyone else seems to camp at.
---
OR, you can walk right up to your actual placed camp and press one button to repair all(if you have the mats).
---
Lol got the joys of using a Fatman while glitched ;)
---
Fair point. I have three separate buildings in my camp.
---
I dunno, I can top that....
---
"Grafton's Mayor here!"
---
I love these people. Had a guy dump a few plasma cores into me and my camp when he saw my prices. And then try to thumbs down the new customers coming through, they still spent their caps it was adorable. I dont think he liked my xo1 headlamp plans for 1776 a pop :)
---
YES YES YES! I literally just made a post yesterday complaining about how the reputation system sucks and that bethesda made wastelanders a whole illusion of choice. With some benefits like what you proposed. I really hoped that we would see some divide among players with the factions and the choice that we had to make in the story line. I really hope that something like this gets implemented in game.
---
Welp, looks like youve created your own problem. Thanks for bitching about it
---
What? There was a Test NPC in game since beta, in the Dev room, it was clear they were gonna add them eventually
---
I do the same thing.
---
I can tolerate Grafton’s Mayor, he’s clearly half-assing his job and I respect that. Ward is just an emotionless dick. Tbh if Derrick gave out missions in Foundation, I’d go there more often.
---
For sustained fire you arent doing to hot. Instigating drops out after the first hit so it's better for really high base damage weapons with a slow fire rate (maybe Gauss rifle or Black Powder, maybe a hunting rifle). If you wanna keep your DPS up look for an Anti armor with either Explosive or VATS modifiers on something like a lever action, and then a vampires modifier on something with a higher fire rate like a Handmade or Railway Rifle to keep your health up. If you are using VATS then your range doesnt really matter, but if it's a big deal invest in fist weapons for some easy CQB damage at a low perk point cost. 
---
If you really want the maximum damage output you are going to want to do research on junkies builds. They are the best Damage at high health and dont require as much attention as everyone thinks.
---
Where would one find a nice lever rifle? I never see them for sale. Also I have one furious legendary weapon...a black powder rifle...oh, the irony!
---
Sheep squacth is very. Tanky
---
They used to be that you'd fire once and all your ammo was gone. So it was kind of like that, but in the worst possible way.
---
*"Finally, someone with the guts to help."*
---
Mate I've been here everyday for the past 2 weeks, I legit live just down the road. You know me
---
except you hear it every time you go into the toxic valley
---
Yeah that what I was saying by repair it.
---
I hate killing hostile robots, especially them. 😭
---
well scorchedbeasts and sheepsquatches are about the hardest enemies you can come by in day to day combat (speaking about tankiness at least)
---
bloodied and junkies are the go to effects if you want to reach high damage, but there are alternatives
---
the problem i see with your set up is 
---
firstly, only rank one in tank killer, i see the appeal of sniper but its not really worth it compared to two more ranks of tank killer (but thats a minor complaint)
---
the big problem is dps, or more exactly, your lack of dps
---
all your weapons are good for oneshotting usual enemies, but for those that dont drop after your initial shot you should have an eye out for a semiautomatic weapon like combatrifle/handmade/fixer
---
you still wont take down the sheepsquatch in seconds but you will have a significantly higher damage output during the fight and can rely on effects like anti armor or furious 
---
anti armor is more beneficial on weapons with lower base damage due to the way armor penetration is calculated (i dont know the exact maths behind it though), and furious can stack up to 45 or 50% extra damage wich is about the same as the junkies effect once you reached it
---
Good lord......the wasteland shakes
---
Any fun or perceived fun is an anathema to Bethesda, they seem to be 'fixing' and 'balancing' this game to oblivion.
---
Watch and listen to Vinnie. The quest only works if he tells a set of NPC's to get in the tunnel.  If he doesn't you will have to server hop and try again. Usually works then.
---
For my money I'd say ditch sniper and upgrade tank killer to Max rank. And luck - bloody mess Max rank also. Bloody mess is far more useful than crits as you've always got that 15% damage increase.
---
Grrrrrrrrafton!
---
added
---
If you have the garrahan armor use a lfg and take out a bunch of scorchbeasts
---
I’m actually surprised when he has clothes on .... almost always in just underwear I think I’ve seen him in clothes 3 times
---
I need components to make those prime weapons and ultracite armor and no one sells them...I have been to a few nuke zones but no luck....I am avoiding the cranberry bog area, as I struggle in events like line in the sand and radiation rumble. So, Brother can you spare some crimson flux?
---
Close shut the jaws of Oblivion!
---
Seriously we need to be able to kill foundation settlers and eat them, that's all they are good for.
---
I actually like the photo quest for some reason--I try different angles and try and make them scenic.
---
Because you might be trying to join an event like encryptid/queen/rad rumble or just plain well server hoping looking for something and don’t actually care if your c.a.m.p can be placed or not.  You just want to get to the event or whatever.
---
So i’d rather leave it the way it is than look at the loading screen forever while it looks for a server my c.a.m.p can be placed in.
---
Bc no one cares about pvp in a fallout game
---
Foundation needs another damn quest.  The Raiders get two,  Foundation needs another.
---
awesome &gt;_&lt;
---
I've been to the water park like 10 times.
---
The god damn water park!   It's less than a mile away Wren,  don't be so fucking lazy.
---
Hunger and thirst are being removed? That's bullshit. It doesn't need removal, it needs fixing.
---
me too bro. or i just never got it which is what i’m leaning towards. i scrapped a raider PA chassis and every piece appeared in my inventory don’t think i forgot about scrapping them for the ultracite.
---
Hey man each one is 30 Bullion.   You know damn well the brotherhood's gonna be using gold as their premium too.
---
Thanks I earned a regular fixer from a quest but I haven’t seen any legendaries in shops. I have come across level 45 combat rifles but not legendary either. Anyone way to get these besides through the purveyor?
---
Serves you right for trying to be helpful and informative.
---
There's a mine near the queens fissure site that has lots in. Server jump after emptying it a few times and you'll have tonnes
---
All these former raiders aswell! There's not gonna be a Raider settlement left in the end.
---
Agreed, there are SO many interesting characters that could have good daily missions:
---
Jen
---
Elsie
---
One of the Sunnys 
---
Hell, even the damn kid could give you something to do. Go find him a comic book or something.
---
My vendors never came down, even when they were disabled. Never lost an item
---
Yeah, the map is huge...so there really should be more than 20 spots that aren't lacking something and/or are a pain in the ass to build on.
---
Where is the queens site located is it in the cranberry bog?
---
Inside glassed cavern there are 50 or so ore nodes. Just need acid to melt it. Or scrap hardened mass to get it straight.
---
Or you could do like my brother does, carry your best weapons on you
---
Well, you may need to seek a trading group or community for your platform to buy one because good ones don't usually get sold out of player vendors. But you may luck out and find one... I found a TSE Lever in a player vendor once. If you want to stick with semi auto you're going in the right direction looking for Instigating though... Your Railway is alright but that gun is more geared towards full auto. You can also look into the Hunting Rifle. If you put a .50 receiver on it it will do as much damage as a Lever Action with equal rolls, but it fires much slower.
---
There's plenty of great spots once you realize that plopping down next to a useless extractor node is limiting your choices.
---
Stop! You are ruining their plan for paid DLC that they said they would never do!
---
Yeah I’ve seen them a few times. Doesn’t really make sense. I’ve also seen some diseased eyebots. Not sure how a robot gets a disease.
---
The Guass shotgun is pretty fun
---
Nice! I had my chance. They weren’t moving and I had no idea what I was looking at and I just set up a sneak headshot and did no damage haha. I had the handheld camera too. Total missed opportunity
---
Yeah I know what you mean.  I ran an army/navy store for 8 years and have so much accumulated crap.
---
*Laughs in SSD*
---
That makes me feel like I either got a deal or a dupe, I bought the plans for the pack at someones camp for like 150 caps, plus the insurgent hat and outfit for like 300 per plan.
---
Thank you for the advice...any ideas on where to find such weapons?
---
What type of weapon do they classify as? I thought they were pistols.
---
Yep, definitely one of the best communities i've come across :)
---
I will switch to tank killer...thanks!
---
Not sure if they fixed that dupe glitch, but that's exactly what you wanted to see for a little while.
---
Captainoob had a video killing scorchbeasts with a level 1 pipe gun you might find interesting
---
https://youtu.be/agR4xIfV6mI
---
This is honestly the best online community that I've ever seen so far, the people are great I've had little to no issues
---
I might get some of my friends to help replicate it lol.
---
Yeah south east of Watoga. The mine is called glassed cavern
---
1. Why would a Mole Miner use a Pickaxe to kill someone when their are better alternatives?
---
2. It really should tbh.
---
3. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmccrzvJcxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmccrzvJcxc)
---
4. That's their for grinding purposes, and makes no sense at all.
---
5. Hey, if rads can get through it, then so can the disease
---
6. Same answer as 4.
---
7. GRIND WALL LOCKED CONTENT. deal with it.
---
8. Same reason we can't trade Guass Shotgun, Guass Minigun, and Secret Service armor. It would lose it's value.
---
9. Bethesda prolly saving them up for future quests. I could be wrong tho.
---
10. Nope we just throw the bottle on the floor, like the filthy littering model citizen Vault dwellers that we are.
---
11. It just does. There's no reasoning behind it, because the Mothman isn't real to begin with, so Bethesda can create the Mothman however they'd like in their own image.
---
12. It really shouldn't.
---
We complained so much about it tat they've decided to make a whole Fallout game about grinding.
---
I’m just terrified of all the bitching posts that are coming
---
I always eat the cereal and the box.
---
Yeah saw a scorched Yao Guai yesterday. That was fun.
---
Browse Reddit, listen to a podcast?
---
One would argue their demand would be tech data, or even legendaries (Ie weapons). But you're probs correct. 
---
But how does one feel knowing their SS armor is probably going to be immediately made outdated, and every bullion spent on it will need to be reaccumulated? Wouldn't it be AMAZING to have some merit based gear in this chapter? Like one or two guaranteed named drops?
---
Instead, everyone can return to- 'Finally, somebody with the guts to help...'
---
Or...
---
'Loyalty, does anyone understand the meaning of the word?'
---
Yuck. Nah, I'm good!
---
Aside from the aforementioned budget issues, it also isn't possible to do with the half wall variants, and the triangular pieces for roofs can get really picky about it. Double sided variants would also let us customize our exterior, especially with stuff like the flagstone wallpapers.
---
Wait isn’t that what he just said?
---
Head down the hill path behind the golf clubhouse he hangs out near the footpath bridge.
---
It's a technical aspect. Imagine if everyone had unlimited inventory space. People would literally fucking keep everything. Then you got glitches, exploits, and out right cheating thru mods/hacking, etc. You have Bethesda trying to keep up an infinite amount of data. You would have to many people just spam collecting shit in their stash just to overload the servers. 
---
The way stuff is stored does need to be reworked, but I do think that there is inventory management in this game with good reason.
---
your best bet is on the online forums via trade but sooner or later youll get something,
---
if you are on ps4 im sure i find something for you that i dont need anymore 👍🏼
---
player vending machines are good though if you visit them regulary and try to save up some caps youll find something imeventually :)
---
Thanks I’ll check it out
---
Yeah I know I've retrieved that bone saw for him more than once...
---
damn, that or maybe low level and didnt know their value?
---
even with duping youd think theyd sell it a bit higher, at least a couple thousand caps.
---
Resource management is one thing, but this is mostly just juggling weight limits with a rather unintuitive interface, all so Bethesda can dangle FO1st in front of us. It's not challenging, it's just irritating. The hard part of resource management should be in the collecting of the resources, not dealing with arbitrary limits that don't really relate to anything. It's not satisfying to balance your stash, it's just a chore that forces you to stop enjoying the exploration and scavenging in the game, and ultimately starts to punish those things as you're forced to just start dumping excess scrap.
---
Besides, in a game with limited time rare collectibles, balancing that with your stash space just makes the game miserable. The whole system is just a bit iffy.
---
When did "survival game" become code for endless tedium? Things like stash limits and currency caps don't make the game harder, they just make the game pointless and grind it to a halt.
---
This just sounds like a clunky fix to something that shouldn't even be a problem in the first place.
---
Really? What’s inside them apart from just a bare ass empty room?
---
I had this issue until i realized im just an idiot hoarder. The stash space is more than enough for me if i learn to let things go
---
For example i was holding 99 stimpacks.
---
99 radaway
---
99 rad x
---
As well as 1000+ of multiple mats
---
I dont need that many. Once i learned to just sell em my headaches went away
---
It's a recipe learned from a quest in the Mire, you also get five of them, I think, as a quest reward. Afterwards, as far as I know, you will have to craft it. It gives you +300 rad resistance.
---
This video maybe more helpful.
---
https://youtu.be/_976Yae_KAQ
---
Because the netcode couldn't handle each client polling servers till it found one without the spot taken.
---
That’s when I use my melee character with stacked Unyielding to get 700+ carry weight XD
---
So there are certain legendary effects designated as being in the 4th and 5th star slot, but these do not drop, and are only used for specific pre set legendary items.
---
The mighty effect for 20% more damage is a 5th star effect iirc, and is present on the bunker buster you get for completing the quest "one of us"
---
Another weapon is the special 10mmsmg you get with the incendiary effect, which is classed as a 4th star effect.
---
These effects are intentionally not "balanced", but only found on specific weapons, and would require rebalancing to see widespread use.
---
Thats it the only unique thing is the vault numbers when it says WELCOME  VAULT 63,94,96 DWELLERS but thats how damn boring it is.
---
I didn't realize the similarity until this post, makes so much sense! Bethesda can't abandon the meme apparently.
---
Yeah, I tried glitching through the walls but didn’t find anything nice. Just fell out the world and haven’t not crashed out yet.
---
yep
---
**JUST EAT THE POTION, ROWAN!**
---
Hate when she sends me to the prison cause then I feel obligated to help the warden by following some slow ass police robot around and keep him safe as he aimlessly wanders around the prison.
---
i went to someones camp that had a port-a-jon out side, i jumped inside and left a note
---
" i.o.u toilet paper "  wonder if they ever seen it lol
---
Yeah but for fusion core users the three power plants are about the best way to get a big supply of them in a hurry.
---
Can make one with suitcases in the mean time!
---
The world is already loaded for the server you're connecting to, and the player data - including camp position - is also already stored on bethesda servers, not client side.
---
They would need to add a step to client connection to do the camp check before the client gets to the loading step.
---
I changed my stealth rifleman to stealth commando silenced handmade until I find a junkies handmade (maybe one day, lol). As others have indicated, semi or automatics gain you higher DPS but use more ammo.
---
My other three builds are junkies pistol, heavy power armor, and junkies stealth melee.   
---
All run mutations specific to their build.
---
Here’s good info on junkies :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
I’m always on the lookout in player vendors for junkies weapons to try out.  I’m too cheap / lazy to go on trading sub.
---
Edit:  be warned:  one you go junkies, and or mutie, ya never wanna go back..
---
It does for the SBQ, a regular 3* enemy.....not so much.
---
If your vending machine is filled with civil war suits, dirty white asylum dresses and non-legendary weapons then no, I will not be closing your doors. I'm going to eat your damn tatos and kill your cow, too.
---
I'd say most of the community in general is nice its just the very few scammers that kinda ruin it a lol bit other than that most of my experiences in this game were positive and guiding and helpful or just talking about past fallout games.
---
I saw a fixer once but it was 15000 caps. I just looked on the forums and I doubt anybody would want my weapons. I just reached level 50 so all the Fasnacht weapons I earned I ended up selling or sent to purveyor. As someone said I need a quick fire DPS rifle for non- one hit enemies. I am happy with any help or pointers you could provide. Should I just use my regular non-lengendary fixer? Thanks in advance.
---
Not at all, my max cap is level 4
---
Now when i see that I think *Trap* and leave
---
Ah, the fun at parties type?
---
At least I got you to concede on two. I'll take that as a small victory.
---
Yeah. Seen a Scorched Wendigo with it too. No idea why.
---
Well those items,  flux such as violet flux, are some the hardest items to craft in the game. you will not find it - you need to craft it. Also gathering hardened mass to craft it is very hard. you need to rank more &amp; be patient.
---
“FUCK YA WE PUT A BATTLE ROYALE IN FALLOUT”
---
Oh, no, I broke it! No, no, it's on sale!
---
Sounds like a vsync issue. Have you tried setting iPresentInterval=0 in the customs ini file?
---
Yeah, Im pretty fun at parties.
---
As long as you don't build more than a hut &amp; have less than 10 settlers, sure.
---
Or 200 mounted mole rat plans! Sheesh
---
The water wheel will spin again, but can now only be place on dry ground.
---
Got to level 115 before seeing [him](https://imgur.com/1q7CUze) yesterday.
---
💯 agree
---
i guess the non legendary fixer is your best bet for now at least if its max lvl
---
if you dont have that maybe get the plans for handmade rifles or kill some bloodeagle, they carry handmades from time to time and try to get hands on a fully modded handmade
---
That's something I regularly do. But now with camp allies and traveling merchants visiting, my doors are never closed. Fucking animals. You'd think an astronaut would behave better.
---
My normal camp visiting M.O:
---
-Close front door when entering or leaving.
---
-Close all other doors I've used when leaving.
---
-Take all food and unlocked resources if vendor has crap prices.
---
-Repair damaged food with food taken.
---
-Take everything anyway as complimentary for buying items from player regardless since others will take it anyway, including from my own camp. Circle of life, bitch!
---
-Puke on vendors with bad prices and/or crap offerings.
---
-If player of camp with bad vendors is present, puke on player and thumb them down.
---
-Now throw floater grenades and make it rain with my 2-shot MIRV. Let them know what they've done!
---
-Kill their fucking cow!
---
-Leave.
---
Kill someone without them retaliating
---
Go to a players camp and picklock a door.
---
Go to someone’s camp, find something they have locked,unlock it, boom your wanted.
---
Tbh I think they should add a patch that adds a daily quest for each of the named characters in crater/foundation, for example maybe for Derrik and his family you can be sent to wipe out a raider hunting party from The Pitt thats tracked them down, or for Jen you could have a similar scenario with communists, a lot of these characters are so interesting but they’re expended on limited dialogue interactions or tied to main quests
---
I really feel Reputation status should be account wide, absolutely fuck doing that grind a second time on an alt
---
Ugh, I swear mounted head plans are a curse. They're like a cancer that gets more aggressive every time there's a special event in-game.
---
Check all the water purifiers at everyone's camps. If any are locked, lockpick them. Otherwise visit workshops that are claimed and pick any locked doors or containers there that you can find.
---
Deep down, don't we all really want to be wanted? 🤔
---
Just move your camp to an unpopular location. I log in first time every time now that I'm in shitsville.
---
Happened to me on my last West Tek run, except there were 3 separate examples. Kept scaring the shit out of me because every time I turned a corner one of them would pop up in front of me.
---
I get a lot of those and scorched yao guai during the scorched beast queen battles
---
Yo this is silly easy to get. Up around the top of the world are 10 different spawn locations for magazines. Server hop til you have 20 and then read and done.
---
I've noticed him a lot more since Wastelanders came out.  I run through the Bivouac place by West Tec all the time and have seen him there fairly often controlling the ghouls.  Saw him today outside of Abbies bunker and at the power line tower behind New Haven church.
---
Im level 93! Took me quite a while. 
---
When I was doing my photo challenge, I spent days server hopping abbys bunker without success.
---
I believe its the nature of the game. I don't get mircrostutters about 20 to 30 seconds but i do get random frame drops when I run throughout the map my guess is from loading.
---
The only thing I can add which you alluded to already doing but I'm not sure to what extent is to set the following in your fallout76custom.ini
---
Under [display]
---
iSize W = your width resolution
---
iSize H = height of resolution 
---
bFull screen = 1
---
bBorderless = 0
---
ipresentInterval =0
---
Under [controls]
---
bMouseAcceleration  
---
If you have a gync monitor go into nvidia control panel and also turn off vsync and make sure gsync is on.
---
If you dont have a vsync monitor then turn vsync on in the nvidia control panel. 
---
I've also heard that turning shader cache off in the nvidia control panel has helped some people.
---
Also i set my game to full screen and set the graphics to medium and set shadow distance to low.
---
Thanks everyone the lock picking worked
---
Do you have the grounded mutation?
---
Completely agree. I hated that grind.
---
It isn't caused by being over budget, it's caused by players interacting with your vendor while your CAMP is still loading in on their screen. Being over budget simply increases the time it takes for your CAMP to load, but if a player's internet and/or system is slow enough it could happen even if you're under budget. You just need to make sure your vendor is far enough from your fast travel spawn point that players can't access it until everything has loaded in. Note that players will spawn where you spawn when first loading into the server, not where you spawn when fast traveling from a different location.
---
It's also worth remembering that it is extremely difficult to pull off intentionally and is very unlikely to happen accidentally. Yes, players have reported suffering from it as recently as today, but keep in mind that's one person out of however many hundreds of thousands are playing this game. I'm not trying to undermine their suffering, but they are most certainly the exception rather than the rule.
---
Wow down vote me if you want. But 3/4 of you don’t even use resources available to you. I couldn’t even give a fixer plan to a melee character, because it wasn’t their build. You can join a public group and do your own thing. There are vast knowledge websites and YouTube videos and  you still wonder why you can’t sell a serum. Start complaining about the current weapons dup and it’s real. Stop complaining about playing with people. I didn’t want a mmo fallout, I wanted co-op but we got what we got and we still play it. I also made a good group of friends that have a blast trading and playing with each other.
---
I completely agree, Foundation feels very empty once you go through everyone’s incredibly limited dialogue tree. Every named character should have their own side quest and then daily missions. Having a fun side quest to help Samuel ask out Jen would be hilarious, and having more with Elsie and Derrick would be great, especially if it’s Pitt related like you said.
---
I was feeling the same way for nearly 100 levels before switching to bloodied weapons. The legendary effect now does twice as much damage and the unyielding armor pieces all boost my SPECIAL stats, which enhance ablities to do more damage. Mutations and chems also boost damages significantly. Going Junkies would have the same effect, I imagine.
---
four of us
---
Dang i do lol that would be why. Is there any way to cure specific mutations?
---
Nope, it's random
---
**LIKE A NORMAL PER-SON**
---
The only ones that will no longer reward Atoms are the daily and weekly challenges. The World, Combat etc—they’ll all continue to work as they do now.
---
If you have active addictions, the game is showing you the damage that weapon would have if it were junkies.
---
I encountered this when I ran a junkies build.
---
More than likely, this is just a low-priority bug.
---
Happy gaming!
---
They are almost as bad as workshops. 🤮 But, hey, no one running in and killing you while you're in build mode and can't exit it, right?
---
How do you actually craft it though? Chemist station? Do you need special
---
Perks? I bought a denomination shower for my camp but can’t put it up because of the needed components
---
 Item durability, hunger, and thirst effect your ability to stay alive tho, so by your logic getting food and water and repair mats is not a waste.
---
The max level you can have for one SPECIAL stat is 15.
---
You then have 56 points to distribute among those SPECIAL stats once you reach the relevant level
---
Line in the sand. No other event would give you that amount of weapons to sell or scrap, if you go on the cliff in front of the Asylum and either kill all the Scorched that spawn with nukes or just shower them with, say, 50 cal. I usually walk away with over 1K steel worth load of guns after successful one.
---
I would love that.
---
Which would require a load anyways? 
---
So we'd need a load screen so we can check the server then a load screen to load into it :P
---
I’m just pointing out a trap base
---
*Are you here to help? Cause I've got stuff that needs doin'.*
---
This sounds like the quad legendary effect. I got one once , and it had pretty crazy damage, but it was nearly useless in combat due to a long reloading sequence.
---
Behold: [the shrine of Mr. Pebbles.](https://imgur.com/a/XvhPyOI)
---
This will probably be removed under the witch hunting rule, just FYI
---
Yeah and honestly I hope they add small settlements throughout in previous locations, like locations like Flatwoods and Sutton would be amazing places for settlements to spring up again, fuck this planting 1 NPC responder wanabee
---
Shhhh don't tell anyone else. It can be all of our secrets.b
---
They really need to add a different daily for the foundation. I think they should have 2 dailies and 1 weekly quest you can do, maybe even 3 dailies once you get to neighborly status. It takes too long to get to ally to only have one daily.
---
Taking Radaway will remove one random mutation. Keep taking Radaway until they're gone.
---
Radaway has a chance of curing mutations
---
I found him today with his face in a tree, not sure what he was doing.
---
RadAway or a Decontamination Shower at a camp. Make sure you’re not using Starched Genes as a Luck perk.
---
96 is supposed to be a raid. 94 was such a mess, I wonder if they’ve had to completely start over working on 96.
---
They really should have opened vault 94 for exploration. There’s a ton of good junk and resources in there.
---
Not sure what 63 will be.
---
Anything except robots and automatons can earn the prefix if exposed to the gas trail a scorchbeast leaves, just like in a queen fight
---
Stable Flux is crafted at the Chem Station using materials gathered from mobs in nuke zones and raw flux collected from plants in nuke zones. Using 1 Glowing Mass, 1 Hardened Mass, and 1 High-Radiation Fluid with 10x of a particular raw flux will produce 1 stable flux of the corresponding type. Places with lots of enemy spawns are good locations to nuke for the loot materials you need, and you can target specific areas for certain types of raw flux. This is a map of the flux spawns:  [https://i.imgur.com/KHDQIV7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/KHDQIV7.jpg) .
---
This is why I camp in the Ash heap near Welch. I'm setup above Welch near a mine with a small pond I use for my 4x water purifiers. Haven't had the spot taken in months.
---
That and check if they're selling any good stuff.
---
Have you every used a gamma gun? There’s a bug right now where it doesn’t stop the rad noise.
---
I put them in the display case! Not the jar hahaha I would die if we could have a death jar screaming at our camps hahaha
---
Actually, iguana meat has been essentially confirmed as human flesh.
---
It took me almost a year before I saw my first one, but now with Wastelanders and high luck (9-15) characters (not positive if that makes a difference) I've seen it twice recently. 
---
One of my favorite things in the game. I can't wait for more alien/Zetan content!
---
Is it constant? Because there's a disease that make you hear things. Check your Status tab in Pip Boy.
---
Stats on stats! I want to see all the stats. Damage numbers, ad kills, assists even. Would add so much conversation to the game.
---
Yea it will be so awesome to be fucked by Bethesda with less free Atoms it's so great. I hope they take more free stuff away in the future.
---
No I meant in my display case! I would die if we could put it in a jar and have it scream Lolol
---
It is not available on T-65
---
If you don't want to burn through all your RadAway, you can just step back and forth through a decon shower until all your mutations are gone.
---
Look for them at people's camps, but they're also at all the power plants, inside Emmett Mountain Disposal Site (no hostiles are here if the event isn't running), or just inside the Whitesprings enclave bunker.
---
thank you, Godzilla - OP, takes alotta time &amp; effort. plus running thru nuke zones for hardened/glowing mass &amp; hig-rad fluids.
---
I don't use gamma weapons, and even after I found one and did the whole "shoot it and unequip" thing that's been said to help, it doesn't. Not to mention the sound is different than the Gamma Gun sound, the Tesla Rifle, and the Railway Gun.
---
True, but it would be a fairly miniscule amount of data, I would wager. Mostly just positional data and then a quick intersection check. Probably not more than a few Kb of data, tops. If done right, you'd barely even notice.
---
It's only while walking around in the world. If I'm on the map screen, it disappears. It doesn't show up on the main menu either.
---
Mack Neal
---
Doing missions for the Settler Forager or Settler Wanderer should count toward status with Foundation. You are literally doing daily missions for settlers.
---
All the new gauss weapons have the built in “hidden” explosive legendary effect, right? So the gauss shotgun is essentially an explosive shotgun with all pellets receiving the buff, correct?
---
Yo. These kids are STRONG. Come out the womb with marsupial.
---
True
---
In my opinion the best place to get cobalt flux is a nuke zone at the fissure site next to the pumpkin house because there's an entire cornfield that becomes cobalt flux
---
What platform are you on I have thousands I'll just give you what you need
---
They can handle each checking if it's full or not but not this? That's just bad game design and nothing else.
---
At first I didn't. But last couple of months I've been maxing them out.
---
**Iguana Meat is people?!?!?!**
---
Xbox
---
All this would do is make most players stop attacking after reaching the minimum damage threshold in order to conserve ammo.
---
Godzilla explained the crafting aspects very well. If you're on Xbox and wanna friend to run around in nuke zones and help you gather flux I'd be more than willing.
---
Definitely, I blow myself up all the time when ghouls charge but it hits hard
---
Daily Raider missions give treasury notes
---
I disabled mine ages ago now, pretty much make 1500 a day and a heap of caps from questing. I am always at 30K and even after the weekly bullion dump I can grind it back in a couple of days no sweat.
---
That's actually a perfect explanation to EVERY weird shit one can see in this game. I've seen so many bugs in this game since I started playing I wonder if there's a QA part of their development team at all.
---
Same
---
Pretty much this, the fight would take forever to compete cause no one wants to waste ammo or wait for the meta build to one shot it in the face and kill it lol
---
Great idea!
---
First session I played after Wastelanders I ran into both a glowing mothman and the flatwoods monster. It was only my third encounter with the flatwoods monster. Since then I've only run into him one more time and found his body from someone else running into him.
---
Can someone confirm if luck has an impact on "rare encounters" ??? That would explain why it took me so long, my character is at 4.
---
Yeah I noticed my Syringer would sometimes have 5 darts loaded.
---
That last remark has some good concepts behind it, a questline about doing something to destroy or hunt Mothman and the cultists. Like with the queen fight, kill a unique Mothman (with a fight a bit more like (or more than) what the colossus fight was intended to be, with actual features and strategy and steps, not just kill the tank) and some sort of effect on either cultist spawns or a debuff applied would be really cool
---
Power Armor need set bonuses and immune to diseases with 1000 Rad Resistance.
---
Part of what I read is that gaining experience is part of gaining the levels for the roadmap or whatever, so my thinking is that starting a new toon will actually make it easier than doing it endgame as the story missions give a ton of xp. But I wouldn't quote me on that bc who knows what it actually ends up being honestly.
---
Sorry, no I was not. Beth launcher
---
I dunno, like.... when else would a throw on a boxing glove?
---
I did try this, also updated my drivers just in case with no luck
---
Good show!
---
Preach it
---
Sorry I don’t have damage numbers turned on but with no shotgun perks at all I took her down to half life in 10-12 shots from point blank range shooting almost inside her mouth.
---
So it would seem that each pellet does do the damage listed in your pip boy as opposed to each shot...so as long as your close enough for them all to hit then you’re kicking ass with even the worst shotgun (assuming you have at least one piece of armour with the needed effect).
---
I assume If I’d been using a bloodied shotgun she would have died in said 10-12 shots but I wasn’t.
---
I decided to start a new character and bequeath the shotgun to him
---
Lol no, there has not been any talk about more character slots. Be happy it's 5 and not 3.
---
It has to do with people over their camp budget using exploits, I consider this their karma lol
---
Wow that took a dark turn lol
---
I wonder why there's a Warden in the prison if that infamous criminal walks out every damn half an hour. I literally would be happy to finally end each of their miserable routine once and for all.
---
The red asylum dress still haunts my dreams lol
---
I would kill the bastard. He is the most annoying and stupid person of the entire fallout universe.
---
This ONLY problem would be of a size Bethesda never could do right.
---
Yeup. Iguana bits, or as they were called in Fallout one, "Chunks on a stick" (I know, ew), were human remains sold by Doc Morbid in the Junktown hospital.
---
Daaaaaaamn
---
I like the faster reload arms idea. Arms need something better. I wouldn’t mind a weapon weight reduction mod.
---
On the topic of power armor missing things. Where are the different headlamps for excavator, ultracite and t65? Also, why aren’t the headlamps available as plans for any of the models except for x-01?? Also, I noticed that VATS Matrix Overlay seems to only exist for X-01.... its a great helmet mod. It should exist for at least ultracite/strangler and t-65 as well. 
---
I think it would be nice if the jetpack was a passive mod so that the torso can have core assembly or emergency protocols etc.... applied to it. 
---
I don’t think it would break the game to allow the backpack mod effects to work while wearing power armor either. Let me have the grocers mod while in power armor. Then I can take off thru hiker 3 and run a little more adrenaline.
---
Removed: Debuffs (From being hungry)
---
Still in: Buffs (From eating, from being well fed)
---
I hope its score points and not just EXP gain because people will use the god mode glitch and hit rank 100 in a day or 2 but oh well, they're the one coming on here complaining that they have no new content.
---
well speaking as an aussie, a few kb of data can take longer for others :P 
---
jokes... but seriously, our internet is crap lol
---
Well due to the fact there are humans still alive in every single other fallout game, I think it's safe to say at least a few survive and reproduce don't you think?
---
You are doing God's work.
---
Delete its configuration files
---
Yeup. Iguana bits, or as they were called in Fallout one, "Chunks on a stick" (I know, ew), were human remains sold by Doc Morbid in the Junktown hospital. Actual "Iguana on a stick" seems to be real iguanas, also seemingly un-mutated by the bombs even two hundred+ years later in Fallout and fallout two. Probably why we don't see iguanas in game, flipping rocks to go find them isnt a feature and hunting them or adding them as an enemy is more than a little unrealistic given they're smaller than mutated ants or frogs.
---
Looks like someone requested too many water ices and Sunny finally flipped his lid.
---
Make it so that "spoiled" presents still use the same mesh and texture when inspected/displayed in a CAMP, but simply disappear from your inventory if you attempt to open them. I'd also give it a warning message similar to selling/scrapping favorited items, something like "opening this gift will only remove it from your inventory, are you sure you want to do this?"
---
Got it in my alt doing uranium fever
---
Lol yup
---
I thought my bridge was safe, for a sold two weeks nothing. Then twice had to log in just to find it was taken.  
---
It is definitely something they need to work out.
---
I should be able to up vote more....
---
That is exactly why I love bloodied, less ammo and resources to grind for.
---
I just wish there was an option to auto drop or to prevent certain items from being placed in your inventory. I'm sick and tired of doing heavy event grinding only to get weighted down by missiles and combat armor for example.
---
Yeah but then he'd only find you ravioli.
---
Because the game isn't fucking prescient?  The game has to load you into the world, look at who else is in the world and load where their camps are and then check if your camp is also present in one of those locations.
---
If the game were designed to NEVER even give you this option it would still take just as long for the game to do all of this, it would all just be happening behind a loading screen instead until it finally loaded you into a world with an open space.  HOWEVER if they did t hat it would be an even bigger pain in the ass because it would be totally locking you out of any world where y our camps spot was taken instead of giving you the option of whether or not you give a shit.
---
Also because the game was never designed to do any of this in the first place and had to be jury rigged just to reach the point where we are now where it even asks you if you want to try loading into another world.  Anyone that's played since the beta knows that even before we had the current system the game didn't even bother telling you that you'd loaded into a world without your camp and before even that if you loaded into a world where your spot was taken your camp just stopped existing all together.
---
I have scars from all the head scratching Bethesda makes me do about problems like this. It really seems like the most simple thing to fix. Why isn’t it fixed yet? 😤
---
In the middle of no where!
---
𝙱𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚂𝚊𝚠 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yeah, chinese stealth sniper with a instigating lever.
---
Make sure you do not have the Starched Genes perk equiped under Luck.
---
Then take Radaway until mutations are gone. They will be randomly removed as you consume Radaway.
---
Also, you can remove mutations with a decontamination shower. There is one at the entrance of Blackwater Mine.
---
People are really overthinking the whole Seasons thing. Everyone can do it. It’s just a reworking of the challenge system with lots of new rewards. There’s not any actual gameplay content to it. 
---
You’ll do daily and weekly challenges like you always did, but now they give you SCORE points. They say they’ll be simpler, we’ll see. Earning XP and completing public events will also give you SCORE. Those points will allow you to rank up and get rewards.
---
Mole Miners seem to be a helluva lot more accurate with those missile launchers than I am.
---
And then you have to make sure Mad Dog Malone doesn't get out. Again.
---
Bethesda announces in a week that enemies will no longer leave loot behind on the ground after despawning.
---
Glowing Mothman????  Was it legendary?  Either way I've yet to see that.
---
If you take day tripper first
---
If you disabled vsync in your custom.ini, it might not actually be disabled. My game in particular completely ignores vsync settings in the custom config, so I have to disable it in prefs.
---
See ya there 💪
---
Hoagies and water ice too lol. Maybe he could come with 2 programs, like medical Sunny and general Sunny.  Regardless id probably program him to Proletariat anyways.
---
Morgantown too. Very reliable nuke site for Cobalt if I recall.
---
😂😂
---
You sound like one of Todds boyfriends tbh
---
With her husband Eustace Bagge !
---
Me too
---
cause it takes 5 fucking photos till one registers
---
I've kept my vendors running the entire time and I've never had a single issue. Hell to be honest I love when people are complaining about vendor issues and more people panic taking their vendors down as it sends more traffic through my camp. I was making twenty thousand caps a day when people took their vendors down. First time I've ever hit Max caps and nothing was sold that I didn't put there.
---
I've heard but can't confirm that in order to get the queen ticked off the list you need to be the absolute last registered hit on her, get the killing blow.
---
There are 3 moth men
---
Nope. Not legendary. There's vengeful with red eyes, stalking with yellow, glowing with green, wise with purple and the scorched variant you sometimes see at the queen. Go to a cultist camp around 2 am in game time and sometimes they will spawn there. Mothman is definitely more common since Wastelanders. Flatwoods monster is still rare. I've only seen him alive four times on my level 340ish character.
---
I'm pretty sure that I got the magazine and bobblehead achievements back at launch by finding one of each and placing it in my stash, collecting it to my inventory, and doing that X amount for the achievement. I know I did it with the Bobblehead because at the time I had only two till the first new years.
---
That's amazing, truly worthy of Mr. Pebbles.
---
I had no issues with getting locations in the big, but I somehow fucked up with the ash heap though, that one town in the bottom corner I can't remember the name of for the life of me (probably because I haven't bothered getting on in almost a month)
---
Please do not ask him for water ice. Water cannot also be ice.
---
Eating and drinking in this game aren't survival elements once you've mastered the awesome feats of building a water purifier and eating dog food, after that point they're just repetitive chores. 
---
Nothing is lost by removing them from the game entirely, no one makes their livings off of selling purified water to people that have infinite supplies of purified water or selling food that spoils before anyone can even buy it.
---
Eating and drinking should exist solely for the sake of healing or providing buffs and nothing more.
---
5 different Scorchbeast meat cooked individually + 2 boiled water. 1020hp, 110% food, 30% water, +3 agl,lck,int,end, 15dr, cost 7 wood, 
---
Scorchbeast mixed meat stew. 250hp, 1 lck,int,agl, 2 end, 35% food, 42% water, cost 1 wood and 1 pepper.
---
The reason to cook the more complex recipe is to save wood and get more water out of your boiled water.
---
I seriously love the Sunnys. Everyone of their lines cracks me up. I would love to see it as a collectron with some more lines.
---
If you haven't gotten help from anyone else yet, I also need to revive a swimming player (as well as the standard revive required to go from Tadpole to Possum; hopefully doing it in water counts for both). My name ingame is the same as my username here.
---
Thank you! I made a post out of it and haven't done that here yet so you inspired me.
---
I'm really looking forward to that new glow-in-the-dark starry wallpaper. I think when that arrives I'll redo it all, maybe with some neon stars too. It must be perfect, *to honor him!*
---
...Maybe we should start a cult?
---
Just respawn you mean ??
---
I would love help! I got to the final room twice, took waayy too much time getting lost to get back there a 3rd time and gave up. My ign is blueberrisundae
---
They should make it a tongue-in-cheek Easter egg where you can hold the charge button down so long as you still have fusion cells so you can charge it for like an hour and unleash a super blast and all your FCs at once. Just like the OG bug. But this time it does do the like 200000 damage.
---
Queen was the mini boss, I think we know who the real boss is
---
It’s not looking good. It took the Sims 4 like 6 years for them to finally get spiral staircases.
---
US-13C Bivouac.  Basically connected to West Tec.  My camp is just south of it and I go there to farm magazines and bobblehead, 2 of each possible.  I've seen the Flatwoods Monster there at least a dozen times since Wastelanders.  Also it's always ghouls there now while it was random before.  Mothman can spawn just north of the Bivouac, fairly common.
---
It isn't, people just can't fucking learn to stop hoarding.
---
You don't need the VAST majority of scrap in this game because almost every single piece can be farmed in mass quantities in short order just by knowing where to look and/or what to kill and most legendary gear people hold onto is never going to be used and is better off going into a scrip machine or being left on the ground.
---
I have seen perfect bikes in the wasteland and don’t understand why we can’t ride them. I mean we can navigate endless factions and quests, launch a nuclear bomb, and build camps and get vendors running, but we can’t fix a freaking bicycle? Go figure.
---
i could not make it work only by throwing (unnameditem) at camp items outside of pvp on ps4 
---
...
---
The game after the story devolves into nothing but this, even the Ally system just turns into fetch quests after awhile.   
---
They really need to trying to find ways to let players create their own narrative by focusing more on the Roleplay aspect or by letting us have some ability to customise our own missions.   
---
Gives us the ability to create our own short missions which have a random chance of spawning in the game world. If you want to quality control it then have some form of approval process but god stop making fetch crap all day.  
---
Let me join a faction officially with friends, where we can make sub-factions of that group with those friends. different sub-factions can be roleplay focused or mission focused but make it easier to get engaged with people and the game in a fun way.  
---
Focus on the social and fun part of the game, stop focusing on the skinner box side.
---
Those are blood eagles
---
Man, just get rid of the turrets. They're a waste of your space! They don't accomplish anything! They might kill the occasional mole rat. Currently, I've got one turret in my camp, and it's not doing jack. Settler Wander does more to protect my camp than the turret when she's not playing the same guitar riff until her fingers bleed, she really wants to be in a band, you know? 
---
Free yourself! Free your build budget! Scrap your turrets!
---
To be honest, the settlers at Foundation in general just feel really shallow as a faction.   
---
The first settlement they make in the region is called "Foundation". How long did they sit around the table thinking about that genius name for the new settlement?
---
Gonna' be real with you, my friend: Moth*men* doesn't have the same ring to it.
---
Do we really want 96 reopened, though?
---

Hey at least I have someone who loves me.
---
All you got is playing a game and suporting a company that you are you unhappy with.
---
Me and Todd thank you for your money, it helped pay for the lovely gifts he gives me.
---
I don’t think that will work if I can just toss a grande to do the job for me
---
Mine is ok, NBN and FTB - 47Mbps is ok. Mind you I got faster than that in Japan 15 years ago...
---
 lol   Then he thanks you when he gets the saw, or medical thing back, and quickly adds " I've got my eye on you"
---
I found a pair of soldiers outside of Harper's Ferry. They were sitting on the other side of the bridge facing away from Harper's Ferry. I've also seen the same pair across from the Gorge Junkyard Workshop in the random encounter that happens there. They really don't have much dialogue. I've been wondering about what was happening with them.
---
Lvl 1 Soldiers?
---
Found them near Wayside. I had not seen them before.
---
I’m on Xbox.
---
They sound like a decent person who realizes that people can make mistakes and at the very least respects them when they try to remedy them. You, fella, sound like a whiny bastard who doesn't have anything else to knit pick and complain about anymore and has moved on to *remarkably* childish comebacks like this and just being a tad hypocritical, given I can say with certainty that you have or at some point will have to make a compromise like that. A company is still run by people and people will never be perfect, I know I'm a fine example of how imperfect a human can be, and you aren't perfect either, if you were you'd at the **very** least, put more than a fifth grade level of thought into your attempted insult type retorts.
---
If you loot it or switch servers, yes.
---
I have my doubts. I have 5 luck on 1 character, and he's seen it 4-5 times. I have a base of 8 luck on another character, and he's only seen it once or twice. It does seem to appear mostly at night though.
---
It's not the fact of actually playing with another person, it's being made to if you want the score or whatever the new system is, though I'm sure t may ny be that bad to reach 100 eventually with missed challenges. Not sure what you on about with the serum stuff no one mentioned selling XD dont see much doing here in console land luckily
---
I activated the bug for myself when I bought the Turret item from a vendor about a month ago.  Praised Azura ever since.
---
Not Blood Eagles, they're listed as Soldiers and they're not hostile to the player.
---
Can confirm, that's how mine got bugged.  It also works if you have the quest and you pick up that item from the ground and loot your item from the corpse.
---
yeah its it acts like legacy explosive.
---
Another day, another BoS RP group. I'd join but I'm already in one.
---
There aren't any NEAR VAULT 76 did you even read it there are only blood eagles near v76
---
I feel like bloodied pvp build players would go for the raiders
---
Make that 5 truly a blessing. I love my portable power cell ❤️
---
Hope we find out more about them in the future.
---
There's already a little load screen between the point you click find-game and your client actually connects to the server and loads the map. That's where the bethesda server manager is either trying to find an already running server for you, or spinning up a new one.
---
This might add a couple of seconds to that stage, but there would be a big difference vs time it takes for your game to load the map.
---
The soldiers that OP is talking about aren't Blood Eagles.
---
It was nothing special. Pretty much the SBQ fight but underground in a much more confined space. It wasn't shit, it just felt like more of the same.
---
That Scorchbeast isn't supposed to be able to fly.
---
I've duo'd the queen several times. I've checked with partners afterwards, neither one of it had it. Buddy solo'd the queen, and he doesn't have it either.
---
Yup
---
Oh yeah "I wish their was an alternative to violence"  
---
"Well so do I Ward but the developers didn't really give me much choice on that matter so just deal with it. See you tomorrow!"
---
And so it begins... 😉😂🤣
---
They’re a random encounter that can be found almost anywhere, it’s a pretty cool one
---
Ok I was wondering why we have them
---
I have no idea, but my 15 luck character just about always, almost every time I fast travel, has some sort of event happen. Bandit bot, insult bot, the mothman, and I swear the prize bot wants my body it shows up so much.
---
Just started playing VATS heavy characters with Wastelanders, my others only have 5 luck.
---
I've scrapped my power armor before, but the pieces were still in my inventory. So, I just had to find another chassis to put them back on. Have you checked to make sure if the armor pieces are still in your inventory?
---
in fo4 i don’t think i ever discovered all of the workshops. lol
---
I run into a Mothman about once a week.
---
It’s your build. I can deal over 2000 damage with a non legendary The Fixer. You are probably not bloodied either.
---
You are welcome
---
https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1KDLtvkwVa7thH-zvXRkxwIs2DNm1a6R-EIltxeFXDVU/
---
it's not a survival game, it's a sandbox with light survival elements. a survival game is something like rust or the forest.
---
I've been running my camps without them for months, and I've not missed them. The turrets are useful in workshops, but in your CAMP, they just don't do much of anything for some reason.
---
Me too.
---
Yup it's a major thing for shotguns and a bit for heavy. Has vats cards for em as well.
---
That should be a mod for that gun
---
Yes it's rare! I sell them for 5k all day long.
---
It would add even more power onto already op characters that have no enemies or activities to match up. 
---
I think it would be nice to see 4 and 5 star gear added, but make them much higher level requirements. Like 100 for 4 and 150 for 5. It would create a new shift in what the most powerful items are and render pretty much all remaining duped and hacked hear near worthless. 
---
But the "rebalance" of the game that Bethesda has mentioned working on and implementing in the future would need to come first. To give enemies and activities a chance to require more powerful builds at higher levels.
---
There are random encounter locations all over the map, and there seems to be even more since wastelanders. Prize bot and insult bot show up a lot more now too. I will say I've seen observant radstag more since gaining +4 luck playing on a team w/herd mentality mutation.
---
That does sound like a neat idea. It could be a Fallout 1st Exclusive, Caps Safe which would allow you to store an additional 30k caps, resulting in the possibility of having 60k caps on a single character.
---
No, it would need to load a couple of points, draw a circle around them and see if they overlap.
---
The thing that annoys me is the signs of writers who obviously would of loved to write a better story but due to budget and the game itself were limited.
---
Like christ, why make the Settlers a new faction? Why not make it the Responders coming back?
---
Why not have the Responders reoccupying Flatwood made up of Vault-Dwellers, Migrants and people returning to the region. Why have a situation where you're after Gold in some weird thing about rebuilding the country when the real story should be fighting between the Raiders and Responders.
---
Instead of giving the Raiders a fortress, they should be thinly spread out across camps they operate from. Your missions are to raid and harass the Responders meanwhile the Responders are this time around made up of harder stuff and won't be put down so easily.
---
Then with this current roadmap you have the return (not the arrival) of the Brotherhood.
---
I liked the idea of the Responders, it was Bethesda actually being clever and creating their own engaging Lore in the Fallout universe. A faction put together by Emergency Services could be really interesting as services used to running in a world of Law and Order have to work without either.
---
But no, the original Responders died, all you get now are two NPC's who aren't even Responders, they just wish to be and the Brotherhood from the West Coast somehow manages to get the Resource to send a expedition across the damn continent because Bethesda wants fan service.
---
I roleplay an refugee child who fled the destruction of the Brotherhood when he was a teen who lost everything, but I didn't want them to come back into the scene like this. If they exist they should be a small faction, struggling onto existence in a larger bunker somewhere.
---
Yeah I waited till level 306 to launch my first lol
---
The same thing happens to me and it sucks hope they fix it
---
They aren’t in there.
---
I ran into them once over by Anchor Farm whilst trying to farm the wandering trader. Also encountered a group of scientists once.
---
Glad about that, and yeah, and I'll check that.
---
I have no doubt that the team loves the game, it really shows with all the details they are putting in. I just disagree with the business side of things mostly,  I believe if it was up to the devs, between deadlines, bugs etc. they would have prioritized fixing the game first. But my criticism about legendary talents stands, they were pretty bad in their majority, also the fact that they're removing the survival aspect of the game. (No penalties for not eating and drinking later on)
---
ohhh..... BETHESDA you tease....i am so excited for this update. Have tissues and will expect my heart to be broken.....hopefully not.
---
114th here.
---
if that happened recently you got lucky and found someone who didn't know they had dropped, the demand for them has tapered off significantly (probably because of people asking for ridiculous things like legacies and b2525 fixers / handmades) it will take a while to find someone even willing to pay 20 k for one
---
A normal wood staircase would be nice.
---
I kind of wonder the same thing about 'diseased' ghouls. I mean, they're irradiated - borne of radiation, so why are they diseased? 
---
The only conclusion I've been able to settle on is that Bethesda has effectively suspended existing Fallout Lore in favor of monetizing the franchise at every turn regardless of logic or prior existing lore parameters.
---
Sometimes I get this when I load into a cell/fast travel. Try aiming down your sights. If it’s the same problem I have, that *should* fix it.
---
Honestly the WC is pretty lack luster itself. And the event was even more so.
---
While I haven’t ran across that specific bug. I have had quest marks not show up on the map or the compass. Iv also had it send me to the wrong area before. I think since the wastelander update map markers have been really buggy. Never had much of an issue before the big update
---
I agree that this has to be worked in and if not expanded on. I want it so that I not only get a bonus from joining the Brotherhood but can actually join teams of other Brotherhood members.  
---
I would make it so you can change weekly at the least but ultimately make it work like joining a faction in other MMO's where they're ranks and decisions.  
---
Like playing as the Brotherhood, declaring the Raiders as enemies because they attacked a base.  
---
Also would make bases something more player controlled, make some people work out of Fort Defiance BUT I would also make it so teams of players can actually merge their CAMPS closer together and form bases themselves.   
---
I feel like this stuff is just common sense but they just keep going for the options that they hope will favour monetisation. If people can make their own fun then they won't need to buy stuff from the Atomic Shop of Fallout 1st.
---

---
Click on submit ticket down below. 
---
This, together with bug report should exist through the game in this day and age, but oh well. XD
---
Yeah, I farm quite a few of them.
---
Ones I'm meaning are like my camp, outside the Wayward, Whitesprings, Overseer's House, etc generic places.
---
The prize bot and insult bot show up in literally the middle of nowhere. I was walking around the map border wasting time and ran into multiple of them.
---
I have ran into that Ms Nanny that wants you to use a recon scope a good bit more now too, but I never use recon scopes, and have no idea what it does.
---
There should be an option like "Find server where CAMP can be placed" or something like that  
---
Had to hop 4 servers once to finally spawn my CAMP
---
I know this is old, but here's my two caps:
---
Go vats heavy, max gun fu, max grim reaper sprint. You can clear all of the mobs from a SBQ in a single mag with no break in vats. Single shots for 3k damage, auto swap targets, AP will refresh on at least one target.  I can two shot a level 80 scorchbeast, and headshots on the queen do 350 dmg (450 w crit). 
---
Obv the DPS is too low for queen, so throw in a bloodied gauss mini as a special present for her. I exclusively use my plasma caster on everything but the queen and Colossus, and have killed the queen in less than 3 min with my bloodied GMG.
---
Dealing less damage doesn’t makes the game challenging. It’s just a waste of resources.
---
Want a challenge? Go project paradise/ radiation rumble without failing
---
It’s for captain daguerre, she’s been giving everyone headaches
---
I make most of my caps on bulked plastic and aluminum. I sell all resources for 2 caps per unit, so no matter the material, if it bulks 10 units it’s 20 caps. Used to sell screws and acid like crazy, too, but have been running out of both lately and can’t justify selling ‘em.
---
Dam i'd kill for that.... I'm peaking at 15mbps if i'm lucky... I average around 10 on a good day lol
---
There’s a dupe going on...
---
Which one is Revolutionary? Liberty Prime?
---
Cool. Here's hoping something is developed.
---
No, I really didn't "get lucky" at all. I don't think you know the market well.
---
Thanks for the indepth reply, the right information I was looking for.
---
What about the scrapbox? 
---
Does that mean the more FO1st players on a public server, the worse the server performance?
---
Agree. Just more random encounters and wandering menacing enemies will be great.
---
Loaded in a nuke zone.
---
Couldn't place camp.
---
Couldn't place tent.
---
I'm in!
---
There s believe iy not, that one documentary they kind of made it sound like there only real job was to find the funny glitches like Giants mega bouncing anything they hit and making sure it stays in the game
---
It's saying that this sub is mainly full of whiny individuals who are about to blow their brains out because Bethseda is supposedly taking away their pvp and  griefing enjoyment against ( usually lower level ) pve players that just want to play the game without getting tricked into some pvp exploit where their camps are destroyed and characters killed. Something like that.
---
Most Survival games I’ve played let you build storage boxes. You put one kind of resource here, another there, etc. You can (and should) create organized storehouses for various things. I certainly did in Fallout 4. And I have a truly giant one in Minecraft; on a Realm no less.
---
76 gives you one lump storage value. Two, if you buy First.   
---
My solution would be to attach a weight value to the various containers you can build, and have that value added to the total weight of the stash. For example, a crate with a value of 50 would raise the stash to 850.   
---
They could even categorize them; like a dresser that shows stored apparel, gun safe that shows weapons, and so on.
---
Level 59 here and it was fun to see it go down
---
Lmfao
---
yeah you did, i got one out of a vendor for 15 k a week or two ago thinking it would be a bit of easy profit, nope. i only got 2 offers, one was a lowball and the other offered me a bear arm plan that he retracted almost immediately, it wasn't just me either, i saw other people trying to sell them and no one was biting, the demand simply isn't there anymore. i don't think you know the market well
---
I suspect during development they kind of knew were everyone’s camp was and tended to avoid each others camps. then along came all of us and, well, aparently I’m not the only one parking my camp on an acidspring Because gunpowder And everything else that uses it.
---
Just take everything out of it and it will disapear.
---
Once you get the hang of it it really is not an issue not having a scrap box. Go through your junk.
---
The weight is per item. When you check and there is eg. 700 raw asbestos in there, at 0.003 weight. That's 21 lbs!! Sell excess crap like that. you don't need all that junk all the time.
---
a few bulk items, except lead &amp; steel, is plenty. 
---
and dump those known plans. they add up. 
---
I have 4 vending machines, can craft what i need with minimal to know extra searching, with at least 50 space available.
---
PS: Craft ammo. with bandolier it weighs less than junk.
---
hoarding heavy weapons, carry them all with bear arms instead of storing etc.
---
Rachel wants you to tag (not kill) a given quantity of critters with recon scope. She will give you a small reward afterwards. Easy to do if you have such a weapon.
---
Hello adventurer!
---
Epic NPC, love them
---
I’d love to see the Order resurrected, but not as a faction, per se. I would rather build up a set of quests surrounding the re-establishment of the organization that could have several repeating quest types. If factions like these came to fruition (which I’d love so much), I’d prefer the Order to be operating in the shadows to protect multiple groups from various threats. Similar to protecting the caravans, but without being seen. Or dismantling a horde attack of raiders on a settler/bunker location in a situation that prevents sniping. If there were a few different types of these quests, I could see myself spending most of my play time on them, even if rewards are paltry... just let us upgrade the Garb and veil to be more protective so it is viable in the later game.
---
No one knows. They pushed it back
---
In order for that to make sense, the weapons would have to work as intended first. Otherwise a ranking just indicates, who found and used the most broken weapon.
---
Besides that I am against any kind of scoreboard or ranking. It could antagonize a lot of players, who play casually.
---
Tldr; there is a huge time commitment with little incentive to play. 
---
Alright for the most part I was in the same boat as you. I played at beta and decided not to buy because there simply wasn't any content I found interesting.
---
Recently when wastelanders went on sale I got it because for 30$ it can't be too much of a loss.
---
To put it blunty. It only took 50 hours to finish the wastelander quests + all ally quests + a ton of the side missions. Your mileage may very but im now level 54 i believe and there is no "end game" content. 
---
This season pass thing is not end game content,  it just adds to the grind in the "end game". 
---
I literally said out loud "thats it?" Because of how disappointed I was in the end game.
---
To sum up end game. Youre gonna farm for loot. You are gonna sell loot for scrips. Youre gonna buy more loot be it weapons or guns until you find ones perfect for either pvp or pve. Youre gonna rinse repeat until you get the legendary loot you want.
---
Not to mention there is another late game currency. You  can farm them but you can only redeem 200 per day. I think you can get 300-600 more per week if you pay like 6k caps or something. But anyways. Theres a cap. Even if you have 400 of the currency items dollerydoos worth you can only redeem 200 worth. 
---
Theres caps to the grind. You can only sell so many legendary items per day because of the cap. You can only get so many of the other late game currency because of the cap.
---
I love the game at its base because its a fallout game but I do not know how other people got to levels like 200 or 500. Its too god damn grindy with virtually 0 reward.
---
I did not, man I'm telling you. The market sub was *hot* for croc backpacks. You just weren't shopping yours to the right crowd.
---
another vendor for the longcoat is the random travelling vendor that can be found in the building near the bus-stop at tanagra town quite often
---
I can give you like 5000 .308 for free if you like.
---
i add most ppl from this subred 
---
psn: Owl_No
---
Assaultron Dominator Lazer - burns through T-65 like it's butter in less than five seconds and laughs at your stats.
---
Chop it off and use it as an Assaultron Head - glorified camping stove. 
---
Definitely needs something....!
---
You are the problem
---
*tearful salute intensifies*
---
Can give you some if you still need.
---
Just today i was thinking the same. Why are they there if they are not open? The raid for 94 was ok, but why put vaults in the game if they are just there serving no purpose? I'd love to see some quests, and even just to check lore in those places would be amazing.
---
You can?
---
Yeah add me PSN: Shablagoobuddy I'll hop on just now
---
Group play is literally no different than team play. You don't need to follow anyone around.
---
If you *really* need Lone Wanderer, your build is severely lacking in other departments
---
Yeah more like 90 percent of quests
---
For not wanting challenges to not be group required?  Okkkkkkk, but no. Nothing wrong with grouping up if you feel like it but shouldn't mandatory.
---
Sounds great
---
My CAMP turrets usually take care of wandering monsters so I don't have to stop what I'm doing, and I didn't like returning to my CAMP to find walls missing. It should not be difficult to prevent npcs and neutral animals from attacking inanimate objects.
---
What I get from it is that a level requires 1 hour to 2 hours of normal play, not counting the seperate challenges to gain whatever the system is called again. So I guess with active farming it might be faster.
---
Haha congrats you played yourself
---
If only they could press the same button to stop the decontamination arch they just turn on pressing that button.
---
How much you need?
---
also very excited for MORE FALLOUT 76!!!!
---
Do you have raw or pure?
---
Stable

3

I know, the storytelling is one thing in the game that was still phenomenal, at least when it was given liberty. I loved seeing the miss nanny with a messed up personality, and then seeing the terminal entry at the robco factory where a guy talked about programming said nanny. Small details like that are what make exploring fun. Not a fan of everything else that is clearly forced in to fit a certain requirement instead of for the joy of creating something meaningful
---
Cool
---
how
---
Because nowadays they count as orbital strikes from their heads.
---
That'd be awesome. I'm gonna need a fuckin shit load if I'm gonna do a heavy weapon build, lolz.
---
This is so similar to the soap box I’ve been on! I hope this gets signal boosted like crazy :)
---
One big thing I’d want with a real faction system is unlockable faction-specific gear that you don’t need to buy or exchange for, but rather earn access to check out based on your level in the organizations. Like how we all have access to specific special quest reward weapons, make the faction gear obtainable by anyone rather than RNG and based on earned faction points to simply unlock from a commissary rather than  bought with a currency. Anyone can check out a BFG or actually useful energy weapons and retooled PA from the Brotherhood, for instance, once you reach a certain rank but it drops from your inventory at log-out.
---
I sat there thinking about getting it lmao literally all that stopped me was not knowing what's coming tomorrow and wanting to have atoms left lol, I'm sure it'll come back to the store one day too
---
I do like it, but the biggest question is do you think you'll actually wear it?
---
I was going to use it for a character based on Sportsmaster from the new DC Show Stargirl, I found the character really entertaining lmao
---
By throwing those meat bombs. Destroyed the whole camp. Complete douchebag!
---
Probably explosive bait
---
Uhm that's not a subversion. This game is technically Fallout 4 online. Any Fallout 4 assets you don't see are still part of the download.
---
What’s really BS is that they don’t seem to have a cooldown after firing once.
---
That's exactly what it was. I was upset and couldn't think of what they are called. I never did anything to this player.
---
Two Soldiers can also be found at the small camp site where doing Photo Opportunity with Crater targets can send you.
---
This is Fallout Shelter 76.
---
Can't wait for year 3 road map when they finally announce removing all aid except for Stimpak, Radaway and Nuka Cola
---
some people are just assholes. did you contact him?
---
I’ll upvote for you!!
---
Radaway will get rid of them
---
It's the REEEEEEAL fans
---
I just server hop when I get the prison
---
Only by doing the the thumbs down to the person after they did the damage. I left the server after that.
---
90% of this community is great, but there will always be trolly assholes no matter where you go -.-
---
Hope you have enough for repairs
---
To waste your time so you don't complete the Atom Challenges too quickly
---
I don't but thanks
---
You can try to just move your camp a few inches/feet and, if successful it should rebuild all with no cost. Otherwise equip max Contractor card and use your CAMP to repair all.
---
Literally thought it was just me! Thank god i’m not going insane and my Two Shot western revolver really DOES have 500 rounds in the mag
---
Change flair to Wendigo, son.
---
if this is correct i will be using this. i need all the STR i can get and +4 will be the best item i can use.
---
Yeah that's even worse
---
Are you on Xbox? If so I can repair it for you, I've been trying to help people out lately lol
---
To a degree there is but, at the same time you have a game like EvE that usually manages to pull off real time inventory management in real time On a far larger scale. Granted they do have there share of problems.  but having 1000+ players on the map at one time is not something your likely to see anytime soon.
---
PC here
---
Griefers have been using those a lot more lately. Pretty annoying that they don't need to PvP to use them as well. 
---
I only use them if someone has a trap in their camp and steals all my junk.
---
She once sent me to Wavy Willards and upon my return she uttered that line. 
---
No, Wren. I didn't go to Watoga. I practically went across the street. Now that my rep with you shitheads is maxed, you can find your own damn radio tubes. 
---
Now, I'll only "help" Rocksy for settlers rep.
---
Damn lol, good luck anyway :)
---
I have a Ultracite JP helmet! I cherish that thing as a relic from a bygone era
---
Good point with stims though, bit of bad example
---
Idk what a twoshot anti armor shotgun build is but it sounds like you have a bad build. Just cause they kill u doesnt mean they are hacking. They optimized their build to do more dmg. Its not an issue with the game, its just how people play it. Like literally mad cause bad
---
When you hit level 300, you are able to do this.
---
Maybe you should level up more you noob
---
A good Sunny quest would be having one Sunny sending you to sabotage one of the other Sunnys.
---
Ignoring him would be the best thing to do. Those guys only want attention.
---
Can you tell me what happens to my stuff that I spent atoms on? That was destroyed as well.
---
Wrong, shooting is the intended use of weapons in games, so of course they should do that as often and as much as they want. While in society there are very rarely situations, were anyone should shoot. That comparison is faulty.
---
Yes and if you consume them all they can track that too. You're going down kiddo
---
Working on it asswipe
---
You can repair it just like the other stuff :) no worries there
---
They literally had to make it so the entire quest revolved around introducing a end-game currency, again to appeal to players focused on needing 100% completion and not to a part of the fanbase that could definitely keep this game alive... the roleplayers and story lovers.  
---
But roleplayers and people who love story don't always care about collection everything to 100% and won't be too motivated to spend countless $$$ at the Atomic Shop for mainly lore-breaking cosmetic items.  
---
They also won't be that invested in the benefits of 1st because the benefits again aren't focused on that. I don't want NCR Ranger armour, I bought it because I was getting suck of not being able to store all my junk
---
One of my favourite moments was Commander Daguerre and her questline. It was a bit out there and different, they seem to actually take some chances with her story and you could tell that somebody actually wanted to tell a more engaging story but were limited by the scope of the game.  
---
I only recently got back into the game and finished the entire story, I am imagining I will spend probably another two weeks tops cleaning up questions and such before the game is put away for the next big update and that is definitely going to be the fanbase attitude that is going to kill this game because one day the updates won't come anymore.
---
It's a random encounter.
---
They're nobody. It's not lore
---
Thanks 😊
---
wow, they are real?? played like 200 hours now and thought they are just campfire stories. will have to look up where i can meet them...
---
Similar bug was explained in more detail by the same dude publishing duping methods on YouTube. :) 
---
Basically you need secondary weapon with big mag (like flamer or minigun) and then switch between guns while continuing on shooting. With right timing on switching weapons suddenly gun with small mag will obtain mag size of secondary gun.
---
Insert shit post about reading comprehension
---
No problem :) if there's anything else you want to know feel free to ask, I'm passing out shortly but I'll get back to you
---
they should reintroduce the excavator-double-carryweight feature, the fusioncore-autorecharges-upon-logging-in feature, the murgh/legendarymashine-lets-you-buy-stuff-others-exchanged feature, the armor-does-not-break feature, the unyielding-cha-lets-you-share-perks feature, and maybe the see-teamleaders-questmarkers feature
---
No you can't have it you free loader.
---
Go try dying to bloat flies until you get one
---
Depends where you camp.  To say they don’t do anything isn’t true.  Positioning is key.  Spotlights help...sometimes.  Sometimes they won’t do anything until attacked. But at least it’s a warning.  Some areas have will always spawn enemies in and it can be tedious and annoying having to fix everything that is wrecked 
---
One of my characters had a CAMP at an oil spawn and two ticks ALWAYS spawn there.  If I’m there they will spawn. If someone comes to check my vendor - they also will spawn.  Without the turrets they will just wreck havoc.  And they give me the creeps so I don’t want to deal with them haha 
---
That being said, I haven’t encountered this issue in awhile.  Idk why it happens.  When I would camp near the top of the world junk pile it would happen frequently.
---
Agree wholeheartedly
---
Answer to 13. They get a virus
---
Try reading the HELP menu directly above EXIT GAME
---
i fully expect you now TAKE 250 damage while reloading
---
No. BOS builds need to stay in the trash where they belong
---
I got a Bloodied 50% Crit 25 LVC Gauss Pistol...not a gunslinger and can't trade that thing... :-)
---
keyword "was", i'm not disagreeing that that was the case, i was on there looking for the plans from the pails too and i saw people offering legacies and shit loads of other stuff, but even towards the end of the event the offers started dropping lower and lower, if they appeared at all.
---
Uh, no? When hunger and thirst are removed from the game, and if item durability were gone, you'd be just as alive as you were before, but even *more* so because you'll never starve. I am not arguing against the benefits of food (healing, or bonuses such as up to +70% melee damage bonus). Hunger, thirst, and item durability add nothing to the game.
---
For caps you can be a water farmer. Build your camp next to a good water source like a pond or stream, make like 10 medium or 5 large water purifiers, lock them, collect the water often and you can easily drain the vendor bots 1400 daily caps.
---
Not true , my final word is max level while my vats unknown is 20 yet I did both missions in the same camp spot.
---
Pro tip. Level had nothing to do with this
---

Ward wants his Lovense back!:😭
---
PVP is broken, especially if the other side is spamming quantum's and stealth boys.
---
Nuke mines and explosive bait want a word with you.
---
Yep! The best dupers had a private world where they could place their camps, and they used somebody as an anchor to a world where they couldn’t place their camp.
---
Max endurance/HP isn't in line with the damage numbers one can achieve with dedicated builds.
---
the horsepocket!! 
---
to everyone thinking "wtf?": check the viva la dirt league youtube channel. its awesome :)
---
I’ve had to do 20 and still not place my camp. I didn’t play that day.

---
Nah endgame wise the game is pretty easy to maintain. Youll see when you get there. The main things that will take up your time are nuke runs, rep grind, and gold grind. 
---
If you want to switch it out, it's up to you. Only thing you really need to worry about is your special and perk cards. Since respecing is a huge hassle. My build is setup to support how frequently i get bored. I made it so that I have the special in the right spots to use any weapon in the game and be effective at it. Power armor or no PA builds too. The only downside is i can't do vats focused builds or support.
---
As for legendary gear acquisition there's a lot of ways. There's a trading system that relies on trusting player courier. But i wouldn't worry about that. That place is mainly for min/maxers. I've gotten god level legendary items from player run shops and drops frequently enough and cheaply enough to not care about it too much. You also have events, the rusty pick, and I'm sure seasons may have legendary drops.
---
Baaaad news billy is already a thing though.
---
The Ram?
---
Damn, this just happened to me. I crafted "Secret Service Right Arm" with 1 adhesive, 2 leather, 1 legendary module, 6 plastic, 2 rubber and 10 steel. I had 4 legendary modules and I'm now showing 3 modules available, but I don't see that piece of armor in my inventory or stash box.
---
The Battering Ram
---
I saw a player who was afk but had the auto fire bug with his hunting rifle.
---
I got up real close in his face to get him to shoot me, but no dice - he was running Pacifist and Fireproof mods.
---
I then figured out a plan to help him before he ran out of ammo.  I fast traveled to my camp, grabbed Nuke Mines and my Rose Syringer, and returned.
---
He was still firing!
---
I shot him with a dart and threw a mine at his feet. Kaboom!! After a few seconds, he died - finally free from his torment.
---
He even dropped me a big bag of 10 Stable Flux - what a nice guy!! :)
---
I think today is the update
---
The build isn't bad, I one shot sheepsquatch and other high level enemies. I fought level  100's and didn't have this problem. These two wouldn't take any damage even from a fatman
---
You'll change your tune by Uranium Fever #111

What is the optimal way to complete the dailies? The Charisma options (sending the raider to foundation, and making the raider thief pay for the stolen goods)?
---
Also, where do I start photo opportunity?
---
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE!?!
---
14 makes a good point: qhat powerful weapons were there on chinese or sovjet side? how are these countries looking? were there some kinds of vaults too?  
---
the more i think about it: id love to have a fallout bejing or moskwa. that would have so much possibilities, man id buy that at once.
---
No you can't beat perfection
---
I just killed one in woods SE, it was lvl90 and lot of spawns but lucky for me i had armor and alot of stimpaks and he just stuck between trees but i needed about 5000-7000 .50 bullets to kill him i have his whistle organ now.
---
I have no issue with diseased robots, but I wish they had different sets of diseases, as they’d be a different vector. I mean, tetanus is seriously debilitating and there are some serious toxicity concerns with getting cut on machines with oil residues, not to mention the likelihood of getting various enterobacteria blood infections from getting cut or shot by the robots in Appalachia, and none of these are present in the game.
---
I launch tons of nukes and nothing is more rewarding than having a player spawn their camp in just before the nuke lands
---
What "items" are you talking about?
---
YES finally we will all be wearing our SS Uniforms! Heil Howard!!
---
They really are a prime opportunity to test a king-of-the-hill style faction skirmish to grab/expand territory. Even the way the waves of mobs attack is great for this.
---
I got a bunch of those a while back for like a week or two (I was still a noob). I seriously thought that's just the game giving you clues.
---
There are 5
---
The oil, lead, and junk isn't too bad either.
---
Really? Then the one spawning, in the radiated Woods South of Watoga when a nuke is dropped, is a bug?
---
Nah
---
Power Armor is for early game until you get real gear.
---
BOS build will never be viable sorry
---
No. That one is meant to be there and will still be there. But the actual boss fight that you can trigger an event for has been pushed back
---
I used to have a room filled with 110 Mr. Pebbles plushies. I had to delete them though, since it used up a huge chunk of my budget
---
I recently got into it and I am really enjoying it so far. Since the Wastelanders Update the recent reviews on steam are quite positive (I am on PC), but I am a bit worried about the endgame as it is very grindy. The leveling system is comparable to Fallout 4 but instead of putting a point into a perk you want, you level up one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats and get perk cards. So you get a card with every point you spent and you can equip them to your build. Sometimes you get "Booster Packs" with a random set of cards and you upgrade perks when you have duplicates. If you liked the building system in Fallout 4, you will have a lot of fun I think since the game is a lot about building your own C.A.M.P that you can place anywhere in the world and you can visit other players can and set up your own shop where other players can buy some of your stuff and vice versa.
---
Unfortunately those quests are good for earning treasury notes and scrip.

After I was done with the main storyline I basicly became I war photographer. Now that my girlfriend started playing, I follow her around her quests and photography everything thats happening. Documenting her progress is actually pretty fun.

Also not sure if youre on xbox, but if you want to save your photo you can press A to remove UI and then save screenshot in xbox system. You can then  download the photo off the xbox app.

Nicee always good to hear another pleasant experience from the 76 community. Welcome back! (Ps4 here)

Okay, but in honesty, this is a real thing that is super cool. Rather than light refraction via layers of rain droplets, severe concentrations of ionizing radiation throws all kinds of great colors through Cherenkov radiation as well as potential localized auroras. Which makes you wonder what source of energy Seymour Skinner had in his kitchen...
---
That’s 6 of us!!!

"Just Bleat It"
---
Photo Opportunity starts when you approach the Overseer's Home while having a working ProSnap Deluxe camera (and possibly some film for it) in your inventory.
---
Optimal rep gains are to get the stolen goods back and donate the reward to Foundation with Ward's daily, decline/donate the rewards for handing in the photos to the opposite faction during Photo Opportunity, decline the reward with Wren's Importance of Communication, and kill the raider and answer "Appalachia has a new corpse" for Rocksy's Retirement Plan. I'm not sure if you can get extra Foundation rep by sending the raider to Foundation first and then killing him anyway.
---
Letting the raider keep the item during Vital Equipment does not result in a net reputation gain, as far as I know.
---
not as bad as the time i had her wandering the roads over by westek. i still have no idea how she got there.
---
Well if ammo was gone you'd be just as alive as before, but even moreso because you would never run out of ammo.
---
It has it's problems, but to be honest unless it is something that just requires a reload you won't notice it for a very long time. I'm approaching 800 hours of playtime, and sometimes certain bugs infuriate me but they aren't stuff that you'll face until end-game and hopefully by then it will be fixed. That being said, there are some bugs that are still present that were in the game over a year ago, and some that people say were even present in beta. To a degree, be prepared to *worst case* feel that you are playing a near-completed beta test. Considering that is as bad as it gets, still worth a few dollars on sale! I'm not trashing the game, I'm just being completely honest on what the game *can* be like at it's worst - and I'm not going to stop playing any time soon! Just want you to know what you're getting into. **But as I said** you very likely won't encounter anything like that for many many hours!
---
In previous Fallout games, I played as a stealth sniper build. When I heard FO76 was going to have real-time VATS, I made a melee character on FO4. I started with 1h, moved to 2h, and recently switched over to Unarmed after getting a good Power Fist. It is by far my favourite. All melee is viable, and tbh Unarmed has a few added benefits that put it above 1h and 2h (but all of them are enjoyable).
---
And if flies had machine guns, frogs wouldn't fuck with them.
---
There are only 5 or 6 events that have a 0.01% chance of dropping the mask.
---
I did those events straight for 6 months before I got lucky and had both masks drop in the same event.
---
So are the cards you get completely random or do you unlock stuff in a certain order? Random progression kind of worries me.
---
(my ban was finally lifted shortly after this post)
---
I see. Thanks.
---
Honestly, one of the best ideas I've seen here. This would add so much depth from a lore perspective, and they could even implement faction buffs to legendary effects so we'd see more viability beyond Bloodied and Junkies. Maybe the Mothman faction could get double the buff from Nocturnal pieces at night, or receive no debuff during the day? Settlers could receive a +60% buff from Troubleshooter's as opposed to the usual +30%, or the same thing for the Responders faction with Zealot's pieces. Assassin's could give you +15% or +20% instead of the current 10% when part of the Raider's faction. This would also help with events or raids they add later, since it would be less about commando/rifleman/heavy gunner builds and more about the faction to maximize effectiveness depending on the type of content you're playing.
---
Quite the lost oppurrtunity
---
Nuka world jingle..
---
..if only. :(
---
Glad it worked for you, just a little heads up - sometimes patches 'regenerate' the ini files (and we get one today), so if you experience it again check the file. To set it read only can cause other problems, would not recommend that. 
---
If you want to go for further improvements here is a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gfsrwd/pc_i_wrote_a_big_guide_for_performancevisualaudio/) I bookmarked a while ago in case I have trouble, had no need to change anything besides iPresentInterval myself though (bit better specs than you)
---
I am fucking depressed about this, farming my atoms and waiting for the next sale was one of the main reasons I played.
---
I had something like this a few weeks ago. I went to the Rusty Pick and was debating which item to buy with scrips when I heard the sound of Power armor stomping around behind me. Then there was a huge burst of gunfire that I could hear hitting the floor/walls near my character, which made me think "great, some idiot trying to PvP".  I ignored him and kept my focus on the transaction.
---
When I bought my item and backed away, I noticed a bag on the floor that wasn't there when I first zoned in - it was stuffed \*full\* of plans and ammo. Looting all of it overencumbered me by like... 60 lbs, IIRC. I was floored - there were a ton of plans I didn't have, and heaps of ammo for several weapons that I use regularly. 
---
It made me feel bad for ignoring the commotion while I was debating which item to buy, because I would love to know who that awesome person was.
---
Maybe he’s stealing it himself, selling it on the lucrative bonesaw black market, before sending off some well meaning vault dweller to recover it, just so he can sell it again. He’s probably making a tidy profit. 
---
When he says damned raider stole it, he’s just talking about himself in the third person. 
---
Alternatively, it’s a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde situation. By day he is an ex-raider, working to keep foundation safe, but by night he reverts to being a raider, robbing them and selling off their stuff. He then wakes up with no memory of it, just clear signs of a break in.
---
If you want to push your damage then you have 2 options:
---
High health option: Junkies build, 5 addictions and add 3\* Bloody Mess
---
Low health option: Bloodied build, Adrenal Reaction mutation, 3\* Bloody Mess, 3\* Nerd Rage
---
For both, drop the 2\* Sniper in favour of 3\* Tank Killer.
---
Also for both, get 2\* Mr. Sandman for more night time damage and 1\* Escape Artist to ensure you won't be detected.
---
I run a bloodied and my automatic Bloodied Handmade deals 301 per bullet and I can push my Bloodied Gauss Pistol to 1000+ -- as you can see the damage difference is quite substantial. SB's and Sheeps drop in a matter of seconds.
---
Haven't run a Junkies so I don't have personal experience with it.
---
Or you can play the game  any way you want :-)
---
You pick them
---
I'll probably be corrected all over the place but I really don't think they were hacking.
---
Sentinel + Assassin's armor (or cavalier + assassin's) is probably what they are wearing, to stop you killing them.
---
I don't PvP but I do run bloodied. I got a shitty little bloodied 10mm and I love it. Wanna know why? I get 680 damage per bullet. Per bullet... (And the ammo is dirt cheap.... 😂) And that's low I'm guessing for bloodied builds I don't be using chems and it's certainly no god roll, heck I don't even have it primed. I do sneak just to clarify so that's not base.
---
Not to mention using serendipity to avoid hits, perhaps even suppressor(perk card not legendary effect) to lower your damage 🤷. Who knows?
---
I've always wondered what happens when two or more bloodied pvpers run into each other and they're both fully kitted, do you think they sit on opposite sides of the road and just shoot each other till the armor breaks and they run out of ammo?
---
More tattoos and piercings etc. would be nice. Also, the player model looks horrible, not saying it should be modder level, but come on..
---
Not interested in grinds for stupid shit. Give me atoms back anyday. Also, I'm interested in fixes more than anything atm.
---
Well if they would take the damn osmosis kit from me maybe they wouldn't be missing it every 4 hours.
---
Uhm the survey area when at each lookout tower places the grey areas on the map. It discovers all undiscovered fast travel points in the area but are grey because you have not been there thus cannot fast travel there.
---
I do not believe what you are describing is so much a bug but an intended feature of the "Survey area" button when looking out ontop lookout towers. Like the tower around camp adams where campfire tales event occurs.
---
ow mybad, then its personal prefference I guess, on my heavy char the explosive flamer is my main gun, I have a sh\*tload of heavy guns so I play a variaty of weapons, but the flamer the most
---
I want to get rid of my excess ballistic ammo which I don't want to drop because I have thousands of rounds collected (and they don't really weigh anything because of 2\* Bandolier).
---
Just glad to get rid of them in a useful way.
---
When crafting/camp building, items (category junk) are used from your inventory first, than stashbox, than scrapbox. If something will be scrapped during the process you see it in the crafting screen. No issues so far with items in/on displays (at least for me).
---
Yes, it should pull from the scrapbox first, hope it gets fixed. Workaround for now - if you craft, get enough scrapped materials out of the scrapbox in your inventory first.
---
but explosive bait only explodes when a mob is nearby right?
---
0 because some hacker instakills her.
---
Not random. You choose out of a batch each time.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/perk-matrix/
---
These are two different Things. It’s two steps. You first choose which Stat you are giving +1 (let’s say perception for example) and after that you can choose 
---
 a card. You can switch the category for the card so you can get a perk belonging to strength, too.
---
For starters that part is a bit confusing sometimes, but choosing the card does not increase the level of the SPECIAL stat. It just gives you the card to equip it (if you fit the requirements).
---
The only truly rare outfits at this moment to my knowledge are:
---
Leather coat
---
Traveling leather coat
---
Tattered field jacket
---
Longshoreman outfit
---
Hunter's long coat
---
Asylum worker uniform Forest
---
Asylum worker uniform Red
---
And I'm a bit out of the loop regarding to outfits, so some of these might not be rare anymore and there might be some I don't know about.
---
Does it persist upon entering another world?
---
Imagine how bad this must be on consoles where it prob takes 2+ minutes for them to load in, if not longer LOL. Usually takes me about 20-30s on average to load a world. I build  my camp near the Wayfarer so... yeah.. I often have to hop quite a bit. Its so frigging hard to find any decently flat ground at low level to build on, which kinda explains why many camps are elevated by a flight of stairs
---
It may be the daily quest 'Cop a squatter' from Watoga, if it happened in the Cranberry Bog. It will trigger whenever you are near the Bog and send you to spots to clear enemies, if you - as you said - server hopped, it will be a different spot every time. Now if you did not discover them before... you got some new (grey) location markers.
---
Xbox friend systems were down today
---
yes, its persist.
---
Cool. Thanks.
---
no!!

if i had to log in and find my stable flux gone i would throw my xbox out the window.

---
it Bethesda so I'd honestly be shocked if it worked as advertised the first go.
---
You dont need legendaries at low levels anyway, any modded baseball bat gonna work for melee, or some rifles-shotguns for ranged
---
Oh Oh! but later on you can spend 150 atoms to pass a node! So you know they going to put in stuff people can't stand just to suck money out of people. Which plays along nicely with the nerf to free atoms. I see what they did there.
---
Sadly the daily stuff wasn't well thought out. Say the settlers need to secure communication towers throughout the map, allowing them secure comms and coverage. Or raiders pinned down a caravan and need folks to get there to aid them, upon getting there it could be drawn from a list of encounters. Such as they were taken as prisoners already so you can talk the raiders out of it, buy their freedom etc. You get there and mothman swoops in killing the raiders, before taking off. Now you have to deal with a settler who starts sounding like a cultist, that its a sign. Do you talk them out of it, push them to join the cult (secret cult rep) etc. 
---
Arrive to late, deathclaws got the group, but a beacon for the supplies is active. Do you hunt it down, tracking it via radio? Lie and say it was all gone? Realize the beacon is hunting you etc.
---
Quite rare, just got it recently after \~270 levels. I did not search for Grahm actively, just checked his inventory whenever we met, though.
---
The answer to 3 is in the lore.  It's people meat
---
Thats what they want you to do.
---
I just choose the paper. No funny biz necessary.
---
Actually, I'm not so sure. Last time I saw someone doing it I was the only person around and it worked.
---
Know what would help teaming a ton? Frigging text chat, I mean seriously, even the first ever online games had text chat, even the ones on consoles, there is 0 excuse as to why fo76 still does not have this feature. Even with the voice chat which is increadbly glitchy and doesn't work half the time, Talking to people has never really gotten me anywhere, as they either do not hear, or just have voice chat muted.
---
On pc there used to be a damage parser program you could run in another window that showed damage from everyone in render distance, Meter76. When Bethesda updated power armor frames it broke the meter because then the damage source became the PA frame and not the player.
---
I loved that addon, my discord group would regularly test out different builds and everyone had their favorite weapon to try to top the meter with, and if someone didn't get loot, you could tell them that they only did 300 dmg over the past 10 minutes and help improve their build.
---
I've offered to pay the mod maker to update the mod but he has long ago quit fallout.
---
fr why do they even put us on servers with no camp space??
---
I have no other possibility to wallpaper a wooden wall with windows.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/uCKiQB4](https://imgur.com/a/uCKiQB4) 
---
Its in german, but you can see that there isnt the option for "wallpaper"
---
I would give anything to have a different daily quest for Foundation. Crater isn't too bad because you have two on rotation for a bit of variation. At Foundation every single day it's the same quest and we don't even have dialogue to convince the their to surrender the equipment. Go here, kill this man. That's it. 
---
Please Bethesda. Please give us another daily quest.
---
Good you’re not a flake
---
I would rather see imba stuff get nerfed instead of PA getting buffed.
---
You're level 112 and don't have enough mats to repair your camp? Are you repairing individually? Or going to your C.A.M.P. and hitting repair all? The latter uses hardly any mats.
---
Would also be good for an unofficial auction too
---
Does it affect any other build option?
---
no, only the windowed wooden wall.
---
this is the only possibility for me to paper a windowed wooden wall
---
It should be a server to server check since your data and the world are both being loaded by the client.
---
Oh oh oh ozempic..
---
I cant dance
---
Don't do it
---
I'm not sure which location you mean. Maybe the map from Senyra will help
---
[wastelanders locations](https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eqdki1/wastelanders_location_map_16_locations_we_know_so/)
---
1. Did Lesile have a PipBoy somehow, so Chloe can show the destination on it (Daily: Play Time)?
---
2. How do the Monorail system work on one linear rail without sidetracks to let cars pass each other?
---
3. How would a 3-long Monorail car (in Watoga) fit onto the 2-long Monorail Elevator?
---
4. Why would be two Monorail stations in Watoga? There aren't any residential homes anywhere else along the track thus students could just walk from the Watoga Residential over to the high school.
---
5. How do Locomotives fit under posts, railings, tunnels and bridges?
---
6. How can Daguerre have caps to pay us for our initial ally quests if she has just landed after decades?
---
7. Who do you pay the fast travel costs to?
---
8. How would the crashed airplanes with large wingspan fit onto any of the airfields?
---
9. Where was the tunnel near the Treetops supposed to lead?
---
10. Why can't I sprint longer in PA? Consequently, why can't I sprint in PA while overencumbered given that it is powered by a Fusion Core so it shouldn't depend on my strength?!
---
11. Weight reduction perks: where does the excess weight go?
---
12. Are the Crashed Space Station (Crater) related to Daguerre or was she on a different space station?
---
So that's not really how it went down. I got lucky when the croc plans dropped for me twice. At first I wasn't sure of their value so I watched the market; what I saw was a rapid climb from being roughly equivalent to other rare plans to them being the most sought after plan from the event. I timed the market and made my move, selling the first one early for the circus traincar plan and the marine armored helmet plan. The next one I timed better and got the QFFR+P tesla. I saw people ger greedy and ask too much because one time a guy got a crazy deal, but I also saw people sell it for peanuts because they didn't know or care about its value. The only people who couldn't sell it were asking too much.
---
And also ALL characters in this game have the same HEIGHT. Why is that? Why cant we have short characters, tall characters etc?
---
Check in your quest tab if you still have the quest 'Fun and Games' open, it is the next step after helping 'Cheating Death' (the ghoul in the cave).
---
The point of no return is reached once you have the two quests Side with the Settlers/Side with the Raiders. You will get a confirmation requester when you pick your side.
---
Baaaa humbuger
---
Got ants in your pants?
---
However, we compensate for the missing bodily power supply by plugging in fusion cells... somewhere.
---
Both factions have three "prep" quests before the point of no return. Once you finish helping the army dude at robco do the other two raider quests before making your final choice. 
---
You can also still do daily quests and earn rep/ranks with both factions after the wastelander main quest is done. You will eventually have access to all gear from both faction regardless of who you choose to help break into the vault. Your choice pretty much just slightly changes how the heist goes down and gives you a head start in ranking one faction. Unless you choose the gold. Which you should.
---
 Thanks.  I didn't want to miss out on being able to run missions to get gold to buy stuff
---
Then we dont need legendaries at all. Regular Baseball Bat works fine at level 100 too.
---
I was having the same problem but once I switched servers he talked to me. Now I know you said that you switched servers but are you sure that you actually switched servers and not just relogged back into the one you were in before? I'm only asking because when I left the world (that I first encountered ward not talking to me) and then pressed the option to join a new world it actually just put me back in my old one (I know because it all the same people). So what I had to do was go in to a private world, leave, and then go into a public world. Now it's working for me and I'm in a new world. Oh and in case it still doesn't work for you check what time it is (under the data tab in your pipboy). For me it was almost 5:30am and Ward was still in bed. I hope knowing all of this can help somebody having the same problem.
---
I didn't know that.  Thanks.  I thought that once you choose one faction you can no longer run quests for the other.
---
Would be nice to have more realistic hunger, thirst and spoilage that follows in game time.
---
I say again.... [**IGUANA MEAT IS PEOPLE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs-gocza6t8)
---
I'd go with Blue Ridge
---
One says three and the other says five. Hell, I'll say there are a *dozen*!
---
And why choose the gold?
---
I have a character that rocks a B FFR .38 ... so much fun
---
This is amazing lol. I always add that picture to my camp, love it.
---
Nope only 5
---
- Stalking
---
- Vengeful
---
- Wise 
---
- Glowing

- Scorched

Yeah, sure... but *diseased lasers* tho
---
[**IT'S PEOPLE!!!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs-gocza6t8)
---
A game can in theory know this before you loaded the actual world. As soon as a server is found for the player, it can request all current camps and their data and simply compare it to the players last known camp location and then show a dialog "search new server" "join anyway". 
---
All that could be done in just 1 or 2 seconds.
---
Can you get a bit more in-depth? I'm open to any negative or positive opinion on the game to temper my expectations but "Don't do it" isn't really enough to go off of.
---
Hey so uh... You got your wish at Rank 5 for Update 20.
---
doh.  Scrapped responder fireman x 2 and a leather travelers coat last week
---
Yeah well all bugs and glitches Bugthesda has not even tried to fix since day 1 , sad that people still defend them. Big reason that they never will be fixed . Stupid people accepting bug after bug ...
---
And i also learned NOT to start arguing with a Fanboy
---
did they shoot the bait?
---
You split a thousand bullion with the faction of your choice or keep it all for yourself. You have a daily earn limit of 200. Two and a half days worth of extra gold is worth a very minor hit in rep that is easily regained.
---
Not really. If you keep few weapons + ammo, some things for display cases and shop inventory you're struggling anyway. But I agree scrap box should be base feature. Maybe ammo box too.
---
\#4: Beckett is, imo, the best as not only does he have a bar, but also has some of the best lines for an ally when they randomly chatter. If you haven't heard his "weatherman" line in a rad storm, jebus I had to stop crafting cause I was laughing so hard. He's got a good storyline too, very well written.  Possible downside = like Gage, you'll be forever known as boss.
---
Daguerre's quests are of a different flavor, still fetch/kill quests. But many, myself included, found her idle chatter on the annoying side. The geeking out is cute, but the rest, eh, you'll just have to take a listen for a bit to decide for yourself.
---
Gramps is ok, some toilet humor and we never get to hear about his books, or his real name, or anything like that so I just couldn't get invested. 
---
Wanderer is nice, kinda southern sweetheart type but she does play the guitar A LOT, and I get the skin crawls with some repetitive music chords and sounds (I was stoked for playable instruments at first, now I avoid them). The same feeling with trypophobia, if that's any explanation? Otherwise she's nice for the idle chatter.
---
Punk is... paranoia in a tin can. Cryptid quests are always welcome but his idle chatter is like chewing on aluminum foil for me and I haven't pulled him back out, worse when he's someone else's ally. But some find his dialogue fun, which is all that matters. 
---
I just suggest running the two ally's quests and trying all of them out for yourself for at least three days, and look at how you can incorporate them into your camp if you enjoy putting time into your camp build. Good thing is you can always alternate allies! But, they will all have dirty  skin textures, no getting around that until a mod comes out with an alternate texture (EVB doesn't offer clean skin textures for allies as far as I can tell) so we're all SOL when switching out their outfits at the moment.
---
 Ok.  Makes sense.  Is there a total cap on gold? 
---
And there's only a thousand bullion? I thought it was all of America's gold?  Lol
---
If i had to choose i would prefer not to be loved by Todd ;) Thank you very much
---
You monster.
---
Even with Wastelanders, this game is still Fallout 76.
---
The core of the game hasn't changed.
---
After 300 hours I can confirm it is utter garbage. I only played it for the lore and nothing else.
---
Check out this review: https://youtu.be/RwQbSdwNQRU
---
Not trying to make fun, but I am genuinely curious why you bought the Gauss Pistol plan if you don't use pistols? I have heard that it is a glorified nail-gun anyway.
---
You can only hold 5,000 at a time. You only get 1,000, yeah. You'll see what's up when you do the quest. Spoilers and all that.
---
you can drop it in a suitcase at a train station, switch characters and pray it's still there
---
Yes. I pick a suitcase. Put my items in it and then log off and switch characters. Log back in and have him pick up the dropped items. Just make sure you use a private world each time and don’t accidentally log into a public one. I think that loses your link to your private world. You only keep your world for about 5 to 10 minutes so be kinda quick.
---

---
Forgive us for working a 12 hour job and raising a 6 month old daughter that we don't have the time to read everything about the game and most youtubers that I watch never really mentioned anything on this unless I missed it.
---
You can. But it isn't 100% safe, and it isn't an intended purpose. If you lose items, you only have yourself to blame - so only transfer what you are willing to lose.
---
The random one is already in the game.
---
The event one ,as stated by devs pts schedule,probably won't come before august.
---
Interesting idea for sure... does the Iron Fist perk actually work in PA? Only +20% damage unfortunatley. If I remember right, Pain train is not that great and the whole concept would need some specific PA mods and lots of AP
---
I’ll have to double check that
---
yeah, it went up quickly, then it tapered down and now it's not nearly as expensive as it used to be, the demand isn't high.
---
that dude obviously doesn't know the worth then, i saw people selling them for less than 20 k and they couldn't even get buyers. it's like offering a legacy for one, sure you *can*, but that doesn't mean it's worth that much.
---
Well, because I wanted to test if it was viable back then. It was not and that was the end of my gunslinger career :-)
---
Damage wise it \_could\_ be viable, since you can silence it and it deals a ton of damage. 
---
Too bad it breaks down immediately even with Gunsmith and suffers from the same VATS wonkines like the Gauss rifle does.
---
Hey, going to Wavy Willard's is fine by me! It's easy to get in and get out.
---
Alot of enemies getting 2-3 times bulky after lvl 40 or so, before that you can 1-2 shoot most of them. Huge spike in health i mean
---
Hey,   
---
You can do that but it´s not a 100% secure. More like 90% secure.   
---
I´ve done it multiple times and two times i lost everything i was transferring due to the server crashing.   
---
There is a 5 to 10 min rule about the servers, if you find a container at let´s say a train station, put everything in there you want to transfer, log out and log in you will be in the same private world as long as you logged in within 5-10 min after logging out.   
---
It´s handy when a friend is not online, but comes with a risk.    
---
You could also look up the couriers of fallout 76 here on reddit or facebook and ask them to come to safely transfer any items between toons. They work on Tip bases, so any spare ammo, mats, caps or aid items you would want to have for the services are appreciated. I use them when trading big value guns. Always no problem.
---
I believe with a full I unyielding set of armour you would do way more damage than a full spec'd power armour build
---
It hurts itself in confusion*
---
Make it sharp and call it lamb chop
---
Yeah man, nobody knows what it's worth but you. We're all just stumbling blindly into high end trades...
---
They claimed to have fixed vats with all charging weapons. My lvl 18 character's bow would beg to differ. If they fix VATS, bows, gauss weapons (besides the minigun, which is a beast), and any other charging weapons will become usable again.
---
Yeah this is a problem for everyone i believe. And this solves it.  Although sometimes when i log back in the wallpaper has diapered again.
---
They did as the event was live.
---
I just hope those plans find another way into the game again without such an „event“
---
I was so disappointed when I found the various vaults around the map and couldn't enter them to explore and find out what horrible things Vault Tech did to the other vaults. 
---
As far as my vault dweller knows, Vault Tech is awesome and did just what they always said they would with a few minor social experiments here and there.  I want them to grow to hate Vault Tech like all my other dwellers have in the past games.
---
Give us lore and story Bethesda! 
---
Please give 76 more lore and story. It would benefit so much.
---
So basically, my "I want to be a freight train" build will not work.... I suspected as much. Ooohhh well (pulls out bloodied plasma caster).
---
Thank you, I thought I was just too stupid.
---
Noone come close to mr.Fluffy (early responders quest, he staying near dead responder). He's even better than Insult bot in terms of roasting
---
move ur camp device around, then fast travel to ur own camp
---
It would be enough if it would load the coordinates of all camps and compare it to yours. This would be just a fraction if the amount if data a website loads.

"Hey Miguel, you hear something? No, it's probably because you're dead."
---
It's not known for real untill the oatch but it was made clear daily and weekly challenges are the best source for season lvl up. So if those change daily, and are inteded for daily playing,you'll probably fall short indeed.
---
That unless undone challenges pile up,but i seriously doubt it.
---
Doing events and getting xp will still be a way to lvl up season when you have time,but we still don't know how much these two ultra common and easy methods net you,compared to doing challenges. It could be the same or 1/50 who knows.
---
Thank you!
---
You can tag junk items and junk components for search, so it gets easier to collect specific things.
---
Soon™
---
Explosive vents have been broken since day one so no jumping and smashing things.  If you don't mind hitting someone one 10 times for a kill it will work.  Sad thing is the power armor makes you do less damage.  A bloodied build will let you one hit anything even armed with a wet noodle.  Maybe bloodied unarmed pa build.  I enjoy marsupial + 2 handed axe build for a long time, once I went bloodied I never looked back damage is so good and emergency protocol in pa makes it near immortal (till poison gets you or rads)
---
I mean, it already has. Initially we had 400 stash space, it was horrendous then.
---
smart
---
It's not fixed and even if I quickly tap the fire button the gauss pistol fires all over the place thus degrading the weapon even faster than it should because it keeps missing shots it shouldn't
---
Hey did you know the patch is happening today?
---
I have a really cool glitch going where I don't actually have to go fetch the macguffin. When ever I show up to foundation and the daily mission comes up all I have to do is go talk to ward and he goes into his "I see you've recovered our missing blah blah blah" dialouge and then the mission completes and I get the reward and reputation increase.
---
I have no idea how it happened though.
---
Why. Daily quests can be done again tomorrow
---
Yea but there still is a risk of losing items.
---
Better store less items to transfer instead of trying to transfer all of them at once.
---
As others have said yes but never try moving too much valuable stuff at once. Under most circumstances you can keep rejoining the same server, even if the game crashes. There are occasionally server crashes and if that happens anything that was on there becomes a sacrifice to Todd.
---
I had her spawn in the western lookout post and once in between Crater und the post fighting some Yao-Guais. Good she\`s not a flake
---
I guess we see a return of the Halloween event as Fasnacht and Meat Week did.
---
Not sure the lost rep if you keep all gold for yourself can be regained in 2.5 days, but I guess someone already did the math (maybe search the sub). In the end it isn't a big deal anyway - you will need to 'grind' rep and gold for quite some weeks to get the better plans, it's more a matter of personal choice imho.
---
Alright awesome. Its 5 A.M. for me so I'll be on in a few hours lol.
---
No witch hunting
---
I find the rocksy quests more annoying and she actually looks like Preston Garvey
---
Maybe lagest Boner he Saw
---
If you got to 300 hours youve gotten your moneys worth 10 times over, at that point the game becoming a repetitive grind is not a problem even worth considering as you can move on to another game.
---
I have never played a game for that many hours and NOT found repetitive uninteresting gameplay loops and bugs. Thats like sitting at an all you can eat buffet for 6 hours eating without pause then complaining you threw up. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
because then it'll competitive and everyone wants to flex and say 'ow look at me i used my firelaz0r weapon and did 10K dmg' and then nobody else can enjoy the loot 
---
but fuck it why not
---
If you had a mutant slayer's AGL, full Demo Expert/Adrenaline/Tenderizer/Stabilized/One Gun Army, then you could probably do it in one or two. These are the same cards that I use for my explosive miniguns on this character. I have a GS AGL and it wrecks at Radiation Rumble (add full Glow Sight to that). I don't use solely launchers on that character. I'm not trying to convince you to switch your build (why would I?), I'm just saying that I'm able to make it work and I find it fun.
---
Maybe that’s the reason why the challenges getting replaced by seasons.
---
They just can’t fix the auto complete bug so the remove it.
---
I have a TS MIRV Launcher and it's very fun to use lol
---
I think my method was more efficient and fast. I made a blueprint full of only those items.
---
Went workshop to workshop puttimg down 2 or 3 blueprints for 200,300 each time in like 30 seconds. I did all those challenges in a single sunday.
---
Just go to already nuked zones every 20minutes and kill the respawned enemies for stable flux materials. Equip ammosmith and super duper perk to make ultracite .308 ammo. So every 3 violet flux is like 600 bullets. 172 ammo per flux plus the 30% dupe chance. And prime receiver does more dmg so less ammo usage.
---
And one more for you!!
---
LMAO ? don't care dude, learn education. This player is cancer. Point.
---
Yeah. I said they claimed to have fixed it, but you are right. It is certainly not fixed.
---
I only played it to see what truly made it this bad. If I was not a Fallout fan, you can bet your ass I wouldn't have touched this. But Bethesda fanboys can't be argued with. If I would have said I only played the game for 30 hours, you would have said that's not enough.
---
This should be a sticky
---
Yeah they need to be nerfed just a bit
---
Before starting the game the two features that sparked zero interest for me were camp building ( I could never be bothered with settlements) and photo mode. It turns out those are probably my 2 favourite features. I love going on a mission to find the perfect outfits and settings. Plus the one glitch I hope never gets fixed, where enemies freeze in place, has provided a lot of fun photos.
---
I've now got this blueprinted and down to a science and I'm just dropping it off in random workshops hoping people will find it. Or fight for it. Or both!
---
Only the setup quests, which will just make you have to grind longer for rep, but you'll be grinding for gold for months anyways no big deal to do the daily over an over at same time (as they give gold).  Your choice doesn't matter at all as you just have to grind longer for gold or rep but you'll be doing it anyways for more gold.
---
Yeah I noticed they still said the collect bubblegum one is still in... not Exactly one I enjoy tbh.
---
'Straya represent! Overnight patch downloads for us ;)
---
Are you at nerd rage treshold with rads? And do you have the healing factor mutation?
---
Haha A scorchedbored
---
[Oh. I see.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/992/401/e37.png)
---
So youre saying you lied about the time played? 
---
Bethesda fanboys arent unreasonable, most of them know this game has glaring issues. The only seemingly unreasonable and pita people are the ones that, years later still hang around spinning fallacies and accusing anyone who questions them of being some mindless drone while acting out exactly that behaviour.
---
So lets start over, as youve just stated you werent speaking the truth, how long have you played, what issues did you experience, why shouldnt he give the game a go?
---
I have played this game for 357 hours since the beta, I just checked.
---
Yeah actually better leave the old boy on rest mode. Thanks for reminding me!
---
first sign of nukashine addiction is denial
---
Do you play on xbox becouse I had went to the rusty pick and saw a person there I had opened a bunch of presents and needed to get rid of weight in my stash and found that it was mostly ammo taking up room, I ended up dropping it all but didn't want it to go to waste so I shot at the guy to get his attention but it didn't work so to conserve ammo I just say forget it and left.
---
so we'll be able to eat spoiled veggies and meat without getting cancer?
---
Bleat it! Baaaahhh.
---
all junkies need help
---
Maybe you should send a package of gunpowder to Bethesda with the note "weigh this".
---
Or then again, maybe not. Would be a shame to go to court for attempted terrorism charges just to make a point.
---
I named mine "BAA*RAM*EWE" Ode to the movie Babe.
---
Okay, so assuming you played the game from dawn till dusk you spent a month and a half worth of playing nonstop.
---
Thats a LOT of time. And you say there was absolutely no redeemable features to it. That.. Is quite a statement and a hell of a commitment to acclaimed nothingness.
---
So its safe to assume, youre either mentally ill or still talking hot air. Please provide him with your reasonings for it being as bad as you claim.
---
I think it's a popular sentiment with the community that we should be able to get to Rank 100 just by "doing the things we normally do" as Bethesda has stated a number of times pitching Seasons.
---
I get that there will be stuff like NW and group challenges but if it's impossible to get to Rank 100 without these, Bethesda can go f right off.
---
So does that mean that placing your vendors high up in your camp is a viable way to avoid it?
---
been hateful to her since wastelanders,
---
making me travel all over appalachia to find shitty holotapes cuz she too soft
---
Sixteen times the annoyance.
---
Just a hint.. It takes couple seconds to type  **10:00 a.m. ET** to google
---
Wastelanders is decent. But the rest of the game is still Fallout 76.
---
For what it’s worth (And for those reading this that are considering setting up nuke accounts), I haven’t had a single issue moving items between accounts using a private server.
---
Luckily we put trackers in our worthless trash.
---
I watched the review in full and I can now say that while I am increasingly wary of the game, I actually do still want it for the sake of trying it, although now I'm probably just going to wait even longer before making a move on it since the monetisation of the game seems a bit horrendous. I'm no stranger to bugs, even ones that are as game breaking as shown in the video though, and that part won't really bother me.
---
So.. You really have nothing to add.. At all..
---
Its the same with me and cop a squatter. Sometimes it'll just complete and I have no idea why, also if you have a camp near whitesprings Station you can trigger the uranium fever event and basically not do it. I have since moved as so many server hops are needed because so many people makes camps there.
---
Just throwing my 2 cents in... i see everyone mention bloodied or junkies. Although these 2 types do massive dmg, its not the only options.  You just need to find good synergy with your weapons n perk cards. Of which u just need some good legendary weapons.  Im neither bloodied or junkies... im full health,  n use shotguns. I can easily one shot majority of all enemies. Bigger enemies 2-3 at most. All scorchbeasts outside of the queen, i kill quickly when landed. Sheepsquatch even dies rather quickly,  including the 3* ones I've killed. Just wanted to reassure you bloodied n junkies aren't your only options if your not looking to run either of those
---
That would be really good, espcially if it changed the amount of rep you got
---
Bugs, broken AI, boring quests, a subscription for something that should have already been in the game for free, outrageous prices on the ToddShop, duping, hacking, an incredibly long grind and much much more.
---
I really like the game.. I like building camps. My main negatives concern the artifical daily limits (camp building budget, stash limit, cap limit, scrip limit, bullion limit, daily vendor cap limit etc..)
---
Camp limit I can understand due to server performance. The rest was installed solely to promote eg. the paid subscription service (in case of the stash limit) or to force you to play daily in order to grind ship, bullion, caps. To achieve real progress you need to grind the game at least 1h per day. With family and job.. that is... hard to do.. to put it politely.
---
Bethesda handles the game like a f....ing mobile game, but even worse.. the usual mobile game takes less grind than Fo76.
---
No, not really until you picked up a set of power armor.  Storage became slightly more of an issue at that point.
---
In Fallout 2 you probably have Bozar by that point anyways which is the only weapon you actually need to carry from that point forward.  Really wish they would add that thing to 76.  Gun runners arsenal added it to NV but guns in 3 and NV were really wonky anyways so it wasn't too great.
---
In the end, it's your choice. Have a nice day!

---
Hey there,   
---
I think this game has had many problems. And Bethesda has sometimes had laughable answers to it´s problem. I hope they take everything from their mistakes here and apply it to future games. Sometimes it sounds like they are tone deaf to criticism and unable to admit they are wrong.   
---
Also a part of this community always complains about everything so sometimes it can look like a negative diarrhea around here. But the community is mostly helpful and super nice.   
---
I love fallout 4 (Haven´t played any other games, and yes i intend too), and if you did you will also like this one.   
---
**Here is what i love about this game**  
---
* The map and world space is very interesting and expansive. Personally i believe this game is worth the price tag just to explore the map. (That doesn't mean Bethesda shouldn't fix everything that is broken or bugged, i got my moneys worth just by exploring) 
---
* The Original main story is actually quite good if you get into it. But it´s a bit different and you will have to read a lot of terminals and listen to a lot of holotapes as there aren't any NPC's in that story. But it´s quite an in depth story and a sad one. Take your time to really immerse yourself in it and i think it will be a hit.   
---
* CAMP system, Just like in fallout 4 i have spent probably around 50% of my time building different CAMPS. This is not for everyone but i absolutely love it.  I also like that you need to learn plans to craft items. I've played for 600 hours and i still haven´t unlocked everything and i get super happy when i find a plan i haven´t learned. 
---
* Community, this is probably one of the best things about this game. I have run into so many people who i can now call Friends. Even three in real life. There are a lot of Discord communities or  player "factions". All of them focus on different things. Some are PVP based, others about role playing, some about guilds and some have a little bit of everything.   
---
Now i could start writing about the bugs or the not so good trading system or the broken pvp or unnecessary cap limit. But there are hundreds of post about that posted daily.   
---
IF you love fallout 4 you will love this game.
---
2/3 of those are entirely non issues, two are blatant fallacies and one is an extraordinarily poor description which barely passes as an opinion.
---
Again, considering the hours you commited to this game, if it is as bad as you describe, what on earth compelled you to waste 357 hours on it?
---
Ward seems to be the Appalachian version of Preston Garvey.
---
Have had no issues with vending my side.
---
Yeah if I recall correctly he got it down to a few seconds for a full refresh, so you can stack it pretty much indefinitely. I think that was with full AP refresh gear though, plus perks.
---
Well worth watching the vid.
---
Or destroy other potential Sunnys before the settlers find them
---
Looks like the inside of a cooling tower. I think you have to kill 3 raiders who live there if I remember. Cant remember which quest it is though.
---
Yeah. I was a part of the original PTS and it was pretty disappointing to have reported bugs months ahead only to see people complaining about the same bugs after the DLC launched on here.
---
And then got to see salty reddit posts saying that anyone who participated in the PTS should have their accounts banned from the game for allowing this buggy update through, which was pretty damn funny actually.  Being part of the PTS somehow meant we were supoosed to fix their code and push back the release lol.
---
I like the event idea. I'm sick of people shooting me while I'm stocking my vendor or farming veggies. I get that some people are into PVP but I'm not so quit shaking my screen with your obnoxious teslas (and learn how to aim so you can use a real weapon 🙄).
---
We also need an in-game player initiated bounty system so we can punish griefers. Oh and to prevent exploitation, you cant claim a bounty for killing someone you've been on a team with in the past week. 
---
I get that PVP and griefers are technically 2 different groups but theres been more and more overlap recently.
---
I want a protectron that sings - You Sexy thing by Hot Chocolate, to any and all visitors to my vending machines, while furiously humping them.
---
Nevermind, I just checked your profile, fresh reddit with only two subs, one a post deleted on fo76 trying to bait about the game being garbage and 60 odd posts in Market76 trying to sell and buy the very duped gear you mentioned you hated. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Don’t forget to grab the Chinese stealth suit before you do the raid or you’ll end up spending 4K gold to get it after the raid!
---
Nah.

I'm just interested in the lore
---
13. Rust and microbes living on the surface entering the skin when struck by a robot.
---
Tetanus and anaphylactic shock are the most obvious, but imagine being struck with an assaultron blade or handy buzz ax that's been coated in various forms of gore and viscera for decades without cleaning.
---
It's like dipping a blade in poison.
---
Yes, my changes basically defuse to points which you named 1st how stupid op the tesla is and secondly the griefers. When they do it like I said, making a  Survival Server for open PvP and then making Adventure an all pacifist mode. So it's just like a peaceful lobby to trade, build camps and level up.
---
Here have an updood for being the first to respond and making valid points.
---
Of course.
---
The way you fix pvp is by getting rid of pvp.
---
“Guarantee?”
---
Yeah, that’s where you lost me.
---
Unfortunately, BGS isn’t going to be able to guarantee anything. They are a for-profit business and will go where the money is.
---
Well you're not entirely wrong, it's basically removing adventure mode PvP and reviving Survivalmode with a ton of balance changes.
---
Man I'm not in the mood to argue with you so lets just agree to disagree.
---
My longest streak was a 2 weeks at this point still going though
---
They will go where Zenimax tells them. It's mostly not BGS who makes these decisions, it's Zenimax.
---
Really. You can't be nappy about that.
---
Yes, I know, but BGS is doing the coding.
---
I run bloodied power armor on my main, but I use a BFFR90 plasma caster for most things and BFFR+P Gauss minigun for bosses. Consistently putting up 3k+ damage with the PC and can do close to 200 damage per hit on the queen with my GMG
---
Yes but sadly they have to do what Zenimax tells them.
---
Once I finished respec to bloody, I became an unkillable God. Pop some psychotats and I'm instajibbing scorchbeasts
---
Are you aiming directly at the window when you're trying to apply the wallpaper? If you aim at the wall surrounding the window (to the left, top, right or directly below the window but still aiming at the wall that the window is on) it should work. At least that's what works for me.
---
And that’s why they can’t “guarantee” anything.
---
Yes but Bethesda isn't the subject we speak about, it's just searching ideas to fix the Griefing issue and make pvp fun and optional for everyone.
---
Its not really an argument if youre just self admissed blowing hot air to screw some guy out of a good time.
---
But yes, lets put this to rest. With nothing of any value to add its not really worth mine or anybodys time for that matter reading this drivel.
---
Its part of the Crater chain of missions (if you choose them to break into the vault), where you have to hunt down some raiders for Meg. They have a base inside one of the Poseiden Water towers.
---
10am ET to GMT ect, works perfectly well.
---
And I’m a realist.
---
You may have great ideas, but you’re tilting at windmills.
---
It’s great to play pretend, but the game will be what the company wants it to be.
---
If you want real changes, apply for a job at BGS.

So yeah. I like to play Fallout. Not Inventory Manager, Freemium Scam Grindfest 76.
---
I found her down near foundation once. I was confused as fuck when I went to crater and the marker was miles away. 
---
I travelled and sure enough she was just stood on a road. I thought it was some sort of randomised lore thing, you know, scoping out the competition but nope. Just bugged. Or she’s not a flake and was crossing the name off her list herself.
---
Screw some guy out of a good time? This game is somehow even worse than Fallout 4. Unless you enjoy extremely repetitive boring fetch quests and you're willing to grind your ass off, you won't have a good time playing this abomination.
---
On Friday night she was sitting outside the Wayward!
---
\*Shouting from the sky\*: I LIKE YOUR STYLE KID. NOW SCRAM!
---
I actually did this for a while. Put kinetic shocks or whatever on your legs to reduce AP while sprinting, then put the servo mod on the torso to boost AP regen. Spec into strength, endurance, and agility. Agility for the AP pool, and to run action boy and adrenaline. Endurance to make your AP last longer while sprinting and for a larger HP. Strength for iron-fist and blocker perks, as well as, I think it’s martial artist? One of them makes your unarmed and melee attacks armor piercing or something. The higher your strength the more damage you dish by hitting things. Play around with it, maybe even try radicool and emergency protocols to boost your DR and speed even more. Talons mutation. It’s viable for everything short of a “boss” such as a scorchbeast or mirelurk queen.
---
Nah I'm fine, I'm going to study archeological sience but thx for calling my ideas great, appreciate it.
---
"357 hours"

No Fallout before this had any of those Limits.... Again:

I think I got that from Jen after we went to see her mum.  I'll probs never use it as I wear pa all the time.

I just showed up at the event you were at and killed myself in front of you twice.  Pretty sure someone else in a stealth suit revived me one time and the other time you fast traveled away.  LMAO.
---
I saw that! Just wish I hadn’t already discarded all my useless ammo a month ago...
---
Do you want a fucking screenshot
---
Wow that is seriously nice. I'll be grabbing it if it's that good. I haven't so far as no mods.
---
No, I believe you have that many hours clocked, the hours just prove youre either in desperate need of a psychologist or are talking absolute garbage, thats all 😂
---
Yes you can tame a mirelurk king and no you cannot have more than one pet at your camp. You can have one brahmin fertilizer collector, one human companion, one robot collector, one pet.

Surly they could bring these on line for adventuring without impacting stability.  Just open the door and make them part of the same cell without instancing.  The Raid thing just sucks in this game anyway, so make a PVE quest out of them.
---
Apparently today's patch will address this magic weapon issue, so I concede you are correct, the developers are taking what action they can to solve this problem. 
---
I personally wouldn't take advantage of an exploit that negatively impacts other people in a game, to me it that feels wrong.
---
It's best for me to bow out of launching nukes on the public servers until this issues has been corrected.

Hell, there's plenty of people there, should be like 3 or 4 dailies. Shame there isn't. Would be a lot more interesting and rewarding.

I’ve just found her doing a “Ward” impression except she talks in her sleep it seems as she didn’t even move from the bed
---
I guess. You already get a guaranteed 2* armor from the event, rare plans, pure flux, advanced repair kits plus the random legendary on her body. Personally never saw it as a big deal.
---
I agree with the point of adventure mode being a pacifist mode, with workshops I think there should be a cool down from claiming to someone able to take it, this way it gives time for the player to have the choice of leaving the area or fighting the player, rather than being launched into pvp by some level 462 with a Tesla rifle and fully upgraded x-01 power armour. 
---
In adventure mode I use my stealth armour because I'm a stealth melee character, so I feel as if the stealth armour is fone for pve, but I can see issues with pvp. You could have a radio frequency, like the courser mission in fo4 that gets louder and more frequent the closer you are to someone using stealth armour or stealth boys while both engaged in pvp.
---
Maybe you have one of the most popular sites on the map and that’s the Price you got to pay for it

Ha ha, saw that too. You can't tell me that guy's not hitting the chems and nukashine.

It'll be around 3pm in the UK then so I think they go down at the same time so what's good for one time zone won't be good for others.

4 hours
---
There is few problems with your theory: Mutant slayer is +30% while junkies with 5 adfictions is + 50%(so my gun is actually better than what you suggest) , adrenaline and tenderizer do nothing for first hit (If i take in consoderation cost of 40mm grenade and its wait, it must kill supermutant in one shot for it to be somewhat effective), stabilized works for heavy weapons which agl is not and I'm pretty sure armor pen doesn't affect explo dmg anyways, one gun army is stagger/cripple - no effect to dmg. It's cool you made it work in one specific situation and have fun with it but it is not ground for calling explosive weapons underrated.
---
Yup ... the community is why I will never leave the game.  Take many breaks, but keep coming back.

This would explain why he sleeps all the time. The dual personality bit drains him and the sleep wipes his memory of what his other self has done.
---
It is an *illusion* of choice. Just choose one and run with it, so you can start getting Treasury Notes added to the rewards for events and dailies. Honestly, it doesn't matter in the end.
---
If you are referring to the event, it got delayed. As for the wendigo colossus, he is already in the game.
---
Wow this idea with the radio frequency is cool af, take an updood Buddy.
---
1 the rep hit is honestly minimal, especially in comparison to the benefits of your choice. 
---
2 no permanent locking of anything. Which honestly I get the idea behind but it definitely makes the whole choice and quest kinda meh for me. There are no real ramifications of your choice at all which I think kinda sucks. 
---
3 there is a single daily, and then there is a mission for the overseer/davenport you can turn in to whichever side you wanna gain rep with. There are also random Assault encounters where if you help the settlers/raiders fight whatever is attacking then talk to them they will give you a respective rep gain. The most common I’ve had of these has been in the grove in the bog. Takes seconds to finish usually. 
---
4 I erred on the side of caution and kept from doing the last mission for a while to rep both factions. Then it turned out it matters not a jot as you can do both after the end anyway. 
---
5 I screwed them both and kept all the gold. The rep hit didn’t matter at all and as I said, was minimal. They don’t care and only just mention your decision offhandedly in colour commentary sometimes, but no real downside. 
---
Having the initial 1000 gold was good but other than the 200 a day limit you can earn,  getting bullion is no real issue so it’s all personal choice I guess especially if you’re role playing. 
---
500 or 1000 is no real downside in hindsight but I’d still keep it all again given the chance, considering I don’t believe giving it away achieves anything at all beyond you the player just missing out, sadly. Again, missed opportunity for the story to make choices matter I think but still.
---
Emil Pagliarulo and Chris Cummings
---
are you on console or something?
---
it's not after 10:00 am ET, but disconnections are happening
---
Because the video game is not well made
---
DCs are always happening.
---
that makes no difference to me, no matter where i try it, i have no possibility to attach wallpaper to the element "wooden wall with window".
---
1. Whataver the hit was I didn't notice tbh, so it couldn't have been that bad.
---
2. Yes you can, kinda. You should do both questlines up until the mission siding with foundation/crater. If you do this you can get the chinese stealth armor from foundation, and if you are nice to ra-ra during her raiders mission and you choose to raid the vault with the raiders you can get a unique plasma rifel called the slug buster.
---
3. You can get rep from the random encounter spawns, it's not much though so I rarely bother.
---
4. Yeah do the missions up to Side with and then choose your faction.
---
5. I went raiders as I enjoed those missions more, this was a happy accident as I got the unique plasma rifle without knowing about it beforehand.
---
Their not down yet, works fine for me... Also its not 10am est yet
---
Announcement in the game is handy thou.
---
I get the same thing with cop a squatter. my guess is that some other player happen to be in that area and kills everything that needs killing so you get the win.
---
There is. When you log in look at the little news box in the top right hand corner.
---
Did you read the post?
---
1. The only choice that reduces rep is keeping all the gold for yourself. Even so it will be the rationally most beneficial choice for most people since you're likely to need more time to farm gold bullion then to max out both faction reps.
---
2. Settlers give a worker uniform and hat, Raiders have a chance to get a legendary plasma rifle, provided you've been nice to Ra Ra.
---
3. Faction dailies and the Photo Opportunity daily from the Overseer's bot give the most rep. Handing over Mirelurk Queen meat to Blackeye at Ohio River adventures is also advised. Anything else including the random encounters gives negligible rep gains.
---
4. Nope. Get the vault raid done ASAP after getting to the "Side With" quests for both factions, so you can start earning gold bullion.
---
5. I did both on different characters. I found the Raider quests more interesting, to be honest.
---
So lets be clear: Technically it is free. If you want to complete it and don't want to play 3 hours a day, 5 days a week you will have to pay your way up. 1.5 USD per level. So if you want ton complete it but have to buy the last 50 levels it will cost USD 75 every 3 months. It actually makes Fallout 1st look like a bargain.
---
And Bethesda always starts slowly, i'am sure next season the killer item will be paywalled behind level 100....
---
Yes, that's what I meant. It's handy.
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah I guess so. Its really weird because it happens even I don't have the daily active
---
Ah, sorry, OP is sarcastic, so thought you were being sarcastic too. That said, I missed that one, so have added it in, thanks!
---
Following
---
I'm on PC :)
---
You should have been here before they added to plans to defiance. I remember a couple months after I did the quest hearing people talk about that armor and realized I had scrapped the chassis when clearing out my inventory. Never even got to wear the darn thing.
---
The only things that get locked out are the Slug Buster (from the raiders near the very end of the vault) and the faction specific outfits at the end. Chinese Stealth Suit comes before that point, I would assume you already have that now anyway. The Slug Buster is a decent plasma rifle but it's nothing amazing, plus people often sell them so it's not too hard to get one if you miss it. The outfit from the settlers is some boring denim outfit with a backwards cap, and the raiders outfit is a fairly cool looking blue coat with a somewhat silly ski hat &amp; mask combo. 
---
The rep doesn't go down for the side you didn't side with, and rep gain isn't any slower after. The final bar of rep for either faction takes ages no matter what, but you'll get a nice boost for whichever side you pick. In addition to the daily from each settlement, you can earn raider rep at Ohio River Adventures killing mirelurks, you can sell/give Davenport's photos to either faction, and there are various random encounters where you can help either faction in battle, or just give a random NPC water or chems. These are all very small rep gains but you can find these encounters at lots of places on the map and do them repeatedly all day if you want. 
---
After having done both storylines on different characters, I'd honestly have to say the raiders questline feels like more work was put into it. The characters are more entertaining and diverse, the quests are more interesting. That said, the vault raid itself isn't too different depending on the faction. After it's all said and done, and you've maxed rep with both factions, it doesn't end up feeling much like you picked a side at all. The other faction won't treat you any differently, aside from a random encounter with a settler who will scold you for having high rep with the raiders no matter which side you picked for the vault raid- if your settler rep isn't maxed, you'll lose a tiny bit for any answer you give them so every time I get that encounter I back out of the conversation and walk away.
---
10 of us. Stole someone else's osmosis kit when I didn't even have my quest up
---
Hmmm, shovels... one is in flatwoods, near the church where the tinker bench is. another is in helvetia, in the shack with the weapons bench, IN that compartment of the bench. just two places i know for sure...
---
There's no way of knowing until the patch is available is the actual answer.
---
I make it a point to close doors I've opened at people's camps. Seems rude not to, IMO.

Maybe shouldn't say anything but yes, and demolition expert even increases the damage in pipboy lol

My current loading screens are page fat face and that fucking watchtower. Need to clean gallery asap.
---
The only real thing I'm looking forward to from Seasons as far as ranks are the Ammo Converter and the Perk Card packs.  
---
I don't see a good return on my play time vs reward.
---
No argument here however if you think the 'cannot be placed' issues are bad now could you just imagine?
---
Do people use the chat mod a lot??
---
1 - No, you will not lose any rep regardless of your choice. You will lock yourself out of any missions on the side you didn't choice, thus losing the rewards. For example the Chinese stealth suit.  However the side you don't choose will not lose any rep.
---
2 - No, any missed rewards can be traded for or brought with gold bullion.
---
3 - Yes, there's guilds on YouTube for this. If you help settlers and raiders you run into in the world which are under attack, you gain a small amount of rep. Also the raiders have a side mission you can do at
---
4 - I'm not sure what you mean but only one mission reward can be brought with bullion and it is not cheap. Better to just do all the raider and settler mission till you have to do the heist. 
---
5 - I choose the settler because they matched then character I was playing. Currently having a raider play though
---
My low level dude (not so low anyone *ahem*) has not completed Mayor for a day yet, so I will rather not go to Watoga and get my ass fried

"Have you seen those Mothman Cultists? Straight out of the loony bin, I tells ya."

Umm there are npcs. Like a lot of npcs

PRO TIP: if you get confused with Bethesda related timezone announcements just type into Google(or yahoo search) just type in "Bethesda time to (your time zone here)" and the Internets will give you the correct time information.
---
Yeah exactly, it has the snap so it can be more consistent and this is the result, inagine without. 🤯
---
I give all my Davenport intel to Foundation for the minuscule amount of additional reputation, as the tiny amount of caps I get from him aren't worth it. you still get the 3 treasury notes.
---
It's useful for damaging enemies with high DRs, like the sbq
---
So if I leave my xbox on overnight ot will download the update automatically?
---
Don´t know if you are a troll or if you didn't read my post. I´m talking about the old Main story. Not wastelanders.
---
Does the chat mod work well with the Steam version?
---
Same for me after wastelanders I moved next to wayward, tons of sales every day and people passing by checking my camp. It was great until apparently everyone moved there, I had to serverhop 5-10 times to place my camp for over a month, sales and people checking my camp daily kept me there until couple days ago. I started recently playing with friends and I couldn't place my camp in their world. I moved, only a couple sales the past few days in the new place and my camp isn't appreciated anymore but every time placing my camp now is 100% worth it.
---
But I only have the time to play at that time. Bethesda should defer the update just for me 😋🥳🤗
---
Hang on I’ll call Todd now! 😉
---
She was outside of the Crater last week and when I went to find her she was killing the Observant Radstag.
---
Son of a bitch.
---
I could litterally hear you sigh heavy in that respons lol.. Thanks for trying though :)
---
Sir I read your whole post...
---
The question is did you read your post because you seem more like a troll then ever with your last comment
---
First off you never stated anywhere in the post that you were talking about prewastelanders. You just said the story of the game and that’s it. 
---
Bethesda added this dlc to fit in what was missing FROM the story and add on from it So if someone wanted you could argue that wastelanders Is apart of the main story. 
---
You are a troll I’m not
---
I bet it's 100% long
---
I didn’t realise, until that moment, that it was possible to sigh and bang your head on a hard surface at the same time.
---
IDK - the L5 instigating fire axe and L20 vampire machete were quite useful to me until I got to about L45.
---
And yes, so did a chain wrapped baseball bat :)
---
the sheepsquash
---
Take this post down. I have been blessed in the last month as well. What are you doing!!
---
Never seen that quest. Though I'm only level 64.
---
it's 7am they said 10am for patch wtf is going on ???
---
Ether there is a issue on reddit that left out selected part of info or your post or you just edited it.
---
But it doesn't need to load everything fully.  It can be done, if Bethesda wants it done.
---
I don't know how Xbox works but I would imagine there is a standby mode like PS4's rest mode.
---
Nope, it’s been that way since I posted. The only part that was edited was added in caps.
---
Same! Bastarding door!! And the one in the Prison.
---
yes i did and it crashed public server 4 times went to my rented and it works
---
I like the one that says "Look who wandered in from the wasteland. Good to see you." But I never want to see the rest of these characters again. Not even the Overseer's mr. Handy
---
It is if the trap owner has to go into build mode, that's just plain uncreative. Laziness.

She's cosplaying as the g-spot. (Thank you, Cards Against Humanity)

Do you remember the crashed limo outside the gates? There's a wooden post just behind it. If you slap your Tent down on the road, beside the post, the Scorched will all spawn, all together, right in front of the missile launcher. It's magical!

And you get rose's chat every time!

Then you decide to play and the only thing in the way of your camp is a dog

Yeah, i remember going into a tower to find two settlers making a living... amongst a rotting corpse

You have had your answer but its 3pm UK - 4pm EU.

Hope that helps a little

Could you ask him to rebind the keyboard control? I often have too much guac on my fingers, I would prefer if I could play the game using only pinkies.

“•	⁠The Original main story is actually quite good if you get into it. But it´s a bit different and you will have to read a lot of terminals and listen to a lot of holotapes as there aren't any NPC's in that story. But it´s quite an in depth story and a sad one. Take your time to really immerse yourself in it and i think it will be a hit.”

Waao so cool 👍🏻

I'm having fun (:

From the grave of the soldier head straight west for 2 mins, youll encounter the scorched radiation pit. Theres a shovel there.

Safe to assume the update will be live about 3 hours after servers go down? Probably get cancelled when they break something and rescheduled for tomorrow. I wish they would fix stealth and weapon degradation back like it was in patch 18 and leave it be. But it seems like tweaking this breaks that and vice versa. Wish they didn't code a house of cards.
---
In case anyone doesn't know, there is an official page showing whether the server is down. [link](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Once I got to level 100 with a good weapon, I just went flying through and reached 145 in 3 weeks or so and I don't play more than 4 hours a day. Server hopping Huntersville and West Tek helps a lot. Running the highway from watoga to thunder mountain is great for killing mobs too. Also you may use a fast melee to save up ammo in low level areas. Try to attend as much public events as you can.
---
Of course, all this if you want to stay with the same character.
---
... But you have to craft them yourself?

Stack cranberry relish, leader bobbles, well rested and berry mentats. Extra 20%. Make sure your intelligence is as high as possible. Try to find armor with intelligence perks. Run westek, whitesptings, burrows, etc repeatedly. You’ll level up quickly. Hunker down hard on the next double xp weekend. Levels will come quickly since you’re a lower level player.
---
Wait about 6 hours and see what the new update brings, see if there's anything you'd be keen on working toward.
---
I sometimes do a ‘walk about’ and get genuine joy discovering a new location.  Might only be a farm but makes my fallout day.  Stumbling across deathclaws is also fun, I can one shot them with my boxing glove but they still scare the shit out me!
---
and 4.00pm Southern Africa
---
Okay? Doesn’t mean shit? I’m starting to wonder if your a troll or just someone who doesn’t have a life with half the iq points that a normal human being usually has.
---
Just because you said the original main story doesn’t mean that it’s prewastelanders. Like I said the main story was everything INCLUDING wastelanders altogether. And wastelanders is what finished the main story off. Bethesda tweeted that out themselves. So when you say there aren’t any npcs in that story doesn’t make sense. 
---
So the ORIGINAL MAIN STORY does indeed have npcs and they sure do have a lot of them.
---
What the patch is going on???? I am still in game servers seem fine ....
---
No that is the settler wanderer
---
Wait, you can manually start it again at the computer in Fort Defiance as much as you want? I thought it worked like the other dailies.
---
"You couldn't keep a cow out of this place" name that quote
---
I'd really like an alien/ufo themed dlc on Fallout 76, like mothership zeta in Fallout 3 👽
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
1) I didn't notice any drop in reputation ... so I think there is no reduction
---
2) you can lock you out of the preparation quests, so just do both sides first.
---
3) settlers: daily quest, sell photos, send the raider in rocksys quest to foundation (needs 8 CHA), help in random encounters
---
raiders: daily quest, sell mirelurk meat + defend against mirelurk (was bugged for me), sell photos, help in random encounters
---
4) there are no benefits for waiting, you can continue doing the daily quests after finishing the quest
---
5) I did both: best thing for me is doing all quests, then go in with the raiders (you get a unique legendary plasma rifle), then keep all gold for yourself.
---
reason: as you can just continue getting reputation you will max it out anyway, but getting gold takes a lot longer as you only get 200 per day plus 300 per week
---
But its going to say I lack entitlements and I'm going to be scared!!!!!
---
Everything about laser weapons in fallout doesn't make sense. A laser is just light/photons, so why don't they travel at the speed of light? why can they impact and move objects since it shouldn't have mass or kinetic energy? With everything else wrong about them, why couldn't they transmit diseases?
---
Or when you got to turn it in and you have to approach them 30 times before you can say here’s your junk.
---
1. They have their gauntlets???
---
2. Im not sure. Maybe its because it wants to kill us and not make us do its bidding?
---
Interesting if this is the case.
---
Clarification would be good.
---
The flamer mod was improved in Wastelanders so it's now useful against ghouls, although it still does damage fairly slowly. I agree though, the chainsaw still does need an update. If we could get a level 50 variant with legendary effects, it might just work.
---
&gt;Frigging text chat
---
This would solve SO many issues.  Surely it has to be worth any downsides.  Why hasn't it been implemented yet?
---
Yeap. I did like 40 times or so.. actually it is veeeeeeeery fast and easy. U can watch movies doing this.
---
Says the name is mothman?
---
Im a griefer in this regard. I embarked on a quest to nuke every camp that occupies my spot in hopes of making it generally known as a spot where nukes often land, so people avoid it.
---
But there's still 3 hours to go, I want to know if their down now and for how long. ;)
---
People often build their camps at the same spots to harvest various nodes you can find
---
theres only so many spots that have harvestable nodes. So yeah theyre popular.
---
Britney Shears
---
Nice, thanks for the tip! Quite useful trick for some easy quest farming. Can't believe I've never tried to go back to FD to start it again after finishing the daily.
---
Even though the down time is noted on their website, forums, social media and even on the games freaking title screen people are still going to ask "are the servers down" and probably even submit a support ticket, derpety derp derp derrrrrrp
---
I won't mind going out of my way for some challenges.  I'll even group up if there's an easy, convenient way to do it without using a mic.  But if there's a roadblock with some group or pvp shit that is non-trivial then I will complain on Reddit, mark my words!
---
Need help tring to find scout armor mask or sell one
---
&gt; like reducing effectiveness if you keep using the same food or drink all the time
---
My 2500 dog food disagree
---
It fixes it for some people.  Some people didn't have a problem with it in the first place.  And for some people all it does is postpone the problems for a few hours until the inventory/stash fills up with non-junk stuff instead.
---
But yeah, it should 100% be a base game
---
That was not the original main story. I’m not responsible for how you interpreted my text. Wastlanders is categorized as a DLC so it wouldn’t fall under the “original main story”. You can argue and disagree on it. Don’t see the need for this redundant argument of yours. And you are exactly what is wrong with the community, toxicity probably caused by some real life frustrations, making you unnecessarily lash out on the internet. Although that could easily be the definition of some parts of the internet. I wish you a good day and hope you resolve your issues :)

visit vault 88
---
Servers will be down for maintenance at 10 AM EST.
---
You could slap the announcement in some peoples face and they'd still not get it, there's some seriously brain dead simpletons out there, I lost faith in humanity working in retail as a young fella.
---
i thought this skin was unlocked from nuclear winter, so i wasnt sure if it would be a seasonal event
---
Why do we use caps straight out the gate? Shouldn't we have been using pre war money?
---
However all the different currencies being in game makes sense
---
God of war 2018,which is stunning, red dead redemption, and maybe hzd
---
I really enjoy killing the other hunting party and then sending another pair of hands to Foundation.  Then the raiders give me money!
---
Doesn't your Crosshair change when in range?
---
I also always kill the other hunters, but not before they give me their cut!
---
When is the update out?
---
Yes, definitely when you are starting out. But there does come a point where you no longer need those resources. That's when you can move wherever you like. In my case, i just wanted a good view.
---
That can be annoying which is why I moved my camp to a really nice spot in the Mire.   I get plenty of visitors but it’s very rare that I can’t place my camp.     I have a nice source of fresh water and I’m a short walk from the Free States vendor in Harper Springs.
---
U r welcome. Hope they won´t patch this soon.
---
My heart is full.
---
Punch a deathclaw to death!!!
---
Nah Nah. They used low decible sound waves, manipulated by stone cones, to make the pieces float!
---
... that's even more obnoxious!  Love it!
---
I do the quest because it is bugged in my favor.   Somehow I have the quest item stuck in my inventory.  All I do is go up to Ward once a day and get "I see you have our stolen items" and I get the EXP and three treasury notes.  I don't know  if the bug will remain after the update or make it impossible to ever do the quest again
---
I really do hope your a troll because every comment you make makes me seem like the way you comment about me is the way that you are in real life. Probably caused by some post traumatic stress. Like please go get some help and stop lashing out at people for no reason over the internet. There are people out there that can suit you very well for that. Stop defining me as you when it’s you that’s the problem. 
---
Also dlc means downloadable content. That has nothing to do with the fact that bethesda said it themselves that wastelanders finished off the main story to the game. As I said 3 times it is still apart of the main storyline and will always be apart of the main storyline. Stop making up excuses for your little internet rants. 
---
Npcs are thriving and vining in the main storyline and to say that they aren’t is a in-factual stupid remark. 
---
Please go seek help via talking with somebody because arguing with people over the internet does not help these sorts of issues 
---
Have a good day and I hope you resolve those issues and good luck in the wasteland that’s thriving with npcs!!! 😀
---
*You're welcome.*
---
I regularly gulp down 7 cartons of boiled water within the space of a couple of seconds, and then 10 minutes later I'm dying of dehydration again.  This isn't a survival mechanic, it's pointless busywork.
---
Thanks so much
---
How
---
So it has never taken a chainsaw an hour to kill a ghoul.  They are level capped, but there are things that could be done to increase their damage.  As was previously said, the flame attachment now makes a huge difference.  Also the bar that you have can make a difference.   I prefer the dual bar as it deals double the damage.  And since it is very fast, it will chew through anything in short order. 
---
My tip test different mods on the weapon in question.
---
Yeah, it's part of Wastelanders.
---
Imo it shouldn't show you the world until your camp can be placed. If your camp cant be placed on the first attempt it should create a new instance fresh just for you
---
So what you are saying is that you need some intervention with your hoarding problem?
---
But what if I'm already at max caps?
---
&gt;why would anyone ever try to sell any then??
---
They don't, because this system is insane and stupid and should never have been made this way and everyone knows it.
---
Sorry mate was with him for 10 mins and then left. Was heading north from Charleston station if that helps
---
I don't have that problem with ward, mostly because that daily is bugged
---
Lol then servers aren’t down.
---
Have you ever checked, in task manager, how much memory the game uses while playing it? I tend to run out of ram sometimes in certain heavily modded games.
---
Just do not force yourself to playing that character. If you dont like it, play another game and come back ( double / tripple xp weekends are comming / at least I hope so  :D ).  
---
Or keep playing your first char and step by step improve it :)  
---
Give us a hint what special do you have and what is the build you like to play.
---
Oh Nice, Not really touched the quests yet, Glad I was not going mad.
---
Either you didn't do the DLC yet or you done goofed and sided with the raiders without doing all the settlers missions first.  Settlers storyline will take you there and earn you an item that otherwise will cost you 5000 bullion to unlock.
---
Yea it’s wastelanders. Pretty amazing location actually.
---
Just like my ex-wife.
---
Then you can’t see it.
---
Sounds cool I'll check it out
---
&gt; I’m happy to not have to click on items every 15 minutes to fill that otherwise pointless meter.
---
The thing is, as I understand it, they're going to keep the buffs from being well fed / hydrated, and the debuffs from going low.  All they're doing is removing the HP loss, is that correct?
---
If so, keeping the water meter full is essential to effective AP regen and this change is only relevant in letting me forget about food, not water.
---
No, but I can do that for you now as I just got home. Hold on
---
I named mine Giggles and I love himb 💕 
---
My condolences for your loss.
---
Thanks for the reply, Only done the getting the fractions to take the antidote quest. Going to make sure I do the settlers first thanks for the heads up.
---
My understanding is you get it for one month, just like a subscription you have to Netflix, Hulu, your internet bill, any other subscription. If you buy on the 20th of the month you have it until the 20th of the following month.
---
You should still be able to place the box after sub is over but you cannot add to it.
---
Also better call your local PD just like that time Facebook went down.
---
Yeah I was taken back by it, When I first saw the entrance was a small hole I didn't expect that to be inside.
---
Fuck for real?
---
It's like 'the Institute'
---
Clearly a bug lol. Though she is mysterious.
---
The only way pvp would would and be successful is to get rid of all legendaries in a new survival mode and lock NEW characters to that mode.
---
Not only are the mojority of player not interested in PvP but they way they implemented "survival" mode last time was embarrassing. 
---
Gear vs gear PVP is the worst kind of PvP. No skill involved.
---
Works for me as well. As it is now the weapon is valueless.  I like your responder view but the ability to create fast travel spawns for free could become an issue if unchecked. Maybe a cool down per player for that weapon.
---
&gt;Why should I have to repair my weapons and armor?  So tedious.. Why do I need to scrap weapons and armor to know mods?  So tedious, shouldn't I just have them all known?
---
You can be facetious all you want, I'd be very happy if armour and weapon degradation was removed entirely, and if none of the plans were learned from scrapping.
---
This is the great part about playing this game on XBox, I have a 55" 4k TV and it's graphics even make the Toxic Valley look good.
---
Same here
---
My fridge only serves as decoration. I carry over 300 weight of aid items and mostly food,so 15 items is just absolutely useless to me.
---
I can kind of understand that because it's from MIT so I can see why they'd get rid of the M and the T in the name.  
---
Though for potentially interesting factions with poor execution, i tend to point at the Institute.... and Fallout 4
---
I found it recently as well. I think it’s part of a wastelanders quest (I’m not positive though) so I am holding off exploring too much before I finish all the quests I have in my log (800 hours in the game so far for me)
---
This post wins the day, :D
---
Lmao, Yeah, When I play I just go around collecting junk, checking out camps and making my own. If your ever in need of scrap I have 1000's of each.
---
Me too, with the summer season being captain Cosmos themed they might drop some very Spacey stuff!
---
Yeah. Chinese stealth armor is awarded for finishing the quest that happens here.  If you don't get it for free you can buy it from the settlers once your rep is high enough, but the armor is like 4k bullion and the helmet is 1k or so.
---
Cool. I didnt know that.
---
Wtf is up with the overseer never leaving her house? Vault syndrome much?
---
Also, btw : you can get the firebreather coat from her display case if you throw a grenade behind the case, it'll pop out. Not the helmet sadly
---
I don't understand your timeline. Will items take no budget AFTER patch 20,or is it already like that NOW?
---
no.  Exit the world and rejoin.
---
I wonder why no one steals from the Crater.
---
That makes sense Still not really touched Wastelanders DLC. I will get around to it one day.
---
The wise Mothman is... A shapeshifter?!!! XD
---
Nice to know. I have turned around from here so can't wait to get the quest. See what it's all about.
---
Seriously and for all the work that went into the institute! Should've been way more to do in there
---
Today you win the internets.
---
I just hadn't seen them so I asked.
---
When I went there for the quest line there were several legendaries inside. Does anyone know if that is a good place to go once you have finished the DLC to farm more legendaries?
---
This is not looking good for you. I'm up at [6,4 GB RAM](https://www.reddit.com/user/PsYch0_PoTaT0/comments/hilsn7/who_cares_what_i_call_it/) usage.
---
you can still place the scrap box in other locations and take stuff out. just can’t put stuff in.
---
Fuckkkkkkkk
---
I even found this area but went full sith and said fuck the foundation. 
---
It was at this moment that I knew, I fucked up"
---
If I do it on another character can I trade it? Cuz I'm currently in cautious with the settlers and ally raisers and Jesus that grind was a pain
---
Interesting, Would like to know also.
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Thanks but it’s just pre-empting the inevitable.
---
If they gave you everything at the start what is there to play for?  Don't be a wuss and grind like the rest of us.
---
Well that would make the assassins prefix useless. I also considered that but this will shake the market in a negative way.
---
That's why I came up with the weapon individual damage caps, this will not only make almost all weapons viable, it will also need everything to strong to its corners. Armor then only exist to keep the enemy from hitting the damage cap. It's a little hard to explain for me since I'm a non native English speaker but I hope you got what I mean.
---
You're right, Pvp now dosent need any skill but with the changes I presented it will make a big step in the right direction.
---
Much appreciated, I'm not too new but I'm at almost 300 hours and this is my first time finding out you can get that armor for free. I went raiders for the bullet machine and it's alot slower than I was hoping for
---
probably looking for the raiders who left
---
badly.
---
The emphasis placed on finding that bone saw has some sinister implications.
---
Can I start downloading the update now or do I have to wait until 10am?
---
Im usually at 7.5-8 GB of ram usage when I play.
---
Other than the Railroad they all could of been interesting.  
---
Minutemen could of been amazing, militia of settlers forming a organized resistance to raiders but not only are they WIPED OUT by the time you come along but you are put in charge of them 5 minutes later and then it's just a never ending fetch quest of protecting different settlements.  
---
Bethesda in the Elder Scrolls tends to hand the main storyline and then the Guilds have their own storyline. Why couldn't the Minutemen by about rebuilding it's ranks, with you taking Preston advice at first but as time goes on you start being given dialogue options that show you have a skill at leadership.  
---
But no! we needed 4 dialogue options and I needed to be the baddest ass straight away.   
---
Nothing I hate more then taking back the castle, as the General using a plan that Preston had to explain to me like a baby but don't worry... i'm in charge
---
You're so mean OP, I like you!
---
in the tunnels there is unique creature, the owlet, if you manage to kill and collect its meat it you’ll unlock a recipe.
---
What if two people are joining the same server at the same time, with the same location, but noone is currently occupying the location, how would you do that?
---
don’t you go around causing problems, I already got enough on my plate
---
I end up doing the same and see if they have anything i need in ther vendor machine.
---
Just make sure that when you take that picture of Black Bear Lodge that it says so in the top right corner. Oh... by the way... it should say black bear lodge 2! There’s actually two of them...
---
Not tradable, character specific.
---
Well with public teams this might be easier for solo players.
---
I take all their free water as payment for all that loading!
---
The Ramshackler.
---
The huge hurdle you have to jump is actually getting the FO base, who is used to solo PVE, interested in PvP. 
---
As it stands now the overwhelming majority of fo76 player want nothing to do with PvP. That's one major reason Survival failed. Bethesdas fault for not knowing and understanding their own player base i guess.
---
I personally wont play a PvP mode simply because my gear is setup for PvE. I have no interest in acquiring new PvP gear to be able to compete. If legendary gear was gone and new characters were locked I would at least attempt playing it.
---
Support ticket, ha!  If they complain here I’ll bet they 100% believe that this subreddit is their support ticket.  Cause Bethesda created Reddit right?
---
Pinkie only SBQ challenge?
---
Yea we need a few different options for stairs, gimmi a spiral, gimmi a 180 that turns back on itself and a 90 to go in the corners pleeeease :)
---
When you were able to repair to 200% and it'd give you extra damage, then they were viable.  Sadly they got rid of that bit of fun.
---
So instead of a QOL update you'd rather pay for it?
---
Seriously. It’s in FO4’s DLC already. I’d even take one that simply teleports you up/down if they have bug/client sync issues making it move. Id love a craftable elevator. Hell sell vault tec style one on atom shop for all I care and add a some other types as faction rewards.
---
Wait do you just have to enter Fort Defiance or do you have to use the terminal upstairs on level 3 and click something to start it?
---
Also, how are you not having to kill a different ScorchBeast every time to get the DNA sample? Are you just taking it from the same corpse every time?
---
LAMBorghini
---
I’m level 130 and never even seen a Super mutant behemoth.
---
Oof
---
I expect group challengers to be included every day so they can really spotlight the new public teams system
---
I get it. And that's why it wins the day. :D
---
Fully agree on the first point and I know what you mean with both the other.
---
 I mean a mode where you start over again with open PvP and no legendaries is cool, but I tried to find a solution to more or less ban pvp from adventure without destroying the builds and gear of many players.
---
What? Servers are down and sticky? Did someone spill nuka cola on them?
---
One always spawns just down for Solomons pond! One sometimes spawns at the bog town too
---
Isn't the UK using BST (GMT +1) at the minute?
---
So it should be 4pm (BST).
---
I have another, “Why don’t we have reflections?”
---
Idk anymore. Im 90% sure its 3pm in britain
---
That sucks. None of the items you can buy with bullion are tradeable or transferable.
---
Hasn't happened to me personally, but I know of at least one case where something like that happened up near Grafton.
---
We should be able to see how long is left on nukes just by hovering over it on the map too. There is many many little QOL improvements they could do but just don’t bother lol
---
Bring back the Solar Scorcher from Fallout 2 would complete this build.
---
Yeah the castle is such a waste. Could have been so much more. We should have cannons and daily muster etc. I do love calibrating the artillery though, fun
---
Thanks, I’ll check it out.
---
It could be a question of bytes rather than kilobytes. There’s three coordinates that it can calculate distances with pretty quickly.
---
Yeah, I'm from the UK, just not sure if we're still in BST, or back to GMT. 
---
Most of my clocks change automatically, so it's not something I usually have to think about...
---
eBay vs eBay
---
Yep, but before doing that, check around the tree close to the grave.
---
Also, once you're finished, drop the shovel on the ground!
---
Noone forces a person to be so desperate for a stupid cosmetic item to actually pay real money for it.
---
The what!??
---
I'm probably going to be on for 3pm and 4 so it doesn't bother me as much.
---
I'm not saying they are forcing it, I'm just saying its ridiculous(and I had to word it right so reddit would let me post it)
---
Were still on BST
---
No
---
Oh yeah, same here.
---
Are there any downsides of keeping all the gold?  Would it better to split it and remain cool with everyone?
---
Oh rip so 4pm?
---
The problem isn’t the first time. It’s the second and third time it asks you. If I say find another it should bloody well find me another world where I can place my CAMP.
---
What about a double rainbow?
---
Bethesda should stop people paying money for an item by adding it to the store where you pay real money for it.. Sounds legit. 🙄
---
An energy pistol that is essentially solar powered. It recharges the shots in full sunlight but won’t function at night or in caves.
---
Are the severs down?! I can't play whilst they update the game?! But what else will I do? I play this game for 8 hours a day! I hope Bethesda gets shut down and every employee gets fired so they struggle to pay rent!! They deserve it for this slight hiccup in my procrastination time!
---
One of my characters is unarmed. It's totally viable. High damage with the right perks and weapons and you never have to spend your time worrying about crafting ammo / buying ammo. There's something nice about getting your meat hook right in there and coated with blood.
---
No even though were on BST it says the update will happen at 3PM UK time.
---
Google " fallout 76 update 20 uk time" it says there
---
Wait a sec. You can not try for a new server and check out the person in your spot?
---
If you go to a new server does your camp get placed?
---
So this is very confusion.?
---
That's just stupid lmao I didn't notice that but I wasn't on here much right after wastelanders launched, clearly some people didn't play the beta, same thing happened with that, all kinds of bug reports but like none were fixed for the game launch
---
I just really hope they start paying attention to stuff like that
---
Solar Armor is seriously underrated
---
This doesn't solve griefing at all. 
---
Firstly, you can't "solve" griefing because it's a concept, not a game mechanic. As there are new game mechanics and bugs found, there's the potential for more griefing. Hell, we still right now at least have a couple of ways that are well known to a lot of players. Removing PvP does zero to deal with these issues.
---
Secondly, while I'm not against people having PvP in the game if they want it, survival worlds showed that there weren't enough people interested in PvP. By the end of survival mode's life, there were more people there to leverage the better server performance for vault raids than there were actual PvP players.
---
I say more power to you separating PvP from Adventure mode but we shouldn't have to wait to remove PvP from Adventure mode now. Remove all PvP from adventure mode now and remove any silly challenges that will put anyone in harms way of doing PvP i.e. workshop challenges, and when enough interest is shown, then Bethesda can work on the PvP worlds as a separate thing.
---
All they’ve actually said is that they’re removing the penalties. We know nothing beyond that. 
---
If imagine that you’re right, you’ll still need to be well hydrated to keep the AP refresh buff, but who knows, they could rework that too. It’s hard to tell what they consider a debuff.
---
I do get that but unfortunately the people who spent so much time getting PvP gear are the minority.  They would only be left fighting themselves on such a mode.  Which I think is what ultimately happened on survival and led to its demise.
---
 Every time I played on survival I saw the same 3 or 4 people killing either everybody else on the server or each other over and over.
---
What normal non pvp geared player in their right mind would want to play on a mode against people who are twinked out to fight PVP only?
---
What is so special about the place that you have built your c.a.m.p that you absolutely have to be at that location?  I almost never run into a c.a.m.p placement issue.
---
Correct I dont understand it personally. Because wouldn't that imply we get it 1 hour earlier then?
---
Not particularly, no. It is/was good for the flower gathering weekly challenge, though, because it has a high density of one of those flowers.
---
That's a totally legit thing to do, but I think that once you indicate that you want to find a world where your camp can be placed, it should check that before dropping you in and asking again.
---
It's usually only once for me, but I've had it happen four freaking times in a row, which is annoying given the length of the load screen.
---
Because your 2 hours after them so they were right at time
---
Sweet Jesus my head hurts
---
I've had to do that wayyyyy too many times. My camp has changed so many times.
---
Ugh I hate this. I mean I get it, ammo is precious but not that precious. I get way more enjoyment knowing I’m a huge factor in defeating the queen in whatever group I’m in. I don’t run bloodied or junkies so it’s nice seeing myself actual dealing some damage to her and helping out even if I use a couple thousand rounds it just feels good man idk how to explain it, the adrenaline, the in the moment decisions you have to make, fending off scorched monstrosities on the frontline, it makes me not even care about how much ammo I use, I feel like a soldier just trying to survive the battle and when it’s all over and the queen drops it feels like a real victory. Then I’ll proceed to evaluate my supplies and gear up/craft more ammo for the next fight. The fight never stops, and war never changes. I feel like the ultra meta builds ruin the immersion for the queen fight at least. It’s disappointing to get to a fight and the queen drops in like 20 seconds or less. I don’t ever even want to be that strong, definitely not why I play fallout. But I am slowly working on a berserkers build hoping it’s not too overpowered. Seems like a pretty modest build with better damage output than AA which is what I’m doing now. AA gauss rifle gueen headshots are lovely. Wow, sorry for the long reply to your small comment I guess my point is I’m still gonna be unloading lead into that bitch!
---
Let's just find out in 2 hours
---
For my special junk I cant display I use my 4th vending machine. I price everything at 30000 caps and hide the vendor in a sealed room away from the other machines. Yes people could still buy from it if they found it but at least it prevents the game from scraping it.
---
So what you are saying these are really just minors in miners clothing?
---
I came to have two, by legitimately grinding Fort Defiance....not our fault it’s one of, if not the rarest drop in the game.
---
Something has to be rare.
---
If they do this, then it will just be whatever is the next rarest.
---
It also made the moth man noise before appearing.
---
It's a temporary storage box for trading between characters lol, so unless you specifically made the choice to leave it in there, you could put stuff in, switch characters and remove the items
---
Like I said in another comment there needs to be a reason not to just use it as an extra stash box, but I'm open to anything that accomplishes that
---
Good idea
---
Fast travel to Solomon's pond and do a 180 from where you load in.  Walk down the hill and you'll find him chilling in a pond if someone else didnt just kill it.  
---
Makes for a good target for testing out new weapons and deciding if it's worth keeping or scrip.
---
That one's *easy*, pfft.
---
**We're all vampires.**
---
Doesnt have to cost money if you grind for atomic points.. like a normal human being
---
No, let there be rare items like this, i wish there were more. people need to realize that it’s just an outfit
---
Ok thanks. Depending on when the update finishes I might wait till tomorrow to start my subscription then, so that I've not wasted today
---
But then in the atomic shop the item is guaranteed, on Ebay etc. it is highly likely a scam.
---
How about absolutely hell no!
---
I've already spent 90 hours looking for this stupid bloody thing. At first it was just checking when i joined a world. Then it was a quick server hop before i went off. Then it was a quick server hop when i got on. Then it was an hour here and an hour there. I'm committed now  and i'm gonna find that thing!
---
I’m just really excited to try out the public teams, I enjoy playing solo but sometimes having another person with you makes it way more fun
---
Shhh! That’s my plan.
---
That's not true, but it might increase the risk. 
---
I'm not sure whether this accounts for all scenarios, but possible ways to secure vendors is place them up high, don't use displays, don't allow your camp to not be placed, don't keep empty vendors and don't keep your total inventory value so low that someone could potentially empty them.
---
I put my vendors and benches in log cabins to avoid that. There's no reason for them to go into the main house, though they do.
---
All they'd need to do to alleviate that grind a bit is to adjust the drop rate for the red dress so it isn't ten times rarer than the forest and yellow dresses. If it were only two or three times rarer than the forest dress, it would still be a long, frustrating grind, but not nearly as hopeless as it is right now.
---
Level 89 and never seen one too. Hope to see one eventually...
---
I’ve had pretty good luck there with legendaries. Probably 1/4 visits I see 1-2 legendaries there. It takes all of a minute to run through, so it’s an easy spot to check. Lots of stims too, and some Cave Crickets for acid if you explore a little further. 
---
Here’s my walkthrough: https://youtu.be/HK0YoH2PeNQ
---
How long did that take you, and you selling one?
---
Best i can do you is two
---
Are you aiming for headshots? You should be getting way more damage out of a railway than 150 even at your level. I'm assuming you have Rifleman perks.
---
I tried to put a keypad door on and it insists on putting it on backwards. That is, it puts the keypad inside, which is... not useful.
---
6 is impressive, heh...
---
A few weeks after launch my low char around lvl 15 encountered 4 of them at the street between Charleston Herald and the Capitol building, chasing some ghouls. Needless to say, I did not fight them. 
---
Never met one in the forrest again, but they are quite common between Pylon V13 and bog town, usually alone though.
---
Considering they moved back the colosus event and legendary perks it's starting to look like they might actually be paying attention now at least.
---
That would work too 😊
---
Too much for a 4GB stick to handle anyway
---
Yeah me too actually. Now if only there was text chat so I could communicate with my new team mates. No, don’t want to use a microphone, thanks.
---
Once I saw a behemoth stuck at the second floor of general steak house. I think, no problem, going to sneak-headshot it. I shot, it shook slightly. Then I realise there are multiple behemoths glitched and stuck at the exact same position. They started throwing rocks at me and I dodged left and right. Turns out there are ~10 behemoths stacked together...
---
No.
---
I'm ok with not having everything. I'd like to have one of everything, but then where is the sense of accomplishment when you do?
---
I'll keep trying, and will just have to console myself until then with my 3 forest camo jumpsuits....
---
I've seen two at once at ABT before, but never 6. That's insane!
---
Why does food which has been sat perfectly preserved indoors/outdoors at any location for any given amount of time start to spoil the instant I pick it up? Am I the Lord of Decay?
---
Is the armor from the quest tradeable?
---
I just leave my mule on the door of 76, fast travel there with my main character on my private server with wathever I want to transfer, drop it on the ground, switch character and pick them up. I've never lost anything.
---
Groovy.
---
Level 15 that's crazy .After all the hours playing it's still nice to be surprised
---
I’m pretty sure you can only build the box while a fallout first member. I cannot even build one at a teammates camp if they don’t have 1st.
---
I wanna feel pretty, screw a sense of accomplishment lol
---
That's very true :) let's hope they keep listening lol
---
Rabble rabble rabble rabble rabble!!!
---
I've done the exact same thing. Using my time off to go absolutely HAM and get as much junk as possible. If you find anything good to sell consider taking flux and scrap as payment. You can always get caps.
---
Same! For a quick Cap sink I'll go buy some Bow/Crossbow mod Plans. Put them for sale in the Vendor, half hour later max Caps again. I need a bigger sink!
---
No. But you can craft many as you like...
---
Thanks for this. I just killed my first Behemoth! I dont know if they are rare or just don't count for random spawn areas but I am very thankful.
---
I loaded in the other day just as the nuke went off. All I got was a white screen that said "Respawn".
---
leather is currently the best for stealth because the shadowed mod only seems to work with leather.
---
Another cool idea... they could make a rainbow asylum uniform sense it is still considered pride right now. Thatd be pretty sweet.
---
I killed my first scorchbeast at level 35 or so using a chainsaw, it was when that 200% health extra damage was active and I still have that chainsaw in my stash, use to have it displayed in a wall. Those were the times...
---
Nothing says "pretty", quite like a sheepsquatch outfit! 😁
---
(555) 867-5309
---
Need to finish that quest also.  XBox GT: CannonHand76.  We can help each other.
---
My kids have their own characters under my account so if it's a Lvl72+ that will be me and then Lvl20+ and Lvl30+ will be my kids.  I will try to get them started on that questline.
---
When I spawned in the clear workshop event was on but there was only one low level super mutant there and it's when I got further into town the madness started
---
I dont think caps will buy one. Ive seen people trade them for armor and weapons worth in the 100k range
---
So are the servers down? 👀
---
That's crazy lol
---
As others have said use a container and never drop it on the ground. If you crash the items will still be in the container but if you dropped them in a bag they will be gone.
---
I only wear that when I want to assert a lil dominance. But usually I make Beckett wear it. 🤣
---
Well, the weapon itself doesn’t make sense. If it’s meant to be hooked up to a power source, then it shouldn’t work in the first place. I’d like to imagine it as you shoving MF Cells into the neck which drains it and transfers that power to the head. Then again the laser rifle or any energy weapon (except the fusion Gatling laser) doesn’t make sense since you pick up individual cells/cartridges but it only appears as one in the reload animation.

---
I've seen someone on reddit sell one for 8,000 caps. Blew my mind.
---
You could put a switch on your vending machines maybe, so you can switch them off when you don't want to sell stuff, presumably that would mean your camp wouldn't appear on the map and stop people fast travelling to it expecting to browse your machines.
---
I've seen someone sell one for 8,000 caps on reddit. Blew my mind.
---
Enclave is grey? lol
---
That's why I also noted Survivalmode exclusive rewards. So there is something to play for.
---
This has happened to me before, once when nuking Charleston capitol building, and once during Meat Week for a Primal Cuts event.
---
Do we eat bobbleheads or are they suppositories?
---
Genius. Thanks for that.
---
You also get to roll 3 please eves a day for secret service
---
I'm not getting the power armours until I have all the other stuff I want
---
They should remove the ability to vats in NW, nerf the gauss shotgun, then add a Fireproof perk card.
---
From what I've heard these ebay sells are scams. And also forbidden by BGS and PSN (don't know about Xbox)
---
Most groups are. Based on actions in 76, I’d say so. Dark grey, but still grey.
---
Woah I would've hopped on that real quick. The next rarest (pink/forest) even sell for 10-15k
---
Are you on PC?
---
Ahh I gotcha sorry I feel like an idiot now
---
Well for sure Trap camps and Scammers are still a problem but you won't have some dudes trying to kill you anymore with teaminvites, workshops or some other tricks.
---
It’s flat enough and has water.
---
If you get the T-65 you will avoid the heartache of rolling a 1-star Nocturnal SS Armor piece..
---
Hey Squeaky! How you been?
---
It was an older thread unfortunately. And usually I try not to be rude and hop on other people's sales even though they do it to me lol
---
I guess with PA you don't need to roll, just learn and craft...
---
I would say when it's convienent for you...
---
It is 10 pm Hong Kong..
---
I just want that big lighting rig from the poster
---
Think he said he drops tent at first corpse to fast travel back to it. And yeah in a comment he says use terminal inside to restart it.
---
If you have a full set of unyielding armor, it doesn't matter what kind of armor it is or if it's heavy, light, etc... What matters with stealth is how high your AGI is. I have a full set, I do not use the Sneak perk (though I do use Escape Artist), and I can crouch walk right up to a Super Mutant or Ghoul, smack them on the ass and they remain oblivious to my presence.
---
part of wastelanders.
---
I use 5 pieces of unyielding SS armor and underarmor w Agi +3.  I recently removed the Sneak perk card bc my agility is 30+ consistently and got back 3 points to use for something else.  I have this setup on both my characters- bloodied Melee and bloodied Rifleman and I can sneak right next to everything without being detected.  
---
No need for shadowed or leather.  
---
I’ve been using Dodgy instead, but I may only keep that only the Melee char.   The -30 AP on my rifleman seems too much of an impact during SBQ and regular SB fights.
---
B1337-stick?
---
I would  be pleased even if it was a foundation piece having to be on the ground floor. Just give us useful stairs that look like they belong in a house.
---
Ah right ok. I don’t get how you can take the sample from the same SB though cause pretty sure it just uses random meat drops and once you’ve collected it you can’t take it from the same source anymore.
---
For example once you take ‘Radroach Meat’ from a 
---
Radroach you can’t take it again if you leave and come back.
---
What about a 1 star nocturnal Gauss minigun?
---
Nah, i give it: At least 2 hours, at most 2 and a half, that's normally when servers go back up. So 12:30/12/40 EST. 2/1.5 hours sounds about right?
---
I assume the update will be around 10 GB max, 5 GB minimum.
---
probably next season.
---
Which device are you on?
---
Don't get me started on the cap cap
---
well atleast in the patchnotes they say how big the patch is for the various platforms
---
Sadly we’re not on PC
---
Oof.. I see your Gauss Minigun and raise you a Stalker's Gauntlet 🤦‍♂️
---
Who would downvote you? You're just speaking the truth after all.
---
Which device do you run on?
---
I don't usually see things like this happening until people mention it on here. And then people go 'I can do that?' and then the do that.
---
Don't need to roll for the PA, but the jetpack *is* pretty fun
---
Can you add me to the call list, plz?
---
Google
---
Which platform are you on OP?
---
Ooo I remember the disappearing camps lol.
---
It's one where you have to press Y (Xbox, dont know the other platforms) to collect it, it's not in the corpse's inventory.
---
What d'ya mean you don't love having 5 characters at 30k, and no market to spend them in?!
---
I've known about it for a bit, and am seeing it more and more.  The work around is some and why I am posting the fix.
---
"Sorry we found an exploit in the game and until we find a fix for it we're taking everything down for now!"
---
That's where I have a problem. Not a fan of forced PvP. Yes,  you are being forced to pvp if you dont like pvp but want the rewards.
---
If survival mode rewards stay on survival then thats fine. I don't have a problem with that. I despise crossover rewards.
---
Just like NW. Forcing players who want nothing to do with pvp to hide in bushes because they want the rewards.
---
Pvp servers wont succeed without players who actually want to be there.
---
Totally. I don't need crops or water, just a view. Really sad they took my cave away though, stupid Wastelanders
---
I can’t find anything on the time it will be available to download
---
They atleast should give us dmg resistance cards for explosives. There’s no reason that a tube/auto tube should be able to one shot someone.
---
I believe he was referring to comparing the effects of a shadowed mod on each of those armor pieces. The community consensus seems to be that the shadowed mod only works on leather pieces. I realize AT made this claim in his vids, and im not enough of an authority on game mechanics to contradict him, i just dont know how he proved it.
---
10am ET
---
Ok awesome. Gonna try this later!
---
That's true, but they don't need to be cosmetics, they can be like XP or scrap rewards as well as the unique weapons we had back in the survival mode days.
---
So when the game goes down for maintenance?
---
**Laughs in nvme**
---
No it was a new one on the shop last night. I've never seen I before but it may not actually be new. It came with a backpack aswell.
---
Inherent rad resistance is nice in the T-65, 2nd only to the SH.
---
Beyond that? Buttressed SS torso with a jetpack has been my favorite new thing in the game. Using AP only, instead of AP and fusion core is better, IMO. 
---
Eat a sugar bomb before you fire it, and you can make it to the stratosphere. Just hope you stick the landing...
---
Maybe she's tired of her shit as much as we are and is about to do the world a favor.
---
Bold of you to assume Bethesda reached the modern age and gave their dev more than a pencil and a notebook
---
Last time I found her she was sinking under the toxic powder into the very earth!
---
I'm not saying they are being forced, but the fact that people are paying large sums of money for not only the dress, but glitched lasers and pretty much everything else. It's kinda ridiculous... people are making money off of the game besides the creators... that shouldn't even be a thing.
---
Downloads are generally available 1-2 hours after start of downtime, so probably 1-2 hours after 10am ET :)
---
The real monster would play that shit ring of fire cover.
---
I fucking hate how bad that cover is.
---
I max out all the time. I'll go around buying frivolous crap from noobs then gifting it to other noobs lol
---
Or the poster itself as a decoration!!!
---
They already have those two/three ”new“ responders, one emt trainee type with a hound dog in Flatwoods, the one wannabee Firebreather, and that one dead guy who may have been a ex raider Or may have been a raider with an emt outfit.
---
Baaaad to the bone
---
At one point I collected every legendary MMG I could find. I’ve since sold them all off (I think) and stuck with the Instigating. I’m not convinced it’s the best one out there, but it does the best job of all of them that I’ve had. My armor is mix and match for the effects I want. Regenerating, unyielding, and life saving. I actually sort of like the mole miners, but they do drop good loot.
---
I killed that ex raider before I saw 'ex' in his name. Just out of habit
---
Hey bro, all good, how you doing?
---
To be fair this has been around for quite a while.  I don't think this is any big revelation or anything.
---
Correct. And it sucks. Have to dart off away from a friends base. Drop my tent. Just to get the man the scrap he needed. Then run back.
---
Kinda annoying.
---
Check your daily and repeatable quests for stings and things to see if you can activate the quest. Should point out 5 locations around the mire
---
Cod :ww2
---
Downside would be having to carry a larger assortment of weapons, which may make me having to constantly change perks. Or constantly have to go back and forth stashing stuff.  Good concept on paper , but actually having to live it? Idk
---
Account wide
---
That group in particular: BoS - Operation: hOpe4Future are a PC exclusive group.
---
Although unofficially speaking (As far as i can tell at the very least): My group (Xbox) is technically unofficially affiliated with 'em. So technically speaking I'm head of their Xbox detachment. Different names/same exact purpose. 
---
Confusing?: You betcha, but it's how i see it and i actually really enjoy communicating with u/Nymith, definitely knows his stuff that's for damn sure. Honestly i wouldn't have made it far without his continuous support/feedback.
---
If you OP need any help/suggestions or advice on how to properly run a true RP group/ideas on how to get the right people on board then talk to u/Nymith he's definitely bound to help you out.
---
Any quest on the map with a ! mark rewards Treasury notes.  One starts about every hour and the fewest number of notes you can get is 2.  You get 4 per Scorchbeast Queen fight. I drop 3 nukes / day personally, so that's 12 of the 20 I can turn in each day. I still have over 100 stockpiled from when I was trying to build up rep.  And yeah, I stopped doing those damn quests once I had maxed rep too.
---
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I really wish that there was some sort of story associated with each of the OoM bodies that I stumble across in the wasteland. Every time I find one, I wish that I could give them a burial or take back some sort of personal trinket similar to the way you’d handle someone’s dog tags. Put their death in the books, end their story.
---
Please do not visit my shitty camp lol
---
Yeah, energy weapon and sonic attacks make no sense.
---
My partner had her base setup right near the hatch just outside of whitespring for weeks before we discovered it, hadn't reached that part of the questline when we went exploring and it was extremely difficult in the mid 30s as we were. Very cool place, kinda wish bethesda had of done more with it and its inhabitants though.
---
I don't understand the "move your camp" comments. The majority of the time it can't place my camp, there is literally no one in my camp's location.
---
DCG
---
Lever, Tesla, Gat Plasma
---
PC
---
3pm UK
---
Well both
---
account wide meaning you only get one game board to complete.
---
locked in that some rewards are character specific
---
do the players have to alter anything, or is it just on the server side?  everytime there is a big update on ps4, i have to delete the whole game and re-download, otherwise i won't have "enough space"
---
👏👏👏
---
Cool shit! Nice to hear. Finally glad to see fellow Xbox players interested in truly Roleplaying it out in-game especially with Created Content. That definitely gives me complete hope.
---
Today will definitely be hopeful as well: Public Team Looking for Groups: Roleplay category will be interesting to say the least. Here's hoping people  (at least most) Roleplay in that particular one.
---
I like the damage I get from a lever. I like the effects (firing and reloading), and I like the costs. Everyone wants a handmade and fixer causing costs to go up, but few people want a lever.
---
There's also a baby interloper in the tunnels, and a corpse wearing the diving suit if you explore the entire area.
---
Pretty great addition, IMO
---
this is FO76.. go play those games...
---
2pm BST, cos it’s supposed to be summer in the UK
---
1) Why don't you have a chance to learn how to craft a weapon when you scrap one, while you have a chance to learn how to make a modification that the weapon doesn't even have?
---
2) How do you get lead by scrapping pencils?
---
3) Why do mutation serums work even if you have the starched genes perk equipped?
---
It's you! Do you turn off the radio's to?
---
Can we keep computer games non political. I play games to have fun not to have every day real life issues thrust in my face
---
Seriously? Haven't seen that before, guess I'll be heading back..
---

I really like the lmg.  I have a  1 star bloodied that shreds things. It eats 308 like crazy though.
---
“Have I been banned”
---
Just a little FYI before you go purchase Fallout 1st just for the scrap box.
---
I have had 1st for 3 months and I play at least 6 hours everyday and I will tell you now even with days of  dedicated farming for acid and lead for the first few weeks I am still only sitting on 2000 lead and 2000 acid ... not gonna last long if I stopped having Fallout 1st.
---
I still plow through most scrap daily that I have stored like steel and adhesive and really only have stupid high reserves of things like bone and asbestos.
---
I mean if you intend to not play the game at all like no SQB or events or farming runs and just farmed junk for a whole month Then maybe just maybe you will have enough scrap to last maybe 1 or 2 months.
---
Conclussion : 1st is not worth  buying just for the scrap box. 
---
Now if you like to spend Atoms and would spend at least 1000 atoms a month using cash then Fallout 1st is perfect and the rest of the stuff like the survival tent and junk box are just cool extras.
---
And it's like crack once you have this extra crap it's tough to give it up and just give in and pay the 14.99 extra a month.
---
Is your mic enabled? When I had this problem it turned out I'd accidentally left my mic on while running audio through my speakers.
---
Holy hell, the "snap" was a fix to how bad it was in the beginning.
---
No way do I want to go back.
---
No.  No more agendas in my  games.
---
And how much repairs does that damned letterbox need at the foundation? They been fixing it for months!!
---
Never had a problem putting wallpaper on windowed walls...
---
Hear hear.
---
AND more information in the loading screen so people actually know how to do the event.
---
We have enough problems
---
Y'all a hunch of passive aggressive cunts don't go on Reddit if you don't like what you see
---
I'd love for them to come back if we got 100% XP for the kills.
---
Ahahahaha I hadn't thought about that guy for a while. I was watching the nightly news in Huntsville when it originally aired. I just sat there laughing
---
Nah, let the hate flow through you....
---
I used to mainly use an instigating .50 sniper rifle, but switched to commando as I happened on a bloodied combat rifle and an instigating fixer.
---
I still use the .50 if I want to take my time or I'm low on .45 though. I keep an AA gat plasma for queen fights if I'm low. 
---
Currently looking for an instigating Lever to compare to the .50 with it's piercing mag.
---
Didn't realise people wanting to be treated as human beings was a political agenda  **¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**
---
Pain Train can kill ghouls, but the fists aren't going to do any damage.
---
I like fallout 4
---
I hope they make public teams where you can randomly join a team or ask someone who’s also looking for a team join your team as well. That would be a major improvement for the game and will keep my locked in the game even more, cause playing Solo kind of sucks.
---
How is it a political agenda?
---
Oh wow, great tip - gonna have to try this.

U have to go to the 4th floor of the FD and enter into the last room (on ur left) of opposite side. Then locate the only terminal in the room. Once u activate the terminal choose the first option (last wish for 099-01) or smth like this. The quest will be activated by closing the terminal. So do it and go to find a SB. Hunt her down but u will need her corpse in a safe area to not have problem with fast trtavel. Sometimes fo76 doesnt let u to do it bcz of enemies arround. Collect her DNA and go to the UVT. There u have to go straight forward and then turn right down the hall. Choose the second door on ur right, Put her DNA in some sort of machine and then access the terminal to start an experiment and finish the quest. Then ft to FD and start all over again but u gotta go to the same location where is the corpse of ur previous victim to collect her DNA again. I used my survival tent to do just a few ft. I suppose u can collect DNA from any SB. I never tried from the one next to the Crater but definetly i did from the static corpse into  the glassed cavern.

As long as you don't place down your CAMP in a new spot, the next one you join where your space is available it will place it back down as normal. I've never had issues staying on a world where mine couldn't be placed.
---
Hahahahah your awesome
---
I'M NOT YOUR KID BUDDY!
---
11 of us.
---
What kind of bones are you cutting through that you need an effing water cooled saw for?
---
Doing alright. Glad to see you are  well! Have a good day.
---
11pm Manila time.
---
How are gay people existing political? Also fallout is inherently political. Maybe you should just pay attention.
---
I'd suggest they were wrong, and ask them to give it a shot. It's not exactly expensive to pick up a copy and base whether they like the game or not on personal experience rather than hearsay.
---
Indeed!
---
I used to love wading into the ghoul horde in the Whitespring Golf Clubhouse (remember when they used to swarm) with my 200% repaired chainsaw and getting medieval...good times!
---
Well, all the cosmetics and camp items should be account wide (like atom store) but I would imagine consumables such as caps / lunchboxes / lunchboxes / gold bullion...) will have to be assigned to one specific character.
---
I liked it enough, but I don’t think that is a good argument to convince him haha
---
[my freind with a lvl 150 explosive user along with heavy guns lime the .50 mg helped me create this build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f393f38&amp;d=sf2sq2s32sr2ib4ip2s22a72pq1pj0ck0l71eh2ee2id1ic2lu2lt2cu0ek1i11&amp;w=pa0p80p90c62i30ia0i50&amp;m=63ef92c)
---
I'm pretty sure that's more along the lines of you can't place other atom shop purchases at teammates camps either. I more meant will I be stuck if I move my own camp/ store the scrap box and not be able to place it again.
---
But there are 1000 people over there D:
---
I had a group try to do this to me the other day.  I logged as I heard the grenade click noise.  Was a close one.
---
I mean, any quest can be simplified down to a "kill this or collect this type quest".
---
I could dumb down the most complex RPG quest ever and with a simple explanation and make it sound like busy work.
---
Hell no, I'd rather Beth would bring out international flags before this happens.
---
Unpopular opinion, but minorities are minorities for a reason and they don't need to be catered for in games.
---
Absolutely fantastic!
---
True. I guess your best bet ya to wait for a free trial weekend and let him play it. That way he can try it without it costing him anything
---
Yeah that made it the most sense to me, so that’s what I tried. However, it didn’t work, so that’s why I made this post. Thanks, though!
---
No real life agendas should be portrayed in games where it's not necessary. Pay attention? Fallouts timeline doesnt follow that of real life so it being inherently political as you say isnt correct in relation to real life is it?
---
It's the same agenda: how do they make money? -&gt; what would be popular? -&gt; [insert popular topical item here]
---
be25hm until I get The Fixer with the same attribs.
---
My discord group tested this out and storing or scrapping the ally bench works.
---
Lol yea it’s a great weapon
---
This is pretty nice. I think im looking to be more explosives specific. I am making him as a trollish RP character just to always use explosives. I want to carry Orbital Strike Beacons or Dynamite that I drop with Last Laugh.
---
the trick is, there are two cave crickets that spawn near the owlet. most people, myself included, didnt manage to get its meat. 
---
so if you get it, it fetch some nice caps.
---
I love the fight. And it's really the only time I use orbital strike grenades... And nuka grenades. To clear the adds
---
Why do you care if your friend doesn’t play a game that you don’t even play? Kind of a weird question. Anyway, there are dozens of threads and videos about the current state of FO76 and WL.
---
I mean I get that people want to play when they want and so only have a limited  window to play but there usually not down long.  But does anyone else think it's funny when people say " why dont they do updates at night when no ones on" hahahhaha people are so stupid they dont understand time zones I guess
---
the game has been around 20-30 bucks for a while now (unless you're on pc, then its locked at 40) and they have added loads of quests in the past year and a half, all with free updates.
---
if your friend isn't willing to give the game a chance even just to screw around and have fun with a friend, then he's probably too stubborn to ever give it a shot. i woyld write him off and just try to make new friends in-game.
---
also, many queats in 3 and NV can be boiled down to busywork "kill/collect this" objectives. i never understood that argument regarding 76 just because you didnt have an option of saying something to an npc beforehand.
---
How is adding a rainbow asylum dress to the store "existing"?
---
It would be hilarious if it gets patched today.
---
I treat human beings the same regardless of race, creed, or sexual preferences.  If one group gets a gaudy asylum dress skin then EVERYONE should get one.  And this is ridiculous so no one group deserves one over the other because of their gender identity or sexual preference.
---
if they did not like 4 I would be suprised they would like 76. not that it's impossible, im sure there are people like that but just unlikey.
---
Because I would like to play it, and he is in my core video game friend group.
---
Lol then snark is palpable
---
farwell my friend
---
And totally not needed when using unyielding.
---
Id say your buildis good but id get rid of good doggy, aqua boy/girl and hard bargin unless does are part of the role play somehow
---
Hell no. Free is always better. BUT that doesn’t change the fact that i would still pay for it. If we’re talking QOL i’d rather have vats workin all the time
---
Exactly. If people came on here asking for a heterosexual outfit we would get ridiculed. Leave games to be played for fun not to spread messages
---
Lever is my favorite gun in the game but it sucks that it can’t really match something like a handmade for killing power. Semi auto rifles should be stronger.
---
More or less because I didnt know what to fill with. What would you replace with? Should I get more STR or END or anything?
---
Yes that’s pretty much how it will work. Assume you’re not on PC/PTS?
---
Lemme re-write ur post:
---
'WHITE POWER!'
---
You too!
---
Don't worry they don't bite unless they get the scorched plague
---
Everyone would get it, dumbass.
---
Good to know.  Thanks for posting
---
&gt;	Assume you’re not on PC/PTS?
---
I don’t understand what you mean?
---
Easily said when you've got nothing to lose.
---
If you don't have an ally nothing happens.  When it happened to a friend he stored his ally bench the damage stopped.  Then the griefers went to my alts camp who never has had an ally, to try the same thing.  Nothing happened other than they wasted their time.  They did end up giving my alt 10k caps, I think in hopes of maxing him out
---
Just did it thrise, it actually works. Just jumped between a fissure sight, the university and fd and repeat, works like a charm.
---
Wonder if this is meant to happen, or an oversight? Either way I can't believe this hasn't been discovered or brought up earlier.
---
If you’re on PC you can access the Private Test Server (which isn’t private anymore).. they’ve had the team’s functionality on there for the last 2 months or so, so you could try it out.
---
Exactly this. If I spent time grinding to make cranberry relish, I should be able to make a few caps from them.
---
Sound like you might need to stray from the pack. Others shouldn't 100% influence what games you play. 
---
It's the if they jump off a bridge thing.
---
U r welcome. Try a static corpse to collect DNA. Maybe it will work same way but my idea was to spend less caps.
---
" Who designed this game, Todd Howard?? "
---
No he's a glorified mouthpiece that whispers sweet not-so-little lies. If he had designed it your PC would have exploded after the installation completed.
---
No problem, I'm newish to reddit but this is what our group does, pass information along.
---
i turn off radios, lights, flick switches back and forth... 
---
i even drop a nuke mine every now and then
---
Where are the fusion cores?
---
So, you may be misinterpreting what I mean here.
---
I feel public groups are good (that's what I'm assuming you're commenting on?).
---
However, I do not think they'll make challenges like "take a photo with a group", or "revive an ally" any easier for solo players.
---
Id personally replace them with 3 star first aid and 2 star action boy/girl
---
What's your problem? Nothing racist being said. Games have no place to spread real life agendas. Weher that's about gay pride or BLM, leave that for the real world so we can enjoy the game
---
I AIN’T YOUR BUDDY, KID!
---
Are you talking to cam2910?
---
Oh okay no I’m on PS4, well just kind of started on there from playing it on Xbox for a while. So public team is what I think it is correct?
---
Not sure that applies here.
---
Meta build that can one shot her in the face here.  I'd love this cause when I ask on the coms "Do y'all have your damage in" they could give me a clean answer.
---
But yeah, I know there's way too many assholes out there that would abuse this. Now if she would drop regardless of damage done to her that wouldn't be a real problem.
---
Some you want agendas in games then that people dont want thrust in their face
---
I meant like every single group should get their own style of dress lol.
---
Put on dual bar and flamer. Only thing I use from level 20-50, more than powerful enough to clear the whitesprings, kill mirelurk queens and is actually not the worst against sbq.
---
To box a deathclaw?
---
But, like... That's kind of my point. I'm never going to use a boxing glove... So why force me to use one, and then hunt down 100 radtoads?
---
#I AIN'T YOUR KID, PAL!
---
If you play games to keep away from 'politics' then playing a Fallout game is definitely the wrong choice for you.
---
I got exactly six at bog town too - one a legendary. It was absolutely nuts. My girlfriend and I got on a roof and just unloaded on them as we dodged rocks. We were laughing so hard by the end of it. We miscounted and jumped down only to find one of them still alive (fortunately with low health), and after the scare, we were laughing even harder
---
As a militaristic savage, my camp is literally just stashes, crafting benches, water purifier, generator, and a circle of 10 turrets.
---
They do in fact kill everything. Including for some reason the occasional neutral npc like the Op mentioned.
---
Turrets have an odd activation delay, and have trouble hitting things at close range, but a cluster of turrets can mutually support one another and will shred any unfriendly souls that happen along when im crafting ammo or whatnot.
---
dont just go to 1 or 2 locations.. go to many.. and pick up lots of stuff..
---
there are spawn rules other than elapsed time
---
i just hope that it works as intended and they actually can’t mess with my camp n stuff when they patch it in. guess it’s been tested in the PTS but what does that even mean sometimes.
---
Ah yes I'm a heterosexual male so I have 0 hardships in my life I'm so privileged I've never had any adversity gosh I feel soooo guilty now xD
---
How is it when Fallouts politics are not the same as real life politics moron. That's why it's called a game. What's the fallout lore around Gay Pride or BLM??
---
Pretty much. It’s covered in a few of the ITVs and stuff
---
What about buying it on Steam, trying it out and refunding if it's not to their taste? :)
---
&gt;No real life agendas should be portrayed in games where it's not necessary. Pay attention? Fallouts timeline doesnt follow that of real life so it being inherently political as you say isnt correct in relation to real life is it?
---
Being gay isnt an agenda, by that logic you could say that he game is filled with the real life agenda of being straight.
---
There are a fair number of side quests, my personal favourite it the Mistress of Mystery questline
---
There are also a few unmarked quests for collectables, like the nuka cola power armour paints
---
I found the quests, the base game and wastelanders, were very enjoyable as long as you pay attention, and honestly the base games main quest was a mastery of environmental storytelling, I haven't redone it since wastelanders but I guess there are NPCs in those quests now as well
---
There is also a lot of lore in the game, and I mean a looot, but again you have to pay attention
---
There are some basic go here collect this quests, but there are also a lot of real quests, and personally I think 76 is an absolutely amazing game
---
If you and/or your friend do start playing the community on here is pretty awesome, most people are always willing to help out, it's one of if not the best online community I've ever been a part of
---
Kind of unrelated but there's also a lot of content coming this year, you can check out the roadmap on fallout.com
---
A few highlights are 
---
Legendary perks (currently being worked on, the community wasn't happy with the originally planned ones so they're reworking them)
---
One Wasteland (enemies around the world scale to your level to A) allow people more freedom in their activities and B) to prevent overleveled enemies causing problems for new players)
---
The Brotherhood of Steel is coming to Appalachia this autumn in Steel Dawn, a free (I think minor but not sure) Dlc, followed by the Fractured Steel (I think this will be a big one) this winter
---
And as a bonus, all Dlc is 100% free forever after buying the game
---
I spent the 10 minutes bashing robots in the silo - I'll do with my nuke and summoned queen as I please.
---
I prefer to share, but I am going to melt her after she regenerates so I can move on to the next nuke.
---
Look up Angry Turtle on YouTube. He’s got an entire video on how location respawns work. 
---
Very informative.
---
Just hop servers a few times and you should be goods. Offices with desk fans and typewriters are food for screws, as well as globes and hot plates.
---
The problem is that you can't say 'minorities are minorities for a reason' and expect no response, it is a statement that denigrates a person based off of their race. Therefore, racist. Can you read? Do I need to simplify this for you further?
---
my bloodied power fist with unyielding does 2,400 damage at only 10 STR points.   
---
So yeah, beats any PA set I have.
---
Thanks for the info, I’m gonna do this to everyone overpricing their stuff in vendors.
---
^(I AIN'T YOU PAL, FRIEND!)
---
Thats a lot of words when 'I'm a homophobe' would have been shorter and just as accurate.
---
You've been told wrong.
---
Check this post - explains how looting works and where to find a lot of stuff. I don't think it's been updated since Wastelanders, but most of the list is still valid.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c9njxj/where_to_farm_all_the_things/
---
Have you done this more than once? I've had the "Thrill of the Grill" and "Play Time" daily quests glitch out and let me repeat as much as I want but never "Heart of the Enemy." I've been to Fort Defiance plenty of times too, where in/what exactly at Fort Defiance were you doing to get the quest to start again?
---
Oh sorry. Let me rephrase it. No real life issues ( I'll say issue because gay people think they are unfairly treated) should be forced upon people in a game
---
you do not have to get the bug parts from the highlighted locations.. 
---
just go loot supermutant meat bags at huntersville.. you should be able to get almost all the required parts there...
---
That’s awesome, it kind of sucked looking for random people to join a team. At least on PS4 is harder than Xbox where you ask someone to join a team and they sometimes just join. So I’m happy about the public servers.
---
I just meant that going there and starting to look for friends is kinda the same to looking for friends here or on the official fallout discord :)
---
They at least fixed a common exploit that could make you immune to your own explosives, but, instead of addressing the explosive issue, they added more explosive weapons.
---
i dont see a good reason to do that,
---
i personally loved fallout3 and new vegas, i absolutely agree with most criticism about fallout4 and fallout76, despite enjoying those games and spending hundreds of hours in them
---
i had to accept that fallout76 is not a typical fallout game and now enjoy it for what it is.
---
Imo your friend is right about what he is saying, in all of fallout76 there is like 3 sidequests that to me actually felt like sidequests and funnily enough those where from vanilla76 before wastelanders, the lying lowe quest, the mistress of mystery quest and the one were you are helping the miss nanny in the wavy willard water park
---
the mainstory was allright and feels even a bit better now with wastelanders, but its just one questline with very little choices except for dialogue options which are definitely a great thing but ultimately didnt make me feel like i was playing a different questline on the second or third character
---
that feeling of wandering around and suddenly getting to interact with someone or something, leading to a chain of events that end in a good twist or, reward you with some item or knowledge just isnt there for me
---
i like fallout76 for its very well done map and its combat
---
upgrading my characters by tweaking my build or grinding legendaries is fun for me
---
and thats about it
---
long story short,
---
i am a very active fallout76 player and i love the game but questing is not the appeal of this game
---
every friend who would ask me if the game is worth getting for its quests
---
id answer with no
---
It's really sad when you go into the Whitespring and robots just die as you walk by. Kinda makes you feel bad lol
---
I'm with you. Heterosexual men are all privileged. Utter crap
---
It’s not my best work, but thanks 🙏
---
I love playing with a Lever! My absolute favorite! I have a Quad/33/15.
---
But I‘m looking for a BER Lever as I switched to a berserker build. Still had no luck. Can‘t find any for caps and it seems my trades aren‘t good enough.
---
It doesn't sound like it was around for too long. The Sacrificial Blade and Scorched Killer's Receiver adding a star was changed even before Fixers and things existed.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yj155/legendary\_weapon\_mods\_scorched\_killers\_receiver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yj155/legendary_weapon_mods_scorched_killers_receiver/)
---
The link above shows a Hunting Rifle being legendary and that was prior to those rifles even being in the legendary loot pool. Imagine now with the purveyor that you could create 1\*'s to sell? Even worse 5\* weapon to script? If a 2\* is worth 15, 3\* is 40, what the heck would a 4 &amp; 5 star go for?!?
---
Wooooot!
---
Thanks for this, I aways thought I had to go onto the next server or my camp would be disassembled
---
Instigating .50 Hunting/Sniper Rifles.. Furious Levers and Handmades...
---
Fixer if I can find a good one
---
Always look for a suitcase or container that read 0/0 for wt.  Never drop it in a bag.
---
So life should only cater to the majority or the norm? Other people can just beat it and accept that they wont be represented? Then for example when Latinos surpass white population in US, They should just be catered to and no longer the whites? How does that make a productive world where everyone can be themselves?
---
cool. I'll friend you &amp; look for a lvl 72, then we both can get it someplace easy
---
That's because the LGBTQ+ community IS unfairly treated. Literally the only people who complain it and say it's 'political' are the people that want to keep it that way.
---
^^^I ^^^AIN'T ^^^YOUR ^^^FRIEND, ^^^CHIEF!
---
Fans, typewritters, lighters, Giddy Up Buttercup body. 
---
I think that's correct.
---
[Full list.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Screw_(Fallout_76))
---
So picture this.. when placing your CAMP, you either select "Standard" or "Camp Lot", with the Camp Lot allocation being a square/rectangular area covering the same (or less 🤷‍♂️) area² than the standard camp build radius. You build your camp, in this rectangular lot as you would normally, but upon reentering a world it is placed in a Camp Lot. 
---
Think of this like a parking spot in a large parking lot, or like an organised caravan park. If you opt in, then upon joining a world your camp is placed in any of the vacant lots in a kind of.. Settler shanty town! Join a world, your camp slots in, and you are right in the centre of a new township made by survivors of the wasteland banding together for mutually beneficial trade and commerce.
---
Imagine no longer having to fast travel and risk being hit with the infamous Infinite Load Screen only to end up at a camp selling common Fasnacht masks and a plan for a damn Chemistry Bench. Imagine being able to simply walk to the camp next door to continue your shopping spree. Imagine signs being useful as more than just pointless decoration! Walk down the strip and look for the signs for what you're after, and stop in for a bit of a browse 😍
---
In a post-apocalyptic survival scenario, the survivors would band together for survival, trade, commerce, and the hope of prosperity. *Especially* if you all theoretically spent **years** living confined to a vault together! You wouldn't run away and and build a McMansion in the middle of nowhere! Now I'm not expecting the New Vegas Strip here.. Just mutually beneficial cohabitation!
---
I think this adequately tackles the demand for a central trade hub *and* a common hangout spot to meet other players - especially with the upcoming Public Teams. I also think that rather than having an "Auction House" or something like that, this allows the possibility of easy trade without losing the fun of all the visitors coming to explore your camp.
---
Vampire switchblade and ghoul slayers FSS switchblade are my primary weapons.
---
Switch off to others depending on the area/enemy.
---
T-65 is trash, just get the SH PA.
---
***I AIN'T YOUR CHIEF, GUY!***
---
So someone who doesnt want a particular issue put in games so they can enjoy the game is a homophobe.
---
Does that make you anti heterosexual then as I want an outfit in the game that says I love heterosexuals.
---
Hell Faschnuat made the servers lag so much that daily quests wouldn't even update with markers. adding the vault raids back will probably make it as unstable. I would like for them to at least open them up so that we can explore the vaults and get a jumpsuit
---
Thanks, I doubt it's intended.
---
Don't know if i should tag cursed subreddit, or sad subreddit...
---
There’s a back entrance through a flooded mine and a dead diver. I thought I found something new then it took me back to this place. Love this location! But I was like oh this place again haha.
---
It is literally a crime to be homosexual in many countries around the world. Today. You can be executed for it. What fucking planet do you live on mate?
---
the answer for screws can be found within assaultron heads
---
Handmade and Railway.
---
I only thought there was 4 at first until I turned around and seen another two charging towards me lol
---
I'm straight so try again :)
---
Why would LGBTQ+ representation stop you enjoying the game?
---
You said it first, champ. Funny how you all out yourselves in one way or another. Cheers!
---
So much 14 lol those things hurt meh.. make it cry
---
Yes. It is a explosive shotgun.
---
Wrong they are a protected minority. I wouldn't be allowed to prance through the streets of london holding an annual heterosexual pride would I even if I feel unfairly treated. Bit discriminatory that heterosexuals are not allowed to do that
---
We are getting the Auto Axe from the Pitt soon, it’s a stand-alone weapon so it’ll be a better chainsaw from what I’ve seen
---
How has no one been able to train a SB to use it in battle? Imagine riding into a nuke zone on your SB!
---
Gotcha. I was a bit confused on what I should do because there’s no highlighted areas at all. It’s just pointing to Treadly to talk to him but it’s not doing anything else after. He’s like on repeat or something lol
---
Thank you.
---
I mean...doing 30 MPH over the speed limit is generally forbidden by most local law agencies. 
---
Anyway, the guy is right. New characters that are bound only to Survival, and legendary effects need to be disabled. PvP should be a measure of actual skill, not how fortunate you are with RNG.
---
Farming mole miners at the mine/factory is a good idea, just scrap everything they have and pick up all junk items or the eastern side of the made near the crashed plane there is a guaranteed sloth spawn which drops about 6 screws every 20 mins
---
So no more about the horrors of nuclear war in Fallout games then, ok.
---
Hey are servers down, I only get to play 30 seconds every day because my dog keeps dying and coming back to life. When will they be back on ? Heres my phone number 492- 638-6729
---
I actually was not
---
I’m a PA heavy build. I use the chainsaw for fun once in a while and it’ll take a couple seconds but it kills most enemies fairly quick. I have fun with it for sure!
---
If you enter it and follow the caves to the left and go underwater for a way oh, you will find an exit way over in the forest. I think it's called secret cave or something like that. It comes out right by a blood eagle camp near Summersville.
---
I know this is gonna sound pretty “bethesda apologist” but hear me out.
---
For people who actually do every daily and weekly, yes the atoms being reduced is fudging unforgivable i’ll say that.
---
As somebody who doesn’t really **mostly** go out their way to do the dailies n weeklys, 1500 from a battlepass system that is meant to be levelled up by just playing the game, **and** a bunch of cosmetics, icons, emotes, general game stuff is pretty good considering like I say, it’ll be earned without having to focus on it too much *hopefully*. But ye, just my take on it without looking at the rewards but maybe i’ll have a different tune when I look at the rewards and their all player icons or scrap bundles. Let’s see how it’s implemented before we go either way positive or negative I suppose :)
---
Truly, the new Responder faction is off to a strong start.
---
One friendly woman and her dog who do nothing but hang out in the ruined shell of a Flatwoods diner. One wannabe Firebreather who cant pass the 7-question exam despite the fact that all of the answers are literally lying around on the shelves around her.
---
Aaaand one mouldering corpse.
---
T51 and rad x diluted. It's completely not worth it for that grind. I used to only use pa and I just switched to playing in normal armor and it is so much more fun. I wish pa wasn't pure crap cause I've been in love with it since fo3 and you couldn't get me out of that tin can lol. It is your reward for your grind but in all honesty I wouldn't bother if it was my choice again
---
It says you replied to them 2 hours after they did.
---
No one said heterosexuals don't have hardships, the difference is that you don't face hardships BECAUSE you're heterosexual.
---
And in some countries it's a crime to have sex before marriage which is a crime against heterosexuals.
---
That doesn't stop them facing constant abuse. Being gay is also illegal and punishable by death in a number of counteries. The only people that want hetrosexual pride are homophobes.
---
I can one shot most everything in the game with my instigating lever, larger creatures sometimes take 2-4 shots. So not too unhappy. It's when I go against the larger creatures I need something fully automatic.
---
Yes, all Gauss weapons benefit from demo expert since the Wastelander update.
---
The game is called Fallout.  I don't think that's too far of a stretch.
---
Will know when we know for sure. I'm certain numerous players will have mini reviews as to how this all works. YouTube is going to be flooded with videos.
---
I had a fog crawler hoard spawn inside a building, all stuck in random floors and stairs.
---
character isn't the only thing deleted yo
---
Didn’t the trump administration recently try to make it legal to discriminate against trans people?
---
Every single time 😶
---
I started doing this and 99 times out of a hundred it’s some shit shack who’s build circle looks like it’s completely outside of my build circle and then i angrily shuffle to a new server lol
---
I thought you didn't want agendas in your games though? 'Nukes are bad' is am agenda. There shouldn't be anything nuke related in games.
---
Someone dupped them
---
Lol
---
You got a good one on your hands, take good care of her.
---
That'd be like having a parade on a regular day mate. This is to celebrate something. You only feel discriminated against because it doesn't celebrate 'you'. And by the comments you're making, you won't be celebrated until you've fallen off this mortal coil.
---
In 2020 every corporation and business and many political groups are bending over backwards to accommodate the LGBT community.  You cannot even generalize and say anymore they are unfairly treated.  Some people of every group every day are "unfairly treated".
---
How is wanting a heterosexual pride being homophobic? Are you saying heterosexuals are not treated unfairly anywhere? Apparently by what your saying only a heterosexual can discriminate against a homosexual but not the other way around
---
I found the scientists at that last Farm Northwest of Grafton.
---
I've seen it happen enough times... she starts the landing animation, staggers, and then keeps flying around for another few minutes
---
it has a decent total if you account for rad resistance. which most people ignore, even bloodied builds for some reason. but no, it can't compete with scout or heavy combat.
---
and even with rad resistance I'd still argue that only the chest is good.
---
It depends what they didn’t like about fallout 4. If they didn’t like the combat, I don’t know if they would like 76. If they didn’t like art design, they may not like 76. 
---
The game clearly has quests. I will say that the new companion quests (particularly Sofia) are very much “kill this”, “collect that”. They do bring you to some pretty cool dungeons though. I think the wastelanders content overall is pretty great though. 
---
If they like exploring, reading and listening to lore, crafting, killing enemies, leveling up then it is certainly an enjoyable game. Story isn’t amazing but the gameplay is fun.
---
I couldnt care if your straight or gay. It wouldn't stop me enjoying the game  what I'm saying is these problems should be left to the real world. Dont publicise things in games.
---
Nice work
---
No, that's a crime against the non-religious, because those laws are born out of religion. You're gonna lose the next time you open your mouth too mate... so... yeah just stop.
---
The amount of.. questionable replies to this thread that don't understand this is depressing.
---
Good, as they should be, because the LGBTQ+ community is still discriminated against every day in all parts of the world.
---
Again, the only people who are complaining about 'agendas' and 'politics' are homophobes, otherwise inclusivity and acceptance wouldn't be a problem for you. I'm guessing you're upset about the Antifa agenda of the Wulfenstien games too?
---
Now I wish Seasons added a Behemoth Horde
---
"easily said when you got nothing to lose" sounds like that.  But ok i'll play along.   
---
 Great.  I don't want items added to the store to reflect the struggles I have gone through in my life either.  I have very strong beliefs about certain things and am very active in animal rights.  I wouldn't ask for something added to the store to bring awareness to animal cruelty because it's a game and activism doesn't belong there... Do you see what I'm getting at?
---
It says 1 hour and that is due to the way Reddit rounds. Wait a little bit and it will say we both posted the same amount of hours ago.
---
so how do their superheated lasers transmit diseases?
---
Yup whenever I do SBQ runs on privates I always ask my group if they have the dmg in when she lands. Limb dmg gauss shotguns are no joke lol
---
I did a one punch build, mainly because I had a instigating knuckle lying around. Used a bloodied build to get high strength and the melee mutations. I know sneaking is the opposite of what you want tot do. But when sneaking I was able to smash just about anything in one hit. Fun times.
---
straight up this comment sucks and your take is horrible. “minorities are minorities for a reason”
---
TL;DR:
---
Guy camps north of fissure prime and is crying because he got nuked.
---
I'd say my main goto weapon lately has been my stub junkies explosive 10mm smg 
---
It's not a subtle weapon, excels at close to mid range but because of the explosive element it can be used at long range (think it's a bug but being shhh about it lol)
---
This thing rips through most enemies with ease and combined with adrenaline perk is good at crowd control
---
That'd be awesome
---
It'd better be not a stinky-pinky challenge!
---
Oddly passive aggressive in delivery, even for humor, but good of you to remind people.
---
Ok, no more of the anti-nuke agenda allowed in Fallout games then.
---
Racism card is thrown around way too much. Are people not allowed to express an opinion anymore without risk of offending. What a bunch of soft people society has become really
---
Right!? Bethesda’s logic is whack 🤣
---
If BGS adds a rainbow dress in the game, it's a rainbow dress. The fact you want to interpret it as some agenda driven item only reflects your personal views of it.
---
It doesn't harm you in any way if there is any LGBTQ+esque  items in the game. Unless you're a bigot.
---
Thanks for outing yourself, cheers! We thank you.
---
Because it's like wanting a blue shell when you are in first place on Mario Kart, you don't need it because you're already in the lead.
---
5pm Moscow
---
Enclave Bunker &amp; Shady Grove are great for screws (and springs).
---
And being gay is a crime against certain religions
---
I have never even played those games.
---
This is where the disconnect is and you don't even realize it.
---
"Anyone who disagrees with us is a homophope!!!"
---
The fact that people cannot understand that someone can disagree without being a "ist" or a "phobe" is where you lose all of us centrists.
---
Thanks for taking out the time to write this up. This was very helpful.
---
I do not believe it does, i have seen him numerous times and at various levels on chars with only 1-3 luck.
---
The flatwoods monster likes mountain cliffs in the forest areas that overlook towns or other points of interest. He has a very distinct audio cue that can be heard from a ways off. And for obvious reasons hes easiest to find at night.
---
My question is what determines whether or not you can fight him. Ive encountered him maybe 6 times now in the two weeks ive been playing and ive tried to kill him every time. Only once did he actually stay and fight me. Every other time he just teleports off. I was hoping for some cool quest stuff, but all he dropped was a plasma pistol and some ammo.
---
This spreadsheet is amazing, thank you so much!! :)
---
Lol. Thanks for outing yourself mate! Cheers!
---
Junkies explosive gatling plasma and a vampire faster fire rate, faster reload flamer as a side arm (and a godmode to tge Encrypted event). And an instigating power attack reduced weight sheepsquatch staff as a ghoulwhacker.
---
Wanna see a pic of my phone case?
---
because 76 is actually a simulation vault. we are all trapped in pods like tranquility lane. we are supposed to test the system and find any bugs in the program so that the robo-brains can fix them later. this is why we are always on the same day and we can only advance in time on their whim and not ours
---
We are told we must live in an all accepting society where you must not say something for fear of offending someone else so what's good for one group of people to do has to be good for the other groups of people to do also.
---
Very insightful. I appreciate a view from the opposite angle. You may very well be right in that it just isn’t for him after all.
---
yeah. i got a bloody faster fire rate lever yesterday and it hits like a TRUCK but the firerate of a commando gun still wins i think
---
Quad Handmade "Problem Solver" FFR FR - general purpose weapon

Only three weapons I carry - all I need for all occasions.
---
Are they bad?  We have to drop nukes in order to save humanity.  Maybe shit isn't as white and black as yall like to make it... lol
---
Anything is better than the prison run.
---
No problem :) I'm always happy to get more people playing, if you do end up playing, and if you're on Xbox, let me know and I'll give you some stims, water, materials etc to get you started
---
I hate going to the prison. Hate the hate it. Send me somewhere else
---
that job was personal
---
Oh well terribly sorry!
---
How many bloody gauss 3* shots out there 😭😭😭😭😭
---
TL;DR: Use your imagination, it makes the game more fun. 
---
Here is the thing with fallout 76: you have to inspire yourself! You have to really think about who you want to be in the wasteland moreso then ever in the past. Yes there are quests, yes they are not the best. Though with the addition of wastelanders, you really get a good run of some nice content (real quests my friend, the goods) and some new random encounters across the wasteland which keeps things lively! 
---
Back to the inspiration! 
---
Let me give you an example: When I play the game I play as one of the unstoppables (I have one character for all 5 of them). I like to believe that after the bombs fell that they ended up being couped up in Vault 76 with the rest of the "best and brightest" due to there honorable service to the US during the war. 
---
They each use different styles of weapon and armor, wear different styles of casual and alter-ego outfits, and then have their own costumes! Each of them has a different backstory which explains why the act the way they do. You honestly gotta bring out your inner child and play some serious pretend. 
---
Here is the upside to all that: When you see other players in game and they hear you shouting battlecrys in your mic and swinging an axe down upon scorchebeasts while leaping through the air... they get interested and might join you. When a new player sees a guy dressed like a goofy aquaman come up and drop a bunch of purified water and ammo he never uses cause he punches people, they wanna keep playing. Or when a swarm fo Ghouls gets eradicated as from the shadows, falling to your feet, and the Silver shroud walks out from the trees and waves! They wave back. They wave back dude... it feels good. 
---
I cant convince anyway to do this, and some really just don't have it in them. But if you have always been about telling your own story then this is the game to do it in, theres a live audience this time. The ability to choose your role in the wasteland is almost infinite. Plus it's a beauty of a game in 4k.
---
It's supposed to go round in three. You did it wrong.
---
I would argue with that place being "a good factory" ;)
---
Did I say thanks for outing yourself? If I forgot, my bad. Thanks again.
---
I think for him, 4 lacked depth and immersion. It was repetitive - basically the typical things people didn’t like about 4.
---
Every item you have is already a "heterosexual outfit".
---
But that fact doesn't support your bs.
---
Fallout is a game it's not real life do you not understand that. If fallout had a back history on doing gay pride etc then fine but why should it just be added to a game to appease people
---
When you talk to him next time, check out how red his eyes are.
---
And literally everywhere you go in fo76 is littered with references to struggle between workers and bosses.
---
I think they meant in regard to not being lgbtq+, as in being heterosexual. Many lgbtq+ people also use games as an escape from reality and finding these small things that some games do to represent them makes them feel safer in that space. What's so bad about that, really?
---
Although I must say, what says we can't have things against animal cruelty added? I'd say thatt wouold be a pretty god thing of Bethesda if they actually made an effort to raise awareness of animal cruelty! I'd be thrilled about that, and it does in no way have to take away froom them raising awareness from soomething else either.
---
Sorry, we are PS4 folks. Thanks anyway though!
---
Yes no killing animals in fallout incase it offends
---
I totally agree the radiant quests were annoying. I think the repeatable content is better here imo.
---
I scanned the list and read every "operational" in Liberty Prime's voice. It was awesome.
---
Was it misleading to state it was second only to power armor?
---
The only people who disagree with LGBTQ+ representation are people that are against the LGBTQ+ community. 'Centerist' is just Right-Lite but ok.
---
Remove vats. Make the base damage crap but allow full damage with at least 3 perk cards dedicated. Problem solved.
---
Oh man.  Comments like this are why Trump is going to win again.  Thanks for ruining it for everyone.
---
well make up your own headcanon as to why you might encounter some players wearing rainbow clothes.
---
Sorry direct me to the item that says I love heterosexuals
---
Now that’s what I’m talking about!
---
Added: camp load out A, B, and C. You choose which camp module you want prior to loading in a server. If you want to place camp B later on it packs up camp A and continue building somewhere else. A huge quality of life change and addition for builders. I get tired of breaking camp to try something new. 
---
Removed:legendary scrip daily limits. All the new bullion plans need legendary modules. Locking me into 3 or 4 modules daily sucks and de-motivates people. Opening it up would be a great way to keep people grinding and a great cap sink for people selling legendaries.
---
Trade bug fix
---
best comment
---
yeah i convinced to friends so far to give 76 a chance and well they played for like 2 weeks but they got bored really quick
---
i tried to show them all the locations that made me enjoy the game and taken them with me to do some events but they just didnt change their mind after they tried it 😬
---
But anti-nuke is still am agenda. I thought you didn't want agendas in your video games? 
---
Having a Pride thing literally will do nothing to the game, the only people against it are people that are against the LGBTQ+ community
---
Ok Homophobe.
---
Hows that outing myself. I'm using your philosophy of sex before marriage is a religious crime and so is being gay. Dont know what to say?
---
Keep it in The Sims, My little pony, and that mobile game where you pretend to be good looking and have fake relationships.
---
Here, I prefer all of us to be 76’ers or wastelanders. Nothing better or extra special. 
---
Because thats equality right?
---
I'll start. Take a Group photo with 3 other players in front of a Wendigo Collusus and SBQ fight with everyone wearing Red Asylum uniforms.
---
same free gold iz good
---
Anything flannel.
---
I have some friends that are die hard fallout fans, but who won’t even give 76 a chance purely due to statements of badness from some you tubers when it first came out. Even though my wife and I can give them some objective experience to the contrary.
---
Lol same, they just kept showing up - first one showed up with some regular mutes, and we were like "get to the roof!" When  the second came, we were like "wow, I can't believe it, we're screwed!" I think the third and fourth came together, and that's when the laughing started. I don't think we even knew there were 6 until we counted bodies - I mean, they only have one skin and they're all running around us.
---
Broken record. Dont know what to say?
---
Ah yes. That would be bad! I tried the one month. It lapsed. I went about 3 days until I got a year 😣
---
Good to know. I wonder if you enjoying those locations had anything to do with randomly stumbling upon them yourself, which gave it an extra allure.
---
There was already pride stuff in the atomic shop... idk why people are freaking out over this..
---
Don’t need hacked or magic weapons to kill her in a few seconds tho.
---
says the person who has come into a topic that doesn't concern them to tell everyone how offended they are.
---
Find the water cooled bone saw
---
My current is a 3\* AA Fixer. Its fine. I like the build in dmg bonus, stealth bonuses etc... it gets me buy for most enemies and with adrenaline I start one shotting any enemy.
---
My favourite is using my 2\* instigating plasma rifle for sneak rifleman. Sneaking through a close quarters building, one shotting baddies into puddles of green goo is very satisfying.
---
Dont agree you must be a homophobe. What a moron
---
Take a picture of a naked player in a nuke zone fighting the SBQ and the collosus whilst a power armor user chews gum and leveld 3 times in a radstorm.
---
Something like that 😂
---
Craft a Fixer, Bear Arm, Gauss Shotgun, and Gauss Minigun.
---
And what fallout follows a different timeline to real life its created it's own in game history
---
If you reach neighborly reputation with the settlers you can buy the plan with bullion. Its 4k though
---
Yes, homophobes ARE morons. Recognising you are part of the problem is the first step to being part of the solution. Well done! Have a gold star 🌟
---
😂
---
That's my calling card if the prices in the vending machines are out of line.  One single spoiled item next to them.
---
I think it's safe to assume most Fallout fans have no interest in PvP. PvP people are a loud minority. 
---
More weapons, less RNG, legendary enemies should be removed and replaced with bosses or their health should be increased so that it takes a significant amount of time to kill them.
---
 That way everyone can get the legendary item. Right now, most players can easily one shot any legendary mob. I find myself playing on private server because there is 0 incentive to play on public with the current legendary mob situation. I deal 6.5k head shots to legendary ghouls, c'mon.
---
Fewer daily quests with increased rewards. That way veteran players don't have to spend an hour doing the same quests for the 200th time just so they can get 7 scrip. 4 dailies a day, 2 of them reputation dailies. 13 scrip each. That way you get 50 extra scrip each day.
---
Actual interesting items in the Atom shop, every week i see people complaining about the new atom shop content. It's either recycled stuff and new items that are not very interesting. I'm talking gun skins , Armour skins, emotes, weapon effects. You know, things that people would be interested in.
---
Remove the caps. Scrip limits, bulion limits, cap limits. That way there would be an actual trade system in-game. You have that perfect B2525 fixer, well put it up for 500,000 caps in your camp. Right now, people are selling chair plans for 25 caps and it's just pathetic. I have around 100 legendaries in my stash just for scrip. Why can't i just scrap them all at once? Why the measly 200 scrap limit. All plans should be trade-able. They should have a quests and level requirement instead. Finished wastelands and you're level 50? Cool, now you can buy any waste lander plan or item from players.
---
Interesting events every week, nothing ground breaking but maybe;
---
Extra 25 scrip when scrapping legendaries,
---
100% cap increased event
---
double bullion event
---
A type of mob has an increased chance to carry rare plans.
---
And so on. This would keep people stimulated between big updates.
---
But that's just my opinion. I'm sure someone will be like "BuT PvP iS GuT"
---
Ultracite .308 requires Fluorescent Flux, not Violet.
---
But it's a game with it's own history. Doesnt relate to real life.
---
I actually came across a non-quest one. You know how sometimes the bodies disappear but you can see the items on the ground? Water-Cooled Bone Saw and Osmosis Kit sitting on the ground.
---
Yes, quite a few times.
---
Not as bad as the near endless hoard of yau guai' s, faced 9-10 of them at middle mountain cabins once, they just kept spawning in.
---
Or the time me and a teammate fought off 6 scorchbeasts at once that brought gameplay to a crawl because of fps lag
---
No, there's nothing more to say - you've shown everyone who you are. Cheers.
---
:)))))
---
I been running for a good while without them, and haven't had any significant repairs to make. Maybe a few crops to repair. But, I don't camp at places with resources usually. One of my other characters had several turrets and it wound up they began attacking each other so frequently I just scrapped them all. If they're actually working for your camp that is awesome. So, you don't have any building, just stashes, benches, etc? What do mobs target when they come into your camp?
---
I think it could be a bit distasteful going with the asylum uniform, as homosexuality was deemed as a mental illness up until not too far ago. But some type of cosmetic could be a nice little addition!
---
"ALL LIVES MATTER!!!111"

'gAy pEoPlE aRnT iN fAlLoUt!1!1!1!' 😂😂😂
---
Again? Please go back to sleep mate. Everyone knows who you are now.
---
Hello fellow South African :)
---
You should stop. Your bigotry is showing, and it just makes you look like an ass.
---
Find a sloth,  kill it, server hop, repeat. 7+ screws each time.
---
So..... are the servers back up yet?
---
Oh yeah. Ah wel. I use a prime gatling AND prime MG. So i mixed them up. The math still stands. 5mm is even more
---
Oh I'm sure you would love that. Go collect fox meat..... before you kill it. Are you sure you want to kill this aninal it might offend you.
---
I was thinking that something like getting more, or cooked meat wouldn't be such a big buff as to give players who don't currently use energy weapons a dilemma, rather something that adds a bit more interest to weapon choices. Could certainly appeal to melee players who get more meat and then enjoy the STR buff that comes from eating it.
---
Had a player do this to me - planted them all over every workbench I had.  After the first one exploded I jumped servers - problem solved.
---
Just wish grievers would find something better to do with their time/life than make gaming difficult/miserable for others who are just looking to relax and have a good time.
---
Still no comeback. Thanks for putting yourself as an uneducated moron
---
You have a chance to get them as a reward for completing the mission.
---
win at PVP in Adventure...
---
Kill an owlet
---
This would also be a good idea.
---
SO MOVE
---
Oddly enough i encountered the venegful mothman yesterday right outside the Wayward on a brand new char i rolled.
---
Rolled char, went to wayward, logged into private server, turned around to head to oversser camp and there he was. Sitting up the hill a bit staring right at me with those scurry red eyes. It was daytime too. I have never seen it during the day before.
---
hey are the servers down and does anybody know how long it will last? it's a real bummer because I have really limited playtime and I was *LITERALLY* just about to get on for the first time in a long time.
---
inb4 locked thread
---
That'd be way to beneficial for players to be put in the game. Never-mind the fact that this could totally work by having players grind end-game materials to make these upgrades. Or add in an RNG system that may cause the weapon to break apart based on the amount of said materials (more materials = less chances of breakage). 
---
We can't have systems in place that will entice players to continue to play end-game content. Totally defeats the purpose of the mindless grinding and hording of materials you possibly rarely use.
---
Something lame like making all the alcoholic beverages or eating a Superduper Mart's worth of pre-war food.
---
Actually whilst this is a good fun thread, the new season-based grinding will be close to make-or-break for me. I've been getting a bit burnt out on the bullion grinding and RNJesus rewarding me with yet another Unyeilding Secret Service Left Leg when I roll. Plus with new games on the horizon (Ghost of Tsushima) it may be time for me to take either a break or take it down a few notches. There are one or two bits I'd like to obtain though. FOMA dilemma!
---
They'll take the same 20 minutes to do.
---
Kill a sheepsquatch will probably be the hardest.
---
I wanted to be doomguy, the double barreled shotgun rocks, wish I could say the same for the chainsaw.. :'(
---
Ooh bait me again! Bait me again! That one was so good!
---
That is in no way related to what I commented. At least TRY to keep a civil discussion insttead oof just going around to mock everyone.
---
Slight step-up. Cook Owlet Nuggets.
---
That's still true but will make the Assassins effect on armor useless, since Im trying to find an option where the market dosent suffer in a negative way
---
my game broke and an enemy dropped all the iteams they could steal and now i never have to go find the guy again
---
More than likely they were going to make it stronger and then nerfed it when rebalancing. Especially considering it's the best armor in Nuclear Winter. It probably also had something to do with PvP since Marine is good for PvP because of the rad resist since it will protect from things like Gamma Guns better.
---
I bet you were upset that you could romance same sex companions in Fallout 4 😂😂😂
---
but nowhere does it say that the fallout timeline is more or less homophobic than the real life timeline so unless we're saying that 'gay people don't exist in fallout' whether it fits with game history is a moot point, unless you, as many people seem to be suggesting, believe that the mere existence of LGBTQ people is a political issue.
---
I ain't ain't ain't ain't ain't, ain't!
---
Hey my dude. I've got 3 main characters I swap between, sided with the raiders on one, sided with the settlers on another, maxed out raider rep on two in total.  
---
My advice is this; Look up the top rep rewards for each faction and side with whoever has better endgame rep gear for you(gauss minigun/ammo generator for raiders, gauss shotgun/farming stuff for settlers).   
---
Also, it's worthwhile to do ALL the quests leading up to where the game literally tells you "you are siding with..." because you miss out on some cool unique stuff if you ignore one faction.  
---
imo: I like the raider rewards, base layout and team better. However, I do regret skipping the settler quests on my first playthrough though now :P
---
When I leave I always shut my doors, when I come back and they're open I know someone has visited my camp.  Although I always do, I just assume no one ever closes doors behind them.
---
It says a lot about when you see a suggestion for adding rainbow dress in game, and your immediate response is "keep gheys outts ma game".
---
I'm sure you can see how that looks to the rest of us.
---
Take a picture of the mothman controlled by the Flatwoods monster, riding the wendigo colossus while you shove yourself 3 packages bubblegum up your ass
---
Thought you said you would win 1-0 to me
---
In my opinion, there should be 7 that give 1 quest each, and reset weekly when the gold bullion resets. That way, you can complete them all at once, or do a few here and there throughout the week when you have time. It also reduces the monotony of doing the same exact quest every single day.
---
2-0
---
Be careful doing that. I lost several good guns using the container transfer method. After switching characters I wasnt able to log back into my server... i forget the exact message but it kept saying something like couldnt join world...
---
It just keeps going
---
Buy one month of Fallout 1st
---
All good :) 1 in 3 chance lol the response is usually I'm Pc/ps4
---
Agreed, remove vats.  Add dense to armor mods... something, please.   Explosives has made nuclear winter into a competition of who can use explosives faster and who finds a grenade launcher or vats a grenade first.  Instead of actual skill.   A lot of skilled players stopped playing because of this, and I can only imagine how discouraging it is to new players.
---
Sorry gotta chime in here.
---
Centrist is Right-Lite?
---
excuse me? So by this logic of yours...being a lefty is the only "right' way of thinking? Thats childish
---
Im sorry if all your political leanings are based around gender identity...theres a great deal of other issues more important than what you identify as at any given hour.
---
If i dont 100% agree with you...youd label me an automatic right winger? GTFOH
---
You need to grow up and meet people and understand youre allowed to have different thoughts on subjects.
---
If you think everything you believe in is right and the only way....then youre an ignorant extremist
---
....while in pacifist mode
---
Yep, and also to make it so that medical practitioners can refuse to treat LGBTQ+ people.
---
He might have done it as he was worried you were there to snipe him.  He didn’t hang for you to grieve and would assume you would return, so if he loved PVP he would have stayed for more.  Anyway, I never go near workshops for general junk looting as I can’t help but grab things and this can happen.  Like you I did it once and never a second time!
---
I can say what I want. If you cant tolerate a different opinion then dont comment
---
I'm with you here. If they didn't like 4 they probably won't like 76.  Many people who loved 4 gave 76 a shot and enjoy it, but I doubt the other way around.
---
ive had to remove all my camps turrets because a flatwoods monster spawns very close to my camp multiple times a day. mothman not as often but at least every 2 or 3 days.
---
Which isn't released until patch is live lol
---
pretty much, yeah. even if you account for totals, heavy combat and scout still come out on top.
---
......and they all need to be Two Shot Explosive, even the Bear Arm
---
Oh also, I've gotten 2 seperate copies for friends on Xbox for $15 Canadian each, with free shipping, so if check there first
---
The Place Anywhere mod for Fallout 4 has the ability to turn snapping on and off. There are times when you don't want snapping.
---
Also, the ability to just place objects.
---
cant you jsut do the event or hop around to locations which it spawns?
---
You shouldn't waste gold on T65 plans, while there's other stuff you want to buy still.
---
I'm still using my Strangler PA. Once you're so high up with DR/ER/RR, the only relevant stat is the set bonus from SH. A set bonus which was nerfed in to obsolescence. I can go hump a ghoul for a solid minute before the poison aura does enough damage to turn off Instigating.
---
Realistically speaking; T60, T51, X01, Ultracite, Strangler and T65 virtually have no differences in their performance. Going from 450 DR (T51/SH) to 560 DR (T65) maths out to something like 1% less damage taken. In almost every situation, that saves you less than 1 HP point.
---
Where in the hell did I say that?  Such a common tactic by the alt-left.  Twist and turn and misquote until they said something that allows you to call the a "ist" or a "phobe".  
---
You're a liar and a purveyor of misinformation.
---

They're gonna if everyone keeps spamming this info here, jfc this is the 5th time I've seen this in a few days.

Rolled a fresh char yesterday, left the vault and started down the stairs and theres a doggy bag on the ground with 19 super stimpacks in it.
---
I left them there for the next guy, but the effort is wholesome and appreciated.
---
The weapon/ armor skins did come from NW.
---
take a picture of a squirrel ... in a tree .. and a frog on a lilly pad
---
They're not from bodies (because they always spawn exactly at the same spots), they're world objects that spawn at specific locations. Sometimes a few of them at once.
---
Literally patting yourself on the back for bigotry. Yep, you win.
---
Cant have an animal rights agenda in a game that let's you slaughter animals. That's hypocrisy at its finest
---
Oh, I'm aware. It's just that placing items before they increased the "snapping" in 76 was much, **much** worse than it is now.
---
Because bigots gonna bigot.
---
Pre-Wastelanders I stood a fairly good chance of finding one after a bit of messing about with fast travelling or server hopping. But now? Snowball's chance in a fissure!
---
&gt;Wrong they are a protected minority. I wouldn't be allowed to prance through the streets of london holding an annual heterosexual pride would I even if I feel unfairly treated. Bit discriminatory that heterosexuals are not allowed to do that
---
There is so much to unpack here. You do realize it´s illegal to be gay in 70 countries. You do realize that LGBTQ youth has a suicide rate five times higher then their straight counterparts. Young LGBTQ people get bullied at a higher rate. And if you feel like you need heterosexual pride, just watch 99% of movies or shows, read 99% of books, go to a restaurant and see heterosexuals hold hands, kiss, hug without an eyebrow being lifted. Heterosexual pride is going on everyday.
---
If it's the same as mine the bug is very much appreciated.  For the last month as I approach Foundation the quest activates, I approach Ward, and his first line is "I see you've found out stuff" the quest completes.   I feel so lucky getting the rewards and rep without actually having to run down that shit for him..

This doesn’t seem like it is stickied

I have come to chew bubblegum and level up...and I'm all out of bubblegum.
---
Titles would be kinda cool like other MMOs.  But if this happens I want them to go back and retroactively give me titles for grinding my ass off in vault 94 since that was the only difficult group progression content we ever had.
---

Hey, that’s one I could actually complete!!
---
People are allowed to have different thoughts, and I'm allowed to think that anyone who isn't left wing is full of shit and needs a milkshake in their face :)
---
Maybe for some, but I want her dead as soon as possible to get my notes and launch the next nuke. I don't think it would change the behavior of players in general.
---
I was the first to comment here so who came in where??
---
Now this is an acceptable floating camp. Well done.
---
Welp... Let's see this get patched soon :/

#TODD HOWARD HAS ENTERED THE CHAT
---
While I know that this post is a tangent, bringing in the idea of scorch beast riding like dragon mounts, I’m loving the implications of it building off my comment on diseases :p
---
One of the four horsemen, riding into a nuke zone to spread the Blight to all players below while spawning an army of diseased gun zombies bitchslapping robots to make their lasers spread STDs.
---
Thats what i did last summer....
---
Exactly...childish.
---
This. I’ve been flung off mountains far too many times to trust anything on the ground in a camp.
---
Get a mutation.
---
how much gold for ea?
---
The free range event is your friend for this one.
---
Only place ive seen it is on the road near Pickets Fort.
---
Its a correct statement in regards to its implementation in NW.
---
And they’re all holding bloodied fixers
---
never thought about that but it definitely makes a difference i guess 
---
youre right
---
It would be nice for them to add more unmarked locations
---
Big Pat's on my back. Still not won have you
---
Haha, yes of course it should be retroactive.
---
And maybe long time players could get a special title like ;

---
Founder [Player Name]
---
I love this post so much, I want to marry it.
---
Just because it is possible to kill animals in the game doesn't make it so that they can't do something to fight against animal cruelty. I won't try to argue with you anymore as you're only gaslighting with your comments.
---
Freedom of speech does not equal from from consequences
---
i agree and the new space wallpapers would look cool as a roof skin👍
---
?
---
No. It’s easy. So easy. Lock Survival characters to survival only. That’s it. And they have to be made fresh, from level that. That way somebody with a full set of assassins doesn’t mean anything to anyone ever. Just like me having a TSE flamer won’t mean shit. Do you think I have fun using that in PvP? Fuck no. I don’t think *any* legendary effects are good for PvP. Luck with RNG is nowhere near the same thing as actual skill.
---
Same with me and I love it.  It's been about a month now and I really don't miss having to do the work to complete this mundane quest for rep.
---
*Chee-z I got yo' numba*

ya - i hate this. I wish the jets would work out of the nuka cola jetpack instead of the SS pack. And I wished the helmet worked as a breather - it does not from memory...

The scrap box is nice to have after the SBQ is dead, too many times that one Mirelurk King spawns and chases me down.  Now I run to the scrap box even before I collect off of her just in case he catches me off guard.
---
I see lots of good advice here already but you might take a look at this video, as it shows how you don’t need legendary weapons to be effective with a sneak build. 
---
https://youtu.be/VZwmW-xNXo8
---
I use a Lever Action rifle most of the time but switch to a Combat Rifle for any Scorchbeast or Sheepsquatch I find.
---
I like how this post just gets progressively more passive aggressive as it goes.
---
Yes, yes you are...I thought that was common knowledge no?
---
Since we're actually all sitting in virtual reality pods, it all makes sense.
---
Unless you use explosive weapons and have to chose between having fun and being alive :(
---
Bet you loved that
---
Didn't realise you were the first... so your eagerness to come in and tell the OP you were offended by their comment was greater than anyone else's eagerness to agree/disagree.
---
Like I pointed out. You complain about how people are so easy to offend but then can't wait to let everyone know when something offends you.
---
Scrap box is junk Only. It's just numbers in particular categories. Technically we could all have infinite junk. 
---
They fuck up when they have 3 million bloody fixers, junkie gauss miniguns, 5 million Christmas presents, plus all the other randomized shit they have to support as people jump servers, or whatever. They have to have computer power to run all that alone, plus whatever they support their end with the other game files.
---
I think that’s pretty much what I am dealing with right now.
---
You can use anyone's tent, you are not forced to only use your own.  So that is why as long as someone's is out I do not worry about it
---
It's not horrible. I have collected a full set of 4 pieces unyielding, 1 piece bolstering and all with reduced damage while blocking on my unarmed build. Add in Barbarian for more armor, maybe even Evasive and you've got plenty of resistance.
---
The problem is that SS is so overwhelmingly powerful compared to every other set of armor that it feels stupid to not go after it.
---

Except you and the other homophobes.
---
And rebuilding takes a lot of time and effort. 95% of the building blueprints the game makes when you move your camp won't be placeable for no reason.
---
I play the exact same way as you. Perhaps we could be a good fit. 
---
 IGN : Sergeant-Cabbage
---
Great idea! I hate that event though, I’m completely rubbish at it.
---
Now who's lying?
---
You're quick to jump on some "alt-left" bullshit excuse when your crap is called out.
---
"Keep ~~agendas~~ gheys out of ma game"
---
You just chose to dog whistle. Otherwise, why comment at all?
---
1. Who keeps restocking all the shelves after a place has been looted?
---
2. How do you polish rust? (oh, wait .....)
---
Collecting all those springs would've been nice tho lol as for the scorchbeasts that's insane
---
Who made you head of pricing for Wal-Mart
---
Should have kept the plushies. Your priorities are wack ! Lol
---
that string has been in the game long before NW, though.
---
This happens to me over and over.  In my private world, I claim 3 or 4 workshops, defend them and then after a time the server crashes and I lose any scrap that I might have collected. 
---
Seems to only take a couple hours before the server disconnects me.
---
Had that happen to me once. It’s not fun, especially if you have expensive stuff to repair (decontamination shower...)
---
I just tell myself I can play once my classes are done, if they do maintenance/update on those days. If it’s the weekend, I just play other games until 76’s maintenance finishes.
---
Just because you dont need it doesnt mean you dont want it. Why continue grinding fallout for best weapons and gear if you have completed the game?
---
Only a little longer until they think they're banned, everyone just say" yes you are, they know".
---
Or wendigo they seem to be more common for me to run across.
---
So did I, and then proceeded to auto scrap them.
---
Plenty of flat spots with water, i’ve had several placements with that exact description and with 2 of them I would occasionally run into a placement problem.  The newest site and my most favourite yet with over 30 normal water purifiers I have almost no issues.
---
So you want to keep minorities down and yourself on top, ok, thanks for confirming that.
---
Yeah but are they back up yet?? 🤔🤔🤔
---
I don't know if you were here for when they released those, but holy hell, the amount of impotent outrage expessed in this sub...
---
I have a b3325
---
I have a feeling you aren't alone there, I solo it fairly regularly as no one else shows up!
---
Still, if challenges are gonna be like "kill a sheepsquatch" they will be really easy to do.
---
On now. Lexig0red. Been sick do haven't been in but on now.
---
or actual confirming
---
Yeah, but...why are the servers down?
---
Are you in the hills near the entrance to the Deep?  Mine was there and I killed a bazillion Flatwoods monsters lurking near my camp.
---
I have the real poster of it too!
---
Freedom of speech is just that. Your not happy that my speech doesnt match your own opinions. You want everyone to fall in line and accept what your saying as gospel
---
I would consider the collectron pay2win.  It's not purely cosmetic and it's even listed in resources in the camp screen.  
---
Sure it's not game breaking giving an advantage.  But this and repair kits do offer an advantage overall.
---
the woopsies.
---
I am actually pretty new to reddit so no I didnt get to see it lol
---
Even better
---
Wait. I just want to be sure I got this. So, if I try and play in three minutes, the servers will be down? Like, REALLY down and you can't log in to play, or...?
---
Yes, just because you are free to be homophobic doesn't mean it's right.
---
theres tons of legendaries for sell in vendors for under 300 caps each. if you vendor hop a bit ull have more then what you need for your daily scripts.
---
The part of your opinion I don't get is why not cater for minorities? What does that take away from the experience of the majorities?
---
It wouldn't be trivial but it also wouldn't be technically challenging to present the list of coordinates for camp locations per server to clients seeking a server as part of the server selection process
---
I guess you completely missed the undercurrent of inclusivity in the entire storyline of the Raiders at The Crater. The whole group is composed of minorities who banded together for the common goal of survival. 
---
Plus, what an ugly take on humanity, 'minorites are minorities for a reason'. It really flies in the face of the founding principles of the US that 'all men are created equal'. 
---
You're entitled to your opinions, but expect to get flak for opinions like this.
---
As long as I have been playing games like this there had always been a black market for items.  No matter if it’s in game currency, specific items, farmable items.  You won’t ever get rid of something like that anyways, no point in cheapening the effort that some players went through to locate the dress.
---
On that note, how much agility is too much, your opinion?
---
Because what your saying is ridiculous. You want agendas implemented that go against the basics of the game and if people dont want things implemented as they bear no relevance on the game then you kick up. Grow up
---
This was viable after level 25 or so in FO4.  I did a punch and throw grenades character.  It was fucking hilarious and a lot of fun.  Just slamming into a super mutant overlords, knocking him down, and then beating him to death with your armored fists.  Great stress relief.
---
For what it's worth, it's usually a lot easier to go to Huntersville and West-Tek to get most bug parts than it is to go to the spots. Bloatflies are especially hard to find and really hate dropping their pieces.

I went with settlers and split the gold with them, it too 2 days extra to get raiders to ally than settlers. That was doing the rep legit and not using any cheats.
---
Just for this game, that's correct
---
.....and then accidentally cure it by removing starched genes at your camp and going through a decontamination shower
---
I'm lvl210 and still using my excavator PA full time. The +100 passive carry weight with te +100 from calibrated shocks really help for carrying lots of stuff. I am saving up gold bullion because I still havent decided what to buy but the only reason I would be it are:
---
1. During enxryptid you will probably die less because of the high resistances.
---
2. Maybe the new colossus event will have a though  Boss which can deal lots of damage so you can mitigate it. 
---
3. Use less stims overall (not in my case, I usually end up selling a lot of them regularly at the vendors)
---
The Queen still only takes 10% of my health when she swings her wings at me.
---
any of those stupid "level up while doing 3 things" challenges. also, the ones that try to force us to play NW.
---
I mean they run on Nuka so....
---
a VERY simple fix to this, that I think everyone will be ok with is, a power armor mod or perk or something  that lets you "attach" unarmed weapons to power armor, -- even if it doesn't give you the visual update to your first  -- so your fist is "really" using the bloodied faster attack speed deathclaw gauntlet, with +1 Str.
---
This would give us the appearence of power armor punching, -- give us a weapon to swap between for using a gun and swapping back to "unarmed" -- and everyone would be happy.
---
The End.
---
Just chat before you know it your friends list will be huge I can send you my game name to add me
---
Where did my original post say it offends me?? I said real world issues/politics/agendas/problems or whatever you want to call it should be left out the game. I said it's a game I come on to have fun not have real world issues thrown in my face
---
IMO and considering the amount of train stations and delivery bots among other things then a mail system should be implemented. In fact, it should have been in the game initially.    
---
WoW had an in-game mail system when I played it years ago and not sure how things are now. You could go to ANY mailbox and sent a mail to another player's character or  your own as long as you know its name and the correct spelling. It does cost a fee and it might increase the more you send.    
---
In 76, there should be a small fee as well. This thing existed before the war and you would get deliveries via robot, train, mailbox, or cargobot depending on the item and method of delivery. In WoW, I had 3 characters and would send a bit of gold plus items the others could use giving them a boost and more efficient use of items.    
---
You could easily make a mule character and IMO would make the game more fun instead of tediously repeating level grinding or spending ours doing the same quests over and over. I doubt it will happen b/c ALL MMOs are made to be time sinks. Time is something you can never regain once it is lost.    
---
If BGS really values its fan base, they will implement things to maximize our time to play to reward ratio.
---
I think the servers are going down now for the update. We can do it once they’re back up later.
---
It's twice as hard to find a suitable server while you're in a party of two, three times as hard on a party of three, etc.
---
😂😂😂
---
No. They’re doing maintenance. For the next Update.
---
I was being sarcastic. =D
---
The LAMB-aster
---
Yea we all just got a temporary ban. At least until maintenance ends
---
That didn't take long.  
---
There's an update going on.
---
To bad
---
it would be cool if when you hover over a player if they had a card that showed a title and certain achievements
---
If you want high resistances but don't want PA, just run a full health build with Buttressed Vanguard Secret Service armor. I only have one piece of Vanguard but my arms and legs are Buttressed. I'm not even at the peak yet with my SS armor and my DR is at 470 ER is well over 500 and RR is almost 300. I use Chinese armor in nuke zones because I'm not going to be tanking the SBQ. I could remove the jetpack and mod the chest piece to be Buttressed as well if I need more but I don't. If you want to be a tank but not rely on fusion cores, go with SS armor Buttressed Vanguard. I am also running 7 mutations that help. Grounded gives me +100 to energy resistance. Scaly Skin helps too.
---
Thanks! Good advice. I did get some damage when my camp was closer to Garrahan but since I've moved to a junk generator site...that's stopped.
---
Yes. Because it was a string imported directly from Fallout 4. Where marine armour was pretty much 2nd to PA - prior to Nukaworld gang heavy armour I believe.
---
UT is also GMT so they kinda covered that... just add the one hour to make it BST and bam its 3pm
---
2/10
---
Oh no, my server is shutting down. The ban hammer is falling
---
Did they give an ETA? I didn't see one. Not sure I can go multiple hours without cursing at a bug or lack of QoL features lol
---
Thanks for the tip. I built a base in a power line tower at one time. That was pretty safe.
---
Turtle has a vid of his low health stealth commando iirc where he kills her in a couple of seconds with regular "magic" ingame weapon.
---
The fact that legendaries are required to make weapons good shows a flaw in the games design.
---
No. Give them an hour or several. Should be back up by 5 pm EST *at the latest*. Please convert to your local time zone if you do not use EST.
---
if you find the end of the rainbow, you get 20 gold bullion

When you hammer those super mutants...do you get XP for that? I used to do the same when I was camped near the ski lodge building.

You can't edit my quote like that because i dont want ANY agenda being given a spotlight in the atom shop even ones i support.

lol :p
---
No you're fine. They are updating so we gotta wait it out.
---
Sounds like I need to learn how to acquire  an ally...
---
Video games are an applications run on databases, just like any other. Base coordinates are literally text values that could be regularly updated and queried by a client attempting to join. None of this requires loading heavy graphical assets. It's not trivial, but it's not as difficult as you're making it out.
---
Ha! They ARE! Almost as bad as murder mutts.
---
yes. yes you are banned. you will be unbanned when the servers come back online.
---
Yeah it was nice collecting the springs and whatnot but the stagger those bears do is a pain especially if it happens and another bear is closing in on you n you can't do a thing.
---
It was insane, we recently did ground to air quest before that and no scorchbeasts turned up.
---
Mission failed and they all turned up at once afterwards with some SB's already out nearby of fissure sites...
---
This is a joke right? No way someone is unironically still saying shit like this.
---
rainbows that start in the forest shouldnt end in the savage divide.. this is bullshit.. FIX YOUR GAME BETHESDA
---
I agree. They wanted PvP to be a part of the game, but legendary items were just one of the many reasons why PvP failed in adventure/survival mode.
---
It's 10:00 am EST, time to leave the basement for a few hours.
---
I had a glitch yesterday where every time I FT'd 3 yao guai would spawn in with me
---
The problem is in order to do any decent damage (because you'll need to stack strength) you'll lose out on so much bonus strength from unyielding gear.
---
I would go for a bloodied unyielding bare fisted melee build and ditch the power armor entirely.
---
Yes
---
Well, that didn't take long...it isn't like we haven't been talking about this update for weeks.
---
With creatures that high...I bet it does help. Are you getting those creatures because of your level? I'm wondering if they scale with your progress.
---
Because imho that would be  just reversing the problem.
---
Pride flag? Sure, as long as a hetero flag gets added at the same time. 
---
This is a game, not RL. Here it just shouldn't matter who or what you fuck (not that it should ever matter if the age limit is met).
---
yep I just got banned too, whatever bought another copy
---
The funny thing is they're not down.
---
Impotent outrage?? People are allowed opinions. I'm outraged my football teams badge isnt in the game or there team shirts. How dare they......
---
Good advice. "It hurts when I do this! Well, don't do that."
---
join a group.
---
That could be fun. Build a camp. Build defenses. Have a horde show up and defend your camp!
---
I use zero melee perks and I still enjoy it tons with flamer and long bar.  thing shreds honestly, even at lvl 20 weapon only.
---
Thanks for the info, smartass.
---
14. Why can we build perfectly clean camps but people 300 years in the future haven't picked up that skeleton in the corner for three centuries?
---
Sadly, I'm not one privy to tons of time and countless 3 star legendaries. I don't see how so many are getting them so easily.    
---
I've found the Hardened Sniper Rifle modded for best reduction in recoil, max damage, best range, armor penetrating, and suppressor can make any character take out enemies above its level without perks.    
---
With a Rifle build, this gun should be standard. 308 ammo is somewhat easy to find. At level 23 with max Sneak and what Rifle perks you can get are maxed, you can do tons of damage from afar and they rarely find you. My main luckily got an arm piece that makes him invisible when he crouches. I'll keep it unless I get a better one.    
---
Pump action is far too slow to reload. Gotta make those sniper shots count b/c if you're hit while reloading it stops the animation and you have to do it again taking more damage.
---
And my axe!
---
Maybe so? There are a lot of similarities between the two games that's for sure.
---

I mean that would be pretty sick honestly

Heterosexual pride has zero reason to exist which is why you'd get shut down.

WHY IS THE END OF THE RAINBOW AT THE BOTTOM OF FISSURE PRIME!
---
New weekly challenge: Take a picture of a friend while naked at the bottom of the fissure prime next to the pot of gold, while in a nuke zone and engaged in PVP
---
Are you my mom?
---
You need to go to Scribe Grant's terminal in fourth floor to start the quest again.
---
I would rather have a power plant up and running that produces 3 in a relatively short time than farm flux to craft them.  I don’t even lock it when i own it because I want anyone who needs a core to be able to grab it if they need because I’m not coming back so regularly to collect them.
---
Also this way by not locking any of the resource points I also know when another player is just taking the workshop solely to instigate pvp because there is no reason they need to take the workshop too collect the resources. 
---
Then if I want to I can either change servers if I want too collect more or stay where I am if I have enough.
---
Just pick up the holotapes at all three silos and go back to anyone of them after a player launches a nuke to retrieve the last one
---
Not sure.
---
Take it easy there Karen.
---
That loading screen came out at launch before legendary scout armor and secret service armor.
---
Since Wastelanders I have seen two. Never seen one before that
---
The thing is, I did see a purple mothman the other day close to the crater. I was in awe by the sheer coincidence. The flatwood monster and the mothman were just being chill. Turns out, a purple mothman even if its red eyes, can deal a shit load of damage.
---
PeOpLe StIlL pLaY tHiS?! I didn’t know despite following a subreddit dedicated to the game and constantly posting how I think it’s a shit show based on one experience in December of 2018 and some YouTube videos.

Oh yeah, I forgot some whining about 1st and the atomshop. And THIS EXACT moment I decided to give Beth one more chance. 🤣 /s

Nuclear Winter spawning.  unless they add a timer to the start before everyone can move they cant really fix this.

Fallout 1st. they introduce survival tent skins every few months with new updates or special occasions like Christmas. ive missed out on the Christmas tent skin.

So is that not discrimination then on the part of one group of  people are allowed to do something while another isnt

"wow cool robot laser game only gay is political"
---
You mean, "Jenny, I go yo numba" lol  
---
Part of the name of the song is Jenny, lol. It's about a guy who finds a phone number written on a bathroom wall, "For a good time call Jenny 867-5309". I'm rather a shut-in these days so I haven't been to a bar in over 15 years, and I don't know how old you are or if this is still a thing, but people used to prank others by putting their phone number on bathroom walls like that so strangers would call them looking for sex. I think it was a pretty disgusting practice and a pretty disgusting song for capitalizing on it, but they didn't ask me.
---
Wait, am I banned?
---
This. I put my tent next to the one in the mire (west of the plane). I spawn in. Shoot. Collect loot. Hop. It's repetitive but 7+ screws a time plus other goodies. It's a dirty job but someone's got to do it. Probably a minute per sloth and most of that is loading times. 
---
Even without the tent it is really quick.
---
But can it advance time by a few hours!? Also, ArE sErVeRs BaCk Up YeT!!!???!!11

Here we go again

Not worth the grind unless if you're a power armor collector.

The ring fades the older it gets, and the missle silo state holotape will give you an idea of how long it’s been up for.
---
So I'm sure you have *volumes* of posts advocating against communist propaganda in the AS?
---
BOS's ludditism?
---
Raider vs Settler?
---
No?
---
Huh, so only this one thing.
---
The doors don’t bother me too much. It’s when I come to my camp and see mobs blowing holes in my walls and eating my fusion generator while some dickhead calmly browses my wares or is afk at my base. Happens all the time!!! If I’m shopping at another players camp and an enemy starts steam rolling the base, I do a public service and kill the damn thing.
---
60 seconds? Must be nice to go that quick. I don't have a particularly slow PC, but I don't have SSDs, and don't have the ability to upgrade right now, and it takes about 2-3 minutes for the first world to load after I click on Play from the main menu; then, if my CAMP can't be placed, the game has to reload the main menu (another 20-30 secs) and then do the load process again which is another 60-90 secs for me. If I have to visit 5 worlds to find a place where my CAMP can be built, it's close to 12-15 minutes of waiting.
---
I dont believe you
---
Just got booted for server maintenance. They had a nice 5 minute count down in the corner of the screen. I was able to wrap up a couple dailies and collect from my robot and ammo machine before it shut down.  
---
Does anyone know if this is all on the server end or will there be a download on our end too? There is nothing downloading right now.
---
I may be wrong about this but there is already a sort of way to see how much damage you are doing.  The SBQ health bar will show a grayed out section as you do damage.  If you are not doing a lot of damage you may have not noticed it, but if one has an effective heavy weapon you can for sure see how much of her damage you have caused.
---
typical i think you have to be in a team
---
Worse comes to worse you can server-hop player vendors and you will most likely find it for sale around 1000 caps, not a day goes by where I don't see at least 5 people selling it :)
---
I can't say for sure because I didn't do what you did, but you did save her life and she will accompany you to the vault.  So I'd say its pretty certain you can convince her to open the necessary door to get the Slug Buster.
---
THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! I WANT A REFUND!111!
---
Wait actually, are we supposed to get a download for this one? I’m trying to start that ASAP.
---
I picked up 25 Large Holiday Gifts, do you think I got banned? Cant login rn
---
I managed to catch the prequel - Are the Srvers down yet? (sponsored by Wrens infinity vacuums)
---
&gt;The problem is that SS is so overwhelmingly powerful compared to every other set of armor that it feels stupid to not go after it.
---
This is why I've really started to wish we could get a transmog system in-game some day... the Secret Service armor just *looks* terrible, in my opinion, but the stats are so good...! But a transmog system would let me earn whatever stats I want to use, while also getting to use whatever look I prefer. :)
---
Why would she help a buttface?
---
Yo so are the servers down I cant seem to log on?
---
No. There is already enough pride nonsense.
---
This community never fails to snub its nose to its casual players when given the chance does it?  Ever occur to you people lets game revolve around their lives not vice versa OP?  Sorry it annoys you when people come to FO76 sub to get FO76 info...
---
Now watch the community turn on me lol.
---
Quests bypass that daily limit and give you scrip as a quest reward!
---
Awesome you're the Hero the People need, I've rolled 24 Secret Service Right Legs without getting a Bolstering or Unyielding (even a 1 star)
---
Wait, why didn't anyone give us some notice. ;)
---
No apparently we live in an equal society right. What 1 can do so can another
---
dammit i was going to post this
---
One time she wandered all the way to Grafton Steel.
---
If it’s like the others, there will be an update to download as well
---
You shouldn't have done that thing you did. Shocking.
---
I DEMAND COMPENSATION!!
---
Gauss rifle
---
With your comment history in this thread and you're really going to sit there and tell someone else to grow up? fucking lol.
---
I got banned also.
---
Also the fact that nobody really sleeps at night anymore.
---
yes we will unban you in 3 hour’s, probably
---
Many of the loading screen tips come copied directly in from the Fallout 4 assets. Where the description is true - prior to Nukaworld DLC.    
---
      
---
No one bothered to adjust / fact check them in the context of Fallout 76s balance changes.
---
One day I was walking up from the Spruce Knob Lake after taking a pic of it for the Overseer's dipstick robot (and getting my ass handed to me by the Mirelurk Queen that lives there), and blundered across a "Blood Eagle Thief" in the campground in between the lake and Foundation. They dropped a multiscope and I just walked it back in to Ward for the quickest completion time of that quest I've ever done.
---
Awe!
---
A fellow South African!
---
I had a group of 3 spawn near Charleston fire station and another 2 spawn while I was trying to kill them (I was below lvl 50 when it happened I think). I got 3 of them but didnt have the ammo on me to get the other two.
---
I basically hid in the second floor of an abandoned house and just shot them in the face repeatedly while they looked at me.
---
Both of these are awesome ideas! I loved how you could inspect someone in City of Heroes, for example, and see all of the Badges (achievements) they’d acquired, and I always thought that it would be cool if FO76 had a similar system, but with merit badges ala the Pioneer Scouts.
---
You sir win 1st prize.
---
No it isn't because you're not locked out of celebrating pride whilst straight. The whole idea of pride is for people who are oppressed for being who they are celebrating and getting time to be proud of themselves. Straight people do not get judged just for their sexuality or life style and are considered welcome to pride festivities. A straight pride parade however would have zero reason to exist because straight people have never been oppressed or largely murdered entirely because of who they wanna bone, unlike the LGBT community.
---
They keep updating the screen tips as they go. Maybe one day it will suddenly read ‘it’s only second to a handful types of armors’
---
Are the servers up yet?
---
Looks alright for the most part, although I would highly recommend dropping Happy-Go-Lucky (useless) and Hard Bargain and put them all in Adrenaline under Agility.
---
You can always just swap in Hard Bargain when you're buying/selling items, and you'll enjoy a nice rolling damage bonus while killing.
---
And now you look like a real idiot your comparing fake in game agendas to real world agendas. A game is a game real world is the real world. What a moron. He was on about he is an animal rights activist but he doesnt want that in game also
---
permanently so I've never had to do it again
---
For the vast majority of fo76 content - basic weapons will do fine.
---
Once you get to the point that you're hunting down sbq, or sheepsquatch - yes, you are going to need a legendary to do high damage. I don't see how that is a design flaw, I don't know any mmorpgs that you can use basic weapons to kill end game content.
---
text chat,   
---
some actual endgame content.  
---
removed daily limits
---
Great idea! It would add to cosmetic detail as well. Wearing a lab coat with the Doctor title etc, it would  make the RP aspect a little better. I like being a soldier so it would be cool to have a rank next to my name up until commander or general...yeah I like General that would be sick.
---
Their assumptions are correct .. there are no world altering, game changing quests like in single player Bethesda games based around a main story, except maybe some dialogue .. but from a multiplayer standpoint the quests aren't that long and offer a nice pool of xp to level up as opposed to some other games where quests are your only option to level or grinding kills is your only option to level
---
In 76 you can log in for 5 minutes or 5 hours and have no aim, no drive no ambitions for the day .. just wander kill and loot, other days just pop from map event to map event, maybe do some rep for a faction .. but that's about all she wrote
---
Hopefully in the future there will be more repetitive content for players like crafting quests/dungeons/raids/fashion wars or more engaging pvp .. they started off with capturable workshops .. but there's very little value or reason for it, but you can capture so they have that capability at least
---
So you could try convincing them based on where the game started where it is now and the potential is has .. 
---
1 From no npcs to 2 factions of npcs to build rep for .. so maybe in the future ... but for now gives you something to do
---
2 From no dungeons - 2 tech. instanced areas .. but fall under the same ruleset as most indoor areas so .. but there is a boss .. technically .. so maybe in the future .. but for now gives you something to do
---
3 From no world events/raids to public notification of map events .. most of which end in a couple minutes but none the less .. they started in a direction that could lead to raids/world bosses etc .. but for now gives you something to do
---
4 It's got a battle royale .. this buzzword should hook you line and sinker .. throw your wallet at Bethesda naow!
---
But let them know it's just an open world shooter, negative dungeons/raids
---
So you're upset about the workers rights part of F76 as well then? Because that's a real world issue that's in the game.
---
K. Well, I am.
---
GRAB YOUR TORCH AND PITCHFORKS!
---
But it's a game no relation to real life. Do you all live in the fallout universe or something
---
A friend and I were testing this out a while ago, he did not have an ally in his camp and it still destroyed walls and camp decorations. It did take like 7 bait and about 5-10 minutes for them to explode though.
---
People keep saying this and it makes no sense.
---
Look at the way fallout does politics.  It is nuanced.  There is almost always two sides.  A yin and a yang.  And many times, the "good guys" don't always win.  It's not just "welp here it is in your face!!!!"
---
Pumped to check out Seasons! In the meantime, here is another buglist. 
---
Link to my most recent list: [List Number 22](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gmpb43/fallout_76_update_19_patch_notes_may_19_2020/fr4vf7p/?context=3)
---
***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
A few bugs/oversights that I am revisiting just in case they were forgotten:
---
* (UPDATED) Inside the Whitesprings Resort, in the Aurum, [the walls on either side of the Shopping Mall Vendor are missing and the Void is visible,](https://imgur.com/a/rsXXpX5) this is because the walls exceed the roombounds and get unloaded (extending the roombounds should fix this)
---
* If you have multiple weapons of the same type (for example, 3 different legendary combat shotguns) and one is favorited, relogging can cause the unfavorited ones to become favorited instead of the original
---
* If you have rebound your VATS key, the camera zoom still prompts you to use 'Q' to zoom and not the rebound key (hitting Q does nothing)
---
* Changing/unplugging your audio device while the game is running makes all audio silent until the game is restarted
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Vault 94 Thorn Armor, Solar Armor and Scout Armor Masks crafted prior to Wastelanders [no longer have their vines/leaves,](https://imgur.com/a/n6LUo4s) however any crafted **after** Wastelanders correctly have them (this is a follow-up/correction to an entry on my last buglist)
---
* Changing/unplugging your audio device while the game is running breaks NPC lip files (NPCs will no longer move their lips when speaking), breaks dialogue, and speaking to an NPC can sometimes cause the game to crash
---
* [Healing Salves and Stimpaks no longer display how much health they restore](https://imgur.com/a/hv8ItRV)
---
* [Bobblehead: Unarmed does not list the percent of damage that it increases,](https://imgur.com/a/WLvanbB) which is inconsistent with all other damage-increasing Bobbleheads
---
* Atomic Shop - The Atomic Shop music reverts to default volume after the first song finishes
---
* Atom Shop - The Vault Boy/Vault Girl Power Armor Helmet skin names [are not capitalized](https://imgur.com/a/VppqmfX)
---
* Atom Shop - You can spam the 'Use' option on the 'Hero of the Wasteland Statue' infinitely, and the explosion VFX repeats for each use. This is inconsistent with the 'Iron War Hero Statue', which has a cooldown period between uses
---
* The Radiation Emitter trap is [missing textures on its particle effect](https://imgur.com/a/choflTj)
---
* A large proportion of ore veins inside Abandoned Mine Shaft Elaine and Abandoned Mine Site Kittery cannot be harvested
---
* Attaching a Beam Focuser to an Ultracite Gatling Laser [changes the color of the lasers from green to red](https://imgur.com/a/mIuwYgE)
---
* Dying while poisoned, on fire, or being disintegrated (there might be other causes too) can [sometimes cause the player's respawn to become bugged,](https://imgur.com/a/P6Gf4Ia) where they spawn but the respawn menu does not fade, and the player cannot control their character. The player must fast travel away, or relog to get rid of this
---
* There is a [fence post floating outside of Foundation's entrance](https://imgur.com/a/doyOejU)
---
* These [benches at the Palace of the Winding Path are missing the 'press-and-hold' prompt](https://imgur.com/a/xjp2rEt) to sit on them
---
* The Nuka-Cooler Backpack preview model is [skewed by 90 degrees](https://imgur.com/a/FKtsFej)
---
* The Nuka-Cooler Backpack is [not centered on the player's back](https://imgur.com/a/J0pmZOO)
---
* The Gauss Pistol uses [male running/walking animations for female characters,](https://imgur.com/a/5joKqy0) while in 3rd person
---
* Flamers no longer deal fire damage, while Molotovs do still deal fire damage (on Wastelanders release, they both dealt fire damage). Unclear if this is an intentional change, but fire-based weapons should be consistent with each other
---
* The dump truck in the Whitespring parking lot is missing, there is [invisible collision in its location, and the ghoul still spawns floating in mid-air.](https://imgur.com/a/lvh46oY) There is also a toolbox floating on a nearby car
---
* [This 'Malts' sign in Lewisburg has no collision](https://imgur.com/a/UOvqU72)
---
* Sal's Grinders and Beckley share the same exact fast travel spawn point
---
* Nuclear Winter - The favorites wheel can fail to update correctly and will display no items, typically seen for the first few minutes in the first match after the game is launched
---
* Western Revolver Severe and Refined Receivers [do more damage than the Hardened/Prime Receivers,](https://imgur.com/a/ZVXWYAm) which is inconsistent with other ballistic weapon receivers
---
* Aiming-Down-Sights while crouching and in 3rd person fails to correctly lower your sensitivity like it does while standing
---
* The Hunger and Thirst meters [no longer turn red when they get low](https://imgur.com/a/S9vAP1b)
---
* Equipping a Gatling Guns with both the 'Front Sight Ring' mod and the 'Extra Large Magazine' mod causes the 1st person sights to become [partially blocked by the magazine when Aiming-Down-Sights](https://imgur.com/a/LLHYWeL)
---
* Quest - Fun and Games - Obtaining the Prototype Steel Mill T-51b Helmet can fail to give you the plan for the skin, leaving the player unable to obtain the skin despite having the helmet
---
* Quest - Daily - Mistaken Identity - This quest is labeled as a daily quest, but never resets. This also renders the 'Complete Different Daily Quests' World Challenge uncompletable for characters who have previously finished Mistaken Identity
---
* Quest - Daily - Vital Equipment - [Ward's quest items can spawn as loose items in the world,](https://imgur.com/a/mb4QTz9) even while the quest is inactive. A place they frequently spawn is at the Camden Park fast travel spawn point 
---
* Challenge - In the 'Complete Different Daily Quests'  World challenge, the entry 'Complete the Daily Quest "Voices"' is incorrect, 'Voices' should be 'Someone To Talk To'
---
* Exploit - Crafting a Circus Trailer Door, storing it, changing its variant to be a full Circus Trailer, placing the Trailer down and then scrapping the Circus Trailer causes you to regain extra budget, due to the door having a lower budget cost than the Circus Trailer
---
* Ultracite 2mm Electromagnetic Cartridges weigh .05, which is [double the weight of standard 2mm Electromagnetic Cartridges,](https://imgur.com/a/2LeO4tk) who weigh .025. This is inconsistent with other Ultracite ammo types, who have the same weight as their standard variants
---
* Eating a Swamp Plant incorrectly make the 'drink' sound instead of the 'eat' sound. This is because it uses the "NPCHumanDrinkGeneric" sound instead of the "NPCHumanEatGeneric" sound
---
* Applying the Hellfire Prototype Paint to your Power Armor Helmet causes you to be able to [see inside the helmet through the back of the neck](https://imgur.com/a/rHcnm3F)
---
* If you have the Hellfire Prototype Paint on your Power Armor Helmet, turning on your headlamp in 3rd person [causes the light to emit from your feet, and it points to the right instead of straight](https://imgur.com/a/AEBo0lc)
---
* Floater Grenades are not affected by Grenadier; they do not have their explosion radius increased
---
* [The 'Tattered Mole Head' has 1 Damage Resistance,](https://imgur.com/a/nXsMFgL) which is inconsistent with all other headwear because no other headwear grants damage resistance
---
* Rapidly entering and exiting a terminal several times causes you to [lose control of your character, and you get a 'Waiting for response from server' message,](https://imgur.com/a/R0U9DFe) this persists for about 15-20 seconds
---
* Event - Swarm of Suitors - This event fails to automatically track, even if it was manually tracked on a previous completion
---
* Nuka Cola Scorched/My Blood's In It/Vaccinated do not restore thirst
---
* After deploying Excavator Armor, the [headlamp is missing](https://imgur.com/a/AcLyPFq) until you either enter the armor, or mod it at a power armor station
---
* If you have your weapon holstered, the [present from the 'Give Gift' emote is invisible](https://imgur.com/a/3e17Hr9)
---
* [Crouching and looking at another player's Ally causes the 'E)' prompt to appear,](https://imgur.com/a/7tKDvLq) but it is missing a text prompt (for example, 'E) Interact')
---
* [The top of Pulowski Preservation Shelters are missing collision](https://imgur.com/a/Qo9uay4)
---
* Nuclear Winter - If a player is wearing a Raider Pathfinder Mask when they die, it [shows up in the inventory UI and other players can loot it](https://imgur.com/a/iogpv7I)
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Add more Vault Steel and Legendary Modules to the Purveyor's inventory, it is pretty inconvenient to have to server hop to buy large amounts of either of them. For reference, she only carries 5 Vault Steel and crafting Vault 94 items requires between 10 and 30 Steel, meaning you need to server hop between 2 and 6 times to buy Vault Steel, depending on what you want to craft
---
* Remove event reward truncation; with the addition of Treasury Notes, many event rewards get cut off because they surpass the entry limit and only display "...". Allow us to see the full list of rewards.
---
* Add a toggle option to use the original 3rd person dot crosshair, and/or add crosshair customization
---
* Add Treasury Notes to the Collections tab, rather than having them be a Misc. item, or make them appear at the top of the 'Misc' tab
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Change the Fusion Core crafting recipe to something less extreme; 5 flux for one core is far too costly, especially when the other alternatives for obtaining them (Power Plants/Sentry Bots) are essentially cost-free
---
* Event - Breach and clear - Make the mining containers instanced to each player, and not shared
---
* Event - Line in the Sand - Reduce the repair costs for heavy laser turrets, they are [pretty costly to repair](https://imgur.com/a/PAQWHR8)
---
Cheers!
---
Where did you find her, does she have a sister? You lucky man.
---
Osmosis kit (at least a variant of it) is listed in Misc instead of Junk so won't auto scrap. That's the one you want to be able to turn in Ward's Daily without having to ever search for another Raider Thief ~~ever again~~ until the fix the glitch.
---
How do you do those eyes? Just asking for a friend :)
---
Oh now i see it, it’s the Free States bundle, I doubt it works on T65. The only PA skin that works on T65 is the Red Shift skin.
---
good endgame gun ? Gauss Minigun with explosive perks and heavy gun perks would be good
---
More than likely. You have to have at least 3 copies of skyrim installed to get away with something that atrocious.
---
Not to mention fix how defending the workshop works.  I spent over 30 minutes once at poseidon running around, on too the power plant, through the cooling towers, everywhere I could possibly think of only to find out the remaining liberators were behind one of the security lockdown doors and even when I opened it to let them out, the last one was stuck in a place I couldn’t kill it.
---
I didn't realise there was a hetero flag. But that's not quite the same is it? A pride flag celebrates the freedom people have to love whoever they want. A hetero flag would celebrate... what? You're opinion that the other people are wrong. Groups don't have to be catered to in the same ways. A pride flag doesn't have to be met with a hetero flag as hetero groups are catered for in the game in other ways.
---
Your argument that minorities shouldn't be catered for in games is ridiculous. 
---
&gt;This is a game, not RL. Here it just shouldn't matter who or what you fuck (not that it should ever matter if the age limit is met).
---
Them releasing a pride outfit doesn't make it matter though, it just makes people that support that cause happy and people that don't support it don't have to buy it. So what's the problem?
---
If it was a new storyline that forced the agenda of the minorities onto the whole playerbase then you may have a point. But that isn't the case.
---
6:30pm Kabul
---
No, snowflake. You can have whatever opinion you want, but I don't have to respect your opinion, or ignore it, when you're wrong.
---
Short answer, there should be a download for this, yes.
---
That's what I've been doing since faschnacht, I've made a few great armour sets out of the bargains I've found as well!
---
Nice job, this is very cool
---
YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS!
---
Got emmmmmmmmm lmao
---
download after server is patched as it’s new content
---
All of the things you mentioned have something in common.  There is countering forces to all of those views in the Fallout universe.  There is a yin and a yang.  The way Fallout does politics and stuff like this is very nuanced and not "in your face" like the topic at hand.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Only 10.7Gb to go. Mine will be up and running in a few seconds...give or take a few hours.
---
Wooow funny
---
Makes sense. So once their end is finished we will get a download. And then can play as soon as our download is done. Too bad they can’t happen simultaneously
---
Its not just fo76 , Lots of games have their servers down atm
---
A few nights ago I found her out on the barren land near the Black Bear Lodge or whatever it's called. Just standing there.
---
i want to find whose dropping and making them they’re my best friend
---
The loading screen before you get spawned in NW should be the time they use to make sure everyone is loaded in
---
Wait, so **communism** in the game isn't real, but human rights **are**? 
---
I wonder what the difference is?
---
I sure came in to tear you a new one. 
---
Take your dirty upvote.
---
All you have to do is manually set your computers time to +3 hours. Oldest trick in the book. Im busting out dailies for .5 atoms apiece as we speak
---
Right. It’s the larger creatures that I’m talking about. I don’t want to be forced to switch out my lever when fighting SBQ. I want to save some ammo dammit :)
---
That’s cool and all, but do you know when they come back up?
---
They were making a joke with the name of the other poster... Pretty sure they know the song, hence the use of the number.
---
Pretty cool update! Technically there's new content, but a lot of it is reworked things.
---
Really looking forward to public teams (where teammates can't grief my CAMP).
---
I got this with Mongrels at the same workshop! I ran around on to the roof and somehow they got up there too even though I saw them behind the doors
---
same, gave up on the concept. Was able to keep 4 going for a few hours once, but the game was really glitchy most of the time.
---
I'm about there on left arms. it's murder. I did get a decent unyielding chest so far, rng is a beast
---
3.6gb
---
Shadowed being able to be applied hopefully means it actually works on all armors. Because it was able to be applied to  armors already, just didnt work except on leather.
---
Thread locked.
---
well, that's not bad .. just go to bed and tomorrow the update will be done.
---
it's 4 pm here, that sucks
---
You watch Bear Grills?  😂
---
Wow , wonder how many of these "fixes" work and how many new bug reappear lol
---
My download just started.
---
Get Ward to stop keeping his eye on you.  No offense.
---
Yeah I'm with everyone else. Get the SS armor set for use while out of PA. PA has its uses but I don't recommend living in it 24/7 - save it for Nuke Zones and maybe during the Queen.
---
The difference in power from T-51b/Ultracite/T-60 PA to T-65 PA is tiny compared to the jump in power from normal armor sets to Secret Service.
---
Well great, that song will be in my head all day now! haha
---
She appears randomly.
---
How did you end up with so little lead. Tangara town crickets for acid and lucky hole lead is 1200 to 1400 a DAY!
---
Instructions unclear, controller now stuck in tv
---
The commander, beckett, raider punk, the old guy, and the guitar playing settler girl
---
So many are looking for this.    
---
I'm sure prices have fluxuated as with any market. I saw it was for 726 caps a year ago. Even with my max CHA of 7 with a chem it was 1538 and barely knocked 200 caps off.    
---
I don't have the mats to make it up at least I can.
---
Build 1 of every item that requires gold bullion
---
This is literally the only right answer here 
---
Over and over and over
---
Challenge accepted.
---
PC! :(
---
k
---
Dude why not take your post down and then head wherever you were heading. This is just stupid. I dont need the supermutant but i had to comment.
---
Those aren't even trap camps. They're just douchebag camps. 😂
---
The question is, did you have 3 packs gums with you?
---
For number 15, although it’s not talked about, they have what is in essence Star Trek replicator tech in the fallout universe at this time, so think of those big bot makes as glorified robot replicators.  Where they get the raw material?  Well I’m sure the replacement handles clean up the robot spare parts and recycle them.
---
Also glad to see a question about the treetops railway.  It just vanishes into the ground!
---
handle checks out...
---
Just checked again. 11.2gb update.
---
I was going to say some standees to access the atom shop. Maybe near train stations. 
---
Instead I think actual raids. With roles you have to pick prior to launch. Need a healer, support person, dps etc. Would be fun to not have everyone competing to swing their big *hammer* the most for the duration of a fight.
---
Yea she’s the wanderer settler, very chill but also very filthy, literally.
---
Cool! Even better!
---
I figured so but, the available power armor being worded differently threw me. I mean, T-65 should be included in the T series though.
---
Thank god trap camps are thankfully dead with this
---
I have a Bloodied 3\* Gauss Shotgun for West-Tech, a Vampires 3\* Gauss Minigun for SBQ and my everyday favorite  3\* Two Shot-Exposive Gatling gun.  
---
Why one shot anything when you can spray them with exploding 5mm?
---
  Please let this update and patch get done as fast as possible. 
---
  I have absolutely nothing to do today and was planning on making the sweetest camp ever. 
---
  I was planning on setting up a shop so dank all other shops would talk of mine. 
---
  I was planning on going ham on all the scorchbeast and all the little getsums that want sum. 
---
  But of course the one day I plan on getting down on fallout they have maintenance and updates. 
---
  That's my luck. I just hope it doesn't last the whole day.
---
Good news... On todays patch notes " **Scorchbeasts:** Can no longer be turned into Ash or Goo Piles on death. "
---
It's not forcing you at all 
---
If you wanna play with people then play with people. If you don't wanna play with people then don't play with people.
---
Everybody gangsta till fallout 76 gets a 150gb update too
---
As always thank you for such a detailed list! We'll break this down internally and review it.
---

Yea the text was published way before T65 was introduced. Back then it worked on all T models, now they need to update the description.
---
I'm guessing the patch will be available at some point.  I'll try to post when I see it for PS4.

---
Thanks for the new information.  I will be testing this out when I get home, provided patch 20 doesn't completely break the game.
---
Easy Fix for a moron created problem.  Good on them.
---
I do this every time I visit a vendor . You would be surprised how many camp owners immediately open them back up as I shut them . Some people have issues !
---
I'd definitely use it if it had realistic damage stats, atm it's probably good for killing chickens
---
Just decided to give this game a try again about an hour ago for the first time since beta. Typical timing lol. I'm looking forward to playing it, the first hour I played was already a lot better then I remembered.
---
For PC it is yes
---
Where’d you see patch notes already?
---
I thought it would be cool that if you had several people playing different instruments, that AT LEAST they would all sound good together, like an actual song a band is playing.  That has not been my experience, anyway.
---
I've had a bug since I started playing about a month ago that I'm curious if other people have experienced/resolved (xbox).
---
The volume cuts out as soon as I join a world. I have to plug a headset into the controller and then it goes back to normal so I just play with it always plugged in which isn't ideal. It cuts the volume out for all xbox apps while running; netflix, etc. As soon as I quit fo76, the volume comes back. Anyone else experience this?
---
Cheers :)
---
So... nothing about the beloved fast travel bug?
---
I had 14 last week and i constantly had 2 or 3 retake missions waiting for me. it was super sweet. Then it crashed. 
---
Someone said that private servers struggle after 4 hours or something.

It's here on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hio4tb/fallout_76_update_20_patch_notes_june_30_2020/
---
Yeah but it would be nice if the town, airport, fire station where truly populated, and had daily quests to offer, like the responders as a faction I think is really well thought out, and its one of those factions where it can easily be rebuilt due to its core beliefs, like as a new player can you imagine how much more engaged you’d feel when you come along flatwoods to a fully populated town and you get to undertake responder training from actual NPC’s instead of the terminal
---
Oh, I read it, it's just that there have been too many missteps and tone deafness over the past year to just take their word for..well..anything at this point, really. I'm only interested in hard numbers, and we'll only get those once people have had some hands-on time with this update.
---
&gt;So no, I am not excited for this "update".
---
word. that's weird because nobody asked.
---
Ya, no. Good luck trying to kill anything above 30+ easily with a non-legendary weapon. (Unless you stack ALL the dmg perks / buffs)
---
I saw five of them walking across Charleston, over near the fire station. Hilarious and deadly.
---
but thats half the fun, shooting an expl flamer during a busy event, someone jumps infront of you, or a ghoul is suddenly in your face.... "dang it killed myself again" xd
---
I mostly repair it in front of an event if I know its gonna be a while, even if it is on 90%, quick repair kit to 150%, I have always 50 or so from the queen so I dont mind, and always have a backup weapon selected for when it breaks again I can quickly switch to the backup,
---
fyi if your not using em much, I'm willing to take em of your hands ;) got some stuff to trade for it if u want, atleast if u are on P ;)

---
I had my FO4 modded to include the c.a.m.p. system. Some of my favorite bases were built inside some of the nuka-world interiors. I have decided that 76 is closer to a reskin of another MMO, rather than a development of the actual game mechanic art that had been developing within Bethesda since morrowind (maybe before, I dunno). Everything about the building in this sucks. Shoulda just cut it out and dispense with the pretense.
---
Alas ... only 5.  I wish there was a Super Mutant, a Ghoul, a Mr./Mrs. Gutsy and ..... a dog.  Maybe in future updates they will be added?
---
I felt as you did. Alone, overpowered and bored. Completed missions just to complete them and melted my share of SBQs. But recently I joined a brotherhood role play group that is super into the lore aspect and discovery. They write actual combat action reports and scribe reports on terminals they find to a discord and do patrols together. It has completely changed the way I play for the better and breathed life back into the game for me. Would highly recommend joining a group.

I'm on ps4 too. I'll meet you and buy .I may be interested in the minigun too. My gamer tag is the same as here. I'm on most evenings till about 10est.
---
Today's update will add team match making. If you want to play with others but dont know anyone this is how.
---
Destroy/Repaired Turrets will no longer be lazy and ignore enemies
---
I do hope so. I'll be glad to see that  real Golden Oldie bug bite the dust. But what will I do with all the time saved now I won't be screaming ''wake up you fool, its right in front of you you blind trash can of death!!!"
---
Me too. And bonus, if I say I had to kill to get it, I get three extra Script
---
I’m only 6 weeks into this game and I’ve found an appreciation for trap camps only in their creativity to try and lure people in. My general rule is that if I have to go through a doorway to shop with you, I take my caps elsewhere. I’m not in favor of any form of “griefing”, mind you. But I gotta hand it to someone who spends hours trying to devise some of these things. Me, I’d rather sell shit, so my vendors are front and center on the property.
---
Very satisfied with this! New content seems fun, and a lot of bug fixes we have been asking for have come. I only wish the other stuff wasn't delayed, but it is what it is.
---
All the perks that will help you max out your damage are: 
---
- the 3 Heavy Gunner perks in Strength
---
- Tenderizer in Charisma
---
- Nerd Rage! and Demolition Expert in Intelligence 
---
- Adrenaline in Agility
---
- and finally Bloody Mess in Luck.

I sure hope commander Daguerre's back is ok with this patch... Would like to start her questline hahaha :(

Not true. You can ask my friend up there. Whenever we do it I always stand in front of the tunnels and still 4-5 enemies spawn in the tunnel I am standing in front of.

they still didnt fix the explosive bait. im guessing there will be a few more trolls around.

I have an idea,  since the m79 is considered a heavy weapon,  how about actually making people move slower like they do with any other heavy.   Also remove vats

"Respawn: Fixed an issue causing players to lose carry weight bonuses while dead, which could prevent them from respawning at locations other than Vault 76."

Fingers X'd it works...

I think they ripped that blurb straight from a Fallout 4 loading screen, in which marine armor was very good and required some effort to obtain.

I wish that all quest rewards at least worked like the blade of Bastet so you could do the quest ASAP and upgrade the reward through your career.
---
Like I don't do any quests till 50 unless I look up the reward and see if I don't care about it.
---
It's sort of a conflicted game design where it tries to cater to both playstyles, I sorta like the description bethesda had recently of a "solo MMO" or something like that. It's weird too, because I do still think the game benefits from being what it is. Even if you only really run into players at events or once in a while in the wild - I appreciate them being there. It gives this game a sorta life previous games couldn't match. Like I could play Fallout 4 and spend ages crafting the perfect version of Sanctuary for my own satisfaction but then I only really go there from time to time and it's only really for me. I could spend ages crafting the perfect camp in Fallout 76 and players can come see it, and I can run into their camps and find all the strange fun things they've built. It makes a tremendous difference. Side note you also picked a heck of a day to make this post they legit just added team finding stuff today.
---
lol i was coming here to make this exact post :)

---
They’re probably just down for maintenance before the update, or they could be releasing the update to each console separately
---
It's really cool. Nice to be able to join up with people since I don't have any friends lol
---
Since they seem willing to address power armor clipping issues in this patch. I’d like to add that you can see into the T-65s left forearm when wielding a 50 Cal. The arm needs to be lowered slightly on the players screen to prevent this. It looks so bad that I’ve basically stopped using my 50 cal in T-65. I did report it on the test server!
---
Also! I don’t like that the daily quest givers are now stationary. I’m gonna miss finding rocksy halfway across the map or finding ward t posing in bed.
---
All you need is to use the Escape Artist perk under Agility and all armor sets will be equally stealthy while sneaking. 
---
The exceptions are that the Shadowed armor mods appear to only work on Leather, and the Stealth Field granted by the Chinese Stealth Suit.
---
I don’t see why these types of comments get downvoted, it’s the literal truth. I love the game but would enjoy it a lot more if there were end game raids, or something for us to work towards rather than just a drip feed loot grind. There’s plenty of doable great suggestions on this forum that Bethesda needs to look at.
---
They fixed it by removing it, lol
---
Does this also add deep pockets to arms and legs, or just some under armor mods?
---

You said you anger me but i can only downvote you once. Stop getting it personal and just learn how it works next time.

Bruh... I seriously got chills. Excellent work.
---
everything should be free..
---
you leave 76.. go down to wayward and buy everything you want for wood scrap...
---
What, and you think they’ll do something about it? They don’t do anything about blatant god mode cheaters or the idiots who duped literally fucking billions of Nuka Cola Quantums.
---
Do you see this with other games as well or just 76?
---
If they’re already placed they’ll still be there though
---
Great news! She is now stationary as of today’s update! Check the school bus!
---
Same question or deep pockets
---
What worries me is they said specifically Underarmor... which leads me to think they still forgot about all the other missing SS mods from arms and legs

Items such as the teddy bears or items like the small robot figurines.  It doesn't matter the kind of item, all my junk in my stashbox disappears everyday except what I have in my display cases. Essentially, I can't store junk items. They get scrapped by the end of the day automatically. I see what the other posts mean though.

That’s what I’m more excited for cause yeah my friends don’t want to even touch this game.

Glad I could help. Best of luck to you

0/10, wife and kids didn't work. I ate the Abraxo too...
---
Exactly the point. Before when it could benefit the player by awarding free Atoms it wasn't a priority to fix this because it benefited them not to. I can't even imagine how many free Atoms it cost players in the long run. Before I understood the bug I had it happen on a weekly reset and it cost me tons of Atoms between the weeklies and dailies combined.

Only fallout 76 - all other games have normal audio

hope you don't mind me adding two more:
---
1. since the backpack update, all walls on the backwoods bungalow are no longer solid, you can walk right through them and can't place any items as a result.
---
2. the red rocket diner set table has a large invisible barrier on one side which means you can't sit down unless you place a chair quite a distance away from it. this only seems to affect people on PC, and it might not be consistent for everybody.
---
Collect 50 Perfectly Preserved Pies.
---
How about Urban Scout Armor can be repainted, but Forest Scout Armor can not. Unless that was stealth fixed in this patch its still an issue.
---
Personally I carry a RW LMG around and use that when I fight the queen or other extremely large creatures.
---
Read the patch notes
---
I was wondering what all the hype was around the SS armor, I know now lol. Thanks for the help!
---
I Agree,   
---
I broke down the cost for the fallout 1st yearly subscription (£99) as £8.25 a month. A 1000 atom bundle is £7.99 so for £0.26p I get an additonal; 650 atoms,  private servers, survival camps, and a scrap box. Current US pricing is even better as a yearly subscription is $99.99. The monthly charge would be $8.33. A 100 atom bundle costs $9.99 so for a saving of £1.66 you would get the additonal; 650 atoms,  private servers, survival camps, and a scrap box
---
Can anyone tell me why the download amount differs so much amongst different platforms?
---
Glad I didn't scrap my laser
---
Yeah, I agree. Hopefully they give us more somewhere in the Roadmap.
---
I'm going to miss logging in to have "Cop A Squatter" complete and get free rewards almost daily lol
---
Currently installing the update! Idk if it will be playable yet upon completion but it’s nice to get it out of the way.
---
There’s other ways if you want to kill people. Like actual PvP, or designing a real trap base that isn’t just a gazillion punjis.
---
Lol, It kind of feels that way.
---
Yes, by level 30 you should have multiple damage perks for a specific weapon type. If you focus on generic or passive perks instead, yes your DPS will be anemic.
---

---
Not which character you complete it with, but rather which one you claim it so that you could complete challenges with your high level and use the caps to push an alt.
---
This, seeing as hiding your own smell with sodium hydroxide is a great option.
---
Exactly, this would be ideal. And maybe they could have certain quests that would reward 4-5 Treasury Notes.
---
It has its advantages, the possibility to use mods being the top one. UI-upgrades, improved shaders, chat (limited, but still), perk-card manager and better inventory are  a must for me at this point.
---
IMO cornerstone of everything (meaning PvP, PvE, difficulties) is weapons and they have various issues from just annoying to serious ones. And there is so much threads from "i want this pls add" to describing various broken stuff douwn there - they could improve almost everything if wanted to do so.
---
She gets annoying fast lol repeating the same dreamy hippy crap over and over.
---
Perhaps it is by design?  Secret Service Armor is pretty OP, it gives other sets something that makes them of worth.
---
on ps4 I have 70gb free and keep saying that I don't have enough free space to download it
---
Already downloaded.
---
Well.. are they?

---
I’ve contemplated the same thing - but if that were the case, why is it available for the torso?
---
The camp I've had attacked is on a mule account. There are no rebuild materials on that character, so I can't use the "repair all structures" option on the camp unit. Instead I have to have my main character form a team with the mule, then go around the camp repairing items individually. It's annoying.
---
I've only had one asshole doing this, and he passed into the camera line of sight of my mule as he did this so I simply logged the mule out before he could make any progress. Still, it's annoying.
---
So I had this problem before . Cancel the download restart ps4 and try again it should work after a couple of tries
---
Plenty of people already know. They were using them to kill robots at Fasnacht.
---
Yeah, I had that happen a few times. Got that light foot perk and always wore a hazmat into camps
---
They had mentioned in an discussion that they missed some, but looks like not this patch which sucks

I was going to type craft 15 different types of alcohol or play 7600 hours

You break off the head and use the base to mash it up and snort the powders, which give you a certain ability. Bc Fallout has heavy ~~drug~~ chem usage.
---
Oh look , Todds boyfriends downvoting
---
I hate griefers trying to start shit or destroy my camp   but the trap bases are actually fine with me. Some of them are very creative. It's their camp. Why not do what they want with it? It's easy to not carry a ton of scrap when you're shopping. It's really on you if you lose your stuff going to a strange place.

---

---
My take on this game from before it was released was that they were “hoping” that while yes, there’s a main story you can mostly achieve by yourself, the end goal was players were going to be the content. Hence the original lack of human NPCs.  
---
Through your player icon, outfit, and skins you apply - you might take on the role of a responder, raider, BoS soldier, etc.  Then when you find other people you would role play with them.  Maybe get into some PVP with slap damage.  If you go back to some of the posts before the game came out people were all talking about what team they wanted to be in and stuff like that. 
---
Unfortunately, Bethesda did not provide enough tools to accomplish this.  There’s not Guilds/Faction system, for example, and they greatly, greatly, greatly overestimated how much people even really wanted to group together and do PVP. 
---
Some players do still roleplay, and it does make a difference in the experience.  You can find people to play with on other subs such as Filthycasuals or FalloutFactions (IIRC).  Getting into a “faction” war can be find (if you like PVP).
---
So, **TL;DR:**  The Main story and side quests can be completed solo.  The rest of the game design was intended as a group activity of meeting new players and either creating conflict with them or allying with them.  They overestimated how much people wanted this and some changes have been made accordingly.
---
This was for daily and weekly Atom CHALLENGES, not quests.
---
good point..

Which is a bummer... I guess I'll hang back 1000 Gold (assuming legs+arms are 500 a piece) and start rolling on something else.

Welp looks like a few days wait for me. I'm hoping it resolves my server crashing at log in issue too
---
What a pissy thread.
---
haha, I completely agree. It's internally consistent that it floats, and so it does.
---
did that but happened the same, it seems he's trying to download the entire game again.
---
&gt; Quest - Daily - Mistaken Identity - This quest is labeled as a daily quest, but never resets. This also renders the 'Complete Different Daily Quests' World Challenge uncompletable for characters who have previously finished Mistaken Identity
---
Really hope they fix this one. They just added more dailies to it so they know this challenge exists I guess.
---
Ahh, my apologies. Free rewards here I come! lol
---
I find it a little bit shocking that people that are far enough into the game to get SS armor still use deep pockets on armor.
---
Secret service armor is vastly better in all regards now.  My 4/5 set’s rad resistance is only 80 points behind my ultracite PA.
---
Looks like a pretty solid update. I would have to request though, that with the improvements made to the Team mechanics with these public teams, that some more general improvements to teaming be made. Specifically, as it stands right now its pretty hard to justify teaming while just wandering around with friends, especially at low levels, because in order to get XP for any kills everyone has to hit the enemies, otherwise they can miss out. When you have characters that are typically one shotting enemies, this makes it hard for other characters to keep up XP wise. If it could be done that when in a team, you still get 25-50% of the XP of a kill even if you don't hit it, as long as you are within a certain distance of the target or the character killing the target, it would go a long way to helping with this problem and further encourage people to group up and explore together from the early levels, and even at much higher levels.
---
Feed me the downvotes, I only grow stronger!!
---
nobody wants to play this game until they are superman..
---
then when theyre superman they complain there is nothing to do and the game is too grindey...
---
Either he raiders are really good or the settlers are really bad.
---
I’ve built enough trap bases to know that there isn’t another way. You can fast travel out of any trap other than punji stacks. What’s the point of that?
---
Now I don’t agree with blueprinting and setting stacks on people, but running through a trap is on you. As it should be. 
---
Dying doesn’t even have any consequences so what does it even matter? 
---
Even bringing pvp into this argument shows you have no idea what you’re talking about. As pvp is even worse to “kill” people in. As everyone in the game only uses explosive lasers and Teslas. 
---
Might as well change that raider tag to something else 🤷‍♂️
---
Luckily I can sleep it through
---
You are right , it does try to download the whole game . Idk why it does this , do any other platforms have this problem or is it just PlayStation ?
---
Please tell me SS armour got the deep pocket and ultra light mods added...
---
This was reported as an issue so early after wastelanders
---
Thanks to the sweet text chat ...oh wait a minute, wrong game. We have no text chat
---
youre right!
---
the game should just end once youve completed the main questlines..
---
&gt; **Turrets:** Fixed an issue causing Turrets that have been destroyed and then repaired to have a significant delay when engaging enemies.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Please Note:** Turrets are still intended to take 2-3 seconds to acquire a target and begin firing.
---
so...what's with the 'enemies firing at a turret for minutes until it's destroyed without the turret firing back' scenario?
---
Apparently your sense of humour is down along with the servers.
---
But both things stuck with each other, does not it?
---
no clue I just have the ps4, I'm not happy to download the hole thing again
---
Angry turtle has a video series where he tries to find out the best weapon in each category. He does this by testing basic weapons against high level enemies. While not all of them do well, the vast majority of them can at least kill high level mobs in a reasonable amount of time. As fast as a  bloodied or junkies build using a bloodied or junkies weapon? Absolutely not. But (and this is also a response to your edit) why should basic weapons be able to kill just as fast, or even anywhere as fast, as legendary weapons?
---
And an end game. Don’t forget the end game.
---
Hey, so I was scouring this sub for an answer about the servers being down and all I could find was post after post stating how the servers are down today at a specific time for the new update, so yeah wtf are the servers down or something??? I hope I’m not banned, I just remember seeing a paper bag with a million gifts so I said why not right, could that be it guys?? Please give me an answer preferably in the fashion of a new post stating how the servers are down today
---
Sadly I'm experiencing a bug since I bought this game in 2019 . 
---
It doesn't allow me to shoot in vats at all. The only reason I see why it's happening that I have my mouse clicks inverted in Windows ( I'm using a left-handed mouse Razer Deathadder left hand edition)
---
Could be cool! Though I think it might work better if we could have an option to display *character* names, rather than just the player/account name.
---
The only way to communicate is through voice chat I've found. I wish there was local area chat like within 10 feet or something or private messaging through your pip boy or base computer.
---
Fanboys
---
&gt;We’ve also changed the number of Challenges you receive on a daily and weekly basis so that they are more predictable and consistent.
---
wtf is this supposed to mean? they have been consistent... we get the exact same amount of dailies and weekly, every day and every week. 
---
&gt;We’ve added some out-of-this-world tunes to the Atomic Shop to delight your ears during The Legendary Run.
---
uh.. thanks.?
---
&gt;Fixed a bug preventing some Perk Cards from appearing in Perk Card Packs.
---
a bug that what now?? so people who've been levelling up for however long now can suck a dick? Bethesda does quite a lot of "fixing," but literally never compensates for these issues. it's completely fucked up.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue causing players to lose carry weight bonuses while dead, which could prevent them from respawning at locations other than Vault 76.
---
better late than never i guess.. happy its finally fixed at least.
---
lots of good stuff in here, though im really concerned about SCORE. i was super pumped for the new Seasons system, but if they make this an unnecessarily ridiculous grind, i think ill be putting the game down until the next full DLC arrives.
---
She killed all the refugees we sent over to Foundation. Rocksy always wins.
---
"Say hello to my little friend."
---
My 300kb/s rural ass internet tells me i aint playing fallout today haha
---
And there was a spike in people doing it after the few posts on here. 
---
Same as when people made posts about people blocking the robots with PA.
---
Fast Traveling also only works 50% of the time when you have the Healing Factor mutation. please fix that, it‘s been in the game for months now. some locations are worse than others, VTU for example. can‘t FT out of there until everything is dead first.
---
What does this smiley update mean? If I cash in 200 billion for the day I can’t buy 300?
---
Someone with the guts to help.
---
Yikes at some of these replies. Imagine defending Bethesda's love affair with extremely BORING and uncreative grind. Just try to imagine that level of fanboyism.
---
Same. I gave her a pink Asylum uniform and was like 'GIRL! Why are you so filthy and not in a good way?'
---
And by "God Mode Cheat" I'm assuming you are referring to the poor excuse that is considered PvP in adventure mode, and players not dying?
---
I'm pretty positive that's not a bug or a cheat just an extremely stupid "design" by BGS.
---
I shot a player with my anti-armor fatman that does over 1.5k damage, and the player only took 110. Multiple times.
---
So the "stat squishing" to keep PvP "fair" apparantly makes some perks and legendary effects useless.
---
On top of the horribly reduced damage, rank 3 of Nuka Nut makes colas three times as strong. So quantum heas you for a good while for 600 hp pretty much constantly.
---
A player cannot produce enough damage to counteract that, so it basically comes to running your enemies cola supply out.
---
Go read it for yourself it's at the top of the " Hot" section
---
Respawn: Fixed an issue causing players to lose carry weight bonuses while dead, which could prevent them from respawning at locations other than Vault 76.
---
Finaly!
---
There was a Vault Dweller named Dave
---
Who went to the Wendigo Cave
---
Looking for a Gourmand Key
---
But instead, it ends up he
---
Found himself in an untimely grave
---
Meanwhile I send videos of people abusing glitches and get told there ain’t nothing they can do right now. Hell one of my friends grassed himself up and literally begged them to remove all his duped ammo and they didn’t even take away the ammo!
---
I hear it does a tremendous number on the lungs.
---
Pretty sure they auto completed and didn't award shit? I had to get atoms back a few times by logging into NW first by mistake. And submitting a ticket.
---
That's fair, however my build has been strictly what I am comfortable with. My Handmade and Fixer are both AAE (which is outside the norm of bloody or junkie), I use a full Vanguard set (obviously because I like max health), and I carry a lot of stimpacks, salsbury steaks, radaway, and rax x (because I am anxious about ever being low). 
---
I'm level 348 - never used a mutation until 330\~. I get folks can get their weight under 300, and that's cool, but I can't comfortably, so yeah I need these mods.
---
I would like to find that one. Being flung could be fun, especially if you can wave while flying. Imagine the look on its face when you fly past a scorchbeast while waving.
---
Shear Terror
---
There’s a difference between having a well thought-out trap camp that took ingenuity to do, and just being an asshole and saying it’s fine because “you’re a raider.” And this is coming from a raider.
---
Unfortunately just the underarmor
---
I agree. What you said is what i get downvoted for saying all the time.
---
It’s the wasteland and these people want their hand held.
---
PC - This has been an issue post wastelanders, cycling through various graphics options seems to have no effect.
---
No, I mean literal god mode. You need to use an explosive energy weapon for it, and they guy physically cannot die, because he’s on fire constantly but he can’t fast travel.
---
I hate static npcs. So unnatural
---
No, lot's of us make modifications to the ini files to alter gameplay and performance
---
If I remember correctly they even stated publicly that altered ini files are fine
---
I did this questline with my brother and wife so when we arrived there were 3 of the NPC. It was like picking up your kid from daycare as they ran around during the fight and we yelled out "ok, this one is mine, that one is yours"
---
lol damn sensitive kids these days
---
Honestly you make good points at least about the junk, I usually scrap before I go shopping, but why do you have to be an asshat about it? Never understood why people are condescending jerks when it comes to a video game.
---
Ah, good to know, i take it those types of rewards will be claimed in the atom shop then?
---
Best but time consuming way is to make and scrap assaultron helmets with super duper because eventually they'll just keep multiplying until you have enough or get bored and just break down all the scrap assaultron heads. 
---
 One of the best places I've found is the very top floor of the office block at abandoned bog town. You have to climb on the roof and drop down the elevator to access it but it's an office filled with typewriters and globes. 2k hours in and I only found this a couple of weeks ago. Felt like I'd stumbled on the ark of the covenant.
---
Here’s the current iteration of my heavy explosive junkie. 
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3638ab&amp;d=sq2s22s32sr2c71ic3a72au1a04l71ls2lt2s01s12p00lu2sb0ib0pj0eh2eo2pq0&amp;w=ep1sw0sv0c52pa0p80p90c62c81e30&amp;m=1c9fea
---
I didn’t finalize my decision to go Junkie and hammer out a similar build with decent gear until about level 100. Grenade launchers, missile launchers just aren’t worth IMO. Although fun, the DPS just isn’t there and isn’t all that viable. My JE Gatling gun rips out at about 465 damage with adrenaline and has a 500 round drum, no grenade launcher can compete with that. My AA missile launcher although it tracks, only does 1 damage to the queen. Nukes are far too heavy and fire too slowly to be viable as well. Much, much better off with explosive .50 &amp; Gatling.
---
I mean that’s exactly how the game was marketed.
---
They did NOT give you Atoms if they auto completed and you had to submit a ticket to get them back.
---
IIRC, Skeletor's staff was called the Havoc Staff.
---
Fallout 1st is fine as is, already borderline.
---
How dare you imply i haven't been bathing!
---
I roll around in the dust on the floor thank you very much. If it's good enough for animals it's good enough for me.
---
That bug has been around for a long time. Comes and goes
---
It’s an extra 50 for a full set ofc people use it
---
Are the servers still down brought to you by Robco Experience Life With Robots.
---
Meh, the resistance on it basically does nothing.  I get 1-shot all the time bloodied.  Lone Wanderer, Dodgey etc. do all the defense work, armor is basically pointless.  I wouldn't call it OP.  I'd say it makes the game a lot more enjoyable because of the jetpack.
---
nope, you can even get a couple of mods if you want
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76
---
Sure, patch 30
---
under QOL, i think we need a separate tab for each outfits and armor, instead of just bunching them under apparel. for a game that has such a large amount of outfits, you would think this is a no-brainer.
---
I used a pipe pistol (bloodied) for my daily walk around.  Ammo easy available n trusty
---
Four times the pain size!
---
The patch notes for v20 don't say anything about a fix for this.....ugh.  The wait continues....unless they snuck it in?
---
So you guys are saying the servers are down? You are saying to leave my number and you will send it to bethesda? Alright
---
1(800)IAM-IMPATIENT
---
Yaassss!!! Tons of great fixes in here!!! Keep it up B!
---
 Looks  like they fixed some damage issues with the bows, but the not the VATS  accuracy issue. Looks like they continue to go unused in my stash. The  bows already have zero advantage over guns and are inaccurate to boot.  Do they not want people to use them?
---
I used to use a ME .50 cal before I got my AAEFR lmg, and they’re both okay, but the lmg just shreds through everything. Especially my ammo reserves XD
---
same items, right?
---
mine is trying to download the hole game, any fix for it? I have 70gb free already and he's demanding more 18gb
---
revisionist history FTW
---
Which is why I agreed with that guy saying non-legendary wapons suck. You NEED multiple dmg perks just to get those gun remotely usable. Which sucks for people who want to focus on non-dps oriented builds.
---
I would know, I went for a hoarder build and couldn't kill shit to save my life unless I had something amazing and or lots of ammo / meds to waste on enemies.
---
(Still use this build as my main and luckily I've gotten a few god-ish legendaries so I could actually kill things.)
---
Gotta love that cannibal perk, when Commander Daguirre doesn't shut up, eat her. That sounds bad.
---
Nailed it
---
 **Vital Equipment:** Choosing to donate the reward no longer skips the rest of the conversation with Ward. 
---
Will I finally get rep? WILL I FINALLY GET REP?!
---
Got a bloodied bash double barrel and a bloodied vats hit chance combat &amp; pump. Typically only need 1 lvl 1 shotgun perk for most things. 3 lvl ones + bloody mess does the trick for the big guys. Combat shotgun needs a hardened receiver and armor pen to really shine but I recently changed all the mods to give me max AP for a different feel (almost unlimited vats &amp; super quick reload).
---
Not sure why you get a message claiming they can't do anything. Never got that one. Just the one saying they can't tell me what they have done due to people's privacy.
---
As a former admin of multiple 76 fan and trading groups before I quit social media, (except reddit now, *sigh*) I watched people that I reported complaining about getting punished for cheating.
---
It was fucking hilarious.
---
Thanks! Well, I did re-purpose almost every video Bethesda has made in the past, primarily the live action stuff. Only had to use game footage to fill a few gaps. But some how I got that footage to help tell a story with the dialogue.
---
Calling them Trap Camps is doing a disservice to actual neat trap camps.
---
You mean people that are able to kill things extremely fast and thus acquire loot extremely fast want a way to carry that loot?  Hell, I'm drunk half the time with Party Girl just so I can bloody move.  I've basically stopped playing for a while and just log in to turn in legendaries because I can't bloody well move.
---
JE Gatling gun is my workhorse, JE .50 for when things get dicey, JE LMG for when peeps think they can push over a character wearing heavy leather armor.
---
Sorry If it's hard to read, I tried different ways to split the descriptions for different perks but it's not working.
---
Yup! They rotate the bugs so we don't get tired of the same old ones
---
thrown weapons are under developed.. solid post
---
FYI in case you didn’t know the game caps the amount of gold you can carry at 5,000.
---
Haha good one 😁
---
Recently? Or a while ago? Based on the fact nobody’s nuke mined you or exp. baited your camp, I’d say this isn’t recent.
---
Ward has a side-hustle renting out the bone saw and doesn't want to own up.
---
I never said anything about basic weapons being able to kill as fast as *decent* legendaries. Basic weapons and or non-dps oriented weapons should be able to *kill* their opponents in a somewhat reasonable time frame.
---
(This does not count towards endgame enemies)
---
*slow clap*
---
Nice. Never had problems with the nuke mines, but I’ve definitely been screwed over by the punji stick trash. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Don't discount your work even a little bit. Without your eye for detail and throwing in the RIGHT clips with the right music and audio clips this video would have a completely different and possibly worse feel to it. It is awesome!
---
He's being facetious, how can you not pick up on that.
---
I DEMAND COMPENSATION I WANT A QUINTOUPLE EXPERIENCE MONTH AND MY NUMBER IS 555-133-7133. I WANT TO HEAR FROM TODD HIMSELF!
---
400 GB here.....wait a minute
---
No mention of explosive bait though. Some douche was destroying my camp last night with it.
---
Serverwide Text chat for all systems would be my number one choice
---
"America failed... not because of it's people..."
---
But we're not going to let those people have tech, because we can't trust them!
---
Also a bug to report:
---
Thorn/Solar armor limbs cannot have limb specific mods attached, such as Brawling or Muffled, but universal mods such as Deep Pocketed or Ultralight Build can be attached to limbs.
---
&gt;Because the game isn't fucking prescient?
---
Except it is. All the information needed is stored server side, so the check to see if a spot is taken or not would be instantaneous. The player should never, ever have to load into the game to know if a spot is already taken.
---
Bethesda could have it tell you your spot is taken the moment you click play. They just choose not to.
---
I have a friend who kinda became the group photographer and he's always sneaking amazing pics at the most random of times. It should be his endgame.
---
I lucked into an Instigating Gauss Rifle a while back, which has definitely been my go-to blaster.  I keep The Fixer for a backup (and to make me sneakier).
---
hey do I need more than 70gb to download the update on ps4? please some mod awser that I would be glad.
---

New collectron? or maybe player vendor?
---
Just make him play it
---
Something about the gauss weapon shooting in vats worries me.
---
Pipe Revolver Rifle. Pipe is life.
---
Controls: Fixed an issue that could prevent PC players from using the mouse to equip and unequip Perk Cards.
---
Oh thank God
---
Explosive bait is still viable
---
Ss armor is the best non power armor in the game, if you dont like power armor then get it
---
My  problem is I have a junk extractor at my camp and I run into this alot but mostly  dont care I have my survival tent if I need a scrap box and everyone's camp has work benches just sucks if I'm running low on junk and need my extractor
---
My instigating railway and Guass for stealth vats sniper build
---
Just switch things up for the dog, maybe ask for your finger to be pulled sometimes or complain about tension.
---
No. Just nuke mines
---
I'd like to see you too FRIEND
---
#NO. As someone who grinded to get one I would be livid if people could just buy it
---
With the addition of bow perks, I was Hoping that tomahawks and knives would get some attention too. They would be fun to use together.
---
Also annoyingly, adrenaline doesn't affect their damage.
---
Nerd rage and adrenal reaction however does, so they're only good for Bloodied builds at the moment.
---
Im sorry bit what are magic wepons in this game?
---
(666) 420-6969
---
I expect a call within the hour
---
wish we could get the perk cards from New Vegas for energy weapons
---
Magic weapons?
---
I think you wandered into the wrong sub.
---
The best way to describe it is it’s a shared world. There are lots of things best done on your own, and lots of things to do in groups. It doesn’t force one or the other. If you want to go out and meet people, turn on a mic and go for it, there are lots of friendly players. If you want to keep to yourself, that’s fine too.
---
A weight-reduction perk for Rifles would be nice.
---
I agree. When someone kills you when you walk up to a vendor with no creativity. Yeah that's just lazy. But when someone really designs something awesome then I get whacked with a stack of punji traps the end, I am fine with that.
---
This is just an off character meant to be silly. The point being that explosives suck.
---
If it can handle trying to load the entirely of someone's player data over and over as they try to find the right server, it can handle a quick ping.
---
Supermutant Collosus
---
Everything sounds really good and fun. So I don’t want to take away from that. But no more atoms for dailies? Ouch.
---
oh I like that backpack with the clip strap.
---
At first I thought you said DERP POCKETED MODS.
---
Watch an angry turtle vid on YT for the info
---
Not everyone has punji traps trapping their vendors...I hate Bethesda
---
So much this. Dehydrated? I can either drop what I'm doing to get into my pipboy, try and remember which button navigates *this* particular menu, almost accidentally drop my camp in a new location, and scroll through a disorganized mess of food, alcohol, bobbleheads, drugs, and magazines; or I can press up on the D pad, move the joystick slightly diagonally, accidentally equip the gun next to the water, press up on the D pad, move the joystick slightly *less* diagonally, consume One water, repeat five times.
---
It's just such a chore. Survival mechanics should be *somewhat* tedious, but not THIS tedious.
---
I find it shocking that people are still acting shocked about how other people choose to play this game. 
---
r/gatekeeping
---
It’s already been an hour, I’ve learnt the mothman and the protectron. Why can’t I play. I want new things to do but why do they keep stopping my game to add them.
---
Ward: Is now stationary and can now always be found sitting behind his desk in the trailer in Foundation
---
This makes me a little sad. I mean I'm kind of tired of waiting for him to rouse from his nap from his rickety bunk bed only to get stuck on the furniture or failing to engage me in conversation because he's always walking away. But now he's going to miss music night, and that's something he was always so proud of!
---
What happened in Dusseldorf?
---
That's not how trap camps work there bud. This doesn't solve that at all.
---
Yes I don't see why not, every other weapon system has reduction apart from rifles and maybe bows.
---
It's strange they did that.
---
depends on the platform. On mobile you can click your emoji window, the shortcode for that specific one is eyes. On windows 10/chrome you can right click the text box and go to "emoji" or hit "Windows Key + ." to bring it up 👀
---
Is there something else than season 1?
---
Hah! Have an upvote for a good laugh
---
@krakenbrax
---
People said it was fixed on the PTS. I didn't play so no idea, and obviously that doesn't necessarily mean it'll transfer to the live either right now. We'll see I guess.
---
Thank's just wasnt sure, the maintenance caught me on my 3rd nuke on the queen and i didnt have time to check the notes.
---
This is exactly why I rage bought Fallout 1st. 
---
( Then I realized it came with an unlimited scrap box) Rage bonus!
---
I was told that they were fixed in the PTS by people who tried it, but yep they're not in the patch notes. Wonder if they were fixed unintentionally?
---
There's dozens of other traps
---
What?
---
read the patch notes
---
Also no
---
Thanks! Ad victorium
---
you mean gimping the survival elements..?
---
no that isnt today..

---
I've had a bug for a long time now on PS4 my character will randomly stagger and stop walking and running for a second or 2, making a sound like I've been hit when there's nothing around, even happens when standing still.
---
It shouldn't be downloading the whole game again. It should download the update, but then needs to re-install the full game plus update before deleting the old install. I've had this problem before and the only way I got round it was uninstalling something else.
---
Thanks looks like I need to make a combat rifle or my fixer anti armor!
---
Did they fix the gauss shotgun too?
---
What flavor.
---
There's the season 1 rewards such as the ammo converter and different power armor paints.
---
Best bet to find addictil is player vendors or Tyler County Fairgrounds. There are a few Chem boxes and doctors bags near the stables and adjoining building
---
Cautiously... It would be nice if the pvp-changes would also apply to the old-style groups. No more fear grouping with low levels.
---
Upvoted as always. Here’s a pair of bugs (I’ve reported to Bethesda) that have been in the game since the beginning, but couldn’t find anyone else making any reference to:
---
(1) Lode Bearing: during the mine-collapse portion of the event, voice dialogue from Melody Larkin plays about the First Friends Church and swarming vermin; completely unrelatedly to this event.
---
(2) It’s a Trap: upon activating the trap, dialogue from Eddie Hayes will play but the sound quality is not “radio-modulated” like other quests
---
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
---
Yes.
---
Also, does it make a difference for region? I'm in NA
---
It’s being downvoted pretty hard so I thought perhaps he wasn’t. Shrug.
---
If you play bloodied it's perfect because it doesn't increase your health.
---
"greatly refreshed my sanity meter" 😂😂😂. That sounds like a line from new vegas old world blues dlc from those robots. Good one.
---
You know what would really bring players together?.. A text chat.
---
there's goes the division to the bin
---
Titles and player cards, too.
---
Tons of multiplayer games of every genre have had these for very well over a decade. These two combined would let the art and writing teams go wild, and there's just so many ways they could be unlocked. Like say having T-60 paints unlocked gives you BoS rank insignia for your card or having all Vault 76 plans would unlock the title Secretary of the Treasury(since at that point the Secret Service agents are definitely your subordinates). Or just random stuff like Nukashine Addict, Possum Slayer, Opossum Slayer(higher ranking than Possum Slayer), The Fixer Fixerupper, I Punch Deathclaws, Cultist, Responder, Zetan Abductee, and so on.
---
There is an endurance perk that won’t cause you to ever be addicted to alcohol but I can’t remember what it’s called other than it uses 3 perk point slots. I also don’t know if it’ll cure current addictions so someone else probably knows more than me but have fun exploring the wasteland
---
Oh yeah, not yet, but it depends on future content.
---
Definitely been there since beta.
---
You mean making it more like a normal, default Fallout experience and less like a survival game which is just an option in literally every other Fallout with a hardcore mode?
---
Just have to wait a while longer for that welcome change.
---
107.30 Xbox series X, installed in my Tardis.
---
I thought they did it last patch?
---
Maybe? I'm also in NA
---
What does ATX mean?
---
Looks like vendor to me but who knows
---
Yep, I don’t spend real money on this game.  Tempted by fallout 1st though!
---
Well excuse me
---
Nothing that can’t be fast traveled from. 
---
Or that does near enough damage to kill.
---
That’s coming with One Wasteland, I think this winter.
---
Thanks bro
---
I'd like it if my Gauss Shotgun that I grinded for a month to get, didn't miss the first VATS shot 100% of the time. Maybe this got fixed, I hope.
---
Nice, i am looking forward to play my ,, one arrow ,, build :D
---
152 is just what it shows on the screen stats. It does really good with head shots but I have used it as a distance sniper weapon.
---
You can't tame that. It's only random encounters.
---
this is the only reason why I have not gotten the Secret Service Armor. I suck at managing my weight and I need deep pockets. I can always spam heal to make up for the DR difference but I can only temp increase my carry weight through food and Chems
---
Expelliarmus!!!
---
So it might land then is what you're saying.
---
They fixed it for the t-51b only and only for the settler variant. (Patch 19). Both paints still break all other power armor. I have 0 clue why they would fix it for 1 power armor and only 1 paint variant
---
Collect the codes to unlock a silo and figure out the launch codes without nukacrypt
---
Good point there!
---
A past build of mine included a small church holding services for a dead radtoad named Bloot. His coffin was a cooler. It was presided by the hug pip boy cutout and was attended by many captured frogs. Their mourning hymns were glorious.
---
With patch 20 she is now stationary
---
Rad scorpion omelette takes away the last addiction you recieved.
---
No you will not get banned.
---
But remember to make changes in the Fallout76Custom.ini instead, that way the changes will survive.
---

---
yeah.. my bad.. we should live in the past..
---
I dunno what I was thinking..
---
You trying to cast a spell ir sumthin
---
And The Division 2, so I hope it doesn't kill FO76.
---
I really hope they drop atom shop prices to balance them lowering the amount of atoms we can get but BEAthesda is greedy so they probably won't.
---
I like how the promo shot for the Gatling Gun skin is glitched/not holding it correctly. It perfectly encapsulates the time and love put into every detail of the game.
---
I watched a video that said I need both maxed out
---
What would you like to see instead? Very curious, like if you could implement any game design with Fo76 what would you implement?
---
Your welcome but I almost forgot it’s a higher level perk so all of my information on the subject is worthless unless your around level 39 this information won’t help you I apologize for wasting your time
---
Wow there’s some great items in there!
---
Would love that train cart!!
---
"Too pure for this world" i can't breathe
---
The instruments synchronize and are a constant rolling track with intro and outros but you'll pick up wherever the group song is playing. 
---
so if you have many instruments and many people they're all playing parts to the same song on time. 
---
This would probably require a code change AND a new expense, neither of which are probably getting budgeted unless they bring in $$$. 
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but don't expect much.
---
Any word on the whole explosive bait CAMP destruction exploit? With Nuke Mines out of the picture that’s what all the malcontents will turn to. 
---
u/ladydevann
---
I believe they are a guaranteed reward for guided meditation event.
---
Really, didnt know that, it will sure come in handy!
---
a dog! Can we name him Dogmeat?
---
No not really, either people will use it purely for the bond buff or people will pop it for 3-5 minutes for the time of an event and buzz off.
---
Plus without text chat nobody will really give a fuck about most of the type of teams.
---
very true, you get it
---
I put the blood eagle outfit and fashionable sunglasses on her and it's like shaking up with a rockstar.
---
Yeee, hope there is something good in this one
---
Hulk maybe not, but Thor works pretty well.  Grab that hammer and 1-shot the SBQ.
---
i believe it is code that indicates which items are for the Atom Shop
---
I’m also a fallout 1st sub. I like supporting the game. But when things aren’t being delivered for what I paid for it really makes me thing twice. Where are all the extra benefits for fallout 1st? 
---
-higher camp budget 
---
-more people in private 
---
- mods support 
---
Only a few things said that would be added. We are close to 1 year since f1st launched and 0 y’all about when it’s being added.
---
Guess I’ll stop supporting the game if they can’t deliver
---
I just wished he left my loot ;)     
---
The other thing is...when i returned and went back to looting, i opened a crate and became wanted.  Which i now know that's bad.    But i didn't even have time to turn around when another high level player, also in stealth, shot me dead.    Normally i have at least a moment to fast travel back to camp and dump my loot.    I swear i was set up.   2 high level players in stealth at the same place.  Maybe coincidence and maybe they didn't coordinate...but it sure feels like it.    Especially the second player, ..in stealth and there at the moment i screwed up.   
---
I then switched servers.   Figured there was something funny going on around there...
---
You do realize that people are just going to be looking for new ways to grief other players if they havent already found other ways
---
So what happens to earning ATOMS for free by completing tasks? Will we have to purchase ATOMS to get anything in the shop now?
---
Folks, I want to point out something about this - Bethesda is lying about the reason you have to load in.  I learned this when I started using a mule.
---
My mule's camp is near the Whitespring's station. So, rather than start up the second Fallout 76 instance when I want to work with the mule, I'll go to the station and look to see if a tent or other camp is present. When I go to the mule instance and have my mule join the server the CAMP of the mule begins to appears in less than a quarter of a second.
---
So, the check for the CAMP location doesn't take that long and is apparently one of the first things done in the loading process.  
---
Which means that Bethesda is just flat out too lazy to rewrite the join server process to make a check to see if the camp can be placed before continuing the rest of the load in process. They have no excuse and they are lying to us when they say they have to wait until the character is completely loaded onto the server to tell us about not being able to place the camp.
---
Nothing sadly. There is nothing new to do is there?
---
1500+ now
---
They do, you may just not be playing the lead instruments. Queue up for nuclear winter and the auditorium has a stage with most instruments where bored people sometimes go and you can see a full ensemble play the song.
---
Agree
---
Hahaha puny humans. *I* am strongest supermutant!
---
Didn’t even know that about the ring and been playing for a long time lol thank you. Would be nice for w little timer though to find out for sure exactly how long don’t you agree ?
---
MAn bAthEsDa SuckS The GAme Is aSS aNd I HatE it BUt I StiLL PlAy iT
---
Cliff spike trap, hidden cage to rad emitters, spawn boatfly can't travel though any trap
---
All the anti-griefer measures. The Score stuff ain't bad either.
---
Oh that’s a good one.  Kind of like the dailies that required a camera before it was released.
---
Oh well
---
Bruh why don’t they remove everything I hate and only put my ideas in? Smh bugthesda
---
I love the subtle sarcasm 😀
---
Does anyone know if Mysterious Savior works with Last Laugh? I am under the impression that it does but can result in you blowing yourself up (which is fine.)
---
Also will Revenant proc from M Savior?
---
I get that, and if they were to implement something like "no stim/stealthboy/quantums" in PvP, that would be fine. But as it is now, it is basically who has more consumables. It isn't like any other pvp, there are elements that are broken that make people want to avoid it like the plague. 
---
Look, I get it, I've played Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout NV, Fallout 4, and I've wondered what it would be like to pvp with the cool weapons and armor I got against other people who also have cool weapons and armor. But the thing is some people don't wan't to play fair, and when you don't play fair it isn't fun...these are the It Is In ThE gAmE fOr A rEaSoN people.
---
Pub
---
I never said they haven't done those things. I said I'd love for them to do it so I could record and report it. About two weeks ago I reported a player for the explosive bait. No idea what happened to them. It took BGS over a week to send me the generic "thank you" message, (it stayed at "waiting for agent" for the longest time, I don't stalk randoms, nor could I remember their name if I wanted too. i quit using SM about two months ago. So semi recently, I guess.
---
not really, this season was made for the newer players
---
I like the way the new upcoming vault system sounds. 
---
Anything else. Seasons are just a way to once again use the old gameplay content again and again and again. I can understand that it's cheap to make and makes some money(and in FO76 stops us getting so many atoms), but it's just lazy smoke and mirrors gameplay.
---
I just wish I could read. Next time I get out of prison I'm gettin my grade 1 for sure though.
---
Umm... ok. Better luck next patch I guess...?
---
Umm good luck with that
---
I came across 3 behemoths - one legendary - walking down the road by General's Steakhouse.
---
Suckers were tough.
---
fps stability and the new challenges
---
Whatever makes you feel better about consistently being screwed over.
---
weapons with certain traits like 50% limb damage on high firerate weapons that do way more dmg than they should - also shotguns with e.g. 33%
---
lol @ you think there is going to be team pvp on a regular basis
---
shotguns are affected by 2 bugs right now, gauss ones 3. magic, armor and charge.
---
they're fixing the charge one with this patch. the next patch supposedly fixed magic weapons. no mention of the armor one.
---
I complain for very different and highly articulated reasons having to do with the MMO format precluding some of the emergent game features that I saw as a hallmark of the developer/franchise(s). Think about how much of this bitching doesn't need to take place if people are left alone and can break their own games if they wanna. I got out of apple products for the same digital fascism
---
Thats the point.... there isnt going to be any
---
it's wrong
---
Oohhhhh I had to wait two months before my scrapbox issue was resolved, I was tempted to just call it quits and close the ticket. But I didn’t. My reward for pulling through? Not even 10% of what I lost.
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
We're still working on bugs with Fast Travel that have been reported to us. It's taking some time but we are investigating them and folks on the team are passionate about getting them fixed.
---
Yeah some people should keep things to themselves. I know it’s hard not sharing cool shit you find out, but something like a super easy scrip farm is going to get patched ASAP. Bethesda wants you to put in long hours to get scrip.
---
More actual content (side quests, fishing etc), a season pass doesn’t actually add any new substantial content when you’re continually playing existing content in order to get the new items.
---
Okay but you are aware that there is this thing called YouTube, right? And on this YouTube thing you can watch videos, right? And on the YouTubes one or more of those videos would explain everything about magic weapons in Fallout 76.
---
so what happens to currently stacked punji boards?
---
Really nice work! Great job.
---
Thanks! I've actually featured those in List #3, and I think I've brought them up again in Bug Showcases as well. Hopefully they get fixed!
---
Yeah I'll still be roaming alone since I have no way to communicate with some random strangers who are on my team. Sounds great.
---
Text chat is a no brainer.
---
What happens to the current ones? They get old after the 50th one you go to
---
there is a cap on bullion that you can have on you (5000). from the text above, it seems like you were able to buy 300 bullion, even if you had, let's say, 4900, meaning that the 200 excess is pretty much just lost.
---
You can still do trap camps but now you have to actually learn how to build something cool instead of just stacking a bunch of punjis on top of each other like a toddler.
---
congrats?
---
I feel stupid...I have watched some videos and finally learned it’s pretty pointless to shoot at scorchbeasts in the air....I didn’t know.
---
Hell yeah.
---
Yis, u hav bin band
---
Why the fuck is the chicken coop grind so goddamn long yet the ammo converter is unlocked basically instantly?!
---
That is what I read as well, I didn’t see that bait mines were addressed, but we will see?  Maybe they call those nuke mines?
---
Got it. Thank you
---
They didn't "fix it", they just added the new recipes.
---
Wait why do I not have communist next to my name WHOEVER CAN DO THAT PLS DO IT TO ME
---
Idk about you but my chainsaw kicks ass. I shred through the gutsy's at AWOL all the time when I use it.
---
I dunno, but after work I’ll go and see if my MG42 still melts bats and come back with an update.
---
There are really cool trap camps out there but they're sadly buried in the mass of boring and uninspired punji camps.
---
RIP Bloot. :[
---
Whatever that BOS PA skin is called with the chopper blades on it, I want it. Looks quite similar to the T-65 in terms of bulk.
---
I started playing after Wastelanders and I think I've done  Enclave Event: A real Blast in Clarksburg, but I honestly can't be sure.   
---
As for the insult bot, yeah, hes still there, ready to drop a sick burn when you least expect it.
---
something else will come up.. dont worry
---
OK I usually never agree with the complaints about nonsense. But this is actually bullshit and not acceptable. Come on Bethesda. Do better. They should not be selling something that's broken.
---
I don't think you clearly understood what I said. I don't watch YouTube. You want to waste your time watching some little kid talk about a game go ahead. That's not for me.
---
Getting daily quests from raider punk ally.   Broke 3 days ago for me.
---
Why is there no single Endgame Big Boss Battle that I can use my Magic 8 ball on and then uninstall the game with a perfect score?
---
Why is there no new content, its been weeks since the Wastelanders dlc and I Demand it each and every month.
---
Wheres the Wendigo Collosus event that you said won't be in patch 20 because your bug fixing it? 
---
Being back Fasnacht as a weekly week long event where I can AFK in a corner and get all the rewards for none of the work.
---
...and many, many more...
---
so I guess the regular rifle skin isn't getting released this patch? only the eagle one?
---
That would be nice to have
---
Don't count on it
---
Aw that actually sucks. They should have just made it so that blueprints can't be placed near other players so the lame people who place them to kill shoppers would be stopped.
---
I've spent the past few weeks server hopping looking for trap camps to defeat. Some of them were pretty clever. A lot of the fun ones used walls of punji boards so that you had to navigate crouched to keep light footed active.
---
Just keep in mind this is only for newly built camps anyway, there will still be people who keep stacks they already had.
---
honestly this sub has been so dead lately I don't think that's even the case anymore.
---
Grill gecko chops and cat steaks.
---
Very cool stuff.
---
I assume with any major changes like wastelanders the game is gonna go down.
---
Next month buddy.
---
the green one? me too
---
And the score is time gated so you have to play for a month straight like a mobile pos game. Fuck this predatory practices
---
There are a ton of suggestions throughout this thread on how to make it better without killing it.
---
Big Al’s Tattoo Shop in Morgantown (Biv’s bar). The upstairs receptionist desk has a static Addictol spawn. You might need to crouch down to see it in a shelf
---
My emitters always seem to break after the first couple strikes.
---
Just looked it up, seems to be a really good series
---
They’ll still find a way, most likely falling through the world, so you shouldn’t go to any of those underground bases... but finally no more punji trash.
---
How come when I ‘tame an animal is calms down and doesn’t attach for like 15 seconds then it come after me again?
---
This is the worst day of my life why is this happening WHY all I want is to farm purify water so I can sell it so I can buy radaway so I can eat my Razorgrain soup without fear of dying later WHY TODD WHY?
---
Might have people visit my camp for other reasons than buying stuff. I'm happy.
---
I only drop nukes on my private server since I can control the respawn of the enemies.   I like to get the most Bang for my buck.
---
I was hoping they'd initiate pvp but this is still a win.
---
Such a beautiful little village.
---
Broken perks. “Magic” is just a nicer way to put it.
---
Ew. BGS has seems to not have much data storage on their end for that kind stuff. Which is why they have issues returning lost and stolen items. That's an issue that they need to work on. Honestly, they should've been aware that issues like that would arise and made plans to fix it.
---
Insult Bot is definitely still around. I save the notes for dropping in loot bags at public events although Fasnacht emptied me out this time around.
---
- nuke mine fix
---
- electrically charge fix
---
- team abuse fix
---
amazing work on combating griefers
---
- god mod fix
---
i bet actual pvpers will be happy about this
---
You can already do it now
---
There are at least two methods to prevent fast travel as well as ways of killing most people before they even have the chance to try. Punji camps ruined this generation of builders.
---
I actually liked those three clipping through everything, not looking at me in dialogue, ignoring dialogue.
---
It made it entertaining doing the same olds quests. You never knew what hijinks Ren and Ward would pull.
---
It's not that easy
---
I love how posts about the servers being down for an update had become a meme on here.
---
i dont care what im doing but i will end up jumping on or creating a team for an exp bonus.
---
Yeah I’m no longer trusting underground bases, even if they have hundreds of weapons and Armor!
---
What's with every game adding battle passes now a days?
---
My download on xbox has just finished but are the servers still undergoing maintenance?
---
What no music for Mr Pebbles?  
---
Gotta have music...

We lose 5500 Atoms from dailies and weeklies (1500 down from 7000 in 10 weeks).
---
PS4 does this for every game update for all games. It makes you backup the entire game.
---
download available now on pc 4.2gb
---
Big Al's Tattoo Parlor generally has an addictol on the shelves under the till/register.
---
How did you find your group? I’ve looked for role playing groups in the  past and never could find much. I’m not really into the BoS though.
---
Nuka Go! A short-lived prune flavor aimed at the active senior.  It made them rather more active than anyone would appreciate.
---
Sounded like it was extra, "in addition to", not required?
---
Guess we'll find out, though.
---
I paid for a premium service they had absolutely zero idea how to fix. Most of the junk consisted of useless crap I’m never gonna use like bone scrap. Never paid for it again, and I feel justified in cheating if I find a way to do so.
---
Yes but you waste budget by having to use 2 flipped walls, as opposed to just one.
---
probably to not have outrage because "i missed the converter"  but there is already an item to produce fertilizer (brahmin)
---
only thing that makes sense to me, even though the converter is the "more sought after" item
---
LMAO fair enuf i guess xD
---
&gt;	• General: Fixed an issue that could cause Daily and Weekly Challenges to complete themselves automatically.
---
Nice
---
because you are trying to "pacify" it you have to "tame" it ...the word "tame" will actually show up if its tameable
---
well never payed attention to it, it sucks and is stupid lol, thanks
---
If they have hundreds of weapons and armor I’m guessing that’d be like 100 knives and maybe only a few real things lol. I’d be more inclined to go to a lot of plans and ammo
---
Are the servers still currently under maintenance?
---
I’m pretty sure you’re wrong
---
It's been 1.5 years, how dare you expect an MMO RPG game to have such an important feature as a text chat? [How dare you.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/93/12/e6931225b2e021469a4f1cab4db721b9.gif)  
---
PS: Buy more emotes kids.
---
You get some from the pass's ranks, but yeah pretty much.
---
hahahahahahahaha
---
*old man grumbling*
---
its not that simple to just tame a pet. you may want to do a bit more research.
---
Is that what causes it?  That’s interesting information.
---
I could swear it happened before I had that mutation and was actually less frequent after I got it, but I’m not 100% sure.
---
Well, yeah, "fixing" the lack of recipes....
---
Wondering if they are grandfathered in, which is very possible
---
Same thing with one of the Service Rifle skins. lol
---
It just works. (10 / 10)
---
While addicted to mentats, join a group of 3 other players who are all drunk and defeat the Queen in under 10 minutes using only the base type .38 pipe weapons and without any sort of armour to speak of and not using stimpacks.
---
You sound like a barrel of laughs
---
Gotcha. Yt is still not my thing.
---
 If it is a real thing it sounds like a PC problem anyway.  I'm sure the "master race" can handle it themselves.
---
yes, besides the very few from the new system and the other challenges
---
Yeah quite true, they usually use those large numbers as lures to get people to go to their CAMPS. Plans are always a much better go to.
---
The ammo converter is insanely underwhelming before you get your hopes up btw.
---
I'm at work right now and have no way to play for another 6-ish hours but I need to know.  Are the servers back online yet?
---
There seems to be more resentment towards players with resentment (towards the game) than posts about resentment. I can tell you from posting here that the response to any kind of negativity is highly defensive. This post's thinly veiled insults couched as compassion actually make it more insulting - not less. People are here to talk about something. You are just as ridiculous for complaining in this second-hand way, if not more. Negative posts do not deserve less attention or to be relegated to one sticky. The response from the mods and people who comment here have been (in my small experience) highly jingoistic (in favor of the developer).
---
This is the one that has been driving me insane with my Grocer's backpack and my Chem/Drink 90% perk.
---
i would help you with this i am actually the pet finder for my discord , but you chose a bad day for it friend ..today i will be grinding the season
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
No that's different all together. That's just being a douchebag.
---
that might have made it worse..
---
HAHAHA, the whole point of reducing the atoms we get for free, is so we can't afford to buy many items unless we buy Atoms with real money.  
---
This whole "We rework daily challenges with seasons, etc." is exactly what they want to accomplish.
---
That is what the patch notes say. It was meant to address the rampant punji trap griefing.
---
Sorry, that happened to you. Has never happened to me using 5 characters, nor did/have I see/saw reports/stories of it en masse. May have just been a localized very rare issue that luck decided to take a dump on you. Sucks, but it is Bethesda.
---
*One of us, one of us...*
---
If ur on Xbox will u add me my GT is ProzacPromises we can do it tomorrow
---
Youtube has a lot of information. It's just all in video format. To completely disregard all that info purely based on the fact that its a youtube video is beyond unreasonable.
---
It’s the ‘copying file’ that destroys me on PS4.. Zzz..
---
That’s when I got it.
---
I don't need to watch kids on videos to be a barrel of laughs.  It just takes a campfire and some beer.
---
Honestly any new content is welcome. Vaults are always awesome and I fucking LOVED Vault 94 raid. 
---
Sadly they think that making a Season with some shitty rewards is going to keep us content for long.
---
Just a suggestion, if you put a couple of points into the luck perks that have a chance of repairing your weapons and armor in combat (luck of the draw for guns, but I can't remember what the armor one is called), it helps quite a bit with not having to repair as often while still getting the "realism" of having to repair every once in a while, plus you get a nice little mental rush of relief when it procs. I have two stars in each but honestly I found even one was helpful. Just a thought!
---
Finally!!!!
---
with the amount of Power Armor skins that have been in the atomic store, you would assume that Power Armor is the endgame armor to use.
---
Power Armor needs a serious buff and rework because they are are almost pointless to use outside of Nuke Zones. you gain so many more legendary and perk bonuses outside of PA that it just makes more sense to not use PA
---
Does any other game do that?
---
I’m shocked that you’re shocked that they’re shocked
---
I wouldn't mind, but the skin is gorgeous and I'll put it on my Gatling Gun if I get that far, it just shows how the asset designers have passion and love for the game, while the technical/implementation team seem to just want to clock out early.
---
Really curious about this. Had to leave a server last night because somebody was destroying my vendors. They also got a friends vendor as well.
---
Did it work?
---
You’ve go to be kidding 🤦‍♂️
---
They remain, usually. Bethesda just disables the ability to make any more.
---
'Compliment Bethesda and Todd Howard on an amazing bug free game experience with amazing detail and incredible end game' 
---
Im not sure I could pass that challenge. Not with a straight face anyway.
---
that's the one. it'd go so nice with my current outfit. I need it asap.
---
Need to camp glitch to increase pebbles count, watch its getting patched
---
yes, the downloaad  is only 11gb but he need to make a backup of the hole game update/install then delete the older one, you just need to have space to hold 2 fallout copy plus the update, the guy at the other post says it's normal on ps4 to be that way
---
I went on a tear against a bunch of bits that jumped me after fast traveling. While looting the bodies I sadly realized Insult Bot was a victim of my berserker rage.
---
You mean your photo gallery isn't just shots of crops and close ups of Meg's nose? 
---
Nah only kidding I love it too. Makes me snap a good scene when I see one, and even go looking for them somtimes when I get bored.
---
Yeah 11.2gb, 84 mins and then a year to ‘copy file’ PS4...
---
They also patched Electrically charged to not trigger PvP too, they listened for once
---
so at least I've got something to do while the servers are down
---
It still says the servers are under maintenance I install the update
---
Even without Bloodied or Junkies it is pretty powerful, with just a few perks allocated towards it. 
---
I have an Instigating GShotgun I use for adventuring and a TS GShotgun I use for silo runs.  One level so far in each of the Str shotgun perks, rank 2 Skeet Shooter. In VATS, these weapons tear most things to shreds. 
---
Have a little issue with SBs but still drop in about 3 shots or so.
---
A real blast show up at seneca rocks hotel rather frequently.
---
&gt;WHY TODD WHY?
---
A question that Bethesda employees need to ask Todd every time he opens his mouth.
---
Its console wide I play on PS4 and we have it
---
Some of this stuff looks great
---
I never disregarded any information. All I said was I don't waste my time watching other people talk about a game.
---
 If I want to learn something there's plenty of reddit pages and other information I can read rather than watch somebody else basically read it to me.
---
 I didn't mean to get everybody's panties in a bunch with all the downvotes, not that I really care. 
---
Is it that foreign to you that somebody chooses not to and doesn't like to watch YouTube? Weirdos lol
---
PS4.
---
Do you still need to tag enemies for exp even being in a team? Or is this redone?
---
These were easy enough to counter, but a needed change. A trap base is one thing, but when people made stacks in front of their vendors in wide-open areas, damaged them and repaired when you were shopping were a special kind of asshole.
---
Since i don't have the underarmor unlocked yet, and not enough gold bullion, when you login and go to upgrade it, post the new stats it has.
---
I'm impressed
---
My main gripe is them moving away from survival and rpg towards casual and fps.
---
So characters no longer moving makes up for 0 content?
---
EXACTLY! Happens to me way to often, it would be different if their load times wasn’t so long. Got 4 hours to play? Here spend 2 of them sitting at a loading screen. Lol
---
I dialled this and it started singing at me, what the hell
---
Atleast the 4th time if I recall.
---
WAIT SO THAT'S WHY MY PA IS USELESS??
---
Goddamn..
---
Yes but the events never pops when you need it and the spawns are super inconsistent,after wastelander
---
Can't trust the "leaders", says the new leader. Lol
---
Afraid so.
---
Even if you do there is no reward after 100.
---
I don't know for sure but I am gonna say almost certainly not.
---
Hopefully next round they'll fix Blackeye so I don't have to start the conversation with her three times just to give her a bit of meat.
---
Fell for one yesterday, still don't know what actually killed me. Just blew my mind that it was a level 7 player camp and I let my guard down.
---
what purpose would that serve?
---
do you want to bank them for next season?
---
They added under armor mods? Where to you purchase them? Not seeing them on the secret service vendor.
---
Yea I do agree with you, that style of base sucks. I guess there’s no way to differentiate between that an people that just have them stationary.
---
Yeah. I would like to see like longer quest lines. Maybe something that you could further a little each day that you log in. Kind of like Far Harbor esque questline from Fo4. I have never played any games with seasons or actively not partaken in the seasons. So I’m excited to see what it’s about.
---
Don’t understand why I got a downvoted on my question. Was just generally curious about what people would like to see.
---
I'd forgotten about the onslaught of berets, lol. Did they think everyone now has a taste for them after fasnacht?
---
Will do!
---
sometimes find it in one of the locker rooms off the swimming pool room @ bolton greens.
---
I think I picked up one downstairs at WS golf clubhouse, too.
---
insult bot has a hard on for me
---
you've spent *1500* hours looking for one?
---
Fixed multiple areas where a player could get stuck. Like behind a twig? Hows my guy get stopped by a stick? Hes in power Armor and weighs hundreds of pounds extra but is held at bay by a stick on the ground. Or my favorite fall into a crack and float while your bludgeoned to death.
---
Well I may watch that. I'll need to wait on the rotten tomatoes score of course
---
Counting sheep
---
888-488-5878 thanks
---
I've been quite vocal on here and the official forums about the distinct lack of content, especially end-game progression content for groups.  I can be really happy with the bug fixes in the notes (God mode fix is so huge!!) and still want more content.  
---
Honest to Todd sometimes bug fixes get me just as excited if not more excited than new content.
---
&gt;  I sadly realized Insult Bot was a victim of my berserker rage.
---
and rightly so.. I cant shoot that thing in the face to death fast enough.. always shows up at the wrong time
---
the ss isn't good for a Melee build then? fuck I just farm the arms this week
---
I just had a flashback of Manic Minor, Horace goes Ski-ing and Jet Set Willy! (Misspent childhood) 🙂
---
Considering they already had the one made, it was probably trivial to make a dozen more.
---
Thanks, I'll change it.
---
Soo... how many points do I get from public events? Compared to the dailys? Because I wont be able to play next week.... is my whole season ruined? I dont intend to spend atoms on rankings.
---
They're the only two mods I want, currently running just buttressed with no secondary slots
---
This is on every platform - in any interior like a camp, everything appears to be shiny or wet even when it isn't. It has been like this for months, really ruins the image quality and immersion!
---
Some legendary effects are/were broken on certain weapons, like +50% limb damage. When used in vats it does way more damage than it should, to the point where I could one-Shot a glowing deathclaw in vats using a shotgun with no damage increasing perks at all.
---
I got gotted the other day also.  I got on top of one of the rides and it glitched me through a nearby wall and killed me.
---
There was a warning side near the ride but I was like "Its cool" and it was awesome.  I was laughing out loud.
---
 [https://bethesda.net/status](https://bethesda.net/status)
---
So are the servers down or?...
---
Im bettting the chooper blade jetpack is gonna be a seperate thing.
---
It can take hours especially if there is a specific creature you want.
---
I was hoping Bethesda would say something about this seeing most people would probably want atoms to replace them after rank 100
---
This is so good it *should* be used as the brotherhood trailer. Save Bethesda some time, this trailer gets used, win win!
---
Yet you waste your time posting about stuff you have no idea about on reddit trying to be witty instead of doing 5 minutes of research. 
---
It's foreign to me that someone willingly chooses to be so obtuse. 
---
You seem to be the only one salty here. Maybe go enjoy a beer and a campfire.
---
The fact they fixed Wards narcoleptic ass and fixed his spawn location. Waking that mofo up should not be my job, I ain't an alarm clock.
---
Whoa. Head rush.
---
Came here to ask the same thing! I don't *mind* using Leather, admittedly - it's probably the one I like the *look* of best, and the Vanguard's ones I've gotten are better than anything else I've gotten regardless, but it'd be great to be able to actually use the other armors, too. And, ya know, have them actually work the way they're *supposed* to...
---
...speaking of. Totally unrelated, but, wonder if they'll ever buff the Refined .50 Receiver for the Hunting Rifle? It's *supposed* to do "improved damage", but they never updated it when they buffed the base .50 Receiver...
---
OMG, this is so wonderful.
---
I wish they would bring the backpack back to the store. I missed it during a time I wasn't playing. I ordered a mask IRL that I'm waiting impatiently for.
---
Yay no more punji traps
---
&gt; what purpose would that serve?
---
What purpose would dailies serve otherwise? Banking for next season seems extreme, but the dailies becoming useless also seems extreme. I'm curious what will actually happen.
---
Glad I’m not the only one. I thought I’m getting one shotted because my DR threshold is so high it got bugged somehow and wasn’t working as it should. Nerd rage, Med-X, full set of unyielding SS armor, and yet I still go down as easy as if I was wearing nothing at all. Kinda bologna if you ask me. Makes me question if I should even bother with the legendary perk card that gives a boost to your DR if you have a full set of a particular armor.
---
Agree with a lot of the folks on here. I tossed on the flamer mod and use it for events or for random Halloween type goofing around. "It just works."
---
You still get atoms for doing the board game.
---
Secret Service ultra-light and extra carry weight mods when?
---
It still says the servers are under maintenance I installed the update and reset my Xbox
---
And yet, I see no shortage of PA users at the Queen, Radiation Rumble, etc.  Not everyone wants to pursue the meta build, and for them, Power Armor does an adequate job and is relatively easy to acquire.
---
Shocking
---
forget about atoms yo.. that aint happening
---
I was hoping to see some Steel Dawn stuff but the patch notes seem bare in regards to Brotherhood elements.   So I guess I am hoping for a Good Atomic Shop selection??
---
The Wood Helmet has been in the files since the release, though it's wasn't included in any available to players leveled list.
---
Man this list reminds me how big this game is. Good stuff, Beth
---
That's been my thought since day one.
---
A wood helmet is in the dev room but was never put into the game for some reason
---
Well I'm happy for you man, I just don't think encouraging them at all is a good idea but your allowed to do what you want :/
---
Congratulations over opinion are unnecessary. We live in a reality defined by torment, or so it seems to me. So that I rarely find good reason for congratulations, they always seem so insincere and often insulting. Maybe you were fleeing your torment into a passive-aggressive power game?
---
Teams and the rest of the secret service mods
---
This is quite the anti-griefer package patch. Hope it actually sticks.
---
At the very least, will be curious to see what the griefers come up with as replacements.
---
They'll all just go to using the other two unintended damage bugs that aren't mentioned as fixed in the patch notes.
---
They said they patched it last update, which is odd
---
&gt;Is it that foreign to you that somebody chooses not to and doesn't like to watch YouTube? Weirdos lol
---
People aren't downvoting you for not watching YouTube, but for answering with "Yea, I don't watch YouTube" to someone who is only trying to inform you....
---
Not with behemoths, but at freak show I had probably the most intense battle I've ever had in the game with 5 mirelurk queens.
---
I like to pop over there because it has a lot of easy access loot I sometimes need. Usually its rad rats, sometimes mirlurk kings spawn, rarely one queen, except for the one time I was drowning in acid spit.
---
&gt; SO THAT'S WHY MY PA IS USELESS??
---
No one tell him about legendary (SS) armor lol
---
I think the other piece of the exploit puzzle is being able to access the vendors before the camp is fully rendered.  I suppose putting them on the third floor is one way to minimize the chances there, but it is somewhat annoying. (Not that I'm defending destroying a camp to express their displeasure.)  Putting them well away from the edge of the camp site spawn point would seem to serve as well there.
---
That said, these guys are jackasses, and their actions are indefensible.  Gathering materials still costs time and effort, even if you can hit "Repair All" on your camp device.
---
I get the problem and I don't use Healing Factor. I also get it in VTU too!
---
-
---
Always thought waiting until my health / rads settled down sorted it, not getting it as much since I got rid of Regen Armor too.
---
It has nothing to do with your toon.. It's the silo doesn't remember you.... And why should it? It houses a nuclear missile so it seems smart to have the security reset after awhile.
---
That helicopter jetpack skin is the coolest.
---
Insult bots are still there. Sometimes they are on a break and don't insult you
---
It reminds me a bit of the Pepper Grinder in the Alice games.
---
im sure bethesda didnt consider anything beyond their bottom line as instructed by zenimax..
---
youll get nothing and like it.. /caddyshack
---
Have you filed a [support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net) about this yet?
---
How do you do that?!
---
their data files get "nuked" as well as appalachia
---
When you select Move Camp and pick a new location, your entire camp is stored as a blueprint and theoretically yes, you can just place it down somewhere. In reality, it frequently glitches depending on the location of the new camp. I've had it work flawlessly, and I've had it glitch and tell me that I can't place it there (even though it's all green and SHOULD be placeable).
---
They get 10 free atoms if they fix it 76 times.
---
Polish, lives in UK.
---

---
AR-style rifle?!
---
I love it when a friend comes back to the game and asks why the insult bot is gold.
---
It’s because his insults are all gold.  Seems they’ve added a few as of late as I’ve heard 2 I’ve never heard before.
---
Everything you have build will be saved in a blue print. You can place it down at another spot and you keep everything you built. Depending on the complexity of your base it might not let you place no matter how much you fuss with it... But if that's the case you can delete your blueprint and you'll still have every individual item you've built, you just need to place them all manually again .
---
I would check the recent news and patch notes.. which you can find on bethesdas site or the first pinned post in the hot tab on this sub..
---
link to B's site is in the bar on the right side of the screen..
---
I will play devil's advocate here. If a player, while using a non-optimised build and a normal weapon, can kill bosses easily, the game would be way too easy; and there will be no point building a optimised build. Choosing the right perks strategically is also an important part of the game.
---
I would argue that, having a good build plus a good legendary weapon of course will be the best scenario. But if you do not have a nice weapon, then you have to compensate with a more min-maxed build. Alternatively, if you have a god-rolled weapon, there will be greater leeway for you to choose QoL perks.
---
Final note, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI) showing it is possible to kill a normal scorchbeast with a level 1 pipe rifle with the right build.
---
I moved C.A.M.P a lot before I found my current place, and the blueprint situation never bothered me because I enjoyed the challenge that each site brought too the building and changing my C.A.M.P a bit each time too suit those changes.
---
But I can understand how some people get it just the way they want it exactly especially when you see some of the amazing designs some people come up with.
---
You get two barn walls and make sure they are both door frames and place then down at the spot you want then replace both sided walls with real walls.
---
the Stabilizer perk is one the saving grace for PA users and is one of the reasons people use it for the SBQ.
---
and I don't pursue the meta builds, but I have enough random sets of legendary armor to match a calibrated shock motion-assist servo Excavator PA in carrying weight while having weapon weight reduction
---
The last firmware update for the PS4 came out weeks ago, why you hadn’t updated it till now is a bit baffling.
---
Wooby burned it to stay warm at night
---
Bethesda has a Fallout 76 website where all the information is. Pretty handy, you should check it out.
---
I'm with you on the longer, Far Harbor-esque questline idea.  There is an area in the west of the map (Ohio River Adventures) that looks like could be springboarded to a new area to explore in the future.  Hope that is in the plan and does come to fruition.
---
Love this idea one wall to wallpaper both side take my money $$$$$$
---
Any word if the weird rigging issues on the Red Shift Power Armor will be fixed?
---
I read it. It doesn't address my specific questions though.
---
Blueprinting is sketchy at best. It is theoretically possible to move an entire camp by blueprinting it but it just never seems to work out for me. Maybe you'll have better luck but I wouldn't count on it.  If your CAMP has a small footprint you'll have a better chance...  Good luck, you'll probably need it!
---
So basically it’s an additional quest line that allows you to earn special gear. Just something else to do in the game.
---
Says in the patch notes it's one character per account for all rewards.
---
By using doorways and 2 foundations. Turn one wall into a door and you could be able to place another door on the other side but inverted. Once placed both doors can be turned into regular walls.
---
I'm sure they will also fix the Bait Bombs before the next Fasnacht lol
---
It doesn't address the questions I had.
---
Whoever wrote this must be from Minnesota. So much passive aggressiveness.
---
Yeah event locations but other stuff there used to be like 6 caves you could build in I believe you can only build in 2 or 3 now
---
That part confused me because I swear they did that in patch 19 already. Oh well, as long as my Ultracite Jetpack helmet didn’t get deleted into the shadow realm it’s all good!
---
My guess is account based. I think the only character based ones are the consumable rewards.
---
No, but close.
---
Just set it up +1440hrs and unlocked all the season rewards already!!
---
literally every other game does that, F76 is the first game i play that saves its print scrn screenshots directly in the game install folder, not even in their own folder, just drops them there in between the executable and settings files
---
And some Interior crocodile alligators!
---
Find an Instigating Lever-Action Rifle
---
Oh shit, was I NOT getting rep?  That sucks lol.  I always donated...
---
I'm here to downvote Griefers like you lol
---
A neat feature would be a Google calendar you could sync with, with scheduled downtime/updates. I wasnt planning on playing during the patching regardless, but I didnt take note of the message in game. Easy to overlook/not remember..
---
it takes like 3 minutes
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6gFSDSYkcGiWk1FspNzvZZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-kicking-off-season-one
---
Second that. Rocksy was a pain sometimes, but I made 'Don't activate Vital Equipment quest and find Ward-o' my endgame. Who is going to remove that graffito now, and will his veggies spoil or dry up? Honestly concerned.
---
Of Mr. Pebbles,, I can only say this: Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels across the Wasteland, his was the most.... human.
---
Huh! I did not know that. 
---
Well, not surprising considering who we're dealing with.
---
When you move camp, the game blueprints your camp, so in theory it can just be placed down.
---
But - and this is a big but - there is a chance it cannot be placed. Could be down to the differences in terrain from your original location or it could just be for the sheer nuisance of it.
---
If it can be placed thats great. If not then when you have the camp blueprint highlighted press scrap. This will delete the blueprint but store all the components. You then have to rebuild another camp.
---
Would have taken a few seconds and the same amount of typing to inform me themselves rather than say go watch a youtube video about something.
---
 But I really don't care that much to have to go watch a video about it. 
---
 My Original statement was a joke because I never heard of such things as magic items in a Fallout universe.  Whatever they are hasn't effected my gameplay up until this point and it's probably not going to affect me going forward.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
There's some really cool stuff, I hope this grind isn't too awful for the space stuff. Really digging the glow in the dark wallpaper and that projection light.
---
I'm kinda of excited for that chicken coop. I wonder if it'll be for fertilizer, or just for show?
---
Thank you. So it is during normal gameplay (not nuclear winter) and I can still earn atoms for the shop?
---
the less google is synched in things in our lives the better, thank you
---
"If I could rearrange the alphabet I would put 'You' and 'I' together"
---
My understanding was that cosmetics and camp items like ammo converter were account wide while things like caps, repair kits, perk card packs were only for the character you claimed them with.
---
But i dont have a chevorlet movie theatre
---
Dzen Dobry
---
Weird, I only started experiencing it since the last update, and it happens pretty often now.
---
Yup.  Same.  Im playing till I get ammo converter then it’s back on shelf till we actually get content.
---
As others have said it stores what you have built. However, it's very fickle about what it will store as one thing and it can be a right pain to lay stuff down again. Before moving I recommend moving any external stairs or pillars from the stair menu else you'll get 'item is floating' errors. There's probably more that I don't know of but stairs are a definite problem area.
---
Any luck with this? I’ve tried the office in the 3rd floor of Charleston herald 20+ times but just keep getting the same lead pipe or roller pins rolls :(
---
I've placed it at whitesprings just because i couldn't put it anywhere, then i found a right place.
---
They are so easy to acquire, that anyone that doesn’t at least have a decent one simply isn’t trying. Low levels (even high levels) can run leader of the pack repeatedly (it’s probably the easiest guaranteed legendary event) and trade anything unusable in for scrip.
---
Hahaha, that's what you get nerds!
---
no, but you cant come anyway-- no burninators allowed
---
Lol level 300 and still need your hand held..
---
You should feel grateful.  My ISP sucks and still have 3 hours left on download...
---
My only resentment is clutter.  Drives me nuts.  However, if I can poke fun as well....I will
---
Make that announcement I  game take up the whole screen and take 20 seconds to be closed out the first time, and maybe you might have 2 to 3 less posts about the game being offline. On the contrary you would then have 500 others talking about how annoying the message is. No win situation.
---
Ammo convertor
---
yeah.. those caves are going to always be trapped bases now Im guessing..
---
This games PvP Sucks anyway, it's who hits first the other guy.
---
But the servers are down or was I banned
---
I'd really like text chat.
---
The salt and tears from Griefers lol
---
Plus you get some really ugly seams on the ends.
---
I'd expect maintenance to be going for a bit...I'd say keep an eye on the Beth forums.
---
Woah Propeller skin for jumpjets?
---
early game it doesnt get better than Leader Of The Pack..
---
I'm quite flattered that you think my opinion on the patch will affect their current output of content but I gotta be honest with ya, I really don't think anything anyone says on here makes that content come any faster.  Sure, we could complain a lot and they might see it and they MIGHT pass it on to the people who work on the content but I don't think it will change anything.  
---
Idk I post a lot about the lack of group progression content as well.  But in my opinion, if you criticize them for what you don't like then you gotta praise 'em for what you do like.  Gotta have balance you know?  
---
Hang in there.  Hopefully next year is more focused on content rather than bug fixes if they can do a lot this year.
---
Nothing really.
---
I feel you bro
---
&gt;I think what the misconception is that difficulty does not always have to correlate to grindiness. ... If you have a challenge that requires a massive amount of ammunition and supplies to overcome, suddenly the tedium of farming rep doesn’t feel as bad, because the rewards for doing so are given a direction and purpose.
---
Exactly. I want more SBQ and Encryptid type events, but with far fewer bugs and much more incentivized cooperation (and clearer instructions on how the cooperation aspect works). I like that to even *start* Encryptid you have to do a little farming during another end game event that is also relatively difficult to start. These are things that are difficult, and maybe a little tedious, but the reward makes the grind worth it. The reward being a fun, difficult, cooperative event, not necessarily even the loot. I mean, theres really not any game out there that doesn't have a tedious grind aspect, it's just a matter of what's the reward for doing it. Doing the same quest ad nauseum for the ability to make dirt is just not exciting or fun at all.
---
Yes that sounds very bad but I got a laugh
---
Damn i hope so, thanks!
---
End game
---
That does sound like a really cool idea but what would they have to break in order to put this change? 🤣🤣
---
Thank you for going out of your way to belittle me.
---
Craft Buffout
---
Awww yeah Applachian Voorhees here I come!
---
Uhh that was so... fun...  I had a brace of newly sharpened drills, chainsaws, and mr handy blades for chewing through whitesprings.
---
What are you referring too?
---
You mean the same challenges we had since release.
---
Nope. If anything its who has the better build
---
This doesn't help answer the questions/rumors about Atom shop turning to cash only, if this is for Nuclear Winter exclusively, and if the rewards go away after the season ends.. But thanks for the link I already read through.
---
You only demand new content 1x a month? I demand it daily!
---
lots of cool stuff....
---
Thx!
---
Are the servers down yet?
---
Huh, just add a spatial query with your two locations (camp, tent) to ensure there is no overlap when looking for a potential world for you to load into.
---
I actually think power armor is pretty good.
---
Nothing belittling about it, it’s just common sense to make sure your firmware is updated otherwise you’re bound to run into issues at some point.
---
Yeah, it'd be nice if both the accuracy and damage were adjusted to accommodate users that want to use the weapon.
---
The bow is so inaccurate that I eventually give up and toss a grenade out of frustration.
---
You have to turn off everything in your house and then turn everything back on but in alphabetical order for it to work
---
You read the official patch notes and thought it best to get a second opinion from a bunch of rando redditors?
---
pretty sure Ward sold it to them, and is making you go get it back
---
once a raider always a raider
---
&gt;Would have taken a few seconds and  the same amount of typing to inform me themselves rather than say go  watch a youtube video about something.  
---
&gt;But I really don't care that much to have to go watch a video about it.
---
No it wouldn't have... If you actually were bothered learning about the subject you would've known this.
---
These statements make you sound like an entitled prick. Which is also probably why people are downvoting you.
---
Also as a side note, reason why people are citing angry turtle is that he is *the best* source of fact based information around this game and his videos have infinitely better info than you can ever find on this subreddit that is very casual at the end of the day. Well unless the post is citing Angry Turtle himself that is...
---
No it says servers are undergoing maintenance
---
Ya see! That's no fair fight! I'm the only mole miner with a good enough weapon to make that an even match.
---
Well dont listen to rumors....anyways the atoms thing is kinda right kinda wrong....no more atoms for shagging 3 sheepsquatch....thise achievement grant you some  thing called s.c.o.r.e that has 100 levels of unlocks.    Why 100?  Because 99 and 101 are for f*cking commies.   You can get score lots of ways and the daily and weekly challenges are one.  You can unlock levels that give you atoms(1500 total)  so yes and no.
---
sir, this is a wendy's
---
Or PA displays

I hope legendary perks go live after this! I guess I'll just play MHW.

---
Idk what to say man.  It is what it is.
---
So why did you ask 🤭
---
You can manually make blueprints yourself of you want... But if you move your camp it will save in a blueprint automatically yes.
---

---
Oh, ok. Good to know. I guess we'll find out for sure in a little while.
---
It was in at launch, when you could destroy people's stuff and easily start PVP now it is an outdated system that needs an overhaul. It is more an example of Bethesda not paying attention to the effects of their changes than anything else, but you know let's blame people for carrying scrap on them, which is more part of the game than this holdout from when PVP was viable.
---
and so it begins
---
Well that strategy relies on VATS headshots and I don’t think heads have much armor. I used to use Tank Killer but gave it up when I started refining a sneak commando option for my mainly Rifleman build. TK just doesn’t seem to make much difference for headshots. 
---
Also, in the video the guy uses L3 in Concentrated Fire but you really only need L1 to allow you to select the head in VATS.
---
On a positive note, according to the patch notes, Nuke mines should no longer damage neutral targets.
---
I dont think it is it says servers are undergoing maintenance
---
The rusty pick is a pretty good spot for legendary items.
---
Hey what’s the link to the Bethesda seasons info?
---
I find my best items in player vendors.  Just have to camp jump alot
---
Tbf, Fallout 76 is available all over the world.
---
I shouldn't have to (and didn't) look up what time ET time is compared to where I live
---
Free Battlepass. Levels up to 100 unlocking stuff at every level.
---
so wait, are they just updating the servers or is their an actual update i'll need to download later
---
Only 3? ._.
---
stand on the south side near the fence, take a picture of the antenna on top
---
works every time for me, good luck
---
I didnt ask what it was i asked if other people were getting it
---
It was a joke since people tend to ALWAYS ask ....
---
Additionally, if starting the event in the Mire area (the one by the cliff) the SB often fails to reach the event location and the event is auto-failed.
---
Let's see if it actually works though
---
Try uninstalling the game
---
Bruh get to level 100 first and then start asking questions like that lol
---
improved - stability, render, animations (ps4)
---
removed - all workshop bugs and dupe bugs
---
implemented -  I made a post about it but would be nice to use the personal terminal to start all dailies
---
after all that they can work on new content, but hey is bethesda they will take a year to fix all of that
---
Take that you fukng trolls with their fkng trap houses!!!! HAHAAAAAAA!!! up in your +€÷_+ss
---
Bethesda wasn’t making enough money selling atoms and fallout 1st so they created seasons. Instead of getting free atoms with daily and weekly challenges you get score points. You play the way you been playing but no free daily/weekly atoms. You can get a few hundred caps each season instead of thousand the old way. You also get skins for armor you will never wear. Only thing I’m looking forward to is the ghillie skin for your backpack. Maybe the ammo converter to get ride of the 44 ammo stacks in my inventory.
---
.........again!
---
Legendary treats w/ faster "movement" speed. 💩 
---
Sometimes I wonder if I annoy my dog too. Every time I feed her I ask "so what'll it be today? The usual?"
---
lol, to me it's not clutter, critical conversation is what I am here for (less for price-checks/walkthrough or heartwarming stories). I don't understand the hesitance for criticism on a 3rd party commentary platform? Where are people supposed to talk about something? Nothing better ever happens from looking at one side of things.
---
I have not - i'll go ahead and do that. Thanks!
---
I found some for 50 caps last night.  But you still have people selling stuff for several thousand too.
---
It feels like there’s supposed to be a question here somewhere...
---
Nuked zones with high density of enemies and Harpers Ferry Sewers (Nuked)
---
My error has different numbers. What does it mean?
---
I'd keep the structure and audio all the same, but it would be great to shoot more specific live action footage for this. It would really come to life. 
---
Dear Bethesda, help me help you.
---
Do damage numbers cap out at the enemies max health if you one shot it? 
---
For example I'll one shot a lvl 62 ghoul for 2500, but a lower level scorched for 1200.
---
Snarky beak. I’m using that with my step kid. Might just get the laugh required to get their attention. 😂
---
Search it up
---
Hm.  I use healing factor and don't have this issue at all.
---
I NEED those deep pockets.
---
Player vendors
---
Glad you enjoyed it!
---
Electrical Charge should be fixed now also, eventhough that should've been "fixed" when they removed "slap damage". Oh, Bethesda. *sigh*
---
Keep your eyes peeled for the super mutant traveling vendor. He has unique plans as well. Ive been trying to pick up as many as i can lately and he always has interesting items. Not sure if there is a route he follows as i run into him enough.
---
I too, am seeing this on PC. 
---
I've adjusted my settings in an attempt to fix it, but whether I adjust the ini or use the default "high" preset, the issue is still present.
---
should have read closer maybe?
---
&gt; There are fewer Atoms overall up for grabs in this new system, but you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges. As a result, you will still be able to save up Atoms for Atomic Shop items, but you will now also directly unlock lots of new items, including cosmetics for your characters, like Power Armor Paints, Weapon Skins, C.A.M.P. items, and more by ranking up. This wasn’t possible with the existing Challenge system, and we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.
---
&gt;A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. **Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards.** With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
all of the rewards can be seen at https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
I think its highly unlikely there will be rewards beyond the end of the game board..
---
at least until people bitch and moan about that on reddit and they change it to shut the complainers up..
---
You mean the black combat rifle skin? That's unlockable with the season rewards.
---
Not that I know of. I hit the Strangler Heart for 30k+ yesterday.
---
Run the monster mash event. You'll get hundreds of candies with little, to no, weight, and they count towards eating prewar food events
---
Yeah, the notes claim they fixed the damage in VATS so it takes into account how much it was charged at the time you fired it, but it says nothing about how completely *off* the first shot tends to be, even with a "95%" chance.
---
I don't get how atom shop stuff is money items. I see this all the time as a major complaint but, sure, while you can buy atoms, you also get them in game, and it's not terribly difficult to do. The only time I ever bought atoms was when I signed up for a month of FO1, and then immediately accidentally spent 1200 of them on the stupid Fasnacht mask bundle because I pressed the wrong button. So aside from that, all the atom stuff I own has been bought from in game rewards.
---
I do agree though, that atom stuff should be 100% cosmetic and that if you can get a freezer in shop that is in *any* way beneficial, you should also be able to get it in game as well.
---
No its that i wanted to inform griefers that their scheme doent work anymore.
---
I had a fog crawler hoard in the burrows. Chaos.
---
My group of friends and I move camp all the time. If you’re on PlayStation we could jump on and help you anytime :)
---
I would pay extra for that. Fallout Fast. You listening Todd?
---
Understandable for sure, but for people like me who uses google for convenience and dont give a hoot that they know Im playing fallout (which they probably do knowing how often i google stuff related to it), it would be a free/easy way to keep up with when the game is down.
---
Dam where are you the north pole ?
---
Wait...servers are down.  Why didn’t anyone tell me?
---
Have you ever played a vidya game before?
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons
---
No I read it, I was just curious if they had replied to anyone here or in the forums about it and were going to address it
---
Have you begun using apparel that increases your max weight such as the Excavator armor or the backpack? It has issues calculating their weight when it decides where to respawn you. 
---
It could also be very player-specific. I never experienced the fast travel bug until about a week ago. I don't run bloodied like a lot of the other players with the bug are either.
---
What do you use? We can set up some PvP, haha! I’m kidding about that part but I don’t think I’ve ever seen another player that uses MMGs! I was so excited to finally get a little love when we got the candy claws. People may think it’s a weak weapon, but I can take out high level scorchbeasts in two landings and I get more damage out of it in an SBQ fight than I do from my Instigating Explosive Minigun.
---
I think the board ranks are account based but unlocks are character based. Could be wrong tho.
---
I've found that unless you are moving to a very flat area then the automated blueprints are pretty much unplacable, although you could try manually blueprinting separate areas of the camp first which may help.
---
Tbh I prefer a manual rebuild anyway from individual stored pieces. This way you can better utilise the new space, especially for rough ground, and you may find that a blank slate gives you fresh ideas.
---
They somehow arrived at the conclusion we're all French.
---
Mother of god.
---
Congrats!
---
Salty over what? All I'm doing is defending my statements  that for some reason has stirred everybody up.
---
Almost like I am offending you for not liking or watching YouTube or you tubers. Sorry that it means that much to you.
---
As for researching I guess I would have to be curious enough to want to seek out the information which I obviously am not.
---
 My original post was a joke because I've never heard of magical weapons. Now everybody is giving me a down thumb. O well lol
---
I hope they've also fixed the bug wherein your reported carry weight is incorrect. 
---
Tired of seeing 265/275 but still being over-encumbered.
---
I’m wondering if anyone has actually tested it or if it’s just anecdotal evidence being used as if it were definitive.
---
The atom shop becoming exclusive to cash only is just a rumor .. unless they eventually make all atoms unobtainable in game .. but for now you still earn atoms through the seasons
---
So far all seasons are is global (meaning everyone) activities instead of what we have now, the daily weekly challenges .. but most the rewards now are likely items and not so much atoms anymore
---
Could some of the activities be for the battle royale .. yeah maybe some of the daily/weekly ones are .. the only difference .. is in the new seasons you can't progress to the next activity in the season until you complete your current one .. where in the old ways dailies/weeklies we have now, you can avoid it and just not get the rewards ..
---
It's too bad.
---
I mean, yes, the magic shotguns do entirely too much damage.  But right now, shotgun users have to choose between that, or the stupid damage rubberbanding bug.  Considering that the latter has begun to affect way more weapons than the former, it's annoying that they would fix the former first.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/47XE9Dbh3weAd5kusOIA8p/fallout-76-update-20-patch-notes-june-30-2020
---
I think the griefers have access to the same patch notes as the rest of us.
---
The Escape Artist perk in Agility nullifies all movement sound when running (not sprinting), which also means that armor weight has no more influence on sneaking. Other than that, the influence of armor weight on sneaking seems to be relatively small anyway.
---
Yes lol
---
 How is that cattle prod? Ive not seen many people use it
---
only everybody
---
Probably not
---
Is that T-57 Airforce Power armor?
---
Going to hijack this vague post and go kind of off topic to say there needs to be a discord server dedicated to nothing but sharing the location of Graham on each platform and people willing to group with you so you can go visit him.
---
Doesn't that have infinite HP though? Doesn't matter how much I hit it for it always just heals itself back up to what seems like 2/3 then 1/3 then dies on the third wave.
---
Too bad they didn’t fix this back when it was reported, could have stopped a lot of duping.
---
I’m a bloodied unarmed melee, which for regular enemies is often overkill, but can help for the queen when I get max adrenaline and it shoots up to over 7k, and with critical and stealth can be over a 20k power swipe. But an instigating one might be nice for a non bloodied stealth unarmed. Should be able to one hit most enemies if you build for sneak.
---
This exists.  Discord has roles that get pinged when users have grahm. I even hear there is a bot you can set up to auto post it for you.
---
YAAYYY! 
---
The game is fixed! All is finally fine! Woohoo!
---
One thing I've noticed with this approach is that you need to have a floor on either side of the walls. So if you try to do the double wall at the edge of one floor and there's no other floor connecting, it won't work. So I typically add an extra floor then remove once the wall is placed.
---
That said, I use brick walls and not barn, so maybe that's why.
---
No, it even happens when I'm at a work bench.
---
That throws my theory out the window then. I got to up my game!
---
Steam, 3.3
---
Hey more power to ya if you like watching that stuff, I dont.
---
Same here. I don't want to be in PA but I plop it down and hop in every time a death from above notification pops up.  Followed by moving perk cards around quickly because they just keep delaying perk loadouts over and over.
---
I think 5 hours is usually a decent ballpark for the server maintenance. I think k a couple got done in 3 hours. But this one is bigger so I'm saying 5 hours.
---
well boullion is always good for making a mean chicken stew
---
You forgot the tadpole and possum badges.
---
They never do!
---
It just works.
---
Basic fixes! Wahoo!
---
Score isnt currency, its basically xp
---
Agree with this.  Bloody mess is nice for almost any build.  You can also look at the Eagle Eye mutation if you can work around the -4 strength hit.  Eagle Eye gives a natural +25% on crits, so you can trade out the Better Criticals relatively painlessly.
---
The added range on sniper is nice, but it's kind of a fringe case.  It's seldom you have the luxury of sniping outside of the range of a good rifle with a long barrel.  You can switch to braced mods for arms if you miss being able to take long shots without holding your breath.  That's what I ended up doing, because I got tired of the drunken weaving when I tried to aim while saving AP.
---
So the fact that daily and weekly challenges no longer give atoms essentially further  incentivizes atoms micro-transactions as this was the best way for people to obtain them consistently. The amount of atoms that can be obtained through the season rewards is a noticeable decrease when compared to the potential from daily and weekly challenges.
---
Wonderful.
---
Shitty range of turrets. If you use spotlights it increases the range
---
Da dum tsss
---
This really is my favorite put-down ever.
---
Not just because it's vaguely polite - it's not name calling or telling someone to shut up - but because the whole visual of some guy ranting at a hapless Wendy's cashier who just wants to sell you a Frosty is hilarious.
---
Why I'd be done to let someone kill me if that was the case
---
Bold if true.
---
thats nothing..
---
Path of Exile has like 20 currency.. also 5.56 doesnt count since its player generated and not official
---
That's my biggest negative takeaway from this. I like the boardgame bit but the dailies were my best way of earning atoms
---
Please tell me you have a link to this wondrous place.
---
Which God? In ancient Hindu texts there were 33, and 12 Major Greeks (and many more minor ones), and all those other Religions too.
---
If there's anything I've learned from too much TV its that when you beat one God another turns up for the sequel.
---
Speaking of bringing in money, I saw Juicehead on youtube saying allow modders to create content for the atomic shop, I think players would be happier to pay for it if it was community members making it (And also I think we could much better content releases instead of a re skin of the suit shorts outfit)
---
Thanks Chum. I wasn't reading between the lines.
---
The power armor glitch into Freddy Fear’s basement for a 3* robot
---
Did you really have to make a thread about it?
---
As soon as I hear an insult bot or prize bot: Boom. Dead.
---
But I must admit, I do seem to see them less nowadays.
---
it's the little things you know? xD
---
yes how you sayed, only atoms and the entire shop is ugly, so now is better.
---
congrats on being the first complaint before the servers are even active again..

Caps - For playing the game up until endgame
---
Atoms - For cosmetics, skins, and people who want Fancy CAMPS
---
Scrip - To buy endgame gear with RNG as a factor
---
Bouillon - To buy endgame Plans so you don't have top-tier items too early on 
---
5.56 (and other trades) - For endgame player purchases where Caps are largely useless
---
SCORE - To buy yourself extra reasons to play the game once you've cleared everything else

It’s too late . They’ve already went on the record acknowledging that the majority of the player base are giant care bears . It’d be a stupid business decision to reverse direction now that the people who enjoy fun already left
---
I think I can count the number of times on one hand where I've actually gotten *stuck* stuck.  Mostly in between rocks.  They smash these giant rock props against the terrain to form mountains, and they aren't always that careful about how their hitboxes intersect each other.
---
it happens on pc too...and of course, it happens to me, dont know why
---
It's a fallout game man, if you don't like what it's becoming simply stop playing it. They'll do what they want how they want and When they want. There's probably more people that like to play the game peacefully for the fallout aspect without worrying about some random Joe's camp trapping and killing them. I've played since BETA and I still play, it's come a long way from what it was. Does it have its issues? Sure, what Bethesda game doesn't?
---
I'm pretty sure you get it for more things than daily's.  Mabye scan thru the ITV one more time.
---
lmfao, I know, it kills me. OP definitely has some pent up aggression towards a video game...like bud, turn off the computer and go for a walk.
---
why would you do any of this to your fine fellow americans?
---
You're an animal!
---
They'll be up as soon as the maintenance is done
---
So you saw how many upvotes the other post like this got and decided to try it youself.
---
Not so good.
---
I didn’t see anything in the patch notes about a daily cap?
---
Every time someone makes a stupid post like this they add 20 minutes to the downtime.
---
We have no problems with this, low level characters hit it first and then the finisher comes in at the end. If you are all one shotting, then perhaps it would be better to move to a harder area.
---
Seems like you could kick off Line in the Sand finish that and then do Heart of the Enemy and cycle from there instead of going to a fissure site.  SB spawn while Line in the Sand.
---
I can get the chainsaw doing 110 dmg per attack it stacks with some perks
---
It will be interesting to see how many "PvP'ers" complain, actually.  Will definitely separate the griefing pretenders from the real ones, I think.
---
Everyone was dead for a little bit but the faction isn’t dead because they appear in future/past fallouts
---
No... but that’s a great idea. 
---
Reposts never happen on Reddit, we should get some of *that* going.
---
Ehhh, it's a form of currency for people who give zero shits about Caps.
---
Q: ASIDE FROM CHALLENGES, WHAT OTHER ACTIVITIES WILL INCREASE MY S.C.O.R.E.?
---
A: In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. Nuclear Winter Daily Challenges will also grant S.C.O.R.E. in addition to their other rewards. With future Seasons, we plan to grant S.C.O.R.E. through other methods as well, such as through new repeatable content.
---
Thanks for your insight.
---
I mind if the lazy punji board trappers get ruined but there are some creative ones like for example I had someone with bait store options and he deliberately had two greenhouse domes that blocked the vendors and there were numerous ways to enter one that was pretty great was a hallway that led to a vendor at the end of it and there was an invisible wall and death of punji awaits you I thought that was pretty neat. Hopefully these creative traps makers find a way to make a new decisive way to trap others at the end of the day it's just junk that you lose nothing to get butthurt about
---
lulz
---
I see they fixed the carry weight respawn bug but how about the respawn bug where it just keeps circling your corpse and won't let you respawn so you have to leave the server. You're able to use the map and leave game but you can't select anywhere to respawn including vault 76
---
True! My bad, was just the suit which dropped from the event.
---
Sure...
---
You will earn SCORE a bit slower, whats the problem ?
---
&gt;Bethesda wants you to put in long hours to get scrip.
---
#LOLOKAY
---
Account. It’s a camp item
---
Well, it might be, on some practical level rather than a hardcoded one.  If it derives from Daily/Weekly Challenges, you might have to do quite a few Events to make up for your completed Dailies.
---
Killing someone in a trap base than immideately disconnecting Isn't being a raider, attack in the open or GTFO

That was a very aggressive reminder...

of course... and then there will be the times that someone logs in 5 seconds before you with the same camping spot.  By the time the server loads... you are out of luck.  Nothing would be 100% accurate... this is a waste of resources to address.
---
No offense, but it's a stupid post. No one on this sub other than *maybe* the Bethesda reps has any idea, and they're not going to make any predictions because people will just shit on them if they're wrong.
---
*monetized xp
---
I feel like updating should take place at 1:00a.m so it can update overnight instead of during the day when most people play
---
The contemporary building kit for example is for sale. It made me almost buy atoms to get it. Those big ticket items get more difficult to get the more you play as your atom pool gets smaller. Im left with play 7600 hours or kill 1100 robots with a fish for 20 atoms kind of challenges not boil 10 water for 80 atoms. Drug dealer tactics. First ones are free.
---
well yeah but who cares about that junkies smg at 10k. u want that noctural baseball bat 3 stars for 76 caps or the suppressor combat knife for 50 caps. those are my bread and butter so much that i have like 50 3stars weapons waiting to be script. 
---
and dont take the heavy guns, judt the small melee ones, they are light to carry
---
I don't even have an unyielding armor but I am able to get it up to 470 carrying capacity while with Excavator PA I can get it up to 475. when a Backpack that can add up to 120 capacity and does not have anything else but backpack mods competing for that slot, not only adds more capacity than 2 calibrated shocks, it also doesn't take away 2 mod slots on PA that could be used, though nothing is really worth wild besides CS
---
Seriously though, but I’m glad they fixed the Treasure Hunter Hat /s 
---
If only they could fix the Wrapped Cap which has been bugged since launch lol
---
Yeah I ran into that punji board stacking for the first time ever the other day and I was really excited as in over 500 hours of play it was my first trap base.  It was highly obvious when I arrived that given the design of the base that it was a trap.  But I had just dropped off all my junk anyways equipped my first aid perk card and slowly crept down the hall anyways excitedly waiting too see what trap sprung.
---
As I neared the end of the hallway it narrowed even more and I knew whatever was coming must be soon.  Expecting flamethrowers and radiation traps I walked past the trap area and just hear a bunch of noise and was suddenly dead so I said “WTF was that?”
---
Always a curious person I respawned  and knowing this time where the trap was set I was more prepared with my stimpaks, I wanted to know what happened.  So i walked back down the hall, healed myself through the attack this time.  Then the occupant of the trap house didn’t like having me there and kept moving the boards next to me so they would hurt me.
---
I was so disappointed in my first ever trap camp after having seen some of the truly ingenious camps people have made since launch.
---
Maybe I missed it, but did they get rid of the negative side effects from not eating or drinking?
---
FWIW a good handmade is a reasonable second choice, and they're easier to come by.  I run a furious hardened handmade with tank killer and armor piercing magazines and do okay (chews up the VATS AP, unfortunately).  Looking for an armor piercing legendary option so I can lose the piercing magazine (penetrating magazine effects cost more AP to fire in VATS).  But no matter what you use, you'll be throwing a few magazines full of ammo at the big guys.  No help for that!
---
I don't see my issue of not getting sneak criticals in VATS fixed, that's a bummer.
---
Low health unyielding build.
---
I’m in, servers back
---
I'm all for adding more traps to the game, but that punji board glitch had to go. It was an insult to the people that actually put time and effort into making legit trapped bases.
---
Have some at my camp
---
These are all excellent ideas, we need more like these.
---
Maybe, just maybe we should wait until it actually launches before wildly speculating.
---
Yeah, I was just finishing up with it. The explosive bait should've been fixed a long time ago too.
---
The fast travel bug just started happening to me, frequently, in the last week or so. Bah.
---
I'm have two tickets in currently about some very, very, annoying issues I'm having.
---
My shotgun damage isn't registering correctly, just like the TSE damage back in the day, but I don't use Expo shotguns. It shouldn't take me 12+ shots at 244+ damage per to kill a single fucking ghoul. 😒
---
And for some reason my Heavy Gunner is constantly getting disconnected from servers. It doesn't happen on any of my other characters. There are also massive performance drops while playing her. Even just walking around. As far as I'm aware neither she, nor her camp,  are glitched or anything. I try my best to avoid repeatable glitches after reporting them.
---
I do miss the Fusion Core recharge bug, though. It's the only one I "intentionally" used.
---
Well I'm gonna have to find a resource spawn near some train tracks.
---
Actually I always sort by new and decided to try and make a joke out of the people asking about the servers being down. 
---
Apparently humor isn’t allowed though.
---
Either does Caps, Scrips, or Bouillon. But they're in-game currencies.
---
He may possibly be referring to the FO76 Reddit discord linked at the top of the subreddit, but I'm not sure, that discord has some cool stuff in it and I see in people the PC LFG channel calling his location out and offering people invites.
---
You miss out on 2 perk card packs and some junk.
---
It would be nice, but it's also probably wishful thinking.
---
You deserved a nocturnal pitchfork for that experience. At the very least armor with a mirluck buff.
---
Ah ok, well then yeah that's a step down.
---
At least the rewards are nice enough. 
---
This might just be me, but I was getting sick of grinding the same challenges all the time so I'm looking forward to the new system.
---
3.3
---
No, they're talking about the service rifle.
---
Biggest metas I've seen:
---
1. Bloodied unyielding is by far the biggest meta. 
---
2. Bloodied bolstering exists.
---
3. Stealth commando is def a thing.
---
4. For bosses, heavy gunner tank is a thing.  
---
After that,  its everyone else. I'd like to note that you do not need a meta build to be good though.
---
How can you place so many punji anyway? It tells me I can only place 3 total lol
---
It wouldn't be Bethesda if they actually fixed a problem on the first attempt. 😉
---
Lmao I think OP cares more about the cosmetics and camp items.
---
And every patch is different, and different in size.
---
God mode has nothing to do with the duping.
---
It's a budget nightmare. Very likely going to downsize it further, there use to be pews and more lighting to make it a church. Yours is great, and I personally stop and pay my respects to every Mr. Pebbles I see out there. &lt;3
---
"Legal" like being able to place it through objects and such?
---
Yes, a thousand times yes on the hiring the insult bot. Don't like someone's prices, pay a thousand caps to either have the bot go to that camp, or find that player(that might be asking too much though).
---
I'm going to hit you lol
---
Thanks for the tag, we'll take a look.

Please, I and others have been trying everything we can to bring this to your attention for months, including going through (the robots at) Bethesda Support, the official forums, and numerous threads here on Reddit. There have been reported general reflectivity issues across platforms, but there is one Shader bug in particular affecting AMD GPUs on PC that can be worked around by disabling Enlighten in the ini config where every metallic surface are covered in black repeating lines. Here's repro instructions and screenshots: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/412797/bug-zebra-stripes-black-lines-issue?language%255B%255D=en&amp;language%5B%5D=en
---
It is extremely frustrating not to be able to get in touch with anyone and reading the patch notes every time with the hopes that you have fixed the bug, only to learn that you aren't even aware of it.
---
I mean, don't you have internal playtesters using AMD GPUs? It is extremely prevalent in the visuals, in an almost game-breaking way. I can't believe this is still a thing
---
&gt;Fiasco
---
lmao 2 hours into maintenance that typically takes 3+ for major patches and it's a "fiasco"
---
I didn’t know telepathy was one of your mutations, I need to find that serum.
---
Got any for sale at your vendor? Right next to a bunch of common ammo going for 2-5caps a piece I’m sure.
---
If No Man's Sky can add crossplay after the fact with their tiny dev team, surely Bethesda, a AAA studio could... Who am I kidding? They'd find some way to mess it up. Just ask the Steam users how that transition went and that should have been a stupidly simple transition.
---
1 am is hard for the deployers especially if there's issues and you have a family and have to comms over chat, then if you have to stay up till 5 or whatever the next day you're fucked over
---
10 am during a weekday is fine, technically we should all be at work and not playing games anyway at this time, then by the time you get home at 5-6 the game would be ready
---
Thank you for your wisdom
---
He didn't even participate in music night!  While everyone else was off playing instruments, Ward always sat in the corner, making unprompted, paranoid ramblings at anyone who would listen.
---
Thats a thougt worth exploring i think
---
Bigly
---
I remember reading this as well
---
This challenge is the bane of the community. I never make friends in games, gave up on the whole quest weeks ago and accepted i would have to live with the small backpack. 
---
Day before yesterday i was stocking up my vendors, wanted to quit after and call it a day. Some random guy ran up to me, talking french then switched to english. Didn't have my mic ready, so i had to use jumps, crouches and emoticons for conversation. Point was: he was desperately trying to do the revive challenge. So we teamed up, found a molerat which then chunked on me for 2 minutes till i died. Then it was his time to die. We gave heart emojis and split right after.
---
This was totally unexpected and random but yet so great.
---
I have one toon slated to use bows/crossbows, but not until the VATS accuracy bug is addressed and fixed. Currently working with a pistol/VATS toon and it's terrible at best. I often have to search for a server where the the first miss, and subsequent misses, at least work consistently versus randomly.
---
What were the % of people actually acquiring all those available atoms? 
---
Just a honest question: I would not care for some of the challenges since some were boring or difficult to achieve. But my playstyle is really casual i must admit.
---
how does the explosive bait works? i mean...you just launch them at their bases or what???
---
Yeah. It’s a pretty nifty glitch that would totally make things a lot more difficult if they patched it. Best of all, it doesn’t even hurt anyone or affect server stability. Been using it for months.
---
I also experience a bug where if I ADS with a weapon that has a reflex sight, I get a crazy zoom in with that reflex and the dot/circle is huge. ADS with iron sights is fine though. I am on PC btw.
---
I've run Marine Armor since I first got it, and have four legendary pieces with great perks. (Still can't find a legendary left arm.) I love it. I'm just bummed it is so rare in the game.
---
I wanted to replace it with Secret Service armor, but the SSA plans bugged when I bought them, and I can't make the armor for some reason. (I have a ticket in to Bethesda from about a month ago... hoping for some resolution/action on it, now that the first Season is released.)
---
Its just rewards like bullion, xp, caps - things like that.
---
Rewards such as camp items or clothing/weapon skins are account wide.
---
So if the reward you are due for the rank you are about to hit is, say, bullion, ensure you hit that rank with the character you wish it to go to.  If the reward is a skin or camp item then it doesn't matter.
---
The cosmetic and camp items should still be atom shop tied and shared
---
Actually, yeah, that's the general idea! What's rolling out today is the start of the "Summer" FO76 season
---
...and Propaganda Flyers
---
Do not worry, your progress will be rolled back and you will get to achieve those tasks again.
---
Exactly. Do we both get to build the ammo converter or does only one of us get? From what I read it seems only one character.
---
You didn't if you skipped through his dialog too quickly.  I think if Ward cuts himself off with one of his generic lines during that sequence, he would also screw you out of rep.
---
Why wouldn’t they just do it a couple hours before launch tho rip rip
---
People are suggesting Murmrgh at Rusty Pick, which is a valid suggestion. I would still advise to buy legendary modules instead and stock up on them. You will need them to craft legendary weapons such as, gauss pistol, gauss minigun, gauss shotgun and other recipe specific legendaries that needs modules to craft. As well as crafting the SS armor. I used 50 modules to get all my armor pieces with at least unyielding on it. If I was lucky, I would get some other good stat along with it. Which I was for 2 pieces.
---
There are a few deals people sell on their vendor, always worth to check out. Else some events are a pretty good source of legendaries. Radiation Rumble can be one of those, if you are able to one-shot enemies. Once I saw at around 5-6 legendaries spawning. Somes times none. Horde events also can spawn legendary enemies, if you don't kill the legendary (which ends the event). Of course killing the horde legendary gives you a legendary.
---
From their patch notes it sounds like there are nuclear winter challenges too.
---
Thank you :)  
---
I can't build a camp without throwing his picture up in my bedroom as a rule of thumb. Its almost the first decorating choice for me every time. I was so rapt when I saw the plushie on the store. I hope there are more Mr Pebbles items coming back.
---
It's golden goose bouillon stock cube amigo, not chicken.
---
😐
---
You can't help yourself? Just keep digging that hole.
---
Chicken coop
---
&gt;Please Note:  
---
&gt; Turrets are still intended to take 2-3 seconds to acquire a target and begin firing.
---
Considering how far a flailing Ghoul or a Wolf can get in 3 seconds, that seems excessive.
---
Ah well, I’ve been far more focused on Raider rep, for the better apparently.
---
You got my up vote, i lough so hard that i farted 😆
---
Level 230 here, there's a helmet for my Mountain Scout outfit?
---
Awesome thank you. That's were I got confused and mixed up. The bullion and stuff is understandable. Just wanted to make sure that items and cosmetics were account wide.
---
And that is why I showed the video - with the right build, a level 1 pipe rifle can be used to kill a semi-boss, a scorchbeast. I am trying to demonstrate basic weapon isn't really that bad.
---
I havent used anything besides Excavator due to the fact that if I take off my weight reduction perks and jump into anything that isnt Excavator, I will walk at the drained AP pace and beclose to my character's max weight limit. I have weight management problems.
---
The last few weeks I've had this fun thing happen where I'll have an enemy and basically dead, then if I melee them or they melee me, they're magically back at full health.
---
Or enemies just start overspawning.  I was in the Charleston building and had something like 30 ghouls in this room with me at one point. I'm sad I wasn't able to take a picture of it.
---
I like my piercing drill and BPA puncturing board. One solid whack and most enemies are gonzo.
---
Lol hey I'm not the only one that wants the chicken coop
---
I can haz MEAT Week plz..?
---
not sure about a specific date.. but it is cookout season after all..
---
From a former engineer - it'll be up when it's up.
---
That's not sarcasm but truth. Often you'll be doing a lot more than just uploading a single update - physical maintenance, operating system updates, anti-virus, etc etc. And then you have to test it before handing it back to users...and more than once I found issues.
---
It's account wide. The only character specific rewards are stuff like bullion or caps etc. Everything else is like atom shop items.
---
Thank you! I love the outfit but the back is awful looking.
---
Man i do hope we get the Chinese jumpsuit soon...
---
I wonder if bethesda is going to fix the positioning of the backpacks, most of them clip through your outfits.
---
If I keep the scrip, I’m cool with that
---
This is me every time I try to get back into NMS.
---
Someone’s digging a hole? Sweet.
---
Let me go get my shovel, be right back!
---
Oh btw, what are the letters on the wall? Atom shop item I'm guessing, but what are they called, so I can keep an eye out for them. I bought the purple wall letters but theyre kinda crappy, I prefer the neon ones you can get for caps.
---
I can hear the music and the animals being shot right now...
---
So anything anyone trades it's a currency...so add maps, steel, lead, acid, etc.  To the list.
---
!! I'm so confused and happy! 
---
All I've heard ppl talk about are atoms so I thought they were just redoing the challenge systems.
---
For sure!  I'll buy stuff if it's cheap just for script.
---
Thank goodness they fixed the raider punk
---
Yes, if you go to the Atom Shop scroll down you can see a blank spot for the helmet but it doesnt exist in game for us to craft. MULTIPLE devs have commented on getting it fixed. Yet here we are months / patches later for it to be forgot about like everything.
---
What did you just say?
---
Oh good! Terribly sorry I didn’t see them before, my perception is -5 today
---
from the first couple rounds, I didn't look though all though
---
Yes. You can actually see it on the atomic shop. Doesn't have a preview image, you can't select it for Nuclear Winter and, of course, you can't craft it.
---
Been like this for 2 or 3 patches. I love my 3 star vampire combat shotgun more than ever.
---
Her face is relatively ok as soon as you put a hat on her lol
---
Maybe you should delete this post. Post-Wastelanders, I literally never see anyone using this power armor, I own it, don't use it, why? The mods are impossible to find and carry weight is the ultimate legendary stat. Also, apparently they broke the damage effect when they changed it and it does absolutely nothing anymore, so yeah, so much for this prophetic post.
---
In the part it says DAILY and WEEKLY challenges. What happens if you complete the chellenges for the day? You can't get more, what happens if you missed yesterday challenges, you can't get those either. But you can always pay to level. As simple as that. You cannot grind at your own pace
---
It's a glitch there are videos about it on YouTube. It doesn't happen out of the blue or by accident there are steps to reproduce it.
---
You know, I was wondering why it felt like it had gotten worse lately.  Being forced back to Vault 76 even when I had a good 60 points of unused carry weight.
---
Yes, with the Chemist Backpack reducing heavy Stimpaks by such a massive amount, that would make a difference.
---
I had a couple of players (who I noticed are permabanned on some of the forums) try this on my camp, so I packed up and moved my camp over about 10 feet and all of the bait stayed hanging in the air.  As soon as it was gone, they left to hit another camp.  I reported and blocked both of them.  Refilled my tea and saw a character trying to light me up with a tesla rifle.  I was stealthed and invisible in a bush near my camp so it had to be an alt or buddy of the pair.  Nobody else would have known where to go as my camp was down at that point.
---
My games bugged so I can just walk up to ward and hand it over without even finding the guy
---
Thank you for clearing that up for me. When it said make sure you select the character you want the reward to go to because only one reward per character. I was confused lol
---
It’s an ammo glitch caused by swapping weapons while still firing, hope they never patch it because it makes double barrels viable
---
I'm glad the mysterious stranger suddenly deciding to look at the flowers instead of helping was happening to others. I was like, "really?!? You're just going to walk away!?" Ha.
---
I don't have a whoopie cushion but I do have a chair that sets off a rad emitter when sat in. Similar thing.
---
I just came here for all the people complaining about people complaining about the server being down. 10/10 did not disappoint.
---
I had a guy pull the one I mentioned last week. I thought upon dying "oh well, I should have had Light Footed on, my fault". When that happens, I usually go into their vendors and buy their ammo one at a time so they get spammed with notifications. But, then he changed servers when I came back to the camp, and started showing as Offline on Xbox so I couldn't rejoin him. 
---
Until I saw him last night at a queen fight. I went to his camp and he moved it. He stayed on the server, but he moved the camp when I started buying him ammo one at a time. His profile showed numerous videos of him trapping people - which is why I knew what he did with the damaged punji stacks. I hope the coward quits.
---
PC.
---
I honestly have no idea if it's deliberate or not.  But, especially when it rains, everything is so glossy and shiny.  Characters look like they are made of liquid metal, especially their faces.
---
Floors in CAMPs that have gloss, like the parquet floor that was added a few weeks ago, appear to reflect the sky, even if there's a ceiling above them.  From many angles, they just look gray.
---
Bro it takes like 4 hours minimum
---
Yea man I’m hoping it’s right around the corner!
---
If you look at the ATOM shop determines they basically are. If they release atom shop before fixing the mountain scout I'm done.
---
I swear when I download something in a couple minutes i get so happy but happiness goes away when the copying part goes at a snails pace
---
I might be wrong since I don't use it now, but I used it a bit with a batting helmet and the helmet it showed me wearing was not the batting helmet but an outfit specific one.
---
they never say how long its going to take.. and its almost always over an hour
---
Been saying that for over a year.  Not being able to take me Xbox character to the PC is the ONLY reason i'm still playing on xbox instead of PC.  PC exponentially better simply for reducing load times by a huge amount.   
---
Sadly, it will never happen.
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Sometime between now and autumn I know that much, it's on the 2020 roadmap in the summer section
---
I put down a rug in front of the generator, then put a power conduit on top of it. Connect the wire, and move the rug slightly so it’s not in the same place but the wire would still be legal normally. After that, you can pick it up and take it anywhere you like, no mater how many walls and floors it goes through and no matter how far away it is.
---
You shoulda loaded up at Fasnacht. I'm sitting on 13k acid from farming blessed beeswax.
---
I wish loadouts were slated to come out with this patch instead of Legendary Perks
---
Alnost two years and they finally addreesed some perks bot soawning as animated or at all in perk packs. It's something \O/
---
The reason I asked what platform was because we have been investigating the AMD reports you've shown us. I was making sure it wasn't the same issue. We are working hard to address this.
---
Good thing about power armor, is that you dont have to grind and trade god rolls for a nice set.
---
Anyone can craft it, you can choose the mods that suit your playstyle, and it weighs nothing when you're wearing it. 
---
Plus the rad reduction
---
 and damage reduction.
---
 No fall damage.
---
The jet pack.
---
Disease protection.
---
Heavy weapons buff.
---
Massive Durability.
---
Excavator mining bonus and carry buff.
---
And it only weighs 10 when you're not wearing it.
---
It's pretty good, only thing is, we need some better arm mods and also the explosive  vent needs fixing for the legs. Some more mods in general would be a nice bullion reward actually.
---
What was wrong with it?
---
Come to my CAMP, I have mine open for free taking. There's PVP in this game? Nah, have a beer.
---
Nice! Does it work in your camp too?
---
Yea! Like it has always taken 3-4 hours when they patch the game.. Why don't they just say it's gonna take more than 1 hour!!! Goddamnit!
---
Shit, I didn’t know this, thanks op. Time to switch skins I guess.
---
Yes, I’m using it to power my acid extractor.
---
Someone care to explain what meat week encompasses? Fairly new player here, Fasnacht was my first big event, curious to hear about what else we have coming up.
---
Thank god Stanley is finally fixed
---
Delayed
---
Well yes. But the game **TRULY** needs 'Factions' akin to 'Guilds' from other RPG multiplayer games (ESO, BDO, WoW) that right there would be an ultimate game changer along with Created Content (Player created quests)
---
I think the purple haze is something that happens when the game hasn't loaded in the correct light settings before fading up from black.  It usually resolves itself after some time, but it defaults to that garish purple color.
---
It was a Weapon/Armor Dupe involving God Mode, 2 people and a Scrip Machine, essentially both people would get access to the same scrip machine at once and be able to buy back the same weapon
---
It was kinda shady but it seems it worked by the amount of duped Fixers that are on the black market
---
He or she is a filthy raider, what do you expect?  /s
---
Well how am I supposed to make my sweet tato stew now!!
---
You ll have to spend atom then....why do you think they added that option?
---
Im every game, college dudes and unemployed people will have the benefit of being able to play all day everyday.
---
You forgot the 5 different types of tokens too.
---
They never state how long it will take, but rarely if ever is it only an hour for a large update.
---
You get a total of 1500 from the new system
---
Hrm. I'll have to keep that one in mind. It would definitely clean up my camp some. 
---
I appreciate the info!
---
I got some good things here. Troubleshooters 25 Faster Fire Rate, 25% less vats Handmade Rifle 2 days ago. Got a bunch of decent ones that I’ve sold for now over 20k in my vendors probably last week to two weeks.
---
Not likely, but we are definitely mad that Bethesda keeps trying to patch our community out of the game.
---
What’s your counter point? The way I see it, bethesda wants you logging as much time as possible, the more you play the more you need scrip, bouillon, atoms to get the things you want. If it was just fast and easy to get those things not very many people would be playing now. People keep sharing these little exploits to get through the atrocious grind a little easier, Bethesda don’t like that. Atoms are pretty easy, but the grind for gold and scrip is so boringly long, why is that? Because bethesda wants us to keep playing In hopes that we spend money on shit
---
If I may add on... The "Critical .50 Receiver" for the Hunting Rifle was buffed a while back, but the other .50 receivers for it were not updated to match - the "Refined .50 Receiver" should do "improved damage", but currently does less than the standard .50 receiver.
---
Also, I frequently have an issue with the shortcut to switch to the last used weapon (left on the d-pad on PS4) - it doesn't *always* happen, but more often than not, I'll switch from my Hunting Rifle to my Lever Action, then try to switch back, only to find its decided to pull out a knife instead, or even just some random weapon that isn't even on my favorites. :\\
---
Saying how long it will take just opens them up to all the impatient people complaining when something goes wrong and it takes 1 hour longer than expected.
---
They fixed it !!
---
It’ll help significantly reduce the amount of budget you’re using and it means less moving parts for the servers to process. You’re doing everybody a favour using it... :D
---
Cool :) Looking forwards to checking it out :)
---
Should know in a few hours.
---
It's usually 2 - 3 hours. I don't think I've  ever known it to be less than an hour, maybe when they've done small fixes, and the last patch took around 5 or 6 hours.
---
Yeah it's a shame because I have a PA and non PA character. 
---
Sucks that I'll get the PA skins on my non PA character and not be able to share between the two. 
---
Not got the energy to go through it all twice tbh
---
Oh I know right.   I never said it was a good idea...lol
---
The badges! One time it took me like 40 hours of gameplay to get a backpack upgrade
---
How much does your unyielding set weigh? Maybe 15 - 20?
---
Vs the power armor weighing nothing when you have it on, that's one thing people always overlook.
---
I love being able to use it as copypasta so I don't mind
---
If someone has a ln ally at their camp tossing explosive bait will break stuff.
---
Yeah I played the game at launch, I'm sure I have some kind of DLC mountain scout outfit, is there something else with a similar name? I don't know when I got it, I just remember it being there when I started playing the game again after Wastelanders launched, I thought I may have recieved it as a free dlc back when the game was new (like my powerarmour camo paint).
---
Oh, I'm so relieved to hear this. Thanks a lot for the reply. And I'm sorry for the tone, I've just been so desperate to get a response. Thanks again, this is great news
---
Whoa what can you do with propaganda flyers??
---
There are diminishing returns at around 300 DR, the nice thing about Secret Service is the very high rad resist, especially for a Bloody build running nerd rage.  I like that different Armor has different strengths and features, I feel like the Jet Pack is a fair trade-off for some of the mods.  I am not going to be unhappy if they ever add the mods to the limbs, but I can see some logic in it.
---
It destroys camps.
---
For the longest time I genuinely thought he was called Mr. Peebles. I was showing my kid around my camp and I had that poster up and he read it out loud "Mr. Pebbles". I just looked at him in utter confusion. Then I read it too. Oh. (He'll forever still be Mr. Peebles in my heart though.)
---
I kind of wish we had more visually complementary options like Leather Armor, which kind of looks good with any of the other types.
---
Patch notes say Shadowed mods added to ALL armor.
---
Does this mean Secret Service armor has shadowed now as well?
---
Insult bot told me I put a bounty on myself so I could feel what it was like to be wanted :( so yes, he is very much still in the game 😂
---
Yeah, I'm like 165 before picking up quest shit, but if I take off the backpack and turn off the perk, I weigh like 600! I spent a lot of time loading 76's front door.
---
The Slocums Joe Bundle, Slocums Joe Vendor, and the service rifle handmade skin
---
Omg, it destroys me :) today’s D/L was pretty quick as not peak time..
---
Haha that's what you think carebear.
---
What's stealth commando? Like stealth with automatic weapons?
---
Nah, everyone who has one built already gets to keep theres. There are several other ways to build them, they just involve game systems that are annoying to work with. We will still kill you and take your junk tho
---
By hitting level 101 in the new Snakes &amp; Ladders season pass.
---
i assume it‘s Healing Factor since it‘s only a problem for my main char and not others, never said it‘s facts. fact is that Fast Traveling is buggy for some reason and it‘d be great if they could finally narrow that down, is all.
---
They weigh 0 and has a value of 1 cap. Collect them and use them at robot vendors.
---
Sorry, dumb question, but can you explain the crafting of weaponry and adding legendary perks? Been wondering about this for awhile. Doing this with the legendary modules? Trying to research online all I can find is talk about the PA you can craft and mod. Any light you can shed is much appreciated.
---
I thought about adding this very question to my Fallout 76 Unanswered Questions post, myself.
---
I’m 29 lmao, and there’s a couple 10k strong trap base groups... 
---
Noooo not downvotes!! I’m meeeelting..
---
I've a feeling those bundles wont come until the other bundles leave the store, a few of them had atleast 7 days left. I'm probably wrong, but I won't have enought atoms for any new bundles until next week lol.
---
It
---
There's a new Crocolossus mascot outfit, the croc player icon is back and the Mr. Pebbles backpack is for sale again. Oh wait that was just me daydreaming. Shit...
---
It was for us surviving in this game till Wastelanders got released.
---
You okay?
---
Or how about the fact the raider pathfinder outfit cant have any backpacks on
---
It’s originally from FO4 is all I can find from the cannon, but I’m sure someone else knows more
---
That would be great. But also an option to change the char names.
---
For all the Mules out there.
---
(+44) 07651 206583
---
Tell Bethesda I say hi. Yes this is my phone number before anyone thinks it's fake.
---
If you don’t like the whole low health bloody stuff, full health junkies builds are powerful and low maintenance.  Accumulate some caps and go to a discord and buy some decent junkies weapons and off you go.
---
True! Like for example, I have a trail way of trees with lights leading up to my house door, and I have to use three or four connectors to get them all lit up.
---
Hopefully using what you've told me about, I can cut those numbers significantly. Pretty sure there are lots of other ways I'll be able to use it also, that's just the one that I'm going to do as soon as the game's back online. 😍😅
---
Bloodied unyielding is the most powerful, you hit like crazy
---
I find one hitting everything a bit boring, so if you want to be powerful, full health, and still have a bit of challenge, I recommend stealth commando with either a Junkie's or Anti-Armour weapon, and Vanguard armour with one piece of Chameleon
---
Bloodied; Damage increases as health decreases
---
Unyielding: grants up to +3 to specials excluding endurance at low health
---
Junkie's: Addictions increase damage, up to +50%
---
Anti-Armour: Ignores 50% of target's armour
---
Vanguard: Grants up to +35 dr&amp;er, the higher your health
---
Chameleon: invisible while sneaking and not moving (can't be targeted with Vats while invisible)
---
Anyone else “lose” their moth man backpack when wearing outfits?  I can no longer see mine. Instead I have the basic firebreather backpack that comes with my clothes. 😔
---
(Not technically lost, just covered up/not visible over the outfit pack.)
---
Welcome to the Gourmands, friend.
---
Basically. Dont know anyone who does it. Just heard of it. 
---
Also, junkies is gaining some traction.
---
Hang on....I've seen that number...on a rest room wall in Watoga....offering.."Personal Services"......
---
I get diseases out the ass while still wearing PA, which is stupid since you are in an airtight suit.
---
Secret Service chest piece now gives Non-PA users a jet pack
---
and the Carry buff should be on all PAs, not just the Excavator IMO
---
the arms should have a stabilizing mod to reduce the recoil of weapons, therefore, increasing accuracy and reducing recoil and weapon sway for snipers. you are a walking tank that can lift a minigun and fire it with no issues yet the shocks in the arms cant absorb recoil and stabilize your guns? because let's be serious, who in their right mind is going to use the rusted arm mod on PA to do unarm damaged when you could get a 3* deathclaw gauntlet that could kill most things in a single power swing if built right
---
Pshyeah, well the raiders in 76 are the nicest kind around. I guess he’s going for the earlier fallout raiders.
---
And it also means you can put your generators in less accessible places, like on the roof in workshops...
---
What are servers? 
---
*pops a mentat*
---
Oooohh... gottcha
---
if you get that i want a midevil castle set. i want a moat and drawbridge and WIZARD outfit
---
So they finally patched god mode.
---
I kinda figured maybe I should’ve posted in Fallout 4 to ask them but yeah I knew it was from that game.
---
Eh we’ll see. I gotta make a continuation of my godmode XP glitch I posted so the XP can be used to fly through the season. I’m sure a method for godmode will be found :p
---
Although people that use godmode in PvP are scum.
---
Get rid of scrip and just make the purveyor and machines use treasury notes or bullion. It is meant to be a THE new currency after all.
---
I do think you should be able to update when you wanna update and still play the game either way....Like, bieng able to update my system while im sleeping would be nice, but these jack asses wanna always do everything in thier own slow ass timely manner as usual and during bankers hours....Lazy ass people
---
You got my hopes up, I was super excited for a crocolossus mascot suit! maybe someday tho lol
---
You need twice the space to update anything on PS4
---
When you compare it to other MORPGs it really isn't that many different kinds.
---
What's wrong with that?
---
Haha
---
i have over 700 treasury notes atm, caped as selling 20 per day im making more then i can spend. only way to get rid of them is to stop playing.
---
Weird. But kinda sweet, might respec my sniper a bit.
---
Swing and a miss.
---
Especially due to the receiver. Seen a video of it being reloaded, the magazine clips through the body when being inserted
---
The tail that wags the dog?
---
"Hi, I'm Dick Shale. You might remember me from previous patches like Patch 7, and Patch 19. Patch 20 is sponsored by Abraxo Cleaner: When you really need your floors to shine, go with Abraxo!"
---
Well 4/6 of those aren't even tradable. Each has a distinct use, so that's the point...
---
Got some wetsuit mod plans from an ally quest last night. Did not know that was a thing.
---
Most people who have complicated trap bases using the electrical systems don’t keep them up for very long because of how fucked the systems are. There are few things as aggravating as having to spend 50 circuits every other time your camp spawns in because the fecking switches are set to default spawn as turned on even when they are turned off. If Bethesda removed punjis they should have fixed that.
---
When did they say it was going to be fixed? You are the first person I’ve heard say that. I also don’t think there have been 3 patches since mountain scout outfit was released?
---
When can we see a quality of life update for CAMP building? It has to be the buggiest thing in the game since launch.
---
Beth here. Hearing you loud and clear. Lower the available scrip from 150 to 80 on legendary machines. Thanks for your input!
---
Everybody is somebody else's NPC.
---
The skins are account wide like atom shops skins.
---
no way to know till the 15th when I can use all my stored up atoms to just buy Lvl 100 and ill let you know
---
Yea cant wait. I pulled my ammo out from my vendor last night. Got 15k 10mm 1600 syringes 7k 38 ready to go as soon as dispatch finishes
---
If anything this patch will make PC even more hell once people with the kill hack which is apparently untraceable decide to spread it and griefing gets even worse lol
---
I know that some people will just switch rifleman out for commando for sbq and the like.
---
developers don't necessarily make a ton of money, unless you're senior or very senior, and what you win by just sitting down and doing your work you lose from a lot (and i mean a fucking lot) of stress
---
you are constantly hounded for updates by ungrateful people who don't give a fuck about understanding what the issue is, they just hammer you with platitudes such as "get it done" or "make magic happen" or "i don't want to hear that"
---
you work constant overtime hours because you have no alternative until your brain comes up with a way to implement or correct whatever fucked up issue is now introduced in production because your manager didn't listen to you when you told them that this issue WOULD BE INTRODUCED IN PRODUCTION if they kept doing xyz moronic thing, instead they just told you "let's get this done" and "i don't care, make it happen, we'll fix it after"
---
you end up getting panic attacks from hearing your manager's footsteps or hearing the call for a meeting, it's just...it's like working as a doctor for patients who spit you in the face at the end and tell you i don't care that i've been smoking a pack a day for 20 years, get my lungs FIXED NOW
---
Haha that’s awesome that’s why I love the community events. I’m still dripping fasnacht masks at lower level players camps just to spread the love.
---
Donuts and canned coffee
---
Fucking awesome. Job well done!
---
I hate going to the prison because it takes the longest, usually have to hack a level 3 terminal. It’s almost/perhaps worth a server hop to avoid.
---
Most of the others I can power through pretty quickly.
---
Aw no!! I encountered her, took the toy, felt awful when she reacted to that, tried to talk to her to give it back but it must have glitched because she was no longer able to be interacted with to talk to, then I panicked with the guilt thinking this was a set in stone thing, fished it out of my junk and literally left it as an item drop back on the grave. I felt TERRIBLE.
---
The season. Finally something to do in this dead game
---
It’s coming this summer. Not with patch 20
---
Oh, nice! Thanks for letting me know
---
Also, people were doing pretty interesting things with covered pit traps using confetti to make the illusion of a floor. Bethesda patched that too (god knows why).
---
I understand that, I bought a new card twice and it didn't increase any SPECIAL stats
---
You have discovered an exploit that increases the ammo capacity of most weapons, it's pretty fun when you have a bloodied explosive dragon with 200 rounds in it.
---
Not reading this, waste of time...
---
with the armor weight reduction perk maybe 10-15 so that is about right. but when I get out of my PA, I have more carry space left on me for example when I am in PA I might have 450/475, and then if I get out and collect my PA, I have about 432/470
---
Ask Joe, he is a mod. Want me to ping him?
---
I played the beta and then didn't play until a month ago. It's so much better it's ridiculous. I can't even imagine having played for the past two years or however long. Literally everything I've done has been part of that big Wastelanders update. I'm guessing there just wasn't even a game prior to that?
---
So it is still down, pfff
---
Checkout r/FalloutLore as well!
---
That’s only got in game currency and consumables. Outfits as camp items are account wide.
---
survive != survey
---
Yea I had a feeling it would be considering Bethesda is struggling with a few other issues right now but I hope we get it in July sometime.
---
It's more appropriate when you wake him up and he's stuck halfway through the top bunk when he says it. Like, if I were the rest of Foundation, I wouldn't be touching that situation either.
---
Si
---
Jesus. I never thought of switching out my main damage cards for other damage cards. Been playing since beta and that never occurred to me. Switching out 3 cards is ez. Especially with them.both being perception.
---
insincerity and mockery, the height of wit
---
Idk if that is a main issue with the game, lots of online games and MMOs have lots of currency types the main issue people have with them is the daily caps, most think they need to be higher or out right removed.  it would be nice for all the tokens to lose their weight and get moved into the currency tab, this would cause them to lose their tradeability though. Treasury notes should be in there too it makes no sense for them to be misc.
---
Or rather than getting scrip you just gave the weapon over to the purveyor and they give you a different amount depending on wear/quality/ value just like when I sell a gun to the normal vendor. 
---
And no limit for the day or at least double it to 300.
---
Servers are down but this post is going up ⬆️
---
The audio files for it are just beeping and clicking noises with some robotic music, no voice actually
---
Oh I was thinking summer would mean higher thirst drain, tracking heat index, less rain, longer days, etc. 
---
It looks like its just a rehaul of challenges.
---
Bring up the servers! Try getting this out of your head.  https://youtu.be/QXPAZJvbH1s
---
No one takes dmg from a fatman and i feel like udont understand how serendipity works and it sounds like afoodbuild also 1 shotting a sheepsquatch isnt even that hard
---
How? They removed all the pvp lol. Also, trap camps can’t follow you around the map like pvpers. Also also, you can just nuke them or hit em with explosive bait. Trap camps are the most inherently fair and limited form of raiding possible.
---
Its all about the level. I really can't fathom why we have any items that can't be found or crafted at the maximum levels supported in the game. "I just can't get over these nightmares!"
---
Put it on imgur, post the link here
---
Go to imgur, upload and edit the link into your post.
---
pfffff
---
Riiight that’s where I saw it! I guess we’ll just have to wait and see then.
---
Someone said put it on imgur and then link the imgur in the text part of the post
---
you have to post it to an image host like imgur and link it here. this sub doesn't allow picture posts for whatever reason.
---
you're a waste of time
---
Yep. Depending on what other cards are. It's pretty simple. For a while I switched out my slugger cards with heavy gunner for sbq. Quick and easy.
---
Chicken coop!
---
Chicken coop! Chicken coop! Chicken coop! Chicken coop!
---
"Hunny, that's no molerat that killed your cat and we need to start running, NOW!!"
---
They do
---
You’ll know you’re at the point of no return when you are down to only these two Wastelanders quests: “Siding with the Settlers” and “Siding with the Raiders”. Do all the prep quests for both sides until you get these to appear. Then you can make the choice and you’re good to go.
---
Nothing. Was hoping we'd get the whole "no longer needing to eat or drink" thing with this patch, but it looks like we're not. Also, they didn't say anything about the colossus event. So, nothing 🙃
---
Let me suckle the teet as well friend.
---
In the last update, they mentioned that those things would be coming. It is strange that they could add them now for the Under Armor, but not for the SS armor, but hopefully it'll be soon.
---
Lol love you too babe
---
Good idea, might post there and see if they can come up with anything. Maybe I’m going too far with a simple outfit but my curiosity helps with “muh immersion”
---
I dont disagree, however my memmory is there,i dont have to visit the terminal to inform me for the procedure,or to go to the medical station to learn how to make a card.
---
Lol. That’s what I get for reading quick on a sneak.  I’ll let my shame stay.
---
Insert Chicago Musical 
---
“They had it comin! They had it comin! They only had themselves to blaaaaaame”
---
Thanks mate, you literally just changed the game for me. Now we just gotta wait on those card loadouts.
---
Shes just a bullet sponge no real mechanics to the fight anymore. Just hop on someones tent and shoot everything the queen. Theres no this to take down shields or that to make her vulnerable. Just point and shoot. Rarely i see a queen not go down. That’s usually a bunch of low levels that cant do any real damage or have no ammo and just run around. Its have bullets show up not a raid boss.
---
&gt;you even have a raider group in 76 called the trappers?
---
🤣
---
Oh yes, the Trappers.  The ones who materialized magical punji boards to instantly kill any player who trespassed in their domain.  Wait, no, that's not how it worked at all.  They all ended up dead.
---
&gt;If you don’t want us in the game, fine.  But you can bet we will be canceling our fallout first membership and I  know I will not purchasing future Bethesda games if this is the  direction you choose.
---
Boo-hoo.  Take your ball and go home.  No one cares.
---
Or you know and actual trading system where you can trade items for items, you know, like you can already do with robot vendors in the game...
---
Forgive me if you're joking but being a lonely survivor could madden the mind a bit, resulting in wacky stuff like that so it's not entirely out of the ordinary to have something similar
---
I may be asking a stupid question, but why was the patch over 60GB on my PS4?
---
I agree on this. I would like to see this bug fixed, even though it is uncommon for me personally.
---
https://youtu.be/QXPAZJvbH1s
---
Also, this. https://youtu.be/QXPAZJvbH1s
---
I was thinking of doing a PSA about how lighting your PS4 on fire during download would damage the data.
---
god kill me
---
Every 15 minutes an event pops up called "Primal Cuts" in 3 different parts of the map.  Killing the enemies rewards primal meat the quantity of which depends on the difficulty of the zone eg the Forest rewards less than The Mire.  Every hour Graham's Cookout starts where you place meat on the grill and then do a series of tasks to keep the status bar filled.  When the event goes live expect detailed posts as to what you should be doing and please follow them.
---
Bloodied or Junkies Commando + Stealth build. Melee is ok, but it doesn’t match the raw dps
---
I always do and found a bag with one in this morning when I did the quest.
---
This, a million times, *this.* This has seriously been my single biggest complaint *since the BETA* \- it's very easy to end up with builds that one-shot everything, even by accident, and it gets very frustrating when you end up missing out on XP, *especially* at lower levels. And it might not be a big deal if it's, say, one low-level and one high-level teaming up for an event... but if you have a group of four, all trying to run through the whole game together? Well... our group only last a month or two before we got too frustrated with it and split up to playing separately.
---
Gotchya yea I should have worded that better because at this point I knew it wasn’t coming with patch 20 haha. I am hoping it will be sometime in July rather than august. I just loved seeing everyone in the lobby in one place made for some fun and interesting times!
---
Ah yes the Minnesota Nice I’ve heard about
---
I can't remember but I really hope the mothman backpack is one of those with time left on it!
---
Or, for that matter, a scorchbeast screech.
---
we just got two more "currencies" with this update. i don't imagine them consolidating any time soon, and frankly, wouldn't be surprised for another to be introduced when the brotherhood DLC gets introduced later this year. its their way of adding artificial longevity by preventing you from using anything you've spent time earning prior to that and forcing you to spend time grinding the new thing.
---
welcome to the internet.. hope you enjoy your stay..
---
Hey man, thanks. I was already going for that when i was still playing so i think i'll continue that route then.
---
So I didn't read the entire thing, but to me it looks like they're adding a battle/season pass, and no reward tiers cost real money other than atom points if you want to speed things along? Can someone confirm this for me, because even though season passes have been known to kill games in the past, if the "season pass" is free and only costs time to the dedicated player, than this could be fantastic, because they'll still make money off of people who buy tiers, and those of us who dont spend the money have the same access.
---
TL;DR: All season rewards are free? Someone please confirm this.
---
I've been finding myself using my Junkies FSS Sheepsquatch Club more and more. It hits almost as hard as an unarmed weapon but faster, makes a pleasing clunk sound, is literally on fire and I never run out of AP with it. It also can be used in power armor and doesn't require me to swap perks to switch to a shishkebab to heal.
---
I took rushed glance at your username and was like damn imagine if Jonathan Torrens was just out there ripping around with a super sledge and da bois
---
I've not seen Real Blast there in a while so I'm guessing it got fixed then broke again. Insult bot is definitely around. He caught me earlier and made the joke about me only using my pipboy as a flashlight. I was using it as a flashlight at the time. Endgame boss wreckage right there.
---
Joe doesn't know, only Bo knows.
---
When you say the sneak meter does not appear, are you also referring to the armor not activating its cloaking effect? I have been seeing that on occasion, though I have not been smart enough to attribute that to swimming if that is indeed the cause.
---
Thanks man, i'll start trying that aswell because it does sound more appealing then the low health stuff.
---
Chah-leeeeee needs her greens!
---
I run a Stealth Bloodied Unarmed build.
---
[Here's my build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1833fb&amp;d=sg2ss2s92sv2sf2p00eu0eh1es2cu2ir2am2ao0ar2aj2a04lu2l71lt2la2ej1&amp;m=0512cfegh3&amp;am=182031-182a35-182738-18213b-182035&amp;wp=w0&amp;wm=142133). It's not "the best" but it works for me. Hit ghouls for 6900+ without chems.
---
Wait..so it only works if you an ally like Beckett at your base?? Hell if I knew that I wouldn't have took my whole base apart
---
Nope! I’ve been wanting them to implement it for a while since it’s essentially like the Brahmen pen. Really happy for chickens
---
Yes, the glossiness isn't the same issue as the zebra lines.
---
Negative effects of not eating or drinking will be removed before the end of the year
---
You are correct sir, my suit does not activate either.
---
If you're that interested in finding exactly where they said it about the time the outfit came out 2 different devs commented on post about it. I dont have the time to track down the specific threads but if you want they are there for you. I also believe lady devann made a comment about it again last patch or the one before.
---
Roses are red 
---
But tulips are bigger
---
Please stop calling
---
Paige a n -
---
I reckon they'll be down at least another hour 20 mins
---
I don’t care that they removed a broken part of the game. I care that they didn’t replace it with anything and keep removing things after we’ve adapted from their poorly coded game.
---
This fall they’re removing negative effects for not eating or drinking.
---
PAs must use Vault-Tec's Interdimensional Carrying Case or V.I.C.C. for short
---
Did they fix the weapons dup!!!!
---
I guess the lack of limb plans for SS Armor was intentional if they're adding plans for the underarmor but not for the limbs
---
You still have it? I'll buy it for what you paid for if you want the caps back lol
---
That...would actually be a good idea.
---
In the interests of being helpful, for anyone absolutely frothing at the bit for the update to finish and resorting to learning TikTok dances while you wait simply calm yourselves by checking the status of servers here  
---
Just want my camp a bit more lively and having a chicken coop would be a nice addition, I have it comes with chickens that roam around, and isnt just a building that produces fertilizer
---
Didn’t stop them from introducing a ton of responders and free states stuff...
---
Don’t you toy with me. Don’t you give me hope of the NCR growing stronger in this game and then crush me when I get home today.
---
I’d like to see a screen pop up when you join a world stating that your RNG will be trash on this world, would you like to find another world or continue.
---
Thanks alot for the info, definitely good to know about because i was hoping to still have a bit of a challenge.
---
Same here, guessing that we just have to wait a bit.
---
"players find a way to generate content and rpg experiences within the game"
---
"bethesda removes it yet again since their atoms customers dont care for it"
---
It was super helpful to me yesterday with an encryptid event. Had 140 rounds loaded into my vampire explosive laser rifle.
---
Cry about it some more. 
---
I can only imagine how toxic you are irl if you threaten to quit 1st because you can’t grief people.
---
My he forever rest in the stars
---
More like a homerun.  The truth hurts and I see I struck a nerve with you. 😄😄😄😄
---
I have searched and never saw any sort of mention, especially 3 patches ago (before the outfit was even available). Sorry I thought you were citing a specific comment.
---
Makes sense sounds like it, pic is up
---
I hope so as well
---
Also the electric switch didn't work on mine so I had to wire a step plate between the electric box and the door and you have to send power directly to the wall to power the keypad on the outside.  I can make a post with a picture if it would help
---
Can confirm, I’ve been avoiding swamps ever since it first happened.
---
Wow wanted to grind for this here soon,  guess I’ll hold off on the gauss pistol,  damn shame.  feels bad man.
---
Whats the discord
---
Cool, sounds fun. I will make sure I know what I am doing before I participate :)
---
So annoying seeing everyone complain “ i got attacked” = griefing
---
Damn....then fuk it, im taking allys apart when im not doing any of their missions....THANKS a fukng lot mate!
---
As many others have pointed out, the deathclaw on deathclaw island isn't tameable. The two tamable ones I've found since Wastelanders have been due north of the fast travel arrival point for Firebase Hancock (there's a gully if you turn and walk north) and in the parking lot at Cranberry Glade.
---
This right here.
---
Dude I was so disappointed when I finished the update then saw the servers were still down. I wanna grind for that ammo converter already
---
Aww sweet!  Where was this posted?
---
They are removing the effects
---
Oooo I need that Service Rifle Skin
---
Thanks, that build gives me somewhere to start
---
I have one Weapon reduction effect, which helps, and I use the armor reduction perk. I feel like you should have those effects on when you enter PA since it shows you with the armor on when you get in or at least the under armor
---
Ta
---
Nah, it's the stuff like scrap boxes and caps/bullion, perk card packs that only go to one character.
---
The unique unlocks are for your account as a whole, like the Nuclear Winter rewards
---
"Salad Father"
---
"Geck Getter"
---
"Flood Control"
---
Not since Shadows of the Colossus has the cognitive dissonance rung so eerie
---
Nuking Fasnacht had zero impact on the event unless you  you were AFK/  rubber banding. Or maybe if you were very low level and had not obtained any rad protective gear.   Fachnact was nuked multiple times for me and I just slipped into my Chinese stealth armor and finished the event with no problems.
---
I can't remember exactly what they're called and with things down I can't check at the moment but I'll update this after the servers are back. What you can't see unfortunately is that these letters are buggy and some sink into the walls too much, which can make them a bit wonky looking, but maybe they'll have fixed that soon. They're still better than when they came out, you used to barely be able to read them on brick walls.
---
Ooh, the SCORE bar looks pretty :P
---
My quad tesla had over 600 rounds, so fun. My gauss mini holds 650 and that's what I switched from during queen fight. I put on quite the lightning show.
---
Lol they are insanely out of touch, I hope someone writes a tell-all about the development and roll out of this game. The stuff going on behind the scenes has got to be insane.
---
But now you’re resenting a post about resenting players who are resenting - to which I am now also resenting.
---
Yeah.  Alot of people use power armor with heavy. Most due to the stabilize perk, but any armor works. A full vanguard ss with heavies is quite tanky.
---
Wait what? South Africans play Fallout?! No way! I mean I only learned yesterday that Africa was a continent, not a country. (sarcy)
---
Fair enough.
---
SHADOWED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
&gt; it's not terribly difficult to do
---
That's changing. In 3 months you could get around 6,000 atoms for free by doing the daily and weekly challenges. You'll only get 1,500 per 3 months under the new SCORE system.
---
Hehe, I know its not much, but its something right!
---
Unbelievable the amount of downvotes the truth is getting and wrong info is getting upvoted.  Welcome to Reddit..
---
&gt;when I started playing the game again after Wastelanders launched
---
This is why you have it - anyone who played the game before Wastelanders launched received it for free when it was added with Wastelanders.
---
dope.. were you able to play at all?
---
But...the only things you have to do is find card, go to the scanner, erase card, and input your data on it. There’s nothing you have to do in there that involves going to a terminal to tell you how to do it.
---
There's an interesting case to be made here about player agency and the comparisons between real world currencies and videogame currencies. Even in real life, currency as we know it only has value because we all agree it has value, not because it actually has practical value as an object. It's just paper, after all.
---
no worries yo.. they are gimping survival aspects..
---
time to start campaigning for no more weapon and armor damage next..
---
Decided to run a pistol/vats build because I hate myself I guess. Are there any “magic” configurations that would help pistols? I’ve heard shotgun type weapons benefit the most, so perhaps a laser pistol with the splitter mod would be possible to buff?
---
Nah, I'm with Bethesda on this one.
---
I seem to find every single dead spot. I would say every other game session. If there is one in the area i will get stuck in it.
---
I'm genuinely surprised. Usually I get lots of downvotes for this sort of thing.
---
I think OP is my ex
---
ok
---
Shit was so annoying
---
Nuking Fasnacht had zero impact on the event unless you  you were doing the rubber band thing and you were  AFK.    I have never nuked the event, but it was nuked several times when I was playing.  I completed the event in a nuked Helvetia with no problems at all wearing Chinese stealth armor.
---
While I have never done it myself, I am fine with nuking Helvetia because of all the people using rubber bands to go AFK for hours.  They want  to reap the rewards without actually playing the game.  That is a scummy practice that is not much better than  griefiing, as far as I am concerned.
---
Totally understand! The wikis don’t have much details on it as well, but there’s diehards who knows some of the most obscure stuff out there!
---
Nah, mate it's an error client side. No link to the server at all, a blank canvas.
---
RIP you beautiful creature.
---
I havnt seen yet do you guys know when it's over? I'm ET time
---
It really does look great, I run full Marine with the wetsuit and helmet. The Secret Service backpack from the Atom Shop works well with it too.
---
It’s underwhelming for DR but it has held up well for me in all aspects of PvE.
---
The biggest gripes I’ve got is that it took 1.5 years for the helmet to arrive and it gets to love in terms of skins. Or a dedicated backpack. Also it would be nice if the helmet sealed into the wetsuit and the light worked. So it’s like they haven’t worked on it at all. Regardless of DR.
---
Best way around this is to occasionally take the workshop at the food packing factory and get yourself a heap of salisbury steak, then put them on your favourites along with purified water. Whenever I notice I'm thirsty or hungry I just hit the hotkey for my food or drink and continue on my way. I know you mentioned this, but getting yourself a huge stack of one food type is the only way around it.
---
Woooow! That was amazing. (I usually hate fan trailers)
---
This has nothing to do with how difficult legendary items are to acquire.
---
B r u h
---
They also mentioned that you would earn score in other ways such as completing events.
---
Bo Boddy
---
I'm pumped to get home from work and load up after the update! But please, PLEASE consider fixing the chainsaw in the future. As it stands it's unusable and it's a shame. Increase it's level cap and add it to the legendary loot pool! Anyways, good work Beth!
---
Its amazing to see your first camp then how it built up with time
---
Flair checks out ;)
---
Sounds good to me.
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
It's a skin since it'll be in the Atomic Shop, similar to the Chinese Assault Rifle skin for the Handmade Rifle.
---
Just means inventive trap camps will be around instead of this low effort BS lol
---
Totally agree.  I just went with it.
---
The USSS armor didn't have a shadowed option.  It's why I went with thorn armor over it.  (IDC about the jet pack.. ya I know I'm the only one)
---
I too hope they both fixed shadowed and fixed it not being an option for some armor.
---
The only reason it's done this way is because if you got bullion for doing events, once you've got your cap you wouldn't bother doing events any more. It's done in a way that allows you to stack and make it a little more worthwhile.
---
Stashing my vendors and displays the moment it goes live
---
it only took **20** updates.
---
Intestines.
---
Imagine having to use traps to kill players lol. Switch off pacifist and quit hiding. Pvp is still part of the game.
---
Riding Shotgun event has a guaranteed legendary too. Sometimes there’s more then one.
---
Yeah I'll look into it when we get confirmation of when its coming, I don't have many people to play with, but the group finder will change that!
---
you're so smart and righteous.
---
if others get to be super heros, spacemen/women, cops, fireman, mpnsters why cant i be a knight or a wizard? you want to be GI Joe. its only fair
---
I’m gonna be sad if there’s no slacom joe pink sprinkles skin especialy for cryolator or gauss minigun skin
---
 i take the card in the gym ,go directly to erase it and it doesnt let me, it stays to the "learn how to bypass security" stage until i read the terminal.
---
YOU ARE INSANE, do you really just wanna spend about 15000 atoms just to get to the level 100?
---
"current" as in the fake one that someone made up to troll the dupers? That one? 😂
---
It's almost like this is a fantasy game where what makes sense in the real world need not apply. Sense &lt; Fun
---
Good explanation. I guess it it fits the scavenger or scout sort of look. Kind of rugged, outdoorsman sort of outfit. Thank you for your insight.
---
maybe the bullion is the friends we made along the way
---
Could do a Public Team, now that that'll be a thing
---
OK so we finally get to convert unwanted ammo, which is very, very welcomed.
---
However, still:
---
\-Duped items and duping methods persist.
---
\-Magic weapons bug persist.
---
\-Apparently the damage bug where the damage numbers are shown but you don't actually deal any damage also persists.
---
\-Apparently the damage bug where the enemy heals up dealt damage still persists.
---
\-No text chat.
---
\-No proper trading system.
---
Now with the bugs and dupes I can live with because those are unintentional from the developers' point of view (although the ones I listed heavily affect game play and should be addressed ASAP), but the two most glaring ding dang problems of the game that are the lack of text chat and a viable trade system where both parties have to agree &amp; lock down the item being traded are \_still\_ missing, and these features should've been in the game since BETA.
---
I'm beginning to think we're never going to get these two most basic features of an online game.
---
I have had that happen often. I can't say I've isolated the instances to water/land, but I suspect it's been due to server-side latency/lag. I've been noticing a lot of stranger-than-usual glitches the last week or two when the server I'm on is slow.
---
Paper money used to be backed by gold. In fact they were originally IOUs for gold. We're just cashing in our IOUs
---
Yasss boi
---
Let's because why question logic on fallout 😔
---
To keep or not to keep..
---
Is what is most frequently asked
---
While scrapping your collection of teddy bears
---
That consumes 99% of your stash
---
Relax. The servers are down for the update.
---
Yeah, my concern is that it's really something like this - now all armors have it as an option, but it continues to not actually do anything (outside of Leather Armor).
---
Also, check out the YouTube channel for Angry Turtle, he has the most comprehensive stuff on FO76 and a few videos that specifically cover junkies builds
---
That was always the problem. When the game first came out, I had a group of friends who tried to run through the game in two groups of three players. Eventually everyone just started running on their own because it was getting annoying trying to get everyone roughly equal. Even more recently with other friends that have tried playing since the Wastelanders expansion, its hard to keep people interested because they basically end up needing to run solo to level up efficiently. Getting an xp share like this would probably make the overall experience that much better.
---
asking the real questions here
---
Bethesda like doing things backwards :)
---
should be up within the next 30 minutes or so. Now's a really good time to buy it
---
Unless I'm mistaken swimming takes you out of crouch, so just crouch again when you get out of water. At least that's how it works for me.
---
Usually two or three hours, it started at 10:00 a.m. eastern standard time however today's update is very large for the Xbox and PlayStation so it may take a little bit longer.
---
*eels and escalators
---
Watch angry turtle video  on laser pistol, its magic , if you have a magic attribute such as 33 vats, bashing, or limb damage and a quat beam, in vats you can 3 shot a scorch beast
---
Long enough. They're putting in a fairly substantially sized patch right now and some new features. This isn't really a regular circumstance.
---
No - you're just banned.  Todd sees all.
---
I've seen someones attempt at a castle, it's a good start. I'd love something like this, too. The dried river bed would be great for crashed ships as another theme as well
---
But we already have text chat!*
---
(*) on PC, with 3rd party mods, without explicit statement from Beth about which mods may be a bannable offense.
---
You can pretty much use any wall you want, i did use metal wall and it went okay.
---
Yep, steam updated a few hours ago but servers still on maintenance as of 17:53 GMT
---
Worth noting that if you die, you only lose junk/scrap items. So if you're not carrying any (stash first), and weren't planning on buying any from their camp then theres's no real downside from dying.
---
Theres's some lovely camps where the vendors are indoors, and I love checking out the intricate imaginative ones.
---
&gt;I was hoping they would change, it seems all I do is drink and eat, my player should weigh 1200 lbs from all the calories.
---
Darn, this is annoying. I have my CAMP in a lake because I farm purified water, so every time I travel to it I get placed in the water.
---
Mine also
---
That's what I'm doing and the armor won't activate AND it won't even put me in sneak mode. My character just hunches over and walks about plain as day lol
---
I'd like to see that.
---
they said placeables and skins work like atomic shop items. so account based
---
For the right price
---
Yeah, laser rifles make no sense. Plasma weapons atleast have a magazine of cartridges you can replace instead of one cartridge. Although we never see a half emptied/ varied amount of cartridges in a Plasma weapon mag.
---
I never noticed this, but I don't use the CSS much outside of nuke zones, will have to check it out once servers are back up. I wonder if it could be some kind of electrical malfunction from getting wet? More likely a bug though.
---
If they did that the stash weight may only be 800 lb across all of your alts including yourself. However, a container with a limited weight perhaps is an easier way for them to go.
---
"You will begin “The Legendary Run” at Rank 1, and you can advance your position on the board by earning S.C.O.R.E. **through your Daily and Weekly Challenges**. **These include** completing Public Events and leveling up your character. "
---
Does this mean that the amount of S.C.O.R.E. you can earn from gaining EXP and completing Public Events is limited per day/week?
---
*is that a fucking vendor bot FINALLY?!/*
---
Ahhhhhh so if I start making gauss shotguns need to look for that effect or is there othernlnes that cause it too? ;)
---
Some's salty.
---
It will take as long as it takes.
---
I’m looking for potential friends
---
Hey all, I know this one can be frustrating. I run deep pockets on all my armor as well! We're hoping to get this one in as soon as we can.
---
I will say, I haven't come across many trap camps on PS4 in quite a while but I do enjoy finding them randomly to see stuff. May have to invest in some sneak perks to screw with some trappers, already have freefall armor so they can't drop me to my death but I can still set off traps which would still be interesting
---
I’ve never had that happen so.... 
---
I’ve also played since day one and launched countless nukes.
---
No, it works, there’s been an influx of B2525 fixers on the market recently
---
Interesting, never had that problem. I'm on PS4, if that makes a difference.
---
Scrolling through "New"

Who the fuck is this passive aggressive BS aimed at? 🤣

No problem! These in-depth analyses are actually kind of fun to write, so I'm glad someone else could get something out of it

 &gt; Hey all, I know this one can be frustrating. I run deep pockets on all my armor as well! We're hoping to get this one in as soon as we can.
---
Building a trap is not griefing, it’s literally in every other fallout game, there is no impact to dying (you dont lose any real items or in game progress), and the game has a built in mechanic in the way of nuking the base to get revenge. If you don’t like what happens to you when you go to my camp, then dont go! The camp can’t follow you around the map or onto other servers. You want the post apocalypse to be a shopping simulator.
---
This happens to me each and every time I enter water deep enough to take me out of sneak mode and only in those instances. Idk how it might be affecting others but Glassed Caverns was a pain in the ass (as were areas before it) due to this.
---
That’s wonderful! Thank you for acknowledging at the very least! :D
---
It's a matter of limiting what players can do so that Bethesda at the present time can keep control over what's occurring. Many times things get hacked and everything goes out of whack.
---
Me too lol
---
There could be a couple of scenarios that makes sense.  
---
Perhaps it's store in short-term RAM and gets wiped during the Silo reset sequence due to long-term data storage damage.
---
Perhaps on-site biometric cards were for emergency one-time use.
---
I was going to say that it lost connection to offsite storage, but it's clear that the other silos are in communication because they know that you have already entered a valid code at other silos when you launch multiple Nukes.
---
[i use this picture when people question comic book logic.](https://imgur.com/qbWBU4M)
---
It can also apply here.
---
I never really had a problem with eating and drinking. I got a water purifier so I got as much as I need and I just eat whatever random meat I find and cook.
---
Yes they do. I found 4 Unyielding works best for my stealth with one having sneak and 1 Chameleon armor piece, along with sneak 3 and a fixer. Works fantastic. Every point of Agility gives you sneak.
---
Congrats on being among the first people to see that bar on the normal servers. Totally useless but completely cool.
---
Yeah I can see what you mean. It’s all just a bit much I think, extending the daily/weekly endless loop
---
PSN QuietusMD - pull up
---
Not in the patch notes, which really makes you think
---
This is a major update, I’d rather they take time to QA before opening it back up.
---
Check here for status. 
---
Honestly, I hope we get a dlc that adds brotherhood npc's and enclave npc's and let it give the option to join either side.
---
I know you can technically join either side already, but it'd be really cool if you could actually fight against the other side.
---
Alrighty cheers :) New character shall be fun to play then
---
ultra light &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; deep pocketed, also missing.
---
My cat approves this message.
---
Yes, killing a player who you lure into your camp by selling shit is griefing. Do you even hear yourself? 
---
If Bethesda agreed with you, they wouldn’t have nerfed it.
---
In theory, yes, but I personally don’t see much of a difference. Maybe in PVP but I have one Cham/HTD piece, a fixer and maxed out seak...I can walk up to any enemy and shoot them in the face and still get sneak bonus’s 
---
Even the SBQ when stealth isn’t bugged.
---
this is nothing compared to something like WoW which has literally dozens and dozens of currency. Let's not even get started on the dozens and dozens of reps to grind.
---
thats with "one wasteland" roadmap has it pegged for "fall"
---
No, they DID give Atoms for auto completed challenges if you made a ticket. This happened to me three times and all three times, my Atoms were given to me.
---
The only way I can find to stop it is to go in the pip boy but I have the view changed to the power armor one for speed, only works in normal view of course
---
Why?
---
After Encryptid I lose the stealth cloak, I bet it was the water near the cabin. Dang
---
Croc backpacks were duped as well.
---
Does your mother know you talk this way to other people online?
---
find me a nice high rock formation. and build my castle Greyskull. me in my wizard robe using my flaming sheepscuach staff of justice! banishing the evil monsters and demons created by some evil magic. or me dressed up as the black knight laughing and saying tiss but a scratch everytime i die.
---
If they made it a separate stash, they could just put the trade/vendor restrictions on it.
---
A little too frequently in my opinion.
---
It was the only thing I was logging on for - do my daily / weekly atoms. I’m still excited for score but it means I’m going to have to be way more careful with atom purchases since I don’t really have disposable income to buy atoms
---
And explain how this has anything to do with the script machine??
---
They made a post on fo76 subreddit to recruit. I overheard some of my guys talking yesterday about some other hardcore role play groups that are recruiting from the forums on the Bethesda.net website. You can even join groups as mothman cult members, the enclave, or even Chinese spies. I would check there first or maybe think of starting your own if there is a faction you like best.
---
Yeah they changed in to pay to win atom shop now
---
Thanks for your psn! Imagine caring ! Lmfao. Go stack some punjis, oh wait! Lmao
---
I recently encountered a neat "trap" camp. it was a simple design: it had a big manor-like building, so pretty big, but only on one floor. The vending machines were all the way to the back, so i go and check the first three and see that there's a fourth one a little bit further on the back amidst the smoke of the recent mothman smoke machine. I thought to myself "what a lazy way to position the smoke machine". Before i know it i'm falling down a cliff. The smoke was hiding a missing floor tile and the building was designed to make you not realize that it extended off a cliff. I barely survived thanks to the jetpack secret service chest, thanks to which i was able to "fly" on a rock of said cliff.
---
Potentially, but this only happens to me when I enter water deep enough to take me out of sneak mode. Puddles and shallow streams don't cause this for me.
---
yes please, just do it. even fair to say it should be pretty easy to ensure some items cant be traded between characters, as if that is really the biggest problem we are worreid about.
---
What does the shadowed mod do?
---
&gt; VATS: Charging weapons, like Gauss weapons or the Bow, now correctly deal damage based on how much they were charged when fired in VATS.
---
Does this mean more damage at 'max charge' now, or less damage for quick shots?
---
I can't count how many times I wish I had the ability to use a rope to climb up or down a freaking cliff face
---
Probably another hour.  On rare instances, it's gone longer, but 3-4 hours seems typical.  These kinds of prolonged downtimes only happen about once a month when a major patch is dropped.  They've done a lot in the past few months to implement a hotfix system that requires minimal downtime (if any).
---
The method allowed for duping of legendary gear
---
Alright that was one of the main things I curious about, if I could walk up to stuff and tickle em without em going gung-ho and overkilling me because of wood
---
Cheers :D
---
Yea but I think trade is secondary, the main goal from their standpoint is to extend the grind not shorten it, thus I don’t think they will allow legendary sharing among characters of the same account.
---
outfit/clothes backpacks are used instead of the item backpack on clothing items that have its own "backpack" by default.  its worked that way since item backpacks came out
---
If you can get fluorescent flux relatively easily, upgrade it to prime reciever. You can make 308 prime in much more efficient quantities :D
---
"Shitpost"
---
Oh absolutely, keep doing it! It just helps me to get a better in-character understanding for immersion purposes.
---
Behind giving me a reason to keep logging in at all. This is probably my biggest problem. Granted, I’m not on pc.
---
At work. What was the download size?
---
😄😄😄 Love the sarcasm and yes I am.  Mission accomplished. I'm done. Have a great day.
---
one wasteland, currently pegged for fall
---
fallout first atoms i never used, challenge attoms i never use. getting levels gives atoms. so roughly it would cost me about $40.00 to buy the atoms im missing. maybe less. even if i was insane. its my money. i have nothing but me to spend it on.
---
Wait, who’s Beth?
---
Just unequip and then re-quip it should work.
---
A good indicator of when the servers are back up is the 100's of new threads saying the servers are back up.
---
Improves stealth in dark areas.
---
When they released the yearly roadmap info
---
Servers are down on PS4. Check the official status site!
---
Mine was a water-cooled bone saw and it definitely auto scrapped
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Hahaha. The update permanently has her leaning against the school bus.
---
It makes \*some\* sense.  At the end of the wastelanders quest you likely have some gold bullion that you gave to one of the factions (or split it). Based no Smiley, some other gold bullion had been smuggled out at some point too (Based on characters like Smiley)
---
So most people are using the treasury notes for stuff.  You are the only one who goes out of their way to get the gold bullion backed by the treasury notes.  If you give it to the Secret Service, they put it back into the pile.  If you use it at one of the factions, I’m assuming the NPC then trades it somewhere to get treasury notes. 
---
Of course, we get treasury notes (and all quest rewards) to appear out of thin air after doing something like events, so I honestly think this is not the biggest inconsistency in the game. (Though up there)
---
Some outfits just don’t show the backpack.
---
Yes.. there was a week where it was more than every other base (the ones that weren’t had crap items also) and since I only really care about bullion anyways I’ve since stopped vending
---
Unless you have personally done it, I don't believe this one for a second and shouldn't be spread. I want the real problem to be solved not some fairy tales. The real problem is how easy it is to spawn stuff in this game heck they can spawn stuff that isn't even in the game.
---
I thought that public teams were suppose to be 8 people?
---
A side effect of flamers not dealing fire damage is that they don't proc friendly fire on players or NPCs post wastelanders change which I can't imagine is working as intended given that the image on the perk is the vault boy holding a flamer. Haha
---
no
---
Oh blimey! Now I'm having an existential crisis! 🤯 
---
NURSE!
---
Yes it’s up, mine is updating atm
---
No problem :)
---
For example, I run AA Stealth Commando, with a Prime (superior damage and bonus damage to scorchbeast and scorched) Anti-Armour +50% Crit Damage 15% Faster Crit Fill Fixer
---
I hit 70-80 with each shot on the Scorchbeast Queen, and 200ish with a Critical Shot, getting 2/3 crits per action bar
---
I almost solod her but she kept flying too far away (because of my stealth I think) and her health regens to full, I had her almost dead 3 times -.-
---
Just get the carnivore mutation. 
---
It doubles the benefit from eating meat and means you can eat it without cooking it with no worry of getting a disease.
---
Shadowed is *supposed* to just improve your stealth in shadowed areas, so honestly, no, it probably wouldn't be *as* good as the Stealth Suit... *but*, you'd still be able to get close, while having much better defenses and the benefit of other legendary effects as well. The big question, though, and the reason I said "supposed to", is that, last I'd heard, it was bugged, and only worked correctly on Leather Armor - all other armors already had the Shadowed mod available, but did not correctly apply the improved stealth effect. *Hopefully* this is fixed now, though...?
---
I prefer atoms so i can choose where to spend them them instead of forcing me to take items i might never use.
---
Yes it’s free.. this has been confirmed for ages in other articles
---
Is launching a nuke at someone’s camp griefing? 
---
Is killing someone and taking their workshop griefing? 
---
Is one shot-ing the legendaries at events so others can’t get items griefing? 
---
All of those are in game and seem way more problematic than losing 10 pieces of junk. Require a lot less work and creativity too. Stop trying to take risk &amp; innovation out of the wasteland.
---
yes, the season pass is free, all the rewards in the pass are free, and all future seasons are free to all 76 players.
---
the only pay part of the pass is to buy the next tier for 150 atoms,  which is disabled for 2 weeks after the launch of each season
---
tldr: your assumptions were correct
---
Of course we do :)
---
I was just about to ask that.
---
Then I say good luck with that. The endgame grind is tedious as hell. Weeks go by that I don’t even log in. Anything they’ve added new is good for a few weeks at best. 
---
Instead a long grind, how about a fun one. As it is, the incentive to get the exact same item on a different character because that’s the o e with the appropriate build is not enough to keep me interested. And I doubt I’m the only one.
---
But once you enter the code the first time in a week or remembers that.
---
&gt;**Map:** Teammate markers on the Map have been enlarged and animated to make them easier to identify. Additionally, teammate names and player icons now only appear on your Map when you hover over their Map markers.
---
Would it be possible to do this with Friends as well?  There are times I want to look for my friend and while I can fast travel to them, I’d like to know what they are up to before I go harass them.  Even just a different color would be great.
---
I just  holster the  weapon whip it back out and reload it. If I run out of ammo it will quickly reload itself and skip that sticky animation. So shoot till exhausted.
---
For me, it was the only motive to keep login in every day. I didn't play for an entire week when i had the bug that auto completed all my challenges.  
---
As for the challenges, i managed to do 80% of them or all of them if i could, except the level up, fuck that one.
---
I have noticed too that if you are swimming and jump (I have marsupial, maybe it enlarge the effect) it plays the running animation instead of the jumping. For sure is something wrong when switching States after swimming.
---
Thanks for the tip! I still hope they just fix this. That's an easy enough fix for roaming the wasteland but this puts you in some seriously sucky situations on some quest lines. It's almost as annoying as the radscorpions that glitch from caution to danger when my agility is 10, my stealth perks are all maxed and I'm in a dark area standing 30 meters back.
---
I'm on PS4. I keep getting the [4:8:2007] code &amp; it says Servers are undergoing maintenance
---
Maybe it has to do with location? I'm on the East Coast
---
ITS OK I CALLED 911 AND THEYRE ON IT BECAUSE I HAVENT LOGGED IN IN A LONG TUME AND ONLY HAVE LIMITED TIME TO PLAY TO MY FAMBILY LIFE AND CRIPPLING DEBT
---
probably.  I just notice it more b/c it is close my camp, so I see it whenever I look at the map.
---
Probably august because holidays but I don't know because this year is holiyears.
---
same here, I'm sad couse I had to uninstall another game the only game I had that isn't in need of a patch to play
---
[https://bethesda.net/en/status](https://bethesda.net/en/status)
---
Just 2c
---
Gunsmith is needed if you don't want to repair your exploding weapon everytime you reload.
---
To have to move my C.A.M.P # of times.
---
Pretty much.
---
Who’s hiding in pacifist? Troll
---
Thanks to the punji board nerf, ***I NO LONGER HAVE ANY INCENTIVE TO GET FALLOUT 1ST***
---
Kinda it's a PlayStation problem for everyone who has a almost. Full hardrive
---
There’s 10weeks
---
There is nothing to do anyway in the endgame, you could probably easly complete the challanges and get to at least level 50 fairly quickly, without spending hardly earned atoms, but this is just my opinion.
---
Don't back straight up go side to side or jump in the air and you could do the animation while in the air you'll get good at it trust me.
---
Sometimes I have to bring my gun out for it to work.
---
For fertilizer. Hopefully we can have it and a brahmin up at the same time. Will make a neat little farm
---
i think there is an armor effect that actuates it as well? harder to detect while sneaking? check out angryturtle's vid on it
---
Feel free to add me Newsman77.
---
It's a PS4 problem and not a Bethesda one unfortunately, it is incredibly infuriating, but there is no solution other than getting an external hard drive/SSD.
---
my guess? to "drip feed" stuff while we wait/they work on the next major patch (one wasteland long term, legendary perks/collossus short term)
---
that way people have stuff to grind and are "not bored" in the meantime
---
Please add this because those suitcase spiral staircases are a fucking sight sore. I almost pity the players that stoop to this for a ritzy appearance.
---
Nice quick and dirty breakdown.
---
Excited for what?  There's not much new content anyway.
---
PlayStation has always made me do that. I have a Xbox one x 1tb and a 2tb hard drive but my ps4 500 gun I would have to delete stuff just to update it and then I could redownload it but that ps4 crapped out and I got the 1tb one and haven’t had that problem yet. But I mainly play on Xbox anyways but yes it sucks
---
The only thing worth spend time to unlock is the ammo converter, the other rewards are meh.
---
Sounds good on paper until you realize that as a sneak you already have more sneakiness than needed. Especially when you use unyielding. 5pcs of it and you don't need any sneak cards to hide in plain sight.
---
Ah okay, thanks.
---
Stop browsing Reddit and go to work, please.
---
Nobody really knows for sure
---
in the described scenario of their hotfix the turret needs to be already destroyed, they said they only fixed the delay after you repaired the turret until it would start firing again.
---
&gt; But you can bet we will be canceling our fallout first membership
---
How do you trap people on private worlds? Or are you on public servers and collecting the junk from dead then using the junk stash from fallout first to store it?
---
Vertibird! 😉
---
Yea but I wanted to check out the new SCORE system &amp; Tuesdays are Atomic Shop update days. I know it's not much but gotta enjoy the little things.
---
I'm not following :( did you mean to reply to Mr Fuzzy?
---
I've seen that others will delete their current install and reinstall as a work around to this PS issue.
---
Also, tell me you are not, - in the defense of - Beth-menu-manipulation-as-gammery-esda - , resorting to an appeal against clutter? my fren, it's probably not the visual clutter?
---
Artisan will repair to 200%, gunsmith will make sure that it'll wear down 60% slower.
---
You keep it up and Todd will port Skyrim to it
---
I have a ton of comments on this thread about why.
---
To be honest secret service underamor getting shielded.
---
UFO pack with two placeable teleporter pads would be cool.
---
chortle
---
isnt modern warfare already 300gb ?
---
A+ to this post
---
Yes my mistake.
---
They really need to add another 2 settler dailies and another raider *atleast*, who thought 1 daily wasnt going to get stale?
---
Launching a nuke is ineffective tho because you will see the nuke and leave the server with no harm done. My issue with trap camps is since you can no longer damage camps there’s no way for people to defend themselves because I doubt you would actually engage in pvp.
---
so patch 21 in a month and a half from now
---
That's neat and all, but I have my limited playtime right now, and I really cannot wrap my head around how long it takes them to deploy patches. You have to click next twice and an ok, how long should it take?!
---
It's also a disservice to us, Europeans, it's literally our prime gaming time, can't they patch it at 2 AM or something, when no one plays?
---
I don’t play modern warfare solely because of that.
---
Good point/reminder for sure! 
---
Unfortunately for me, I obsessively vacuum all junk within a 5 mile radius of my current position. I commonly exceed my encumbrance by 100’s of lbs, relinquishing my ability to run, and relegating my poor motman cultist to a state of perpetual out of breathness (not a real word). I usually never set out to go shopping, just stop by to window shop if I’m in the neighborhood. I’d probably benefit from making some preplanned shopping trips alongside C.A.M.P. tours because I know I’m missing out.
---
its the way the update works.  
---
download the file, perform a full backup of the existing installation, decompress the installer, install the update, verify the update, delete the installer, then delete the backup.
---
Its the full backup that requires the space (and takes most of the time)
---
I installed a 2tb drive in my PS4 a long time ago, so no space issues at this time.
---
I did my own build and without chem/food buffs my gun in stealth does usually 2k-5k per shot depending on circumstances (automatic reciever). Thats more than enough to kill almost anything in one shot. Stats look: like that 1/15/2/4/3/15/15 if I remember correctly.
---
Thank you for the response.
---
gottem
---
Have a TSE 50 cal.  Can confirm.
---
That only Mothman knows.
---
Now let's see how long it takes them to fix the enemy's god mode. 20 patches and counting
---
Then you win. You can stop playing.
---
that's an amazing story - this game is so team-oriented and I find it so difficult to find ppl to play with. I'm so hot &amp; cold with this game I'm just forcing myself to play at maximum allowable levels. Be sure &amp; add me, I usually play un-mircophoned but I'll hop on &amp; crush some objectives with ya!
---
Same as the other guy, laughed my ass off as an OG cannibal.
---
handmades, fixers, levers, and lmgs.
---
I want to try out the plasma caster for old time sakes...
---
This may be my favourite idea on this sub.
---
Yeah, it doesn't add much. No, it doesn't increase the QoL... But, it is a really nice bit of flavour.
---
Nice bait stinky
---
But fixing this does not make them any money?!!? What are you expecting?
---
I guess it differs from person to person, i personally haven’t found this game boring, because of all the stuff I can do with the stuff I hoarded lol. I played hundreds of levels without using vats, now I’m just trying different vats guns in different situations. I don’t know why lots of people complain there’s no ‘endgame content’, what exactly is this fantastic endgame content they be looking for? Bigger boss? PVP modes?
---
I have uninstalled FO4 to save some space for patch and there's nothing i can play right now, hah.  
---
FML, why is it taking so damn long.
---
Unfortunately being at 30 agility means it will do fuck all for me.
---
solid, I'll add you late-ro when I'm hop on.
---
Let’s let them fix the main game before putting more games into it.
---
that's not even close to what it takes to deploy a patch to production...you have to bring down services, databases, deploy, reboot, check everything, fix issues...that's not even beginning to describe it
---
IMHO, this game is easy mode and you don't need max DPS...mobs die fast/easy...there is zero death penalty sooo for regular solo questing have a quality of life build with all the perks you say don't use.  Also have a high DPS/survivability build as you describe but for those special cases where you need it, say SB queen, but even there I regularly have my quality of life build and there is enough group DPS to kill queen...game is easy mode.
---
ok, so I was not the only one who had their control stuck in the tv.
---
Their soothsayer is on break today, sorry.
---
Thanks for downvotes! To those who have 4:8:2007 error - you have incorrect date on your console. Change it to current year.
---
Lmao

You sure it's not saying it can't place your Tent?
---

Damn, people were joking about having it all done before the update even finished but seems like you went beyond the memes and actually did it
---
It is silly, I had a Mirelurk bump into me and walk around me and stayed hidden with no sneak perks except escape artist.
---
Christ...
---
Who wrote this, my wife? I feel shamed by it and I KNEW the servers were going to be down for the update.
---
U still need this plan?
---
It's at 178GB that's only with multiplayer installed! not all the side modes like Survival and Spec ops
---
Bashing should apply full perk bonus from 1 AND 2-handed damage perks as well as STR because it sucks so much.
---
I am not hiding, lvl 39 here. I’ll make you a deal, I’ll entertain your pvp wishes but If I get 3 kills on you (and you can’t leave server) then you quit the game and give me your inventory how about that?
---
Also a bug is very much like to be investigated: weapons that fire multiple pellets/beams such as shotguns, beam split lasers and plasma weapons deal inconsistent damage both in and out of VATS. In VATS they do far more than the pip-listed values, outside of it they deal significantly less. This is a separate issue to the common rubber-banding bug that still affects shotguns specifically.
---
I got 69 minutes until my update downloads. Giggidy.
---
You need to fine tune your sarcasm meter.
---
That said, I'm fairly sure Bethesda never spends time on checking everything and fixing issues.
---
The only rational endgame I can think of are procced dungeons and growing horde challenges, but is that even possible with this?
---
I'm guessing it's this, I get it sometimes as well. Usually ignore it when I do.
---
😂 you got me!! i really want that mr. pebbles backpack
---
Didn't you guys get a little banner for that? Something to say I got this the hard way and not duped.
---
I tried the basic wooden wall last night and it wouldn't accept the second wall placement-- but possibly it was just that type or something else was obstructing it.
---
I got that skin for my power armor and am still kicking myself for not buying the pipboy skin.
---
Have you filed a [support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net) for troubleshooting yet?
---
O sure, I didn't know that this message was displayed to. Thanks
---
True but weapon Artisan saves you five perk points. Like I said it's more efficient
---
I’ve been told that the shrouded &amp; shadow mods are broken and they don’t work. I’ve never tried tbh. I’m a sneak build I run sneak three three unyieldingly to 2 bolster and I have 3 Ap refresh and 2 harder to detect. I can literally touch a super mutant at Wes tek and not be detectable.
---
[is this what you are referring to?](https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/g26cms/_/fnltufc/?context=1)
---
I don’t see them saying when it was supposed to be fixed. Patch 18 was in February (3 patches ago) and I don’t believe the scout outfit was available then. Do you have another source? I just spent way too much time trying to find something that I’m pretty sure doesn’t exist.
---
The worst is when it says it can’t be placed, doesn’t place, and there’s nothing there to block it

Yeah it sucks that you can't use your level 20 alt to provoke another player into killing you so your level 400 buddies with legacy Tesla rifles can destroy him and the rest of his team.
---
Reminds me of Hearst and Odell talking in *Deadwood*
---
&gt;George Hearst:
---
Gold is every man's opportunity. Why do I make that argument? Because every defect in a man and in others a way of taking him. Our agreement that gold has value gives us power to rise above.
---
&gt;Odell:
---
Fond as you are of my mother, without that gold I showed you, I don't expect we'd be out here talking.
---
That is correct. And for your effrontery at our meal a moment ago, I'd have seen you shot or hanged without second thought. The value I gave the gold restrained me, you see? Your utility in connection to it. And because of my gold those at the other tables deferred to my restraint. Gold confers power. Power comes to any man who has the color.
---
So I'm not the only one who wonders what, if anything, is actually being said.
---
I've had it happen at bog town and in a different location.
---
I was wondering the same thing... doubt I'll actually get that far anyway, but it's still a good question. Plus, what'll happen with challenges between seasons, then? Will they award Atoms again, or just.. have no purpose at all, until the next season starts?
---
Oooh WEE uhhh WAWA
---
So do you not run wood armor then?
---
Took me all of 2 seconds too!
---
It ends with "Low power"
---
We got some things.  Unfortunately the only things that are legacy are the photo poses, frames, one of the icons, and the emote.  The emote is the true trophy because it was the grind of all grinds.  I didn't even finish that challenge myself and regret it to this very day.
---
All I'm sayin is if we get titles we need em for the most difficult content the game ever had!
---
I like the way you think
---
Hmm.. i think you need two foundation between the walls, that might be case, did building another wall worked?
---
Lmao now i wana think up some!
---
Then you have all the season rewards and need to wait for the next season. You go back to what you were doing before the season.
---
Pretty much lol.
---
No I'm just being facetious.  You're totally right.
---
Well you're not wrong.
---
So they fixed the gauss shotgun/pistol overpowered charge VATS issue... BUT did they fix the gauss shotgun/pistol FIRST VATS SHOT MISS bug???
---
One of those killed me instantly while browsing a vending machine. Heard something that sounded like a door opening and then bam. No dying state screen, just instant death. I was frustrated.. and impressed.
---
She wanted to give me one more middle finger before they tied her down.
---
I wonder how many checked after that post.
---
....that's what I said.
---
I dont recognize the video that the actual brotherhood stuff came from.  The fight at Mount Blair, fixing the armor, walking to Atlas.  Did I miss something?
---
Looks amazing though
---
I agree with all these points aside from Gunsmith. It is the only qol perk I use, but it is essential for me, guns break way too quickly otherwise.
---
I figured it might be somewhere to be found, since I always see people using it or the  funky mothman.
---
Oh and I have a wife who would have known
---
What if it takes longer than they say?  People like you would be here screaming about it taking longer than they said.  No way, they're much better off not saying anything.
---
I always thought it said "Protectron power" but after listening to it again I am not so sure...
---
you cant purchase level till after the 15th. so until then i will i always do farm treasury notes and hunt for plans. but due to having a lot going on in the real world i am unable to devote endless mindless hours to doing repetitive challenges over and over and over to accomplish the same task as spending the atoms i am already not using. doing so will also let me see if we are able to accumulate score after we reach 100 to see if were able to pre bank score for season 2.  the purpose of having atoms is to spend them on things you want. why does it matter if i spend them on levle vs a cosmetic nuka colo thesed funiture set.
---
Seriously, do this u/squeakybeak
---
I will when the games back up
---
I was responding to the person that said the didn’t give them
---
Hadnt had a chance to notice the curtain budget issue yet. Im still just playing with it till i find my perfect permanent location.
---
Do you know if shadowed mods were added to SS armor as well? Patch notes say all armor, but not sure if that includes secret service.
---
So much this. There are still elements in the game from beta release that don't work as intended (keypad pylon, I'm looking at you). While I do enjoy new content as it keeps the game fresh... It's a major annoyance to be playing an incomplete base game for so long
---
They all do different things.
---
They ended up adding NPCs and pets. Anything’s possible lol
---
Why am I even allowing the Secret Service to keep their gold bullion in the first place?  I have destroyed foes far more powerful than that handful of people left in the vault.  I'm taking all the gold for myself, and if they don't like it they can eat lead.
---
Except that I can't.  No real reason except that the game doesn't allow me to.
---
yup also with gauss rifle

I did this for the last patch, updates gonna update. Try meditating on your day's strategy in detail while you wait, expectation is the house of delight.
---
It’s not actually stickied 😉
---
U run faster and u jump higher literally lmao
---
I play junkies stealth commando/rifleman and must say, after using Chinese stealth armor it's hard to go back to anything else.
---
they're all different things and chameleon stacks. although you won't see much benefit from more than 2, maybe 3 pieces. the harder to detect while sneaking legendary effect doesn't stack.
---
the shrouded mod is mostly broken, doesn't work, and escape artist ignores your armor weight. not entirely, but to a point muffled mods don't make much of a difference.
---
"black market" 
---
lol
---
Dude, I thought this was just my luck. I've unloaded 30 rounds at 95%, to the torso, and missed every single fucking one. 😒☠
---
I really do like how Bethesda removed any semblance of roleplaying as a raider. It's nice to know that during the literal nuclear apocalypse we can all join hands and nothing bad can ever happen
---
lol woops totally missed it from the actual entitled bitching in this thread
---
The game is over, you should ask for a refund. Haha, Totally kidding. Should be up soon
---
Back up now
---
That's another massive issue. The raiders would definitely not just sit by idol when there's a literal Vault of gold on their *doorstep*.
---
Same here.
---
I really wish they do fix the social because I have a bug that I can’t fixed
---
-Launching a nuke gives ample time for them to react.
---
-Workshops give a warning about consenting to pvp
---
-One shotting event legendaries is something theyve acknowledged as a problem and have given plans they have of changing it. Ie: no tagging necessary in events.
---
What the intended examples of “griefing” you gave all have in common is they require consent or give enough opportunity to avoid it. Trap houses do not. Unless youd be ok with a notification icon over your CAMP that says, “Hey this is a TrapHouse, enter at your own risk” than ya, luring ppl to their deaths with vendor traps is a type of griefing that has no place in this game. Theres a reason turrets dont attack any player unless they do something to deserve it.
---
Edit:spelling
---
Were online folks!
---
Great then play it like that, i said in the bottom im not tryna change how ppl play just tryba give some tips on dmg
---
Hi honey!
---
Spoken like a true foodbuild. Legacy tesla ,,,,,, oh lord
---
I guess- just never seen procedural generation done properly with 1st person games. Would love if they could!
---
I also get severely pissed off when people don't think exactly like me.
---
ok, you do you. And spend those repair kits when the next sbq doesn't die quite so fast .)
---
Last year, it was August 1st
---
And September 26
---
If that helps.
---
All back up by the looks of things
---
Yea I thought about just going that, but the WWR on spare pieces just sounds so nice as I loot weapons for days.
---
For sure! I took [some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/bnsb9ib) last night for you. 
---
Stairs from the entrance come down on the right side into the first main room then snake down another staircase into the crafting/vending bottom floor. It's like a big outward facing cone. I was able to get it so high by placing my C.A.M.P. on the very edge of the cliff, allowing me to build up 4 *and* down 4. Too bad the structure takes up so much of the build capacity that it's going to be difficult to decorate with all the new score stuff. I don't want to lose my mounted head stairwell :(.
---
Please add an option to disable the season, and daily/weekly login rewards as I have legit 0 interest in doing it, and now that atoms are gone I dont want the daily or weekly rewards either. Nothing in this update I will partake in. First and last time I bought fallout 1st, and last time I'll make a purchase of atoms.
---
*That's* what the bug was?  I always assumed it was just the combat AI was lagging.
---
Your telling me you got on everyday and grinded all the weekly/daily challenges?
---
Mask resistance +100
---
It’s just for fun mate. Satire, if you like. Relax.
---
Not to mention that launching a nuke takes a modicum of time and effort, and I'm not really sure who is playing who in that regard.
---
Nah, this user is just salty that he can't spawn magic punji board traps and other cowardly tricks on unsuspecting players.
---
Wow, what a coincidence! Do you think she changed her name after getting the job or do you think they hired her because of her name?

Well actually...

YESSSSSSSSSS

How about a new event where Nazis invade from Venus like in wolfenstien!?  How about more crazies events like Saint's Row 4 Professor Genki? How about people finding rich people's missile silos or more weird whitespring events? Can you get to the other floors? How about more storage options, 800 lbs is not enough when you have ore and clothes you want to keep that's not on a MRC? Tanks might be cool if someone was able to get those working or a mount or bike. Why not nightrider car? I mean if everything was automated in the 1970s that would have been a thing for sure. Why no brothel? It's the oldest form of work people tell me. Why about an elon musk mining vehicle? No one has really done open world underworld yet. Did people forget about helicopters? I mean some books clearly did make it, even though when you see them in the game you can't interact with them. Clearly only comics would make it, right? I need a brightness toggle in settings. I don't know why by sometimes my TV gets really dark for the game and I don't change anything.

#LETS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOO AMMO CONVERTER TIME

Dude they don't play the game they don't know that they already fixed the dailies
---
Suspension of disbelief.
---
Yes. Yes I do. 250 hours played since free weekend.
---
I just launched my first one at level 80 yesterday. It's such a satisfying feeling.
---
yah for sure but my point was optimizing dmg and gunsmith is a qol perk. Cater your perks to how you play, i was just tryna offer some insight but everyones taking this as me telling them what to do
---
You do what you do, i play fo76 daily and almost nothing else so that is why i will not bother with buying levels, unless i will have no time to get to the max level until time runs out.
---
I thought last week was disappointing..
---
I don’t see it as a middle finger. Imagine you have share holders breathing down your neck asking for more profit more profit MORE PROFIT!!!! I think this is a pretty reasonable halfway measure between delivering content and facilitating more profit. You butthurt that you may actually need to contribute financially to buy all the cosmetics you want?
---
Done! I'm rank 100. /s
---
I will try to reach rank 5 today lol
---
I typically only use the full damage build in SBQ or Encrypted.   Its overkill for most other content.  Granted,  I run either bloodied or junkies :)
---
It’s over now.
---
Posting this graphical issue I keep running into, hopefully it can be addressed as it isn't in the patch notes afaik. 
---
Everytime I run the game, there is always a slightly darker tone to everything in-game. It's like someone turned the game's brightness down, to make things eerier it sometimes transports itself over to my computer once I have finished playing the game.
---
IT IS ALIVEEEEEEEE!
---
What is the rifle skin for?
---
Is that an M16 skin? For what, the handmade?
---
Only for the freaking convertor i chewed my fuckin first bubblegum since i started the whole game 2 y ago
---
Wise words.
---
The chainsaw flamer causes the Chainsaw to deal 10 unresisted (against everything but fire floaters) damage per 7 attacks per second. It's actually a REALLY good mid-level weapon that falls off against enemies in the 40+ levels.  It's honestly really useful if you want to start a new character without choosing damage perks for the first 30 or so levels for better optimization for reaching lvl 50.
---
Reeeeeeeeee
---
I've always used that sort of thing (deep pockets etc), but it may have started after modding my backpack.
---
Yup. Although technically the Fallout counterpart is the Service Rifle from Fallout NV
---

Ok, that is awesome, ill have to visit if we end up on the same world. Thank you for doing the extra, it really shows all the work you put into it and how awesome it is. Need to get higher building space to get more creative like this.

Oh good point. I had forgotten.

Negative man it’s all scout. I had a wood armor chest and was planning on doing a whole unyielding set with shrouded and every one told me it’d be a waste of time as shrouded and shadowed are broken right now. I don’t think it matters as long as you are running sneak three, evasive and one harder to detect piece I guarantee you’ll be a sneak lord. I can do the entire imposter event on a log and I’m never detected. My agility is 15 base I think 28 with all the buffs. I play with only 10 hp because I’m never seen it doesn’t matter except for during scorched earth sometime the mob will kind of aggro to me randomly. 
---
I’ve even considered tossing out the bolster for more unyielding because I’m never really shot at so the extra resistance feels kind of redundant. It does save me from the SBQ though.
---
In my honest opinion a lot of bloodied weapons dont even need perks cept nerd rage, i can use my bloodied ss meathook on muties and 1 shot them when having a heavy build or smthin
---
Yeah I don’t do workshops on public servers anymore only private so I can avoid the PVP.  I just don’t pay attention for PVP, not my thing.
---
the server are online again
---
They nerfed it because an autistic neo Nazi on the forums makes 4 posts about it a day
---
Done ;)
---
Have you even checked the link?

Thank you, now I can finally go back to work

Okay well just like Battlefield. If they can't ring in a profit. They will pull the plug on the game

You don't know a goddamn thing about my build.

Food builds are actually used by  people like you. You get someone on your team with a food build to provoke someone into shooting back and then when he does you wipe out the rest of his team with your duped gear.
---
That  exact scenario that I have described  has happened to me and my team mates multiple times.
---
Some level 30 is swatting at me with  a mole miner gauntlet. I know he's bait but I don't care so  I mow him down with an explosive LMG.
---
Seconds later me and my entire team are dead and yes, it's legacy Tesla rifles.
---
I always wanted to try and build on that area. Have any luck building on it?
---
You stop playing.
---
I’m referring to the market on EBay that sells Legacies and high demand weapons for real money, often hundreds of dollars, but of course you wouldn’t know anything about that you noob
---
You do need a floor on either side of the wall, but that wasn't the problem. I swapped to brick and it worked fine. *shrug*
---
The fact there isnt anything in the season for some people I think makes it worse. I have 0 interest in any of the rewards but the atoms but I'm not even gonna bother doing it. If I could shut off the season as an option I would, mind you I'm still new to the game so if I'm this uninterested in the rewards I find it hard to believe beta players will care too much.
---
Sure man.

And take their junk to teach them a lesson

When I’m bored sometimes I’ll sit down in my shop, pull up the map and find an objective marker, click it, hit show in pip boy, then sit there playing pip boy games. Those things are awesome still, lol. I have heard a few NPC’s talk about how they’ve accidentally erased their high scores. Would love an arcade pack like the creation club release for fo4. Would be cool to have like a nukacade too like from Nuka World.

Careful, this threads sarcasm might trigger those who are always angry at this game.  Asking the question is very serious!

Daven Port made me take a picture of that Confederate Monument every day for 6 weeks.

No baiting intended.  The way you acted, I get it, Bethesda is annoying, but there have been countless threads about today's update for the past several days.

Is it a display bug or does it actually do nothing for weight?
---
Modus is shook
---
The armors that give 3 types of resistances (ballistic, energy, and radiation) have the caveat of having low defense values for all 3 of them to not be innately better than all other armors. Marine Armor in this regard...is actually pretty decent since it gives mediocre defenses, but covers an additional damage type that most other armors don't. It's not good, but it's just mediocre enough to not be bad. Plus with White Knight 3, it doesn't require Ballistic Fiber to repair unlike most other heavy armor variants which still need some even with White Knight 3.
---
People who start support tickets that say "have I been banned" during scheduled and very obvious down time should absolutely be banned.

True. I just play a lot in general.

Guess I’m old school... especially with Fallout.   Started with fallout 3 and has never waned.    
---
I’ve never done private.    So you can gather mats without being bothered?    Why have I not considered this?    Does it cost?
---
Incase you weren't tired of the deals from last week, here they are again!
---
And, everyone take note on how long the new deals last. All the new items are set to last for 2 weeks - including the free item. Which means, we likely aren't getting anything of note next week either. Usually free items don't last 2 weeks, and when they do, that's it for those 2 weeks.
---
Not the pepperoni rollsssss did you craft some?

I see 1 trap camp every 200 camps I go to

110% bait. No way you took me seriously stinky
---
In a way, I think WL made it a bit more difficult to play as a team, in that the WL questline is instanced, so instead of a group raiding a location, it changed to follow the leader (and make no progress on your own char) or enter solo (temporarily abandon the team)
---
Since the group I normally play with is at 4 different points in story progression, made it difficult to play as a cohesive unit.
---
Oh right for some reason I didn't see the free icon and assumed it was bundled with the rest.
---
have an upvote, but to whats included in the atom shop this week.... BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
---
Bethesda just isn’t AAA to me anymore. They were once but the bar has been set way higher by AAA companies that Bethesda just can’t keep up.
---
1. I imagine they use whatever is handy to protect themselves. There may be a little humanity/instinct left within them that tells them a gun is a better weapon to protect themselves with, while their pickaxes are better utilized for mining.
---
3. As others have mentioned, iguana meat is canonically human according to Fallout 1.
---
4. It’s possible they are unseen cargo drops, or supply crates you discover in the location of said quest; things left behind by previous inhabitants that you help yourself to as a little self indulgent reward for your own good work.
---
7-8. We are participating in Pioneer Scouts, and going for the full legit experience! We’re playing it by the rulebook. Besides, do YOU want to break the rules being upheld by a bunch of Gutsy Camp Guardians? Didn’t think so ;P We are trying to rebuild America, so continuing such traditions is vital.
---
9. They are off on a supply run.
---
10. No. That’s why we find bottles everywhere.
---
11. There is more than one Mothman; they are a species as opposed to one being. While the Wise Mothman is unique, the others develop based upon their territory and nature.
---
13. Yeah this one bothers me. I just tell myself that diseased = virus and they were too lazy to make a separate grouping for it.
---
15. It would be incredibly easy for the Whitesprings robots to keep the machines that produce them maintained and supplied so that they could continue to produce them infinitely. Pick up the scrap of any robots that die, recycle, rebuild, etc.
---
I also said evasive and I meant escape artist my bad

All food. Possibly meat, as am herbivore. Did get bonus before patch.
---
LOVING the username, btw, OP
---
Over 40 cosmetics, camp items, in game currency, repair kits, lunch boxes. Those seem to be worth more than the lower amount of atoms
---
I personally do think I’ll get more rewards out of the season than I would have with atoms in the next 10 weeks. 
---
All that being said I’m not a huge fan of seasons in general. They seem to cheapen the product IMO.
---
Personally, variety. Counting only the stuff that contributes towards faction rep or treasury notes, there’s not much to do and the different quests are virtually identical.
---
&lt;3
---
D'oh
---
Hell yeah! I'm glad you like it. it was just this idea I had very early in playing. My previous camp was really cool, and it was hard to say goodbye, but I'm much happier with this one.
---
I'm unadventurer on PC. Come say hi!
---
PvP is essentially persona non grata in 76 now, save for NW (and even that is getting neglected). Bethesda seems to have caught on that the overwhelming majority of the player base is deathly averse to PvP in any form, so specific balance passes that would make it more viable would be something if a minor miracle at this point.
---
Aw man, they added every beret except the very one I wanted.... I wonder why they didn't include the pink heart one?

im commenting on the thought of any **legitimate** source of trading or selling items  ( including ebay)  being considered "black market"  think someone dosent know what a actual black market is
---
In my experiences, it is all about the server. I pseudo-test each server before settling in a session; meaning, I run through a few tests, such as checking the VATS accuracy bug by clearing normal spawns near my camp, fast traveling from and to my camp, which I always park at, to check the rate my camp populates. I do other various tests, depending on the toon I'm loading, in order to justify if I can live with it for a session. Morgantown and VTU always lag, two accounts (xb, private), but by testing the aforementioned (2), I'll know  in advance if I have to walk out of VTU after dropping off DNA.
---
Edit: I always run healing factor; so, no basis for comparison.
---
And this is where FO1st helps, just pop down your tent, scrap your junk and then buy from a seedy shack vendor.
---
Don't know what fallout first has to do with seasons
---
Having no skin for the fixer or combat rifle is just nuts at this point. We havr what seems like 10 for the handmade, hunting rifle and combat shotguns.
---
How long did it take to load? I'm sitting at almost 10 minutes now.
---
edit: lol Just loaded - probably just over 10 minutes
---
Better inventory mod on PC...
---
I fell into a put of punji boards once, flamethrower destroyed the floor. That was an awesome use of them in a trap camp.
---
It does
---
Can’t think of any but it’ll be the first time since I’ve gotten this game (since it came out) that I’ll actually complete challenges besides the tadpole ones. 
---
It’s also going to bring me back to the game after straying away from it for so long.
---
According to Amazon $15.50... HOLY SHIT, when did *that* price drop happen?!
---
Like 3 minutes. Might wanna restart
---
*  **Ward:** Is now stationary and can now always be found *sleeping in his bed* in the trailer in Foundation.
---
Those with fo1st get 1650 atoms per month, so they don't care as much as the rest of us about free atoms.
---
My buddy and I found them separately and grouped up to explore them one day when we were both online. What a disappointment that was. After the first two we were like “Man, imagine if the third is also closed up”.
---
Sweetwater special blend now gives me +5 perception. They meddled with the herbivore/carnivore mutations it seems.
---
As somebody with 0 interest in the season it feels like a middle finger. The atoms I could earn are now gone, which in turn my roommate and i will not purchase fallout 1st, nor spend on atoms(they're losing hundreds of dollars from just us 2 over this season) they removed something that gave me the want to purchase and in turn implemented something I want to be able to turn off in options.

Flyboy is the best looking icon rn
---
Update: the new update fixed the issue. They are two ha send and work
---
I got 3 tbs still open, so I'm good.
---
I've heard great things about fortnite. You can be the next ninja.....tae kwon do, or sum like that
---
There was no current dupe glitch from weapons. The influx of fixers is from the value dropping and the people sitting on stacks of them are now trickling out. 
---
Its a weapon that still currently drops. Between people actually rolling them and the one group of dupers that was actually making them a few months back, theyve become more common. Thats how the economy works.
---
But theyre still worth more than a BE gatling plasma by a fair amount, its not like they plummeted in price like the BE lasers did.
---
Just a heads up. I'm on a 24 hour shift. And I'm UK based, so won't be online till tomorrow 20:00 GMT
---
Monster Mash is a great way of farming ghouls for legendaries: it possible to get multiple 3* spawns throughout the event.
---
Pretty much the only thing I’ve even logged in for over the last 6+ months. I have 12k atoms from grinding. Guess that’s why they got rid of them
---
there are like a million ways a bloodied build can synergize damage.. it all adds up yo
---
Pretty much every MMO/RPG type game makes you focus on one specific role. There is absolutely nothing "flawed" with that aspect.
---
Getting gear is pretty much the point of most games like this for "endgame" content.
---
Bethesda intentionally made 76 different than, say 4, to where you cannot legitimately become a god.
---
I'm also safely presuming there is going to be a difficulty hike in some content soonish, based off of the SS gear and T-65 being so substantially better than the other gear.
---
Also, "non dps builds" are meant more for teams.
---
My first, well really second since I deleted my BETA character for being so broken way before they added the "respeccing" mechanic, is a crafter/support character that does a good bit of damage since I changed him from a rifleman to a shotgunner. 
---
All I have to do is change some cards around before/after fights. It's annoying, but still effective. I just hope the rumors I've heard about alternate card sets for quick changing perks are legit and released soon.
---
Another player, a few posts up, is stating that all food buffs are being doubled?!
---
Is this on Xbox or PC with an Xbox controller?
---
Creation club is the same as the atom shop, there’d be no reason to have two cosmetic shops in the game. Anything that *could* be a creation club item can also just as easily be an atom shop item 
---
And adding a creation club probably also opens up modding to the community which will do terrible things to the games in terms of the number of and frequency of hacks
---
It always confuses me too.  I run a pretty good guass rifle with all rifleman perks, explosive perks, etc and I still only top out at 300.  I must be dumb.
---
k?
---
Oh god there’s some really fucky stuff with bow accuracy, even outside of VATS. I was trying to use a bloody VATS bow on my rifleman and even at medium ranges, crosshairs dead on, and the projectile LOOKING like it went right at the target, it’s like it just passed THROUGH the target and exploded behind them (explosive bow mod). Gave up after a bit- best I could do was treat it like a reaally shitty rocket launcher and jump-&gt;shoot their feet.

Fly boy icon
---
I am confused. When was there ever an incentive to earn a bounty other than to grief people?   
---
PVP isn't wanted in the regular game outside of Workshops (and even then - meh). Hasn't the majority of the player base been pretty consistent regarding that? Survival mode flopped largely because this game isn't a good fit for PVP.   
---
There are so many better games to scratch the PVP itch that I don't understand wanting to shoehorn it into this game.   
---
Yes, I get it, a very small portion of the player base likes both PVP and Fallout. But this isn't that type of game no matter how hard they try and force that play mode on the majority of other players.   
---
If the Devs are making it harder and harder to do the thing you like to do in this game maybe take that as hint that what you like to do isn't intended and your continual insistence to persist is really fucking annoying.
---
Its located in the icons section
---
Thanks, I’ll have to check it again!
---
“Ineffective” ? How is my camp going to grief you if you forced me to leave server? Honestly, I think yall just have a knee jerk mentality that getting trapped means your stupid and someone pulled a fast one on you. When in reality, 9 times out of 10 the person owning the trap base looses junk for trapping you and just doing it for the funny way your body flops around when you die. Skrrrrrrrk!
---
Obviously you're supposed to fail the lookup between 3-1000 times, duh /s
---
the content waiting for you depends on when you stopped playing. If you haven't played since April of this year, there was a major content update that featured an entirely new main storyline that runs alongside the existing one (though it pushes the timeline forward one year). it also added a few other events, quests, and features as well.
---
in regards to your comments about ghouls, it sounds like you are underpowered. you should google 'Fallout 76 builds' and use different anecdotes and sites to put some kind of build together. at the very least, you should lean completely into a single weapon type (melee, automatic rifle, shotgun, single fire rifle, etc). by this i mean get all of the damage boosting and performance enhancing perks for the weapon type you're going with. Also, be mindful of how you are proceeding through the map while you level. as the game is now, each area features enemies with specific level ranges, and getting ahead to bigger areas before you are the proper level is going to be a bad time.
---
one last thing to touch on, when you die, you only lose your junk, which isn't a big deal for the great majority of junk items. most of it comes quickly. be sure to stash any valuable junk frequently and before doing major quests or events.
---
It just loaded, probably a minute after I posted

I’ll have to check, because I have been wearing that outfit for almost the entire time I have been playing and I remember seeing the pack.

Yeah. Something must be wonky

What platform are you on?

PC using keyboard and mouse
---
I've only encountered this "tactic" one time - I had no armor on and they still fucked it up lol

Mine’s open for free too, along with the ammo machine and waters.

Also who locks a Communist Collectron? I should pick those on principle.

Also, thanks for the down votes!

Yeah, definitely want the same character. I’ll give this a try though! I just wish I wasn’t so careless with my perks and special points so early on. Thank you for the help!

More input.... more input!
---
All forms of detection from the survival days got removed for whatever reason - berry tats don’t work on crouching players, and recon scopes don’t function at all anymore in pvp
---
They have mid max builds just look for a build guide
---
Makes me wonder how some of them tie their laces. I think it could be Velcro
---
Did you, by any chance, not read my post? Looking at the cosmetic rewards, we can clearly see that most of the items would be bundled together as ATX bundles (Camoflauge, Future-Tec 2, Atomic Onslaught, Captain Cosmos power armor set) and the rest would be sold at 100-500.
---
Theres actually a lot to go into it. You have to have the right build (bloodied) the right perks there are certain chems that you can take to increase your damage output plus a few other things to help boost your damage
---
*Automatron flashbacks*
---
I really don’t feel that way at all actually - I’ve run into some pretty neat trap camps before to be perfectly honest. I don’t feel griefed- just inconvenient. But your suggestion that nuking your camp is the solution is laughable. Why would anyone waste that amount of time with no real purpose. It doesn’t matter if you leave the server.
---
anybody know if this update made the Gauss shotgun useless with vats now? or does it still work as it did? (yes I see the part about it in the notes)
---
If you dont agree with this post, you are probably a cunt.
---
right?  There's a small population of several hundred "homeless" pvp'rs that played Fallen Earth for over a decade and have been bouncing around from 76, to Arma 3 servers, Rust, and now SCUM.  
---
The survival servers were actually very exciting to us,  but the lack of balance on things like tesla rifles, crazy TSE's that were removed from tables but not the game, leaves certain players essentially god characters.  
---
The promise of private servers gave some hope, but I suspected there'd be little in the way of governing them,  running dayZ and arma servers for years we learned it's just impractical not to have a GM on a server because when people are hacking and exploiting so much, it makes the survival pvp progression pointless. 
---
I don't expect BGS to devote a lot of attention to pvp, but I kinda hoped they'd put at least ONE person on it.
---
Well the atom shop is recycled 70% of the time since launch. Can't count how many times I've seen playtime paint. So your not missing much lol
---
A bloodied variant Mr handy Buzzsaw is really fun at Whitespring.

Aw snap, I’m about to smash everything lol.

that's good to know.  thank you!
---
I just wanted Mr.pebbles
---
I don’t think I have the cranberry relish, but I’ll look for it! Thank you for the help!
---
pull your mods off, mine was the same way until then.
---
stupid of me to even think of asking this, but, they didn't add deep pockets either, did they?
---
There’s multiple fast-travel bug “types”. There’s one where it seems to be affected by nearby hostiles but skips the whole countdown (it flashes the countdown and immediate cancels it), only way around it is either killing everything or getting far enough away.
---
The other that I know of just seems to be some weird lag issue- this one I can avoid if I take a 3 second count between each “click” to travel- open map, click target, wait 3, click confirm, wait 3, click pay caps.
---
Nerd rage, bloody mess, concentrated fire, bonus sneak attack damage perks.  Get headshots in VATS and even if you’re far away, concentrated fire will eventually hit.  My bloodied fixer is awesome, but doesn’t have the reduced VATS cost, so I main a quad limb damage reduced VATS handmade.  Kills mobs with one headshot.  I break out the fixer for queen fights or bigger enemies when solo.
---
15 Perception, 3.75 x sneak bonuses thanks for Covert Operative and Mister Sandman, all 3 Commando cards, Nerd Rage, Bloody mess, Adrenaline, Adrenal reaction, Eagle Eyes, full Unyielding set. Overdrive, Ballistic Bock, Guns &amp; Bullets 3, Small Guns Bobblehead.
---
Add all those up with a B2525 fixer and you get that damage and then some.
---
You have custom strings.
---
This is what happens when you try to turn something that has been a  single player franchise for decades and try to turn it into  multiplayer game with PVP.   Of course people are going to be unhappy with it. How could it possibly have  been otherwise?
---
Check any mods that modify the ui like inventory strings and delete them until an update is released. This is common after patch day with items in the pipboy specifically, never seen it inside the challenges menu though so maybe not.
---
Are you running any menu mods from the nexus site because so far every patch breaks them, my advice is remove the strings folder and re load your client.
---
Just as a heads up, last I heard from the ATX datamines you can’t take the scope off of that rifle skin, so be aware of that when buying. Maybe they’ve changed it since so if anyone finds it’s different I’ll update this
---
Edit: according to another user you can take it off actually :)
---
Oh!  So you’ve been accumulating gear over a long time. Just like someone that has 8 TSE weapons could have been accumulating those over a long time. 
---
*Without duping.*
---
***Imagine that.***
---
I completed two of the weekly and didn’t get any S.C.O.R.E
---
I don’t know man I like to play simple events such as swarm of suitors with different weapons, it’s actually very different and fun experiences. With a shotty and no vats I have to run around and chase the crabs, and don’t get me started on the bloodied rolling pin I tried.  Mine is not a ‘kill everything super fast’ approach, maybe that’s why I don’t get bored easily.
---
I’m going for a rifleman build for my main character. I found a build online that I liked, but it just sucks having to level just to change my perk points lol
---
You’re a little late
---
I read it. Did you read my response? I think I will end up with more items at the end of 10 week seasons than under previous challenge/atom mode.
---
I figure I get about 7000 atoms worth of value in first 50 levels:
---
-750 atoms direct
---
-250 for wallpaper 
---
-250 for chilliest backpack
---
-1000 for 4 ghillie armor skins
---
-150 for 15 lunchboxes at 10 atoms each 
---
-250 for clean sink
---
-1000 for ammo converter
---
-1200 for 4 onslaught paints
---
-500 for raider cage (I compare this to that outhouse toilet they had)
---
-200 for bow skin
---
-250 for sledge skin
---
-250 for the hint plushie
---
-250 for flying saucer
---
-700 for all the remaining icons, repair kits, scrap kits, gold, caps, ghillie rifle, fireworks, frames, pip boy paint
---
This is only have the season and already seems like my money’s worth. People do their own mental math and can decide for themselves if it’s worth it.
---
Thank you amigo 👀 lol

WE'RE BACK UP ON PC BOYZ

I just want a 2mm ec core fore the Gauss minigun.

You are 4 hours late.
---
Happy to help. Pvp is honestly so hard to come by it’s pretty much dead unfortunately. Im waiting for rust to come out on console I’ve heard great things
---
Taking away the daily and weekly atoms, maybe Beth doesn't believe that anybody has any atoms to buy something.
---
You can usually buy most of it serperate but they always keep 1 item(usually the most interesting) part of the bundle
---
I've never seen this before. Where have I been? Thanks man.
---
Bloodied has a ton of perks going for it due to the radiation that all stacks
---
The OP should not be downvoted and here’s why:
---
TL;DR: OP wants “I can’t believe we accomplished that together fellow lv 16 player!” and not “Thanks for the help on that quest lv 597 person.” And his frustration is completely reasonable.
---
I think what OP is trying to say in few words is that it’s hard to find a stable play relationship with random people for completing main missions because everyone is so focused towards completing their own personal set of objectives and has already completed different sets of main mission. We’ve all been there.
---
What OP expected and was looking forward too was to have a small group of people complete the main missions from start to finish together and he’s frustrated that players and servers are so temporary that it makes it impossible to find people in time to share in the experience of completing these key missions for the first time together. When OP says multiplayer he actually means a shared progression or shared experience.
---
In this case OP is correct. Although the game allows for shared progression/shared experience through the main story, it’s incredibly rare unless you and a close friend have already purchased the game together and agree to not push ahead in the story if your schedules don’t match.
---
OP is also correct that because of the way teams and the game is set up that it can still feel like a single player experience even when you play with others. Especially if the other person has previously completed the mission that you are working on or if they need to fast travel back to their base to get ammo and break immersion. 
---
OP is looking for that wow factor. That, “I can’t believe we did that together moment.” rather than “thanks for the help on that quest.”
---
To the OP: Those moments you are looking for come after you complete the main missions but you have to work very hard to either find the group in the forums or be the organizer of the experience you want and share it with others.
---
I hope I helped translate the soul of what you are trying to get at.
---
He told me to kick rocks :(
---
because BGS/Zenimax has several years experience already with balance passes in ESO, which has quite a few players.  I don't expect it to be perfect, no pvp ever is, but to slight the pvp community after creating content for them is super fucked up from my perspective. 
---
sounds like you dislike pvp.
---
They're now up on Xbox to.
---
You're very welcome!
---
Wait, did they actually say that? That kinda removes the whole point of not eating/drinking
---

---
they're watching you

they see you're every move ... 👀
---
thankfully this time the outfit isn’t exclusive to it aha. only a few berets I think but correct me if i’m wrong. Either way I just hope they start to realise how to do it
---
Yep and if I pop a radshield first it ends up as good as PA
---
But your going to buy everything that comes out?
---
I need that parachute to be functional for my jet pack over estimations.
---
well, they settled the .45 vs 9mm debate by not including 9mm at all, thus proving its inferiority.
---
\*whistles innocently\*
---
Explosive weapons and grenades would still be good if you halved the damage. They'd still be able to 2 or 3 shot.
---
And the bolt carrier is completely static.

---
The prices of the atom shop were justified, because we could earn so many atoms in the game, but no more. They must drop the prices, but I know they wont.
---
Thanks bud I will absolutely keep all that in mind and look at some builds. I started some power armor but couldn't finish it due to me dropping all the supplies I needed, but I will try definitely find better armor until then though :]
---
My favorite trap base experience is when I went up to a vendor and got locked in a room where flamethrower came bursting through the wall but I have fireproof,dodgy and serendipity so I took like no damage and then just waved at the player from the flames.
---
Yeah
---
so that would be ratmonkey easy sorting then.

Just did a públic event, got zero SCORE... Guess what, can only do one event per Day... Guess I was correct. Its limited.
---
Single-handedly the most unpredictable farmable plant.
---
you mean zero? because shotguns at least were bugged and dealt full charge damage per tap. don't know if it affected the gauss as well, though.
---
I'm on ps4. Upon relogging the stats go back to normal ( well, sweetwater's dropped down to 2 so no longer being affected by partyboy but I I believe that is a seperate matter ) but if you retake said items they go back up to the silly amounts.
---
lmao cope
---
Added
---
Wow. Tyvm. Much more eloquent. I would say 90-95% correct.  With regards to most games, it's more like: get to top lvl THEN we all work together. But still, theirs support and comraderie.  I'm an old man by gaming standards lol, 47. Just looking for same ppl to hang with and compete. This game is definitely different then most but I like it and like to share.
---
Yes, this was included in our patch notes.
---
From the Atom Shop? I buy stuff when I like it. Or at least I used to knowing that I could just earn more. Will probably have to be more choosy now
---
the what now?

Foodbuilds be foodbuilding.

If you die to a fucking legacy tesla of all guns ur build is trash

I'm having the same problems, i cant even log into my account.
---
New handmade skin, new emote, new backpack etc
---
disabled it va ini configuration and they're working. cool thanks
---
No where in my post did I say anything about limits.  I was just copy and pasting some basic information I found on the website.  thought it might be helpful.  Can't test for myself as I'm still at work.
---
Yeah same, i disabled all mods, deleted anything that may crash the game at start, still game doesn't load.
---
When I tap fire , I can kill one shot stuff , but when I do the same in vats,  only a little damage is done.
---
I've never had a single weapon break on me during the queen fights as long as I remember to repair it at a workbench before I go. There is no need for that card unless you are running a Legacy explosive energy weapon, and even then there are ways to make it break slower other than dedicating so many perk slots to a conditional card. I've got at least 100 improved repair kits that I should just throw on the ground because hardly ever use them. The key is understanding how to actually kill the queen, not just standing there pumping a million rounds into her screaming YOLO

Ah there goes my bed-of-nails sleeping bag :/

I agree those and the LMG that’s not even a thought for a skin it seems...
---
Looks like others have beat me to it but yes disable any mods you've got going on and you should be fixed up!
---
Thanks for the info, I assumed it was still there, but I don't do much PvP anyway.
---
Haven't checked myself but from what I've seen on other posts they did not.
---
Been around since beta, stoked for the fireplace, chicken coop and the star lamp. There’s some neat shit in here but you really can’t please everyone
---
The in game tips on the loading screen are misleading too. I'm pretty sure they use to say that Combat Armor was one step below PA, just like the NPCs will comment at times (Nice combat armor. Have you thought about upgrading to a powered set?), but now the tips say Marine is one step below.
---
Which, the tips also claim an empty frame will increase your strength and carry weight, and that continuous unprovoked attacks on other players can make you become Wanted. 
---
A friend and I tested that last one out thoroughly between shooting them and their camp with about 10k 5mm rounds I never got flagged as Wanted.
---
Plus, always happily wasting ammo destroying trap camps, oh so precious punji boards, and never becoming Wanted.
---
When you critique a game in a sub that is for fans they are going to take anything negative as attacking their game. Personally I'm in the same boat I love the game but i just don't see any end game content.
---
Would you mind sending me a build too? I've been looking to change into something, please!
---
So if you have 12k+atoms and if you barely buy anything. How does this lose in atoms effect you?
---
Bethesda never fails to disappoint, I'd refund it if I were you.
---
I’m not interested in changing my build but thanks anyway! It was interesting to look at
---
Thanks for the heads up if that's still true then man that sucks.
---
Grandpa Ally is best Ally. I was telling my gf “hey he kind of looks like my grandpa” when I first placed him in my camp then he did that voiceline immediately after where he calls you grand kid. Me and the old man are best buds now.
---
Ill explain why you speak like a foodbuild.
---
Legacy teslas are worse than standart teslas,,, they lose their autoaim when explosive effect is added. 
---
Without the autoaim tesla rifle is a just a worse laser rifle,,,, It has bad accuracy , heavy recoil and the damage is still lower than the laser.
---
All the invisible icons in the shop are annoying as well. Preview icons should display the previewed item without issue.
---
As someome who already bought it i can tell you its not like that in game
---
There is a daily limit... And you can get 100 SCORE per 10K of experience, first level takes 1000 SCORE to lvl up.
---
No but it’s nice to have the extra atoms so say if I wanted to buy the 1200atom flyboy bundle this week but say next week they also come out with a cultist bundle for 1200atoms I could comfortably buy both potentially. Since they’re doing away with the weekly/daily atoms I’m going to have to be much more careful about buying things because I don’t have expendable income unfortunately
---
was the gauss rifle affected by the same bug as the gauss shotgun prior to today's patch? as in, you dealt full charge damage per tap in VATS as opposed to the supposed half?
---
because if it wasn't, then they probably targeted charge weapons globally and the uncharged shots are getting decreased even further.
---
PARACHUTE BACKPACK... holy shit
---
Same, on Xbox though.
---
It's sorta just one of those things I only knew because I get beat on a lot by randos haha
---
Yeah I noticed that and just smh - ffs Bethesda lol
---
You must be new here.  
---
^((Did you really thought it will work flawlessly on release?))
---
lone wanderer 4 life
---
Should put some pics too. I wanna see
---
At least I got a response from a beta player but still even somebody stoked for it only has 3/100 rewards to look forward to, 13? Counting atoms.
---
Yea. How about they release the CAR and R91 plain versions that we know are in the game files instead of only giving us variants with paint on the side?!?
---
Add the Dense torso mod so that armor actually protects us from explosives! Demo builds get protection from us, while we have to use our limited perk card slots to get protection from them? No thanks!
---
That’s a design intention. They know people are accidentally doing this.
---
Psn ashian27
---
easily 12 hours a day : this IS my life right now ...
---
Also the bolt carrier is completely static due to it not being completely modeled, gotta refund it.
---
The Dense mod could be added to armors to do exactly that.
---
I was really hoping for some older outfits to make a rotation, like the wasteland trapper. The wait continues
---
Yeah, you're not wrong there.
---
Can you take the scope off then? Last I heard you couldn’t
---
Got it thanks!
---
Is there way to get fallout 76 for free?
---
Anyone get the flyboy salute yet? If so, what is the animation that goes with it? I’m assuming just the regular salute but with that icon? Anyone know for sure?
---
This is the kind of update I'm here for
---
Gotta also mention the fact that the bolt carrier is static, only the charging handle is moving.
---
Those are just the main ones off the top of my head - I didn’t want to list everything - pretty much the only things that don’t interest me are the power armor skins because I don’t use power armor and the Captain Cosmos outfits aren’t up my alley but everything else is pretty neat honestly. The creepy tree is gonna fit perfectly in my camp
---
it's a small world after all ... it's a small world after all ...
---
problem solved
---
your welcome !
---
(that'll learn him for complaining)
---
I'm in the land of PS4 copying. Can anyone confirm the Grognak's/Stanley fix?
---
If it's night AND verdant season in the mire run to Dyer Chemical.
---
Do you usually purchase fallout 1st?
---
Is there a no scope option?
---
No it wasn't, there was a clear difference between charged and uncharged pre patch , it works fine with free aim, but when I use it in vats, it suffers.
---
NW is fun
---
Submit a support ticket, they're usually good about refunding stuff
---
I don't think so because on the main bethesda launcher fallout 76 page we see the fly boy skin holding one without the scope
---
im just gonna be going afk and not even play
---
Night yes,  Verdant not necessary.
---
Yeap if i ever wanted to play a crappy battle royale game there's tons of better alternatives out there.
---
Herbivore? There was someone saying pepperoni rolls no longer give carry weight. I'm thinking herbivore is applying over more than just the food % now.
---
if i send you 4,000 caps will it help your family, which was forced from power and is trying to get their wealth out of the country ???
---
( sorry if you're not in Nigeria )
---
What's the significance of stacked punji boards for trap camps? I barely come across any, maybe 4 in 2k hours so I don't know
---
These are some great suggestions
---
all the mods are just the standard handmade mods, you can put scopes and reflex sights on. but it has NO rear iron sight
---
I don;t think there is an overall dislike of the idea of a creation club, given that it is basically Atom shop with bethesda approved user created content. That being said, allowing modding in general would be a bad idea as if any user created mods could be added it would ruin the game.
---
My son was talking to me and I thought my finger was on the B button and I hit A instead. X.X $12 is an expensive accident for a game. It should be a 2 step buying process. Especially now that atoms arent as freely earned.
---
In a few weeks.
---
yes you can, after the second week of I'm not mistaken
---
Same. Can't load game, disabled any mods etc and verified files with no effect :(
---
True but when it triggers is the best time to go.
---
meh i was hoping that they wouldn't do that...
---
why do they want to artificially inflate NW numbers? all it does is dilute the experience for those that actually want to play. all these complaints about "bush wookies" and people playing afk are a result of people being forced to use this game mode.
---
I got trapped for the first time 2weeks ago luckily I spent only 100 caps but man I was so hurt I was like whyyyy 😭😭😭😭
---
Yes and this is what I'm thinking. Just hunting some scorchbeast to eat for science.
---
I just did... but still needs to be a better process.
---
file a ticket and hope they fix it soon. they almost guaranteed targeted all charge weapons and decreased their damage in vats instead of fixing the shotgun specifically properly.
---
Green thumb, solves that. Bummer it doesn't stack.
---
haha &lt;3 it.
---
Try the new public team feature out, that’s what it’s there for
---
The junk storage was my main benefit. Trap bases take a lot of resources to build and maintain. I have a fair amount stored up tho and realistically a lot of stuff I could dump. Occasionally I would go into private servers to build but it’s not super necessary in my experience.
---
They will refund with support ticket, done this at least twice
---
peas and carrots, peas and carrots !!!
---
If you mean me I was going to, I bought it once, and was gonna start getting it monthly but canceled for the next roll around because of this. Was thinking of buying the yearly one sure as hell not gonna now.
---
Are you on PC? If so,you can join me friend.
---
How else am I going to get you to visit my camp if I don’t shove 200+ mounted plans in there for 80 caps each.
---
I get 4 items when its verdant unless they changed it.
---
Mmmmmm.... science.
---
You can do everything else that's not PvP related and still max out your pass by the end.. This is a total non-issue.  People who enjoy NW should get a way to earn score too.  This way everyone has a way to earn score no matter which mode you play.  How is this a bad thing?
---
Then just play
---
Starts July 14.
---
Its 150 per score point something like that.
---
As expected, I have completed the requirements for a few of the score challenges but have received no update to their status. That seems about right for their product :)
---
If Bethesda even had the intelligence to add the dense mod to armor in nw that'd be great! But if that's not an option I'd like to prepare to defend against explosives with a fireproof perk card. I like your idea more, but the fireproof perk is something they would more likely add.
---
My husband and I have done this far too many times, we totally feel your pain 😭
---
NW is fun actually.
---
This has been going on since Wastelanders.
---
The most I ever got was 2, but it may just not display it. Or I do t notice. I have hundreds so I do it on auto pilot.
---
They just today released the public teams feature, give that a try!
---
She is like sixteen years old go easy on her
---
Haven’t played the update yet I’ll check it out
---
It's been doing this since at the very least...Wastelanders I believe.
---
Bethesda is waaaaay too incompetent to pull it off sadly
---
Only just noticed it myself, strange
---
Hopefully they will refund me. I really don't want the item x.x but still it would be nice in the future if they changed it so accidents don't happen.
---
Yep. It’s bound to daily / weeklies.  Sorry you can’t do it all in one day then complain about not having anything to do.
---
looks like we got us a whale boys*!!
---
*insert the gender specific and or neutral label youre comfortable with
---
Oh right. Only just noticed it now.
---
oh wow why didn't i think of that thanks
---
I don't want to. they're just forcing us to do it for the rewards.
---
Naw different situations completely not a mule and not 10 of the same but try again sparky you'll get me one day
---
Yes you can use all differemt types of optics includimg ironsight
---
I’m very happy to not find him sleeping sideways in his bed or stuck inside of a chair and have to fast travel so he’d talk to me.
---
No his username is Grishnaahk
---
Just logged in and tried. "Oof my back". Damnit.
---
Yeah I actually overlooked it myself for awhile.
---
I dident evan knownthsre was mods and have tryed verifying the files and also have no luck
---
It's even worse now with the fact that you can't get daily atoms. I mean 1200 would be a heck of a time to make up but... still. Most places have two step processes to make sure you want to purchase an item.
---
I completed the weekly 'build up your base' challenge and did not receive the 1000 score
---
I wrote a new process for work and as an example employee number I used that song.
---
PS4
---
I completed the 'build up your base' weekly challenge and did not receive the 1000 score
---
HE DONT MEASURE NO MO FROM HEAD TO TOE 
---
THAN HE DO FROM SIDE TO SIIIIIIIIIIDE
---
All the replies have successfully gotten my hopes up
---
I think the issue is Bethesda were the first to pull off these first person, truly open world RPGs, and then other companies caught on and added new twists and features, and Bethesda just kept reusing the same engine, assets, and ideas.
---
Nope and it is sad
---
Wow!!!!! Take my atoms!!!!!! Damn that is some good shit right there! They brought out the big guns for this update!
---
I had this once or twice. I ended up spending around £15 to basically plants trees and get a new style of roofing. I was so pissed.
---
2 for combat shotgun, 2 for hunting rifle, 3 for handmade, 1 of which is still bugged. Combat rifle just got its first skin in the score system, as well as another handmade and hunting rifle one
---
Definitely do it’s the biggest booster of them
---
Hahahahaha, Bugthesda at it again. IT JUST WORKSN'T!
---
I got multiple Challenges listed as "LOOKUP FAILED" but it still tracks things though, cause numbers keep going up and Ive even gotten few mystery Challenges done...    :)
---
*Edit: Actually, it was cause of one of mods, so user error this time! Forgot to delete the "strings" directory in the Data directory, that edits item names...*
---
Dident know thare was mods for it and have just bought the game last night for pc been an xbox slave uptill now and then this happens I just wont to get some lvling up done :(
---
Never, ever keep gunpowder. Lead is the second worst offender. Best solution is ammo, least equivalent weight. Second best is steel, lead ore, acid and cloth. But just make it into ammo.
---
Right on. That makes more sense than having to temporarily delete your vendor from camp. Fortunately (unfortunately) I’m too new to be anywhere near the cap cap, but I can imagine it won’t take too long before I’d consider doing the same.
---
So what, do we just sit here and wait it out?
---
Hopefully somthing soon
---
That sucks. At least you aren’t stuck with the scope though
---
That's the same one that didn't count for me. Hopefully it's just that one.
---
Idk man. I bought it and it looks perfectly fine
---
its some thing like 10 to 20 patches per god mode so maybe in patch 30 or 40  enemy's god mode get fix
---
Miscellaneous. That way I don’t know whether it’s Lockpick bobble heads or gunpowder!lol
---
That genuinely surprises me in all honesty. Scrolling through the rewards I just see garbage i would drop for low level players personally
---
No one’s gonna take a gamble on the emote!? I’ll get it regardless in about 3hrs and will let you all know if no one else has by then
---
He’s holding a freshly baked potato and gun is sitting on it. It’s all good.
---
Great thanks for the answer
---
The chat was fairly active for me, it's worth a download. You can tell who does and does not have it when you see them, if they have the mod their name is blue rather than yellow.
---
Downvoted for commenting against OP with objective facts.  I’ll try to counter with my upvote.
---
Bethesda gave us many ways to earn Score by just playing the game, good to see NW got the option as well.
---
Yeah. I accidentally bought the new bundle. At least I could have gotten something cooler x.x
---
wtf are these comments?
---
no. you cannot "buy SCORE" with atoms. two weeks into the season, you can purchase each *rank* for 150 atoms each, if you like.
---
Fuck that Fallout Shelter shit
---
This. Would love to know if its same vanilla salute with pointless icon, or are we actually paying for a new emote animation.
---
Fun times. Also confirmed.
---
That’s okay tho. There’s a lot of different kinds of people who play this game. What appeals to you may not appeal to someone else. For example I like to make a more creepy camp, with lots of clutter but most of my friends like the pristine newly built camp look. You can’t make everyone happy. I hope they continue with the seasons and add better rewards in the future and look into how many atoms we get from it so it will be more comparable to what we used to get from dailies etc.
---
Is grass disabled in your ini? After a couple weeks of terrible support, they told me to buy a new graphics card. So I looked at the original ini files compared to my current one and Grass being disabled was what caused it.
---
Not necessarily.  I think the last couple new bundles were set up as 2 weeks (if not more) as well.
---
Your opinion is kinda selfish, I know a LOT of people that enjoy NW myself included, so the fact that you are able to increase your scores it's a very good thing for people to play both modes. Just because you don't like doesn't mean that is a bad thing, you are not force to play it.
---
Was just thinking this. Sounds aggressive as hell. 
---
What kind of monster murders a cow.
---
spelling * Am * hard.  English : learns it
---
I totally agree, we would go out of our way to make as much atoms on our own throughout the week. It feels great to finally make a purchase on something you really think is worth the atoms but when you accidentally purchase something you would never normally buy... ugh. We’ve each done it twice. Obviously I’m still bitter about it lol 😤😫
---
For some reason, some of my weekly challenges appear completed already, I havent even done anything and I didnt recieve any score points
---
one click buying? it's definitely two. one click brings up the description and pictures of the item(s) and the second confirms the purchase. it seems like you need to just be more observant.
---
Science confirms herbivores no longer get any buff from meat.
---
What a bunch of incompetent clowns working on a buggy and poorly maintained engine. Actually, you know what, I take that back: the people who are forced to work on this pile of garbage are probably even more miserable than any of us. Blame it on the higher ups who prioritize pooping out more MTX crap over actually working to improve their core product.
---
Can we have just 3 people in a public team? Don't like the idea of me and two others I play with getting stuck with a rando.
---
Haha what the fuck is Light Footed Perk??
---
Wow that is some crucial info. Thanks for sharing!
---
Bloodied builds rip
---
I have a VE LMG and I'd love to have some other options than.. actually I don't think there are any options?
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
This is my second time too. Which is why I'm upset. 1st time is an accident. 2nd time makes it a trend and I really don't want it to happen a 3rd time. Which is why something needs to happen to ensure it doesn't.
---
This is terrible! That was one of the best perks in the game. I use it with almost every build... WOW!
---
there are NO rear iron sight. so no, it doesnt have ironsights
---
Here's an odd thought about this point:
---
 **Teams:** A player who has been kicked from their team after dying in an instance will no longer load back into that team’s instance. 
---
So - if I join a team and die and they kick me from the team I come back in a different instance and can't get my stuff back? That seems like it could lead to a LOT of grief in public teams - for example a group of friends takes their private team public picks up another player plays for a while letting them build up and carry stuff then lets them get killed and kicks them from the group so the player is dumped in another instance and they can take their time with his dropped stuff? The player wouldn't even be able to go back to pick it up as they're now in a different instance. Heck they could have a player help them then let them get killed at the end so they don't get any rewards.
---
Just wondering if this might need a re-think.
---
Karen to Todd, Karen to Todd, come in, Todd
---
Already got you, son. You have more than the average player of a particular resource or item. 
---
You gained this without duping. But you assumed someone else got something only by duping. 
---
And neither supply was particularly difficult to get in the first place. 
---
**Hypocrite**
---
Try again elsewhere when it’s actually a likely dupe story. Eight TSE weapons is hardly ‘dupe-likely’.   Eight thousand Holiday Gifts is within that reason. 
---
I got five TSE weapons just from Fasnacht drops. But clearly you’ve had difficulty grinding legendaries and think 8 is somehow an ‘unrealistic’ number, lol.
---
Bummer.  Dudes wandering around “on fire” (god mode) was amusing
---
I actually leave metal letter notes around for people that like to explore the camp.  Mostly on the roof.
---
and they want 5$ bucks for it
---
Anyone know if the Flight helmet set has immunity to airborne or waterborne desease?
---
The carry handle is optional on AR15. Plenty of civilian ARs come with iron sights and no handle.
---
Do the weekly challenges. 
---
Other than that, the XP one repeats so you can do that over and over.
---
Not just bloodied lol
---
Broke it as in it doesn’t work at all anymore??

Raiders. That's who.
---
Man, judging from the comments some people are never happy.
---
Tbh, I don’t understand how a immovable camp can “grief” anyone in the first place. If you can walk 30 feet and can no longer be effected by the big mean camp, then what is the problem?
---
Nope they have never released a skin for it. It definitely sucks
---
But you don’t have to play NW? You’re crying over literally nothing that doesn’t affect you in any way whatsoever?
---
And this kid is such a hypocrite. He’s got ‘thousands of Ultracite scrap’, but insists it was all gained legitimately over a year and a half of playing. 
---
He doesn’t see the irony there.
---
Holy fuckin shit this was awesome
---
The creation club was also [widely criticized](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/06/the-pros-and-cons-of-bethesdas-creation-club/) for not approving and uploading the most requested mods, and the ones they did upload they jacked up to insane prices and fucked over the people that actually created the content. I much prefer the independent system where they enable mod functionality to be seamless, and from there you can donate to the mod creators directly. For example, I really really really appreciate SFE which enables most mods (not unlike skryim) and the text chat mod (shame on you Bethesda for not having this) so I gave each of them 20 bucks last month. If we had the creation club I would either not get the option, or pay 10 bucks of which the creators would get 25% of that instead of the full 20 bucks. 
---
We don't need more monetization and the idea they've floated that its required to "develop" the needed systems is ridiculous and misleading. All they would need to do is publish documentation and enable mod developers to access the information they need directly rather than reverse engineer the game files and get through any obfuscation Bethesda bakes in.
---
I guess I don't feel so bad about not being able to farm atoms now that I've seen what's for sale
---
stop torturing me and just give me the damn BOS stuff
---
It's considered one click buying because it doesn't ask you twice.
---
I know but this is fallout. Most players know about the service rifle and the assault carbine and both had carry handles. I figured Bethesda would have left it on.
---
we've identified 'the friend'
---
A thousand pardons my leige
---
Yes it doesn’t work currently after patch 20! I want a refund on those skill points!
---
the whole skin is lazy and unfinished. request a refund on it.
---
It doesn't work at all.
---
All* builds rip
---
u/Ladydevann
---
Thats not the biggest downside of the score system if you look closely you will need 25 more SCORE points for every new score level which would add up to about 3500 score points need to progress from level 99 to level 100 i didnt do the math but I actually quite sure that even when you do all dailies and weeklys you will still need to buy atoms/levels in order to reach max rank.
---
Pictures*? The 2 images after that clearly show it working properly. Theres only 1 image that looks "broken"
---
Yeah but try to land her corpse a little bit out of respawn area to have a chance to loot her DNA.

---
The last 2 backpack skins I bought clip unless I make my character super skinny anyone else have this problem?
---
Read the patch notes.
---
or raspberry, for that matter
---
What makes no sense to me is that they could’ve used the combat rifle animations for it, as that would’ve (if memory serves correct) not have caused any issue with the reload animation clipping, as they have a straight magazine. I really do wonder what the thought processes are like when coming up with these ideas
---
whats "the xp one?"
---
not home rn
---
I love base building, but even the items they're giving for that doesn't interest me other then the clean sink, but it only interests me if i was able to get it from an ingame store as it's not worth grinding for. With the mothman stuff I have my favourite dark themed stuff as well. The last few updates all had stuff I loved or liked, this one had things I want to avoid as it's only content. Feels like a kick in the nads which is why I'm salty.
---
Kinda disappointing that we get no new challenges. Guess we're time gated....again.
---
It's not.
---
Wasn’t added in this update
---
ah, another person who swallowed, hook like and sinker, the round earth hoax

---
 &gt; We're looking into this, thanks for the report!
---
Same finished weekly and no 1000 points.  What else is fucking new with this game.
---
There is no carry handle.
---
Came back recently after a year long break, I'd be down to help you out and play. Psn x_xPunk
---
 This kind of stuff is actually really insulting.  Someone sat at there desk and produced this atrocity and then shipped it to the atom shop without a care in the world for quality.  Anyone who had a hand in making this skin or seeing it before it went live should be embarrassed.  You have to wonder what kind of structure they have over there that allows stuff like this to slip through the cracks and make it to live.
---
I separate my camp with two buildings to keep allies from wondering in where I don’t want them. My generator and vending is in one, while crafting, bed, and instruments are in the other.  
---
This seems to keep allies and Rogue Traders from opening the vending area up.  I’m not positive that they wouldn’t enter the building, but it looks like NPC’s prefer areas they can interact with.
---
You can expect nothing from Beth and still be disappointed.
---
Maybe that's what was intended all along, although I very much doubt it. Thank you for your science!
---
FOMO is the new gamedev fad since lootboxes are passe now.
---
Exactly!
---
The new bugs...
---
I never suggested the camp was griefing me- Or that the camp was some evil sentient being. It seems you are incapable of reading others responses or don’t want to have an actual conversation about this. Have a good day.
---
You all said the same thing in slightly different ways.
---
Sadly. It should've been a standalone weapon to begin with imo.
---
I didn’t buy the under armor yet. So I would have to buy that and the shielded mod separately correct? What was the price of the shielded mod?
---
Fallout: Tactics had pvp. It was actually awesome but nobody ever used it. Pvp isn't totally alien to the franchise and I enjoy it's addition, I just wish more thought was put into integrating it.
---
it's so anyone can loot the piles...
---
See and the most recent updates have been completely lack luster for me- I could care less about having a shiny clean red rocket camp :) but I’m not salty - just glad other people are enjoying it
---
Hi all, thank you for the reports, we're looking into this Challenge on our side right now.
---
Thank you for the video! I will raise this.
---
I caught a player running around my camp turning off my lettering and ceiling lights. 
---
You don’t play XBone do you?
---
Next month probably.
---
I honestly figured it would be more than that.
---
[seems so](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hisnug/adrenaline_perk_broken_patch_20/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
I thought we were talking about the atom shop updates sorry?
---
Shit this is a good bug! I say leave it as is! But only if it just doubles and doesn't mess anything else up.
---
i lost it too. i don’t even think most of us were supposed to have it in the first place
---
Shielded won’t apply on mine. Lets me spend 4 flux a pop tho
---
Solved: you have to build a new one to get shielded on
---
just fyi, i think the it might just be that the little flair notification didn't pop. I opened up the board and it says  rank 2 -1000/1025 now. if that means 1000 + the 1000 from rank one, its counting right, but it just didnt notify.
---
Watch the vid, I already know about the patch notes. The shotgun was doing full charge damage while tapping in vats, it should be doing half. The gauss rifle was fine though
---
It's a two finger salute, new animation.
---
It does!
---
Due my calculations I got one core at least in 75% of rewards. I actually stopped doing the quest bcz of "no more space" in my inventory/stash.
---
If that was just an oversight (and, honestly, I can't imagine any technical reason for it), it's just further proof that the devs don't play their own game enough. Otherwise there would have been at least ONE PERSON on the team supervising the SS armor and mods stopping, "wait a minute, did we forget to add deep pocketed mods?"
---
How hard is it to just make the mods inherit the default mod list from all the other armor types?
---
gaming
---
You would nuke the mine, but the event was delayed for more work.
---
Endurance does nothing on equipment, I'll be keeping shielded raider, thanks. You can just use the marine tactical helmet for water and airborne disease immunity.
---
What a bummer huh.
---
Same here. 
---
Also gathering wood not counting correctly. Seems to be counting the number of times I collect wood, not the amount. For 176 wood gathered I got 20/100
---
EDIT: it seems I got my SCORE points for it about 10 min after finishing it.
---
How many score points get you a rank in the season?
---
where'd you get such a sweet deal? I paid 60 bucks for it.
---
Whats grass?
---
Not long. Most challenges are easily done under an hour- depending on level of character
---
Got downvoted to hell yesterday because I foresaw this
---
Nah it’s fun with the flamer mod
---
We were talking about the garbage that is seasons which if you want to count as atom shop go for it but it isnt.
---
enjoy ur grinding like never before!
---
How much was it?
---
What, the Uncle Sam one? I’m pretty sure you were only supposed to have that if you got the tricentennial edition of the game. I did notice that I had two of those in my wheel a few days ago, so
---
I’m level 50 right now and I’m leveling up at a rate of about once a night. That’s something like 2 hours of gameplay maybe?
---
Gramps is the best ally by far. None of the other even come remotely close. I built the guy his own shrine. :P
---
Oh boy , yet again this pathetic company has done it , ffs
---
Well there is a combat rifle skin in *seasons*
---
Not instant though. Have to wait two weeks.
---
Sorry I got a little mixed up - no need to be hostile about it :/
---
is there a daily limit or something to that effect? I know you can only feed so many rounds but once you hit the limit, can you instantly exchange it for whatever type and then feed it some more?
---
good luck with the moon thing!
---
thank you, please get the devs to fix this. This is one of my favourite weapons
---
Oh no no I was not attempting to be hostile, so sorry I tend to come off like that
---
That's bad but also good, i mean, you're not getting the SCORE points but you also getting items that probably will never come back lol, i would really like to see pictures of that
---

[Salad Father](https://i.imgur.com/qxKDHLY.png) was my discord nickname in a couple servers for the duration of Fasnacht.
---
FYI that’s how wood Challenge’s have always counted. It’s super annoying but yea, it’s basically how many logs you harvest from.
---
The drum mag animation is horrible
---
Thought I was tripping out, hope this is addressed quickly.
---
Big fucking surprise looool
---
Delete your strings files YOU moded.
---
Gotta delete mods that modify the strings.
---
i was also in workshop build mode when this completed.
---
Put mine in a couple minutes ago! Congrats!
---
Wait. It came out already???
---
Ok, congrats, and thanks for confirming you can earn enough score in one ~~day~~ hour for five levels. Or did you whale it by spending atoms?
---
They said public events give score. Plus xp earned. That’s not time gating...
---
I just assumed that was because someone else killed the targets 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I mean, it makes sense. Herbivores do just eat plants, after all.
---
Anyone else having trouble crafting this? It makes the noise but doesn’t take resources. 4 flor flux btw
---
So the best underarmor in the game now!
---
where are you registered ?
---
 Happened for me as well, got the wreath, Christmas tree, and a Halloween paint for my 10mm.
---
He means in the season, his rank.
---
These aren't replacing SCORE, they're triggering as if they event was active at certain xp amounts after the game.
---
You can’t buy levels with atoms for another two weeks, buddy.
---
Come on, you can't expect them to not fuck up something that shouldn't even affected by the patch...
---
Bloodied unarmed builds are absolutey insane. Got one character that can get up to 8k damage per hit, sometimes higher. It's stupid effective against the queen when she lands.
---
They are most likely referring to the new seasons ranks for getting items and not the level of characters that just released today.
---
There's already a work around and all punjis that are already made or blueprints are legacy now.
---
The Trappers of Appalachia are here to stay.
---
So you are getting both?
---
Yup.  Feel rather demoralized right now.  I would play for a few hours several days during the week to complete dailies and a few weeklies just to earn 800 atoms to spend on a few select things.  I had 660 earned in the last few days and was looking forward to get a total of 840 to get the bundle with the globe and futuristic stairs.  I would have to spend a good portion of the week just to get the 5-6 levels to earn 150 atoms through their new program.  What a waste.  Uninstalling for now.
---
OH, I didn’t realize that started today
---
Good to know. Thanks
---
Can't whale it yet. I conveniently was building a new camp and just happened to grow a level after completing my first event when logging back in! I'm not going to spend a single atom on leveling up unless it's a last hour of the last day of week ten and I'm almost at 100
---
Trolls did this at Fasnacht, too &gt;:
---
Fair well to the trash dumpster stacking a holes that think they are pvp gods. Let’s me honest though it still won’t level the pvp playing field
---
Damnit that’s a good idea.
---
150 atoms advances you to the next level
---
Sorry, the other post mentioned nothing about it automatically applying to underarmor already owned. Thought it was worth mentioning.
---
I know, there's a fine line with "fan" stuff. If you want to see more fan made work that you may not hate, check out  [https://www.youtube.com/user/InfectiousDesigner](https://www.youtube.com/user/InfectiousDesigner)
---
Anybody that’s ever played Fallout 4 knows that mods cause the lookup failed, not the game.
---
Yep, I've discovered that what would be a headshot with a rifle, is not for the bow. 
---
Not sure why that is, but it's bloody annoying.
---
I heard about some people having problem leveling up past level 1. Is that true or are you already past level 1
---
Open map (options button) then d-pad right
---
Yeah. Wish it were too. They said they would look at adding it for future seasons.
---
Bashing helps...
---
Yup! People already have ammo converters even
---
It’s weird, I keep hearing about this but fast travel has worked 100% for me. Not saying the issue doesn’t exist, of course, just that it’s never burned me.
---
I think 200 or 250? Didn't really pay attention
---
The max limit is 2000 ammo points from what I see. I got 500 real quick by scrapping grenades and then turned 350 of that into 100 .50 rounds. Good tradeoff I would say.
---
agreed, so much potential there
---
Congrats to you!
---
Then don’t. Stick to adventure servers and grind public events?
---
Yea like 30 minutes ago servers came back up!
---
Oh hey thanks, it's hard work that often goes in thanked. But if I save just one moon horse's life... It's all worth it.
---
LOL this post, please post every time we get a patch.
---
What's need for it?? Any rep?
---
Oh man, now I’ve got a good reason to get through the mid day slump at work
---
It's not very good I'm rank for on the pass tho just do the weekly u can get them done fast
---
Yes, this seems completely separate from the SCORE challenges.  Apologies, the only reason I mentioned hat was to explain why I was in the game mode in the first place, my bad.
---
How will I cover workshop tables now..
---
Yo! I think I wandered through your camp last week. 
---
Did we both run after the Verti-Drone?
---
It was a bug that we had it in the first place. They just fixed it.
---
Interesting, usually it just doesn't affect strings that are unknown, such as new items - thought it would be the same for the other strings not included.
---
Maybe someday we can finally have fast travel mats again.
---
Thank you!!! This is great information I was all wondering about.
---
Sincerely, 
---
Someone at work.
---
Thanks, added to the list.
---
So I just scrapped all of my unused ammo and went to leave the machine and had to back out of every single screen that appeared which took up a good 100 or so clicks. Annoying.
---
Thanks
---
Yes, underarmor first. Then apply mod. I've had the underarmor in my stash for quite awhile. Bought the mod, pulled the underarmor out of my stash to mod it and the mod was already applied. Usually on underarmor you need to buy the lower grades (resistant, protective etc) and apply them first before being able to apply the highest grade (shielded).
---
Don't worry, that's cool, i really want those rewards lol. Thank you Bethesda, never change.
---
Yep, not only that you can't even use the Nuke Mines to kill people outside of PvP as well as the reworked PvP team lol get fucked griefers
---
A start, but Pvp nuka cola needs to go, that's still godmode
---
The thing doesn't even work normally. As bad as it sounds this bug is the most useful it's ever been.
---
\*rap air horn\* Now Im excited to get my +20% melee damage meats
---
Ha, perfect response
---
All of these solutes are so similar, I’m sticking with my raider solute.
---
Just to show allegiance really
---
Excellent. Thanks for the explanation. Much appreciated.
---
so false advertisement because it isn't actually broken?
---
that would def explain it, i wasn't paying attention to it that early for sure.
---
Well then you want to tell me i should level up by acquiring 10k exp for 100 score points ?! this system is a rip-off there is no denying
---
It’s... interesting.
---
Still figuring out some aspects of it but I’m enjoying it so far.
---
I’ll leave it at that to avoid any spoilers.
---
Adrenaline, the food that grants carry weight doesn't work and there's people saying that are no getting the SCORE points. :)
---
Is it a fixed amount? Or does it increase each time you achieve it?
---
I have no idea, it's definitely possible.
---
I think a lot of folks will just end up turning the notification off. It's not a bad thing, I'm sure there will be people who see that pop-up and want to join to socialize or help others, which is great. It's just that it's on by default and some player names are... not things I want to see while gaming lol.
---
I never trusted sleeping bags just sitting out.
---
Yes it is. I’ve noticed that my damage is not increasing as I kill mobs. Very unfortunate as a junkies build I rely on it a lot for damage
---
Weird humble brag
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKFfxNjp9wA this was from 3 weeks ago apparently.
---
How hard is it to level up on the score system?
---
Damn, best part though is the (build 5 camp) challenge glitched and didn’t give me my rewards... cant spell Bethesda without Bug right?
---
Haha I was looking forward to grinding out the season challenges, but looks like I'm going to be trying at get as much of that 26001 xp (or 14000, not sure but I assume the worst) as I can before someone realised they pushed the wrong button at Beth HQ.
---
Good enough for me lol
---
https://www.outdoorhub.com/stories/2013/09/09/the-meat-eating-habits-of-deer/
---
Herbivores have been known to eat meat, they just prefer vegetation.
---
Has this been verified yet? Can anyone try and put themselves in GM and let us know?
---
Does it make Ultracite ammo? That’s the real question.
---
Oh no...
---
I was expecting bugs this update what a shame hopefully they dont take to long to fix
---
They started too slowly IMHO.  A good portion of the cosmetics I will never use.  They're junk.  The ghillie suit skins?  Those are mostly for the pvp crowd, which is generally less than 20% of any rpg game community.  You have to earn 5-6 levels to get 150 atoms.  That's just stupid.  25 bullion as a reward?  REALLY?!  I finished the story and have only logged in a few times a week to complete some dailies and the odd weekly to earn around 800 atoms a week to buy the odd bundle of atom shop items.  This won't incentivize the casual player like me.  I paid for 1st for a month and was on the fence about buying another month.  This settled it for me.   I'll uninstall the game for now and wait for the brotherhood stuff to come.
---
Someone else posted that the amount of score increases each level? I’m not able to play until tonight but can you confirm?
---
Depending on where you're at you can also just unplug it so you don't show up on the map anymore. 'Course then you can't show off your dope builds but you don't have to worry about shoppers unless you're in a high traffic area
---
Not hard at all
---
If you don't like the game, don't play it and leave us alone.
---
If you don't like the company, don't play the game and leave us alone.
---
Either way, leave us alone.
---
To all the people commenting to let me know the patch notes have been up for 4 hours; the servers have been up for like an hour and I posted this 50 minutes ago.  
---
Cheers and get back into the Wasteland, jeez.
---
Sweet. Can't wait to get off work so I can play.
---
Piss off
---
Can’t speak for the rest of it but I’m at least getting the points.
---
$10 right now says that lookup failed is from using mods or messing with the ini file.
---
Completing scrapping Challenges will not progress if you SCRAP ALL JUNK instead of individually scrapping an item to get the desired component.
---
I am pretty sure you are correct lol
---
Feeding off this all day, so I’m sure it will be a good one😂
---
That's called Hunter/Hunted.
---
How is it a “rip-off”? Please elaborate?  Someone else just posted they are already at level 5 and another person said they could get through in less than 5 weeks.
---
Public events also give score.
---
I was wondering what am going to use my unemployment check on.
---
Yes, that's what I'm saying. I'm grateful you were able to interpret my meaning. 😊
---
For real!? That’s terrible. Added it!
---
Hear me out... or read my bad...they have traps in the game. They are Limiting what players can do and focusing on atom shop cosmetic items and making this even more a mobile game and not and online rpg. You can dress up as a raider or trapper but the second you actual do said things you get labeled as toxic. 
---
This is my experience from playing the game. what limited things they have besides the radiant quests they drip scrip and bullion to us over time crumb by crumb. So in the mean time of this hamster wheel they have us on, they had traps that actually still worked from fallout 4 that the AI was too lame to really do anything with. We get all that against players as a supplement and addition to actual pvp. I’ve killed more players with my house than shooting them. It’s fun to figure it out. They say stuff like I copied YouTube or something but all it is is lots of spare time and trial and error. It’s fun to get someone to figure it out so you can build and improve. Some ppl are even cool and show u where the holes are. It’s a portion of the community you hurt but you hurt everyone by flattening out what’s possible. 
---
Not many games can effectively combine building mechanics with combat but what little we have we can scrape some fun out of it. If you fall for something you probably haven’t seen it before. That’s a good thing. Creativity is a good thing. More options are a good thing. This game is becoming a mobile game where you sell things at your doll house. You only dress up to look scary. Your level doesn’t matter cus exploits. It’s a drag. The setting has no relation to our activities and that’s a problem too.
---
To take that away and what do you have? You only have less, fancy guns with fancy skins jumping high and glitching through walls with your power armor. That’s not toxic but building traps and role playing by building stuff is bad?
---
Yea, that bad lol
---
We can only wish. Maybe that way assassin gear wouldn’t be totally worthless. But as it stands right now, that’s exactly what it is.
---
Yeah I’m sure you’re right, probably an easy fix
---
You should see the rest of the house!
---
It's not affecting all players
---
Yeah, I've still got a stack of single concrete barriers in the shape of a bunker that I refuse to get rid of cause it looks so much better than the actual one. Gotta replace my camp if I wanna move it, but it's worth it to have a neat guard post that nO ONE USES BETHESDA JUST GIVE ME NAMELESS NPC MARKERS I WANNA RUN A RAIDER CAMP
---
Thanks for all the nice comments guys, and the people that added me, let's play soon!
---
That's dope lol i need all of the seasonal rewards
---
Craft Higher lvl gun at your weapon workbench and make sure you have your cards selected
---
Hold the back out button circle on pa4 and it exits the terminal
---
Sounds great! Can you make a screenshot or a vid, please?
---
Ok, nice, I forgot about the two weeks until whaling, sorry. If I sounded toxic up there so you folks downvoted my comment: Not my intention, I'm happy if I can gain ten levels per play session, actually, and just wanted to know. ;-) Peace.
---
Oh sorry! I haven't seen a daily limit yet. I think you're okay as long as you don't pass 2000 Ammo Points. So you can probably use up all of your ammo in a day if you really wanted to. No limits that I have seen.
---
Its weird af lol
---
And something to finish the ceilings. V joint pine or even some stucco would be nice
---
damn, that plushie is chonky. I want it
---
No Rep luckily! Just normal everyday supplies. No flux either.
---
No more pepperoni roll buff? :(
---
With 10 weeks to level yourself up.
---
I don’t see myself using atoms to advance unless there’s a few days left and I’m behind. Should be plenty of time to just progress naturally
---
Oh shit you just saved me a ton of time! Thank you!
---
So u can complete the quest even faster :)
---
[Correct it's borked](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hisnug/adrenaline_perk_broken_patch_20/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Uranium Fever is where I’ve gotten most my legendaries. You get a few every time. If they’re bad, turn them in for legendary scrips and buy a new one at the Rusty Pick
---
Not at the moment. :(
---
Well I will elaborate.
---
Like I said the SCORE required increases by 25 every level.You only get 8 challanges a week tha will reward you 1000-1500 depending on how difficult they are.Supposing every rank would take 1000 score to progress through, the first 8 weeklies should get you to level 8 BUT if you keep in my the 25 increase every level you will need 1500 score at level 20 and 2000 score for every level after 50 so this is designed to get people to buy all the stuff they want cause you cannot achieve them with the SCORE offered from the dailies and weeklies. But yeah It's so nice especialls for people working 8 hours a day.
---
WTF, if you look at the clock slocum joes and scroll down, it looks like his eyes follow.... im kinda freaked out right now.
---
As always, tagging the Community Managers.
---
u/valseek
---
So is the 2000 ammo point limit just a storage limit or a daily redemption limit? And if daily does it have a separate limit per character or per account. I've got a lot of Missiles to dispose of.
---
&gt;public events give score
---
do they though? like has it been confirmed since go-live?
---
what about the excavator skin where the headlamp is missing in the preview shots lol
---
I'm pretty sure you can fix that visual glitch by getting in and out of your PA again, ffs
---
Seems to go up by 25 points each level
---
thanks
---
+50 atoms if you only use straws and air
---
I had no problem, I am already rank 5 now for example
---
You can still make private teams just like before
---
Same.
---
Thanks for this, I just unlocked the wreath in NW. Are there any more? lol
---
It's always been this way
---
Apparently the next one is the Christmas tree or the Halloween 10mm skin 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I am an Enclave Loyalist but I suppose I will take a listen tonight, As Peter Vincent said more than once. "Forewarned is Forearmed"
---
Anyone else notice the performance boost with update 20 ? It seems to be running a lot smoother for me.
---
Thanks again Beth
---
Same here. I receive a request to authorize Bathesda.net Helper to have admin access to update then nothing happens. Screen turns dark, mouse still moves, but I'm locked out of the system. Can't access task manager and Ctrl-Alt-Del does nothing.
---
I always thought this was just an odd design choice. Looks weird. I hope it can be at least toned down.
---
Wait you can get a dog?
---
Well they kind of *had* to fix it in order for the score system to function.
---
they won't, like they won't fix the plasma caster either
---
Pull my finger!
---
Weird. I didn’t see a mention of an ammo converter in the patch notes. Maybe I didn’t read close enough.
---
But then we'd miss out on the bonuses public teams get. That's why I was wondering.
---
One of them, but it still depends on your build. Raider shielded is still better for stealth snipers.
---
Awesome. I don't want to be doing NW right now, but this is hard to pass up. What are the requirements for unlocking this stuff? Just NW XP? Tough to tell without it being listed somewhere.
---
I’m just going off the faq. I’m not in the game right now. They are supposed to.
---
Can’t have all the hundreds of thousands of .38 rounds get converted into 5.56 in a blink of an eye. Ammo is more valuable than caps these days, it’d tank the economy otherwise
---
Asides from new bugs and public teams....nothing new.
---
Do we have to put down a new camp and rebuild for the weekly? I just build my new camp and i like it. :(
---
Add: PC client doesn't start after you press "play".
---
Still though, not great.
---
I’m wondering if their going to bring the servers down again for fixes today.
---
Anything that can only be done in a group.
---
The Wendigo Colossus event is not in this patch.
---
Psychotats will stack w/ Overdrive if you take Overdrive first. That helps a bit
---
Yeah usually just takes getting xp. And I totally feel ya, I hate NW, but free unintended stuff is free stuff! Surely they’ll stop this one sooner than later
---
LOL really? AHHAHAH
---
Yep. I never thought about repeating it though. Might try it out some. I unmarked the quest a long time ago, and have only done it just to push me over when close to leveling. Lol
---
Just bought it, yep it does.
---
Dear lord the new Atom Shop music is glorious

---
Got to love the AR-10 skin that says on the side of it 7.62 NATO that is for a not Chinese assault rifle that looks exactly like an AK-47 that is caliber for 5.56 within the game?!?!!
---
This is happening to me aswell! I was placing down a floor foundation and a steel stair to it for the weekly challenge and the stair cannot be scrapped or stored. My camp is RUINED...
---
They might be or wait for more bugs to pop up
---
Added!
---
Ok so I have ryzen 3600, and aorus x570 and mine is crashing in game not even a blue screen it just goes black and only happens in fallout 76
---
Literal grass in the game, like the tall grass that sticks out of the ground
---
There was an option to disable it and it would increase my FPS by like 20
---
You guys are awesome!!
---
Bought it, it’s perfectly fine
---
Lol literally just do what fallout nv did for ammo Bethesda
---
wait, so there is no time gate, you just have to go through the terminal and do 12 rounds at a time, each time? ami understanding that right?
---
Hang tight I am asking for some troubleshooting tips for you!
---
I work probably 12 hours a day on average. I know I won’t get all of them, but let’s use some real math. 
---
Assuming it increases by 25 per level, it means you need a total of 220,275 score over the next 10 weeks to complete the season 100%. 
---
If you only do weekly and daily events you get 215,000 score. 
---
This leaves you at a deficit of 5,275 score that you need to make up through earning xp and competing public events. This is totally doable. Not everyone will be able to, but the same people who aren’t able to are the same ones who wouldn’t be able to complete all weekly and daily atom challenges under the previous system. 
---
Of course some people will buy atoms. That’s how they pay to develop future content. It is no way mandatory though. 
---
I feel like I need to add that I am not a big fan of seasons, in fact I dislike the idea. I am just stating it’s definitely achievable.
---
Hang tight for just a moment while I ask for some troubleshooting tips for you.
---
GIVE ME A MR PEBBLES TSHIRT PLS
---
I didn't expect anything better from bugthesda.
---
Thanks so it seems this post could use some updating. Still helpful info.
---
Thank you for the tag! We're raising awareness for this.

Aye. Don't concern yourself with legendaries until you hit 50 and start sorting your build out
---
Am I the only one who likes the Screaming Eagle skin?  I hope they release the version with the wood fore grip also.

Just tested it. I can say without a doubt, magic weapons still are...magic.
---
It’s in the season pass thing, yo ;0 
---
Like rank 4 or 5?
---
everybody wanted this tho right?
---
Sigh.
---
Did they? I see the same challenges as before .
---
I'm surprised this is not on your list - maybe it's a console specific issue? Or maybe this is a bug Bethesda has already acknowledged?
---
The bug: Moving backwards (maybe all directions) while exiting a workbench has a high probability of forcing you to return to that workbench.
---
This one drives me so crazy. I've learned to not touch the joystick whenever I exit a workbench. And when I forget and get sucked back into my workbench, I get annoyed at the game and myself.
---
Where are you seeing that? The “build up” challenges are usually simple things like “build some lights”, “build a few doors”, etc.
---
Thank you and any idea how to link my acount to steam as my name looks like im a bot
---
I just got 1000 score for reasons unknown.
---
I’ve checked the daily / weeklies and none of those had popped.
---
I’m rank 3 with only 4 dailies done and no weeklies.
---
I can confirm it goes up 25 per level thus far aswell
---
How are people already at such a high rank?
---
I did that to my existing camp and the numbers weren't going up.
---
God,  I hadn’t even thought of that.  Most of the raiders are in their 20’s.
---
The worst thing about fallout, especially on PC, is the user interface. It's incredibly unintuitive, inconsistent, and a flat out annoyance to use. It's the biggest roadblock in getting my friends to play and the quality of life in game would improve SO MUCH if they put the time into redesigning it across the board. Sounds like the ammo converter is just another example of this.
---
You mean the economy that has already been destroyed by mass duplication exploits?
---
This is the worst counter argument I have ever seen
---
Then you finish the season. You have won. Wait for season 2.
---
The system has been out for what, a couple of hours? Chill out with the claims of "there is no denying." You haven't even had time to use it yet.
---
Yep, but you can only reach 2000 scrap points until you can’t scrap anymore. That is like scrapping 70 shotgun shells which can only be converted into like 7 of another one. I am obviously over exaggerating but is still pretty bad.
---
Okay, Todd
---
Ohhh I get you now ahaha and na I vant evan get to the startup page
---
I’m kind of excited about their return, hoping there’s a BoS paint job coming for the T65.
---
You can convert into ultracite?
---
UMMMMM EXCUSE ME SIR AND OR MADAM, BUT ARE THE SERVERS UP NOW?
---
On the plus side, seeing several posts from people who have earned the converter already after only a short playtime into the season, so at least they got that part right. Looking forward to playing after work.
---
Expected Bethesda to come out swinging with atom shop update since seasons hit today, but this is probably one of the most underwhelming updates we've had in a while.
---
Did you read the sub challenges?
---
Another one: modding the gatling plasma (with beam focuser I think) causes the plasma bolt fx to disappear completely. impact fx is also red instead of green.
---
Contact Bethesda support via support ticket.
---
I am not a fan of forcing people to play NW to max out on dailies. The silver lining I guess is that the NW challenges are fairly simple and would probably take less than 15 minutes to complete. If there is 1 NW winter daily, then you would miss out on 1750 S.C.O.R.E  points weekly if you skipped every single one, which is a fairly hefty loss.
---
Same here. I knew something was wonky with my damage but couldn’t guess which perk wasn’t working.
---
Weekly challenge points are either not being rewarded, or being rewarded after only finishing part of it.
---
Thanks, there are more that have the same problem.
---
I appreciate you doing the math but I have to add that you dont get score by completing events only by getting the XP. So I was right when I said that you cannot complete it a 100% even IF you do ALL the weeklies an dailies and this is super lame.All in all it's not surprising to me because on the one hand its Bethesda and on the other hand they will make quite a bit of money off people having a real life and no time to grind this shitty season for 200+hours.
---
Flyboy helmet uses headlamp light effect even though it has no headlamp.
---
I’d be surprised if that’s ever addressed, they’d have to created new meshes for every single outfit otherwise
---
Bond? Like, with the Factions?
---
Yep the terminal just cripples the entire system and many others as well. Terminals seriously need a redesign.
---
Not getting points for finishing weekly challenges...
---
Events dont seem to be giving score aa far as I can see
---
So is the 2000 ammo point limit just a storage limit (like the 1000 scrip max) or a daily redemption limit (like the 150 scrip per day)? And if daily does it have a separate limit per character or per account. I've got a lot of Missiles to dispose of.
---
Pretty sure it’s a feature. Saw it in the PTS.
---
It’s probably to make it so you can’t tell who owns them or some dumb shit to reduce workshop “griefing”.
---
🤦🏾‍♂️
---
It didn’t do it until the update prior to this one.
---
Same here. Status switches to "Running" and then just stops before going back to "Play"
---
And why are people still buying them. I was selling some bobbleheads:
---
x1@ 1c
---
x1@ 10c
---
x1@ 100c
---
x3@ 1000c
---
And I wanted to lower them down as they were being bought (to avoid someone getting all of them at once). 
---
I didn’t get a chance to lower the prices though. People that visited were buying at those prices.
---
Killing robots gave it to me at 3/5 as well.
---
I’m guessing it ain’t too bad ranking up? Not sure what OP has done since the servers have come back up, but from I saw elsewhere here it’s 1000 SCORE per rank. 
---
Daily challenges give 250 and... I think all the weeklies together give 7k?
---
Yeah those numbers aren't going up when I build.
---
Early ranks are easy to get by, especially when you have all the weekly challenges available. After that it will be a huge grind.
---
According to the FAQ you do get it from completing PUBLIC events. If you aren’t seeing score awarded at the end of a PUBLIC event, that is clearly a bug and should be reported.
---
Here is more math- that 5,275
---
Score deficit can be closed by getting 527,500 xp over 10 weeks (or 7,536 xp per day). That’s really not that hard to do just by playing the game.
---
It is nice that Bethesda is not putting at at like tier 70 as it is only tier 5.
---
Do we finally have a use for missiles? Can we scrap them? 8D
---
Do you mean the rank requirement goes up by 25 SCORE each time? So 1000 for rank one, 1025 for rank two, 1050 for rank three, etc?
---
My camp was built over a npc camp. Before today when I loaded in the npc camp would be replaced by mine. Now the npc camp is back and it's structures intersect mine. 
---
I love my spot on the map and the camp I built here. I have absolutely no interest in moving and really don't want to rebuild. As silly as it is it makes me want to just turn off the game and not come back.
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
How exactly does it work?
---
“Bethesda is patching us griefers out of the game!”
---
Boo. Fucking. Hoo. Go play Rust or Ark. plenty of opportunities to be garbage over there.
---
Just get a double barrel with quad ammo and 33 like me:)
---
You'll have to file a support ticket here for that: help.bethesda.net
---
I like your attitude.
---
that doesn't really make sense. the ability is already there, they just made it as cumbersome as possible. and it's not something that requires skill or time investment, it's just testing your patience.
---
Where are the [collect 200 flux while naked reward 20 atoms]  challenges?
---
Have you tried switching servers a few times to see if it always happens? That would be annoying
---
Yep.
---
I need 1050 score for my next rank.
---
So far I don’t like this.
---
Seems like I’m going to have to play EVERY day and do every challenge to hit rank 100.
---
I tryeid it requires a file if somesort that I dont understand
---
RIP
---
Firstly you can’t even scrap most ammo types, I don’t even think missiles are an option. And it is a storage limit like the 1000 scrip max.
---
I have none of these issues.
---
Walls don't work but the floor decorations do count.
---
My sense is that you can do it by claiming a workshop, too.
---
Or alternately you could make a new char, throw them a bunch of materials, and just have them build. You probably wouldn't have to waste any time getting them new patterns or anything like that.
---
feel free to add me, i like helping level up folks. 😊  ill be on in a couple hours.
---
psn = catsword
---
So do you have to build the terminal separate?
---
I figured. Which is why it blew me away that the converter came so early in the season.
---
Yeah, I'm on my 5th public server. Even tried my private server. 
---
Used to he the npc camp would only come back if my wife loaded her private server and I joined her. If I went public or hosted a private it wouldn't be here.
---
It's unbearable for sure.
---
I got it, walls don't count even though it says walls or floor deco. The floor deco is counting.
---
Yeah I did the year for the value and also figured that way if I take a few days off I am not sweating wasting my month.  Yeah sometimes I grab about 4 workshops, set up scrap collectors, core’s, lead, whatever and do my event thing.  I let them get attacked and wait until it is a take them back as you only fight 1 rd and then grab them back all my resources are loaded.  And no worry, plus the survivor tent.  You can use with workshops as fast travel spots and suddenly you are paying almost no caps in a session.  And no PVP or someone running in one shooting Uranium Fever or something.
---
I agree. To the developer that pushed this out: where is the love of your craft? I mean, this is literally what you do for a living and this is the product of your labor? What the actual fuck?
---
Here come the posts. 🙄
---
Geez, I’ll add that to the list
---
You haven’t noticed it then, everyone uses the same animation, and in the reload animation, the hand clips through the magazine
---
Are you getting an error message?  If so, what exactly?    
---
Does the screen hang?   Does the game close?  Are you using the launcher?  Have you attempted to use the exe file to launch the game?  
---
IOW, give a detailed accounting of "how" the game "won't load".
---
It's a part of it, but that is the interface that you use. A lot of clicking through different buttons.
---
Just checked my atom shop and I also have the halloween ones, so looks like they're both active for all.
---
Hmm. I’m going to have to check later. I’ve never had a problem with this challenge before.
---
welcome to the angry club
---
The score requirement goes up each rank so 4-5 weeks is inaccurate
---
So is there a catch up system in seasons like Warframe's Nightwave or is it treated as an actual race to do everything and have no life?
---
Bethesda, fire the person who came up with this.
---
How the hell did they break adrenaline, for crying out loud lol.  Guess I will finally get around to playing with some of the sneak perks for a while I have never had enough points to use.
---
Damn. I thought the list posted when it hit the PTS had both Missiles and Mini Nukes on it. I stockpiled a ton just in case they ever rebalanced explosive weapons and now I'd rather just junk them at this point than wait more. Oh well if they aren't eligible I do still have over 5,000 syringer ammo I could feed it instead. Lol.
---
full health or low health ?
---
I love bethesda.
---
Adjust your settings before getting into game. Make everything low quality and full screen.
---
Close the game and open it up with new settings. See if it works and let's you progress.
---
If you manage to get outside then you can log off and change your settings back. If not then idk might have to keep repeating until it works.
---
The terminal is part of the ammo converter placement, the UI is a cluster fuck
---
When not enough special to share a perk card it will bug out on one you can.  
---
So if I didn't have 9 charisma to share inspirational lvl 3.  It would say this on every lvl 3 card in other specials even if I had enough.
---
Fix - Share lvl 1 in the same category and then try again
---
I can't start via admin not an option when right click tryed starting via a home shortcut and via steam just a black screen and closes nonerror code no nothing just steam seis its running then black screen and instantly closes it afterwards
---
Here here
---
Same here. If you figure out a workaround please post it. I've disabled all mods and checked the files. Still no good.
---
I have a magic double barrel that 1 shots everything shy of the queen
---
if it does.. its broken.. judging solely by the text on the card
---
You build the converter and to use it there is a terminal-like interface. It takes 3 clicks just to select what type of ammo you want as they're all separated based on high/low power ballistic, energy, etc. 
---
Then, you only can convert a set amount at a time- i.e., 18 .38 rounds for 20 points as an example.
---
The maximum points it can hold is \~2000.
---
You need to navigate through that menu all over again.
---
Took me 10 minutes to convert all my .38 that I could spamming the buttons.
---
Yes how dare people complain about lousy design.
---
Same lol
---
They only work on leather anyway. That would be 2 fixes, maybe in patch 34.
---
Nice try Todd
---
I read you comment as Deep rockets lol
---
Dude that's awesome!  So the BOS dude getting his armor patched is doctored to add the BOS logo?
---
Full health, instigating or anti armor explosive lever action with fast reload. Vats 25 if you use vats. Bloodied if you are low health. Junkies if you like a debuff. Commando Handmades are always good as well with anti armorfor full health.
---
Underrated weapon, stalkers the dragon. It’ll one shot, with sneak, most anything when solo playing but you will need a swap to clean up other mobs
---
Alright put this in priority to fix
---
BE25 Dog Treat
---
Did you read the patch notes?
---
You do!
---
You get around 1000XP for doing one Faction Daily.
---
Around 200XP for killing a L68 Super Mutant.
---
Ah, so that's why things are showing up at weird times. I finished the robot quest but it didn't pop. Probably did earlier.
---
It certainly is interesting - I can see how it encourages you to join public teams, since you get the XP boost. I believe I've already gotten 300 points from the XP gain, but I don't know how that's going to translate over the long haul.
---
Looks like I'll finish most, if not all of the weekly today..which definitely seems to be the way to get the most points...really wish that public events awarded points (because I have 13 recall cards I need to burn).
---
patch notes says it does.. havent seen one in game yet since the update
---
Honestly? 10k isn’t much. If you run events and constantly run around the wasteland killing shit you *will* reach 10k multiple times.
---
And then you use the points to buy whatever type of ammo you want?
---
I have it fully modded now and I'm gonna keep it since I have 56 full Plasma cores lmao
---
OMG YES!!!!! Thank you so much
---
They might be on the list but I am not entirely sure.
---
Why would i read patch notes when i can come on here and ask a question and have someone tell me the answer?
---
What’s the free item in the shop this week?
---
I'm playing on Xbox and noticed the following. S.C.O.R.E. points being randomly added when I complete a requirement of the challenge but not the challenge itself. Have noted this a couple of times already.   
---
e.g. I was doing the "Destroy assorted robots" weekly. I was at 3/5 when I suddenly got rewarded points while killing a robot. I checked my challenges and was still at 3/5, so I continued to complete the last 2 requirements only to not get the rewards when I completed the challenge.   
---
Not a game breaking bug, since I still get the same amount of S.C.O.R.E. points but it seems kinda wonky so far.
---
Because they want to push as hard as they can for people to buy atoms in two week sand buy out the track since doing it normally will be slow as fuck.
---
Have you looked at your Event Viewer to get a hint about what is causing it to close prematurely?
---
Can't help, but how difficult was it to get the ammo converter?
---
They've stated that higher ranks will require more SCORE to complete, so it will take somewhere past 5 weeks, but how close to 10 weeks is yet unknown as we don't know how its scaled towards the end right now.
---
You need to be teamed up with other people for a bit, you max out with a full team
---
Do you need the plan?
---
How have u played til 42 and only found one legendary what
---
are they buffed because youre on a team or are you seeing this lone wandering?
---
*Laughs in Spear*
---
As a high level player it is definitely a disappointment. I doubt I will bother using it in it's current state as it just isn't worth the time and hassle of going through that menu.
---
I could see it being handy for new players with limited resources though, especially considering how early on in the season rewards you can get it.
---
Not difficult . I started playing at 2pm EST and just got the converter
---
It's wall decor and floor decor. Not walls themselves.
---
But...It's  Tuesday isnt it normal ?  Dont they always do this on Tuesdays?
---
It's not slow as fuck though, it's pretty decent!
---
Glad you like it? I'm already annoyed by it simply because looking over this board and knowing that if I want to complete it I'll probably have to log in every single day... antithesis of what I want from an online game.
---
This may seem like a whinge, but it really isn't at it's core,  but I guess it's something to use once and a cool addition in principle, but I get the feeling it's REALLY not an end game item. 
---
For instance, I have just got it 5 minutes ago, and I can state categorically I will never use it again.
---
The interface using a terminal is ridiculously slow, you have to navigate screens and keep getting reset back to the start for what amounts to virtually zero reward, and after a couple of minutes it is already the most mundane and tiresome thing ever.
---
I converted 250 ammopoints worth, and that was enough for 20 5.56 ammo. It took about 2 and a half minutes.
---
Having said all that, the model is cool as shit I think, and I think it's purpose is for lower level/mid game players who haven't played through a million times, and haven't sunk endless hours into learning and farming all the best spots to just make an ammo. 
---
I feel that was definitely the intention. To make it boring, and cumbersome to try to do it for bulk ammo, but useful for someone who is desperately running low and needs ammo to continue (something I distinctly remember at first when I was a fresh faced newbie linking into the light outside the vault).
---
EDIT- Though in principle that makes it somewhat useful, in reality the people in this game are kinda cool at higher levels, and I don't think new players struggle for ammo as much as we did at the start of the game because nice folks are droppnig it endlessly for them. I would rather go and drop all my ammo I don't want/use for a new player to kit him out for weeks, than use the machine myself again :D
---
Yes, using the same interface and clicking through. Expect it to take an equal amount of time.
---
Unless it’s a radically new weapon (plasma caster, 3/4 of the gauss weapons, bows), I don’t see them just adding them in. On one hand, yes, I’d love for the service rifle to be its own weapon. On the other hand, at least I can still use the handmade I’ve had since forever and not worry about grinding out the RNG for the same effects on a different weapon.
---
Yes but the problem is going through 3 different menus to convert. "Add ammo to get tokens" then "Low power ballistic" then ".38" and then redo for each 18 bullets
---
Side question, how do you get atoms now? I've done most of the "combat", "social" etc challenges, all I had left was dailies and weeklies
---
Any idea how long estimated
---
I saw datamined pricing a while back in some thread.. are the prices still that high or did they lower them?
---
You're the man, thanks!
---
I've done 3 events and only got SCORE for one of them. What gives?
---
Yeah I also thought that and was confused for a bit after completing two events and getting nothing :(. It’s disappointing but eh.
---
The supply box is actually a junk item you can scrap for a bunch of basic scrap
---
Ahhhh Kay that makes sense
---
I'm not sure what that is like I seid new to pc
---
I got to level 145 with a regular handmade just fine. With a crappy build and not knowing about getting masses of lead in the mines.
---
Ah, never noticed myself. Don’t know what that says about my eyes 😂
---
It always depend on the charisma stat which card in any category you can share. You need three points in charisma to share any level 1 in any category, 6 in charisma to share a level 2 in any category, or 9 charisma for any level 3 card in any category. So if you didn’t have 9 charisma, you really can’t share any level 3 cards anyway.
---
Because it takes less time and effort reading the notes than it does making a post and waiting for an answer?
---
You buy them
---
I'm not getting SCORE from events
---
Where’s your credit card?
---
For me I think they completed after doing only 3 of the 5, it was hard to tell with a lot going on but I THINK my s.c.o.r.e adds up. This was the same for all the ones that are 0/5 and although I got the s.c.o.r.e, the quests were still not greyed out until I later completed them (Where nothing happened).
---
My camp budget was maxed out, then around the time they were repairing the vending machines. I noticed my budget was only 3/4 full. Suspicious if you ask me.
---
Mehhh just came home from work thirteen hours for me to dl the Update eben though its just 11 GB. For fucks Sake Why my siblings have to be netflix junkies i wanna play this shit :sad: :jumpoutofwindow:
---
Lol it’s ok. Certain backpacks don’t make it too noticeable but other ones almost half disappear into your back.
---
Umm, no.  It isn't more accessible to casuals.  It is more restrictive.  
---
In most games, I consider myself a hardcore casual.  I usually play a good 200-400 hours until my playtime wanes.  I played through the story in fo76.  I have been logging in 2-3 days each week to earn several dailies and the odd weekly.  I usually earn around 800 atoms each week.  Then, I would spend them on something in the atom shop that I particularly wanted, most often some building cosmetics.  I wear the chinese stealth armor 90% of the time, so none of the clothing or power armor skins have any allure for me.  I looked through the SCORE rewards and saw all of 3 items that I would have spent atoms on.  I would waste my time on the rest.  I purchased 1st for a month.  I was on the fence about continuing the sub.  This change to challenges and atoms made the decision for me. I will uninstall until the brotherhood quests come.  I'll spend a week or two completing them and then uninstall them again.  In the time where a bunch of us are quarantined for a good amount of time and have a lot of games in the backlog, it is a poor choice like this that drives casuals away from a company's game.
---
&gt;ification didn't pop. I opened up the board and it says  rank 2 -1000/1025 now. if that means 1000
---
The reward is given at the 3/5 mark of the challenge for some reason.
---
Or that other thing,  that would have been nice too.
---
U r right. Better to downvote the topic.
---
Credit card, debit card or paypal
---
When you haven't had ice cream for over a year, you sometimes dream about Phish Food...but when you're making your way through your 8th pint to make room in your freezer for things like meat and hot pockets, you can be forgiven for thinking that too much of a good thing is, actually, a bad thing.
---
Claim workshop and build there.
---
&gt;There are fewer Atoms overall up for grabs in this new system, but you will still earn them as you increase your Season rank, as well as from our Lifetime Challenges, such as Character, Combat, Social, Survival, and World Challenges. As a result, you will still be able to save up Atoms for Atomic Shop items, but you will now also directly unlock lots of new items, including cosmetics for your characters, like Power Armor Paints, Weapon Skins, C.A.M.P. items, and more by ranking up. This wasn’t possible with the existing Challenge system, and we feel that Seasons in many ways offer much more value for your play time as a result.
---
I hope this is a joke.
---
Fo1st, your wallet, or the non weekly/daily challenges
---
150 atoms every 10 reward levels
---
I’ll do the math now and see. Another side note is I just collected 370 wood and it’s only registering as “37/100” on the weekly challenge lol wtf.
---
The stats "show" it's as good as PA but the actual effect isn't.  PA has like a 98% radiation reduction that isn't shown.  In PA you take about 2 rads per second.  If you down a stack of RadShield and get your RR up to 10k you still take 4 - 5 rads per second.   The stats don't actually show correctly.  Hazmat suits are the same.
---
Source:  Me in a nuke zone after downing 50 RadShields and having a RR of 12k still taking 5 rads per second.
---
No it really hasn't. You wouldn't get food/drink benefit but you'd still get the +stat.
---
You may not have noticed, but that's the way it worked.
---
And not to panic everyone, but also Canned Meat Stew no longer gives an XP boost for Herbivores. (I'm assuming it's Herbivore that's cancelling it)
---
Okay thank you.
---
Combat rifle has that Halloween skin from last year.
---
It’s only earned from challenges, not events
---
Too many man, too many
---
Hahaha! Good one
---
It really seems like " It just works... "
---
Kill legendary creatures. Turn unwanted weapons and armor into scrip at any train station. Take your scrip to purveyor and trade for 1* Range weapons. Bada Bing bada Boo..
---
I've never seen a trap camp lmao and I'm level 103. I did see a pretty awesome maze camp tho.
---
No you have to buy them now
---
It doesnt, use empath mutation instead. Angry Turtle did a youtube video about it and its a really good mutation now
---
That's not what passion aggressive means.
---
Passive aggressive is when you use apparently helpful words out actions to sabotage someone by stealth.
---
This is pure snark.
---
They actually decreased the budget cost for some camp items within the last few months, so that's probably why.
---
I know it's probably low priority but it'd be nice if Bethesda u/ladydevann or just anyone else recognized the FX bug with the gatling plasma, where the plasma bolts disappear completely. Still does damage but it's not as fun to use energy weapons when their projectiles are invisible. :(
---
We went from ~7500 atoms in a 12 week period to 1500 from the score system.  That’s ~80% nerf if you max your score points over the season.
---
Doing a few events and you are at the max.
---
Hey I still don’t have my FO76 on steam despite connecting my accounts in March and opening up at least 7-8 support tickets on the Bethesda website, am I ever receiving that game on steam or is it required to buy the game I already own on steam just to have it on there?
---
No really, downvote me as much as you want, I just tried to test it all, not having any of the issues.
---
[Color me not surprised at all.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfwh2r/ammo_converter_are_we_happy_yet/fw3pw38/?context=3)
---
That was indeed what happened to me. I did 3 of the CAMP ones and got the reward evn though the action wasn't "complete".
---
Edit- To add to this, the one for killing robots is the exact same. Ran to a silo for a quick run to finish it, only did a few and it completed.
---
It still does the same thing
---
I use to do it, if it didn't autocomplete for me, so it would for others lol
---
Stop trolling. This is an issue that everyone who bought the skin is having, check the top posts this hour
---
#good
---
its 300 for 100 5mm ammo, but you can get 60 points per 30 fusion cells
---
atm 0, as soon as i got more than 10, i put them in the vendor at 40c and they get away within some days
---
Well fuck
---
I pray the ammo machine takes these.  I’ve got 120 or so.  If I ever go below 50 the game starts raining them down on me.
---
I read that it might be the Well Fed bonus expiring. I haven't had a chance to investigate this yet but it sounds plausible.
---
Full, preferably
---
madlad
---
Credit cards at the ready
---
hmmm does this 'point' weigh anything? like does it grant you some sort of token or is it just a point registered on your.. machine? I'm kinda thinking about converting all my unused ammo into points and then not converting them back into ammo for carry weight's sake. Just for less stress
---
Oh WOW! That really does stink! My friend lost everything in his scrap box, the second day of the Fallout 1st rollout. Bethesda eventually gave him a bunch of stuff back, but in the meantime, me, along with other friends, gave him a bunch of stuff to keep him going. Hopefully you had friends to help get your armor made again.
---
Are you sure you weren't accidentally placing stored things? I was doing that for a bit because for some reason I had like 20+ lightbulbs.
---
Bam-a-Lamb!
---
(Whoa Black Betty!)
---
What I found is that for some of the weekly challenges, like gather building supplies, it gave the SCORE points prematurely (e.g. if there were 5 objectives to complete the weekly challenge, it would reward the points after getting to 3/5 for some reason). It then didn’t give anything when the challenge was fully completed. But I had no way of knowing which challenge those points related to because it didn’t show it as complete until I reached 5/5.
---
Radshields don't stack i thought.  I think the bug is the radshield not the PA number.  My SS set with rad shield has more or less the same rad gain as my ultracite PA.  I guess the real place to test is by the water in radiation rumble as rad numbers would be so incredibly high (i hit 2 k unsuited) you would see minor differences.
---
:) I thought the same and that is why I published this info hours before the patch (not days). But I suppose for now is ok by Bethesda.
---
That thing looks huge! Where the hell am I gonna put that in my camp?
---
I agree it's not at it's core, but I don't think it being slow and inconvenient and boring is intentional. I just don't think it was very well thought out. I feel like it was something quickly added without much thought to make people excited for the seasons
---
stole
---
"Outclassed only by Power Armor"... The test has determined that is a lie.

Also the hand clips through the magazine, and the front sight blocks the crosshair of which you’re actually aiming for
---
In all seriousness you get 150 atoms every ten levels with this system so over the next ten weeks you can get 1500 through the game. So not alot forcing you to either buy atoms or a 1st membership
---
I placed one and am afraid it is backwards.  Can’t wait to log in today and see I failed at a 50/50 shot.

warning its barely functional. Stay on the window where you have the site open or it will refresh constantly and you will lose your progress and expect 1-3 weeks for a shitty canned response before you can reply and talk to someone who is actually reading your text and can help. Remember to be nice, its not an hourly workers fault that bethesda sucks the big one.
---
Per account. The consumable ones will only be awarded to your current character, but the camp items, skins,etc are all shared
---
It was back when power armor was in stacked aluminum foil phase.
---
I like to keep about 5, max 10.
---
The quantities are so small. To get any meaningful amount you have to spam the interact button for like 10 minutes
---
That's going to be one hell of a hotfix.
---
It's almost like player feedback helps make games better. Who woulda thunk it
---
Yes but not being able to share a card triggered the same warning for other cards.  So sharing a viable lvl 3 in luck with 9 points would give the error 'not enough charisma points'
---
Same thing happened to me, I did two of the weekly challenge and didn’t get any points
---
Ah okay cool I see it now then. Make a new character grind it to 50 for the pass delete character rinse repeat to maximize pass.
---
There's also 1500ish available through the season, basically 150 every 10 ranks on average but I might have missed one or two
---
Still a downgrade from challenges but at least we get something
---
And we get a bunch of free cosmetics and such now
---
I'm going to be trying as hard as I can to get the fireplace secret door at rank 100 lmao of all the rewards, that's what I want most
---
worst part about that challenge was I bugged out at the "build 20 light or power connector" and didn't even get the Exp at the end lol...
---
Or do world, character, etc. challenges. Easy to still earn then as a new player but if you’re a veteran, credit card is the only option
---
lol hotfix.. they tested it on the PTS yo..
---
what could go wrong? Im sure its working as intended
---
this should have been a Combat Rifle/Fixer Skin
---
100% they stack.  The most I got up to was 16k (cost me like 70 of them, thankfully found 200+ in a vendor cheap).  At 16k I still took 3 Rads a second so it wasn't worth taking that many.  
---
Test it in a nuke zone.  Hazmat &amp; PA have a invisible radiation reduction, it's in the database and everything.  You can wear a 500 RR hazmat suit and take way less damage then having your armor on even if it's above 500.  It's pretty dumb.
---
Lol I, good to know :)
---
This is exactly what happened to me. Never had this bug until I made my Gatling Laser Ultracite. Now I can't get it to quick swap with that gun no matter what I do. Fucking annoying since I was constantly swapping between that and my usual rifle during SBQ. I was really hoping the patch would just quietly fix this... Noooope.
---
unless there is something that we can directly benefit from, fixes wont come until the next major patch. if we're lucky.
---
The fix will just break more stuff. Been like this since day 1 LoL
---
for me, the weekly challenges unlocked after 3/5 sub-challenges....
---
Yeah I’ve done most of the challenges.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Was really contemplating getting one because the Handmade is my main gun but I'll stick with the matte black for now.
---
Yes, the total of SCORE to get to rank 100 it's giving me 223750 and if you divide that by the weekly potential of 21500 (without missing anything) as per op it gives you 10.4 weeks.
---
That's aprox 73 days, aren't these suppose to last 70 days?
---
I'm not saying that you're not having a problem with it, or other people aren't.  I'm telling you, that it all looks good on my end.... crazy much?
---
In terms of atom shop stuff. Although I guess it isn't fair to count the new ones since they are also going to be time limited after the season
---
There's a mod slot for it already. It's just set to "null." It would be easier than porting in a new perk card.
---
I believe it's just registered on the machine. If you have enough ammo that weight is an issue, you won't be able to convert all your ammo. I could only convert \~1800 .38 before I was completely maxed out, and that is one of the ammo you can convert the most of.
---
Which challenge
---
Only when I tag them with my own weapon. If the turrets kill them while I am away from camp i only get to cash in on the loot when I return. Wich isnt to bad either. And when you say ski lodge building, do you mean the one at the Top of the World ? because thats where I am located to curently
---
I would gladly take not getting a reward than having a foundation/stair monstrosity stuck at the corner of my fully built camp.
---
For me, it appears to be granting them at 3/5.
---
No such luck with the "Kill 10 Legendary Enemies" one though. 😉
---
Probably a bit of both, but Bethesda have never been known for making things easy or rewarding players just for having played a long time.
---
I really don't have any need for the converter, I can craft it pretty much endlessly from an hour or two server hopping the locations for the mats, coupled with the perk cards. 
---
It is tiresome and mindnumbing for a reason I believe, to make it barely tolerable if you need to craft a couple hundred rounds to get by early on, and be useless to people who have tens of thousands of ammo they can convert and dump where they've already done al lthe long work for it beforehand. 
---
I do think it's definitely been overdone though and when more people get it we'll see mass complaints or whines :D
---
It's another skin, not a new weapon.
---
I suspect the increase drops out at some point but I don’t know when.
---
You uh...you know you can’t be lured into a team versus single player PvP match any more, right?
---
Indeed it means that less puchases will be done in the Atom store (or people will buy atoms with real money...).
---
Missiles are an option, so are nades for the launcher. 
---
But you have to have a min of 3 missiles or 5 nades to convert
---
I might have replied to one of your old posts..
---
I wish I knew what it was that made it just start magically working for me out of the blue after 6+ months of nothing.. 
---
Id love to help you.. but Im sure youve probably tried any and all suggestions thrown your way regarding this
---
hope you somehow get it going yo.. GL
---
Is Bethesda aware the about the father winter helmet bug? People who were lucky enough to get one during Fasnacht still can’t craft a new max level one even though the game says you will be able to if you drop it
---
Yeah cause all sharing is dependent on charisma. Like if you have 12 point in luck and want to share a level 3 luck card, you can’t cause you only have 5 charisma. That’s always been that way. I may be reading this wrong, but I think that’s just misunderstanding that system in the game
---
Send a video of your reload then. I’d like to compare them side by side
---
Oh good lol
---
The robot one and the build up a C.A.M.P challenges
---
Crap. Well guess you shouldn't expect much from something you can get within 2 hours of gameplay
---
The interface is my only issue. **It just happens to make the device not worth using**. It is mind-boggling that they did not use a slider interface when something like that is already implemented in the game almost everywhere else.
---
Whoa whoa what. You think Bethesda is made of money???
---
+30 for standard players, +35 if you have FO1st
---
Don’t like it don’t use it. I like it so I use it. I get like 100 to 200 5.56 every time I’m back at my camp. Keeps my handmade happy.
---
How can I be in passive and take damage?  And why do I take damage spawning into my own Camp?
---
If CAMP, then no damage.
---
I realize it is then an issue for endgame players. It is probably why I don’t feel as worried by the reduction of atoms gains but I totally see why endgame players are disappointed.
---
I've gotten stuck in some of the weirdest places you can imagine
---
every other legendary still does tho...
---
I'm sort of on the fence about the whole thing.
---
On one hand, not every available weapon needs to be viable end-game. There's no reality where a Rolling-pin should compete with an Ultracite Gatling Laser. They should just be more common for early game.
---
On the other hand, there's SO many useless weapons that they just clutter up the legendary loot pile.
---
Yeah. If somebody is on a team and they shoot you, and you shoot back, you’ll be doing PvP with *only* them. The only way for a full team to get you is if each person shoots you, and shoot each of them back yourself.
---
I have a question. For US time are the servers down or up?
---
You mean 150 every ten ranks right (not character levels)? Didn't see those at first, I suppose it's a decent compensation.
---
Yeah I want that fireplace more than any other reward
---
Oh wait, you're right. I think somewhere it was said that after rank X it was the same number. After rank 50?
---
Need someone to confirm thou maybe I'm missremembering
---
yup just remove  **RatMonkeysEasySorting** (data-strings-delete all)
---
You act like they give us a slider for all the other things they implement like this. Lol
---
Oops /s
---
Yes ranks sorry
---
You have to factor in the repeatable 100 SCORE from gaining 10k XP, as well. If that turns out to be a tiny amount then it won't matter of course, but it's possible that grinding XP (or even just naturally earning it through play) will offset what seems like a shortcoming right now.
---
I hear “Low Tech, Low Power” or “Protect, Low Power”.
---
Guys im noob. What is that thing everyone mentions?
---
Yea 1500 total is pretty decent I guess. I'm happy with the ammo convertor already, even if the interface is a bitch to use.
---
I actually didnt get a reward either. I'm so bummed right now... A broken challenge AND a ruined camp. Sorry for ranting here.
---
I have to agree. Scrolling through like 4 menus to convert 10mm ammo at 24 rounds a piece, which have to be in your inventory (stash doesn't count), and the damn terminal won't even tell you how much ammo you have left before you convert it.
---
I have literally thousands of these rounds. I'm not sitting here mashing space bar for 30 mintues doing this 24 rounds at a time. Did they actually use this before deploying it or bother getting any feedback at all?
---
isnt it expensive AF too?
---
I really prefer to craft it.. at least in the quest for materials I am gaining XP.. and tho it is a small amount, crafting it also..
---
GL yo.. just keep on clicking.. lol
---
okay can you scrap all at a bench or do you have to scrap individually.
---
It's SO TEDIOUS TO USE.  It also take me like 20 clicks to exit the stupid thing.
---
You most likely did get it. The challenges are awarding the score after doing 3 out of the 5 objective challenges, but only award it once you complete all of a single objective challenge.
---
Example, for the collect resource ones, if you complete 3 out of the 5 objectives, you get the score. however if you have to kill 10 legendaries, you get the score once all 10 are dead
---
I was mentioning the bug where when you go to fast travel nothing happens, I think he was mentioning everything else you see on this sub.
---
What? No, it’s like the 4th thing you can unlock. It only takes maybe an hour of playing.
---
I empathically agree.
---
Putting aside the conversion rates, the actual mechanism is ridiculously convoluted.  Having to select the ammo type and figure out what each category each one falls under?  Only being able to scrap a dinky amount at a time even if you have thousands of it?  Having to go through the whole menu over and over again?
---
Did anyone with a meaningful amount of ammo bother to test this?
---
Here's how it should have worked.
---
The spinny bit that does nothing but a cosmetic animation?  Yeah, insert your ammo in that, just like a Scrip machine.  Use the Terminal.  Confirm that you want to grind the ammo.  Get AmmoPoints.  Use Terminal to buy ammo with AmmoPoints.  What's so hard about that?
---
There are no talented UI designers working in BGS, which is a shame.
---
What? Yes it is lol. You pick up ammo from the world then convert it at a bench so your weapon can use it. This ‘converter’ is awful.
---
Ah yes, it reminds me of how I did thing when I began modding using the Creation Kit, before I knew how to use the built in scripting papyrus language.
---
I suggest whomever made this to learn to code.
---
I did, and no one was paying me to do it.
---
All that did was prevent new track camps for being built. There is a thing called Legacy camps my guy. Trap camps using stacks of punji boards are now one of them
---
same here
---
I mean the exchange rate.. not the unlock cost
---
Yea more microtransactions is what this game needs.
---
Under resources in the build menu. Weird, I know.
---
I grabbed it and you can remove the scope
---
I know on the wood that even if the wood pile says 8 it would count as 1. So you would in effect need to go to 100 different wood sources regardless of how much wood it actually gives you
---
Yes it is. Forgot to mention that. It’s just awful.
---
I guess.
---
But can you imagine unlocking *this* at tier 70?  How disappointing would that be!
---
Ohhhhhh "that 1" is sattire for the inumerous ones. . . .r/woosI thanks fellow Apalachian
---
Winter
---
For all the objective ones I've gotten the score after doing 3 out of the 5. The "wood" one has always been broken for me for the last 5 months at least. Taking off Woodchucker helps, but not a whole lot
---
Are you able to logon in about 5 min?   I will login in about 5 min.   If you respond.    We can see if we can work it out.      My game tag is daboxx.
---
So they fixed the Rootin Tootin Cowboy OUTFIT, but the Rootin Tootin Cowboy Hat still is broken. 
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
Nope It is the only mod I ever downloaded
---
Just noticed that there. Stupid though, it should say “collect wood 100 times” instead then.
---
Just checked and its not there, only the ammo maker
---
&gt; Personally I think the implementation is very questionable and I think the entire game needs a rework. 
---
Fixed that for you.
---
We have a fix for this coming! It didn't make it in time for today's patch but is addressed in the next one.
---
I agree
---
The way the selected line in the Pip Boy jumps about seemingly randomly, often back onto my favorite items during selling or moving is a nightmare. Up and down all the time like a drunk kitten.
---
Thank you I hope it magically works too :)
---
I've noticed that 76 has steadfastly avoided adding anything that requires them to implement some new interactive UI menu.
---
The Secret Service Underarmor (and shielded mod) is more than worth the bullion spent on it....
---
Bring a new meaning to the term "fetch quest"
---
Yep Broken
---
ha! bethesda honest...good one

This happened to me as well

Happened to me too, first challenge I thought I’d do thinking it will be straight forward......*sigh*

I have 450+ sitting on a mule

I'm a hoarder

Awesome. Thanks friend!

Hi! We have a gif of the new Flyboy Salute Emote in this week's Atomic Shop article https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4e3tPL9rI61gwsAaBjvDU8/atomic-shop-weekly-update-june-30-july-7
---
I just built it, it is under resources just like the ammo maker.
---
We're going to have some really fast SBQ kills for the next 1-2 months.
---
A bit of an L but guess i shouldnt be surprised
---
In the same boat.  Bought the SS chest but after 70+ rolls and getting absolute crap I think I've given up on getting the other pieces (except maybe the jetpack).  Now no idea what to use the gold on.
---
You have to select “back to the main menu” and then you can back out
---
Later this year most likely, but could be put off until early next year
---
That’s the one thing I’ve been holding onto my atoms waiting for, don’t wanna spend them in case it’s only available as part of a bundle.
---
Damn I’m gonna be back in about two hours but if you’re still there ign: Lionculb
---
Checked there and its not appearing
---
Same here. I’ve been going crazy looking for it
---
I just love the fact if this was Fallout 4 one could go in with mod tools, change the locations that the item takes up to just the hat slot, and done.
---

Isn't it amazing🤣 I was around lvl 50 playing with my lvl 80+ friend and he was taking me to all these areas he said i would get destroyed, pulled out the shotgun and from stealth just walking through things and blowing his mind as to why I'm not giant hermit crab food🤣
---
I’m finding some of the rewards don’t update until you’ve fast travelled a couple of times. Seems like a latency delay.
---
That sounds very nice, i'll see if i can maybe try that aswell. And that sucks about the scorchbeast queen hahaha, good one though and thanks again for the info.
---
Yeah, very expensive, if you want 20x 5.56, you need 200 points.
---
I dont think its worth using, so many menu's and sub menu's its tedious.
---
It'll cost you $10 and you'll be limited to one unless you pay it. /s
---
Trade glitch patched?
---
I've restarted to see if it will appear
---
Minor issue but purchasing flamer fuel via ammo converter it's labeled as 10mm instead.
---
No, I had a couple when someone escaped from Grafton jail!
---
I was sitting on 5000 for a while with the same quandary, finally bought the Secret Service Chest plan with the Jet Pack plan, first roll was environmental damage and poison damage so not too shabby. Used a nice chunk of change.
---
That's what you call, padding the new content.
---
[For anyone curious](https://cdn.bethesda.net/forum/uploads/f7a752c3-12cf-43b2-badb-3b85056daea8.png) (pic came from a user on fo76 general discussion)
---
they probably were stopping more ghouls from spawning
---
I'll never understand why they feel the neeed to implement the hot mess garbage that is the terminal interface in everything they do.
---
Having modded fallout 4 I can tell you it is far more cumbersome on the inside than it is on the outside. It feels like garbage to use it so they really should avoid it whenevcer possible. I can think of plenty of better ways to code this thing. Aggravating to say the least to think someone is getting payed to push out this crap.
---
Ah I’ve pretty much stuck with the Keep Out one since they released it
---
I've been playing since update 9 or 10 and oh boy, you won't believe how many times I'd die during SE and then have to fast travel all the way to Cranberry Bog from Vault 76
---
"roleplaying as a raider" has always been just a thinly veiled excuse for griefing other players. No wonder Bethesda is limiting it...
---
LOL :) I sort of gathered that, however I was just curious how much of an affect it has, can you jump noticeably higher and run noticeably faster?
---
Yes! Did two dailies for a total of 500, just completed the weekly for Build up a workshop and NOTHING. Still at 500. I took some screen grabs and am going to submit a ticket.
---
the last thing I ever did was set all my computer audio setting to default.. and then re put them how I like them.. which definitely did not work..
---
unless it took like a month to kick in the settings..lol
---
What... Both? Or just airborne?
---
No Joke. This is borderline useless. It gives such small value for the quantity you put in, so it's obvious they want you to put in a lot. I am just baffled by everything these devs do. Seriously. They should've just added a load screen for each time. Might've been faster.
---
Yeah i saw it, thanks for the info. I'll have a look.
---
It's appeared now :)
---
Thanks for the info /u/chaltimore and /u/PCDug! 
---
We've also confirmed internally that the Weekly Challenges are giving the correct amount of S.C.O.R.E., they are just doing it a bit early at 3/5 complete. So by the time you finish the challenge, you've already received the reward and it looks like you got nothing at 5/5.
---
We're discussing a fix for this, but for the moment you should be getting the right reward. Thanks again for the thread on this!
---
Is the glitch where if you used a NW profile Picture it would should nothing gone?
---
That’s a cool looking one. I haven’t used it in a while so I don’t know how it’s affected. One of the CM’s replied to this post btw.
---
Is that why the clean space suit looks like it has a weird tinge to it?
---
Uranium Fever and the Mole Miners outside of it.
---
Kill them and server hop.
---
This will help level you as well as give you a solid array of Gauntlets, Shotguns, and Rifles. 
---
Scrap the weapons until you get decent mods then mod a shotgun and a rifle.  
---
Probably only need Gun Crafting 3 to make them more than serviceable
---
Glad there was almost no effort put in to get it. That conversion ratio it's pathetic.
---
Emotes can freeze you in place until the game decides to let you move again 🙄
---
New weapons like that would be completely fine though if they had separate stats and there was no daily scrip limit.  Bethesda created this mindset tbh
---
I wish they'd stop showing it in preview pictures.
---
This better be an oversight.
---
Those skins literally have no use anywhere else.
---
It may be "times collected" not the amount
---
This thing is the worst. Who designed this piece of crap
---
Anyone with bulk on PS4 I will buy them
---
Best not to find it its rubbish
---
I have 20000+ ammo i wanted to convert, with 4 clicks for 12 at a time thats .. to much
---
"...so really, it's fourth, maybe fifth, only to all the armors you actually want."
---
This sounds great! Excited for that +1 Intelligence buff while leveling.
---
Dirty clown suit for 2 points, asylum outfit with sunglasses, in a cave
---
Butbutbut what do you mean people are angry?! Look at our engagement rate!
---
i know right..
---
i say.. if you have lone wanderer perk equipped.. you shouldnt see the notification at all..
---
fucking hud is constantly blowing up..
---
Check your Effects tab in your Pip-Boy. You should see a +25% XP bonus for each Lunchbox you (or others who are very near you) open, and it stacks up to a max of +100% XP. 
---
You should also receive an additional buff that can give you things like +15% damage to a specific creature type, enemies that explode into confetti instead of a bloody mess, reduced hunger/thirst, etc. Those don't stack with themselves, but you can have several of these buffs at once, depending on the number of lunchboxes you (or others nearby) have opened.
---
WINTER
---
Me neither, I just presume it is broken on PC, I think I heard one person about 6 months ago, briefly.
---
Good question!

---
I've got plenty of clips of Ward walking away from you as he says "Finally, someone with the guts to help".
---
I didn't know those would be lost in time, like tears in rain.
---
Thank you, appreciate it. Is there anything in your mind I could add or change?
---
RIP my camp spot
---
Yes! But for the destroy robots weekly!
---
THANK YOU
---
Yeah I think the latter is what they were hoping for
---
I’ve found them in the explosive containers and on super mutants. I mean they still aren’t really great except maybe the cryo one
---
Hopefully....
---
Last year they claimed early 2020 would add loadouts before wastelanders got pushed back.  Now they have already pushed back the new content we were supposed to get with update 20 which doesn't instill a whole lot of confidence in the rest of this year's timeline already.
---
Can confirm, also just finished the C.A.M.P weekly for nothing in return.
---
Personally I have an Uny/Powered/Sneak set and I love it. No idea how much shrouded helps tbh.
---
10 weeks*
---
Those are two different currencies, not exactly comparable. 70 atoms a week would be a lot to miss out on though.
---
Yeah, same. Got some toxic ones from super mutants. Assuming it's just some extra stuff. I don't think it's that big of a deal because you still can't craft them. You're able to loot a lot of different types of grenades from enemies that you can't craft.
---
Been at work or I would have bought it in a heartbeat!
---
I heard food effects are doubled now so you can get some good so boosts and maybe join an events public team for some ez levels
---
There up now.
---
It’s like they went for the most hardest to design and convoluted ammo maker. Just do what fucking NV did.
---
Thank you, you’re the best as always!
---
That's a great point about using alts, I'm sure there are a lot of ways that could help.
---
That said, I just updated the post with more accurate information. Grinding to rank 100 will definitely not take 5 weeks as I first supposed, as I wasn't aware that the rank requirement increases each time.
---
Take another gander at the post for an update!
---
Iteractive "slow like in the 1960's terminals was cool when it was new in fallout 3. Now it's just a slog. I get it, those computers are slow. Mine isn't. Just give me a nice menu like any other mother game.
---
The fixer is the new handmade
---
Is the set of dailies the same every day? If it’s not you probably won’t have to level up daily. They’ll probably change so you might not have to
---
Yah
---
Nope... =/
---
However, the 150 atoms per tier/rank is to advance each rank/tier, correct?  So, there are 100 ranks, that's 15000 atoms, or am I misunderstanding?
---
Good work, but, a lot of players like me are still waiting for a “text chat”. It would improve the gamers experience by a lot. Consider it please.
---
You’re not wrong
---
Yeah but it was boring and i almost always skipped that challenge, unless i was like 80% close to level up or something. Now you need to do it if you want to progress.
---
12.  Season is 10 but the cycle is 12 (well 12-13) and there are no atom challenges popping back up between seasons that we’ve heard of.
---
can you kill the protectrons?
---
Correct. At least its just "level up," and not some funky outfit / location requirements.
---
all linings are the same thing. they're just upgraded versions of each other.
---
having said that, there's no reason for anything other than shielded to exist. I mean, why would anyone buy anything other than shielded for their SS underarmor?
---
I have it, can confirm it spins
---
I had to push back a ton of times, but it did eventually let me out
---
&gt; they made it easier
---
I know right? As if gaining one level is even a hard thing to do... I often forget to sleep for a well rested buff or eat canned meat stew and always gain at least a level a day.
---
' **General:** Fixed an issue that could cause Daily and Weekly Challenges to complete themselves automatically. ' Fucking lies! Stupid game crashed on me while loading and it auto completed three of my weekly challenges and one daily. -\_-
---
Yeah it updated for me after travelling a couple of times.
---
it doesnt cost money.. but free isnt a word I would use to describe it..
---
you do not have to pay money to participate...
---
What are you smoking? I play other games and their seasons offer actual content (not just challenges) in the form of map changes, new classes, weapons, unlocks etc and their battle pass doesn't cost as much as Bethesda.
---
Also to add those other games are free to play, and don't have a monthly sub option. Anyone who thinks Bethesda's total cost for their battle pass is "not bad" needs to get out and try some other games.
---
Imagine paying almost $120 for some reskins and minor quality of life items with no actual content behind it.
---
Nah the level up challenge will be each day, the others might change.
---
Well at this point if it were at the end of the season and this shitty, i'd want to throw my computer out the window. They put it early to prevent complete chaos.
---
I will keep this thread open   ping me when you are able to jump on.
---
Ah sorry my bad. How do you know this btw? Did they clarify that?
---
YOURE WELCOME
---
I didn't see anything about public events giving you SCORE points...but maybe a missed it.
---
I’ve got some lever rifles for sale lol
---
OMG!  Yes.  I figured it would work more like how we sell stuff.  The slide bar on how many wanted to convert.
---
BUT NOOOOO.
---
You have to sell them 1 set as a time.
---
Same here, did the camp challenge and did nothing, I also cant scrap the stair and foundation I placed down so on top of all I now have a ruined camp...
---
&gt;VATS: Charging weapons, like Gauss weapons or the Bow, now correctly deal damage based on how much they were charged when fired in VATS.
---
But will they hit?
---
They should show that event some love then
---
The idea of accessibility was concerning whether a player could reasonably acquire most or all ranks on a casual schedule (not playing every day). It wasn't about whether this is better than the last system, which seems to be what you focused on in your reply. I'm not comparing atom gains vs season gains, but rather rate of gains in the seasons for a casual player.
---
That said, I had to update the post with new findings, because I didn't know the cost to rank-up increased each time.
---
When did they add the under armor mods? Today? Didn’t see it in the patch notes.
---
I also have my CAMP in a similar spot. Last patch, 19, it also did this on launch day, but after a few logins/24 hours it went away...maybe it will be true again this time?
---
I have a feeling the game saves a memory of your camp for AI spawns and pathing over time..IE my pet and collectron, and Beckett all learn a position over the course of like 4-5 logins and 24 hours after an initial placement. I think the patch resets this memory. Just a guess though.
---
Price for what you would pay. If you think it’s a fair price, it’s a fair price.
---
Currently at 6/5 for collecting junk and it won't reward it, but the game is still tracking it...so yeah shits broken
---
Nope
---
It was always the case before this patch, and it will be the same after this one. i am 100% sure.
---
It is so atrociously useless that I wonder how it made it to a public update. I scrapped like 50 bullets before giving up on it. Thanks for nothing, Bethesda! Altogether useless patch as anything dies before I can even shoot at it, I have just watched people kill stuff for 2 hours and my reward is this utter junk.
---
For selling.
---
It’s not a battle pass. 
---
But yes the season is free to participate in.
---
I love how I always hear about all those amazing glitches only once they fixed -_-
---
Probably the worst of it is how clearly it's not even intended for a pc port. Raising your FOV is borderline gamebreaking in some places, you absolutely need to use the PA pip boy interface at values above 95 since it just becomes impossible to read otherwise. Those institute terminals become impossible to read too. Who thought it was a good idea to have things like that be related to your FOV instead of just a menu that pops up?
---
 So in order to convert 1k .38 i have to go through 3 terminal menus 41 times and that's if I'm lucky and terminal menu doesn't get stuck on black screen.   
---
 After that i have to go and buy ammo  through 3 terminal menus 82 times if i want to buy 5.56 with credits from .38.  
---
 Who comes up with this torture?
---
Yep, I updated the post with more accurate information. As you say, the scaling toward the end might jump up even more, but if you do the math using the assumption of +25 SCORE needed per rank, the end result is that it would take about 8-10 weeks of grinding. Which seems very likely given that the season lasts 10 weeks. 
---
So at this point it's still uncertain, but I think the new information shared in my update is likely how things will play out.
---
I thought it was. Sorry for the misunderstanding
---
Yep, I updated the post with more accurate information. Thanks for pointing that out!
---
Yep, funny how just adding the symbol makes it a little more bad ass.
---
Great, can't wait to see how long it takes to scrap my 6000 syringer ammo. If it even allows that. Based on the ammo production machine, I wouldn't be surprised if it excluded those kinds of ammo types
---
&gt;	In Season 1, you will also be able to earn S.C.O.R.E. regularly by gaining XP, and by completing Public Events. 
---
[go down to the FAQ at the bottom](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/seasons)
---
Just make a new character and pick up the perk cards - blam - levelup.
---
15/15/15 DR / ER / RR
---
i figured it would be bad, but this slashed my already low expectation.
---
Not on 19, my Ultracite still had one on the head and one on the arms. Still in my inventory and usable pre Update 20.
---
It sucks balls
---
In the forest, but close to the ash heap by chance?
---
Ient it from the cabins with the screaming like south west of vault 76
---
I'd say you're on the money there, it just looks so well with everything put together.
---
It’s free. You can pay to advance ranks, but that is not required
---
Were you at those cabins? Do a little exploring. Read some notes. Follow the wire. 
---
I don’t want to spoil anything.
---
You cant.
---
Except it doesn't tell you how many "points" you get for participating a public event.
---
Fo76 is a rpg first and foremost. plus pvp in this game is essentially an afterthought.
---
In a few years if they keep delaying everything....
---
That's good. PvP in Fallout 76 has never been good &amp; since launch, it's been watered down or taken over by griefers.
---
Don't try it - if you want PvP, go elsewhere.
---
Why won’t they let us just key in the fucking numbers in this game? Sliders and fixed amounts are just asinine in 2020
---
I just barely got the ammo machine, i don't grind super hard for bullion so it'll be forever, but I'll get it eventually thank you all for letting me know
---
There is also the weapon quick swap bug that should be added to this list. It's been posted a few times but I think it happens under fairly specific circumstances - most of what I've read is quick swap breaks involves the Ultracite Gatling Laser. It ignores that weapon and chooses something else in your favorites wheel, or unarmed.
---
Edit: On Xbox for me at least.
---
Not sure if /s or not...
---
Ok? All I said is you can earn score through public events. You aren’t limited to daily and weekly challenges.
---
It made sense when you got the plans as part of a drop (if you only had resistant plans, that's what you'd use).
---
Character challenges, by advancing through the season ranks, or buying them
---
So there is a bug and you don’t earn score through public events like they said? Have you tried public events to check?
---
FO76 isn't a competitive shooter. Don't treat it like one.
---
Would’ve been more heavily celebrated if fixed 1+ year ago
---
Because people get different underarmors that gel with their builds....for mine, the SS one is perfect.
---
You just do.... this is Bethesda we are talking about
---
They were doubled from the second I logged in, not related to being in a team or not! =)
---
I honestly don't know how they managed to fuck this up. Or who the hell ok'd the design and system for conversion.
---
This was an easy fucking win, and they still ballsed it up.
---
It’s like 100 score per event too I think
---
Edit:in about a hour I will double check this and update so that my facts are straight
---
I know. I was talking mainly about SS stuff. like buttressed mods.
---
I have developed a passive habit of always moving my mouse in a circle after every action to make sure it reorients my choice back to where I want it. Something feels off about having to make that statement
---
People taking this post seriously. SMH!
---
It doesn't work, they probably thought about it and disabled the challenge in the tutorial.
---
Thanks! I was looking at the wiki and it looks like you can't get the dragon anymore? Is the wiki wrong?
---
Mine completed 2 steps before it should have
---
I know &amp; yes, I understand. But it's unclear if participating in a "public event" like Encryptid, gives you extra SCORE points or if its just part of the XP progression.
---
Instead of being happy that new things get added and that they at least care a little little bit about there game you guys just complain and cry about anything even 10 mins after something gets announced... but well your playgrounds gang logo is It ShOuLd HaVe BeEn In ThE gAmE sInCe LaUnCh AnD iT iS sOoOoO bAaAd... sadface
---
yup thats correct, so its expensive AF if you go the paid route instead of the gameplay route
---
 only way i can really see people paying to advance is if there are like 1-2 days left and they wanna wrap up tiers
---
Not if i was already on here. 
---
checkmate, atheists! Where is your god now?
---
Oh no it turns to goo just in the sky I dont know how many times i had to go up and glitch stack my tent or PA to get to the pile only for it to be a instigating knuckles.
---
And why the "spin" action? Why for nothing?
---
I just saw a video pop up by gamermomover40 about the brotherhood dlc pre quest being in game
---
That's true - no reason to get a lower level armor or mod.
---
AND YOU STILL CANT GET RID OF GOD DAMN MISSILES
---
thanks for the quick turnaround, its nice to see.
---
Captain Optimism has landed onto the Wasteland.
---
Do you think we’re upset about less greifing?
---
Still no fix for the ridiculous friends list synch issues on Xbox live? Lame.
---
Checked it out, thanks for doing the legwork (headwork? Can't do math with your legs).
---
Anyway, guess I'd better give up on hoping to get to lvl 100 before the season runs out. Though to be fair, the best reward here to me is the ammo converter which should be easy at lvl 5. I wouldn't mind getting that Blood Eagle handmade skin, but that's pretty far off. Ah well, at least I'll have a goal to try and achieve. And if I don't make it it's not the end of the world.
---
Didn't work out the math but 8-10 weeks would be what I'd expect them to plan for - doable but only if you commit to it daily.
---
Aye. I logged in and now i can enjoy my non-power generating water wheel.
---
I feel like once you reach higher levels, you'll be getting far more score from exp gains than from leveling up. I haven't played in a while but my main is level 340 or so and getting 600+ exp from scorchbeasts doesn't even move my bar a visible amount
---
I just checked on my machine, and yes you can, but the price is ridiculously high, using 250 points for just 10 arrows.
---
No, you didn’t lose team PvP. You lost the ability to drag your team into your mess
---
Your information is late for me sadly... but for the second run, I'll use the normal dismantle process.
---
Very weird that it happens on one of your xboxs but not the S. FWIW mine is an XB1X
---
I'm at rank 3 so far, so far so good brother! I'm on PS4 as well.
---
Seems like the robot challenge is also bugged for some. Mine completed 2 steps before it should have and just read someone who said it never gave him his 1000 points. Rip
---
They called out public events specifically. It would make zero sense for it to be part of xp progression since non-public events also give xp.
---
So you ran a public event and didn’t get score?
---
Same. The robot killing one, right?
---
Maybe the devs will see enough blowback they’ll be prompted to redo the UI. Oh well, I think I can still make use of this thing. I’ll just have to work it into my CAMP routine ... stock vending with ammo that sells, craft some ammo for my adventures, convert a batch or two of junk ammo to something more usable, and head back into the wasteland. From what is being described, I can’t see myself camping on this machine for large batches, but periodic conversions may help me top off the supplies. We’ll see when I get there I guess.
---
Ok thanks for explaining this to me.   Seems I have the wrong idea about it.  You would think with the hours I have I would have understood charisma points effecting other shares
---
Hi, some of the Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 complete instead of 5 of 5 complete. So you should still be getting your S.C.O.R.E., it's just that you already received it by the time you've fully completed the Challenge. 
---
We're investigating this issue now for a fix in a future update.
---
I've also seen a couple of people report that it took a few minutes for the S.C.O.R.E. they got from a Weekly Challenge to appear in their progress bar. Check again in a few minutes and see if your S.C.O.R.E. has appeared.
---
our group can get large if theres any game that has decent pvp.  we had some pvp last year at the ammo factory where there were about 16 ppl in the zone.  it was exhilerating.  very fun.  but SOOOOO rare, and with broken ass TSEs and Tesla rifles and permanent invisibility, just ruins it. 
---
Perception VS Agility should work.  it doesn't
---
Thanks for your thoughtful reply.  
---
Also sorry I can't get busy at work at any point in the next 10 weeks and have to miss playing for several days. And sorry that I won't be able to make up for missing 4-5 days going on vacation by grinding as hard as I want for a couple weekends.  
---
Super stoked that I am going to need to spend atoms (which are now much harder to get with the new system) to unlock the last several (or more) levels of SCORE because the developers chose to put in an artificial time gate to require you to play every day for 10 weeks straight to make it to level 100.
---
But bully to you for having nothing to do besides playing FO76 for the next 10 weeks!  #bestlife.
---
Not talking about the armco ammo manufacturer, which I would infer is what you're talking about.  This is the new ammo converter being referenced.
---
I’ll try and see if that works!
---
didn't even take a day to kill the hype train lmao
---
Ok. Fair enough.
---
It's still "clear as mud" as they say....I guess I'll experiment tonight. I have 13 Recall Cards, so I'll run a bunch of Encryptid and see what happens.
---
Because my hope was that public events would award separate SCORE points...but again, it isn't clear if it does.
---
I've recently been playing casual games in a window while watching things to take the edge off. Seems I might have to make fallout 76 windowed and convert ammo for a few hours while watching stuff too now
---
I found a mole miner with some
---
You tell em
---
Getting atoms is most certainly slow as fuck compared to yesterday.
---
PvP hasn't been a thing for me when playing Fallout 76 since Survival was removed. I mean, there's NW but meh.
---

 &gt; Hi, some of the Weekly Challenges are granting their S.C.O.R.E. rewards at 3 of 5 complete instead of 5 of 5 complete. So you should still be getting ...
---
Why PVP even exists then?
---
I have finished the scrapping challenges by scrapping all just fine?
---
PS4, if that matters :-)
---
But who doesn't love mashing the x/a button a million times to convert all their .38? I know I totally do!
---
Wrong vats doesnt work in pvp except for railway gun
---
You have to realize though that saying it and programming hundreds of camp objects and the interactions between dozens or weapons to actually DO that are two different things. Camps are already supposed to be invulnerable but loopholes let the damage occur.
---
It was like that back in the day when it was part of getting the junkie switchblade reward in survival mode...try toxic valley...took me about 15 mins 👍🏻
---
Yeah I was wondering why I suddenly got the score without having completed the full challenges
---
them to actually make it work
---
I think you can still make those; I just use the stair I-beam to create the lower row. 
---
That said, I haven't tested recently, as I just moved to an underground bunker. Thankfully those haven't been patched out yet.
---
Its the third reward so super easy
---
How does the converter “suck”? Don’t have it myself yet
---
you can claim rights like gameplay-walktrough videos.. well done!
---
There's also the tesla launcher which automatically connects electricity to any nearby players or NPCs, no aim required.
---
Scorchbeasts too. Found 2 Flamer 'nades on one during Scorched Earth
---
Well, I foresee a hotfix in our future...but probably not until after the 4th.
---
I did not get rewarded either, but saw some reward at 3/5 which might also have been 10k xp reward.
---
I'd still like to know if I can claim gold from the rank if I haven't earned the ability to get gold yet..
---
took the same screenshot to post as well! seriously fuckin clown shoes over there
---
Dude, there’s so much obscure stuff and wonky systems in this game, you can play for hundreds of hours and still not understand it all. I’m almost 2k hours in and still learning new stuff LoL. So can’t blame ya there
---
I have 2k + hours in Overwatch and was ranked GM around 4200 rating. 
---
This game is great in pvp as long as people dont cheese quantoms
---
What part isn’t clear? If you run a public event and you get score it does. If you run a public event and it doesn’t, then it’s a bug and should be reported. I gather you haven’t tried yet?
---
It'll be interesting.
---
This seems to be the case.  Did 2 events in a group and got 1k points.  Did the other 3 and got nothing.  Finishing the challenge earlier than we should isn't bad for the player so they'll fix it quick
---
That would be it, didn't realise it went deeper than the screaming, thanks.
---
Probably gave you free score, unlike the loss of atoms.
---
Can confirm I got some from a West Tek run.
---
Those skills don't add much gameplay benefit to my stealthish commando but I guess I'll go grab the shielded ss underarmor just for that extra +1 STR to endulge my hoarding tendencies.
---
It’s also build up a workshop so you don’t even need to use your own mats
---
you are talking about a bethesda employee lol
---
If you’d rather sell those 5.56 or trade for .45 let me know.
---
Oh shut up, if they gave a fuck it wouldn't take 10 minutes to convert and get 50 10mm bullets, the interface is hot shit and this being a new feature isn't a pass for it to be garbage.
---
This system already exists in the form of gold bullion, they literally had nothing more to do than create another currency that works the exact same and interacts with the machine.
---
It's incompent
---
I have - and it's impossible to tell, since I was getting SCORE points at the same time for other things (like killing robots, etc).
---
I'm not trying to argue with you - but please point to exactly where is says "you get X score points for participating in a public event."
---
Because if I have to guess how many points I'm supposed to get for Encryptid, Scorched Earth, Radiation Rumble, etc, that's a really, really, really bad design.
---
Only way they could have made it worst was a daily cap
---
Friends not appearing on 76 social list despite being on the xbox live friends list.
---
What level are you?
---
This is 100% what is happening.
---
I got my first mystery points killing a robot and then no points killing the last robot needed for the challenge.
---
It was the same before, it was annoying.
---
As of update 19 it also works with the steel door frame. It will even clip with the standard steel wall, so you only need to make the one door frame
---
Honestly that's roughly the same price you need to buy the full battlepass in fortnite
---
Yup, same here nothing popped up at 5/5
---
Considering you need to get roughly 1.5 S.C.O.R.E. levels per day to get to 100 before the season is over, I don't see myself putting in the effort.
---
It was worth it to me to log in each day and get at least 20-30 Atoms from easy challenges, but this new system makes me want to do them less.
---
Everything in this game is a grind already. Putting another grind on top of it is just too much.
---
God I want that fly boy outfit SO bad
---
Sigh. Ok thanks. Lol
---
I know what you mean but imagine connecting a wire from that fuckin wheel all the way to like some vending machines or something it would look so stupid 😂
---
Awesome!
---
This is gold 👌
---
It absolutely needs to return to the same screen after choosing which type to turn in. Instead it takes you back two menus and you have to spend an hour clicking away at this.....
---
fuck
---
I've completed all but one of todays and the weekly challenges, and when I'm finished I'll be **Rank 9** on the SCORE board. Of course, without the weekly events, each day will be significantly slower as time goes on.
---
Argh, I had one leg left on my SH armor to get this. Got all the plans in the actual vault before it closed, just needed the vault steel and was taking my time alternating with getting it and rolling bullion weapons.
---
Yup. What were they thinking? Why can you only convert a little bit at a time? and then you get sent back to the 1st menu. Who approved this?
---
DA FUQ?
---
I don’t have the “x”. I just have them saying you get score for doing public events lol. 
---
Are you saying the “x” is zero? That they meant to say, “you get zero score from doing public events”?
---
Someone else posted they were seeing 100 per event (which seems high but who knows).
---
It’s just an old visual bug, don’t worry. Try relogging.
---
That's Bethesda for you, no surprise
---
Always leave something slightly outragously over priced, people find themselves needing to unload caps because they are at max caps and you might get lucky boyo
---
I keep an alt who is at the stage in the quest where you collect the blooms, but I never make any. Everytime I load her into a server, voila.
---
I noticed the rank 2 needs 1025 points. So higher every level
---
You have to hold the back button
---
Ahhh, that makes more sense...sort of. So road leathers have different SPECIAL buffs than say, raider leathers or the vault suits?
---
This^^ 👍
---
This further proves my point of Bethesda can give people something for free that didn't exist before, and people will still complain about it.
---
the Enclave is selling the recipe for them thats why you see the high price. your looking for the serum once its been crafted.
---
I'm pretty sure if they knew what they were doing it would return you to the same screen for turning in the ammo type you last selected. But you know........
---
It's just unclear - which sucks. I mean, it could be 10 or it could be 100. Who knows?
---
The fact that they didn't bother to tell us, is a really bad design choice.
---
Some cunt was freezing me in place with his Cryolator, so I guess that's a thing now.
---
Same thing here, only with the build c.a.m.p or workshop challenge... Seems there are a 'few' problems.
---
Edit: it seems, at least for weeklies, that it gives score earlier...
---
Yes, and also the build up a workshop one
---
200 or so 😅
---
I'm 140 right now and started playing when the game came to Steam.
---
I already have that covered. And it's themed real nicely with real life.
---
Well, judging from the godawful UI, it will definitely take more than a few minutes to convert shit.
---
Have you seen this in the game? I know they said public events give score but haven’t found details on just how much. I don’t play until later tonight.
---
yes you can, you just need to have enough of them for it to convert.
---
That's what I'm saying.  This guy ain't level 360 it takes me 3 or 4 hours to level.
---
Craft it into bulk, then scrap it. Works for other materials as well
---
It’s definitely weird. I got SCORE credit for at least one of the weeklies when I finished just one of the objectives, then others I noticed that it didn’t give me anything when they were actually complete. My total seems right, so I’m thinking it’s just wonky with when it gives the points...but who knows.
---
Hire this guy
---
I read the Update and can't see this but the Workshop no longer shows what the Workshop has in it (like it used to say Steel 2 for Grafton steel, now Grafton Steel just has a standard icon. Also I took over Grafton Steel went to my CAMP and then had to pay 5 caps to travel back to Workshop i owned, is that the trade off, we get Caps in Season but we now gotta pay to Fast Travel to Workshops?
---
I'm on PS4 BTW.
---
I can confirm the Robot challenge is bugged, also the build items in camp, others have confirmed this also. I am owed 2000 SCORE.
---
They do - not all underarmors are the same, which is why people gravitate to one vs. the other. Personally, those are my three favorite stats, so it was a necessity for me.
---
For someone who is more agility / charisma or Intelligence, it wouldn't be.
---
Does anyone have a picture or Video of the Flyboy outfit ingame?
---
Also here
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/cZD7NWo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cZD7NWo.jpg)
---
^Yep just leaves the front sight post, which looks kinda weird without a rear sight.
---
On a positive note, when you add a reflex sight it’s perfectly aligned for full co-witness with the dot.
---
I heard they were taking food out of the game, but damn...
---
. i dont play NW why am i being forced to play NW to do a PVE game &gt;.&lt; so fing stupid.
---
people overpay in game transactions to sustain this live service game.
---
The deal is " you buy this side stuff and we'll update the game and make it better".
---
Nothing is free. it's just that someone else is paying for it.
---
Not a bug. Working as intended .
---
Road leathers and raider leathers are both under the raider category and have the same buffs. Vault suits are different
---
Your options are Raider, Vault, Casual, BoS and Enclave
---
Does Fort Campbell and the 101st know about this Screaming Eagles tribute paint job?
---
Ammo machine is hot poo poo. If you have 2000 rounds of let's say 5.56 ammo and you want to convert it to some other type,  it will take you ages to do so. You can only convert 20 rounds at a time and once you do, you're sent back to the first menu. Public teams are a bit useless imo but each to their own. SCORE system is pretty cool. I have completed all content as well as my build so it's nice to have something new to focus on instead of farming legendaries and doing dailies for the 5th million time.
---
Idiots need to complain about something!
---
no doubt. nothing like building and scrapping pieces over and over
---
If it’s weapons or armor* you can use the tool on fed 76 to see what range an item is in. It will tell you if an item with bash damage is better off being turned into scrip, sold for 4k, or if you need to trade it for other items cause it’s value is more than the 30k cap limit. It’s based on PC so the cap values are incorrect sometimes.
---
I don’t mind that as unneeded ammo is literally worthless to me. I just hate the interface
---
&gt;im just gonna be going afk and not even play
---
Today's challenge is to use 3 stimpacks. You can't really do that if you're just afk. That said, it's easy as shit. Just drop near the airport and loot all the crates. Hide until the storm hits you and then spam stims. It took me 5 minutes.
---
From what I have seen people are getting winter and Halloween items for whatever reason
---
Fast travel bug is still there.
---
That's clever.
---
Were the workshop icons on the map supposed to disappear?  
---
And its charging me to fast travel to workshops I control.  Anybody else?
---
Yes I’m not sure the exact amount but I just got 100 score for sbq I’m currently out running errands but I ran a Sbq before leaving home
---
I'm not even completing the challenges fully and getting half way and they just give me the points. This is so broken.
---
Or they could have made it like the fridge and you put ammo in it, use a terminal to set what you want to convert it to and come back later and pick up your ammo. No currencies, just have it auto convert based on a set rate and time.
---
Mr Pebbles Backpack return to Atom Shop when?
---
At least the radiant quests variated much more in fo4
---
I will
---
wait, it's not? the datamine said it was possible to buy it, it even has a price tag attached to it.
---
Whoever designed it, and whoever approved it.. Should really think about their life choices as game designers..
---
Well they don’t tell us a lot of things. Anyway I will test tonight.
---
Okay yeah that sucks.
---
Still can’t figure out if public events are actually awarding SCORE. Aside from that, it’s surprisingly generous. Daily/weekly challenges are stupid easy and dump points on you. You get 100 points for every 10k XP you earn—which sounds like a lot of work, but isn’t if you can kill big stuff. 
---
Got to rank 5 and the ammo converter in about 45 minutes, which included plenty of putzing around.
---
I am wondering at that as well.
---
In all of the Season 1 info it very specifically says Public Events. I've done like 8 events now and haven't gotten any score points from them.
---
thats pretty much what i mean do the thing go afk
---
I asked the question too - You're "supposed" to get SCORE for public events (at least that's what the FAQ says) but I have no idea if that's the case.
---
Seriously. It boggles my mind that they went out of their way to make it MORE frustrating to use. It doesn't take game design experience to recognize shit when you smell it. How no one brought this up internally is beyond me.
---
Pog champ
---
&gt;Next, select a goal for your team. There are currently six to choose from: Hunting, Roleplay, Events, Exploration, Building, or Casual.
---
why do these sound like "looking for" options on a kinky dating app
---
they are, just not rewarding at the right times it seems
---
Ahem...the season progression screen would like a word with you.
---
SHENANIGANS!!!
---
the same, haven't got SCORE points for robots and CAMP crafting stuff
---
Yeah, after I walk my dogs, I was going to do the same. I have, as I said, 13 recall cards. I can find out in about 3 mins, if I get SCORE for killing her.
---
Well my 50s Pilot themed character is gonna have a field day. And my wallet will commit Wendigo Cave
---
Did you look at the challenges? To have to do multiple events, and you get the score points after you compete 5 or whatever. It doesn't just give you a little bit after each one.
---
Empath gives team mates 33% less damage taken as u take 8% more. It is an multiplicative card, so if 2 players have, u both take 25% less damage. If 3 have, each take about 47% less and If all 4, take about 65% less damage each
---
Why God why... everything requires hundreds of points and you are making us sell them so slow. I have thousands of 38s and I have to sell them at 18 at a time. I have 6k of the bugger
---
Nah, concrete barricades aren't stackable anymore. Think that changed when they added the demolition system to clear rocks and stuff.
---
The place i always go to gather wood is upside charleston station. With the perk you can easily earn 300 wood
---
Oh god. I hope this bug is not back for me. Had it for the longest time. ;-; and then it just started working normally.
---
I'm not getting rewards for some of the challenges when I complete them as well as this
---
In my eyes it was Knight Moreno, getting his armor patched up at Deep Site V9, ready to hit Glassed Caverns for Op Touchdown.  Dudes face just knows he ain't coming back.
---
which events "!" events or non " ! " events?
---
Sometimes it feels like they're just trolling us
---
That sucks :/ i was just missing a few plans and then the grind for modules/steel. Was so excited with the bullion to be able to actually do the challenge :(
---
They've all worked for me so far.
---
Hey quick question, are the servers down?
---
Don’t share rad sponge unless you wanna become hated by bloodied players
---
People who complain like this 99% of the time are people who have never participated in the creation of anything novel or interesting themselves.  Just fucking consumers.  Wasting your time complaining about a goddamn **pastime** - which is, in itself, just another way to waste some time.
---
Go piss uphill.
---
That's still one click from viewing to buying. 
---
Otherwise you could also say this is 3 click buying (Atom Shop -&gt; Category -&gt; item details -&gt; buy), which of course doesn't make any fucking sense.
---
I may sound like a broken record, but they did say that you're supposed to get SCORE from doing Public Events....has anyone tried?
---
Sorry folks, I just hit my limit today or something.
---
Nice to see 76 get some developer love while I mourn the death of my other main game save the world (original fortnite) whose developers have accepted abandoning it
---
Honestly should have just functioned like the Legendary Exchange machines, you interact, select what ammo and how much, and exchange for points.  I'd rather have a new type of currency in ammo points than the convoluted mess that the Ammo Converter is right now.
---
Or Sun Kissed!
---
Though I went boring and Inspirational.
---
The challenge only goes up 1 for each time you harvest wood, not the amount of wood harvested.
---
I play once a week brotato. If that.  Guess what though?  You don’t have to get every box.   It’s not going to end your life if you don’t.
---
Not in the Energy Ammo section (where it is for selling it to the machine). I also checked every other category several times to be sure
---
Fortunately literally all I wanted was the ammo maker
---
Just a tip, hold the button that you'd use to go back on a terminal, and it'll exit you from the terminal
---
Ammo converter is a total POS though
---
Lol ain't that the truth
---
Why they didn’t just make scrapping ammo possible at the tinker bench boggles my mind. NV showed the possibilities of ammo customization. The tinker bench has a usable interface. Inventing a new appliance? Not sure I’ll ever understand why they didn’t just build on what was already there. And yet, strangely, I still want one of these UI disaster zones.
---
I prefer marine armor, but I have a tank-built Junkie's Unarmed full-health build. Between mutations and perks I easily hit the soft-cap on DR/ER with Buttressed Marine without legendary effects, but Marine armor also has that sweet 90 rad resist. When I compare that to a Scout/Heavy Combat set, I'd get more DR/ER, sure, but I'm already soft-capped, it's mostly meaningless. But I'd have zero RR. So Marine is easily king for me.
---
Then of course SS armor came out and surpasses everything else but such a large margin that even my stealth rifleman with ZERO defensive perks OR mutations (no scaly skin) is soft-capped. SS Armor has more DR/ER BASE than HCombat/Scout does with BoS/Polymer, AND has RR. Add in the armor upgrades, and it's laughable.
---
I'm not even sure why they did that, since most of the new weapons are effectively sidegrades- the gauntlet isn't an upgrade, the gauss minigun is... sort of an upgrade, but not really (worse range and much more expensive ammo than the classic 50cal), the gauss pistol is "good", but pistols are problematic already (and I think it's stuck with 120 range?), and the gauss Shotgun is pretty good, has VATS issues (if they fix that it'll be pretty damn good, but again, rare ammo)
---
Why make the new armor SOOOOO much better than everything else?  The T-65 power armor isn't even an upgrade since PA is already capping on effective DR/ER anyway. The only reason to get it is status.
---
uhh am i missing something with your math...223750/10 weeks = 22375 - 21500 = 875, not 8750.
---
i got 10k xp logging on and looking around for 30 min....
---
Sorry i didn't know it was for the challenge.
---
There's a repeatable for getting xp so in theory you don't have to do anything except play a lot
---
Settle down, Karen.
---
Yea I feel you. I mostly just want the chicken coop and firefly lamps, but they're buried super deep in the season, so I'm not sure if it'll work out for me either.
---
One thing I was considering is that when I'm happy with the game I typically will sub for a month or two. So this time I might use the $20 sub cash to buy ranks instead, if I'm close enough to the ranks I need when the season is almost over. It's not such a bad trade-off if you're a person who's already willing to subscribe.
---
When I saw this update was coming, I cancelled my fallout 1st.
---
I would lol if i saw you at my camp in hazmat
---
next patch, supposedly. but why would you want a good thing patched...?
---
The NW award is 250 points, and there are around 10-15,000 (very rough estimate not in front of the game) other points available over the course of the week. I think we will be ok skipping those. 
---
Out of curiosity: How hard is it to find a Stimpack in NW?
---
Edit: Looks like actually over 20,000 other points available
---
I did the gather supply one, it was registered after 30 minutes or so.
---
I'll have to look into this.    Thanks for the info.    I'm trying to play the game honestly.    No meds except for rads and stims, no mutations.   Rifleman build, no PA... Except when absolutely necessary.    So, if you ever see me on the map, stop by.    All the meds i collect i sell...cheap
---
Who tf plays fo76??
---
Thats why I dump what I dont use
---
it's just the same as the windmill generator though.
---
Someone probably wanted to add that spinning thing to make it resemble a roulette, and play into that gambling aesthetic that encourages use just like the sounds of the scrip machine.
---
I don’t even know what that does honestly
---
That's where your wrong bucko I'm a dev myself. And I know all about bosses asking to make stuff go quicker than it should be done. But I also know the value of giving consumers what they want. We have been asking for MANY things since the start and instead they shove horrible monetization methods down our throat. If your okay to lowering your standards in what should be a triple A game then go ahead, it's people like you that lets Fallout 76 become a joke because they get away with it.
---
No they are there.  Have fun turning them in 6 at a time though
---
Goodbye atoms. Goodbye freedom of choice. Hello same challenges we always did but with less reward
---
It actually adds 4 points of strength altogether. Just found out.
---
Are you sure about that? It's been mentioned a couple of times it's despawning corpses or meat piles, and the stuff I find seems to match the loot enemies in the area would spawn (also in sync with nuke zone vs. no nuke zone).
---
Oh geez! Haven’t gotten that yet. Looks terrible. Should just be the same thing as the legendary grinder right? Just toss in whatever ammo from left to right and when you leave it makes ammo points?
---
If I could upvote relative to the amount that I laughed from this comment, you would've earned about 6 updoots from me
---
10k isn’t too much but 100k is and that is just one season ranks worth.
---
I just make a new toon and run to the wayvard. Lvl up in 5 minutes
---
I’m online if you are
---
After thinking hard on this, I'm not sure this is true in fo76. The vendor bots specifically state human flesh cannot be used for trade, but you can sell iguana bits to them. This implies they are not people.
---
I will now stop eating iguana bits for completely unrelated reasons.
---
Are you PS4?
---
Same. It’s not fixed as claimed.
---
Except the windmill doesn’t go in water &amp; now spins entirely if you saw where my water wheel is you’d understand what I mean mines half underwater
---
Holy scrap! What a piece of shit.
---
Why fix the only thing that feels right in the game these days? Leave my shotguns alone.
---
Yes you need 875 extra score per week over 10 weeks that is 8750. You have to gain 90,000 per week to meet that goal.
---
Like they couldn't have made the change apply only to those with pacifist on? Seriously, there's an option in game already that pretty much says "check me if you don't want to PvP", why not extend that to being auto dragged into fights by your team and leave it so the players that DO want to be able to have proper team fights can. Make pacifist the default option for all players so they have to uncheck it if you're worried ignorant players will get trapped.
---
There's a way to do this that could make everyone happy. Bethesda is just incompetent at designing a multiplayer game and the PvE crowd could not care any less about PvP players.
---
We all know that? I didn’t know that. I thought 400dmg outside vats was a lot...
---
Alpine River cabins - search around, follow the power lines to a tree and terminal
---
it not on glare is in doors under lights
---
In it's current state it's completely unusable, I'm really disappointed with it.
---
not at home right now but that better not be intended. the datamine showed that you could buy fuel... maybe send them a ticket and hope for confirmation?
---
https://youtu.be/K96B4c659Hc?t=347
---
That's today's*. Wail til the daily NW challenge is survive for 60 min... I'll definitely be skipping those.
---
Dammit man.
---
Wastelanders, backpacks, player vending, and sheepsquatch quests are the best for me. Honestly wastelanders is pretty damn huge if you don’t rush it and pay attention to everything that was added including new locations, random encounters and lore.
---
Looks fantastic! I always saw "Emotes" with different icons but exactly same default animations as completely pointless. Happy to see more actually new custom emotes, an instant buy from me
---
How did this get messed up!? I read one post saying that was happening on PC, I’ll add PS4 to the list as well. Thanks for the info
---
Sorry. I meant 1 more str than my current one, maybe enclave +3str right now. I don't even remember which I wear I just know it was the most strength before. Lol.
---
Yea....made a similar post. Just when you thought Fallout 76s UI couldn't get any worse. Won't be using it and sadly was the only thing in the season that seemed a great QOL addition...
---
So the best ammo converter is still putting all your unwanted ammo types in your vending machine for a cap a bullet?
---
Untalented designers is one thing, this UI design almost sounds deliberately malicious.
---
Best to share strange in numbers as most ppl have mutations. Also inspirational is good to. That’s extra XP for the team
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
It’s a season. It is supposed to last through September. If it could be done in a day then everyone would be complaining about nothing to do. Be patient and play the game. Enjoy what’s good because we all know that there’s a lot of bad.
---
If you want all rewards you need to grind. They said about 1-2 hours per rank. I’m surprised you haven’t hit rank 2 yet, have you looked at weekly challenges? Some are pretty  easy.
---
Really I've not been playing long and I got one wouldn't have scrapped it if I knew
---
Same. Selecting the bottom row in my viewable list of items? Nightmare.
---
Shielded is 200 gold bullion. I think they’re all the same price.
---
Should be character
---
It's complete rubbish. To the point that i won't be spending camp budget on it.
---
sink was under water for me, dont have wood armor to try to add the skin to yet, but probably modding it at the workbench, and legendary perks are pushed back
---
👸
---
You aren’t forced to do anything
---
Fallout 76 is not entirely sure what it wants or wanted to be. As a result most things aren't really thought out properly or implemented completely. As a result you end up with a game that is functional yet not very deep in any single regard.
---
I'm so disappointed.  Fucking timegate76 these days.  I thought XP earned and challenges would go towards it.  Not time gating it like everything else.  On top of that the rewards are meh at best. Oh and now we basically have to buy atoms now.
---
But does this break their blueprints or just stop new griefers?
---
Crazy solution here. Let us sell ammo to the NPC vendors.
---
I am.
---
Thanks for the info. I've got around 2,500 pounds of Missiles and mini nukes that I might as well trash. The conversion rate isn't that great but there is certainly no actual market to sell them for more than that. Was going to be really sad if the explosive types were not eligible.
---
Oh ffs. I can just vendor hop and buy them for 1 cap each.
---
Thanks, Viktor.   I appreciate it alot.   Feeling wiped out.
---
He sucks your ammo and making other one (really its just about conversion rates, they are not great)
---
Is wastelanders free? I got off this game cause Bethesda kept fucking up on there promises. I do rember sheepsquatch and the scout quests so I guess those were after the brew quests. It's just been so long for me. Did they extend the camp build budget? That always pissed me off. Do updates still get alot of bugs?
---
You got it backwards, they do the correct amount outside of vats. And in vats, like all shotguns, they do many times the intended damage.
---
This shit is worse than early fallout 4 mods
---
Sounds like someone is upset they can’t grief people as much as before. Get bent
---
AAA refers to a developer’s size, resources, and funding, not quality my dude.
---
Bethesda is definitely a AAA developer
---
Bulion wont work until the final mission on the new quest line.so you cant grind bullion until you finish that quest
---
I did read them but according to the FAQ you're supposed to get SCORE from completing events.
---
This is what I thought.
---
Could it be because adrenaline is broken?
---
Yes it’s free. 
---
Camp budget ha been optimized but not increased if that makes sense. 
---
Many bugs addressed. Many new bugs surfaced. Overall I find it to play a lot better.
---
The rewards seemed to trigger at 3/5 completion for me on collect building supplies and build up a camp. 
---
I noticed the score increased prematurely while progressing then nothing at 5/5.
---
Didn’t think of that, could be.
---
It looks pretty cool
---
Click go to main menu then exit the terminal, that worked for me
---
Easy reply from someone who only knows single player, with the lack of end game some of us like pvp. If you get griefed its because youdeserve it ;))
---
I'll just continue giving away ammo free or cheap like I have been.
---
He does
---
That's a good bug though, it lets you scrap ammo of the same type quicker. Just use ESC and reenter for other ammo.
---
Stealth suit is still better, but the carry weight, better sell prices, the +30% xp and the incredible AP bar worths the small penalty in stealth.
---
You also shouldn't wait for a bloodied handmade, it's rarely sold. Just buy whatever bloodied automatics you get, they go for sub 1k and at least you can use up all the ammo you find.
---
I submitted a ticked. Hopefully they’ll get back with me on it and it was just an oversight on their part -.-
---
I hit rank 6 since 2:30 EST (4:00 now).. so I think it’s fine, but will need to see since I did many of the weeklies
---
The funny thing is that the flavour text of the terminal specifically mentions flamer fuel.
---
Ward, ward never changes
---
ah yes got it, still even 90k is not as much as it seems, thats like gaining 1 lvl a week at 250+
---
Emoting can freeze you in place stuck in the emote animation until the game decides to let you move again
---
ah ok, thx. Not sure if they're all the same since the first one only costs 50 .. so i guess it ramps up like 50, 100, 150 and shielded 200 .. 
---
But you already helped me here, thx :)
---
That was definitely my favorite location in Wastelanders.
---
Personally, wearing 4 Unyielding and 1 Chameleon is working beyond well. I use sneak 3, escape artist, 1 armor piece with sneak, and a fixer. Stealth suit is good, but probably not 35 Agility good.
---
You just need to buy underarmour and shielded plans, no need to buy the other upgrades
---
It mentions trading it in (along with .38 and .44) which you can under Energy Ammo. You just can’t make it
---
I play PoE and I still hate PoE
---
Never going to happen. PvE crowd is ecstatic that PvP is slowly dying and refuses to listen to any suggestion that would give both groups exactly what they want. I made a post before the patch hit talking about how this would happen and offered my suggestions to help PvE players avoid being griefed without fucking over the PvP community and the majority of comments immediately shut down the idea without an ounce of debate or reasoning.
---
True, that's an option of course. Personally, I would've preferred if we could keep on grinding instead of running into these daily limits. I get why they do it, but it just feels stupid. The only other mmorpg I've had a lot of experience with is Runescape and there you could just keep on grinding as long as you wanted. It was tedious and mind numbing after a couple of hours but you'd be rewarded by that. Now I'm being locked out of stuff (I'd almost say punished) just because I have a life outside of my playstation.
---
The system won’t be active until the next patch. It’s been delayed.
---
sneak is a very complex mechanic. invisibility is just one aspect of it. but generally speaking, a x4 unyielding x1 chameleon set with one "harder to detect while sneaking" piece should perform about the same as the CSS, with the added bonuses of armor mods, sentinel/cavalier, AP regen, etc.
---
still, there's nothing that comes close to the CSS when it comes to invisibility alone, not even a full chameleon set. except stealth boys, of course.
---
its a pretty decoration i guess
---
the fact that we have to do this says more about the game than it does about us
---
I couldn't see the rest in the list for sale other than shielded (whether whats available is linked to what you have already learned from enclave plans I dunno, as thats all I have unlocked to shielded) but shielded was only 200 and a bargain, considering it gives 4-2-4 for str per and end respectively.
---
I mean it basically is awarded through general gameplay. The challenges they've released today are all pretty easy things you would likely do while playing anyway. 
---
It seems like your expectation was that we could keep grinding SCORE as much as we want. But that was never in the cards. We were told that it would still be a challenge system involving dailies and weeklies, and that the requirements would simply be tweaked to be less asinine (which seems to be the case).
---
In the end it's still a timegated enterprise but I think that was also clear from the start. &gt;.&lt;
---
Oh maybe. I only looked at and bought shielded.
---
They could literally just copy paste the gold bullion system and replace gold with ammo points, interact with the machine to pull up the trading interface, "sell" ammo like treasury notes for ammopoints, buy ammo for ammopoints, but no ,they had to do some sorta lame interface that you'd expect from a first-year fallout 3 weather mod.
---
Looks like you can buy shielded straight away and it costs 200. By rank: 50, 100, 150 and 200.
---
for me its same.. disappointed as well... loged in a and then realize its not xp wise just same score .. so maybe i will check when same new content will be there.. seasons are absollutly meh
---
Nope nothing
---
Ah okay that makes sense, it’s the same with the wendigo colossus event right?
---
Ah that works? great.. i guess i have to check again, because i have only seen the first lining and not the shielded one :) ty
---
Nice outfit 😍
---
This came out today
---
Try adding an upper floor, then new stairs going down, then a new foundation. Scrap starting from the original foundation, then the old stairs and so forth. This might work.
---
I will look into that, thank you.
---
Literally could just have a scrapping option on ammo but y'know.
---
Ah, oh then. Very intuitive.
---
Thank you! Yes, we confirmed this internally as well. It seems Weekly Challenges are giving the right amount of S.C.O.R.E., just a little too soon, exactly as you described. 
---
We're discussing a fix for a future update!
---
I got a random 75 for the Building CAMP instead of the 1000.
---
Let’s put it this way. Judging by the rewards so far, it would be a great time to grind out 14,000 NW XP.
---
please keep us posted. the only thing I wanted from this seasons shenanigans was the ammo converter for fuel...
---
NP man. hope you get some rest.
---
The correct sum is 223,750 score. I just double checked in excel.
---
BuT 1t's Fr3E!!!!
---
St0p C0mPLa1n1ng!!!
---
Thank you for helping but maybe one day I’ll hear someone :)
---
They are bugged as hell. Rubberbanding has been there for months, and the vats damage bug since wastelanders.
---
I’m out of the loop on these “magic” weapons. Could you enlighten me?
---
If it works the same as previous underarmors you need to buy each one at a time working your way up to shielded, hope not though, I'm not grinding in this game any more.
---
I have to admit, I don't like the new challenge setup at all.
---
I never did challenges on purpose to get atoms. I just played the game as I wanted.
---
I don't mind the atoms going away, but I just see this as forcing me to play the game to specifically do things, instead of what I want. As such, it's not really a feature for me. 
---
I guess we'll see how it plays out, but my initial opinion is - meh.
---
Do not play NW before doing weeklies and dailes. Playing NW before the other chalenges and make them autocompleted without reward.
---
Most MMOs I've played use timegating devices. :(  It's super common now. 
---
MMORPG was a breakthrough genre that changed so much about how we experience games. But now the games are mostly used to milk players of money and time. It's a real shame. Publishers and suits got extremely greedy over the last 10 years and that isn't likely to end any time soon.
---
R.I.P. my Xbox
---
They'd have to admit that Obsidian did something better than they did. oh no no no.
---
It'd probably be a little easier to track this bug if we could see how many SCORE points we had total and how many SCORE points each previously earned rank was. 
---
Did pretty much all the weeklies and dailies already except for the group, legendary enemies and the Nuclear Winter stuff, but am at Rank 6 with 500 SCORE points in (and the last two/three weekly challenges I did didn't give me any notifications nor SCORE points like others have mentioned). No idea if I'm at par or if I didn't get credited.
---
Does anyone have a list of per-rank SCORE points to level? I just know Rank 6 to 7 requires 1125 SCORE points to level.
---
"please summarize the last year of patches and progress the game made. I can't be bothered to spend a few minutes reading the patch notes myself."  Did I summarize it for you :)
---
Don't even have camp space to build it so why even bother
---
Can you rename items you place in the vendor.wonderd havent tried.would suck to buy something that isnt what it is.idk sucks regardless
---
That's two years after release tho
---
Gives me the rest of the season to hopefully scrap at least one ammo type.
---
Hi, sorry you're having trouble! What platform is this happening on?

Copy   any chance you are on bluetooth?

---
 &gt; Ok, thanks for the added info, we'll look into this.
---
It would probably be fixed if they just added the ability to exchange larger amounts at once. For instance, when you select .38 rounds, you then have one more choice of 18, 180, or 1800. It would still be clunky, but it'd allow someone to purge themselves of bulk amounts at once and not have to touch it that often.
---
So is drinking piss if you are in a desert. But it's still piss.
---
I really want a BOS bundle
---
I had the same issue for the Building up a Workshop or C.A.M.P. :(
---
Not on my computer
---
If you ever happened to get FO1st it looks sick with the ranger helmet, particularly the desert ranger skin.

This is an uphill battle you're not going to win. This community actively hates PvP so much that you can make suggestions that give them exactly what they want but if it doesn't also fuck over the PvP community it's not good enough. The PvE community does not want to see the game improve for everyone, they only care that PvP is removed and PvE be the sole focus.
---
Jesus fuck the design of this thing is awful...
---
Its entirely grindy and its gonna become a chore incredibly fast. I dont understand why they want to cap it just so we have to log on every day to complete it.  
---
Its not that its extremely difficult to rank up but more like you're restricted in how you can rank up. 
---
It added to the grind of the game when I was really looking to have fun with something not so grindy to keep me going.
---
What about in game though? ;)
---
Well if you need a nuke group or some extra guns or anything let me know!
---
I knew this thing sounded too good to be true.
---
I'm already max rank and have all the rewards, why are you so slow? 
---
/s
---
What's the rush??
---
I’m lvl 95 it’s not really that hard to lvl up just go encrypted and queen a few times
---
Do the challenges
---
Kind of a moot point now, damn thing stopped working.

Still chirping. Can’t see any ultralight mods at 79. Pretty annoyed with that, how hard can it be? The chest already has it and they’ve remembered loads of other mods.
---
Yeah the convertor is nice untill  it becomes a daily challenge to convert ammo... Ah well at least we have it.
---
Just spam delete A LOT and from different sides. I managed to delete it after like 10 minutes of errors.
---
Maybe take the time to understand someone's post before replying.
---
He's a doctor, he probably doesn't have as much time to play as you do XD
---
ok  that was my last guess.  I gave up on Bluetooth as I was having similar issues.
---
I really tried to qualify this with "interactive UI menu."  But what I meant is anything along the lines of the store/trade/Pip-Boy UI system.
---
They've touched up the map screen numerous times since release.  But as far as that other interface goes, they are hands off.
---
and the only ammo that I use isn't there, Jesus Christ
---
Terminals are also really snappy in OWs lol
---
That's what i thought at a first glance because i have only seen the first lining. Will check again later, it might be that i have just overlooked it.
---
Same for me. He was at his desk to give me the quest but then I came back to turn it in and the bastard was sleeping.
---
I don't even bother with hacking anymore. Terminals are so sluggish and sometimes when I get locked out and try to log back into the terminal I get logged out of the game world.
---
Yeah I hear ya, I stopped doing that and lockpicking. Hacking because of the various issues that occur with entering the terminal, but both because I got tired of messing with the cards, because the UI is just that annoying to deal with.
---
I know, I know, I was just fooling around.
---
Here is another one:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/hiutg6/seasons\_day\_1\_bug\_gold\_star\_complete\_a\_daily/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/comments/hiutg6/seasons_day_1_bug_gold_star_complete_a_daily/)
---
Aaaannnnnd for Patch 20. The Legendary Run doesn't all display but it's the best I can do for now.
---
[https://app.box.com/s/c9uwjqggop0w78wve3tok3bti0pmyz2a](https://app.box.com/s/c9uwjqggop0w78wve3tok3bti0pmyz2a)
---
That-- that's a lot of ammo lol
---
Ive done a couple but honestly didn't even pay attention to my rewards... I'll have to go do some more and see what I get
---
they knew that we would work and login for that, and just as Bethesda always does, difficult our lives NICE
---
Yeah same here. The patch said hes supposed to be at his desk but hes definitely not.
---
When it first came out it would clip into the ground most of the time making it hard to pick the items in it up
---
same, wreath and presents item
---
Don't you mean Guns and Bullets 7 with a reflex sight?
---
I liked the public team. was easy to set up and pretty quickly ended up with +4 INT. Earned a few caps when they finished Quests. Plus when we did One Silent Night, I was able to collect loot from legendaries that my teammates had tagged. 
---
Points gathered quickly, I played trying to get them, but mostly doing things I usually do... Events, looting and scrapping. I did a couple silly things that were very quick to get some points, like crafted a dozen outfits and then scrapped them, or went to the Order of Mysteries house to kill some scorched quickly.
---
Not going to end my life, but also very little reason to time gate the xp and public event portion of the SCORE level process. 
---
Bethesda already said that daily/weekly challenge would be the most substantial way to level up SCORE.  Could have easily mirrored the settler/raider rep grind.  Bulk of the rep is gained through dailies, but you can also choose to endlessly grind the random event spawns helping raiders/settlers throughout the world if you want to progress through a little faster.
---
Also, "getting every box" is basically one of the very few things left to do in game after completing the main questlines.
---
Lol your one to talk I mention 3 things and ppl focus on the smallest one
---
That’s been happening. Just holster your weapon and it unfreezes you
---
That spinny bit is an empty casing feeder for feeding empty ammo casings into the machine for reloading.
---
Not that that really matters, just thought someone might want to know.
---
Yeah but he’s an EVIL doctor, so.... :)
---
Thanks. I think I'm just gonna skip NW challenges as I did before...
---
Happened to me as well.
---
That’s sweet. I think I missed a couple rewards last Xmas
---
man, can't wait to use my daily/weekly atoms to get that rifle skin. 
---
oh wait...... cash only.
---
Well, I guess we know where the BOS are going to set up shop.
---
I've done the build in workshop, building supplies and robot and got no score on any.
---
yea, the stats are great :) even if i had to pay through all the 4 stages, it's still a good deal :)
---
I thought they said you would. I've done 3 events an not seen any score rewarded.
---
I hate picking locks now. Used to find it fun but after the first 20,000 you get kind of tired of it. Then the guessing of the password. The whole thing is tedious. I just use console commands to unlock... wish we could do that in this game
---
noticed this too and didnt realize it wasnt intentional. that suxx haha
---
I’m guessing that because of all of the alcohol you have you either have way too many presents or you store it to revive with quack doctor
---
Thanks!! My buddy invited me to his server so I'll probably spend some hours on there getting a refresher. Last time I remember being a lvl. 220 or something like that. Is it still grindy?
---
Ah, I guess I have seen it.
---
Sounds like it'll be easier to keep leaving unwanted ammo at whitespring and making the ammo i need.
---
Anything for FO1st?
---
i have about 100k ammo to stick in this thing, at this rate its going to take a week stuck in front of this thing
---
I forgot but it’s honestly like a 10 minute grind not bad at all early on
---
Anyone know if they added stuff to the  1st subscription this month?
---
This one is on our radar and we're hoping to get it fixed ASAP.
---
Eh can watch a movie while i do my ammo. Im just happy to finally have it
---
I completed the “Kill Robots” weekly challenge and got nothing. Then, just now, did the the “Gathering Building Supplies” weekly and still nothing. 
---
I did one Daily Challenge between the two weekly challenges and it it was awarded correctly.
---
No ultracite ammo either.  Unless i'm missing something.
---
Yep... I just noticed it now, as its my standard greeting for the last few months.  Gone... NADA... Zilch... Zip!... not in the shop either.  I can't remember if I actually paid atoms for it, or not... and i KNOW I didnt have the tricentennial edition.  But it's gone... And im not impressed.  Prior to that, months ago, I had the Communist Salute emote.  It too just upped and disappeared.
---
Have you got the number of robots you need to get the points ?
---
at least you can spend and trade your ammo I cannot couse mine isn't in the list, nice
---
If this is correct then I'm not going to launch any nukes on public servers, had last few SBQ stolen by Magic Douchebags.
---
You start at level 1 which is zero score needed. Check again. Level 2 is 1000, level 3 is 1025, level 4 is 1050, etc. My guess is you dragged down 1 space too far or started at 0 instead of 1.
---
AMEN. I put my fov as high as I can and still read the pip-boy. At least if you press v it brings it a tad bit closer (when pip boy is being used)
---
I don’t mind the mechanics (not great, but bearable), but the user interface is f’ing horrendous! That alone pretty much is going to stop me using it as it’s so convoluted and un-informative.
---
thats the word around the subreddit..
---
Ain't that the truth. Unfortunately.
---
I never really had an issue with it in this game though. I mean, most of the Atom Shop stuff was meh anyway, don't really need scrip because I don't want to rely on getting random stuff from Mmurghl and the Gold Bullion stuff seems so astronomically expensive that I'm not even gonna try. But now it feels like there's so much stuff just outta reach that it hurts a little if I can't get it. Ah well, I'll live. Again, you're awesome for sorting this stuff out and sharing it with us. The game might have it's flaws but this community is awesome.
---
That's awfully optimistic of you. I figure they'll add it once they add better armor pieces that make the SS armor obsolete.
---
I’m looking at score rank 5 which is showing 1100, i imagine it keeps getting steeper by +25(x-1)
---
If that’s the correct formula we will need 3475 points to go from level 99 to 100.
---
don't have my ammo on the list, useless garbage for me with a pretty useless UI
---
edit: I don't have time to sit and whach a movie and do this thing, 3 hours play time per day isn't much.
---
I'll stick with the ammo machine from raiders I think. The extra ammo I gather will still be getting donated to the blue suitcases.
---
More legendary farming really and for flux (if they didn’t dupe for it) but it’s been mostly the queen, and the event encryptid. Whitesprings is a joke now but there’s a lot more fun things to do since you’ve been gone.
---
Ah I thought it would take like an hour to rank up
---
It’s evident that nobody at Bethesda plays Fallout 76.
---
You aren’t shitting, this is hot fucking garbage!
---
All on 'public' world... Didn't get S.C.O.R.E points for killing robots or either of the building challenges - that's 3000 score points I am missing so far lol
---
Both were delayed to improve them based on player feedback. Sucks to not get them yet, but glad they are listening to the player base and adjusting.
---
all those things considered, I prefer this to the actual handmade, but i do hope they get fixed.
---
What ammo?
---
Those explosive lasers you collected back then are now worthless. Id be glad to help you dispose of them :)
---
You have to beat Dr. Zorbo to the end of “the legendary run” game board. I guess this all happens over a long time though. He seems to have a decent lead in the race.
---
yeah you can't because that system wasn't made for online or for this base game. You can make the interface similar, but even then I'd want some tweaks. Need sorting and not going back 2 menus after you craft something.
---
Only BGS can take something that simple that everybody would love and turn it into a steaming pile scortchedbeast droppings. Hate to say I'm not surprised
---
How many caps?
---
It’s apparently listed under 10mm ammo accidentally according to someone else
---
Has anyone else had the american top hat guy salute emote removed from the game?  
---
Was my main 'hello' emote before the patch, now its not in my emote wheel or in the Atomic Store.
---
All 3 of them.
---
Bethesda really crapped the bed on this one. Who wants to stand there all day doing this? NO ONE.
---
I have updated this with more math.
---
oh, okay then!
---
Do you know what happens if he wins?
---
I think I should get SCORE just for being able to find a NW match!
---
I actually enjoy the process of farming steel and lead to make bulk ammo.
---
You aren’t wrong...the lumber mill is good for getting wood fast but not as good for a multiplicity of gathering nodes 👍🏻
---
I was expecting it to work like the scrip machine, you interact with it, you pick the amount of ammo you want to sell and it's all done at once.
---
I was hoping to see a nice animation like the scrip machine with some sound or feed back, but it's just a dull computer interface that magic ammo into your pocket.
---
They've put as little effort as possible into it.
---
I’m liking it so far. I’m not liking that the adrenaline and covert ops cards aren’t working. I can live with it for now though.
---
No one cares
---
wah waaaaaaaaaaah (debbie downer trumpet)
---
Interesting video. 
---
After watching that I feel like a stealth commando build with headshots kills faster though.
---
Because its fucking clear the devs dont play their own game
---
Don’t even know what it looks like yet lol. 
---
I was just making a joke about all the rants already haha. 
---
But yeah I believe you
---
But yeah shoot me a friend request! Suzifyy. Also if you got any legacy weapons hold on to them. Like explosive lasers or gatling plasmas or gatling lasers with explosive. And any handmades with faster fire rate and vats stuff that’s what everyone is going crazy for
---
I think it's supposed to be difficult so that you don't overuse it and everything easily becomes the ammo you need and getting what should be a fairly scarce resource is suddenly completely trivial.
---
You’re a kind soul
---
Edit: no wait I meant that lol
---
This happened before on occasion, add stuff around it and server log
---
I can't see it, where exactly?
---
it's for plasma gattling, I'm not playing atm don't remember the name of it
---
My budget is full and I was hesitant to scrap anything to make room for this machine, instead I just went to a workshop and did the weekly build challenge and built my ammo machine there, very disappointed with it, I have to wonder how this made it through the design phase, did noone at bethesda stop and say that this is a BAD way to do it?
---
What
---
Ok, thanks for the added info, we'll look into this.
---
Well the season pass is time gated again thru weekly and daily challenges. Looking at the board as a 500 hour player it's pretty meh prizes imo.
---
interior walls that use less camp budget please as there should be less to them
---
I also signed on for the first time and had 2 weekly challenges already done, so i already missed out on 2,000 S.C.O.R.E
---
BUGFESTA
---
My power armor character didnt use a legendary until level 95
---
Yeah apparently you get some Christmas rewards, some Halloween rewards...
---
You can go into your pip boy and exit the event to initiate pvp. At least you used to be able to do that.
---
I believe you misunderstand. Modding is alive and well on PC albeit a little frustrating to manage in its current state, and the mods you can install are client end features and aesthetics only. They could not affect other peoples clients unless they also had the mods installed such as with text chat and that is dependent on the fact that Bethesda allows the clients to load any custom files at all.
---
Yeah exactly, for me he always got stuck inside the bed halfway and it looked hilarious.
---
I put warnings(Es ist ein falle), make it suss as hell, and a breakdown point+storage before getting to my vendors. Yet people still fall, die and come back with a vengeance for their stuff. My favorite is when they get to the last vendor. Then buy ALL of my cheap chems. But leave the 500 caps salt. Then proceed to die again. I love catching the idiots of the Waste.
---
Yeah I felt like that after wastelanders evicted me but you'll eventually feel at home somewhere else if you decide to move. I ended up finding a spot I like even more.
---
Yes, definitely. Which begs the question, why would anybody buy the lesser versions? Same with the armor mods.
---
So, we won’t receive anything if we reach those ranks before finishing Wastelanders?
---
Same but in regards to the kill robots one. Quite annoying but not entirely unexpected.
---
You know what I want for a level 100 legendary perk? Automatic lockpicking and terminal hacking. They can even require you to have the regular perks equipped per skill level - I don’t care. Just make things less of a chore.
---
Weird, i wonder why. I played for 2 hours smoothly on ps4
---
Not to mention it goes up 25 points each time.
---
So, what's 1,000 now will require 3,500 by the end, which is far more than the Dailies alone can provide (especially if you need to rank up 1.5x a day to get to 100).
---
The score increases, 50 each rank by the looks of it?
---
The player who initiated revenge in the prompt is a douche, i have people accidentally kill me in buildings around large groups of enemies and obviously its an accident. People are asshats
---
I have a lot and wanna convert to the one I use, but guess what I can't couse isn't on the list now I have a useless reward with a useless UI
---
It's the clandestine paint and I expect it will be an atomic shop "micro"-transaction. Same goes for the paint for the regular version of the armor (non power armor).
---
BoS is Back. . .
---
After trying it out came here just to find this thread :)
---
It should have been a scrap menu but for ammo which gives you ammo tokens that can be used at ammo bench or at vending machine or at the converter terminal. But no, it had to be made into this monstrosity! Its so bad it funny!
---
Well hopefully he doesn't steal the rewards because this is the only content part of the update rest ls quility of life improvements
---
This has to be a massive joke pulled by Bugthesda
---
There's a way to get all the rewards. But only people who dupped tons of scrap will get there.
---
Keep rebuilding the vertibot and kill it. Gives a lot of xp per kill and that's all that needed to keep completing the 10k xp.
---
May have to do a full reinstall
---
Did you buy the tricentennial pack? If not, it was a bug that you had this available before.
---
Yeah, I expected it to come with those clandestine weapons a while back but never saw it
---
Thanks I'm reading update notes and I gotta say there is ALOT more content.
---
You might have unmarked it on atomic shop and it does no longer appear on your emote wheel
---
Yeah, this is what happens when you try to keep things a secret while also trying to get the community involved with a failed PTS.
---
Yea by that math unless if you only play fallout and grind it’s going to be difficult to get to the max lvl
---
It's the exact same thing as a battle pass in other games. Let's stop being so semantic.
---
I tried it. Was more annoying than useful so I won't be using it.
---
why would i make this up? i’ve been playing since beta and if it hated this game i’m pretty sure i wouldn’t still be playing..
---
Before you would gain a bit more than 6k atoms over 3 months, now it’s 1.5k and other rewards with the same amount of effort.
---
It's fantastic.
---
I have updated this for not being a zero based system.
---
Did they fix the raider rep glitch?
---
There’s def a lot more to do and keep ya busy in the wasteland! Haha but cheers man lmk if ya wanna play or grind sometime! Never hurts to have more buddies to kick some ass with
---
you never had a goo'd sheepsquatch melt into the ground I guess.. it happens..
---
We need to be able to build wallpapers on the inside and outside of the walls
---
Escape works on pc luckily.
---
Which, Inspirational or Sun Kissed?
---
Inspirational is 5-15% extra XP when in a team, so long as there's at least one other person. Under Charisma.
---
Sun Kissed lets you regenerate radiation damage between 6am &amp; 6pm. Under Endurance.
---
That’s why everyone should just refund it. Give Bethesda a real incentive.
---
What was going on with stacked pungi boards?
---
Looking on a Spectrum Analyzer, its a bunch of binary. I'm still in the process of deciphering it but it might take a while. Someone might get to it before me.
---
It's probably a virtual house of cards. Add one more thing and poof
---
They were powered and empty...
---
&gt;You can dress up as a raider or trapper but the second you actual do said things you get labeled as toxic.
---
No, you're perfectly able to "be a Raider."  Through actual PvP against other players.  Not cheesy instant kill punji board traps that you materialize out of thin air.
---
Most Raiders end up dead in the Fallout universe.  The ones I encounter have no interest in that.  They just want to get their kicks harassing other players with no risk to themselves, hiding behind their duped weapons and cheatsy little exploits.
---
You want to be a Raider?  Put some skin into the game.
---
havent looked myself yet.. but there have been reports adrenaline perk is borked too..
---
hoping thats not true or some other factor is at play
---
Sun kissed, I’ve never seen it, but I also rarely look at endurance stuff
---
Yeah me too but I dont see much people using them except for me and my friends so I think they will first start with some Captain Cosmos and other stuff that sort of has similarities with the S.C.O.R.E. system. After a few weeks they will probably put it up for sale because the hype about the S.C.O.R.E. system is over.
---
People were so up in arms about this, but from the patch notes they state the regular challenges (not daily or weekly) will remain, and just now checking those out I can see a ton more were added.
---
It seems really streamlined too, they're things you can earn naturally like killing cryptids or nearly any kind of creature.
---
Honestly, I think that's how they intended it to be used. I'm guessing they figured that people weren't holding onto thousands of rounds of useless ammo and would just turn in what they picked up after short play sessions.
---
Yeah that’s an L
---
Does Bethesda not implement regression and integration testing lol.
---
You’re probably right. Hope we see it soon too.
---
It does... but not for the first level up. You have to go up another level for it to kick in, probably for the reasons you state.
---
Also, to add, in a 4 person public team,  one queen fight can nrt you over 4000 xp with normal easy to find buffs. And this is pre lunchboxes. They are giving us so many ways to level up.
---
There was another comment on here that wasn't very nice about this point, but if I can say it a bit more nicely.
---
TLDR: As I move forward in the game and have access to many different perks, armors, backpack, etc. I tend to move away from deep pocketed mods. I think a lot of veteran players are like this but maybe not.
---
Everybody's play style is different but I would encourage you to look at ultra-light because if negates some weight (not nearly same amount as deep pocketed) and provides AP. In fact, early game I like to ultra-light the chest piece and then deep pocket arms and legs, depending on my build. I might be off on the concept of Net Weight but you can check this  [Old Fallout 4 analysis of ultra-light vs deep pocketed](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/247323/whats-more-efficient-lightened-armor-or-pocketed-armor#:~:text=Within%20an%20armor%20type%2C%20Pocketed,%2C%20Arms%2C%20or%20Legs.)) (numbers don't apply because it's fallout 4 but the concept is still relevant).
---
So if I may stump for ultra-light (or something else, I even like lead lined and asbestos depending on my build):
---
1. As I level up and put more points into Strength, carry weight becomes less of an issue (add + 10 carry weight per point)
---
2. backpack + mods unlock carry weight (outside of PA) - This is a big one. The possum and tadpole mods are okay (they have negative effects), but the full lvl 50 standard backpack adds +60 carry wright with no mods. And then if you get chemist mod or grocers mod from settler/raider quest lines ---hoooo boy, those things save space.
---
3. Access to Excavator armor give me option to put it on and add 100 carry weight (and additional 100 for total +200 carry weight with calibrated shocks) for junk/scrap runs. I'm at carry weight 440 with this on. I'm encumbered, just put it on.
---
4. I do less scrap/junk runs overall as I unlock more items like ammo maker, scrap collectron, and finish building my CAMP. Also maybe I build up caps to just buy ammo instead of craft, or sell items I get while grinding at higher levels and getting higher level loot.
---
5. Any AP gained from ultra-light can be used for sprinting, and also the SS jet pack. What would you do with additional 25 AP pts? This also might help you not put as many points into agility and maybe use them on strength (see point #1)
---
6. Legendary armor has great effects such as reduced ammo, junk, weapons, food/water/chem, weight by 20% and I have those effects on almost all of my armor.
---
In fact, I can barely put my PA on anymore because suddenly I have 400lbs of gear (when the perks +backpack come off) on me and my PA only goes to 440 where as my normal carry weight is about 150-160 of 310-330 most days. To do Chinese Stealth Armor I have to move alot of stuff to stash.
---
Anyways, maybe this helped and maybe it didn't but thanks for listening children and remember what makes you SPECIAL.
---
Edit: I can't speel or grummur
---
Are legendary perks and the collosal problem gonna come out soon with this new update?
---
They should reverse some of the nerf. There is no survival anymore. It doesn’t need to get nerfed into the ground anymore.
---
Nah, game will go F2P before they learn how their own code works
---
2000 if u finish the season, theres 500 bundle at the end.
---
Between the poor conversion rates, the face that there is a cap on the amount you can convert and the garbage interface makes the whole package a hard pass. It also looks goofy AF.
---
Oh no, there goes one of my favorite perks... 😒
---
Sorry...what is "pepega"?
---
No problem!
---
!remindme 2 days
---
I read somewhere else that it's under to 10mm menu, not in game to check though.
---
YES that would be fantastic
---
Yeah, people can downvote away, but I was right, wasn't I?
---
From a practical standpoint, you're going to get the lion's share of your SCORE from the Dailies and Weeklies.  For repeatables, you get a paltry amount from leveling, and a seemingly inconsistent reward from Public Events (it hasn't been proc'ing for me at all).  So there's a definite system of diminishing daily returns here, especially since the level requirement goes up every time by 25 points.
---
No it’s not. A battle pass is a “pass” that you buy into and pay for the privilege to earn rewards. For example, fortnite has a $10 battle pass, same with COD and destiny 2. 
---
There is no “pass” here. 
---
It’s a season
---
why are/were daily and weekly challenges not regular?
---
literally me too
---
Thanks for validating on my behalf.  Also, congrats!
---
Patch 2021
---
I actually server hop now if it's the prison. I don't want to help her that bad. Ha
---
Damn I’m at work and I was excited about this feature but it sounds like a mess of a interface system sounds like  they should just hire some people from nexus I bet they could make it better if they aren’t already trying to do so
---
Before you do anything else try rebuilding your database. I do this after every major update or after downloading a new game. If that doesn't work try a full reinstall. If the problem persists or worse, spreads to other games, you may have a hard drive issue. Best course then would be to try a full initialization. If *that* doesn't work you'll have to contact Sony and/or Bethesda.
---
Ig if theyre a newish player and cant afford the crafting mats but its hard to imagine someone finishing wastelanders and that being a problem.
---
Fusion core cost is quick and easy ^^
---
np, this guy who deleted his message posted something like "pic or didn't happen".
---
The ultracite PA is a quest reward from the BOS questline, you probably got it from there but haven't noticed
---
Seems like they put more effort into that then they do most of their content =)
---
Nah I've been doing loads tonight for challenges and xp
---
So, the fact that it's free means it's that different. It's a free battle pass. It's the same thing. There are challenges that you do to up your score, and you get things. 100 levels. The only difference is the name BETH gave it and that it's free.  Stop being pedantic.
---
Power core weapons still eject core before they’re empty
---
Daily: Photograph Opportunity didn't count as a Daily for the Gold Star: Finish 5 Daily challenges, it was meant to be the 5th one for me and give me Season Points, but it's still at 4/5.
---
This is cool, I like the idea I just hope we can customize our player names over our game tags first because otherwise My name is gona be a huge title lol
---
There ya go :)
---
I don't understand the question.
---
It starts at 1,000, but it goes up 25 each rank.
---
I haven’t tried it yet but now I’m a little nervous about it, I hope in a later update they change it to where you can set the amount of ammo you want to scrap (sort of like how they ask how much of an item you want to take out/put away)
---
I am having the same issue
---
This has happened to me a few times. What works for me is to launch a different online game and let it connect to its servers. Once connected I close that game and relaunch fo76 and it works. 
---
Try this and see if you have luck.
---
This is just crazy lol
---
Same as with the armor materials mods.. Why buy anything but the buttressed one.
---
I didnt try, but probably!
---
Exactly. It’s shit.
---
Wow - thanks for the work on this. Um, yeah this is like breaking your back playing 76 to get everything. I'm not interested in getting every single reward if this is how much work it'll take.
---
Ok maybe just this server, Cheers thanks
---
I hope it wasn’t a ghoul slayers lead pipe dog treat. Three stars or nothing for pets in this household!
---
then you probably dont have an answer anyway..
---
its so fucking slow i thought id be able to toss in a ton and not have to go into a terminal and press buttons a million times
---
&gt;ultracite PA is a quest reward from the BOS questline, you probably got it from there but haven't
---
Oh, maybe so! I though I had a empty PA chassis because the weight was 0. It really bugged out when I build two PA stations and tried to attach one sets of PA each; server didn't respond and the chassis didn't show but was out of my inventory. Guess that set of PA is mine after all
---
That sucks! I use both full-time
---
Stay in a party with them
---
I assumed that Dr. Zorbo was just a manifestation of the fact that the game has to be completed in 70 days, and they'd scooch him along at that rate.
---
yeah.. that knowledge has kinda been out there for a lil bit..
---
It's correct i'm afraid.. Tested my B50 minigun and it melted Queen in 10secs like it has done for months (on private mind you).
---
Or even just all of one type together...**
---
Well youll be looking at it a lot while you spend hours breaking down ammo so Im glad you approve
---
Try uncharged shots without vats
---
that was the whole point yo..
---
You can still conquer them and have defend events but it was making me pay caps to travel to them.
---
Well you're lucky you can talk with him. He is T-posing for me, every day and I can't talk with him. Ruins the mood of doing the dailies imo.
---
So far doesn't seems like it. But the system is fucky currently, point registering is all over the place.
---
I was so confused on how to use it.
---
mate you can't bond with yourself. at least is what I think of not showing there since I got a team of 4 people and was there x4 bonus
---
If you don't want to PvP turn on pacifist and avoid Workshops/PvP events. The only asshats are the ones who complain they got killed in a game where you can easily avoid PvP completely. I've got no sympathy for anyone who gets killed through non-exploitative means.
---
Have you considered the drop button?
---
I find it hard to believe anyone sane actually tested this and said it was OK.
---
You dont like surprises?
---
&gt;Weekly challenges aren’t rewarding score points
---
Can confirm.  
---
I did the camp build up and the junk gathering and got nothing.
---
Pepperoni roll worked for me on PS4
---
The UI is the worst. So many menus. So many clicks.
---
Ribeye steaks are now +40 instead of +20
---
Sadly that was the point, they WANT you to spend money.
---
That’s why they’ve been getting shit on endlessly for over a year now, nothing but anti consumer choices.
---
I haven't logged on yet, how long does it take to earn the S.C.O.R.E. points to get it?
---
Hard pass. Take advantage of the steam summer sale and find another game that's worth it.
---
I like how everyone here keeps thinking Bethesda will do something competent any day now.
---
Aaaaany day now...
---
Oh yeah? I couldn’t find jack.
---
I noticed that...most of the time, I can't tell what I'm supposedly getting points for.
---
" PC client doesn’t start after you hit “play” "  
---
Fixed this on mine. SFE mod hasn't been updated for the new client version but the error message was suppressed for some reason.  
---
Remove *dxgi.dll* from the root Fallout 76 folder and Scan and Repair the application in Launcher.
---
Are you confused about how I phrased this? Regular, as in all the challenges not under daily or weekly. Daily and weekly have been changed to SCORE, earning you rewards as you go, including atoms.
---
I've been having this issue on PC, and changing servers did not help!;S
---
Now I don't feel bad for dropping all my ammo
---
Nice. Haven’t logged in yet but that is possibly the best thing about the latest update( with the exceptional of a select few score rewards).
---
Do XP buffs (Cranberry cobbler, cranberry juice, Nuka Cranberry, Canned Meat Stew, etc) also work with reputation increases for Crater and Foundation?
---
What if it was all just a dream?
---
Flyboy icon.
---
Remove *dxgi.dll* from the root Fallout 76 folder and Scan and Repair in the Launcher.
---
Ladydevann commented on another users post about these problems and said they would raise awareness of this to those who fix these sorts problems I suppose...
---
If you are correct, I get either 190600 or 191875 S.C.O.R.E depending on how you define 'after'. Either total ends up with just under 9 weeks using the 21,500 weekly number. 
---
I suspect if the increase drop is true then the first total is the right one - level 49 is 2200 S.C.O.R.E., so that would be a "nice" number to go from 50 on. But if the increase stop was truly "after" rank 50, that would put level 50 onwards at 2225.
---
Ahhh touche! xD
---
As someone who used to use a lot of terminal based mods for New Vegas, like cheat menus and spawning defense waves, I find using a terminal kinda nostalgic of those times.
---
That being said, it could certainly use some fixing, and the terminals in general could be faster. I honestly don't mind it being a terminal, I feel like more things should be more than a trade window, but for sure it could be done better.
---
I love when they realize you figured out how to get past their traps with the light footed perk card and log out because you got too near their vending machine at the end of their punji board hallway.
---
I'd also like to say to all the players who are new to Fo76, please don't throw punji boards all over your camp to keep npc enemies out, especially if you have it by the entrance to the building your shop is in. Some of us won't even buy from you because we get annoyed with them.
---
Do an event together. Thatd about all it takes.
---
It's not even really fixed now, just in the opposite way, I've had a couple weekly challenges give me the score at 3/5 tasks completed. Was hoping it'd give again when fully completed but sadly not
---
Wait they added another gun?
---
Getting a few extra bits of ammo is always nice, its just not being able to max out or set how much we want to sell/buy is painstakingly slow.
---
I noticed the same thing.
---
Looks like relish gives a bonus 20% with Herbivore. I'm ok with this.
---
Yes... that means it is different. 
---
They are two different ways of monetizing rewards. A battle pass is a specific form of monetization that you buy into. 
---
They both are ways to get rewards. One includes buying in, the other doesn’t. Why insist on using incorrect terminology?
---
It would.....now how long did it take them to make wastlanders again? And they have BOS, Enclave, to do and were only getting one of those two in august?
---
So you're not really converting. You're selling for yet another currency that you can only use on ammo.
---
Wish we convert it into something good lol
---
10mm is under [Ballistic Ammo - Lower Power] and Fuel is not there to buy. 
---
Fuel only appears in the [Energy Ammo] category under “Sell” option
---
Yeah I can at least talk to him. I’m sorry to hear you cannot. Definitely submitting feedback on this one.
---
Ah yes, now I've crash the game to desktop and upon logging back in the "Gain XP" challenge is back to zero.
---
"Have to"
---
Hey so keep this in perspective: events like Encryptid, Radiation rumble, scorched earth, etc. have HELLA mobs. If you sleep + get an inspirational full party, which has been super easy all day for me due to public groups, you can easily get 100k. And I mean, this is day ONE lol. Heck, you’re basically just farming Legendaries at these events and you’re leveling up the SEASONS thingy for free, almost. I think it’ll go by faster than you guys think. I did RR and Encryptid and have hit the 10k Mark more than I could count.
---
I am glad it generates power.
---
Because that's the only difference. I do call it a season. But when someone posts the phrase "battle pass" on reddit, people like you have to come in and say, "well actually...." just stop. No one cares how important you think the name is.
---
I think there pretty great people are actually showing up to events for once. But I totally agree if ur already in a team u shouldn't get notifications
---
Posiblemente fue el ultimo error que te impedia jugar si no era en idioma ingles que fue corregido en este parche, si te vuelve a ocurrir te recomendaria revisar los foros oficiales aunque en su momento tambien se comento en reddit  
---
/  
---
Possibly it was the last error that prevented you from playing if it was not in the English language, which was corrected in this patch.
---
Keep in mind some of these players may also just be using alt toons. I have and use all 5 character slots I have, they rang from less than level 10 to level 90+. So dont be fooled if you se a level 3 to 5 with a rocking camp, because he likely has a main that is way higher.
---
Yeah, I think if you bash you can use keys again, but still extremely frustrating.
---
Damn yeah but In inventory they don't cost weight in stash they do and that baby is maxed out lmao and mine never sell either ):
---
No issues for me on Xbox.
---
We just did Radiation Rumble, Project Paradise, Uranium Fever, and the meditation one.
---
Oh absolutely, definitely figured that one out too late lol learned my lesson for the future though
---
It was like they hired the guy who made the first UI for No Man's Sky.  Ugh.
---
Yeah, I'm getting holiday items for xp. But the challenges aren't listed anywhere in-game.
---
Old post i know, was just googling some stuff and came across this. I’ll buy it from you if you happen to still have it/still play this game haha
---
Under the tap energy ammunition it's called "10mm" but it's fuel they just messed up the name 😂
---
I just completed the weekly challenge to build items in your camp. Was supposed to get 1000 SCORE and got nothing. Even though each bit of that challenge is ticked off, and the main challenge itself is ticked off and moved to the bottom with the other completed challenges. I thought maybe just the visual for completing it didn't show up. But I didn't go up a level as I was expecting.
---
precisely, and the ui and conversion rates are so abysmal that its not even worth using.
---
I was able to scrap Fuel and it was under the \[Energy ammo\] section.
---
In the patch notes they mentioned that scorchbeasts won’t turn into goo anymore.
---
Username checks out XD
---
could be like a vendor like the gold bullion, easy to use but not let's difficult things
---
You can scrap, but not Buy
---
yes, its gone.
---
Love the passive aggressive call out of the regular excuses
---
It’s a critical difference lol. 
---
When someone says “battle pass” it implies you need to buy into it, which is why we get so many posts asking how much the pass costs, is the pass actually free, they are confused about the pass, etc. Call it what it is, avoid confusing people.
---
Using incorrect terminology causes more harm than good. There is no “pass”.
---
Until I tried to use it and the UI made No Man's Sky's first UI be considered good.
---
Damn it I was excited to actually play this again because of this.  It's like finding out you get to have sex but first you have to rebuild the roof, shave the cat, find El Dorado and steal a Leprechaun's hat.   I'm gonna do it but I'll bitch the entire time.
---
You don't even need to "learn/use" the plan. I bought the plan and went back to my camp and took out the underarmor I made already and it automatically upgraded to shielded. Still got the plan.
---
What about console
---
We have known the mechanics of the converter for at least a couple of weeks...
---
Are you just now realizing this?
---
It’s the two finger salute with some weird noise lol.
---
What makes someone spawn in different locations?  Like, if I moved my little camp machine, would it change the spawn point?
---
Its UI is straight garbage, youll use it once and never want to use it again. Absolute pain in the ass. Just wanted to temper your expectations
---
Should always mix it with water 50/50 if you have to recycle... Drinking pure is unhealthy 
---
And don't recycle more then once.....
---
Thanks for the list OP. I’ve had some bugs as well post-patch like not being able to tab out of the map. I have to hit Esc. 
---
Also, Ward is still broken. He is inside his bed for me and some players can’t even speak to him.
---
It is like a grind. Take.these.24.10.mm.please.take.these.10.mm.please
---
Yeah I’ve since seen a gif of it. Thanks for the reply though!
---
That’s what I thought too. Earn score from just kind of organically playing, pretty disappointed after looking at the rewards as well.
---
Maybe they are refering to the daily that you get SCORE from completing  an event
---
If you just called it seasons,  people would ask if it costs money. My main issue with people asking about cost is that they can easily Google it. But being the guy who corrects every player about the difference between battle pass and season is just lame.
---
Fallout 76 is on sale via Steam for $20 until July 9th. That's a drop in the bucket to decide if your friend likes it or not.
---
I bought the game when it came out. Didn't play it much because my laptop could hardly run it. The world was empty and dead.
---
Now that Wastelanders is out, the world is much more lively. I also bought a new laptop with my tax return.
---
Been having a blast. Taking things slow. Have barely made it beyond the borders of the forest region. Things have changed. The Overseer is an actual NPC, so the main quest is different. There's a bar right next to the Overseer's camp. Get a couple quests and can buy/sell your crap. There's Raiders and the Cult of Mothman in addition to Scorched and the usual aggressive Fallout wildlife.
---
The Nuclear Winter mode is a battle royale. And it is super fun. I have spent about as much time playing that as I have in Adventure mode. I'm not really good (getting old, lol), but its fun to play hide and seek. Was also my first Scorchbeast and Grafton Monster encounters. The game throws some really wild NPC enemies at people in the end stages of NW.
---
So, I suggest your friend to pull the trigger on it, since its only $20 right now. Quests are somewhat difficult in the beginning (I'm only level15), Nuclear Winter is fun, the world itself is absolutely gorgeous and large enough a person could do nothing but explore for many, many hours and ignore quests entirely.
---
Same, done that too, no reward
---
Same last 2 completed and nothing!!?
---
I'm not surprised. It's to difficult to add straight forward QOL features so we can enjoy playing the game more. Every addition seems to be some convoluted game play loop or grind. I'm still at work, does it have a limit like scrip and gold?
---
I'm gonna give it a shot when I get home but even this season game board thing looks like a dumb gimmick to try and get us engaged with the same old grind.
---
I'm sure I've surprised a lot of players with some of my builds, I made 2 alts just for building camps on, one of which I'm now leveling with another player. But at level 4 or so I had people stopping by the camp giving it thumbs up and hearts, and seemingly dragging their friends over to check it out. I'm sure some of them didnt realize my main was much higher either. So don't feel bad, I'm sure there have been pleanty of us fooled. Lol
---
I also just got the wreath.
---
Sorry, no. I don't chase them very often, if ever. It's a 3 floor camp, going from workbenchs to displays/instruments, etc and a bedroom/bathroom top floor. It's also a very boring, uninspired camp with a generator room outside to keep that annoying settler wanderer contained.
---
Getting a free pile of shit dropped into your lap doesn’t change the fact that it’s shit. The interface for this is backwards as hell compared to the Ammo Press in Pitt, and NV’s own ammo crafting by miles.
---
I stay away from PTS spoilers.
---
I am a vanguard build with lots of stimpaks/radaway, the chemist mod for backpack dropped my weight by 90-100 lbs easy. Can't believe I ever played without it. Also Endurance has perk Sunkissed which heals Rads for us Vanguard builds that is awesome and limits how many radaways I carry.
---
A season doesn’t imply it costs money. It implies rewards change over time. If I said “season pass”, that again... would imply a “cost”. 
---
It’s a season. Not a season pass. Not a battle pass. Not a subscription.
---
Ok, slightly underrated then lol
---
Ordnance Express &amp; Bear Arms for weight reduction. They could definitely do with a condition buff.
---
I wouldn't make a solely explosive launchers build, I use it as a side thing for my heavy gunner character. For heavily armored NPC's I definitely switch to a TSE or AAE heavy gun.
---
I play super-casually, I'm at level 78, and I'm leveling up about once a day. It looks like it takes 7880XP to level up between levels 50-100. So if I can earn a little under 10k a day normally, I would imagine more serious players can easily do 3-4 times that without even trying hard. 
---
Assuming the +25 per level stops happening at S.C.O.R.E 50 (another post, not confirmed), and we're not able to earn more weekly past the 21,500 in the original post, someone who can earn 40,000k a day would drop about a week off - appx 8 weeks to hit level 100 instead of 9
---
Ah, sorry, misread it. I haven't checked that.
---
I don't mind it working that way (or is there some shitty daily cap?) in that it gives you some currency/scrap called "Ammo Scrap" or whatever. Coz then if it worked like a normal bench, it would be easier to work with. 
---
Scrap ammo to Ammo Scrap in one section of the work bench
---
Use Ammo Scrap in a different section to make. 
---
Rather than a section of .50, section for 10mm etc.
---
Yeah it's shit.
---
Also you get STUCK if you scrap too many ammo on it. I had to backtrack by constantly pressing O button on my ps4 controller to get out of the terminal.
---
Oh, I didn't realize that's how it worked.
---
I mean I don't play console but I would recommend using the interact key. Seeing if that works.
---
That's a big Twinkie
---
It has been shown on numerous occasions that pacifist mode can be switch back off through patches and other bugs. While i agree if you get killed its part of the game and complaining is pointless. If you do an event with people and then turn and kill them as soon as its over you are an asshole. You are 100% within your rights to do it and its part of the game, but you also cant complain if people call you an asshole.
---
Just like trap bases. Totally fine to have them, but you're a dick. Your basically playing the raider lifestyle and raiders arent nice people. Its just the way the world is.
---
Aye, I can't argue with that.
---
I saw that, but no enemies, including super mutants, ghouls, mole men, etc. were turning into goo when using the bow with plasma arrows.
---
But surely you jest?
---
Mr Random Reddit Expert informed me it was going to kill of the market for ammo, and maybe even undermine the whole caps market itself. 
---
I haven't placed mine yet as I haven't even been back to my camp yet since the restart. I'm looking forward to installing my nice clean sink in my bathroom more.
---
So your whole issue is with the word "pass"? A game cant offer a free pass? Bc then it's not a pass? Dude, I'm done here.
---
Do you have herbivore? I hear that doesn't work with carry weight meats
---
 So in order to convert 1k .38 i have to go through 3 terminal menus 41  times and that's if I'm lucky and terminal menu doesn't get stuck on  black screen.  
---
After that i have to go and buy ammo  through 3 terminal menus 82 times if i want to buy 5.56 with credits from .38.  
---
You sure we cant complain about that?
---
&gt;Edit: this is from someone who buys a fuck ton of atoms
---
You are precisely why they do not give a shit. The fact that anyone keeps giving money to Bethesda despite the long and well documented history of them not giving a shit about the player is exactly why they still do not give a shit about the player. Every single penny that you give to them emboldens them to not care about the product. If they made nothing from 76 other than the initial sales, it would have showed them that if they wanted to make money then they would have to ship a quality product, but they don't. The money keeps rolling in and all it takes is one person sat in the office slapping together some lazy reskins and the money keeps rolling in. 
---
&gt;Anyone who had a hand in making this skin......should be embarrassed
---
That is you. You keep handing Bethesda money, and that is why they keep rushing out lazy cash grab content. You should be embarrassed.
---
I noticed on one of mine it gave me score points when I got to 3/5 but not when 5/5
---
Well, technically they say human flesh can't be used as **tender**, like, as money, never said any about it being sold for caps
---
2 of them are broke because Bethesda is terrible at coding.
---
Interesting.  How much power?
---
In this game, I could write an entire book on how to navigate the bugs and glitches and shitty UI lol
---
It's on sale via Steam for $20 until July 9th. Fence-sitters rejoice!
---
That right there is the real end game lol
---
You have ryzen 3600 and an auros mobo too? Saw another post saying they crashed in the character creation screen, mine crashes to a black screen, in general gameplay then I have to reset
---
I tried building walls to finish that challenge, but the system didn't register for me. I had to build 5 floor decors instead.
---
Yes. Because there isn’t a pass....
---
Why insist on calling it a pass when it isn’t? Is it that hard to call it what it is?
---
The last 2 are bugged
---
I just googled the gun and the location and had over twenty hits.
---
But you're also getting a bunch of other free stuff you would have had to spend atoms on. Seems like a pretty good deal to me, especially considering 90% of the crap in the atom shop is outfits and weapon skins I'll never use anyway; now we get that junk for free.
---
They still sell from player vendors for considerably less than what the Enclave sells them for. The serum is around 4000 caps at the Enclave and you can usually find them for 500 or less from player vendors.
---
I'm maxed and still do those 2 faction and Davenport dailies. Takes 20 mins and is worth the easy 3 notes AND 8 scrip each. The extra scrip is mainly the reason. Love chasing that scrip 😍
---
Yeah, same for me.
---
I still need one level to get it, but I don't know what people expected.. I was ready to get disappointed. I want my atoms back, that is all.
---
FYI Your math is wrong. Total score is 220,750. Level 1 is free.
---
I'm using it any it really isn't that bad since I'm not staring at my gun while playing. I only noticed the reload bug because I saw it a few weeks ago.
---
This is true poetry
---
At least it looks like they frontloaded it with good stuff. Everything I care about is in the first half. Hell, I’ve already got the #1 thing I wanted, even if it actually sucks (I’m gonna be optimistic and assume they fix it, since 80% of posts in the sub now are about how much it sucks)
---
No Ultralight limb mod plans in Vault 79.
---
Seen on a few places the Plasma gat is supposed to have 250 ammo, not 500
---
I make trap camps but not with those weak boards. Mine are like something from the movie saw. \m/
---
Oh thank God lol
---
It also isnt hard to just drop it, or to Google the price, since it's been in every post bethesda has released. But people still ask and people still dont use your resources.  If you are gonna correct everyone forever about it, seems like a full time job.
---
Same here with some of the camp score stuff
---
Checked the shop, it’s gone
---
Used to get 500, so 336 is a buff to it?
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Bought it without looking around and it just reaffirms my belief that game companies that don't understand firearms should hire a firearms expert to handle that part of the development.
---
I didn't get any reward at all for two of mine :/
---
I did all weekly and daily quests and got to rank 9. Took me roughly the same amount of time like the weeks before this one, maybe 1 h(?). Like others said starts at 1000 score needed and increases by 25 each rank.
---
edit: you might want to read this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hivznv/some\_liberally\_assumption\_based\_math\_on\_season/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hivznv/some_liberally_assumption_based_math_on_season/)
---
I was so excited to convert some 44 ammo. Why not just add the ammo scrapping function to the tinkers work bench? This seems unnecessary.
---
All battle pass systems are expansions of a challenge system. A system made to keep people engaged, not just a do one a day and then get off. 
---
Fortnite recently (and finally) got it right. 
---
Weekly challenges, daily challenges and then after you've completed your dailys, it grabs from a pool of repeatable challenges that give waaay less XP but still keep it relatively rewarding to play.
---
I was looking at this pass as a new reason to play as I've pretty much done everything else in the game, however its just another timegate grind that punishes me for wanting to play for more than an hour. Its dumb and shows they'd rather people log in once a day, than play for hours one day and not log in the next.
---
I think someone created the model hoping it would be its own weapon in the game, but then Bethesda was like "SELL IT FOR ATOMS AND PUT IT ON THE HANDMADE RIFLE!!!!"
---
I agree. Totally disappointed and hope they change it.
---
Even if it was a glitch, if we had it marked off in the shop it should be ours
---
You mean the company that made the game you liked enough to visit a subreddit dedicated to it? Don’t piss on a lot of people’s hardworking because of a few shitty parts. As unhappy as we are about aspects of their games, don’t call everyone who works to give you these games shit to sound cool.
---
Wait, how do I get the ammo converter?
---
It's awful. But yeah, looks good. Used it for a bit. Will have been the last time I use it. Return rate terrible.
---
Probably the same reason everyone has their own damn battle royal, because it is a popular mechanic right now and helps sales.
---
Same didnt get score reward for building supplies weekly c'mon bethesda
---
I agree, it's the most counterintuitive pain in the arse you can imagine. I decided to swap 1000 .44 into 5.56 and even with spamming the actions it took far, far too long and the amounts are far too small to matter due to the conversion rates. 
---
An absolute waste of time IMO, it's far easier to craft ammo, and I'll be doing that from this point on.
---
Who the hell signed off on this shit?
---
They are reaaaaally fishing for those atom purchases... There are not many players who do, or can do dailies every single day.
---
Like 4 or 5 I think
---
Hehe, congrats, you got me to chuckle. And got me wanting to play Old world blues again.
---
I think insejt one tha k you
---
That's awesome, always felt like it belonged in the generator tab
---
Petrified wood armor
---
These are all of my same recommendations. Another easy one is a power cycle, you shut down completely your ps4 and wait a few minutes then unplug, and plug it back in after ten minutes. I usually do this before dB rebuild with a large update on a game I'm currently playing.
---
You can fuck right off with that.  Don't tell me how to spend my money.  If it wasn't for people buying atoms there wouldn't be any game for anyone to play.  
---
I could stop buying atoms and cancel our subs tomorrow and it wouldn't make one ounce of difference. Im a drop in the fucking bucket for everyone like you making some principled stance against the atom shop there are 10 others opening their wallets.
---
I expect better for my money.  I buy the stuff that is good.  I'll be passing on this one.
---
Looks OK, but is completely un-usable.
---
yeah.. its borked...
---
just killed 5 low level scorched in a row.. no headshot no sneak no gunfu.. all 1 round to the torso.. well within 30 secs of each other
---
no change in damage
---
What you are experiencing is the lack of programming skill or fear of potential memory leaks and exploits. By allowing players to key in numbers, while easy to implement, would mean that they would have to do input validation. Input validation makes sure the user doesn't put in erroneous characters or put in so many numbers that it causes a memory leak or crash or dupe exploits. Note: input validation is not a hard concept. This is further limited by the old ass hodge-podge creative engine they are using. I'm sure it's possible and maybe they even tested it but it could cause too much of an issue. At this point I'd rather have a slider or a multiplier setting. Something other than what we have now.
---
I think it's for an upcoming event. I seem to remember that was datamined.
---
Any luck im still not on :(
---
Honestly they make it seem okay now because of the weekly and daily available now, wait a week and watch the chaos.
---
As far as i can tell public events reward nothing, leaving us with the repeatable 100xp for 10.000xp challenge. 
---
Have fun earning several hundred thousand xp to even catch up with the system. People will all be level 1000 by the end of this season. 
---
Also another time gate? 
---
As if scrip and bullion wasnt enough of a grind.
---
Might be time for me to retire, Bethesda doesn't learn sadly.
---
I agree. Upvoted for visibility!
---
Some are definitely awarding SCORE before they’re actually complete.
---
Yea it's kinda weird and hard to miss since it weights 0 until you drop it once
---
It’s a piece of shit. It’s just laughable at this point how much they keep failing at everything they do
---
You miss out on some of the more creative camps if you are afraid of doorways and switches. You just have to look of thing that seem suspicious.
---
The camp on my main is a garage with a shop in it, if you want to go inside, there is a pressure plate out side that briefly opens the door, if you are afraid of the plate, just use a door. Not a single trap at any of my bases. I do tend to make my vendors have their own shop entrance and or room, I however never lock doors to anything except my generator room.
---
Most camps I've been to, and I've been to a lot of them, had no malicious traps focused on players.
---
I just unlocked this and I cannot believe someone sat down and tested it. There's no way. It's one of the worst UI designs I've ever seen in my life.
---
Same here. Just finished the robot destroying too and didn't get any SCORE...
---
My first impresions:
---
This is slow af,
---
why use this If I can get 1k ammo under 15 minutes?
---
So it’s normal that it shows up that I have no bond? Because that’s all it does for me. Nothing shows up
---
Why do you think? To satisfy the bloodlust instilled by over PVP games like GTA online, CoD, Fortnite, etc.
---
shadowed, BOS, polymer, reinforced, fiberglass, standard. plus twitch/atomic shop skins
---
I just removed the ammo convertor from my base lol the amount of time and tedious clicks through the menu to convert very little ammo AND the cost to buy is a big nope and waste of time lol back to Lucky Hole Mine for me.
---
Shushhh let me get the items before they realise. I missed these events. As I went out for cigarettes from my son Fallout76 in 2019 and only came back may 2020
---

---
Yea.. Looks like it's gonna suck if you are a casual player and want rank 100.
---
I like them a lot BUT they could tone down how visible the new elements are on screen. It’s getting cluttered
---
Lvl 565, takes me an average of 3 hrs to lvl, but I can go much faster when really grinding. Granted I stay on top of all my XP and then int buffs.
---
shielded is 4 strength 4 endurance and 2 perception, with 15 DR ER and radiation resistance. It's pretty sweet.
---
It did count but you got the points at 3/5 so things are you are just getting the rewards early. When it happened to me I was hoping it would complete again at 5/5 but it did not.
---
The PC lookup failed thing is cause by mods, not Bethesda.
---
&gt;it can't be used if you are full health...
---
Wait for the fire to close in. As it starts damaging you just spam stims
---
I think there is a 2000 cap on conversion points.
---
Menu is awful and it took (too) long to get rid of some 10mm I've collected along the way. It wasn't even picked up. Would ignore the horrendous ratios, if it only worked on greater batch... at least would feel *some* usefulness.
---
I still remember a group that hydraulic-insert appliance-
---
I got on for a little while and events were alive! Super fun and can’t wait to get on again.
---
What scrap limit . Lol
---
Ok well I will keep doing it then and I hope you start using correct terminology. Today we can build a better sub. See you around.
---
Yeah I saw that. Damn it
---
bandolier is a blessing, that eventually traps you in its curse.
---
I love to see the end of auto scrap
---
Uuuuuiiii
---
Thank you for the fast info, I know where my bullion is going the next day once I'm done with the Solar set. :)
---
On the bottom left where is has the players in your party. Between each set of players there is a bond.  If you do a full event together(usually less) it's full and you get a bonus stack of whatever your goal is.
---
You never purchased it though.
---
Could always swap the doorway with a wall as well, that way nobody can pick the lock on the door.
---
Yeah, it's going to be an awful grind.
---
There is a repeatable weekly task for xp that rewards score. 10k xp for 100 score. I havent done much but the dailys yet and am past score lvl 5 already. Its not too bad 😁 stay excited
---
Lol I call next!
---
It is a legacy yep. Best bet is market or player vendors!!!
---
Ok that’s sweet
---
Ya but I’ve never had an issue since before the update
---
Items are account, consumables are character I think
---
Finally, a step in the right direction.
---
Makes me SO GLAD they actually did a good job without scrapping as a system otherwise. Could you imagine doing this for regular junk
---
It is absolutely awful. Like how could you mess something this simple up so badly
---
what exactly is in them?
---
To be 100% fair, you gotta remember that the team which worked on Fallout 3 and 4 is not the same team that is maintaining 76. I believe it is the Austin studio that is maintaining and updating it while the rest of the BGS studios are working on Starfield. If my understanding is correct, the Austin studio was working on a game that eventually got cancelled before being repurposed as an additional BGS team. Which at least in my mind explains a part of why Fallout 76 has always seemed significantly buggier than previous titles, not only is it a Multiplayer game being run in what was always designed to be a singleplayer engine, but the game is also being maintained by a team with relatively little experience using the Creation Engine. Not that any of this excuses the poor quality control and handling of the game, but it at least offers a potential explanation as to why it has been so bad.
---
it is a vault tec experiment
---
If you unplug it and someone finds your camp people can still buy from your machine.
---
What’s the ammo converter? Did they change the ammunition machine or is this something new?
---
That sounds like a bug
---
It felt like Fasnacht with everyone out in full force. It's so great.
---
everyone who bitched about this before it came out got dwnvoted to oblivion..
---
Valssek and others are on the case. This is gonna be one helluva hotfix.
---
I'm there with batteries included LOL 60 fusion cores, 90 ultra plasma cores. I DON'T EVEN USE A GAT PLASMA THAT OFTEN WHAT AM I DOING
---
You have to claim it to get it. So go find ish the quest before you claim it. You have 10 weeks.
---
Wow
---
Yeah was a good upgrade and as a bonus I sold my old enclave shielded basically instantly for 2k.
---
And you know what? We have **10 weeks** to complete it.
---
It’s not the only way to progress. You can get xp. 
---
Public events are *supposed* to give it also.
---
We won’t all be able to get rewards. That’s ok.
---
Bad trap camp, tries to hide what it is. Has the player who owns the camp trying to hide and watch you aparently hoping to add to there stash, and often tries to add traps or delete objects.
---
Good trap camp puts a wb + stash and or scrap box where you can part your droables.   
---
better traps also actualy does warn you it’s a trap.
---
100% this. 2 of my weeklies gave score for 3/5 but didn't mark off as complete until 5/5
---
Yeah the menu is good but everything else is crap
---
Hell no. Shit is like 5 fps on my Xbox.
---
Lmao, they just debuted this model ENTIRELY for MTX and fucked it up on it's first week? Definitely a Bethesda moment
---
No one: 
---
Bethesda: sorry 🤷‍♂️
---
What the hell is Steam Market? And where can I access that?
---
That's what I'm running atm.
---
Does the Underarmor have a visual bug like the Enclave one?
---
You can also bash and that’ll get out of it.
---
best idea so far lol
---
A bonus to exp gained (25%) 
---
And a random effect
---
1000 points. Currently rank 8.  Just unlocked the pip boy Paint.
---
 If you are a veteran and know where to find things you can fly through the challenges.
---
Its 2000 points at a time, not a daily cap, so you can collect 2000 points, then spend them, then collect them ect...
---
Not sure why that happens sometimes. Usually server hop will take care of it.
---
don't forget that lovely red rocket prefab!
---
If you have herbivore then its canceling meat carry weight bonus'
---
At least 34
---
That's why I said it depends on your location. If you're in the backass of nowhere, chances are nearly nonexistent someone will stumble across your camp and actually buy something.
---
I'm just bamboozle on why they didn't do it like it was in the Pitt.
---
Put ammo in, select desired ammo, press button, and done. I have 38 and 44 for days but I'll die of old age before I get rid of them this way
---
Let's not give them more things to monetize, lmao. Maybe more unlockables spread out throughout the world, though. The world itself kind of needs more stuff to explore and find now that they've taken care of it's overall emptiness.
---
What can I use instead that’s rly annoying
---
oh right, now I remember, thanks!
---
True to lore. Can't even fight that
---
That’s not bad, especially with the new event xp buffs through public teams +lunch boxes
---
So does this mean I don't have to kick myself in the rear anymore thinking this would make the raider ammo machine I'm grinding for obsolete?
---
just try chamelion with pip boy interface, its totally messed up.
---
This should’ve been its own weapon. I dont know who at Bethesda thought it was okay to make this a skin. This is stupid.
---
I forgot about Project Paradise! That's actually going to be a blast with groups like this! I might *finally* get the diffuser plan after all, and I can help heal the creatures with my shish. Hell yeah.
---
I understand that irritation at consistent bugs completely, and agree with it, I haven't played in over month due to balance and bug issues. But right now A), Bethesda isn't prioritizing 76, they're focusing on their guaranteed moneymakers, Deathloop and Starfield, only one small branch of bethesda is working on 76, and B), there is a massive distance between hopeful and stupid. I can hope that bethesda will try, and as seen with their delay of legendary perks and "A Colossal Problem", are trying, to pull their shit together with this, that's not stupid, it's a little naive maybe, but faith a general courtesy that should be extended to everyone. Being stupid would be saying this game is perfect, because it is laughably not. Being stupid, is not being able to have someone contest your view without getting sadly defensive and like a cornered dog and attempt to lash out at them, directly or indirectly.
---
I'm sad that that actual converter part is pointless... Its all done through the lame terminal. I thought you'd drop your ammo in like a stash box n let it buzz away for a bit and exchange to your preferred ammo kinda like the ammo machine spits out ammo into its container section
---
I just wanted something like  
---
AMMO IN  
---
GUNPOWDER + STEEL + LEAD OUT
---
I've got several now. Not tried them to see if the recipe is improved yet.
---
This why is I side with the brotherhood of steel.
---
It did that to me one time.  I think I server hopped and it fixed it. If I remember right, another player was in there doing the quest.
---
Don’t forget the Light and Ultra Light Lomb mods too!
---
You are awesome. Huge thank you.
---
I haven’t been getting any for that challenge as well [XB1]
---
Which two are broke? Building Supplies and Robots?
---
B50 mini gun, what are the effects? I would still like to share nukes on public but it looks like I'll need something more than my old bloodied handmade to make anything now from the queen.
---
Ho hum 🤷‍♂️
---
What can I use then do the pep rolls give I carry weight? I’m confused if not what do u use?
---
I was at the same point on this challenge when I read this and decided to try it out. Same thing happened to me as well.
---
You probably got a random 1000 points when you hit 3/5 completed
---
I have aBFFR gat plasma, that is a lot of fun. But before I took a little break from the game I'd been grinding gauss minis and the gat plas definitely got sent to the bench. So now I've got 9 pounds of dead weight in my inventory that turns into 90 pounds if I put it anywhere else.
---
I do feel somewhat bad pissing all over some of the art because the art isn't all terrible but then I think about what would happen if at my job, our QA team let something like this go out to EVERY SINGLE one of our customers and I don't feel bad anymore.  They know they are going to get shredded when stuff like this happens and it still happens quite consistently.
---
Np mate, I enjoy building in this game although I know it can be very frustrating. I try to help people fix these camp errors I've experienced myself but sometimes it's hard to describe the problem or solution as there are so many finicky little rules for the building mechanics. A lot of it is just muscle memory and automatic for me now.
---
Does anyone know if joining public teams will let them raid your locked loot at camps and workshops? Biggest reason I didn't join random invites is because people would go loot all my locked water and dispensers.
---
You might be right tbf
---
Nice story ✌🏻
---
The only reason I got it.
---
This is verifable proof they don't play test their game at all
---
That's odd. I was able to duplicate it. I'll need to get that challenge to pop up again and see if it is related to server lag or something else then. Anyone else confirm?
---
Buddy I in no way told you how to spend your money.
---
Yep. My window of experience is pretty small, and much of what’s being built is with a lot of passion and creativity. That’s a part of the game I want to personally engage next. Believe me, though I’m 3 for 3 in doorways and traps, I won’t let that dissuade me from checking out arguably some of the best content available in the game, player camps.
---
Alright thanks
---
Alot of it's crap we've had in our vendors for weeks or stashed waiting for the ammo converter. Just 38/10mm combined I'm sat on almost 30k bullets, not factoring in shotgun shells, energy ammo's n crap like that
---
Very true...
---
Except it’s completely over hyped and the recoil is hot garbage. 
---
But to each their own.
---
Thats a bug i can live with.
---
But since it favors us players i‘m sure we see it getting fixed in no time :)
---
Weekly challenges ARE rewarding score, but for some reason it's getting rewarded when you're like halfway through rather than when the challenge actually completes.  
---
I think they may have on purpose or accidentally reduced the number of tasks required per challenge (like how for dailies you now you only need to chew a single bubblegum rather than five) but the text for the challenges didn't get updated.  For example for the camp building and building supplies weeklies I got the points at 3/5 completed.
---
I hoped into my power armor 
---
Why you ask?
---
To curb stomp ghouls
---
Leave it to Bethesda to screw up an exciting new free feature that everyone was looking forward to. I bet the p2w aspect works great though, so I can buy seasons with atoms. Honestly, it seems like they are trying to sabotage their own game. If a game is a chore to play, no one will play it. What I don’t get is, making the menu so clunky, doesn’t this constant reanimation and query slow down the server? Wouldn’t it be efficient programming to have it make the query for conversion once, and be done with it. ?
---
Just managed to login whats different apart from public teams? Whats there for solo players like me?😟
---
To be fair, those resource counters weren't all exactly correct.
---
Has there ever been a double barrel shotgun skin?
---
Would you call it...fly?
---
Seriously though that Rocket Girl on the back has me sold on it. Love it.
---
I’m a melee build so I can’t relate lol
---
You can unlock xmas items?
---
I found some on a super mutant.
---
Rad x to supress herbivore, or rad shower to try and remove it would allow you to use carry weight from meat again. That or wait till they say it was a intentional thing or "we are looking into it"
---
This really annoyed me. How hard can it be? It’s been obvious for weeks that they were missing. And now we’re probably going to have to wait for about two months for them to fix it, assuming they actually do.
---
It’s in 10mm under energy , just mislabeled
---
good piece of music indeed
---
I'm trying to delete stairs connecting second-third floor, so I don't think they can be connected to a foundation. I'll try deleting walls and doorways surrounding the stair though.
---
You will get them later. Was this way to me (PS4) and my bf (pc). Another challeng, but I don't think it is important. Just continue roaming the map and doing stuff
---
Fuck sake! Haha.
---
Finally, bethesda listens to our demands for more berets!
---
I was just using this and was thinking what bullshit is this. It’s literally a pain in the ass to use because if you trade in more then one type of ammo and you go to back out, you have to back out of ALL the terminal screens you just went through before you can leave it.
---
I dont use herbivore and can use pepperoni rolls fine. I usially use rad and lager since it doesn't spoil and I use the 50 lbs to fast travel
---
That's Amazing. Great Job. The possibilities for the BOS in Appalachia are exciting.
---
Yeah, everyone on my friend list equipped it lol
---
Also, why is Ultralight on the mod group instead of the build group where it belongs - hence you can't make an ultralight secret service jet pack :(
---
Yea am noticing bugs in the challenges also daily quests not counting or are they not meant to I was looking forward to this season pass giving me something to aim for feels a bit flat.
---
Don't get me wrong I love the game the wastelanders update did wonders for it this feels a bit buggy then again I suppose it is a Bethesda game so shouldn't be surprised 🤔lol
---
why does bethesda fuck this game at almost every turn? Its just sad at this point. They lost every ounce of faith and respect they built with their earlier titles and completely shit the bed on a knock off fallout game riddled with issues. Honestly I hope ES6 and starfield fail hard so they finally ditch the shit engine and actually innovate.
---
Sounds good ill add ya!
---
Yes, apparently they reactivated the challenges from Halloween and Christmas, but it's not in the challenge window so you can' track your exp gains. Unlocked the first one from both events.
---
When you are actually properly awarded the points, it doesn't take long. I got to rank 3 in about an hour before I gave up losing a few thousand points due to bugged daily/weeklys.
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/717263456503463949/727588037390762030/unknown.png - lmao are you kidding me? The copy+pasted skins were a meme for me for a while but apparently it's true.
---
I guarantee you none of this gets fixed anytime soon.
---
Beats the pants off the wetsuit
---
The second floor needs to be connected to the first floor to edit the third floor from the second floor. If that made sense.
---
Think thats partly because when you get a free icon, it auto-equips it. 
---
I know I forget to switch back when free stuff comes along until I see my icon in a team.
---
I have updated this with what you have to do if you stop playing fo76 for a week and miss a week of challenges.
---
Fair enough, fair enough
---
Yeah I didn’t get anything for those 2
---
I suppose the chances are much lower, but risk is still involved. New players need to know that unplugging doesn't deactivate the selling portion of the machine, just the map icon. I didn't intend to offend you.
---
Even contemplating that is giving me a headache.
---
if you go in the top window you can build inside i had a small area built but it did not look to good :/ spent about 6 hours fidling nothing good
---
So with certain outfits, the Enclave Underarmor had some weird clipping issues. Even though the clothing is supposed to hide the underarmor, the Enclave was never really hidden.
---
What a piece of garbage it is. Ffs the menu is a hell to get trough. And the ammo you can get is so low. This is not worth keeping my spare ammo. Will drop all exess ammo from now on.
---
through the season pass thing at like lvl 5
---
I can't start the space limitation quest but when I scrapped Commanders station it said I failed the quest, anyone have a fix to this?
---
Relish gives +25% with strange in numbers. Brain fungus soup gives +5 int. One of the teas gives 35 ap regen (25% of ap bar regenerated in a second)
---
Thanks for reporting this! The team is looking into a fix. In the meantime enjoy the extra rewards!
---
About an hour if you grind out the weekly challanges like I did
---
Did you explicitly say that?  No.  But we both know what you were saying.
---
Daily CHALLENGES, not quests.  It's telling you to complete all of the other daily challenges and you get bonus points.
---
It was too good to be true...  
---
I can't even use it while in Power Armor...
---
Dude my bad! Did you make it to lvl 5 already? Didn’t think you would be able to progress that fast!! Haven’t had a chance to get on. Seasons. sounds like way to much of a grind. Don’t you need like like 10,000 point to make it to lvl5?
---
Or the normal assault rifle?
---
It's for the BOS quest coming next season. The data mine guys have already decoded all the messages. Do a search in this sub Reddit for the posts.
---
The +END on the Secret Service under armor linings doesn't seen to be providing any health boost.  Assuming that's a bug.
---
What should I see on the screenshot?
---
I’m glad we settled this amicably 🤝
---
Damnit.  Well I can't say I'm surprised.
---
Feltgreat!
---
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuh why? Just why? They're charging money for this shit and free mods are better quality...
---
Wow did all our complaining actually manage to get this change to happen?
---
Ward cannot be contained
---
Endurance doesn't apply any benefit to your character unless it's a hard point put into your SPECIAL. So the lining is really 4str 2per.
---
I think so too, I personally love building. Idk how long you've been playing but keep playing around with building and I'm sure you will come up with something awesome over time. There are a lot of videos on YouTube as well so keep that in mind if you want tips on building. Not to mention this community has some awesome members that might lend a hand from time to time as well.
---
Anyone be else think treating it as a crafting table would make more sense?
---
I started with my ~20,000 .38 Rounds and I guesstimate it'll take me approximately 85 minutes of standing there spamming the X button on my DS4 to convert it all to ~1500 rounds of 5.56. Conversely I could dump all 20,000 rounds in a suitcase at Whitespring Station and spend ~1500 caps on the same amount of rounds from some randos ammo CAMP in about, oh, 5 minutes, maybe.
---
It just works!
---
If you add up your score points, you probably did get the points. I actually got the points for those two challenges BEFORE fully completing them, and then when fully completing them got nothing. Double check that score point total and get back to me.
---
Well, that's one way to fix it xD
---
I didn't even know floater grenades were a thing lol
---
How do they compare to other nades?
---
My decision to play again with the update was largely dependent upon whether nw was involved in this or not. If I'm forced into that I just don't see myself getting into the idea of completing the season, which really kills my motivation to do it at all. I'm fairly ignorant on how this works, is it possible to complete the season while missing opportunities for score points like this one?
---
Yeah my Building Supplies didn't award the 1000 either. Haven't done robot one yet, gonna hold off.
---
They gotta release a hot fix or something this week. They also need to award players their SCORE for one's already completed. Somehow I doubt the latter will happen.
---
As a melee only ammo salesman, I see this as an absolute win! Keep spending your caps at my CAMP - far less hassle than converting!
---
You're right though. I'm glad I won't have to bother with it because it's stupidly convuluted. I don't know why it needs a terminal and couldn't use the far simpler crafting UI already in the game. I don't know why you can't do all of your ammo at once - there's already a maximum limit so you can't hoard the points for the future.
---
The other thing that really annoys me is how big the thing is. A normal workbench can fit on a floor tile and still have a nice walking space next to it, but because of the bit sticking out the back of the terminal and the general puffed up look of this machine it was hard to fit it in anywhere that I can normally fit my workbenches just fine.
---
You aren’t going to get it all from xp.. just like you aren’t going to get it all from daily and weekly rewards.
---
I am lvl 315, it takes several hours of events and quests and farming mobs to level up.
---
14000 xp. Lucky they stack so you get both at once. It's only like 16 wins or 160 dead on arrivals.
---
Exactly. You should be able to scrap ammo into its constituent parts, albeit less of it. Then use the mats to craft the ammo you want.
---
But i dont think it can works because there is this law of mass conservation thing going on. The weights of mats before is away more than the final product. With ammo, this is significantly more so. If it was reversed, you would gain too much weight, by scrapping ammo into the parts used to craft it. And I dont think bethesda wants to sit down and do the math with the ratios.
---
Do you need a full team for the full bond?
---
That's bitterly disappointing to hear :( I mean why go to all the effort of building the artifacts, art etc and then waste it by applying that logic to it!?!
---
Yea that’s understandable
---
THIS. Why we don't have a dial for each digit when setting prices? It even makes more sense on consoles!!
---
Try stash boxes
---
Well to be fair I hit level 5 in a couple of hours, without really trying, so it isn't looking like it'll be too hard to do them. I could have just grinded all the weekly stuff as well, but I couldn't be bothered to do them all on day 1, so ran some dailies and did some public events instead.
---
I havent played for a couple months and was kinda waiting on thos one. I'm pretty disappointed by everything I've read. Seems the team feature might be okay. 
---
I'm gonna install it when I get home but not expecting much. They are really dropping the ball. I have no desire to daily grind some BS to get atom shop rewards.
---
We just need dungeons, boss fights, hunt and gather quests. Countless things that could be added I to the game and they just miss the mark everytime they try (looking at you raids).
---
12
---
I played for about an hour earlier and disconnected 3 times. Twice within 5 min.. (xbox)
---
10,000 xp is 100 score. So in a way they are kind of. Though it would have been cooler if it was "x public events for y score"
---
junk
---
You go to a scrap bench and break it down for scrap. It's not buildable.
---
It’s so tedious to use, I have like 10000 10mm rounds I don’t use and you’re telling me I have to sit here going 24 at a time to get rid of them all?
---
It’s been several weeks since I have been able to on two characters. I kinda just gave up
---
Oh, you're fine, I was just making my point a bit more clear. It's definitely not a foolproof solution, but it doesn't require scrapping the vendors nor does it require building a cage around them like others suggest. It's more like a stopgap for when you know you'll have enough cap space before someone could chance across your camp and buy something, however long that would be being determined by your camp placement.
---
You could also just remove everything from the machines or even build a sign saying you're closed if you wanted to get creative.
---
You're not forced to do shit, just because points exist doesn't mean they're mandatory to earn or you're fucked for unlocking everything.  You apparently get points just for doing events, so just do as many events as you need to equal the level up challenge
---
Yeah i didn't notice anything with public events either but the mentioned it a bunch of times
---
I remember the only time I went  in a trapped CAMP was via fast travel and I spawn past all the traps 😅
---
I see, then I might go for it then, hopefully it doesn't get fixed too fast lol
---
Ohhhh ok. Thank you. I thought it was a buildable
---
Good thing I have, patience
---
Traded in 1800 .38 and in return got 160 .45
---
Took ages to spam to 2000 points.. wasn’t worth the effort. For the time it takes to transfer your ammo into points to the ridiculously low conversion rate, you might as well just drop the ammo and forget about it. The exchange rate is so poor and if that’s not bad enough you have to spam a fist full of bullets at a time instead of a sack full
---
300k xp for 3k score xp from 99-100 if you ran out of dailies/weeklies or if you couldnt play for a few days.
---
This whole season system wants one thing and that's selling even more atoms. 
---
Don't fall for this cheesy shit mate, this is by far the most insulting battlepass system to date.
---
Not to mention having to spam the back button to exit....
---
Uncharged outside of VATS seems to be doing almost the same amount of damage even though the damage numbers are much lower.
---
Mine worked for 4 weeks straight, just breaking yesterday. I haven’t had the chance to install the update to see if they fixed it. Patch notes don’t state they fixed the re-set either.
---
Just curious do you actively pick up 10mm?
---
Apologies in advance for this non-sequitur: How do you get the little faction badges next to your name? I'm talking on reddit NOT F76. The original poster has the Pioneer Scout badge next to his reddit ID. How do I get that?
---
Here:
---
Change ammo creation to a slider bar with multiples of 10. (While you’re at it, add a slider bar to every craftable item)
---
Every 10 ammo costs 2 lead, 4 steel, 2 gunpowder. 
---
Make ammo scrappable (NOT AUTOMATIC) in multiples of 10, yielding 1 lead, 2 steel, 1 gunpowder per 10.
---
Crappy ratio achieved and we still get what we need instead of yet another chore that takes too long for what it is.
---
Quote man!
---
That's been happening to me since I started playing a couple weeks after beta. There is one spot in particular in Beckley that did it every time when I was looking for the Mole Miner Treasure Hunters.
---
Nah, they were shit and fucked so delayed...
---
Do you if the stimpack challenge is bugged I used like 8 stums and it still says I haven’t used ones
---
heartache and woe?
---
lol.. I dunno yo.. adrenaline being borked is whats got me down most
---
I dont know you well enough to say.. but the way this update has gone so far (judging from todays threads).. Id be surprised if there was nothing to bum you out..
---
maybe youll get lucky!
---
That’s actually a great trap camp, I’d love to see more of those
---
It took on average 15 seconds do to all the menus to scrap some 10mm ammo for me before ending up at the main menu... I have 24'000 10mm rounds give or take..  
---
That's an average of 15000 seconds, scraping 24 a time, once per 15seconds..  
---
Or.. 250 Minutes.. or... four and a quarter HOURS non stop clicking to scrap all that ammo...  
---
And thats not factoring in the 2000 capacity limit on points, so also gotta make ammo as I go.. which is also slow as hell.  
---
Who in their right mind thought this was good!?
---
But my burning question heading into a work day at a job I fucking despise--Is there anything new and GOOD in the store since update??
---
Yeah I discovered this too.  It’s gonna take a while.  I also had trouble exiting out of the computer.  Had to keep pressing the back button and go through all the screens I’d previously viewed to exit.
---
Once you get rid of your initial hoard of ammo then it will be much less of a pain in the ass. Right now I'm sitting on thousands of shotgun shells but once those are gone it'll only take a minute to dump any I might bring home. 
---
Sure the thing isn't as handy and user friendly as it should be but it's certainly not the end of the fricken world everyone is making it out to be. 
---
**Bonus tip: if you hold the back button you can back completely out of the machine without having to go through each screen individually.
---
At work now, do you know if they fixed the magical effect?
---
Yeah, I was wondering what was going on there. I've had it on both of those too. Also on PC.
---
It happened to me on Xbox with Collect Building Supplies.
---
I dont mind
---
I wonder if this is probably why some people are saying they arent getting rewards.. theyre just missing it go off early?
---
Couldn't you just stock up a shitload of nuka cola and bind it to a favorites key? They would give you a refill of AP per bottle 
---
I use them so I don't have to walk while over encumbered lol
---
No idea if it would work with a jetpack tho, but same principle
---
Edit - I have no idea how I got to this one month old post lmao sorry to bother ya
---
It doesn't generate power for me? What platform are you on?
---
Yeah i just found 2 of the Floater Freezer grenades. Theyre not that great, imo.
---
Yeah this is definitely hard to explain via text lol sorry.  
---
So I have three stairs total right now; one connecting the first floor to second floor and two connecting second floor to the third floor. I'm trying to delete the second-third floor stairs and I can't. So the first-second floors are already connected to each other. Never mind, I'll try dismantling my third floor and roof if I have to 😂 So much thanks for your advise.
---
My expectations were low, and somehow they still come flying under that bar. Please change this to a vendor style or script menu
---
You go on the main fo76 page and hit the 3 dots in the top right corner, from there hit change user flair. This is on mobile.
---
be careful what you wish for..
---
Yes, it really needs an Exit option at the bottom of each menu.
---
Mine popped at 3/5 too.
---
I’m on Xbox
---
There's some great ideas in there, Fugly.  Just completed the vox syringer quest the other day for the first time.  It was pretty fun.
---
There is a large lack of repeatable content for SCORE points, unlike they said. A big MEH system.
---
+1 I think it's designed for small amounts, I agree it is not usable for large amounts.
---
The best comment on the ammo converter.  I wish I could upvote you 1000 times or wasn’t cheap and could gild your post.
---
A lot of our small, nagging issues would be taken care of if the people that worked on this game played it.  There’s no way in hell the devs play this game and would put up with this tedium.  It took the first person that touched the item to realize it was a Pita (not the kid in Vault 79).  
---
This is the same mindset that got us a fridge that is worse than perk cards or backpacks, yet still got Bethesda a P2W beating.  If anything I just want the people that did this ammo converter to LEARN from their mistake for once.
---
Yep, first I found him in a chair out in the middle of foundation, then he was spawned back in his room stood up stuck between the beds as per usual.
---
Yes, me too. It seems to be happening on all platforms. I got to rank 8, did the math and didn’t miss any points. Some are just awarding early. It’s confusing, but not nearly as broken as it could’ve been.
---
Do any perks increase the amount changed, like ammosmith?
---
This happened to me with the first one I had an issue with as I completed the weekly challenge I noticed I got no reward but after checking my total score I realised it gave me it before I had even completed the challenge.
---
Bethesda plese did a new gun, not skin https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/h7ace8/screaming_eagle_ar10_make_a_new_gun_no_need_skin/?

---
Rad ant lager = 50lbs carry weight
---
I think it's designed more to get rid of the handful crap you bring home rather than 2 years of hoarding ammo. Once those initial thousands of rounds are gone and people start using it as it was meant it won't be so bad.
---
Not sure, didn't check. I don't think I had that one as my SCORE challenge.
---
Are you planning to progress through the entire season doing zero challenges other than gaining experience?
---
you still can...
---
If anyone needs ultracite plasma cartridges for the plasma caster or whatever please buy mine . 1970 of them at 1 cap each
---
Yeah, they are challenging themselves on how to fuck up the game. More.
---
OOTL , what are public groups ?
---
Is this converter a bullion thing? Where does it come from? Apologies Ive been asleep since update and now off to friggin work for another 8-9 hours until I can get on.
---
Trying to make heads or tails of everyone's feedback thus far...
---
Poor management and no gameplay&amp;QA testers
---
we all know the issue but atleast you understand this. Why cant we sell our ammo to merchants, not individually but maybe by the hundreds or dozen depending on the type
---
This needs more attention.
---
Every build worth a crap that wasn't purely roleplay uses adrenaline.
---
Can you explain to me about these public groups im lev 126 and dont understand ive been following reddit for some time and i still cant understand how public groups are great i am ready to log on and see whats up but just curious
---
Nope. The event has been delayed
---
I have like 93 fusion cords and and whole bunch of ammo I don't use almost doesn't seem worth it..
---
oh I was thinking you could buy/trade or at least post fallout 76 items or something...
---
Ok, thanks
---
I dunno why the post was removed but I thought it was funny lol
---
Probably super dumb question, what do y'all mean by roll?
---
It can still spawn from nuke drops but the Wendigo event was pulled from update 20 prior to release.
---
It is crystal clear that whoever implemented this joke either styled themselves as a player-hating troll, or was cruelly beaten by Fallout 76 fans in an alley at a Pax convention, or both. Its pathetic.
---
But I was hoping in order to hit the max rank I wouldn’t have to devote all my gaming time for the next 7 weeks.
---
RDR2 did this balance well.
---
You could knock out their outlaw passes in a few evenings worth of play.
---
How do you mess up a weapon that is literally this old. The AR-10 is a fucking dinosaur compared to some guns now. This looks like some shitty weapon mod I would have downloaded off Nexus for New Vegas back in 2013. How is this 500 Atoms??
---
I got you. Can sell 90. Msg me
---
You can spam the machine. It needs a better UI and the 2000 point limit is stupid, but you can spam it. It stays on the selections you made until you run out of that kind of ammo or make a different one. Easiest thing is to just hold what you want to convert, spam it, spend at your limit, go back and spam it again. 
---
It won’t be as bad once we’ve all burned up our stockpiles, but yeah...this should’ve been put on the PTS.
---
I confirm I cannot... So bug it is I guess. Thanks for feedback guys.
---
I had some general when there are a lot of enemies on screen at the same time but Im not sure if thats my internet
---
Oh we both know what I was saying, good. That means I don't have to reiterate the fact that Bethesda are fraudsters who only care about making money, not delivering a quality product.
---
As does the hardware store in Clarksburg!  Right inside the door to the right on the shelf.
---
Bloodied limb damage?
---
This is sooooo awesome. Take an award for that comment
---
I'm quietly optimistic as well, I hit level 5 in a few hours, without trying very hard.
---
Hold the exit button instead of spamming it
---
You are very welcome. It was hard to find this old post. Next patch, be sure to message me. I will have something ready.
---
I`d prefer a Vietnam Era AR-15 platform instead of an AR-10 personally.
---
A bit over 5k points for first 5 levels.
---
I cant even get to the screen keeps glitching :(
---
No problem
---
Is it the full broadcast or the broken up one? I have heard the broken one in various locations on the map, but I haven't been up there yet.
---
That's bc Bethesda knows they failed, they wouldnt play a broken game, especially when they can just make broken games for money
---
I literally agree with all of you
---
I don't know what exactly I was expecting, was this even up for testing in the PTR or did they somehow pass it through sneakily? I really have no words.. only.. is this fucking 1995?
---
Nothing is tested in Bugthesda.
---
It's not fixed at all.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Lt4LjJj.png
---
After dealing with that system, I don't feel bad about dropping unused ammo. What a pain!
---
It was even worse in fo4 when you couldn't switch to the PA view at will. I like seeing more than 10% of my gun and not having heavy weapons block 40% of my screen, so I always raise my first person FOV first thing. In fo4 it just becomes a game of how far out can you go before you can't use your pip boy anymore. Sad that you need mods to make a basic game feature work properly, and even then it doesn't work properly, it's just a workaround for a broken mechanic
---
Sweet water has one in the scale, two can spawn at the pumpkin house as well.
---
Keep ‘em coming people!
---
The menus are way too fucking laggy, this should be a priority to be fixed. Stuff like this slowly burns you out.
---
Ahh makes since I been having the same issue
---
Thanks guys!
---
Yeah this. Early game when you’re scraping together enough 5.56 to fill a magazine and have only managed to scrounge up some 10mm it makes sense. Nice tempting way to hook new players.
---
[title](https://imgur.com/a/yRdBfui)
---
So the +4 Endurance literally does nothing at all?
---
It was never on the PTS because it is a SCORE reward.
---
They are monkeys or something, cause its a list pulled from a database in a black square, its literally zero work on it.
---
Watoga..
---
You're a dev of what?
---
This is the way
---
There’s usually a couple in vault tech university, or that’s where I found them
---
Man they are so bad at this.
---
What’s the ingredients idk if I have that plan learned?
---
In past months I got caught by drop traps so often I switched to a bird bones/goat legs build. Now I fast travel by jumping off mountains.
---
It certainly makes saving new players more dramatic!
---
Sucks I didn’t buy it because it didn’t do anything initially :/
---
The greenhouse domes are never coming back, are they.
---
Okay my bad, thanks for correcting.
---
Wait? Is this real? the DR numbers in the pip boy change as expected when I equip and unequip pieces that have the marauder paint applied.
---
Because you can't bond with yourself.
---
When they said 1 to 2 hours per rank i thought that meant you could do it continuously not 1 to 2 hours a day. Bethesda needs to stop with this time gating bullshit.
---
Nope.. With fast firing heavy gun like minigun, if you use one of those effects you can kill Queen in 10 seconds. No commando can pull that off. On regular mobs it doesn't matter and commando will be faster/easier to kill with, but bosses like Queen or fake sheepsquatch.. No contest.
---
Emphatically*
---
Though I suppose empathically technically works in this context I don't think it's what you meant. 
---
That said, your solution is really slick I like it.
---
Considering fo76 and fo4 are built on the same user interface and what some moders have accomplished in fo4 it's really that zenimax and bethesda dont have the talent or skill to do better. They could easily solve all of this by allowing quality of life mods that operate completely on user side, similar to world of warships/tanks, monster hunter world, mechawarrior 5, and many others. This way moders could improve the aspects that they are unable to do them selves.
---
I think it's perfectly fine as it is. I am totally happy getting 1\* and 2\* gear from 3\* high levels enemies.
---
You did well Wastelander
---
How do you manage to harvest dna from the same corpse? Every time I leave the fissure site the corpse just despawns.
---
Or where can I buy it from (plan or beer)?
---
What level does that get you up to?
---
Might as well get started on the 25+ times per week you need to complete the repeatable exp challenge then.
---
Why didn't they just add the possibility of scrapping ammo at the tinkers workbench? Would've been so much easier. Everything's there already, just need to add scrap "recipes".
---
Will Bethesda let us keep them if we unlock them now?
---
Basically join a group who want to do similar things. I’m on an event team which give bonus XP for completing events. But because of this 8+ people just showed up for a Campfire Tales. It’s like Fasnacht but for all events.
---
I thought this at first but it’s a low impact way to implement it and let’s be honest it’s powerful alongside scrounger.
---
Yeah way overrated. Gimme my handmade. My fixer is for exploring use the handmade in any real fights.
---
I disagree. If the player is not cheating/exploiting, harassing you, or verbally abusing you, they're just playing the game. Is it nice to kill another player after an event and take their junk? No. But it doesn't make you a dick for doing it either. It's just a game, and a legitimate mechanic in it.
---
Lots of games of similar mechanics where you basically screw over another player to get an edge. Their loss can be your gain. Even children's card games have mechanics like that. Either we're all teaching kids to be huge assholes all the time or it's not a big deal because it's a fucking game.
---
Bro you don’t know me I bond with myself all the time lol. OK so the meter on the other people that’s my bond with them. Makes sense
---
Does it spin tho?
---
oh boi, we're in for some nasty surprises in the future, aren't we? I know at this point that we're well past meme levels with the bugs &amp; being let down, but man.. this is starting to make me sad.
---
&gt; The ammo converter is much better than just dropping every .38, 10mm or .44 you pick up.
---
Nah, the menus are too laggy, ill continue to drop my ammo so i dont have to get back to my camp to relieve weight. Free Shit still shit.
---
Can confirm "Cop A Squatter" still works as it was completed for me today post-patch! xD
---
Yeah, I see the grind aspect of it, Understandable
---
They need to add a third team member who does nothing but plays the game like a regular person and reports to the two developers.
---
Yeah man, patience, well probably get it fixed in patch 46 in 2024.
---
Since there are 100 challenges, at an increment of 25 score points for every next challenge, the total score points to complete the season is (1000 + 1025 + 1050 ... 3500) =  226250 total score points.
---
You can earn 21500 points per week. This includes grinding out NW content.
---
226250/21500 = 10.5 weeks. This is 10.5 weeks of MAX score completion is the MINIMUM to make sure you get all 100 ranks of score.
---
Now say you ignore NW entirely, and that a NW challenge is 1/day = 7 / week. You can only earn 19750 score points per week.
---
226250/19750 = 11.5 weeks
---
Bethesda has stated that Season 1 will go from June 30 to "mid-september", that is roughly 10 weeks.
---
So if I am not mistaken, you will \_HAVE\_ to purchase some ranks using atoms in order to make it to rank 100 BEFORE the 10 weeks are up for the season, even if you do NW challenges or not. This is assuming score level ups go up for 25 points every levelup, starting at 1000 points for the first level up.
---
Sidenote: You will most likely complete the "repeatable 10K exp" for 100 score points multiple times during the 10 weeks. This can definitely bring the grind down to a point where you will not have to spend atoms to purchase score ranks. Assuming you get 10k exp / week, this would reduce the total points required by 1000, which is still pretty low.
---
I agree. I think it's pretty cool.  And this is coming from someone who thought it was stupid to include a LFG tool without group progression content.  I was wrong.
---
i did everything but the NW one an im 50 exp from lv 10
---
No buillon--- complete level 4 of the new SCORE system and it becomes buildable in your camp (Resources tab).
---
Edit: 5 each of circuitry, copper, gears, steel.
---
Probably patch 21
---
All of this can easily be answered by the biggest problem plaguing Bethesda right now: duping.
---
Awesome thx
---
Yet another time gate. Yeah Im gonna take a long break
---
Goo piles are at least easier to find than ash. Had somebody disintegrate a legendary scorchbeast after a queen fight with bodies everywhere. Trying to find a burning ash pile in the bog is damn near impossible. Screwed like 8 other players out of loot.
---
Wish it produced chicken instead of fertilizer 👀
---
Strange theory, I know: terminal is used because it is slow...let taxing on the servers?
---
Yup, I put all that ammo back in my vendors.
---
There was a post last week where people were super excited about the ammo converter. I commented something like "Just wait, it is gonna suck big time. They are not gonna give us anything even remotely useful" and got bombarded with downvotes. I hope i would not have deleted that comment after 40 or so downvotes..
---
Level 8
---
Gotta admit, it’s nice having a water source inside now!
---
I just placed it. What in the living hell were they thinking doing it like this. Let us bulk convert without having to go through a bunch of menus. I have thousands of ammo I've been saving. Itll take me hours to convert it like this.
---
Yup, NW can suck my nuts. I ain't doing it.
---
I started a silo run to rack up everything aside from the Liberators.
---
Clean sink, not clean water.
---
Shocker. They didn't manage that simple thing.
---
There’s a few around Flatwoods too, the one I got was on the house porch with 2 chairs where you get a story tape holo for a responser.... there’s also potential for one in the red rocket in Flatwoods and the funeral home.
---
I just found someone’s vendor selling literally 22 MILLION holiday gifts for 20 caps each. I can only assume this guy is cheating?
---
lmao.  
---
Yeah so by default you have a 25% bonus then as you gain more teammates and bond with them it goes up by 25% per teammate for a total of 100%.
---
If the Ammo Converter is a herald of what's to come, then I want my daily ATOMS back ASAP! I felt I was playing a game from the 90's for a moment, so they did nail the retro vibe alright..
---
DISGUSTING work Bethesda!  
---
Wonderful...
---
I see. 
---
My statement was made based on the video you linked though of killing a behemoth with multiple weapons and killing a scorchbeast. 
---
I know for a fact a bloodied stealth commando build can kill those creatures in the video faster than he was killing them with those guns. 
---
I guess I’m confused how you can kill a queen in 10 seconds with one of those guns when it took close to ten seconds to kill the behemoth a with those guns a couple of the times in the video. 
---
Do you need a specific combination on a specific gun to kill a queen as fast?
---
I haven’t been on since the update, but they have that cool service rifle skin available now
---
doesnt give you 20hp?
---
You got it mostly right, zenimax, the ones behind ESO, are the ones who made the netcodeing and multiplayer featured and ports of the fo4 creation engine. Then Austin studios did the actual development of game utilities and mechanics which was laid on the bare bone foundation of what multiplayer fo4 was meant to be. So it is a shitshow of who done what and for the most part, the game play its self ain't bad, the utilities and mechanics work 80% of the time. But the netcodeing, dysnc, lag, rubber banding and interface delay is what drives everyone insane and that's all on zenimax and there half finished netcode that "just works" for some reason even though it has no reason it should
---
They are paying out early if anything.  I got building supplies completed at 3/5 collected
---
It does not conjure water from the elemental planes.
---
&gt;sounds like you dislike pvp.
---
There are plenty of people who love PVP who did not want it in a Fallout game.  I don't know why this is so hard to understand.
---
There's people out there who love Fallout games and also love games like COD.   For years now they have enjoyed Fallout  as a single player experience where you could explore the world and play the game at your own place with no concern for what the latest meta build is for PVP.
---
That's an excellent breakdown, thank you for taking the time to communicate all of that. Seems to answer my question pretty well.
---
Funny thing.. People like different things. I will be using them at some point. Happily.
---
Public groups give bonuses. Role play groups bonus CHR, Building Groups bonus INT, Hunter groups bonus XP on legendary Kills, but the gold standard is so far Event Groups which get bonus XP for doing events. All you have to do is go into the social menu and see what groups are formed and just join.
---
Mines broken too - the quest says to report back to her and when I do she just says her stomach hurts. Never been able to advance the quest.
---
Anyone else having issues with the terminal screen not loading?
---
Would be cool if you could connect some pipes to one of your water purifiers tho lol
---
Maybe in fallout 76 2 lmao
---
The amo converter works like hiring a 7 year old to do your taxes. It might get done but sloppy . Why do I want to spin it ,then read the little screen to have bullets I want to keep changed into points which do nothing. I spent hours getting the stupid thing, and found it useless and FRUSTRATING to try to use. Did ANYONE look at this and try to work in game? It's  a waste and fore tellos the rest of this toddler board game will be the same!            FIX IT Please Lets fill our camps with useless junk.
---
Not unless you put the points into it. It's the same as unyielding armor, you don't get hp
---
Bethesda is garbage, oh how the mighty have fallen
---
It’s def broken can confirm got no extra juice for killin.
---
You can use atoms to buy ranks?
---
Good thing I only want to get to level 59.
---
I think the bigger question here is not how good or bad the ammo converter works, but why in tarnation would anyone hoard missles? You know you can make them, on demand, whenever you need them, right????????
---
Edit: I forgot to start with I one thousand percent agree with OP.
---
I know it was stupid to hope for... But it would have been really nice to just set it to convert a type and the amount, even if they kept the stupid point system. Just let me get my 2000 points in 1-2 clicks then 1-2 clicks to convert it all to whatever I want.
---
Doing a rinse and repeat on that wouldn't be so bad. It would still be stupid rather than just a straight X converts to X amount of Y... But at least I wouldn't fall asleep jacking around with that crap menu to convert to points twice.
---
I think I became a grandfather during the time it took to convert even 1000 points.
---
And I don't even have children.
---
Lucky you. I completed 5/5 and dont get a reward at all :/
---
You just got a bunch of new content for free and QOL improvements like Public Groups and somehow it’s a cash grab.
---
You got my upvote
---
People really need to get over it. You really think the thing was designed for people who have been hoarding ammo for two years? Fucking no! It was designed to dump 5he handful of bullets that you randomly pick up while looting or get in quest rewards. 
---
If you're using it as it was made to be used; small conversions of crap you picked up in the hour you were out rather than the two years you've been hoarding, it's actually a tolerable and handy little addition.
---
I'm a majority solo player, but decided to start a "casual" team. So far it's been nice. We've all shared perks to help each other out, and just did our own thing. 
---
I'm liking everything so far. Had my fingers crossed that the camp items were actually account wide, (it's BGS so who knows?), and verbally "wooted" some when I saw that they were!
---
I cannot remember how to show sarcasm on here. Sorry.
---
If I had water I wouldn't be drinking piss, would I?
---
Not yet, in the release note they say players will be able to buy ranks in two weeks for 150 atoms each.
---
ya.. its borked yo
---
Too many clicks.  I'd rather just keep dumping all my unwanted ammo in train station suitcases, if this is the alternative.
---
Yes you would have to remove walls and floors from the third floor to remove the 2/3 stair.
---
Ty.
---
I suspect they have the talent and skill, just no desire or motivation. People will buy the games anyway even if a UI like this on PC is nearly a war crime (okay maybe that's a bit too much but seriously). PC especially is usually an afterthought, or it feels that way when it comes to these games. I have no doubt most of their money comes from console so with mods being possible there is likely just little incentive to improve it.
---
I've noticed that I'm not getting rewarded from Public Events at all.
---
Sometimes I'll get a small infusion of SCORE from out-of-the-blue, but I have no idea where it comes from.  I can't tell if the Public Event SCORE is horribly lagged, or if they just plain aren't providing it like they said they would.
---
I mean yeah, the idea for any season pass is that the top tier rewards are going to be difficult to grab, it's goal is to keep people playing after all 
---
Was there any item in particular you want that is a high rank reward? Because there may be other ways around it 
---
For example, for camp items a friend can place them in your camp, and then you can move them around as if you unlocked them, even if you haven't
---
Most of the initial Legendary Perk Cards werent that great, so they delayed em to hopefully make some better ones.
---
Damn! Sorry to hear. I thought I was finished with her storyline and scrapped her terminal then it said failed space limitations, but legit it was never in my data log so wtf!
---
I don’t know if it’s just on my end but it also looks like I can’t switch characters to get those level up challenges done quicker.... the option to switch characters isn’t in the Xbox menu anymore.
---
You have to kill a enemy and then it works for 30sec I believe.
---
I haven’t played in 3 weeks because I got bored.. decided to have a go today because of the update and am already bored and underwhelmed.. there is just no content of any purpose, just boring grinding challenges.. it reminds me of some kind of mind torture experiment
---
We have to grind to get points to earn rewards which we then have to grind to make any use of!
---
c'mon, it's \*terrible\*. one of the worst UI designs i've seen for anything. why have a badly written splash screen that you'll see forever, instead of just loading up the conversion page? I don't want a zany splash, i just want to convert ammo and be done with it.
---
why force me back to the poorly done ammo selection screen which is unclear what's in each category and just delays things even more? keep me on the specific ammo type page, at least.
---
i've got a ridiculous amount of spare ammo and i've barely played a few months, never mind 2 years. in its current state it's unusable.
---
i think if this is an early indicator of the quality of seasons as a replacement for generally decent challenges for atoms, it's a fair complaint to make. gutting the atom tally and replacing it with...this...is pretty bad, especially as people are already reporting completed challenges aren't handing out score points. and based on previous experience with support, i don't hold out much hope for them handing out the points after a bug hits.
---
Noted!
---
ur a symbol citizen
---
Doesn’t increase health, but additional Endurance increases sprint efficiency (less AP used per second) and disease resistance. So not spectacular, but not nothing.
---
Noticed it with the Shielded Vault Suit (+2 Endurance) and ended up switching to the Shielded Casual (super helpful for speech checks)
---
You can also meet this challenge by bulking wood (or fertilizer or concrete, etc), and then scrapping it. Pretty quick if you’ve got First and some plastic.
---
That's why I wanted to get this out ASAP.
---
you dont get endurance at all from unyielding.
---
Ok gotcha. I can finally use all my atoms for something. Lol
---
Wait so how did you explain that this is a cash grab?
---
people are talkin about it.. youre not alone
---
Well, time to deop the 500+ 40mm rounds I gathered in anticipation for this thing, messed with one at someones camp for a couple of minutes before I realized this thing is awful lol.
---
Encrypt event
---
Also, this might sound entitled, but seriously, an icon? That's it for freebies? At least Creation Club rotated through pipboy and armour skins...
---
Where exactly is the new content? Skins for weapons/armor/powerarmor is not what i see as new "playable" content.
---
Yup. But it's not working. Have been using it forever and it seems to be broken
---
Yeah I had the same
---
And even with the ticket, you had to get lucky with the customer service representative
---
It’s very weird
---
Does Fasnact Protectron work? I haven’t played the update yet.
---
lol this game today..
---
WTF were the players on PTS doing while this was on there?
---
until i saw its going to take me a month to convert my ammo 20 at a time
---
You cant even use it with Power Armor. Your head will clip through the keyboard onto the keyboard mounting when you try to use the terminal. Worst and most user unfriendly interface I have ever seen.
---
DID NO ONE AT BETHESDA USE THAT PIECE OF CRAP EVEN ONCE? THIS SHIT IS SO FUCKIN OBVIOUS GOD DAMN. WHO THE FUCK MADE THIS AND ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE READY TO RELEASE?!
---
I wont use it at all. Trash conversion rates, need to leave my PA and then I will be tormented by that trashy interface. F*ck off.
---
And each log only counts as 1 no matter how much you actually gather.
---
everything else is fucked tho.. lol
---
I believe the toy vendor at whitesprings also sells bubblegum and gumdrops
---
This was a thing on the ptr feedback and it was ignored.
---
I don't appear to be.  I've received the odd infusion of SCORE from out of nowhere sometimes.  It's hard to tell if it's just horribly lagged, or if Public Events simply aren't providing SCORE like they were allegedly supposed to.
---
u/LadyDevann?
---
I can dream dammit! I’m am glad I have something that looks nice to add to my kitchen at least
---
The video was just a test run to demonstrate / showcase the effects by Angry Turtle. And nope, any of those effects in a weapon that has 200+ or higher rate of fire will do (or 100+ with explosive effect as explosions count as one extra hit). The bug works very strangely. Queen has 32k health and it dies like a normal enemy with normal weapon. Like it had 1000 health. Extremely fast. Also, for the effect to work, you need to hit one lbody part all the time. If you keep missing it will slow down the effect. It is super wierd.
---
Yeah, have the same bug.
---
Watoga. Dolce's. Sometimes the Glassed Cavern.
---
oh shit talk about beetlejuicing
---
Stuff that I wouldn't have spent Atoms on in the first place. I've always been super picky about things that I bought from the Atom shop, but now I just won't buy things from it at all.
---
I just think the UI for it makes me want to jump off a bridge
---
I did not try it after patch 20, but before it was working. Will check it out on Xbox.
---
Well if it's anything like the truffle shuffle, it's warbley nonsense noises. JEET JOOK JAWA
---
thanks I was looking for those numbers to post
---
events give you 300 (about, manhunt) to 2k (Sbq or so?) 
---
huh, not great numbers
---
Same here, noticed I was getting rewards at 4/5 instead of 5/5.
---
Exchange rate is pretty awesome too, I need to scrap 30k 10mm to make 1.5k of 2mm EC, so near 2000 times exchange and buy, near 5 hours of clean gameplay added, end game boyz
---
Huh. Funny how I stick high valued shits in my vendors AT THE END OF MY PUNJI’s. I guess all trap camps are shit though right?
---
Cutting the time as short as they do here is an incentive to pay for the missing levels.
---
The converter needs to be re worked to not use the computer and click each time to convert 12 ammo. And what is it with the fact that I can buy 20 ammo back for 350 points? It should be a vendor style interface allowing point per round sale and buying. 
---
I was super excited and see a lot of potential but currently this is very underwhelming. Just ground out 4 ranks to get it and I’m so disappointed.
---
takes 5 minutes just to back out of the menu
---
Sometimes that shows up for me but usually it doesn't unless I start on one character and then exit back to the main menu. Not sure if that'll work again or not, but worth a shot.
---
Oh that's sweet. Glad Bethesda listened to the community on this one.
---
But at the same time PAY2WIN! /jk
---
But the ones I hoarded were free. Lol. I usually ended up overencumbered near whitespring station from those damn uranium fever mole miners missiles. My alts just live at the station for a central location for trades when needed. So I just dump all explosive ammo in a suitcase then join back with the alt and if it's still there I grab and if it's gone well at least I'm not overencumbered anymore. 
---
I thought when wastelanders arrived that they might possibly allow us to sell ammo to npcs so I kept it just in case. Now it is time to get rid of it as it clearly does not bring me joy anymore.
---
#1 I already said that using the terminal was a bad idea. 
---
#2 my post has nothing to do with the season system or the score points or challenges so that whole argument of yours doesn't even apply. 
---
Why would you take the time to type all that out when all you're doing is agreeing with what I already said and then arguing completely unrelated things? Just a waste of both of our time.
---
I think its the game doesnt know when to provide it because when i do challenges with multiple steps ill usually get rewarded once i hit 2 or 3 out of 5 then once i complete it I receive nothing
---
You have to remember too, the score increases my 25 for each one. The first few levels are going to be easy due to the weeklies giving out 1,000 each and the score is low currently. Once your weeklies are done, you can get roughly 1 rank up a day due to the dailies, and will only get worse as the score increases from each rank
---
Dense chest for explosion protection?
---
[You rang?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hfo2ju/ammo_converter_finally_i_bloody_love_you_bethesda/fw00v4o/)
---
The downvote is based around perception not facts so obviously the more ranty and vaguely angry you sound the less people want to listen. However the points were and still are solid. Its just a shame it takes a new assfucking every patch day to get everyone on your side for ten minutes.
---
I'm glad my 2nd character only uses a mole miner gauntlet &amp; combat knife 😁 Although it can make for a challenge when I want a Scorchbeast to land, or get that Cargo Bot, or take out turrets. Those 3 things are my nemesis 😔
---
It's less than a quarter of what you could earn before the update. They need those MTX dollars, but they won't get them from me.
---
this \^
---
I don't care about conversion rate.
---
But I'd rather drop all my ammo on the ground instead of spending AN HOUR converting all bullets 15 at a time............
---
Not really interested in anything no. Just wanted to do a sort of PSA for those that would actually be interested in reaching the highest rank without using atoms since they need to know this as early as possible.
---
every time I bitched about it before it came out I got downvoted to oblivion..
---
nobody cares until something they didnt think of impacts them...
---
It’s like they think we only run around with several hundred ammo. Many people (including myself) have upwards of 20k ammo with them most of the time. This machine is just stupid.
---
Yea I've had this happen to two separate challenges now.
---
Yeah thats what the other guy said i guess i am lucky bugged
---
I guess if your paying for atoms. I have a bunch stored up and you get atoms as you go. I still don’t see how this is a cash grab?
---
Yup. I felt crushed lol
---
Great tip tyty 👍🏻
---
Or just make it a merchant you can only sell ammo to, and only trade AmmoPoints with.
---
Aye true enough, it'll take a few weeks to see how much of a ballache it's going to be at later levels.
---
What's in them?
---
Interesting. I’ll have to check my stashes first for any of these. I currently can solo the queen but it takes probably 5 minutes on average but that’s with stacking consumables. 
---
If it can be done that quick with just a weapon that will increase my productivity in a way.
---
They've already pushed 76 off into the e-team. It's 2 guys in a basement..... that occasionally gets power and running water.
---
Lol I like jawa. Reminds me of something an ewok would say.
---
Can I finally delete my clown outfit and asylum dress you kept forcing me to wear?
---
Ok you explained it exactly how i needed it thanks!
---
I don’t like the seasons either, but the math shows dailies and weeklies will get you 99% of the way there. Xp is the remaining 5k score over 10 weeks. It’s not bad. It works out to about 7k score each day, which is totally reasonable. No, you may not be able to get each reward (I know I won’t). But I also wasn’t getting every available weekly/daily atom before. 
---
And of course some people will pay, as they should. If nobody bought atoms the game wouldn’t survive.
---
Dense is not material mod, it is miscellaneous mod. Meaning you add 2 mods, one material that adds defence and one misc that adds effects like dense.
---
Ummm.... you literally can move your mouse over and look what it is...???
---
As far as I'm aware, there's no sink in the entire game that dispenses purified water. Probably because if there was, it would render camp water purifiers redundant.
---
Even the sinks in the Whitespring bunker dispense dirty water (with disease chance, lol).
---
Update - each wood PILE and each LOG only count as ONE gather instance so you have to go to 100 PILES and/or LOGS to achieve this goal. 🙁🎺
---
Yes! That is a very good question. Even 200 more would go a long way, i think... probably not, but hey, i could put extra display or two, would fill up my bedroom a bit... maybe build a small shack on the other side of the camp for small annoyances. 
---
Hey here's another idea. Give us an option to build a silent version of ally stuff, like liberty prime skin for PA, normal version of Fasnacht robot, and (I can't stress this enough) QUIET version of Fasnacht robot. I would gladly go speak to him from time to time on my own. Sing a song with him. But at this point, and im relatively new to the game, I already adapted a way, from this sub, to fling him of a cliff with a spike board. I'm actually going to try that with commander "floating in space" right now 🤔
---
If you actually own this hot garbage fire, can you confirm the 3rd person grip animation is as misaligned as this preview shot shows? 
---
Seriously, at least this bug came in the advertising if so!
---
adrenaline is borked for sure.. several people have tested it
---
I don’t get all this hate for this. 
---
It could be easier to use but you just got it for free, and ever since I started using it this evening I’ve been on a net neutral ammo level without physically having to make any, and I’ve been able to sell. 
---
There’s no limit so you can literally make as much ammo as you can fathom, and with scrounger you get more than enough to trade in. 
---
Top tip, once you have gone through a selection process, your choices are soft saved meaning you can spam enter, A, X depending on console to speed up the process. I hit 2000 like this pretty much immediately. 
---
It’s quite literally already changed how I play. Between west tek runs, scrounger and trading all my other ammo in, I’m literally swimming in 556. If you go and purposely hit areas with ammo boxes with level 3 scrounger it’s more than I could produce via the tinkers bench in a day by far.
---
Ah I just thought you were annoyed about not being able to grab something since you added the "this is insane" bit at the end
---
My bad dude, grind on haha
---
&gt; I allways think of my brother regarding stuff like this, hes a family father and gamer at heart and can play games around 3 times a week for around 2-4 hours.
---
People with responsibilities will always lag behind. I would only be able to play everyday enough to get these items if i slack off on things like mowing the lawn, or shoot, just not playing any other games i love like Dead by Daylight which also has a season (as well as a paid pass).
---
I know i’m not entitled to have everything, and I happy they put the good stuff towards the front
---
Thanks for the tip. I sure hope they keep this, especially for private servers, but for now, I might make use of it during the off hours when nobody's on to team with anyways.
---
Someone did the math and it will take 11.5 weeks of dailies and weeklies in order to get to rank 100 if you don't do the Nuclear Winter challenges. The Season is 10 weeks, so it seems like you have to do every single challenge to get to rank 100. If you miss a day, you seem to be screwed
---
Thought the same exact things, so lame 😒
---
I think you are right, not showing up here either.
---
Yup. That's a Bethesda thing. Survival mode leader boards, survival mode itself, PvP, earning free atoms (not just challenges but that BS when they replaced early game ones with items instead) agrees with you.
---
Cool. Then I can just add it to my buttressed chest piece. Great!
---
It is a 6th challenge, u can do the nw challenge instead right?
---
Does anyone know what could've caused it?
---
Yea when Queen lands she is dead almost instantly, never has a chance to jump up again. Sometimes the bug works slower, sometimes faster. I use minigun myself as it has large ammo capacity (500) so it works better. If you need to stop firing like with LMG it will stop the bugged effect and you have to start over. Minigun shreads. I have not tested myself, but many people use gatling lasers (ultra and normal) as they are fast too.
---
" I don't think it is nearly as bad as everyone's reactions suggest."
---
and i'm explaining why i think it is, in fact, as bad as everyone's reaction suggests. if you don't want people to suggest why that might be the case, why should people even reply unless to say "i agree"?
---
"my post has nothing to do with the season system or the score points or challenges"
---
and mine mentions it because as a much hyped reward and replacement of the old system, it's hugely lacking and not a great sign. i don't really see why this would be an odd thing to mention.
---
Same bruv
---
It's not a quality of life machine it's a fucking chore
---
I agree.  That's how New Vegas did it, and given that they took the Ranger Combat Armor right out of there and added it to Fallout 1st, I was hoping they'd just steal that mechanic too.
---
There wasnt actually that many people testing stuff. Also Bethesda have 76 with such a small team even when they are notified of things it takes forever to fix it if they ever even get to it.
---
I’ve tested it some with a quad and a two shot bashing gauss shotguns. The effect seemed to not occur as often as before, but the numbers still bugged out when enough shots landed or something. Not sure why it’s off and on seeming now. Needs more testing
---
I don’t think the sulfer sink does tho right? Can’t remember but it’s the sink that cures diseases
---
It seems like devs and gaming journalists barely \*play\* any games. They are too busy making them or writing about them.
---
Perfect example -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=848Y1Uu5Htk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=848Y1Uu5Htk)
---
There's no way I'm actually that dumb... really?
---
Same, had this happen with scrap building materials and kill assorted robots so far
---
I got a random assortment of junk items (example: steel, lead, aluminum, etc.) of about 10-20 each.
---
nope.  just some B movie i was watching.
---
Also it seems like most people don’t realise (I may be wrong) the 2000 limit is a soft limit for currency only, if you keep buying as you sell it’s unlimited. If it was any more powerful than it is now it would trash the in game ammo economy and pretty much piss off the entire community. 
---
My opinion, not to say that it’s right but for me this ammo converter is the best thing since release. For all the criticism I’ve laid on bethesda recently this update so far is really changing my mind.
---
You should be able too, it just won’t say it’s light. It just won’t say sturdy or heavy
---
Playing for 10 weeks straight without missing a single challenge is insulting, most people have like a hour or two a day. 
---
Basicly login to this game, get treasure notes, get scrip and complete dailies. This game turner into a full time job and requires more attention than a new borne. 
---
People need to stop defending this shit, because sooner or later you will realise how fucked up this game has become and you will think "well shit, that astral fucker was right"
---
**Vietnam flashbacks to NMS**
---
Don't even start. I got the same feeling right away.
---
Yeah that whole machine was very poorly designed.
---
l?
---
Don’t use switches, scrap the wires. 
---
Also, people can still shop in vendors that are off. The best way to shut off vending is to store the machines
---
How much did it yield and how long did it take?
---
Agree.  And wallpaper for ceilings in addition to both sides of a wall piece would be great too.
---
Wow. I’m exited to play when I get home /s
---
But damn Bethesda, everytime
---
The only non-UC I use is Fuel and ot won't make Fuel. So, the item I was looking lost forward to in the immediate sense is worthless to me!
---
Isn't sulphur fountain rad free (and disease cure)?
---
You can get it easily and still miss some challenges. It’s not that bad dude lol.
---
Again... I wish they got rid of seasons altogether. But it’s not unachievable.
---
Or deliberate obfuscation of functionality to minimize its usage and make it a low level option, not an endgame option.
---
EXP was not accounted for that but still, 100 score per 10,000 exp isn't a whole lot
---
I also found out today that you can bulk items and then scrap them for credit, assuming you have an abundance of plastic.
---
Noticed the grenade one. When I dropped it I got the warning that if I drop it it will disappear because I don’t know the plan. The adrenaline bork explains why I was having a harder time with multiple mobs.
---
yeah.. youre right.. probably just nobody picked up wood from a pile..
---
or if they did.. bethesda just said screw it.. our team is small and its going to take forever to fix.. just let it through..
---
It takes several hours of doing events/quests/mob farming for me, i am level315.
---
Well yeah, it's Bethesda. Lolz.
---
Nice! Much easier.
---
Xbox.  It should now be listed under "generators" when you go to place it.
---
Yeah. That's why I have a garage door with a keypad locked side door being the only way in when the power is off. But you are right, scrapping the wires, while less elegant, is more effective.
---
When Bethesda does something right they always do one thing wrong
---
Alright, see you in 10 weeks.
---
You get used to it.
---
19 000 5mm rounds
---
12 000 shotgun shells
---
22 000 fusion cells
---
The list continues. You get used to it.
---
I was tired of spamming and tried and it worked
---
On some servers I have only had to get the card once, the other two silo's allowerd me through the lazer grid. It seems like some servers are "easier" and some "harder", like how sometimes there are little to no turrets, other times there's a shit-ton
---
And almost double that if you play full-unyielding build and use common buffs from sleeping/cranberry relish/berry-mentats and such. So yeah, technically you really get SCORE from playing the game and doing events... But Beth did it the lazy way with that "Z xp = Y SCORE" workaround.
---
Nope, raider machine is so much much more useful!
---
To be fair, you can find close to 100 5.56  ammo in a single run of West Tek which takes less than 5 minutes. Never mind an hour of playing f76. If i play the game for a couple of hours i will have hundreds if not thousands of different rounds.
---
Ok. Personally all the stuff I want is in the first 50 levels so I’m not really concerned at all
---
Pacifist mode is something to think about. My first character I made in the Beta was made completely for Stealth boy Melee PvP, but my 2nd/3rd are bloodied stealth automatic/bloodied heavy weps and Survival Mode isn't a thing anymore soo... ..I don't see a reason to PvP or use my old character haha.  
---
I'll swap pacifist on because why not. Thanks for the tips. I probably deserve to get ganked after the amount of innocent players I tracked down to kill on my original character. XD
---
Found you a good video on the effect working properly. Faster than 10 sec. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikFoWniID6E
---
And let's talk about exchange rate? If I scrap all ammo I've saved in a year I wont' even be getting enought ammo for an automatic rifle to make 2 SBQ fights
---
It would literally take me hours to convert the ammo I have. Hours of sitting here clicking a button. I hate it. What don't you understand about that?
---
Unfortunately, if you use the "collect" option on it, it still just gives you a carton of dirty water.
---
I know because it's the first thing I tried when I discovered the unique properties of that sink.
---
How did you get to rank 8 I did all the challenges and I’m only 4
---
Sweet good to know
---
How the fuck? Well dang dude I just level up while I’m doing dumb shit.......of course I get my ass eaten by every fucking creature but still I level up at least once per day and I’m a level 221
---
I'm more bothered about how long it takes. I have over 10k unwanted rounds and I can do 12 at a time, it's stupid.
---
Damn, ok thanks though
---
This too.
---
It's an alcohol recipe from Biv....2 rad ant meats, water, and grain....I think
---
Ok good to know kinda stranger. I was worried about that for weeks but kept grinding for it cause I kinda expected lol
---
Every 10000 experience points you get a 100 score so maybe that's what you are seeing
---
No lag on private servers.  Just sayin
---
Every single update this game has seen has been free. Wild Appalachia, Wastelanders, now Season 1, could have easily been $29 or more, it could be worse we could be playing an EA game. 
---
Sure if you wanna hit level 100 that’s gonna be a grind, that what this games is anyway a freakin grind. Play smart. Don’t waste your time. Buy some Atom to keep this game alive. Also These days Everything is pay to play.
---
Go ahead and Down vote the truth you don’t wanna hear it anyway.
---
STILL can’t change voice output... How the **** is this still a thing...
---
Fast travel not initiating
---
Non legendary enemies “mutating”
---
Enemies randomly dropping dead. 
---
Consistently inaccurate damage, some weapons affected differently in/out of vats
---
Camp intersection/floating placement issues, and the worst snap points of any “complete” game, period.
---
How is ANY of this still a thing in this game...???
---
The point I was making was that people complaining about trying to sell tens of thousands of shotgun shells 12 at a time are missing the point of the machine. Sure I didn't get into specifics about the UI when I said it was no good. While what I meant was everything you said I didn't explicitly spell it out. That was my fault. I figured saying that using a terminal was a bad idea would include everything that comes with using a terminal but of course there is always at least one that can't figure it out for themselves.
---
Yeah, agree with you.  I got the icebox with atom points and thought, "Wow, this is way worse than just a good perk combo, like good with salt and through hiker." I instantly regretted it because it didn't look great, and also wasn't useful.  
---
Pay to win?  More like pay to lose.  It was one of the many instances I thought to myself that the main devs in charge (at the very least) probably don't play this game.
---
So is this the update that removed the negative effects from Hunger and Thirst?  Because I don't see it mentioned in the patch notes, but I'm also seeing posts about the doubled effects from Food that was supposed to come with such a change being implemented.
---
Did they state that somewhere?
---
I can still stack em. Lol. Get bent, or rather, get stuck to my punjis. Lol
---
Yes, absolutely god awful experience.
---
you can pause the game on ps4?
---
Hit escape to exit entirely. Even still, just an awful implementation for something we’ve been asking for since launch.
---
You 100% got 1000 score when that challenge hit 3/5
---
They severely cut down the amount of atoms you can generate with the new system (\~1350 over the 100 steps). And maybe for you as a veteran its not a problem NOW, but maybe next season, if they keep the ratios.
---
Wasn't the wreath for Christmas?
---
you get them before its complete.. and when you do complete it you dont..
---
thats why it looks like youre getting score for no reason in the middle of a challenge
---
You join it by tuning into the radio station for it. No one joins. They figure no on plays PVP. PVP in 76 blows.
---
Yeah I completed one weekly, didn’t get any awards so I thought it was just broken. At least now I know I gotta shoot a robot and I’ll get the SCORE
---
I think I got a few hundred 5.56 for a thousand .44 or something like that, and it took what seemed ages but was probably only 4-5 mins of furious button pressing in the menu. 
---
You have 3-4 menu interactions per sale or purchase of each small batch of ammo, that is the real pain.
---
How else are they gonna get people to stay logged in?  Huh?  An actual endgame?
---
Idk i didnt play during that time it just said i recieved a new reward
---
Why the hell i am getting so much downvotes? If you guys believe the calculation is wrong write a comment first.
---
collecting wood from downed trees dose not work, neither dose firewood piles. collecting concrete from gravel pits like in bog town doesn't work
---
Impressive.
---
That's all well and good but are people showing up and successfully completing events like Project Paradise, Radiation Rumble and other more objective oriented events?
---
As long as you get all your points sooner or later....
---
Roses are great, but a intuitive UI is what We desire   
---
This ammo converter, is a fucking hot dumpster fire.
---
no escape button on a ps4 controller. the menu is such a mess that i would bet money no one tested this on console before implementing it.
---
Adrenaline is definitely broken.
---
Todd Howards voice: *It just works.*
---
Seems fine. Classic approach to seasons. SCORE system seems like a good addition to me.
---
It's a nice change from farming legendaries and doing dailies for the 5th million time.
---
But that's too fucking hard so here's this shitty solution instead
---
I thought that happened to me too. Good catch.
---
yes. you got the award at 3/5. because its bugged.
---
Huh. They did exactly what was suggested. That makes it a strictly worse version of the Windmill, since it generates the same power but has an environment requirement the Windmill does not. Should prevent any (logical) P2W arguments.
---
Honestly, it's not as bad as you think; You can just spam the activate button, since the terminal remembers the last selection you made in each sub-menu. if you spam fast enough, you will even get some extra activations in the time that the terminal is loading the menus. 
---
It's not worse than having to spam the same button 200 times to smelt a batch of ore...
---
Yeah if you are really focused on leveling and play 4-5 hours per day and hit every possible good farming spot (that hasn't been cleared already), then it is possible to level once per day.
---
Say it again for the Bethesda workers in the back!!!
---
Yep.  Absolute garbage.  Whoever signed off on this interface has literally NEVER played this game.
---
The ammo converter is actually complete junk. If you want to turn some 10mm into 2mm, lets ignore the poor conversion rate (240 rnds for 15 rnds), its the fact it takes 34! Terminal interactions to get those 15 2mm rnds.
---
The ONLY thing it is vaguely useful for is it lets you purchase missiles/mini nukes, so you can acquire them without using springs/screws. Shame noone uses those weapons because they're junk though.
---
I recieved nothing when I completed a requirement
---
Broken. I hoped they fixed this but no... It's one thing to use these weapons on your private server but people use them on public. And when someone kills Queen this fast most people won't get any loot, as they didn't have time to do enough damage.
---
Cool, thanks! Since they are character locked I was hoping to find out before claiming one.
---
Makes no sense to me. Why reward someone for not having completed the challenge yet?! I‘ll have to take a closer look at what you said...
---
No, it is not. 
---
There will be some serious bitching if hardly anyone gets to the end of it. That's for sure.
---
Upvoting for visibility. And also because I thought event groups were best. I was wrong.
---
Also nice team. 2 Bloodies 2 Junkies.
---
The person who designed the interface for it gave zero f's to player experience. This would have been so much better handled like a vending machine.
---
Ya I don’t have it learned where’s the best place to find rad ants if you know? And how do I learn it from biv? Sorry I’m asking so many questions this kinda ruined my day
---
SHHHHHHHH! Don't tell Bethesda &lt;.&gt;
---
probably there fix for god mode
---
You can collect it from downed trees laying around outside and wood piles outside of buildings.
---
Usability is a thing that you cant connect to every "interface" in this game. those are more an "INYOURFACE" than an interface.  tedious, repetetive clicking in most cases. we all KNOW that the engine is able to do better. every UI modder just gets heartburn by seeing this trainwreck of a userinterface.
---
I am so glad people are finally doing events now tho
---
Hope so, I get a crapload from that thing
---
I mean... not great but all those missiles and mini nukes finally will have use. Even if it takes time, we just need to talk to Bethesda about getting it changed.
---
its borked.. if you check your score it should be correct
---
The whole game tells us they either don't play the game or they play with so many dev commands that the result is the same
---
Fuuuuuuuuuck!
---
Does anyone know if different barrels change the handguard's color? The green with the wood stock is tacky and there aren't any video showing the different attachments with the skin on.
---
I just threw on the ground all ammo I collected during the last couple days thinking I'd convert all that to flamer fuel... Well, not only there is no option to convert points to fuel (or am I just blind?), but also the interface is so atrocioucly repulsive I couldn't even make myself finish getting 2000 points...
---
Bye, Felicia.
---
The enclave doesn’t give a shit about West Virginia, you’re holding a lost cause
---
You either have time to play and earn SCORE or time to convert ammo. Can’t do both.
---
Yeah I’ve never experienced that in a public world. Even though I can solo her when I’m in a public event I stop hitting her after she Regens and I do crowd control on all the enemies that spawn. I’ll only chip in on her if everyone is struggling which usually doesn’t happen as most players have powerful enough builds to take her down well within the time limit these days.
---
This is exactly my feeling. There is no scenario where any reasonable person thought this was a good idea.
---
Lmao My bad, yeah, killing 3 star and getting an 1 star anti armor shovel
---
the hud is blowing up yo.. I cant stand it
---
i say if youre running lone wanderer at least you shouldnt have to see all that team shit...
---
I would like to invest in your business. One thumbs up emote.
---
Thanks , been out for like 6 weeks and as far as I can see I’ve missed quite a lot .
---
I have already removed mine from camp. It’s useless
---
Yep, noticed the same. Twice and both for 1k points. But just another day at the office for Bethesda.
---
I picked up an item
---
To display on a shelf
---
But accidently scrapped it
---
Like everyone else...
---
&gt; If you're using it as it was made to be used; small conversions of crap you picked up in the hour you were out rather than the two years you've been hoarding
---
...then you're still clicking through the terminal hundreds of times? Someone converting after every event is wasting even more time in the terminal than someone doing it in batches
---
Oh no he is leaving!  What will we do!  Lol pathetic
---
Nope, there are two other texture sets in the files though, one with woodland camo and the other one with wood furniture.
---
It wasn't bad so far, almost level 6 and I did most of the dailies and a couple weeklies.  About 1k score per reward
---
Cool, thanks guys. Thought it was. Bugged for a sec. hit up the Fasnacht town. Will do the lumber yard by 76 next
---
Or 22
---
Just do oil and go to the bathtub of soap nw of camp McKinley. https://fo76map.com/?notes=COESNtBCOcT
---
Then try the asylum for the clipboards/typewriters (springs and screws) and aluminum. 
---
Steel should be effortless. 
---
Then go to the vault tech garden thing in Flatwoods. There's enough fertilizer there combined with the fertilizer generator.
---
Let us bulk ammo lol
---
I did both daily and weekly challenges.
---
The problem is that this bonus is not listed on int in our pip boys, so it gets overlooked.  I am trying to spread awareness so that more people use the building public team option and we all earn XP faster. Also, this could help people make build and gear choices that will let them get ready to rank up those legendary perks faster.
---
For sure though they put the best rewards up front so every player can grab them.  The top tier shit is just cosmetic
---
Fallout 76 definitely gives me some lord of the flies vibes
---
but even using it for small amounts of ammo is cumbersome. i've already given up after attempting to convert a few dozen rounds of 38 because it's going to take \*forever\*. do you really want to click through that awful splash screen every single time you use it even for a few  dozen rounds? and that's before you get to the weird lag on the display.
---
in its current state it needs a major rework from the ground up - even doing just two rounds of riding shotgun will potentially 400 rounds of 5mm (iirc) ammo from just 40 minutes or so of playtime.
---
who is going to spend all that time converting 400 bullets from 40 minutes play instead of just dumping it in a suitcase somewhere?
---
It's only level 100 and the math has been done already.
---
Down votes are like badges of honor.
---
hey man.. dont be to aggressive here.. they might ban you there for that..
---
No, they were pulled out of patch 20 at the same time as they decided to pull the new event, 'A Colossal Problem' due to feedback from the PTS players.
---
Basically the Legendary Perks were nothing flash, with  many perks being copied in effect over different build types. It's hoped the perks will be retooled to give better outcomes. Wait and see on that.
---
I am disappointed, but in no way surprised. I'm convinced that Bethesda doesn't even have a professional UI designer on staff (or if they do, they *shouldn't* be on staff). They've gotten so spoiled w/only having to care(ish) about consoles and letting modders do UI for them that they make the most basic, rookie mistakes in interface design. How many of their controls are hard-coded keybinds is nightmarish enough, and it just goes downhill from there.
---
An obvious answer but save your gum when you get a perk card pack, those count for this too.
---
It was for me only, not a trap I just liked having my character sleep on a bed of nails
---
Nah not really missed anything this update dropped today. But while I said the events team is best actually another redditor pointed out that builder that gets a bonus INT is best as that will increase XP higher on all aspects of gameplay. So Builders it is.
---
If you're talking about Public Teams there IS a toggleable option in the Settings under Display that MIGHT help.
---
If not the devs, then at least management that makes the decisions and approvals for updates
---
Even on release I would never waste my time like that. The game fucks you every step of the way and this "reward" feels evil like something vault-tec would do lol
---
yeah, I hate time-limited grind-encouraging events which eliminates the casual players UNLESS you open up your wallet. sure one could just say "fuck it" and don't do it but that blows too. Disappointed.
---
Use Woodchucker perk
---
Todd? Is that you?
---
Just kidding but i'm sure you can understand the frustration of the community.
---
They thought they could finally exchange all the useless ammo they have in an efficient way. I'm sure some players were hoarding ammo for weeks in order to exchange it for the ammo type that they actually need.
---
Just to be greeted by a terminal that let's you exchange 12 bullets at a time. I'm not losing sleep over it but when i first used the converter i was like" ooooooooook, yup i'm not going to use this ever again". But at the same time you're right. People will bitch about any little thing. 
---
whatchagonnado ey
---
Happened on the destroy assorted robots and the gather building supplies not really bothered the only thing out the full board I wanted was the ammo converter and that was a mega let down and the rest is just skins and scraps of currency was kinda hoping for more
---
Because I bet the good version will be available via atomic shop half way through season 1. Probably their bass-ackward way to avoid the cries after the refrigerator drama. Crap one is free and easy to get - efficient one is atoms.
---
Just got mine. 
---
Pros: It looks neat! Will collect dust in an interesting shape.
---
Cons: Everything else. The UI seems intentionally complicated. It just doesn't make sense at all. It takes entirely too long to use it as implemented.
---
They've proven they can adapt vendors to use specific currency types. Put a vendor window up, assign each ammo type a point value for buying/selling. We vendor the ammo in any amounts we choose to for points. Maybe have ammo of favorited weapons come with the pop-up warning before vendoring to help prevent accidents, but not a requirement, don't overexert yourselves now. Then spend points for ammo we want. Done. I thought this up in like 2 minutes.
---
I got it and was excited 
---
Used it and was disappointed. If Bethesda is gonna steal the ranger armor of fallout new Vegas why not steal the ammo workbench too smh do better Bethesda
---
bethesda should of just made it so i could dump ll of one kid of ammo in the machine to convert it to what i want all it is now to me is a paperweight
---
Oh no! I was actually excited for the converter. This has been the theme for me playing FO76. Excitement turned to incredible disappointment, lol. Well hey, thanks for letting me know so I don't work too hard to try to get it =P I do hope they change how ineffectual it really is.
---
Could be.
---
I just got SCORE, immediately, from a Mr. Messenger event.
---
Perhaps it's random?
---
EDIT: The repeatable XP is definitely what I'm seeing when it's lagged.  Which raises the question of Public Events and whether or not it's guaranteed SCORE or not.
---
Call me Bob. I’m on team Builder.
---
Bulk your stored wood then scrap it.
---
There are days that i can chill and play a lot of hours, leveling during these days it's coming automatic, other days you need to log in for 20-30 minutes, do your daily challenges quick and log out.
---
Yes except if I wanted to play fortnite I would just go play fortnite because they generally have more amusing cosmetics. Also this obviously isn't going to remain free forever so there's going to be a double subscription you'll have to pay for if you want fall out first and participate in this.
---
I think if i had more time to play, but I only allow myself maybe 1-2 hrs at most a day (parenting), so i got tired of only doing those 3 quests every day.  I got tired of playing every day, honestly.  It was a conscious choice to back off so I have time for other things lol
---
Wait so you mean I can grind west tek and just keep getting 200 XP from those super mutants endlessly? Or it’s is like I only have one challenge to kill a certain amount?
---
Yeah no one was joining my building team earlier but when i switched it to events everyone did :(((
---
I dont say incentives to pay for a game are wrong, but the way they are doing it here is wrong.
---
The prime example is warframe, with the nightwave weeklies/dailies. Dailies are not as impactfull on the grand scheme, and if you miss weeklies you have a change to catchup after you have done your weeklies from this week. Plus the other stuff they bring in case of actual playable new content.
---
Sure Warframe has a bigger playerbase, and so generate more revenue. But they way they try to generate revenue in fo76 is not the way to increase your playerbase.
---
True, but it seems to be for the same reasoning underarnor don't work with it.
---
I’ve got my camp nestled in the corner or two rail cars. Has an aluminium deposit and sits just south east of white springs.
---
I love grind!
---
Is there a way to remove just one particular mutation from a list of 7 or 8?  I think I know the answer to this, but thought I would ask anyway just in case.
---
Also there’s an option to return to main menu after you finish completing a conversion.  After that it’s just 1 back-out away.
---
Call it Brute Force. Instead of a bobby pin you jam a screw driver in there and just crank it open.
---
Is it easy to get?
---
Yeah that’s what I had just thought about is that maybe some people don’t have time
---
There a glitch right now with nuclear winter where you can obtain the haloween,Christmas, and survivor rewards get them now before they patch it lol
---
Do u know if any vendors sell it as well?
---
Do you honestly believe a casual would be happy to use this interface for a few thousand ammo they've hoarded just out of habit and realised now they can make use of them?
---
You'd be deluded to think that they would think any different long term. Maybe ok short term but they'll realise just like any other player.
---
Ma favorite thing to see on this sub
---
Yes, very
---
Couple hours, easy peasy.
---
That would explain why enemies felt tankier than usual.
---
Yeah, I noticed that problem as well. But keep trying and spread the word.
---
Alright, thank you. Hopefully they fix the problems with the skin before they release those because I really want the version with wood furniture.
---
i did challenges for about half an hour and im already at level four so it shouldnt take that long
---
+karma thanks!
---
How long does it take? I’m downloading the update now
---
Yeah I use my XBox controller on PC. Much better.
---
The player base is literally still alpha testers for this game.
---
Facts
---
Yea i consider myself a new player, thou long time fan of series, and the moment i heard its based on a terminal, and i heard the rates i knew no one actually bothered to test this feature thoroughly. 
---
Like actual hooked player, that has to deal with that. I mean has anyone saw anything like that anywhere? A simple question, hey guys we're gonna give you a way to convert ammo, its gonna be based on a terminal, you're gonna convert this amount of ammo, every batch will need to be picked individually from the list.... im not gonna even continue, cause every reasonable, tethered to the ground person would realise at this point, that its the worst idea ever, and given the resources they have at their disposal in terms of previous games, also the worst pick of mechanic used for that.
---
Im still in the phase of loving the game, and i still have a lot of places to visit, flying around, and grinding, but seriously, i don't know what the hell is up with games lately, that seem to deliberately make their playerbase suffer for playing the game. Of the top of my head, RPG Path of Exile on PS4, and inability to drink all potions at once. It's not a problem on PC, it's definitely on a console. Anthem, some good mechanics to piss off there too, i could do this all day probably. I will stop now for the sake of my sanity...
---
I agree it could have been done better. I'm not disputing that. But people are making way to big a deal out of it. I don't know why anyone expected it to be any different than it is. Like I said, I agree 100% that it could be reworked for convenience but it was a level 5 (of 100) reward on the first ever season, folks just set themselves up for disappointment expecting it to he any different than it is.
---
Hit up Pricketts Fort as well
---
Rose are red 
---
Violets are blue 
---
I'm stuck in west Virginia and so are you
---
I run the game with no UI. All these forced pop ups (challenges, legendary items, etc.) are really annoying. I would love to have a toggle/mod that eliminates these and their circus like noises.
---
Is it just me or is anyone else mad about the service rifle being a skin for the handmade instead of being a new gun in general.
---
Can’t log on until the kids are in bed, but itching to check out the 20. What kind of quests/ challenges are they? Can you give me a teaser of the first couple?
---
Holy crap I didn’t even think to the console/controller experience, I’m on PC. You mean you actually have to exists out of all of those menu choices after converting?! How in the absolute fuck did they overlook this?!
---
Same is happening to me on PC. I reached rank 7 and didn't get any points for completing the "build up your camp" or "kill robots" challenges.
---
Ugh. This sounds horrible and its probably one of only a handful of things I was looking forward to in the season. 
---
Does it have to be in lots of 12? Can you put say 10 of a type in it to convert? I would at least use it to dump the random 40mm, misssiles and mini nukes etc that get rewarded for stuff but theres no way Im hanging on to 12 of each
---
I found some at jail break just floating there. It was weird.
---
thank god for that.. thanks for the heads up
---
Ive only logged on to test broken stuff I havent really played a session yet
---
and here I thought the ammo economy would've tanked, now I'm not so sure. 🤔
---
Given that you have to go to Scrap ammo &gt; ballistic low power &gt; 10mm to get 30pts, and therefore need to do this whole loop 10x  to get 300 pts(and since its in different places, you cant just mash space bar like crafting)
---
You then need to go Buy ammo &gt; energy ammo &gt; 2mm to get......15 rnds of 2mm.
---
I genuinely think its faster (to the point I may try a "race" against a friend) to go to lucky hole, pick up all the lead, go to west tek, pick up all the guns, scrap and smelt everything, and craft 2mm than it is to sit at that terminal trading in extremely low ammounts for low value.
---
Dude I would buy those shotgun shells off of you. I'm a shotgun build
---
Some of them are very simple, like there's one where you kill 10 scorched and a REPEATABLE that requires you to hit 10,000 XP. Now, that might seem like a lot but because of Public Teams having an experience bonus you can ramp that up really quickly. Then you have the daily and weekly ones ontop of that. Also some new "Kill X enemies" for Atom Shop points under challenges.
---
Isn’t that just a waste of plastic?
---
Ok thanks
---
Thanks, very random question but, are radium rifles any good?
---
https://imgur.com/a/qCU7CDr i saw this link the other day. the bugs are fixed by apes!
---
oh boy.. thats not gonna play well..
---
we might as well start brainstorming what the mob should demand as compensation now.. lol
---
I understand, I’m not dense, I’m just pointing out some methods to expedite it and pointing out that this still eclipses some of the previous methods of gaining ammo by a long shot. Especially considering there is no limit and no material outlay. 
---
I’ve literally converted my stock of random types that I’ve had stuck in my machine in just a few minutes. 
---
I can’t tell you exact amounts but at a guess I had several thousand each of fusion and plasma cells (plasma nearing 10K as I thought they would sell to plasma caster users, I was very wrong lol), around 5k 308, 1.5k 10mm, an absolute crap tonne of .38 (pretty much hoarded these since I heard about the score system) and over 9000 5mm. I also traded in a lot of my 45 ammo as it no longer tends to sell along with I think 5k shotgun shells as since the Gauss shotgun I no longer seem to sell these either. 
---
The way I do it is I clear it back down by buying 556/2mm until I can’t anymore, choose one type of ammo, and once I’ve done it once my choices are saved meaning I can literally spam the action button. 
---
I was too hoping it would be a more intuitive system and I can only guess that it’s either server limitations, or a balancing attempt. Regardless this has so far for me (I’ve had it a few hours now as it unlocked pretty much immediately) been the easiest way to farm ammo for my main two rifles since launch. Considering that I can also then on top do my usual lead farming and ammosmith crafting runs I’m easily doubling my yield in the same timeframe. 
---
Even after I got rid of my stock, farming with scrounger and selling what I find is laughably easy. 
---
I can probably say it ain’t going to be efficient enough for a heavy weapon like the Gauss mini, but for my Gauss rifle and handmade I’m getting multiple 1000’s quite quickly of each. 
---
Depending on how they look at changing this, some of the options suggested above appear on the surface to be much more resource intensive, this is a simple script and likely has very little impact on the server/game. 
---
If they were to change it, maybe just increase the base quantities. Even if I had to collect more ammo per trade I feel that would be a positive step. 
---
Making this markedly more efficient however would have a negative impact on the player economy, which a lot of players may not care about but a large proportion of the paying player base would. Caps are already worthless so losing 556/45 as a viable currency would be bad.
---
It would look even more fucking stupid then.  A carry handle with a scope or red dot on top of it.   In reality when you do that cheek weld sucks.  That’s why we have flat tops.
---
And now we're in the middle of the exciting sequel - I Hate The Ammo Converter Interface.
---
Oh, ok seems that I am late to the party.
---
I cleared out west tek and got several of them as loot from the mutants.
---
can you kill the bots?
---
Additional lvls cost a little more. Weeklys are done, waiting for tomorrow's dailies. I suspect last quarter will be a bit Grind-y....
---
No, after you finish converting it takes you to a menu to convert more, redeem points, or return to the menu.  Returning to menu means there’s just one back-out away from exiting.  
---
Or you could hold the exit button (system depending) and it’ll exit no matter how deep into the menu you are.
---
I have like 10000 plastic and it sure saves time.
---
Bethesda wants to be EA. This game has every mtx scheme imaginable minus straight up lootboxes. And at least EA games have a polish to them.
---
So for the build a camp do you have to scrap your whole camp or can you just build a piece of one? I’m just asking because I spent around 5 hours rebuilding my camp 2 days ago🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Nope, it's a skin for the handmade
---
Let me check
---
Edit: nope, can't hurt them
---
The rewards are nice but if you check the frontpage people are having issues with the ammo converter being convoluted as hell and you have to go through like 2-3 menus in the computer itself.
---
Guess it depends how much water, and how soon you thought you might be able to get out.
---
Look, they need to start cashing in, it's normal and I really get it, the previous system didn't allow that, but I don't like the fact that the game remains a bugfest and in general performs poorly (be it server wise or engine) and what we get instead is the ammo converter (spoiler: it's beyond horrible on so many different levels) and ghillie suit skins.
---
i wasn't paying attention. but you get it ridiculously fast. but also, don't expect to be too impressed by it.
---
https://imgur.com/a/qCU7CDr i saw this link the other day. the bugs are fixed by apes
---
that i can definitely agree on, i expected nothing from the converter and it's turned out how i expected it to (well, worse if i'm being honest...)
---
Shows that they really don't give a shit about the players and the PTS was a fucking farce, because they didn't test shit like this on the PTS.
---
Is it just me, or does the Shielded Secret underarmor not provide the listed bonuses?  The +4 strength is not applied.
---
Interesting, I haven’t gotten them from enemies yet.
---
Welp, it is a huge nerf nevertheless. If tgey have let the atoms dailies/weklies and release those items as bundle we could get them easily. Look at the board mate, a lot of the steps are garbage rewards like 1 k caps and others like that.
---
Carry handle for iron sights, no carry handle for optics. By the way you can put optics on carry handles.
---
Hell I'd do that 
---
Then call in those developers and kick them in at the ass, cause it shouldn't be so hard to convert ammo 
---
Rather they should port in the ammo benches from new Vegas or why not allow the tinker workbench to break down ammo hence the name tinker and let players keep building their own ammo
---
Nope not this week
---
Pretty much
---
I think its tied to the upcoming Brotherhood story content.
---
No maybe next week
---
I got confused and ate my PlayStation.
---
It's been like this since day 1 of the game.
---
Makes sense
---
I know.. I only read the new tab.. ive seen about a dozen ammo converter threads go by at least so far..
---
But does it net more wood..? It just seems like extra steps for the same amount of wood but I’m a filthy casual.
---
Same if your game crashes while loading into the game for the first time. Happened to me :/
---
They do, in their sterile little office environment, where everything works perfectly.
---
Yep, the public teams are amazing - a real game changer for the better!
---
I just found a note " back in a bit" and there is a radio with trying to transmission something.
---
\8&lt;
---
Finally a common sense post.
---
Seems like a fair deal, i in. But serously if you use 44 i can shower you with them mate.
---
 So you're disappointed but for other reasons.
---
The fact that this got through is telling. It confirms that the devs do not play their own game. Specifically, since they didn't let us test it on the PTS, the only option was internal testing. Since even the most out of touch person could notice this as an issue having played...well, any game, really, then the only person who must have had contact with this was it's designer. Who, at the very least, should probably be moved to non-functional item designs in the future. 
---
People can defend Bethesda all they want and say this is whiny, which they are free to do. But having played this game since beta being hopeful that things would get better... It has become increasingly hard to do so.
---
What’s so disappointing about this week? It’s the best one we’ve had in a while
---
I want a door that springs open and splatters anyone who tries to enter. Atom shop: "Joke Door"
---
Yep, I just got it too. Came to see what was up, I guess I'll keep playing for a bit and keep some rewards I missed due to being new haha
---
I have it in my rustic cabin build, but I never put anything in it.
---
Well, shit.
---
No. Public events do not give you Score Points.
---
Doubt it since the T65 seems to be secret service. Wouldn't entirely make sense for a BoS paint for the T65. Then again a lot of things in this game doesn't make sense
---
Or just let the season reward be an unlocked upgrade to the tinker bench that allows us to scrap ammo to base crafting components. Too simple?
---
800 posts complaining...I've told you a million times not to exaggerate
---
For sure broken. Buddy and i tested it on XB1 earlier today
---
I am convinced that there is someone high up at Zenimax/Bethesda that either everyone likes or is important to key people who is incredibly bad at their given job.  There are far too many examples of things like this converter that get made and are done very badly.
---
Scrap the fucking thing and just let us sell ammo to vendors for fucks sake.
---
Damn it lol I got to 42 wood piles before I finished 5 other junk collections in that challenge. Don’t even have to get the rest. What a waste of time. Guess I’ll start selling wood again...
---
That’s XP, not score points.
---
Also applies to hacking - typing super hard is more effective! Or maybe call it “Password” and the answer is always “Password”.
---
There are two variations of it though. The original useless one in the last category, and the new generator one in the generators category.
---
doormats that auto close or open the door when you walk over them...
---
eta- Im thinking like minecraft doors..
---
If you do 10 Encryptid, at about 1000 XP per event, that is 100 score points. Not great.

There’s lots of fun things in the game and I think I’ve been around a bit (level 98 but only able to play sporadically due to wife and kids). I’m willing to suffer the tedium of doing it in small amounts over time, it’s still better than having to find a nearby railway station and dumping 17 mini-nukes in a suitcase for some random soul to bloat their stash with instead of mine.
---
I run a stealth commando and heavy Gunner, just run west tek and hunters ville a couple of times, that’s EASY level ups, and I have two level 200 characters and after two and a half server hops you get a level which is really good considering you can get through it within 5 minutes if you know all the spawns and it’s one of the best places to find a lot of legendaries, not so much huntersville but west tek for sure
---
Of. Course.
---
one heart per ammo? hope youre ready to emote 10000plus times.
---
Might be time for a break?
---
This one is super frustrating.
---
That's how this fanbase is. Something new comes out, you have people being realistic about it and they get downvoted and saying that it's going to be amazing. Then when it's released everyone is in uproar about it being a mess. Vaas needs to tell these people the definition of insanity
---
Basically instant kill walls. I encountered one once. Stared at it for a minute, wasn't carrying anything so I tested it out. They basically made a narrow hallway that essentially was impossible to walk through without bumping one side or the other. So after I tested it and instantly died. I equipped lightfooted, crouched, and walked though the hall without taking damage. Basically it's a noob griefing method.
---
I'll use it from time to time. At least it's something for the random bullets I don't need as opposed to throwing them away.
---
Oh yeah it is BAD. Its a great idea but.. Classic Bethesda.. Its messed up. Also using it in Power Armor causes some funny bug to happen. Oh AND you can place it in Workshops!
---
So hitting last levels will be really tedious, for every day I miss I need to grind 200k exp to get 2k Score back or pay, thanks bethesda for this great opportunity but I'm out
---
Open challenges and complete the daily requirements
---
Was pretty easy
---
What's at 59?
---
Bethesda just doesn’t want people making Gucci Race Glocks.
---
signed
---
Expensive and stupidly so. 350 for 100 .50cal but 300 for 5mm? The damage difference between the 50 cal machine gun and minigun is about 100damage per shot, that price similarity makes no fucken sense. The Gatling Gun, which should've always used a different, rarer round like. 308 is fucking that system up. Messy
---
I dont think the design of the interface is an accident. Its another kind of gating
---
I knocked it out over my lunch hour.
---
Awesome. Thanks for the teaser without it being a spoiler.
---
If you go to pip boy radio you can listen to brotherhood broadcast. Same as is on the radio in the tent. Doesn’t tell you much though. 
---
Be interesting how the astronaut quest line changes now, as part of it was in there before.
---
beckley
---
Would be interested to see the results of the race, hopefully one of the big 76 YouTubers pick this up. 
---
I suppose it is more efficient to wait until you have large amounts of each, take advantage of the fact that your route through the directory is saved and spam the action key. You’ll find that you hit the limit very quickly this way. 
---
I’m not blindly defending its archaic Ui here (that I agree with) I’m just making sure that people reading don’t just write this off, not bother even laying it down and miss out as it’s worked really well for me. For a free utility that unlocked pretty much immediately after the patch launched, it more than met with my expectations (which were admittedly low as I went through the data mine). 
---
Definitely negates any rifleman or non automatic build ever having to craft or actively farm ammo, especially 556 (based on if you farm west tek you end up coming out with more than you went in with if you are bloodied).
---
I finished a weekly and did not see the score popup. Do wonder if it was a visual issue or another big not awarding what it's supposed to.
---
I genuinely like what they seemed to want to create, both before Wastelanders and now after. They had some great concepts. 
---
But it’s getting hard to have fun when all you’re worrying about is the next issue that breaks the game.
---
I cant stand it. I carry a lot of ammo and chems with the chem backpack and ammo weight reduction perks and I die and my weight jumps from about 250 to 850
---
That might deter some. Maybe one day Bethesda will just put an off switch that fully disables your machine. Too easy right? Lol
---
That's the hopper for adding the spent shells
---
So, a broken perk, an extremely underwhelming ammo converter and the usual broken because untested weapon skins.
---
Could be worse, I guess, but a slow clap is still in order.
---
/slow clap
---
Eh.
---
If you repost this with a more descriptive title and first few lines I think it'll get the traction it really needs. People need to know the insane grind this will be.
---
Damn, hope you lost only daily, since losing all weekly may prevent you from getting to level 100 Score without spending ATOMS
---
I’m gonna assume and accept as well that some of these issues are platform related as I’m having absolutely no menu lag spamming my action key meaning I’m not having any issues making ammo quickly. I know from experience coming from Xbox to PC that terminals are now a lot quicker for me.
---
Looks like it is now working as intended.
---
As an Herbivore (in game) I am happy with the outcome. A little garden and a couple of short walks gives you 5 proper 2x bonuses including 10% exp.
---
Yes! Reward the NW players! Upvoted for visibility!
---
To be fair, the main issue is with the UI and it should be pretty simple to see how inefficient and clunky it is. I fail to see how it taking 30 minutes to fully convert one type of ammo to another is whiny. They'd have to do *less* work on their end to make it a slider like everything else.
---
I checked my internet connection as well. It’s fine and dandy. Can’t figure out why it’s suddenly so choppy.
---
Cough cough.
---
if you're next to them yeah.
---
If you drink from it, yes. If you collect from it you just get standard dirty water.
---
i only did 3/5 of the requirements and it gave me the 1k score /shrug
---
Awesome! Nice find 👍🏼
---
*Looks at his SMG collection sadly.*
---
I also appear to have 4 from somewhere and I don't have the plans for them either.
---
Didn’t they literally make something like that in FO3‘s The Pitt? Except much better?
---
There is a nice handmade rifle skin which make it look more like service rifle from NV and nice  pilot outfit bundle.
---
It's only 5 ranks in, why not do a couple dailies? Took about 45mins to get to rank 5
---
To be fair that would be nice for all their shite interfaces. Why can't I smelt all my ore at once or at least in increments of like 10, it's just ridiculous.
---
For the first time since the free week I managed to complete PP with all animals alive without my four-man premade team. Truly something for the ages.
---
If you don't have the time to grind for it, then you certainly don't have the time to actually use it.
---
"Converting" ~1200 shells into ~200 5.56 takes about 20 minutes.
---
Thanks, when I get the chance I will try and make something out of it. I really want a cool looking sniper tower or something like that.
---
There is a repeatable challenge to earn XP.. but like.. what's the issue here? I've played for about 3 or 4 hours today and I have only the Nuclear Winter daily left, and for weekly I need to kill one more legendary and that's it.
---
Sure, I did a little wonky stuff like build a bunch of silly things at a workshop like decor and stuff, but other than that i've been playing normally. 
---
If anything, I'm bummed that after only a few hours of play I'm almost done with the weekly objectives.
---
The thing is, the logic behind them being malicious (more difficult to use -&gt; worse user experience -?&gt; less ammo ends up converted, so players still spend time farming ammo) would still work just fine if, say, we were able to put X ammo in, designate X ammo out, then leave as a timer slowly processes them. They could tune it so that it takes the same amount of time spamming spacebar currently takes, and get still get a relatively positive reaction from the community. This is not malice, it is rote incompetence.
---
Give what more than a few minutes?
---
Ah that’s a shame, hope it’s fixed soon as I’d already bought earlier and still haven’t placed it on my handmade.
---
20k? Not bad I mean I have over 100,000 556 rounds  and weight reduction perks help so much
---
they claim to have fixed that
---
It gives the reward early. You get it for doing only part of all the required steps for those missions. Do the math, but I don’t think it’s even possible to reach level 7 ish without being rewarded for them.
---
I did notice the pop ups for completion early, and the actual mission stays up even though it’s done.
---
OK, so out of 100 levels, 10 of them are variations on a ghillie theme. That's a hard commitment. I apologize if this offends anyone who is really in love with the look. I personally find it as lazy design, I'm not a huge fan of camouflage in general, as it is pointless in PVE when it doesn't give any sneak bonuses and you can just cloak with other methods. At the very least it should take up less slots, one level to unlock all the armor plans, one level for weapons, and one level for accessories maybe.
---
Well someone should report that bug then. 
---
Edit:
---
I just thought of something. What if every other week has public events as a weekly challenge and xp on the off weeks?
---
They *really* want people to spend money on Atoms. I won't do it, though. I've never spent money on Atoms and I never will.
---
They need to take some cues from Epic's game Fortnite. They make it relatively easy to get to rank 100 every season, but give extra perks like skin variants if you get higher than that.
---
I was wondering about this... Completed six dailies before realizing I was only showing credit for 3/5. Not really inspiring me to keep grinding this shit out, whether the rewards are cool or not
---
I mean just the ability to apply wallpaper to both sides of a wall would be nice instead of just the one.
---
&gt; But having played this game since beta being hopeful that things would get better... It has become increasingly hard to do so. 
---
I was like that back with Fallout 4 hoping things would improve with 76. I've just given up now. Have zero interest in Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI.
---
The only hope there is that Bethesda does listen to and follow up on SOME of the feedback. Hope this is no different. Just means that it won't be fixed for like maybe a year or 2.
---
The levels start at 1000pts and go up 25 each time, so the first levels will be fast, the later levels take longer.
---
The dailys grant 250pts - there's 5 dailys (all easy stuff -level up once, kill 10 scorched, eat a piece of gum etc). There's a NW daily that gives 250, and theres a bonus daily worth 500pts that you get by completing 5 dailys.
---
The weekly's are worth 1000 - 1500pts. These are harder, but not particuarly difficult - scrap certain junk, kill 5 different types of robot etc.
---
Currently there seems to be a bug with these; you get the pts when you manage 3/5. However the challenge doesn't disappear until you do all 5.
---
Theres's then a repeatable of get 10,000 xp which grants 100pts. While obviously lesser than the "normal" challenges, you can get this as many times as you like.
---
The combination of low levels being easier to complete + most people doing their weeklies on day 1 means lots of people have jumped to rank 7/8/9
---
Fast traveling for free to any of your teammates' camps is the bees knees.
---
I just cycled between a few teams so I could visit all their vendors without spending a cap on travel.
---
Ok good luck
---
Do you want us to just play the game for you?
---
I understand that people want to burn ammo they dont use.. its not an invalid desire..
---
personally I never pick up ammo I dont use.. and what I am rewarded I always drop immediately..
---
I craft all of my ammo because I am greedy for XP by any means.. little or large..
---
by the time im done gathering mats (hops to a couple or three locations) Ive got the XP from the mobs I had to kill in addition to the pittance you get for crafting.. its a part of my regular routine...
---
I feel bad for people who were waiting for this.. even if the rates continue to suck I hope at least the UI gets imporved for them...
---
That's what I've run into. Seemed to trigger on 3 completions rather than 5 of the camp stuff and the robot kills.
---
honestly got it already. i think i did 2 weeklies, 5 dailies, and a few events
---
How on earth is this a humble brag?
---
As someone who designs products for a living, who tf is managing this team?
---
Wtf I’ve been gone for three weeks and we can scrap ammo what has this game been up to
---
I’ve enjoyed these groups quite a lot. I’ve been using both the events one and the hunter one. 
---
As a player who’s been solo pretty much since launch taking advantage of charisma and card sharing via this method is also ridiculously helpful. Makes me shameful that I ditched my friends for PC a long time ago 😅
---
The only thing I did hate was the constant notifications but I’ve since learnt you can shut these up
---
Seems pretty universal so far. No idea how that made it through testing, with it being a lot of the actual content for this patch, but considering it’s a player positive I doubt it will last long.
---
Yay, I unlocked a sink....should go well with my kitchen less camp.
---
Mods there is a dozen threads on this in the last 5 hours.  No bug, so a search and they outline what to do with your mods to fix it, not a bug
---
I was just about to post this. I gave away 130 some 44 and out of 150 points I’ll get 12 45 rounds well that’s just shitty
---
40 minutes in he subtly is the first person on the sub to post about having reached level 5
---
I think they were mostly PvP weapons, because of the rad damage, but it'd be worth trying, I've heard that the rad damage heals things like ghouls so you would have to test that
---
As an extra bit of info, Radium Rifles with the Explosive legendary effect are Legacy items, they don't drop in the game anymore and can fetch a high price
---
Any energy weapon with the explosive legendary effect also falls into that category, as well as Explosive Harpoon Guns
---
I agree 100%. I think they're more focused on starfield. It sounds like they're putting all their bets on that title restoring their name. I just recently got 76, I thought all the nonsense was done and they learned from their mistakes. Silly me. But it's kind of always been that way, their games are great and that's why its so frustrating. Hopefully they'll fix these new issues quickly, good luck on the grind
---
Naaa they are not stored there.
---
My guess would be that it's locked in order to not be used when the owner wants to use it. That piece of shit takes forever to convert just a small amount.
---
Here I have with 80k Cells with Batteries Included, and Bandolier I also have 90k 5.56 and 40k 45. Both perks have saved me so much space.
---
Or 24
---
Playing on which platform?
---
Damn
---
Yeah the ammo converter in theory is a great idea. It’s just terribly implemented. The games been out for years and they think people are gonna be converting micro amounts of rounds at a time? 
---
Also the in game ammo economy got wrecked not that long ago.
---
What new elements?
---
ProTIP: After You select ammo to scrap for points just press TAB/BACK, it will let you select same ammo almost immediately without going through the menus again :D
---
I was just scouring the sub for this.. I have noticed this as well. I'll randomly get points, but then when I complete a weekly, I won't get any. Adding up everything I appear to have the correct amount of SCORE though, so at least it's not screwing us.. it's just making it easier lol.
---
Their reasoning will be that it was free and that they gave you Atoms that you should have spent to get to rank 100. And then, in all of Bethesda's infinite wisdom, will announce that season 2 costs $10.
---
So no one else can be disappointed by it, of course.
---
Bow does that a lot too
---
Mods please don't nuke me.
---
You needed a friend and an explosive energy weapon like Gatling Plasma, Tesla Rifle or Laser Rifle, anything that turns you to goo/ash. You asked for a friend to hit/kill you so you got the "take revenge" button, then you killed yourself with the explosive energy weapon and as you turned into goo/ash you mashed the "take revenge" button. For some reason that gave you godmode and allowed to stack buffs.
---
Source: The youtube TYR.
---
True.worst case you'll catch up next day.
---
I'm already satisfied this feature didn't break some major other ones.tweaking will come.
---
I like this. 
---
However, just running a few events on a public team, I really realized how much junk/loot i was missing. 
---
ALL piles lootable, yes I know it's always worked this way, but I just never bothered with the hassle of making teams much unless my friends were on. 
---
Now I'll be running with a team no matter what. So much scrap... And less worrying about if I tagged all the legendaries or had to restrain myself killing guys so others could get a piece.
---
Ammo economy? Really? Who is selling enough of various ammo types to have an economy in it? If I see ammo for more than 2-3 caps per depending on the type It's a hard pass from player vendors, and I don't think anyone buys from the ammo vending machines at all.
---
I know bro.   To think they’d give you the option of removing the carry handle for optics is giving them way too much credit.   I just meant it would rally look dumb, as it does in real life, to mount optics on the carry handle.  What is really lazy is that the skin has a picatiny rail.....but they kept the receiver mounted AK scope mount!   By Zeus’ beard what a ship show!!!
---
What am I gonna do with the 193k 38 stashed in my pockets for safekeeping? You know what? Probably gonna drop it at 76.
---
Greg.
---
An option is to grab a workshop and build there.  Stay crouched, and leave your junk at home if PvP is a concern.
---
I'm missing the salute emote. the one I use the most....
---
That truly wouldn't surprise me. This sub would implode if that happened.
---
They could have just allowed ammo turn-ins at the ammo vend stations near train stations, given you Ammo Scrip, and then let you buy the ammo from the stations with either Scrip or caps, but NO!  NO DOUGHNUT FOR YOU!
---
Sounds fun. I just gotta build that now.
---
No problem, just find my bags around the wastes.
---
Xbox here..I was about to post this, I’m actually testing it in a public/ private server and I have not gain no adrenaline buff. I have mine maxed out on 5 and yet I’m doing the same amount of damage after I killed an enemy. This is absurd, this needs to get fixed immediately.
---
Don’t read this is you want to avoid spoilers.
---
&gt;!The Brotherhood of Steel will be taking up residence there soon.!&lt;
---
I think the worst part of this whole debacle is the fact that some ATX employee finished work on this skin several weeks ago. This got leaked and not a single person recognized this as an issue.
---
Ah OK. New player do tend to pick up everything and carry it with them. I remember when I needed junk
---
Totally agree it needs to be able to scrap all of one item, if not let you sell multiples without entering the terminal, I did maybe 1/4 of my ammo before dumping the rest cause I can’t be farked repeatedly doing that...
---
Hold B
---
What platform? Mine's fine on Steam.
---
It remembers your choices- just mashing confirm will sell the last batch you sold, you can sell everything very quickly
---
I was thinking (hoping) that it would be a 2 step sister to the Raider ammo machine. Just deposit all the ammo you want to convert, and choose from the terminal what ammo you want in return. 
---
Boy was I wrong.
---
and boy was I SEVERELY disappointed.
---
BTW you need a TONS of ammo to make a decent amount of desired ones, and like 10 minutes of interaction to scrap and create 100 ammo. Expect almost nothing
---
My question is how do you sustain 68INT all the time? Or is this u just flexin your max? Bc itd be a lil more genuine to show ppl what they cud expect for xp at INT between 20-30 since even with the +4 from Builders and +15 from Uny, this is where most ppl will fall into. Unless ofc your poppin buffs like nobody’s business in which case i ask again, how do you sustain that?
---
We could only dream haha or, heck, maybe some kind of system that prevents you from getting caps past the max. Like the vanilla vendors have.
---
I don’t think anyone really buys at over 1c each but for a long time now albeit a short period after the dupe scandal 556 and 45 have been a pretty stable 1/1 replacement for caps in the trade forums. Easy way to bypass the caps limit and pay 30k plus for a very rare legacy etc. 
---
In game I make probably 70% of my caps selling ammo at 1c each. Today I have been only using the converter for ammo I physically use and then selling everything I make. Hence why it’s working ok for me as I use single shot weapons.
---
Ya I found that out from the radio
---
Ammo converter sucks. For PS4 players, hold the circle button and it exits. Hate that machine. Wanted it forever and implementation is awful. AWFUL!  🤷🏻‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Dont. It's done poorly too apparently.
---
How hard is it for Bethesda to fix their game? Lol.
---
It's really, really easy to get to level 5 in that period of time. Everything on the score menu for today is easy. I finished everything in maybe 2 hours and I spent half that time farting around in my base.
---
I wish we can do this, I make 90 or so molotovs and npc them, gets rid of a whole bunch of scrap I don’t need as well
---
Well ... I completed two of the weeklies (collecting stuff, and building stuff) and got ZERO points for either.
---
Both register as having been completed ... neither moved the needle/metre a millimetre.  That's 2000 points gone, that I can't get back for a week.
---
Anyone else have this issue?
---
The exchange rate is hot garbage too. I need 1200 5.56 rounds or shotgun shells for just 300 plasma cartridges...
---
I honestly wish it would just let us scrap ammo instead so I could just make the ammo myself which already is much more efficient
---
but You can Press TAB - SPACE -TAB - SPACE ... to buy or sell last selected ammo type ;)
---
its what the mob wants tho
---
Mentioned this in the other thread, but it remembers the last choice you made. So just mash confirm to sell everything. You don't need to slowly search for your last choice.
---
I can adjust, though the +3 attributes from Scorchbeast aren’t easily replicated w/ veggies.
---
Hey the more the merrier right?
---
Lost 2 weeklies :(
---
I'm on PS4, Sorry :-(.
---
How tf do people figure these things out?
---
this is perhaps the bossest stuff I have ever seen in atx
---
Ah no worries, worth a shot :)
---
I'm curious as to why it was mentioned in the update that you could use Atomic points to rank up... But in the game, the "rank up" button is grayed out and you can't use it.
---
God, I hope so.
---
That and a stack of cash generating duped presents.
---
How much can I skip with 25k atoms. I’ve been saving ever since I started just for this moment lol. Finally something to spend atoms on
---
I’m not complaining lmao
---
Same here, if you aren't used to checking around doors before you enter and examining thi ge that look odd then you are likely to get caught by one of these. Most new players come in completely oblivious to these kind of tricks.
---
I didn't say how this ended in the last post. But once I started going through the hall, the griefer realized I figured out how to get past his defenses to his shop and logged out before I could buy anything. Dirty move really.
---
I see it as having 2 uses; 
---
Helps low levels who actually struggle for ammo. 
---
Allows you to have missiles/mini nukes/40mm without spending springs screws. While Im not expecting meta players to suddenly do this (fatman/missile launchers are still rubbish after all), the more casual players might have some fun with those weapons now they're not spending precious screws/springs to make the ammo.
---
I suspect this is why it was such an early reward - so pretty much anyone who plays in the next 10 weeks, including the fresh out the vault newbies, will get it.
---
Anyone with visions of getting rid of 14,000  .38 rnds however isnt going to find it as useful (unless they dont mind a very long repetitive evening)
---
I am defiantly outnumbered in my opinion 😅
---
I won’t complain if it’s improved at all but I’ve gotta say it’s still worth using. 
---
What I don’t want though is another stash based camp item that becomes a target for a scammer. I’ll be honest this worries me even though BGS say it’s sorted. 
---
I still don’t have any accessible stash boxes in my camp when I have vendors or displays, and I generally keep my prized stuff on my character at all times. 
---
Doesn’t appear to be a way to exploit the new ammo converter (I realise this is no excuse for the bad UI, but it’s a lesser evil).
---
Confirmed. Was wondering why enemies were a lot more tanky.
---
Are you kidding me? What the hell is the damned PTS good for if the builds that are tested on it aren't the ones that get pushed to the live environment?
---
No, it doesn’t.
---
goes without saying..
---
Good question
---
No offense but these guys are really horrible at doing their job. The atom shop has been mad disappointing for weeks now.
---
Yep, been at it for a while now. PP went off without a hitch for me, maybe first time I've ever seen that.
---
I’ll send you a friend request and introduce you to the group I’m a part of. I’ve really enjoyed it so far. Give me about an hour
---
IDK, you look pretty exposed to the water in PA
---
Ya know, I think I have a plan, I'm going to post it. I'll call it the Bank of Appalachia. Lol
---
The cap max is kind of a joke really.
---
It was made well if thay ment to make it shit
---
I’m going to scrap it...worthless.
---
It’s likely the same amount, except it counts for said challenge.
---
I think the devs stopped playing a long time ago. Even they got tired of all the bugs and no end game
---
Is it really? I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t disappointed to hear that
---
It's also obvious that whatever is on the PTS is NOT what gets pushed to the userbase on patch day because it's literally impossible that no one noticed this screw up.
---
Is there a specific way i recieved the wreath a while ago but i just died
---
Pretty sure it was bugged to be given to everyone when it was obtained through the tricentennial edition. So to get another salute you have to pay 20$, like you should've had to in the first place.
---
And we are already complaining that we can't covert ammo fast and efficiently enough for us to run out and kill things quickly...
---
At least you can convert your ammo. Like damn I just happy that it is in the game.
---
Also have to throw out there that the ammo converter.. arguably the best reward is next to useless.. the largest part of the machine is insanely massive and used for only a boring animation? The whole machine is pretty much a laughable attempt at a cool idea with the prices for converting and purchasing being absurd and the majority of the ammo types in my opinion are listed under incorrect categories having 10mm listed two times and once being under energy ammo for whatever reason
---
I can't even use it (PS4) when I try to use the console, my character just zooms in underneath it and there is no interface
---
Sounds good!
---
At this point this is just emberrassing.
---
What is the mod name?
---
Clipping issues or something.
---
I imagine that it will be a "ride" like Mr. Fuzzy, maybe giving Rested
---
It’s a shame you even have to mention about people potentially exploiting it. I’m sure they’ll iron out the UI for it eventually.
---
Too bad we’re not gonna be able to afford any of this cool new shite because they’ve taken away our weekly and daily challenge atoms... This is bullsh*t. Ya’ll threw a fit when Fasnacht was delayed for a few days but you didn’t throw an even bigger fit and let them get away with basically taking away ways to get free atoms? Ridiculous...
---
That’s fair. I’d agree with that. 
---
I’m level 198, I’m not a new player but as I said I am a bloodied rifleman mainly now, my ammo consumption is low. So I can easily stay stocked for use and periodically add to the vendors.
---
If you wanted to spend your time using the new machine more, this appears to be lucrative for ammo sellers. 
---
I have a Gauss mini though, and I can absolutely agree that this machine will not in any way shape or form enable me to keep that thing stocked. I don’t think even the 5mm vampires mini I have will work with it either. 556 rifleman and 2mm EC Gauss rifle seems ok though 👍
---
While the interface is pretty annoying, the time constraint here and the limited amount of ammo able to be “converted” is actually a hint of realism to this process haha. It takes me several hours to hand load 100 rounds of ammo from start to finish.
---
Probably what happens when developers do UI.  Lol
---
You can repeat it as much as you like
---
They do this shit on purpose, why offer the capability if it will never be used because it takes a real day to complete any useful exchange????
---
Ah, I apologize my perspective was melee-based, I don't know how strong gun builds are right now but I assumed they were if anything more broken. And I think people are mainly complaining that the ammo converter conversion rates are insulting to anyone who actually loots normally.
---
Yep, this cements it. I'll end up playing the game less because of this. Less Atoms, rewards I won't use, the requirement of spending Atoms to get to max rank, it all stinks.
---
I've been logging in every day to do faction missions and daily/weekly challenges, but it just won't be as rewarding to do so going forward.
---
Oh well. I'll check it out when they release updates, but there's not much motivation other than that.
---
Bulk ammo... Why not this?
---
I also have a 100 tons of ammo and hoard it like a dragon. But this was meant to be a utility we would all appreciate. It wasn't, and was immediately apparent. The exchange rates are 1/5, the interface is trash and the amounts for ammo are stupid. 5mm only 50 ammo points less than .50 cal? Nobody that plays the game thinks like that, or the Gatling gun is fucking everything up for everyone with its bizarre 5mm chamber it never should've had
---
Yup it’s a new bug.
---
Meaning new to the underarmor.  Not even a day old.  
---
Endurance being broken on gear however is pushing 2 years old for a bug.
---
But they fixed hundreds of bugs with Wastelanders release.  Just not these bugs that everyone notices.
---
There was a fo4 mod for auto close doors because my stupid settlers were always letting deathclaws into my bases. I miss being able to rig a powered door to a siren and logic board to have my camp go into lockdown and shut all ingress points when it's attacked.
---
I accidentally put wallpaper on both sides of a wall from the metal building set last week.  Was that not supposed to happen?
---
The HUD stuff in the corner with your group bond, etc. it's huge
---
It does again.
---
You do not have to apply them first, you can apply shielded directly to an unmodded under armor.  Applying each in order is not required, and a waste of flux/ballistic fiber.  You just have to know the plans for lower levels to unlock the shielded plan.
---
Oh shit see I didn’t realize this was about a challenge. I haven’t been on today to see what’s with the update.
---
Don't count on a quick fix. The SS armor still doesn't have all the mods it should have and we're now at 2+ month since WL dropped.
---
The constant screw ups are just emberrassing.
---
Edit: Meant SS Armor, not the Underarmor.
---
I'm not feeling it, I play to wander,enjoy,kill things..being directed on "How To Play" just to get things is killing it for me. I didn't grind for Atoms, I'm not Grinding for score
---
I have no clue, its such a specific series of events. I wonder the same thing about those pixel perfect glitches people do on speedrunds.
---
Squatters were at Station Delta one time and someone launched a nuke there, rofl
---
Yep. Unless you want to spend 6 hours scrolling through a terminal just to turn your 140k unwanted ammo into about 5k of a type you'll actually use. Not only is it slow, but the returns are incredibly low
---
It’s the same amount of wood.  Scrapping bulked items counts for the ‘scrap’ challenges.  And Plastic easy to come by. 
---
However, this doesn’t work for Wood because those challenges say ‘Collect’ and not ‘Scrap’. While it will work for things like Aluminum Scrapping, it doesn’t work for any ‘Collect’ challenges.
---
Yeah it is. I think even if there are no more issues now for a longer time, I’m always going to be wary with vendors and similar stuff. I’ve played since launch and have been stung big time twice losing irreplaceable weapons (one legacy one rare drop). 
---
They still have a long way to go to ease that wound 😅
---
Super mutants are the only thing that have dropped them so far. Maybe because the floaters are sort of tied to them they're just included in their loot pool?
---
There are now two versions, one in the generator tab, and the original in the misc tab. I don't know if they cost different budget %s, but the resource costs are very different.
---
I am doing almost 300 per shot.  If you could convert too quickly everyone would too many rounds in seconds.
---
Or beserkers builds, since 10 Dr can easily be canceled by one addiction.
---
Speaking of testing - Part of the bugs in this system (and maybe the typos and balancing of the ammo converter) wouldn't make it to live if SCORE was on the PTS. I knew from the get go there'd be problems with this system because it wasn't on the PTS at all.
---
A quick check of my inventory told me that I'll be done converting all of that sometime around friday next week.
---
Scrapping that thing, even as a free item this is just insultingly bad.
---
Yeah I hear ya. I had already stopped playing once I finished my bullion grind, and I got great rolls on everything pretty fast. So no new content, just a season pass deal for cosmetics but I have to play nw to be a completist... Just isn't for me.
---
Interesting you say the route through the menu was saved - it wasnt for me. So its not menu lag, more that pressing the action key chooses the first thing on the list, which isnt so helpful if you're scraping something halfway down the list.
---
If I could just mash the action button it would be much less of an issue.
---
I'll do some further testing tomorrow - the UI at one point decided that in power armour when accessing the terminal, to not show the screen but instead make me crouch down and look at the stand instead.
---
imo a currency-like system would have been better, similar to scrip or gold bullions:
---
\- You interact with the machine
---
\- All the ammo on your inventory appears on the left tab
---
\- You choose which type you want to ''convert'' into points
---
\- You then pick which ammo type you want to buy with those same points on the right tab
---
But if they want to keep the terminal interface for some reason, maybe they could add a new optional ''Super Duper'' mode to the terminal that does exactly the same thing it does now, but in batches of 10x the amount, so for example instead of asking for 12 rounds and giving you 6(random numbers) it would ask for 120 and give you 60.
---
69 dude! The joke was obvious!
---
You already got thru the challenges to get the skin or you bought it off the atom shop?
---
Looks like the same system used to manufacture ammo in the ammo machines in your base in FO4
---
That doesn’t count as ‘collecting’. It will not advance your progress for either the ‘Collect 100 Wood’ weekly or the ‘Collect 7600 Wood’ in Survival. 
---
Those only count for ‘Scrapping’ like the Aluminum. 
---
And just FYI, I tested and confirmed this about five minutes ago.
---
Noticed this immediately lol
---
Exactly. They could've literally copied the scrip machine system and turned it into ammo. But they decided to use a terminal instead.
---
I was doing a quest for Rose and got a Charisma check I didn't have enough points to pass, but I'm quite obsessive about those little nuggets of information, so I exit the conversation, sign up to some random public team and equip the perk that gives you Charisma for every team mate. Worked like a charm.
---
Good catch, I hadn't noticed that they had two versions.
---
Lol.....you got downdooted(by a dev?).
---
Probably accidentally then when they realize they are invincible they test it to see if they can do it again
---
This should have been a Combat Rifle/ Fixer skin tbh. I have no clue why Handmade cause the AR and AK platform are entirely different tbh.
---
You get them just be keep playing nw so far I've gotten wreath presents the tree camos from the haloween event.
---
That's accurate.
---
I mean them selling a worse version of something you can get in game if you wanted it should be a good thing ya? Its not like its a big advantage, and its something people may like if they don't want to fuck with backpacks or whatever and can buy to support the game going forward. I'm not sure how its a bad thing.
---
Ok? Well OP was the first person to post in the sub about getting there...
---
Or here's a thought: why not just make it an unlockable function of the Tinkerers bench? There are probably all kinds of reasons why, but I'm just saying...
---
I honestly think they want us to suffer. There are people in the PTS who can and have fixed half of this shit, but they want none of it.
---
Which PA? Usually PA mods without PA set name are excavator mods. Mods are unique to their PA set. You can't use an excavator Emergency protocol (called Emergency Protocol) on a x-01 PA that require X-01 mods.
---
I was wondering this. Maybe it's a countdown to the end of the season?
---
Wait, I had no idea i wasn’t supposed to have that salute. I use it all the time. I don’t wanna go back to the wave
---
There was a time when I used to think it was preposterous that you could only craft 36 rounds at a time no matter how many materials you had, usually resulting in several minutes of clicking over and over.
---
And then they added this monstrosity....
---
I really detest these kinds of season passes, and I utterly detest NW as it's lackluster hide in a bush for the match hoping to not die to someone with good cards not to mention the exp rate is utterly appalling.
---
You cant longer leave a NW match as a team.. only alone :(
---
And the worst part is that you have to go back 10 00000 times to exit the terminal
---
I guess we need to wait and see
---
There is a lumber mill just south of Vault 76.  It has tons, a couple nodes and all the robots around there will give you their load of wood if you ask.
---
Shoulda just done it like the vending machines, really. It's what they use for scripping and bullion exchanges too, so I don't see why they couldn't do the same.
---
T51b PA and the mod says “blue headlamp mod for t-51b” so I’m confused as to why I can’t put it in my t-51
---
It only continues to work so long as nothing changes though, say for example you run out of that particular ammo the option removes itself so you’ll either be sent back to square one or accidentally sell or buy something you don’t want. Are you on PC? I still have my Xbox one copy gathering dust (it’s been kicked out of the living room by the wife 😂) so I may have a play. 
---
I did once or twice go too quickly and accidentally sell back some 2mm but I learned my lesson and have paid more attention since 😂
---
Really? Another issue no one on the PTS noticed?
---
How many screw ups do we actually need before we all realize that whatever is on the PTS is in no way what gets pushed on patch day?
---
Oh, and while I'm at it, for some reason the Decon Arch works only half the time now. No idea what's causing this but I had to relog twice to get rid of my rads again.
---
Just tested this too after reading, my adrenaline isn’t working either. LAME. Guess I’ll go find 3 other points to use in agility. Did always want to try mister sandman
---
Doesn't effect it. You have to click 100 wood piles. Better to fast travel to vault and run down hill to mill clicking every log you see.
---
I hate to tell you this, but you are not going to want to do it. It is a grind.
---
This makes the most sense.
---
LMAO
---
&gt;Should prevent any (logical) P2W arguments.  
---
*yongyea has entered the chat*
---
The bundle will most likely be back during a time when the icon isn’t free. Those people will be happy, I suppose.
---
Yes. So what if he was the first? Then it goes to show how quickly you can knock out today's score requirements. All things are pointing to your initial statement being moot. Why say "Ok?" in a dismissive tone when it's the pertinent information that proves your point wrong? Like, cmon dude. Just take the L.
---
Use a lunchbox when you unlock some, all will be revealed :)  
---
\*EDIT\* Unless you used one already, then check your status page. You get some special effect.
---
I still had my original one built, and checked to see if it was now generating power - it was not.
---
&gt;**All interfaces in Fallout 76 are** hot garbage
---
FTFY
---
Exactly. They could have just copied the scrip system like they did for bullion and it would've been much better
---
I just recieved presents and the bat paint are there any halloween camp stuff
---
Here is where my int comes from:
---
15 base int
---
15 from UNY
---
5 from major legendary effect (All UNY int armor)
---
8 from egg head mutation (Strange in Numbers gives it a boost)
---
5 from berry mentats (I have a crafting/farming route that lets me make enough to keep the buff up all the time).  
---
3 from casual underarmor
---
7.5 from scorchbeast brain (increased by carnivore which is increased by Strange in Numbers)
---
3 from the Night Person perk
---
4 from Building public teams
---
3 from Herd Mentality (this gives a +3 to all my specials, as  it is boosted by Strange In Numbers) 
---
There are few more int buffs out there, but these are the ones I can keep active most of the time. 
---
Cool everyone defending beth shady practices again. That icon will be free 10 times in the next year
---
My score would be nice....
---
Oh and I’ll second the PA bug I had something similar.
---
Fix?  It was not broken until the patch.  Somehow something they did messed up a random perk card.  How?!!? =)
---
Someone opened a Lunchbox near you and gave you the Confetti Mess perk.
---
That 100 per 10k is atrociously small.
---
Any pc players making macros i know I am.
---
Still found one post patch...
---
Shouldn't be having to pay a monthly/yearly fee to get lag free servers. And I say that as a fellow 1ster.
---
An update after playing a bit after the update:  you are also just flat out wrong.  The "gain 10,000 XP" challenge is repeatable and refreshes each time you complete it.  So you can grind that 100 SCORE points over and over all day if you want.  Similarly, you continue to get more SCORE points with each public event you complete.
---
You don't need talent for this, you just need competency.
---
Source: 20 years as a designer
---
Yes you are. You get the points at 3/5 complete for some reason.
---
It's not just this. There have been numerous additions to this game over its lifespan so far that are just like this. The feature is implemented and is instantly and UNANIMOUSLY derided by the playerbase. Basically anybody who has any understanding of the game mechanics and has played for more than a day.
---
Right!  OMG.  If that game had come out in the age of EQ we would have been like "This is an amazing UI."  But then you play games with a decent UI and you are like "Who approved this?!?!!?"
---
it's ratmonkeyeasysorting mod. it replaces strings the game uses, disable it til it gets an update
---
No unfortunately the rest is paint for skins, outfits, but for the survivor challenge one if you haven't got it you can get the antler chandelier as the 2nd or 3rd last challenge
---
 lmaooo i literally just saw that as a reward right now
---
I had the same issue and some very knowledgable friends of mine said it is bugged and gives points as 3/5 completion. Havent counted up yet but they typically know
---
Are you me? I finally started to build a house since I’ve been living like a vagrant since I got the game and was shocked that there aren’t any plain walls to decorate with. For the C.A.M.P. to be such an integral part of the game, it seems to be one of the most looked over parts of the game.
---
had them drop from SBQ and regular scorchbeasts too
---
find a noob and drop the gat plasma and the cores on them. You don't get your resources back but you do get the inventory space.
---
You forgot the must have mic. The rest checks out. 🤣
---
Thanks! I’m gonna hate not having that mod, but I guess I’ll just deal with it for now.
---
So its a bug that actually works in our favor?
---
Indeed. If they're not going to overhaul all of it, allowing people to spend as little time as possible battling with it would probably be best.
---
Yeah if only people would assess you on your ability to play. But that'd be asking too much... I dont give a solid fuck what gear you have- if you can play, or you're funny, then you're in!
---
Lol i left at the tedious scout exam shit for a bag pack. It really feels theyre trying to make the game annoying.
---
LOL...fact
---
They didn't put the season on the PTS because it's tied to the atom shop which isn't on the PTS for obvious reasons. Of the things that were on the PTS pretty much only the teams and bug fixes are live now, the rest got pushed to the next update because the PTS players found lots of problems with them.
---
Was there any doubt after the release day state of Evan?
---
Yup I guess it’s Christmas for Bethesda
---
That's what I imagine lol
---
Wait does the adventure xp earned from nuclear winter not count for the 10k xp challenge?
---
I'm funny looking. does that count?
---
I can tell from the screenshot that I hate all of this already and I haven’t even finished the download yet... Can’t believe they took away daily and weekly atoms for this shite. 
---
And to top it all off there’s a nuclear winter challenge too, if I miss the nuclear winter or level up daily does that just mean I can’t get all the rewards from the season? This mean I have to play their sh*tty Battle Royal mode just to finish the season? I’m not even sure if this 11gb update is going to finish in one day because of how shite my internet is, does missing a few days of challenges mean I miss out on the final rewards of the season? 
---
Or can we earn more of these points than what the season requires so missing a few doesn’t automatically mean you can’t get the last few items of the season?
---
Just buy some atoms! Todd Howard
---
Please make a statement about the ammo machine ASAP.  Nobody like that.
---
None of the +END food or gear has ever given hp. It's been broken since FO4.
---
Class freak can counter str reduction in mutations
---
Weight perks and food.  Otherwise you’re looking at backpacks
---
I read that as BSG and was like damn this man is so used to hating on Tarkov he forgot what he was posting on. Acronyms are fun.
---
And if you're an antisocial player with Fallout First you can go on a private server and turn off letting people join and then put on a public team and get the bonus plus complete the challenges. Win win.
---
Yeah, but I'm completing them anyway in case it messes something up when they refresh.
---
No, you're definitely wrong.
---
Went to Solomon's pond for the behemoth to see if they finally fixed the bullshit "magic" weapon term everyone has been throwing around on here.  Still not really sure because I  wasted 100 5mm and 45 seconds shooting him in the back of the head before he finally woke up and started taking damage.  
---
10/10. Awesome update!
---
Thank you. A bug that is on our side huh? Nice 😂😂😂
---
Even if this is fixed, and you don’t want to be social...I’m a very solo player and tonight I’ve pretty much constantly been in a public team. 
---
Can confirm my team based challenges are all completing and I never realised how much I was missing out with perk sharing 😅
---
At one point I plugged my mic in to see if anyone would share glow sights and they did 😍. I’ve spoken to more people tonight than in a long while and I’m a proper unsociable bastard.
---
Sylvia &amp; sons and Helvetia are both good options for this.
---
Defiantly not Todd. he would at least tried it twice, ask someone to port Skyrim to it, and then try it again before having the QA team test it and question his method of madness
---
The Red Rocket cooler is a nice cosmetic though. Obviously I don't store anything in it because I have Thru Hiker and a Fridge Backpack.
---
- The TEAM UP emote has been removed 
---
- Eating food randomly kills your toon
---
Thanks man, I was getting seriously aggro 😂😂😂
---
yeah don't know how I functioned w/o it before.
---
hope it gets updated real quick
---
If you or someone opened a lunchbox every mod will explode into confetti after killing it
---
Can you set the team to invite only so no one else joins?
---
Yeah see my current character is 181 Heavy weapons. If I wander away from my camp for 10 minutes, the raider ammo machine has made 500rnds. If I craft 5mm I get 180 per craft. If I go through lucky hole/westtek i can craft literally thousands of rounds - I top up my 5mm and .50 when I drop below 20,000 rnds.
---
So this machine is literally more long winded than crafting my own ammo.
---
I'm not hugely upset (its not like I grinded for it), just obviously a lot of people were looking forward to this. I think I got more use out of the lunch box, and that was just a fun throw away bonus (note: the lunch box bonus is different for each player)
---
Dang j figured there might be more. Rn running steong back and bandolier in strength for item weight reduction. Is steong back not as good as others? Im a heavy weapons build rn. Also is there a perk for supressing negative addiction affects?
---
You’re missing trapper from this list too.
---
I love armor paint.  One more thing to make it harder to accidentally sell or scrip it.
---
You are really making a huge deal out of a simple joke...
---
That’s why I called it a “humble brag”. A subtle way of saying “hey look what I am the first person to do”
---
It was a joke... calm down. You aren’t proving my joke “wrong”. Lol.
---
The issue is that even if you do **every single daily and weekly challenge** you still won't earn enough score to get to rank 100. They're basically making it a requirement to spend Atoms to reach max rank, even if you did every single challenge for 70 days straight. 
---
99% of players won't be able to do that, and there will be blowback because of it.
---
I developed a tick like that from selling items on Tarkov. It literally always selects the wrong item and sometimes doesn't reselect on your first click. I hate that it seems like most games set you up to accidentally sell or destroy your good items.
---
I started to find odd weapons for the extra ammo I found.except explosives.10mm smg or b 10.m pistol a .38 receiver on a quad fixer is a ton of fun.
---
Which mods are missing for the SS underarmor?
---
Level 1s only so I can get all the kills, loot and xp.
---
And I 'promise' not to grief...
---
Lol I bet
---
That's a really good point, and would be a good addition. People asking for help when they've hit a bit of a difficulty spike (I've had a couple of quests when I considered looking for assistance) could be a valuable use of the public teams feature.
---
The raider machine really that useful/worth the gold in your opinion? 
---
I’ve unlocked it but I’m spending gold elsewhere at the moment putting my Gauss mini and SS pieces together
---
I'm still not sure why this didn't just become an option on the tinker's bench. Scrap ammo. Make ammo. All in one bench. But this is cool too I guess.
---
Yes, just scrap the ammo into gun powder, lead and steel. Or let us sell the ammo to the venders. This thing is horrible.
---
Have you gotten this achievement? I’m just wondering how much you need to build at the workshop to get it
---
That lumber yard has never been emptier then today lol poor trees.
---
100%.
---
Those never last long.
---
Don’t take them haha.  For heavy I would suggest mentats, daddyo booze day tripper and psycho.
---
Bear arms is a must as is 15 str imho.  Deep pockets on gear if you don’t go for ultra light.  Batteries not inc if you use energy based heavy weapons.
---
just hit Esc if you're on PC
---
It’s doable for a week span of time. The forest is chock full of the stuff
---
Maybe you can just smack the side of the terminal and it unlocks.
---
You don't HAVE to. There are more than 5 options, so just pick another 5. (Actually only 3 as the SCORE seems to be awarded at 3/5)
---
I see what ur saying the endurance is null on weapons and armor, what about food?
---
Resistance to disease from toxic water or air. Also no, vs most other legendary stars it's not worth it.
---
Oh
---
I'm sorry, I meant the normal SS armor. The legs and arms still don't have all the mods. Torso seems to have them all, though.
---
Has that been calculated? 
---
I'm not trying to argue just haven't seen that yet.
---
If thats the case that's really shitty.
---
On the game board, there's a orange little rocket ship that is you, and waaaay ahead of you is a green ship that is Dr. Zorbo. Yeah, it's just a countdown to the end of the event.
---
Well then, i commend your dedication to xp then. But i got one more question...
---
Do you even lift bro? Lol like what kinda dmg can u even squeeze out from a build like that?
---
After you get all rewards does the reward from challenges change from score to atoms?
---
Super clunky and conversion rates are shocking I think I'll be scrapping and continue to throw away the the trash ammo
---
Yup, it’s a mandatory perk for PvE. I like to keep track of the effects in my pipboy and I noticed adrenaline wasn’t showing up at all.
---
Sbq drops it. Also lvl 65 scorchbeasts can as well with a lower chance.
---
I'm guessing like the ammo converter it will also have a terminal for each exercise...
---
They drop from the SBQ randomly and also I’ve killed a few normal scorchbeasts that dropped prime weapon plans. I might have the prime LMG plans in my vendor if your on xbox.
---
So I need to press enter 166 times to sell 1k .38 ammo and 332 times to buy 1k 5.56 ammo. Still sounds like a sick experiment from Vault-Tec to me.
---
Excavator should give 200 carry weight and the others should give 100
---
There was a theory on the official forums that this was done on purpose to help avoid duping glitches and whatnot, which may be plausible.
---
Much of the player base already has probably way too much ammo anyway. Fire away
---
I have a TON of ultracite ammo I’d be willing to convert into other non ultracite ammo, but it won’t even let me do that. Now most of my ammo is useless
---
They just added an invisible paywall, best rewards will be always where you need to spend atoms to go, and we have a bunch of, terrible, low tier rewards to keep people playing. And next "seasons" will be even worst I think
---
It doesnt make 2mm, so that will probably affect your descision.
---
The speed it churns rounds out is based on the ammo. So it crafts lots of 5mm, not so fast on the 5.56
---
If you want to "try before you buy" it's literally the same machine as the ammo workshop up north (albeit a lot more compact) - take that workshop, set it to your chosen ammo and see if it make it at a satisfactory rate.
---
The "wander away for 10 minutes" is slight hyperbole - suffice to say whenever I go back to my camp theres several hundred rounds waiting.
---
what platform are you on? I see people in big events all the time
---
Kill lots of Queens
---
Yeah. It's pretty weird. On the one that it occurs with, we do have a surround sound system whereas the S model is just through the television. That might make some difference.
---
So... You're saying it's not going to destroy the ammo economy for player vending?
---
Have you seen the live streams??? Shit Show Supreme
---
No it does seem to be worse 😕
---
[Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hit17g/score_earnings_review_and_screenshots_of/fwiq3ra/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hivznv/some_liberally_assumption_based_math_on_season/) is what I've seen people come up with. It seems pretty awful, but unfortunately everyone is too busy hating on the Ammo Converter to notice how terrible the season progression is.
---
did you down vote me?
---
How the hell did you earn 800 atoms a week only logging in 2 or 3 days?  That's not possible.  Previously if you did every weekly that's about 250 or so, and every daily each day would be maybe another 350 or 450 total.  So MAX would be 600 or 700 per week, doing every single challenge available.  Explain how you got 800 per week 'usually' plz thx
---
My goodness. F76 at one time was my favorite game. When I start to compare to other games the issues sure do shine through. It's still a good game but my goodness the grind to do some of the most simple tasks gets tiresome. Bethesda needs to make some quality of life improvements.
---
Glow sights don't do anything
---
Standard sights and Glow sights are completely misaligned from where the bullets actually impact. I assume this is because it is sighted with the default handmade sight and this skin's sight is slightly taller.  
---
Id understand if this was some modder but c'mon, an Atom Store purchase?!
---
Not allowing me to on xbox either.
---
Valid point, but the case stands, it could be done way better, i mean even crafting ammo on bench easier, i already do convert my fusion cores to ultracite cores. Only 3 at the time with ammosmith, superduper for a double chance, but i do it instantly, click, done. 
---
I know i am no expert, but this could imo be the same mechanic. Takes x amount of this ammo, converts to y amount of other ammo. One click, one batch. Instant, simple. Instead we got what? 4 clicks per small batch? Yea, some people will deal with that, others will keep crafting. There are already many people on the sub saying its not worth the hustle in the long run, but i guess its nice we got an option at all.
---
[Only one thing left to say](https://youtu.be/4dYLtGnKLIs)

I hate this one. Makes the chem\food backpacks useless. But hey at least we can use those wasted adrenaline points to run through hiker full-time🤦‍♂️
---
Can confirm. Events has been crazy. Almost so crazy I’m considering jumping into private world lol. 
---
But I’m glad to see this!
---
(PS4 btw)
---
Marsupial mutation gives +20 carry weight and super jump at the expense of INT.
---
Yeah it suuuuuucks without it.
---
SS Armor doesn’t have deep pocketed mods, not a fan of the gauss weapons and how heavy the ammo is, I haven’t even started the wastelanders quest line yet but so far most of these gold bullion rewards don’t seem that appealing. (Except for the stealth suit, the well, and the ammo thing from the raiders. Everything else is really meh unless those stupid fertilizer grenades from the settlers also work on flux in nuke zones. Something tells me they won’t though.)
---
Yup have all mutations aside from ones that conflict
---
It seems like just launch more nukes and take part in more SBQ battles, sounds good.
---
I'm switching to a heavy weapon build, and someone gave me the advice to use ultricite .308 ammo since it's stronger. I'm already switching to a light machine gun build, so it sounds like this will have to be step 2 after that.
---
ITS RAINING (scorched) MEN!
---
Do you have mods installed?
---
Interesting. Im going to check more tomorrow as the UI was bugging out all over today, but may be I missed that.
---
I’ve never seen that before, did you still complete it?
---
you ought to..
---
A sub menu in the challenge tells you the requirements, like build 20 lights, and build 10 water pumps.   
---
I completed this challenge today using the Dabney Farm workshop.
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar.
---
Most of this is actually free through the game board. I’m sure some of it will be atom shop, but a good bit is available in game now
---
That happened once to me after update 19, good times!
---
What? Is this a fever dream?
---
I am having the same problem. Can someone on Xbox open the elevator for me?
---
Very true.  Think I will take your advice myself. Boom!!
---
Oh I didn’t notice that, thanks a lot mate
---
I didn't think Fallout 76 was optimized for multi monitor use.
---
I'm also wondering this since I have three of them in my stash right now.
---
yeah, I built a new one and it spins
---
Wow it's almost as if the game had a drought of content which lead to people taking a break, and then suddenly a big update brought back a lot of people who want to check out new stuff. Imagine that.
---
There is a glitch where a well placed survival tent can force the Scorched to drop directly in front of the terminal making them easy prey.
---
It’s funny because I came on here after trying it out to see what people were saying about it. I’m just really upset that the machine next to it serves no purpose other than an animation. I would’ve thought that you put the ammo to be converted into the computer and then back out and spin the machine.
---
Yes. You place your fallout first tent in a specific spot and it causes it. Pretty hilarious and seems to be at least prolonged farm if not endless if you don’t move it at the end.
---
I did it few days ago and the last wave indicator just stopped, and spawned another ten loads of enemies. I moved the tent and it completed. 
---
I know it’s a glitch of sorts but it was hilarious seeing the level 70 odd who was the only one there when I arrived wonder wtf was going on and panic 😁
---
I completed two weekly challenges but didn’t get the score points. Do we have to wait until the end of the week to collect?
---
Ah, thanks for clearing this up for me.
---
Mods. Either turn on Nuclear Winter mode of you’re using the mod manager, or disable them manually if not.
---
My guess is well, is that it’s just a way of saying “get to 100 before it ends”
---
Some weeklies provided reward on step 3 out of 5, check the level you have at the end
---
Most of those pictures looked like they’re showcasing stuff in the atomic shop though don’t they? They have that kinda air to them.
---
It will likely do the same thing it does in fallout 4, which is a temp strength bonus.
---
pfft talking sense.. GTFO with that shit
---
Any INT or leadership bobs that affect that?
---
3 and 13 confirmed
---
I’ve come across the below, not all new, some were in patch 19 and before. 
---
Can confirm the camp issue, the workbenches in my garage were clipped into the wall and the gaps in the wallpaper are much bigger, seems to have solved and hasn’t come back after moving/rebuilding and re logging. I’ve also had foliage clipping through floors on first log but again replacing them solves this. 
---
Can anyone confirm that the correct bonuses are applying to legendary kills in the hunted groups? Didn’t seem to be for me but I haven’t dived into the numbers yet. I may have been overestimating their original values. Event bonuses in the event group seem ok. 
---
I’ll also say I’ve had more issues with the fast travel bug than I usually do but that could well be me travelling more to find robots/enemies to finish challenges with. Bug is still present regardless. 
---
I’m actually liking the ammo converter but there’s an odd UI glitch when you use PA making it useless in PA.
---
And the respawn glitch if you happen to be downed when an event finishes is still there however tonight I literally had to CTD via windows sign out, couldn’t even open task manager. That ended my play session. 
---
The game board UI sometimes keeps the mouse on the screen after going back to gameplay which appears to somewhat impact FPS and input Lag on PC
---
Tried multiple times to log into nuclear winter to no avail, not sure if this is just heavy load and longer queues or a bug. 
---
Other than this generally my game is actually running smoother. Caveat being I’ve reversed an overclock since I last played so this may be due to this.
---
It's insane that they thought that 12-15 ammo at a time would be a good idea. Like, have they ever actually played the fucking game??
---
&gt; Do you seriously think they didn’t know what they were doing? 
---
Based on their UX quality in general? Umm... Yeah. Either that, or they're deliberate sadists (and still lousy at UX).
---
Or 69
---
Well, I guess I lasted 5 minutes with it and scrapped it. I'm not saying people can't enjoy it or use it, but it certainly had a bit of an undesired effect, on me at least :(
---
What if I use poorly timed soundboard memes that aren’t funny until a minute or two later?
---
Removed rule 6 I guess??.
---
I guarantee you I give out more rounds of useful ammunition casually in a single play session than you will ever be able to earn in equal hours spent JUST clicking through those gross terminal menus converting your own.
---
People chomping at the bit for new content who have hundreds of thousands of spare rounds (me), dont need a way to convert 1% of them hundreds of times impossibly slowly. 
---
The real mindfuck is that this is likely intended to be slow and useless on purpose because the business major they have running the economy calculating revenue per frustrating click probably made them.
---
Or 420
---
pretty fly, for a flight guy
---
Thanks for the tip!  I will be looking for that setting, to turn it off, as soon as I log on this evening.  :)
---
There's another sorting mod that just got updated. Solved the " Lookup Failed" messages. Starts with Ly
---
also at the ATLAS, in the tent legit juuuuust outside of it, there's a letter on a shelf near the entrance of it (just inside of it) that an NPC explains that he sealed up the place to "prepare it" or w/e
---
Yeah it’s like being excited about them adding rear view mirrors on a car but they put them down in front of the tires.
---
Thanks I guess
---
Pretty sure this is cuz it does the old school over 100 bug to -255. It doesn't always happen, but a easy "fix" is getting one shot out of vats
---
Fucking clown developers
---
I haven’t even finished the download for the update yet but I hate everything about this already... Can’t believe they took away our free atoms for this shite...
---
Oh, for sure. A good chunk are free, though. The planetarium and wallpapers, the fireplace door, the sheepsquatch plushie, one of the captain cosmos costumes (minimum. The end prize of this season is a C. Cosmos bundle), and all of the loot crates are on the seasons game board now! I’ve gotten a few prizes already, can’t wait for the wallpapers
---
There is something very wrong with the quality control and acceptance for what is "good enough" at Bethesda. 
---
It has been this way since launch, and even back in Fallout 4 and previous games. 
---
The bar is set WAY TOO LOW for what is considered "good enough" to ship or ignore. There are so many bugs and v0.1 game systems left in the game for a mind mindbogglingly long time OR NEVER FIXED AT ALL. 
---
They need to focus on and revamp so many of the systems in the game if they really want to grow the playerbase and be able to build new things on a solid foundation.
---
Not to mention it takes like 50-60 different screens just to scrap down a few hundred bullets
---
Had the same thing happen, grenade rain fallowed
---
The exp amount you gain for your character is the amount of points counting towards the challenge.. Sooo every bit of INT or bonus exp helps if that was your question.
---
Are you actually playing or just dying instantly?
---
I plan on using atoms to cover my deficit towards the end. It’s summer time, too much to do outside, and I won’t be playing much. I’m following to hear what others thoughts are too
---
I mean, its a good skin but hoooly fuck did they absolutely massacre the output.
---
Another thing you can do is build them in a little alcove, so they are outside but you just have to put a couple of walls up to shut them off.
---
I’ve had this as well. I think this is a Ui issue rather than a quest bug as I often found that the count in my head was far ahead of what the game thought I was at, it seems very lagged. 
---
I also noticed this in quests, most notably the bot stop, and mothman ones where the kill remaining enemies and fill the lantern counters would suddenly just jump or lag behind.
---
Another wildcard is how many public events you do. According to the information page on Seasons they are supposed to give SCORE, but don't seem to do that at the moment. Of course, this is irrelevant if they don't fix it until the season ends or if their info page is incorrect and they are not supposed to give SCORE.
---
Indeed
---
No, that would require effort
---
Confirmed this doesn't affect PS4, been only scrapping all and got the reward, ironically it gave me the Scrapbox thing (think it's second SCORE Reward).
---
Nope. At least not that I've found. It doesnt even show up as a challenge whilst in NW.
---
Also if you go to the lumber yard (near sons of Dane compund) you can pick up loads of wood (150+) if I remember
---
Probably so they can sell Raiders and Responders skins for it later.
---
Close to center is best IMO. More traffic means more sales and less inventory weight.
---
Jeez, how is this disappointing? You have an outfit, backpack, helmets, an icon, emote, weapon skin, hats and a pip-boy skin. What would it take for people like you to be satisfied? Seriously, I'm really curious as to what would get the tick of approval from you.
---
Just hopped on and tried this and it's a LOT better.  Thanks a lot for the tip.
---
But it's not that T-51b it's that other T-51b, the one over there on Todd's desk.
---
I have a melee version of the spec and a range versions, I am currently in the range version.
---
Here are my weapons, keep in mind that this is without chem buffs and without full adrenaline.
---
For the melee: (This is when I am in my Melee int build)
---
[https://ibb.co/92tQ5PK](https://ibb.co/92tQ5PK)
---
For the Range (This is when I am in my Range it build, they are two different builds)
---
[https://ibb.co/0t7Nd4g](https://ibb.co/0t7Nd4g)
---
My range build could actually do nearly full-on stealth commando if I had the gun for it. Now it does take some work to get to that int, and you are not as tanky as a non-int build, but the damage is almost as good and more than enough for the game content.
---
[Twin Lakes](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Twin_Lakes?file=F76_Twin_Lakes.png)might fit the bill?
---
Remember the table from the bar set? Yup, that round table was already in the game just without the small golden details. But literally the same table
---
Have you checked the atomic shop to see if the emotes are still there but unequipped?
---
The wood piles outside a house in Helvatia is a good place as well
---
No worries, happy trails and be safe out in the wasteland fellow vault dweller.
---
Getting to lvl 100 seems like it'll be a hell of a grind, that said there does seem to be some cool stuff
---
FYI. It was because of power armor. Cannot be in power armor and use it. Cause Bethesda.
---
I placed it, saw how it worked, and then I scrapped it immediately.
---
Came to see if anyone thought it was good. Just to view the hate I'm sad now
---
𝒮𝑒𝒶𝓈𝑜𝓃𝓈
---
I can confirm this also works on console as well.
---
Should have been a standalone weapon, with its own animation. A bullion reward, craftable as a random legendary, damage could have been somewhere between the assault rifle and combat rifle.
---
Such a waste.
---
Me too, I really only want the Appalachian Thunder Stick skin for my JE Gatling, but it’s way towards the end.
---
meh.. WGAS
---
we were done in here anyway
---
Happened to me too after update.
---
That glitch(?) gave the event just the right amount of high energy, i enjoyed it.
---
The only problem - hauling all that loot back to my camp. 1200 pounds of weapons and junk. Still, totally worth it.
---
Just throwing it out there, that I have NO idea how to pronounce her name. I've taken to calling her Commander Daiquiri. Please don't correct me, she and I both prefer it this way.
---
Ooh yes it is. Also if you need acid and you have the honey hats key you can pick up loads of honeycomb from in there and scrap it for acid I think each one gives you 3 waste acid skmething like that
---
I knew it, I bet his headlamp has 16x the detail compared to mine.
---
I’m not even playing NW but have an upvote cause it makes total sense for you guys.
---
Weird it wasn’t implemented from today’s patch
---
I thought getting all the SS armor and siding with the allies was gonna be a grind to but even that was done pretty fast. I’ll jump on and play a little when the weather is bad
---
Yeah, it's not in the atom shop.
---
Its definitely bought the game more to life for sure, the public teams is a good idea too I think
---
I’ll check it out thanks I just need to figure out what side of the lake I want it on
---
Also fine on PS4. 
---
What platform?
---
How many levels do you think 25k atoms get me
---
the amounts not the problem, it's having to click 100 of the wood piles.
---
I heard that as well. I’m anxious to check it out
---
There is no Bethesda, only Vault-Tec!
---
Full bonded team is actually OP then? 
---
Upvotes for visibility
---
“LF5M For Crota’s end must have 500+ Clears and Gjallarhorn, I’ll be checking stats.”
---
I'm at level 10 with doing nuclear winter so that's what a days worth and a week
---
True, but that shouldn't be too hard
---
Now entering the ammo converter is trash era
---
Does anyone know why the bond doesn't work for some of us?
---
Yes. It's in the patch notes.
---
I mean, we've known this for a long time. A skin for the alien blaster despite it being both severely bugged AND laughably bad? The burrows being a supposed tough challenge for a team of 50+ players? Don't forget that update that ROLLED BACK THE PREVIOUS ONE and raised bobby pin weight back to .1 each, something that literally anybody who plays the game would have noticed within 10 minutes of testing. What about the stats on some of those legendary survival mode rewards we used to have? I bet you'd all kill for a nocturnal assault rifle or suppressor's baton. Technically this isn't in the game yet so maybe I don't have the right to bring it up, but let's face it they won't change it from the PTS lmao...one of the cursed rewards from the new event is going to be a FASTER FIRE RATE HARPOON GUN. And no, it's not quad
---
Honestly, I like it overall.  
---
The weeklies clearing at 3 rather than 5 is a little odd but whatever. The Ammo Converter is fine to me and pretty much exactly what I expected. I feel like a damage calculation has shifted somewhere though, as my .50 Cal seems to be doing oddly static damage across the board while my Gauss Minigun seems to actually be doing a bit more.  
---
I dunno, 6.5/10, a fine enough "booster" patch, as it were.  
---
I do wanna know what happens if we pass Zorbo, or whatever his name is, on the board.
---
Seemingly yeah. I had a 4 person events team. RR came up, so I went there.
---
No one else. Wait 2 mins. Still no-one.
---
Remember I can use the "come here" emote, and the people on my team will see it.
---
Use "come here" emote.
---
Bam, suddenly there's 4 of us here.
---
Now obviously it depends who they are as to how successful you'll be, but at the least you have 3 people who've claimed they're interested in events, and a way of beckoning them to the event you've gone to.
---
Yeah its good fun, loads more people at events now. If you join an events team you can get up to 100% bonus xp per event
---
Probably, lol.
---
Shit, I thought it was the game role-playing your character tripping.
---
IIRC, you can’t use atoms until near the end of the event, but I think they’re 150/each. 150x100 is 15,000. So, ALL the levels.
---
Do the high levels still one shot everything
---
Isn’t it beeswax that gives acid?
---
Honestly with the whole premise of creating a base currency that Wastelanders established, I see no reason why we shouldn't get a bank/Grand Exchange-type place.
---
I used it religiously in FO4 but it took me so longer to find the combat pieces I’m using I think I’d jack the game in if I had to do it again for Marine. 
---
I think the extra rads might come in handy for bloodied? But since the Chinese stealth suit I don’t really see the need.
---
So far events have been more active because of teams and the nice bonuses you can get but there's  numerous bugs that I've encountered weekly challenges not completing,  adrenaline not working and a positive bug, food got a buff like Yao guai getting a 20% melee damage rather than the 10% you get so far im enjoying it but also not because some of the challenges not completing
---
Nice. I’ve been looking to get rid of these dang things. Have had em for way too long
---
Sweet, can you explain the exact buttons to press on your platform?  I'll update the op
---
PC here.
---
I feel the same. I knew the ammo convertor wasn't gonna be amazing, but honestly its ok. A good way for me to get rid of my .38 and grenade rounds, its gonna take a few days to do it but, meh I dont mind
---
I don't know what to think about Bethesda charging 50% more per rank than Destiny 2 does for its season pass ranks. That takes some stones, considering the content differential. But the pass is entirely free so...?
---
Theres a public team that gives charisma as its bonus, so you can have even more charisma for those harder skill checks/better prices.
---
If you want a harder game experience it's totally under your control.
---
Actually playing
---
Explosive rounds pay out better than ballistic.
---
Thats the one! Sorry its late and I'm tired, regardless it works well for that
---
Let's be honest, checking if they entered something of type "int" between the ranges of 1 to "amount\_player\_has" would not be that difficult. Escape sequences aside, there's are a lot of simple things they can do to negate them.
---
It's in Energy ammo, for some reason called 10mm, but actually gives Flamer Fuel, 100 points for 20 fuel
---
Some odd things, some new ones and more bugs as usual.
---
* Workshops now show up as locations on map. Not showing resources
---
* Ammo converter is kinda crap.
---
* Not really a fan of not earning atoms directly anymore, Bethesda want us to spend money it seems. (there are some atoms on the board though.)
---
* 2 of the weekly challenges bugged. Especially the robot one does not give points.
---
* Servers a bit more unstable but it runs a little bit better? (speculation!)
---
* Why do we always have to find chewing gum?!!...
---
Have you tried installing it even tho it's greyed out? 
---
Seen this happens but the mod can still be installed. Also not sure but I think they must be in your personal inventory
---
It actually makes me appreciate the quirks that many isometric RPGs have in relation to inventory slots, where you often are not even allowed to sell anything you have equipped
---
The Colossus rug and plushie are now in the camp items so much be coming soon.
---
Just hold B(Circle) to instantly back out of any terminal...
---
Little trick I found to speed up the conversion is after buying or selling ammo, hit tab to return too the previous page. This cuts out the part of returning to the main menu. You can also tap the screen once to instantly load the contents of the terminal faster. It isn’t great but at least it’s a faster way to convert ammo.
---
[Might have to build upward if you cant find enough flat ground!](https://i.imgur.com/mXBDILR.png)
---
Honestly, not that I've noticed, it could be more so on other servers
---
I didn’t even know this existed. 
---
I use the CSS helmet with it, looks pretty cool.
---
You’re a FO 1st member? I’m too cheap to pay $8-10 bucks/month.
---
Hold circle to back completely out.
---
I tried everything, I took it out of my stash into my inventory and it still won’t work. Beyond annoying
---
Yes you are right, I misspoke about applying them first, they only need to be learned. But on the SS I did not need to learn the lower level plans. Went straight to shielded.
---
Lol, I know - and she does have a sister but she games with her guy too 😂
---
They're legit compalints...
---
Haha I've not even unlocked it yet but I used at someones camp and knew straight away there would be complaints
---
Maybe u where at the wrong one there are several , some are inaccessible
---
Honest question. This is like 4 seasons a year right. So maybe I don’t wanna blow them all on just one season right.
---
I’m pretty sure Bethesda said the option to rank up by using Atoms would not be in effect for the first two weeks of the season, but will be available after the first two weeks is over.
---
Well, that does kind of suck, but they don't mention how easy it is to gain 10k xp in this game. Max level muties are over 200xp, and if you factor in any bonuses, especially the lunch boxes that give you 25% more... well. That can add up a bunch.
---
Seems shitty, but I'll hold my thoughts for a few weeks to see how it goes cuz this week was super easy to complete the weeklies.
---
Hmmm. Very strange.
---
Hey dude it's me I'm the guy from Xbox. Jameswkelly
---
I'll take all of this over pretentiousness. Yall know what I mean :)
---
Pls tell me how the hell you push 1.8k melee with 13STG??? Before buffs none the less? What is your special base stg. Im not buyin it
---
I wish I would have realized it was "Pick 100 Wood piles" instead of "Gather 100 Wood" when I started. I tossed on Woodchucker and was running around like an idiot knowing that I had reached 100 wood but not knowing why it hadn't triggered \*Sigh\*
---
Hmm maybe. I’m just certain I checked every single one. And even found the waypoint on the correct one. 
---
But they were actually guarded by blood eagles now. So maybe there’s something about that
---
White springs gets nuked often so be careful.
---
I only got it before wastelanders. Kinda wish I wouldn’t have but no turning back. I haven’t spent an atom since the game came out even before FO1st
---
Gnomes give concrete and there's lots of bags on top of the monorail lift, skip the wood one.
---
Absolutely! I'd envisioned something like a coinstar machine - you dump in your jars of pennies (or 10mm ammo) and get a receipt that can be used for purchases. Instead it took me 15 minutes to exchange the ammo I'd accumulated in three hours of playtime, and I still had a bunch under the trade-in threshold stuck in my inventory.
---
If your on Xbox I can see if I have a modded helmet etc.
---
No, it doesn’t. The challenge is ‘collect’. Not ‘scrap’. 
---
I tested it twice now for both the weekly and the social. The Collect Count didn’t move from scrapping things for wood, including Bulk Wood.
---
Haha I was lucky and had some left over in my vendor (perhaps under it?!)
---
I know what yoy mean about Bethesda wanting us to spend more money, but honestly I dont mind paying for 1st the scrapbox really is a life saver and the 1200 atoms is also a nice thing
---
Good to know thank you
---
Once unlocked, can any of your 5 characters put the converter down in their camp or just the 1 who unlocked it?
---
everyone gets all season 1 rewards at the end of the season regardless of how for you progressed sounds like a good place to start..
---
I’m building a dock, and it’ll be high up so it’s not interfering with anything
---
I was so excited to finally get rid of flares,syringes, and railway spikes but it took 10 mins just to get rid of them and then you redeem all 2000 of your points for less than  100 2mm E Cartridges no thanks
---
Also it’s broken when you use it while in power armor.
---
They took the majority of our atoms we could earn and "gave" us a bunch of garbage
---
48880142
---
Then they changed it in todays patch since i got it for a friend a few weeks back
---
They'd fire him in a week
---
Instant please!
---
If it was hard before to get a hit on one of the legendary mole miners in Uranium fever, then now it is impossible when there are +10 people doing the event! 😁
---
The one with blood eagles doesn't have paint in it, that one is between the two Nuka ones.
---
It's Gourd Growing Time.
---
(These Turbo-Ferts are handy as fuck!)
---
No that is a different spec. I have two int builds that can get the same int, one is melee and the other is range. I am currently in the range build. My melee int uses a base 15 str.
---
Sophia's quest is still super bugged though sadly. Havent gotten legendary weapon or armour roll from her in a very long time
---
I’m not exactly sure how it’s going to work out. Get as many free ones as you can.

They give 25% bonus XP and random buff, well fed may be one
---
I will have to look again. Thanks
---
Facts...disappointed to say the least
---
I noticed that tonight actually which is frustrating, but other than that it doesn't seem too bad. Fps drops are annoying though, did you find that or was it just my Internet?
---
People have always been able to buy from unplugged vendor machines. You have to have no items assigned to them for them to truly not work :(
---
Np!
---
Imma have to go check again I think. 
---
All the power does it take it off the map as a marker they can still buy from vendors if they are out it just won't show an icon on the world map but if they stumble across it they can still buy from it
---
Power to vendors only makes them appear on the map
---
People don't care and I don't care to stop them.
---
This what we have been doing, problem is, the problem is recurring and noobs aren't.
---
Same on PC
---
I mean if you really wanted to complain about icons you could argue the Pride month ones which, as stated, are free all year round, but during that month were our only free items
---
It's a bit of a pain, but now we have something we've been asking for since launch, and now it's shit because it doesn't work the exact way you want? Give it time, I'm sure they'll see the reaction and change it.
---
I think there's a "Blood Eagle" Skin that's through SCORE at rank 79 but not the "Screaming Eagle"...?
---
Maybe a Yt vid to follow the way helps sometimes
---
Hopefully they'll add more things to make it easier to rank up, but we'll just have to see how things go.
---
I’ve only bought a couple things here and there. I have just over 5k, thought I was a baller until you showed up with 25k. Now I’m suffering from A.T.O.M. envy.
---
I believe it’s all characters. It’s tied to your account.
---
Yeah i had the same experience. Took WAY to long to get through about 3k rounds of .38 i had in my stash. 
---
I mean the good thing i guess is that its no longer in my stash. But to only be able to do such a small stack at a time? Youd figure Bethesda wouldve thought about the fact that some folks have litterally thousands of rounds of certain ammunition.
---
Pepperoni rolls can help, recipe is 100 caps. Gulper innards, Brahmin milk, pepper and razorgrain are easy to get. At the moment it gives +75 carry weight according to the stat screen.
---
What? You don't need to give it a few minutes, it's an immediate problem...
---
Same. 
---
I mean what? I'm sorry. I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Yea, this is specifically for folks wanting to get the gather x100 for the weekly challenge 😉
---
Join an events team with a bunch of low to mid level players and then plop your tent in the magic spot in front of line in the sand because that still works too.  The bugs are actually providing more entertainment value at this point and I'm kind of okay with it for a few days at least.
---
Well fed is a buff. It’s not supposed to feed you lmao. 
---
For me lunchboxes are amazing so far as well as ammo converter although how tedious it is.
---
Lunchboxes don’t feed you they give you a buff
---
Thank you so much
---
Domes 3 and 7 for nuka-cola and X-01.  Don’t recall which is which.
---
&gt; Still sounds like a sick experiment from Vault-Tec to me. 
---
So basically the  ammo converter is the prototype version of the Power Cycle 1000, and *we're all Clem* from the Fallout 4 Vault-Tec Workshop expansion.
---
If so, I want the version of the ammo converter that releases the nice smells.
---
Sadly I am on PS4
---
Hold b?
---
I didn't know that! But still the dude took one of my legendaries from my stash for 30 caps so at least last night the bug was still an issue.
---
Or they'll just ignore it completely and never address it.
---
Confirming this is true.
---
Just never seen anything I liked I guess
---
yeah that would be it, thanks. rip ultrawide support though
---
It's marvelous how incompetent this company is.
---
Bet on top of that they will be totally surprised the next days, that not everybody loves the cool new ammo machine.
---
Bethsda hypes something up, everyone excited, bethsda brings out item, everyone excited. Everyone gets item, item is garbage, welcome to fo76, this is the entire cycle of the game, from launch till now.
---
Hahaha reminds me of Destiny Trials of Osiris Posts.
---
&gt; legitimately took me longer to convert a few thousand rounds of 10mm and shotgun ammo than it did to get to level 5.
---
and you had to rank up without the aid of the adrenaline perk..
---
Edit, just noticed this is documented I'd forgotten to refresh the list before posting, my bad.
---
I've seen a lot of people saying they get Challenges complete when only partially completed and it's def happened to me, but want to add, I am almost certain it happens with challenges that are meant to have 5 done, but unlocks at 3/5.
---
The reason I noticed is coz all my Challenges are Tracked and so for the Building Supply one I bulked some concrete and scrapped it and 3/5 came up on the screen for the challenge but it gave me SCORE for that challenge. Later it happened again at 3/5 on another challenge (can't remember which one).
---
Finally went into Site Bravo as it had all the robots I needed for the robots one, though I had killed a Vertibot before entering so had 1/5, I then killed a Mr. Handy on the way in and it popped 2/5 (I killed some earlier) then after killing 5 Turrets and it flashed on the side 3/5 but I got the SCORE.
---
The challenge stayed as incomplete in challenges screen until I'd done 5/5.
---
If anyone else can test/confirm it might help as it might simply be they were originally gonna do 3/3 then changed it to 5 but forgot to change the code and so it's still 3 needed for score but 5/5 needed to complete the challenge.
---
This might also explain why people are getting Challenges completed and not seeing rewards pop up at same time, they already got the reward at 3/5 but it still shows in their Challenges until they get 5/5, then the challenge disappears.
---
Edit: I can't test further today as I've done all challenges except 3 level ups and kill 10 legendaries.
---
I do like that it is there, because it can be helpful, but I am forever grateful to you for showing me how to turn it off.
---
I just found it on Nexus, you’re a lifesaver, thanks! Playing Fallout 76 without a sorting mod feels like playing chess without a chessboard.
---
I believe it, I think I may have 11 base strength points in my special and some of my melee weapons are over 1.3k close to 1.4k damage when just looking at the weapon in the pipboy. Hit enemies in the head or get a sneak hit or critical and my damage clocks in at over 3k easily.
---
Probably just your internet I had no issues so far
---
Just so we’re all clear, I’m not saying it was a good idea lol. Just that people are being very naïve about the reality of things. 
---
I personally think the real solution to the ammo problem is to be able to make bulk ammo packs to sell since no one will buy any rounds for 1 cap per round from what I’ve seen.
---
Okay usually i’m content with what bethesda sets as daily caps, but why.. even. cap it at 2000? if it’s not daily??? okay
---
It's really not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Sure you have to push the button three whole three times and sure the amount per sale is low but it's the 5th prize (out of 100) on the first ever season. It's not meant to be some end game, be all end all, meta machine. It's designed to trade in the random crap you pick up in the wastelands, not two years worth of hoarded ammo.
---
Just like every other addition/change to the game the end product didn't meet exaggerated expectations and so everyone treats it like the end of the world. Eventually people will get rid of the hoards of ammo and use it like it was meant to be used or put it away and forget about it once the next big "disaster" strikes the game.
---
Noob question but I can’t hear my squad and I don’t think my public squad teammates can hear me but my mic is working. Do I need to turn something on?
---
That one was a piece of cake. Took about 10 minutes and 2 fast travels.
---
I thought so, my download on the patch was fairly inconsistent. Running from 40mbps all the way down to 500kbps 😄
---
Built one.  Spent several minutes converting ammo and then deleted it from my camp
---
That would be great and I hope it will be implemented in my lifetime 😊
---
Just going to use it to convert ammo that doesnt sell to ammo that will
---
😄 Same here. I just got a Xmas wreath and presents 🎁 Wasn’t what I was expecting but I’ll take it none the less...
---
I didn't know that thank you.
---
Yeah, now that I’m doing these myself, it’s exactly like what you’re describing.
---
The Halloween party shack at the Fairgrounds has a few of them.
---
Ah, that sucks, sorry to hear about that :(
---
Excellent use for it.
---
Like all things in fallout when it comes to scrap, hey you never know when you might need it never.
---
You can always find them on nukacrypt
---
Honestly I'm pretty close to offering all ammo I don't want for free on my vendor. I have ammo gathering perks but I always get what I don's use.
---
I see. That makes more sense. What kind of int to get from ur melee build?
---
So it’s pretty much the same as on pc. You click the back button when the screen resolves and it will bring you straight back to the menu to sell the same type of ammo. I’m on Xbox back button is B.
---
Just played PP about an hour ago, had almost 10 people there! It was my first time doing it and it was insane... When the boss came out, a bunch of people had ultracite laser gatling guns. It was a cool light show!
---
I don t have it either :( I did see someone use it in game though. Not sure
---
Jeeeez that explains why my guy was hitting for low dmg.  What a crappy bug.  Not like I want to burn 5 levels moving SPECIALS and another 5 to move back when/if it’s fixed.
---
I used to deride people who were saying that they think bethesda should stop releasing new content until they get the game working properly..
---
strongly considering making another reddit acct just so I can go back and downvote myself.. lol
---
Herd Mentality and Empath both work solo now since being on a public team alone counts as being on a team. Those two together are like an extra rank of lone wanderer plus extra stats.
---
Just so we are all clear, the death claw is a screenshot from a melee spec, and the lever action is a screenshot from a rifleman build. They are two different specs, and I apologize if I didn't make that clear, but they are both damage for int builds.
---
All can build it.
---
It sucks but it's just a game. Dude sounded like he had a blast running around so I think he was just trynna give me a thumbs up by buying some stuff. 
---
I just was wondering if anyone had issues after the update.
---
Thank you for taking the time to explain it.  I will be on late tonight after work and am looking forward to getting started.
---
Maybe they left the event
---
Make sure you haven’t placed another object too close to the affected crafting station.
---
If there is something nearby, move it and see what happens.
---
Lmao I was just about to say it reminds me of the Destiny days 😂
---
I'm liking the public teams a lot, there seems to be so many benefits...
---
I had a regular .50 cal until around 110
---
broken up one, we probably wont get the full broadcast till the Steel Dawn stuff coming up this Fall
---
I just keep hitting the x button until I dont see it say it converted anymore. Its not that bad .Come on stop hating everything or become a game developer and make a better game yourselves
---
**WE TOLD THEM THIS WOULD HAPPEN.**
---
We told them on the PTS forums over and over that they should playtest the update. They didn't listen. 
---
Bethesda does not care about this game.
---
Huh wow Bethesda went and trashed the free atoms where nobody had to pay for extra atoms cuse they earned enough and went to a seasons system. 
---
Huh the overall version of the system mean that if you want the best stuff or anything not low on the season you have to pay Bethesda real life cash money? You don't say.... I'm shocked and appaled.
---
seems excessive
---
Let's not be a drama queen about it.
---
Thanks..... I'm already getting the feeling of a major grind with the seasons.  Even worse than tadpole and possum badges!
---
Sent you the friend request. My in game name starts with BigBa..... accept and I’ll come meet you.
---
It between that or complaint about it like everyone else
---
Nice. Sharing Inspirational forever is gonna be my standard
---
You get xp for events, crafting and stuff too.
---
Although I hate it I understand they didn't want to give duper's another way to work there magic.
---
You gotta go to emotes and re-equip it 👍🏼
---
The machine is shit. It’s so simple to make, too, since it would work basically the same way as vendors, but nope Bethesda still messed it up and made it hot garbage.
---
I can't say unfortunately, I haven't used my vending machines since they where last disabled, but I hope this issue is fixed, we should see people reporting soon enough if it does / doesn't.
---
It may be worse. I ran the numbers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hiyu7x/can_somebody_check_my_math_on_score_cost_for_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and unless there’s an interest cap, it’s not possible to earn the total season by weekly and daily challenges alone in 10 weeks
---
Ya mine hit at 1.4-1.5k base too at like 12 so thats why i askd bc i kno with the same weapon u cant get that much higher from 1 special pre buff.
---
Delete this comment before you give them the idea. Seriously, they would definitely do this...
---
&gt;Pip-Boy: Quests now sort in alphabetical order in the Pip-Boy.
---
_Thank you._
---
It's a steaming pile of Scorchbeast shit.
---
No it absolutely has not. People are doing it still. They have a few methods of it.
---
The sad part is that they literally could've just copied New Vegas's ammo crafting. I always found that to be a bit tedios, but they managed to one-up it by a large margin.
---
What’s the saying about “gift horses”?
---
Can you send me the link to it? I ran my own numbers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hiyu7x/can_somebody_check_my_math_on_score_cost_for_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and I feel like I’m missing something
---
Update 20 has some problems, no one's gonna deny it.
---
In the last few hours i saw more bugs and disconnects than i saw in the last month or two.
---
BUT!
---
I also saw real potential in the new features. Seasons made daily/weekly challenges fun again.
---
Public teams made me a fan of team-oriented play style, after two years of playing solo and avoiding other players.
---
This update was a step in right direction. I wish for a patch/update focused solely on fixing everything that seems to be broken now. And i hope it comes soon.
---
I've found they award the SCORE prematurely for me, around 3/5 completed on the weeklies and it'll give the SCORE without being completed. Actually completing it doesn't net anything extra though.
---
Put in a support ticket? They were always good about giving atoms for missed challenges before this
---
My only idea would be geforce experience since it has more settings and is good for optimizing
---
My 5 yr old nephew would get the hang of this game quicker then this guy did. How can you be so bad at such a simple game lol.
---
Main character of Kingdome has never even played the game.
---
https://youtu.be/Yqh8CCyQjFQ
---
I know this isn’t a direct example but if a game is going to have the main Characters looks based on you, then at least play the game for 10 hours to get a feel of it and then be able to interact with fans.
---
Bethesda got too comfortable with letting the modding community pick up their slack.  Now that they're mostly left to their own devices, we see them struggling with even the most basic concepts.
---
Luckily I have camp right next door
---
The same int. I just wanted to show there are options. Int builds are viable and I am not the first person to run one.
---
That's a nice salute! But don't you guys think that we should be able to see that from the Atomic Shop, instead of looking it up on the internet?
---
That's basically it. I poured some .38s into it so I need to spend less steel on my 2mm. In the end it does save me time.
---
I didn't expect it to reinvent the wheel and I didn't expect it to basically convert thousands of rounds into even hundreds of rounds in an instant as that partially kills the "scavenging" gameplay loop.
---
It's a convenience item, meant to supplement the current means, not replace them. Same as the Collectron and the ArmCo. in that regard.
---
I dont think the idea is to try and complete the board via XP alone..
---
I don't think so. I just wrapped that up real quick last night for this reason.
---
many games over many years tbh
---
Gotcha!
---
Gotcha
---
I added all the weeklies and dailies and came up with 215,000 out of 226,250 required if that’s correct. So the xp would be required
---
✔
---
I tried expanding my emote wheel and looking at the atom store to try and re-equip it, but it wasn't in either of those places.
---
My guess is you can but u can’t spend it on anything till u finish it
---
Oh shit. I have to play the game then..
---
Shhh
---
On a scale of 1-76, how disgraceful is it that modders are better at fixing Bethesda games than Bethesda is?
---
(I know this is FO76, I'm just saying.)
---
Two weekly challenges so far (Robots and building crap at camp/workshop) have completed but not rewarded points for me. Total of 2000. Multiple relogs, server hops, hours further. Nothing changed.
---
*there are no UI designers working
---
Doesn't even need to be an expert. Doubt they could afford one considering the skeleton crew they have as the dev team. These kinds of things are something you could figure out with a 15 minute google search or a youtube video
---
However, I think they also have just dug themselves into a hole too deep to get out of. Guns were pretty reasonable in the earlier games, but then fo4 brings in all kinds of fuckery...the "assault rifle" is a refurbished ww1/2 machine gun, complete with water cooled barrel, the combat rifle and combat shotgun look nearly identical and are based off a PPSH, a ww2 submachine gun, the default model for a hunting rifle uses a left-handed bolt...it's a mess
---
I don’t run as high on the INT w/ consumables and the like but will agree a decent bloodied gun makes this fairly trivial. Yes, I’m squishier than my other chars, but you know - INT 45-50 is nice for leveling.
---
Half the problems with this game is duping ruining everything for everyone else
---
Its a vertibird power armor
---
People tested went wtf are you smoking and Bethesda actually listened for once and went back to drawing board.
---
Shitty design/implementation doesn't magically get better with time.
---
I feel bad for the community managers, their job from the start has been to take the brunt of people's anger as things are broken in increasingly bizarre ways, and all they are allowed to say is "make sure to submit a ticket", "we will notify the team of this issue", etc
---
Only when someone pulled it from the cranberry woods.
---
True! And me too- I was just putting up my store for the first time since they were disabled.
---
Looks like an original ArmaLite AR-10.
---
Did you expect it to be easy? That’s not how games work...
---
That might have been what happened
---
Too bad I can't see what my dailies are. Makes the board sorta useless
---
You might have to replace it but I'm not sure cause I'm not home at the moment
---
Ammo converter is pure agony to use.
---
On PC you can, click and hold the mouse down and drag the map around. Console probably is similar holding a button and moving the map.
---
Hey there, welcome.
---
Its a bit of a bug if I understand you correctly. Its most common for me with heart of the swamp but it generally indicates the server you are on is lagging out and or the event you are showing up to just happen to be ending as you arrive.
---
An easy fix is to switch servers although they might be under strain with the new update.
---
Good luck.
---
I started out thinking it was a generous new bug where progress was being awarded too early. But the 3/5 rule applies to killing the different types of robots too.
---
Not even a fridge? Those fridges come in handy, food lasts considerably longer. I put scorchbeast brain, cranberry cobbler, and other tasty treats in there. You can access the food from any stash box too.
---
I hate cooking dishes one by one too..
---
The gather 7600 wood challenge is the same. Took a year.. id just grab every log and pile as i went by doing other stuff.. almost like I have ocd
---
It's not your fault. Bethesda intentionally mislead you with the way they worded their messaging on this.
---
What you thought was what most people thought. It's the same too regarding Bethesda saying that you can earn rewards just by doing things you normally do, suggesting that this is the norm and not something you can get SOME rewards for.
---
Also, OP you have one other option - just opt out. Don't go out of you want to do any of the challenges and play daily. Just play as much and how you want to play and get what you get and don't even bother with the rest.
---
Same with rep grind, same with bullion grind, same with this too.
---
As the famous saying from War Games goes "the only winning move is not to play".
---
Damn, that makes it so much easier! I was just spamming X after selecting the one I wanted once through, thanks for the tip!
---
Yeah I almost got that once but I’m a saver I guess. It’s gonna be hard to let them go lol
---
I had to quit out of the game after converting 2000 worth of shotgun shells and I was stuck in terminal...... totally waste of space in its current state
---
It should have worked sort of like the ammo press in new Vegas expansion. You put all the ammo you don’t want in and turn it on and it pukes out scrap. That’s what should have happened
---
Currently seems to be a problem that people turning up to events are having them not join. 
---
Happened to me an hour back with Guided Meditation. Paid to get there only to have no event show up. Ended up just waking around watching everyone else do it while for me it had even disappeared from the map.
---
I lost it too!
---
You agree with me to address the exploits. Targeting punji boards is the most random thing you can think of but it shows the exact horrible direction this game is going. Less and less interaction between players. More and more events you join together to shoot at computer enemies to give you a false sense of completion by some random form of monetary value as the reward instead of the gameplay itself being the fun part. 
---
It’s a chore to clock in and pump out dailies. It’s a chore cus it’s not challenging. It’s repetitive. It lags and can be inconsistent. The rewards for each spin to get anything from it - you are at loot box levels of rng. 
---
The priorities they pick and chose to pay attention to with bug fixes is a problem. It seems to have no relevance to the success of the game itself but more inline with having more platforms to make atom shop items as recovered revenue since no one is shelling out for it in the numbers they want because the player base is shrinking. So they offer them as rewards as content through a season. A season of doing the same repetitive activities. 
---
I tried coming back it was fun cus of the freedom of camp building. You should be able to build anything as long as you don’t go out of your way to be offensive. Sadly this game is just trying too hard to make you pay for so very little.
---
I just checked... Keys still working and plans are still there (for t-51b and x-01) so you got the wrong dome.
---
I got a wreath and an assault rifle skin randomly from NW, my guess is a bug.
---
Also after completing one event in adventure I got all the variations of the mechanic jumpsuit and both variations of the scout armor mask. I’m not complaining but now I feel kinda guilty.
---
I've found a dozen or so. Managed to kill a pack L40 Wolves during an impromptu test but tbh I still think they are underpowered
---
i found a set of 2 off a mole miner, and a separate set of 2 off a chest (plans known)
---
I’m pretty sure ward is a sociopath
---
Tastes.I find it really boring.
---
Yeah it’s pretty cool. Well done Beth!
---
Looking for help getting Fallout to run?
---
If so, you may have missed the links in the sidebar, the links in the drop down menu above, and the large message when posting. 
---
Please check the [sidebar / drop down menu fix guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutMods/wiki/fixguide) for a list of fixes that will get the game running.
---
If you are posting for something else, please ignore me, I am simply a bot trying to do his best.
---
If you have an available character slot, can't you just make a new character? You should be level 2 just by leaving the vault.
---
Of course, but apart from the easy weekly &amp; daily challenges there's no way of blasting ahead by just playing and getting xp
---
sweet can’t wait to check it out. Hope some of the other stuff won’t be so disappointing.
---
Yeah got the same.
---
I agree, but making them available without the plans is probably a good first step.
---
except worse.. you're losing about 5k atoms you earn via weeklies/dailies
---
i don't feel so anti-social anymore.  now just to get a mic and turn the volume up!  baby steps  lol
---
Shhhhhhhhhhh
---
Im on Xbox, sorry. Would have been cool though.
---
498 clicks on the screen to convert 1,992 .308 ammo into 200 5.56 rounds.  That's not including the clicks to actually buy the ammo.  Despite all of the defending of this game I have done to people, all of the convincing and praising I've tried... Bethesda finally made me quit Fallout 76.  Oh not to mention the insane lag and frame rate spikes that I didn't have before the update which has rendered my game nearly unplayable.  Icing, meet cake.
---
correct.. it is borked af
---
Upvote x1000
---
Yeah. Anyone familiar with this game would know this is clearly the best team in the long run.
---
Seriously i don't care that i get such small quantity as long as i can throw my leftover ammo in quick, it's just at this rate i prefer to just go back to throw them away immediately, instead of going through laggy menus over and over and over.
---
Just accepted it. Teleport to me when you can. I did forget to mention how l’m new to the game so if I need to get more experience before we talk I’ll do so and we can meet another time.
---
Found on page 14 of WordUp! Magazine
---
It’s known that some doors just won’t open - message pops-up that the thing is inaccessible or something. Just change servers or go back later.
---
That doesn't work at lvl 2 ,but you'll level up simply by going to flatwood and doing a quest there. 15 minutes top.
---
I got a lover seat or some shit like that. Don’t know why cause I got killed when I got it. Participation medal? Lol
---
Is there an expectation of voice chat use during public team events? I prefer not to use the voice chat, but am interested in the casual public group option.
---
It's similar in concept but you nolonger get the atoms to spend on items of your choice, at least not immediately and in smaller quantities. Instead you get Beth's choice of rewards and so far I'm not impressed with the sink or ammo converter, and most others are cosmetic with the odd other reward thrown in. It's not terrible, it just very 'meh' as it's more of the same (well less of the same to be precise).
---
I hope they rework the UI and make it like every other menu, go in slider to throw ammo in, get the currency, convert to new ammo, so simple.  
---
This is hot garbage right now.
---
wonder who tested this machine, and what their thoughts were of it
---
