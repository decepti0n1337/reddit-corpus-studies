So my LvL 50 anti-armor cyrolator would be helpful for this fight?
---
---
---
People are curious.  If you found it at level 30-40 and had no clue it was designed for 2 people at level 50 it would be extremely hard.  People tend to find Harper's Ferry right in that level range and the dungeon is right in Harper's Ferry.  Looking at the content from their perspective is very valid.  There is no warning and it's not level gated to keep them out, a level 15 player could conceivably stumble upon it even.  Because of this it is valid to look at it from the perspective of a low level player.  
---

---
It's not a false argument, it's acknowledging that anyone can run it and we shouldn't just look at the content from the view of our level 100+ characters.  
---
Just because we are high level doesn't mean that we are the ones who decide what it's supposed to be.  Bethesda never said it was end game content.  They placed it in an area that is first discovered around levels 30 to 40.  They said that we would have difficulty with it alone, not that it would be hard, not that it would be like the SBQ but difficult.  It can be difficult if you aren't geared up, aren't paying attention to your health, or aren't expecting a nasty surprise at some point in the dungeon. 
---
The bottom line is The Burrows is exactly what they promised.  That people interpreted difficult as end game isn't a failure of Bethesda but of the players who decided to associate difficult with end game.
---
It's a joke........just ignore the realities of the game and play along.
---
They will have it in the patch notes on Tuesday.  This is kind of how they announce things like that before the patch notes are out.
---
I don't carry around rose's syringer but I do keep an endangerol syringer with me. (20% reduction to resistances for 3 minutes) and oh boy is it great for tough fights like the SBQ. I also use a cryolator to slow down the queen so shes easier to hit, these two things and suppressor weapons truly make a difference. The game gets boring when everyone's bloodied and running their super builds, so a support build is fun.
---
How did he drop armor, junk and ammo at the same time when losing connection? I’m on PS4 too this sounds pretty scary.
---
I want to know if the challenges will work on yourself when the camera is here. Maybe you can take selfies with it?
---
Whats your gt me and my group will hit you up for some flux were probably take all of it tbh
---
Exactly!!!
---
Good.
---
The vast majority of cases where one player kills another for a workshop in Adventure Mode, is due to targeting by griefers. As one of the commenters put so clearly, most of the griefers, kill, take the coin &amp; junk, leave and never take the workshop. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Griefers should stop pretending be PvP players. They're ***not***. Griefers are opportunists, bottom-feeders and not true pvp players. A griefer calling themselves a competitor is like a game hunter calling himself an athlete and hunting baby seals a sport. See, except the deer doesn't even know he's playing the game. 
---
You want to talk PvP? Why is it okay to dome a level 22 modding his hunting rifle at a workshop? Because huh, "The window warned him that he could be killed when he claimed the workshop." Grow some balls, invite him to the team or jump servers. Lift them up. Don't smash them down. Simply b/c you can, doesn't mean you should. Any pro would agree. You don't see LeBron James going to your local park and turning everyone to ash b/c they dared stepped on a basketball court. If you're a real baller, you're stomping where the real competition is. 
---
Sure, there's some legitimate reasons to claim a workshop from another player (resources needed for the nuke zone) but if your INTENT is simply to take advantage of the player who owns it, you're f\*ckin junky-ass griefer who can't hang with the real dogs who can shoot back. 
---
No more pretending for you griefers. You're gonna get called out in this thread.
---
Hi. This was just shown to me, I'm glad I was able to improve your experience.
---
Like a lot have said here, there are many higher level players (and compared to most, I'm not that high of a level) that do what we can to help out the new players.
---
Also, I didn't bring you to Watoga until you were at least level 5 😂😂 and I'm pretty sure you only died like twice.
---
(And yeah, Mayor for a Day is why they didn't attack me. Me and the bots are bros) 
---
But hey, thanks for the shout out. You know I'm down to play whenever. (Minus impromptu vacations)
---
Sometimes I hate my job but reading posts reminds me that someone at BES has the job of reading our posts and reporting then to leadership. It makes me feel better about my work. I'd love to be the director getting the PPT that said 15 users said "this sucks balls" while another 5 said it only partly sucked balls and 35 said it was fun.ill smile at work today
---
FYI: one of the community managers has said that are making a change that will make nuke zones count as a rad storm. I wish I could link to it but since I read 90% of the posts I pass on here it would be hard to find it.
---
That would be tricky for me to try out, risking losing all of that stuff would be terrible. Instead for now I'm leveling a second character that plans to use auto pistols and explosives for more of a fast medic type build.
---
a soft no on saving to the resources part, that's still data to be saved and load but depending on how they do it (mainly keeping the data from being part of the character's save data that loaded in the rest of the game) then it could have minimum affect in the rest of the game due to their cloud set up. Tho that's pure speceration as i have no actual knowledge on how things are set up.
---
still AS LONG as it DOESN'T cost $150 to buy a house that's only on sell for a weekend, i'm all for it.
---
The headdress is probably the best potential piece of loot from the event.  The beast itself usually drops garbage legendaries.  Now...if the Sheepsquatch actually dropped a guaranteed three or four (for the cost to play...it should be four) star legendary, I think we’d see the event being attempted a little more frequently than it currently is.
---
I don’t know how many times in FO 4 I’d use or buy a 6 cap beer to sell stuff for 200-400 extra caps
---
Bethesda.net account I’m sure
---
Do you now use the single barrel or the triple barrel?
---
Well then we get into how the purveyor will work, which we have snippets of but not fully spelled out on the will and wont part.  Most of my space is now taken up by 2-3 star legendaries in preparation for (I hope...) retooling the pieces of gear I do like.  Considering the way Burrows went, my hopes are low for Purveyor until I see it in action.
---
I'm 29, one of the first friends I made in game is 17. We've both gotten bored with the game, but we've started playing other games together. Turns out not all kids are annoying little shits, contrary to my previous belief.
---
I once heard people taking about Facebook groups that farm. Never used or saw one but might be a place to look
---
LV 50 All Rise &gt; hours of self-exploration.
---
Well, I'm working out of town, so I wont he able to get the eggs. I wanna know. Lol
---
while naked a drunk like the devs were when they made the challenge.
---
Be aware. Use stealth. Obviously they are doing both of these things.
---
Single barrel. i use speed demon to increase reload speed
---
A little more than just gently. They seem to be outright shoving us into buying lately.
---
I deleted a mod and tried a different one thinking it was broken. I hope that it works after next update. I’ve only just started playing again since release and this happened.
---
Shame he wasn't in a party and wasn't getting any perks shared to him as you can tell in the video 😂
---
You give me hope. Tse shotgun, mutation here I come!
---
Haha. 😅 Well I was attempting (poorly) to phrase it without *too* much bias.
---
To be fair, I brought him to various areas on the map so if a quest needed him somewhere he wouldn't have to walk the entire map for that one place. We hit aarons homestead, watoga, one of the hornbeck sites, and crashed satellite.
---
And we did start the main storyline, with just a few detours.
---
I mean, Its pretty obvious you're lying
---
"photo made is disabled inside" you cant use photomode to take pictures of weapon stats, so you know print screen works anywhere  
---
"Power armor" \*glitch into the building\* - Is impossible, you can only VATS glitch inside  
---
And a dataminer confirmed the vendor isnt working.
---
Stop downvoting me asking you simple questions and take your lies elsewhere
---
Ps4 ShoshanaZZZ, thanks!
---
And staggering someone in Sentinel Assassin's makes them venerable. One guy in SA against a team of four and every one of them has perks that stagger, he's going to die.
---
Does the triple barrel also bug out, or have you not tried it?
---
Fail troll.
---
He had no mutations.. although im sure if you ask him to clip it when he showed his gear/mutations/skills. Furthermore he would not of had the perks to make the mutations useful.
---
I mean he’s right, that’s why they don’t do it now
---
never bothered too.
---
[removed]
---
I'm sure that's true! They are hard to find tho.
---
first thing I clipped was my friend when I missed the mole rat he was fighting was lols
---
I've also noticed a very strange phenomenon where if I am chameleoned and I take out a weapon and then put that weapon away, I became WAY more invisible
---
Yeah it’s an effect that is only good for a few weapons tho , like you’re unlikely to get much use out of a 10mm instigating sub machine gun since the damage would be minor anyway , that’s why I’ve put it with junkies at the bottom, since it’s only useful in certain situations.
---
I looked didn't see anything
---
I'll give you 2000 caps for it. My final offer.
---
Simple fix. You wouldn't be able to enter with a wanted level to deter that sort of behavior?
---
I have a ps4 account but my one I play is PC thanks though that's cool of you.
---
You can buy stuff from the camp build menu. Did you accidently do this?
---
I am not able to for whatever reason.
---
Getting?
---
Gary?
---
got rid of it
---
Poke hooks with puncturing do great damage as well. The 3 star ones that is.
---
It goes when he goes doesn't it?
---
Same here.
---
Like player homes in GTA. Multiple players can share the same space in the map but each player had their own place.
---
I found a good ice breaker is dressing up in a clown outfit as an overweight dude with a sack hood with hoses and pull out a chainsaw. Works every time half the time
---
Hussein lol
---
Also, SB wing segments have gluten and my wanderer is gluten sensitive.  Also, he is lactose intolerant, but Brahmin milk is lactose free. So that’s nice.
---
&gt;Orrrrrr ya know QoL perks could just be always on and not require a perk slot... but ya know that’d make things too easy.
---
It'd provide some build variety if I didn't have Ri worry as much about healing and food and junk weight.
---
Hey just waiting on my buddy to repair his gear and I'll be heading into the silo to launch on the  queen.  gt phishntrips
---
Yeah... I have shot a few people for jumping out of the bushes.  Sorry!  Used to it only being bad news.
---
That would guarantee I'd run away screaming even without the good and chainsaw! 😂😂
---
Slather myself in peanut butter and run naked through the woods? No, wait; that's raccoons.
---
We did! Only for a second so he could "discover" a location in that area. He had a hazmat suit though.
---
And we didn't immediately jump to Watoga, he was levelled a few times by then. Lol
---
You can't polish a turd.
---
Oh no you're absolutely right; I ran into this guy right outside of Hornwright HQ and we just started playing. At first I thought he was in his early 20's based on his humor and behavior, turns out he's just 17.
---
Could read the replies to the thousands of other posts identical to this in this sub ;;)
---
Also hard mass and digested goo
---
Np
---
Ya there are a lot of p.o.s. in the game and at times I could be one myself sometimes but I'm one that likes to see other players rise and enjoy the game by giving them healing chems weapons armor. But I just ran into one of the lowest pos ever I joined a world right into a nuked zone and the game was gliching and so I couldn't get my armor out in time so I died well when I died this scum bag took all my junk the junk I use to help ppl with so ps4 players watch out for th1anonly1488 that's his players name just so everyone knows and if u really need something hit me up if I have it I'll trade it or give it or sell it to u see u out in the wasteland Biglokote509
---
It's just a dime bro.  Chill TF out with your outrage culture.
---
I dont buy it for one second.  I dont believe even Bethesda are so monumentally incompetent as to track each and every individual item in a stack of scrap like that.
---
My handmade is currently 22+lbs.
---
What's it made of?
---
Fucking dark matter?
---
Yeah, stealthboy is a must.
---
Bloodied is good in PvP and PvE because you can generate so much damage in the first few hits (or one)... if you're almost dead. Take the Bloodied effect then add the nerd rage, bloody mess, and weapon-appropriate perk cards. Then add adrenal reaction mutation. All of that stacks to insane levels at 20% health. Sneak multipliers can take all of that and multiply it by 2-3.5 times. My Bloodied The Dragon does 240ish with me at full health and some rifle perks. If I get down to below half health, it's dealing around 700.
---
wear asylum outfit and hat, sunglasses and wield a sword.
---
It’s not true.  I still had a keycard.  I think this was mistaken for the technical data or something.
---
Close and restart the entire Fallout 76 client.
---
This weapon in action: https://youtu.be/Qjr98xJ1GoA
---
Watch this: https://youtu.be/Qjr98xJ1GoA
---
Have you reset the app within the last 18 minutes.
---
It’s kinda sad if you think about it.  You’d think they watched the planet get irradiated and most likely realized they were already dead since there wouldn’t be any more supplies from the planet below.  Couldn’t use an escape pod either because of the aforementioned radiation.  Probably took stock of supplies/rations and then made peace with their situation.  They most likely either starved to death or something happened on board that couldn’t be fixed.
---
That door someone mentioned might have a tragic story waiting behind it.  And some sweet space power armor.  So you know...take the good with the bad.
---
Is this a VATS build as well?
---
Ok I grabbed a few melee weapons I had laying around, took off all my cards and clothes so I had a base 15 str and nothing else.  My in game damage number is listed first and what I found on your page in ( )
---
Baseball bat: 96 (not listed)
---
Fire Axe: 138 (126-low)
---
Pitchfork: 109 (90-low)
---
Sledgehammer: 124 (124-match)
---
Super Sledge: 149 (149-match)
---
I suspect that some of your base # you got off the wikis (which look in disrepair) are inaccurate.  Hope this helps your quality checks, keep up the good work.
---
I haven't played recently but that's a solid idea.
---
They keep replying but aren't fixing...
---
No. The only reason I have gun fu and four leaf clover is Incase I get rushed by a horse and have to take them down quick with vats
---
You can see if he's in a party from watching the video and looking to your left... So no perks shared. I'm imagining that he doesn't have that many special points or perks to begin with so I don't see how it would even matter considering he's not level 50 but whatever. He mentioned he walked in with no legendary gear whatsoever but you're free to ask him or look at his vods.
---
Side note: insulting his voice clearly shows you've got the mentality of a three year old. None of the things you mentioned mattered because there is no way a level 15 would be able to out damage a level 50 with half decent gear. This dungeon was *advertised* as one you'd take on with multiple level 50s. I don't think there's any build in this game that would allow a level 15 to be as powerful as 2-4 level 50s. If there is that's a sign of shit balancing but I don't think his level 15 character is the problem.
---
When I did UF day before yesterday with 2 people there were a crap load of miners
---
This!  Let us make ammo crates or whatever you want to call it, instead of periodically dropping several hundreds or thousands of 5 different ammo types!
---
Okay that's good. One for bestheda. Lol
---
Whitespring of course. All the ghouls will be spawned at low level when you show up, you can farm xp and legendary there all day long. Vendor, workbenches, drinks, massage... all in one place. Can’t think of a better place.
---
This happens after the nuke zone is finished and the glowing ones stop spawning. I've seen liberators, protectrons, and one time some low level gutsys
---
Dp yall get these drops from the assaultron?
---
How would something like Twisted Muscles not be beneficial?
---
I watched a dead ghoul stand up and start walking after I had already looted him. Very strange.
---
I just did, thanks
---
Good with salt and green thumb go a long way if you're trying for the fancier recipes.
---
It worked
---
Np, gl
---
How exactly does this ‘dataminer’ work? Do they hack into Bethesda intranet or are they actually company’s channel for soft advertising?
---
Ammo and items that can help players out at low levels like Healing Salves, Cure Disease, etc are all going to be great vendor items to place around low level areas.
---
Close out the application and then go back in. It will be there then.
---
They look into the game files.
---
Nope, just off a random 3 star mob.
---
Liberators are the best. Still spawn with legendaries, but they're almost all one shots.
---
I've got them both on my current build, but it almost gets to a point where I need a map to find and remember where I can get specific ingredients
---
There are bolt action and auto pipe Legendaries, i have several.
---
Clip coming soon.
---
Any chance there will be a way to get the first egg again?  The event kinda dropped out of nowhere and I didn't know about it until after the first day was done.  Small amount of atoms or something?
---
And when I go in there. I find non legendary charred ghouls
---
Me to I only have three eggs because of the same thing it really pisses me off
---
Ok so I'm not the only one. Thought I needed to stop drinking.
---
Fellow transmasc person on PS4 here!! I'm only in the 40s but would be happy to play with you too :)
---
You have to level up under X conditions you can trip multiple ones at once in a single level up. And you can level up 5 times and not complete it because you didn't trip any condition.
---
Yeah. I get ya. I've been doing Biv's quests daily and I have had to Google plant locations more than once.
---
&gt;that’s why they don’t do it now
---
That's not really a good reason though. Remember when they didn't let us rename objects? Wasn't because it was impossible, just didn't get around to it yet.
---
Don't forget Assasins Sentinal armor, 15% damage reduction + 8% damage reduction from other players, so 23% damage reduction x 5 pieces of armor + fireproof + nerd rage + auto stim + lone wander + junk shield + blocher + life saver + meds = need to stagger for a chance to kill.
---
The one I watched walked right through the wall. I took a picture.
---
Anytime an enemy is actually dead but looks alive I tend to take a picture. I have an awesome glowing mutant hound pic.
---
Right after all the use a camera challeges are no longer showing up
---
Well that sucks, and there’s over 5 dollars gone
---
He picked your pockets and stole your lämp. No one is safe.
---
Alot of explosive weapons have been disappearing lately according to other posts. Don't know of it's an anti-duping bug gone awry(not to say at all that you duped), or an issue with renaming certain items. I had a TSE pipegun disappear off one of my older unused characters last week. It was my first legendary drop of the entire game.
---
Cool. My first trip into the Ash Heap I noped out of there because I didn't pick up a mask and no hazmat suit yet. Now my only complaint is my Nuka Girl helmet doesn't filter the air.
---
I'm only in the 40's too, no biggie!! what's your psn?
---
Oh Boy, I still have nightmares about trying to figure out how to keep anything with that.
---
Can't you?
---
Also, i figure if there is another player there helping me out and winds up shooting me, it’s probably by accident.
---
One trick ive used for higher level mobs is the old vats grenade trick, throw a grenade and shoot it a couple times with vats. Depends on the level difference though I guess
---
guess we didn’t need to post about the repair kits every day too ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Could have it say "You cannot enter bunker while in combat" or while enemies are near or something. Though... I suppose it's hard to gage when a human is aggro'd on you. Maybe a timer on pvp combat initiation, like you can't enter within 30 seconds of engaging another player or enemy.
---
Yeah, typically when you run up to a random, start no conversation, and just hit trade they are going to turn it down.
---
Exactly
---
I don't think so
---
If I want to take them,  I'll take them.  It's part of the game.
---
sarcasm is not your strong point i take it
---
The reason I had to ask is because I'm not on PC. 
---
So looking at the screen? I dunno if there's HUD customization mods... Etc.  So I needed to ask. 
---
Though "No he wasn't" is hardly proof.
---
Side Note : That was at best mildly insulting. The thing is, as a presenter your appearance and voice matters. As does other things like being entertaining or being able to relay information/ideas clearly and concisely.
---
&gt; The game keeps track of every item and players having too many items causes server instability. Fact, we know this.
---
But we don't really know if it's unique item entries or all items. For anecdotal evidence, when I offloaded my unique notes (hundred or so maybe) it ran much better. However, conversely, it doesn't seem to run slower when after I end up with thousands of ammo.
---
If the game can do just fine with literally thousands of ammo but slows down when I have dozens of notes and armor, it's pointing more to "unique items are the problem" rather than stacked items.
---
At least bunker building. Similar to the free states bunkers would be cool.
---
Wikia says you can, theyve lied to me a bunch in the past few days though. 
---
Pretty sure I've seen it before though
---
Be there in 15 if it is still up
---
I love this idea!
---
I don't understand why they don't just set mods to have no resources output, who scraps mods anyways, theres no benefit. Just sell em!
---
I definitely think most of the people didn't know what to do.
---
This one guy though...... level 56 stuck out like a sore thumb in a mascot costume. I kept noticing this guy standing off to the side every time I would respawn. I finally got face to face with him and shot him a few times. He disappeared and then reappeared 10 feet away. He was server hopping the event and not contributing. That rubbed me the wrong way.
---
Well, today on Xbox the 4th egg is available. Restarting the game makes it show up later in the day.
---
No because it's true. 
---
I feel like a mother talking to the 10 year old
---
If all your friends jump from a bridge do you jump as well?
---
Strangler blooms for a beer is ridiculous. Like thats half a radshield.
---
No energy penetration for the heavy energy weapons is a bummer. You might argue it’s a laser so no penetration, but I still believe they should benefit from stabilized and anti-armor
---
if I’m wearing Power Armor, yeah!
---
What about the gatling plasma acting all wonky. It randomly dumps cores and starts to spin fires one shot then stops and u have to start all over again. No one has commented on this from Bethesda. Do you guys know this issue exists?
---
ready
---
Note that I will be reformatting my phone.  So communicate via PSN.  And I am in no hurry.
---
I would kind of laugh if wood armor was just completely destroyed after being hit by a Molotov thrown by a Super Mutant. That or having it cause additional fire damage to you because you're wearing wood that's been set ablaze.
---
So inside the game files Bethesda embedded a whole bunch of in-progress renderings of their future products, sounds about right...
---
Tried that,didn’t work. Appreciate the advise though,I didn’t think of trying that lol
---
A horse? or scorched?
---
They haven't said either way exactly why the game engine struggles so much with more items, just that it does. I said I am not sure how the game keeps track of items, its speculation based on the fact that storage isn't scalable.
---
There is evidence like the food you mentioned of stacks being individual items that are counted. I wouldn't be surprised at all if that's how it was done for everything. After all, this is a single player game engine that has been adapted to multiplayer - what works perfectly fine for one player might not scale well for 24 in a hosted environment.
---
it's internscout :) I look forward to seeing you in game!
---
Lol most friends quit this game and a challenge shouldn't require friends to do. Also, radstorms aren't easy to find, anything is "easy" when you have access to getting that access isn't easy lol.
---
Best food source I've found is those albino ragstags from the sheer terror questline. Theyre a quest animal, so reset every time you instance hop. Generally there are 3-4 and I throw on butchers bounty for some extra meat. 
---
The +20 carry weight is fantastic.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Interesting. There were also glowing ones in other sections of the greater WS area. Guess I don't normally go there after enough to have seen it.
---
My bad😂! A hoard of enemies
---
It really is a pain to make things. I feel like recipes using more than 3 items not counting water and wood should last 3 times as long before spoiling. I'm tired of food spoiling so quick after crafting. And I can't use that Good with Salt perk all the time.
---
I don't the beer challenges weren't easy, but weren't impossible felt like that was the stepping stone to this, wonder when the next challenges are going to be on the scaling of easy from release of the game to now.
---
That reminds me. I need to make more radshield at some point. Thankfully I have super duper and chemist now.
---
Ohhhhh!
---
Evidence from Engadget, using the example WoW, "data mining is the process of digging through WoW's data files and looking for information like maps, graphics, models, or sounds. It's not hacking or exploiting the game, just looking at the game files -- often, but not always, files that are publicly available -- to see what's there. These files can be from the current game client or come from a PTR or beta build, any of which could have new content that players can't access in the game world."
---
Quit the game, restart your Xbox. Start the game and download :D
---
I love radshield simply because I refuse to use rad-x because I end up killing myself with fall damage.
---
People bring their real world mentality into the game world 100%. A freeloader in life, a much worse freeloader in games.
---
That's what I'm saying, no reason for care bears to pick up PvP zones
---
Ah, Radshield doesn't suppress mutations then? That's good to know.
---
Well I'm going back to Fallout 4 until the next patch for now.
---
Just feel like there needs to be a better way to get a variety of food at your camp. Otherwise you're spending tons of caps and time shuttling it back and forth
---
Touch who? 😋
---
Cellbased Loading is a tradegy in this gamebryo engine. Sure it works to make rooms any size, butt he memeory efficency and the bugs are just stupid.
---
Your not supposed to be able to but sometimes it'll glitch and allow it
---
Yeah
---
I generally get like 50-60 meat then head home. Closest spawn location is like a stones throw away from the unmarked farm location.
---
Definitely!
---
Sneaking doesn't work the same in pvp, what it does is you can't get targeted by VATS if you are sneaking, no 2x damage. For pve it's great, a pure luck, agi and perception build is very strong, you can't carry a lot cuz of low str but you make up for it with all the ammo and stims you save from such a high damage output.
---
No, they’ve said it, they can’t do it because it would lag out the game
---
I mean, a rifle with all the bonus crap we add on in game, full of ammo, would be pretty heavy, but I am all for a weight reduction perk.
---
Although, a properly done rifle build is one of the strongest in the game. Can one shot pretty much anything from any distance.
---
To be fair most of them ignore you anyway
---
Yes please x10000
---
Yes it is viable, hard to do yes, you want rifleman all perks tank killer all the way, seperdivity how ever it’s spelled allows you to miss damage completely, unyielding armor, lever action bloodied, dateline rush. Those are some of the basics
---
I run a bloodied rifleman build. 
---
Do you want to use VATSs a lot? 
---
How much of your time is going to spent in PvP (Inspend 80% of my play time here). 
---
Do you want to run a bloodied build or high health build? If high health, you will rely more on crits for damage or AAE weapons.
---
I’ll check when I get home and let ya know for certain.
---
What do you want them to do? Do you want to just have a random amount of scrap each time you look or try to build something
---
Nice job. Love seeing these posts.
---
Right? Even putting the reciever on that rifle in the first place is a farce. They should have just brought back the Anti-Material Rifle from New Vegas. It's almost like they have so much salt over that game being praised more than their own Fallout.
---
My head is spinning thinking about that, I'm just not going to fight anyone till I get some better perks...ugh
---
Well, they are planning to add Display cases and you would potentially be able to place down unscrapped junk in your camp.
---
Thank you for saying that!
---
It really did, thanks!
---
Lol mine are kept more secure then a vault
---
Finger guns after help signing is my clue
---
Its about 400-500 if you find all the secret spots... I know, I was surprised when I was guided too. But it just shifts the burden to acid.
---
No you have not my good sir as to my knowledge
---
Most likely you're requesting things they don't want to sell. If some random person trades with me I'll start putting prices on stuff I would be willing to sell. I almost wish we could have a default loadout, so when someone opens the trade menu with me it would go ahead and put up the scrap, ammo and aid that I always sell
---
Is the 4th one up? My game has issues. I have flowery, patterned, and pink. Is there a 4th? Did I miss one?
---
I do Camp plans at 50-75, Aid at 50-100, and Weapon/Armor/Mods at roughly 30% discount from game value. No complaints so far.
---
Imagine saying some has a shit attitude when you act like that
---
Great write up, I certainly like that direction, but would hate to have a “new map”.  Would prefer just pushing the borders of the existing map over the mountains.
---
Personally I think wastelanders will be the repopulation of Appalachia by humans, and we’ll have to decide how were going to deal with that.  Open arms?    Unloading miniguns?  Perhaps with the robot hint we get companions and people in our camps.  Can’t get my hopes up too high.
---
At a chemistry workbench you can
---
But not for you, accidentally? Somehow taking the fastest possible path? Accidentally?
---
3 so far so i dont think so
---
It's simple, you should have 4 eggs by now ..
---
I would say yes but to many tabs
---
Ah yeah didnt see the time, 4th should be out
---
An above ground entrance block would be necessary for an underground Vault, but I think bunkers and vaults could be separate building sets with different material requirements and characteristics.
---
I would like to see both added to the game.
---
I mean, a thorough grasp of the english language definitely helps one understand what they are reading. 💁‍♂️
---
The fix is coming on Tuesday.
---
As of 8pm est tonight yes.
---
Somebody needed to say it.  Yeah I am mad as hell about this. Killed a glowing ghoul, got a brief glimpse into his inventory and saw he had high radiation fluids which is exactly what I was looking for and he vanished. &gt;:-(
---
Ok thank god. I have a long list of mods to install come Tuesday then!
---
about to fix gear and head in for round 2 should be in the silo in ten or less
---
I have a few I want to do also.  Can't wait for the patch.
---
fixing gear and heading to the silo again so stick around
---
I think they changed that to glowing fungus? Pickaxe pilsner right?
---
Avoid leveling something to 3 points til level 20, free perk card packs max help you max out some good stuff off free.  Personally on my 3-5 characters I leveled most things to 2 before cycling back and picking up that third point.
---
Learn how the luck based “search” things work early.  Pharma farma is awesome
---
You can level a stat point and pick a card from a different stat.
---
Gunsmith and makeshift warrior are great to a point.  Eventually 200% repair plus those stats for something else will win out, my opinion of course.
---
That’s all I can think of as far as things I wish I knew on my first character.
---
Didn't he just level up in that clip? To level 15? 
---
What was he using just moments before?
---
flowery, patterned, paint, and pink flower are the 4 out
---
I give the cranberry Sprite Zero to good guests
---
I don't know this but would guess it's people hoarding legendaries for the vendor update. Which is worsening the same problems the vendor was supposed to fix (getting people to trade multiple legendaries for tokens to craft a single different legendary) to lessen server load. 
---
Just a hunch.
---
We have gotten the flowery, patterned, paint splotch, and pink so far
---
Haha thanks
---
I know what data mining is, it’s just hard to imagine Bethesda would embed in-progress renderings in their game file because they makes the download unnecessarily large. If the ‘dataminers’ are able to pull the 3d model of sheepsquatch or upcoming power armors out of the game file, I totally get it.
---
Yep, when you get into the terminals with the Enclave, you find out that the previous residents were trying to access the nukes. To do so they needed to bring up the threat level (you see it in the control room, we're at highest threat level), which unlocks their access for generals and such. The general nastiness of the post war world wasn't enough to max out the threat level, so they decided to fake an invasion. While there may have been a Chinese operation beneath there originally, the bots we see today were produced by the Enclave in order to cause an "invasion", prompting the system to believe maximum threat level had been achieved. When the captions say "speaking chinese", the bots are apparently literally saying out loud "speaking chinese" in Chinese. Not even a phrase for any fans who know the language to decipher.
---
  
---
So. A bit more complex.
---
Honestly semi think that the Chinese had been a false flag boogeyman in America for a WHILE before the bombings. That's another rabbit hole though.
---
So many snippets of "Chinese Communist" lore we've had in the games fits way too well with the idea.
---
I love bunkers I have one in fallout and its nice to sit back and relax when no one can kill you
---
Bethesda exploiting people's "Fear of Missing Out" to keep player count. Shame.
---
I like the way you incorporated the bridge into the design. Though admittedly the flaming pyre under a wooden ceiling made me nervous. Haha. 😅
---
Shit, if I see some newb having problems I swooped in and give them upgraded weapons, armor and a shit ton of stim-packs. All I do when I'm bored is farm materials. All of the ammo and weapons I pick up and have no use for gets dropped off outside of 76 or the Red Rocket closest to 76.
---
Can someone explain to me how to damage calculation works here?
---
With a level 15 fireaxe at what 45 damage ? And 10% bonus from slugger puts him at 50 damage?
---
That ghoul is what 70 Hp? With like 85-90 DR?
---
Dropping his effective damage to like 7......but he's 4 shotting them?
---
Can someone clarify cause it makes zero sense
---
Yes absolutely.  Having to do all the crafting and repairs at my camp is a small price to pay for not having to worry about storage space.
---
I dont use vats much at range, so probably not at all.
---
It'll be a last resort really, i only really pvp when defending workshops.
---
I guess if I'm playing a ranged game, i should probably go bloodied as i don't wanna get too close/within range of enemies.
---
Thanks for the help so far :)
---
Your authority is not recognized in Fort Kick-Ass!
---
Agreed. The mods should be rushing in, not just sitting in some obscure corner not doing anything.
---
My bloodied railway rifle with 90% weight reduction still weight 6 pounds, no mods whatsoever. Can you imagine how heavy the thing is without the legendary weight reduction 😱
---
If its solid is PvE, it'll probably cater to me quick well, especially with a high dmg output :D
---
Actually I think they did. They counted on the quiet hermits (Free States), the obnoxious assholes (Raiders), the people who want to help you even when you don't want it (Responders), and the people who will take what you have by force if necessary, and are really good at killing everything (Brotherhood). I may be slightly biased on that last one, but you get the picture.
---
I think the culture in the game is great. It just wouldn't be a lawless wasteland if everyone was super nice and friendly all the time.
---
Or underground stuck beneath the map
---
You can do allot of damage with a bloodied rifle build. Without nerd rage maxed and with no drugs, my non explosive 1* bloodied hunting rifle does almost 500 damage so 2x that in sneak.
---
Boom! Roasted!
---
Out of curiousity, what rate do you have set? Bits/Hz?  And was it mono?
---
Spoiler Tag Please!!!
---
I have to agree. I get having it for roll playing games ect but it's insane for it to be part of a loot drop from a legendary enemy
---
Real funny LOL
---
Legendary weight increase effect 🤮
---
What does this have to do with the initial post?
---
It seems interesting and a fresh way of playing instead of explosive-twoshot/melee spam power armour builds lol. So I'd be up for trying it, even if it'll be tough to build/play.
---
That'd be my reason for using it. To have greater freedom with picking my fights and missing unnecessary ones.
---
I hit level 15 shortly before I entered the burrows, like five to ten minutes. The entire vod is up on our Twitch. Can't post links here.
---
All of Wild Appalachia is pretty much done, if not really close. That's why they don't have huge patches every time new content comes out.
---
It tastes like acidic ass.
---
Damage was about 70 ish due to the buff to strength given by power armor. I'm also power attacking
---
One player in Sentinel Assassins against four players with staggering perks who are not wearing  SA  is dead.
---
&gt; watching the video and looking to your left
---
Well no, not always, the display for those can bug out. 
---
They advertised well geared. An alt with an upgraded fire axe + stims is actually quite well geared. A new player without prior knowledge would not be. 
---
I regularly kill level 64-68's in HF with my level 5-10 alts (with enough stims) and a fire axe or hunting rifle. Does that make me OP? No, it takes 10x as long and costs more aid items. Does that make balancing bad? No, it is a low to mid tier dungeon to begin with. Level 50 is low, beginning of mid levels. Most high end players are 100-200+ easily now (and some have multiple 200+, 400+ etc)
---
Prior knowledge + twinked alts &gt; game balance. That's just all games are. If you're not convinced, go check out any speedrun or take no damage challenges in Fallout or Dark Souls series games.
---
That's the damage output I'm looking for. Especially if I'm sacrificing my HP. Sounds good for sure.
---
I know, but until then I wouldn't hold onto anything.
---
People have been reporting this for a long time, way before the rename patch, similiar posts like this has been popping up since launch.  I've had things disappear on me as well, I always assumed it was my mistake, the mouse over object overriding the object selected at vendors and crafting stations.  If you can call poor UI design user error that is.
---
I did it without any mutations. Also, personal insults are a bit much. Apologies for my voice, no one gets to choose theirs unfortunately, but great analogy.
---
Cheers man, sorry if I was grating.
---
Caps are easy to come by, that god roll isn't. Lol that's undervalued offer tbh.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Never said radstorm are easy to find but I was arguing that to take a picture of a player while pvping is easy.
---
It's a mood
---
Couple that with serendipity, dodgy and bolstering armor, and you will have a lot of fun.
---
Ya this seems to happen to me often with legendarys  ghouls.  It sucks because I run a sneak/ curt build, turning on the light to look for the disappearing corpse kinda defeats the whole sneak thing.
---
I don't think they have, can you lock down where they actually directly say that?
---
I mean, to be equitable they could only allow mods that modified the UI in the most subtle of ways. Everything is server side, so they won't be able to allow mods for textures on structires, or to affect how long food lasts, or to let you scrap world objects inside a build area. Mods in this game would effectively be useless.
---
Gremlins. 
---
Microwave the little bastards.
---
Well I usually run a 2h bloodied build. After switching to a one hand build its actually cutting through ghouls like butter. Think I might hold onto it.
---
If you had spent a bit more time investigating the VOD the information could easily have been uncovered. I attempted The Burrows without the full set of power armor, it was sort of impromptu to see if it could work, therefor, I did not necessarily show all my perk cards and everything very clearly and concisely prior.  
---
It really was just an amateur attempt.
---
What class of armour would you recommend? Am i looking mainly for low DR or Do i want to be able to preserve what little health I'd have? :P
---
They said it in an inside the vault but no date
---
Thanks! I had no idea about laser rifles' plastic value, next time I level up definitely will get the scrapper perk.
---
The weight loss you see is actually just the consumed plastic. Most bulked items actually gain the weight of the plastic added. Cork is the only thing that gets lighter when bulked.
---
It would also help to prevent ammo from breaking the economy, so instead of having 1 bullet equal 1 cap you could have a bulk of 50 5mm rounds equal something like 20 caps
---
Nah, keep allll the missile launchers... shoot all the missiles immediately! until they break/run out, then scrap them. 
---
They're seriously fun to use.
---
Bolstering adds up to 35 damage resist the lower your health. You could mix an unyielding piece in there.
---
This all assumes you don't have Sentinel Assasin armor. I use a bolstering set for adventure and SA for Survival.
---
Yes! Glad I'm not the only one. I forget it's on the map now
---
Awesome thanks man - knowing it’s on their radar/to do’s is enough for me.
---
There is always the ghoul that is just dead and floating in mid air on the road near the enclave bunker.
---
Literally everyone.
---
Its back to WS for farming already - that Burrows nuke thing lasted for like a day.  I'll say again - we can't get instancing soon enough.  An instanced nuked Burrows is fair game for all that stop by.
---
About 2/3 of junk can't be sold individually to a vendor and must be bulked in order to do so. Some, like circuits, asbestos, crystal, gold, silver, black titanium, ultracite, fiberglass, fiber optics, and antiseptic can be sold directly to a vendor though as is.
---
&gt; With like 85-90 DR?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Dropping his effective damage to like 7......but he's 4 shotting them?
---
50 damage against 90 armor is only about 60% damage reduction, so that would still be 20-ish damage per swipe.
---
The game is designed to let you to do this. It's not griefing.
---
It most definitely was lol. Maybe you didn't notice but I definitely remember accidentally scrapping my freshly bulked junk several times.
---
I like to dress in vault tech outfits and meet new players leaving the vault. I drop a bag of low level gear and weapons and pretend to be a vault tech representative npc. I also like to repeat lines over and over to try and sell the lie. I doubt anyone has really bought it but it's fun.
---
[https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Slowpoke.jpg](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Slowpoke.jpg)
---
Is the shielded the most upgraded version? If so ill buy one im on xbox
---
Its real, they upped the cap a while ago and decreased the amount that turrets take up, but now you can only have up to 10.
---
The Truth.
---
How’s it a spoiler? Lol. I mean if you wanna know you’ll click on the link if you don’t wanna know don’t click on the link.
---
&gt;game "naturally" respawns them, which takes \~30 minutes.
---
The game does not naturally respawn mobs outside of when the server decides to shift mob types. In practice, only 'fresh' players entering an area will spawn them.
---
This doesn't bother me as much as people exploiting the "team invite and kill system" or being wanted and farming players with teammates. Those are downright ridiculous.
---
Don't waste your time. My ticket is well over a month old.
---
I think I speak for everyone here... shush!
---
Destroying camps isn't a reporting offence. You just block them, switch servers and hope that they don't have friends.
---
Absofuckinglutely nothing...
---
We can read the entire synopsis without clicking your link
---
I looked all over. Could you DM me which item you're talking about?
---
Maybe it was just me, but it most definitely was not. Bulk items, baseballs, beer bottles, deathclaw hands, hallucinogen canisters, ruptured and not, stingwing barbs - all had to be manually scrapped.
---
Actually, that reminds me...Do you have any idea WTF the stingwing barb is for?!
---
Also lights
---
Yes!  Splitting the Aid Tab into two would be ideal.  I agree that you don't want too many tabs but one more would be fine.
---
- Chems, stimpacks, etc
---
- Food, drink
---
5 pound pizza...oh...I think I just had a crisis in my pants.
---
But it’s not a spoiler it’s a helpful hint. I didn’t go into detail about the mission I just said where to start it since these mounted head missions are all through out the map and are very well hidden.
---
You have to actually land the final kill shot on SBQ. Virtually impossible unless you can solo the event.
---
?
---
I love my bloodied ss awe.
---
Underrated weapon.
---
He is also said we would have unlimited stash space.
---
everyone knows of this bug by now, i was calling you a slowpoke using a meme that died a long time ago
---
A Helpful Hint is "Use Pharma Farmer to get extra meds."
---
Giving away a quest starter is a Spoiler
---
Not an exploit. They never force this. We can all walk away whenever we want: delete the game, install a new game, and enjoy something different.
---
No, I don’t have that saved
---
You're good. You may have revealed part of the quest reward, but you did not spoil the quest itself. That's what I was half expecting to find when I clicked on the post, though. I've gotten the bear, wolf, and chicken mounts as well (which I believe were all associated with the Lying Lowe/other misc. quests. As far as the others, no one knows, yet.
---
I can tell you more when I get home
---
If any public events tell me. No. No one is. 😂
---
Ditto
---
I'm too dumb to bother, well at least that is how I felt months ago.  I don't appreciate any type of a drawback from a buff, so I just avoid them all, mutation or chem.
---
Plenty of classic fallout weapons would be cool to see back here. It's a shame only fallout 4 weapons made it in, and even then some of the more fun stuff got left out
---
Runescape Dharok barrows brother out here infiltrating fallout 76
---
I have killed her well 
---
over 50 times and I do massive dmg so idk
---
Eh spawn campers do deserve it. Stealthboys work from pip boy only, mk 3’s work from the favorite wheel only, and sometimes still don’t work.
---
Well at least for consoles every time it’s several gig of download except the latest The Burrows. That means they keep adding new content (models and textures) into each update. But for renderings of future products? Those are fetched from their server when they are available for sale in Atom shop, there’s no reason for them to show up in clients’ file, especially in-progress versions.
---
just press the button to sort by buildable.
---
Gotcha, Thanks for the help :)
---
\^this
---
But I think it was excluded, for obvious reasons. Praise Atom(s)!
---
I mean I’ve been searching everywhere for these mounted heads and nobody is sharing any information where to start these quests. Lol. Where did you start the chicken one? I don’t have that one
---
Nuke it
---
Yeah, if they did good on them
---
Everyone I know running them has two points in Starched Genes and three points in Class freak.  You basically have to sink five points into luck that I'd just rather spend elsewhere.  But that's just me.
---
if they implement this then what will I god, fuck, damn, &amp; kick the table over going forward?
---
Ikr! There is so much potential with an always online fallout to just dump loads of awesome guns from the older games! The defender was the only one that caught my eye because of the "You will Rebuild!" Trailers
---
Meat hook or d claw gauntlet
---
If you’re on PS4 you can have mine for free
---
Hey no worries I was at work when I posted anyways. I'll add you and catch up another time, ign mpcollins92
---
Not unarmed, but 1 handed
---
Oh well. I’ve been searching everywhere online for these missions and they aren’t anywhere, not even on wiki, so when someone wants to search for “wendigo mounted head” hopefully my post will pop up for that person. Trying to help people. Also there really aren’t any spoilers for this game. There’s no humans and everyone’s dead 🤷🏼‍♀️ lol

Just watched a fight where some one came in at the 10 minute left mark. We still lost but that cryo helped bring it down a lot. we almost won.
---
PC here but appreciate the kind offer!
---
Moderator tagged it.
---
First things coming are weapon racks and bobblehead displays, no date, but thats been one they pointed out in specific
---
It was just hella fucking annoying today when i was modding my guns
---
&gt;A well spec-d level 150 with crazy weapons and armour is going to be extremely difficult to kill
---
Haahaha no. AM players are stupidly EASY to kill, because of the WS exploit heavily favors the attackers and most do not have the top 1% or less gear (that can be by passed anyway)
---
I was running Marsupial, Bird Bones and Chameleon for the longest time and then by a stupid mistake of my own, unequipping Starched Genes, I gained Herd Mentality..and being a solo player that pissed me off so I tried to cure it..and of course cured the other three first, so doubly pissed I've got none now, and it's staying that way :(
---
Sorry man, something came up. If you will be on tomorrow, let me know? I’m off this weekend. Thank you in advance.
---
It does
---
Yes it is! The first time I can be on is Monday afternoon, 445 CST, that work for you? I'll do 95 for you materials, 125 for mine
---
No that is a fallen space station, not an ISS and its signs show it is a vault tech space station so no I in it.
---
I personally like the Ski Sword a little better than the Chinese Officer Sword.
---
fixed.
---
Is it just certain mods? I swear my mods have been working
---
I have always thought this.  Instanced areas for building, housing, etc would be perfect and more importantly relieve server issues.  For me building and decoration are the key areas I would spend Atoms on.  No question.  Skins, costumes, etc are great but once you have that look you are happy with you're not really going to change it too often, hence less purchasing.
---
- Individual large player instanced areas, maybe having Vault 76 as an instanced area and other locations of course.
---
- Guest settings so that others can visit, player building permissions
---
- Additional areas/wings/cellars could be purchased via caps to enlarge the housing area, or Atoms of course, but the game desperately needs a cap sink
---
- Smaller player CAMPS could be retained as they are for defensive purposes or for those that cbf with a larger building/decoration area
---
Oh I didn't think about rad damage. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks!
---
update: reloaded the game and the doors are open
---
Same happened to me but 80% of the robots were legendary. Granted just 1 star but I've never found so many legendaries in a game.
---
Knew I kept that otherwise useless piece if shit for a reason!
---
That bug also only temporarily prevents environmental radiation. Radiation from other sources, such as attacks,  being near glowing ones, etc, still counts, and the bug goes away soon as you die or leave that nuke zone.
---
Yep, happened to me a few times when I was battling the SBQ...... really frustrating
---
Vats critical hits heals your group so it’s only once in awhile not constantly like vampire
---
Yeah that sounds great ill buy 3 of yours
---
excellent still waiting on launch buddy is heading to the control room.
---
It's happened to me recently without power armor (and not over encumbered)
---
Yeah I guess your comment touches on another reason I don't used them.  Just hearing my team mates ***talk about managing mutations*** is enough to give me a headache.  I would never want to actually do it.
---
Still waiting on something to let me transfer items between characters.
---
Juiceeee
---
VERY MUCH SO
---
CF not required if you choose mutations wisely. SG 2 pts alone isn't so bad. That said, nothing wrong with RP'ing no mutations. Just can't do the most damage/etc.
---
Honestly only a few mutations really matter. Those being speed demon, marsupial, and adrenal. The rest are fairly mediocre or very build specific.
---
Ya that’s what I was talking about
---
 I'm not the only person to have done it in less than 10 minutes. My brother did, and I've seen quite a few people on here saying they did. 
---
If you want to attack me over it, find something else to do with your life.
---
Oh i see so it only works when Vats is used? Bummer I have an explosive assault rifle but i never use vats, maybe I’ll just ‘reroll’ it when the legendary vendor comes out lol
---
I think he may mean 'owlet'.
---
It is acquired in the same map as the rest or in Lewisburg train station.
---
So far I have found six and four of them rewarded mounted heads.
---
Yea idk either. Must be a glitch or mod of some kind. But I have no idea.
---
One of my past posts talks about that.
---
It doesn't move when you run into it but it is a solid object and you can stand on it, even in power armor. It's made of some strong string I guess.
---
What did you get for the other two? Perhaps the picnic blanket and what else?
---
debuff weapons, suck for general gameplay but during a raid boss, you want every one you can get. I mean I bring in a suppressors lever action on it, just so the damn thing isn't one shotting people.
---
You do realise that the fire axe isn't modded right? Your looking at potentiality instead of using your eyes. The party display can bug out. Do you want to check the vod and see if I spent time trying to bug out my party? I went in with a stim or two at the beginning, the vod contains all the information you could need with little effort.
---
Want to help me power lvl my alt acc by just running around and killing stuff!?
---
Permissions set by the player.  Access to all, friends or nobody.  Easily done and in fact has already been done in MMOs for decades.  I used to love visiting random player homes in EQ 2 and seeing what they're decoration or getting ideas.
---
I am the same. I love tinkering around in my CAMP, and I love running into other people's CAMPs and seeing how they have their stuff.
---
Yeah it’s definitely an aspect I didn’t expect to enjoy so much. If the game was just this, theirs would be hours of play time there.
---
MMOs having been doing instanced housing for decades.
---
Sure, what's your gt?
---
I did get quite a few 1* legendaries. It was kinda fun to be killing something else there, and their quips about the Grafton monster were funny being so out of place.
---
HOLTZ
---
I use herbivore because the soups also replenish thirst. 5-6 corn soups will keep me all set through about 4 hours of play. I use two ranks of dromedary, so each soup heals around 20-25% thirst. I play a low str sniper, so the lower weight of soup works for me. Also, an uncooked melon heals the same as a soup, but weighs 2lb. I’ll usually pick my two melon patches when traveling back to camp just to fill my hunger/thirst completely.
---
I think you're right with the liberators as the terminal does say the prototype was a failure and improvements would have to be made for v 1-5 but there's a note here
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/We_have_failed that says that they were ordered to disperse into the local population. It furthers my idea that they helped to form the Responders.
---
Here's the transcript.
---
 PRC Scientist: I leave a message for my comrades - assuming any are left. If not, our mission has failed. My only solace is that the capitalist dogs are doomed as well. When the bombs hit, it was clear we had failed the primary directive. Station Chief Xi ordered us to disperse and blend with the local populace.
---
This... has been challenging.
---
I do not understand the people of this country, nor do I care to. I miss my people, the Motherland, and... I grow weary. If I am wrong... maybe it is not too late to advance our work at Fujiniya. I will not be around to find out. Forgive me. Hail the People's Republic! *Gunshot*
---
Do you think this was a false flag?
---
You can craft mods, can't attach mods from kits
---
Picnic Blanket for one of them yep and a couple of chems for the other.
---
You can’t sell things for more than 25k
---
Nice to know, thanks!
---
Oh yeah I forgot that was one of the rewards for one of them. Ughhh I just want queen
---
Don't I love this, I wish I could right now
---
Yeah i meant from kits but nevermind me, i realized i never tried to confirm it since it was worse than whati currently had.
---
Makes you feel like RP
---
It only spins if it is above Shawn’s Crib...
---
Haha man, that would be awesome!
---
Sent a request
---
That's true, and I don't think it should be, which is another reason I avoid other people!
---
Why would anyone do that!
---
I would totally be willing to pay a small fee for my own little vault though.
---
The local copy of the esm doesn't have the SBQ Mounted Head plan linked to anything so unless they are doing some 'trickery' on the server-side esm it cannot be obtained yet.
---
So instead of being a decent person, and moving away from a RARE vendor spawn point, you're just gonna stay there for no reason other than being selfish?
---
I'm guessing they aren't the first, and probably won't be the last. If you set up by the pond...you're going to get negative attention.
---
you on PC? I would buy them **cough** **cough**
---
Mr Handy Buzz blades by far.
---
Cool read, we'll see how close you are when the time comes lol
---
It's asking for trouble camping there, you're blocking a rare vendor spawn.
---
They were doing what now..?
---
Question for the general public, not OP specifically: 
---
When you nuke a queen, I've never not had a bunch of people show up. Is there a thing where if you don't ask for a group, no one shows up?
---
Class Freak isn't always essential. Marsupial's penalty is irrelevant, and Speed Demon's doesn't bother me. I'll probably take it for Adrenal Reaction, but then I can drop Bloody Mess if I'm short on points.
---
Add me another day we can
---
I would like to see the bozar come back as a heavy sniper rifle. Maybe the LSW as well - kind of like the LMG but with a slower rate of fire and higher dmg. Or the gauss pistol! That thing was a really nice mid-end game weapon. 
---
If nothing else, I'd like the alien blaster to be brought back to its former glory. My level 50 converted alien blaster (without any dmg perks) does a solid 15 damage per hit, and has some kind of latency bug where firing too fast will cause it to shoot two projectiles, only the second of which does damage
---
Sorry, ps4 lol. I'm not complaining, but it's weird/creepy. I just looked through my inventory after doing a couple of events and there they were.
---
I would literally forget that food could heal though.
---
I'm not very good at games, please excuse.
---
He'll learn to deal with it, I reckon.
---
**STAND YOUR GROUND**
---
I honestly would be down for this I can just see if someone wants to move it being a problem
---
There is so much potential, and if bethesda ever runs out of new weapons to add, they should totally lean towards some of the classics
---
Meat hook is both.
---
They show up and just start shooting but IM the asshole? Just go to a different server.
---
I give Fosters Beers to guests..
---
Yup! I had this happen before a few times! Legendary lvl 1 eyebots dropping loot...lol Robobrains were the Deathclaw hangs out...
---
You are aware that if you place your camp near that Train Station you stop a rare vendor from spawning (or chance of it spawning) near that train station......?
---
This. The power fist just screams for use with powered armor.
---
Anytime you die your armor automatically unequips, if you're wearing power armor, unyielding armor or anything that boosts your strength you'll lose that and the carry weight bonus so if your over encumbered you'll have to respond at 76
---
 Combat Knife. Absolutely OP. My Serrated one repaired to 200% does around 150 a hit. My Nocturbal 40% Speed one reapaired to 200% does about 185 and melts the Whitespring Ghoul hordes.
---
 Stabby stabby FTW. ;)
---
Couple events, ay? maybe reset the game and see if you still have them. If you still do you could tell support. **OR** keep and sell for caps.
---
Dammit. I didn't know we had to close out to refresh. I was on last night wondering why the new egg wasn't in the shop. Came online tonight and I've missed the egg :(
---
Were you wearing any unyielding armor?
---
No one ever sent me a message asking to move. No one ever tried talking, just shooting. So now I’m never going to move. I’ll block it just to spite them. I will leave a pile of rubble there if I have to.
---
Candy?
---
It's still pretty boring after level 50. Yes there's a few of events to do but they all go really fast so as long as you enjoy grinding for legendaries that's pretty much all that's left.
---
Screw those people stay where your at you ever need help hit me up my psn is gofukyurslf326
---
Just happened to me, kid was proud of himself, sad.
---
Don’t blame me for Bethesda’s bad spawning system. This has been my home since release and I’m not moving.
---
I had that in FO4 with some apparel until I added a 'null' mesh to the 1st person view but never in FO76.
---
Are you 'wearing' anything other than the vault suit?
---
Wow
---
I can hang in survival PVP just fine, I'm still going to pop into adventure and rob you sometimes. These bullets don't make themselves.
---
All. Day. Had a nuke burrows earlier and only got 2 legendaries. 😐
---
Do you understand why people blow up your camp if it’s placed there? You are blocking a random event spawn point.  Not just the rare vender, but a mess of other random events as well.
---
You may have got them from the events? Are they for sell?
---
So? I want it to spin when it's above MY crib too. They have the technology, dammit!
---
Yeah, I was super excited when I got the plans to craft the things and then when I got the prime receiver. Now I have my FU green GL and then my FU SBQ green GL.
---
I actually think it happened at the Encrypted event, as I also got a recall keycard somehow as well. I did have some guy attack me with a deathclaw gauntlet, but everything seemed normal
---
Yea you are. For months people know not to put camps there. You got exactly what you deserved.
---
Same happened to me a couple of weeks back. Got Mechanic, Whitespring, BOS and White Powder
---
Did a ghoul horde event - wrongly killed the boss first ( legendary ) then the others attack . Killed them but the Legendary had disappeared. Now I try to loot the Legendary asap but the others attack and jostle you around.
---
This happens quite often - you get a glimpse of some Legendary weapon and by the time you get back to look for it - it has disappeared. Yet the other POS ghoul bodies are still there.
---
Me playing doesn’t mean I’ll pay them anything which is what they ultimately care about. But the reason I’m a not spending a dime on atoms is they broke their promise on cosmetic only.  
---
The game itself is fun even with bugs and that’s what I care about ultimately. Though I trust they will purposely make it worse once they can sell items that will make the game easier. Which is why I refuse to pay for atoms now cause that is unacceptable to me.
---
Unyielding is amazing if you do do a vats build. Tons of sneak/AP from agi, crit gain and loot condition from luck, Int for faster leveling, charisma for better buy/sell, strength for more carry weight. Vats Gun-Fu with a lever action is a brutal midrange stealth sniper.
---
oh, then yup. you got those legit my guy. go get a lottery ticket.
---
Maybe have the "bunker" not just be a room but a large cavity/space prior to the housing.  So you'd have this area the attacker would start in and the fort that the defender can retreat to.
---
Yes.
---
Dont blame me for Bethesda’s bad coding. If I wasn’t meant to build here then I wouldn’t be allowed to. How about they just server hop to another world where no one built there and not wreck my place huh?
---
No one gives a shit and the people who blew up your house will probably never seen this posy
---
Wearing just the vault suit shows the bug better. But it happens when I have armor on, naked, armor suit and an outfit. No matter what I do, it’s not going away.
---
Get that puncturing mod and go.
---
Server hop. No need to be a dick
---
Ahh, there's your problem, when you die that armor unequips so the strength bonus is taken away and that reduces your carry weight
---
Good luck!
---
You’re not swinging the weapon.
---
No, and I actually haven't heard of those before, I'll look into that
---
Yeah I almost walked away a few times over it! To loose my best gun, now not once but twice blows! I hope they figure it out soon...
---
I could see choosing between premade layouts for the games sake, and then you decorate/fill it how you want to. I'm sure Bethesda would monetize larger sizes on the atomic shop.
---
I am redirecting perks to a melee primary shotgun backup. I like fast stuff like combat knives but they don’t do much damage. Maybe I because I haven’t found a legendary yet. I like ski swords, but the variations of sledge are the most powerful.
---
Its multiplicative. The 5 pieces make you take 75% less. So 25% damage gets through. With 5 assassin pieces, it will take off 40 of the 25 that gets through so you take 15 percent damage from players.
---
Nope. Playstation said they wouldn't
---
 It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature am i right.
---
Deal for sure. I like to kill the adds while everyone else focus on the Queen, and we are both PC, for sure friend, tomorrow morning MTN time
---
...you're blocking the spawn for yourself too, dummy.
---
Your fault with going in with any at all. Your fault for not knowing the meta. Power armour is a huge target. Learn from this instead of moaning
---
What a trash heap..
---
You need to triple check the mods on that.  
---
A standard Railway Rifle only weighs 9lbs to begin with according to the wikis.  Although most legendary weapons come with no mods you can rarely get ones that are already modded. Since the Weightless effect doesn't effect mods a 1lb Railway Rifle can easily reach 6 lbs with mods attached.
---
6 lbs is 2.72 kg
---
I don’t care about the spawn.
---
There's literally no chance you'll ever get that spawn. But stand your ground, brave soul, and lament these unwarranted attacks, shaking your fists are the heavens and asking why? Why me?
---
I used to get frustrated with this - people camping there and blocking the potential vendor spawn (despite claims of the contrary I have never seen a random spawn there if there is a CAMP).
---
Never frustrated enough to actually wreck someone's CAMP; I don't enjoy PvP and I actively avoid it so I thought hypocritical to shun that aspect of the game unless I feel like blowing up someone's home.
---
However I did not know at the time what is now common knowledge: it has a chance to spawn elsewhere - as in 'various other locations' - and as far as I can tell the chance to spawn is not any worse so I no longer get frustrated.
---
OK, is one less 'chance to spawn' per server but to me and in the great scheme of things is just a very minor inconvenience now... and when you are side by side with other humans well, inconveniences do happen.
---
You also sound like an awful flavour.
---
Lots of reasons. 
---
1. Some people don’t think the fight and reward is worth the effort. 
---
2. The high levels are doing other things - trading or grinding or dicking around exploring. And don’t want to be bothered. 
---
3. Need preparation time. Got to repair items, perk loadout. Craft ammo. 
---
I don’t have a group I play with so I post here or Facebook to get people to join. Give at least a 15 min heads up. Always brings a crowd of 10+
---
Your lack of planning is not Bethesda's problem
---
I would imagine they can just build elsewhere but it doesn’t pull from the community one.  But yeah it could maybe make things difficult if not properly planned.
---
I hear what you're saying but it feels like this is a new issue. I'm sure I've been wearing deep pocketed items and the like and haven't had to respawn at 76.
---
PSA on PC the mod better inventory does exactly this, it's really useful.
---
Isn't that part of the survival mode? if you die you lose your aid items?
---
I don’t care about the spawn. I just like the location I have. Maybe if someone had ever asked me nicely to move I would have. But now that’s not an option. If by my camp being there I can waste even a minute of these assholes time. I will.
---
That's not the point... they're saying that their unmodded Weightless Railway Rifle weighs 6lbs and I'm pointing out why as far as the numbers in game go that shouldn't be possible.
---
My point is that there shouldn't be any problem with going in with it. Spending 5 minutes at the start of every session putting away my aid items demonstrates a huge issue. It should take away 5 stimpacks, not all of them. It should take away 5 water, not all of it. Those are rare resources and losing them in an instant is actually dumb.
---
Care to elaborate what other locations this rare vendor spawns at? Cheers :)
---
I do.
---
Whenever I accidentally take Rad-x that I didn't sell yet and go "Crap, not again!". I miss Marsupial, Bird Bones, and Speed Demon about two seconds after it happens.
---
Your purposefully camping in a place you know interferes with gameplay. I agree, no need to be a dick.
---
its griefing 
---
I was not on a survival server
---
Stims and water are the most common in the game
---
Someone yesterday had it too. Title had the word spine in it, I think.
---
It says you lose "some" aid items. But instead it took all of the rarest ones I had.
---
You're an idiot.
---
I do that get one shot and stand there thing, but that is because I am a stealth build holding one of the towers most of the time. Generally I try to get tower one then hide on the roof popping robots with a gauss rifle.  
---
and hitting the ISS with my suppressors lever action when ever I can safely do so.
---
It does though. Ask any farmer that does farming routes on the same server over and over. They aim for about 30-40 minutes per route, so that the first area they clear will have respawned by the time they get back to it.
---
I've done this method myself. I also know for a fact that it does this because I've parked my alt account at West Tek when I was farming West Tek + Harpers Ferry for steel. At one point I took a long time to get back to West Tek due to helping a friend xfer some stuff, and I heard the mutants respawn on my alt (they had a habit of aggroing the bottom of his camp, but couldn't get to him up in the satellite). I checked, no one was present for miles around, and no one killed the mutants. This happened several times, but only when I took more than 30 minutes to get back to West Tek after clearing it.
---
Well, don't complain when karma happens. You'll get no sympathy from the many, many players you do care and choose not to take the choice away from others on a given server. You are the problem here.
---
They kinda suck in pvp, the only good end perk is take less damage from explosives. so most players who aren't fresh from the vault are going to shrug off a lot, even without god tier armor.
---
Organizing by spoil makes things a little easier because food/meat/drinks will always appear at the bottom of the list, but unfortunately you always have to scroll for boiled and purified water...
---
That sucks but it would seem like common sense to take the bare minimum to minimize such loses.
---
You should have read the fine print that was everywhere before jumping. You also shouldn't rely heavily on Power Armor. Regular body armor is 1000x better than Power Armor. Use that shit only in nukes.
---
That part is likely real enough. False flag would be the bots going out.
---
Don't think they integrated, as that note is found on a dead skeleton in a scientist outfit with a 10mm and doctors bag. Took the easy way out. Really don't see how they would have been the ones to "infiltrate", if the one who leaves behind a holotape kills himself over the prospect.
---
  FULLY false flag (entire Mama Dulce being a sham with brainwashed/fooled workers with projects built to fail) just plays into my over arching idea that Vault Tec is the one who "shot first" with the nukes. The mega sized corporations conspired/were used to pull strings all around, using propaganda and boogey man facist tactics for population control. Perhaps the Chinese were a clear and present competitor at one point, but it definitely seems like the Chinese threat was used more against the American people by their own government than the threat itself. From Operation: Anchorage forward, I'm iffy on the truth behind finger pointing and actors.
---
Chinese influence just seems so half baked in Fallout 3 forward (I've only glanced over the original games involvement in the wiki). The theory that for a long while Chinese influence has been bought/paid/faked-ish for population control just like "American" influence makes sense. The Chinese menace is always shown to be a thin cover for the horrors going on in plain sight before the bombs fell.
---
A lot of clues to that theory depend on the sloppiness of Chinese attempts against America throughout the games, along with aesthetic for the enemies/areas. American goods in the "Chinese" F4 submarine for example.
---
Yea, I just had it start happening to me recently. It seems like Bethesda is breaking more and more stuff every update and making the servers more unstable after every maintenance
---
Considering that you got 400 free and the bed is around 400, you just got a free bed instead of free atoms. 
---
You'll be okay.
---
Thats pay to win I’ll pass
---
Dead?
---
I’ve had that spot since release and I’m not moving just because some asshole doesn’t want to server hop one more time. Shooting and not even trying to talk the person first? You’re never going to convince me I’m in the wrong here.
---
Yeah but I shouldn't have to. Taking some aid items should mean 5-10, not all of them. Especially not all of the rarest types there are.
---
Personally I have found him in two 'random encounter' locations:
---
- In the vicinity of Charleston Fire Department.
---
- In one of the two 'spots' (the one 'down the road') next to Lady Janet's Soft Serve.
---
This is by no means a comprehensive list, just the places where I can confirm that I have found him.
---
Yes. You are the problem. If you know you're next to a rare vendor spawn, and you don't move, anyone attacking you is 100% in the right.
---
I keep having this issue with 3 star legendary enemies it seems. :/ Someone said the bodies will appear at their spawn points, but the issue is trying to find the original spawn point... It's often a pain in the ass and impossible sometimes.
---
God I love that combo! Fucking running around in our under pants in a nuke zone, fuck all Yas we got rad sponge and ghoulish 3.
---
You can see this reliably in Harper's Ferry. The ghouls are able to walk straight through any of the larger gates around the city.
---
I just wanted/want people to play with. Nuking the queen was the bait I used for friends l. Queen always gets the whole server in my experience
---
He totally knows, he's doing this to be a dick, and then crying about other people being mean.
---
Don't sell that thing for caps. Caps aren't really worth anything since all the high-end gear is trade only. I'm sitting on 125k caps and can't find anything to spend them on.
---
Server hop. I’m not wrong. The game allows me to build here so I will. If you don’t like it go somewhere else. Anything other than that and YOURE the asshole.
---
Why don't you just, what is it you griefers say? "Get gud"?
---
Purified water and stim packs seem rather common to me, I am only level 23 at the moment but I always seem to have a steady supply. Super stims are rarer.
---
Search.
---
Report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). Be sure to let us know how quickly they ban that mean mean man that busted up your CAMP.
---
Ah, hadn't really thought about it. Whenever I see one there's like 10+ people down there. I'll scrap and dump my junk and head over. Never seen one not have anyone.
---
Dropped bags? no, it despawns.
---
I had one get up, walk off a bridge...and just keep walking? He eventually vanished, but I can say I’ve seen a flying ghoul!
---
I hate them too, makes me lag something awful.
---
"They advertised well geared" 
---
Wrong, they advertised 
---
"The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone" 
---
Its implying that a level 50+ with good gear would be able to take it alone. Not someone with a lvl 15 fire axe and raider PA... 
---
This being a multiplayer game you have much less freedom then you would build wise than in darksouls or the OG fallouts. Its not like you could pick up and use a level 50 shotgun and start using it right away. Or have your Special points all setup for you from the start of the game. Comparing them is like comparing apples to oranges. 
---
But hey thanks for telling me about another bug in this game. Not like that shows how poor BGS can be at designing things.
---
Well you're not really paying anything, like the atoms come from completing challenges and you're just replacing them for caps. You're not necessarily losing or gaining anything, just making them more useful
---
Oh right I thought it was only Graham the vendor and not the Protectron vendor (that I've only see spawn near the train station in question) who spawns around the map, thank you :)
---
Good luck 👍 Hope you have Contractor maxed. 😊
---
I'm kinda done with this "you say bullshit  that you're making up in your own head that doesn't reflect the intended audience of the new content" and "I repeat myself" loop. 
---
have a good day, dude.
---
So this has been happening since release then? And your posting now? There is nothing special or unique about that spot. You could camp 100 ft up the tracks and everything would be fine. Act indignant all you want. After all these months it’s obvious your parking there just to troll people.
---
Griefers are the problem. I just wanted a good location for my camp. You want a rare spawn? Go somewhere else.
---
You can buy atoms with real money, if you can buy caps with atoms,  then you can buy high cap items with real money
---
Just because you can do something, doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. The people attacking your base are allowed to do it, it doesn't mean that's the right thing to do, either. 
---
I've never attacked another person's base. But you know you're ruining people's experiences there, and are doing it to feel like a martyr.
---
The issue is how DR works though. If you make something do split damage, each portion will do less than if it was one single hit. Take a look at https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance . This is for Fallout 4, but 76 is very similar, if not identical.
---
So say you do 50 damage per shot against a target that has 50 armor with one gun, and 25 damage x2 wit ha different gun.
---
50 armor gives 50% damage reduction against 50 damage, so 50 damage ends up doing 25.
---
50 armor gives 61% damage reduction against 25 damage, so 25 damage ends up doing 9.7.
---
The end result is that the gun that does 50 damage per shot winds up doing 25 damage in the same amount of time that the gun that does 25 damage per shot x2 does 19.4 damage. That means that the gun that does 50 damage per shot is doing roughly 22% more damage than the gun that does 25 damage per shot but fires twice as fast.
---
See the problem? If you split the damage you're nerfing the damage in a huge way, since most enemies in Fallout 76 have equal amounts of energy and physical DR. Armor penetration won't help here, unless it's 100%, at which point it doesn't matter at all - the only stat that would matter is DPS, however, that isn't possible without an AA weapon, and AA weapons are inferior to Bloodied in terms of raw DPS (by a lot).
---
Stash em
---
I’m parking there because l like the spot and no other reason. Any chance there was of me moving is gone now though. If I move now then the assholes who destroyed my base without warning will win.
---
Again, good luck 👍
---
Hope everything works out for you.
---
This defeats pretty much the entire purpose of the game...
---
Yah I’m lvl 29 and I went to Watoga and a couple of other places and I can’t find the plans unfortunately
---
Great! I might need to get more flux, so swing by at 530-45?
---
Pleasure.
---
I’m not ruining anyone’s experience when they could just go to another server. What did destroying my base accomplish? Nothing. They did it just to be dicks. I didn’t move. They didn’t gain anything.
---
thank you it's good to know I wont change it then I'll stick with  what I've got. thanks again.
---
Sure i might have some for you i can check if not ill pay extra if you have to get some
---
Sorry for format, on mobile
---
Bottom Text
---
****UPDATE**** I legit hit level 30 and went back to Watoga and it appeared finally, thanks y’all for the help
---
You can rename items!  FYI
---
If you had any idea how many times I had to server hop that spot trying to get that vendor for the first time, and repeatedly saw the camp for the lower level character I explained why he was in a bad place and it'd be nice if he would be willing to move, you might understand why you being there causes people frustration. 
---
I wonder if it was you.
---
The force is strong in this one
---
No one has ever messaged me about my camp being there. Ever.
---
Yeah just add me man, I play too much so I’ll probably be on lol
---
Thanks, I’ll look into those 3 edits
---
Yup. I somehow lost both arm pieces last night. I know I didn't sell them because I do not sell 3\* pieces. So they are just \*poof\*, gone.
---
The scenarios you keep referring to don't qualify as griefing. Look up the definition.
---
 I'm not robbing you for bragging rights; I'm taking your stuff, I'm making bullets, and I'm going back to survival.
---
Better inventory is amazing! I can play without it (unlike perk loadout Manager) but I sure miss it!
---
Ew no, cant go back to normal speed and jumping, not to mention stimpal use!
---
I’d buy the recipes off the market then, it’s so much cheaper than Modus. When I think of how many caps I wasted with my first character buying stuff from him... ugh. Marsupial rocks and I cannot play without it!
---
Really? You like that spot so much you’ve been there for 5 months? This is no different from the guys who camp at white spring. If you really been playing since BETA you know better. There are like three unwritten Fallout 76 rules
---
Don’t CAMP at white springs
---
Don’t CAMP at Charleston. 
---
Don’t pick on the low levels.
---
No but really, Cranberry Cola? Sounds very bitter.
---
Sadly yes. They've known about it for a week and a half, and have not fixed it.
---
Look at GTA V for an example of how this works.
---
That is bizarre... Is like you have 'ribcage and spine' mesh attached front-to-back to your character model.
---
I have not the foggiest how that happened.
---
Maybe one of those has a 'glitched' ARMO record? Wild guess at this point...
---
There's one released daily around 8 PM EST. There's six total. I doubt they will implement a re-release. They may do a limited buy-the-one-you-missed-with-atoms kinda thing, but I am doubtful of that. Nothing else is known. Guessing the prize has to be Easter-themed, though.
---
Cryolator and flamer won't. Tesla guns, laser/plasma rifles, gatling lasers/plasmas. I'm actually not sure about the gauss rifle, it counts as an energy weapon for the grounded mutation but it shoots bullet projectiles
---
No, go away
---
Uhhh.... do you even understand the question you’re asking? Let me rephrase my answer- your FO76 key is bound to your bethnet account.
---
Nothing to manage when you can just buy the ones you want for cheap. Marsupial alone makes navigating Rocky terrain or hopping out of trouble a breeze.
---
Never played GTA V, so not sure how I could look at it.
---
Miss it? I'm using it right now.
---
It's a new random event. They are teasing the real Sheepsquatch showing up
---
But if everyone has the same bunker, it's just instanced for each player...I guess I don't play enough online games to know how this sort of thing works.
---
Sorry for the potato quality. If you look closely there’s a bloody gash where the mismatched head and body meet
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/2fA8HCT](https://imgur.com/gallery/2fA8HCT)
---
He was probably muling items with his friend, and when power went out they both got disconnected
---
There could be like, screens, that show "outside", instead of windows. That might be neat.
---
I haven’t had this issue until the other day. Saw other people talking about it but I wasn’t having any issues. Then, I went to mod a Machete and couldn’t equip the mod, and today, I tried to mod some PA and the same thing. Really sucks.
---
Awesome tyvm that covers everything but the gauss 👍 appreciate it

I was on a level 20 character. I build my camp in the same place on all my characters. How’s this for a rule? Don’t destroys someone’s base without warning? How about not sneaking up on someone while they’re doing crafting and blow them away and take their stuff? How bout that for a little common decency? You can’t go to another server. I’ll never get the time it took getting those materials back.
---
I know it's real, but DAMN that's evil and corrupt. I saw a cops episode from the 90's where they were sting operating to bust guys buying $20 in pot. They were openly discussing the asset seizure goals they had. They set the sting so people would make the purchase from the driver seat of their car SOLELY so they could seize and auction the car. Disgusting.
---
No, its fine
---
Who are the beach boys?
---
im just leery when i see anyone
---
the hell are you  doin over by that tire you sketchy piece of shit YEAH IM WATCHING YOU
---
You set up your camp right on top of a possible spawn point for a special vendor that sells outfits exclusive to it. The random encounter can't happen if someone has a camp there.
---
Better stockpile on mats to repair your camp if it's staying, as you're going to get other players demolishing it more often than usual.
---
Haha sorry, poor phrasing. When patch 7 hit and broke perk loadout Manager, I stopped playing until it was fixed. Better Inventory is amazing and I love it, but I can play without it I have to- I would miss it, but I’d survive. Not having perk loadout Manager is waaaay too annoying.
---
I saw a radstorm today.  I ran out into the wilderness seeking a glowing ghoul, but there were none.  That was *maybe* the tenth radstorm I've seen since beta.
---
Of course you loose your shit, just like it will for you the 50% of the time  the game crashes while you're there.
---
People can make beauty from trashes, so it's totally possible.
---
Bethesda is a US company in Maryland with 7 servers hosted in US, 5 servers in Western Europe, and 5 servers in Asia (cloud servers). Also, if have friends in the US, you can see that their servers are always populated with players compares to servers in Europe and Asia - each in their peak time. Also, I am sure you notice that their online store ship their goods only within US. If majority of players are not from US, it only makes sense to obtain licenses overseas and ship Internationally for greater revenue. I hope this educates you.

1. Note that this is a video recording with a voice chat. Not just a voice chat. When people use their mic, their *ign shows up on the screen when they talk*. Server logs contains information for synch such as timestamp of login, coordinates, etc. It is very simple to cross reference. In fact, many people get arrested over game voice chat and that is how authorities used to track them.
---
2. I fail to understand your level of argument. Feminist groups have a lot of firepower with their own lawyers (hint: non-profit). I also use lawyers all the time for my business. They are the best people that you can use to defend your rights and saving you a headache. They are affordable. Google "sexual harassment lawyers". There are plenty of them with affordable rates.
---
Boone for my sniper build
---
Look at item weight, look at bulk quanity and bulk weight in Tinkers.
---
I have bought atoms once, the $5 pack.
---
Thanks for the compliment
---
If I can hold a gun, why cant I hold my death tambo!!
---
in the 400 some hours I've played, I have seen just one rad storm.
---
One.
---
Jesus. Do you just hear new terms and repeat them until other pick up on it, and then go back to snarky until you find a new one? How exactly does one compare communism to capitalism? That's like comparing buses to roads. And what about it would be wonderful? People are "more equal" because people are not equal. No dictator need decide this, nature does. Reality does. Reality. You know, reality?
---
This has been widely reported I've seen. I stashed all my top tier gear until this gets hashed.
---
Do you have a plan for the toilet, and if so are you on xbox?
---
I agree 1000 but no more there has too be some oraganisation of what you really need instead of dump and run X infinity
---
I should, and I am. Lemme check
---
lol
---
How much for the radium?
---
Missing Floral, sir.
---
I guess i'm lucky, my camp hasn't moved in 2+ months and i've had no issue
---
Fortunately it wasn't like crazy amazing stuff, it was just a Chameleon random stuff and a Auto-Stim random stuff.  But yeah, I was crouching and not going all Chameleon, and was wtfing and realized both arms were gone. I don't even. :(
---
I have Flower, Patterened, Speckled, and now pink.
---
Pieces of cheating, glitching, griefing shit.
---
Half damage double weight
---
You might be nuking the "wrong" space. Even though nuke zones are still ez regardless, it's possible to nuke it with fissure site prime being on the edge of the circle so you fight the queen without rads. So nowadays a minor inconvenience is too much for people so they won't bother unless it's done according to the meta
---
They failed to do quality control on released product? -fake gasp-
---
My friend wants to join so I'm helping him
---
Again, you just made up 50% of the Fallout community, so who?
---
Two...hours?  How did you find enough content for twenty minutes let alone two hours?????
---
I’m a good guy. I help the low levels. I’ve given away quality legendaries. Ive given away thousand of pieces of armor, guns, junk and ammo. I don’t kill people on survival unless they are actively partaking in PvP.  Im sure you’ve done the same. Despite this, whenever I see someone camped at Charleston or WS, I stop whatever I’m doing. And level it. The only thing special about this spot is it stops the legendary vendor spawn. Your trolling brother.
---
I'm not trying to join. My friend is
---
If you play at 4am it's quite possible to fight a queen on your own.
---
Otherwise, you really want people who are willing to spend the ammo, rather than just popping in to see how it goes. Randoms are usually fine, but sometimes they're not.
---
That sucks good luck
---
It's 20hrs from the last time you made purchases/sold so if you sold to a vendor at 10pm caps will be availible at 6pm the next day.
---
Love it
---
What.
---
Oh, gotcha. I've found modding in general to be almost essential for Bethesda games I hope the current stance doesn't change.
---
Mmmmmm... Bitters.. I wouldn't mind.
---
Is vats a viable option at range? Whenever I've used it its been saying like 40% for torso hits :P
---
Were they renamed by any chance?
---
I haven't failed to kill the queen since December, people showing up have lately led to it still getting killed. Specifically I'm just saying I play on Pc and want people to play with
---
great, been looking high and low
---
Power armor is trash and for nuke zones only. ......if you know survival drops aid why would you go in with all your stims? No one cares, especially the devs about your lost aid.
---
Thanks, wasn't aware it was on a 20 hour window
---
It's a feature!
---
Okay thank you, I thought I had heard something this week but wasnt sure if it applied to what I was trying, obviously it did :(
---
High levels don't need bullets?
---
Yes 1,000%! Back on Fallout 4 I was suprised there wasn't a Terminal entry journal mechanic.
---
With Fallout 76 Bethesda should definitely add this in! Especially if they're going to be adding in Faction content down the line.
---
No, but I don't sell 3\*s ever, so it's not an accidental sell.
---
Ok, I don’t have the plan, but I know it, and will gladly build it for you. GT TheGr8Nekodamus I’ll be on for the evening in 30 minutes or so (just off work)
---
👍
---
Looks like bumbling moron on r/fo76 doesn't realize how many people are farming karma with this
---
The trolls are the ones who destroyed my base. I’ll leave my c.a.m.p. There now though, won’t build anything, just make sure the spot is always claimed with nothing to destroy. All because people like you can’t help yourselves and ruin the game for other people. I didn’t start this, remember that next time you go to Charleston.
---
I liked slither though
---
Not sure that word means what you think it means, in relation to the game. Blowing up camps is not very nice but it certainly is not griefing, in either game mode.
---
Everything happens locally on your machine then tells the server what has taken place, been crafted, picked up, damage taken etc etc.
---
Praise be!
---
Hmm? That is weird. I've noticed the survival icons playing up a bit too but usually only showing people in different positions than the leaderboard indicates.
---
Continue on then
---
I love most of you in this game, but its the few douche bags that just suck.
---
Yeah, it sucks. Hopefully they get around to it soon.
---
Play the victim.
---
I’ve seen 3* hit 25k in auction.
---
I wasn't implying they were sold by accident. I was curious if renaming items has anything to do with them disappearing.
---
They dont work on PC either.....
---
Trolling isn’t destroying someone’s camp. Trolling staying somewhere or doing something just to piss people off.
---
I'd rather have a picture of a one-legged dwarf outrunning Hussein Bolt than most things.  That sounds epic!
---
I have no idea, but I thank the Todd. I'm on satellite and often can't play online games at all, and besides a slight lag, 76 is very playable.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I prefer the plan; this way if i build a new base I won't be stuck.
---
On PS4 and I also sell all plans I have found for 50 Caps no matter what they are and I haven't gotten any complaints as well
---
I would donate so many damn plans and recipes to other players if I could mail them shit.
---
I’m going to leave my camp but have no buildings so there’s nothing to destroy. It’s my spot and I’m not going to let some asshole bully me into giving it up just because he wants an outfit. Go to another server.
---
Ah. I've renamed everything once I got another set off an alt, just to see if it does help. Hopefully it does, somehow, magically, lol.
---
Like, get it started by say, someone who has never done it before?  Because I have not.
---
Was he at the Event part? If so, he just needs to run the event; the quest is pretty much over at that point.
---
Well, at least what is left of it.  It's in the north east part of the map.  It is kind of underwhelming.  ;p
---
Me too. I'm tired of getting 60 single action ivory grips.
---
Yeah I lost 2 excavator arms then it took a calibrated leg the today. Looks like I'll be farming flux again ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I, too, seek the answer to this.
---
I just stick with marsupial and plague walker without investing in class freak. Plague walker doesn't have any negative effect aside from the fact I can't pacify animals, and I can deal with -4 intelligence that comes with marsupial. This way I don't have to invest as quite many perks into luck. Works well for me.

---
Weird.
---
I am too ignorant to what that is, so I suspect I’m not doing it. I do have a fast gaming laptop... if my combo was a fast internet connection but slow computer, it might not run as smooth.
---
I'm stuck on this as well. I'm at the Grafton Dam and have found all five clues -- they are all in my inventory -- but the quest progress says "Search For Clues (4/5)", so apparently one of them didn't register when I picked it up.
---
The fix prevented bulk from automatically being used when you needed to make something.  Which would be fine by me.  I sell bulk.  If someone can't figure out that you need to leave some resources "raw" then they don't need to be playing a game that relies so heavily on resource management.
---
Days 1-4. Don’t know what to do if you missed one.
---
Can we talk about? Yes. There's been a new Thread about it every hour for the last week. Thanks for your contribution
---
lol that's nuts
---
He was doing the main questline for it.
---
If I find one before you do, you got dibs, pal.
---
im so sorry for your loss
---
A handmade rifle weighs 18 lbs or more, just about as much as a f-ing grenade launcher.   Stupid.    You're absolutely right, but they'll evaluated it and make everything worse.
---
18 lbs is 8.17 kg
---
Thanks, much appreciated.
---
So he untracked it in the middle?
---
They destroyed my base to piss me off. My motives were purely for having a camp I liked. People like you are the ones driving me to stay now though. I won’t leave BECAUSE people destroyed my base. That’s all there is to it.
---
I didn't for a long time, but I do now. I just enjoy hopping around like a weirdo, what can I say?
---
honestly bethesda or us fans should make a nuka cola cranberry video with the vault boy
---
I'd pay a small amount of Atoms for this emote.
---
Buy talk do you mean post the same opinion that's been expressed every 15 minutes for the last week?
---
Yes, and hes trying to get it to activate so he can finish ot. But its not showing up in his pipboy at all.
---
I think it's the gate to get to the event. Odds are someone already opened it each time you got there. I might be wrong
---
I must be so confused because theres a gate that says it needs the Old Burrows Tunnel Key to open, I couldn’t locate it but stumbled across the gate randomly open upon going back to it.
---
Am I dumb? Or just not discovering something that everybody else has?
---
Yeah, I don’t think so. You don’t need that key to get into the event.
---
Let the feast begin?
---
They didn’t destroy your base to piss you off. They destroyed your base because since beta you’ve been camping at one of only two places on the entire gigantic map that pisses people off. One of only two places ON THE ENTIRE GIGANTIC MAP.
---
I have an alt that has yet to start it. I’m on Xbox. When I have the availability to do so, we can team up and get we done. GT TheGr8Nekodamus. Can’t promise when I can do it, but at least it’s an option?
---
Other games ive played would inbox you the crystals or whatever when they fuck up and you miss out on something. I'm not holding my breath here
---
HEY BETHESDA, BY NOW ITS OBVIOUS YOUR TEAM RUNNING THIS GAME DOES NOT HAVE A FUCKING CLUE!  WHY DOES EVERY UPDATE BRAKE THE GAME MORE THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE PATCH.  HEY TOM, ARE YOU LISTENING? HEY TOM, WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO ATTACH MODS TO PA? Also, are you hiring because I'd love to work somewhere you don't have to be accountable for your work.  YOU ALL REALLY, REALLY SUCK AT YOUR JOBS!
---
You can but it requires multiple characters, sometimes multiple players.
---
And a fuck ton of trust.
---
Do you think that you could locate that gate again if you went back? A screenshot would be helpful, or if you’re in xbox, you can show me personally. The Old Tunnel Key is in the makeshift throne room.
---
Fallout 76 really makes you FEEL like RP
---
We dine on the bones of the false prophets and wash their marrow down with the blood of the treacherous.
---
The entire gigantic map, but the only place I like. Go to a different server. There’s no reason to destroy my base other than to be a dick. Destroying it isn’t going to solve anything.
---
Good lord that could be an entire subgame.  I'd actually carry a fat man if I could "pull the pin and throw that f-er" on occasion.  It would be worth the splash damage / radiation / likely death in some situations and not having to carry that damn launcher.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLv3GlMjl7E
---
how far along in the quest was he ? like specifically which part
---
THE MECHANIST!
---
thanks then Im good so far ill grab nr 4 after some sleep. :3
---
Lol beach boys are you kidding those guys are so sad.
---
Best part is you can't even mod PA stuff too. Guh.
---
Also take your time exploring, no need to rush through. Appalachia is a beautiful wasteland :)
---
I agree that your title isn't a spoiler, but what kind of logic is spoilers don't exist because there are no humans.
---
My friend want to join so I'm helping him. Idk who they are
---
There are two kinds of lag. One is performance lag, based on your computer specs and how well it can process the game. The other is connection lag, based on how quickly you can send/receive information to the server. The majority of stuff is done on your computer's end; you load in to the world map, give commands to access things or use items/weapons, etc. The server stores a couple things like inventories and loot, enemies, etc. But basically it's just the server sending you a very small amount of data about a couple variables that your computer then turns into what you see. For example, the server just sends you the info that 4x (enemy ID) spawned at (enemy spawn point closest to you) with level scaling (quantity). Your computer takes that info and turns it into four max level scorched.
---
you get them from doing distant thunder event and digging up maps mainly ..there are other ways but those are the main 2
---
I would love that on my male character for my ‘’Lucifer’’ build. Maybe I can get two horns on my forehead aswell.
---
Do the right thing brother. Your interfering with gameplay. You know you are which makes it worse. Your the troll under the bridge not letting anyone pass cause it’s your bridge.
---
Well just saying ur friend may need some serious help.
---
Yeah I got a 3* power fist that I was bummed I can't use in PA.
---
They are the punchline in most of my packs jokes
---
If he was at the part of the quest-line that lead you up to where the event takes place, the quest kind of just abruptly ends. At this point, it wants you to trigger the event. I would also check to see if the quest is marked as finished in his pip-boy (it would appear greyed out w/ no quest description). If that's not the case, and it actually glitched out, it could be the quest itself. I get miscellaneous quests that re-appear and bug out all the time. 
---
I would put a support ticket through to see if it's something Bethesda can/has to fix.
---
Ok
---
Cloud servers with synchronization to text logs. Because it is just alphanumeric, it happens very fast as the total packets are small. Also, with a cap of 20 players per server (or instanced server), bottleneck can be managed. Problems with lag happen when there are too many instances per server.
---
I can’t now. If I move, then they won. I will not let my base have been demolished for nothing. I’m not the bad guy. I just wanted a good spot. I won’t reward the players who destroyed my base by giving them what they want. Just server hop and move on.
---
The last couple patches have been increasingly bad.  I'm to the point where if I eat something or drink something too quickly my client freezes up.   Other times, I just try to read a note and I get the instafreezes.  These freezes don't even let me alt tab out. I  have to bring up the task manager and the task manager has to be configured ahead of time to be "always on top" in order for me to kill Fallout and relaunch it.  So annoying and way too often.
---
For the purpose of the challenge, it's gonna be Hussein.
---
They are 7 billions people on this planet, he exists I assure you.
---
All you gotta do is find him, in a radstorm.
---
Gauss is affected. Iirc.
---
It’s not about winning and losing. Your actively and purposefully interfering with gameplay.
---
There are always a few malcontents, but they are a very, very small minority.  Those of us who have been playing for launch have created a sort of informal community, even if we never talk to each other.  We offer gear, ammo, etc. to those we see taking the plunge, hoping they have as much fun as we do.
---
It's not in the game yet as an enemy you can fight, but the event hints at it and we know it will attack you at some point. The visuals already exist too, dataminers showed us what it will look like. Defense events are bugged so that they will sometimes display a sheepsquatch attack.
---
[This happened to me a few hours ago](https://imgur.com/RwjXMz2)
---
Party CAMP?
---
Yeah no. I don't enjoy PVP, but I carry orbital strike beacons _explicitly_ for sacks of shit like you.
---
Digital clock should show time.
---
Exact same experience for me. They were all the rage, then dissapeared on xbox. I never see them anymore. I'll still see camps in the spot, but all the firepower is either off or not there.
---
Not sure if dudes got the message that it's a dick move and are playing more considerately or they were just relentlessly greifed into cutting that shit out.
---
He's intentionally blocking a rare vendor spawn and deserves what he gets.
---
What house? Isn't there a hedge maze there?
---
If that would be the case, I definitely wouldn't mind a trip to Mason to visit Kings Island
---
They. Shot. First. THEY actively and purposefully interferes with MY gameplay. If anyone had messaged me and asked me to move I might have. But now I never will. Shouldn’t have wrecked my shit. Fix your shitty behavior and maybe someday I’ll move.
---
Works fine for me on xbox, what platform are you on?
---
Xbox
---
Agree that this is exactly p2w. Instead, maybe offer plans in a rotation for rare items bought through the store that are in-game but stupid rare (hunter’s long coat, marine combat helmet, etc.) 
---
Honestly though, just wait; I bet they implement drop buffs at some point.
---
Someone's inventory lost them, and they showed up in yours. This buggy sack of shit of a game's been doing this since launch.
---
Well the gate I went through must have been something to do with the quest line because I had to go through it to actually complete it. Like I said, I must not be seeing what everyone else has seen
---
The idea of the mistress of mystery items is that you can level them up as you play. You get them at whatever level you were when you finished the quest. It's a shame you can't do it with other quest rewards, but it is what it is. The fixer is locked to its level even if you finish it at 300.
---
\*sniffles\* Thanks, I think?
---
Agreed.
---
I mean it happens. The book actually has a lot of inaccuracies since they changed so much. Like the Penetrator perk
---
[](/celestiafrown)I've run myself ragged on screws replacing missing PA pieces. For the life of me I don't think I accidentally scrapped them, but I suppose I must have. It's especially bad since I really rely on the +100 carry weight from excavator to haul my arsenal around. Lots of over encumbered hobbling to the nearest PA station (to the amazing people who leave their bases open so I can use your crafting you're, the best, I hope you like the gifts I leave).  
---
The ability to lock items would be a total godsend.
---
Unfortunately, you would quickly see a bunch of Eyebots running around screaming hateful rubbish.
---
Maybe instead it could play a standard advertising message, and players could interact with it and it would put a marker on their map for the owner's CAMP or current location or something.
---
Cool ty
---
I have found more shiny pokemon than I have seen rad storms
---
Ok thanks
---
Honestly thats exactly what it was probably. Because thats where he was at when he accidentally untracked it. Its not showing up in the pipboy at all like it doesnt exist kinda thing.
---
He was at the shack where you start the event.
---
Not to mention the idle sound of the rocket.
---
It did.  Thanks.  That reclaimed about 5 lbs. of Stash!
---
Harpers ferry has a bunker for the secretary of interior. I cant believe they did burrows instead.
---
Theres many great places they could use that hasnt been included on the map!
---
Can you even get a second garb, or blade??
---
I didn't figure out the "level a stat point and pick a card from a different stat" till much later on. I forget that sometimes they neglect to tell you things in game
---
I leveled up over level 76, in Whitesprings, with a sword. Dingdingding!
---
Only from another player/find one in a shop that another player sold! Pretty awful
---
Find your friends become storm hunters hunt a rad storm disband the team slap eachother once than photos away. Its that simple. 
---
Embrace the enviroment learn how it works, watch the clouds enjoy the sceneries. 
---
I mean you can see a nuke from the other side of the map go off and you can sure as hell see a rad storm rolling in as wel. Not somthing you wanna fast travel for tho since it moves with the weather. 
---
Anybody know the weather algorithms yet or is it on a set clock?
---
Yeah I  created it on my birthday and made a post about it and got a great turnout. I've been keeping it going whenever I can get on :)
---
Um u know the beach boys are a group of 8  and 9 year old little girls right? Or is that why your "friend" wants to join them?
---
Ooh I needa get me that egg #4
---
This is their intended balance though.  Melee, shotguns and heavy weapons are all under Strength.  The practical result is that a player can't excel at more than one of these at any given time.  You have to pick and choose.  I'd love for my Bloodied Gatling Gun to do more damage, but it would mean sacrificing the melee damage I specialize in.
---
Likewise, perks like Martial Artist are the "cost of doing business" with melee.  You don't have to worry about ammo and you hit like a truck.  Something has to counterbalance it.
---
I've seen this same post like 40 times
---
I've stock piled a shit ton of 250 or more cap value plans in my stash. Gonna have one hell of a sale off when player vending arrives. The lower tier plans I just put in cash registers, or overseers stash box for other players.
---
Liberty prime vs SBQ
---
Sledgehammers are heavy. Pointed sticks are light. They do their damage differently. 
---
Weapons should be balanced with weight in mind, but designers should also consider damage per hit, DPS, armor pen, range, accuracy, mods, perks, legendary affixes and player expectations.
---
Creeper alert
---
Well sure... anythings easy when you're bottlenecking enemies so they only really reach you one at a time and then stagger lock those that reach you with blocks...
---
More perception=more vats accuracy. Concentrated fire also boosts hit chance on subsequent shots. I can hit headshots pretty regularly at max VATS range- I’ve got about 34 Perception on my bloodied Unyielding VATS stealth sniper. 15 base, 15 Unyielding, 2 from herd mentality, 2 from gear. Combine that with 34 Luck (same sources) and I have a crit every other shot. 
---
If I miss the first shot, the next is almost always on target thanks to concentrated fire- and crits will take a 1% shot to 100%, and since I gain crits so easily? Well. Yeah.
---
Or BDO
---
I’m just waiting around for the legendary vendor because it seems like it’ll be the only way I will get good gear.
---
Yeah, I don't think they formatted the end of the quest properly. Mine just kind of disappeared after arriving at the final location. If the quest is finished, it should look like this:  [https://imgur.com/a/YmvkPc1](https://imgur.com/a/YmvkPc1)
---
It does, but it's  happening a lot more than i'd be happy with, as a publisher, around this game.
---
Are they getting larger every day?
---
The two main difference here, 
---
a. MMO are generally running on set hardware, someone in a instanced house is still running on said hardware, Bethesda is setting up cloud instances.
---
B. MMO are generally designed to BE MMOs not a single player game turn into one.
---
Last i saw was around 15k
---
Dude I doubt we'll ever see anything from New Vegas, Todd Howard is 100% still salty he can't make something that good.
---
Seem like it, but its maybe how I had the camera situated.
---
I have seen a few radstorms, but they are few and far between, and they pass very quickly. That alone makes it challenging.
---
Yea man i lost some teddys from my collection in sure i had them all and when i checked some gone missing.
---
Nobody knows when or ever that this will happen.
---
Im a sniper, so i focus semi auto rifles early with perks. That means when it gets close i need a speed tapper lol. Mine was a pipe pistol w rifke stock and speed receiver but the .38 just has no stopping power so now im rockin a pipe revolver with full stock, short scope or reflex, large bayonet for the bash, and short or medium barrel. Its less of a speed tapper and more of a two hit quit  but im only level 17 so thatll change im sure. Its a trooper with plumber perk.
---
Some are east of the Wavy Willard’s water park (big gator up north).
---
Oh yeah? Were you doing the Encrypted event?
---
Dang that sucks I loved playing my friends couldn’t get me off the game to play any other game for months and then I stole items from diapers and dropped them 5 mins later I have been banned for over 2 months
---
I'm on Xbox, my base has no doors, I'm N of mothman town on a junk extractor.
---
My connection is great and stays constant, it’s just slow. And I have a gaming computer that’s very fast. Makes sense. Thanks.
---
You’re yelling at Bethesda on a fan site. Your just wasting time, if you want to give feed back go to the Bethesda forums.
---
Yea they do suck a big one. Love how they msg one on one no stealth boys and as soon as u fight they pop stealthboys. ... to chicken @#$!  To follow to survival
---
Current glitch with all stand alone armor and weapon mods. Just have to wait until its fixed.
---
I think it's still just aluminum and lead. Don't think they ever changed
---
Wait, they give loot?
---
It’s been crashing a lot for me no matter what I’m doing on xbox
---
Shits disappearing, robot suicide bug ruined burrows for me, entering radio research lab crashes the game, its friday so gangs of young dupers are griefing in abundance...rough time today.
---
This is the correct answer. Got a chance to run an unmolested Burrows and the old key is used to unlock the steel "jail" door leading to the catacombs section that brings you to the robots.
---
Okay mr. Always on reddit
---
But that's the thing, they DIDN'T balance according to any of that and weight aside neither of these weapons are all that different from each other. 
---
With the only mods available to either of them the Sledge is only 4% stronger, lacks the armor penetration of the Pole, they both share the same attack speed (slow) and range and benefit from the same perks and yet you could almost carry around three of the Poles to switch off every time one breaks for the weight of a single Super Sledge.
---
By the same logic of "well pointed sticks are light" if that pointed stick is doing the same damage as a rocket propelled sledge hammer something is seriously wrong.
---
Cry about it lmao
---
That’s shit left over from FO4, there’s no evidence it’s new content for 76
---
done deal
---
i don't actually care of you want to destroy my camp
---
but if you try and touch my decon arch then im just going to kill you over and over.
---
Someone picked on me im gonna pick on everyone. 😂
---
Makes me wish I played on PC..sigh
---
Ok Thank you 👍
---
because... optimize the space god damnit!!!!
---
Shit, I still spawn in every game with the excavator power armor that gives me an additional 100 carry weight until I exit for crafting.
---
Just so everyone is aware until this is patched: try it out.
---
I agree - they need to upgrade the stash space via perk cards, or dlc BUT...
---
Until then, take advantage of the slight ‘exploitative’ content that shows itself as you game 👾👌🏻🍾🍀
---
With adrenal it doesn't matter on a low health build
---
Username checks out.
---
Have the security bots treat camps.
---
as hostile
---
It's happened to me twice, both times in the past two weeks. It was a power fist and excavator armor. It looked pretty sweet! I thought it was the best change ever but I think it's just a visual glitch. My guy was still throwing the regular unarmed combos with right and left swings
---
I’m talking about power armor does that count to
---
You made someone smile for 3 seconds, partially. You're doing great work. Keep it up.
---
Please make side item icons visually stand out or larger
---
The ironic thing is it was gamer tag before the 3rd one grew. Karma is a bitch
---
Same here...missed #2 before I found out we had to refresh. Kinda bummed.
---
I can make that and every other power armor mod in the game that has a plan available. Emergency Protocols are 1500. Wouldn’t be able to do it til tomorrow afternoon though. PSN is Josh87r if interested.
---
Yes. All armor and weapon mods. Power armor is armor.
---
Ok awesome. It looks the coolest of almost all of them. But good deal.
---
Maybe you were on rad x or rad away. I think one resists diseases so maybe it resists mutations too
---
Ok thank you
---
&gt; Actually, that reminds me...Do you have any idea WTF the stingwing barb is for?!
---
Lockjoint Syringe or acid.
---
You're not really up to date on things are you?  This is literally the meaning of pay to win.  You could use you real money to buy atoms to buy caps, to buy literally ANYTHING in the game.  But.... P2w is really here cuz I could offer real money for a weapon on eBay, or other pay thing. "I'll give you $10 for that tse!"
---
Th...that’s it?
---
It was better but it seems that it returned since last patch.
---
Get a few workshops on a friday night, its their natural prey. Helping low levels is a lot more rewarding tbh, their duping and griefing seems so boring.
---
Thank you for demonstrating how to get them not to listen to you.
---
I'm a kid but sometimes sound older than I am cause adolescent junk but try to be a good player
---
*if* that is the reward, what the fuck did you want? It's a free, fun little scavenger event through a subsidiary Atom Shop thing. 
---
I swear the entitlement some people expect from this game is absurd.
---
I normally would go for the whole sack hood with Suspenders &amp; Slacks look. It fits the deranged farmer style.
---
Especially if you just placed a hatch frame or doorway/frame/some wall against the mesh of the world and have your bunker anywhere.
---
Make it so it’s very expensive to move so you still retain the camp as a kind of FOB/ or, what it actually is - a camp.
---
Each with unique themes. Id buy one.
---
Just make it so you can’t enter it if you are in combat - like with fast travel.
---
Wasn’t that I was expecting some grand prize, just slightly disappointed it’s just a mask. Imagination was running wild trying to guess what the reward was, ya know?
---
My ex gf's account got unbanned but mine is still banned. I only used her characters as mules, never duped with them. I'm still crossing my fingers my account will eventually be unbanned.
---
I would have though customizable themes brought from the venxers in whitespring, like in fo3
---
There was a greenhouse in the back, a basement that had a workbench with a body to start the Mistress quest. Outside on the veranda there was an ice machine, on the main level there was a piano and few desks.
---
It’s fine to be disappointed it should least be a whole costume not just a mask
---
I'm 100% sure it hasn't happened to anyone else on this sub either. Mental illness runs rampant here.
---
Agreed. But at least it’s something, right?
---
Eh, extra loading screens and fixed location.
---
Maybe like as some kind of super VIP, pure status thing - or the faction end reward.
---
Nah man, to many issues dude
---
Don’t be rash now.
---
Its just a glitch, hopefully it gets fixed in the next patch.
---
There's a specific gulper on the map, near the factory full of robots (North East of the Mire), that will often drop his loot at his spawn point rather to where you killed it.
---
If you kill this mob, it'll seemingly disappear instantly only to drop his corpse from the sky at his spawn point.
---
It happens to me like 3 times out of 10.
---
We call them Bethesda Features because "It just works!"
---
They should really fix this, I'm not sure how they broke this again but it really bothers me to go all the way from crafting stations to my stash with all the junk that could have been bulked had it not been for accidentally scrapping everything. The only benefit of bulking as of now is that bulking junk and scrapping it counts for the "Gather Building Materials" challenge, apart from that it's almost useless if you are carrying it around
---
Swear to god if its a bunny suit and i miss it becuase i didnt refresh!
---
Yeah lol but it will be so common meh
---
I do this constantly. Lol
---
It's for the gate next to the DO NOT ENTER sign. The last 7 times I went through that gate it was already opened. Where did you get the key? I'm at the gate right now.
---
Huh. Don't remember that at all.  Been a long time since I was down that way, though.
---
&gt; can't
---
Yes they can. They don't, but they could. They've issued patches to address serious bugs in the past. This isn't a serious bug, but they absolutely could do a mid-stream patch for this.
---
Again, I personally am fine with this, I don't care for minmaxing nor hyper-optimization, I would rather the weaponry and armor be consistent and make sense in the context of one another than it have a higher raw DPS.  
---
Side note, most high level creatures have around or over 100 DR/ER, Super Mutants for example (being one of the most common enemies) at level 59+ have 135 DR and 80 ER, A level 45 .50 Cal MG would deal 14.1705 damage per shot, while a level 50 Gatling Plasma, even after splitting the damages would deal about 18.2958 per shot.  
---
Even with rank 3 of Stabilized properly ignoring 45% of target armor, the .50 Cal MG would deal 17.6259 damage per shot, while the Gatling Plasma would deal 22.7572 per shot.
---
Yeah, very weird how they handled the kill challenge for her, wish they would change it but it slipped my mind while making the list haha.
---
For anyone who has the question in the future:
---
My issue was that I was sneaking, the sentinel effect does not work while sneaking, but for some reason does work while jumping.
---
I lost my Vail of Secrets to this bug.... You cant replace those!
---
You actually shot first by taking that spot.  You're not the good guy here brother! You're the antagonist!  When you found out this spot was a vendor spot, you should've moved! You're NOT more important then the server you punk ass bitch!  You sound like a child (which you probably are from reading your posts). Give it up dude, or EVERYONE will come for you! Just find a better spot and quit acting like a kid (which, again, you most likely are like 13). Also, 23 + other people in that server are more important than you!  Quit being selfish!  If you're not careful, people will just troll your game instead of your camp.  Just quit being a bitch dude.  I don't even know this spot, just know you're acting like a grade A punk ass bitch!
---
I climb up in corners and cloak and watch people in whitesprings, rarely people notice me.
---
I’m sure there will be.  What are some of the big ones you see?
---
It's the new end game content /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
Me too! Raider helmet. Up and vanished like a fart in the wind.
---
I thought that was pretty funny.
---
"Robbing" is griefing. Your very statement proves that contesting the workshop wasn't your true intent. It was to take the players stuff and go back to Survival Mode. Easy target. If it was true PvP, your competition would have some clue that he's in for a fight and have a chance to defend himself. Again, doming an unsuspecting Level 22  while he's modding his rifle. It's akin to Jeff Gillooly knee capping Nancy Kerrigan before the real game begins b/c hey, there's a baton and he's got a killer swing. Nancy didn't win but she didn't get to play either. So yeah, let's call this what it really is: exploitation and NOT competition (pvp).
---
Idk a lot of people are claiming they missed an egg
---
They just need to put about 15 cars right in that spot people like so much. Just touch off a car and goodbye turret shit tower. Lol
---
Sorry the wording was all out of wack but basically what I was saying was that yes this post is cool af but only way this would work is if more ppl got involved but how can u do that when u have ppl running around killing or as Bethesda would say murdering ppl? U leave urself at a variable way that anyone could come up and murder u or a creature of some kind kill u so u have to worry about that but also with someone coming up and stealing all Ur stuff. So who would want to put their self in a position like and to have ur stuff takin no one is going want to do that
---
Also, possibly related, i have 2 sets of power armour that i can't for the life of me remember ever acquiring. A t60 with shocks and a basic lv30 t51. The t51 isn't painted so i know it's not one of mine.
---
24*?
---
I’m assuming the fixer has a locked level because there are plans out there for it
---
"I didn't do nothin!"
---
Wow,  Can you mention one time they have?
---
Fortunately I caught on to that immediately. 
---
Been disconnected 3 times so far in about 5  hours of play.. is this common?
---
it all kinda works itself out after awhile. Didn’t work for me and a buddy the first day but next day it was changed
---
I don’t see what the big deal is with being at that spot.
---
I get people are saying it’s a random spawn point for that vendor but like....that’s no reason to send someone back hours of gameplay collecting materials. Specially if you have some builds that take more rare components to make. Would have been easier just messaging the person and being like “hey low level, this is a spawn spot for a rare thing, could you please move?”.
---
Takes like a min, maybe you can educate someone who legitimately doesn’t know and just likes that spot or threw their camp down cuz they were trying to beat a difficult enemy as a low level and needed turrets, and could actually be productive. 
---
I’ve been playing since day 1, didn’t know about that spot. Now I do, and I’ll check it out. But it’s understandable that some people didn’t know (like me and OP), so like don’t be a shit player cuz maybe they just don’t know. 
---
If someone asked me to move my camp for a legitimate reason, I would. If someone destroyed my camp, then was like “asshole you deserve this for camping on a rare spawn”, I’d most likely leave it there like OP. I’m not doing favors for assholes. But I will for people that aren’t total jerks.
---
I feel like 2 months is a ridiculous amount of time because I screwed some dupers out of some nukas
---
If the media even sees this Reddit post Bethesda will be sued within 24-48 hours
---
Yeah an actual trade screen not a "sell for caps" screen would be great.
---
oh then he was done the only thing to do is fight sheep squatch imposter
---
Are you dying, and then the sbq is dead before you hit her again?
---
And YouTube will explode with an overflow of “76 IS PAY TO WIN! BETHESDA BAD!” Videos
---
This Easter crap is so lame. When did fallout become all about these giant masks? Tons of stupid masks available at this point.
---
Microsoft wouldn’t have a problem helping them with it and leaving out Sony lmao
---
Heaps of people are getting stung with this, come on bethesda help stop the stealing scammers
---
Entitlement nothing, it’s just lame boring nonFallout junk.
---
It would be nice.  I'm thinking that they would have to allow for the half-sized security fence to be placed tot he left or right of the stairs because that would be the next request.  But, Yes, I would love to have stairs that hugged the walls giving more floor space.
---
Some other things that are on my wish list:
---
\- Half-stairs, since we have half-walls
---
\- Door variant that opens inward to the left when facing outward.  They all open to the right.
---
\- Half-sized and Quarter-sized floors for the laminated flooring, instead of just the shack wood or metal grille.
---
\- Welcome mats for your camp so that you can set a spawn point when you fast travel, like at Workshops.
---
\- Garage doors with surrounds that match the other building themes.  Brick, Barn, etc.
---
Good luck putting them on, mods are still broken, yo.
---
No, the game has been remarkably stable (compared to launch) for quite some time.  There have definitely been some issues since the last patch as I had more disconnects last night (5) than I’d had the last 2 months.
---
Ya it had been awhile since I had been down that way, my son and wife who both play commented on the house not being there.
---
Yea, no, yea, no...yea.
---
Yes, I have the same problem with applying mods to my T-60 Power Armour.  It's definitely a bug that needs squashing.
---
That’s what I’m aiming for. Get them while there broken in which they should be cheaper and then wait.... also I’ve been equipping mods normally.
---
Same! I'm level 36 and trying to kill it for Rose's quest. Not happening. I'd love some advice.
---
If they don't fight back, you will get wanted if you manage to kill them. Also if they don't fight back, you do very little damage until they fight back. They drop only their junk in their inventory on death.
---
My friends want to join to get back at a friend
---
Ah sweet then :)
---
NO UGH FUCK THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! BETHESDA IS LITERALLY RAPING ME RIGHT NOW HOW CAN YOU JUST STAND BY AND LET THEM RAPE ME LIKE THIS YOU RAPIST PIECE OF SHIT UUUURRRGGGGHHHHHHH IM PULLING MY EYELASHES OUT RIGHT NOW ARE YOU HAPPY
---
Oh well..thats dumb..then he did finish it..feel dumb now 😂 he has the Bas Baa Black Sheep and its greyed out. Thanks so much for your help lol even though he got it done anyways 🤔 that is a terrible way for it to end though.
---
Even on survival.?
---
To start just stick to adventure mode, gather resources and do the main quest for levels and loot. When you get the right perk cards and a build you like go to survival and have fun hunting and being hunted.
---
I doubt it. And honestly, as a ps4 user I don’t want to play with pc or Xbox people anyway.
---
Well we feel dumb now 😂 he did complete it. Thank you for your help! Wish it hand "ended" better than that. It was just so abrupt and he thought he had untracked it. Guess not
---
Characters are interchangeable between adventure and survival?
---
50% of the community doesn't wear summer shorts.....
---
FYI...   There is currently a bug preventing PA mods.  I'm not sure if Emergency Protocols is affected or not but a lot of mods are so you may have to wait for the next bug fix.
---
5? That's rookie numbers
---
No survival is free game
---
Sort by weight
---
I’m pretty sure the quest is glitchy. Also, Even if you complete it, it will pop up again
---
Figured that after seeing it in the datamined images
---
Works fine on xbox for me
---
Damn, that might be the best one handed melee weapon possible... Does anyone know if other one hand weapons do as much base damage as the ski sword?
---
Submit this through a support ticket labeled as a suggestion.
---
Lead is lighter as bullets....   (grin)
---
You also lose some aid items when you die in survival.
---
Honestly since that’s not how it is why would you attempt an item trade? Like damn bro
---
Cooking Oil
---
Tin Cans
---
Just stop feeding them after midnight and stop getting them wet, these are very simple instructions
---
Do I need to be online to play This game or no ?
---
Here is mine.  
---
**Mire witch**  
---
info: find a corpse in full marine armor with a fasnacht witch mask on. On them is a pumpkin house holotype, 2-6 pumpkin grenades. a plan for brew bombs, and a note.  
---
NOTe:  
---
Been a few weeks sense the scorched over ran the mire, most the freestates are dead. And the rest of us our on our last legs. I managed to upload the plans for the pumpkin grenades into jack, but I still need to load in the brew grenades. Once this is done someone else might be able to take up the mantle of the mire witch. But I don't think I can make it there, my skin is already turning red. If you are reading this you got it off my body. Take the plans. Become the mire witch.  
---
Brew bombs  
---
requires: radioactive pumpkin seeds, 2 wines, 2 med-x, 2 steel. makes one brew bomb.  
---
damage: 1  
---
effect: creates a cloud that lasts for 15 seconds increasing the damage targets in teh cloud take by 2x and doubling chem effects. (buffs and debuffs everything in the cloud.)
---
I don’t believe so but it still looks spunky
---
He means that we can no longer apply mods to things.
---
The 3rd egg literally never showed up in my atomic shop, so i missed that one. Thanks Bethesda!
---
PS4. Can't attach mods and have the blank weapons list after workshop repair.
---
What do you mean by spunky?
---
Im in the same boat, made a ticket on 2/19/2019 and I am still waiting on an agent. They don't care that players who paid full money for their game can't play it. They know that no one will believe us because the community will just tear us down and silence us. It is truly sad. I just want to play again. Bring the down votes if you want, but I didn't break the rules, cheat, or hack. I was a casual player who got wrongfully hit with the suspension hammer.
---
Probably be jackasses leading mobs over to attack the camp for them. Bases should be indestructible. Except for doors. Doors would be ok to break if you were chasing players with bounties and they try hiding.
---
Caps are real easy to come by, especially with the vendors all sharing one pool.  Go around top of the world or harpers ferry, pick up every weapon the enemies drop, sell to the vendor who's not far away if you're overencumbered.  Build a couple water purifiers in your CAMP and sell purified water, cook and sell all the meat you come by, sell any chems you don't use; vendor trash isn't hard to come by.
---
You aren’t going to be able to decorate your camp beyond some shelf to display nuka cola, bobble heads or teady bears. Don’t get your hopes up.
---
This happened to me with a 3 Star legendary and I was so upset. For a low level, that can be frustrating.
---
Okay, maybe I’ll live in that clown outfit lol. I just need the key card
---
All the time!
---
There are two raider power armor spawns I know of for sure. one near top of the world and one outside Blackwater mine.
---
Why not?
---
Yes. Which means if you accidentally log into a survival world you might lose a lot of stuff.
---
You mustache most of your aid before delving into survival.
---
Lets not forget the whole lead from pencils thing.
---
Is there anything special about radstorms? Enemies with better loot?
---
I was in one a couple days ago at Top of the World but didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.
---
Will miss ya, byeeee!
---
The hell are you playing you have shit luck lmao
---
This happens to me a lot in the mire. It’s really frustrating.
---
Bethesda said items from Stash box...so where are you getting your sources from?
---
All you’d have to do is put a time limit/hard cap/exponential claim cost - there are tons and tons and tons of easy ways to rework it so someone can’t claim all of them...
---
Did they kill you?
---
Sneak shot black powder gun. Go through the dungeon in power armor. Exit the power armor right before the boss.
---
Mods have been bugged since last patch
---
mods are broke atm
---
Haven't died at all - nope. I just can't seem to attack people, only that Wanted guy.
---
I can't really blame you there. While I find some enjoyment from the game time to time, it does its best to really test my patience. I am a Fallout fanboy but that can only take me so far. For now I'm just gonna wait until the Summer Update and see how it stacks up around that time. If nothing grips me by then....well there is at least one more big update in Fall.
---
I’m on a melee build, but I’ll try that
---
They want you to interact and make it happen.   
---
Not gonna happen lol
---
Honestly though, who are you to say bethesda didnt mess this up? I love bethesda and their games, but honestly this who game has been one big shit-show. It has been one thing after another, but no, its automatically the players fault. Even though Bethesda even said it was temporary, it has been two solid months with not a single update. Not one.
---
some glowing mobs from where you are at max. And rad damage
---
There are tons of simple ways to stop that - time limits/cooldowns, hard caps, exponential cap claim cost increase, escalating to untenable defense missions, increased defense mission frequency per claim until you can’t keep up, allow people to claim any if a player exceeds a certain number of claims, tons...
---
Yo which plans were ya looking for? What have ya got to trade?
---
I've got [this one](https://imgur.com/ikZfHMT) as a backup in case I manage to break my hammer, and I love it.
---
I’m anticipating what this shaky team can produce. Imagine a shelf specifically ment for all the bears. You assign them to the shelf from your stash (like alcohol in the fermenter). 
---
As much as I’d like to imagine placing anything anywhere, it’s not going to happen. It’s going to be like bobble head stands.
---
Are you sure your in survival lol? I can try for myself but it sounds like adventure
---
If you have pacifist on, that overrides the survival mechanic. A player only appears red by default if they're wanted or have a weapon drawn. You can still attack a yellow-healthed player. The leaderboards take into account your player kills, and those with the most appear on the board. Also, if you're at an event, it is a designated safe zone until it ends.
---
did they have power armor on. Were they standing still/sprinting only, did they only have 20% of their health at any given time.
---
If they didn't have power armor then they possibly had a suit of "I am invincible" armor on.
---
If you stack the assassin's legendary effect with the damage reduction when printing/standing still to completely negate all incoming damage.
---
People use this in combination with bloodied weapons you go around one shotting people while being almost completely immune to attack. The only weapons that can threaten them are the radium rifle and gamma gun, but they only work when you catch them off guard. Otherwise you can't do anything.
---
I'm on Xbox, not this second, but I'm happy to help!
---
Like... good... idk...
---
Sorry i forgot to put console, im from ps4 :/
---
Actually, its the whole purpose of the vault. Rebuild a society
---
Pacifist functions in Survival? 
---
Yeah I attacked a yellow health player and it didn't change them to red or anything. They just waved at me. Level 20. So definitely not in Unyielding Sentinel or anything.
---
Yeah I attacked a yellow health player and it didn't change them to red or anything. They just waved at me. Level 20. So definitely not in Assassin's Sentinel or anything.
---
Did you name the pipegun? Just curious because I was gonna start naming a bunch of stuff
---
Aw, it's np, hope it works out for u :)
---
It should just be PvE and PvP servers like every other game - BGS tried to fix what want broken by creating a “best of both” that juat ended up a janky mess by trimming not to segment the player base. They’re already undoing it, might as well just go all the way and do what is proven to work.
---
I’ve been PvP’ing since most of the people in this game were babies, if that (UO, vanilla WoW, etc...) but PvP in this game is really, really bad because it’s so unbalanced. It’s all who can on shot who first.
---
Im on xbox.
---
gt: inbredpoet
---
I can mod it, psn epicduck00
---
Well shit, good job!
---
Omg a box with a flashing cursor that you can just input a number into???
---
Pretty easy to do for PC ,tougher for console I guess but still probably doable with some type of scrolling number do-hickey.
---
Putting something together so it works on 3 platforms? Now that’s the tough part and would take some skill and creativity.
---
I haven’t seen too much skill or creativity from this studio,so my guess is,something like this will never happen.No matter how simple of change it may seem.
---
Sorry u dont have too much karma, looking for somebody with high karma, nothing against u but people scammed me in the past :/
---
So you have low hopes for the team is what you are saying. You are also looking towards the negative side of things that insinuates that the game will have an underwhelming outlook.
---
I mostly look towards the positive and post ideas in here. That's why we say things and Bethesda gets to read our input on the game. If this gets enough upvotes and if lucky enough a badge (seldom rarely happens) then it gets noticed by the community.
---
What was the third legendary?
---
+1 luck
---
They could expand the map, but it might be easier to just have a separate map with entrances at various locations, perhaps train stations (i.e. you buy a ticket from the vendor, get in a portal tube, and place the ticket in a slot).  I like the concept of having to travel there vs Fast Travel because having people build C.A.M.P.S in the game area adds to the game.  And when you enter the community map, it should feel like you are actually traveling someplace new, maybe to an island.
---
My thought is that you could have two CAMPS, one in the community area and one in the game.  Each would have it's own budget, kind-of like Workshops vs CAMPs.
---
Thats fine but why do you need someone to mod a pipe gun? They're the easiest guns to get mods for. Is it legendary?
---
i mean.. with that logic, shooting melee enemies before they can reach you is similarly.. easy.
---
Ohh, good one. Ye, def do the vanguard stuff
---
I wanna make a rhyme with that glorious phrase.
---
First I'm hearing about this bug. Never encountered anything like that in the game. You got video of your stuff disappearing? That would help your case immensely.
---
Cause i dont have any mod for it lol haha and yes, tse
---
I'm convinced that rifle weight is approximately double the real life equivalent.  Unless it's made of solid gold, a Winchester 98 is never going to weigh 17lb.
---
A fire axe weighs like 3lb without perks and is a very strong melee two hander.  I don't play bloodied builds, and 362 damage on this [middle of the road fire axe](https://imgur.com/ikZfHMT) isn't too shabby while sitting at high health.
---
Bruh 😂
---
U wont believe me how people steal garbage lol haha its ridiculous but it happens 😂
---
Well technically the repair kits thoug they did it not in the way we wanted. But people were asking for something like that.  Also people have been wanting a fridge so they are adding that. More storage, player vending, slap damage gone if you are in passive, camp damage going to go away, being able to change servers if your camp is taken, these are all things people asked for that bethesda listened to.
---
I was lucky enough to get a vampire’s cultist dagger that I keep on me at all times. It weighs 1 and has fast attack speed making you basically invincible with the health regen ability
---
Why would having a camp near a rare vendor spawn point cause problems?  Does the vendor get trapped?
---
Are we talking about Graham or the Eyebot Vendor?
---
I like where you’re going with this.  We could even have different options since there are different terrain types so you could have one on the outside of the map but cranberry bog-like or underground etc.
---
The last time they triggered for me was before I hit 100. I’m 130 now and play a little bit almost daily and they never trigger for me 😭
---
Levels after 55 "don't matter", you can get as powerful as physically possible by that point. There is no better gear, stats, or perks. 
---
I don't have combat perks, and ran it with the level 30 quest reward rifle you get from Sheep quests. 
---
What is 2 level 50 players supposed to even mean. The SBQ is rated 8 level 50 players, so this dungeon should be 1/4 of a queen fight by their metrics. DID IT FEEL THAT HARD TO YOU. The imposter bot felt tough, like 3.5 level 50s could do it fairly easily IMO, and to do it solo would take strong optimization and preparation. This dungeon I would rate at one level 40 player.
---
Confused ^^^^
---
Note that I said "dumbasses like me". To be honest, i knew something was up, but that TSE was too shiny and it blinded me
---
I've thought about maybe a cellar door we can place in our camp that leads to a personal area we can access, and invite people to.
---
But I'd love to see instanced player housing similar to GTA Online, as that would be a really interesting thing to see for me personally.  Like imagining a broker you interact with, and there are various places around the world, random houses that you can purchase the deeds for, from the Forest, all the way to one of the high-rises in Watoga.  Buy one with lots of caps, or maybe a bunch of pre-war money, and then you get this personal space not unlike the player housing in Fallout 3, and Fallout 4, and you get to decorate the area yourself, maybe even purchase secondary design options that change up the floors, and walls, think like the themes in Fallout 3.
---
You're either projecting, trolling, or both; I'm not sure which is sadder.
---
Leaving  or not taking part is an option in anything in life, but just because you leave, does not change the fact that if you come back, you will still be required to log in each day to earn the final reward
---
You may have the option to not take part, but if you want that final reward you are, BY DEFINITION, FORCED,  to log in every day.
---
Really? I avoid the power plant events like the plague. I’ve only ever been able to complete one without getting a server disconnect. I’m on a XB1X though, so maybe the other two platforms don’t have this problem.
---
I wouldn't be shocked if the challenge was broken.  My friend and I were hunting deathclaws for a pet to send back to her camp at least a month ago and found a legendary glowing lvl 91.  I got the last hit on it and wound up getting the credit for the "kill a legendary deathclaw" challenge while she didn't.  I've participated in probably close to 100 SBQ at this point and still haven't landed the kill shot to get credit for the challenge.  My rifle is strong enough that I can actually see her health slowly deplete with that white phantom damage bar.  I'd just assumed that another strong player always got the last hit, but it may simply be broken.
---
I don't know, ask Bethesda? 
---
And various rare things happen at that spot.
---
OP, Ignore this clown "dragonbaby". Long as you're on adventure mode you're safe, in survival you'll be subjected to this idiot spawn camping. 
---
To be extra cautious, once you're over level 5 make sure pacifist is on. This will prevent you from initiating or agreeing to pvp if you don't want to. 
---
Also if you claim a workshop you can be forced into pvp. 
---
Currently people like this can grief you by destroying your camp but they're going to remove that in May.
---
I have a legendary fire axe. Its exterminator’s so I’m waiting for the legendary vendor.

I think I have all the mods.  Join me. utchia23

No Fire Breather should be without one.

As the record has been, items available via the Atomic Shop are only available in the Atomic Shop. That being said, if the only item you're dying to have is the Road Tripper Outfit, you should just buy that for the 400 atoms.
---
World of Warcraft tried this with Garrisons, it lasted one expansion before going to a shared area. Most players complained, as it is very isolating for a multi-player game.
---
The best time for the Garrison was when the game bugged out and the instancing broke. With everyone at the one Garrison, party time occurred with so many people appearing ;)
---
I mean I think I can mod it for you if you’d like
---
Casuals.....
---
\^This.
---
ok that makes sence from the reports i've heard it happens sometime around lvl 100 maybe even exactly at 100
---
God Howard has spoken!
---
That does sound like a simple, obvious solution that no one thought of probably. Wish I could see their code base....though it might make me cry.
---
lol 1488
---
The sprite cranberry is with us all in spirit
---
Sure it does. My medical malpractice is gold. So is my Somerset special. It doesn't work on the Voice of Set, but any other .44 (not Western Revolvers or Single Action Revolvers) should work.
---
You are the type of casual playee that made me stop playing...its my place , why is he stealing my kills with a op weapon and wont wait til i shoot em with my 21 dmg pipe gun
---
Not playing with the same people could cause issues alone if you could combine bases, also if people already had a case at any of the 2-4 combined locations. It would be nearly impossible
---
A random human that kills you instantly with an explosive shotgun from any range, doesn't move and can't be killed unless staggered. When you die your loot instantly disappears and the human transfers to a different world.
---
Only on energy weapons in general

They should add the classic 10mm from fo4 creation club, either as a skin for the 10mm, or as a new gun with different stats (like the fo4 version was).
---
But that wouldn't be true some items that you can buy can be found in game
---
It happens all the time in the Burrows.  the enemies turn to meat piles almost instantly.
---
I killed a three star gutsy during AWOL today and it straight up vanished as soon as I got close.  I killed it on the spot where it was laying in a heap, so the scrap pile should have been right there.  It didn't explode and go flying.
---
I've had other scorchbeasts, ghouls and super mutant corpses just vanish ever since the last update.  At least a dozen or so, and almost always legendary enemies aside from the scorchbeasts.  It stings a little.
---
Such as?
---
Looks fantastic!  Will join you for a drink sometime.
---
"stop talking crazy! hahaha"

If it's ps4 I'll give you 25k

This post needs to rise to the top.

A single 1 block fence that snaps like the 2 block defensive fence would be nice too.

The current single block one is terrible.
---
Is it the tall windows? If so, theyve been broken for quite some time.
---
Hallowed are the Mothmen.
---
Would love this. Fallout has always had a knack for the topic of human condition. It's the choices you have to interact with people and the relations you build with them-- good, bad and somewhere in between in the post-apocalypse that pulls me in.
---
But without human npcs the story is just lost on me.
---
I'm pretty sure only the BOS level combat armor is higher. Polymer CA is lower than Buttressed Marine
---
Platform?
---
It’s really not even a good or nice spot for a camp, there’s water but no resources. I’m not a fan of pvp in this game, but if you don’t want people to be mad at you for building your camp there “because Bethesda allows you too”, you can’t be mad at people who attack you.... because Bethesda allows them to.
---
Xb1 sorry
---
Greaser jacket and jeans
---
steve?
---
It happens more often than you think, and especially now when the legendaries blow up. You have to look around and try to find where their corpse went, most I kill it seems they vaporize because I can never find them to loot....
---
+karma
---
Yea 24 players.
---
Yep. I guess it doesn't really matter since I have a big hole in the ceiling but it's been bothering me. Still, I hope they fix it eventually. 
---
Thanks!
---
Appalachia isn't a shitty place, and while I admit I have griefed others alot of people are nice and just want to help. I myself tend to get called upon to assist people, or y'know I see a level 9 and his level 14 friend being picked on by a level 40 to 60. Unfortunately greifers are pretty common 
---
(I know a few I want to call out because they were fucking with this guy I had talked to about trading but the deal fell through and point is he asked me to defend him so I did, they destroyed his camp over and over. They were smart and gave all their caps to one of their friends. So he got nothing but lost all his resources, I got nothing and used the last of my PvP ammo types, and they walked out feeling good about themselves. It was fucked to say the least.) 
---
But most people are chill and will leave you alone or will help you. That's the Appalachia I always remember. Also the survival mode removed alot of the greifers from adventure mode. So it got better.
---
Yeah, I just helped a level 17 player last night after the Uranium Fever quest. I asked if was her first character and when she said yes, I asked what she needed. I made her pieces for her power armor, gave her caps and a few weapons. Really made me smile to help someone out in game.
---
Which PA leg did you lose?  Was it modded?
---
I have no access to a computer three days a week so I missed the first three because of when they became available without warning on GMT. Wish there had been another option but it’s not like they won’t be available again next year, same with Fasnacht plans that I couldn’t get.
---
Oooh. Those mods. My bad.
---
Ok, but the game is still broken.  Every  update they add more bugs. They released a broken game, continues to be broken.  Oh and its my fault for expecting better.
---
The "non legendaries" are actually legendary. If an enemy is both legendary and diseased, it'll just show "Diseased Charred Feral Ghoul" or something like that, the "Diseased" modifier overwrites the display of "Legendary."
---
As for the multiple legendary items, yeah I've noticed it a couple times. Once it was four for me. I was running with another person and we each got four drops from one enemy. It was a 3* too. All the drops sucked of course, but hey.
---
I've heard that there was a theory that if you die to an enemy and come back to it, they'll have another item. We didn't die to it, but I guess it's possible someone died thrice and gave up, and it made it spawn another one? Who knows... but it was a nice surprise.
---
I just don’t use class freak.
---
Then you’re only dedicating 2 points. 
---
The downsides to most of them aren’t so bad.
---
Currently I’m running healing factor, marsupial, speed demon, and adrenal reaction.
---
The worst downside is probably speed demon.
---
So when are you gonna fix it ?
---
Hell yeah, I’m with you, people can get their stupid coat from a different server
---
This is incorrect. There is no association with the legendary vendor at all. The legendary power armor effects have been in the files long before the legendary vendor was ever thought of.
---
If I ever see your camp there I’m hitting it with my fat man and every nuke I have available lol fuck your camp. Move it along bud
---
I find it odd that some people are losing several items and others aren't affected at all. There has to be something more specific to it
---
What platform?
---
This would be amazing also slightly terrifying
---
If that's the case you would expect the marine to beat the BOS considering it's still combat armor unless the BOS improved the combat armor when they found it, or combat armor was just more common then marine armor but the BOS give" off the we have best gear vibe" and don't use marine armor for some reason.
---
Praise him, brother, and be saved from the great floods to come!
---
Yeah, I just found out the same. It doesn’t go to anything special. You can find the key in the makeshift throne room.
---
i imagined it would have been as simple as setting a flag auto-scrap on/off...
---
What frustrates me most though that it never got mentioned in the change log. Same as the Watoga bots and, and, and... no  reason given.
---
That makes it either look like accidental or condescending - not sure which one it is
---
Yeah, I’ve got 3 sets of L15 on PC
---
Amen brother, Amen.
---
Damn straight, the more reason why we need it. Plus, what am I supposed to do with the items? give them to vendors?  put in my already full stash? just drop it? put it on a mule account? it would be nice, but for people who don't have a trusted middle man to transfer items it becomes a problem. I understand that I should've been smarter, but I decided to take a risk and it backfired.
---
Their turrets can hurt you, they are aggroed to you.  Thankfully they do shit damage.  Pacifism does NOT affect NPC's in any way, and turrets are NPC's.  Pacifism only prevents you from damaging and aggroing players.  
---
Ricochet lets NPC's that otherwise won't flag on you and grant XP to do so through the ricochet proc.  You are NOT immune to damage from these NPC's, even base turrets, because of this.
---
If youre looking for a quick fix, i think the wider windows are fully functional and dont allow for clipping.
---
The bleed/poison/fire effects in this game are static, and rather low, values. They’re mostly for flavor, as they typically do 2-5 damage a second for 3ish seconds. When you’re doing 100+ a hit, a 15 damage DoT is meaningless
---
If you are running burrows for loot, you're probably not really worth discussing this game with - that's how wrong you are.  There's nothing to say or argue about, the zone is pointless and there is absolutely no reason to enter it, ever, unless you feel like completing the worthless waste of time quests for the equally worthless, unusable rewards.
---
Isn’t...isn’t that the point of chameleon?
---
What camp plans do you have and are you on xbox?
---
Now you are just moving goal posts. All I pointed out was that how you chose to reach out to bethesda was likely to get you ignored and pointed out that they do listen to what people ask. That doesn’t mean they do everything. And the game is fun and honestly does work better than when it came out.
---
I love these posts where OP is making up some bugs and people blindingly upvote.
---
Right? I get a dozen or more legendary drops (most shit, but that's everywhere) for one ten minute clear of whitesprings and its side buildings.  Why the fuck would I waste my time in the Burrows, off in the middle/right of the map where nothing else useful is?
---
Less mobs.  Slower respawns.  Harder (nearly impossible) to tag things thanks to tight corridors and players blocking projectiles.
---
There is literally no reason to enter that zone.  Go see for yourself if you think this isn't true.
---
If this is what comes to fruition on may 7, then i'm happy with the effects. 100 pounds will be pretty good , maybe i'll finally be able to walk around without power armor. I would prefer a 200 pounds, but that would be asking abit much.
---
Less mobs. Slower respawns. Harder (nearly impossible) to tag things thanks to tight corridors and players blocking projectiles.  Don't bother with that place.
---
That’s what I assumed was the case, in Warframe the bleed effects will take down an enemy even if the initial dmg doesn’t, I’m a little disappointed but I’ll get over it. thanks dude
---
They don't disappear, they go to the down under.
---
I think that I just saw one in the Atom store, or something similar.
---
&gt; Embrace the enviroment learn how it works
---
Yea, thing is, you can't really watch for what barely exists. There's no prediction, and there's no timer. Some people have played this game for 200+ hours and literally have never seen one. Everyone experiences rain, fog, and nuke zones, but rad storms are something that plenty of people simply aren't aware of, as they're so damn rare. You could be in the same world for hours and never see one. So a daily challenge like this goes well beyond a simple challenge. It's only appropriate as a weekly challenge, and even then your chances of completing it are very low. 
---
You can go out and find a specific enemy, specific items, specific weapons, armor, junk, etc. You can't hunt down a rad storm. It would be the equivalent of staring at a wall for 8 hours straight, and you'll get nothing for it too.
---
I spent hours server hopping to get an X-01 calibrated leg mod. This week the leg I modded just vanished from my inventory. Disappearing items are 100% a thing.
---
My friend lost a T-60 arm during a Queen fight. No idea how he managed to do it, but he accidentally dropped it.
---
I picked it up not knowing it was his, and luckily he mentioned it so I gave it back to him.
---
I'm not sure how it stacks, but either way it doesn't just add up like that.  Say there is 100 armor.  Take 50% off for the weapon, then 75% of what's left for the perk, ends up at 12.5% armor that is not affected.  It would be the same if the perk is activated first, then the weapon.  
---
Some armor percentage effects stack the way you are thinking, fall damage for sure and I think the sentinel pieces can add up to 75.
---
As asked, which ones are you looking for? I have a few that I'd be willing to let go of for some caps.
---
Hi FO76newb,
---
Like you, I've thankfully had, ( I play 'Adventure' mode ), many similar experiences from helpful high-level players who give newbs a "Leg-Up" near the beginning of play...  or an "Arm-aments-Up" 🛡️+🔫,😉.  My advice :
---
➫  **Be polite** ... Please keep listening for quiet-goofy-sound-fx + keep glancing now-&amp;-then because your surprise benefactor might be doing, in case the person is not verbally getting your attention, ( or there's a momentary issue with hearing the player ), and she-or-he-or-'other-person' might be doing actions / emoji-player-anims to get your attention, or drops a loot lunch bag for you, etc.
---
This - from my experience ;  You may be surprised how many loot containers such a player may decide to provide to you.
---
•  You'll understandably figure that the player mentioned providing certain things.
---
•  Then, provided you with them in couple drops of loot.
---
•  You expressed happiness &amp; gratitude
---
•  You figure, "well, that terrific High Powered Easter bunny is gonna be hopping off to where-ever now".
---
•  A few times at the start, I looked like I ignored the player at while they are still trying to get my attention, like to provide me with some particular forgotten related items, or what-not.  And there I am at a food-prep station, for e.g. , due to my surviving by the skin of my teeth too often.  There's me choppin' or stirrin' away, barely paying attention to the goofy-sound-fx I hear behind me.  Oh boy, sorry 😅.
---
➫  Oh, and do consider this :  After you've received a nice complement of higher-end armaments + ammo + energy cores, or what-not, offer this person that made your start of  *FALL​*☢️﻿*UT 76* a "Beauty play, Eh?" ( search : Beauty Eh? .  I am Canadian &gt;!Derived from indigenous Nation of the Saint Lawrence Iroquoian word meaning "settlement"!&lt; from the Mid-Northern part of Ontario..&gt;!The Province name has it's derivation connected to the "Great Lake" of the same name.  It's derived from either the indigenous word "Ontari io" meaning "Great Lake" ( my sense is﹘akin to "vast &amp; wonderful" ) of the "Wyandot people" aka "Wendat", aka "Huron Nation" (most recognized), or possibly it's derivation is adapted from the word "skanadario" meaning "Beautiful Lake" used within the indigenous Northern Iroquoian language. !&lt; ) , a super-primo item ( that you won't be able to use till dozens of levels later ) .  *IF, that is,* you were gifted one by someone else ( or however ) .

I enjoy how after a long session of plundering and killing and looting, my friends and I can veg out on the couches in our CAMP and just chat. It’s nice having a spot in game where you can just relax but still get to hang out with folk.
---
You did the right thing!  I got no respect for these cheap clowns.

I would be happy to purchase plans on PC. Is there a plan for the Pole Hook? Feels like some plans are missing from the game?

*Enclave*

Last time I saw you guys, was in a Fireball.....

---
It's slightly different. The Atomic Shop variant is clean, the jeans are different, and the shoes more clearly resemble Converse.
---
I think the mistake was calling it a dungeon and hyping it up as some big challenge. 
---
If they had just called it an interesting new area to explore, or better yet said nothing and just inserted random clues about how to find it, everyone’s perception would be much different.
---
No mutations here. 🙂 Just not too interested in them even although I have plans for the adrenal one. I'll make it to sell but that's it.
---
Yeah it was - different server fixed it though!

Different server fixed it LOL

After seeing your post I played around with a shelf. Really it’s the metal with 3 shelves. I was able to put an most appliances. My personal favorite was the bathtub and toilet..

Mele is also affected

---
Hunting rifles are shit. Lower dmg and slower than a lever
---
Not 100% sure if it's set to it, but every one I've seen dropped was level 30

Are you on PS4? I could tag along and help kill it.
---
Incoming necro...it’s amazing.
---
If you try to rng your own piece you still might not ever get one. If you farm caps for 3 weeks you'll have about 25k. You might try trading it for another legendary of equal rarity that you actually want
---
I actually managed to find a BOS torso plan earlier while server hopping. Now I just need the arms and legs 😅
---
Lame that it takes so long to fix such major features that they broke.   Did they know and let them through anyway or just completely obvious?
---
Go to Charleston, my mate found several bits at level 15 there, try the penetenary with the super mutant's also
---
lol same thing, except it was a guy and his gf. she just watched. when I blasted him in the face and picked up his crazy amount of bulk loot I hear him whine "aww babe, you didn't get my bag, it had all my bulk!?" just before I leave the server
---
Honestly feels like the worst oversight that there hasn't been one from the beginning (especially since pistols have one).
---
Or neither. Just sick of all the "hur dur, giant conspiracy about atom shop" stuff. I know I worded it harsh but I'm not going to delete my comment.
---
Killing a few  Yaoi Guais gave me better loot than the Scorchbeast Queen did..........
---
That's how the wounding effect worked in FO4.  Super OP.  You could farm a Wounding Double Barrel at level 7 or 8 and kill almost anything in the game.  
---
Even though the bleeding/poison effects aren't super great, they're still better than nothing on the machete.  I have a lvl 40 Ghoul Slayers w/+40 pwr attk dmg, +1 STR and the sac blade.  I got it when I was around lvl 40, and it did pretty much the same damage as a tricked out Assaulton blade, officer sword, etc.  I got a bad ass ski sword around lvl 45 and never used the machete again, even vs. ghouls.   I wish we could use the mod on combat/bowie knives.
---
It helps for the first player to open and close trade twice, then accepted by the second player. I maybe after you load into a map from the menu is when this happens, things are still loading in the background.
---
I think it's neat, I don't really care if it moves. It'd be nice if it did tho.
---
That's not the base damage, tons of things affect it including the players health for that one.
---
And those affixes are garbage except the 40% swing speed.  +1 strength is not a relevant stat (no +1 is).  Armor piercing, and power attack damage with attack speed would be two better ones.  A few others as well.
---
I have played this game longer than you, and will be playing it long after you have forgotten it ever existed.
---
Definitely not. Just aesthetic.
---
I would like to know how to build the damn things. I got them all from the shop, but they don't appear to be in my build menu at all?
---
The plan allows you to make it at level 50
---
Those mods are super rare, I doubt they'll go down.
---
Maybe someone figured out that Challenges should be.... and stay with me here because this is going to be a stretch... challenging.
---
No one has complained about the Burrows as a location, just how easy/fast the quest is.
---
I managed to get an instigating and +1 Strength fire axe. It is my lovely little baby for when I need to thwack somebody. I rarely bring it out (My character has a strength of 3, after all!) but sometimes you gotta break out the power armor and wade in to a bunch of ghouls, you know?
---
...this is not a good weapon.  +1 to any stat is a completely wasted affix.  40% swing speed is great, but it's better on 2h weapons (naturally slower ones) as they have higher dps in general.
---
That's not the base damage, tons of things affect it including the players health for that one. [Wiki shows the base stats and how mods affect it.](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Ski_sword)
---
What would make it better? Armor piercing, and power attack damage combined the attack speed would be two better ones.  A handful of other ones as well.
---
This'd be great for a nerd rage build, something nobody runs because it's totally unnecessary and most 2h weapons kill 95% of the game's enemies in one hit with a good melee build.
---
Yeah, I'm missing either 2 or 3 faschnacht plans.    
---
I'm hoping that player vending will let me fill in the missing ones!
---
I honestly don't mind the GT callout (maybe could have left the numbers off?) I'm trading on these subs so it's everywhere at this point. While I don't actively hide it, gender neutral pronouns would have been preferred, because I'd expect more "omg, a girl!" follows than "omg help me" follows.  But he exposed that one. Lol
---
Most people add me because they think my GT is funny (I mean, I guess it is/was, but it's not *that* funny - until you add a female behind it and it's funny again? Seriously, my name isn't hidden on live, you should be able to figure out that I'm a female and at least partially where the GT comes from)

I do try to keep goodie bag type items for when I'm in the middle of something, or don't have much time to give to anyone I come across. (Stims, armor, hunting rifle, ammo, and water, usually. I also craft for level 5 armor because they're already 2 when they leave the vault, they'll be 5 in no time - then a crappy level 1 rifle and a modded level 5 (same reason) 
---
I used to drop plans, but now I have this impossible goal of collecting every plan in game. Like, literally every single one. So I tend to hold on to those extras for trades. 
---
**
---
Hey if you still have plans for UGL plans and willing to sell on xbox i would be down to even pay 5k caps
---
Mods?
---
It's not that they "don't do" hotfixes, they only do them when they're "oh shit" level absolutely necessary.  The one and only hotfix we've ever seen was when they accidentally overwrote a chunk of the live build with old code and undid a whole bunch of bug and exploit fixes.
---
Hotfixing a game isn't cheap or fast.  Submitting a patch to Microsoft/Sony comes with a heafty fee totaling around $40k as of reports from a few years ago, and the process can take up to a week if not longer.  If they'd put in for a hotfix for this problem then at best we'd probably have non-camera challenges by the day before they added the camera.
---
Cool, throw it on the bottom of the list of shit that doesn't matter and won't ever get fixed.
---
Marine's got amazing protection for the weight. If you're a stealth type, it's amazing.  
---
I'm still using light combat armor at level 119 because it's all Legendary, and I simply can't find any legendary heavy combat stuff.
---
I generally think everybody that plays wants this game to succeed, and doesn't want to push anyone away from it.
---
That's the penalty for being able to 1-shot 90% of the enemies in the game from 20 times the distance everything else can.
---
Do you have any fucking clue how fixing the dailies would actually go down?  Hotfixing isn't cheap or fast, the last time a dev came forward about patch certification fees a few years back a single patch going through Microsoft and Sony before being released would cost upwards of $40k.  And even after you pay that fee the certification process can take up to a week if not longer depending on their workload.
---
I've seen people say it turns flora into their nuked versions.
---
I'm only level 19, but I found a Fat Man pretty recently if that's any good for a trade. I'm looking for either the Fasnacht party streamers or the hanging snowflakes.
---
Floor decor then down to where the deathclaw statues are and they are all in the varients
---
The only option i get is x pacify and y pacify i never get the tame optionmostly i just get the x pacify but sometimes both i am guessing those are tamabls but its broken
---
You might have armor or a perk that decrease the weigh of them
---
How many caps would a party streamer plan worth for you? Or for the plan of the hanging snowflakes?
---
It's a camera artifact. Just checked myself. They are all the same size.
---
Stop carrying around your bulked scrap?  I know it's not a solution, but it is common sense.  There's only like two or three types of scrap that actually lose weight when you bulk them, everything else only shows up as losing weight at the bench because you're losing plastic.  The one and only time you should ever have bulked scrap in your inventory is when you're on your way to immediately sell it at a vendor.
---
It's Traveling Pharmacy
---
Well, we ARE here in a thread started by someone saying we should have unlimited scrapped junk.   If you can't write code that tracks a dozen or so numbers per player without causing huge lag, then wtf are you doing trying to produce a AAA quality title?
---
I'm pretty sure the ski sword with the metal shards mod is the best 1h melee for pure damage. So, if you can, hold off until level 45 before doing the raider part of the main quest, so you can get a max level Black Diamond (unique ski sword) from Rose.
---
As an alternative, if you've already past that point or are under level 45, the Blade of Bastet from the Order of Mysteries quest will do you just fine, as you can upgrade it as you level.
---
Longer answer:  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
single tile long rails they were in fallout 4 they can be in this game super easily
---
Eh? I thought it was just the regular premade mods that dont work, can't you mod PA if you have the plans learned?
---
12 hours later
---
Asking people to devote their attention to thinking about their inventory is way too much to ask for in this game.
---
I've tried at least, and hasn't worked. Could be wrong though, but I've had no luck with either. I lost my left leg and couldn't apply my Kinetic pre-made mod, or use any plan mods. Same for my headlamps even :/
---
You're joking, right?
---
Hey dumb shit, are you just gonna straight up go around defending bugs now too? You know it didn't used to do this shit?
---
Freddy's House of Horrors or whatever it's called way in the NE of the map.  I got a bunch of Halloween costumes there, seemed different each of the 4-5 times I've been there. I'd also suggest the ski lodges/resorts.  There are variations of the ski outfit, much like the asylum worker that might be worth something.  For straight caps value Ft. Defiance and pick up all the straight jackets.
---
5 hotdogs or 5 full 12 packs because if its only 5 then I am very disappointed in you son
---
It’s a series of quest that aren’t marked it’s not mysterious at all
---
I think you just won the game
---
And here I am at Level 60  barely surving the Burrows and having to rely on my stupidly powerful melee weapons.
---
This game is bullshit in means of damage.
---
I am level 200, i was out of ammo, headed to watoga with only shishkebab. I must hit super mutant over 10times to kill him. Every weapon i picked from them needed atleast one magazine to kill one of them. Fucking bulletsponges everywhere.
---
Laser rifle that was recently buffed still does way less damage than assault rifle. This game is just bad. But we like The sims building simulator thata why we play it haha.
---
r/NotKenM?
---
Mouse and keyboard has a huge advantage in any first person PvP situation.  Also, cheating/hacking is much easier on PC.
---
How so? Never heard of him
---
I bought the gun from a random guy in game about a month ago, so I suppose it is possible it could be duped. I didn’t rename it, it’s just really annoying, I had just got the hang of not blowing myself up with it and now it’s gone lol 😂
---
Just switch the perks and check the damage difference, the plus 1 strength is going to close the gap a bit too. But it depends if you want to play max dps Vs 1 shot, a lower damage weapon you can swing 3 times as fast will give higher dps but leave you open to more damage yourself
---
It just works.
---
That's next to my camp I think, feel free to grab a cold one at the bar hehe
---
All the lamps in the camp building list
---
Not everybody plays like that tho.
---
I have 3 weight reduction pieces for weapons 
---
One for ammo
---
And one for junk happy camper in this side
---
Been thinking exactly about this a lot lately. Just seems to make so much sense for it work like this.
---
In league of legends the 'daily' is to win a game, any game, even a brain-dead bot match - hence why I do it every day after work.
---
These daily quests are a way to quietly nerf the daily atoms obtainable for the majority of players, while avoiding direct blacklash.
---
My gf jumps in area chat sometimes... I dont know if it's because I'm around, or maybe there just aren't that many "creeps", but we've never had any problems =) Just find a few cool people, fuck the rest =P
---
I’ve not seen it before, so it can’t be tied to main quests unless I forgot. I can’t find search results about it either.
---
I have the gold skin but its not letting me same with the lever action from last weeks reward. I have the gold inlay skin on my Two shot rifle.
---
I’m sure Todd will reference this posting at the next board meeting.
---
Marine actually breaks really fast too. If you want the best coverage Heavy metal chest and heavy leather limbs are the best overall iirc.
---
I can definitely help you farm and show you some cool areas if you'd like Im on PlayStation Valley707Villain
---
Yeah - it's a dud in my book.
---
Unless you scored a great legendary weapon it's pretty bland.
---
The legendary loot I have seen is bottom shelf stuff.
---
I was using editor to morrovind and best way to fast travell was making home with doors to every city. So using objects as teleport (doors) is way older than 10years.
---
it used to not be during the beta/ first releases of the game
---
id heard aluminuim and lead also got lighter too though. i personnaly havent heard about cork becoming lighter though
---
1 min......
---
Nope, cork is the only one that gets lighter. Everything else actually adds the weight of the plastic
---
Joining
---
Someone needs a nap and remedial English lessons.
---
They will be adding a “toolkit” needed to attach mods to the atom store on Tuesday:)
---
I like my walking cane cause it cripples pretty well. 
---
But ski swords are my main dps weapon. However if you can get a good knife with extra swing speed those things can attack stupidly fast.
---
I agree. 6 eggs, 6 pieces of the costume. Head; chest; left arm; right arm; right leg; left leg.
---
Damn. Server needs reset. Follow to new server.
---
Had to try another server. I'll wait 5 more mins so anybody can rejoin.
---
Nope no mods whatsoever, freshly looted already weigh so much. I also have a piece of weightless Combat armor weighs eight pounds, i can’t imagine how heavy it must be if it’s not legendary. No mod whatsoever.
---
Really? I thought it was with a heavy combat chest. That's the outfit I'm rocking. I'll check my stats with a metal next time I get on 👀 
---
And that's why I ditched my weightless marine. Broke so fast
---
&gt;With player vending supposedly going live next month, will this be viable?
---
 It will only sell on the servers of players offering the robot on his side, very unlikely to find what you want in these conditions :)
---
from what i understand this isntanced housing is hosted playerside not on bethesda servers
---
Come on Bethesda! I just lost my 4th deathclaw today ,shit's getting real old real fast! maybe scrap the silly repair kit idea and repair the taming system instead
---
I looked at that and thought too hard. Then I went and stickied some easier ones on my map. The list was actually 75% of the height of my screen, and a couple of hours later I had only gotten through a couple of them but still ended up 650 atoms better off than when I started lol. I didn't realise there was so much I missed. Might even get enough for that Nukashine skin if I haven't missed it.
---
In general they're in the Toxic valley, I found one or two near Grafton, even tho they're named radioactive thistles, they'll work just fine.
---
i think the idea is you can create sections of hollowed out earth with usage of caps/materials and your able to build in said bunker
---
Come on guys, comment on this as much as you can so it blows up and we can get a response from the devs :)
---
No, I'm right, right.  I realize opportunity cost in a game this easy is something most people can't grasp, though.  It's ok, you'll get there, I have faith.
---
Let's try this again.....
---
30 secs.....
---
Same. I play since BETA and the daily/weekly challenges kept me coming back. Now i barely log in.
---
I think this is honestly a pretty solid solution. I liked how in the Dark Souls games if you were caught cheating you were "soft banned" so you could still do co-op and invading, but only with other flagged accounts.
---
I've got unyielding i think that does that too I'm willing to sell mine got a few pieces of unyielding stuff
---
Half stairs for fuck's sake. At least let us place the wooden stairs inside.
---
They are done bunkers and give nuka cola skins for powder armor
---
ok ill be interested to try that in a week or so since my internet is borked for the house right now i've head so much about what bulking does and doesnt do that i just dont do it less im selling to vendors
---
110+ hours here, only 1 rad storm...
---
Wouldn't weightless marine still be better? Combined with ultra light and the one mod that improves sneak speed (sleek iirc)? I don't have a lot of detection issues with any ultralight armor when using sneak.
---
the endargeral syringer is also useful and stacks upon different players hitting the same target
---
I have never seen a single radstorm and have been playing since the beta...
---
It's got the plush bunny, right? So worth it.
---
Thanks. Added the baseball bat and it matches by default so no problems there. Yes, I took numbers from the wiki but I've now gathered tools to look into the game files.
---
Interestingly, the Pitchfork curve table matches the wiki: 22/27/32/37/42/47. Yet 47 x (1 + 15 x 0.05) =  82.
---
Frito probably thinks the DF-21 weapon system is an automagical “delete a supercarrier” button.
---
I encountered like 10 times already.
---
Just go to the crack near pumpkin house and sometimes you met a radstorm.
---
Funny part is i have been only encounter rad storm there...
---
A bit of spoiler: there is a point full of robot near there tell relation why radstorm often to be encounter there.
---
Ps: i'm still bad at english.
---
 And I want half vertical walls and roofs!
---
So what you saying it isn't because wood only drops as 1 star.
---
Please please please please please.
---
ive heard that the same debuff does stack if its applied by multipule folks
---
i was wondering how people managed to survive in nuke zones without power armour or a hazmat suit
---
Over! Thanks for coming. Almost lost the loot but found it right before despawn.👍
---
It must be a random event spawn location :)
---
There’s 3 that can be accessed atm, if you go onto YouTube and search “TNT Dome key” you’ll find numerous vid’s showing you how to find the keys
---
I wouldn’t worry about energy resistance and the heavy metal chest piece when over repaired is like 140 ballistic dr alone
---
It's the best overall DR and ER with upgrades from what I know.
---
thanks i will do the run later, there is a workshop in the far north of the savage divide that does offer acid pits but i can't remember the name off hand
---
Thanks,that worked. It’s too late though,I will still be missing 2 Easter eggs :(
---
I was just using oblivion as it was the first example that came to mind..But yes using objects as doors goes way back to the 80s :)
---
4th is up yes!
---
You can buy everything in the bundle separately, it’s just a discounted price for everything together, the friends welcome sign has been getting poor reviews as it’s difficult to read with all the missing bulbs and I didn’t like the Easter bonnet so in the end I just bought the plush bunny separately
---
yeah i got this alot when fighting the SBQ at lower levels i would mainly focus on the other enemies and healing people only and let the heavies take care of the queen but then at the end when the queen just disappers or you can't loot her that is just annoying
---
:'(
---
I have more than enough ammo for the Gatling Plasma, I find more than I use and it's one of two weapons I have, but that doesn't change the fact there are a few problems. For starters the Plasma Cores are more common than .50 Cal rounds and require less materials to craft for a single Plasma Core (250 shots) while .50 Cal rounds only make 100 rounds, so if the Plasma Core spawn rates are fine that means for it to be consistent with other heavy weapon ammo types we need to increase the 5mm and .50 Cal spawn rate. Second the Plasma Core costs the same amount as the Fusion Core, but when found it's in bulk amounts, so if Bethesda does add Ammo selling as a lot of people have been requesting it (and Bethesda's been working towards implementing a lot of community desires recently) then people who don't use a Gatling Plasma will make 4-7 times the amount they would from a Fusion Core. My idea is that you find one or two at a time instead of four to seven, however it would be effected by Power User similar to Fusion Cores for those with the perk.  
---
And yeah over-repairing automatic melee weapons makes them super powerful, it looks like the over-repair damage is just a gradual increase up to +29 at 200% condition from very basic testing (on the weapons it actually increases damage for, it doesn't work on the Hunting Rifle or Minigun).  
---
And no, they're probably not gonna separate perks, but I have seen a lot of people request something very similar so I included it.
---
This game has fans!?
---
and they put up a better fight, not just hovering in the air constantly hitting you with it's sonic attack so you can't see it to fire back
---
that seems to be a user specific issue
---
You missed yesterday's Paint egg. Imo the best looking so far too :(
---
Can I have your stuff? lol
---
i have had some decent loot from Yaoi Guai considering the effort to get the SBQ event to start the rewards aren't great compared to just wondering over to dolly sods camping ground and doing the defend events there
---
Stray bullets from other players don’t do any damage unless on on the survival game mode, but yes I completely agree this shouldn’t be a thing.
---
Wait what?  This isn't true?
---
Yes you could in theory if you wanna run around not fighting but surveying the land/sky doing geological stuff rather than shoting and scraping. 
---
My ideal scenario
---
Four person team splits up on all sides and zones of the map traveling clockwise around the map at key vantage points. Than each person has the chance to spot one. Use binoculars to improve sight and range and.
---
That would be some Rad Storm Hunting.
---
Yup! Just a keycard and the code :-)
---
You’re advocating consumer credit fraud. You are not entitled to your cash back simply because you think so. A conscientious credit card company will conduct an investigation, even if they temporarily refund you pending the outcome of the investigation. If it is found that the company claims you violated ToS and are therefore not entitled to a refund, you will have seriously hurt your credit in the eyes of the card company. They will be very suspect of and possibly refuse to grant your chargeback requests in the future; in some cases they may even close your account. In any event it will be noted on your account for the company’s future reference. It is not something lightly abused. I strongly suggest you stop trying to persuade people to ruin whatever credit they have on something like this. It cannot possibly be worth it.
---
Where did you pick that up?
---
Look at that. Good to know thanks!
---
anti armor does nothing for energy weapons apparently.
---
Oooh, lucky you I don't get to do that on my ps4 copy.  I await the results, but let us know if you need some more checks done.
---
I for one welcome our moth overlords
---
Also apparel and armour separated would be a treat.
---
Also how about a grand staircase that takes 2 stairs width
---
How do you farm caps so well? I’m level 74 but still struggling keeping my caps up for c.a.m.p plans
---
I personally have no issue in tropping around with others. At lv 140+ it can be a sleepfest. That said its kinda fun helpomg lower levels get theough the harder quests. I do have some v.young hangeron who can be kinda annoying but you get that. Just walk up have a chat and off you go.
---
Thank you so much for the info.
---
I am always happy with the armor and weapons they drop for scrapping. But once you can take down a Scorchbeast somewhat easily those usually well-upgraded items are worse than your legendaries.
---
Agreed, but other players can’t kill you unless you’re wanted or have passive off, in which case you really kinda deserve it. Slap damage was removed a while ago.
---
That happened to me too. After I quit the game and logged back in, it stopped.
---
u/Valseek
---
Sometimes when going in and out the rad zone a lot you will become immune (bugged). Might be related to leaving PA a lot.
---
I'm telling people to use common sense, which is apparantly akin to kicking their grandmother in there ass into oncoming traffic. There's zero reason to carry around bulked junk unless you're five seconds from selling it.
---
Everyone seems to accept Super Sledge/Grog Axe/Deathclaw Fingers as the best melee weapons.
---
Of course, you can use any you want. But strategy seems to lean on those 3.
---
Pretty mysterious if there's no information about it readily in the game, that's how mysteries work.
---
now install explosive vents
---
There’s already raids being added for the vaults, there’s no reason we couldn’t have the ability to raid other players bunkers as well, should they be willing participants. Have it tied to the pacifist toggle or something.
---
Thanks
---
Typo of the day! Careful there, Theresa.
---
A cool idea and there are other factions going on as well I'm sure!
---
I prefer the BOS combat armor
---
Added
---
Pretty not mysterious if I’ve opened all the doors. I always go to them and people have them opened. It’s UNMARKED quest lines where you have to go through hoops to get keycards an keys to access them. Again not mysterious in the slightest
---
Not to brag but here I have pictures of two rad storms. Hehehe.
---
They’re going to sell ammo converters soon for 200 atoms.
---
Outside of a bug that no one seems to every have brought up before that would have to totally negate legendary effects what you're describing is literally impossible. 
---
Again, doesn't matter if it weighed that much freshly looted, freshly looted weapons an armor is can still rarely come modded so you actually have to check it out at a bench.
---
there are more reliable ways to get weapons and armor by the time i got to the cranberry bog i had unlocked most common mods, legendaries would be a good drop from scorchbeasts considering they start at level 50 and considered end game enemies
---
My base was in a rad storm yesterday. Looks pretty cool. I’d probably forget about the challenge and just stare at it again.
---
Anyway your best bet is to always have a friend with you, leave the team and shoot each other to start pvp combat, take a picture. Kinda cheaty but it’s silly otherwise.
---
I gave you an upvote, and I don't believe you need downs.
---
Yup was happening to my friend last night when we were online. It was every time he went into his inventory, picked up items so he ended up with 50 or so. It was ridiculous.
---
i can walk around the whitesprings golf club (when it's not nuked) and there's 1 or 2 legendaries to kill and they are the same level as the scochbeasts down in the cranberry bog
---
But how many hours?
---
Looks like your sash thing
---
Where did you read that?
---
Are you SERIOUS? I have that as a super sledge and power fist and 5 other similar melee weapons. Am I sitting on a gold mine?
---
now that you mention it there has been times when i was in a rad zone but the radmeter was at zero, i wear power armour most of the time for the weight increase, looking forward to the backpacks
---
The door on top of Freddy's is opened with the Rusty Key.  I had to look it up.  How the hell were we supposed to find it without cheating?  You also get a gun that has no ammo. Up to you to find it.
---
Or people haven't noticed yet. It took me a day or two to notice my excavator chest piece was gone.
---
That’s what You (we) are being rewarded for. logging in everyday.
---
There is a small orange “safe” in the basement of one of the cabins outside the main base. That is where it goes.
---
In the past when getting into my power armor or logging in with it already equipped, the parts would either all be unequipped or is still have just one arm piece equipped. The other pieces were in my inventory, not on the ground but maybe it’s related. It happened rarely.
---
Dude speaking my language!
---
Yes I lost a power armour excavator right arm and leg. Happened not long after I changed the name. 
---
I have my 4 full sets of power armour, I never pick up or scrap them. 
---
They just vanished.
---
I lost a calibrated leg too except I don’t have the plans so I have to buy them. I would just buy the mod off someone but I guess I want the plans anyway. Still sucks.
---
Finding an Instigating Fireaxe made me try melee out for the first time since a level 1 machete.
---
Depends. Premade mods don’t work full stop, crafted mods usually work but don’t on some specific things.
---
Thank you
---
Twice the pride, double the fall!
---
Seems to be a common problem. Lost leg and arm also
---
These parents who allow their children to play games like this are also the first to persecute the rest of us for swearing or adult content used over mics. While they bought them (fully aware of the over 18 rating, etc) or play them themselves in perfect view and earshot of their whelps but it's always up to millions of us to monitor our age appropriate behaviour, while they NEVER even bother to monitor their own children's behaviour. Sickening!  
---
Fallout games never have been and never will be meant for children, that's what Disney and Lego are for.
---
P.s. lvl 31 melee
---
You do know that the devs from 76 are a new acquired studio in texas right?  Ya its Bethesdas tech but a new crew prepping for a new IP.
---
I've been pretty bored recently. I could go killing shit.
---
lvl 130 melee
---
That's the exact reason why when I encoutner a kid in a mature rated game I make sure to swear more than usual. If I find out the parent is listening I make sure to insult their parenting skills as well.
---
Maybe they want us to find radstorms together, ya know..like a game
---
You should be using martial artist for the swing speed increase, and that lowers the weight by a healthy amount as well. I think 60%? That would make the weight just 8.
---
Other than that, the game isn’t completely balanced in terms of damage to weight, you’re right about that. There seems to be a slightly realistic approach to that. Super sledge is made of heavy materials and is therefor heavy, the pole hook is a stick and some metal and therefor light.
---
The minigun tri barrel mod adds a crazy 18 or something pounds for a total of about 41 pounds. Possibly because the weight of much longer barrel extends away from you and therefor feels heavier than it really is. The dps drops considerably and the damage per round increase is tiny so I can’t think of any other reason. It saves on ammo but that’s not good enough.
---
Weapons often spawn with mods already attached.
---
u/valseek
---
In the Atom Shop there is.
---
stable flux needs to be protected like hardened mass, the time and effort it takes to gather the materials to make stable and then to lose it because we forgot to transfer it to our stash
---
LMAO, props to you!!
---
Survival mode is not the same as Adventure mode once was.
---
There are people who enjoyed the lite pvp elements, the potential of being attacked, and who support junk loss as a punishment mechanic. Without consequence there is little excitement.
---
Survival mode is a much different beast from the original game mode. It's shoot on sight pvp, spawn camping, and losing far more than just junk.
---
Why not as Bethesda for a Casual game mode instead of making Adventure into ultra-easy mode?
---
The real question is, is it worth crafting any armor? or just use the ones that drop from enimies.
---
My thoughts exactly. Best memories of this game doing just that
---
It’s actually 8.16466 which is rounded to 8.16 kg YOU LITTLE LYING SHIT.
---
Yeah but you’ll lose a huge amount of damage.
---
Are you on PS4?  I can help out I’m a level 115 :)
---
Let's open a door and it loads into you waking up on a trailer with inmates on it. Todd Howard, you've done it again.
---
i know the challenges are supposed to be for the new camera but has anyone tried using the existing camera, the game doesn't say it has to be the new camera so you should be able to use either?
---
they just wood floors with carpet on them though right?
---
You may have to relog if you haven't..tho I believe the egg went up like 8 hours ago.
---
I did notice this egg isnt the first option on the 'featured' tab, it's on that tab but I had to scroll over.
---
In the early days when I was a melee build I would silently fume because the super sledge was my best weapon so I felt like I had to use it, but the idle crackling sound gave me headaches and I had to turn the volume down. When I found a good roll on a three star regular sledge, I danced.
---
Gotta get those numbers up boi
---
Yes, any stealth multipliers apply. A 200 damage instigating weapon with 3x multipliers will do 1200 damage on the first hit.
---
I have a melee Weapon, explosive shotgun and a few two shot or explosive heavy weapons, I can use them all, I just have to switch perk cards when switching weapons. I don’t use it myself but there’s a mod on pc where you can have perk card load outs.
---
I think if you put the item like fav, you cant transfer sold or scrap
---
Better than server lag
---
The idea is that since all of the weapons you get in the game are craftable, they’re made of heavy shit like steel rather than plastics.
---
I think every time I play. Why cant I sell it. Maybe they don't want people to stockpile ammo?
---
Fasnacht balloons go on the top shelves. I've put footlocker and toolboxes on them, lamps, plants, the nixie tube alarm clock, radios from what I can remember. I only had balloons on a bookshelf as I have two as a makeshift bar for people to sit down on stools at. 😆
---
Why cant you just be entertained by things and not get so butthurt?
---
I haven't seen anyone talking about this, I guess it could be a potential spoiler if you'd rather the surprise, but I believe I may have discovered our Easter reward for collecting the eggs. 
---
If you go to an armour workbench and toggle craftable headgear, you may see what I see: an Easter Mascot mask. It's a tattered white bunny with pink features. It says it is free, but I cannot claim it as of yet, clicking it doesn't open an Atom store link.
---
Go see for yourselves! I noticed this last night so perhaps it's actually available on the store as of now, but I can't say.
---
You can’t damage them anyway, slap damage was removed. If you’re afraid they’ll kill you since you initiated pvp, turn on pacifist.
---
Yep, the bottomside is same as the basic wood.
---
I would like to know this too, especially given how bad the prices for buying and selling are.
---
You can’t. Slap damage was removed.
---
Where are they in the camp build menus? Can't seem to find find any of the ones I've gotten
---
They've responded numerous times. Just get over it. The challenges were screwed up this update. Not the end of the world. Aw you're precious atoms this week! What are you going to do!!! Ahhhh!!!
---
Mods not working. Plans still work. Fix next week. Weapons and all armor mods kaput until fix.
---
It's now closer to 8 billion, think its at 7.7 billion, so I'm sure there is someone out there with a ripoff name like that lol
---
Totally unrelated to this post but will there be any update to taming? I just lost my 4th deathclaw and it's really less than great.maybe some sort of tether we can repair like the Brahman pen?
---
Just keep that attitude to the internet kiddo. I’ve seen full grown men die for less.
---
Also, Bethesda ARE cheapskates. That’s a fact. It’s not subjective or a conspiracy, it’s a simple, well known fact.
---
I’ve been accidentally shooting people since the beginning lol. I’m basically worried about being attacked back when it was just an accident. Even if your not taking any damage, i can imagine it’s not fun getting shotgunned In the face
---
r/unexpectedrunescape
---
Floor decorations in the same row as the deathclaw statue, and I think you have to exit the game completely and restart to get the new egg to appear in ther store.
---
I would just use the metal / trapper but I haven’t I’d heard of anything that makes those armor pieces better than BOS and Marine combat and I have more than enough on my main account to craft full sets I just wonder what would be better to store in the new accounts stash for later use
---
Floor decor. If you can find the deathclaw statue it's there.
---
Last war egg is pink
---
Yeah. Haven't been able to find them still...
---
It's like they're not there
---
Someone gave me a thumbs down after they shot me in the face (presumably by accident, I think I startled them in the burrows), but by that point I was already returning fire and I wasn't at all impressed by their choice of emote. This all happened in about 3 seconds mind you, but if that person had access to an 'I'm sorry' emote, I would have probably stopped shooting. Maybe.
---
Then give him Skyrim, not Fallout!!!  The FO series is full of sexual innuendos, swearing, drugs, etc because it's meant for us NOT him. My parents would never let me play anything with the advisories this franchise has and for the exact reason these advisories give. The world has sooooooo many games that are open world made for him your kid literally doesn't need this one.
---
Personally (At 5K caps now was at 25k) I just farm and bulk junk. I play every day even if it's only to log in and sell 1800 worth of gear.
---
It's not too difficult to get up to high caps. Find a good spot to run for a type of junk or go afk farm one of the workshops. (Or do both at the same time). You'll be rich before you know it.
---
There is the metal grid one which is fine if you want that industrial look but you can see through it.
---
Doing your dailies and random events is a fast way to get caps too.
---
I had to scroll backwards the first time. Left from deathclaw us where the eggs are on xbox
---
It is the Bone Raider PA. The glitch was introduced last patch when this skin was added. It shows up even when you haven't purchased the skin.
---
Neat, or something...
---
This has happened to me, my hubby and 3 other people we play with. More than once. One guy lost 4 of his PA pieces. No, they weren't scrapped, sold or dropped. I am 100% certain of this. I have also posted a thread about this and multiple people have commented that they have the same problem. It blows my mind how some people will insist that this is not a real problem just because this hasn't happened to them yet. And I say YET because, mark my words, if this isn't fixed soon they will most likely experience the same problem.
---
I was doing the Dogwood Die Off Event when I ran in to 5 or 6 kings. With that many, you cannot run and you cannot hide. With their constant sonic attack, I was basically stun locked. Needless to say, but I died.
---
They want you to do these with your friends.
---
Cheers friend!
---
My torso disappeared. Name wasn't changed. A team mate lost 4 pieces. No name change either.
---
While I have only been inside of maybe 3 or 4 radstorms (level 218), I must say that I have seen a lot more. Back when I was living on top of Seneca Rocks southern top I had a great view of the entire Appalachia, and sometimes one could see a great green fog cover some distant area. Of course I never went into it, knowing what it was, but I must have seen a few dozen from up there at a distance. 
---
So... while I agree that these challenges are insane, for those that wanna try to do them, build on top of Seneca Rocks, server jump and scan the world for green fog. Probably more rare than running into Grahm, but still... doable for a obsessed madman. Don't forget to bring friends that can PvP some for you. Oh, and don't forget to bring a camera. Which does not exist.
---
Oh man...
---
Only thing that changed is their health pool which end up in me needing hit them 2times. Anoying. Only 1 legendary in whole underground and ghouls have worst legendary drop pool, here go wood armor from 3*.
---
On the other hand in city are super mutants who have decent rollz and you can find 2-5 legendary per relog.
---
Raw flux stays in your aid compartment so you've been to a crafting station to craft stable flux, there's no reason why  between crafting the stable flux and going to an event can you not make a small detour and drop it off in your stash.
---
Late to the party here, though I've been playing for all this time, I too have noticed this. As a stealth char, I'm basically interested in either the instigating effect on a melee weapon, or, what I thought would be, the stalker effect. 
---
I was hoping the stalker effect would actually extend the reach of a melee weapon while in VATS. I ran some tests just to find that the 95% hit chance range was the same regardless of the stalker effect, at least between instigating and stalker. Same distance for both, to acquire that hit chance. So, yes, it appears the stalker effect on melee weapons is **useless**. As someone else mentioned, if the effect was similar to what we had in Fallout 4, I believe that was the Blitz perk, it would be something of value. As it is now, it the stalker effect on a melee weapon seems to have no value.
---
If You are using laser rifles, it may be that hard. Even after buffing update. Poor BoS soldiers died because useless weapons.
---
Same here so far it seems to work really well
---
if you don't know to Google what they are and how to open them, they are mysterious because the game itself certainly tells you nothing about them.
---
now i wish we could put down nukas for the price of 1 nuka per placing it down..
---
picture the collections you could make
---
Me too, just happened today... a calibrated shocks leg and I can't mod it myself :(
---
Amazing, thank you!
---
Can’t see comments on my own post
---
I saw this work once, and not work once tonight, so there might be more going on here.
---
Well, they are a lot more resistant (unless you're using the surface-to-air missiles) but their attacks are just sooo boring. Wendigo can pounce you, turn invisible, it emits creepy sounds, hisses and whispers. Also, both the Wendigos and Deathclaws drop truly useful items like gears and screws...
---
I just got a Kingston 480Gb for cheap. I didn't do any backup, deleted all and downloaded the game again from the scrap to make sure the game was. Finally the fast travels are quite noticeably faster. Random stuttering while exploring, has gone too. :).
---
I'd say i notice a 20%-15% faster loadings in general. Definitely worth it. The graphical engine still struggle to load some far objects, the draw distance is......meh, but this is the engine's fault, it's a matter of optimization tho. Only Bethesda could something about it.
---
Though this method may take lots of time and server hopping, you can go to the Wendigo cave and kill the wendigo over and over again. Each time it will give you from 5-8 screws along with some other good junk components and weapons (it can sometimes drop a handmade rifle or a gatling gun). This is a guaranteed Wendigo spawn location by the way
---
Maybe fix is going on server side, one by one
---
+1. Same experience. Game is more enjoyable now, for sure.
---
Same happened to me with power armor chasis and whole excavator set, since it had paint i accidentally dropped it and destroyed it. That feature would be very good.
---
When they vanish, they return to the spot where they spawned, you will find their corpse there.
---
and yes this can be a pain if you dont know the spawn points of the mobs, best advice is to search around on all the bodys you come across, since one of them is the mob that vanished for you :)
---
This was discussed already a couple of days ago. Easy way to turn this into an *extra stash exploit*.
---
Unless your proven guilty
---
Well you could of server hopped lol I get that you can take them as a mechanic but it's kinda rude lol
---
Yes ik I just phrased it poorly I'm saying I always thought it was a gas not acid so that's why it could go into buildings
---
Not saying there isn't a bug (or attempting to assign blame to anyone), but I recently lost a piece of armor myself. In my case, I noticed shortly after an Encrypted event, and imagine I probably dropped it during the chaos of things. I'll occasionally inadvertently open my Pip Boy during battle (like while trying to Tab out of VATS), and probably hit R (drop) while mashing Reload. It takes a certain amount of bad luck, but I've only got 5 Luck.
---
Beyond potential bugs or user error, what I'd personally love to see is a confirmation before attempting to drop specified or legendary gear (favorited items wouldn't do, as there are only so many hotbar slots and most probably won't want to waste them on armor).
---
Awesome idea. That would be useful to make yourself to-do lists.
---
I think this is done just for shits &amp; giggles.
---
“Need” yes. It’s still fun to do it all yourself at least once, and feels rewarding.
---
Me too last night.
---
Plans work, just modded some T-60 legs for someone else the other day. Make sure you have the right perks on and that you actually learned the plan (basic stuff I know, but I've bought plans without reading them and wondered why I couldn't make the thing an embarrassing amount of times)
---
Use proper English and punctuation, please.

BY THE BEAUTY OF YOU ARE CREATION
---
Had this very bad yesterday, logged on twice to find WS had been nuked both times.  
---
Killing glowing ones along the cabins and 1 in 5 corpses is disappearing, but only for me, the guys I'm killing with still seem to be looting the spot where the body was before it vanished.  
---
And to top it off, I killed. Legendary glowing on in the golf clubs and my killing shot knocked his rag doll back through the wall pushing him into the dead space behind the bar where the doors have the "closed" chains hanging. Well impressed.
---
I get that. I'm a sniper build myself but I still get in there and have a go
---
I wish this reddit had a search function
---
Lead is so easy to get. Lucky hole mine + excavator arms = 240 or so lead ore = 600 or so lead without super duper.
---
Though I wouldn’t mind he extra .50 ammo I could make.
---
A long time ago I lost my Excavator helmet. It was back when auto-unequipping power armor pieces was a problem, only this one ceased to exist when I checked my pip-boy (it was modded, not sure if that makes a difference.) 
---
Seems like it's mainly a power armor issue
---
Happened to me and my hubby, as well as 3 other people we play with. Not just PA pieces. Clothing items too. I'm ready to put the game down because of this.
---
Yo you can get lit up on fallout? I'm in
---
Are you on PC? I'll gladly replace them if you can provide the materials :)
---
Not fixed. It works sometimes, sometimes it doesn't.
---
Yeah, I am so glad they finally fixed the text chat and perk manager again. The game is so much better with those.
---
Yeah that bummed me out. Still looks nice at least
---
Are you selling or buying?
---
I can sell you a hunters long coat for 5k

To celebrate this unity the gourmands would like to invite you all for dinner.

\-THANKS ign Parolax
---
Yep doesn’t make sense
---
I have an AA fire axe with swing speed
---
I had something like this happen, for some reason a bloody skeleton was I'm bedded into my model and it kept blocking my vision. Blowing myself up with grenades and dying fixed it, relogging did not
---
I killed a wendigo a few days ago and it crouched in place just chilling and waving around a bit like they do when they’re not aggro for about 30 seconds. 
---
Then, bloody mess kicked in and it exploded into a mess of scrawny limbs. It was great.
---
Great work on updates  
---
Some Suggestions:
---
\- Site: Pls add Meta-Data: Title - Headlines ... get it indexed right -&gt; let it show up right in Chats / Searchengines / Links
---
\- Weapons: possibility (no must!) to pre-group weapons by category
---
\- UI: Fill left-right the same time (as the opposite field is "blank") - or copy-option left&lt;-&gt;right
---
\- Data: please place the data json SOLO over at git - so you got that part of work off here and simplified / standardized  
---
\- Calc: Limbs, Stealth, Crits are another multiplier class (reg. x2 - +100%) - but dont stack / those go flat - highering the complete paperdamage
---
As you need any help on Layout, UI-Design too \^\^ ... let me know
---
Hard to tell, but if you play on PC the worlds are usually quite populated.
---
I asked this same question awhile back 
---
If you don’t have the Bethesda launcher running it brings up a login page 
---
There is a ini tweak to auto fill the details if you want me to post it? You have to keep your Bethesda password in plain text though

Have a friend share hard bargain perk, another share the perk that boosts charisma by one for every member on your team, and last shares the perk that makes effects of alcohol x3.
---
I’ve found Mutton Chops after searching an aid container which is the most basic recipe for sheepsquatch meat. I know this ‘cause someone else posted that they found the meat after searching a blowfly corpse. 
---
I’ve also found the Brahmin with quills and heard the screech but I’m not sure how that’s sheep related....
---
I have a dual purpose camp
---
It has 2 doors, one leads to the lower levels of my shop, the other leads to a rooftop bar
---
I usually just block doors depending on what I’m doing

Have fun with your new outfit!
---
They are doable. I have currently two. An animal, bug hunter. And a broadsider heavy support build. 
---
All builds are doable. Just matters how and what you make of them. Not everything or everyone needs to top tier or meta.
---
thank you very much,i was tired of farming for that robat
---
LOL yep
---
Skyrim vets know to never leave home without at least 50 potatoes in their pocket.
---
It's hit me and quite a few other. It's one of those things that sound like  "they must had dropped it/traded it/sold it and they're a moron", until it happens to you.
---
I started my main as someone who could carry friends that are just starting out so high charisma and high intelligence, rest of my points are spread out to make life a little easier. 
---
This is not the meta- this is as far from the meta as it gets- but I have way more fun farming out materials and making sure my squads guns and armour are in peak condition than min maxing to rag other players in PvP.
---
It does feel like I'm being punished though, I wish there was more of a balance between dealing damage or making and maintaining things. Some of my friends can get up to 2k damage with melee and I can fix a gun to 200% and it breaks within 20 minutes.
---
Are you satan's tiger?
---
He's coming may time with the vault raids or the new dungeon in the trailer
---
The thing is that these custom effects often are having zero protection against. Stealth boyed person full of dieseases can use Plague Walker mutation to kill assassin sentinels by moving around.
---
And these?

The first link has multiple other links of people claiming the same, and more in the comments. (It also has a reply from Valseek). 
---
Likewise in the rest of the links there's further people in the comments claiming they lost items, in some case multiple items over a period of time.
---
And there's also comments in this thread of the same.
---
So possibly people are upvoting because they think they had the same issue?
---
We need the same for holotapes. Huge percentage of the story is told by holotapes and managing them gets increasingly difficult with every new quest. While exploring the new “dungeon” i found out some holotapes in terminals. I either had to stay on the terminal and listen to them while ghouls charge me from each direction or eject the holotape and listen to it later. Needless to say I couldn’t find a single one in my inventory because i have hundreds of old ones. At least they should tag the new ones.
---
You were told truth. Explosive has been removed from non-projectile weapons, which include all energy guns. You can't drop em anymore, hence they are now called "legacy items". If the game is alive in five years, it will be ridiculously expensive item.
---
Ah I'm PS4. Wish they'd sort out this cross platform stuff as there's people on XBox and PC I'd love to team up with.
---
Gofukyurslf326 I'll be on for awhile
---
Kiddo? Wow you're cute with your attempts to infantilize me. 
---
Also no, you're wrong. There are very valid reasons for the challenges because they are in fact challenges and not press a button for free atoms.
---
i often buy stable flux and hardened mass from other players while exploring and then before i have chance to get back to camp or a train station stash that's when the alert pops up on screen with just a lower level player there so i go over to help them out forgetting that i still have flux in my inventory
---
was their itching as well as flaking or just the nausea and constipation?
---
Like, this challenge could reward 1000 atoms, then it might actually feel fair. Unbelievably difficult, but worth hunting
---
That will learn them 😅
---
Yep almost every log in for last 2 week's
---
And you don't even need to speak. The emotes can perfectly communicate enough to help you team up and follow someone around the wasteland.
---
I love this game so much for the encounters I have had. I've been playing in survival mode for my main playthrough and it ads so much tension when another player is near yet more often than not they are some much higher level guy who just wants to hang and help me.
---
You just wouldn't get that in any other game.
---
the Wendigo's are really creepy and you usally hear them before see them which can make for a better fight
---
Good to know it’s a fallout problem and not my PS4 lol
---
Yes! And now I'm triggered. Also getting lead from cast iron or steel gym weights. In fact, almost nothing should contain lead except for outfits which don't.
---
Their penance for this insanity should be to change the stash to 4000-5000lb which is shared by your 5 characters. 4000 wouldn't even be more than we have now. You'd just have easier access to your stuff.
---
Just for you I will Ok 😆
---
It is running, but I do run the game from a shortcut, so maybe I need to run it from the launcher it's self..
---
Thanks for the ini tweak offer, but cba with that :)
---
I got the daily plan for the pink egg and realited this that the colore blobbed egg plan disappeared...
---
Theirs are explosive..,,
---
Legendary armor
---
I tend to get frustrated dying or not doing damage due to not being a high enough level for the build to come together. Where rifleman builds are quite balanced all the way through.
---
Nope.
---
Well that makes sense. Kinda wish mine was now

Pretty sure that was it

The CAMP is so restrictive compared to Fallout 4, which itself was quite restrictive until you started using the rug glitch. It's stymieing creativity I feel. The fact we only have one roof set, are lacking the crude, thrown-together raider type perimeter wall set from 4 and many other things is a constant downer.
---
I'm on PS4 unfortunately
---
i’m not sure, probably the may patch, it’s def coming
---
I’ve done it. And ran to my bag super fast. So far so good. And every time, I think I’ll remember next time

[](/kcelestiabeautiful)No one can know till it happens(not even bethesda based off the camera incident), but from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ayliv8/massive_roadmap_speculation_and_datamine/) I dug up from a month ago it sounds like it's coming with player vending. Take it with a grain of salt tho, a lot of it is old conjecture, or just plain wrong.
---
Amazing. That I'd love to see. Any pictures of it you could share?
---
i was so shocked on how short it was
---
Every world has max people. Plenty of players dw.
---
want to hear a weirder one? i can put the exca bone skin on ONLY the left T-51 arm. not any other T-51 pieces, only the left arm.
---
same thing happend to me but my attacker had friends and would wait till I kill there buddy to back attack me. weirdly they were able to kill me once but on the last kill they couldn't do damage to me.
---
Hey, my psn is TrainerSeb. I'm usually on most of the time if I'm not at work or out and about.

Psn - brm138 anyone feel free to add me
---
No ya don’t (at first).  You can have a great time just walking around the “Forest” to start with until you get a good feel for it, and have discovered everything in the “Forest” and taken (and lost) a few lower level workshops.  Then when you have your “Fallout” legs you can team up to start to get into the harder areas.  As you do “Events” you will run into other folks, who at a higher level will show up just for the XP, Aid and junk/plans, and will be glad to help.  Get a mic and use and you will be surprised at how much folks want you to enjoy.  Don’t carry junk (store always), don’t be afraid of getting killed, and expect once or twice to be attacked by other players but remember it is a movie where you are the star.  I am on my 4th character and finally broke lvl 70 and have enjoyed playing each character as they leveled up as it is never the same game twice.
---
That's so cool. Thanks!
---
Having a similar issue. Sometimes corrects itself, other times can require a hard reset. Probably will be fixed with the patch next week.
---
I’ve put hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds) of hours in FO3, 4 and 76, and I still mess up UI navigation; my muscle memory can’t handle all the permutations of shoulder buttons, triggers and D-pad (I use a controller even on PC).
---
I know there’s a lore reason for the Pip-Boy interface to be atrocious, but I’d beg Bethesda to put it aside and rework it into something useable.
---
floor decor
---
i don’t have it, but that looks pretty coolllll kinda want it
---
They weight nothing; I just dump them in the STASH after I listen to them.
---
The Sheepsquatch can be done with four or five people if they understand how to actually do the quest, I think the pylon thing confuses a lot of players though.
---
I have had two bugged SB queens this week though, one of them was my nuke too so it was extra annoying. Other than that, I'm finding the game to be fairly stable.
---
Jesus it’s like 1 millions the same posts about “impressions of burrows l” and everyone just say the same things. 
---
Maybe stop? Read some posts about burrows before? 
---
Maybe nuke it?
---
Even if found guilty after the trial you still get your property back.
---
You seem misinformed. 
---
The game caps your resistance to damage, so to close the gap they use dodgy, serendipity, blocker, etc. Then you go fireproof and dense to negate explosions.
---
A single vats critical to the head will deal full damage to one of these builds, often killing if low health. The radiation damage from radium rifles and gamma guns is negligible to these guys. They see you shooting a mile away, and they WILL kill you in one shot with a proper bloody build. 
---
Staggering them with high RoF weapons quickly, vats critical headshots, using stealthboys to avoid vats, and plasma grenades direct hit are the bane of the sentinel build. I know because I am using Sent/ass armor on a bloody rifle build. For some reason plasma grenades just destroy me, people one shot me with vats crits sometimes, and I am often staggered to death by auto explosive wielding stealthboys. 
---
You can jump to counter the stagger, but it uses ap. And because of dodgy, you die pretty fast after that. Even in "i am invincible" armor. That's why auto explosive weapons are effective. (Alot of ap drain.)
---
So let's not call it "i am invincible" armor when there are plenty of ways to counter it. That is how two shot and explosive got nerfed so bad in the first place.
---
Of course they need to survive to be able to take a nuke-zone picture of their friend wearing sunglasses and a swimsuit, while being intoxicated, drugged and crippled. Gotta work for your 10 Atoms these days 😌
---
True ❤
---
I was running an unarmee build for a while, was so disappointed to find that I still couldnt use a power fist with power armour.
---
Add me. Psn: purpleduke_15
---
Nope not when it comes to online games like this. You may want to do some research, a ToS even if you sign is can't take away you're rights. Not to mention he never said anything about breaking any Tos. Anyways I told him in pm to do the chargeback due to being lied to by Bethesda about never selling anything but cosmetics. So not consumer fraud.
---
It needed to be at least 5 times longer than that to call itself a typical mmo dungeon.
---
Had this same problem. Remove as many games off your Xbox to free up memory. Remove apps. I only keep Netflix. Rest I just watch on smart TV. Make sure if you use photomode to save your photos to OneDrive before doing this. Uninstall game. Takes a second. Hold down the power button on the console for 45 seconds. This will defrag your Xbox. Restart Xbox. Reinstall game. Dont do anything till update completely finishes. This has stopped me and all my friends problems. Takes a couple hours if your on WiFi but it's worth it
---
No because I like picking peoples loot bags. This would make it so there would not be as much loot. I don't like this.
---
Happens 9/10 times with ticks for me. They just explode
---
just use what ya find, repair anything that doesnt need ballistic fiber, or craft new leather until 50.  
---
its just not worth it and ya outgrow it fairly fast, when i level i use whatever drops or craft some basic leather.
---
yeah, i thought it was gonna be some huge sewer maze thing with tons of enemies. wrong. but i suppose they didn’t say it was huge but most people expected it
---
I have a camp destroyer build
---
I use the perks and a fire axe to chop doors. Then I plant some explosive and use a flamer to burn peoples camps down.
---
I am roleplay a arson/mad bomber man
---
I'm not trying to defend this shitty move, I think they should have changed the challenges over to ones completeable in game. Just leaving these is lazy and looks really bad on them.
---
The reality is that as the game goes on, in-game atoms will be harder to get and/or less valuable. They need people buying atoms at a certain rate to validate all their free content. And we are gonna see little tactics start to be used to achieve this. Like more difficult challenges, and timed items in the Atom Shop that do not give players enough time to earn for them in-game.
---
What the fuck. It was never in the store it just kept saying the ones I had.
---
I think the thing I like about your idea most is it's got a goal for what you will do with it not just what the build is.
---
Strange sounds like you have something wrong with your computer than as I'm running it n a 10 year old computer with a phenom II x4. 955 OCed 16 gigs of ram and a 980ti. Without any crashing at uktrawide resolutions.
---
Link to those comments? Because if you read them again you'll see I still mention the abusing reports.
---
Yup run along as soon as you get proven wrong.
---
If u have issues you either gotta close and restart FO76 because it usually don't show it if youre already loaded. And if you've done that and still don't see it, enter the Atomic Shop directly from the news bubble where it talks about the eggs. They change every 24hrs at 8PM EDT.
---
I wonder if bethesda knows and is planning to give a day to help us people who didn’t restart the games out.  :(
---
Thats not min/max you need damage and damage only
---
Sure /u/aten_ra did all the math you can either check his posts history or just ask him. He is very active and we'll liked and trusted in this community.
---
I've had it happen on stating the game (from launcher), but only at the press to continue and never during a server hop.
---
It's only happened a couple of times (played since beta), after my machine has been on a long time and possibly has had a net interruption.
---
Restarting the launcher (and relogging in it) fixes it for me.
---
On PC I would pay for it around 6-7k
---
I don't really think that's the way it works, shotguns do weigh more than pistols because they are bigger and contain heavier material. I do the same kind of damage with a combat knife (about a pound) as I do with a with a supersledge (20 pounds). My handmaids weigh more than my gatling guns which the gatling guns do more damage. Weapons are not heavy due to damage but due to some weapons are heavy, sledges are heavy because sledges are heavy.
---
I've had no problem getting my cash back. From a dunbass cop who tried that, ended up getting the dumb ass fired. Lol
---
Probably not :(
---
Too much nukashine
---
&gt; Site
---
Okay
---
&gt; Weapons
---
Counterexample: I can't tell which melee weapon is one handed or two handed but finding them by name is more straightforward.
---
&gt; UI
---
Half of the fun is to fill in the properties
---
&gt; Data
---
No.
---
&gt; Calc: Limbs
---
Don't want to get overcomplicated such as making a full player/weapon/state configuration.
---
&gt; Calc DPS
---
Don't have reliable data on firerate-affecting mods/effects/perks/mutations. Also useless by itself as you'd need a specific enemy health to consider.
---
&gt; Calc: AA
---
What is NRG?
---
&gt; As you need any help on Layout
---
No thanks, I want to keep it simple and straightforward.
---
Or at least add some relevant sorts to each list... Ie Sort(Food), Sort(Chem), Sort(Recipe), Sort(map), etc etc
---
4 People. Thats how much Members a Team can have and thats how EVERYTHING in this game is balanced. Just need the right weapons and Perk Cards, like in every other Rpg.
---
“Farewell to Arms”.
---
Yes, it could happen to me and I would just think I did a mistake. Because it already happened a few times, except I realized my mistake.
---
I would love to have a "Ha Ha Ha, No." emote, for when people approach me and emote "trade"?  
---
I'm waiting on player vending and as a result, I am hoarding plans, which considering their weight is not helping my stash.
---
My record is 12.5 before dying a little bit for an hour.
---
Run your other 4 characters out of the vault. Park them at a train station. Buy and learn 1 serum recipe on your main account. Buy flux for 50 caps each from the market. Make 100 of that serum with super duper on. Pass those serums to your alt accounts. Sell them to vendors for 400-500 each. 7k per day, takes 20 minutes once you're set up.
---
Better armor than power armor huh? I find my ultracite with emergency protocols gives a lot more survivability than my full unyielding sentinel set
---
Same, actually! I’ve always kept a limited weapons stash but early on when I was trying to figure out my weapons build it was a problem. I’ve more an issue now hoarding clothes because I’m a fashion diva.
---
I use the “No” emote in situations like that because the player model initially gives a thumbs up then changes. I think it sends the message across pretty clearly.
---
Anecdotal, but I seem to find more random crap on the floor these days; not things obviously dropped intentionally like spoiled food.
---
Ok my gt is LL oryx ii
---
I love my 40mm grenades too! 
---
I regularly swap 5mm for that at an exchange of 1-4 because of the grenades complexity and the fact steel and lead is relatively easy to farm.
---
I have around 500 in my stash at the moment 😅
---
The power plant is bait for people to walk up and destroy you lol
---
Daily posts about daily quests to get free mtx currency is getting ridiculous. Make daily quests reward just caps and xp.
---
To keep my inventory weight down, I leave paper bags of ammo at the vault door or the Overseers camp. 
---
My first day playing someone had stuffed a garbage can at the Sutton Station with tons of Plans. This made my day and "paying it forward" comes easy. 
---
-Started out with all of the instruments, there had to be 30 plans and recipes at very least. Some food and water.  -the best feeling
---
Cross platform would be perfect
---
Sheepsquach is fine, the only time I havent been able to defeat it is when I took it on by myself and i am rubbish.
---
As for the legendaries, i feel they should drop better loot but there should be far less of them.  As in you would only get to see one maybe once or twice per session max. 
---
Tl:dr If you kill one, you get good stuff but kill them less often.
---
I don’t know what mine is, but it’s the only 3* item I’ve ever found. I think it has increased limb damage, increased damage on mobs on low health and reduced weight. I hate using it because I’m a rifle build but it ends up outperforming everything else I have.
---
LMAO
---
Why the downvotes ?
---
I like the balloons.
---
Its with the deathclaw and power armour statuettes.
---
At least give us variants of the stairs w/ platform that aren't the god damn wire mesh floors. I don't want wire floors, I want the nice atom shop floor I bought. It's frustrating that I have to either not use it or settle for it being mismatched.
---
Make the time to stash or you could lose your items.
---
i know they are getting really out of hand, 200+ hours in and i have yet to find a radstorm
---
Makes for some trippy photos depending on the filter.
---
Gotta love how the community does stuff in this game.
---
We've got people with armour pieces disappearing during server jumps, it seems to be more than just gamer fail.  
---
It happened to me months ago (took of my chameleon chest plate for the Big agility kill daily, it was gone when I re-equiped it) and I assumed I had dropped and just took it as a sign I should go to bed, now it turns out there is actually a problem.
---
There is a half height wall in the game already, I wasn’t able to snap anything to it though.
---
Go back to the taxidermy shop. Go to top room, bedroom or Calvin’s office, I forget. You’ll see a poster board with lots of pictures and string. There are four “unsolved missing persons” quests you can start by clicking on 4 sheets of paper posted on said board. One of these leads to smarty’s big critters traps etc.
---
from the amount of junk i tend to carry around you woudn't miss the hardened mass but it would be nice to be able to focus on playing tag with the sheeptron than trying to find a paper bag, how is it if the sheeptron touchs you it's instant death (not even being able to call for help)
---
Concrete deposits?
---
The monorail elevator. There’s a bunch of bags around the top
---
Pole hook is i think a Harper's ferry plan, should be in the neighborhood of 200 caps from the vendor, I'd go 50, but i don't have one on hand lol
---
I know, but it’s too high too use for anything like this :)
---
Ive met a few cool people. But time zones are an issue sometimes as I'm in the UK. And tbh once they hear I'm female its like they all get a hit of testosterone and act like idiots
---
\^This
---
Just fast travel and hope there's a Deathclaw there. I found one on the first time, for the last two daily's.
---
I honestly didn't think anyone used them.  You use the auto launcher or the m79?
---
M79
---
if i make the flux myself then i do but if i'm buying from another player i tend to go back to whatever it was i was doing and forget it's in there
---
Abondoned Bog Town have 3 Concrete extractor.
---
Unless you buy one it can't be explosive energy wounds don't drop anymore
---
Its just a  new location to explore. I think most ppl expected it to be a MMO dungeon but its not. I had fun exploring it and gathering alot of junk and I did it again today.  Although i found a key in there but idk what its for..
---
If you're a frequenter of Survival, players can kill anything from your Camp without any consequences. This kinda acts as a deterrent. You also lock the door if you don't want mobs wandering in.
---
Or even better. You get a random piece of either legendary gear once a week on the same day and whatnot (think Portal Knights) but it's different for everyone OR you get a random plan you don't have. 
---
That would be a cool mailbox system.
---
and  New river gorge bridge has 4-5 close together, by the nuclear wast drums...
---
Mods? Better inventory has made my stash display only part of my stuff. Fix custom.ini if the answer is yes.
---
Could you let us know this build you use, I’m lvl 105 (although anything past 50 shouldn’t be any different) I’m melee and I die repeatedly and when it completes I’m usually in a group of ten or more players. It should be more accessible to many rather than having to know a specific build when the card system is confusing at best for most players with many cards overlapping in description....
---
Spoiler:
---
If you were dissapointed there were only "a few ghouls", then I hate to break it to you about the burrows....
---
If you're on PS4 and have the flux I'll make it for you.
---
There's been a big uptick in post about items disappearing. Two or three a week has been normal and can be explained by fat fingers. But it's been more like 4 or 5 a day all week.
---
My best gear is going in my stash for a bit. If you have stuff you absolutely can't bear to loose, if do the same.
---
Don't you find tossing a regular grenade easier? because you get to keep your other weapon in hand.  Plus grenade perk gives you the throwing arc so you can pinpoint it
---
Skyrim is fairly full of sexual innuendo and etc too, although it is a bit less obvious at first
---
The biggest problem (on consoles at least) is that most of the time I play with a friend, and others are too. And we're always in our own chat party, and we can't hear other players.
---
Gnomes and bags at Vault-tec Agriculture
---
I read a lot of posts and this issue...this issue looks really not good
---
Some of these challenges have gotten really fucking specific for no determinable reason other than increasing grind.
---
You don't understand how legendaries work in this game. That +str is the best possible roll in SLOT 3. Its the only roll that will increase the weaponts damage output in that slot, because strength affects melee damage and carry weight. The second best roll in slot 3 is absolutely light years behind it. Reduced weight maybe? Who knows. The other options are a bunch of shit that wont help your damage output.
---
Swing speed vs power attack damage can be debated, but most players prefer swing speed. Personally i only want power attack over swing speed on instigating weapons. And a 40% swing speed increase on a fast weapon has the same effect as a slow one. A 40% increase in dps. 
---
Anti armour is probably the most overrated effect on melee weapons. Incisor 3 gives 75% armour penetration. Anti armour is multiplicative to that perk, so it's only ignoring 50% of the remaining armour (25%) for a net gain of 12.5% more armor penetration than a vanilla version of the weapon. Bloodied is a full on damage increase up to 50%. So even if you dont perk/armour/mutation a beautiful bloodied build, you just let your health get low, bloodied will still put out more damage.
---
OPs weapon is a perfect roll for someone that likes to play bloodied 1 hand.
---
This happened to me the other day after I was down and stimpacked by a team mate. My skeleton was poking through the skin (only noticed cuz I was wearing a bathing suit). Glitch followed me even after resetting, logging out, etc. Only way to fix it is to die and respawn.
---
Power plant.  Plop down a concrete extractor along with the fusion core generator.
---
Lmaoo like only on this sub would a comment like this have so many upvotes. Point and case!
---
What's your psn? Not sure I have any at the moment but I run a lot of tech datas ect so they have a way of creepong into my inventory. I can always give you a shout when I've got a few, saves just dumping them.
---
Ofc I use it! But I like m79 too!
---
This was  suggested  in the beta, they have too much confidence  in their awful  technology.
---
Yes, all energy weapons no longer drop with the explosive effect. Hang on to that bad boy.
---
tommy_n1ghtmare it’s psn
---
Thx dear sir
---
Feel free to add me too! xa0t1ca (the middle o is a zero)
---
I only have a mic now and then but perhaps not having one could help the anxiety anyway. But I always have 500 plans to give away free and I have a fun camp
---
[](/celestiablink)You mean next month? The vendor comes out [May 23rd](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/wIDGIptP0rBhyIitypnwO/32fccfa369ba99be13ab079b3dd73619/Fallout76_WARoadmap_NEW_FULL.png).
---
Soon^TM
---
I'd be less salty if they just learnt to hot fix. I'd like to mod my gear again and have daily challanges that don't require an item that hasn't been implemented.
---
Well Bethesda did mess  this up by allowing duping in the game. 
---
They have access to everyones inventory if they say a player had over 100K of a rare item I believe them. Banned players have plenty of reasons to lie I do not believe them.
---
They said they would reinstate banned players when they have fixed all the duping issues. They obviously haven't fixed it yet. So keep ypur panties on it'll be a while before the banned players get reinstated.
---
Worst is when its your caps, I’d say. lol
---
I was soloing the imposter on a level 42 char without getting killed last night. Admittedly the event would have run out of time and failed if others hadn't turned up to do a bit more damage but it's really not hard.
---
^ Though be sure to throw down some beefy turrets. I've had multiple scorched beasts attacking the bog town.
---
Makes repair costs hazardous.
---
More than you’d think I bet. Probably ~100,000 or more per platform at least
---
Sadly yes, the first time it happened I thought I did something wrong. I know I didn't accidently sell off my PA pieces the second time.
---
When I first saw 'Pearly Peepers' in the quest reward list I immediately looked through my inventory to see what it was, seeing it was in the weapons tab I clicked on it to equip it or see what it was and it just completely disappeared from my inventory.
---
Looking it up online and seeing it's a variant of binoculars I wonder the normal pair of binoculars in my inventory had anything to do with the glitch I encountered.
---
I personally believe that ALL name quest dropped items should work like the MoM gear, sometimes the quest items are the best you get for some time.
---
Yeah - I agree. Looks a bit dumb ass ( as they say in the US ).
---
It's all about the mods for the armor.
---
have they pushed it back already? it was supposed it be this wasn't it
---
[PS4] Given this has effected me I will modify your Excavator PA and craft calibrated shocks if you have the flux.
---
If you have a quantity of steel, I can make you an inordinate amount with ammo smith and super duper.
---
Coming with the next dungeon seems more likely. The new vault raids aren’t here until summer
---
i know i mainly login for the dailys at the minute and they can't be done
---
Oh I wasn't used any turret there before, If you play at Pc, I can help you for defend event. So you can farm concrete without use any turret. :)
---
I lost my TSE handmade when I hopped servers. I immidiately noticed it and recorded the last 10min of gameplay so I could see if I didn't drop it or anything, which I didnt. So I contacted Bethesda support and they told me: "Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items."    *sigh*
---
I love the higher DPS for two-handed melee weapons argument... because it is so wrong.
---
Pure melee build here and I run with a Cultists Dagger, it has 2 good legendary stats and +1 strength which as you say is kind of pointless, but the other two effects make it so I can outkill anyone with a two handed melee weapon.
---
40% swing speed and Vampiric.
---
You ca go round one-hitting things and that is great and all, but in the time it has taken you to swing that big ol' weapon once, I have stabbed said enemy three times, killed them and am halfway through killing the next guy. Beyond that any enemy has a chance to block our hits, which takes far more time away from you than it does for me. 
---
And because Vampiric procs health regen *on hit* I am permanently regenerating health during combat.
---
2 handed is just too slow, even if you have the 40% swing speed, it's still far too slow
---
2 handed: Take a swing, maybe kill, take another swing, get another kill, take another swing, get blocked, take yet another swing, get another kill.
---
1 handed: stabstabBLOCKstabKILLstabstabBLOCKstabKIllstabstabstabKILLstabstabstabKILL
---
Plus one-handed is great for nukes zones and tagging everything without inconsiderately one-shotting things
---
R&amp;g processing has about 12-15 bags out back. I think out back of generals steak there are quite a few gnomes.
---
The first rule of fight club....
---
True.. take it if you mean you paid for a recall card and then a load of low levels show up (no offense to low levels, you gotta start somewhere) 2k down the drain lol
---
Seems this has been popping up for a few people lately. Mine wouldn’t go away even after logging out, restarting console, etc. It happened after I was revived during a fight, and the only thing that fixed it was dying and respawning. Besides looking creepy, it’s impossible to play a sneaky bitch cuz your flesh covers the view zone. Just safely stash your loot and get yourself killed, respawn... worked for me!
---
On PS4, but I appreciate the thought.
---
I have Home Defence 3, Contractor 2 and science 2.
---
Let's just say my Workshop defences are excessive. Heavy turrets, rocket turrets, heavy lasers, 3 artillery pieces. The whole lot. No expenses spared. XD
---
[](/celestiafrown)I dunno, I pulled it from [the release article for Wild Appalachia](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7spR5VGdwJYkYTIy8Cufnv/fallout-76-free-wild-appalachia-update-now-available). If they did change the image that's really sneaky.
---
I’m wife picked this up after getting killed by a Scorchbeast yesterday. She not noticed if she still has it though.
---
Lvl dont matter that much tbh, I rather have meta lower lvs then higher lvls of noobs. Most ppl dont get the meta and dont care, still wonder why things are hard. And yes I meant the recall card.
---
Hey as long as they join in and take the hits like everyone else I'm good. Dieing is part of the game
---
I’m most worried on how it’s gonna work. I’ve heard you’ll be able to trade legendaries for tokens and you can use tokens to reroll certain legendary effects on guns. For example maybe you have a nocturnal or mutant slayers weapon with  limb dmg and reduced weight; from what I’ve heard you could use a token and change the first randomly. To me this HAS NOT been confirmed. And honestly knowing Bethesda it’s gonna be terrible. They pump us up for good content and it’s McDonald’s cheeseburger at 3am quality
---
If they are taking part and I have the stims 9/10 times I will revive them regardless of level but otherwise....
---
I think they pushed back PLAYER vending (to May 9th)
---
So basically, there are two types of auto-scrap. These are: "Scrap when the player presses scrap all" and "scrap for components in order to build something".
---
Historically in Fallout, items have either had both of these as 'yes' or both as 'no' (For example, the Assaultron head).
---
The issue with bulk junk is it needs "scrap all" as 'no' however it still needs "scrap for junk to build new stuff" as 'yes'.
---
Bethesda have to do a simple but annoying and fiddly bit of reworking to get that to work *properly* in a non-hacky way.
---
They should make it a free area to destroy Camps without getting wanted.
---
Yep, you can build there, but no do not expect any sort of protection. Destroying the turret camps would also give people an outlet to blow off some steam.
---
Well Im pointing a finger on, especially, players that run passive cards on their builds. On sheepsquatch, death is most certain a thing.Im talking about leechers who dont even know they are leeching.
---
You do no damage in fact. Slap damage in adventure mode was removed a few weeks back. Now you can only damage someone if they attack you back
---
yeah player vending did get pushed back i remember that
---
The trading system is a goddamn nightmare. Absolutely needs a complete overhaul. While they're at it, they need to include a trade log, something to let them see who's trading what with who. Put an end to this whole duper or not problem with suspended players.
---
They sure did that, but I thought he was talking about the legendary vendor since he mentioned it in the post.
---
Take time to read notes, listen to holotapes, etc. they range from hilarious to downright heartbreaking, but all the little side stories add a lot to the game.
---
PA mod plans have been working for me. Purchased individual mods have not
---
I was able to put a jetpack on my t51 yesterday?
---
They could just be mistaken. I haven’t seen anything about pushing it back.
---
Yeah, it's a shame people don't work together as much as they did with Fasnacht. I think that was the aim for Bethesda. People did initially but now it's gone totally the other way it seems
---
Still can't find the BOS Combat Armor legs myself. Been farming the usual spawn points and so far nothing.
---
PSA this happens when they die too far from their original spawn point. I know it's not a solution but you can try to work around this by not trailing enemies too far before killing them.
---
Thanks for the explanation!! I'm going to try out the dying by them with my group as a test to see if we can purposefully activate it.
---
It's Burrows; stop giving me RuneScape flashbacks
---
yeah i got the player and legendary vendors mixed up with all the changes to the dates
---
Mod attachment has been broken since the last patch.
---
You might be aggravating the spam filter because if the official forums are anything like this sub, where everyone and their dog makes a new post about this matter rather than making even the feeblest attempt at searching first, the poor thing must be well beyond its tolerance threshold.
---
Thanks for the big heads-up, I've been wondering the same with my xo1 mods
---
There's a deposit right across the road from the overseers camp
---
lol :)
---
With the obscene number of these posts in the past week and a half on this subject , I'm surprised the Reddit mods haven't pinned something to the top.
---
Yes, there are also my 3 eggs.  But one I learned is gone now...
---
*kill the scorchbeast queen with a rifle* You monster
---
I have no idea if I'm partly or even wholly to blame, but in my time playing i've magically lost 5 god-tier left arm pieces, and 2 god-tier weapons.
---
I have no idea how it happens, and I only ever notice some time after, all I can say is something odd is happening. That, or we need to greatly expand on the anti-scrap safety mechanic they added last patch. (to include dropping, selling, trading - Anything equipped, high in value, renamed or favorited)
---
I use deep pocketed leather armor; if you can get your hands on a full set it’ll add +50 to your carry weight. I put a couple points in just to have the pack rat and strong back perk. I have a hoarding problem 😩
---
I’ve literally decided to stop playing until something is done to prevent fear getting lost due to bugs, accidental scrapping and accidental dropping. I lost a full set of x-01 with calibrated shocks and jet pack that took me months to farm
---
No mutations currently. 
---
I have Superduper currently sitting in the spot for Starched genes on my main, buts that a swap in/out Perk. 
---
I want one, and only one mutation for each of my characters. 
---
Egg head for my main
---
Chameleon for my Alt. 
---
I do wish having multiple mutations wasn’t a thing.
---
Ermmm…. isn't the cap limit 25K??
---
Yeah, I've got mules, and I dont expect to get 50k lol
---
I didn't name it and I definitely found it myself fighting a super mutant I believe. I haven't named anything yet because I'm too lazy.
---
Can other people see you pose when you're in camera mode? I thought they could only see your pose if they were in camera mode themselves?
---
Have to agree with Murdom. If you check the base stats on a triple meat hook depending on your perks and buffs, it can often do twice the damage of a maxed out combat knife.
---
Im level 158, I run a bloodied build with the Radicool perk, and base damage on the meat hooks goes from 220-250 without rads to 450-600 with a health showing about half red.
---
Combat knives swing faster, but the hooks one shot most any level 62 or lower mob for me, YMMV.
---
Find a high level group to help you clear West tek, whitesprings, and the burrows and just rely on the fallout builds site for where to lay perks into(also any chems you get make sure to use as these are highly beneficial)
---
Yeah it worked for me too
---
Yeah totally. I’m not complaining, In fact I’ve not had a problem with adhesive, there’s a few places I go to for a pretty good looting.  I do however struggle with lead at the moment!
---
Some of the new camara challenged are "craft film" and stuff that you physically cant do yet
---
Have fun being one shot in PVP with your one handed weapon.
---
Don't be a dick in nuke zones, that's certainly fair enough though.
---
Vampiric is overkill at an unbelievable level in this game that showers you with infinite aid and enemies that are wholly incapable of moving your health.
---
You realize that if you're running a low health build, like for this weapon, your str's contribution to melee damage will be capped, right?
---
I'm in Dublin. I'll happily team up anytime if you're on Xbone.
---
I didn't know Abercrombie and Fitch was a thing in the Fallout universe.
---
The “nomads choice” is just having the camp system placed where you want - then you only pull out what you need when you need it.  
---
No bells, no whistles, just necessity.
---
The burrows is also mainly where I see it. I’ll get a swarm of 6 or 7 and go to loot after I down them all and can only find three or four.
---
That sounds like a challenge in itself resisting all that building!
---
should it, though? as it is now, the only special part about it is that its useless, i'd rather have it drop like regular legendary armor than have it be locked behind x event, its just regular armor after all.
---
aside from it being the best looking gear in the game ;)
---
They don't work, have never worked and probably will never get fixed. Sorry to burst your bubble
---
'course it does.
---
The swimming rads and the collecting rads are completely different rads.
---
The former are very slow rads, like snail paced ones, and Aquaboy/girl allows you to swim faster than they can so they cannot get you, the latter are much faster and as soon as they see that hand approaching the surface of the water they are ready to pounce.
---
I learned this by eating the mushrooms that grow on the back of the Megasloths.
---
I've put my best gear in my stash and am rolling with my second best stuff for a little while. Not totally convinced there's a bug claiming peoples stuff but the number of posts about gear going missing has jumped this week and I'm not taking any chances with my BE gatling laser.
---
Power armor and the power fist just belong together. It’s crazy they weren’t compatible in 4 and still aren’t. Have them attack via modding to the gauntlets. One or even two at a time. Or have on on the left side and something else in your right so you’re dual wielding.
---
Sounds odd. I've had the gold skin since it first released way back when, and I got medical malpractice maybe the first day or two of that challenge, and painted it immediately.
---
This is what is happening.
---
As long as I've at least hit it, they have stayed within a radius of me
---
is your autohotkey working with fallout 76? mine doens't work. Im trying ADS toogle macro from fallout 4 but it just doens't work on fallout 76
---
God no but it’s not too low either.
---
&gt; McDonald’s cheeseburger at 3am
---
Wow don’t slam the late-night munchies.
---
Oh nice then! :) Also I found some bag of cement at Harper's Ferry. Next to chemistry workbench that around vendor. Maybe you must check. :)
---
You can't craft legendary effects would be one that makes them better
---
Cool, sent inv from both accounts. I've got a few chars so I'll look you up when I've got anything.
---
Haha I love McDonald’s just the quality difference is very noticeable
---
Bar stuff has already been put in the game files :)
---
That sounds delicious
---
I'm ps4 unfortunately or I'd have taken you up on it, thanks though
---
It's been happening since the beginning, I have had it happen and my kid had it happen also.  When we had it happen we thought it was somehow tied to the rumor that people could steal your items, I do think that is incorrect, I think things are just disappearing in odd situations for people.  Months ago people would really harp on that it is NO happening and it is likely something you did to cause it.  What I find funny is with every other oddball problem here and there with this game, that is not in the realm of possibility?? 
---
 Bottom line is you need to be OK with the possibility because if it happens to you, nothing can be done about it.
---
Everything nerfed. Legendaries only drop drills and wooden armor. Everyone is using commie whackers with actual nerf bat skins.
---
Sure it could be nice I’m in game now
---
Not at 3am
---
Where is your camp now because some places are asking for trouble. Whitespring or Charleston station for a start.
---
Once vending finally releases I’ll spend all my time going to ppl camps :)
---
Someone get this kid a waaahbulance and take his French cries
---
Melee, guns, and nades too
---
Ahhh, great!
---
I want to place wooden floors on flat terrain with no foundation. That would help tremendously
---
if you go to the bethesda launcher its one of the article things shown below the "play" button on pc.
---
if youre not on pc heres the link https://bethesda.net/en/article/4gWcpeopiSywMb5GCpPAem/inside-the-vault-new-survival-challenge-rewards-and-more-april-18-2019
---
I destroy anyones camp who camps at the pond next to Charleston train station. That's where the responder bot spawns and he won't spawn if idiots keep camping there. So yeah you're right about asking for trouble there lol.
---
So long as it’s stable you’re good. It’s not a demanding game in terms of internet speed, though I wouldn’t be trying survival. PVE is fine, just make sure to stash junk when you can, just in case. I used to only have data as well. It sucked.
---
Okay okay considering the state of ones mind if they are up at 3am I will agree. But if ya sober...eh
---
Well the sub has 150k so you’d think that’s equal atleast 40k per system
---
This would explain why I’ve spent 112 level wandering around aimlessly and why I’ve always got to munchies.
---
The welcome mat is a must for me. I’m in love with my most recent camp but I’m sick of spawning in the middle of the lake and contracting parasites EVERY. DAMN. TIME.
---
I keep mine hidden out in the boonies away from regular farming/loot spots. Griefers are going to exist, because they are sad lonely people. They do need to make a bigger no build zone around the golf course though.
---
So... They go into survival and run away when they encounter a player that attacks them? Lame, but I don't see how that affects you. Can't you just go find other people to fight?
---
Armor doesn't affect the buildup of status affects at all.  The cryolator, even if it did quadrouple the damage it now does, wouldn't be useful in dealing damage.  You purely want the status effect - a two-shot, or rapid fire one with a vats build are the only things that'd make it more effective in this context.
---
Assume these were limited time?
---
Yeah, the Cryo and a handful of others are fucking worthless in every context except this.  You can literally down this thing in ten seconds once you freeze it, even at full hp with a shitload of really bad players around.
---
its 100% a thing. i lost one a few days ago. first time i noticed anything like that and it was only because it was my favorite weapon.
---
That thing gets crazy strong when 10+ people are around.  Honestly though, there are two kinds of characters in this game:
---
Those that run %-based damage mitigation perks, and people waiting to respawn.
---
You don’t have to keep your weapon repair perk on for combat....
---
I also want to be able to snap upper floor segments to foundation floor segments.
---
I have the issue on my ps4 as well. Some places in the forest are orange when the sun comes up. Keep forgetting to get a picture. It's bright.
---
I but it up in the left corner close to a farm on a field
---
Yeah, it's like the assaultron head. Loads one at a time.
---
I used to throw Molotov’s at peoples camps and then run up in my firefighter gear with my axe and level it
---
I will name him DogMeat :D
---
Stigma attached to TSE soTHATS why you don’t use them?  That’s a stupid reason. Repeatedly spawning/dying in a nuke zone?  Should have checked first, then spawned somewhere else. Can’t solo the Sheepsquatch?  That’s the point of the emotive game... team play!  SBQ, fair point. The rest sounds like whining to me.
---
Just make it so you cant build OR REBUILD while you're inside a Nukezone. Problem solved. Camp there when you drop the nuke? Not anymore, Camp spawned into nuke zone? Its gone now. Want to rebuild but you're inside a nukestorm? Yeah, right! 
---
Simple, effective solution.
---
I don't understand why they dont have a low wall for the staircases, so we could build a loft without a massive hole to fall through.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I’ve heard the 1hand ski sword is the best for pvp because it will stay under the damage cap
---
Well yeah, I just enjoy doing it and seeing people double take as they notice the warble up on top of the weapons work bench or on top of a vendor
---
They did hype it as something special. New area to explore!  Find the secrets!  Etc... I was surprised by how short it was too. If I had gone in expecting another fort defiance type place I would have been perfectly fine
---
Molotov cocktails.
---
Aaronholt homestead? Was it definitely other players because there's a lot of ghouls,bugs, mole rats and bees spawn there and it only takes one of those things. I watched a level 1 molerat chew through someones generator in a couple of minutes once. It was at Charleston Station so that rat was awesome.
---
  It is a slightly high traffic area though as it's easy cranberries and power armor.
---
the man saves them for molotov cocktails, think me that bassballs doo too(grenades)
---
I'm only like level 36, how cow people! Ps4 as well.
---
Ahhh, ok, that makes sense.  Duh.  I didn’t even think of that.
---
Personally, I think executioners is an underrated effect.
---
Modding stuff has been broken since the lying lowe update. Hopefully this Tuesday they'll fix it.
---
You've just got to server hop Charleston Station or Lady Janet's Soft Server. He's hard to hold as he either dies or walks off after a short time.
---
I play a lone bolt action Hunter with medium scope and survival based perks. It's not meta at all but it's fun to feel like you're really surviving off of the land
---
it’s been an issue for everyone with all mods since the last patch i think, the devs know about it and i heard they’re going to fix it next week
---
Riggyriggs28, I'm not a teenager tho but I'm still down. I'm level 36 I think, going for the Melee build. I don't even have my camp setup yet. To busy roaming lately. But if anyone's down let's do it!
---
Wonderful.  If I lost any of my PA pieces I would be pissed.  They are all modified to the hilt.  FU Bethesda for yet another glitch you aren’t fixing
---
I thought there was a fast travel welcome mat. I played Thursday night and when taking over a workshop, I was sure I saw it in there. I'll take a look today to confirm, maybe I read it wrong.
---
Xbox player here. Sort by spoil and the food is always at the bottom.
---
I agree completely. It'd clean up the clutter. That and a key ring and holotape holder or something.
---
Except, when **he did**. You don't really understand what "following closely" means, do you?
---
I think that they should make bulking use wood instead of plastics, because wooden crates are more durable than plastic bags and would be less prone to accidentally scrapping back to the individual units
---
2 months later and its still happening..
---
Sounds like you need a better internet connection bud . My games been running great for 2 months now
---
I don’t destroy there camps, but god have I been tempted too. On PS4 it was a nightmare for quite the while, every server someone had a base there
---
It’s so frustrating 
---
I own an auto grenade launcher and it’s a shade under 7 pounds.  My trusty AA handmade rifle weighs 23 pounds!!  Yes it’s totally modded but WTF
---
I just wish the Bowie knife was useful at all. No mods and almost no legendary drops. It's a shame that most of the new weapons in game don't have alot going on with them.
---
Too much daytripper
---
Make an offer?
---
If you perk all the way up and it’s explosive you can get to about 300dmg without chems or mutations.  I had Adrenaline perk on 5 and saw it jump to almost 450dmg.  
---
The 300 is plenty BTW
---
Yeah, I’d uninstall it too.
---
I can confirm that it was still there for me!
---
Finished it up two days after leaving it.
---
Rngesus taketh and he giveth.
---
I’m not familiar with Cincinnati, where is Kings Island? and who is Mason?
---
it is.  what planet you on???????
---
It was meant to release with player vending, but it looks like they delayed that as well. So most likely it's going to be a part of the player vending update.
---
Why do they have to be upper floor, why can't they just be floor.
---
My gauss rifle weighs almost as much as three suits of power armor. How dies that make any sense?
---
It definitely works sometimes but not all the time. Before it would be blank all the time. Meh.
---
Seriously, you need to go back and look at [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share), and stop being a disingenuous, white knighting douche about this.
---
He had **366,071 Ultracite rounds** in his inventory, which is not possible in the 30 day period, as Bethesda listed, regardless of what "mathz" bs you want to again, not cite.
---
Nah, friend of mine changed his name and we can see it! :)
---
I get that damn damage glitch when I use my explosive handmade. So I’d personally say the one with ffr.
---
My Bloodied Explosive Handmade kills every player realy fast with the 40% ignore Armor magazine!
---
I like your idea, like shipping crates? Then we maybe can make bigger units, like 100 steel or so!
---
Encounter: Super Mutants Gruff
---
Description: Occurs only on bridges. A trio of Super Mutants attempt to cross a bridge, only to be attacked by a vicious Sheepsquatch that intends to eat them.
---
Had originally considered it being 3 Sheepsquatches but that'd make the encounter a little TOO dangerous, so, opted for the role reversal.
---
Do you intentionally use the wood stock by chance cause it suits the survivalist style?
---
Well I'm not a PVPer, I am just saying I can kill enemies faster than a 2 handed player. 
---
When I say constantly regenerating health, that is under the assumption I have taken some damage. You know when you are in the middle of a crowd of high level ghouls or super mutants, one or two of them might actually get a hit on you, especially super mutants, they use these things called guns, which fire bullets at you from a distance. Those bullets hurt you, albeit only slightly, but when multiple enemies are firing on you, surprisingly enough your health may start to slightly drop. 
---
During *those* situations, yes I am constantly healing.
---
Also down the road from the Auto Shop! (I can never remember the actual name, but it is along that same road.)
---
I do! I'm sad I missed the atomic shop camo hunting rifle skin, and I only use leather armor that I crafted myself. My one legendary is a weightless leather leg.
---
well vendor caps are instanced already, you just need to wait 20 hours for them to refresh. if everyone could just sell all their stuff all the time, the value of caps would go even lower than it is now, and they’re already pretty worthless in late game. try selling your stuff to players if you really want caps that bad
---
Which magazine is this?
---
I def saw a "fast travel mat" in the camp buildable section for like a week. Don't know if it was a glitch or a real but not added yet thing.
---
When I last hunted them they kept circling and coming back to the general area. Never had to chase them very far.
---
If you have .50 cal Explosive then aim for the rotors with VATS and disable those. The rotors have very few hit points and after you disable even one it slows down.
---
I saw it too, but I can't find it again
---
 Hit it it once so it becomes hostile towards you then Destroy all the vertibots, it should circle around you. Then aim for the thrusters so it loses its speed. I mostly encounter those in the area at top of the world. I also have 2 nuclear keycards for sale though
---
The cap limit is to encourage trading between players so it's unlikely to change.
---
Aw hell I got video of a ghoul that's dead but he is up in the air walking across the golf course
---
u/akarnokd made a great [weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) 
---
With max perks/mutations, the base bloodied does almost 3x the damage of an AA. 25% fire rate still wouldn't overcome the DPS from the slower bloodied handmade, at the cost of more ammo.
---
Noooope.
---
Chucktesta.
---
It would fit in real life too, companies spill tons of toxins into the kanawha river that locals know not to drink from the tap. Who knows what a nuka plant using that water would cause!

The perforating magazine
---
id be interested in the power fist if youre on pc. i dont have 25 k caps but mabye id have something youd like xD
---
There’s dirty and toxic water. 
---
With aqua boy, I get no rad dmg from dirty but I will from toxic water
---
I think, *theory, that some places that pool dirty water have radioactive barrels, like some mines, the cranberry bog, the ash heap, the disposal site.
---
You’re getting proximity rad dmg from the barrels, not the water.
---
I carry a prototype haz mat suit, for just an emergency
---
Yes I’m aware of Charleston but what’s the other thing
---
Bowie knife is great, has good base damage, good swing speed even without mods, only issue is you like you said no mods, it sucks cause with literally one extra dmg mod and Bowie knives would probably end up being one of the top weapons in game. 
---
Sorry if I’m being a fan boy but they cost nothing to repair, and if you get a swing speed your DPS is through the roof. Bowie knife needs some frickin love
---
&gt;Weapons  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Counterexample: I can't tell which melee weapon is one handed or two handed but finding them by name is more straightforward.  
---
&gt;Data  
---
&gt;No.
---
The Data will allways be accessable somehow &amp; will change in future releases
---
so the main point is how to keep it up to date properly  
---
My idea is: Let people help you - or in your words: a "straightforward" process 
---
define the data needed .. let people provide it - would be gr8 if you think over this again  
---
 
---
&gt;Calc: AA  
---
&gt;What is NRG? 
---
Energy Weapons
---
Got your other points for sure - after all its your project and only suggestions
---
Yeah, when you kill something and you can see in its inventory something you really want then poof. It's disappeared. Makes you really wonder
---
We're they traded/ bought? Or found? Im guessing it's some anti-duping method gone terribly awry. (Not in any way saying you duped). I lost a TSE pipe pistol I bought off a vendor in Watoga, and a set of weightless legs some upper level dropped for me after a SBQ fight.
---
Well a no build zone behind the golfclub would be nice. Idc about the other building areas.
---
Ty
---
Perforating, I thought it was only 15% AP though? It also only holds 20 rounds. The stinging magazine holds 35 with a 7% (I think) AP value.
---
I could be wrong about the AP %'s, but that's what I've seen.
---
I really like them too, but finding any legendary combat knofe St all seems to Trump them. I don't know why they don't have a serrated mod. Same with the sickle. They made unique weapons and just kind of abandoned them.
---
Ive had this happen too. Try Fast traveling to a location with good junk loot and approach the items you want to pick up and they disappear before you can hit the button to pick up the item.
---
I'd love to have a Mole gauntlet mod for PA right arm and a shield mod for left arm.
---
SSSSHHHH if you dont move he wont wake up
---
This would be a good idea. Especially for helping the new ones coming out of the vault.
---
It only got 20 shot but it ignores 40% armor and its perfekt for non automatik
---
I take out one of the vertibots first, then they all circle the general area.
---
It's down the road from Aaronholt Homestead. When you find it you've got to follow the road north until you see a tipped Whitespring bus and the spawn point is just behind it. It's just as random as Charleston but requires less orbital strikes as noone camps there.
---
Might be some random reward. I could have swore I got my lever action or handmade plan from one of the prison events. Can’t remember which one.   But for the longest time the handmade and lever action plans were very elusive. So good luck
---
I RP as a mannequin every time I'm afk, but I never get visitors...
---
i keep my chat on auto, that way i can talk in team chat but can still hear people on area chat
---
I believe I saw it at the resort
---
I always get downvotes on this post because folks don’t know the difference between raiders and griefers. I don’t mind, can’t say I blame them.
---
I’ll give the prison event a shot and hopefully get lucky
---
Didn't know it. Now i want more strongely this dungeon
---
Bloodied explosive is best for damage output. Many pvp players have explosive perks on but with the bloodied prefix it makes the explosive and ballistic damage go up as health gets lowered.  And if you have a tse bloodied, then it gets op
---
Well she is, the bitch.
---
It's for the locked gate just before the room where you have to turn the valve to open the terminal door.
---
If you're in survival and you haven't used it...
---
You're not alone...
---
More stair variations are needed for sure. The amount of space the standard staircase requires is frustrating.
---
Oh ok thanks
---
In fo4 I used to name my good stuff "z Rifle" and "z Armor Piece" so they'd always be at the bottom of the list.
---
I believe they commented to a Reddit post that it will be fixed in Tuesday's patch.
---
Sound I’ll give it a shot, any specific place to look?
---
The wiki is wrong about that, and hasn't ever been updated.
---
Looks like my #'s were wrong too, [posting about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apmlz3/on_the_effectiveness_of_armor_piercing_magazines/).
---
So 20%, and 30%? Still better than I thought.
---
Does that happen pretty consistently?
---
Do you get the damage bug regularly in pvp?
---
Ummm black powder maybe, I remember it was a lot of caps
---
Many events have a chance to give a random plan, so it's just patience. I've got the stimpacks recipe from the messenger three times. Outside of tjat, the prison event is good.
---
If you're on Xbox, I'd be more than happy to give you the plan myself.
---
Just a guess, I did not really time myself. I did die twice, and I was sneaking through all of it as not to get swamped by ghouls
---
Jims1973 you sir are a saint of the wastes.  I’m going to hit you up on PC sometime soon.

Honestly it's COMPLETELY at a parent's discretion what they give their kids to play or expose them to. In addition it's a non-issue if you explain those "adult themes". Kids are capable of handling those conversations, especially since they will be exposed to them someday in their actual life, and should have knowledge on how to handle them. 
---
And I'll stand by the statement if your kid is playing it's your job as the parent to help them through the game not everyone else's on the server.
---
New "dungeon" that was release this week.  and then I also realized  I spelt it wrong, it should be Burrows
---
I asked about this awhile back. Ive decided that since you cant sell to the vendors, I just give it to the new players or I drop it in the floor at flatwoods church in front of the responders vendor.
---
And a pile of ammo and stimpaks
---
Grafton Station or Greg in Grafton. That’s where I bought it.  
---
I hope you have loads of spring and adhesive... getting the lever mods cleared me out.

Real life there sometimes sounds so close to fallout76 already, it's indistinguishable.

" This included a meeting between industry lobbyists and members of the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.
---
“You hear all the time that this is what happens behind closed doors, but you never see it,” he says. “They were literally writing the law. So, they were crossing things off, they were saying what they would and wouldn't accept, and their word was as good as the law. Nobody had any power against them.”"
---
"“Scientists who try to do the right thing, they get fired. So what happens over time is they just stay in this agency of sort of non-enforcement that is trying to protect its funding, is trying to look good in the eye of the public, and then you have officials who run these agencies that are appointed by politicians who are beholden to corporate interests, to the lobbyists, and so what happens is there is a culture that, like a trickle-down effect from these top officials, and that's what creates this culture of non-enforcement.”"
---
Good points and I agree on most. But the crashing puzzles me. 
---
I have about 350 hours on PC and I really rarely crash or freeze. Maybe once or twice a week I freeze when trying eat or drink. Then there is an occasional crash maybe once a month. The game has problems but for me the crashing has never been as bad as many have reported.
---
Most of the times I have crashed I have been playing non stop for more than 6 hours.
---
Thank you, and sounds good!!
---
Unfortunately I’m on ps4 but I’ve also got the a good of plans from the messenger, but I’ve never seen the prison event pop up before.
---
When I played that way, I used a 2x1 platform and squeezed all the workbenches and a stash box onto it. If you wanted to, you could add a third platform and get in a bed and an instrument as well.
---
There are 5-7 bags behind the R&amp;G facility. Sitting behind a shed, between it and the hillside. Like 8 or 9 gnomes at a small walled garden on S side of Huntersville.
---
Encountering this bug is like playing Russian roulette. You may get lucky and it works other times you may fail and it doesnt work.
---
I mean you can’t google it Bc nobody has put it on the wiki lol
---
Whether a game mechanic is an exploit or not depends on player intent? Nah.
---
Agree. I used to think like that too until it happened to me last night. I've always thought that those people probably sold / dropped their stuffs accidentally. I lost one of my 3 \* armor. I realized it after I saw my total weight carry was under my usual number. I thought I didn't have grilled radstag / ribeye steak food buff but then I checked my armor and I was missing a piece of my armor...
---
I've had my camp across the river from bakers ferry for quite a while now, down to the southeast. It's tucked away in some trees and I don't have any lights there, so it's hard to find
---
If you are selling you bulk junk to vendors, I see the issue. But since only aluminum and lead (and maybe cork?) actually benefit from any weight reduction, I'd say save your plastic for shells.
---
I’ve seen both vendors have it but I just don’t have enough to buy it.
---
Idk just aim for her wings then her head then her legs in vats and try and crit shot her as much as possible
---
No
---
And they are a colossal pain in the ass to find.  Almost as bad as bleached dogwood.
---
Enough times to question why is the game encouraging drinking = better trading? Even though it should impair judgment while trading.
---
Some events don't start unless someone is in the area, Fast travel to the prison if you're in the area to see. 
---
Honestly though, I'd recommend just buying the plan. It's barely more than one days caps.
---
Why is the scrapping of bulk such a big problem for people?
---
Plastic is easy to come by and plentiful all over the area and if you have bulked something then don't use the scrap all command and scrap everything individually.
---
Not wanting to troll, but really can't understand the problem people are having with this. Yes, I have accidentally scrapped some recently bulked items and felt stupid after it. Then I learned from it and remember not to scrap all after bulking items.
---
My favorite spot so far is south of the southernmost watchtower, to the West of Watoga. I park myself on the cliffs It's only like ten caps to fast travel to Watoga station, it only spawns scorched as attackers, and there's a camp remnant that has twice spawned a Gatling laser inside of a duffle bag.
---
The only thing I want is that vending machine.
---
Ahhhh gotcha I’ll got there see if I get it if not I’ll just save my caps till I have enough
---
Sorry didn’t read your post. 
---
It costs 1500 caps maybe? 
---
This is what I do, I go to harpers ferry then kill all the scorched and/or mutants and sell all their guns. 
---
Just pray it’s not ghouls. Each day the vendors have 1400 caps. 
---
Getting the caps will save you the headache of finding lever plans.
---
Dont bother with this quest, you get 20 caps and the quest will respawn within a day.
---
Also you dont have to kill the one where the marker points you on your map, you can just kill a random one.
---
I have hidden missile turrets and a MIRV launcher for emergencies.
---
I wish u could’ve seen the reaction from some griefers who tried too have a go at my base.

Could of sworn this grown man lvl 100 was a little girl when he screamed at my 3 hidden missile turrets after they where revealed from behind a wall.

I’ve removed the turrets since then though...

This was a throwback to the movie titled "Ravenous" check it out well worth the watch

Nice, man. I gave some 2* legendary armor to a level 47 yesterday, best he had was low level combat. I remember someone doing the same for me.

No problem and do you have the barter perk because atm I don’t have the perk and everything I sell is either 1-20caps

Always happens for me. I spend twice as Kent bullets to down something because their health shoots back up.

Build out of the way areas. Places where there are no spawning mobs, paths, roads, houses or other structures. That way your camp isn't so easily located by the griefers.
---
Good areas are all the edge areas of Great Divide, east, south, west and north.
---
Good views, plentiful of water sources, center location and very few spawns of wandering mobs.
---
I’ve just got my 4th UK time
---
What are the usual spawn points may I ask ?

Wait until the next update. Or find a low bridge or tunnel and use concrete foundations for your walls. Works for me.

If you do test the dying theory, I'd love to hear the results, and also whether others nearby get the same number of drops as you.

Why deleted?

TIL that the aura around a player with Chameleon armor is called a warble.
---
Happened to me for the first time just last night.  Started about 2 minutes after I loaded into the world and corrected itself like five minutes later. I was actually a bit sad when things went back to normal, because I wanted to fight the gulpers by Dyer Chem on that trippy landscape.  I guess I would be less than happy if I were forced to quit the game to make it go away though.
---
A lot more legendary drops should be like this.
---
And I mean ALOT more legendary drops! I’m sick of my zealots pipe-rifle drops... and chameleon wooden left leg drops.
---
I wouldn't worry about armor until past 50. I'm levelling some new chars and made a full set of level 20 BOS and I've not bothered replacing most of it, currently levrl 46.

Checked and checked again, no mods whatsoever, unless you count ‘bloodied’ or ‘weightless’ effect as a mod. I actually have a bunch of ‘90% weight reduction’ Legendaries that still weigh a lot, maybe i should put them together and get their attention. 
---
I had always thought it’s some incompetent programmers calculated ‘90% weight reduction’ as ‘90% of original weight’ thus the items are lighter but not much.
---
Was just thinking the same thing.
---
So much food goes bad because I don't know I have it and I stick to the names I know and find easy.
---
A separate tab or way to view just food and drink would save so much time and effort
---
This must be about tenth post of this I have seen this day alone.
---
Oh sorry I have just seen this now. Yes u can have one, definitely 😃
---
Tell them to shut up. I use a GG all the time and she lands.
---
Yes I have the perk. But it’s not much of a difference. 
---
Are you under lv 50? Scorched and mutants over 48 start dropping good guns such as Charged Laser Rifle, Assault Rifles, combat shotguns. 
---
Those sell for 30+
---
Hmm...not sure if I want this or not. But, thanks for letting me know!
---
they have acknowledged it they apologized said they working on it but there's nothing they can do as they can't replace individual items.
---
Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and Grafton Steel Yard from my understanding. So far I've server hopped numerous times for several days and nothing. Must be my luck.
---
Another issue i have is burrows was the wrong choice. I know it's a game, but it's inspired by WV. Harpers ferry has the location of the bunker for the secretary of interior. Exploring that would have been way more interesting than 2 random holotapes that lead to nothing.
---
If you engage from too far away, it seems to run more often- if you engage from close, like directly under it, it seems to hang in the same area. I just took one down last night where I knocked down it’s two escorts with a shot each from a tracking two-shot missile launcher (bloody HW/explosives build, yeah, I oneshot the escorts with a missile launcher, it’s super satisfying!) and I’d engaged from near-max range. I got one more shot off at the nuke drone but it was at extreme range, I just winged it. One jet was smoking, I had to chase it for a couple miles but I was able to catch up and take it down.
---
That's a new one. No, fire away. You kind of have to chip away at her health at every opportunity especially if only a handful of people show up to fight or else that event is going to go uncompleted.
---
OPEN WORLD GAMES DONT HAVE INSTANCING, JUST SAY NO TO INSTANCING
---
nobody said they had to do damage.
---
just creating explosions while dropping like a bomb
---
There’s also quite a few construction materials on the upper floors of the big office building right next to the workshop there. Good amount of concrete and paint cans (for lead/steel for ammo). The “secret” top floor has a ton of screws and similar stuff.
---
Dude hooked me up with a bunch of serums a couple weeks ago and made the game so much more fun to play. Absolutely trustworthy and super helpful!
---
Cool keep blasting away then :)
---
But sometimes the overwhelming staline of better armour trumps legendary effects
---
They are a game changer for sure! Glad you’re enjoying them!
---
I’m not that lucky lol, those aren’t Legendaries
---
Oh thank you so much, I wasn't know that. I will check this building! :)
---
I have a bloodied spear with the exact same 3 bonuses.
---
I don't use bloodied or melee builds so I have no idea how good it is or isn't. 
---
 It's in my stash waiting to be traded for tokens when the legendary vendor finally comes around.
---
They’ve done well with the matchmaking into populated servers (this is something we’ve taken for granted but could have gone horribly wrong!) sour always feels like a decent number of players.
---
There are some scenarios where people have stopped seeing new players join their server and it has become empty but that could be by design for all we know.
---
You are the bully here. The people bombing it up are the ones that are decent.
---
i known we can't do those ones yet i meant more towards the take a photo of a player in front of vault 76 style challenges
---
Post I made about sheepsquatch with my basic specs, away for the rest of Easter so I still need to post my perks.

---
I’m lvl 29 but yeah I’ll head out over there and start farming a while thx for your help
---
Hi, thanks for responding! I won't be online until later today (east coast U.S.) but if you're around that would be cool! By the way, where do you pick up these plans? I never seem to find outift plans other than the ones on the random spawns (civil war reenactor, halloween trick or treater)
---
Thats a god roll, I highly suggest using it, or selling it to another player.
---
But you can just stay and not moving while diving and not taking rads??
---
You sure? I swear I saw videos showing people in nuka cola quantum armor and they’re AP regents fast.
---
I did stop
---
I did read 
---
I saw both for &amp; against
---
I did also see people talking about nuking it
---
I don’t think even 1% of a million have posted about their displeasure of the burrows.
---
I didn’t like it :)
---
Whats your psn? Mine is alliekat85 but I have blocks on for my daughter.
---
XD Yep basically
---
We are but mere providers of Lämp
---
What made them think it was okay and would even be taken well?
---
Feel for you, but when attending any large public event you should stash your junk.
---
Agreed. I was hope for more of anInstanced experience.
---
I don't particularly care for melee nor low health builds unfortunately. 
---
 Looking through my stash I also have a bloodied knuckles with the same bonuses except 50% limb damage instead of swing speed.
---
 They're of no use to me so I was just going to trade them for tokens whenever this vendor decides to show up.
---
Its a duty to blow camps in certain places. People doing that, keep up the good work.
---
I believe it'll be available in early May, so Patch 9 I believe, said it In the Inside The vault.
---
You might have owned a Workshop, which opens you up to PvP anywhere on the map.  I've seen other players do that before.  They quietly contest the Workshop while the other player fights the SBQ, then they show up to the area she's dead and kill other players at the last minute to take their flux and other valuable goods.
---
Blame the person at Bethesda who thought this was a good design.
---
I’ve built each egg each day as I’ve unlocked it and each day the previous egg has disappeared so I assumed that was meant to happen like that?
---
Its the people nicknamed gofukyurslf for which the OP aint behaving like douche
---
Yeah, I know... was just the joy of getting to watch my nuke land... didn't stop off my CAMP...
---
Hi there, I'm interested in running a similar build. Could you share your perk loadout please?
---
No workshop. Had been after the nuke launch only this evening.
---
I found them while farming for the civil war reenactor north on the map, I ended up with 9 plans in the end
---
Haha... Tganks!!
---
You could just not camp?
---
Psn is biffpipp. I have a friend who is very high level and will likely give you good shit.
---
Sell them to another player, those types of weapons can lend you tons of caps, or some sweet trades.
---
..does this have anything to do with how I lose socks in the dryer? ...investigating..
---
Happy to. I’ll post when I’m home later.
---
I can’t add a photo of the map location 😔
---
"Accidentally" pulled 20, lvl 60 ghouls to someone's camp that was on the golf course. Then scorch beast showed up. Was a very nice camp...was....
---
Gottem
---
Sadly not surprising
---
I had an odd situation where my x01 de equipped from the frame and into inventory ... but duplicated in the inventory.  2 of each.
---
I'm a compulsive stasher. If I know I'm gonna get involved in pvp or a major event, I put everything away.  The only thing I lose is caps (which are now easily replaceable.)  I would never dare to carry 700 lead, very well *pure flux* on my character.  I've mastered stashing at this point and I'm about 10 or 20 away from max capacity.
---
Damn, if only you were on ps4. I have so much excess material and I'm kinda trying what you are just on a much smaller scale
---
I have no idea tbh, I've rarely ever had visitors to my place since launch(My CAMP has always been in the same static place), only people who lived near was a person down the cliff face at a Iron deposit. But I'm suspecting that the high level without the bounty just told the two with a high bounty that hey, there's a CAMP probably over there, cause all three moved around the map  to random locations and then moved towards other people.
---
But heh, lucky you!
---
Variety of opinions here but I’ve been playing since launch and still enjoy it.  Bugs, oh yea, but much better than a few months ago.
---
Couldn't stash the lead...have 1500 in stash and was trying to use the 700 up with any steel I could scrap  :)
---
Only true divinity can creat this masterpiece
---
The inventory management is a challenge for sure. Best of luck!
---
I've done that minus the SB. I jumped up and fixed my armor, healed, waited a while for them to destroy everything, and then killed them all.
---
If you bulk lead and aluminum, it halves the weight. Can't say the same for anything else though
---
Short answer? Yes.
---
Not if you compare the first to the last. For me at least
---
What about the little deathclaw from fallout new vegas old world blues dlc?
---
Would love to have a little bastard like that...
---
Until it tries to eat me.
---
Nice lol. I was level 9 at the time. Needless to say i was a nice wastelander...was...
---
My daughter launched her first nuke last week. She was so excited! I was excited for her as well. But, all she got from it was a griefed for an entire week. I helped her move her camp and told her she would have to crouch for a while... I don't know exactly why some people do this. But it didn't run her off! She's still playing right by my side. :)
---
There was an old belief that weapons which stagger the Queen in mid-air prevent her from landing when, really, sometimes her AI just has problems finding a spot to land.
---
That said, I do think there are ways you can game the SBQ's AI, and the whole "flying away and never coming back" behavior is probably related to some kind of perfectly timed interrupt.  But, if it happens, it happens.  That's clearly Bethesda's problem.
---
And do what exactly? There’s so little end game to this game that besides farming the Queen or running Whitesprings/West-Tek there’s very little else to do with consistent returns for time invested.
---
Am I just a lucky mf? I haven't experienced one thing people complain about here lmao
---
That’s a lot like my sledgehammer only mine is instigating so I do double damage when they are full health. I one shot lvl 68 ghouls pretty often
---
I've somehow shot people during fights, even in pacifist mode, and they kill me afterwards.
---
I got a Furious swing speed +1strength Fire Axe that I was going to try to use on my melee build... But I found melee to be too boring
---
Yes it is true
---
I didn't know this was a thing- I just lost a sweet legendary left arm marine armor and I thought i was just drunk or something. I'm pissed!
---
An epic tale. RIP warrior.
---
I’ll buy it from you. Buy yourself something more exciting.
---
My guns are missing too, not just parts of PA. I wrote ticket. Only thing to do..
---
I love the location where I live, I have a great view over the Ash Heap and then I can see the gorge bridge off in the distant and a couple towns. Since I live near a Workshop and a couple locations plus a Train station, so I have a good resources open to me, but one thing I hate is that in the Savage divide, there are no fallen trees to collect wood XD. Unless the RNG gods are kind and give me a wooden spoon, I always have to fast travel to 76 just to get wood and plants for cooking/brewing!
---
I'm scared to get back on. I accidently scrapped one of my pa body armor chest. I don't wanna lose my plasma cannon. I bet they never patched the Food event where you can lose items from putting in shit too fast.
---
I appreciate the offer, I’m on PC
---
I can't upvote this enough
---
My base is often damaged heavily by random attacks from super mutants, mutts, scorched etc. They also attack my farm first, destroy all the crops and then somehow wipe out all of my turrets. The turrets we can build are so insanely weak it isn’t funny. They don’t help against AI and they certainly don’t help to defend against players.
---
That was in the BETA. I miss it.
---
Please explain the best way to proceed then?
---
I used to love joining workshop defense just to cripple enemies, and watch the lower levels rush in and finish them. Then I would drop my unwanted plans for them as well.
---
I appreciate the offer, but I’m on PC
---
This would be game-changing
---
What's your username? I'm down. I'm a lvl 71 heavy gunner build

Oh yeah. I hadn't done much in PA in 76 since I've avoided Power Armor entirely in NV and 4, but, i wanted to head into some nuked zones now that I'm strong enough and it sucks to not be able to use my powerfist or knuckles or moleminer gauntlet.
---
I'll play with just about anyone on ps4 if anyone is interested, my group fell apart and I just lost a stealth sniper, so all are welcome
---
I've only turned in 13 or 15 pieces and I have 3 different paint sets so far.  Maybe they increase the drop rate since your post or maybe the RNG gods have been on my side.
---
I saw it last week in game in the "unbuildable" section after I had clicked show buildable on/off accidentally a few times. I wonder if it's just a remnant or if it'll make a glorious return one day.
---
Thanks. Didn't think of that. Just bulked a ton. :)
---
no, no it isnt, i run heavy on my main char and the ONLY weapon i can get her to stick in the air with is if i somehow manage to cryo her while flying.  i run GG, .50, and lmg on sbq, between the 50 and lmg it should stunlock her off the fire rate+ onegun if it was true.
---
I never got loot from a scorchbeast. Like for fuck sake. I killed a queen and didn't get shit thanks to the forever Loading loot glitch.
---
Challenges shouldn’t be left up to minuscule random chances. Sure they can be hard but some are downright impossible due to minuscule chances like a rad storm happening.
---
When doing a sbq fight always turn on pasifist  just in case you shoot someone and they decide to be a dick I found out the hard way and lost my junk as well
---
My first week one rad storm. Then never saw one again after that.
---
Oh hell I wouldn't mind doors only thing to be vulnerable to being smashed down, that is reasonable if someone just cowers behind a 0 level locked door (Also think you can shoot through the grates of a door such as the metal doors and the windows (won't work for the wooden ones, but metal, brick do) for sure, I have sniped people through windows with a Dragon XD).
---
And heh life hack, live in the part of the map that is completely deserted of life except a Random Encounter on a cliff, and you're set!
---
(Except when mole rats attack your crops, those little buggers can just go take a hike)
---
Pistols isn't good at all. Even with good legendaries. I started a new character because my Guerrilla build with a TSE 10MM is shit.
---
Yes
---
I don't do this anymore. Whitesprings has been nerfed. I only turret tower in a nuke event. So that fellow players get up and get kills, loot, and xp. I turned my turret tower into a simple place. Like I got threatened to take my shit down before I would get bombarded by a TSE minigun. 
---
Don't do this if you wanna be a big asshole.
---
You know what so have I. I remember my first shiny, it was a shiny graveler. I was damn proud of getting that chicken nugget.
---
the only time i have ever got her to "freeze" in mid air while running heavy is when i cryoed her on a low flight near the BoS raised platform
---
you are set to fire away
---
I’d rather mail out the crap I’ve been hoarding for my brother, I want my stash space.
---
Is this mod considered a cheat?
---
Oh that’s what that means there’s one at a place I go to that has a bunch of mines
---
Yes.  More stair options in general would be amazing.
---
😂😂😂 it’s from Star Trek dude, Symbol from the Klingons, just an Easter egg 😉
---
Wym “they’ll go down?”
---
Two words: STAIR CAR
---
Edit: taking cap offers
---
You are gonna be rich in caps. Might wanna go on a shopping spree. Or pull a pablo escobar and drop a bag of 2.5k caps out near Vault 76
---
Just remember to relocate your camp (instead of fixing it) and it'll auto repair when it goes into storage and is redropped. 
---
Bascially it was 1000 caps at a 40cap (for the camp relocation) fee.

its not new on X1, ive had people screeching that false info at me for a solid month already, most have never touched a heavy build

Ok so an unproven opinion on reddit is your source?  Come back when Bethesda confirms. People will say anything on here

(Careful you're autism is showing)[https://i.redd.it/a0bbifdwibt21.jpg]

Absolutely!
---
Yes there is im pretty sure the SBQ drops it.
---
It has already been acknowledged and it's under investigation apparently. 
---
So, this thread is asking for what has already been given.
---
This game might disappoint sometimes, but the community delivers.
---
A week?
---
That's not a griefer........that is a stalker!
---
Report that player.
---
As I’m go down in price, probably. I managed to get the XO-1 jet pack in the white springs bunker a month or so back and just got the quantum paint scheme last night. It’s pretty great. Worth the grind.
---
Or.. It happened to me and I researched it. I'm not an idiot. I also don't wasn't my time starting fake rumors. I'm not ten.
---
There is plenty of history on the subreddit if you'd only search, or check the reply someone left you. Not to mention the Unofficial Bug List made after the recent patch.
---
Did SBQ on my bloodied DCG yesterday. Kept ressing in the blast zone lol. Finally managed to get at the queen and give her a good beating with about 1 hp to spare. A fucking dog got me and someone snatched the flux I'd just received lol. I might start trying some of these  kamikaze ideas.
---
Good reason to have a bot, keywords need a bit of work though. Context means everything
---
Does it make your so regen last longer or regens your AP faster?
---
RIP brave Hobo! You will be missed 😭

I haven’t really noticed. You mean with the quantum paint equipped?
---
Just new to me. 🙂 Yup, always fun having folk telling you how your fighting style works.
---
Hahahaha, you should’ve seen my login screen the other day.. almost gave me a seizure for God’s sake
---
Well it used to.
---
here is my reasoning since i run weightless boiled heavy leather w/ deep pockets.
---
pretty much to offset my rifles stupid carry weight and keep the Hleathers defences
---
did you even do rose's quests.  
---
thats the symbol of one of the 3 raider gangs
---
same here lost 3 pieces of pa and  didn’t scrap them by accident  because i have paint it with atom paint
---
This would be for infront of Garage doors
---
I traded my Unyielding set for my Troubleshooters set after the last update and I'll be honest......other than carry weight I don't notice any difference. I still sneak right past enemies and my VATS accuracy is the same.

I found if you enter the work bench to build, then switch to mod/repair i will work most of the time in wild every time in camp.
---
Nuka-Cran. I'm just saying, marketing-wise I feel like they let a much better name slip through the cracks. Hope I see it in-game now cuz that would be cool. Maybe a miniquest to hunt down the individual who was bringing the recipe into Appalachia, or to find a semi truck trailer that was shipping the nuka-cran to watoga and got highjacked.
---
I mean I'd like it just in general so I can stop falling down next to my stairs
---
Killed a SBQ on my bloodied melee yesterday and was down to my last hp. Just after the quest rewarded a sneaky bloody dog hit me. Dead. New what to expect next, another player grabbed my flux. Not the same as your situation but just goes to show some people are opportunistic jerks.
---
as a day 1 heavy gunner i can promise you it never has, sbq had AI issues once before that everyone blames on heavy guns (and later all guns), if you recall there was also "lul if ANYONE AT ALL shoots her she wont land" after the heavy accusations.
---
the only thing that caused an airborn stagger/freeze has been a lucky cryo hit
---
It's not a bug it's a "feature" To say Bethesda has alot of work to do to earn back my trust is an understatement. To be fair this same thing happened in F4 but nowhere near as bad as 76 and you could use console to get to corpses that are clipped behind terrain.
---
after it happened on xbox and was disproved they blamed anyone shooting at her while airborne.  they just need anyone to blame i guess
---
Spaghetti code
---
Indeed; I understand that Bethesda probably wants to prevent people from building unreachable turrets floating on midair platforms, but the whole restrictions on how buildings snap together seriously restricts creativity (as has been said many times). I’m going back to FO4 with mods to actually be able to build some decent settlements again.
---
I make full sets of Heavy Studded Deep Pocketed Leather Armor for any sub-10s I see. I'll also trick out any low level legendaries I have and pass them out.
---
I can confirm this is true... Got disconnected and when I logged back in my power armor chasis only contained fusion core, whole set gone. This is just a joke.
---
Identical thing happened to me a few weeks ago.  Weirdly, I because invincible at the same time.  Couldn't die in pvp, nuke zones, insta-kill zones, etc. Server hopping, logging out, rebooting my xbox - nada.  I reported thr glitch to Bethesda and the problem just disappeared overnight.
---
I run a full set of 3* powered, along with all the ap Regen perks. I have over 250+ AP and with my setup it fully regenerates from 0 to full in about 3 seconds. Allows me to do 100% of my combat in vats without needing any cooldown. Combine this with grim Reaper a sprint and it feels like your cheating haha. Highly recommend.
---
Usually what that means for me is that I’ve got the game running twice. Open the program manager (control alt delete), and close one.
---
What is the secondary on the 2* left leg, and how much are you asking for it?
---
That was two months ago, and it's only gotten worse with the recent server instability. Not to mention rollback issues with people losing all progress once a server crashes due to no checkpoints being made the entire time.
---
We need to know what is going on. Because it's only getting worse.
---
Yeah me too. You're invulnerable for a few seconds so I managed to run out of the radiation once.
---
Awesome!!!   Hopped on and grabbed a few serums.  I'll stop by every now and then for whatever I need and to donate materials.
---
People should be reporting to them any details they can, because it is highly likely this will continue for a long time if people do not feed them enough information to run this down.
---
From that Thread, from u/Valseek :
---
Hi everyone,
---
Thank you for the detailed round-up of posts on this topic. We’re aware of the reports players have been sharing about this and we’re actively looking into it. This is a complex issue that’s going to take time and deep investigation to get to the root of what may be going on here. Additionally, if you are able to share some account details so that we can investigate specific cases, please send me a PM with the following info:
---
    Your Bethesda.net account name
---
    The email address associated with your Bethesda.net account
---
    Character name that lost an item
---
    Date and approximate time the item was lost
---
    What item was lost, and what were you doing when it happened?
---
    I know it’s frustrating to lose items, but please keep sharing your reports about this issue with us as we work to address it. Thank you very much!
---
Cst
---
Cool!
---
+25 energy resistance. Hm idk maybe 1000?
---
Are the heavy laser turrets worth the cost? I've always used missile turrets.
---
My base is about to get an overhaul. I am built on the river by the Nuka Cola plant. It's very out of the way, and about to extend it out further with the update to the Camp building needing only 1 base attached to the ground.
---
I think the weight of armour affects your general stealth ability, too.
---
im pretty sure the locked rooms are going to be unlocked when the "race for the presidency" event is released, where you have to run around the map collecting ballots for yourself, hence how you can activate ballot boxes and stuff. the goal of the event is to rig yourself to be the president of the enclave, and then you get access to that locked room in the bunker overlooking comms room, where modus says its not ready yet.
---
Fertilizer as well.
---
How weird, I know for a fact that I have all the eggs sitting in my CAMP, but damn now I need to check if I still have the plan for the Blob ones. Because I know things such as the first free pose from the Atomic Shop no longer appears in the photo mode, so maybe Atomic shop items disappear? That ain't good if Bethesda wants to make money that way XD
---
Anything from even back to fallout 3 could be in the game...hell even Skyrim...Bethesda has been using Gambrio for almost 20 years 😒 just slapped a new name on it [Creation Engine] and kept pumping out games, waiting for the community modders to fix their games for them
---
BUT THATS JUST NONE OF MY BUSINESS!
---
Turn on pacifist mode. I accidentally killed a guy who accidentally shot me. I have explosive guns to it was unintentional. I stood on his bag until he got back to take his junk back, seemed thankful. At least you got your lead. Flux is a pain in the dick to farm so I’m not surprised he kept it.
---
Good luck buying one now as well. A lot of them are gone now and anyone who has one is likely never gonna give it away
---
If the plan was for t60 armor then it can only be used on t60 armor... all power armors have their own jetpacks and you cant read one plan and learn it for all.
---
It's way better than the shell it used to be that's for sure :)
---
I like them a whole bunch. It try to have an even spread of missiles and heavy lasers. Just consider some creatures are much weaken to energy. So it kind of depends where your camp is.
---
I just like have a pretty blanket defence against whatever comes knocking.
---
Stop on by anytime!!
---
I am saving mine sorry. Hoping to get a great m79 soon..
---
Wont you come inside... and a have Nuka-Cranberry!
---
Lol
---
Gotta feel sorry for these people.  Not only are mods broken for them, but apparently the Reddit search function is broken for them too.  Thoughts and prayers.
---
Awesome thanks. I forgot how positive this community is lol. See you in the wasteland
---
Yeah most likely, but who knows eh, either way i see locked rooms and i want whatevers behind those doors
---
Get the scrapper perk and equip it when scrapping weapons. You get 20 per assault rifle and missile launcher, 10 bet double barrel, 14 per combat/pump shotgun and 25 per minigun with 8 intelligence and scrapper. Farm Blackwater mine for all those weapons except mini guns on the mole miners.

yeah same tho, maybe they're just there for effect in the whitespring? or maybe they have something to do with the upcoming update like i talked about, maybe collecting an endorsement like in the quest files  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

shut up
---
All we know is that it is token based. So I'm assuming the more stars the weapon has, the more tokens? No one knows yet so I think it's best you hold onto them. :)
---
I'm having this same issue with my excavator armor.
---
This happened to me with my prize TSE combat shotty.
---
Pouring one out for the homies
---
Yes. But it has to be fully equipped on every part the quantum.
---
Whenever you think you can reasonably survive while pulling your weight in damage. Every player doing the event adds health to the queen, so make sure you can hurt it.
---
Upvote to upvote heaven
---
I can't understand how they managed NOT to implement that already.
---
Ok so next question would be, how do I get the plans for the t60 armor or t47 armor. I believe it said t47 but like a dummy I didn't write it down. I'm assuming it's a mission like the mining one that allowed me to get the escavator armor?
---
Hmmm, that's actually really cool thought. I had an idea as well, why not have a quest simillar to  what Sierra  Petrovita  gives you. So instead of the "The Nuka-Cola Challenge" why not have "The Nuka-Cranberry Pie Challenge" Sounds delcious doesn't it.. And we could even get the recipe, and one up Sierra. :P
---
I cant see them having locked rooms just for effect, its gotta either have a plan ready for them, had a plan that needs more work or are being saved for a future plan to happen
---
The legendary vendor isn't coming until the end if May (if it doesn't get delayed), so I'd probably just sell a lot of them off. Hold on to some light ones like pipe pistols and whatnot, but it's going to he a long month if your stash is full.
---
There ya go I like that too
---
Ticks explode if they manage to bite you and get blood engorged before you kill them. If you don't kill them quickly, no tick blood for you.
---
Vendors sell those plans. The X01 us the only power armor where the plans aren't sold and to my knowledge are not available, unless it got recently added. Also the ultracite plans are drops from queen.
---
This I want this fixed please
---
It works well with the chameleon mutation but you have to run all 5 pieces for it to work.
---
All my stairs are attached to the edge on one and middle of the other.
---
Whichever end you attach to the side, the other has to be in the middle.
---
That's just how it is.
---
yeah, that’s definitely a more doable option, and i would love to see towns like NewGad, harpers ferry and point pleasant repopulated.
---
I too have this issue on the PC. Seemed to start around the release of the last patch but it could have been earlier.
---
I pay for the best internet my games install at 200 to 300 mgb a second I practically never I have issues with disconnecting from games and when it does happen it’s with this game
---
That looks cool, but so flimsy
---
It seems like pistols heavily depend on VATS criticals plus sneak to be viable. Shotguns I'm not too sure on but I'm looking to use the 2xo weekend to level up a shotguns/heavy weapons character.
---

---
There was *in beta*. But they were taken out, supposedly due to a glitch where folks could place them to get into restricted areas.
---
Now there are welcome mats, but they're just decorative.
---
Sell them all
---
Fissure site I'm down
---
that's actually pretty awesome
---
That’s a great idea! There was something called a quantum deathclaw found in the files but never released. This could be the perfect place for it! And they could recycle nuka world enemies! This is a great idea
---
Sugar grove is a great place to go if you need screws.
---
Thanks! I find it easier with a mic cuz I'm awkward with the emote wheel too (can't win lol) but I always try!
---
That’s what I have. I have noticed that my AP regeneration pulses now. It’s not a continuous rise. I’m not sure if that’s new.
---
Imagine siding with communism.
---
That's why you'll lose in 2020 again.
---
You're probably not wrong, but it is still a bug. I have the perk that let's me eat and drink without receiving rads, but I'll still get them from collecting water
---
Probably a remnant, it has an issue where you dropped through the floor and would get stuck in your foundation when traveling, or I suppose killed if you built high enough.
---
The solution of course would be to make them kind of similar to foundations in that they absolutely must touch solid ground to be placed.
---
Im on the x to,have huge lag and stutter lately,u have it to?or maybe my internet connection...
---
10MM is pretty disappointing, especially compared to FO4. I tried using one for low level junk runs in my 30s and 40s but even at max level for me they were weak.
---
I’ve been using revolvers, more power but the 6 shot reload isn’t great when it starts taking 3+ shots to drop higher level enemies.
---
You could get Powered Sentinel Assassin heavy BoS, but that’s a mega god roll set and duper’s never got a hold of that either to my knowledge (XB1). For sniping with vats and bloodied I would still recommend sent assassin armor. As long as you don’t move no normal weapons can hurt you and only AAE weapons can kill you. I tried sniper PvP and I hated it with AAE Sniper, TSE sniper and  an Quad Explosive sniper. I felt like I couldn’t do the damage fast enough with any of them. Then I would get mopped up with an Fully automatic AAE handmade every time even with full health sent assassin bos armor with a DR/ER of over 500 each. So I switched to that AAE handmade, now I mop up everything especially bloodied builds they stand no chance now. I’m not trying to brag about PvP but I’m just telling you my personal experience from a few weeks ago when I tried playing as a stealth vats sniper build. My Hunting rifle was doing 250 dam per round and it just felt like nothing was happening. Now my AAE handmade powerful automatic receiver does 150 dam per round and spits out 8-10 rounds a sec
---
\^This\^
---
Just wait till you are 50 or above. This is an end game thing. "Whenever you feel you can survive" is not how this works on the queen. Being around when under level actually makes it harder for everyone else to kill her because her DR scales way up. So do all the high levels a favor and wait so our time and resources isn't wasted.
---
I joined that event at around 58 and it was pretty good so if you’re talking minimum level them probubly like 50+. the real thing  that gets you is those large spikes of damage you take when the queen hits you or when a bunch of smaller enemies are attacking you.
---
Team chat is antisocially social 😂😂 but sometimes the only thing that works for some reason.
---
&gt;It would be nice.  I'm thinking that they would have to allow for the half-sized security fence to be placed tot he left or right of the stairs because that would be the next request.
---
Use the angled walls, the little triangular ones. I put them on either side of the floor, which provides you something to keep from falling down the stairwell. The barn ones look pretty nice. Can also put a half wall connecting the two, or a full wall if you want to divide the upstairs.
---
Thanks I'm ShoshanaZZZ
---
Yeah and then you have to spend possibly hours replacing everything since blueprints never seem to work 😢
---
Hmm we're always in a party chat. Some of us don't play the same game. It's just nice and chill.
---
Right answer 😜😉
---
And I'd kill it. So?
---
Got BoS combat armor legs from Toxic Valley treasure map, might be worth a look.
---
As it stands, yes, but that's because Wood has no mods, which is what I was proposing a fix for.  Also, ultralight and sleek are both utility mods: gotta pick one or the other.
---
Typewriters, telephones, clipboards, desk fans
---
That's really cool! I don't understand why some people aren't but 🤷‍♀️
---
And that is why I constantly fast travel to my camp or train stations to deposit my junk ASAP hahahaha
---
Absolutely.  Going for queen again. Got a decent amount of gear and plans from her last night. And I had around 5 or so 3* legendary enemies around her as well.
---
But if they did that, would it still auto scrap it when you were out of mats? Or would you then have to go manually scrap the bulked items you need?
---
Let me know what time buddy I'm eastern time
---
Well written glad you didn’t use 12 paragraphs to tell your story!
---
But I want to talk to everybody whenever I want with out going into my settings
---
Yeah I keep workshops for during the weekdays so I don't have that problem. One of the few perks of a retail job.
---
Not too sure. Bb and ah can be manually scrapped but they are passed over by the scrap all.
---
Just send me a request. After I get off work and spend a little time with my wife I’ll be on
---
I lost a piece of armor (left arm I believe, it’s been a month or so) to this bug and by the time I noticed it was far too late to record anything. So happy that I have yet to invest in or find one of the really rare armor pieces because I would have been sooooo upset.
---
It was removed during beta, supposedly because people were abusing it to spawn into restricted areas. It may never come back unless Bethesda can include a "no fast travel" flag for those zones.
---
k
---
This is the one I’m running. It’s not the best but works.

Hmm.   I “lost” a few hundred 5.56 last night.  Just wasn’t there after fast traveling back to my camp.   Wasn’t appearing in my C.A.M.P. either.  
---
Now I’m going to check stash, pull any ammo in there, and see if it reappears.
---
No mods.  Ini default.
---
Yep. I use a - at the beginning to highlight stuff I switch to often (like power armors)
---
It’s been always like that. Overencumbered – spawn at vault or camp.
---
Aren’t there a couple level 3 safes there?  You can find plans in those... is that what you are referring to?
---
Do you have a non-Facebook link...?
---
Forcing people to PvP for Atom is not a good idea. Not everyone wants to PvP especially with it as unbalanced as it is.
---
What are you on  about? Do you  think Democrats are communists? lmao
---
reformist politics are a sham as it is
---
Some 100+ dropped me a ton of plans and other items at my base in the Bog last night; he gave me a the plans to a full set of Marine Armor... This morning I helped some sub 10s at Mama Dolce's event and then gave the rest of the plans I already knew. Feels good to do it.
---
Maybe.  I saw those but I got the impression they were on a shelf like they are in other places.
---
Idk. I’m just asking because I want to be able to people those people who are able to reach impossible spots. And most of them use quantum X-01. If you can, can you please do research to see if there’s any difference between any other jet pack power armor and then the quantum jet pack.
---
I'm brand new and I enjoy it as much as any other fallout sure some issues are happining but hey its fun.
---
So if I'm trying to buy the plans from vender for power armor would it say plan:t60 power armor?
---
Right? I never have glitches or problems. Maybe people just push the game to far and I haven’t yet? Not sure but I love the game, no problems here lol
---
Sure. I’ll be on later and I’ll do some timed trials and get back to you.
---
Would be a great place to dump the “Nuka cranberry” supply/recipe.
---
I will never...NEVER...touch this game again without Marsupil. It is a complete different feeling. Way better. It’s even better when you also have Speed Demon. The five points for Class Freak and Starged Genes are nothing compared to the benefits you get from mutations. I have 11 active.
---
v flimsy
---
I would have to ask first, why did you quit in the first place?
---
Why build them when you can have Kinggath build them for you!?!
---
I’m definitely a VATS player but not really sneak... but I can see that. Seems like there should be more than 1 path though. Other than fully ranking every damage perk, which is a big investment.
---
I'm still waiting on that pinball machine, but I'd also like those arcade machines they had in Creation Club.
---
Hell, just give us a casino.
---
That's pretty much always the rub with making anything like mechs or power armor a reality, there is no technology that currently exists that can power something that has the kind of weight it would have for more than a few minutes and all the motors to move stuff like that smoothly are huge.
---
We're all in the same boat and shit out of luck.
---
Some of the stash boxes such as the footlocker, metal box, etc., look really good on the lowest shelf. Smaller toolboxes will fit on top shelf.
---
Need her to drop me a crazy weapon
---
I was on the pixaxe one the other day, picked up the beer lying around somewhere, and handed it to biv.  The quest completed without me crafting it, lol.
---
Oh... So this is gamewide?
---
Thats why we need super strong super lightweight carbon nano tube armour
---
I dont know that Ive lost gear, but I have logged back in to find that some legendary weapons effects changed. Vampire War Drum, when I picked it up the legendary effect was that it drained health of the target. The next day the legendary effect was 40% faster swing speed instead. Also have a ghoul slayers 10mm auto pistol that now gives increase damage resistance while aiming instead of increased damage to ghouls. I might not plan on using either of these but it is frustrating as hell.
---
You can just farm certain spots for power armor chassis that have 1-3 pieces of t-60 armor on them. Farm those spots a few times to get the whole suit. No need to craft the parts
---
It's from uranium fever
---
Yeah. Bethesda introduced the bug with the last patch and have apparently never heard of a hot fix. So we're all waiting for the next patch.
---
A casino would be an amazing spot for hang outs. I'd be there all the time.
---
Yeah true. I was more just seeing who remembered seeing it in the you will rebuild trailers
---
AP refresh
---
I wouldn’t, yes they improved it and for a while they had no controversy and were giving players hope.
---
All that changed now with the announcement of repair kits which will allow you to repair your items on the go and can only be purchased in the atomic shop.
---
While this may seem insignificant this is a bad sign for a few reasons.
---
1. Bethesda broke their cosmetics only promise.
---
2. Repair kits still offer an advantage. 
---
3. Bethesda has been slowly implementing items in the shop that give a slight advantage to get us used to it so they can drop the heavy pay to win bombs *cough* Lunchboxes *cough*
---
Overall yes the game is okay as of right now, better than it was but still not great. However, Bethesda is going to ruin it with pay to win so keep that in mind.
---
Does it affect all in game mods or just power armor? I usually just use legendary weapon drops rather than crafting my own.
---
Bars have been datamined, they are coming soon
---
Yeah dont know why the f*ck you would were a giant ugly mask,dont get it either
---
There's too many sick weapons..the hunt continues
---
All weapon, armour and power armour mods from those mod boxes.
---
All that data is still being saved on their database and you have to be connected to it, and that's the focus here, they need to not have that data on your character's data itself while you in the rest of the game, the creation engine wasn't really designed for that (I have broken things in 4 by having too many massive settlement) so if they keep that separate everything is fine. (frankly they could also get away with having it on the character data, but that would become a problem as they do more houses.)
---
You. You fucking idiot. 
---
You're a self proclaimed commie scum if I were you I'd stick my head in a septic tank.
---
I know you said you don't care, so this doesn't really matter and nothing I say will change your mind, however, for anyone else reading this, here's the math, and here's why I still disagree:
---
Prime barrels bring the two weapons far closer in dps, to the point where having the plasma do split dps would definitely matter.
---
And if we're talking ER/DR, then what really matters is the queen, because the gatling plasma is honestly not all that great for much else - the .50 Cal beats it purely on not having spinup and being more accurate.
---
Primed and maxed out on my bloody build, here's how the two weapons compare:
---
Prime Gatling Plasma - 348 energy damage per shot, 91 fire rate
---
Prime .50 Cal MG - 331 ballistic damage per shot, 91 fire rate
---
Both have a magazine size of 250, however the Gatling Plasma can go up to 350 with overcharged ultracite cores (which you should absolutely be doing if you're crafting them).
---
Now assuming we're talking about the only fight that really matters for this comparison, the Scorchbeast Queen, then we have to consider she has 300 ER/DR. We can shave off 45% of that due to stabilized, so let's use 165 armor as the baseline here.
---
In the scenario where we do split damage on the gatling plasma, that would be  174 x2 per shot. That's roughly equal to the 165 armor, so the DR % on the queen would give her a little less than 50% DR. I don't know the exacts and I'm not going to take the time to plug this all into the formula, but let's say it's about 48% DR. Comes out to about 90 x2 damage per shot that goes through armor, or 180 damage.
---
Second scenario is the .50 Cal, which does 331 damage per shot primed. 165 is almost exactly half of 331, so this comparison is easier. If your damage is double the targets armor, your damage gets reduced by 36%. So that means our ending damage would be 211 for the .50 Cal.
---
End result:
---
Prime .50 Cal = 211 damage per shot on SBQ
---
Prime Gatling Plasma = 180 damage per shot on SBQ
---
That's about a 15% difference, which is definitely noticeable, especially given the fact that the gatling plasma has other disadvantages, namely:
---
Spinup time
---
Far less accurate
---
The one thing it has going for it is that with ultracite cores, you can get 350 shots before needing to reload, which is significant, assuming you craft them while having 20+ intelligence.
---
And before someone says "yeah but you can't run ultracite ammo on the .50 cal, it's too costly", I do run ultracite on my .50 cal at all times. I crafted over 100K in under 2 weeks, and I'm refinining my method even further to be even more efficient.
---
I know not everyone runs a min/maxed bloodied build and is trying to squeeze as much dps as possible out of their character, but some of us do. Some of us enjoy killing the queen in 2-3 minutes, even when carrying 8 other players who are doing very minimal dps.
---
atleast it did in fo4
---
Are you trying to trade the imposter sheepsquatch helmet for the imposter sheep's outfit? If so, I have a spare outfit and I am looking for the helmet.
---
WAIT U/LIQUIDPAPERZ WERE NOT CAVEMEN. WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY
---
Stellar! Thanks for the info. I was worried something was wrong with my game.
---
No worries.
---
 Overall weight management. You hit it in the first try. That's why to use it
---
That's a nice way to be together and separate at the same time!
---
It’s expected to release with player vending, so likely the May9th update if everything goes according to plan
---
Yet the scammer was able to evade your trade, take the Sacred TSE, and desecrate it with their filthy mods!
---
Thanks dude!
---
I’m shy of lv.50 , mind if I join you tonight? I want to finish the main quest line.
---
Create a mule put them on it. My buddy and I have filled up the stash box of two mules already, one of them is reaching the 1500lb carry limit and we still have a month of collecting to go.

Is that I make the rules :D

Everyone is welcome. I went into it alone last night at lvl 61. Was tired of waiting on other people to help after posting twice this last week. Cleared the silo alone and finished the last mission alone. Granted when I did launch suddenly everyone wanted to join in but I was alone in my party. Just send me a request.
---
Good  post.  Let's see that greasy chode, mayo scum.
---
Whatever patch you think it is, add 1 or 2 to it. Itll get delayed.
---
I tried that as well. I was sitting on 11 Toxic Valley treasure maps amongst many others. Cashed them all in and got squat. I should have too advantage of the vendors before they patched it.
---
Rename them to have an asterisk (*) at the front of the name.  It will dump all of them at the top of their respective list.
---
Scrap/sell from the bottom.
---
how do i create a mule?
---
So I have no idea if the OP did or did not dupe, however those numbers are are actually possible in a month, especially if it was 5mm ammo, and was a hard core multi-account player.  
---
    
---
   
---
Before the weight caps, and the 3rd round of WhiteSprings nerfing I could end a 6+ hours of a nuked WS with 20,000 pounds of Junk/Legendaries/Rare crafting materials.   
---
Additionally before they instanced the plants and wood, you could log out and log back into a nuke zone and "re-pick" the same plants, netting several hundred, if not thousands of unstable fluxes, in a few hours.  
---
Additionally, once the weight caps started showing up, and the banning for excessive quantities of junk/ammo, I had hundreds of thousands of round, closing on around 800,000 of some like 5mm, because I looted everything, and rather than dropping it in bags, id dump it on mules... Now I just have 20,000 to 40,000 rounds of all ammo types..
---
Why are people disliking your comment? I’ll leave a like to fix that boi
---
Is there a downside to using sleek and ultralight on the same set? AFAIK both mods can be applied to all pieces.
---
This. Look for the spawn and most often you will find the loot
---
I just want type chat for pc why the fuuuuuck isn’t it a thing. Either we use emotes and gun bash things to communicate or we use a mic, whereas consoles can message each other.
---
That's a great quote from 'What Lies Upstream'. Thanks for mentioning it, going to watch it now.
---
It's unfortunate how much of the indifference for human life we see in FO76 is based on real events.
---
There is no such thing as a TSE Bloodied.
---
Also make a keyring while you're at it
---
Did a quick search. Amazon has it at $51 barns and noble seems to be at $60.
---
You can put some small things on the middle sections. Clocks, signs, wall lights, Greek and neon letters, the Whitespring head statues are some of the things I’ve got to fit (the statue clips through a shelf though).
---
😂😂😂
---
Try to sell off the heavier 1-stars first. If you have mats to spare, modify legendaries to make them slightly lighter.
---
50+
---
I think I was actually in the 60's.
---
Why dont get a fucking good job then you might actually understand the world until then please ask your carer to wheel you away from the computer kiddo.
---
I dindt know and level 129...but would move if i knew
---
Exactly. I know that the Brotherhood vendor sells *mods* for the T-series Power Armors, and they just may sell the plans for the Power Armor itself. The vendor should be in one of the shops at the Whitesprings, I think the one w the fireplace
---
Ok.   Thanks guys.  That would seem to be a valuable trait.
---
So would the mutations be permanent or if a player was a super mutant but wanted to be a ghoul could they change or go back to being a regular human?
---
I want to buy this.  I've been looking everywhere.
---
Oh I was unaware of that in my experience I was unable to put things like the plants and boxes
---
Nice thank you! I’ve got that nifty member discount at B&amp;N (thanks mom!) so I’ll check it out there.
---
Gah! I always forget telephones. Those things are everywhere!
---
This common if you use mods. Most updates mess with mods which you to disable until the modders update.
---
 If no mods, then it's you need to raise a Support ticket.
---
I will try. Thank you
---
That is so pimp! I'd love to see someone wearing that bad boy. Do some cosplay photos with someone attaching the pieces of a t-45 or t-51 on it while the other wears it.
---
I wish it let you place more stuff, it’s still really limited currently. Have a look at how I’ve got mine decorated for some ideas: https://youtu.be/t8xWgjxnc0U
---
Ugh something else to worry about now when playing  lol. It's only items on your character/inventory right? No stash items?
---
I know it would probably kill the servers but I wish you could place down items like you were able to do in fallout 4
---
New character
---
Most of the plans in that area are in the merchant area where the raider power spawn location is. That strip of shops
---
They’ve talked about implementing that at some point. Not exactly sure when, but interested to see how that would work in this game
---
And stash/sell it immediately. My trigger finger is always set to "scrap all", so if I bulk items I'm sure as hell going to automatically hit that button at a crafting station and undo everything. *sigh*
---
Isn't bulking to reduce item weight only a thing for aluminum and 1 other resource? You can also bulk to sell of course. Haven't bulk anything in a few hundred hours honestly
---
It is as a secondary
---
At the shooting range is where I see them.
---
Do you know we’re I could find the post they talked about this it seems interesting I’ve heard some talk of this before but was unable to find the post or what not
---
Yeah I noticed that too cuz I also bought the official guide. Theres actually quite a few things wrong which is really upsetting. But it's not too much. Some weapons don't fall under the same classes as the guide says because they added "unique" catagories for things like chainsaws (which don't count as a 2 handed weapon like the guide says). But the HUGE upside to the guidebook? Interior maps! Idk why they didn't get implemented into the game. I get turned around easily cuz I solo everything and a lot of times I'm too focused on enemies and not where I'm going. The interior maps list every useful thing I'll find in there so I don't miss shit. They're just great. I wish they would be in the game. I hate referencing a book every time I walk into a new place and feel like I missed something.
---
Man, it's been so long since I did that quest that I forgot. Thanks!
---
In all seriousness, falling into the fissure's has claimed so much of my valuable loot. I'm ashamed to admit I've died multiple times trying to tactfully extract that precious brown paper bag.
---
If you encounter a cargo bot that flees across the map when you hit it, you will notice it has no escort. Someone tried to take it down and failed. Immediately server hop to save caps/ frustration.
---
For those of you looking to buy it for information, don't bother. It is full of vague numbers and misinformation. It reads more like a child adding fluff to a paper than a real guide. I've never bought a strategy guide quite as worthless as this in my entire life. If it's just for collection purposes go for it, but it's not worth opening.
---
Lead and aluminum for sure and I think glass shards too
---
 I carry a maxxed out Western Revolver. It hits near 100 but I carry it for the 20% speed it bestows.
---
 I do shoot trash with it but its not really for combat.
---
I have that perc the NO RADS, and lead belly? No disease from eating maxed out as well.
---
I still get diseases through the high level diseased ghouls though
---
U didn’t have perk to deal more damage to glowing enemies 
---
And build who fit for 2 weapon choices it’s bad. U can’t deal a lot of damage with any of it cuz it’s double choice build 
---
Why u chose 2 weapons
---
I think this also affects regular armor.
---
Still baffles we don't have this. Has been posted a few times before. If you make a game with items so rare that you probably will rarely or never see it. At least make a secure item for item trade.

Ah, was looking for a luck piece. Not a bad price though!

There are a wide variety of places that have bags of concrete mix just lying around throughout the Forest region. The farms tend to have some along with bags of fertilizer, leaning more towards fertilizer than concrete. 
---
Most any location with construction equipment has some - sometimes a lot of it. 
---
Garden gnomes can be scrapped for concrete and (I think) with the Scrapper perk equipped their lead paint can be scraped off. 
---
Most of the places the big green meat-shields have taken over have at least a few bags of concrete mix lying around.
---
The plastic will last long enough for archaeologists in 12019 to debate the existence of the Fallout Franchise as a period of Earth's history. The planet will probably be gone but all the plastic junk should still be floating in the same orbit.

I think you should be able to share asshole GTs.
---
In real life, especially at work if someone’s an asshole it gets around quick.
---
Makes things soo much easier to know whom to avoid.
---
If we knew in advance who to avoid and block, I’m confident assholes would be left with only other assholes to play with.
---
A dream team of assholes, trapped with other assholes.
---
Fwiw, this RP raider thing is just an excuse for assholes to be assholes.
---
I bring out my Shotgun and Enforcer and just keep shooting at it until I break the rotors and it slows or stops, then I switch to a Bloodied Gatling Gun to bring down the Vertibots and the Cargobot.
---
Enforcer just has a high chance of crippling (30% at Rank 3) compared to the other cripple-related perks.
---
So do you want it or not?
---
Yeah that’s stalking. I’d have blocked that asshole’s GT
---
Similar issues with certain mods on the pump shotgun, they preview as having the camo paint from the atom shop. Not sure if that shows on the actual game model tho
---
Nah I'm good but ty
---
I dunno. Maybe they’re taking it as me dumping on Bethesda, which wasn’t my intent. I did want to lunch some nukes on the burrows as I’ve heard that livens things up quite a bit.
---
And here I was thinking that I HAD to let the bastards suck my blood in order to be able to look tick blood... Silly me

Same man, i ONLY got the legs. Haven't seen any Toxic treasure maps since that one.

Only happened to me once, random nuked morgantown, some guy ran in front of my laser gat and evaporated &gt;&lt;  Weird bug tho.
---
I was not able to meaningfully contribute to the SBQ fight until I was level 90. Your own mileage may vary. I wouldn't discourage level 50s from trying but if you don't have enforcer maxxed out helping cripple her you're really not accomplishing much. 
---
I'd recommend you not actually \*launch\* a nuke on fissure prime until you're level 90 or so but feel free to participate if someone else does it, better chances of there being a nice high level squad to piggy back off of.
---
I had my "looking to the future" photo pose vanishing from my account. It says it's bought in the atomic shop, but nowhere to be found in the photomode. And that's an atomic shop item. I got it for free, so i don't care too much, but when things you pay money for disappear, it's not good at all..
---
Exactly this. Now you have to worry about situations where, instead of sharing the same world space with 25 people, you've got 25 people in 25 instances of the same space. In a game engine that was not initially designed for multiplayer this is just asking for a whole host of nightmares.
---
You think I can run in here solo I'm running a omehanded build x3 with the non automatic rifles x3 card
---
It gives you Mothman's ability to teleport.
---
Only joking, it's just red.
---
I know, I know. 2 weapons is not optimized. Glow Sight is a good situational choice though.
---
They are. Player vending is coming soon.
---
This is the kinda bug nobody likes but everyone can tolerate because the game is online.
---
I shot a guy who ran in front of me as I was killing a mob of scorched. He and another guy had been trying to PVP me for a while, so maybe it triggered the revenge/shoot back thing. Although I thought the point of pacifist was that you couldn't hurt anyone else, intentional or not.
---
Hey, gunna piggyback here. I'm on XB1 and will build anyone anything i can in exchange for Stimpacks! Like, 2 for a build.
---
Okay, so it's a free red just when you use those. Someone mentioned a black scaly particle effect but after this long it seemed impossible there was no pics.

Silver EXC-17 it is then 😁

This explains my issue with crafting my jet pack thanks !
---
Starting to seem like a good ol' case of the trade stealing. Lots of reports within a couple of days but we can't seem to get a single video of it. We can get videos of a funny experience with another player or some enemy bugging out, but this is obviously too rare to capture footage
---
Sweet!

Farm Watoga for power armor pieces. I believe there are three spawns that are easy to check and server hop.

I think it’s must have all the time, never know what enemy u face over the corner and when event starts always forget to change ur perks

Try to find ur main weapon

cheers :)

I enjoy building on cliffs, way over the edge. If my stuff is being attacked, I fast travel back and if they're still there, pay 15 caps to move my camp and watch them suddenly fall to their deaths. Collect some loot and scoot away,!

Giant green bat, I was training my mewtwo in leafgreen by grinding victory road and found a shiny golbat.
---
On a completely unrelated note, on the day I got my preordered soulsilver (march 14, I think 2012 or 2011 or something) I found a shiny pidgey and then a shiny rattata. No, I did not buy a lottery ticket, at the time I assumed it was a preorder bonus or something to find more shinies because I was a kid

---
You don't really deserve those downvotes, but i wouldn't recommend 45 for anyone. 50+ for sure.
---
This is honestly one of my biggest issues with the game right now. Stairs and second floors seem to have taken a straight downgrade from how they functioned in FO4, honestly I have no idea how or why they seemingly put extra work in and ended up with something inferior.
---
Some guy traded his explosive shotgun to his friend,and tried to pvp me. I had a rifle build with a railway rifle(which is decent at pvp). I thought I was gonna die,because he had an op weapon,while I had a barebones rifle. Long story short,I killed him several times.
---
Yeah, which makes it special. The quest reward ones are not level 50
---
They’re still available in workshops until misc items, but not camps.
---
If there is an effect it's not very noticable. Well, I haven't noticed anyhoo.
---
Oh I don't care for downvotes..but I noticed after level 45 my character was super super strong
---
Hey Bethesda - how about a celebration period after major events, where everyone is still on the event group for a minute after the event completes. Give everyone a chance to get back to their base...
---
I'd love that. I used perfect storm for a while, but it's only level 40, and I now have a furious 10mm smg (level 50) that I use instead. We can't find incendiary weapons until they add in 4* weapon potential, so this is the only fire smg we can get.
---
This would be great as I always keep ammo and other items aside for friends I know use it. Like one I always hold back heavy weapons ammo he uses.
---
Same with the concrete ramp foundation. Kinda makes me sad it doesn’t come with atom shop floor options
---
That was clever...I built every egg...but forgot to put the blob egg. )-: I guess I fail wirh the eggs...

Usually there are plenty in bathrooms etc in buildings. I know specifically that I found two in those trucks in the road leading up to the robco plant (by the general's steakhouse)

Any office complex, some of the bigger cities. Sugar Grove as mentioned, also Westeck, the satellite arrays make sure you tag them in your Pip-boy.
---
Once a week I will stand outside of vault 76 waiting for people to peek out. I drop all 2* legendary stuff and plans and recipes I already know that I accumulated throughout the week. Ammo as well, I only use shotgun, 5mm, and mainly melee so everything else gets dropped outside the vault. Iv watched a few times a lvl 50 or higher swoop in and try to take them. Iv followed them just hiding in the shadows back to there base and throw a orbital on it.
---
Has anyone tried timing? Like most of you I’ve spent weeks on this, then I thought how golfers like to get an early start to there day, so I went to the resort around 4am game time, around the 5am mark I managed to kill 6, left and came back around 5am again and got the remaining 4.
---
Did you check up? All plans there? I was only that night till the items changed on the server. Maybe it mixed something up...
---
dump them in the chest/toolbox at the overseers camp

that is what i do with ammo weapons and armor that are useless to me

---
I don't usually use forums or Reddit, I usually just post comments on Ancap blogs like Molyneux or Cantwell's blog, but they didn't seem appropriate places to post my story. So here goes, I just wanted to share this with all of you.
---
Nov 3 I flew to Europe for a Eurotrip type tour. Not a guide or packaged deal, just going around by myself. I paid for half of the trip with the wages I earned over the last two years, my dad paid for the other half. I am 19, I guess that is normal starting college and all. (Before that I worked for my dad's company part time, so I guess you could say he paid for all of it, lol).
---
I did France and then Italy and then Greece next. I am an Ancap so I wanted to see anarchists in these places. Yes, I know they are different kinds of "anarchists" and not really full anarchists like us. I went to an anarchist book store in Italy and it had a lot of English books, but no Rothbard or Ancap. Like I said, I expected that, not a surprise.
---
I went to Greece, which everyone knows is famous for its revolutionary anarchism, its economic crisis and everything going on right now. Here I found directions for a local anarchist center. I went and didn't see anybody, but it was covered in graffiti, mostly in Greek so I couldn't read it. Whatever, I started taking pictures. Then some people came out and confronted me.
---
This should have been my first warning sign something was not right, because photography is not a crime. They were not violent, but they were not friendly, like asking who I was, what I wanted. They all spoke good English actually. Not uncommon in Greece. I said I was a tourist and an anarchist and I just wanted to take pictures. Then they got friendly and told me I should have asked first (but pictures are no NAP violation so I don't know why, but I didn't say anything) and they invited me inside.
---
We hung out for a while and smoked hash (there is no good dank in Europe as you might find out like in Cali, everyone smokes hash with tobacco which isn't as cool as it sounds). We started talking about politics and anarchism. I was trying to talk about the state, they were like yeah no doubt the state was bad. But they wanted to talk about capitalism, capitalism this and that. This is when we started to get into a debate.
---
I told them that what they called capitalism is different from the free market. They said capitalism is free markets. And I said I agreed. That is what I am saying. Real capitalism is free markets. And they said yes, that is what we are trying to get rid of. And I said no, but we don't even have that right now. We need more free markets. And everyone at the same time was like "nooo" we are anarchists, we are against capitalism. Anarchists oppose capitalism.
---
And I said but not anarcho-capitalists. Anarcho-capitalists are the anarchists who support capitalism. I had a fanny pack (yeah, lame I know) for my camera and in that I had this yellow and black bowtie (also super lame, it was a joke but I wasnt wearing it). And I said look, these are the Ancap colors, yellow and black, like versus the communist red and black. Well, these guys had a lot of red and black in the building already so I thought they would get it.
---
I think that is when it started to get a really bad vibe, really tense in the air. The free market thing was funny, we disagreed but I think they thought I was just confused. Everyone was uncomfortable now. Then someone said markets wont work with democracy. And I said exactly, that's it, democracy is against anarchism. And they kind of agreed, and said yes, we don't have real democracy, just governments, and we needed more democracy. I said no, we need less democracy, democracy is the enemy. And we need to end democracy to have anarchy. Then they were all like "noooo" again. You know that thing people do in groups when everyone all says "nooo" or expresses some disapproval at the same time.
---
And one of them said "but we do want to stop democracy" and then they kind of spoke back and forth in Greek. I didn't really understand it. And they asked me what I meant.
---
So I said okay, I had the floor, I was going to tell them about ancapism. And I tried to explain to them some Rothbard and Hoppe. I said the natural order in anarchy is that the best rise to the top, the market picks who is the best. They compete and are peaceful. They said what do we want instead of anarchy. I said we want private owners to own their own land and businesses, and to employ people. They said that is what we have now. I said no, it would be even better. One of the guys said it was like feudalism. And I said it is not feudalism.
---
Eventually one of the guys spoke up and I thought he was Greek, but he spoke English perfectly so he may have not been. He said he knew what anarcho-capitalism was and that we were basically fascists. He asked me if I thought everything should be private. And I said yes. And he asked me if I thought people were unequal. And I told him yes. And that not everyone would have equal rights. I said everyone has the right to own property and not be done aggression against. But that not everyone had to be treated equally by the owners. He said what about immigrants and racism. And I said that would not happen in a free market, but yes property owners could be racist if they wanted to. They had to respect property.
---
Then he called me a fascist again, and someone else said I was a fascist. And then they basically all started shouting fascist at me, and one of them grabbed me by the wrists. They pulled me out the door, it was up three floors, and basically drug me down the stairs on my back. It hurt really bad and I remember yelling "you're breaking the NAP" and things like that. "Stop initiating force against me." Then they kicked me around on the ground in the hallway, before they took my camera and threw me outside. I was crying and stuff, I just sat there. I was in shock because it was so sudden. Looking back there were warning signs though.
---
I think they felt bad for me and gave the camera back, but when I looked later they stole the memory card with all of my Greek photos.
---
So they initiated force and theft. They broke the NAP. I knew the left anarchists were not real anarchists, but I never knew they would do something that bad.
---
I wasnt seriously hurt, just kicked around a little, lots of bruises and little cuts. I am fine guys so don't worry. Just needed to share.
---
FBI wants to know your location
---
Boy how do you think most communitys grow through sharing there things and dividing up land loot thats practically what communism boils down to

Honestly, 23 NPCs in a world four times the size of Fallout 4 isn’t only “not enough,” it’s a bit of an insult.

Was waiting for a description of that nice 3\* he had in there but vanished. Had this happen once but was due to server crashing. I just looted a AA swingspeed agility Deathclaw. About half a minute after I pick it up server dies.
---
Yes PLEASE 
---
ladders would nice as well
---
I think Scorched Earth automatically puts all players involved into a scripted pacifist mode... until it ends.
---
Yep, should've used a lead pipe instead, with how FO76's damage balancing works they might have had a better chance. I might actually just try that out later.
---
I have lead belly, hazmat and aquaboy and I still get &lt;1 rads per pull. It adds up to about 1/32 of my life total after 50 pulls

---
Second this. I bought this because I always buy fallout guides anyway, but the info in here is not very helpful. Especially with the online, constant update nature of the game, I'm sure a lot of the info in the guide isn't accurate anymore.
---
NPCS are coming eventually i believe
---
We can only wildly speculate. What outcome were you honestly expecting from this thread? Exclusive Bethesda insider info? Hahaha
---
You're right, we don't know, and I stated that. Your evidence is anecdotal indeed, and there is also a difference between client performance and server stability. I have hundreds of notes in my stash that weigh nothing and my game runs just fine with them there. Does that mean you're wrong and I'm right? Vice versa? Its worthless anecdotes, but then you use it as the foundation of your next paragraph.
---
If one copper scrap and 100,000 weren't any different or barely different for the server to handle, I sort of doubt that they would be creeping up the stash limit, as junk and other stackable is what is taking up most people's stash space, based on what I have seen people saying. I would expect them to fix storage by making certain things weightless in the stash so that the pounds of storage could go toward the things that negatively effect the server performance, like armor and weapons. Also, if notes were such a detriment to the server stability, they most likely would have identified that and addressed it. Instead they focused on weight as a way to address time-based server instability. It doesnt stand to reason, then, that weightless items like notes were such a major concern that even one player on a server dumping their notes caused noticeable performance gains. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong and it is about unique items, but the things they have said and their systems to limit item hoarding dont make sense then, because any one player could bring the servers down by hording weightless notes.
---
Saying offline friend
---
I figure maybe someone who has played the game may have some information that may be an "easter egg" or something else that implies their might be NPCs added. A man can dream!
---
Its Ad Victoriam not Hictoriam
---
Agree!!! Also, I would love it if you could stack the Scaffolding Staircases. that would allow much neater ways of making multi8 story structures or "watchtower" structure that doesn't look so weirdly unsupported.

Sending a friend request and will join y'all tonight

Kindly go drink bleach maybe it'll sort your broken brain out.

Didn’t they fix this recently though?
---
Yeah I just checked, I still have all the plans, not sure if they didn't disappear from or me or they just didn't bug out since I had them placed, but yep, have all four plans for the eggs so far. Have you checked under Floor decor and then on the same tab as the Deathclaw statue?
---
Definitely need a pile of ammo and stimpacks. I was lvl 61 when I ran silo alone. Had 165 stims and over 1400 5.56 ammo. After dropping the nuke and killing the sbq I had 3 stims and zero ammo.

Sounds good. See you then

Yeah, I know. 🙄 I built a bar and called it the Ad Hictoriam as a drunken mispronounced version of the phrase. Friend has The Pubwyn.

I’ve done exactly the same. Except I’ve gone for “Ze Fasnacht Beret” for instance 😂
---
Or at least being able to sort by food and drink in the aid tab. Those being the first 2 options.

I was shooting heroin and reading “The Fountainhead” in the front seat of my privately owned police cruiser when a call came in. I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief. “Bad news, detective. We got a situation.” “What? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?” “Worse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars’ worth of bitcoins.” The heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. “What kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?” “Not yet. But mark my words: we’re going to figure out who did this and we’re going to take them down … provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.” “Easy, chief,” I said. “Any rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.” He laughed. “That’s why you’re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.” “Don’t worry,” I said. “I’m on it.” I put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside. “Home Depot™ Presents the Police!®” I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. “Nobody move unless you want to!” They didn’t. “Now, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?” No one spoke up. “Come on,” I said. “Don’t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?” It didn’t seem like they did. “Seriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I’m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.” Nothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn’t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing. I figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it. “Subway™ Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!®” I yelled. Too late. He was already out the front door. I went after him. “Stop right there!” I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen. I was losing him. “Listen, I’ll pay you to stop!” I yelled. “What would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I’ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn ‘Bob Barr ‘08’ extra-large long-sleeved men’s T-shirt!” He turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose. “All right, all right!” the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. “I give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.” “Why’d you do it?” I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos™ Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs® on the guy. “Because I was afraid.” “Afraid?” “Afraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,” he said. “I’m a central banker.” I wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head. “Let this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,” I said. “No matter how many bitcoins you steal, you’ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.” He nodded, because he knew I was right. Then he swiped his credit card to pay me for arresting him.

It's a good nuking spot since there are so many ghouls that spawn

I have the coat for 4k lmk if you're interested

Saaaaame. Its SO good.

When you spawn in to top of the world go straight until you run into a beat down abandoned shop with a ski lift behind it. Plan spawns on a book shelf.

I was actually thinking the same last night. Wondered briefly how many there were and if there would be enough for every player.

I think it could be like a mini raid. Just like in rust, but you can rebuild it instantly after the raider has left or died.

Never and I mean never unless the person is wanted is a base warranted. Excessive sirens, either turn your settings Dow temporarily or move away. Turret houses well......stop camping whitespring it was nerfed for a reason and those houses as annoying as they are pose no gameplay problem for anyone unless your are farming whitespring golf club and if you’re still doing that you are playing the game wrong. Did you guys know there are multiple areas of the game? Like cranberry where if you play the game correctly the xp is plentiful and can be very lucrative especially in rarer items such as outfits and headware. Not dogging you as everyone has their own opinion but if you camp Whitesprings the game will get old fast
---
I was pointing out that you said commie. 
---
I rather be dead than red.
---
Don't know what your build is but im also at lvl 200+ and with the run of the mill non legendary shishkabab it only takes me 1-2 hits to take down a lvl 68 super mutant, im not even specced for melee as i run a stealth/vats crit bloodied rifleman build with unyielding/sentinels set. Though i usually do the 1 hit kills when bloodied so your mileage may vary.
---
Where ppl buying weapons
---
Prolly lights up
---
It does, usually at least for me there a bunch o level 58 charred ghouls but with the nuke they were glowing charred ghouls at like level 69 or something, was a bit more intense
---
 I just sell em' to Wallace. ;)
---
Yeah big oof
---
&gt; the game is really inefficient in terms of how it tracks things.
---
Well it is built off their ESO/Fallout version of the Gamebryo engine, so, that's probably exactly it. Those games have never been good at doing basic things like this. Every single one has stability problems and problems with item containers.

No plans. You can just buy the actual mid (which doesn't work now, since the last update).

---
X-01 PA doesn't have plans for the mods. You can find the actual mod at the enclave vendor though. However right now mods are not working.
---
I get the online nature of it, I didn't expect the information to hold up over time, and no one acting reasonably should. The problem is that it's clear they didn't even make an attempt with it. It was just thrown together like many aspects of the game and it reeks of laziness. They should be ashamed of themselves for selling the guide in to be honest.
---
It just works!
---
It's a fun seasonal event. Suck it up.
---
Laaaame. What a bummer.
---
ORANGE MAN BAD.
---
Not at all what I said. It's easy/fast if you have 20 people in it.  Do it solo, with all mobs spawned, where you have to find the key etc and fight the half dozen Colonel Gutsys at the end and it has some challenge and a decent amount of time to complete.
---
You can't, sorry. They're not replaceable if you sell them.
---
So much this! We really need more freedom when it comes to stair placement.
---
Armor weight affects a few sneak related things. Weightless with ultralight takes up little to no space, this is great for people who use PA a lot but want some armor on them at all times. On 2 of my guys I carry a weightless ultralight piece with weapon reduction in my inventory for fast travel purposes.
---
Off topic but I reckon Insultbot's accent should be Scottish. Robot Malcolm Tucker following players around would've been far funnier.
---
I did event last night and NO ONE showed up to help. lil disappointed

I haven't played in a few days (I'm very casual)...and being so casual, I would lose total interest if I lost the 3 nice guns I have.  I think I will not play again until these bugs are fixed...

So you attacked a group if guys that had bounties, got smoked, respawned across the street, and were surprised they came at you again?  I mean, it was more than likely a trap but you fell for it.
---
I got my only 3* as an axe. +1 endurance, anti bugs, and furious. 
---
I went into a rifle build and it outperforms every rifle I have. Mostly because I have no good legendary rifles.
---
Downside is it like lvl 35
---
ORANGE MAN GOOD :\^|
---
Well i sold it after the patch which provide favorite item sell notice... maybe i will send a feedback about this like ultracite power armor quest of the bos.
---
Afaik that's how it's supposed to work,  even if you have a workshop or something and are therefore pvpable,  pacifist should prevent you dealing damage. Definitely a bug
---
One trick I've seen and tried myself is to stack tables to create shelves.  There's one table in particular - it's the rusty brown metal one - which has a similar shelf version under Shelves.   If you place the table, and put some stuff on it, you can place another instance of that table on top of it, and therefore create a "shelf" that has stuff on the top and the bottom.
---
Yeah, this.  I didn’t realize early on that they were irreplaceable.  Kinda regret that now
---
[deleted]
---
Where it says pure flux, does that mean stable flux isn’t useable?
---
Come now i got 4 so far
---
If you've got a good stack of damage perks, some psycho, a max-level legendary weapon with decent DPM and plenty of ammo then you'll be above average. 
---
If you don't want to be heavily dependent on who shows up then you'll need to be running a bloodied build, or at least heavy weapons.
---
I had a totally restart my Xbox the other day in order to get the Easter Egg for that day to show up.
---
Same thing. Raw flux makes stable flux which is also referenced as pure. Flux.
---
Yeah, on pure overall numbers the heavy combat is better but for more balance with DR, heavy metal is best, if these figures are still right.
---

---
I did this is fallout 4 and it was awesome. The day they allow us to place stash clutter its the first thing i'm gonna do lol
---
Well i accidentally sold them to vendor and cant find it back.
---
I haven't even seen the new vendors. Where are they exactly?
---
But I have to agree with you. Since they have 1400 caps I have only once encountered a vendor that had no caps left. 
---
But I guess that has also something to do with the new dungeon. When people get bored with it Whitesprings will be full again.
---
Probably from future dlc. Im guessing vault raids
---
I think I heard someone say that they might become a thing during nuclear winter
---
You might get qued
---
4th star by adding a prime receiver to a gun. Maybe there is another legendary mod yet to be discovered.
---
rip brave warrior, a toast to one who, though outnumbered and undergunned, stood his ground and fought to the end
---
Agreed. I went into a nuke drop zone at level 10 (bad idea bc of radiation) and took out at least a total of 10% of her health. But when she died, I got nothing.
---
Ultra-light power armor chassis
---
It because it seems like there are other ways to accomplish what Weightless does, and confer other benefits on the player.  If you run Unyielding, you gain an extra 5 Strength even at half-health, which translates to what?  Another 25 lbs. of carry weight?  Not to mention the buffs to every other stat.  There's Sturdy Frame, where even a single rank can save you a considerable amount of weight across *all* pieces of armor.  There's also Marsupial and its carry weight bonus.
---
5/23 is the legendary vendor date and has been for weeks
---
REFUGEES WELCOME.
---
I prefer robots rather than terminals.
---
And small squares
---
It should be under the capital building. Much more realistic.
---
He likes an extra pair of hands by his bed
---
The terminal could use some better function options first. Anyone who has tried to set up wiring and switches further than the basic wire to door to generator will know this. Terminal feels useless and needs more function or at least not list ALL switches as one on off (even pressure plates).
---
50, at a minimum, because you'll have all your SPECIAL points and access to top-tier weaponry.  It's going to depend on your perk selection and luck in Legendaries too.
---
All about those cheese wheels
---
Does weightless count as unarmored, and berserkers weapons would be appropriate legendary effect of choice?
---
You’re missing the whole point of his post- he’s talking about the weight vs damage difference. He can get 98% of the damage for 40% of the weight, with a pole hook.
---
when you die due to bad healthcare but it's ok because a few slavic people starved 90 years ago 👍😎👌
---
I don't bother with that perk. I have so much radx and radaway I don't need it. I sell my diluted because I don't need it.
---
Theyre inside whitesprings resort. The one with all the robots wandering around. All factions, excluding enclave, are hosted there somewhere in the shops. 
---
Bottoming out the 1400 cap isnt rough once you get serums. 500 caps for a stable flux and it can proc super duper. Its not hard to generate enough.
---
im here with that, my RS 74 weighs in at about 12 lbs with its attachments, i think if i stripped it i could get it down to about 7-8
---
12 lbs is 5.45 kg
---
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
---
What if there are 3 different tokens, where you only can get all 3 different tokens from 3 stars items? And maybe a small cap fee for each reroll? That would give the game a economic boost, where caps and 3*/2* legendary items actually are valuable.
---
This is just speculation on my side, of course, but that's probably how i would have done it.
---
Can't go wrong with 4 hands 😉
---
If I were you and wasn’t willing to get a second game on a second account to use as a mule, I’d sell off any that were heavy and low stars (1 Star gatlings, missile launchers etc) and modify any that were 2-3 stars to be lighter.
---
You dont have to goto those vendors. Each is able to be sold goods at their respective locations as well.
---
I'm hopeful that most of that will be added later but I also can understand why they didn't put too much CAMP stuff in the game.
---
Bloody Harpoon Gun is my Heavy sniper. The only real downsides are limited scope options (1 short scope), and harpoons are not hitscan. They have travel time and bullet drop. But it weighs 2lbs.
---
Id assume so at one point. I found mine in a cage that had a dog and a skeleton in it.
---
Been going on for a while. Bethesda believes if they ignore the problem it doesn't exist. It does get old.
---
She did report. It was five of them! :(
---
They're zombies. Dangerous, diseased, ridiculously radioactive zombies. Kill 'em all. \*grin\*
---
Just call in a supply drop. They usually give 100 pre-war money.
---
I didn't think much of them (except for that irritating "Protect and serve!") until I decided to farm for the Puncturing mod on the Power Fist.  I didn't have all the resources on hand to make multiple Power Fists, but at Whitesprings, I could easily buy bulk of whatever I needed from the many vendors there.  That would have sent me on a wild goose chase all across the world before.
---
With your armor or PA you wouldn't be. This is for sure a new issue.
---
If effects the spawn of that location, true I can go elsewhere (which does not bother me) but for the general person the most known, easy to trigger, guaranteed spot is there. Most people don’t know that he spawns in other locations. It’s a double edged sword, and it all depends on the person hopping.
---
Events over good job everyone that participated
---
I just logged on and mines disappeared. I can't finish the quest line.
---
I have chameleon, Marsupial, speed demon and run weightless gear. ultra light mods for the AP. also have reduced fall damage, reduced junk weight, and underwater breathing modifiers on them so far. coupled with stealth and crit boosting vats build, I almost never use power armor, just for rads situations.
---
I only bother fast traveling for the events, otherwise its easy enough to sprint across just about anywhere. Best way to find good legendaries in my opinion
---
It’s a diving suit. It allowed water breathing in fallout 4
---
I'm keeping all my 3\* and some light 2\* and everything else goes to vendors. There is zero knowledge on how the vendor will work , but I'm hoping 3\* will get more/better tokens than 1\*
---
Will have to wait a month more until that comes at earliest, unless they delay that too.
---
Waste of time doing it at the overseers camp though. It'll all be lvl 50 stuff and won't be any use to newbies. Once in a blue moon, I get lvl 1 pieces which I leave on the dead body outside 76. Lvl 5 stuff I leave at overseers. Lvl 20 at the firestation, everything else in the sack outside whitesprings Station.
---
Highest will probably be 4 star drops since the prime reciever adds a star or there will be more mods released that can add stars
---
That sounds like a great place for a dungeon. 
---
I can think of another few places that might be great for one, too. Like the Palace of the Winding Path.
---
Only thing that ticket Will get you is a sorry about your luck reply.
---
A few points in rifle or pistol is fine with shotguns as primary. It helps to have something that can sneak headshot at range, and to save shells when finishing off the melee enemies you leave writhing on the floor.
---
I wouldn't know about this shotgun/VATS stuff though. Isn't the spread a problem with VATS? With a crit, do all the pellets automatically hit?
---
OPEN BORDERS
---
Ah, I forgot about that. I wonder how you get in in FO76.
---
Protect and serve
---
Yeah I know man. But I hope it will let know Bethesda should change something..
---
Something was definitely going on with my inventory last night.  It was like there were duplicate items in my inventory, but one of them did nothing.  It didnt have a picture, I couldn't switch to it.  If I selected the second Item though it would work.  Multiple items too.  Hats, my pistol etc.
---
Do you find any? I ve been seaeching a helmet for an entire week and i havent found anything :(
---
Myself included, there are several people who have gotten him to spawn at Charleston with someones camp there.
---
A second for a low visibility camp. I only have 4 crafting benches, bed, cook station, pump well, and stash.  All built on the ground without foundations.  Usually a short walk or travel to any other benches I need.
---
Due to its size, I can hide it in a depression or along a cliff  if the game allows, which means less foot traffic. Had a couple great places 1) just N of Cobelton Farm on a cliff point with a great view of farmland or the whole length of Toxic Valley and 2) right next to 4 Cu deposits by the lighthouse.
---
Its not over yet. More quests are coming
---
It's not like the people building assets are the same people fixing glitches. This is like the "Why are scientists^tm spending time going to space when they could be curing cancer?"
---
That’s interesting I honestly haven’t dived into the “quests” and maps part of the guide too much. I’ve been thinking about utilizing it more since Survival Mode keeps me in the same general area depending on where my CAMP is.
---
Anyone selling the mascot set and imposter fit?
---
I had this happen so I opened a ticket thinking it was an easy fix. Was told that they're not responsible for in game items and the item could not be returned.
---
But they did say they were sorry...
---
I've noticed this too.  Taken with the silos, robots are kind of like the game's difficulty crutch.  Whenever the game wants to do something remotely difficult, it relies on spamming Colonel Gutsy.
---
At the same time, it probably ends up being a convenient excuse for why an NPC can take a lot of punishment.  No one would accept an ordinary Scorched or Ghoul playing the part of the Imposter Sheepsquatch because it's too wimpy.  But an Assaultron?  Sure, it's a combat robot, so therefore it has magical abilities that fleshy things wouldn't have.
---
I think what disappointed me about Laying Lowe is that I expected to see an actual Sheepsquatch, if only to answer the question - can this game actually add entirely new NPCs instead of giving existing NPCs silly hats?  I guess the Eyebomb is new, but it still has the model of an existing enemy.
---
 Haven’t had more server problems since the change, but I appreciate that the bots have different stock.
---
Pubwyn, love it!
---
Yeah. I hoped that we'll get some new cool monsters and not those old recycled things.
---
I really hope that we will get a future update that allows us to choose between a base game world and a "post game world" for those who played through the campaign.  There could be a time jump, maybe ten years or so, with people repopulating appalachia and human NPC's. But I guess the future will be more robots.
---
Yes please. This would also make watchtowers doable.
---
F
---
I was kind of hoping there would have been way more too the nuka cola plant when I first played this. Fallout 4’s plant had so much interesting stuff going on. So a dungeon there would be pretty cool to expand upon it.
---
interested as well. i figured id have to go to rifleman and melee, but if there is a heavy and melee build that is successful, i wanna hear it to lol
---
A system like what is in [Warframe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPevz9LPEwQ) would be awesome.
---
You can trade with game money or with up to 5 items and the other player can also put game money or up to five items. 
---
When you are happy with your side you click Ok and wait until other player also clicks Ok. Then you will once more click Ok to accept the trade as it is. Yes there are lots of clicks, but those safeguard you from bad trades and scams.
---
The good part is that you can trade ie. 3\* God Tier TSE for 5 items.
---
asking the real questions
---
If you looking for plans to built the X01, it's at the computer in the military bunker, it says Archive Computer or something like that, when you first go up the ramp, you will see red computers, turn left and I believe it is the next set in the next room, will say schematics .. as people already no plans for mods. You don't need to have done I am Death to get the plans, just up to that point before you should be able to access them ..
---
It’s not exactly a scripted pacifist model. All events put everyone in an “event group” mode until the event is over (you naturally don’t do damage to group members). That’s why their nameplates are a different shade and you can see them from much farther away. 
---
It’s possible to leave the event via the Pip-Boy though... so you can even slaughter people during the event, if circumstances allow.
---
Good idea
---
Also, I'm not saying *you* are wrong. I just think this opinion of "its wrong to destroy someone camp, unless it's at the Charleston vendor spawn" is wrong and is more or less the exact same as people who go around destroying camps in well-trafficked areas.
---
You clearly stated you have been tempted but don't engage in this behavior.
---
 Just trying to put out alternative info if I can.
---
Id be so excited if I had to fight a behemoth, or a super deathclaw
---
They did an odd nerfing of the marine armor for FO76 to keep other options viable.
---
Nice, I actually am on the same thought train. Shared Pool makes them unneccessary. It is absolutely okay, to visit the locations when searching for specific Stuff.
---
I think it's plausible if you specifically choose Unarmed, since that only has 3 points of Iron Fist to worry about instead of 9 points in Slugger or Gladiator.
---
Granted, when it comes to PvE, you don't really need 9 points there.  You could take 1 rank of each and get a 30% bonus.
---
It's great to have the caps pooled - saves so much hassle when selling. 
---
I can see how it is maybe daft to have all factions at whitespring as well, but it has its uses. For example I was looking for a weapon plan last night and couldn't for the life of me recall which faction sold it. So I just hopped to whitesprings and went round them all till I found it. Saved a lot of caps! 
---
However I'd prefer to see them situated elsewhere. Perhaps in one of the shops that serves no real purpose? Or a separate room, with it's own loading so it has less impact on the initial whitesprings spawn.
---
sorry wrong reddit
---
I run a melee sniper. Build on xb1 iv been quite successful. Level 102 currently
---
I started a new character and wouldn't mind someone moving some gear over from my other guy.
---
PSN: BlaccRandomGuy
---
I love this
---
Very cool.
---
Im on PC
---
Wow what a way to go not like me, i fell into 1 as well being chased to my doom by a scorched beast and some scorched  unfortunately i survived and i couldn't die since i was in xo1 power armor  and everything turned there attention to my friend, i got a long and shameful death that took 10mins where my lvl 34 friend got the quick hero death 😢
---
I wouldn’t run it as a combined build (as in keeping both sets of cards equipped at once). But if you have the levels, and especially if you’re on PC, you can build alternate sets and swap from HW to melee at will. Perk Loadout Manager makes that trivial. I can go from HW/Explosives to a 1h melee build in 2 seconds. I have a 2h build as well, but I rarely use it- the weapons are waaaaay heavier (and slower!), and with a low health build, my 1h swords oneshot basically everything short of scorchbeasts anyway. And if it’s a big boy like a SB... well, I’m going to use HW anyway :D
---
they are under floor decor, if you have the vault boy lawn gnome its in that list
---
Sell the * or give them to new players. Sell the heaviest **/***. Keep the rest around for the either player vending or the legendary vendor coming next month.
---
Does the mortar Brotherhood rifle thing work?
---
Can I have a couple?  I'm just level 13 and my weapons suck.  :-)
---
They attacked me and I didn't have much of a choice on where to spawn, for all they knew they were destroying a random base.
---
Pretty sure theyre in floor decor. If I remember correctly they are grouped with other atom store itens so you have to toggle through to find them.
---
Ah, ok thank you.
---
In that case I’d be interested in the Talons mutation.
---
Sure, you available now?
---
I see your point but think of all the fun well have when they hatch lol!
---
(Ok they probably wont hatch, seeing as they are made of concrete, but it's fun to wonder if they will. After all, they bleed if you hit them. Not a feature of concrete last time I checked....)
---
So probably the vendor will be here 5/30
---
On PC at least, it's in that list, but inexplicably to the *left*, not to the right, of the default item.
---
Ah yes, I forgot they can’t do more than one thing at a time.
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
Never seen that one before
---
Regarding the spam filter, put in a tech ticket and they will fix it.  I had the issue a while back, and they tweaked something in my account.  It took a couple days, but issues since.
---
No problem.
---
&gt; Door variant that opens inward to the left when facing outward. They all open to the right.
---
You can have them open on either side, just install them from the other side of the wall.  
---
(If you're inside the building and they're opening the 'wrong' way, go to the outside and build it, it'll be the 'right' way.
---
Do you mean the prime receiver will add a star in the future? Because it doesn’t at the moment.
---
They’re literally just randomly scattered among the existing shops in haphazard locations.
---
Fuck, I've taken on way worse than that. I didn't expect them to have big daddy with max explosive stats and 3 star gernade launcher. Still doesn't really justify destroying my base after the fact.
---
My first character was heavy melee and it worked to take down scorch beasts by have a high powered gatling gun and the all rise you could aa gun them to the ground and swing on them with all your might
---
Oh man I’ve been losing my mind over these things. I’ll check there now.
---
Loch Ness comin'
---
I hate how we keep seeing stuff in their promotional videos that we can’t obtain. Like that skull gauntlet they used. Where is that? Stop showing us things we can’t have Bethesda.
---
I'm new to the game and to pvp. Can you go into detail on your build? It sounds fun.
---
Only for like 20 minutes-ish. Gotta go get my leafly pickup when the dispensary opens. 
---
I'm down to just play through the game for awhile though, this character is only like level 7 and the guns I want to move are level 50.
---
The game. The game. The game.
---
Sounds good to me I am only level 2 at the moment
---
To me, the elusiveness of this true sheepsquatch is 80% of the fun to these quests. Had we not seen the in game model, I’d probably be a lot less interested, but the payoff when the real deal comes out is going to be awesome
---
sorry that the reasons i decided to use weightless on my build don't live up to the "bloodied master race" meta circlejerk going on.
---
unyield- i can run weightless, keep my full hp since im not a bloodied build and have no intention to respec into bloodied. it will also save me 20-30k on unyielding sent armor so i can spend those elsewhere and not have to worry about stat nerfs in the future.
---
sturdy- i can also save 2 points from STR by not using sturdy and use it in other perks useful to my build.
---
marsupial- im sorry i thought we were talking specifically armor in the thread? anyway, yes im aware of the mutation and i do use it. i also am not a fan of heavily relying on something that can be very easily removed accidentally and requires a rare/expensive recipe or potentially hours of rad grinding to obtain.
---
Vases, candles, sculptures, marble busts, small stashes like tool boxes to name a few others
---
Under floor decor, go to the mini deathclaw statue (it'll be there regardless if you bought it or not) and scroll left. They should all be there, at least they are for me.
---
I did wonder if it's better to bring a combat shotgun, throw on Enforcer, and then wait until the queen stops fighting before you run in with the gauntlet. Won't help much if the mobs are killing you though.
---
Yeah, I don't recall which one it was in Floor Decor specifically, but it's whatever one lets you scroll to the left when you highlight it. 😉
---
I'd be content if they just organized things by category instead of alphabetically.
---
Yes to both pool tables and casino!  Mini games are cool!
---
Oh hell no.
---
Just play 4.  It has everything and  more.   So much more.
---
So basically GTA
---
I agree, I accidentally scrapped my 3 Minutes in Moscow, had to buy a new one
---
Holy shit I found them. That is the only menu I’ve ever seen that goes left like that. I think actually checked every other tab in there like 10 times and just never went left 🤦‍♂️
---
I regularly buy them when I see them at vendors for this reason.
---
Loaded or unloaded? Not that I'm saying that ammo would make it weigh 10 more pounds, but ammo isn't light.
---
Ill give you 2k
---
It is? It’s just stupid eggs.
---
Next patch you can click on on foundation in mid air for better building. Who care about the false bulldozing we got with the camp that doesnt work well AT ALL. I hate having a grassy bed but hey floating bases all the way right.....
---
Depends on your build. However imo the anti armor is better. The bloodied requires you to have super low hp which is not something you want in PvP. Then the explosive perk is easily negated since most players are using fireproof and dense mods.
---
Need 2 people u give all your junk to your friend he sits there , you make a new character go to him he give u all the stuff and you dump it in your stash . Ezpz
---
it does not, berserker looks only at your DR/ER/RR stats (i run weightless and berserkers damage is reduced)
---
That’s always there.  In the back right? It’s not even in the workshop zone.
---
unloaded, with a mag i think it adds about 1.5-2 lbs
---
You on?
---
Not for me. Whenever I die while overencumbered (and  of course wearing my armor, cause why would it unequip after death) I can only respawn at Vault 76 and at my camp. Has been like that since launch.
---
I can’t tell if they are for or against it with that challenge.
---
Not only that, but they may have already had this planned out and ready to go since who knows how far back? Are they really gonna cancel the work that was already done because of some other problem when all they have to do for the Easter content is press a button?
---
Do they think we (the builders) forgot?
---
I think the ideal sequence is "cripple the queen w enforcer, kill off the ads, wade in and DPS the queen"
---
Easier said than done though. I figure I probably just need to practice like ten times and I'll figure it out. But I want to get the right build first.
---
You mean a group of people that just go out of their way to help others whenever possible?
---
How could you not realize/assume all 6 will be buried behind the death claw/power armor/vault boy mini statues category, and not with the bunny?
---
Anyone selling the mascot head and imposter fit?
---
Erm, so this is my hang-up with that idea.  It's not different teams; rather, it's where Bethesda decides to put its money.  The salary for the cosmetics team vs salary for game design and fixes.  Tis the reason why I loath all of the character customizations like eyebrows, cheek bones, etc.  Funding one team takes away from the other.  Of course, it's a strategic decision about overall sales.....  eh, I'm also a crotchety old PnP player, so my opinion is probably different than most here.
---
Rumbly
---
They fall just short of being enough for every player i think, but there is also cottagesvthat are ruined and have no locks on the doors
---
Yes been having it alot recently, against both npc and players.
---
Other day was running a nuke and all the glowing ones health would drop, then go back up to around 50%, that was pretty frustrating as it happened on most.
---
Last night had a bloatfly completely invulnerable. Another player came up and he could not kill it either.
---
Recently also had a wanted player near me. Poured almost 250 rounds from explosive plasma Gatling with a beam splitter (8 shots with fire rate of near 100) and watched his hp bar go from full to nothing about 5 times at least. Then his hp restore to full like I never hit him.
---
Depends. If you can maintain 1shot status with 1h, go for it- the weapons are lighter and swing much faster. I can, but I run a bloodied build. If you can’t reach 1shot status with 1h... it becomes personal preference.
---
&gt;ezpz
---
Literally the most difficult way to accomplish this. Every other MMORPG has shared bank space to facilitate this exact thing. But this is what you get when you let an incompetent studio make their first MMO style game.
---
I bought a marsupial serum from you a couple weeks ago! 10/10, I'll very likely get more stuff in future haha
---
YES!
---
Why would you shame him?  You're the one who forgot to turn on Pacifist mode in a SBQ fight.  The fault is yours.
---
Oh the possibilities..
---
Awesome! Stop by anytime!!
---
Best thing I've seen all day.
---
oh! I had a thought! Use enforcer on the adds too!
---
Old raider camps, probably.
---
Understandable.  I try to remember that the free egg promo helps drive atomic shop sales, which in turn helps fund code development.
---
Yep!
---
this but unironically
---
Maybe. It's common for the SBQ to get stuck in a permanent hover, and I'm not sure what causes that. It's not the same as the landing-spot-search pattern, where the queen still moves around a bit.
---
Also add supportless ground floor pieces. I want a balcony to not need ridiculous stairs.
---
big al's tends to have a bit in the bar area, thats where i hit my 5 since i also did my biv daily
---
The guy who designed the eggs definitely codes too and is working on fixing the bug. Totally man.
---
Kill roaches makes me think they're pro
---
I am on xbox lol
---
I agree they need to give the Marine Armor something. Maybe make a heavy version of it?
---
There is a few responder ones I think
---
And it's weird, because before when I dumped in 100 hours, I had no crashes. So maybe it's video driver updates? But those should make it more stable... I don't know.
---
Happen to know where to find said paraphanelia?
---
You're out in the wastes gathering supplies, when you spot him off in the distance through your sniper scope. A fellow wanderer, decked in power armor, looting a building. As you're watching him you spy a scorchbeast heading in, and you decide to go that way and offer the wanderer some assistance. It's a tricky fight but you come out victorious, and you decide to stick together for a bit. The wastes offer little in meaningful conversation and you both enjoy the chance to get to know someone. As dusk approaches you decide to head back to his camp and resupply, but by the time you get there it's already dark, and he's looking more handsome by the moment, and so you opt to spend the pitch-black evening sharing a bed with him.
---
You wake up in the morning and the first thing you see is this fucking thing. You promptly shit your pants.
---
I totally forgot about those. I've probably for 50 of those holo tapes.
---
UGH claaaasic men, always using aqua BOY but where's aquaGIRL?!?!!?!????1??1?111?
---
great idea, thank you.
---
Missile turrets to me at least seem to take alot longer to recognize a hostile enemy. Once they do they decimate them, but it can cost alot in just a few seconds. Laser seems to track targets alot better.
---
Lets just hold out till E3. Im hoping they will announce human npcs based on the roadmap.
---
It can be hard to have the courage to talk to random people, takes being vulnerable.
---
I'm down to selling all * and a lot of ** stuff at this point. I have two mules stuffed to the gills with mostly *** gear at this point, waiting for the Purveyor.
---
No work around. They have confirmed they're working on it. Think it's the patch dropping Tuesday.
---
Check all the duplicate posts of this topic. Some have Bethesda responses.
---
Recently also had a wanted player near me. Poured almost 250 rounds from explosive plasma Gatling with a beam splitter (8 shots with fire rate of near 100) and watched his hp bar go from full to nothing about 5 times at least. Then his hp restore to full again like I never hit him.
---
Bethesda community manager said they will fix this issue at next patch. So almost 3 days later.
---
I run a 2h melee/rifleman build now. Melee is a monster and rifleman is meh at least to me.
---
Got a great legendary lmg last nite now I want to put it with my melee. 
---
Hence looking for build ideas.
---
All about the bulk here now myself.
---
I'm a 3 in APA, take it easy on me.
---
The claimable workshops still have it. Like the power stations etc. And it's under Misc
---
You would think that with the number of streamers and people making videos, someone would have actual proof of this happening. Tens of thousands of hours of gameplay footage and not one single incident of this happening. 
---
The most obvious explanation is user error.
---
Same here i finally got my x01 shocks and they won’t attach I can change the paint job though 😳
---
How bout you just stop dropping them? Lol fuck me, demanding that a company cater to your own stupidity? Work? You ever work?
---
Last night she died before I could even touch her. I grabbed two conduits, ran towards her behind the cabin, and she was dead. No legendary. I did finish the mascot outfit at least.
---
I tried the other day and 76 has ruined the Fallout 4 experience. For everything I love in 4 there are 10 things I love more about 76.
---
I've lost calibrated x01 legs twice between logins.
---
I mean it only makes sense since the game literally says it's only beaten by Power Armor.
---
well if youre looking for like a guild type thing using like discord to coordinate dig deeper in these posts/reddit you will see some people posting to recruit players, look for one on your platform you play on.   
---
if youre just looking for a general group of people that have a habit of helping people look up r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Yep.
---
"Let it go, let it go!"
---
Same!. 
---
Then you jump off your roof in power armor and shockwave them all of the shelves..
---
You can build stairs up then down somewhere else, and then you have floors in foundation height
---
You are right as for straight up content. But there is unique locations to build unique camps, collecting/searching for rare plans, doing some of the worthwhile daily's and there is a few other places you can go to "farm", some of these places are even better then WS, just people don't leave WS and don't discover them. Some people like to build up an impressive collection of PA. Though buggy now, there is also pets. Not to mention exploring for the games lore. If you just like to cheese area's for loot/exp though, I am not sure if this kind of game is for you.
---
Well, i drink from the tap and besides a third arm Im doing great.
---
Edit: resident
---
1 laser, 1 missile and 1 spotlight is a good mix ;)
---
I use 2H just for the larger dmg output with all sluggers 3 starred. How's dmg on unarmed?
---
I agree they definitely seem to take a bit to recognize the enemy, even with spotlights. They also seem to take short breaks from firing too.
---
The damage seems abysmal but I haven't built a laser turret yet so I have nothing to compare it to. I would assume that the faster targeting and no breaks in between shots might put it ahead of the missile turret?
---
Just junk it. Legendary merchant comes near the end of May iirc. Still a month to go. You'll find plenty of legendaries in the time between now and then. If you find a god-tier pool cue or something that weighs only 1 pound, you can probably keep that, but just sell off the rest
---
I don't think I've seen one yet. I'm level 130. I feel like they were all he time in Fallout 4, to the point that all of my camps had the weather changing flares to get rid of them because of how annoying they were.
---
You would think that with the number of streamers and people making videos, someone would have actual proof of this happening. Tens of thousands of hours of gameplay footage and not one single incident of this happening.
---
Executioners Radium rifles are great against bloodied build.
---
Can’t tell you how many times those have fucked me up
---
That's the only reason I make them myself, lol.
---
Yeah. You can also just stand outside the event and shoot in
---
Wouldn't an instance where people can go in and collect items then pop back into the server cause stability issues? I have no idea how it all works..
---
Unfortunately I only have room for 1 turret. I'm an avid builder lol
---
Since pvp is a one shot game it’s meta is bloodied with unyielding. Stealth boys for good measure.
---
I'll second laser, I've also noticed better enemy tracking with them, and they also don't send bodies into orbit if they over spam shots.
---
Well, I hope they hear this because people build some amazing camps and really enjoy the camp building aspect. Stair placement is a biggy IMO.
---
Lol nice
---
Yeah. Lot's of people report crashes and freezing, but some (like me) have very little of them. Yes, it should be that we none of them but this is the state and standard of PC gaming industry now days.
---
I'm running i7-8700 3.20GHz, GTX1070 and 16Gb RAM with latest nVidia drivers
---
You would think that with the number of streamers and people making videos, someone would have actual proof of this happening. Tens of thousands of hours of gameplay footage and not one single incident of this happening. All we have are people claiming they are "100% sure they didnt drop it".
---
I get what you're saying and I don't think you're necessarily wrong and no offense but damn do I hate posts like:
---
"X is just going places and shooting stuff"
---
"Y is just grinding for power creep"
---
"Z is just collecting cosmetics"
---
You can replace XYZ with literally thousands of games. It's so reductive that you're basically just making vague complaints and offering no real substantiative point except seeming like you're a little bored with the game. Which is fine, but it's basically a meme at this point.
---
It's not prime, it's scorched killer. But that doesn't really mean much because a prime receiver is superior. Hell, scorched killer is borderline inferior to regular hardened
---
Don't forget vertical half walls too!
---
lol, yeah, but after the patch that made them use less budget it's easier to fit more, i have 3 missile, 2 spots and some heavy shotguns to cover them if the power goes out :)
---
All I can say is the chameleon armor has that sound effect which is a dead give away if you’re trying to get close to someone. The mutation doesn’t. Low weight armor is it’s own reward even without the mutation.
---
It also looks better than combat armor honestly it even has a fusion core backpack on the back.
---
Go back to fanfiction
---
Also theres a tonof concrete bags laying around
---
You dropped this \
---
I thought you'd mostly one-shot them with the DCG unless they were backstabbing you, although I don't do melee so I'm not sure how the timing works there.
---
I run a slightly-rubbish bloodied shotgun build and I normally only bother crippling the scorpions and the mirelurk queens, because everything else dies to a few shells in the face. From what I remember of accidentally running non-PA though, you really want to stay away from the yao guais.
---
I'm almost always over-encumbered, so no fast travel for me, lol. So I was a bit excited to find a level 2 in the area last time I happened to be near the vault. 
---
Managed to get his attention and dropped all the known plans I've been toting around for a while. Hope he picked them up.
---
I tried them they don't work
---
I think I read that it is only at Work Shops. I have wished for the Fast Travel mats back at camp but it does take our camp a while to load so I can see where it might make trouble. If we could chose what area to spawn at around our camp it might could work.
---
There's also the enlightenment on chems challenge.
---
Yep, it's a hard pill for me to swallow.
---
I don't want robots. I want wild things
---
It's generally higher and most Unarmed weapons are Medium speed.  The Meat Hook, in particular, is an oddity that benefits from Gladiator *and* Iron Fist.
---
The way it's balanced out, however, is that you can't use Unarmed weapons in Power Armor.  Which means that if someone launches a nuke at Fissure Site Prime and keeps Drop Site V9 engulfed in radiation, you don't have as many devastating options for contributing to the battle.
---
Tasty shrooms
---
You're gonna want a gamma gun
---
I suppose next you're gonna say you expected less giant robot spiders in the documentary called Wild Wild West.
---
It just needs the helmet and it would look conplete.
---
Add me psn Cama23onte I am level 280
---
PC has the helmet
---
Been seeing it on both NPC and PvP players. Definitely not tied to sentinel assassin armor. Even if you stagger and drain their hp bar it shoots back up. It's some kind of bug for sure.
---
I don't see how it would suck, just don't build a camp at the rear of the house club with 10 turrets. Nobody will think anything bad and some might even think the camp is cool, I know I came across a few. People know the difference and intent. Hell, with all the roaming bots, you don't even need a single turret.
---
The fastest ways are if you time a nuke perfectly or if someone’s running a bloodied death claw gauntlet you can get up to 45k dmg
---
I would say more then that. Those Jet-pack plans are rare and take a while to get if you don't have a solid team to take down a SBQ. Also the T-60 is a late game PA, So you can probably fetch some decent caps/Trades for that. One of my friends has probably done 15-20 SBQ and just recently got a T-45 jet-pack plan.
---
Probably about 1k-1500 maybe 2k at the top end
---
My problem is recently I can’t vats them, they stay nuetral. It’s a nightmare sometimes
---
Have they fixed the explosive robots yet or the mods you can’t equip on more then half the weapons yet?
---
If I am overencumbered while wearing armor or PA, yeah, I would have to respawn at 76.
---
But lately it seems that when I am in PA, not overencumbered, but would be if I weren't wearing anything at all, I would have to respawn at 76 if I died.
---
I just bought the plans on XB for 1k. Don't know how high/low that is to the going rate?
---
Lot less comin' ?
---
I would like to believe so, even theorise they’d be locked away in little bases with a few daily quests and rewards depending on which side you’ve truly chosen and ranking. But right now it’s only speculation and that’s where I’ve put mine for now until more information comes up.
---
No that was fine
---
Just make a commando vats build and crit them. They die in like 20 bullets.
---
I had heard a few times that if you fall in and cannot retrieve your bag, you can go to the edge of the fissure and drop another bag and all the contents of the original bag will appear in the second bag. Not sure if this is true though.
---
Top of monolith elevator, tons of concrete and lead.
---
I know, but they still cause a noticeable loading issue for rendering.
---
The main reason I go to Whitesprings is my CAMP isn't far away, I still do Whitesprings ghoul runs, and because so many people go there I can leave legendaries and ammo I don't need and someone will probably get them. Also, because it's a popular shopping location I've managed to purchase some nice items sold by other players.
---
Caps are not hard to get anyways, I just run up to a low level guy and ask him to kill me. Just make sure nothing rare is in your junk inventory.
---
I'll have to give this a try. Thanks for the tip!
---
No it's not the UI. It is happening now very frequently on NPCs as well. Some outright unkillable. Even had a bloatfly I dropped about 300 rounds on. Another player came up after and tried to kill it but couldn't. It's definitely a bug.
---
Fo76map.com it has all the locations you need....use ...love it.
---
you haven't tried the burrows haven't you? because after i finished i was googling it to see where the dungeon beings or which creatures i'm going to fight.
---
No grief detected
---
Its a multiplayer game in the apocalypse and there is a perk card to better help you destroy players camps. Its part of the game by design.
---
I made it on. I've got a card to run it again.
---
I guess what I'm actually getting at is that "Wild" in this context is referring to the chaotic, lawless nature, as in "Wild West", not literal wild animals.
---
...abandon bog town top floor of the tallest building. Have to access from the roof.....your welcome.
---
The other day, I was walking around a nuked Harper's Ferry when Orange Colored Sky started playing.
---
It was beautiful.
---
That was 370k of just ultracite, he also had 270k of just 3 other ammo types. The fact you weren't banned for having 800k of ammo kind of supports the fact he was banned for duping, like Bethesda stated, and not for having lots of ammo, like he claimed.
---
After i wrote this post, i tried the burrows. Level 75, i didn't found it really challenging
---
Pretty sure it’s just the number of players in the event.
---
Well, you can sell em for
---
L O D S OF E M O N E
---
What's that spell? LOADSAMONEY! (Probably)
---
I did my first one at level 46 or 47.
---
So what mod is on your PA chest? Trying to figure out how to combat the conduit thing. Notices your health didnt drop super quick.
---
I'm happy with it. There are more important issues to deal with.
---
Indeed.
---
There’s a decent amount of content, but a lot to come. The bugs and disconnects have gotten way better but still exist. The base building is a big part of the game. You have to find materials around the world to build a base, and upgrade you materials to attack and defend against mutants and scorched. It’s a very low-grade survival, and often you won’t have to worry too much about food and water. The story and lore is good, but often feels lacking due to no NPC’s. It also has my favorite soundtrack(Ambient and radio) in the series, rivaled with New Vegas. Is it fun? Yes. Would I recommended it? Also yes, but not at full price. I’d say it’s worth more about $30
---
Yeah it's too risky to address adds with the gauntlet, better to keep your head on a swivel and tag everything that comes near you until things calm down.
---
This. Again.
---
All my weapons seem to be doin basically nothing. I unload a clip into prople with my handmade as they just walk up to me and molly wop we. And I seem to be getting 1 shotted by basically everyone.
---
No you can't. Players in events don't take damage from other players.
---
U just can’t imagine how much fun this game is to me.
---
Where's the proof?
---
If you go into borrow alone it nice place
---
Thanks for your contribution
---
Unfortunately, no. :(
---
I’ve got:
---
Imposter sheepsquatch outfit x2 
---
Sheepsquatch mascot head x1
---
Sheepsquatch mascot outfit x1
---
Yes, because the problem is this sub does not do anything about it. All you do is whine about people who complain about it. Every other fallout 76 community is outraged and is filled with negative feedback. This community allows themselves to get stabbed by Bethesda again and again.
---
I'm not convinced that the SBQ has any player-count buffs at all since a few patches back. Had a four-player queen fight (only players on the server), and that was impossible. It used to be easy with one or two players.
---
It definitely works for pve. Just be prepared to not be able to fit in many qol perks. You need all the strength for meaningful damage, not weight reduction.
---
My experience at least
---
yeah should have had a disclaimer that it wasn't about your specific issue and just an observation of gameplay reduction
---
I think you need to work on your reading comprehension skills. 
---

---
Give back my paddle ball bruh
---
Aaaaaah now I get what you mean!! Ok, this is jew for me as well. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Something like that would be sweet. We need more things like this to make even more reason to invite people into our camps.
---
literally have no clue why this isn't a feature from the start. it's included in loads of mmo's
---
I dont think sneaking right oast enemies is what OP is going for here
---
I finished it with a combat knife.
---
How many of the Million subs have you actually read to assume such a statement. Typing "Bethesda is so kewl" in the searchbar and argumenting on this posts is not really valid.
---
I'm sorry you missed your train.  It left about two weeks ago.
---
It never ceases to be amusing how it's *so* obvious to people like you, shouting from on high, demanding that we should deprive ourselves of a game we enjoy based on some hypothetical, greatly exaggerated worst case scenario that will likely never come to pass.  Like there's some infallible logic at work that's lost on people like us.
---
What are they winning?
---
All the event wants to give me is mascot outfits and fedoras :(
---
What's your tag?
---
FYI for today's challenges, it took me a while but I found 4 rad roaches at the shooting club in the toxic valley. Had to server hop to get the 5th for the reward.
---
Not a challenge but nice
---
Given the number of inventory sorting/tagging mods that have been implemented over these many years for BGS games, you'd think they'd have taken the hint by now. 
---
~~Steal~~ er, "borrow", these QoL mods and implement the things into FO76 and future base games. Subheaders within the tab are clear and easy. "Story", "Keys", "Cramburgers", "Carbonated Death", etc.
---
So a difficult enemy is a bug, but if the enemies are too easy then the game is bad. Got it.
---
I know two couples that do this :)
---
And how much for mascot head and imposter outfit
---
Haha, thanks. 🙂
---
I peraonally defend Bethesda bc 
---
1) There are almost no games that have the same feel as ES or FO.
---
2) The games will come out broken most of the time but theyll get it fixed within a month or 2.
---
3) They have a strong connection with the community and most of the things they add are suggestions or ways to improve gameplay
---
 As for things like the repair kits, i dont like them. I see them as a gateway for other p2w types of content. I personally dont see the use of the repair kits as with perks and average scrap runs you can reapir stuff quite easily and not nearly as often. The lunchbox thing will not kill the game like most think it will I doubt it will become p2w like how ESO is. The lunchboxes dont seem to offer great advantage and even if they do, the game is already broken with the pvp. I get instakilled by the tse or aae kids in survival.
---
I agree but I feel like we're beating a dead horse at this point. How much longer must we wait for some worthwhile content...?
---
And ghouls attack us without weapons.. ;)
---
With the account that bought it, let's say you buy it, have your account on ur gf's ps4 and have her activate ur account as primary. Only your account can play f76 on ur ps4 while any account ur gf has on ur ps4 can play any games u own, and they use ur PS plus without extra charge.
---
As a disclaimer, I’m on x-box and I know they have a similar system, but I am not positive where the similarities stop. 
---
For Xbox, my girlfriend have the same set up, we console share, and with my own Xbox set as her Home xbox, as long as she is logged in to her account and online on HER xbox, then me being signed in to my own account on “her home” (mine) Xbox allows me to play any of her games with her. 
---
I’ve always heard its the same way for PS4, so I’d imagine if you guys have different PSNs, it should work.
---
You are buying the game with YOUR account. So no, your girlfriend that doesn't own the game on her account can't play with your game, but thats pretty obvious :x
---
Aquagirls are talking to mutated tentacled river monsters in order to take over Appalachia from the super-mutants.
---
Mascot head is 1.5k
---
Mascot outfit 1.5k 
---
Buy them both is 2.5k
---
Imposter outfit is 6k
---
Psn is: Joseph_Jameson
---
I’ll give you my full build. Give me a bit
---
I don't think that really matters.
---
My point was that even with 30 perception my VATS accuracy is the same as it is with 15 perception. My agility at 30 doesn't make me harder to detect than when I'm at 15 agility, nor does my AP bar replenish faster.
---
As I said the only real benefit as a VATS sniper that I gained was the additional carry weight from strength.
---
He asked what the best armor is......I offered my input on the lack of benefits that I gain from my Unyielding armor.
---
Do you have any input?
---
I tried to join a friend's server and my CAMP couldn't be placed because a troll had a  large platform with 100 stuffed bunnies on it. 🙄
---
I always like to see what is taking my location or how far away it is. Sometimes it blows my mind.
---
Or a server where you get auto disconnected
---
That's the excuse. Some may be user error. But I know for a fact much of it is the game. Have picked up items, examined them then fast traveled to camp to repair a cultist dagger to gift to my brother. Only to find it missing. This without any other stops or activity. Had a All Star legendary sledge go missing when I died while having it equipped. This is only two examples of missing items and I have several more. I do have over 600 hrs play time.
---
You mean to say literally every player uses reddit? Yiu clearly don't know many people irl, do you?
---
I don't think you can do that. It's an online only game, so the second account would need the license and plus as well. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't see it working since both accounts would be fighting for the same spot.
---
What level do you think I need to be? Can it be soloed at 26?
---
I was given an entire set of 1-2* unyielding combat armor while in the tattoo shop on my way to pick up biv’s repeatable(for the first time ever even though it had been weeks since the content had dropped). That other player mentioned that he had gotten a full 3* set so he wouldn’t be needing the 1-2* set anymore. It almost felt like destiny the way it all worked out. Also, at white springs station, I was given marsupial and healing factor, also for free. It’s incredible how nice people are. 
---
That being said, I have helped random players by building them fusion generators and maxed out weapons near their level. I even built a decon unit for someone although I never got one for one myself. 
---
I am more than happy to help out because I have been helped out, and hopefully I(we) can keep the cycle going by doing just that.
---
Cigarette packs work
---
I want it, I don't care that it would break when I jumped off my roof to prove it stops fall damage.
---
It was announced here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bf2ovw/unable_to_craft_or_install_mods_to_armor/
---
Before anyone says it's not an announcement this is how they do it before the patch notes are released during maintenance on Tuesday.
---
He was asking for PvP armour, something to help counter other players ripping him a new one, troubleshooters will only help against robots.  
---
I read his post more of a "what armour will actually help me" sort of way as opposed to being more stealthy, since for stealth surely youd want weightless or chameleon armour
---
Thanks. I did add Revenant but not the chems or Mutant's. I've also added speed and DPS info, but I don't know what slow, medium, fast and very fast translates to. Also I don't know if each melee weapon has its own unique speed value or they are all common like the display. Plus, I might now miss speed enhancing mods all around.
---
Could you check if speed modifiers are multiplicative or additive?
---
I think most would argue that good legendary effects trump a bit of DR/ER.
---
This wouldn't surprise me either.  I've done quite a few SBQ battles lately with a group that just seems to destroy her and it doesn't seem to matter if no one is there or half the server is there, she's consistently dead in under 10 minutes either way.  If there is a buff, it must not be a particularly massive one anymore.
---
"Allows" its more like not raging on about things we dont like. They know our reaction to their implementations and most well writen arguements end up as top post.
---
Any cigarette packs work, just hit up cigarette machines
---
Yes, I did. Also in my camp...but its gone. )-:
---
A random friend would do the trick too if they don’t hop server while you log off and log back in with your alt. But if they log off or crash during the 30 sec while you switch characters, your stuff is gone. I’ve lost some really nice 3 star loot that way.
---
A few days ago I went to harpers fairy (not right spelling ik) and in the cash register next to the vendor bot was at least 40+ plans for ultracite power armor mods, all different with 5 duplicates each, someone just saved me a shit ton of grinding.
---
No worries. Just hope they get this fixed up soon.
---
Not the best flex but ok
---
Really?   
---
So, she has her own Plus account. We have tested out plenty of games that she does not own. With the PS4 that she uses set to my primary, she has been able to play all my games. We just haven't tried playing the same game at the same time, particularly an online game. The only one we've tried is Overwatch, but we both owned that already.
---
Cant tell if you should get your pitchfork or upvote ready?
---
I have a furious explosive prime 50 cal and it does pretty good
---
And people say the legendary drops are shit there, when I went i got at least three legendarys and haven’t gone again, will eventually though
---
Be aware that the drop rates of plans are extremely low. I’ve probably done about a hundred treasure maps. I know 2 pieces of armor.
---
A TSE Lmg is a good weapon for it!
---
How does it differ from nuking Whitesprings?
---
They were found on legendary mobs. I've never bought armor from another player. I may have picked one of them up from a bot vendor, but I don't really remember.
---
No, there's no jet pack or stealth boy mod for ultracite PA. The other torso mod plans can drop from the SBQ though.
---
Haha 😂
---
*laughs in tf2*
---
She has her own plus account, but yeah I'm worried about the online only aspect and if that would be the critical caveat. She has been able to play every game I own that she does not when the PS4 is set to my primary, but we've never tried an online only game, especially at the same time.
---
You can still see others posing while not in photomode.
---
Cough cough after 9 years in development hopefully it was worth the wait cough cough
---
i believe they are setting up the groundwork for an actual sheepsquatch, in my circuit of checking random spawn locations all over the map i have noticed an introduction of new instances, one involving a nest and several dead bodies with quills sticking out of them (marked exactly like the leaked photo of the sheepsquatch) and when you enter the area you hear a higher pitched screech/wail similar to a sloths cry. then within a few seconds of that happening your vision starts going wonky screen blurring in and out.   
---
then there is two others one with a single dead brahmin with around 9 quills sticking out of it and 3 lootable inside, and another with like 4 or 5 dead brahmin covered in quills. both lacking nests, sound, or visual happenings.   
---
seems to me either the real ones been released and is extremely hard to find, or they are leading up to the release of it in the wild to build anticipation/mystery.
---
i think the lying lowe quest fits well with other cryptid type things in our world today, look at the loch ness monster, sightings, blurry photos, accusations of people faking photos and videos..  
---
big foot, people planting fake foot prints, accusations the 70's video footage was faked by a guy in a gorilla costume.   
---
the whole crop circle thing, some believe aliens are causing them, others swear people with boards are making them.  
---
so it kinda fits in with what they have done/released so far of what we would find during an investigation, we have uncovered the conspiracy of one person creating a false decoy/lead, but it doesnt mean the quest is over.
---
Nope, I have a serene pond out back of my house, no garbage anywhere, but I still take rad dmg when collecting it
---
for me just a regular bloodied deathclaw gauntlet gets the job done, i do pretty decent damage with it. a diluted rad-x keeps away the extra rads when close to the queen so i just go with the bloodied build even for the queen
---
It'd somewhat make sense or add some lore to add them somewhere in the enclave bunker and they'd be like "we captured some... vendor bots... they might be useful to you" maybe even unlock em somehow as enclave quests to take over the bots or stuff.
---
Them just standing in whitespring in odd places makes absolutely no sense.
---
No you moron that is not what I’m saying . I’m saying that not everyone uses reddit so therefore if 150,000 people are subscribed to the sub than that means AT LEAST 150,000 play . Reading comprehension is your friend you stupid illiterate sob
---
You missed the point. His question was whether or not Unyielding was the best armor for a VATS sniper.
---
I wasn't suggesting that he wear Troubleshooters. I was pointing out that I don't seen any real benefits from Unyielding as a VATs sniper other than carry weight.
---
Replace Troubleshooters with Assassin's/Bolstering/Vanguard/Mutants. My point remains the same gor all of them.
---
Short answer NO.
---
I'm mainly melee and not a hardcore min/maxer, but my weapon of choice is the Bloodied Power Fist.  That thing will easily do over 1500 damage per hit.  Of course, the trick is surviving being right next to the SBQ without Power Armor.  To deal with the Rads, you need to get your rad resistance up to about 50 or higher.  And even then, I'll sometimes find myself just spontaneously dying, not to her wing attack, but to her "explosive fart."
---
If that is not an option, and I have to use Power Armor, then I use a Bloodied Ski Sword.
---
There are two other utility weapons that come in useful.  The Endangerol Syringer cuts her damage resistance down by 25% and lasts for 2 minutes.  With her DR being what it is, that's considerable.  The Cryolator also freezes her on the ground and makes it easier for melee and cripplers to do their thing.
---
Now, if you're not doing the bloodied thing, look for options like Anti-Armor and Executioner.  Executioner conveys a substantial damage bonus if the target is under 50% HP, and the SBQ is one of the few enemies where you can really appreciate its effects.
---
That's the thing. I think she could play it, but not at the same time without buying it too. There's people saying it works like that, but I don't know, and I would wait until someone confirms it firsthand because I couldn't play Dead by Daylight with my boyfriend at the same time.
---
Xbox, PC, ps4?
---
Add me JOSEY1212, lvl 37
---
I have been seeing a couple of texture issues as of late.  The ground was white when I was in The Mire.
---
Wait the Burrows boss has minions? When I did my walkthrough I killed a bog standard boss assaultron and a single colonel gutsy in the final fight. I came to the burrows loaded for bear and killed fewer ghouls than a standard Whitespring run and about half as many robots as you'd find at RobCo Research. I mean like 8/10 for atmosphere and layout but a weak 4 on challenge. Oh and getting their low rent Bender voice actor to do their low rent Negan voice acting did not help things.
---
Someone just posted that they dropped a nuke and no glowing ones showed up, only normal ghouls.
---
Can anyone test this out once more and if it was only server glitch or has there been a change for nuking Burrows.
---
They need to shut them up, it just reminds you that that are just base bots, no customization at all went into it, as little work  as possible from the dev side :(
---
Yeah I also loaded up with like 2 guns and 5k ammo. Barely had to reload
---
You're missing the whole point of my post. If you're using those weapons regularly, you might as well have the perks for them and the perks make his point untrue.
---
First major update seems to be Wastelanders, so "Winter".
---
There is a lot of assets they can still reuse from F4 IMO so its not like it would cost a lot of time creating new assets. They keep wasting a lot of time on game modes like Survival that people dont really seem to want, trying to get us to recycle the same content with some different PVP rules. 
---
I have a feeling this "Nuclear Winter" will be another survival PVE mode, we'll see though. 
---
They seem to have spent most of that 5 months quashing bugs, shouldve delayed release 6 months to polish

How many hours until this happens
---
Stop, we don't need more grindy shit, we have enough grindy shit.
---
We hope to start at 9 or 10 o’clock est tonight
---
Sorry man coulda worded it better, but I don’t know the time zones so like how many hours roughly
---
I just want a Vault-Tec Bong
---
What do you mean? Like physically see the items? I’m confused. Forgive my lack of knowledge on the subject. 
---
What I miss is something similar, if that’s what you’re talking about. Like displaying my power armor.
---
Furious 50 cal miniguns with prime receivers seem to be really efficient buuut not everyone uses miniguns/melee
---
My go-to weapon used to be a 1* anti-armor hunting rifle with the prime receiver. I know, not the best weapon out there but my headshot critical hits were always good enough to take tiny chunks out of the HP bar. 
---
I kinda stopped doing SBQ so i switched back to a hardened 308 receiver and it's still pretty effective. 
---
I'm not using lever guns for SBQ because they lack that perforating magazine. Sure, some people said that perforating magazines don't work but i noticed the exact opposite. 
---
The SBQ has a lot of armor and those stats scale up with the number of players.... Anti-Armor will always be extremely useful; at least for rifle builds.
---
In 7 or 8 hours
---
Jupp that was it. This "dungeon" they hyped up finished faster than leaving vault 76 -.-
---
Event plan rewards are total RNG game. You can do 100 events and not get a single plan, or do 100 events and get single plan 100 times.
---
Just buy the plan from vendor. Put on the perk and eat some Charisma boosting tablets.
---
If you don't have enough money yet, go scrounge up junk, bulk them and then put on the perk and eat Charisma boosting tablets before selling.
---
Penitentiary is a easy place filled with enemies and after clearing it switch servers and do it again. After few runs you will have so much junk that you can easily buy almost any plan from vendor.
---
I'm still a n00b in this game. 
---
Last night a \~150th level player swung by and was talking to us on area chat. Once we realized what he was attempting to do (communicate), swapped out to area chat to hear what he was saying - which is this very topic. 
---
I for one was not aware of this and am grateful to the information being conveyed instead of having a buddy's camp blasted. We ended up hanging out, chit-chatting amicably and he even took us into my first-ever Uranium Fever event (which is nasty for a rather poorly-geared 40th level non-Power Armor character). 
---
*Coming from 2,800-odd hours in Fallout 4, 76 is a different beast altogether. However, the level scaling of characters' capabilities remains comparable from what I can tell - i.e., those capable of doing just about everything seem to be somewhere between 250th-300th level. Thus I consider my character well within the low-level and smooshy span of game play, and will continue to do so, until about 75th level.* 
---
Taking the advice from last night to heart I looked up recent threads and found this one just a few minutes ago as the most recent and thus germane post. 
---
Please offer such sage advice first, before dropping the wrath of *Archmides* on these CAMPs. Some of us know not what we do until someone else spells it out.
---
Can you imagine how deadly a stalker’s bowie knife will be? Especially with 90% weight reduction? It’s gonna weigh zero omg, I’m so gonna stock up a million of those if i can find them.
---
Oh ok
---
 No
---
Rifle builds are jank. It's not just you. No weight reduction perks. Damage perks don't add jack.  Starting off I would headshot/one shot most enemies. As soon as I hit level 20-25, the damage dropped off. I would head shot something 10 levels lower than me and barely do anything. Melee is basically the only way to go. Level 50 with all-rise I could 3 shot kill level 50 scorchbeast. Sniper rifle, hiding, critical, would do maybe 10% damage. If that.
---
Where is the go-to site for mods these days? In Skyrim I used Nexus Mod Manager... is that still the one to use?
---
Right, and everyone in that regard is right. But I'll pass on light leather bolstering over heavy combat
---
If it worked like that it probably wouldn't ever place you on a server where your camp is occupied.  I assume the way the code works is the game doesn't know until you load in.
---
There are two varieties of door that do open to the left, they're just kind of ugly. It's been a long while since I played, so the only one I remember is that one of the metal security doors does it, but I spend a good 30 minutes playing with all of the doors while the "place any object you haven't unlocked" glitch was active, and found that if you look closely, every door has visible hinges on one side, and with those hinges facing you, the door will open toward you. 
---
(The other door may have been white metal with a bit of rust? Memory's fuzzy, but I remember feeling like I couldn't use it in my build where I needed it because it didn't fit the aesthetic.)
---
Everything in your post applies to both weapons equally. Which means nothing in your post refutes what he is talking about.
---
I understood your post, you apparently don’t understand his/mine/game mechanics.
---
Is there a vendor that sells stabilized flux that I'm not aware of?
---
Yeah, they could just put dividers into the existing list. That would be a huge help.
---
I'd rathers not have my water purifiers running out of power while i'm gone.
---
In addition, this would be another variable that the already unstable servers would have to keep track of.
---
Not really. But soon it will be all good. Unless they push it back.
---
30$? And how many hours have you put into it? If you get 100 hours out of a 50$ game then you are paying a small price of .50$/hr of entertainment . That is a hell of a deal
---
The Nexus, yeah. NMM was just a client to manage mods; the download source is nexusmods.com
---
U my friend, are quite a legend
---
You interested
---
I had this on PC last night.
---
&gt; I can't use my h2h weapon
---
Your what weapon? I'm assuming you meant hand to hand instead of what it's called (unarmed) and at which point I'm going to ask, why the fuck aren't you using martial artist then? It applies to all melee weapons, being unarmed, 1h and 2h. I'm especially flabbergasted by this choice since I'm assuming you're running an unarmed build. It's one of your most important perks in a tree that doesn't offer a lot for your build. You want 15 points in strength regardless because str directly increases damage for melee, so having it maxed makes the most sense, yet I can only see 12 points of must take perks for an unarmed build, the last 3 you can do what you want with. So why on earth wouldn't you have it, **especially** with your play style when you switch back and forth between unarmed and 2h weapons?
---
i had almost expected em to put all the bots in booths in one of the conference rooms and set it up like a convention type thing.   
---
not the here or there way they did.
---
* Build mail box system.
---
* Freely send items to anyone!
---
* To *collect* what is in your mailbox, you must spend Atoms.
---
I cosplay as a product manager.
---
Two shot or bloodied
---
No i havent found one even on my level 85 charecter
---
Your post would be a tiny bit more valid if you wouldn't exaggerate. 
---
The heaviest rifle is the gauss one. It's about 20 pounds.
---
Hunting and lever action are about 16-17 pounds.
---
There are no 50 pounds rifles.
---
Legendary rifles are rare because there are very few rifle variants. Also, if you never got one it doesn't mean they do not exist. And it's RNG anyway...
---
Yes. I do this.
---
"Im only talking about Adventure Mode", never said changing bag drops in survival mode. Its good to keep it in a pvp centered mode but not in a casual one.
---
Yes I get that occasionally
---
I approve
---
I mean, that is the optimal thing to do. You can make weightless armor weigh zero if it's not heavy or sturdy, since the ultra light mod is additive and not percentage-based. But so is heavy/sturdy, so it's going to end up weighing more than the lightweight offset
---
That's pretty cool, maybe even add a new legendary effect into the game to where it does more damage to addicted animals.
---
I was looking at this last night. The Metal almost doubled the defense of the Marine when I upgraded them both.
---
You guys are more than welcome to join us and play with the group join us on discord

---
Right gotcha
---
Thank you, I will take a look. Mods were indispensable for Skyrim for sure.
---
Do you have the new black and red excavator skin on it or just the default yellow one? I’ve found out that they don’t allow you do drop anything that has custom skins on them. This is unacceptable but putting a skin on your prized gear may prevent accidental or glitched dropping of the item. Unfortunately they don’t have skins for most weapons.
---
Congrats?
---
Except you're bad at math I guess? Or perhaps your reading comprehension is low? Maybe you're just stupid. Idk either way, with the right perk (martial artist) his post is meaningless and wrong.
---
For melee, I'd go with a two handed weapon. One with limb damage. For ranged I'd go with a heavy gun. Forget those high damage, low fire rate weapons. Good for the mobs but when the queen lands, bring out the big guns.
---
Bloody is by far the highest damage effect but furious and anti armor are a close second. Also, you don't need an explody gun to kill the queen, but it helps.
---
If you don't have a god roll exploding boot in your ass gun, consider taking a syringer or cryolator or even cryo or pumpkin grenades down to the fight. If you can keep her on the ground and/or make her weaker that will contribute as much as having a crazy badass gun.
---
People that say no are incorrect. Check my comment.
---
With explosive specifically? Probably two shot, since the additional pellet will also explode. Bloodied, junkie's, or berserker's might also work if that's how your character is built
---
I'm looking for a vampire combat shotgun, if anyone has it for sale. Combat has larger ammo capacity, fewer reloads then.
---
Biv and I will share a drink to hobo\_greef's memory...
---
poor bastard.
---
Yeah there could also be card games or pool since we have the pool table
---
Maybe put all weapon weight reductions under one perk and for Endurance stat.
---
Now you have Heavy weapon, melee weapons, pistols, shotguns weight reduction perks and three of those are under single stat.
---
Legendary rifles were not in game at start, but they have been finally added. Just few days ago I got TS hunting rifle 1\*
---
No, but you can make serums with it.
---
I’m farming west tek and white springs but I’d u come you’d have to have a suppressed weapon.
---
I have suppressed weapon :)
---
Ok what’s ur psn?
---
Thanks! I knew I shouldn’t go in there. But I wanted to see what all the hype was about.
---
Also u have a mic?
---
By far and away anti-armor for general use. Bloodied can be better for low health builds. Instigating is also viable.  
---
The reason I say anti-armor is that shotguns have inherently low armor penetration (combat shotguns can be modded to have some, the others don’t have the option).
---
The issue isn't just opening toward or away. For example, I was building a small bedroom on a cliff face with a one tile wide ledge out a side door that circled to the right up to the roof. The door opening inward crowded an already small space, and the door opening outward to the right obstructed the path. So I needed a food that had the hinges on the left and opened outward.
---
It's likely just coming with the future updates.
---
That is correct. To minimize network issues, a majority of the game is loaded client-side. That means your computer loads up the entire game world, and THEN once it's done, it takes in any server-side information (is there a nuke zone, are there any quests for you to get, are there players nearby, is there a CAMP blocking your CAMP, etc). My only issue is that since so much of it is client-side, it should be able to load all of that up just once and it shouldn't take an equally long amount of time to hop into a different server
---
If I happen to stumble across any other BOS plans I'll hit you up. I'm on PC as well.
---
Are you on ps4? I want to kill you some.
---
Have you had the "squad of behemoths" random event yet? Walk in an area and 6 of the buggers walk around the corner. Brown alert!
---
What about a super duper behemoth deathclaw?
---
tommy_n1ghtmare
---
And also I have mic
---
She will regret this.
---
They have been in the game since launch, just cause you didn't get it doesn't mean they didn't exist
---
Needs more cow bell... And pistol anti-armor perks.
---
Awesome man, saint’s work! I accidentally used a radaway when I had swapped out my starched genes perk and lost my marsupial mutation. Ended up getting rid of all my mutations just to start over. This will be a big help next time I play, thanks!
---
The gauss rifle is pretty powerful. You can do a sneak critical build or bloodied. 
---
My friend is a bloodied sniper and one shots most everything although thats most bloodied builds.
---
Rifle weight is a big problem. But I'm a heavy gunner and don't use weight reduction. You can easily run around with 50 pounds of weapons. And still have plenty of inventory space.
---
I’ve been there. Stop by anytime.
---
I do pretty well with my scout rifle build. 
---
I run an Instigating lever with +10 % damage while aiming. 
---
A vampires or furious laser rifle. 
---
And anti armour  .44 pistol. 
---
Only thing I “struggle” to kill are Mirelurk Queens. 
---
Have caps to pay for it
---
Enclave bunker. In the military wing. Search all the desks. I always find tons there
---
I'm 800 lbs over carrying capacity on my main and plan to stay that way until the legendary vendor. 
---
Rip fast traveling.
---
And putting books on shelves, weapons on a weapon rack that sort of thing. Pretty sure that’s what OP means
---
I was genuinely underwhelmed by the Nuka-Cola Plant. After playing Nuka-World, I expected so much more than a random while goose chase for some T-51B exclusive paint.
---
No. Explosive teslas dont arc
---
This is really cool, does this take place in adventure or survival?... you are breaking the first 2 rules though! Lol
---
You broke the first rule.
---
45k?
---
That’s what I thought. Wouldn’t that be super hard to protect? Or is that part of the fun
---
In regards to rollover new egg occurs while you are playing. You would have to exit the game and relaunch it to update the Atom shop listing.
---
Give it to Anthem players :/
---
/s
---
Cannot upvote this enough.
---
Gotta have room to grow in the future...
---
In your experience is it best to hop servers until you get it or wait for the full night in one server?
---
If you've given the weapons to a friend, they have them regardless of the server dying or them logging off.
---
There are so many potential additions for the syringer, it's just a massive waste. You can have drug syringes to buff party members from a distance, or addictol syringes to cure addictions (in both players and enemies), or some ultracite/scorched related syringe. Legendary bloodbug poison works ridiculously fast, we could have a bloodbug poison syringe. We could bottle up diseases like rattle hands for PvP. Hell, maybe dynamite syringes to explode on impact.
---
You talking shit about Fasnacht? Unforgivable
---
Just waiting for my guy to get here, then yes - that is my plan!
---
I hope so.
---
I’d imagine it would be cosmetic only for other players, and only the owner would be able to interact with them but the only details are vague at this point. Another poster linked an older thread with some details and speculation above
---
I've found tons of rifles. Legendary since launch. Where are you farming? Maybe you're out of the level range where the higher tier ones drop.
---
Yes i was thinking dropping the stuff in a trashcan or sack for the transition.
---
Lil column a. Lil column b. Ill do my others like levelling first. If it hasn't come up during then. Ill do some others and then eventually hop. Rn i cbf waiting so I'm hopping as we speak. It's usually one I often get but now I need it, you know Murphy's and shit!
---
I agree with this wholeheartedly. Bethesda pls
---
Love the sentiment and hope to do similar one day when I’m more leveled. As a sniper the marsupial seems to be *practically* mandatory.  once I’m able to get flux I hope we can coordinate. Thank you!
---
What happens in Camp Vegas stays in Camp Vegas.
---
If you’re on Xbox I’ll help you. I also have some 1* legendaries you could have.
---
How many good husband points did it cost you?
---
I carry two rifles even three at times and maxed weight perks and excavator power armor. It all depends on which ammo I made craft that week. But I do understand
---
I would be happy to have a choice on tattoo location other than forehead and neck
---
Same here. 2nd nuke they changed though
---
I can help you out if you don’t have the flux.
---
its lil bit bigger than the radius of the nuke, you can get an idea of the radius by where you get the notification of entering the event area. i vaguely remember with the nuke dropped so that the bunker and shed were outside of the nuke zone of getting the entering the scorched earth event roughly 100 distance away from the shed (on the watoga side) so if radius was 100 distance or so from shed tells me radius that considers you in the event would be roughly 2-300 distance from the border of the nuke on the fissure, or possibly its distance based to the fissure itself and doesnt go from the radius of the nuke.   
---
as others have said though im not sure myself if there is an actual buff goin on there, only thing i can say ive noticed is ive seen recently 5-6 people kill her and almost the full server there with 10-15 of those being sub 50 and event fails or times out. but i have also seen her glitch with 8 people and her stop taking damage altogether from everyone so who knows if that wasnt a factor during the whole server showing up and a bunch of lower levels there.
---
Instigating is great for PvE, AA is great all round. I’ve yet to get my hands on a furious combat shotgun but with the right auto receiver I think it could do well. 
---
 TS is good but the accuracy sucks. Bloodied gives you the highest outright damage if you like the play style.
---
It's really not a big deal. They made it so you take a couple rads when collecting water instead of requiring empty bottles to collect it. It would be way more annoying if they left it the old way.
---
They did change the image. Hindsight says I should've screenshotted it. I've checked that roadmap consistently lol.
---
i felt the same, i group enemies and kite them using the tesla rifle on a rifle build and I can wipe out hordes of the trash mobs like ghouls, scorched and bugs.
---
I’ve seen people make a new character and complete only that quest line and just transfer over the weapons and armour. Seems far too much work but what can you do.
---
I put shush in it and it’s a secure channel
---
"DNAM/Animation Attack Speed" and "MASE" seem to correspond directly for most weapons. Slow = 1.800010, Fast = 0.794453, blank MASE (probably medium) = 1.138894. Very Fast is all over the place though, and the Spear is an odd one out with an animation speed of 1.673343.
---
The 40% Swing Speed legendary has a blank object modification multiplier, like with Hardened, while Martial Artist sets an actor value that's not referenced anywhere in the ESM. Both of these are probably code-only, so you'd need reverse engineering or testing.
---
because
---
No they have not been. They were finally added on January [10th patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7hpeHkKxyM6aMWUCCIkeW6/fallout-76-patch-notes-january-10-2019) 
---
Don't try to be know it all, if you don't have the information.
---
Yeah metal chest is great.
---
yeah they should do I've did it a few times
---
Always thought it should. Berserker stuff just ain't powerful enough for that whole no armor thing. Is ONE armor type too much?
---
The hope that you have to jump through to make something interesting are ridiculous
---
On paper yes, but not always.  
---
'It just works'
---
Adventure we use hunter v hunted and I said shush and this is a secure channel
---
You are what the future of the wastelands needs! I’m actually able to be on for a few minutes. I’ll waddle over to you if you have a few minutes. I’m encumbered ... as usual. Gladly donate whatever else I can.
---
Thank god someone understood lol
---
If you join my server I can travel to you.
---
Explain the bloodied build if you can, haven’t heard of it
---
Yeah there should be a grace period, especially in survival mode. I agree with this.
---
It's a visual glitch, just sell a Bobby Pin or something like that and their caps will pop up.
---
Maybe is a little late, but if you take the event Death Blossoms, which usually spawns north of Northwest of Flatwoods, near Aktos Pharma, you can fight endless hordes of wild wolves there. I managed to get 30+ doggos like that and no I'm only short of 4 dogs to complete that requirement. 
---
As for insects, i take the bridge on new river gorge, that's guaranteed 6 bugs. And you can server hop. Another good spawn location, with several crown bugs which guarantee more spawns is way east, at the Kanawha County Cemetery. There i managed to get at least 15+ bugs
---
There would likely be a way to remove the mutations in the lab but other then that permanent.
---
Excellent! I’m at WS.
---
I farm usually in Great Divide, Mire or Bog. Level 160 now and been playing since Beta.
---
Rifles yes, but Hunting rifles (that are mostly used in sniping build) were not dropping until after January 10th patch.
---
It should have been scrap 4 items for 20 atoms.
---
I tried that, says vendor does not have any caps. I literally tried with every single vendor
---
I see you. Thank you.
---
So Survival mode the random encounter.
---
Saw the quills thing today, and had the wonky vision thing at my camp today as well....  HOping there is a correlation that something new is on the horizon.
---
My run of the burrows was just running. It was already cleared out.
---
Not true. However, she has massive damage resistance while she's in the air, so you're gonna do better damage when she's on the ground. Most veteran queen fighters wait for her to land.
---
I would love that myself. I play ffxiv also and we have so called "Gear set list" so when you change jobs you dont need to equip all itens every time.
---
With perk sets in fo76 would be an optimization speaking of gameplay.
---
I always thought about that and im glad to see othet ppl cares about that too. 
---
Lets keep our fingers crossed to a possible future patch.
---
Cheers.
---
Still haven't fixed the hooded rags that have been bugged since beta, either.
---
Came here to say this,rawly when I hit the cargo bot first it takes off, but if I clean up the vertibirds then it hangs out
---
You got a good one. 
---
I recently got my first legacy, and anti armor explosive cryolator. 
---
I love it.
---
I run this with a mix of support gunner. The thing is you need 6 perks for melee. Incisor and level 1 of  all three gladiator perks (+30% damage) for heavy guns you only need 3 danage perks +30% damage. Stablized, and one gun army. All the other perks are subpar. Reload spead? Meh gatling guns take forever to run out of ammo, using a gatling plasma? Overcharge the core, more time between reloads. 
---
Thats 9 str, 3 int, 3 luck. You'll also want bloody mess because you are splitting your build thus lowering damage. 
---
Thats 9 str, 3 int, 6 luck. Ignore bullet shield and melee speed bonuses until you get the core of your defensive/ utility perks. Like lifegiver fireproof, any mutation perks. For me I got support and medic perks. You don't have to. 
---
Then you need to look at your remaining perks. You can upgrade the heavy guns or damage. Get the melee speed bonus or reload speed if you really want. 
---
You can be both viable in PvP and PvE. Anyone who tells you otherwise just wants to min/max beyond functionality. Sure you'll hit alittle lighter and have a disadvantage in pvp but not enough that skills and tactics can't bridge. 
---
You can't max both but you have to remember not all perks are equal and you can get 30% danage for 3 perks or 60% danage for 9. Bloody mess is core though you need it to keep your damage up.
---
Hahahha ikr.
---
Legendary hunting rifles, other rifles could drop
---
According to the ESM, Junkie's jumps to a massive 2.5x damage multiplier if you stack six addictions. I'm not even sure if there \*are\* six different addictions though.
---
And I'd toss furious in that mix as well... provided you're using a combat shotgun.
---
Most people refer to this as a "deck swap" or a "loadout" and it has been suggested many, many times since BETA.  Search for "deck" or "loadout" in this subreddit and you'll find many discussions.
---
Bethesda has shown no indication that they intend to implement it.
---
This post- karma farm
---
Maybe people aren't noticing until it's too late? Some people are reporting logging out one day and coming back to their items gone. That's impossible to record. Of course there will be people making mistakes, but considering the uptick in these complaints lately it needs to be looked into instead of automatically assuming people are lying. How are people suppose to record and have evidence of things they don't have anymore? Not exactly an easy thing to prove.
---
Forget the radstorm. Stopping to take a picture in the midst of any PVP scenario is asinine in itself.  
---
Let me just start a fight with this guy and go wait don't shoot, but first lemme take a selfie  
---
Get the fuck outta here.
---
Everything
---
Bethesda should just let us craft it to allow us to save some stash space. Also change that dress to an outfit.
---
That would be awesome thanks. I’ll pm you my gamertag
---
You'd need to buy one from someone or a vendor that has one. When I did the questline I thought they were working on a way to make more but I couldn't find it anymore.
---
oh, how incredibly ironic. 
---
Bad at math? Let's do a little math shall we?
---
Let's find the ratio between two numbers. How about 7lbs and 20lbs. How much more is 20lbs?
---
To find that, we divide 20 by 7. We get a result of 2.86 (rounded), which means 20lbs is 286% of 7.
---
What happens when you multiple a number by a percentage? Let's take our 7lbs again. Now let's get 40% of that. To do that, we multiply it by .4. What do we have? 2.8
---
Let's do the same with our 20lbs. Multiply by .4, we get 8.
---
Now let's find the ratio between these two new numbers!
---
8 divided by 2.8 is... well would you look at that, 2.86! Which means 8 is 286% of 2.8!
---
Well would you look at that, your point in your second paragraph about martial artist is completely meaningless and wrong, because again, IT STILL APPLIES FUCKING EQUALLY. 
---
Go back to school, kid. I'd suggest three subjects: Reading comprehension, logic, and math.
---
Did you sell 1400 worth of stuff yesterday?
---
Awhile ago, several months, I was maybe a level 35 patrolling around Clarksburg, looting the gun club and the power armor set in town.  As a player I was kinda coming into my own, confident and perhaps a little brash.   More on that in a bit.   Anyway Im melee killing a snallygaster Only to notice bright flashes all around me........another player hosing down said beast with a perfect storm.  We finish killing and wave to one another not having mics.  He’s like a 12-15 I think.  So me and this guy, we hit it off.   He’s like little Beaver to my Wally, ya know?   He’s so proud of his special perfect storm.  It made me really happy.  We kill many a    scorched and head back to Clarksburg.    Then it happened.  My usual scorched spawn is now bots, lots of them.....and an Assaultron.....my level 35 worst f’ing  nightmare.  My confidence is gone and I’m panicking; it’s brown pants time. 
---
My gf and I were listening to Mazzy Star as I was playing, and this really beautiful song called ‘Look on down from the bridge’ is playing softly; it’s all I can hear.  When I see the Assaultron my little buddy is around a corner and oblivious to our impending doom.  
---
Well,I throw a grenade and unass the area with tail betwixt my legs.   I look back briefly to see little Beaver round the corner and catch an tractor trailer load of hellish red laser beam death right in the face.  Hope Sandoval is cooing into my ear as my little pal is melting away into oblivion.   Look on down from the bridge.....from heaven.....little Beaver.  Sorry brah.
---
I appreciate the lesson, I sat for an least 5 minutes trying to think of the proper term but settled on the dinky phrase "quick select menu" haha.
---
You get adrenal reaction, nerd rage, bloody mess, damage perks, serendipity(for defense) and unyielding armor, and a bloodied weapon. 
---
You run around at 40-20% hp with rads taking up the rest of the area. You can easily get into the hundreds of damage and depending upon the weapon over 1000.
---
Seriously. I have to use so many "quality of life" type perks just to ease the burden of gathering, crafting, repairing, and cooking. I don't need another thing to deal with.
---
That's intended it was like this 4 too.
---
When my wife and I got married she knew the one game that I played was Fallout. Just a couple weeks ago she got me this shirt.
---
https://shirt.woot.com/offers/sure-you-can?ref=cnt_ctlg_dgn_2
---
Shit, im seeing a lot of people saying this too.
---
I have the paint, its my fav, but I haven't noticed a difference.
---
I'd test it, but don't have a control group. Aka no extra X-01
---
Then you've bought them all out. All the vendors share a cap pool, you'll need to wait for them to reset.
---
Fair enough
---
The Atom team is a different set of folks as I understand it.
---
I sent this to bethesda  
---
[https://youtu.be/bu-2yD0XO\_E](https://youtu.be/bu-2yD0XO_E)
---
Whaaaaat? Maybe try and file a Ticket on that Bethesda Help page (I dunno too much about submitting Tickets, never have done one) or maybe restart your PC/console? Very odd how it's just that specific egg gone.. Well I do hope it comes back to you!
---
Very interested
---
My favorite is when the trade UI closes for no reason.
---
That’s beautiful! She got me FO4 as soon as it came out because she knew I loved it. But she saw all the bad press about this one so she refused for the longest time.
---
Classic answer: 
---
Bloodied heated super sledge or fully upgraded bloodied sledge with all melee related perks, blocker, adrenaline and fury (There are others perks/aid items that can boost even more but these are the easy essentials). PA with emergency protocols. You melt the queen while also tanking it. You can literally solo it even when there's a large group of players for the event. Just make sure to block when you can if you want to save up on healing items and always go for enemies that are close to proc adrenaline. Also, try to abuse heavy attacks as sometimes the server does not deplete your AP in time and so you can heavy attack more than usual. If the queen flies, just chill. It will eventually land.
---
Weightless armor shouldn't be a primary effect. Problem solved.
---
There's no reason to carry around bulk? Then why the hell am I carrying 50 bulk steel and using pack rat everytime I need to fast travel? Because the stash size is too small, and we're literally getting more unique legendaries thrown at us each week. 
---
There's several reasons for carrying around bulk, but there's no reason Bethesda should be repeatedly introducing bugs into their game, and it absolutely should not be the player/consumer's job to work around these bugs for enjoyment.
---
I pre-ordered the game for PS4 as soon as it was available.  Talked my husband into buying a second PS4 and game.  Now we spend lots of evenings roaming around West Virginia together and we love it.  I also reconnected with a great friend and met his lady who is now like a sister to me.  We play as a group constantly.  Will your wife play with you?  It's so much fun!
---
That was first place that came to mind for me as well.
---
WTF?! 45K?!
---
I didn’t know I needed this until just now!!
---
You need a keycard that’s what you need.
---
I wish we could measure this
---
Get a Bloodied weapon and Adrenal Reaction mutation, plus Nerd Rage if you're hardcore. Stack damage reduction perks (Sentinel armor is ideal, but expensive), or don't get hit. Run around with low HP and one-shot everything. Best combined with stealth and/or VATS crits.
---
All you need is a nuclear keycard. You can just type in the code you find online
---
Unfortunately no, but we have plenty of other games to play together.
---
No it's not. If that were the case literally all the outfits would also remove your armor. It's a bug due to the fact that it was never changed like all the other "outfits". Bethesda has even addressed it as a bug.
---
Well we will start at 9 or 10 o’clock est I’m on now and I can answer any questions
---
Standing still and Hopping is stupid. I kill people that do that so fast.
---
I just logged on, I havent sold anything yet
---
I liked how they had to go to the front to plug it in so it can open up in the back.
---
I did not, I actually bought stuff before logging out and the vendor still had caps
---
South of the hemlock holes golf building there are a few that spawn
---
Vendors have a 20 hour reset time.
---
you claimed a workshop that negates everything.
---
I knew of this issue back when I played daily but didn't waste plastic cos I always remembered. Now I'm popping on maybe twice a week and forget literally every time I bulk. 
---
This week I was in Watoga train station, bulked up some stuff for the vendor bot, and on my walk across the room got distracted by looting. The luggage and dead bots loaded me up enough that I was encumbered, so reflexively I pulled back to that damn tinker station and scrapped all. God Im dumb!
---
Aquaboy was one of my random perk cards I got from a level milestone pack. Very useful. It doesn't make sense we can swim in irradiated water freely yet collecting water from a water pump still gives us rads.
---
Lol honestly made me laugh more that it was taken as a normal comment and not a reference to anything
---
Well thats what it looks like when you decide to do a game without human(oid) npcs in order to be consistent with a weak story.  Would have been a lot more fun if this game had such colourful personalities like Tinker Tom, Sheffield, Nick Valentine, Cait,... instead of all these Protectrons and Mr. handys. The only one that stands out is Rose. I hope that they will atleast add some more sidequests for her.
---
Just got it. With 2 mins left and no one was even doing it. So no way I could complete it in time lmao. But i got 20 bio fluid at least lol
---
Facts!
---
Good job. Very nice. Thanks for sharing.
---
You absolutely can do that as long as you have your acct on her ps4 and have it set to be the home ps4. Same works with xbone.
---
They didn't claim your workshop. They just started and backed out. It puts them in perma-pvp with the owner. You don't loose it when you die either. So they can keep killing you over and over and over again and each time take some caps from you. It sucks.
---
After drinking it of course lol
---
All very interesting. I have a full set, and then some of cameleon, thats all 3 star. Id like to play around with it. Just not sure how it use it to its full potential
---
I use a hybrid build. You need to set up your core build first. For damage you'll want 3 melee perks 1 star, 3 incisor for the armor pen, 3 gunner 1 star perks. One gun army, stabilized , and bloody mess. 
---
Its 9str, 3int, 6luk as a core build. That leaves you plenty of wiggle room for more builds. I built a support gunner with supressor and tenderizer, and team medic. Got first aid. And picked up lifegiver and fireproof. 
---
But if you're going more offensive then you can easily pick up 6 more offensive strength perks if you want better melee speed or damage. 
---
Twisted muscle works well since heavy guns don't need accuracy in vats. Or in general. Class freak can mitigate the debuff pretty well and stablized accuracy bonus completely eclipses the penalty. 
---
The biggest problem is you won't be able to fit in many carry weight perks. Which is why I run one handed for the lighter weapon weight. But if you're going two handed you'll want weight reduced weapons as legendary effects.
---
If you want something, you aren’t being forced into it. 
---
Definition of forced: “obtained or imposed by coercion or physical power.”
---
No coercion because it’s not with threats. No physical power because you are in another location from the company.
---
You can just take his word for it, if you don't believe him just google, it's super easy to confirm
---
Sounds like a bug. A gun should either be a pistol or a rifle, depending on the stock.
---
Had my 50 cal TSE disappear last night while swapping perks for it before the sbq fight.
---
Dropped a piece of junk to respawn my bag on me. There it was
---
I would say your endurance and perception are way too high. Its better to evenly distribute those points into Luck, Agility, and another stat
---
RifleGaming and his crew found two new secret quests, first one showcased rewards a mounted wendigo 'head' mount. If you go to the Southern Belle Motel in the Mire region, and find a new C.H. Monthly to read. You'll pick up the new That Sinking Feeling quest.
---
Video if you need the evidence or guide:

---
Gaming with partners is the best, good to hear!
---
Nuka Quantum Mirelurks as the Baddies. Take Glowing Mirelurks and just change the color to blue instead of green. Done.
---
It takes 20ish hours to reset
---
Yeah, I thought about that, but what I was looking for was maximum damage without VATS and no compromises on either weapon...
---
Yes it's quite common knowledge for Rifle users, but this also applies to Bolt action and normal pipe rifles! If you have a Auto Pipe rifle that can also use the Commando and Guerrilla perks, but it's best to watch out for legendary Pipe guns and Bolt-action Pipe pistols since they can drop legendary(I used to have a Exploding Exterminators pipe rifle(sold it) but now I have a bloodied Pipe Bolt-Action, it can just one hit K.O enemies if I run a bloodied build), but sadly not Pipe revolvers.
---
Hmm from what I understood it was always sort of a "hardmode" thing in fallout 4 so did not think it was a bug. Haven't seen any responses about it being a bug or not actually. It was just always like this with rags in a fallout game.
---
FO76 already has instancing. When you enter a building, and you get a short loading screen, what do you think happens?
---
There is plenty of grind without this. No thanks!
---
Sure why not
---
I want to know if there will be one under Huntersville there's a very obvious set of stairs leading underground but the door doesn't work.
---
I dont pvp this is my build this far, I'm lvl 145.
---

---
Rest in peace, Hobo_Greef. You have been witnessed.
---
They did back in patch 5.
---
This is intentional and only works on the pipe revolver and bolt action.
---
I wanted a good build for a gatling and the 4 barreled rifle(cant remember the name) with no serious compromises, and be power armor friendly
---
Found a group that did it in 2 min
---
 I was in awe
---
I know you are talking about Adventure mode, odd you felt the need to state that again.
---
I am stating that i do not want to see that mechanic changed and telling people to just go to Survival is incredibly short sighted, because that game mode is nothing like the original Adventure mode.
---
I have an AAE combat shotgun and with a few +dmg perks and enforcer that thing melts things like crazy. I like AA best as it's universal.
---
Vampire explosive to stop using stimpacks.
---
I also run T51 with reactive plates.
---
No. Removal of those small, pointless things helps the server stability in the long run.
---
Yeah, man. It was like that with literally everything not considered an "underarmor" in 4. When they changed that stuff over to be outfits that went "over" your armor in 76, they just basically forgot to change the code for the hooded rags to go along with the new "outfit" system. Which sucks, because I really would like to use them. Lol
---
Is that a troll?
---
Or is that the high quality fo76 content that we've always needed to see?
---
I nuked about an hour ago and at first only came across dead glowing ghouls. Took about 20mins for the animated ones you turn up. Saw about three one star ghouls in total. Most were none legendary. Bit of a waste of time.
---
I don't know why you were down voted, I tend to agree. But I'll take what I can get at this point. =P
---
Not if you're a stealth character :^ ) Makes it possible to clear an entire solo with no damage taken.
---
Be sure to check the ice machine outside the Whitespring club house and the blue suitcase at the train station when you remember. Lots of us drop excess legendary items and consumables in both all the time.
---
I'm migrating toward a rifle build I think, but right now the ones I craft are better than what I've found. I made a pipe revolver rifle as one standard default weapon, and a hunting rifle for my sniper rifle (I'm a sneaker mostly). But I may have to look into a pipe bolt action instead of the hunting rifle if it uses both perk cards.
---
This is fun. =P
---
Wonder how u gonna keep ammo chems and good without weight reduce perks
---
That refractor probably isn't useful if you're in power armor. I'd swap out the perception points and get class freak higher. Max it out idealy. The lock and load perk is really bad in general, Id get more bear arms or martial artist.
---
Did you sell stuff yesterday?
---
Exactly the two I want. =) 
---
Wish I could change the title to be more accurate. Thanks for the info.
---
Nice, I wish my base was near as nice... 😅
---
Ive seen so many things about this that i need to see for myself before i trust anyone
---
Definitely anyone who is in my CAMP location is automatically a troll.
---
Does this apply to laser weapons?
---
But... he does...
---
Inb4 we get something useless from the eggs and everyone riot.
---
Then say that lmao
---
Then shouldn't all platforms have it?
---
r/unexpectedthanos
---
Yeah, but I have alot of points in strength so I think I should be fine
---
This is exactly my build. You shouldn't run both at the same time though (not efficient/wasted potential).  I only switch to heavy build in events with SBs or if I'm bored. Melee for everything else. Both are "broken". If you get your hands on a bloodied gatling/minigun/50 Cal, all events in the game (except imposter and SBQ) become very easy. If you get your hands on a bloodied two handed weapon, now you can tank with emergency protocols PA and melt the queen with the appropriate perks and aid items. In terms of damage, unarmed bloodied weapons are the best but since you can't equip with PA, it's impossible to tank against the queen. Unarmed is the most fun however. Pair that with marsupial and speed daemon and you become one punch man.
---
Should being the key word
---
Well the server has to load first before the game can realize that you camp spot is occupied or not.
---
Heck, i'm usually over the weight limit, no weight perks, X-01, no calibrated shocks... i have to struggle with 205 weight limit. Always carrying a bunch of rifles.
---
I got over my encumbrance status by simply having stupidly high AP regeneration.
---
Would be nice but if they just derpily follow me around like in ESO not sure I would really want it all that much. Only if they could freerange like Dogmeat imo (doesn't have to be a combat pet, just needs the free movement).
---
I don't think it's ever been confirmed as intentional. Just because it hasn't been fixed yet, doesn't mean it isn't a bug; might just not be high on the priority list.
---
Why buy them?
---
yeah i've had that but the new bug that the server crashes the last few times i tryed fighting her
---
So first...no. Just no, absolutely not, fuck no hell no.   
---
Second, even if they were crazy enough to take this idea and implement it, everyone runs fusion generators, which don't require fuel anyway, or windmills, which, again, don't require fuel.   
---
All this would be is a road block for low level players, for absolutely zero reason.
---
Spawn rates aren't has consistent but I feel like the burrows actually has a higher concentration of ghouls since it's not as spread out
---
I have not seen the event after I did mine and I'm only lvl 30 so it's hard to do..
---
Nukacrypt.com/solved
---
The armor piece related? It isn’t very good tbh lol
---
I don’t know what’s up with your character and perk setup 
---
I don’t take rad damage from unfiltered dirty water.
---
i would love it if they would add in weight reduction for rifles i have to go for armor with weight reduction to compensate while others can equip a card or card hey have also has weight reduction a part of it and can use armor without weight reduction and carry 10 guns to every 1 rifle i have to carry. 
---
perception build so im limited by strength so low carry weight and 40-50 of its taken up by 3 rifles. by time armors added in and aid i have like 30-40 lbs i am free to pick stuff up with.
---
It was obtained through the dev room and the market for it exploded. So they are letting the PC players keep it.
---
I think this would be a great way to introduce nukalurks.
---
i have found some when was a low lvl around the map, later i was farming in the cristal cave (Taggerdy corpse) to get the plan to craft it myself but never get the plans (after 8-10 helmets scraped) After the survival beta patch i havent found any
---
:) It kinda reminds me of the time when gatling guns were getting a 30% fire rate boost from martial artist perk. People were saying "it makes sense, your toon is manually cranking the gatling and the perk boosts your arm movement speed". Everyone bd their mother were using that perk. Then Bethesda nope'd it - "it's a bug" 😂
---
How much are you going to spend on them though? At level 30 you can’t have *that* many caps and the event will surely pop up eventually
---
Oh that would be cool, like give commands on how close it should stay to you.
---
Serious he should have yelled witness me while wearing the silver paint excavator armor
---
*Laughs in nationalism*
---
You can't buy X-01 plans, only mods. There is a minuscule chance that the jetpack mod would appear. Expect to server hop around 50 times to see it. Don't waste your time right now though since you can't install mods.
---
man, you are good at telling stories...
---
Are you on pc? If so there’s a mod on nexus that adds exactly this. It’s safe, I believe. Bethesda supports modding.
---
Is there any ETA for sheepsquatch part 2?
---
Thats.... not how that calculation works lol.
---
I have like 5,6k caps and hopefully but so far nothing.
---
That's actually a pretty well made build, though I'd say its best that you don't have perks like Hacker and Pick lock on all the times, since they can be swapped out and that extra space is can be used for some other perk cards. One thigh I would mention is maybe invest into some (more) points into endurance and maybe at least get Fireproof Rank 3, at that Rank it turns scorchbeasts Sonic attacks into tickle damage and makes explosives coming at you less dangerous. That or some more into Agility for greater sneak attack multipliers, since it'll effect both your Heavy guns and Rifles until you've been spotted.
---
Me too! Chest / arms would be great
---
thank you!
---
Looks pretty cozy.....and then there's "eat people"
---
I can 2shot SB while they're flying with my VATS sniper. Just sayin'.
---
All my armor pieces are weightless and modded to practically zero weight. It helps with power armor and also keeps me safe while I craft or repair items.
---
TY :)
---
with practice you can make something pretty! i try to work small because i love little tiny cozy homes (and its a cheat, cause' less room to decorate and fill! bwahaha.)
---
Sometimes I try to help but not act like a friggin stalker. The times i did help by crafting heavy leather armor, machetes, axes, underarmors... for lvl 5ishes they turned out to be alts with high lvl characters. So the best I can help is joining events but let the others grind xp. Xp grind used to be easier/faster, 3 star legendarys dropped way better, back in November and December 2018. Fo76 rewards sucks now and i feel bad for new players.
---
Thx, I'll consider it, dont know everything yet though
---
Sure, we can trade. You can have the useless weight reduction perk that pistols get and we can have the armor penetration.
---
Had my camp griefed for the first time last week. The guy knocked down quite a bit of it. I managed to sneak up on him and nearly one-shotted him with my trusty TS lever action. He ran away like a little bitch...
---
I was thinking this was going to cost a fortune to repair, as I’m at max budget. But going to my CAMP mini-bench and doing a “repair all...” cost me less than 40 total scrap to fix everything; I’ve used more scrap to craft a gauss rifle.
---
So after seeing how trivial it is to repair my camp [at least for me], I’m perfectly fine if anyone was to mess with my camp.  As noted by the OP, it can be fun to see the griefer’s reaction when you show up and “roll out the welcome mat”.
---
if youre still on looking for people to tag along with i get home around 830 pm est, find me and you can tag along with me for xp. psn: Silune
---
There's a bunch of armor pieces
---
I also remember this experimental weapon. But i've never used it
---
Check to see if you have the card, first. If you didn't trigger the event, you should still have it. 
---
I can't say as to whether or not you have to be in a team, I've only tried it in a team, so I don't know how it works solo. 
---
You can join in on every one you see. I've done around a dozen, and only started it once (where I died and my game crashed, and I barely made it back before the event was done ugh). I actually only started it because I realized I still had my card, and thought I might as well. Honestly it's better to get in halfway through on a server were other people are there and know what they're doing. Trying to do it yourself from the beginning is way harder.
---
I'm still considering for the reason I like having hacker and picklock on at all times, it's quite convenient.
---
More flux
---
Thx for the tip!!
---
Definitely, but also you may want to just look into a Assault rifle or Handmade or Pipe pistol rifle, just for its rate of fire, because when you have like 7 ghouls charging at you, a Hunting rifle/pipe bolt action isn't quick enough to pick all of them off before they hit you XD.
---
I main a Rifle build which I'm slowly turning into a fusion build with Heavy/Shotgun, because sometimes I need some serious offence to get out of tricky situations!
---
That would be nice but in the meantime there are some other options. Ultralight armor is a thing and provides more AP. There's also weightless armor and the strong back perk. Anything else I just use my power armor with calibrated shocks for the heavy lifting.
---
Oh hell yeah. Got it done. Dude was doing it. Had most of them. And i got the last 4 in with 12 seconds to spare!
---
Anythings better than adding a quest and calling it a dungeon.......
---
Thanks! Never made a post like this before
---
Is two shot explosive still best?
---
Got a pistol build character as well noticed lack of armor pen on it.. im more less salty about a minigun able to weigh like 2lbs while im dealin with a 20lb handmade or 15 lb lever.
---
I read this post few hours ago and was wondering how big issue this really is...and perhaps about 15mins ago my legendary shotgun disappeared by itself. Not exactly sure at which moment since I was server hopping while buying mutation serums. Luckily the legendary shotgun wasn't super good but still fucking annoying to craft a new one which will be worse than that.
---
It's all he had there, A huge foundation platform with bunnies on it. An egg in the mix. And a stash.
---
do people accept caps for that sort of stuff?
---
I have all heavy gunner perks and i use adrenaline perk aswell. Then choose perks based on what u use for armor, PA or non PA... Also i have the perk that increases the chance to cripple an enemy (luck)
---
Seriously tired of seeing it EVERY DAMN DAY
---
That's the greatest shirt.
---
I've got over a hundred pounds in my stash that's just books and bobbleheads, so the sooner it gets here the better :)
---
I currently have a combat shotgun for close quarters, but it still only has a magazine capacity of eight. I need more for those ghoul swarms, I'm still figuring that out. I've only seen one homemade in the game so far, and haven't seen an assault rifle yet. I'm only level 28. =P
---
Is hobo_greef me tho cuz I’ve definitely done that. I just want to burn some ammo with the big bois ☹️
---
Do a full power off by holding in your power button till it shuts down then restart
---
Delete the local game files and do a hard reset to delete the cache. Worked for me.
---
I use a TSE gatling gun but a furious minigun is pretty decent aswell.  I prefer the gatling gun because it doesnt consumes much ammo
---
That is a good question. I'm curious about that too. Perhaps someone knows and can answer. I haven't done anything with laser weapons.
---
Not on reddit, no. Here it's mostly trade for something in the same damage class but different category. You can however find groups on Facebook that might have people offering them for caps (usually an auction). But expect to pay a lot.
---
Laser weapons would whoop ass
---
Well if so I hope they do fix it because it's one of the better drifter kind of outfits in my opinion. I did notice when viewing it in stash and inspect function it would have the stat display of a underarmor or PA hazmat suit sometimes. Of course there were no actual stats.  Maybe that's also a sign of it being bugged
---
Same, and it does alot of damage per single shot and the 5mm ammo is really easy to craft
---
What’s the second secret quest?
---
That really sucks, so it was like when you logged off it was still there but when you log back in the next day it was gone?
---
Ahh. Yeah scorched receiver is sucky, it does way less damage compared to hardened and the extra damage it does to scorched probably just evens it out.
---
ah fair enough :/
---
=/ I could not get it to load.
---
Even an animation idle thing like the musical instruments would be cool. Have your character shoot pool or throw darts while you get a drink, come back to a perception buff
---
That be enough for me.
---
Oh okay so we just have to wait for it to come to consoles basically.
---
I noticed a new player lvl 1 at Vault 76 yesterday and I had some lol 1 leather armor on my person, so I fast traveled and waited for them outside the vault. When she emerged, she had a nice brown bag of some chest armor, a commie whacker, a few diluted radaways and stims, and a snack of pork n beans, nuka cherry and fancy lad cakes. Hope it was a nice welcome into the wasteland.
---
great fuckin movie btw
---
That's pretty genius
---
I’ll have to wait until my debuff ends but I’ll drop another
---
Anyone lost PA pieces with skins from atom store? The skins actually prevent accidental drop or sale of the parts.
---
i laughed.
---
I'm late to the party, but i just got N aae handmade. I'm not fully loaded out for commando perk and it tears through everyone in 3-4 hits, 1 or 2 with a crit.
---
Any time, you just name the place and we will meet at high noon.
---
What do you mean by this?
---
I craft my own soap. The government wants you to use their blue soap to brainwash you.
---
I ended up watching the whole thing just to see how he did. It took about 50mins+ to clear out the area and he died once at the start, however most of the place had been cleared out prior to him going in there. That isn't to say he didn't kill plenty of level 62 ghouls as I think it was well over 25. After awhile the area did spawn enemies at his level. You would see level 15-30 ghouls and the robots scaled from level 14-30 with the assaultron at the end scaling up to 36. Some of the things I noticed is that he does have a decent amount of game knowledge with how to position himself to only fight 1 enemy at a time with a few times having a great position where the enemies couldn't hit him at all. Along with that I don't think I have seen a low level have even a partial set of raider armor at level 15 as he was missing a helmet and leg. I still gotta give him props for going through with this. But in the end this definitely seems to be geared towards the casual audience and the "challenge" that was spoken of by Bethesda is meant for them. Which is pretty disappointing. After going in there myself plenty of times I have seen people in the 30-90+ level range go down to both the ghouls and robots so it does come down to "skill". Any casual player will have a rough time with this if it is scaled up to max level but for the average player and above it will be a walk in the park.
---
maybe they could help not damage but like a baby scorchbeast or any flying beast that can tag different things in an area depending what you tell it to look for. or like a pick up pet that loots an area, like you tell it your looking for steel and it brings back the things that have steel in the components. or the taming we have now could get deeper like a pet mole-rat kept at your base could make your crops grow faster from tilled soil i could go on and on.
---
Its not a dungeon.. its a quest. 🤦‍♀️
---
Maybe. But then all the effort to limit players stash and carry weight make little sense, as those are indirect ways to target the real problem. Myself as an example, I put all my notes in my stash, and they are weightless.
---
what *is* the purpose of the nuka plant? i havent been a long time player (lvl 80), but i havent came across a mission that sends me there. not much to loot. seems too detailed and laid out to just be landscaping. the world of fallout and nuka cola is too intermingled for a fallout game to just have *nothing* happen at one of its plants. even sunset sarsparilla had a whole questline, and thats the mojave's *2nd* favorite soda!
---
Thank you. This just the proof I've needed
---
I can't really agree with you for one simple reason...it  makes sense. Every faction has a vendor in a well patrolled, well guarded central location which is, objectively, neutral. 
---
From a non-lore reason, it's fucking handy being able to buy every purchasable plan in the game from one central location.
---
Does the game not start you out in pacifist mode? I’m level 47 now and just yesterday shot someone while fighting SBQ. I’ve never touched the game settings before, but while I was unloading clips into the air, a dude jumped on top of me and I shot him up, then he killed me for the 100 cap bounty (fair ‘nuff- I just put my gun away and took it). Super annoying trying to figure out where in the settings to turn off PvP in the middle of a nuke zone 😑
---
hooooly shit. Thanks.
---
Ohhh okay, well keep scrapping combat shotgun when you find them and you may get the Drum magazine&gt; I'm like level 232 (Mr no life I am) and I have a combat shotgun with a 16 mag capacity (Well it's 32 because of the Quad legendary prefix).
---
But yeah Sooner or later you'll find a lot of assault rifles and yeah Handmades are pretty rare, but hell are they worth it!
---
if you played your cards right you could’a gotten it for free
---
e a t     p e op l e
---
You can, it just takes a lot of work. I won’t try to type out the instructions but check for it on YouTube!
---
The adrenaline perks adds more damage when fighting mobs for example at west tec.   Using a TSE gatling at white springs can be more difficult when ghouls get too close.. I  use a DCG there mostly. Its good to have a mixed build strenght: is 9 points for heave gunner,  3 points for barbarian and 3 points for unarmed,  perception is 3 points for killing glowing enemies, endurance is 5 points for ironclad. Charisma is 3 points for hard bargain, intelligence is 5 points for gunsmith and 5 points for demolition expert, agility is 3 points for white knight, 3 points for evasive and 5 points for adrenaline and luck is starched genes, class freak and the perk that cripples enemies when using heavy guns..
---
I prefer people to robots and terminals
---
I am right there with you on that, just recently though I've started trading with people more often. And using the market on here..... And I'm definitely feeling more comfortable around other players ingame now.
---
Had a baseball in my junk. Attempted to scrap all junk. Everything scrapped except the baseball. When I tried to scrap the baseball the second time, the dialog asked "scrap all inventory?" I hit "no" and dropped the baseball in a paper bag.
---
Happened this morning.
---
You do not need to be in a team to trigger the event. The event can only be triggered once every 3 hours. You can do it "solo" since other people in the server will join the event; if no one else joins you, the event is very difficult. 
---
You got a free card from the quest line. It will not be consumed until you actually trigger the event, so you should still have it. I had mine for over a week. After using your card, you will need to buy the recall circuit board and craft a new card if you want to trigger the event again. 
---
You can join the event just like any other event in the game. There are no limits to how many times you can complete it. There will be an announcement in the top left of your screen when the event is active (same as Scorchbeast Queen and  Fasnacht festival). Fast travel to it and join the fight.
---
Do we have to take our shirts off and get all sweaty?
---
You’re saying those one star items changed, and stayed one star items only with 2 star only item effects, in the prefix legendary slot. 
---
It’s posts like yours that make me think everyone else here are just morons losing there stuff.
---
1500 hours played, haven’t lost one thing, never lost my wallet or car keys in real life either if that tells you anything.
---
You will see
---
Hmmm. TSE is still good; I'd personally recommend trying to find +25% fire rate as the secondary, the gun "feels" a lot better with that. 
---
Well, actually, which "Gatling" are you referring to? There's 3: Gatling Gun (ballistic), Gatling Laser, Gatling Plasma.
---
I’d love to play. I won’t be on until later but maybe I’ll see ya around! Nutbuster_5000 (I’m around level 47 now but by the time I get on later maybe you’ll be closer)
---
Hey man, appreciate the input. The things its these are two different glitches. One is visual, related to damage resistance calculations and damage resistance effects, and is happening when math works correctly. There is a separate, completely other issue where server ceases to receive information about damage you send. What you refer to is a valid issue that exist and I confirm its existence. The PvP infinite-HP-regen bug? Just a visual one and separate issue from server not receiving damage information. I referret to the first one in my previous comment, and I'm still right there. But your observations are valid too and the server not receiving damage info is a real thing and a serious bug.
---
SBQ is only three star, they need a new boss to drop 4 star drills, then you can mod it into 5 star.
---
Mmmm.
---
I died inside when I read worser.
---
I was able to uninstall the beta.
---
So not not regular pipe rifles? :( I have an explosive one.
---
Got to be something to do with the value of rifles and how valuable they are. They didn't want to make it too easy for us too hoard and sell them.
---
There’s one by toxic Larry’s meat n go, north west of harpers ferry. Gives you the mystery meat recipe
---
Cool! Thank you!
---
Using Heavy Weapons without power armor is just crazy. Stabilized is the keystone HW perk, it requires PA.
---
Kept mine. I use it for backup and while I’m playing in the forest
---
Mostly because of everyone abusing the duplication glitch. Didn't feel like id ever be able to keep up with that.
---
There is a niche which favors that. You need a team tho. You can go luck-less if you plan to fight at ranges where vats cant be used and you have teammates that deny your enemies access to vats range to you. This particular scenario is the only one in which sentinel assassin does not suck in survival mode.
---
Do you play on PC? Look up Perk Loadout Manager
---
Dun dun dun dahhh dadadadada
---
That's why we need full immersion in this location
---
I tried to. I really wanted it to be worth it. But my build makes it useless almost. The 8lbs of storage wasnt worth it to me. Not for 5% health per vats crit. Figured it was great for vats crits builds but I never use them
---
Perk Loadout manager on PC. Been using it since BETA. I won't play without it!
---
The burrows is absolutely terrible for this, there's actually certain ghouls that if you kill before they get up, I can guarantee they will disappear every time.
---
Sold mine got 1500 the week it came out

Wilderness and a weird wild animal.
---
Personally I have 3 missiles on the front and 3 on the back of my house. The barrage tends to send even wanted players scrambling.
---
Did your above mentioned recommendations, did not know refractor didn't work with PA.
---
I'll try it out and see what happens, I'm running a Medic Explosive faster reload LMG and Instigating Grognaks going to have to build a shit ton of ammo :/
---
No clue what this means. Dragon bug?
---
For most players it is effective enough. 90% of people you run across will not be prepared to take out someone with this type of armor/build, and will get absolutely slaughtered, no, massacred. 
---
It is such a powerful and difficult to counter thing that IMO it should not exist. It makes the gap between haves and have nots too wide to reconcile.
---
Lucky. My wife gives me this "you fuckin nerd" look when I play video games (and not in a good way) I can only play when she's at work.
---
Primed Bloody Explosive 50cal on a HW/explosives/PA low health build. I'm pushing 350 damage a shot WITHOUT explosive, just a 1star Bloody 50, and that's before Adrenaline kicks in (+60% damage at full stack). I also run Tenderizer, so I'm giving 7% damage buff to everyone attacking her. Oh, that's at a fire rate of 91. Explosives would kick me up 32% more damage (20% from Explosive legendary, times 1.6 from Demo Expert, gives 32% bonus explosive damage).
---
That being said, finding a Bloody Explosive 50cal is.... difficult, to say the least. They're never sold for caps, only traded for other god-tier items. I'd buy one if anyone would take caps, I've got like 40k caps at this point.
---
Well he's in ESO so maybe Bethesda can get him back.
---
Yeah I agree they are separate. I made another post where I've noticed the same on pvp players as well. One example I gave was emptying 200 rounds using explosive plasma Gatling with beam splitter from near point blank on a wanted player. Staggered him, drained his hp bar something like 5 times and it just kept filling back up.
---
I know how sentinel works as I have a set and once you get staggered you begin taking damage, this player never did. 
---
To add I do know you can build for dodgy by having near 500pts of AP, however that requires unyielding and this guy was not a low hp build. Also that would be very quickly depleted with the gun I was using since it hits 8 times with each shot at near 100 fire rate.
---
So while I do think the UI has some issues, I also believe there is something else going on. 
---
I have a suspicion that possibly on a your screen the player is one place but the server registers them in another. So you see them taking damage and then the server does not. This is just my guess though.
---
I'd recommend getting a gatling gun for general use and save the lmg for bosses or big enemies. 
---
Gatling guns are the only truely ammo efficient heavy weapons. Not the strongest or highest dps but the most useful for general gameplay.
---
It used to scale with the number of players that were in proximity or who tagged her. 8+ people was practically impossible.
---
Since patch 8, data miners have found a constant damage reduction perk on her that results in only 30% damage taken by her.
---
I had successful queen fights with between 4 to 11 people, although 4-5 people were barely enough, 11 was comfortably reasonable.
---
I lost a leg and an arm after fast travelling the other day (excavator) I've now bought the plan for calibrated shocks so I can just replace it when it happens again.
---
That’s the risk you run for carrying junk. Always make time to head to camp or a train station.
---
Good evening.
---
Damn I didn't think they'd sell for that so early. I was kinda hoping that since it's a legacy weapon technically it should only get more valuable as time goes on. Was finally sick of looking at it, and it panned out. Very happy with the sale.
---
gt?
---
I’ll bite,
---
What’s the difference between normal and bos combat armor?
---
SirSlaughterVI
---
Nuke it, I was very pleased
---
What I like about missile turrets is that if you give them some elevation, even if they miss, they hit the ground right next to the target and the splash damage still hits it. But I haven't used laser turrets much.

---
Getting there slowly, I'm going to be looking to do more trading soon but I'm not sure I have much to trade so I've been trying to build up my caps. Fasnacht helped a lot, didn't necessarily have to communicate with other players but having to be with them got me more used to the multiplayer!
---
good thing legendary armor -20% weapon weight exist
---
Not yet. Maybe next Tuesday patch/news will tell us more as to when it is coming. Should have the new Camera releasing too, after being delayed.
---
Or asleep.  I hear you on that one!
---
Well i dont use PA because i can easily switch to shotgunners perk, its not worth changing my special points just to have the stabilized perk. I have sentinels armor which requal or better  than PA, except for nuke zones. Add the non PA perks and you are a tank tbh
---
I had a situation like this: I was following a player for quite a while now, I had him tagged with recon and was following to shoot from a convenient position. I found one, and send few shots. Nothing, but he's still there so I move in closer. A full magazine now, vats heatshots with multiple crits from optimised godrolled bloodbuild, enough to take down a squad. Still nothing. I move onto his position and see him running in place. I send him two more magazines, for WTFs, nothing happens. I move out. Minute later I get notification I killed him. His lootbag appears three hundred metters from the point he was where I shot him. This was a server lag, a third possibility.
---
You should be, that’s a good price. I had no use for it and a full stash.
---
This reminds me of one of my favorite gaming moments of all time. 
---
Halo Reach Beta, me and a friend got bored of the armor abilities and said screw it let's both go invis and camp. We holed up in the upstairs building above the water on Powerhouse. We baited a kid to come in by me being visible and my friend corner camping invis. We assassinated him.  
---
We swap roles with me being invis just before another enemy runs in and just as he is being assassinated we hear the loudest whiniest "awwww god daaamnit" ever. Me and my bud just lost our shit, to the point of tears. We still mimic that kid to this day when something stupid happens.
---
To each their own!
---
BC Black Diamond!
---
If people snag the pylons and stay alive, the sheepsquatch isn't NEARLY as tough as the queen. I can rip into it pretty fast if I'm allowed to fire uninterrupted
---
Yeah I actually was surprised I held onto it so long. Fought with the stash for it and it was worth it. Feeling like i might have to go and hunt more of them down instead of just the ones i want for myself.
---
I run a stealth rifleman build as well. Carrying a hardened .308, a handmade, and combat shotgun, as well as .50 bmg and the mini gun.
---
The average weight for each rifle is 15, plus 1000 rounds of ammo, for each. 
---
Ironically my .50 and mini, is like 10? I know the .50 is really light.
---
Only cost $23. Not too bad
---
Made a post a few hours ago similar to this, and this problem should be addressed
---
Pour one out for the fallen homie
---
BoS is a material mod, like Polymer or Fiberglass. But it's the best armor mod, AND it doesn't increase armor weight at all!
---
It's listed in the hardbound vault dwellers survival guide under unique outfits and that's been out a while so it'll show up at some point.
---
This doesn't really change much in the economy, caps were already easy to get. It just makes it less tedious to get your daily max
---
Actually keep it. It can be used for advantage of placing down a camp somewhere else for free (if you want to keep all your caps as possible lol)
---
Yeah but using HW without stabilized is just.... ugh. You lose a ton of accuracy and 45% armor penetration. Don't even bother with HW at that point, stick with rifles or shotguns.
---
What a lovely home! Also your outfit is *adorable*.
---
Yeah so I’m level 70 and I started this event not knowing what it was and I promptly got merked. I mean, endless waves of guys shredding me. 3 other guys that were over 100 showed up shortly after to help and EVEN THEN we couldn’t stay alive long enough to power up all 3 pylons.
---
Is this event supposed to be very very hard?
---
For real. When you learn about this and even things like project 112, fallout seems a little realer than before. The game writes itself.
---
It definitely makes it less tedious.  But now I can sell items for ~500 caps and be done with getting the vendor’s caps much quicker.
---
There was a damage calculator avalible a few days ago, and according to that it would have the highest dps, greater than even a bloodied swing speed powerfist with unyielding armor and radicool.
---
Everything is correct except the last sentence.
---
We also had a massive uptick of people saying other players were stealing their items a few months back. Guess what, that was a complete hoax. Never happened. After all of the hoaxes on this sub, I refuse to believe any issue until I see even a shred of proof. Plenty of people record their gameplay for one reason or another, it is nigh impossible that not even one of them would have caught a before and after shot of losing a precious item
---
You know I had an effect something like zeta blocker or something like that that increased intelligence +1. Could not figure out how I got it or what it is.... But Zeta was in the name...
---
Ill give you 1200 caps for them.

I did the exact same thing with my wife and now I can’t play whenever she isn’t playing because it just isn’t as fun with me being alone anymore.

you on now?

Bos looks cooler

You can not sleep now, there are monsters nearby.

Alcohol, buffout, psycho, mentats, and med-x are for sure their own addictions. Between calmex, fury, and that other damage one, I believe at least one of them should be unique

Not loading. What is it?

Looks like a classic wild west panorama to me.

Same if all my friends aren't on!
---
A lot more ghouls that constantly respawning, check out the channel rifle gaming on youtube. He goes in depth on it. On one run he got around 8 legendaries 
---
He also does other nuking experiments, he has a good channel
---
Stealthboys are the scrub meta. And even a bloodied build should be running at least a few sent/assassin pieces.
---
One of the best.   I’m a 45 year old grown ass man, and a cattle rancher, snd freely admit I cry every god damn time I watch it.
---
This is a tough one. There’s been a big pushback in the EU and elsewhere against gambling in games as younger people can develop bad gambling habits through this kind of mechanic. Things like mystery boxes, wheel spins, etc, that are powered by micro transactions are being challenged as predatory. I don’t foresee this being an issue for this franchise as it’s marketed to 18+ (right?), but it’s still something to consider as realistically there are younger people playing these games and gambling addiction is a real thing.
---
A little bit. The performance of the game overall is worse now for me than it was a month and a half back when I first started playing.
---
They should add weapon mods to power armour like visable on the armour that would be dope
---
woot has the best shirt designs!
---
Set the rest to zero
---
I feel the Sheepsquatch Proper will be the big bad for the pioneer scouts mission in May. If I was a betting man, I'd wager the pioneer scouts final mission will include telling scary stories around the campfire and at after they tell the sheepsquatch story BOOM! Sheepsquatch. In addition, there's a sheepsquatch sighting at a clearing near Camp Adams which makes me think that's the context of the final Sheepsquatch fight.
---
You can still sell marine helmets for 20+ caps each when it costs absolutely nothing to make them. At least serums require stable flux, which is a somewhat rare resource. Not just rubber and plastic
---
Yes. And also, you can share Plus with the same method. I do this with a friend, so save yourself or your gf some money yo.
---
Word
---
I’ll have to give that a try.
---
That is terrifying.  You begin to press buttons with great care at that point.
---
No problem Thanks for the caps
---
I have to agree, pistols, with the correct mods, are massively more efficient with vats and ctrit damage.
---
I would not go as far to say they don’t know the game as much as they are teying to be cowboys (not good for your health).
---
Everyone should be voiced by John Cleese.

I wish I was voiced by John Cleese.

I gotta ask how old you are: Leave it to Beaver and Mazzy Star....

I wouldn't expect a Quantum river or whatever though. Nuka Quantum wasn't set for full production at other facilities to my knowledge. Nuka World was the first, and only because the bombs dropped not long after the initial release of the product. We only see Quantum elsewhere in the world because of shipments from that facility.
---
That said, I could be wrong. It has been quite some time since I played Nuka World and looked at the lore.
---
Her profile needs to be changed so that only friends can see her online.  Easy to do in the privacy settings.
---
Oh wow, that's kinda sad. Don't mean to seem rude but she shouldn't be able to restrict you like this (unless you have the game blasting on the speakers annoying her). Why should she care that you play if it isn't annoying her? No one should be able to restrict you like that and force you into living a certain lifestyle unless it isn't directly impacting them in a negative way. Maybe talk to your wife about this, you shouldn't be bossed around like this and she shouldn't either. A relationship should be equal and fair to both partners.
---
What kind of mangina needs his wife’s permission to buy a video game. Sad so very sad. And even worse, you have no shame and announce it to the world that you have no balls.
---
Yup for me to
---
There are mods and legendaries for that, mitigating the problem.
---
Rifles have stupid weight, no weight reduction, and have *all* the vats broblems in my experience.....i still love them.
---
Nice blog....?
---
This is not something I would admit to if I were you.  You are (presumably) a grown man.
---
Let me guess, you sit chameleon 99% of the time.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Jesus Christ.  Let me explain this once again.  There is a reason I never went into detail about my build, because this post is NOT about builds, it is NOT about perks or maximizing ones damage.  ALL it is about is the fucking weight of weapons.
---
I AM NOT RUNNING A MELEE FOCUSED BUILD.  People who primarily use guns and have their perks allotted for that are ALLOWED to also use a melee weapon from time to time.  If the situation calls for it, say if I'm swarmed by weak enemies or want to save on ammo,  I pull out one of my melee weapons depending on whether or not I'm in power armor.
---
And you were easily able to understand what h2h was referring to, so smugly pulling an "I believe you mean unarmed hehehe" is a pretty dick move.
---
Canned coffee is good for heavy attacks if you stock up. The only fixed locations they spawn at that I know of is each of the silos and the pylon house where you kill the sheepsquatch imposter. Not sure if there are better options than canned coffee.

Why the hell are you carrying around 50 bulk steel in the first place?  Steel is one of the most abundant materials out there, hell just equipping Scrapper when you need to a single weapon usually scraps into at least 16 steel a piece.
---
I can send screenshots of the items when Im off work if you dont believe me. Still called the Vampire War Drum but only gives increased swing speed. Or at least thats what it says. Im not high enough level to use it yet so idk of the effect change or the description just bugged out.
---
but does it stretch you out and leave you in your underwear when you exit it? or fold up into a neat 10# cube in your pack? does it even ask for atoms when you want to re-color it? ...if not, is it *really* power armor? if you cant love it on its bad days, you cant love it on its T-61 days.
---
it's really cozy! come inside, bring some garlic. ;)
---
I hope you can come out of your shell a bit on 76, your English is pretty damn good based on this. I get it though, if they added text chat I would be overjoyed.
---
Ah, I see.
---
Yeah, lemme just scrap 400 Assault Rifles real quick next time I need to make a bunch of ammo. Please stop talking.

There’s an actual quest for this? I thought it was a joke. Where is it?
---
It's because those power connectors radiate power when hooked up, but they have a range, so if your light is too far away it won't turn on.

---
doesn't apply to me since I'm PC, but still wanted to say that it looks like a cool idea and wishing you the best of luck
---
Fair, I don't have any of that atm. Either way the gun didn't suit me. Not effective enough for my build.
---
I dont feel i  need it, i used to have a PA HW perk and i dont see much difference, also i am not a pvp player.
---
Rip hobo. True warrior.
---
That said, the fact that there was even rudimentary problem solving required in Lying Lowe was a welcome change. You don't have to be able to speak the language the game is set to in order to follow quest markers and pick up things with diamonds on them.

Consistently kill it within 2 minutes, as long as people are on the pylons long enough without dying. I run a bloodied build and I use a be laser rifle and a tse gatling plasma.

yeesh, is that how people got into the dev room?
---
Most people use team chats of some sort. As for the bugs, I’m actually proud of Bethesda for the quality they were able to pull off from beta until last patch. Youtubers were trying to help bring the game down so it had no hopeof redemption. I feel that bethesda redeemed quite a bit. The game is playable. The duper’s are still banned. New and free content keeps rolling out, even if it’s small stuff.
---
I don’t agree with everything Bethesda has done or is considering doing, like the repair packs. I think that should be a semi rare item from doing events and not buyable with atoms. Luckily, they haven’t released them. I believe they will get a ton of flack if they submit to the easy mode people. They made promises and they should keep it. You can’t please everyone but you can keep your promises.
---
This is coming from someone who has a level 360ish, 94isb, 70ish, and two other mules. People get bored because they say that they run out of things to do. My response is, then find something else to do. There’s plenty in the game to alternate with. Don’t devote every second toward farming materials. Don’t devote every second to building, hunting legendaries or pvp. Mix it up. Explore and ignore dataminers. Those dataminers are what steal the joy of exploration and finding new things. By giving into YouTube and data miners, you’re going to end up with a bland game. I purposely don’t watch that stuff anymore because I like the idea that even on my 300 and something, there’s still something out there that I haven’t done nor explored. Make the game what you want it to be.
---
Uf i can i'll be there to at lest bet some caps
---
actually, for me at least, baseballs never scrap when I scrap all junk.. I always thought this was weird.
---
How big is the range? I had two lights on the same wall panel but only one of them worked.
---
I have one. What were you thinking?
---

The worst offenders have been banned. There is a max weight limit of 1500lbs + Str bonus to stop the players with thousands of pounds of gear. So I guess some of that has been dealt with?

Now that you mentioned it, you are right and the icons do correlate with the character action. What I tried to imply (I think...) is that I can't get my meaning across with the icons that I see on the emote wheel.
---
I think the explanations on the wheel are sort of a mess. I would think the "thumbs up" is something like "good job!" or "right on!", but the wheel says "Yes" doesn't it? I just think it feels awkward at times when you're trying to communicate your meaning through to another player.
---
Agreed, apparently the reason the Burrows isn't instanced is because they're still working on instancing. Hopefully that means they'll revisit the Burrows after Vaults start opening.
---
What's the issue? Your post is vague.
---
One of the ingredients... Is a voice of set, so you scrap one to make one.
---
I'll give 1000caps
---
Sadly it does not atleast it didn't with me I had to turn it on
---
No worries. I’m mainly set up for rifleman myself
---
Ah! In which case... Completely ignore me 😃
---
If you send me a picture of a 1 star legendary with increased swing speed ONLY or a 1 star legendary with dmg resistance while aiming ONLY, then I will give you 5k caps on PS4.
---
The fact is, those weapons don’t exist, and don’t magically change into different legendaries. Some people just don’t know how to properly rationalize events happening, and thus greatly misunderstood what is actually happening.
---
Nvm reread. Enemies randomly dropping dead happens sometimes for no reason regardless of which weapon you are currently using. A quite frustrating bug for sure.

A primed, bloodied with either +25% fire rate or explosive would probably be the best. That or ballistic gatling. However the ultracite .50 ammo uses violet flux which is needed in large quantities for stuff like calibrated shocks, jet pack etc, among other things.
---
You also don’t get much compared to what you use. Chances are you’ll go through between 1500-4000 rounds if you don’t stop firing, depending on how much others are contributing. That’s per fight. Making ultracite 5mm ammo for a god roll primed gatling is way, way cheaper. The fire rate is low but it goes a lot more damage per shot so it’s still very effective.
---
It's 25k max per character

Yes!! Ala Maplestory pet mechanic. Or auto stim or auto rad away!!

I used to run all three and could sprint across whole zones in one action bar.

Wait, what'd I miss, why do we care about radroaches now?
---
Camden Park is also pretty good for bugs. There are 6 roach spawns. Three of them are in the restroom with the weapons bench and three are in the train car. There is also a very good chance you'll find ticks/bloodbugs/bloatflies at grassy picnic area near the train car. Also if there are bugs near the picnic are, there will also be 2 or 3 near the same restroom with the roaches.
---
I don’t use it so that works. Maybe if you have any plans I can look through those also?

As I said I can't know if he was a duper or not, but the bans were random, I have several friends who are traders, I know they didn't dupe, and received temp, or the semi-perm bans as well, as for me not getting the hammer, could be luck, I didn't trip a flag (Ultracite), or the fact I've been a PIA enough times by now it could be additional bad PR.  
---
Having only those ammo types isn't odd, actually common, as traders especially will accept (well they did) ammo as currency, and of course you'll horde the ammo you use.
---
Broader point, 3 months post launch, those numbers are not only realistic, but flat easy for any of the more aggressive, multi-Account players, before the weight cap was introduced.  
---
I recently (last month) got rid of around 45,000 points of "Junk" of all types, due to the weight cap and max I could store on my various characters, including hundreds of thousands of steel, cloth, tens of thousands of gunpowder,

Black titanium and Ultracite.

Yes! Job select in ffxiv is brilliant. I love the way a lot of mmorpg mechanics work in ffxiv so it was like banging rocks and sticks together when I started playing fo76.
---
I don't check cash registers, guess I'll have to start doing that!
---
Not really. They're marginally useful if you have a lot of weapon weight reduction and you're not running a bloodied build, but that's about it.
---
Depends on the situation and enemy. You can experiment with some settings [here](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
TSE is a tiny bit better than AAE.
---
BE is better than TSE with &lt;75% health.
---
A simple versus is a bit better than two-shot,
---
A versus+explosive is still a bit better than TSE.

With Scrapper a single assault  rifle breaks down into NINETEEN steel, do you really regularly need 7600 steel to craft your ammo or did you just think pulling a big number out of your ass would make your argument look better?  
---
A single trip through West Tek would not only provide you all of the rifles and super sledges you could need to craft ammo but ALSO provide you a supply of gunpowder at the same time.
---
No, legendary effects aren't designed to be equally powerful and some are just gonna be the best all-around, or at least best for that weapon type. (Like, Instigating sucks on an automatic gun compared to other effects)
---
troubleshooter's/ghoul slayer's/etc would be good effects to have on armor though, if you want to have a different loadout for different enemy types.
---
Thank youu😁👍

Np. Enjoy!

Awwww man, I hate to hear of people losing radiums. Upvoted for a radium bro.

On which platform did this atrocity occur?
---
Check out Jug on youtube. His building skill is master level
---
Did you buy it with the money you made? If yes, then you shouldn't need permission from her... It's just a $60 game. Not a brand new car or house etc...
---
I know they are aware of it, I can’t remember if it’s slated for Tuesday or a future update but I can check when I get back in the office Monday.
---
Wavy Willards Water park is great for scorched. Around 22 of them.
---
The river immediately next to Summersville spawns around 7 mirelurks. All below level 10.
---
didnt fallout 4 have bulk items that couldnt be scrapped?
---
it was like a piece of paper that said something like x50 steel, and the paper would remain until all 50 steel was used, and then would be deleted after the 50th steel. it couldnt be scrapped for the 50 steel, it was just a set value, a placeholder that would remain in place of the 50 steel.
---
why couldnt we just do THAT, but instead of it being a weightless paper, we set a weight to it, and change the info graphic to a box/bundle
---
I would love to see one in the ash heap with a mole man king there
---
I can craft one.
---
I wish I could have seen that.

Doubt it.  I was out of town so I missed out as well.
---
Pipe revolver got me through my pistol only build. No legendaries but still dealing like 120 damage for cheap and easy rounds, and absurdly cheap repair costs. I had a 2shot black powder, but almost never used it.
---
"EAT PEOPLE" mmmmmmm....
---
Yeah I loved the beasts of Berkeley. Also the Legendary son of fluffy. I love cryptic hunting and these quests are keeping me interested. 
---
There are a couple new ones his week too, a nice wendigo battle.
---
Hopefully instance with multi tier bosses thats repeatable.
---
From what i understand thats only on pc because it was supposed to be taken out of the game and hacker found it in the code
---
So, how many cavalier pieces are you running? What is your perk loadout?
---
Similar boat but im on 7 days and 22 messages back and forth. Yesterday they asked for my email address. Really confused me and after responding i realized they were asking for the email address that i was using to message them. They seriously asked for my email that they had already sent 7 messages to. 
---
Dealing with customer service has been worse and more frustrating than the original issue i put in a ticket about
---
I'm reposting a reply I made further down because PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS.
---
For the VAST majority of scrap there is ZERO advantage to bulking unless you're then selling that bulk to a vendor.
---
For example, someone further down tried to make the argument that carrying around FIFTY bulk steel was saving them carry weight.
---
1 Steel Scrap = 0.05lbs
---
30 Steel Scrap = 1.5lbs
---
1 Bulk Steel = 1.5lbs
---
Off the top of my head the ONLY materials that actually lose weight when bulked are Aluminum and Lead.  EVERYTHING else weighs the exact same amount, the ONLY reason the game says you're saving on weight is because every time you craft one of those bulk you're throwing away plastic.
---
And here I'm server hopping for the 3 at wavy willard's
---
Yeah whatever the issue is is most likely server related. I personally don't have the best internet at the moment, so I thought it was likely my connection until I noticed other players having same issued with same enemies.
---
Thank you very much! Appreciate the response
---
I see where your coming at but it is rated m like you said. I see this as, you cannot purchase caps with real money and only earn them so it’s fair.
---
cuck needs to ask permission
---
Maybe, but I’m more interested in more syringer barrels. There’s a lot of potential there. I want to see some crazy, whacky effects introduced.
---
Bloodied. It's really easy to play low-hp in power armor.

---
Well said. Bethesda games are known by their fans to be bug-ridden (sometimes hilarious, sometimes damning), but imo it’s kinda became a charm of the game lolol
---
And as a 400+ hour player, with multiple high levels (100+) I’m _always_ finding some minute detail that I wouldn’t have noticed if I started screaming along with the EchoTube.
---
I’ll be happy to do so. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Stick around, give it time. Game is still fairly new and getting better.
---
Thata why i use green soa....
---
Omg green is just blue with yellow in it!
---
/tinfoil hat engaged
---
I'm hoping they don't fix it. I've got my bolt action that I want to make into a pistol class after the prestige comes out
---
I'd be lying if I said I'd never done that
---
Late to this, but while purple looks cool, it doesn't illuminate well. I prefer the red because it gives me those Mothman eyes.
---
Yeah, I was seeing a LOT of Violet Flux around. Might tank the market on it.
---
&gt;  I'm like level 232 (Mr no life I am) 
---
That's actually impressive. I'll get there some day. I've only been playing a couple of weeks, and have intentionally not researched anything about how the game works, so as not to spoil the discovery. I am an old hand at Fallout games, though.
---
well congrats on getting a response, i've been waiting on an advance support team member for all of these 5 days, the first person i talked to got back to me about 15min after i put in t he ticket, said they can't do anything to help and bumped me to the advance support that could help, and i havn't gotten anything back since, just waiting for agent as the ticket status
---
What types of flux are generated in that nuke zone?
---
On a side note, where there many legendary mutants there?
---
I started making a "garage" for the workbenches, and a real house for the rest. It's easier to decorate and maintain one area without worrying about benches jutting out.
---
2 to 3 legendarys.   And yes it should be all flux
---

---
You can reduce anything to something that sounds dumb.
---
My comment was in response to his question on the Gatling plasma.
---
I basically carry four weapons, each with a specific use - melee for trash, pistol for general purpose, shotgun for close quarters, sniper rifle for being a sneak bastard. I've actually switched out my pistol for a pipe revolver rifle, since it lets me use both rifle and pistol perk cards, and because I'm migrating to a rifle build. I also built a new pipe bolt-action as my sniper rifle, since it lets me use both cards as well, and thus gives more damage than a regular hunting/sniper rifle. So far it's working out great.
---
I meant is there cobalt, crimson etc?
---
The smallest amount of effort would just be to remove them, we have the 1400 shared cap limit now, we don't need to run around to each faction at Whitesprings.
---
And if someone wants to take them from *you* then they're right to try to take them. PvP is part of the game, care bear
---
Good luck with that. I can't see Bethesda making it easier for us to save money.
---
I've seen some of his videos and his shit is amazing. I can find how to build bad ass stuff, I'm having trouble finding videos dealing with the more basic aspects of base building. 
---
It's funny, I'm level 190 and am just now building my first real camp. I've normally just built workshop items and a water purifier and a couple of turrets.
---
You should just tag to search screws. It makes it easier to find them when you’re exploring
---
Update to this, guys. I can find screws, I even have a junk extractor running at camp, I’m looking to save time.
---
Raw yes
---
They’ve long said they can’t do anything about lost in game items,they don’t have the “tools”.
---
No problem
---
I have a heavy/commando build and it works nicely. Only, I have to choose between gunsmith for more durability or demo expert for my explosive weapons. Meh, I have the junk to repair everything fairly often. Also, I have all of the shotgun, slugger, gladiator, other melee and all weight reduction perks so I can flip between heavy, shotgun, melee and mule. I also have all of the rifleman perks but I need a good rifle for those to be effective. The potential is there, though.
---
People tend to not care for pipe weapons as well. I got a legendary pipe rifle way back in the day for like 100 caps at a vendor on my first character. I love them, although yes they do look janky.
---
I think you misunderstand me lol.  I enjoy pvp and am making fun of OP for whining about it.
---
There's always next year.
---
That's stupid,  thanks though
---
Psn?
---
I got someone here on Reddit to craft me an ultracite Gatling laser with beta wave mod for extra fire damage. I have found the plans for Prime receiver for the ultracite Gatling laser that does additional damage to scorched and the SBQ. However, crafting the Fusion cores with flux was cramping my style. 
---
So I just use the ultracite Gatling laser with the beta wave mod, it does more damage than most legendary items and someone will craft one for you typically for 1000 caps plus mats. 
---
Plus it looks freaking, cool green laser for the win!
---
I never struggle with lead cuz I only use .45 and I've got like 4500 of that.  Mostly use advanced meat hook.
---
Might make it

Even over my lever action? It's quite a slow fire.
---
What’s the weapon and it’s stats if I may ask?
---
One of the most useful and well-written posts I've read. Thanks!
---
Good luck in your attempts to communicate with them, they make it difficult. There is a different name attached to every email and they haven't responded to the questions I've asked or even acknowledged part of my issue. Don't understand why they would treat customers like this, really offputting
---
Thank you! Yes she is!
---
Sadly no. Laser Weapons while they can be modded to use either a Pistol grip or Rifle Stock do not benefit from Gunslinger and Rifleman- it's one or the other.
---
Plumber builds can be pretty powerful for the early game when you don't have a lot of legendary gear.
---
Thank you sir

Im glad to hear it. Just gotta redownload 50 gigs of stuff so i might be awhile getting back into it.

Sorry I’m a dummy XB1!

XB1 have mics yes!
---
Charleston responder vendor rare spawn though
---
Lol u have to wait 20 hours..guess what ..if u go to the other vendor stations the same thing will happen
---
I think everything got pushed back because of the massive amount of bug squashing they had to do, which really only made a dent. The idea, though, is to get us hyped for stuff that isn’t out yet so we keep playing. If they released it all at once, a large portion of the player base would do everything and stop playing, lowering revenue (atom sales) and discouraging people from buying the game because the servers begin to die. Others might also quit because the population drops below what they consider reasonable. Having new stuff drop every month or so is a good way to keep people playing in the long run.
---
It's only available at the unique responder vendor that occasionally spawns across from Charleston Station. It can take quite a bit of server hoping to get the vendor to show up as it's a random spawn and if it does show up it doesn't even always have the long coat.
---
YES. progression is good! All that is needed now is the pieces to be solid metal and the exoskeleton to support the user's movement. Hydraulics would need to be used to support the weight of the metal when it opens up.
---
As my Favorite Protectron would say: "Ma'am"!
---
U need permission to buy things?
---
Welcome back!
---
Good find!
---
Looks great!
---
I just saw the coat but I did not buy it :(
---
Also I've had three of those advanced team messages. Then the next message is from a different name and asks for info i already gave them. Seriously frustrating
---
It will be fun and cosmetic 
---
But not astounding
---
You dont need plans for them
---
That's what happens when your drunk and operating equipment (excavator armor) and Bethesda here incentivizes it with challenges.
---
Oh lol
---
Thx
---
Np xD
---
If you don't have them automatically you'll definitely get them the first time you take over a workshop
---
The game is great and a lot of fun.
---
This is a good post. It presents a problem and a possible solution.

Nope! Need help

---
It's for power armor jetpacks and prime receivers on weapons
---
If your on ps4 you can come check out my camp and i can help with some basic questions. Level 160ish and i spend too much time building. Psn same as here
---
Lever action isn't that slow, and keep in mind automatics do less damage a shot. A semi-auto combat rifle is higher DPS over it's automatic version. Solely due to higher damage and higher accuracy.
---
The railway rifle is like 14lbs, the ammo weight is ridiculous. Realistic but Jesus ... The .50 isn't much better. Yeah they need some kind of weight reduction or maybe that's too balance out their damage.
---
Makes sense! The game does lag quite a bit. 😉
---
I will buy it from you if you're selling
---
If it helps the pipe pistol users I'm not upset and feel like it should be kept around. Without this quirk there's Hardly any reason to go the pipes over one of the better weapons (see handmade gun)

So wait a second, your weapon disappeared.. So you dropped a piece of junk and in the bag was the junk and your weapon? Did you just try it out of curiosity or? Good to know if it was blind luck if that's the case!

I dunno, maybe read the comments in the posts for the last few months? The increase of posts since the last update which occur daily? Maybe the comments from tons of people in here who have had it happen as well? Maybe the acknowledgement 2 months ago from Bethesda? 
---
Being cynical only goes so fa, you know. I wouldn't waste my time writing something fake. Not everyone is out to shit all over the game. 
---
Also, what am I supposed to prove with? The before and after screenshots that could also be faked? Or the video clip I made the exact moment it happened? Because it isn't something you can just notice happen immediately unless you're fixated in your inventory at the time.
---
Point remains, we deserve an updated acknowledgement and a plan of action from Bethesda.
---
How could he have done that? Is it coming to Xbox Gold soon?
---
Prettty sure the guy above me edited their comment.
---
If you're on in 9 hours... I'll be more than happy to help you setup power connectors so your entire base is powered up. Or I can build your entire base if you want :D
---
I love building, probably 50% of my time in game is spent messing around with my camp, moving, rebuilding, etc.
---
Thats why you should have given it to me
---
The 30% damage boost does save ammo and produces faster kills with adrenaline. I've been running with such a selective build and it is great.
---
Anti-armor isn't always better, for example, AA Handmade does 11% less damage than a Zealot's Handmade against Scorched (no mods). A Two shot Handmade with standard receiver performs 4.5% better. However, a hardened AA vs a hardened TS, the TS loses \~1% (it appears the TS effect does not consider the hardened modifier).
---
Instigating requires an enemy with full health and a high enough rifle to take out the enemy before it can find you or shoot back.
---
Bloodied can be a massive damage boost, for example, a B Handmade at 4% health and with adrenal reaction performs 67% better than a Zealot's Handmade.
---
I guess from a role playing perspective you’re right
---
Ive heard a theory you have to actually target burrows with the nuke and not harpers ferry. Did you target burrows?
---
They are considered ingredients since they are in the baseball grenade recipe so they don't auto scrap.
---
Actually no it doesn't. Because the experience was the exact same for me. I went in apparently in someone's sloppy seconds and just happened on the first run to go in the exact correct path to get to the end. There was only about 10 or so Ghouls and meat piles everywhere. It was a stroll to the end. Killed the robots and then the assaultron and didn't even realize it was the end of the quest. It took about 7 mins. 
---
Point is, if you just happen to walk in behind someone who just cleared it, chances are there a few to zero mobs inside. It takes about 6-10 mins depending. It doesn't get respawns for each player, the mobs just reset after a certain time. 
---
Yes, this is the experience that some of us had, no, there is nothing you can say that will change that experience as our first trip in. 
---
I did go in a second time and it was full of mobs. and I took different paths and really explored it out. Checked for hidden stuff in the water etc. I spent a good 40 mins in there at that time. 2 other high-level players came in while I was exploring, so even part way through there was little to no mobs in there after a little while until I got to the end. The Gutsys were there.
---
....that over-repair bonus damage is the only thing that makes chainsaws, buzz blades, and rippers even remotely viable for any use at all.   
---
So of course it's a bug.
---
ya realize there are people in the trade groups that would have given you their wives/mother/children for that gun that are bloodied builds.. and ya prolly ended up given it to someone that looked at it and said ew bloodied then vendored it.. 
---
anyways really rude to not have said thanks or given a thumbs up/heart.. no matter what the gift was.
---
I would pay good Atoms to be able to have a small radrat with an eyepatch follow me around, perhaps a miniature Mirelurk, or a Yao Guai cub. (Baby deathclaws? Passive molerats? Sure, why not?!) 
---
Of course, this would also bring up the conversation involving dogs, and whether or not they should serve as "vanity pets," or full-blown Dogmeat-like followers. Still-- even it is just the former, I would love them either way.
---
I keep my weapons named zzNameHere so theyre at the end of the list to avoid such shenanigans.
---
Have noticed if you drop another item within a certain distance and time, instead of making a new bag it moves the old one.
---
I demand a baby deathclaw I can make pink, purple, blue, or rainbow.
---
But what if the tokens only count towards a re-roll on the weapon you submit? That'd be such a Bethesda move
---
Lol. You’re right on that. Some of these bugs I’m glad we had. Like classic white springs. Others made me laugh. Like hitting a ghoul so hard that he falls through a wall and makes it look like a gloryhole. Others I was ready to quit the game for a bit but honestly, it wasn’t even Bethesda that ruined it for me back then. It was proven to be those duper’s and destroying server stability. I personally think they should be banned for life.
---
I’m 51; I hear ya.  Nobody remembers Abbott and Costello on Sundays.
---
have you tried walking through the door anyways? been a time or two for me (on ps4 btw) where ive clicked to open something, door doesnt animate opening but i can still proceed through.
---
Yeah for some reason people only want to apply the logic of the run they got out of it. My experience was the same as yours. Its a good dungeon, just poorly implemented is all. Some of us walked right in behind someone else's clear and had few to no mobs to fight. I was so confused all the way through.
---
I still haven’t seen a Mothman or Flatwoods Monster out in the wild. Maybe I just want to too hard
---
I you do a google search atleast I found the effects already set and will be similar to the all rise +15 hp legendary perk.
---
You may change your mind if you are on a popular spot. Wtf...
---
I have a rifle with a 90% weight reduction perk on it and it STILL weighs 12 pounds. Rifles are ridiculously heavy.
---
Riflemen do need a weight reduction card.
---
My wife and I did the same for Monster Hunter Works (one of our favorite franchises =), and I managed to get her hooked on Fallout 76 during the beta (she loves the Elder Scrolls games but only ever watched me play Fallout, which she enjoyed...just not enough to play her on her own).  Recently we got a third PS4 to let our daughter start playing some games with us too (mostly MHW, but I did get her Fallout 76 a couple of weeks ago when she started showing an interest in it too =).
---
It's been stable for me this morning.
---
Join on me...got 2 zones
---
Maybe that was the case in fallout 4. But in fallout 76, automatic/prime automatic receivers on some rifles do almost equal damage per shot as semi auto counterpart. needs some balancing
---
And after seeing Marsha get her nose broke so many times and Eddy Haskel be so smarmy so many times you just say fuck it and go outside to play.  Simpler times.   I’m gonna go yell at some clouds.
---
On pc the jet pack plans for the t60 for me at least, are 7200? Caps. That’s 1 point into bargain perk.
---
Vampire easy, you can tank, do damage and essentially take no damage cause your regenerating with bullets.
---
I have a 3* vampire explosive 50 cal though so I have the best of both worlds lol
---
I actually highly enjoy that these are forced to co-op!  It makes events challenging and dangerous!  A friend and I were going for the sole survivor weapon, doing event after event and kept murdering the people after the events and taking their stuff.  It brings a whole new level of strategy.  I NEVER bring junk or many aid items, usually 5 water, some food and a few stims.  I personally think this is hilarious, because you either have to kill then quick, or grab shit and gtfo!!
---
I used to have a camp that was constantly stalked by mothmen. I've seen maybe 2 flatwoods since I started in beta. 
---
I wish I saw more death claws too
---
same here, seen it from time to time, but never really looking for it to know if its a random spawn or static.
---
I'm 2 months from 40 and my Sundays were spent watching The Three Stooges.
---
I'd rather build it myself. I wouldn't mind some tips or instruction. GT is Harry Wagstaff. If I'm on that late, I'd love a little help.
---
GT?
---
Same as name.......sorry abt that
---
Explosive vampire.  By a landslide.
---
All g
---
I keep my weapons, outfits and anything important titled - XXX
---
So like..
---
- AAE Handmade
---
They're always at the top. So nothing that I've lost, has ever been because of a drop. My X-01 leg piece disappeared while farming West Tek with my brain shut off, and I only enter the menu when I return to my CAMP to maybe make repairs on my melee weapons. But that's only after all 4 break. Which takes a long time. Power Armor needed to be repaired and I repaired the Chest Piece and Helmet that day.
---
Everything was good, and my power armor icon on the left showed all the pieces. I look at it quite a bit to make sure my stuff isn't breaking.
---
Then all of a sudden, I look back after like 5 more runs and the leg is gone..
---
The only thing that happened was the loading screens from server hopping, and walking inside West Tek. But I didn't change any equipment at all.
---
Even before this I'm always super OCD and make sure I'd never drop anything either. I do that for all games. I keep organization as priority so it isn't a mess, I don't get confused and won't accidentally sell or lose anything.
---
You want people. Try the burrows. That's where the people are.
---
&gt;Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
---
Im sorry bro. This halo reference went over my head. I was just so heated at the time and took your comment as sarcasm. Again I'm sorry
---
Ps4 as well. This explains so much. I was experiencing that as well and a restart fixed it. I wonder how many cool things I might have missed due to this... 🤔
---
You should post some close ups! I love that kinda thing, I've raiderized some of my decorations as well. One of my faves is my vault boy "have your aken your chems today?" poster
---
Also theres no radiation damage in the burrows so you can go without PA
---
Id love a pet that just lives in the camp and like collects crops and water
---
Your offline
---
Just make sure to get the onyx 1 in a couple days
---
I nuked it a few days ago and initially, I saw only regular 42-62 ghouls. After about 10 minutes though, the Glowing ones arrived. I'm not sure if it was due to a timer or a fresh player entering the burrows. It is a pretty frequented and shared place so it may not respawn immediately.
---
Just practice your English bud, cuz I highly doubt they will add text chat.  Takes too long to input during gameplay.  Just get up on your mic skills man.  Dunno what country you're from, but I play with lots of people with hard thick accents, and we usually figure it out.  Good luck.
---
Yeah I could have sold it or traded it off or gave it to a friend but I was like hell I can make this persons day
---
I'm a bloodied build as well but like I said the one I have I better imo
---
I've made several friends doing this exact same thing and was honestly stunned by his rudeness which I've rarely seen in 76
---
I vaguely remember there's a moving truck with furniture and another chunk of furniture on one of the roof areas as well.
---
Ah.
---
any chance sharing the location?
---
I'm sure you would have been more grateful
---
Well Im on xbox.
---
I might be misinterpreting something, all I know is when I looked at the weapon when I first picked it up it had the health drain, and when I looked at it again later it had the attack speed. Im only level 30 and I dont have more than one weapon to be confusing it. I dont recall how many stars it has. Can legendary weapons degrade if picked up by a lower level? Do they not show all their effects if there are multiple effects stacked? Can effects even be stacked?
---
I was hoping for new weapons and creatures.  Gatorclaws would have been a good addition to The Burrows but I guess it would not have made much sense.
---
Not the type of game for wacky mini pets.
---
At least you guys can give the wolf the bone, I can't even get a button prompt. I have the bone, but it won't let me put it in it's mouth. Fml
---
I just got the game a few days ago, so I'm fairly new as well (level 11). What do you play it on?
---
U guys get in?  I'm  about to leave world
---
There is definitely some diminishing returns. Corn soup and well tuned make a big difference too.
---
Usually play odd hours, but ive got a few groups I run with.
---
Same ign. Will be late the next few days.
---
My PSN is p3ngu1n_assault. I'm still relatively low level (11).

Must be a very strong and loving relationship when you have to convince your *wife* into "letting" you buy a video game. Yikes
---
AND GRAHAM IS HERE!
---
Well we also became alcoholics, so there's that.
---
id say or offer, try to set your shyness aside and get a headset and get in there and talk to people, or atleast listen, i have met and ran with people from all over the world in this game some with no accent and some with pretty heavy accents. i have also met a few shy people that dont want to talk but will listen to our team chat and either emote or send me a txt through ps4 chat directly. 
---
youre worried about speaking english, what would you tell someone trying to learn your language? get out there and use it, its the easiest and best way to get better at it, and a good group of people will help you get better and not harass or make fun of you for trying.
---
I just buy my games. She spends 40$ a month on nails I’m going to spend on 100$ a year in games lol
---
If you can find a really nice combat rifle or handmade rifle and go completely into rifle-related damage perks, there's not a lot in the game that can withstand a heavy barrage from a perked-out rifleman.  You also have the range that shotguns don't, and with "true" mods the hip fire accuracy on a handmade (what I'm using) is very, very good.  I keep a scoped long gun (hunting rifle, lever action, pipe bolt action) with "stabilized" mods for picking away from long range, and a handmade rifle with a reflex dot and "true" mods for close range interior and mob fighting.  Magazine mods that cut through armor are also very, very useful.  I recommend the piercing mag for a hunting rifle and combat rifle, and the stinging mag for a handmade.
---
I'd recommend seeking out some legendary versions, as they can increase your damage dramatically.  An instigating long gun is ideal, you'll kill almost everything with one headshot, and an anti-armor combat/handmade for close quarters is going to tear enemies up.  Check the vendors at the Whitespring Hotel often, because other players sometimes sell the craziest shit.  I got [this lever gun](https://imgur.com/E1rwVPX) from the Artisan's Corner robot.  Some people are out of their minds vending away gold like that.  It's my main rifle.
---
A guy I played with the other night said was an army engineer for a while... says its totally possible with pneumatics/ hydraulics, and that DARPA is working on power-armor-like thing to help lift heavy objects (re-loading bombs into planes and such).
---
But you know, also just some guy from the internet. Would love someone who knows something about pneumatics to talk about it!
---
Gotta get him power armour lol thanks anyways
---
Damn it. I'm on PS4.
---
Well fuck. I wish people told tales of my valiant effort met with bitter defeat the way that you did.
---
Maybe it's related to when it happens with mobs. I killed a Legendary Ghoul in the Burrows on my second go round and it dropped a legendary Fatman, On the ground. I killed it, bloodied messed it, Gibbed up and the Legendary fell out with the gibbs, then suddenly disappeared back into the Ghouls inventory where I could loot it.
---

---
Did you play 4 on survival mode?
---
There are lots of similarities
---
My biggest tip would be to ignore all the hate and enjoy the game take your time and no reason to rush
---
And if you can without spoiling a lot find a list of the unique gear that comes from quests and do those AFTER you hit lv 50
---
Some guns are super good but the quest pops up when you're a low lv

Finally talked my wife's son into letting me use his console.
---
I’m surprised we don’t have a Scorchbeast head...
---
probs need to make the assualtron recall card. you get the thing you need to make it, iirc. (Quest items on tinker bench. Shows under misc in inventory.)
---
If one was launched on your server, theres a delay before relaunch. 3 hours I seem to recall reading, havent confirmed myself.
---
I think Grognak and Nuka Tapper are the only ones with set spawns. The rest are randomly found magazines. There's also at least one new one, I found Waste Lad but it wasn't listed in the challenges.
---
They’re part of the random magazine drops. Grind all of those places and pray to your RNG god. I was able to get them all this way. Tip: Sons of Dane has 3 spawn points in a relatively small area.
---
A several month old game no less, lol.
---
Its a load screen, not the same as a privately created instance so people can have a safe space
---
Oh, and buffout doesn't count for guided meditation.
---
The wandering Responder Vendor, spawns next to Charleston station (just run across the bridge and back again to trigger spawn) as a rare spawn and as a uncommon (but more often than in Charleston) down the road west from Lady Janet's Soft Serve, just past the buss.
---
Usually takes roughly 20+ server jumps to get him to spawn in Charleston. Around 5-8 at Lady Janet's. Less if you are lucky, much, much more if you pissed of the RNG-gods.
---
I mean it’s thumbs up , and in real life context , it can mean all of those and more.
---
Here's a great video (long but extremely informative):
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbFN065OK6U
---
The way I typically power up my base is putting my fusion generator down (typically in a corner). I then enclose it within walls and use the power conduit junction (? I think, it looks like this but for fo76: https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/editorial/2016/06/conduitinbuildview.jpg).
---
I usually have my generator on my second floor (3 story base). I connect power connectors to the top and bottom pieces so I can get power through the floors, while the one that comes out of the wall is for the outside of my camp (for me at least, depends which wall you place it on).
---
For the bottom floor, I have the power connector that comes out of the ceiling go around my camp with additional power connectors. This let me light up the ceiling (if you want to light up the floor, then you need to put a power connector on the ground and have it go around your camp). I usually save that for my top floor, since there is already a power connector coming out of the ground. I then use ground track lights for that floor, while the bottom floor using ceiling track lights or something else.
---
My GT is my reddit username if you want to add me (on the chance you are on when I get home from work).

Rifle builds while not the strongest at the outset are very strong at higher levels with a clever perk loadout, mutations, and armor.

Dear Fallout 76, Please give everyone who logs on daily the atoms potentially obtained during daily and weekly challenges that involve anything with the new camera. Simple. Easy...and it would spread goodwill throughout the wasteland. Some bugs can be ignored if a former vault-dweller has a generous atoms allowance. Just spent way too long looking for a tourist who does not exist. 
---
New on my bucket list:
---
Do not pay to play while obtaining the highly coveted limited-time offered or seasonal items in the Fallout 76 Atoms Shoppe.
---
Sincerely,
---
shiva_ri (pc)
---
Preach.
---
Combat Armor (and other armor types) always has mods attached when it is generated, but you can't see some of them because there are no recipes to craft them as they are attached by the engine during item generation.
---
Light/Medium/Heavy are mods that are attached to the ap\_armor\_Size attach point. Medium and Heavy add a fixed weight that is not reduced by the legendary effect. These values were 2.5wt and 5.0wt in Fallout 4.
---
Legendary effects, including Weightless, are also mods that are attached to a specific ap\_Legedary\_# attach point, but I don't think they add any weight directly.
---
There are also player modifiable mods such as Material (ap\_armor\_Tier) and Misc (ap\_armor\_Lining) which also add fixed weight and a base multiple weight respectively. These can in some cased be attached during item generation which can even attach mods a player cannot (such as the Serrated Bowie Knife).
---
Same here! I never played online before and as soon as we got the second system, it's a brand new gaming experience that we get to share. There's so few offline co-ops that we usually got stuck swapping the controllers every few hours or playing Borderlands for the umpteenth time. I love being able to explore the wasteland together and meet new friends! :-)
---
I love that look, personally.  It is funny how people get rid of great versions for next to nothing, just because it's a pipe weapon.  I did an easy trade for [this old dirty beast](https://imgur.com/o9NTGe8) today, and it just tears everything up.  Having 1,175 dmg baseline sneak attacks that only improve with adrenaline, low health and at night is pretty rad.
---
It happens to mobs too. You find those random Items just lying in odd places where they don't belong, where they don't normally spawn, just laying on the ground where there are enemies nearby. The Silo codes and tech data you find in random spots on the ground. Or when you kill a mob the weapon drops out on the ground instead of the corpse loot container. I think it's related, a bug with mobs and player inventory containers.
---
LMFAO SO TRUE
---
Their stance is they dont support them (eg: on your own if something breaks)
---
Patch 5 or 6 broke a ton of them. Made everyone fall through the map. Modders figured it out within hours. Most mods were fixed by end of that day.
---
But they've said they will add official support eventually.
---
I'm guessing that's the black one?
---
If your on PS4 I'd give you 2k for it
---
I think it's good now. 
---
However,  it can get A LOT better.  And for that, I'm hopeful.
---
Covert operative 3 only boosts to 2.5x but it does stack with Instigating. The melee Ninja goes up to 3x.
---
Would have made my day and i dont run a bloodied gun build but it would have made me roll a new character..
---
Course if ya on ps4, and ya find an instigating explosive lever and wanna get generous again come find me.. id love ya for life lol
---
Lmao
---
Ah right okay, but it’s still stacking the same way, which is is rad!
---
Wanna hear something else crazy, for when you finish getting your rifle cards?
---
Check out the damage and fire rate on the plasma flamer (plasma gun, flamer attachment, rifle stock). Effing crazy damage in CQB. Literally insta-goo's anything below your level. Couple of seconds for most other things. Makes a nice dent in the SBQ. I found a quad one, just level 30, and its insane.
---
I'd imagine it probably does well as pistol too.
---
Boiled Canned Food
---
Dog Water
---
I have fallen into a fissure site and died, but i have also fallen into a fissure site and lived and was able to retrieve all the loot from people who had fallen in.
---
Am I right in thinking the 10mm is the only auto pistol?
---
I bet the robots at The Whitespring are sick of the sight of you. What if someone brings the queen out or the Imposter Sheepsquatch? Just ignore them or trek over?
---
You sound so negative.
---
I was thinking of using Dodgy but hear the AP drain is pretty extreme. I wonder if all of those together would make it more viable?
---
Told my wife ima play if she dont like it, there’s the door.
---
You probably hated mounts and pets in MMOs
---
If you sacrifice your first born Todd’ll give them to you
---
I'll gave to pop out of my PA from time to time and try that!
---
Find a play style and stick with it until you want to change it
---
I think the only way they can do that is if they attempt a workshop takeover. Did you own a workshop?
---
Same problem, I’m makeshifts warrior level 5, but can’t apply any mods to my pole hook..... so annoying
---
I'm on x1 so sorry man
---
And for real bloodied is good even if it's not your build it's just godly with the right perks mutations
---
Yep. It will be a cool display even after Easter. I wish there was 1 with nothing. I like having trophy looking things, and a normal Deathclaw egg sitting atop a mantle around my trophy heads and such would look great
---
Separate your foundation from the rest of the house blueprint (as in walls, decorations etc on one, then the floor and foundation on another.) 
---
Place your floor blueprint and the second blueprint should snap to the floor perfectly. Since I did that I haven't had a problem relocating.
---
I’ve been fine
---
Just had this happen to me today. Don’t see much else posted about it. Annoying.
---
Can u even put stuff on shelfs or other items?
---
I think the game senses it. I was hunting for them for weeks and then gave up and like a day later got jumped by both. The Mothman damn near gave me a heart attack as he bamfed right in front of me! Have faith fellow wastelander, you don't find the cryptids, they find you.
---
If your wife likes 76, don't let her miss out on 4!
---
Yea, those do exist, there are videos of it, but they don't run for very long.
---
Oh damn. Sorry.
---
Never said that, read the post. Got it
---
That video seems to be exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.

Maybe there is a challenge for Atoms that they need. Or maybe they're too scared to go to Survival, so they only PvP when they know they can win.
---
At the southern belle motel in the mire. There’s a note on the table near boomer
---
With googling what it is.
---
On PC. Would give 3k.
---
There gotta be some pvp even in adventure mod I mean come on.. fallout is all about raiding and stabbing people in the back
---
Yeah, hop on now
---
I can sell you one for 1000c tomorrow.
---
It has steadily been getting better, but more hiccups than i remember ESO having. Time will tell
---
Could that be Easter decorations?
---
regular pipe rifles, bolt action pipe guns and pipe revolvers all benefit from both pistol/rifle perks.  At least until someone at Bethesda sees this post.
---
Yes, explore!
---
How many atoms for this crappy challenge now?
---
If you claim a workshop, you're a Target.
---
Sure, it costs them caps to contest, but they're not in it for the money.
---
They just want to see you die...
---
I mean I just do it for the workshop Bc I need the materials killing a low level isn’t fun in the slightest.
---
To get some extra Bang out of my old Weightless Set I made my 76 jumpsuit shielded for the extra E,I,C,L when I went to Unyielding - have you made a Shielded BOS or Enclave Underarmor yet?
---
Not on Xbox but upvoted for visibility
---
Yep there's a truck nearby with same kind of cabinet. 
---
I guess Ill have to check next time in Watoga. But it's so strange if it's always there and I just now started to wonder it.
---
Your rifles weighs 120 lbs? What mods are you running on that thing?
---
Just dont see the fun in killing someone 200 levels under you in one hit
---
Did you try it out yet fam?
---
Ive got a melee i built, and shes perked to be bloodied, and full unyeilding armor, but i usually run her at full health and as i fight and she takes damage she gets stronger but i just cant get over being low health fulltime kinda thing.
---
That is literally the best weapon in the game if it's max level. People will sell entire INVENTORIES for it, and I would 100% respec your perk cards and make a build around it, as you will destroy everything. You didn't just get a god-roll, you got the fucking golden platinum diamond messiah master of all weapons
---
So... I just launched again and the server didn’t crap out. We have about 8 people above and three in the burrows and the spawns have all died down but! No dead enemies and it was fun. 
---
Seems server side.
---
Yeah but all of the raiders are dead, unless of course you count the other players, which you're intending to attract to your base.
---
my thoughts too. Even if i do slightly less damage on a single target, having the vampire effect as a cherry on top makes this one better
---
just wanted to get some opinions on it since its hard to test
---
Not yet. Been out of the house all day. It’ll probably be another hour or two.
---
Pet gatorclaw? Seen gators in WV. Wild and knew someone who had one as a pet so yes, one gator claw pet please. Even if it's a baby
---
Sentinel and Assassin doesn’t matter. You still get one shotted regardless.
---
Just stuped  to me to go after someone 200 levels under you.
---
Press on the right trigger while in your pip boy hovering over the item to inspect the item and view all of its legendary attributes.
---
Glowing Deathclaws were supposed to be the deadliest.....lvl 90+ etc. But can't say they're more than a minor threat :/
---
That's why I'm fine if they take the workshop but when they just seek me out to fuck with me despite me having absolutely no chance in the slightest of fight against them seems like a dick move lol
---
Thanks. Everyone can say that they have lost a plan...but they can compare my online time and see that I was online every day. Its very frustrating!!!
---
Junk.
---
Yeah I don't understand why they're so unresponsive. So many people stopped playing you think they'd want to try and keep as many players as they can not ignore and mistreat them.
---
A really good legendary pipe bolt action is still pretty damn awesome at end game.  I just did a trade for [this one](https://imgur.com/o9NTGe8) and it does considerably more damage than the instigating lever gun I was previously using, by 50+ points.  The ammo is everywhere, it weighs half as much as the lever gun and it's ridiculously cheap to repair.
---
The stuff I dont carry on me. Lol
---
I had the same issue, the next day I did the whole quest chain over again and it worked. Now I occasionally get the daily and it seems to work fine.
---
I mean if I do decide to fight them Bc they attack me I take off my armor if they’re below lvl 45 Bc I don’t use PA.
---
Then you're not with the right partner. Sounds like a junker to me.
---
One of the new faction Whitesprings Vendors always has it. Believe its the Freestates Vendor
---
They're like power cable tethered though right? Will batteries get crazy enough to run them? They power freakin teslas! People are working on electric planes too. 
---
I mean, I guess that why PA in-game runs on miniature fusion reactors. 
---
I mean how much power are we talking here? Like in volts/amps/ watts? Could you take something like a Tesla Power Wall (google), strap it to the back of a mech suit, and rock n' roll?
---
At the abandoned bog town workshop, there's a building adjacent to the workstation. The 2nd or 3rd floor of that building has 13 or so bags of concrete. That floor looks like it's under construction/renovation.
---
It's cool.  I have scrapper... just got my timing of Lucky Hole mine wrong and ended up with too much lead...  Will do the Uranium event when I can. :)
---
Anti-armor combined with that stabilized perk destroys, IMO.  I have an anti-armor Gatling gun  which is my go to weapon  for everyday  use. 
---
I have an Ultracite prime Gatling laser that I use just for the queen.
---
I have a friend who does heavy weapons primarily and melee for backup, knowing that all 5 heavy weapons he is carrying on his max strength character weigh less than one on the 2 rifles I carry is very irritating (that his backup melee weapons altogether are less than the other rifle only makes it worse).
---
Btw have you noticed these 'husks' - unkillable stationary players that seem to be afk? Servers seem to have trouble cleaning the ragequitting players out of map :D
---
No one ever attacks me who's at my level. I really never get people coming after me but the few times I do the kevel difference is retarded
---
Hey man, I don't have flux, but could I interest you in 10 ultracite for 2 serums? Specificly the marsupi and healing factor ones.
---
you are on pc, right?
---
Man, idk.... I just know the gun has the perk and still weighs 12 pounds. It's just another thing Bethesda needs to fix.
---
Spiral staircases that fit within the area of one floor piece.
---
Username isn’t my gt
---
it doesn't take a genius to know you shouldn't need permission to spend an insignificant amount of your own money
---
That would increase server instability.  Maybe next year when things are more stable
---
Next dlc should have us go praise the Interloper
---
Killed an Attack Dog and got one. Hoping for a loyal pal to put this on one day.
---
Also the plant doesn't have nearly as much nuka cola as it should
---
Wrong place for this. Check fallout trading post
---
Get a hazmat suit and put it on before you walk all the way down the hallway that’s what I do
---
Automatic rifles do less damage but have higher DPS; you may kill your target 40% faster but will cost 15% more ammo. You could experiment with settings [here](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
When I shoot her with a bloodied combat rifle crit I see her health go down a bit. Noticable, regular. My bet is bloodied firerate or bloodied vatscrit bigguns are the most potent SBQ killers.
---
You MUST keep the pylons activated
---
So as a HUGE Nuka Cola fan (I'd say I'm on par with Sierra or maybe I'm a bigger fan...), I've spent a LOT of time in this place...going over every inch. What I've seen is...interesting. So up on the roof on the outside of the little "room" (the one with a living room/fridge/bed set up that has a cap stash in it) is one of those power boxes. Also on the outside there's power thingys (the ones you hook wires into to go along your house to supply power to all over your house) as well. Makes me wonder if they planned to make this into a workshop or something at some point. It would make a cool workshop.
---
I would love if they added more to this location.
---
But as for any thing Quantum related...honestly there shouldn't even be Quantum in 76. By FO3 lore, it was JUST released as a test to only a few prime locations in the FO3 area (D.C.) right before the bombs dropped. It doesn't make sense for FO4 or 76 to have any Quantum at all.
---
I love Quantum (even more then the normal Nuka Cola), but I'd still prefer if they stuck to their lore and got rid of it from these games.
---
Its beyond stupid, and this guy has it right. They're scared to be on an equal playing field cause they know they're likely to meet a player with the same or better buld. I always try to take out the wanted/griefer guy in the lobby that just wants to cause trouble. Pvp needs to be in survival only and only workshops/Hunter V. Hunted thing.
---
Already got in it was the other guy that was offline
---
I bet that bag was JUICY. who carries 700 lead???
---
Pretty sure this is related to the same problems with mobs that have been around a long time. Occasionally see that assault rifle on the ground in a random spot it doesn't belong?  Nearby there are 6 max level super mutants with no weapons punching at you. Occasionally kill a mob and the weapon falls out on the ground and you cant pick it up, or it disappears and is in the corpse loot container. Random nuke code lying on the ground beeping but you can't pick it up. 
---
I am suspecting these are related issues with inventory containers and its affecting mobs and players now. It absoloutley has gotten worse since the last patch. I have not lost anything yet myself but I am coming across more and more groups of Super Mutants who are mostly all unarmed. I went to Westtek the other day and only two of the Super mutants out front had a weapon, the rest were unarmed. They all run up to you and put their hands together and swing hands over their heads double fisted at you a lot. I did for sure see one assault rifle lying on the ground at the steps.
---
I have two as well, I use the vamp exploding on the queen until she’s halfway down her life after the regen... then I switch to an executioner explosion which does more damage when the enemy has 40% or less health and it’s so effective
---
Stack up more good husband points and maybe her boyfriend will buy you a Switch next.
---
It would be cool to be able to skin in Nuka world spray paint colors/schemes. Also different finishes: parkerized, chrome, gold, bling (cheesy I know), camo, and Cerakote. I'd like to see a steampunk skin/mods for the gatling and black powder rifles (they already are period pieces, just looking for a fancier or gadgety look to some of the accents on these weapons).
---
This would allow anyone to match their character's outfit and earn BSG come $$ int the Atom store.
---
People are nuking Harper's Ferry because it also nukes the Burrows underneath, turning it into a pretty sweet zone for grinding XP.
---
If I high level player contests a level 24’s workshop, most likely it’s for your scrap.
---
I know that, doesn't stop other players still trying to kill it while it's cloaked.
---
All I'll say to this is nuking the burrows is waaaaay more fun than Whitesprings or SBQ IMHO. Everything is contained, respawn rates aren't bad, and the final "boss" with here 10 Mr. Gutsy's makes for a pretty challenging fight if you are out of power armor and don't rely on a build that prevents you from taking damage.
---
Ooh. Is it still up? We’re ready to go
---
I haven't seen an egg on the shop in three days.
---
I mean it’s both tbh lol. Low lvls getting in one hit then running off to watch and then people just joining Bc it’s a new event and not actually knowing wth to do.
---
I only cap workshops for the defense missions for the exp then anyone can have it. He followed me to the defense missions then contested and killed me making me unable to compete the mission lol
---
He died on his shield.  I shall pour out a sip of my 40 in his honor while blasting "It's So Hard To Say Goodbye" by Boyz2Men.  [Here's the link if you want to join in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6m-nhUcos).
---
Wow, nice roll.
---
I have 3 high level characters and I dont fuck with low levels. Its pointless to me
---
It’s over I’m afraid the zones up but everything is dead u can try going over there
---
I’m just telling you what it most likely is.
---
Yeah. There's no way that's working. Unless the reduction only works on the unmodded parts of the model.
---
It would be great if you could buy the stable flux from vendors, it would both allow you to sell more junk, and give you the supplies to craft serums as a concentrated  value to storage weight object.
---
Been fighting with disconnections since the launch of the game, last month some staff of bethesda forun finally replied me with the ports to be open in order to get a better connection.
---
These are the ports required by FO76
---
TCP: 1935,3478-3480.
---
UDP: 3000-3010,3074,3478-3479.
---
Since i opened those port connections my connection improved, still got a fixed dc every 2hrs of gameplay but i think its my side to blame.
---
Like i mentioned this info was provided by some staff on the official foruns so its safe.
---
Hope it helps like it helped me.
---
And add a robobrain Manuel!
---
I made fun of all my friends for doing that. Then last week I did the same thing. I'm level 185.
---
Damn. Well let me know if one drops in your lobby
---
Yes people still haven't done the event surprisingly. Few days ago i made several keycard for the event so i looked around the session and saw a level 180, 110, 170, messaged them can you help with the event they said sure but also said I've not done it before. I've noticed when i hop on late PST the sessions aren't as active for events than the ones in the afternoon. 
---
Also even after making the keycard you still need to jump sessions to find a lobby that doesn't have cool down time. I hyped everyone up to find out i had to jump 3 sessions then spam invite people
---
All I lost was caps because I dont carry my junk around
---
I STILL have a huge crush on Hope Sandoval.  She was a young emo kid's wet dream.
---
Used for many rare crafting plans, including prime gear and the decontamination arch.
---
Oh okay. Probably user error on my part. Still sorta new to the game. Ill check when I get home.
---
I have all (or access to all if we swap in team) interesting sets this game has. Assassin sentinel, assasin cavalier, unyielding sentinel, unyielding cavalier, weightless sentinel. I favor none of those. I run with an unyielding/assassin/chameleon/regenerating prefixes, and cavalier/harder to detect while sneaking myself and I like it the most. Sentinel is useless against vats hence I crouch all the time, cavalier at least gives me something when I have to GTFO to a better position. Harder to detect while sneaking is also useful as it allows you to be in the middle of monster pack and not be discovered. Sometimes its good to move where enemies don't expect you (they see unaggroed mobs there).
---
Than I instantly die to colonel gutsys or assultyons
---
I’m not someone who has any friends who play fallout 76 and I don’t watch any vids about they game so I’m pretty disappointed that I never knew until now. Thank you op for posting about this, I would have never found out otherwise. I’ve been doing a pistol build and my pipe revolver has been my go-to but it’s still not very good.
---
Agreed, same thing happened to me by a sneak build, caught me off guard and ever since then i dont even bother if i see someome closing in on me or at it at all.
---
If your on PS4 and ever need help let me know, Me and two buddies usually mow through the sheep bot by ourselves
---
Really wish we could put stocks on the .44 and western revolver
---
Whether you carry junk or not, that’s most likely what they were hoping to get out of you. I’m level 216 and if that was my mindset that would be the only reason I would grief a lower level.
---
On Xbox unfortunately :(
---
Yes, and that's why I alternatively suggest another location within Whitesprings with it's own loading zone. Whitesprings interior just has too much to rendor and it affects performance.
---
Just grab lots of stimpacks and activate all 3 pylons yourself. People may have no idea about the fight but they'll have no trouble downing the boss once the shield's gone
---
I love it! 
---
Just a moment of silence in remembrance of Andrew Sachs. Manuel wouldn’t have been the same without him!
---
Use iron clad and radicool I never seem to have a problem and my health is normally at 80hp or less
---
The workshop defense are good exp for low levels and people like this make it so they dont want to bother with workshops
---
I know right?  The guy basically gave it away, too.
---
She’s hot for sure.
---
4 of them so far yes, 5th going to be up tonight at 8pm EDT (2:30hrs from now)
---
What do you hope to gain junk wise? Not like iv got 100s of pounds of bulk on me. Should you have shit at that level?  Lol
---
Also you can use the terminal to disable the targeting restrictions from the turrets and they’ll kill most of the ads
---
So basically nukalurks?
---
I don't know where it is , I've looked at the location recently , where is it?
---
Check the atomic shop if their in the decorations tab to claim them
---
I think I worked out why it happened for me. The daily challenges change an hour before the server downtime for maintainence. Then they change *again* after the servers come up. I thought I'd found a cheeky way to get more atoms by doing a couple of them in that hour and then they change after... and I can do the new ones too.
---
Well it worked. But it seems they (the ones that were up for an hour) then came back the next day... when I'd already finished them.
---
Hope this makes sense.
---
Or... people can come take your stuff because they know you are over encumbered. 😅
---
Some people do. Case and point: The Encriptid Event
---
I just did this. Lvl 48 and used a sledge (melee build). Did it and got a few caps for my troubles and 10 mins later the quest popped up again. Dumb.
---
It's a bull
---
Poor souls
---
nope. mine disappeared when i went into the white springs bunker after i completed a daily event with the gun. 
---
it was favorited, i went thorugh the loading zone and all, then after walking around the bunker for a min i ckecked my inventory/favorites wheel and it was gone
---
Theresa is bit@#
---
I’ve tried scrapping the producer and building another one, but the Brahmin still wouldn’t let me milk it. Did I get two bulls in a row?
---
I've reviewed your post history and am happy to announce that you are thoroughly a cuck and your wife fucks other men.
---
Patch caused that. I am also missing that one for now, they have said they are aware of it and going to fix it.
---
They need to make it into a worshop where you can make nuka cola.
---
World full
---
Nobody really shits on them in eso tbh.
---
Meh, no worries. If I had a gaming PC, I'd definitely be playing this on PC.
---
You can place Concrete stairs from far harbor(?) in FO4 to be in left, middle or right
---
I just want concrete build materials overall
---
Bonus points cause Burrows was literally already in the game last week. They just only made it accessible this week, so it'd count as weekly content
---
But hey, some people just want to see the world burn.
---
No I didn’t
---
Check train station suitcases, people dump a lot of stuff in them.
---
Don't freak out if a high level player shoots the ground near you, usually its to get your attention to some stuff they have dropped for you.
---
Soup satisfies both hunger and thirst.
---
Dont prepare too much food it goes off over time.
---
Learn how to properly deploy power armor so it can't be stolen.
---
Just a few things I have learnt in my week and a half with the game.
---
It wont always give it to you. there is a percent chance of it giving milk
---
True. Hell this is the first time I got annoyed enough to post anything
---
I'm in
---
Oh that's going to improve my bloodied +33% vats hit chance pipe bolt action
---
Considering I can make caps rather easily by just farming junk, and that I have looted the Gauss plans quite a few times already (three at least)... Considering I just found another plan a day or two ago, I'll just give it to you, just so long as you promise to pay-it-forward in the future by occasionally giving away plans that you've already learned. :)
---
*(Genuinely sorry to take away a plausible sale, yet unlikely given his cap's balance, as I know my kindness may in turn be considered 'mean' towards you... heh)*
---
OP, send a friend request to **Formula350** (*no* underscore) and if the server gods smile upon you, I'll be able to add you *(the Social tab has been a bit moody after patch 8)*.
---
I'll be logging into 76 in just a moment.
---
Big respect to your tastes,
---
but I still find kind of weird.
---
It's survival. Why am I not allowed to shoot them in the first place?
---
It really feela like there's a magical barrier that suddenly disappears, and when that happens, it's a trigger race.
---
So... Do you want players to collaborate or not?
---
If you want... Ok, it's fine, but give people the time to collect the rewards (and to save them).
---
You don't want to? It's also fine, but then let me shoot them immediately.
---
Id like this if just for fun.
---
A couple times while in group. Was in survival shooting at players and the others in the group are like what are you shooting? They couldn't see them.
---
Definitely
---
I think as long as it fits thematically, and doesn't break immersion (even more), I don't see the issue with having pet versions of things that already exists in the game. I think considering the lack of humans in Appalachia, it would make sense for vault dwellers to have pets to battle crippling depression and loneliness :P  
---
Just for the love of god let me walk through them. \*Dogmeat blocking the door while I'm getting murdered outside.\*
---
I've tried that but my health drops crazy fast
---
Actually it’s for your junk most times people at that level often don’t use stash boxes..I’m a raider not a griefer and I often do this when I’m in need of some fast junk it’s just easier
---
Alright. Tell me when dude.
---
What ever flouts your boat
---
Yeah, PA with shocks is what I've been doing. I'm just curious as to the reasoning. Why would they leave rifles out and then make them SO heavy? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I carry a Gatling gun, a Gatling plasma, a .50 Cal, an LMG, and sometimes a minigun, and using Bear Arms all together they weigh less than a single sniper/assault/combat/or gauss rifle. And Rifleman and Commando &amp; Tank Killer perks don't help the Heavy Guns. 
---
I'm just not following the logic.
---
I’ve tried multiple times to milk it, I guess I’ve just had a 18-carat run of bad luck.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland
---
Another one? On fire man
---
I know planty of people that level and have 3 characters around that and guess what. the stash box is still used. Why not use it? To be a dick?
---
&gt;Formula350
---
Thank you man! I will add you in a minute! And sure, I will pay forward from next time! And I have 500c on me right now if you want it!
---
UK time zone
---
It would be great if I could repair my gronok (probably misspelled) ax past 100% as well.
---
Look, I’ve been there. I have a lower level character too. The other day I claimed a workshop just for the experience and left to continue exploring. Ten minutes later I get an even stating that my worship is under attack. I pay it no mind because of course at level 35 I’m in now position for pvp. A few moments later I hear the sound of a stealth boy and just like that I’m dead. This was in adventure. I wasn’t bothering anybody. Nevertheless, when I claimed that workshop I became a target for farming. This isn’t new, but it’s a little more frequent since they’ve nerf survival.
---
* Reduced enemy damage effect is not that hot. One of the worst mods you can roll.
---
* Bashing damage is plain useless. Again, there are far better mods that could be replacing it.
---
* \+1 PER is actually really useful for a ranged character, especially if they are using VATS a lot.
---
Overall this weapon is below average. Not worth keeping.
---
I also think we neew the planters to grow fruit and vegetable on the roof or a floor. With that the glass green house wall would fit perfectly and would be very nice to enjoy the natural light during the day. Smaller stairs or a ladder to put in a tower of one wall by one wall would be pretty usefull. More recipe like the vegetable starch would be nice to make the gardening more relevant
---
Ah damn, I am in NZ so its about a 12 hour time difference.
---
Nice leg.  Which hat is that?
---
No. The moment you copy the esm file Todd Howard busts your door down.
---
Literally nobody would have ever known you'd have shared the esm if you didn't make this post.
---
Lol but cooking oil scraps :(
---
been looking for hours you rock!
---
People keep saying they want my junk but that was definitely not the case seeing as how after the first time he killed me I droped nothing and he continued to come after me. I didn't even have caps.  This is just someone being a grade a dick
---
Welcome to the post apocalyptic game designed for players to socialize and fight against enemies together but in reality, seeing another players is almost as rare as seeing a cryptid
---
You may be right, but to me that's a very week reason (not against you but against Bethesda). They already put a limit on Caps, so what's the point?
---
You're welcome!
---
Yeah. If that’s the case, he just wanted to use you for his entertainment.
---
Mothman omelettes sell for the most!  I sell a lot of those and tons of chems since I rarely use anything but psychobuff and grape mentats
---
How is tse a god roll after the nerf. I mean its still very good if you have the perks to buff damage but there are better drops for a handmade.
---
I will never understand what's entertaining about it but oh well
---
I thought this one isn’t going away (?)
---
I demand a baby sheepsquatch
---
This works! Just have to try to inch as close as you can to your bag without falling in
---
Honestly have no idea
---
With Bear Arms my .50 weighs 1.8 lbs. But an assault rifle with a suppressor weighs 23 lbs and does way less damage. It's just crazy.
---
Whitesprings golf club shower room thing also has 3 roaches, free states bunkers usually also have some roaches in them
---
This game is more of a test for Bethesda to see if they can do online games. Most likely for the next Elder Scrolls game to have a multiplayer option.
---
Even with the Roadmap guiding us, I fail to see the direction this game is taking. The Burrows update just goes to show that they have no idea what the end game should look like. Most seasoned players are getting burned out quick from lack of content and will stop playing until the next update brings something fresh.
---
You stole my line 🤣
---
Thanks man! For the trade! thanks a lot!
---
It's still +50% damage with both perks, isn't it? That's quite a lot
---
darn. Hoping it would help boost damage from my ultracite laser pistol with a stock mod attached....
---
This is awesome! Unscripted Fight clubs were the best part of Red Dead Online until I completely gave up on it. Would love to see a Fallout fight club too.
---
Hey come tonight I’m on now for a trade if you have any questions or want to talk
---
yeah its good but this guy oversold it. You can get a lot higher damage with something like bloodied or furious, and better armour penetration with aa or something.
---
I run multiple mutes and dont use starched genes or class freak. I've gotten good at avoiding rads and I do toggle sunkissed on and off as needed. Brahmin milk and Nuka Grape are helpful.
---
If I get a mute I don't want I have to start rolling the dice with radaway, but serums are easy to get.
---
The 90% weigh reduction only applies to the weapon’s base weight. Mod weights are not reduced.
---
My guess is that stealth sniper builds have been consistently popular with Bethesda's titles for ages.  I played them in all of Bethesda's Fallout and Elder Scrolls games, with the only difference being my character having a gun or a bow.  I think the initial design was to make the Achilles heel of the sniper be a significantly reduced carry weight.
---
OP power builds existed in Skyrim, Fallout 4 and earlier titles, but 76 is the first time that players are competing with each other with said builds.  I think Bethesda assumed that a large portion of the player base would opt into sniping by default, which is probably true, and somewhat carelessly buffed up other weapons classes with really nice perks without offering much of anything new for the snipers.
---
On one hand, I think it's great that I see such a variety of play styles ranging from creepy clown/furry costume with a mole miner gauntlet all the way to quantum-painted X-01 with a 50cal.  Variety is the spice of life, and it's excellent to be able to roll up viable and strong characters in a variety of styles.
---
On the other, snipers are GREAT at being solo, but not awesome in situations where group play and sharing is involved.  It's hard to tag enemies at a Whitespring nuke without a gun with an explosive AoE effect, and good melee builds can steamroll through a pile of enemies really quickly.
---
Stealth is strong, rifles are good, but the slower pace to maintain and very intensive perk requirements to maintain "peak performance" is certainly a drawback.  Even if a new card was added for rifle weight reduction, I don't think I'd have room in my build for it.  Between rifle, stealth, all-purpose damage buffs and a dip into VATS related perks, I don't have much wiggle room.  I could maybe swap 2-3 points tops.
---
Read my other replies. Had excess from too many Lucky Hole runs close together...
---
The point was the actions of someone and the timing. I could replace that lead in 10-15 minutes...
---
Working for a couple more hours then Ill be on. GT is same as U/ without the space. Ill add you when Im online.
---
Sell them to normal vendors, start with useless ones first. After opening up enough space you can wait for mole man vendor to open his shop
---
Great see you then
---
There is none. Anyone can farm junk, especially if you're high level. I always help defend workshops, and leave. What's the point of killing someone for 25 steel and 2 abraxo?
---
I thought I was the only one! I stumbled into an invincible liberator bot in Camden Park and battled it for a solid 10 minutes before I left the server. Except the health bar in the liberator bot would decrease as I shot it and immediately refill.
---
Right? Lol I only use workshops for exp anyways
---
I ended up with 2k steel from doing treasure maps. The tips in that video go perfectly with what I was envisioning for what I want to build.
---
Indeed, Bloodied/Furious/Anti-Armour are far better than Two-Shot.
---
It's a rare spawn from Grahm and given how rare he is himself, it is very hard lol
---
And sweet sweet plans. What possible useful junk could someone who has invested hundreds of hours into the game get from someone who's 100+ levels below them? At some point you can only make so many excuses.
---
I usually just try it once every time I visit my camp.
---
Well its worth a shot atleast. Heard other people had nothing special in burrows if they target Harpers Ferry or anything around but when they hit directly at one of the burrows manholes. They suddendly got bloated glowing ones. 
---
Im atleast gonna make sure I target one of the manholes if I nuke it. Harpers Ferry gets the nuke effects anyway just seems to bug out burrows.
---
They've already announced a fix for it.  Next week.
---
Nice! There's even ways to "glitch" floating pieces that I learned from there, makes for a cool floating room at times.
---
My biggest problem is I know advanced building tips but not the bare basics
---
Yeah I use to play as a raider and never picked on anyone lower then my level. The raider excuses is just that an excuse for being a spineless dick who doesnt want to possibly be beaten by there pray
---
Good to know.  I guess.  I must have missed that announcement.  This seems like the type of thing that they've done hot fixes for in the past the day after a patch was released.
---
Yeah, I agree, it's possible this buff isn't what it used to be.
---
When Scorched Earth happens at Fissure Site Prime, I actually get the notification clear over at Watoga Station, which is what prompted the question in the first place.  If you picture a radius that large, you can imagine that a lot of players would count toward this.
---
Try to put on the melee weapon skill under intelligence to see if that works. I had that problem once and just put the skill on. From there I was able to add it.
---
THIS. THIS. THIS.
---
That data mine information seems plausible.
---
Ill take some
---
If you're on PS4 I can craft you a handmade, fully modded. No charge
---
That is mentioned in the bug thread and they said it will be addressed in a future update.
---
What is it ?
---
like a house robot or mole man that collects stuff when your gone
---
Why do you need your wife’s permission to buy something? Aren’t you a grown adult?
---
You mean makeshift warrior? Yeah I had that on.  I put it on and it went though the motions as if it had successfully been done and then...  nope,
---
True, but max White Knight and max Fix it Good is essentially 400% durability with-60% durability loss. Bit of an investment, but with wetsuit and sentry helmet it looks badass
---
Maybe the bunker is inside the burrows, and we're going to get inside with another patch. New material keeps showing up all over Appalachia without fanfare. I like that, because quest mobs are no fun for anyone.
---
PS4
---
Can confirm.  Xbox One
---
44 pistol with medics, reduced ap cost, and ap refresh speed
---
Lvl 9 jumping into a nuke zone?  That's a bold move.  I respect your No Fucks Given attitude.
---
If they do NPCs I hope they add them in a separate mode that you can only access after you've co.pleted the main quest. That way itd be lore friendly to why people returned to Appalachia after the scorched were taken care of(also would add insite to the more "fresh" dead traveling merchants... they came a little to early.)
---
Junk
---
Because low levels have so much junk right?
---
If you have advanced power connectors plan learned, it adds a bunch of items you can build. Just have to go through them all cause there's so many
---
There is one in the workshop mode. Jutlst hasn't been released yet
---
Sentry Bot helmet looks badass on it, so does assaultron. It's not marine helmet, but it's close enough
---
I appreciate you, sir or madam.
---
You need plenty of Stimpacks, and you might consider investing in the Field Surgeon perk which causes Stimpacks to heal at a much faster rate than they normally do.
---
The thing is, I think she prioritizes going after conduits in the battle.  She'll start barrelling after me and it's very hard to shake her, which is why I think many conduits just bolt for the rooftop (or what remains of it) of the shack.
---
the doors literally say "requires tnt dome key xx"
---
Smh that’s my point.
---
Not outside vats range.
---
The use of 400 there is this new thing called a "hyperbole." Most of us learned that in Elementary English. 
---
In reality, I carry between 35 to 50 bulk steel, which is at most 1500, a realistic amount needed for crafting ammo. Goddamn, everything you say just makes you sound stupider.
---
If your on pc there’s a mid for that
---
That leg looks dolphin smooth.  Mmmmm.
---
No much, 500-1000 caps
---
Oh yeah.
---
you literally said you can't find out what they are because they aren't in the wiki
---
which they are, btw.
---
Hey, trade you for the 60 chemistry bench plans I got over the past week? XD. /s
---
One of the problems I notice is that when you fast travel there after it begins, it takes quite a while for the quest to update the pylons and conduits.  Usually, all the pylons will appear to be off, but you can't interact with them because they are actually on.  The information doesn't seem to update until Chakotay stops babbling.
---
Lvl 20 - 50 my modded pipe revolver was the best weapon I had (dmg, fire rate, cost to maintain) and it put out surprising damage.  I have a set of pipe weapon perk cards that sit fallow now, but during the time I was using my pipe pistol it really was a good weapon.
---
add me!  Im always looking to do quests and just explore the map :) Gamer Tag: awheaton65  Ill be on in a couple hours
---
Have you maybe tried to see if a friend can add it? I’m assuming so. Never hurts to try.
---
You're probably better off ditching thru-hiker and going all in on Adrenaline
---
White wolf fedora from the cryptid event. I love the wolf head embossed on the side myself.
---
Then why was I being told you can’t find it by googling it? All I said to begin with is it’s not a mysterious location.
---
I don't want share the file, I wanted to know if it's allowed for others to share this file with me so I can use it as a reference for my mod.
---
Now this is the reason that the chassis' are weighed at like 10 pounds
---
Quite possibly the best hat in the game imho
---
Ooohh...that's a good idea. Some of the PA mod plans are really expensive. Also, for the life of me I can't find T-51b Power Armor plans (not the mods, the actual plans to craft the armor pieces).
---
you done the one that starts at the water park
---
¿Qué?
---
glad I'm not the only one who got click baited into FO76. I was extremely confused until I saw what I was looking at..
---
only issue is im constantly carrying 40+ purified water for adhesive and diluted stimpak crafting
---
Im free now if your online my gt is l3IGl3OSS
---
Recon Marine Armor actually exists too (in basic prototype phase).
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBcM8161ihE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBcM8161ihE)
---
I’m a stealth rifleman as well.
---
My handmade is 24 lbs, my .308 is 18, my lever action is 16?..
---
My combat shotgun.. 
---
rifleman need some appreciation.l
---
You can still see if the impostor is cloaked or not
---
If you’re on ps4 im interested in the gatling! :3
---
Still better plot than Twilight. Is that still usable?
---
Here's my [little treasure from West-Tek](https://imgur.com/E2qqgoL) today.  It's up for trade if anyone likes it.
---
West-tek has been a little secret for a while now.  I can't lie and say I'm not a bit bummed to find it completely cleared **much** more often now.
---
My new daily spins include the Whitespring (old faithful), West-tek and Harper's Ferry, both topside and the Burrows.  Dyer Chemical and Robco are good too, at the risk of blowing up more honeyholes.
---
Happened to me last night in the burrows. Killed a ghoul, watched a legendary armor appear in the corpse's inventory for like a half second and then the body disappeared!
---
I had trouble with some of these also. Just keep doing them and they should pop.
---
How many eggs have been released as of today ?
---
I didn’t even go anywhere near whitesprings until around level 25 lol
---
I know what you mean.  I have a couple 3\* weapons like this, where I'm sure they'd be badass for the right person, but aren't that useful for me.  Maybe someday when I have enough, I'll make a "Legendaries looking for good homes" post, because I'd prefer they go to someone who actually wants to use them.
---
No! He is the Free States Bot in Harper's Ferry. Now the Burrows is in operation he has even more nice stuff. ;)
---
I'll be sure to give him a 21 gun salute next time I log on.
---
Wakestrider, level 62. More of a relaxed player then a rush type one.
---
Yeah, it's rough at the mid level range.. Once you get up to the higher levels you'll always have a surplus of stimpaks and won't need to delude them anymore. You'll also be able to just leave your water in your purifiers for the most part.
---
Well it's a camp item so definitely. And object display, weapon and armor displays are meant to be coming soon
---
Anyone on PS4 do this??? 👀 😎
---
Lmao, Mason, Ohio is like a place and Kings Island is in it. (Kings Island's a p' lit amusement park) I can understand the confusion tho
---
Look around toxic Larry meat and go, and the southern Belle hotel.
---
Worst part is when you find one of these little shits in your camp.
---
I can't speak for other people, but I know that I personally don't generally talk unless it's with someone I know in real life. For me, it's similar to talking on the phone. I just feel more comfortable being silent. With that said, if it's someone I'm friends with on the PSN and we've already agreed to play a game, I'd be more willing to plug in my headset and talk to them. I dunno, that's just me. I'm not sure about other people though.
---
I'd say one thing that many people have already said - there isn't a "No" that doesn't look like you're being a dick to the other person.
---
Does that event still only drop level 40 stuff?
---
My gf refuses to let me buy this game for her.
---
Just completed that a few minutes ago 👍
---
Sorry, where abouts on the map are they?
---
Lol Im level 30 and I had a 150+ do this to me. He killed me and stole my scrap, and continued contesting the workshop. I have a melee build and was able to run up to him and cut him down real quick before he could shoot me. Took my scrap back, plus alot of his own scrap and quickly put them into the stash box. He killed me again but I could tell he was pissed I didnt drop scrap. He put on power armor and kept trying to get me to find him again. He even invited me to his party so he could call me a bitch for stealing his scrap. Gave him a thumbs down and let him have the workshop, knowing I won this time.
---
Grab pannapictagraphist and hope you have good RNG.
---
Because THAT would make sense. And they got Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh before they sat down and started coming up with weights for things in this game.
---
Buy her dinner first
---
They gotta shoot through a half way, a full wall and a door to get to my generator from the outside. 3 stories from the ground.
---
Or they gotta shoot through 4 doors and a garage door to get in through inside.
---
I've had a bag follow me through a fast travel. Dropped some stuff, fast travel, dropped some more garbage, and the items from the first bag appeared in the second miles away. Might have been due to lag or other, and I would not guarantee this to work on a regular basis.
---
Don’t u have to be  45 to get a excavation suit
---
Indeed.  Just gave away a bloodied sledge to a lower level and two auto stim drops as well.  Hope it pops up again.  My favorite event.
---
Buy a lottery ticket now - just been through Westek nothing just some 1 * armour and I’m lvl 180 this game is just random $#&amp;*@ glad you got one finally :-)
---
I'm a fan of using trailers and buses as homes, but I'd also take those white and orange pods we see dotted around industrial buildings and bases. There's also that one popout trailer in the Morgantown Airport, the one with the curved glass panels? It's like the only one in the entire game and I'm surprised it's not buildable!
---
Is that so?
---
I'm screwing around with a gunslinger build so pvp isnt exactly an area I'll be good in on this character lol
---
TSE is still good, but the accuracy hit on 2-shot is pretty harsh.  80% of the time only one of your bullets is hitting, especially if the target is moving, so the 2-shot effect really only applies to enemies that are standing still.  Personally, [bloodied/explosive](https://imgur.com/2OdeTK9) or [anti-armor/explosive](https://imgur.com/4iTeMDI) is a much better option.  [Instigating/explosive](https://imgur.com/o9NTGe8) is outrageous for PvE.  I'm still hunting for the instigating/+10% damage while aiming rifle to avoid hitting nearby enemy health with explosive AoE damage and negating the instigating effect.  There's very few enemies in the game (including players) than can take more than one headshot with a VATS crit from an AA/E rifle.
---
I think Canned Coffee is a guaranteed spawn in one of the Raider train stations - possibly R&amp;G?  I've seen it many times.
---
They can't.  Both are utility mods and use the same mod slot.
---
If you're on Xbox, I can help.  I'm 175, main melee build with one handed meat hook with extra hook as my main weapon.  Use all 3 gladiator perks, martial artist and iron fist.  I'll be on later tonight gt: GoodNewsEvery01, and that's a zero, not and o.
---
Congrats on the find! I felt the same way I finally got an explosive double barrel. For my TSE handmade I usually run demo expert maxed, all 3 rifleman cards maxed, and grenadier. I have mine with the hardened receiver and not an automatic receiver, long barrel, and a red dot. It comes in very handy with SB until they land.
---
Hmmm,  need to figure out how to 3D print a life size one of these and mount it above the bed in the guest bedroom.
---
They messed up with patch 8 mods are broken so that’s why it’s not working.
---
Applying mods to weapons/armor is broken right now, you’ve got to wait till next patch to do so
---
As has been stated nearly 10,000 times in the past two weeks, mods broke with a recent update.  There is a fix coming next week.
---
It’s not! The event is part of the endgame for us now :-)
---
this gets a lol
---
I stay at around 50% rads just for max damage at all times so more of a glass cannon type build and I run melee as well my most prized possession is a bloodied ski sword with both power attack perks (+40% damage when power attacking and take 40% less damage when power attacking) and its a BEAST So almost like a glass cannon tank haha I'm sure you get what I mean
---
At one point some high level players (100+) took my workshop, killed me, and teabagged me. I wasn't even fighting back! I was just waving to them and they kept murdering me. They took my workshop and placed lots of huge generators and other high-quality items in the workshop. But, thanks to me being friendly, they invited me to their team. Once they left the area, I left the team, contested the workshop, and took it back. I stored their generators before they got a chance to come back and kill me. They got the workshop back, but at the cost of many fusion generators, turrets, traps, and other things. 😈
---
Google is your friend, I dunno right now I'm not on.
---
I bet 100% they will be added as quests or atomic shop. They added them into the game and are unusable for any real reason right now, it would be a waste of resources for them not to be used down the line.
---
My husband and I got a 2nd tv from a pawn shop and another xbox so we could play together. We have one tv mounted on the wall above the other so we can sit on the couch and explore together.
---
I want to be mad at the money we spent but we've spent so much time exploring together and going on "Wasteland dates" I can't be mad. I'm disabled so it gives us a little more we can do together within my abilities.
---
I wouldn’t mind an invulnerable/respawning pet dog or cat at my camp. Wouldn’t need to collect anything, just be there for flavor.
---
Yep I do that also
---
One day I had a Free Random Legendary giveaway and even then some people complained about what I gave them for free
---
I love how effective melee is with PVP. I have gladiator at level 3 and martial artist level 3 and if I can get within range I normally win the fight.
---
Looks awesome but in no way am I ever going to accept an invitation to 'dinner' :)
---
My main is a stealth sniper and melee users never get close enough to me lol
---
Yep, but it’s like 2-3 legendary enemies, it’s worth doing.
---
So, this is where the Sheepsquatch hangs out on it's days off....
---
Ya delete later.
---
Is it in the mezzanine level?
---
Haha this is why I also have marathon and moving target. It doesnt always work but sometimes I can bum rush snipers before they hit me.
---
So your wife calls all the shots?
---
And then I said, “biiitch...”
---
I one to 2 shot with vats crits lol but I'm dead usaly if they get to me even with my sent/assassin gear
---
If it gives you A "retrieve loot" quest, then it has fallen on the edge and can possibly be retrieved a few ways. 
---
If it generates no quest, it never drops a bag and bag drop is just vapor. No one has found a way to get that back as of yet unfortunately.
---
Hi. IGN ReinyDahlia1939. May I please have nuka cola quantum x01 paint and maruspial + bird bones. Have the mats all ready to go.
---
What games do you guys play together, out of curiosity?
---
That’s very pathetic. Your wife is a cunt.
---
Drop all the crap ones, which Im sure most are.  Save the rest and commit to being fat.  Fast traveling is overrated anyways..
---
His wife wears the pants.
---
Use a rad-x if you find yourself in a med heavy environment
---
Disable all your mutations
---
No, that would allow you to make infinite chems. You can turn a single stimpak into 4-5 diluted stimpaks with chemist and super duper, with a regular recipe of 2 diluted stimpaks into one you'd be able to turn 2 diluted into 2-3 regular stimpaks with chemist and super duper
---
Fix on tuesday and many have posted already is why
---
I dunno, having to be convinced by OP just so he can spend his own money doesn't sound very cool
---
30min break seem to have fixed it. It only happens to creatures related to the specific daily or week challenge. Like today kill 5 radroach. Soon as I approach one they just drop dead. Last week it only happened to squirrel and chicken and mega sloths. Almost like a sick joke from Bethesda... but then I would have to put on my tinfoil hat haha.
---
25
---
So I looked her in the eyes and I said [bitch](https://youtu.be/5LGEiIL1__s) I'm going to play this game whether you like it or not!
---
So make it need 5 radaway stock become 1. Or 10
---
I reached back like a pimp and I smacked that ho then her dad started yelling so I threw a right cross and knocked his old ass out. 
---
The boys in the 'hood are always hard you come takin that trash and they'll pull your card.
---
AFAIK the only way of currently triggering this is an automatic tesla rifle (maybe just shooting fast enough with a regular one). That will consistently trigger the damage bug. If this happened without a tesla gun, it's new
---
I know that but why is no one on here talling about it?
---
I second this, your wife is a bitch. I will add however, that youre a puss.
---
Cool story?
---
You're quite welcome. I'm in the same boat, in that I'm doing this by myself and without doing Internet research. I'm just discovering things naturally and enjoying the discovering. This was just too interesting not to share.
---
Yeah. Ive had shielded enclave forever. Never got the plans for the Bos one. I have all the other Bos plans...idk what happened to that one, but im pretty sure the stats are the same as the enclave one, right?   So im not gonna search the world over for it.
---
Every 5th post is "I can't mod XXXXXXX" everyone is man, it sucks, they basically have to be working on it :/
---
Nope, power armor mods can only be learned from plans or bought from vendors.
---
There's an amusing irony to that statement.
---
To be honest, I have a hell of a time locating the Imposter even on a good day.  I have a tendency to rely on where others are firing to try and locate a threat, but in this case, there's gunfire going everywhere because of all the additional robots that show up.
---
Yes, I listened to Mazzy Star too, mid-90s in college. And watched all of those same shows. It was better back then with fewer choices. You just accepted what you had. Don't get me wrong, I could never give up the internet now that I have it. But when I was a kid, all my reports were topics that began with A,B or C... aardvarks, Boston, cadmium... Because we only had the 3 encyclopedias they gave away for free at the supermarket and I was too lazy to bike to the library. And it was totally fine.
---
Xbox, but I appreciate the offer. =)
---
Baby Scorchbeast right here please!
---
Would you do it for 1k caps?
---
Have they actually stated that they have a fix or are you hopeful like me?
---
What about the ...  ugh farm in the forest with all the razor grain/corn?  I’ve also heard the area near the pumpkin house is pretty good
---
I think you ment Cool story bro 😂
---
Nope. you must learn them from dedicated plans. save up them caps
---
the bad press was really a shame to the games reputation.. very unfortunate
---
That definitely seems like a decent service, especially if your not bluffing about killing the queen in 10min. Considering how she keeps screwing me on her drops I've completely abandoned the idea of fighting her. If I had someone who is supposedly as good as you I'd reconsider going after her.
---
I was thinking more around 200 for silos if I am using their keycard. Maybe 200 plus mats for speed run. and queen kills are free, sheepsquatch kills should be free also.
---
[They've stated it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bf2ovw/unable_to_craft_or_install_mods_to_armor/elaixb1/?context=1000)
---
Well, the truth is, my wife is descended from Samurai and she survived shit like her mom smacking her in the face with a folding metal chair, being kicked down the stairs etc., so, even though I'm twice her size I will ***never*** hit her, even if she punches me in the face until her hand starts bleeding, I do not raise a fist to her - I let her let some of her demons out, then I tell her to stop.
---
Only if it flies around the outer edge of the camp and never lands.
---
This is also why I plan on making thrown explosives my secondary. chuck grenades from behind cover and make that sniper move away from the blast radius while I sprint at him like a psycho.
---
You should brag! I'm level 37. Still haven't found White Springs. Lol.
---
as much as this has been brought up, you’d think Bethesda would have made a comment somewhere yay or nay on it.  I have never seen a company as bad with communication to its customers as Bethesda.
---
I’m a bloodied “kamikaze” build. I take chunks off her hit bar.  I know a few buddies who can hit harder, but I think I do ok.
---
It's people like you that make this game so amazing.
---
Love!
---
Seriously. It's post after post after post about this.
---
ITT: people who understand and people who aren’t married.
---
Thanks if you’re interested stop by now I’m just making a few renovations and I’d love someone to help and give advice
---
There are more ghouls, I don't know about the constantly respawning thing though. I nuked it and one other player showed up. We seperately cleared the burrows, Harpers Ferry, and the few Super Mutant patrols in the area. After that nothing respawned for so long I got bored.
---
I don't mind the burrows, it could use a few more ghouls so that they really swarm you. And if they could respawn much faster then the Burrows would actually be my favorite spot. But currently you still need to server hop or mix it into a run where you do a few of the prime spots: Whitesprings, West Tek, Watoga, sometimes the Wedigo Cave and Uncanny Caverns can be ok too for a change.
---
There's armor mods in them.
---
Sounds legit, I'm struggling to make my heavy weapons build better( thanks to a total lack of legendary spwans and shit drop rates) so I haven't gotten much of a chance to try other builds.
---
Ooh, you on PS4? What are you looking to trade it for? Would you take caps?
---
Cadwell is one of favourite Elder Scrolls characters, seeing as he's essentially immortal I'd love to see him in ES6.
---
He died honourably. Still strapped in his armour, going down firing.
---
I'm a PC player, unfortunately.
---
There are 6-7 brahmins at Flatwoods and I only get milk from one or two each time.
---
Thanks a ton! It's right on the copper resource area to the right and above west-tek research center.
---
When I went to see BIV for my daily booze task I got more than enough cigarettes from the ashtrays in the main area.
---
why would a TSE handmade or any three star handmade be better than a three star or TSE lever or shotgun? i don't get the handmade hype / praise.
---
I used to do that, but i think they're great decor. the only thing i make sheds for is my fusion generator.
---
Awww dang it.
---
Big upvote, great idea!
---
Did did your Bull agree to it too? He won't let you clean up after he's finished if you keep this up.
---
From what I understand, there's one way up at the top of Tanagra Town in the SE corner of the Mire region.
---
I'm pretty sure the plans can be found at the BoS Watoga vendor (either in Watoga, or at its representative at Whitesprings).  It doesn't cost *that* much to craft your own once you have the plan.
---
It happened without a Tesla gun. I killed a few other mole rats and this one refused to die.
---
ooh, I might when I hop back on tomorrow!
---
That sounds interesting. How much if you also collect the key card?
---
It really was.
---
thank you!!
---
I'm glad to hear that, it used to not be the case.
---
Last time this happened to me, I hopped through 3 servers and then I finally gave up and went for ‘move for free’ option. 
---
Since I spawned near my previous Camp location (I always logout from Camp) I decided to check who took my slot and ... of course it was empty. 
---
Huh, nice glitch, I thought, plus I always wanted to  change the layout, so I placed my Camp device on the exact spot where it was. 
---
Went to Stored tab ... just to find out that I’m missing nearly ALL my crops (goodbye vegetable starch farm, goodbye carrot field), my generator is gone, half of my water purifiers are missing etc.  I lost about 30% of my stuff (no, I wasn’t near the budget limit), and not just another wooden foundation, no sir, freaking big and valuable stuff was gone. 
---
It is ridiculous that 5 months after launch this game is still full of stupid and rookie level bugs. I have a feeling that we have 3 underpaid developers and one part time QA working on this game, the rest of Beth staff are busy with the new Elder scrolls mobile or something. There is no other explanation.
---
I'd be fine with scrapping most of the current sorting options if I could sort by HP replenished, Hunger filled, Thirst filled.
---
Hmm good question. Seeing as I can buy them for 200 caps on the market 400 seems fair.
---
If you have friends who are also new yes
---
If you don’t have friends no
---
I have been to Tanagra Town countless times(at the spawn location I mean), but have never found the fist. \*unfortunate\*. I have 400 caps on me, so trade is not an option(with a in-game vendor that is). But thanks man, I will keep looking!
---
I don’t have any friends who play this game. If that’s what you’re asking?
---
No. I was married and I never did this shit. If you have to talk your wife into letting you do something, you're in a bad relationship.
---
4 eggs. 5 will go up in an hour.
---
Yep, buy it.
---
I may have used the card, and I may have triggered it, but I will check next time I log in. I can’t remember but I was in on one final battle, not sure if that was the one I triggered. It was a big fight, but there were lots of players there...probably the whole server. I was getting some hits in and would re spawn and continue. Although at one point I got bumped from the server, had to reload into the game, and then I would up on a different server.
---
Anyway I will check to see if I have the card...maybe there is still a chance...
---
Ignore him. Making friends is part of the fun, and you can easily play solo with lone wanderer perk. Definitely worth buying.
---
Hmm. Yeah i think that could work
---
There is. Use the search bar on the sub. Dozens of posts this past week
---
10  ... 2 atoms per rad roach ... gotta take em where you can with all the photo daily's that are a no go due to the delays in releases and lack of fixing flawed updates.
---
or else what? More all caps rage?
---
Thanks for the trade!
---
suit yourself! but i'd love to have you :) .. over, that is.
---
Any other reasons, just curious.
---
Your mask scares me, as always.
---
Talked your wife into “letting” you buy a video game?
---
That's the worst news, I'm on ps4 too. Was it a special radium? If you get another, I'm more than happy to mod it up for you to get it to it's maximum potential :)
---
So if you spec for pipe + rifle + pistol all 3 will stack?
---
My wife usually plays mw remastered or BO4 but she has finally gotten bored of them and we just got her excavator armor the other day.  Im sorry to the other commenters who aren't as lucky.
---
After he gets a vasectomy
---
 Care
---
The quest reward is always 30 but you go kill the imposter a few times and he'll drop the plans to allow you to create a level 50 version of the same gun.
---
I luv your inaccurate info, yes its PC only, but it was left over from beta, not a hacker.
---
ahahahahaha. thanks for laugh.
---
id love to see the Nightkin come in, invisible super mutants
---
fear makes the meat better!
---
Community is one of the best ive been apart of. So many helpful players. Dont need irl friends to play with, youll make plenty along the way
---
She has watched me play much of 4, she just isn't willing to play it herself I can't really explain why since she loves the Skyrim, Oblivion, Bioshock, and admits to enjoying the setting of the Fallout games; though I always hope to find her randomly playing 4 or New Vegas on her own one day.  Until then I am happy enough to have her playing 76 with me (along with Monster Hunter and Borderlands games =).
---
Maybe if my daughter decides to try out 4 she will get her mother more interested now that she has played 76.... &lt;insert finger steepling indicative of forming a "master plan"&gt;
---
Great job 👍
---
Thanks for the feedback I’ll look into it more now
---
There is literally another post about mods not working like 5 posts down from yours lmao
---
My main is close to level 40 atm, but i also have a level 2 i need to work on, so I'd love to play sometime. PSN is thesmolowl
---
Thanks for the feedback everyone, I appreciate it.
---
Was being the operative word.
---
Hmmm...not sure if I have seen the announcements. Is this something that needs to be toggled on or everyone sees it? In that case I can just join in and don’t have to worry about the card. 
---
I believe I may have triggered the event once, so I will have to see if I still have the card.
---
I did realize a few things. Farming the location by server hoping is good because the enemies and the wendingo usually have good loot like stimpacks, caps and armor. Also after blowing through stimpacks the first time, I realized it is just easier and almost as quick just to re spawn with all the chaos happening. 
---
I will check into the card and also see if I can get the announcements toggled on..thanks!
---
I think you're maybe a little too young for discord
---
Love ultra-light weightless legendary armor!  Weighs darn near 0!  With 5 pieces it adds up!
---
Yeah 3 hours seems a bit much but it is what it is....
---
Retake first grade grammar
---
what are you talking about XD im turning 18 this summer  in most servers if you brake a rule  teh mod ats you and ses like yo if you do that again your getting banned
---
Map is huge, like rediculous. Always somewhere new to explore. Lack of npcs doesn't make this game any less boring. When things hit the fan, it really hits the fan. Its a live game meaning it's going to be updated, new content added for a very long time. No p2w. Goes on and on. I was upset at myself for listening to the haters and not buying it sooner.
---
Get a new wife.
---
Did a lot get fixed since the release?
---
I feel like they could do transferring between characters with a vault like system; increase the stash size, make all your characters share a stash. Or create a seperate "vault". Make the plan obtainable in game (not on the atom shop) and if you build it at each characters C.A.M.P you can then access your vault storage.
---
I'd love to help you out, man.  Sorry.
---
Are you for real?
---
Oh yes. Its much, much better now. Still has its issues but what game doesnt?
---
I just came back after a fairly long break - 4 months or so. They've increased the stash size, fixed a lot of bugs, and have overall improved many aspects since release. As a very long time Fallout fan, this finally feels like a Fallout MMO. The various events give it a dynamic feel, and they're regularly adding content. The game is very enjoyable and getting better all the time. Definitely worth the buy.
---
what are you talking about?
---
I do like the mail system otherwise. Would make it so much easier to trade with other users.
---
Are you on now?  Add me on PC (same as Reddit name) and I'll just build one for you.
---
Alright then I guess I’ll get it since there doesn’t seem like much out there that I’m interested in
---
im just trying to get to a mod so i can get back into the server
---
If you want to play on the griefer server, expect to get griefed?
---
Nuclear winter is the whole map in a "nuked state" with vaults being a "safe" endgame dungeon for players
---
That's my guess.
---
Pretty sure the Raider Vendor at White Springs sells Raider Armor recipes .... as does the one at the Ski Hill.
---
Pretty sure ... I bought Calibrated Shocks and Core Assembly off of them .....
---
Lol did you even use the search it's all over the place
---
My dude if youre 18 and your grammar is that bad the education system has failed you.
---
I take initiative and usually power 1-2, sometimes 3 pylons at once and just keep using my vampire minigun and shotgun to keep up health with the occasional stimpak if I get overwhelmed. I noticed ever since I've been doing this, 3 out of 4 times we usually complete the event. As long as the other players are competent enough to keep attacking the sheepsquatch and not getting distracted by the other robots... 
---
So yeah, carrying the burden tends to result in success.
---
&gt; More all caps rage?
---
Even worse. More exclamation marks
---
It's alright. Hope you can sell it soon. :)
---
Quite welcome! Hope it comes in handy
---
Well I guess all you can really do is submit a ticket and they'll investigate. But like you say, if you don't know when the items vanish it's hard for them to know where to look.
---
My husband has always played fallout and now I do too! I’ve never really played video games before and now I’m at level 82!!!!! I thought this day would never come! Fallout is so fun!
---
Oh my god
---
BOS Shielded is 2 S 3 E if I recall correctly
---
I found it "used-very good" on Amazon for 17.64. It was definitely worth the price.
---
That would actually be sick, basically the endgame we have all been wanting
---
Fuck man, if you could server hop and not go anywhere, but the world just changed around you semi quickly id have so much more fun playing this game
---
Thanks!  I was in the same boat.  Happened upon a legendary crazy server this one time.  Everything was dropping legendaries at Whitesprings -- Even the glowing deathclaw near the sulfur fountain, the stingwing was legendary... Figures this was the server I was told to look for.  Went out and got a ton of stuff.
---
They said they fixed this in a recent patch but it's definitely still broken. I have noticed a few occasions (maybe 20% of the time) where the favorites stay where they should be but most of time they get moved or unfavorited. Super annoying.
---
Heavy gunner here. 2 star 5mm gatling, 1 star crylater, 3 star gatling plasma. These break easily even repaired 200% and gunsmith but they are so much fun. I hope to find more legendary gatlings.
---
i really don\`t see your point here i think anyone wold be mad if thy got banned for calling someone a name  that\`s just ridicules
---
Ok But Im still not getting back on. I don't need to lose my TSE AK or My Lever action. I got a plasma cannon and I don't wanna lose anything. Don't wanna lose my ammo either.
---
Damn. I'm gonna get back on my daily fallout 76 grind.
---
No human NPC's, so we are stuck with only robots.
---
That's fine I wont be on till later today
---
Thanks! I seriously didn't think I would ever get a decent \*\*\*. For my style this is THE rifle I wanted.
---
It is tho . Some people just expect 50$ to give them a lifetime of happiness
---
Are you still planing to play tonight?
---
especially  when its  the only active server for a game your trying to get back into
---
Sounds like an Eclave survivor referring to MODUS
---
What’s the point? It’s a known issue that Beth has said they are going to fix Tuesday hopefully if not with the next update.
---
I'd like this too, but I just don't see it happening. They're wanting to make people choose what's valuable and what isn't, mail seems like a good compromise.
---
to un-dilute chems leave them out in the sun. they will dry up and become dust. 
---
&gt;!and then you snort it all at once and get every addiction under the rainbow!&lt;
---
I've had this happen. His health was all the way down, I shot him several more times and he was still alive. I finally had to pull out my assassins weapon to get him to die. I have no idea what kind of build can do that.
---
I am online man! Thanks! I am gonna add you then!
---
I'm sure someone will cherish it soon.  I really wish cross platform was a thing, because you seem like a nice person that deserves a great gun.
---
Perfect! Thank you
---
Everytime i go into a nuke silo when my daughter is around she always says "daddys in the robot factory"
---
Well shes not wrong it kindoff is lol.
---
lol. yes. but shooting is so much FUN.  I'll keep looking for my dream gatling,
---
Is it a lot of fun? I stopped for that exact reason lol, been busy too, but never played it again after the bad reviews.
---
well fuck me i gusse i just lost all my karma for actually just trying to ask a mod for a link to the server so i can play after my 1 hour mute i really dont see what i did wrong
---
Wow, that's crazy when you think about it
---
You can use mod perk loadout manager if you're pc player. Must have mod for all pc players
---
Okay, my PSN is p3ngu1n_assault.
---
I have 400caps on me(480+), you can have that!
---
Sounds good
---
come on stop down voting all my comments i seriously just want to get access to the server again after my 1 hour mute
---
They've already confirmed for people they're aware, and they cannot restore items or basically comment further.
---
People have been submitting for months. We deserve recognition of the situation now that it's worse. Period. It's not too much to ask.
---
Clarity they're working on preventing it moving forward.. Something.
---
Again, read the reports. People have seen their items vanish. Someone had their Shotgun turn into a 50 Cal in their hands. Please read and educate on the topic before you criticize and downvote me. This isn't a new subject. Plenty of anectodal evidence and statements for you to read on.
---
I wouldn't be so sure. He's definitely talking about some kind of bot and/or AI, but MODUS can't launch nukes. It also sounds like whoever's in the tape is just now seeing the nuked world, and we know that MODUS did his thing a decade or so after the bombs, not before.
---
So what I have been experiencing is they don't really disappear. Their corpses go back to the point they spawned at. I see it alot in the burrows.
---
you can just save loadouts since last update
---
Holy hell. You're 18 and that's the best grammar you can come up with? Have you even read any of the other posts here to see how basic punctuation works?
---
Give them some purpose I gave 50 plus pets in eso and I don't give a single shit about any of them
---
I hope so. I saved my first 3* legendary drop just so I could display it if we ever got a way to.
---
I play PS4, original not pro and haven't had any issues like this. 
---
You could try rebuilding the database. That's sorted issues out for me on other games.
---
Wrong armor knucklehead it’s about the none power armor
---
Man... I never hit any legendary mobs there. I tried for a few hours the other day and nothing.
---
I've been jumping and doing the burrows though... I've gotten some 3\* melees and 3\* radium rifle. That's been pretty good so far.
---
Is there a trick to west tek?
---
Aww thank you. Luckily I'm pretty happy with the weapons I have now, although that one would've been nice to add to the collection, haha. If only cross platform trading were possible...
---
But good luck trading it, and have a good rest of your day!
---
You stopped playing over bad reviews? That's rough
---
Insults company. Thinks he’ll get what he wants.
---
I was wondering around flatwoods and a level 60 player (im level 35) gave me loads of plans including the power fist. Im still one rank of makeshift warrior from being able to make it.
---
Gotta try Dyer Chemical. Robco was good too but not West Tek good.  I go to Robco to get my 99% ful fusion core from the destroyed sentry bot and then clear out the bots there.  I then go next door and chase the retreating legendary super mutant at the General's.
---
I just loaded back in.  If it happens again, I'm going to try that.  Thanks!
---
It's some times useful when you want to move your camp without the fee
---
Depends whether you prefer damage or survivability. I'd use the explosive one IMO.
---
This, this right here. If I’m playing something my wife doesn’t enjoy (we play a lot of stuff together though) she has stories she writes, hobbies she does and books on stuff to read she enjoys or draws on her IPad.
---
Relationships can be amazing even if you have different interests as long as no one is a controlling shit head and you both respect each other equally. I trust my wife with my life and my worst secrets.
---
Cool. The thing is I’ve done like 60 challenges, still no pop for 20...
---
Hope you enjoy it!
---
Incidentally, if you do want a Bloodied one, check this thread as he seemed to offer a basic 1\* one.  Not sure of the price. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfh2uz/pc\_h\_lots\_of\_great\_1\_legendaries\_w\_your\_caps\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfh2uz/pc_h_lots_of_great_1_legendaries_w_your_caps_and/)
---
He's got a sooooothing voice.
---
Bloodied is always good tho :) and limb damage is good for fighting scorchbeasts
---
No, worded that wrong, I barely started playing because I was playing other games at the time, and I was just going to play casually. But when the bad reviews came in, it tainted my opinion, so I never tried again. So, kind of? Lol
---
im trying my best here Jesus ya i know im shit at spelling an punctuation im actively seeking help through my school its not fucking instant im trying to fix years of bad habits not to blame anyone else for my problems but i do think its a little bit because of my early schooling all my teachers would accept my shit writing and still give me full marks so i never felt i needed to improve until now its jsut so fucking annoying when everyone makes fun of my spelling or just disregard my point because my spelling is poor
---
Nice shirt! Reminds me of one of my favorite bad jokes:
---
‘Tried to get my buddy mike off his addiction to brake fluid...he just smiled at me and said that he could stop at any time’
---
I’m sorry
---
Learn when you should shut your mouth then. You keep opening it and inviting more downvotes. Walk away.
---
Go to vendors and sell em.
---
Go to the discord and sell em.
---
Go to the market place and sell em as well.
---
Keep the legendary items you want.
---
Sell the ones you don't want. Easy loot.
---
Must be an android device because my Apple is such a nanny and will not let most of that go. So is discord where all of us grumpy old fucks are supposed to go?
---
I agree with all of this. I'm glad that I waited 5 months to get the game. I'm worried that if I'd gotten it when it came out, it would have ruined my perception of the game.
---
The pool tables could be perfect for mafia or gangster RP. 
---
Most gangsters hang out in pool table bars (Bars that have pool tables)
---
And play pool. 
---
Hell to add to realism 
---
You would require a pool cue so you could play pool with it. 
---
If you don't have one you would be provided with a vault tec Pool cue.
---
I'm trying to find 90% WR ranged weapons but the weapon weight reduction armor helps too. Gunsmith helps too but regardless, it would be nice if they added more perk cards. Such as a martial artist perk card but for ranged weapons.
---
They're sort of B level spots to the A level places everyone knows about and gets farmed to death.  Dyer has a handful of ghouls and a couple gulpers at the outskirts, with max level enemies around the factory interior.  Don't expect more than one three star, but it's still a fairly regular three-star spot.
---
Congrats for the awesome find. Yes RNG god does show his smiling face from time to time. I’m about 2x your level, found explosive version of most of the weapons, some are tse, some bloodied, some instigating, plus bunch of dedicated ones like Zealots Nocturnal etc. Hop hop until it drops 💪
---
Oo I see, I never stopped but it's been a backburner game when I wasn't playing anything else, I kind of see where you're coming from
---
Same here
---
I had a lot of fun with it.
---
I loved what I experienced so far for sure, which was little to begin with. But with rdr2 and Ac odyssey I was pretty busy haha
---
This happened to me last night, me vs 2 other players. I was able to take down the one no problem but the other guy just wouldn't die. After numerous shots fired at him,he eventually died. When he came back,I continued to shoot him as he is closing in on me,then he one hit punched me with a death claw gauntlet and killed me smh. What kind of glitch or mod is this crap??
---
HAHA! Get owned! ;)
---
I can see it now *The Whitesprings Casino*
---
Good to hear, now that I’m done with all my single player games, I’ll give it another shot
---
My first reaction as well.
---
Although it could be a survivalist, like someone in the Free States, finally emerging from their bunker.  Or another Vault, I guess.
---
Love it...just happened to me couple days ago, with 3 weeks worth of junk scraps built up...heart was broken
---
I agree with Turkey_Sandwich. Players that I've come across have either been friendly and actively invited me to their group, or they've just been neutral (as in, we both go someplace for an event, kill some enemy NPCs, and then go our separate ways). FO76 doesn't seem to have the toxic player community that a lot of MMOs have. In other words, it's not shitty like Rust or something like that.
---
I would given you 3 legendary ones if I would have seen this a few hours ago lol
---
Just so you know, there's no reason to trigger the fight yourself. It wont give you a new quest, you've already finished it. The only reason to start one, is if you feel like doing it and now one else has recently. As I said, I've done a dozen or so, if you're doing other stuff, someone will start one eventually.
---
My comment was it’s much more enjoyable when you have friends who are starting out but when your friend is level 80 and your one you feel carried and useless
---
Indeed, part of the reason I want to know more about the vendor is whether or not services like this might be offered.
---
Some might argue this would unbalance things, since you could farm the Forest for a low-level legendary and make it a high-level one, but the Forest seldom yields multi-star equipment, and if you make the cost commensurate with the levels that have to be added, it would probably work out.
---
I server hop till I find an active and preferably empty uranium event at the mine. Collet everything and cool the glowing meat with super duper perk lvl 3 and come out with like 75 or so it's very heavy so I have to slow walk to the station there by the event. Those fetch 10 gold each so that's a quick chunk.dont forget  the 3 legendaries that come with the event if done till the end. Do it on 2 servers and your done.
---
Multiple stimpacks stacking?
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
Not for trolls, no.
---
That was fixed, as far as I know.
---
lol nvm man! I got one from Riomaki!
---
I think it has to do with the antique store up the road.
---
It's a bug that has been around since launch. But the devs decided to release a broken PvP mode anyway.
---
I give it a 10/10 for T-Bagging the ghoul at the end
---
LoL this is dope
---
No info has been released
---
Up for sharing your build details? It would take me half the length of your entire clip to kill one lvl 68 ghoul
---
I had to show them who is KING
---
﻿
---
LOOKS TO ME LIKE MORE THAN JUST VANITY PETS ARE COMIN'
---
So found within the game's files is a perk under Charisma that allows you to have a pet, the default pet is a dog but there are other things that suggest you can have other kinds of pets, tamed pets!
---
With the stuff that's datamined it's safe to assume that the pets aren't coming until the "Wastelanders" event at the very end of the year
---
Possible pet icon for Wastelanders

Nah man I just clicked on that one by mistake, my bad! Thanks for the gift!
---
Pipe revolver is boss at low levels that’s my go to for 6 characters now
---
Pretty much. You could spend say 30 tokens to level up a level 5 legendary to a level 60 or 10 tokens to reroll an effect on a level 50 legendary. Also as you mention I rarely see anything past 1 star in the forest, let alone anything worth keeping.
---
Welcome me to the fold!
---
I don't have friends on PC and I still enjoy the game u'll have stuff to do for a few hundred hours then make a new character book a couple hundred more
---
Lmao dude you got me rolling I love it. I've been there i can watch it all happening lol
---
Could be worse, my sheeploot was a 2* bloodied combat shotgun with bash damage.
---
It's all speculation at this point, but I'm hoping they'll do a token system - tokens in trade for legendaries based on the number of stars, and using said tokens to purchase legendary prefixes so you can customize your weapons. That's probably too much to hope for, but one can dream.
---
[Here ya go!](https://imgur.com/gallery/zvj9bUz)
---
That is absolutely possible, as I've said others have done the math and it is totally possible to get that much ammo in a 30 day period. Just because YOU can't doesn't mean others can't, especially those who run multiple accounts at the same time.
---
AWWWW YUS
---
Thanks man I recommend it
---
Very interesting. Now I’m more curious about the bot
---
You want people? We got em!
---
Yet you offer no link to this supposed pictures of his characters inventory. Interesting how that works. Especially when you don't even realize that 300k ammo was easily grindable back when that happened.
---
https://youtu.be/PfYnvDL0Qcw
---
No, what isn't smart is a PvP mechanic that allows players to challenge for a workshop but then back out while still being able to kill the owner.  Plus, the owner should have the option to simply concede...
---
I absolutely talk first, the problem is that there is no text chat on pc and voice chat gets ignored by people that know they are doing the wrong thing. I like to think I'm easy going and easy to get along with but that night I just had enough, not something I had ever done before
---
I don't think it'll be that simple. If I recall correctly you trade in for tokens? so, you trade in multiple one stars and maybe you get something a bit better that you might want..
---
..my own theory is that this is one of the ways that Bethesda is trying, to get rid of the excess of legendary items, mostly from duping. People trade in 5-10 lesser legendaries for one...the worlds get more simple with every trade..
---
I think it's a good game in it's current state . Maybe a bit better on the crashing side.
---
So rather than form you own opinions on something you have already paid for, you just quit using an item you purchased because other people didn't like it? Or more accurately, you a 60 dollar ticket ont he hate train?
---
Man, that seems like screwed up logic. I've not enjoyed games that get rave reviews, and I've seriously enjoy others that were considered failures. 
---
Case to the point: The 13th Warrior, critically panned, bombed at the box office, an all around loser in terms of money. But I enjoyed it. Was it as good as the book it was based upon, no. But still worthy of a couple hours diversion.
---
In matters of personal entertainment, a review should be the last thing you consider, especially after you have already paid for it.
---
I think there are two reasons rifles don't have weight reduction perks:
---
1. Rifles already have a shitload of other perks, and they probably ran out of spots for cards when they were designing. 
---
2. Rifles are already the best ranged weapons in the game. There has to he some drawback, otherwise why would you bother using anything else?
---
You don't need to have anything toggled, it comes automatically, the same way Fasnacht did.
---
You... ask you wife's permission to buy games?   
---
^(At this point I'm too scared to ask if this is bait or not.)
---
Hey thanks!  Very interesting build
---
How do you test your mod if you don’t own your he game?
---
The announcements should be automatic and everyone should see them. And if the event is going you can just just walk right in and join. Make sure to tag the impostor when it's vulnerable to get that loot. I missed it once when I was the conduit for all three pylons; got no loot after blowing through all my stims to keep the impostor vulnerable. :)
---
Are these eggs going to turn into something?
---
It’s got all the right perks in all the right places
---
I'd like it if we could just choose pre-war architectures to build, instead of the modular square panel build style we have now.
---
I saved up light weight 3star stuff and removed all the mods. Melee weapons and weightless armor pieces mostly.
---
I just wanted to understand it better. This isn't a sentinel/cav thing. When i see their health drop quick but then stops shy of dying. That pisses me off. I can handle op builds. It gives me a goal to strive for. This glitch just makes fighting a joke.
---
I've speculated that it has to do with whether or not you are a conduit.  If you're a conduit, she'll chase you down and rarely break focus until she kills you, or you go to a location she can't physically follow.
---
Scorchbeast Queen, I don't really know.  I can land a lot of hits if she's focused on someone else, but sometimes it's like she singles me out and the battle becomes quite difficult.  The best I can do, as melee, is to try and stay behind her as she rotates around.  It's hard to do, and the hitbox of her sweeping wing attack can be fidgety.
---
Well, I think there's roughly a 6-hour time difference between us, but I just started playing on PS4 earlier this week. I'm still newish (level 12), but I've played enough to know the basics.
---
The power of Weapon Artisan, I presume
---
I agree they should use it but most people that lvl don’t and they are quick junk grabs
---
I think you nailed it. Rifles are already the strongest guns except heavy weapons, and even then rifles have the advantage in terms of economy of bullets. Just look at pistols and the sorry state they are in. Any chud can take handmade and a few perks to make a functional build, but pistols require extremely optimized perks and certain legendary effects to be competitive. 
---
Plus there are already so many (good) rifles perks that Beth probably couldn't find a place to add any new rifle perks.
---
no
---
Usually it is the last thing I consider, same with movies. If it interests me or I like the series I’ll see it or play it regardless. I was already preoccupied at the time with other games that I just put it on the back burner. That’s all, that’s why I still frequent this sub because the concept/series/ and player base are all things I enjoy and plan on playing again soon! I just worded my reply wrong when saying it’s “the exact reason” I stopped playing.
---
You mean selling 1400 caps?  Hard bargain 3, berry mentats, marine tactical helmet (super duper if you have it), and I sell serums. Basically, find something you can craft for cheap (like there helmet) and make as many as you need.
---
I've been getting into playing more daringdesperado is the ign.
---
You guessed it right! You have won a chocolate chip cookie 👏👏👏👏👏
---
Pistols, shotguns, and heavy guns already have weight reduction, but they also have way less perks than rifles.
---
Yeah clearing them out is a challenge for me lol
---
It can easily be both. It's likely not just going to be more story, they explicitly call it a mode just like how they refer to adventure and survival.  If they're going to drop us in a harsher and less forgiving nuclear winter Appalachia closer to when the bombs fell then it's going to need its own backstory since we won't be playing as vault dwellers anymore and will just be survivors.
---
🍪 Yay
---
I would buy this. Awesome job!
---
🍪🍪wohoo🍪🍪
---
4 Serums, and 200 caps of random stuff
---
It can be both, sure, but it's not *just* a harder mode would be a better way to put it, which is what it sounded like without any other context.
---
Not everyone has the same income level. For me, I needed no permission to Fallout 76, had to inform when buying a 2080, needed permission when buying a bigger boat, and was TOLD to buy a bigger house.
---
They fixed the saving loadouts inside the game, no need for nukes and dragons anymore.
---
Take it as a compliment.  They want you dead... and fast. 
---
I used to honk it was the amount of damage being dealt but I have nothing to back that up with.
---
I would absolutely love an actual boiler. Assuming they eventually patch in bulk crafting it might be redundant, but aesthetically it would be a nice addition to our C.A.M.P.s.
---
Anybody got a fix solution yet?
---
Maybe
---
I've got one character, level 138. Only time I've ever gone out of my way to take out lower leveled players was when I needed the Good Grief achievement for 20 player kills, and only when they were already Wanted. And even then, I would leave their junk alone, because I didn't want them walking away with none of whatever they were carrying. My last three kills came from defending Mount Blair from a higher leveled bloodied melee player, and I've stopped going after anyone now. PvP just isn't my thing, and any benefits/items gotten from it can be obtained in other ways.
---
I've only ever taken junk from one low leveled player, because he stole my Supply Drop items. Figured he could have whatever was in their in exchange for the kill and the small amount of junk he had.

I do one loop through Pleasant Valley cabins and the Ski Resort. Kill everything and pick up everything semi valuable. Throw on Hard Bargain 3 and sell everything to Resin. 1000\~1400 caps in 10-15 min. You'll be really over-encumbered, but the vendor is right there so no big deal.

Vampires Railway here! What system is this?
---
I like that idea
---
bold comment as you dont know me :) oh well, keyboard courage can be fun
---
Maybe Nuclear Winter will be something like the DUST or FROST mods that came out for New Vegas and Fallout 4?
---
so, for curiosities sake, and i know the item for sheepsquatch to craft the card being like 2200 caps, would say 3000 caps + 3 keycards, get me 3 queen fights/kills and a sheepsquatch fight/kill in one session?
---
Was it purple
---
Also, the Gatling Gun.
---
But no flaming mod?
---
This is AMAZING! I luv it. You're one talented artist. Ever think about getting into the gaming industry with original stories and illustrations? I have a soft spot for artists that take their talent for creating and expand on universes like Fallout with original fan fiction. Thanks for this!
---
Nah, normal red color.
---
Have the mod but I can’t fit it on due to the mod glitch 😭😭
---
How much for the bloodied suppressed? What system are you on?
---
Solid advice
---
Right
---
That sux. But I get ya. I love my flaming chainsaw!
---
Could be. Base 76 is close-ish to DUST/FROST as is, it's just not as difficult.
---
If you're like me a month or two go and you find yourself with no motivation to play, don't.  Take a break.  Take a week or two, or month off.   Things will probably be better when you return.
---
Nah

I didn't go to West Tek before because it was a bullet sponge area and had a ton of hard super mutants not really dropping impressive loot. That's not the case NY more. Try getting a legendary friendly server and then hitting west tek. Here's how:  Farm ghouls someplace you are familiar with (Whitesprings is good for sheer volume of ghouls to take a sample. If I score 6+ legendaries at the golf club then I'm on to something). If the next area produces good drops as well you are definitely in legendary land and then I do West Tek. If Wes Tek pans out, I farm constantly praying the server doesn't crash. In my case,  the sever didn't crash, but was shut down for 'maintenance' by BSG. Kinda suspicious, but whatever...  I rode that

train to the last minute.
---
I’m really not doing this to make money, so yeah it doesn’t look like I’d be losing any.  We would have to jump servers for stability other than that I don’t see any issue.
---
I guess this is as far as I've gotten with something like that? I sent a copy to Bethesda and Todd on a lark, but not sure how I'd get into doing this sort of thing professionally.
---
To be fair I wouldn't want to spend £50 without my partners say-so. Likewise she wouldn't spend £50 on a board game without my say-so. 
---
A relationship is a partnership, you can't go all [rogue](https://instagram.com/p/BwR6aM9F9Rz/) on them!
---
Where do you go once the mobs all die out at west tek? That's the problem I have with checking for legendary friendly servers. By the time I'm done checking, all the mobs are dead. That makes me server hop a lot.
---
To be fair, I have an alt that can cheese around the map with an anti-armor super sledge and a nicely modded suit of T-51b and just steamroll through everything very quickly.  Power armor slugger builds aren't the highest DPS, but they do very good damage and can eat a LOT of punishment.  I have a bunch of perks I can play with on that character, while my rifleman is basically locked in to a build with very little wiggle room.  I "wasted" 4 perks to add a bit of damage with a backup pistol for scorchbeasts that refuse to land.  Overall, the character with a power armor suit and hammer is 1000% more efficient and far more durable than the rifleman that can kill everything with one hit.  
---
Not discounting the joy and skill of popping heads off with long range shots, but I could probably drink a 12 pack and still crush everything with my slugger build without being in any danger.
---
But muh easy caps and aid
---
Honey, I understand we have bills to pay and a mortgage to care for but I'd like to spend £50 on this thing I enjoy.
