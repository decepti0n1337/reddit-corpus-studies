Who said console lol

Front of the Whitespring has loads. Just make sure you get the bunker, Monongaj substation and the toxic dump plave all in the blast zone. Can usually get enough for around 20 pure cobalt.
---
I'm usually high as fuck and just doing conduits because I know no one else will and I have nothing better to do. I also stim people who get downed. At level 29 I'm not doing much damage, so I do bitch work. Still getting loot in the end.
---
The black one is the last one and should ge available any minute now.
---
Thanks.I could be wrong about the vendors but I am pretty sure a long time ago I did see a vendor sell them. They may have removed it.
---
Eh, fair enough, just figure if they got worried they would have asked an employee who would have explained it. But that might just be wishful thinking on my part.
---
Funny story: I didn't know the Quantum paint plans were added to the game. I decided to go back to the Ordnance site to give myself something extra to do, since the first time I opened up the Nuka Cola room, the original Nuka paint plans weren't there for me. It was night time, so I couldn't see a bloody thing. Wandered in to the first open door I could find, and... Quantum paint plans, sitting there ready to take. I had found a pre-opened Dome 7. Someone opened the door, and either didn't find/take the plans, or so much time had passed that the plans respawned (I don't know if that's possible, or how long that would take). Still haven't gone and picked up Key 7 for myself.
---
Yeah I followed the quest marker
---
honestly never seen it happen but i got some respect for you, i got a ammo-making base personally so it doesn't bother me if some else wants to use there C.A.M.P in a different strategic way, if it really does bother people so much just change servers
---
Oh I think you misread what I was driving at: they can shoot my turrets all they want, I can rebuild my camp, and the circle of life will continue. 
---

---
It's the crying to BGS that's pathetic.
---
Here’s a problem with goo/ash piles, though. 
---
Butcher’s bounty doesn’t work on them.
---
Yeah I heard
---
Morgantown
---
Wasn't thinking the whole thing had to be idling, was more thinking leaving it on when you weren't around to pad your played time.
---
Also I'm sure there'd be bots to help you do this on PC.
---
being an adult and being mature are 2 different things pal
---
I dunno, they're some tough cookies on here.
---
All mushrooms are edible once.
---
Thank you
---
I’ve found plenty of treasure maps but can’t figure it out. How do i
---
Oh, you.
---
Proof: Bethesda stated in their response to him that he had aquired mass amounts of ammo by using system exploits. **I** didn't call him a duper, Bethesda did, you can blow raspberries at them all you want
---
Not Proof: Nuh uh, somebody, somewhere, at some time said he dinnut!
---
I'd pay 1k for it
---
Glad to make your fallout 76 experience top notch!
---
Onyx egg is now in store.
---
&gt; Proof: Bethesda stated in their response to him that he had aquired mass amounts of ammo by using system exploits. I didn't call him a duper, Bethesda did, you can blow raspberries at them all you want
---
No they didn't, you really need to read the emails again. You are misremembering, they never claimed he duped anywhere.
---
Want to keep trying? Or you going to give up since you can offer no proof he duped?
---
Gauss rifle is a weird hybrid.
---
It’s a rifle.
---
It’s damage type is ballistic.
---
It’s ammo is considered energy (affected by batteries included).
---
The Grounded mutation affects it as if it were an energy weapon.
---
It’s listed under energy weapons in the crafting interface. 
---
Basically it’s an energy weapon in every way except for it’s actual damage type.
---
What's the benefit of the prime receiver?
---
What do you mean
---
On Xbox, no issues with me.
---
Odd question, but how about the effect on the Meteoritic Sword? 10% damage against humans?
---
  
---
Is it the same as Assassin being player only? Or is it a different flag?
---
Do we know what we get from it yet?
---
Yeah I seen that
---
Wow maybe I’m just unlucky where should I go to farm legendarys
---
Eh - what bug was this? Any chance you were in EXC armor?
---
Respect
---
Seems like no one can or wants to on xbox. Gratitude.
---
Hood to know.
---
Guy told me you can see it locked in the build menu somewhere - not sure if true. I like surprises so I haven't looked, and will wait to see tomorrow haha!
---
Oof. Yeah that has happened to me once before. Someone nailed his corpse with an explosive weapon and he went flying off never to be found (by me at least) again. That’s frustrating
---
Like the trade stealing glitch there still isn't a bit of evidence this is legit. 800+ hours here and no issues.
---
Boy, you should really try digging up next time.
---
"This account has violated the Code of Conduct and Terms of Service by exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication."
---
It's like, the first line of the email, and everything. And, your damsel in distress is the one who posted the Bethesda response, so he's never going to love you if you keep contradicting *him*.
---
Halloween Candy from Monster Mash Event works as well.
---
Go for it. I hate being forced to carry all three conduits, and I'd love to see some folks digested for playing like ass.
---
from the post i read it just took items from 5 people out of their inventory
---
Nah Two shot is exactly where it should be. A general solid upgrade. 25% more damage. It doesn't outperform others like bloodied, furious, zealots.  
---
Explosive is okay where its at. Its a secondary effect it doesn't need to be gamebreaking. Its a nice boost to damage and gives some light AoE. You need perks to maximize it as you should need. 
---
Both work fine and they were absolutely broken before. Most people hate it when items get nerfed but nerfing those two was honestly the right call.
---
What is the reward, I can't get on to check
---
Try closing the game out and restarting. Sometimes ya gotta ping the server
---
did you restart client/app?
---
Link it, because that isn't what the email said. You are confusing him with someone else, he wasn't banned, he was only suspended. That is how you can tell bethesda didn't hit him for duping, but just for ammo amounts, because they ban for duping and only suspended for too much ammo.
---
Yes. So some randoms say, much like the trade glitch. I was even told it will eventually happen to me and to just wait. Still nothing. I think it's user error.
---
How many eggs total?
---
Could u perhaps tell him to tell me or something?
---
[removed]
---
&gt;"That didn't matter as people would sometimes still break things in my camp, much like a little kid cries in a toy store when mommy won't buy them the shiny toy they wanted."  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Actually, I talked about this sentence. Yeah, I can misunderstand what did you imply there. It's possible. Please describe it to me if I misunderstanded. And, I read all comments and your post carefully, you can trust me.
---
I assume it's the damaged bunny mask that was datamined a few days ago
---
i hope so
---
The weapons are upgradable, too, but only at levels 35 and 45. I still use the sword as with the Eye equipped it ignores 100% of armor and hits as well as most other non-legendary one-ganders.
---
Atom a hour.  And if you're dedicated enough to reach that amount of in game time, you deserve it considering how broken things are with this game.
---
6 eggs. Free limited time item tomorrow if you have all 6.
---
True
---
Bunny mask
---
If they made a fast travel point that was free and to the indoor floor of the main building, it would be a huge improvement and creating the first real player hub in the game. Additionally, if they added the physical atomic shop there as well I believe the community would be in such a positive spirit.
---
How? I'm way past max level and can't view them in the weaponsmith bench
---
I told you what he told me, and this was like a day ago. I'm sure someone will eventually answer here saying what it is anyway. I'm waiting for tomorrow :)
---
Balls! Why Sony gotta be so against cross play!
---
😔
---
I wouldn't worry about it. Especially if that's what's keeping you from logging in. Like I said there isn't a bit of proof, just anecdotes that things are supposedly missing after the fact.
---
Machete don't tweet.
---
If it doesn't come up with a Google search, it might as well not exist.
---
These should be on the Fallout 76 web site and stickied on the Bethesda forum for Fallout 76, along with known issues/bugs and planned changes.
---
The weapons are upgradeable, dunno why it's not upgrading for you. And you can say the same about every other faction, no reason to go back to their bases. Same for Firebreathers and Brotherhood specifically. Probably the same for the Pioneer scouts in May. I do think they'll add onto these factions in a future update though
---
Capncookmat3 add me online a lot
---
more scorched damage, ammo requires flux though which is a hell of a burn on the .50
---
&gt;The Snallygaster is not marked as animal, only cryptid; bug?
---
There is a holotape that makes it seem like Snallygasters used to be human.  At least taht's what one specific person might have become.  And I think that was a fiction radio play in-universe, but it might be intentional.
---
Perfect, just got the sixth item
---
That's cool, also what are the featured items in today's shop if I may ask
---
That's actually pretty cool lol. Nice
---
Happy cake day!
---
No proof of it yet. Lots of stories coming out but not a single shred of proof. Exactly like what happened with the trade stealing, suddenly we get tens of stories but it's never recorded in any way. Relatively safe to chalk it up to fake. 
---
My theory is that it's something to do with the recent influx of skins and renaming. Not sure if people realize that anything in any way related to the atom shop (so even your normal weapons with an atom shop skin) can not be transferred or sold. If you try dropping them, they are just destroyed. There's a confirmation menu but not many people ever read those anyway. They don't even appear in the trade menu to sell. Since so many cool skins have come out in the past month, people are probably just unaware of how they work
---
The only people who shouldn't be conduits are bloodied builds, everyone else should be tagging them,
---
I feel like one hand is very balanced. Its got solid dps, you aren't one shotting as many enemies but the weapons are faster and weigh a lot less. I can carry 2-3 weapons for what a two hander gets using all rise which is very light compared to some other two handed weapons. It also works well with ap costs and abilities that rely on multiple hits. Which I rely on using my support gunner.
---
Unarmed is very strong, it has less perk investiment but the main problem is unarmed weapons themselves namely the death claw gauntlet and powerfist are insanely strong at base level. The only xore drawback is no power armor use.
---
I liked it, the end reward bugs the hell out of me though, looks redic on male characters and cant wear a costime over ot
---
If they just made the interior of Whitesprings instanced globally (what ever server your in connects to this one and allows you to enter with players from other servers while still technically connected to yours) it would be amazing, pure player hub fit 30-40 players in there trading. No more scamming, no more base wrecking when people get mad in trade and an easy place to find whatever it is you want.
---
Yea people will grind like no tomorrow to get more perks. Everyone can use a few more perks and end the struggle
---
The set up and premise really did make me think there would be daily events for them.
---
Oh ok
---
They did lift it, did you miss the part where he said he got his account back for a short period which allowed him to get those pictures showing he never had anywhere near the ammo bethesda thought he did.
---
Same. Once I read that the cryolator had a role, I busted out my Suppressor’s and started hosing that baahhhhhd boy down.
---
well over a 1000 hours here. happened 3 times to me. even made a post ages ago reporting that the game ate my chameleon wood armor that I farmed weeks for. I eventually contacted the official reps and everything.
---
somebody also consolidated every report on the issue and it was far, far more than just "a couple randoms"
---
and no, it wasn't user error. my items vanished on spawn and fast travel. I was nowhere near a workbench to scrap them, a vendor to sell them or even opened my pipboy to drop them.
---
There is no rule in the ToS saying you can't run multiple accounts at once.
---
Did you miss the part where they did unban him which allowed him to get those pictures?
---
Doubt anybody will reach that. Even if they leave their system running nonstop, that's something like 310 consecutive days of playing...you can save money on electricity by just buying 7600 atoms instead
---
More info? What are we looking at?

My PSN Is Pr0m3th310us

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
this particular bug is impossible to replicate. I've tried it, a lot. I wanted proof so Bethesda would get off their asses and do something about it. it's the reason I don't play my assassin/sentinel any longer, because I happened to me. 3 times.
---
lately I've been thinking it's the framerate. I cap mine to 30. but there's no way to know for sure. not talking about the renaming reports either, this goes all the way back to release.
---
They could just add all the items like they normally do every update and instead of hiding them until it’s time from them to be released, just put them out on display with a “Coming soon” tag (bonus with a date and price) so you could plan accordingly and be excited to hope on that day to play and unlock it. It there was a physical atomic shop store that everyone went to each day and saw the Blackbird PA paint on a set of X01 with “coming soon Dec 9th”  people would have been lined up outside the store waiting for its release with atoms in hand
---
One handed weapons are faster and lighter. They don't one shot as many enemies but they are better for split builds, since its less weight and more flexibility.  
---
Overall its pretty balanced. One handed attacks can melt certain enemies well. While instigating two handed weapons can be super potent in one shotting. 
---
One handeds biggest weakness is lackluster weapons.  The ski-sword is good for single hit damage and combat knifes can strike stupidly fast. But most other ones tend to fall into a meh category they don't do anything the above two do any better. They sorta just fall in a mediocre spectrum. 
---
Unarmed has weapons like the deathclaw gauntlet and powerfist which are very potent at base level. 
---
Two handed you get all rise easily and its a very solid strong weapon. But it runs into similar problems to one handed in a sense that a lot of weapons are lackluster.  Super sledges are good but heavy and lack modding ability but a good legendary effect can make it easy to one shot tons of enemies.
---
Would be awesome if player actually can ''rebuild Appalachia'' like its praised everywhere.
---
You can’t- the cameras have been pushed back to another update but unfortunately the dailies/weeklies are still there.
---
I did link it already. From the 900 hours guy. Where he says he's the 900 hours guy. Have you really been arguing this entire time about something you **haven't even read**?
---
*Gasp*!
---
Fetch my fainting couch, someone didn't know what they were talking about on the intrawebs!
---
I had a ramp pizza just the other day!  It was delicious.
---
Just the black pipboy skin is new
---
It seems you haven't been keeping up with it, he was unbanned a month ago. If he was a duper they wouldn't have unbanned him.
---
So, any proof? Video of an item in your pipboy then gone? Even on consoles it's easier than ever to record this stuff. If it happens you just hit a button and the last 15 minutes will show everyone this is legit.
---
r/woooosh
---
Aww, I was hoping the war rider power armour would be out 😭
---
No doubt. My pc buddies seem to get the best swag my dude could use.
---
I’ve been using some QoL mods since launch, no issues. I’d steer away from anything “hacky” though- this is an online, multiplayer game. So no texture replaces or model replacers. The best Bethesda has said is mods aren’t “supported.” That’s not the same as saying they’re banned.
---
All of the "suspended" accounts were temporarily unbanned. Nice try though.
---
Preach it
---
Get all three levels of whiteknight. Whether you equip it constantly or swap it in for repairs it'll make repairing so much easier. 
---
It reduces damage to armor by 20/40/60% . And each level cuts repair cost. I don't have exact numbers but Id say maxed out its roughly like a 75%ish discount. I can nornally repair all my armor for less than 8 ballistic fiber.
---
How do you what?
---
I love that a week in, there's still no action from Bethesda on this. Makes you wonder if they give a shit about the big bugs...
---
What about TSE who does that work best on?
---
We need this and the glass green house wall to make the perfect gardener happy!
---
Hells yeh brother 👊
---
Defense fences are pretty good, I saw a guy do a handrail with conduit, that looked pretty good.
---
Thank you for clearing this up for me. I was just going off what someone else told me. I hope op took it with a grain of salt
---
If you want to be silly you can use a .308 bolt-action pipe pistol.
---
Which allowed him to get pictures of the ammo he supposedly had, he didn't have anywhere near the ammo bethesda claimed. LOL
---
Maybe Tuesday
---
Only problem is getting enough acid.
---
good luck replicating it. besides, you're asking me to be recording at all times, all of my 1000+ hours, in case it happens again. I'm no streamer.
---
no to mention I could just as easily fake it. your "proof" means nothing.
---
Says I can't add you but I'm Willreaper41
---
Which allowed him to take pictures after everything was removed, you mean.
---
Everyone is taking a break for Easter, chill, it’ll get sorted soon. There’s no harm done.
---
You’re thinking about the prospectors vending machines sold at stations.
---
This sucks, this maybe why i never got the others. I been entering through tbe normal menu. Damn it.
---
I'm gonna have to try the conduit I think the defense fences may be too high/ obstruct the view 
---
Thanks
---
Yeah I have been silly cause I need to save my ammo so yay 1 shot every 5 seconds at a disappointing damage count
---
Those are some cool ideas
---
Hemlock Holes Maintenance Workshop in Toxic Valley has acid extractors.
---
Sorry, you can green screen in game, so you can key out anything almost. You can also change filters that make the game look interesting.
---
Ah, the morels are coming up!?!? Time to get my ass to the woods with my bag and warm up the fryer! :)
---
No, if you'd read up on the suspended people getting unbanned you'd know bethesda didn't remove any of the items they suspended them over. No gear was deleted off any of the suspended accounts.  Seems you don't know as much as you think you do about this.
---
I sent you a request
---
I wonder when they might talk about it again then?  Have you heard anything since?
---
Almost makes sense right?
---
It’s in game. Check headwear in the armor bench.
---
I used paragraphs, I just happened to get the right amount of words per line to make it look like they're not there. Thanks for the wiki link to improve my writing skills though.
---
This would be nice. However, I would like to see more special points added. Beat the SBQ? Get 2 points. Other significant missions would grant 1, such as maybe clearing a vault in the future. Maybe even based on level. Nothing major, but I think 5 or so special points would be a nice addition.
---
I think so many perks go unused, particularly QoL perks, because of a pretty tight restriction.
---
Yeap in my area they are starting. Not enough to make a mess, but hopefully the weather during  the next two days will encourage them to pop!
---
Its the respawn bug where you cannot respawn because "you're over-encumbered". I was wearing EXC armor, and when I die, the armor is counted as gone, removing the carry weight bonus, causing me to be considered over-encumbered and not be able to respawn, which happens rarely but is still annoying.
---
Actually on console it's automatic. So us console plebs are "always" recording the last 15 minutes. That's what makes it so easy! If you can't replicate it I just... What? Proof means proof, and if you give a crap about Bethesda fixing it you'd pony up. What's that? No one has any proof? Oh, must be legit.
---
How do you run out of caps in this game. I maxed my caps so many times already its easy.
---
There is a really short one, I use it on platforms a lot because it stops you from walking off but doesn’t effect the view like a 1/2 wall. 
---
The conduit looked sick though, it was impressive, but I haven’t had a chance to do it myself.
---
The very last fence isn't terrible, its called the "perimeter fence" I believe.
---
No, which allowed him to dump ammo before taking a picture of his "proof".
---
I put that back in parentheses, so maybe it'll catch your attention this time. I really don't believe you understand what "proof" means.
---
I'll check it out
---
 Someone started destroying my camp after I turned down pvp. Logged out, then back in. Minimal damage, but still - just move on if someone doesn’t want to play your way.
---
Its 6 in total
---
Setting CAMP next to a river now will give me parasites...every other time I spawn home I'm in the river
---
The biggest problem is one handed has numerous lackluster weapons. Two good ones are ski-swords and combat knifes. Most of the other ones fall on line somewhere between those and many fall below the power curve. So if you get a good one handed legendary effect/effects it has a high chance to be on a weapon that isn't great but serviceable.  But it always leaves you wishing man i wish that was on a ski-sword.
---
I think you have the bug backwards.
---
When you log in there is a bug that gives you more carrying capacity than you should have. If you exit the armor or die, it resets you to normal.
---
The item is already out and you can get it rn in the armor workbench
---
I'm on ps4 and there is no bunny mask in armor bench
---
Easter bunny mascot head
---
Except for the fact he claimed he never had that much ammo as bethesda claimed, and his inventory shows that he didn't have that much ammo. Not to mention I can prove that bethesda is miscounting things you pick up that would cause them to count his ammo multiple times. You just need to go grab some wood from a log in the forest, check the wood amount in your achievements and you'll see it increase by the amount of wood you gathered, then take that same wood and drop it in a suitcase, then close the suitcase, then open it up and recollect the wood. Check achievements again, wood count will have increased again, even though it's the same wood that you already collected once. Just like how bethesda counted his ammo multiple times due to him muling it.
---
I want a gas powered stick that never runs out of gas.
---
Thats saddening as there are a bunch of cosmetically nice 1h weapons (guitar sword for example) ill keep this in mind though!
---
You must have somehow missed a couple. I just got the 6th. The onyx colored.
---
How the heck wasn’t “swarm of suitors” like this? It’s like 3 rounds of 2 enemies. It should be 3 rounds of countless, or 1 round of multiple queens, and if one makes it, then round after round of kings! Something!
---
Then i must have missed them there was a few days where nothing changed
---
How does one play right?
---
Is this the egg reward?
---
I'm playing on PC. and nobody knows how to replicate it, otherwise I'd love to give you proof.
---
Oh, a mole rat saw me 5 minutes ago. Even though I just ran 500 miles I have to stand here till it decides to finally pop up before I can fast travel again.
---
Just like every other account that was banned or suspended. You're going to be quite the busy body, if you're white knighting *everyone* who was banned now.
---
Again, not proof: Nuh, uh, I dinnut!
---
Yea
---
But.. it wasn’t all that random. I found this routine where I’d either work on my Camp or do things as if I was in Adventure Mode (Play normally) 
---
Then when I’d inevitably reach the top of the leaderboard every hour or so, (and I’d pay attention to my rank, but a notification of being in top 3 would be nice), I’d change the way that I played. I’d either prepare defenses at my Camp or I’d make “runs” from my camp to places. Maybe id run an errand, or claim a new workshop, take that over. Fast travel back home. Repeat. 
---
I’d basically always assume I was being followed, and the leaderboards forcing that intensity on me every hour (whether it was in my head or not... damn Mires fake footsteps) was a lot more fun for me than knowing full well whether or not I’m on the radar. 
---
But it’s all Beta. I’m sure they’ll leave us with the best method in the end.
---
Although vampiric one handed weapons do get a special shout out for me. I have a vamp barbed walking cane. Got one at level 30, and used it until I got a level 50 one. Its a mainstay in my equipment despite being a 1 star. And having a skisword with 40% extra swing speed
---
Go to settings, turn voice chat off, exit back to game, go back and turn it back on
---
It shud work thru the normal menu if u restarted once it changed over but if it didnt this was a fix that worked for some people :)
---
You'd think there would be some sort of pop up to tell you it's available. Lol thanks I'm checking my game now.
---
The atom shop have not loaded any changes for me. May have been buggy for me. I think it may have finally worked. I now have somehow fove different ones counting the onyx.
---
Don't forget wooden blocks have lead in too
---
You've not offered any proof, your claim the email they sent said anything about duping is wrong, go read it again. NOWHERE does it mention duping at all.
---
Savage divide treasure maps got me a leg, distant thunder 2 legs, all different types, and a torso.... still looking for some complete sets ;)
---
It kind of says it in the description, you go to make it in the armor workbench btw
---
Sweet sweet. I wont be on for another 9+ hours anyways :)
---
There u go. Already out. Check armor bench :)
---
Funny how that works.
---
Which front? The one facing the golf club or the one facing the train station
---
What I think would be nice is letting you try on the outfits and run around the store and shit allowing you to see how it looks but it takes it  off if you leave.
---
It will be fixed on Tuesday with the patch.
---
Yo it's the bunny mask, I made one and am wearing it around now.
---
+ my red dress, I'm like a Post Apocalyptic Bugs Bunny distracting all you Elmer Fudds.
---
I really loved the callbacks to Fallout 4
---
I get so fucking sick of these posts.
---
Thanks!
---
losing stuff randomly or the trade bug?
---
One of the most posted topics in this sub. It’s a known bug introduced in a recent patch, mods aren’t attaching to weapons or armor. Not sure when it’ll be fixed but it’s effecting everyone right now
---
It could very well be that other people are still looking for it.
---
I was after the Nuka Cola paint plans not long ago and figured "everyone has got this by now, should be no problem." I had to server hop about 10 times to get it. Rooms were clearly looted.
---
Keep hopping, you'll find it.
---
Do you know if there’s a way to start distant thunder or is it just random?
---
That's sad. :( It should not only spawn the pile on the ground but the weather itself should change to goo/ash-rain for a few minutes. That's a lot of meat in the sky to scatter everywhere.
---
That is pretty much exactly what my game does every time I quit to desktop. Never cared that much since it ends up getting mew to desktop anyways. It has been that way since BETA.
---
There is no way it can happen 3 times to some people and 0 times to 99% of the community without it being user error in some way
---
Yeah that's what i meant i was thinking about maybe first round spawn 5 then 10 and then 20. And it wouldn't be too hard to implement into the game and it would actually give us a nice event to use our bullets and farm xp and legendaries
---
damn it, come on bethesda, youre literally making the game worse for players and putting off fixing it .-.
---
Imagine not being App State alumni and calling yourself a mountaineer.
---
you can actually change the record time to be up to 60 minutes (at least on ps4)
---
Ok thanks bro
---
Or a better fix would to make the game optimized so it does not lag, freeze, close, or disconnect during high tier events that cost lots of resources. This isn't launch day and should not resemble it.
---
Yup just made it. Was it in the description of the egg? I obviously missed it but was expecting a notification or something.
---
funny that people don't know how to replicate a bug? is this your first videogame?
---
This has happened to me twice on PS4 with Excavator PA. The first time I lost 2 arms the second time an calibrated leg. I did not rename my gear and I did not reskin my gear. I did not trade recently either. The parts vanished from the PA frame.
---
IDK how to prove it happened. TBH the first time I thought I screwed up and dropped/scrapped the arms. The second time I knew it was a bug. Thankfully I didn't lose legendary gear. I was able to craft the items I lost.
---
I get that you don't believe someone without proof and that is the best response. Hell I'd have the same response if it didn't happen to me.
---
I may have to start recording everything maybe I'll get lucky. Though I'm not sure that's the best word for this but at least I'd have proof.
---
Good to know!
---
Exactly.
---
Thanks to u/JMP1919 :)
---
Can you craft me shielded raider underarmor?
---
Gt outmodelcolt296 pretty sure i have all the mats.
---
SB queen drops recipe plans though, and you only need one for this (depending on which flux is required, anyway)
---
Saw at least 1 other comment of someone doing something similar. 
---
I’m wondering if they wanted to give you something and were upset you wouldn’t cooperate. Doesn’t justify the response but something to consider.
---
What’s the final reward?
---
Nah, that's not what I meant, but you knew that.
---
My guess is the issue was something that took a while to fix and they had to make sure it was fixed properly.  Better that they take their time and get it right then rush it and break it even worse.
---
Yea, that bug with campfires was fixed around a month ago. Best you can do now is clipping foundations through crops. Easiest to do with a flat patch of land. Place all your crops first, and then you are simply allowed to place foundations through them. Once you've done that, you can build up walls around them without issue. Even if most of the crop is covered, chances are that you'll still be able to harvest it.
---
To be fair this was days before the holiday weekend. While it's nothing game breaking it does seem like it would have been an easy fix to just take them off and replace with other tasks. Especially people that use daily tasks to keep them busy in the game.
---
I also have this on PS4. Can open and close window shutters from through second floor upstairs now but the visual glitching is annoying
---
A mask made from carving off a ghoul's face?
---
I'm just going to make a better post showing what you can do with it.
---
I'd like to believe it, but as you said, it's really difficult for anybody this has never happened to. And considering this community already has a well established reputation for spreading hoaxes, there isn't much anybody can do unless we get some footage. Shouldn't be hard for streamers or people who record their gameplay to upload to youtube or something. 
---
If nothing else, the people who are so vehemently speaking out against this should love the opportunity to get some footage so they can rub it in everybody else's faces here.
---
 I did enjoy the trolling "battle of wills",  but when you have nothing left but "no u!", you've ran out of intelligible content, and have become boring.
---
I've had 3 that duplicate every time I fast travel for days. Luckily they don't have weight.
---
Yeah well this is Beth we’re talking about ;)
---
I’d appreciate a link also, please.
---
If I have to be the conduit I'll be hitting it once and running away, I ain't got time to be one-shotted.
---
dozens of reports. look it up. someone consolidated the majority of them.
---
in my case at least I'm 100% sure it wasn't user error. had just logged in, was spawning into the world. I crouch to go invisible in case there are enemies loading around me. suddenly I become visible again. after the game was done loading, I open my pipboy and my chameleon wood armor is gone.
---
second time I had just finished a round of Uranium Fever. fast traveled back to my camp and as soon as the game finished loading my underarmor was gone.
---
You don't have to get it from the atom shop?
---
Thanks the tip!  I wasn’t sure if I missed something but found the bonus :)
---
losing stuff randomly, not due to renaming (if that's even a thing). never experienced the trade bug (again, if it's even a thing).
---
Yea that wolf pack is sure sneaky
---
So what now you’re telling me how to play the game lmao? No thanks.
---
Adrenaline does effect your listed damage on the pip boy lol, it’s like you just spew misinformation from every orifice.
---
Super sledge doesn’t compare to fist weapons dude, plain and simple, anyone who has played a real bloodied unyielding melee character will tell you.
---
The percentages are not better especially when you factor in the 9 point requirement to max every slugger card, leaving you room for incisor and martial artist, no blocker, nothing else, just to get much much less damage than a fist weapon can get. Doesn’t take a genius to run the numbers and figure it out.
---
Meanwhile fist weapons get 25% more MULTIPLICATIVE damage just from a mutation. If you know how math works you would realize that this 25% multiplication damage increase is far superior to a additive 25% increase and because of that it makes every perk boosting fist weapons 25% more effective. Less investment, more reward, more damage, superior.
---
that's exactly what you meant. I can post a screenshot of my desktop if that's what you want, but I can't replicate a bug nobody knows how to replicate. it's as simple as that.
---
All good, Happy Easter!
---
So can you make the headgear anytime after getting all the eggs?  Or is it for a limited time available in your armor workbench?  (I'm out of town and the house-sitter has been claiming eggs for me.... not sure if I need to ask her to make the headgear as well).
---
Not kidding tried title  
---
Deathclaw Shrine  
---
My camp deathclaw shrine  
---
Then this title.
---
That's a weird way to train someone to spread cat memes everywhere but I guess it works.
---
I think we'll get it next update, I kinda just want the warhawk personally.
---
The problem is, "dozens of reports, look it up" was the exact same thing said during the trade stealing fiasco. Which was never a bug. That was a case of people misunderstanding the UI (which, to be fair, did have an issue associated with it that allowed you to accidentally list the wrong item when selling many items quickly to a player). All the reports of players coming up to them, forcing trade, stealing items out of their inventory, buying things for 0 instead of the price they set, and whatever else were all completely fake. I'm open to the idea that there is some UI issue that makes you scrap or drop items while loading in if you mash buttons too quickly, but not just items poofing out of existence without any user input
---
I know this is late but there are 27 craftable drinks so far in the game (brewing only, not cooking). You start with a few already unlocked automatically and one recipe (hard lemonade) only comes from a random encounter vendor (lemonade stand).

Instead of fixing the bug, they're just going to ban you for hacking.
---
You feel better now?
---
Random, :(   I believe census violence also has a chance, but I’ve never had it happen for me
---
If even if everything was designed and worked perfectly, there would still be complaints.
---
This would be great! I recently bought that rose dress on sale but when I put it on my character it looks like she trying and failing to hide a pregnancy...not the look I was going for.
---
Are all the eggs out yet....i dont have the black one. Not sure if i missed it
---
sure, Moist Dovahkiin
---
Np
---
How would you deal with 30-40 people trying to sell and buy from the weapon and armor dealer at the same time? Because i find that i only sell and buy to/from the blackpowder vendor.
---
This is where adventure-mode leaderboards should come from, missions that just throw baddies at you till you die, and then that’s your number, see who can be the biggest on the server. 
---
Some changes to make it work with teams maybe, but yea I think there’s something there.
---
Wait when you exit do you just exit to main menu or do you completely close app?
---
Flatwoods monster isn't.
---
Exactley the opposite of how you are playing.
---
Dang that sucks but thanks
---
Just exit the map
---
Thank you heaps
---
all the eggs are out, the black one is the last one and tomorrow there will be something for people that have all 6.
---
ROFL, "Oh no he caught my lie that the email doesn't say anything about duping, quick scurry away!". You are right I'm not going to keep wasting time with a liar that has to resort to lies about what an email says.
---
I think I have them? I won't be home till after game of thrones to check though :)
---
I just one shot glowing ghouls, seems way easier than building some shitty camp everyone will take pleasure in breaking.
---
Imo way more things should be three-star legendaries. As it stands, 3* barely means anything. You can get a drill or syringer, you can get wood armor (which caps at 1 effect), you can get a 1* legendary, and you can get a shitty 2* or 3* legendary. The odds of a 3* legendary actually giving you something better than a non-star legendary is minuscule. Either all high level enemies should automatically be a guaranteed 3* legendary, or all 3* enemies should be guaranteed to drop something with 3 effects (no wood armor, no drills, no syringers). Even if the real sheepsquatch is just a reskinned deathclaw, it should always be a 3* legendary with the current system
---
Whale conventionally refers to gamblers, so I understand the analogy. I just thought people like me were the whales rather than the very young. I guess if they are only going to target that audience, I'll end up spending my money elsewhere.
---
Just go into photo mode on console, and band your controller stick so it keeps spinning. I'm pretty sure(?) Healing Factor would counteract starvation and hydration, so you could leave it on 24/7 if you wanted.
---
I was playing the event today, which barely ever pops up anymore. Consistently 4 or 5 people were running around not shooting the sheepsquatch. It was so baffling to me, if everyone was contributing we might have actually won it.
---
1. Campfires do not work anymore. Floormats still work. You can place Crops on a floormat and place the floormat on a table to create (some sort of) raised planters. There is a recipe for a pot sold from a vendor at whitesprings, you can use this pot to place it over the plant after it is placed on the table to create even more illusion. Saw that on youtube a while ago, sadly I don´t remember where.
---
2. There ARE Planters in the game already, stumbled over some nice greenhouses. But these are not player recipes. However, there is a chance that they are added sooner or later to the game. Because they are already in the game it should be way easier.
---
Hey check out xbox marketplace. You can find it there. Just post an ad and someone will inbox you
---
Another real world example of an uber passenger saying, "I'll tip you in the app"
---
I am on Xbox and I have to actually restart my console in order for the eggs to show up. It's just a minor inconvenience but it works.
---
*Yawn*
---
What was that you were saying?
---
it's meh. don't know what I was expecting, really.
---
I was having this problem too. I was able to solve it by exiting the builder and reopening it. I’ve found that a lot of problems are solved this way, like jumping when trying to attach wires.
---
Hm. I have 4000ish caps. I should probably walk everywhere now and stop mass selling excess chems to venders. Also I need to stop getting one-shirted repeatedly by some level 200 w/ a TSE weapon.
---
Upvoted because best community.
---
Lowball offer
---
 Last time I took the bait on this one I got massively down voted for suggesting you should get sexual favors from a Bethesda staff member of your choosing.
---
Train station. All the silt beans, firecracker berries and glowing resin turn into cobalt and there's loads around all the areas I mentioned.
---
No, I'm saying that the way you play is just odd. Play how you want.
---
Adrenaline has 6 possible damage value boosts for any weapon: +10/20/30/40/50/60%. How can it possibly be shown on the pipboy? It's always at 0%, unless you're in combat.
---
You're giving an opinion. Yes, I agree that unarmed is the best when not in power armor, but that's both of our opinion. But it's a FACT that Super Sledge has the highest possible damage value of all melee, and you're arguing against that.
---
When you have all Slugger perks, you still have space for all damage increasing STR perks. Once again, you're making false claims.
---
3 Slugger perks of +20% each will give you a damage boost of +72.8%, because 1.2^3=1.728. Conversely, +20% from Iron Fist and +25% from Talons will give you a damage boost of +50%, because 1.2•1.25=1.5.
---
Every other damage increasing perk will apply to both 2H and unarmed, so there's no point talking about them. This means that the higher base damage of the Super Sledge plus the 3 Sluggers rather than Iron Fist + Talons means that Super Sledge absolutely has higher damage than all other melees.
---
Awww, does little boy need to get the last word in? ROFL, go figure someone jealous of the 900 hour guy being a better player than you. No wonder you think he duped, you can't imagine someone being that much better than you at the game. Hate to tell you, he has his account back now, and has video of him being the first to solo sheepsquatch. LOL
---
Got all of them, have them on display. Asking myself "Is there more to it or not?"
---
inside vault 76 its a expiriment by Vault-Tec to incentivize survivors by having them do certain "challenges" that test their survival skills and further themselves hey you want this gnome go do an arbitrary task and we'll give you "atoms" in exchange for you keeping yourself alive and killing dangerous creatures
---
A few bad apples but it’s pretty awesome you are correct.
---
Last.
---
What type was it?
---
Hi, ive only done the mission a few times, kinda low level i die fast there, but i always try to hit "Conduit" on the thing and then the machine glows up. Is there something else im supposed to do??
---
Where does it say the Lord of the Lämp is a mutant?
---
Oh ok thanks again
---
Did that work for you?
---
I can see it now. just make several hundred exploding power armor statues and set them all off
---
Here he is back to playing the game and soling end game bosses like it aint no thing. :)

This is probably the best opportunity for them to add this as the fact you are a ghoul doesn't have to come up in conversation. The only people that could care would be the enclave.
---
Although I don't believe(or I don't wanna believe) that disappearing items is a thing, it's also kinda hard to believe that someone would be so careless to just vendor or drop their gears unknowingly. Then again, I've seen some people obtain tses or really good armors from vendors so.. guess some people really are like that
---
A Handmade.
---
That's pretty fair if you ask me.
---
Truth spoken right here. If going by the signs and lore we know, Mothman has existed since before 1920. Well before the wars that caused the end.
---
I'll probably ask you if I could buy some OSBs off you.
---
No issues here, PS4. Could the bench be too close to something, obstructing it even though it looks useable?
---
Yeah, you can craft the Easter Bunny Mascot head in an Armor Workbench, under Headwear.  Strangely, there's nothing in the game that tells you this.
---
I'm not sure if you physically need to place all six eggs, or if it just unlocks by virtue of owning them all.
---
Jesus, I sold mine for like 8k or 9k, bought for maybe 4k or less

probably didn't know any better. if you google "best fallout 76 weapon" you'd probably still get videos from november talking about the tse handmade.
---
I got 3 I'd love to part with for 25k a pop.
---
Again your playing wrong. Watch some tutorials and get back to me. My new character is level 30 and i already ammased 20000caps.
---
I got lucky and found a level 50 two shot Gatling gun on my heavy weapon character, it was only 91 caps. I've not found a better gun in months.
---
Aaaand a second group destroyed my camp again.  Two times in one day after 5 weeks of nothing.
---
I would assume it's any time.  I don't think there's been an example of an Atomic Shop item that you've "bought" (for free or otherwise) becoming unavailable.
---
We picked some a couple years ago while doing trail maintenance in Dolly Sods. We had a woman with us who prepared them delish.
---
Yes Bethesda, add Morels to the wilderness menu.
---
inflation the prices are so expensive on the market, especially if you want to join in at low levels
---
Only glitch I seem to be getting (besides the new terrible controls) is after I fix one item, I can no longer see the condition of other items.  I have to exit the workbench and go back in. Only indication I get on anything that might need repaired, is the Y button pops up on the screen for repair. This happened with the new update a week or so ago on Xbone.
---
Game is about exploring not fast traveling everywhere. If they wanted that then it would have been like that from day one.
---
1-handed or 2-handed or unarmed?
---
Look under defenses for a perimeter wall
---
That's a bit high for it, although I paid 30k for a BE 10mm reloads pistol today though.  Caps are pretty meaningless so I'll give as many as it takes if it gets the item. 
---
I paid 20k a piece for two good 2 star guns, and I'd do it again.
---
Have all 6 now what????
---
It worked for me. Too bad I can’t find a damn rabbit.
---
Second time my camp has been destroyed.  Two times in one day after 5 weeks of zero attacks.  Wtfrig. Guess the psychos come out for holidays.
---
sooo, ill pay for the mascot outfit if you have any you dont want
---
We collect all 6 Infinity eggs. expecting to wipe out half of all life, and all we get is a bunny hat.
---
Ehh no thanks
---
Right?? Idk how many iv done. But I got crap for the hard work I literally spend to start the mission. 2k caps for a recall board  left me broke hah. Iv been trying to get the imposter outfit but I dont think that's ever gonna happen
---
Good job naming in game stuff!!!
---
A whole other group attacked my camp just now.  Easter brings out the crazies I guess.
---
The final boss will be ManBearPig.
---
Really? Can I wear it over my power armour?
---
When you’re fighting the queen killing all the mobs before she lands and adrenaline builds up, the 5k dmg is listed damage after adrenaline is stacked up completely, and yes it shows in the pip-boy.
---
You said in a previous post that the super sledge had the highest possible melee damage with exception for power fist and deathclaw gauntlet, now you’re being a hypocrite and stating the obvious. It doesn’t take a genius to realize you’re full of shit dude so just stop trying.
---
You seem to not understand how multiplicative boosts work, they apply to everything that boosts damage. So bloodied is 25% more effective, str boosts are 25% more effective, bloody mess is 25% more effective etc etc etc. the one mutation makes all the slugger cards irrelevant, at much less investment, that’s why fist weapons are superior because they can achieve the highest damage and dps of all melee weapons.
---
When picking a new perk card do you enter perception for example and RB over to charisma, or do you back out and click on the special you want? You can put a point in one special but choose a card in another. Not sure, but I made this same mistake when I first started.
---
Where do you live around? I’m in the northern panhandle and unfortunately never seen any around.
---
Use ublock origin.
---
happened 3 times to me. but this was a couple months ago, I haven't played much lately. mainly because of this.
---
I don't wanna lose my assassin/sentinel gear. the only winning move really is not playing the game.
---
I’m in between Charleston/Huntington/Logan lol
---
Curious. Why?
---
Sure mang. But I'm in ps4
---
Ohhhh, quest to replace robobrain brain with brain fungus! And of course, afterwards it goes on a murderous rampage and you have to kill it.
---
I just had one event where the guy started i hopped in a minute late, i figured if grab a pylon or two cuss it seemed to be just him and me.
---
He just ran around killing robots and refused to engage the squatch or tale a pylon.
---
I died twice. Burned through 20 stims trying to stay alive as ISS focused on only me.
---
Then Third guy shows, and I'm like ok, more help.
---
Nope, crouch stealth NEXT to the pylon and doesn't take it. Just pot shots at an invulnerable iss.
---
I preach patients with people but when I died again with no one even trying to pick up the only pylon holder I emoted angry face and walked down the hill away from the event.
---
This made me laugh.
---
You have to go and craft them, not modify.  It's like crafting a new gun, with the previous gun as an ingredient.
---
Morel-squatch?  Hmmm.....needs work....
---
yes, but only on that arm. tis a glitch
---
the only way a reboot would work, or pvp as a whole really, would be if they disabled legendaries in survival.
---
people are eventually gonna comes across assassin/sentinel gear. and then instead of a few dozen people enjoying survival, one person is gonna dominate whatever server they're on. not only that, but just a bloodied or anti-armor handmade is notches above a regular one.
---
legendaries will always be unfair.
---
fair enough
---
3 pillars have to be activated or the boss is invincible when you activate a pillar it slowly drains your health so you have to keep healing yourself. You can have all 3 active on yourself at once but it will drain you super fast.
---
That's a great idea. Would actually give me a reason to get better
---
God I'd love to have something like this as an ace up my sleeve for fuckers that TP to the ammo factory I've just taken and kill me with cheesey one shot weapons.
---
Well, PC can't.
---
Just wait for the modders to release private servers for the game.
---
I didn’t pay attention. I just saw a badass statue and hit purchase, really wish I would have saved those atoms for something else.
---
My main is a bloodied HW/Explosives/PA build. So high strength and intelligence, moderate perception, agility, and luck, low endurance and charisma. 
---
I’ve currently got 8 sets. 
---
1 is a moderate-damage 1h build that still maintains enough weight reduction perks to keep me unencumbered. Basically Incisor, Martial Artist, 3x 1star Gladiator cards, then my Bear Arms and Ordinance Express perks because I carry about 8 heavy weapons and a shitload of various explosives. 
---
2 is a HW tank build I just put together (used to be a max damage 2h build, but I find the 1h build more efficient). Lots of defensive perks combined with most of the damage perks for HW. I’m encumbered in this build. Made it for dealing with the sheepsquatch as a low-health build. It’s very effective. 
---
3 is my normal max-damage HW/Explosives build that keeps me 30-50 weight shy of overencumbered. Every damage perk available, with swaps in Perception between Glow Sights and Exterminator, depending on what I’m facing. Luck perks get swapped around a lot but primarily bloody mess and one gun army. Basically zero defensive perks. 
---
4 is my exploration/fast travel set. Every single weight reduction perk in the game (well, almost. As many as you can fit with 15str, which isn’t all of them), along with the “radar” and lock pick perks in perception, a mix of “search” perks and class freak in Luck, and AP regen/sprint speed/sprint cost in agility.
---
5 is my generic crafting set for workshops, ammo crafting, scrapping, and hacking.
---
6-8 are specific crafting sets for weapons, PA/armor, and chems. 5 is normally guns, I manually swap the gun to melee card if I’m doing anything with melee which isn’t often.
---
Special must be bugged. For example, my strength is "-1". When I'm using strength given alcohol, It's going to negative instead zero or positive. But if I combine some strength based boost like Chem or food, it's turning to positive.
---
I guess you can have similar glitch.
---
Is that a thing like is there a bit of talk of that?
---
Biggest problem is that most players don't want to fight even in survival mode. That's how the audience of this game behave. They just want 20% more xps and try to avoid conflict at all costs. Many of you would have noticed that zero or one kills being the first place in survival mode is a trend nowadays and since no one's killing anybody, there's no player icons showing up on the map and survival mode's litally becoming singleplay pve session
---
Well thats why i die so fast then! Thanks for clearing that up lol
---
Kinda sucks that myself and others missed eggs cause when we log out of the game - we didn’t “close application”
---
I keep FO76 in the PS4 after I quit to main menu, I put the PS4 into sleep mode. 
---
Oh well. Sucks but whatever
---
So no rebalance on the games systems.
---
No it didn’t work I even reinstalled the game still Nothing
---
Sweet as thanks for the info.
---
Add a bit of broccoli delicious!
---
*Zzzzzzzzz*
---
Oh, you're still trying.
---
Ok, in response to your blank [deleted] link, here is [incontrovertible proof](https://youtu.be/oHg5SJYRHA0) that you're wrong, and I'm right.
---
Wow sorry dude, it works for me and I've had it work for a few other people too.  I apologise it didn't and wish you good luck
---
Just to be clear, you were doing it at the lighthouse, right? I got it mixed up with the event at the spiritual retreat center in the mountains, felt like an idiot when I realized.
---
You want new characters for people to be free of dupes, yeah that would get rid of a fraction of them, but not all. And not everyone has the time to build a survival only character, leaving out the players with no time with no dupped weapons. New characters would stop the “cheese builds” for like a week then it’s back to the players with time dominating all over again spawn camping. Maybe less time because they already have their build mapped and know what perks they need exactly
---
Yup, I finished after level 50 and use the Blade of Bastet to one-shot ghouls at Whitespring, with 2x sneak damage.
---
you *need* ordinance express. and the auto grenade launcher is your only viable option, aside from grenades in general of course.
---
but carry a bunch with you because they break as if they were 3d printed.
---
Yes, was there confusion on that?
---
My last one hasn't showed up either, and my fifth one dissapeared.I still haven't figured out how to put them in my camp. They aren't in the inventory anywhere. I feel like I'm missing something.
---
Yea, Jesus doesn’t come off very well in that story (strange sentence...) he doesn’t seem to understand that his brother likes a girl?  WTF is the point of surviving the apocalypse if boys and girls don’t get together?  How the heck else would a guy with food impress a girl without... give her food... it was terrible!
---
The 5% per hit is a multiplier to attack damage (so 1.3x at six hits, for example), probably applied fairly late in the damage calculation process. It should multiply with any perk card bonuses, but I couldn't say anything about Explosive because it's barely defined in the ESM.
---
Nine hits appears to be just the maximum cap for the stored value. The six-kill cap for Adrenaline is stored in the same way. I doubt there would be any rollover reset.
---
The ten second duration might be per-hit (so each hit gives you +5% damage for 10 seconds), it might be time without a hit before it resets, or something else entirely. I'd need to dig out the scripts to tell.
---
I don't see any indication that it cares about misses, or which target you hit, but I can't rule that out either.
---
Prime gauss rifle
---
If you mean for the sniper rifle, the hardened receiver has the most damage. It's better than any .50 receiver
---
If you mean legendary effects, instigating explosive would probably do the most. Maybe bloodied explosive if you ran a low health character
---
I'm on xbox :c sorry
---
Were you a duper?
---
&lt;kuzco&gt; HAAAAAA! &lt;/kuzco&gt;
---
I think you’re overstating the effect of organically obtained legendary items. Especially after all the nerf to legendary spawn rates and how absolutely crazy rare god roll items actually are. Full set of assassin’s/sentinel gear is crazy OP, a single piece, ehhhhhh not really. Single star bloodied Handmade is strong, but if the player doesn’t have a god mode armor set to keep them alive they fall to a few well placed shot.  
---
I think that legendary gear is important to the game, and as long as the duping and astronomical farming rates are kept in check.
---
Close the game and restart it
---
Yes, we are currently reverse engineering the server software bethesda currently has running on the amazon cloud servers.
---
I heard dozens if reports that it only happens to dupers or cheaters. Is this true? LoL
---
Awww, you still crying? ROFL
---
If you ever frequented the FB tradings communities, their prices always seemed to be much higher than here, and the number of "crosspost auctions" between both platforms has risen equally in line with the prices here.

Agree with the sentiment, but they need to create loadouts of pre-sets cards that you can equip with one keystroke. This shuffling through menus all the effing time is absurd. Doesn't make the game challenging, just annoying.
---
Yeh, sorry that you didn't realise. Always a common solution. GG :(
---
Just tell me. Are you kicking your feet right now?
---
Either high level player who realized how worthless caps are, or some poor fool not knowing the current prices. Maybe just some old player coming back and not realizing that this isn't December anymore before the TSE nerf or duping madness
---
No success
---
F
---
How many stims for imposter set?
---
I mean, that doesn't change the "It has to be caps, because fallout's used caps" baring 2, which...bethesda didn't care about much.
---
Wow thats awesome, to bad i may have missed this. I am about to go to bed.
---
Yourself if you shoot it at your feet :p
---
Yup, you're still crying. LOL
---
Tour guide at the asylum, wish I coulda saw ya!
---
So, there's a Sheepsquatch and an Impostor Sheepsquatch? Anybody seen the real deal yet?
---
That's sweet. I usually just use the wave emote when i leave
---
Priorities I guess man, ;)
---
I'm lvl 108 and i still haven't found it
---
No. It’s an online multiplayer game. You can’t be changing the rules for other people (until customer servers arrive, if they ever do)
---
Did they, though? No one out there but us chickens, no barter economy to speak of, outside of robots and one super mutant and all of the re-programmed bots would have, originally, taken good old fashioned dollars. 
---
That'ed be an interesting decision. "It would make SENSE, so we'll do that" instead...caps.
---
There's a spawn point in Grafton steel, there's a YouTube vid for it

I literally do the exact same thing. One prominent cat poster, and then hide flamingos for little surprises in the future
---
no matter how rare, someone is *eventually* gonna come across a god/good roll. and now they have an edge over everyone else, because, like you said, those items are crazy rare.
---
and with the changes to survival, bloodied builds can now survive longer. someone being sneaky with a bloodied hadnamde for example could take the entire server out 1 on 1.
---
What are they?
---
Nah, I didn't waste any time. Telling people "you should search for bugs before you make the 200'th post on that subject in the last ten days" is not a waste of time.
---
I got 90 stims
---
My credits fell on the Friday but did not rise on the Sunday this Easter bundle is a lie
---
Doing this on PS4 doesn’t let you join a server. You have to add them as a friend first and hope they accept a random add
---
Can verify, I snapped earlier while wearing it and the server dropped :(.
---
Just wait until the week is over and they all self-destruct. It’s gonna blast you into orbit.
---
Yes. Since launch
---
Yeah it can be soloed, you just need any 5 pieces of sentinel armor, any level and any type will work. You just need to have enough to get the nearly 100% damage reduction. Then you back yourself into the space between the conduit and the stump so you can't be staggered. Then you are pretty much invincible and can solo it without issue.
---
I was there on a Monday so I wouldn't have to worry about tour groups wandering through the shot or anything.  Still...it's cool af that you're a guide there!  Definitely want to take a tour the next time I'm in the area.
---
oh shit
---
\+50% at 0 DR is correct for Berserker's. It drops to +38% at 1-20 DR.
---
There is absolutely nothing short of a cure for cancer that would entice me to give the Atom store a single penny.   Never so much as a cent.
---
okay, that's good to know. Thanks
---
It's weird, I've been opening the shop each day all week and only have 3 as well
---
Come in September, November, April or May if you don’t wanna worry about a lot of people!
---
Fight club opens in 15 minutes
---
Exactly. I for one, definitely don't have a Furious Plasma Gatling which I only bust out for things like the Scorchbeast Queen.
---
I'm afraid they don't sell it for PC at Target. And that's sad, because that's the closest store that sells games to me...
---
It seems that a line space is required to make paragraphs visible, so I've edited to the best of my limited writing skills and added a line space where I think it's needed. I might add, I'm not a writer.
---
Ok-  
---
1. It would get rid of 100% of dupes. If you can’t port in weapons or armor where would they come from. Duping has been finally patched. Legendary spawn rates have been nerfed hard too.  
---
2. Cheese builds are 100% gear oriented. Literally everyone has access to the perk cards and builds.  
---
3. The suggestions I made would prevent exactly this.  
---
4. Never said that at all. I think you’re confusing viable with visible. By viable I mean they function like the savage divide where enemies can spawn at any level.
---
Well, that's not a bad thing! :)
---
okay :)
---
no idea just scared
---
Stealthboys definitely need to be nerfed.
---
There’s a lot of issues honestly. But lately I’ve noticed many people in survival not seeking out fights or kills. A faction based survival server with faction events pitting factions against each other for rewards would change this. It would be much more fun to me and provide more incentive to fighting and participating in PvP.
---
Oh you gonna get da ban train! Bethesda is on the way!
---
“Hey, can you give me some of tha-“
---
“**COMMUNISM IS NON-NEGOTIABLE**”
---
Cost and scarcity of ammo. Also explosive weapons haven't had their damage boosted yet after they nerfed the shit out of demolition perk. AGLs and the missile launchers break incredibly fast even with gunsmith 5 and weapon artistan rank 3 repair.
---
The black Easter eggs remind me of the face hugger eggs from Aliens.
---
I’d much rather have .01 of the player base with an OP build than 10-25%.
---
Indeed and it starts somewhere
---
Sugar Bombs too.
---
this guy snipes
---
Blowing yourself up ;-)
---
Ordnance Express is mandatory, as is Demo Expert 5. You probably want enough INT to swap in Science to make better grenades / mines ... 6 or so minimum.
---
I rarely use the auto grenade launcher, I mostly gather up mobs and drop bombs / mines / grenades on them.
---
Do a full restart. Maybe search for your question first. This has probably been asked 200 times over the last week. No offense intended, I've just seen a lot of these and the solution is the oldest tech support trick in the book.
---
I tried that, it doesn’t seem to be working for me. Went there and server hopped like five times but nothing was ever there.
---
It’s all cool thanks
---
It should be part of the base game still, but the Perk Loadout mod does exactly that. I've got 4 perk loadouts set up and can swap between them from the perk screen with a single key.
---
Its a good idea to be Armored against your Explosions. A Dense mod for the Chest and Strengthened Limbs makes a big difference. 
---
 My BoS Heavy Combat is immune to Explosions. ;)
---
In you pip boy you can go to the effects screen and it’ll tell you everything effecting your character
---
🤣😂😂😂
---
Well, no shit. You're talking about a boost that lasts 30 sec only after fighting. That's irrelevant.
---
Yeah, I did say that. After looking it up, I found that Super Sledge and Grognak's Axe are the two most powerful, followed by Power Fist. I was mistaken at first.
---
Do you not understand how math works? What you just described is the exact same as giving a flat +25% after all the other boosts are given.
---
Let's say you have knuckles that do 100 base damage. Then you have a perk that gives +20% damage. That makes it do 120 damage. 
---
If you have Talons, multiplying 120 by 1.25 gives you 150 damage. The way you're describing is doing 100 times 1.25 then 20 times 1.25 and adding together. Well, 100•1.25 is 125, and 20•1.25 is 25. 125+25=150, exactly the same. All boosts in this game are multiplicative. I love how you think some work different, and therefore you don't even know what multiplicative means.
---
Your profile says you haven't played anything yet?
---
Same
---
Lol, No
---
Same here, i finally got the onyx to spawn after closing everything waiting an hour and going back in. I gavw tried using tge atom shop link in the news splash screen that helps but not enough. Apparently i got a 4th at some point didnt know it. So now i am 5 of 6.
---
 Its the BoS mods for Combat Armor you are looking for. They seem t6o be very rare.
---
I only have one egg out. And that's one too many. I don't trust Bethesda until tomorrow and nothing happens lmao

Ok I'm dumb. I forgot you can't repair a 200% condition item until it's under 100%. This must be why the option isn't there. Thanks!
---
If I have read this right 12 times, he had a sword that he shouldn't have had and got a temp ban? Ok...? What's the problem?
---
It seems ok. I've had this base for a while and changed nothing. I'm on Xbox One. So I'm wondering if it's specific to the console but that doesn't make sense to me lol.
---
A Mushroom world boss would be cool. I imagine it would work like the Fable 2 trolls. Its a giant mushroom that raises out of the ground and the monster is beneath it.
---
True but there is a bit of lore as to why
---
Yeah this -1 is about my mutation, it's cool about it. As I said, when I'm using strength based alcohol, it's going to -2 instead 0. This is point about glitch.
---
Still going on?
---
that's not exactly balance. it wouldn't change much, if anything at all. 1% or 10%, those people will still steamroll everyone else.
---
in fact, at least as it is now, people without a BiS in every slot can still compete thanks to duped weapons.
---
Two ghouls spawned on me yesterday when I was using the terminal.
---
So you won't include your friend but you want to name and shame somebody who we have no idea did anything wrong? I'm pretty sure any of that is against the rules here, maybe you should read those.
---
Well that's a little too specific
---
Did we get a single shot Luger look alike that we craft from pieces of our wardrobe? How about  .45 revolver? Either of those would pass as the Bond Golden gun.
---

You can wear most headwear over power armor if you take the PA helmet off.  You lose the 'gas mask' benefit though.
---
They fixed the campfires. But you can still use the rug/mat trick, but sometimes it's very hard to pull off, and you can't blueprint it. If you blueprint, it will give you floating errors when trying to place it. But we definitely need planters and the greenhouse building set!

Are you sure you don't mean cripple rather than stagger? Explosives deal damage to every limb, so they tend to cripple a lot, even if you have Fireproof &amp; Dense.
---
Seems to be, haven’t received much feed back on what’s been gotten... well no feed back actually lol.
---
The guy didnt know it was hacked in and bought it because it was 300 caps. Our server got took down right after he got banned and somebody got kicked off their entire internet right after.
---
Sorry that comes across way snarkier than I meant it.
---
Haha now to find out how to join a specific server
---
Apologies, I was referring to the color.  I assumed it was a tip of the hat to GoldenEye.
---
I have now included his name and also he is a new player and it is a dev room weapon as of right now
---
Huh?, settings maybe? Not being a creeper checking your profile just making sure not a troll I know 76 has had some problems with them, I'll send a friend request if you still want to team up?
---
I was just about to post this but thanks for doing it for me
---
Could it be because how horribly unbalanced it is? A clean slate might be what’s needed to actually make the PvP aspect of the mode worth it.
---
Dude! Read the rules! That is *not* what I meant!
---
Me too... I've lost 12 items since I started a log on what I put on my mule. Armor, weapons, and magazines.
---
I don't disagree with you at all. I have been playing PC games since the early 90's. Played every Fallout except Tactics. F76 is the worst work done on any of them. I actually believe it has more bugs than all the others combined. My biggest issue is with disappearing items. Not something you accidentally sold or scrapped. Items that just went poof! Lost my All-star Super Sledge that I had equipped when I died. Respawn and it was gone. Picked up a Cultist Dagger and fast transported to camp to repair it and it was gone. I actually inspected it before I left. That's just two, there were others. Meanwhile Bethesda remains silent and fails to address the situation. T do know this is the last Bethesda game I purchase without it being out long enough to get good or bad comments. Not going to be their tester again. They didn't pay me. I paid them.
---
It’s completely relevant in regards to achieving the 5k listed damage, and applies to both fist weapon and 2h, so with or without it the result is still the same, fist weapons have higher damage.
---
The multiplicative bonus is big because it applies to all the other effects. And no not all damage boosts are multiplicative like any cards that boost a weapons damage specifically such as iron fist or slugger are both additive damage boosts.
---
Making bloodied, adrenal, and everything else provide 25% more of their effect is why they are superior.
---
Seriously make a post asking this sub, you will see that fist weapons are better.
---
same on pc
---
Yeah sure I'll be on in a couple hours, I'm level 93 play just about everyday
---
When i use my bloodied melee character, i simply cant be a conduit, i have to be in the face of the imposter sheepsquatch to deal damage and usually im the person who trys to make sure he gets focused so that i can act as the tank for the ranged users, i lose health too fast if im conduit and die
---
If we are friends you just join on my in social tab
---
no apologies necessary Amigo. I'm just having a laugh. I am sure that you are right, and it is a nod to Bond.
---
If you buy something that's illegal and didn't know it was illegal, you still committed a crime. Same rules, apparently, apply here. 
---
File a ticket with Bethesda, include any video proof and hope the ban is truly temporary. There's not a lot you can do.
---
not for me on PC. the benches in Harper's ferry church do the same thing and they aren't close.
---
Yeah, I'm definitely one of those that isn't looking for PVP specifically. I'm just enjoying the game doing the story etc but loving the extra tension that survival mode brings, I might get in to a PVP encounter if I bump in to someone.
---
no worries then, all good brother.
---
"Yup"? You actually admitted to kicking your feet?
---
This, this might be a first for me. 
---
 I'm really not sure how to feel, I'm all tingly right now.
---
We all have reported the player to bethesda and xbox. As of right now we have done all out of our power.
---
Hit it with a cryolator. Easier to kill and easier to find.
---
I'll be logging off for the night soon just catching up with messages but I'm on just about every day too I'll look out for you
---
Pretty sure I missed an egg because I was not doing this.
---
Then all you can do is wait.
---
Plus the pain of swapping perk cards around a gets tedious very quickly!
---
You have some interesting points
---
I indeed came across your post while googling for this! Thank you, OP! See you in Appalachia sometime!
---
There’s still dupes methods that come out,  they’ll never be gone, i point to gta v look at that, Those are there, they are merely bandaids,
---
I have endurance at 7 and I got sick from a diseased radrat walking past me earlier. I wish I was exaggerating.

You can't place any Atomic Shop item in other's camps.

Again, these OP builds only work because they have *all the pieces*. Without complete sets they are not as powerful by a *large* margin.
---
It's gotten better ( it's still not perfect ) but earlier store images at times were outright lies or at least misleading. Often making it look like things came with an outfit for instance that didn't. 
---
Even now "is that statue a desktop sculpture or 10 feet tall?" because there's no frame of referenece for scale.
---
There is a small wall that surrounds whitesprings everything inside.
---
I logged in every day specifically to get the egg each day before i would start playing and somehow one of the Eggs would not show in the atomic shop so another waste of time...thx BETHESDA (fist to the face) for your glitchy atomic shop.
---
I don’t think that’s a good enough reason to not try to make a mode that has been unsullied by OP weapons and gear.
---
Thanks for the tip!  We were thinking our next trip might be a winter one :)
---
Rifles are OP. Especially compared to pistols.
---
Even when my limbs don't break with the explosive turrents or explosions in general i stagger. Can't shoot or move.  I've been running with assumption that explosions have their own stagger proc rate. Its why a high rof aae can tear through a ass/sent. The hit that staggers (even in the air) is followed with more hits.
---
The limb damage is another explosive effect for sure.
---
My drunken ass was too drunk for me to remember. It was on PS4. Anyway, kudos to you too
---
You’ll lose your carry weight bonus too if Excavator is your cup of tea.

PC
---
we're going in circles now. as I've stated before, a 1/* bloodied handmade is capable of taking out an entire server for example. and all you need is the bloodied handmade itself.
---
you don't need assassin's/sentinel gear to break pvp. 1/* legendaries manage that well enough.
---
Melee your way thru them, that's the route I took.
---
😳
---
I wish it was a full outfit at cap. Pairing it with the sheepsquach mascot outfit feels generic.
---
Look up the random event spawn maps. I go north of Abbie's Bunker as there's three spots close to each other. That's where I've found two of mine.
---
At level 30? I had a level 40 glowing one obliterate me. I can't imagine how quickly a 62 would take me down. XD
---
Have you reported your sighting to the ABA? Borders share sightings cause they care. :)
---
You should be able to kill them pretty readily at 30. I recommend power armor or a hazmat suit though. They deal a lot of radiation damage.
---
It just has to have a connector nearby. Doesn't make it look any better though.
---
Nope. The .50 Receiver does the exact same damage as the Hardened. Go check it.
---
Most of my perks are on strength plus all the mutations and lots of perk cards that help with melee. Plus a fire ax
---
I found mine at the random spawn on the road, under the RR track, west of Big B’s, in the Mire.
---
Sorry. Maybe next year:)
---
How many friends do you have in your friends list? if it's hundreds try deleting a bunch...this will help with heavy lag and worth a shot if you've tried everything else.
---
Are they squishier thaan their level implies? I've had a pretty tough time with a 21 deathclaw and 40 glowing one, and can barely make a dent in 50 scorchbeasts. I have freshly crafted level 30 weapons.
---
So you're saying that each rank of Slugger only adds like 10 damage? That's not true at all 😂
---
I think so. I never use guns on them though. I main a sledgehammer.
---
What is it
---
Nice use of the spoiler tag
---
What ones do you need? I’m about to log on I’ll see what I can do
---
Hmm, I'm a rifle build. Maybe I'll try one next time instead of just leaving. Ironic thing is, they aren't even the crown/boss enemy of the area.
---
Who knows? They could implement something like this soon. They've been making a lot of changes since the disastrous release, so maybe they'll put something like this in. I'd like for them to. I agree that it would be a nice change of pace.
---
What do you want for all your copper friend? 😁
---
   
---
There is a way to force the event, just go to where the ships are, kill some creature and return to the station, which activates the event every time you enter a server.
---
Will the lasr egg be available in 12h? Sucks if it wont since cant get on till then
---
yep Bethesda can't even make their damn atomic shop work correctly...i collected every day multiple times and missed 1 due to it not showing up. Guess we have to wait till next Easter.
---
They’re definitely worth going after for the XP.
---
The price is 20 per.
---
Dear lord they haven't fixed this bug yet.  It's been over 5 months!  Horrible bug, no fix.

Will the last egg be available in 12h? Sucks if it wont since i cant get on till then
---
IGN lazarus801
---
Que?
---
Nope. Different bugs we're talking about.
---
I kind of do the same thing but with strobe lights. I place about 15-20 in the main room.  Causes headaches real quick.
---
You’ve not been running Adrenal Reaction, Adrenaline 5 and accidentally hit yourself with your own Nuke Mine or Fat Man at low-ish health.
---
I’m *mostly* explosion immune. I’m not if I get the damage amped up enough.
---
I lost over 70 purified water &amp; a bloodied death tambo they were in favorites one minute &amp; gone the next. I was hoping the item loss was just a rumor but I logged in &amp; all my water was gone.  I had assumed I just dropped my weapon but now I think after the water disappearing that there really is a glitch.
---
Factions would be the perfect key. Have a mechanism to declare and make it at least a bit of trouble to switch (ie, you can’t just switch immediately and then switch back, etc.). That would be ideal.
---
And there’s no way to get a hint for a tse?
---
Seems you also struggle at reading comprehension and understanding how commas work. Go figure you can't understand basic 5th grade level reading comprehension.
---
Don't give up buddy, inconvenient server crashes are basically part of the gameplay experience.
---
Caps are easy.
---
Do you know when the last egg will be gone from the shop? Cant get on for 12h and sucks if i miss it
---
It’s almost a right of passage in this game
---
Not sure, but it does pair well with the Sheepsquatch Mascot Outfit, imo.
---
It's no more specific than any other end game boss from any mmo. Actually a lot simpler.
---
I just dread the day i want to pick up an amazing 3* weapon and then the server crashes. This day will come but it is not this day.
---
I can't even get to the menu. It crashes as soon as I hit a button
---
No tse’s out this time a few two shot’s bunch of bloodied melee. Some furious rifles, 5-7 heavy guns. A chest full of armor that is still there as of five minutes ago.
---
yes they definitely need a male outfit, more quests....and probably their own vendor.
---
It will be! Until 8pm tomorrow!

The Easter event had a mystery surprise everyone thought was going to be released on the 7th day but they released it on the 6th day (today)
---
I think it defeats the purpose of the game. Fallout 76 is all about doing everything the way you want. And if you're forced to fight an enemy in a certain way then what's the point of all that customization?
---
Do u have any bloodied things
---
Nah I  cant get on, gotta go to bed. Hope I didnt miss the first one, tho.
---
Yo let me at some of that oil, you on now?
---
You tell me what you can spare. I am running too low

Yeah I've had a number of things vanish over the past few weeks but I know I didn't drop my favorite gun. Nor do I sell weapons to vendors. It's sad to say the least

I can to 70. Is that good?
---
Yessir gt is MrMedick. I have 61 total at the moment.

75 and Deal?

Aww. I have yet to get one of those in game. I found one item. Thanks for doing this thing. It’s really cool to see veteran players who do stuff like this.

Rad gonna pop on now
---
I was taking care of a wendigo and some ghouls going after the pylon person at the one down the hill a bit. My back was to the main fight when it ended so I didn't have any idea where to even look. Still tried for a good 15 minutes but no luck.

MrMedick91 sorry*

Sure gt AngryDylan001.  Join me . How u want to do this?
---
Wow, where is there a behemoth in this game? Have never encountered one
---
Hmm... you damage calc shows that a TSE Handmade is stronger against the SBQ than a ZE Handmade.
---
I think the Receiver is not quite correct?  Or if it is, TSE with Hardened receiver is simply better than Zealot-Explosive and Scorched receiver.
---

Always a rabbit next enclave location, spawn at "The Whitespring Service Entrance" and head south and on the hill theres always a rabbit but use vats to find it and if you went passed "The Whitespring Bunker" location then you went too far.
---
Nope the arms are all of the added benefits you need
---
I live in WV and haven’t heard of these, what are they used for?
---
What console
---
I would use melee to level. rifle builds arnt really that good until your high level with a decent sniper and a bunch of perk cards
---
Not quite sure, I'll message over Live
---
Ok
---
Stealth Boy Mark 3 don't work and refuse to be consumed when I attempt to use it.
---
Thanks. I usually see them near the overseers camp, but not today.
---
No, it would be too easy. if this did ever happen it would need a good reason, for example after so many lvls you get to pick or change a vault faction and can fast travel to any vault of your particular faction.
---
free fast travel across the maps is just too easy, and you have workshops for that anyway.
---
Hope you didn’t either it’s a fun new item to have
---
I really hope I’m just having a forgetful moment &amp; that I used the purified water for something.
---
It would be a shame if people are really losing this many items. It would help if favorited items were locked.
---
A vendor buddy of mine has now stocked Lewisburg with new legendaries
---
I on your server now.  I have almost all of them.
---
I think it may apply the reduction to base damage after all other reductions. So if your resistances being the damage down by 55%, Fireproof 0's the damage.
---
Yeah think I know wont spoil it for other tho.
---
Well, explosions do have a stagger value in the ESM, but I don't know if it's used. The value is "small" for explosive turrets and "none" for explosive legendaries.
---
Save the trade for me until I can play
---
Have school

Also I'll give you a link to my weapon trading thread in case anything catches your eye. 😄

The vast majority of perks and gear is useless anyways, there really is only about 10 pve builds that are viable emd game. Also anyone can toss that gear on to solo it. It's just the only way to solo it right now. You can use other builds but you won't be able to solo it easily with any other build.
---
Would love me either more budget space or an apartment I can purchase at Watoga or a house at Whitesprings or personal room in fort defiance that we can decorate and would be its own seperate cell so it can only be loaded when I attempt to go into it.

I pick up a conduit and then run to another and emote "follow me" while jumping. Sometimes it works.

A lot of people here don't like your ideas, fot good reason, but you do have a point.  It feels like some people just dominate survival and those people always seem to have high damage explosive legendaries that they spawn camp with.  Virtually every time I've been spawn camped it's by one of those "crackle crackle respawn" weapons.
---
I get the idea that restarts would make the problem go away for a week before legendary farmers would redominate, however explosive weapons wouldn't be nearly as common if all the duping glitches have been removed. I think fresh would still have problems, but not as bad.
---
How about this:  I want a no legendary, or highly restricted legendary, survival mode.  Characters are one way only but you can make a copy of an existing to keep quest progress and plans. 
---
Just imagine Chameleons being completely unarmored. Power Armor being decently viable.  Fights that rely on tactics and strategy and not crackle crackling some poor shmuck spawning in.  I'd play it in a heartbeat.
---
Sorry, first come first serve. I'll have a bit of bulk on my maybe next week. And im not interested in weapons. I have everything i need pretty much
---
 Thanks though.
---
No bs when I say this.  I’m fighting a scorch beast queen above Watoga...... wtf
---
You eat them! They’re delicious! 
---
They aren’t around all year. Only this time of the year. 
---
We find them in dark hollers with a lot of trees. 
---
You pick them (not pull them up with the roots!) and after you wash them, fry them. We use flour, corn meal, salt and pepper to bread them. 
---
I’ve went moocher hunting ever since I was a tiny thing :)
---
Ha, I paid 2500 for my Tse Lever And 3000 for my Tse Handmade after the nerf.
---
What's ur gt?
---
I honestly would love to have them ingame.  They're were luxury to have in fallout new vegas...
---
Until you get jurry rig.
---
But I will never pay real money for ingame consumables.
---
Not unless they changed it
---
Ok, thanks. If that's true then tank killer is still a must have for pvp. I'll borrow a friend with a full set to confirm there isn't something magical about the aae.  Thanks for the info.

The level 40 glowing ones are much tougher than the level 62 charred ghouls. Ideally you avoid taking on a bunch of the level 62s at level 30, but one at a time should be ok. PA helps a lot because it blocks the rad damage.
---
You don't normally see the higher-level ghouls in the Ash Heap as it's level capped, although there's an uncapped area around the Rusty Pick and maybe others. Monogah is uncapped, so if there's a high level player anywhere near then you'll get max level enemies.
---
always next year :)
---
Bookmark
---
if you still have the machete tomorrow I would be interested. I can't sign on until tomorrow and if it sells before then good for you.
---
I missed the 2nd.
---
Fuxking ridiculous
---
I was planning to sort of hide them around my camp like regular Easter eggs, but then I found I could put them on the mounted wendigo and when there's an option like that I'm going to take it. Shame we can't leave things floating like in FO4 because I'd love to have made it look like the wendigo was juggling 3 of them.
---
Having the animation make use of equipped melee weapon and use a stick for non compatible items is a fun idea!
---
600 caps for UA
---
My gamertag leads others to believe im a guy so that helps a lot.
---
we might need the 7th egg to summon the great deathclaw god
---
Haha nice. I just have one up on the classic column. Where I can see it at all times :P
---
Fantastic thread. Sadly, Bethesda now knows exactly what to nerf next
---
Slugger, martial artist, incisor
---
No my floors were fine before the patch I have a theory that in the last update they updated how fast and in what order items spawn into the world because after last patch my base spawns really slow so somehow they must have either 1) changed the order of which items spawn or 2) changed the way the floor physics work because not only are walls showing thro but the mirror ball is showing thro my floor to.
---
I love how some of these places actually look BETTER in FO76 than real life. Like that bunker. lol
---
The Rusty Pick is exactly where I saw one for sure. Another at the Monongah power plant, and one in Monongah itself. That, plus the 50 scorchbeast keeping me from getting to my Into The Fire quest marker, and I decided to take a break for a nit.
---
How big of a radius do high level people impact enemy levels? I've noticed a lot of higher level people camping somewhat nearby regularly for the encryptid event.
---
Awesome idea! I’m there now and have hidden some items myself.
---
I'll give you 25 caps each for the bulk if you save it 🙂
---
And also find someone to group with. When you have the vendor, you take turns loging in and out, every time you log in his inventory changes.
---
im ready [https://i.imgur.com/PL8Dv95.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/PL8Dv95.jpg)
---
u/watsonhorror  has put some in Lewisberg
---
No, the mark 3 has been broken since 76 dropped
---
They haven’t ever worked to my knowledge.
---
If you are willing to team up I’m sure people would be more than willing to help you try again.
---
I'm using those with the vault girl mascot head. A bunch of my photo mode pics are her wearing different outfits in different poses all with the mascot head.
---
Ahhh I feel it growing.
---
Yes it's on console. I know i can dump them on a junk drive. But then they won't be there for my loading screens and I can't have that. Such fond memories.
---
I'm sorry, I'm keeping prices quite firm. Maybe no one else will want copper. And you can still get it for 20 caps a pop. I have 25 bulk and would like inventory space.
---
We just say "dafuq?*
---
I’ve never known I’ve needed something so badly....
---
One question, do you have a canned coffee?
---
Not sure why people still run the sheepsquatch!??
---
My area chat doesn’t seem to work.
---
Ok mate, tell me what do you want for the drinks :D
---
I like some of your ideas, factions and role playing look cool (if only I ad time to play with a team which every one is role playing a class...)but I just don’t like survival, and making me have to create a new character would definitely make me never try, even for the sweet rewards
---
... are those ARK plots?
---
Thats happened to me. It went away a while later.
---
Sure. I'll even take up the burden of being a conduit for all three pylons if it's necessary, but I can only do it as long as my supply of Nuka-Cola drinks last.
---
are there 2 different kinds of lockers? the plans arent exactly labeled the best after all. (for example the military cot is not a cot just a smaller bed.)
---
Also they will not increase your stash. nothing does.
---
I had this issue with all of the bunkers in that quest chain.
---
Server hop until you find a bunker that you can move in. I would still get stuck, but spamming WASD and spacebar would let me move after a few seconds and as long as I kept moving I was fine. I wouldn't get stuck again until I stopped moving.
---
Depends entirely on how much damage you’re taking, I utilize white knight how you’re trying to and it works wonders. I’m a stealth sneak crit build, so I’m not taking damage that often, and my armor stays alright for a couple of hours or so.
---
6 total
---
Thank you for his knowledge, oh great one.
---
6
---
The locker isn't separate storage it's one of the lockers in the stash submenu in building mode .. the trick to the locker plans is there is actually 2 items in game that use that same plan with the same name so you probably unlocked one you haven't tried building yet.
---
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UzbMBs5M4EebCSLliIoYU4uIHtIo5rBi7qQkOA-hNHk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UzbMBs5M4EebCSLliIoYU4uIHtIo5rBi7qQkOA-hNHk/edit)
---
I have checked both locker buildables and neither lets me place it. Also how do you store all of your stuff?
---
Nope. They are everywhere all the time. Have been the whole time he game has been out. Level 50 and when more than 1 comes out I normally run for a safe spot to shoot from.
---
The radius is a few hundred metres, I think. It spawns enemies for any new player(s) who approach a spawn area, so in the worst case you're hanging around and then suddenly max-level ghouls spawn on top of you.
---
Life's hard at level 30. Stealth helps a lot if you're not going the PA/melee route.
---
I'm not really going for a certain build. 
---
It's more of a bloodied melee/rifle hybrid that utilizes dodgy and suppressor and such. But I could use the extra 2 points in agi for other stuff
---
I understand. I'll try and get on tomorrow 😁
---
dont know what to tell you, unless you forgot to read the plan or bought something like the footlocker thinking it was the locker.
---
I stroe stuff in my stash until full and carry the rest, then drop or sell what I need to lose over-encumbered.
---
game crash, logging in
---
Sounds good man! I look forward to trading with ya.
---
DUDE YOU SHOULD START A DISCORD SERVER! if someone needs something that you can't provide, it could be a place to ask someone else! or just to make anouncements, like when you'll be on, or request certain materials that you're especially low on (because with the kindness you've shown, you can bet there'll lots of people wanting to return the favour!).  also, it can be a place for other people who also want to set up a free crafting emporium (like myself) to make themselves known!
---
I can picture it already:
---
# THE FREE CRAFTING ALLIANCE!
---
^(also i just want some friends...)
---
Waaaaaaaaaa why
---
No problem
---
I like that idea!
---
Definitely interested :). I'm logging on now.
---
Fuck your rule 6.
---
Do you have empath mutation? What are your resistances?
---
It might even just be buggy sometimes when I play I seem to run into nothing but bullet sponges but after relogging I'm back to my normal damage I tend to avoid incoming damage at all costs as I run empath so I can't really say if my incoming damage has changed much since the update, but I know my outgoing damage is up in the air on each login.
---
I'm level 200 something and don't give one rat's ass about leveling up.  I specifically don't do things that'd give me extra xp like sleeping.  I have over 30 level ups I've never touched.  No use.  It'd be flipping wonderful to get something like that where I'd care about leveling up again.
---
Still some melee stuff out there?? Just added you? Would love to upgrade from this All Rise
---
There’s one in an unmarked pond South of Solomon’s Pond. Lvl 50. Always good for a high end assault rifle.
---
I love mushroom hunting. I cant wait to get some this year. Had bout 3 dozen last year. This would be a really awesome idea. Morell recipies to go along with it
---
&gt; Stealth helps a lot if you're not going the PA/melee route.
---
Oh I'm a sneaky bastard, thus the rifle build. I snipe most things before they ever know I'm there. Once they get to me, I'm kinda soft. XD
---
Yeah there might be I put a lot out others have added stuff. I have my shop open also down the hill.
---
Ok. Waiting to get into the world. Lol
---
Patrol duty quest at the jail seems to have a high chance to give it as a reward got it on 3 characters in a row.
---
Perks like hacker and lockpick should be passive.
---
Rabbit mask, check the headwear on the armor workbench.
---
ive been thinking the same AND they are in the game too, ive seen them in Flatwoods in the greenhouse area when doing the water testing quest and at various other greenhouse farms 
---
so it shouldn't be hard for them to make these part of the camp/workshop building as either the ones placed on the ground as seen in fallout 4 or in the planter tables that's in various locations through out the Appalachia wastelands
---
Personally I like to take it on and off because agility has so many good cards that it feels wasteful to try and save a few materials keeping it on.  If you combine it with fix it good then you won't really need much material anyways.
---
The white spring is the perfect place for that
---
Most are dirt cheap to make. Most junk can be bought for 3 caps each tops. Only harder one is coal but it’s still easy to get.
---
I wouldn't be scared this has happened to me twice. Both times Excavator PA pieces. I'm not even too worried about it happening again. I'm adjusting my record settings and going to watch for it.
---
If it happens again I'll know if it's a bug or my own error which is not likely but possible so I won't rule it out.
---
Isn't there a fissure site nearby?
---
I’m at the point where I’d like to launch a nuke if anyone ever wants to join? Or I just do daily challenges and I’m getting further into the Cranberry Bog missions. My psn is Chamberpot87
---
 Yeah, if you mess up placing it that will happen.  If caps are a consideration best bet is to server hop, then on the new server moving will be the normal price.
---
i just dont want to lose any of my PA pieces or my 2 shot ak, 2 shot lever action and an explosive shotgun and i'd use my level 2 melee but i dropped that character like 5 or 6 legendaries
---
It's so shame no one wants to share stimpacks anymore by teaming up.
---
Why do so many dumbasses  attack the invincible imposter STILL?! it's really honestly annoying
---
Oh okay thanks for letting me know! Do you know  if it's meant to be that way?
---
Armor bench
---
The hero we need not the hero we deserve.
---
it is in the amour bench.

---
Ya, but it’s a queen with no nuke or event
---
Legendary farming, wiping out daily vendor caps and atom challenges, crafting insane amounts of chems, farm the SBQ and Sheepsquatch, nuked flora farming, finding your “route” for your favorite junk runs. 
---
Event drops are huge for rare plans, legendary mob spawns, supplies etc. the best events to farm are uranium fever, monster mash, census violence, and distant thunder. West tek, artkos pharma, fort defiance, and all the buildings in watoga are great for legendary spawns outside of events. 
---
For maximizing farming and crafting output; green thumb, chemist, scrapper, and super duper are ridiculously abusable for making tons of shit, stack with well rested for extra exp, and use charisma boosts to sell for extra caps
---
Aw whut is it
---
Dude you're awesome thank you :)
---
Yeah, we are. But only one of us is making assertions based on faulty data.  
---
Two of my five characters are Bloodied builds. A lvl 211 heavy gunner PA user that only steps out of his armor to craft and sleep and a lvl 97 commando in full bolstering (mismatched and not optimized) armor. In PvE applications they are a house, in PvP it’s a liability.
---
That's what I'm thinking.
---
Ty +karma
---
i just bot the bos bomber jacket, goes great with the head
---
Oh man I didn't even notice that, good eye
---
Nice I have one also I’ll try it out thanks
---
I have noticed this as well, enemys attacking me but nothing in front or behind just bullets or laser beams all over the place.
---
The U.S. is huge, I believe the nearest nuke would be in Fallout 3's D.C., which would be an hour away from Harper's Ferry. As to why China/the Zetans/Vault-tec/the Enclave didn't nuke West Virginia, I have no clue. Perhaps they prioritized different regions. 
---
There are two crater sites near the Monorail Elevator in the Savage Divide that are pretty irradiated, but nobody knows why they're there. They're certainly too small to be nuclear impact sites.
---
get haxor
---
Got a legit ass 3 star assault rifle my first time completing the event. Does the sheepsquatch always spawn as a 3 star leg endary?
---
Neither, I don't frequent the official forums. Just occurred to me that the same system WoW and Eve use would be a good system for this game.
---
I was playing the other night while high as fuck and I decided to join the event. I'm only level 22 so I was doing shit for damage, so I just went around reviving people instead and I was even a conduit at one point. I used the majority of my stimpacks and tbh I don't think the reward was worth it really, but hell, it felt good just to participate and help people out and I regret nothing.
---
How dare you insult us with your nerdy creative suggestion .. this is FALLOUT SIR not some fancy shmancy role playing game!
---
On a side note 'd love to be a snallygaster or a fog crawler, well, a raider looking variant of them at least. But I'm surprised BGS didn't add in from the beginning us being able to select between super mutant, ghoul or human as there is no npc dialog requiring us to be human
---
Go do pvp or the queen
---
I don’t know if you saw the last message but a buddy of mine put some out down in lewisberg
---
Worth having just to equip when repairing armor.  Not so much otherwise.   Too many critical perks in agility.
---
i never got the first one :'(
---
Wouldn't be surprised, they all had 2 shot explosive gatling guns that they where showing off before I got kicked. I'm assuming all duped.
---
Wow, you are still crying?!?
---
 I'm only running 2 Adreneline. ;) A Legendary bot Explosion, a car and I lose 25% maybe.
---
Seems like you're doing an awful lot of assuming!
---
Btw apparently you can craft the item (armor bench) already.
---
I didn’t get that. He’s got his own hunt going?
---
Why is everybody getting downvoted??
---
Ok cool.  That's what I was hoping
---
Serves were terrible today I had trading problems I’ve never even encountered before
---
I really think it comes down to a certain personality, those that like "grindy" games.  I'm 42 and I enjoy the routine and love the fallout games.  They're pretty much all I play.  The last game I played was... Fallout 4.  My son is 20 and will play the ever loving hell out of a game for a year or so before he picks up another.  I got this for Christmas.  I'm level 200 something and he has 2 profiles as well, one at level 150 something and another somewhere around 90.  We just like the grind I guess.
---
Shit, just happened to me with the barn doors &amp; another plan ,, smh
---
Congrats? You want some internet justice points? You died, your fault, should've left them alone.
---
Ah I get it... guess the servers were unstable.
---
That’s not a terrible idea. I like the idea of like minded people coming together to help each other. My next few days are a bit busy, but I’ll for sure look into that.
---
I’ve been looking around, but how do you place the eggs in camps?
---
ROFL, got to love seeing integer overflow.
---
Shouldn't shoot her in the air anyway. Stagger effects mess with her landing.
---
Go to the menu in game then go to photo gallery chose the picture u want then press hide UI and then take a snapshot of it with your xbox
---
Aw did your comment get deleted poor little boy.
---
You are a vile, sick and wicked individual how dare you insult this great appafellatio with your denial of trade attacks!
---
Thanks, I'll try this! Do you know if this is a new bug or one that has been here for while? I remember a few months ago not having any problems with Abby's bunker?
---
If you want to shoot them, use VATS to aim for the legs.  If they hit, they hit hard, but if they can't catch you, they can't hit you.
---
I know...I should be ashamed of myself lol
---
I’d like it as a safe zone gathering point.
---
I must be lucky because when I run it, at least 20 times now, I am racing people to get the conduits active.
---
Past three times I've done I've gotten nothing but a damn fedora and something like a useless revolutionary sword, it is really tiring to be fair.
---
It doesn't actually cost that much to fast travel, especially now that they have unified the daily vendor cap quota.
---
Are they in the hotel or just outside...last question. Lol
---
"Cave Cricket is not a bug or animal. Just creature. Bug?" So ironic and funny lol
---
Thank you for your research as well
---
It’ll be in DLC at some point. Just be patient.
---
Disease cure farming savage divide: build 4 water purifiers. Get a stash of purified water. Equip green thumb. Start at whitesprings, go north to super mutants hut lake thing, go east across train tracks explore forest indent bit, south to mine,   head east when lined up with billboard, up hill through small ravine, canyon, turn and head towards billboard, head back down hill from behind the billboard. Go back to camp, equip super duper and chemist (the one that gives you 2*chems). I did this run twice and got enough glowing sap and firecracker berries for about 70 disease cures. Equip disease cure on quick select wheel. Never worry about diseases again.
---
And then they attack anyway? I can't see the logic.
---
Attacker comes preparred, not having anything to lose. They have always the advantage. To find out if someone can defeat you, all you need to to is to attack.
---
I logged off hard reset my xbox and turned it back on and my armor is acting normal again, p.s. my dumb self forgot i got new armor pieces and forgot to mod them😂
---
Yeah I’m gonna give it another shot tomorrow. Got work tonight
---
Lots of same plans over and over again, i got more than a dozen for some revolver’s ivory grip, i don’t even know what it does. The RNG is terrible. They really should prevent it from giving duplicate plans repeatedly.
---
They probably want to see your amor and what you are carrying. If you have 3* legendary armor and a TSE shotgun.
---
Not sure, I just bought the game a week or two ago.
---
Exactly, everybody begged for a bigger budget. Then they essentialy gave us that by making turrets and lights use less budget. *Immediately* people started complaining about the game being extra laggy.
---
Thanks for saying this. I've been closing and reopening my game trying to see this in the store ever since I got home from Easter dinner
---
TBH that guy is smarter than everyone else. Let everyone else do all the work while he gets the profit.
---
....so uhhhhh.....?....guess the Easter Bunny skipped my camp this year...anybody have any luck with the surprise?....I think I'm going to build a camp made of nothing but the black eggs...they stack well...and look cool...
---
It just works
---
Anyone who this hasn't happened to yet Refuses to believe it vehemently.
---
Can I get that twisted muscles serum??
---
Add me I’ll travel Appalachia with you I’m a level 120 melee tank. I think we’d be a good team
---
I think the bigger problem is that when an issue like this is brought up on this subreddit, a place that Bethesda reads, people just downvoted instead of acknowledging the problem. Look at how every single one of our comments is now negative numbers. So that means one person or two people came in and just downloaded it into Oblivion so that nobody else will really see the post in the problem can't be acknowledged and fixed. I swear to God people in the subreddit or children and I think I'm pretty much tired of it
---
Had no idea the Hunter's Legendary was that useful. Going to start collecting them now :)
---
Pretty messed up how people are just down voting
---
Yeah... I’ve wondered this myself. After visiting watoga and seeing the giant nests (?) on the top of several buildings I figured this would be a final quest location, then bam. Nothing.
---
Even with me and three people I know about voting your post it's still gone down to zero because people refuse to acknowledge it's a real problem
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
Indeed. It's actually pretty disgusting
---
My .50 reciever always takes the damage down one or two points vs hardened.
---
I just want to be caught in some decent traps haha
---
That all I've ever gotten from that scorched hagg
---
Thank you I'll try that I've never done it cause I would always just buy plans but this one doesn't appear to be buyable
---
Yeah
---
If I could post the video I would. I was trying to get it for a little bit gave up
---
Post a map pinpoint of where your camp is, someone can tell you if its blocking something important. Unless its a 1-day random A-Hole thing
---
People get on weird down vote trains. It happened to me with an explosive pipe rifle, and a set of legs. Neither was amazing and it was a few patches ago, so there's no "evidence" that people screech for.
---
Joining you rn, I'm a man named Joanna
---
What kind of greifing 
---
Like mess with people in a creative manner or distort there shit
---
I guess i'm gonna try pvp. But my build isn't made for that. Probably gonna suck
---
Woulda never known if I didn't start an inventory list. A guy wanted a certain magazine off my list and when I transferred to my character it was gone. That's when I discovered a few items missing. Since then, I've been more observant and items continue to disappear. I don't play with that character and only do trades with it. So I didn't accidentally use the aid item not did I sell the armor or weapons. It's definitely happening. Just glad it wasn't something good that I lost. Yet
---
I use heart, then wave.
---
If you don't see how that's a problem then this discussion is pointless.
---
That Vault Girl Mascot head looks so fun. :)
---
Yeah, I don't think ghouls have much armor at all, so anti-armor is wasted on them.
---
Does that persist exit and re-enter to server?
---
The night is dark and full of terrors.
---
Idk the heart kinda feels like too much. I wished we had more emotes. There, i said it. I didn't think i'd ever say that.
---
Only theory I've heard is it might be tied to the new mounted heads. No idea if this is true since I haven't heard of anyone actually killing this random queen but can confirm her spawning all over Cranberry Bog.
---
 She's shopping. probably getting crappy Legendaries from Phoenix for her big show. ;)
---
Is a pipe wench a wasteland stripper that gives lap-dances?
---
Smh... if people will simply acknowledge it's a real problem then it can actually get enough coverage for Bethesda to notice and fix it.
---
Not new, just discounted
---
Because they are too lazy to fix the loot tables. They are too busy trying to make items for the Atomic Shop
---
I'll let you off the hook now. I know, I know, it was like staring into the sun too long, you're simply overwhelmed, but I really am bored now.
---
I had this during the Fasnacht Parade!!! Once you log out it’ll fix itself
---
Found that too.
---
I've only unlocked them through plans. Watoga station/BOS/Harpers ferry.
---
Haha your defending thief's. That I tried fo reason with. Too bad they died.. Their fault. You want some internet justice?
---
I'm most definitely not a victim. 
---
I never said I'm the only one bad stuff happens to. The message wasn't clear and i got it wrong. I said you were sorry for what i thought was a jab. 
---
Hard not to think that when you asked earlier why I was defending pedophilia. The way you worded it sounded like you were calling me one. I shared my bit of story to say why in the hell would I be defending that sorry shit.
---
My point was that believe it or not that terrible shit does happen. I never said it was rampant but that it isn't nonexistent. 
---
I've said him being homophobic was not okay. I did say it was a personal belief that I had never seen or heard in the years I've been watching him. I didn't have a reason to think he's hateful.
---
He admitted he used to think that way but no longer does and apologized for it. We'll see with time if it's true. If he hasn't really changed people will find out.
---
 
---
I've agreed before if he's abusing the reporting system it should be addressed. Why wouldn't YouTube look into excessive bans for one particular youtuber's channel? Everything goes through them. If you or anyone has evidence bring it to youtube's attention. What more can you say about it? 
---
Shun him yes, be a bigot no. It doesn't help anything. If there's an actual issue it makes it harder to take seriously if all you hear is name calling. You can state everything and fight bigotry without being hateful. You refuse to see the difference between name calling and defending yourself or others. 
---
Of course you stand up to the bully but you don't keep going once he quits, you've clearly won. The extra aggression is unnecessary and counterproductive.
---
You've made your point and are being left alone. Continuing to make this person miserable after they've learned their lesson makes you no better than them and you've become what you claim to hate.
---
There's enough hate in this world. Saying you're better than others only shows arrogance and walls. It's not only about ox. It shows through in the way you talk to people in your comments. You're almost always combative and abrasive. You speak as if everyone else is stupid or against you. 
---
There are nice people in this world if you give them an honest chance and I'm not talking about ox here. I hope the best for you and I'm not being facetious. 
---
So yeah this conversation is definitely going nowhere. I'm tired of it. We've no reason to talk anymore. We agree on somethings and don't agree on others. And that's okay. If he's truly messed up it'll come out in the wash. For the 2nd or 3rd time is it now? Let's agree to disagree and move along.
---
I thought ManBearPig was just a myth created by the radical left?!?!
---
Where are u farming ballistic?

No no no a fauschnaut parade!

yum yum deviled eggs count for the egg daily too!

What am I looking for? I see nothing.
---
When was the black one? I think i missed it
---
Well at least you're level headed and not bitter at all.
---
Xbox- I can repair weapons but there are no words. So I have to guess the stats and requirements
---
But is there A SECRET HIDING IN A PLAIN SIGHT?..
---
You can still get all of through the atomic shook just scroll down through all of the items for camp area
---
Outside, only... I typed that forever ago and never sent it sorry.
---
:(
---
not the reward I was hoping for, but still cool they gave us something.
---
the onyx one should still be available. I had to quit game and restart for it to show in atomic shop
---
Today
---
Nice
---
They're plan-only unlocks. The plans used to show up at some vendors, but not since patch 6. You can still find the mods at vendors.
---
Some events do drop random weapon mod plans. Back on the Beat is one of them.
---
How do I post a photo reply?  It is literally halfway between Slocum joes and overseers camp.
---
Yeah, it's odd but Stable Flux is the item version of the component Pure Flux, Similar to how Raw Leather is the item version of the component Leather.
---
Creating it like this allows the devs the opportunity to create more ways of how to get flux rather than just smelting flora in the future if they want to.
---
Huh..ok. Ill try that and check again. Thanks!
---
I’m also a bloodied sniper build. 
---
PvP is more about chameleon and Berry Mentats. 
---
I guess you 1 shot everyone, but people with executioner weapons can do the same to you. 
---
PVE... my current build can 1shot the 68 super mutants. Gun Fu makes kills quick too.
---
Nope, the old ones will only show up in the shop if you already got it.
---
Go to the headwear section of the armor bench, you should be able to craft a rabbit head.
---
Oh never mind then. I thought they were there regardless
---
Why wouldn't Bethesda want to be loosing money? Nobody likes it when money is tight.
---
You just mod a laser rifle with pistol grip and no stock.
---
Unless there is no laser rifle plan either
---
Some friends got a whole gallon bucket of Dryland Fish earlier this week, absolutely delicious.
---
Yeah, I mean that would be even better. I was trying to think of easy solutions for improvement within their current system. The entire system could massively benefit from an overhaul.
---
Were you walking along, minding your business before this happened?
---
I'm 17, love this game. Only level 63 but I attribute that to AP exams. Once summer comes? Beth better have some more content ready for me lmao￼
---
I never said that. It’s like you read what I say then rationalize it to your own nonsensical bullshit. A bit delusional there eh?
---
Yeah I also don't have a explosive plasma gatling that melts everything in sight
---
I didn't want to go there but you're forgetting player skill. yeah, if I'm fighting teams or get found first, I'm dead, but otherwise I can go on hours on the leaderboard. and that's just with a bloodied, non-explosive handmade and unyielding leather.
---
not that it matters. you've already conceded that you prefer 0.1% of the playerbase to be op instead of 10%, and that means legendaries are in fact a problem. pvp games shouldn't be unbalanced, last you end up with empty servers.
---
That's what I've been using to greet people/give out free stuff in Whitesprings all day.
---
I usually just go to Camp McClintock to get it
---
Sweet thanks, I just added that perk
---
oh dam hows it been a pain in the ass to do?
---
Totally agree.
---
From the video that plays in the background, it certainly seems like a place they built in the engine.
---
I'd love to visit it, it looks like a great little location.
---
I feel like browsing and buying at the Atomic Shop would be way more fun if it was a location we could actually find and visit and browse in the  Appalachia gameworld itself.
---
I loved the BioShock 2 multiplayer player's apartment. It was a little interactive area apart from the game but it was a full area and used to manage almost everything before you got into the game itself. It really did a lot for immersion.
---
Wow! Great tip.
---
people in this sub are irrationally attached to the game. they see anything slightly critic as dissent and overanalyze every single claim in fear that someone is trying to smear further the "good name" of Fallout 76.
---
it stems from every youtuber under the sun heavily criticizing the game, but it doesn't change the fact it's borderline paranoia at this point.
---
I can only hope this happens to more people so they'll wake up. maybe when a regular loses his prized legendary that'll be enough proof.
---
Let's take a look at what you said:
---
&gt; The **multiplicative bonus** is big because **it applies to all the other effects.**
---
&gt; And no **not all damage boosts are multiplicative** like any cards that boost a weapons damage specifically such as iron fist or slugger are both additive damage boosts.
---
This implies that multiplicative boosts will boost the entire weapon after effects by +25%, which is true.
---
However, this also implies that you think that non-multiplicative effects (which don't exist, as I said) will boost only the base damage of the weapon. With a STR of around 15, Super Sledge base damage will do about 200 damage, with no other boosts. A single rank of Slugger is +10%, which means you're saying that Slugger only adds about 20 per rank.
---
That isn't true. 😂
---
autos are better than semis. plus you get the meta pvp build.
---
I remember grinding that exact spot for those exact plans, keep up hope! I got a full set of plans for all the armor, wetsuit, and helmet. Try Harpers Ferry as well, it's got everything, but don't pick up any recipes or anything until you find what you need, or you'll have to wait for your cache to reload.
---
They just keep down voting every report of this..
---
This is a bug that has nothing to do with the purge wave. Items will disapear and this sub down votes any post about it. They wanna learn the hard way till it happens to them
---
Great breakdown!   
---
I'd classify a few of those as bugs for sure..
---
Yup. It started in the hub, about a hundred years from 76's present. this is just another retcon.
---
Yeah I've done tons of events I even farmed supply drops for awhile because someone posted they got it that way. I'm level 291 almost 900 hours I'm just that unlucky i guess.
---
All serums are cheap to make, costing 1 ultracite, 1 specific flux, and 2 batches of around 4-7 crafting materials. I'd recommend looking through the recipe lists [here](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Category:Fallout_76_serum_recipes) to figure out which recipe uses the materials that you usually gather. Though I'd recommend not using Grounded or Scaly skin since grounded needs Black titanium and Scaly skin uses Coal, both of which are on the rarer side.
---
You have closed the game fully and restarted right?
---
No, should i?
---
Sweet thanks, it’ll save me hella materials haha, appreciate it
---
Interesting. I didn't know that.
---
you could start by uninstalling them to see which one specifically is messing with the atom shop stuff. (my bet would be the inventory mod, and if not the the glowing item one) then looking to see if there is a fix.
---
I think back when it was first found out that mods were messing up the game there was some line you could plug into the ini file or something like that to fix it.
---
Close the game and log back on.
---
This just happened the past two weeks. I have no idea how to dupe stuff and why would someone want to dupe a backwoodsman issue 9 lol. I only had one so why would they remove it. It's all irrelevant stuff that has disappeared anyway so not a huge deal. But if I lost something good that would suck.
---
Yea I’m thinking about selling it because I’m finding it pretty weak, but then again I just equipped the white knight perk so hopefully it’ll change my mind about them
---
Maybe they just have so much stuff they don't keep track of what they have. They will see eventually
---
Content not found, faulty upload.
---
Terrific that did it, thanks you guys.
---
Don't worry. I missed the 2nd egg because of the whole 'reboot game to display updated atomic shop's crap.
---
This was me yesterday too, even the Mr. Squeeze sighting.
---
I spent 4 hours hopping for that longcoat, ran into the vendor 4 times, all of which didn't carry it.
---
Atleast I now have a nuka cola clock in my garage.
---
Which*
---
Harsh, sorry to hear that buddy..
---
😂😂
---
Well they were dumb to not log and  you to be running around with all the junk. You don't have friends to show this too so you shared it with anons..  you use meta builds so your not the brightest I'm the box but someone who wants to fit in our feel powerful. Can't figure it out for yourself.. waste of time
---
Lol I doubt it. Just another one of the lovable quirks of our game.
---
Wow thats a long time for a bug to stay in the game, thanks for the info.
---
Yeah, this has happened to me. I have 1 more card but am hesitant to use it.
---
lol thats shame, bought a bunch from another player but oh well things happen, thanks for the info.
---
Nuka beer
---
Yasssss
---
Nuka brewing Co.
---
Correct. I use .50 on my sniper and 308 on my TS bolt pipe
---
Np, at this point I'm not expecting much from Bethesda
---
sent
---
Take the right fork.  You will see some buildings on the left side of the tracks, start looking at the right side wall across the tracks on the right side.  Follow it down staying right at the rail split, then right again where you see a conveyor belt and yellow motorized car (mucker?) on the right.  There's enough nodes for over 100 ore in one pass.
---
You should try and catch it when fissure prime gets nuked. 10x more awesome :D
---
Great idea and would love it but they wouldn't do that since they want a cap sink where you lose caps to give you incentives to farm more caps or walk there.
---
This is amazing,  thank you!
---
Credit to my friend for taking this picture as soon as we got the Wendigo mount.
---
Several reasons:  
---
1. There's no way to substanciate this claim. No one's (to my knowledge) posted a video of it happening or shared a replicable way to trigger this glitch, so we don't see why we should be expected to believe it's anything more than user error.  
---
2. People are still weary of these kind of reports after the "trade bug". I don't think everyone claiming this has happened to them is lying (It's probably a very low number who are), but you never know with this community and the people who hover around it.  
---
3. There are already several other threads about this topic. The community managers have likely already seen this report multiple times, so it's redundant.
---
Sweet e-peen dude, I’m impressed.  
---
I’m not conceding anything. Legendaries are not the problem, full sets of .000001% drop rate items *are* the problem.
---
It would be great if this happend but I really doubt they will actualy go through with it
---
it's always happened at my camp, but fortunately it's only really noticeable on the roof.
---
So far I find a lot of people one shot me without me ever seeing them. Doubt they are hacking, but it's stupid bs and not fun . Serious balancing to be done for any type of fun fire fight. As is, it's shit
---
It's interesting that the wendigo doesn't appear on any of these lists, but it is sort of a special and unique case; a supernaturally-altered human being. I'd actually make the argument that assassin's weapons ought to harm them as they do other vault-dwellers.
---
This is either going to make or break the game (given its history i'm leaning toward breaking)....personally i hope it nerfs all those god build weapons and armour where people are paying max cap across 1 or even 5 accounts for an items. All those who got in early had access to duped weapons and possibly still do with an unfair advantage over people who played by the rules and im over it. Bring on god rolls for all or NONE.
---
i no longer have map marker to explore but i have 1050 hours in the game
---
I'm seeing 68 alot
---
Hmm
---
I looked through the Candy Shoppe at the displays of what it sells as un-lootable. I can confirm that Sweet Rolls do *not* count for the eat candy daily challenge. Wasted 51 caps on that, no biggie, just good to know.
---
I wanted to but I haven’t found a decent map of discoverable locations. I looked a while back
---
Gotta go with the classic apple in the mouth. ;)
---
They do work. All you have to do is favorite them and use them that way.
---
Last time I played there was some ass on an open mic shouting at people to activate the conduits before shooting the imposter, meanwhile me and one other guy were just desperately going around trying to keep the conduits going and ourselves alive while asshole distracts everyone else from the event
---
Incoming ban because they can't fix their game and blame you for their shitty programming and no testing trying to cut corners.
---
Might be able to get one from Scoot's cabin. Got to the Southern Belle Motel and read the note on one of the tables near Boomer.
---
Lol at your edit, people are constantly sharing bugs and complaints about this game, and most of them are generally well received and agreed with (plus did you miss the multiple 1000+ posts about how much of a mistake repair kits were?). When you make such an ignorant statement about this community, can you really blame them for not believing you when you claim to have been hit by the (as of now still unsubstanciated) disappearing weapon bug?  
---
Seriously, it sucks you lost your stuff, sorry, but don't be an ass.
---
Yeah very good points. The funny thing is I have on an eight hundred hours into the game at this point and I do love the game. But bugs are bugs and they need to be addressed to be fixed.
---
How big is a nuclear impact to begin with
---
Floor Decor, look for the DeathClaw and arrow to the left.
---
Good luck with that long coat hunt. I’ve been running him for almost four days with no coat.
---
Bottlecaps were a water-backed currency in fallout 1. That's what frustrates me about caps as a currency for bethesda...in 1, it was caps, as a harder to replicate (and thus forge) water certificate. 
---
In 2, it was a gold-backed NCR dollar. 
---
Bethesda comes along and it's pretty much "meh, whatever" in 3. 
---
New Vegas comes along, and at least some of the lore's there, you've got depreciated NCR dollars being replaced primarily by caps (I suspect purely due to the fact that it was built on 3's engine, on a tight deadline so why fix it) with, again, no real backing, but it was also trad-able for NCR dollars and legion denarius, which were actual precious metal coins... each had cap values, and were, per lore, accepted as currency in the region. 
---
Then Bethesda made 4, and it's "caps, because caps". 
---
Then they make 76, and it's "caps, even though that makes zero fucking sense".
---
Something similar happened to me the other day when I finally encounter that vendor but luckily he had that long coat in stock, but while browsing he just randomly die while I was still in the trade menu. Luckily, the trade menu didn't close so I was able to buy that coat. It was very bizarre
---
Oh hell yeah the cryolater is stupendous on that wanna-be goat. Just as good as it is on the queen
---
Level 22 is still pretty low
---
Legendary critters will be poo-bombing power armor because reasons now. 
---
*\*Splat\* +1 rad*
---
"What the ... " &lt;subtitles indicate legendary creatures are mocking you&gt;
---
"Why you ... oooohhhh ... " \**shake fist in impotent rage emote\**
---
Click in the item you want to craft, it should then expand into what level you want to craft it at. Some are every -5 level, some are every -0 level (5, 15, 25 or 1, 10, 20)
---
There is a robot hacking perk ...
---
Sort of yeah.
---
I imagine things will change with player vending, bothing adding a way to make more caps than the npc vendor limit as well as a sink for caps when people might buy more because of availability.
---
In regards to fast travel cost, all you need to do is position your camp in the south east and with vault 76 in the north west you have most of the map covered at reduced fast travel cost anyways. Add the travel agent perk and you're golden.
---
Thanks man
---
You're the reason the world is not fair
---
It's 1950's cultural inspiration; dresses were all women were allowed to wear.
---
Inaccessible with without mods/hacks. Every Bethesda game has a dev room where they usually have one of every type of item to use as reference objects and general testing stuff.
---
You find plans in the world they look like a stack of paper with either red or blue page in the mix, those open up additional crafting things. When you get to the jail below the grafton area theres a daily quest there called Patrol Duty which rewards a weapon plan .. or you can buy them now a days.
---
The plans will level up so anything you can craft now in 5 levels you can craft a new one .. for mods and such for the guns craft em or take em off dead enemies and scrap em to unlock more
---
Is this still going on? I’m sure I’ve missed it by now right?
---
Yep, the good stuff is coming in May. Good call focusing on the AP exams though, that stuff is really important. I'm able to ride through a double major and double minor in only four years at my college because of all the AP credits I got in high school.
---
I think it’s mostly done. Might be worth a look though.
---
Ok I’ll add you in a bit to see if I can find anything
---
Same :(
---
Which poem/story is that? The only Poe I can remember off the top of my head is the red masque, which was great. I think there was something about a hall in a wine cellar but it's been too long
---
Oh.... I thought it was accessible by breaking into the skybox from what I heard. Especially with a strict skybox that literally *forces* you down back to the ground that increased my thought of it being above the skybox.
---
The Cask Of Amontillado. One of my favorites.
---
a bloodied .50 cal with all perks and mutations hits for around 350 damage. a full unyielding set puts your melee damage well into the thousands. anti-armor + stabilized/tank killer negates most DR. just assassin's is a 40% reduction, plus dodgy and lone wanderer and you're looking at 70% reduction. hell, even chameleon.
---
pvp will never be remotely balanced so long legendaries exist. at least be honest and admit you don't care about balance, you just want assassin's/sentinel/cavalier gone.
---
Nope, its an interior cell that can only be enter by a door that doesn't exist.
---
That might have been done specifically due to people accessing the dev room. Info was very scarce and somewhat conflicting, but from what I gathered the dev room required some level of third party assistance to get into, although map-wise it was way up above the game world somewhere in the savage divide (I think slightly NE of whitesprings)
---
Ah. Well that crushed my dreams being able to ever get in there lol. M
---
&gt; The cars are meh. 
---
What? Those cars are fucking on point.

---
Sounds very faintly familiar, I'll look into it. ty!
---
Hey if you just sent me a friend request I might have deleted it on accident
---
How much for the marine wetsuit plan?
---
You can only do it on a pc.
---
500, hows that?
---
I THOUGHT I did, but then I recently found three locations to the West of Morgantown that I had completely skipped over. Now I'm wondering how much else of the game world I left behind. I tried looking at maps but they are far too big to get an accurate sense of what I am or am not missing
---
I originally started off with rifles but moved into shotguns but always had melee because too many enemies run up on you. Enforcer on shotguns is op but rifles have tormentor, that combined with tank killer should do nicely (something I'm going to do with my own now that I said it) I personally think you have too many points in perception and maybe even strength but I'm not a fan of leveling up rifleman/slugger, expert and master cards.
---
The top floor office in Charleston herald has a small desk in the back that spawns weapon plans. It’s the chief editors office I think- has 2 doors into it. If you find a plan you want and grab it, you’ll have to wait 20 hours for it to be able to respawn again. If you don’t like the plan that spawned (or one isn’t there), switch servers and check again. I just got the laser gun plan this way. I was looking for the pump action shotgun plan, but I’ll take this for now!
---
Up the hill from the Welch trainstation go I think west across the tracks and up on the hill you'll find I think it was a coffee shop .. it has a cat that continually spawns there and if it dies respawns very quickly.
---
Works for me.
---
Friendly reminder that the people fixing the buggy mess and the people making new cosmetics are not the same
---
Sixty 9
---
Thanks, just tried it and it worked. I appreciate the info!
---
No problem man :)
---
Hey, I have one of those and the deathclaw one facing each other on a  table
---
I like it
---
You expect the average Redditor to **read entire articles** included in the game's launcher before posting about things? Can I assume you only recently found the internet?
---
bloody build here too.  I wont be first or second pole position, but I will take 3rd if nobody else will.  I buy psychobuff in bulk, and have a huge stash of super stims.  I dont have much problem with health as a conduit.  Its pretty manageable.
---
I missed the first egg.....
---
Let's hope you've already made mention, as much as you'd like, but at least some friendly reminder for others to help out.
---
My first trip to this event had me getting yelled at by some ass to hit the button on the front of the conduit, whereas I was looking for what to do with the conduit but on the wrong side of it. He was aggressive, a jerk, and frankly made me just want to leave that particular instance. But, as I was three times his level, I've been playing for awhile and I'm generally interested in what to do. So I quickly learned, though I made sure to get my mic out and let him know I was "displeased" with his tone.
---
Seeing as that was the one and only time I have attempted this event, I may have just learned another thing for you. I believe I was also shooting at the guy while it was invisible. I'm wondering if that's why I was "randomly" dying. Either way, I'll learn, get better, and help others at that point, if I can. I won't put up with everything, but patience and kind jolt to get people in line will go a lot further than coming at others rudely.
---
That’s hilarious!!!
---
Definitely needs to be addressed, it's ridiculous that with so many possible legendary combinations, 3* enemies don't even guarantee a 2* or 3* drop, and on top of that big boss enemies like the queen or the sheepsquatch impostor can drop 1* or even 0* crap like drills/syringers. I got excited for a queen fight today, spent ~3000 5.56 on it and ended up getting...a vampire's pole hook. At least she dropped a prime 10mm automatic receiver and a t45 jet pack, so that's something
---
That's a lot of hours wow!!! I just got into the habit of fast traveling everywhere and I haven't really done much exploring in a long time. And there's a lot of places on this map that I haven't been.
---
YES! I suggested this before as we already have pool tables, dart boards, golf courses, basketballs hoops even tennis courts FFS!! Would be fun to be able to place bets too
---
That's why I printed it out. You can see it better that way. I found a high-res map on IGN's website.
---
30 seconds is plenty of time to take that thing out.
---
It certainly would be an incentive to keep pushing forward.
---
I wonder what the prestige system will be like
---
You have a good attitude about it
---
How the hell does your camp budget let you build a magnificent tower like that?
---
The fact this wasn’t hotfixed is pathetic on Bethesda’s part. Breaking a main feature and forcing users to live without mods for 2 weeks is absurd.
---
So annoying! Can't attach my extra flame for the shiskabob, can't attach jet pack for X-01, can't attach tri-barrel for minigun! Bethesda! WTH! Fix the dang thing! Arghhhhh!
---
I am offline cause I gotta sleep, however we can finish the trade tomorrow, how does that sound?
---
You can add me in advance, IGN: Wing196
---
I mostly just see people ranting about things they don't want people to say in this sub.
---
Couldn't you just have three lockpick cards still though, LV. 1, LV. 2, and LV. 3, like most other perks. Sure it would take six levels, instead of only three, to get all three versions, but in the long run, it'd be worth it.
---
How is the fact that there happens to be a off the wall build and trick to solo a boss that is supposed to take a team. What exactly is the problem with that? Are you taking issue that a boss that is supposed to take a group to down can be solo'd or are you taking issue that you have to use a specific build to be able to solo a boss that wasn't designed to be solod?
---
Same with T-60. I've been looking all over for a T-60 Left Arm to try this on, just to see what happens.
---
Glad someone did, and posted about it. Odd that it keeps the stats heh
---
Holy crap you still haven't ran out of tears yet?
---
&gt; Of course you stand up to the bully but you don't keep going once he quits, you've clearly won. The extra aggression is unnecessary and counterproductive.
---
Except he hasn't quit, he is still actively silencing people that at all criticize him.
---
Same with PC. Xbox seems to be the only console that lets you stalk other people.
---
You were looking at the wrong letters, you chose the words that started with W, maybe the W was never correct in the first place and the likeliness came from the rest
---
The Fallout 76 dev team is like 4 people. Ofc its the same guy.
---
Missile launchers can be fun.  I've got an Anti Armor with a targeting computer and use it to shoot down scorchedbeasts and cargobots.  Probably not the most effective, but fun nonetheless.  I'm hoping they buff missiles eventually.
---
Well i found nothing, but still fun either way. Can i get a participation trophy? Lol
---
Just doing some after-game puttering on reddit. Tomorrow will be just fine.
---
It takes around 11 to 12 hours for each location to reset
---
I honestly look forward to resetting my level, as long as we don't unlearn all the plans we've learned.  It won't take long to reach level 50 after all the tricks we've learned over time.
---
I threw a few more out just a couple a minutes ago. But if you need serums I can give you one
---
I’m so mad I missed one!
---
Ran into same problem the other day when I was walking down the road from the pumpkin place and a scorch beast literally just fell outta the sky dead next to me.  And another when a glowing yao gui was up ahead of me and just fell over dead. 
---
I'm thinking glitch in the matrix...I mean game...
---
He's the reason Uncle has lumbago
---
The game series doesn't make sense at times but at least every is enjoying it for the most part. I'm impressed with your knowledge on the series.
---
I can’t find where in CAMP the eggs are.. I’d like the place the black one out for decoration.
---
All explosive launchers are considered explosive heavy weapons. So you can carry several for almost no weight with Bear Arms, and Stabilized gives them 45% armor penetration if you are in power armor. I went with a combined Heavy weapon/ explosives P.A. build, because I think they synergize very well.
---
...so you just blew up a lvl 28’s Camp... what a hero...
---
I use bloodied sniper with bloodied melee and it’s a great balance together. BE lever for solo gameplay and BE auto handmade for the queen. It’s super fun
---
Yes yes yes! I swear it would make a huge difference , the gold and stuff could be quite rudimentary...like gta, but could have weekly challenges , finish under par, get a 180 at darts etc.
---
Oh man I would love this.
---
Reminds me of my astonishment last night while I had the creature taming perk equipped and........... I could Pacify not just Ghouls, but also Super Mutants o\_0
---
Unfortunately, they were all part of groups, so I have no clue if I could tame them lol *(For that matter, I've never even found anything I could tame yet T\_T Not even the cat in the Ash Heap. Frustrating, when you're level 116 and can't get a random encounter to save your life... lol)*
---
I think this is related to a server desync .. if you ever load in quick to an area and run around before it's fully loaded items you can pick up in the area will all be there, active and interactable until the server catches up then the items get disabled and hidden .. so I think what's happening is your client is loading the area up with all the last known creature list as active alive and goes ahead mimicking their behavior until the server updates your client which says these no longer exist which then triggers your client to remove them but right now the only way is to call its on death function or something similar.
---
Congrats!
---
I think it’s a thing to blow up anyone’s base for any reason in some peoples eyes lol. I was watching the map one time and noticed someone spawned where I would usually if someone was in my camp spot, he proceeded to come and fuck up my base I’m assuming because I was in his spot. Fucker.
---
I’d pay every Cap I have (I’m pushing 50k at this point) for a BE 50cal or a B25 Gatling gun. I can make 3k caps a day from vendors, easy, and there’s literally nothing else I actually want to spend caps on.
---
Dying fixes it.

Or even a mini game tattooing where your could tattoo friends whilst doing jobs for biv.

As someone who just started I was level 9 when I went to do that quest just keep running they can't kill what they can't hit the real issue is the level 40 scorched in the mine but if you have the stimpaks you'll make it through
---
If you're still selling the chest piece I might be interested. What's the damage resistance with the polymer mod?
---
I would like a DLC to eventually create a way to be able to plant rarer plants within greenhouses or something.
---
Like we meet a gardener assaultron, with gloves, a flower apron and straw hat, in Lewisburg where they have the flower festival. The town's destroyed but she's still happily working away gardening the rooftops of the city in preparation for a future flower festival (which sets up for future events much like fasnacht). She sends you out on side missions like the BIV quest to retrieve soil from the areas or "special" fertilizer by killing a specific creature from a location and in return you learn the plans to plant them (using the plants itself just like other camp vegetables/fruits)
---
I would even like it just for the fact it will actually give me a reason to to travel to the ash heap every once and while, I feel like that area had a tiny part in the game and it's the only biome I haven't explored all of after like 300 hours ingame
---
If you find the combat armor dense torso plan I got 10k with your name on it.
---
Happened to me several times. Every time the game loaded (fast travel, or interiors) u would have another one appear.
---
This sounds technical so it's probably true
---
OLD MAN MOSE IS DEAD
---
hmm odd next time you're in the menu hit Q and it'll only show you the stuff you can place .. also don't hoard the less important junk items, which ones those are for you will eventually be made clear as your build takes shape, usually lead/steal/ballistic fiber etc, always keep the a good amount of the good stuff the rest just bulk and sell and only keep like 50-100 .. weapons armor etc should all be scrapped or sold .. storage is valuable here and unlike what we were all used to in fallout4/skyrim it's not good to hoard here
---
I’m running a full troubleshooter set, with the bos mods, and a vampire explosive 50 cal. I usually use all but one stimpack and moe through the assaultron
---
omg if we could place tattoos on other people … I'd be jailed within the week and probably sued but it would be the best week ever and I'd die happy
---
What appeals to you about Fallout? Exploration, environmental story telling, lore? 76 has that. 
---
However 76 conflicts with previous lore. The story is meh and decisions, actually there are no decisions, you can either do the story or not, so there are no consequences. And of course there are only robots as npcs (and Grahm and Cholly) Edit: and soon to be the legendary vendor. 
---
So depending on what attracts you to fallout will determine if you'll like it or not.
---
Wouldnt it be nice, atom bomb baby and sixteen tons are pretty good
---
We could practice on pig foot Pete!
---
I know I'm pate but I found a dead deathclaw named Traveling Merchant
---
I'm pretty sure I learned that from scrapping.  I could be wrong but I thought all but the BOS could unlock through the workbench.  Either way, I'll note it as one to grab if I see the plan.  The BOS plan has a value of 50, so hard to tell which plans are actually worth something/rare.
---
That's it, plus the other Sluggers if you have room. I also use Blocker.
---
Oooo fuck it 😂
---
Wtf is that thing
---
Ive been playing since November and this has been happening forever. Dont know cause. Have heard enemies groan than find them dead ive even had 3 enemies in a row drop dead the second my sights were on them.
---
Whats with the downvotes?
---
And that is your loss....Having studied astrology for many years, it might appear to be random to the uninitiated but i can assure you it is high science well beyond comprehension for those who simply give it a cursory glance. But your right we believe what we want to believe until proven wrong.
---
You mean: Buck, buck, buck, buck, BUCK-ET
---
New char.
---
I prefer fuc fuc fuc FUCK IIIIIT! 😂
---
Ha, that’s another good strategy I guess :)
---
This happens way too often. A few times it was the exact prefix of an item I’ve been searching for but as soon as I get up to the body and read the item before picking it up the body just disappears.
---
bump I know it has to be one of the mods.
---
I love the fact you keep glossing over the duplicated item thing like that’s not what I’m talking about. I have **zero** issue with legitimately obtained assassin’s/sentinel/cavalier gear. None. What I have an issue with, *as I’ve iterated numerous times* is duped .00001% gear that proliferated at launch and for the first few months thereafter in a mode that focuses largely on a PvP element.  
---
Now, why don’t you be honest and admit that you have probably a full set plus all the really common duped guns as well?
---
I'm good, thanks though! I may have another look in a bit.
---
quick note, on weapons like the .50 Cal MG the Fire Rate is attacks per second multiplied by 10, you'll need to divide the fire rate by 10 to get the proper DPS.
---
I had an leather left arm gave it to my gf and then it disapeared from both our inventories. I just took the paint off of it to give it to her and it disapeared completly from both our inventories never dropped it. I only use one set and I don't mixed them up.  not the case of that Buddy had a favorite tesla in his inventory. Then he literally switch servers and it disapeared from his inventory right when he loaded the next server. Same thing has happened with other experience players it's not a conspiracy but a real bug that absolutly sucks to have happen to you. There's regurly few post he about this topic once in a while.
---
I saw a two shot the dragon once and lost it to the glitch!
---
Did you help him?
---
&gt;I love the fact you keep glossing over the duplicated item thing like that’s not what I’m talking about.
---
because it's irrelevant. duplicated or not, they're unbalanced.
---
&gt;I have zero issue with legitimately obtained assassin’s/sentinel/cavalier gear.
---
so you're just salty? you don't mind someone being game-breaking op so long they got there fairly? because that's the epitome of pettiness.
---
&gt;Now, why don’t you be honest and admit that you have probably a full set plus all the really common duped guns as well?
---
I have 3. don't see how that's relevant though, seeing as I'm arguing *against* them.
---
I've been there and still don't find military bags anywhere ur sayibg u find 40 ballistic like how lol
---
Yeah, 2 for Starched Genes, 3 for Class Freak, 1 for Strange in Numbers to really maximize the positive effects when in a team.  Then depending on which Mutations you get, you can perk to offset in many cases.  But then you are really losing the benefit of the perk.
---
what do you want for it ??
---
It's a one time thing, so if you want to do it all over again you'd have to create a new character. If it was a daily quest then you could do it every 24 hours, but it's a side quest, so you can only do it once per character
---
Well to be completely honest, I’m only successful like half the time I go there. I also heard that cranberry bog is good for ballistic, I’ll go there and look for some too
---
My psn is BigDaddyLucifer and that would be so helpful thank you
---
no
---
I haven't done that event yet. Does your armor DR/ER have any effect on how quickly your health drains? Also, if these things are classified as robots, can you use Troubleshooters armor (x 5 pieces) to cut the damage done to you by 75%?
---
I might have an extra one laying around psn is the same as here I will check tomorrow
---
I like instigating for lever action.
---
Mole rats the real enemy that wiped out all the humans of West Virginia.
---
I have to see it to believe it
---
This game would need a brand new engine for that
---
I'm looking for something that'll be more useful against end game bosses but still useful against anything. Probably should have pointed that out in the actual post
---
Not to be nitpicky but you can get a prime receiver for the crossbow haha.
---
Looks like we won't know till after we either claim/place all 6, or till after the alotted time for the last egg runs out
---
two-shot and anti-armor are primary modifiers, can't have both. as for which is better, depends on the situation. but I'll say that ts has a hidden accuracy **penalty** that makes them terrible for vats.
---
explosive is generally the best secondary mod but there are alternatives depending on your build. it's also not very good with semi-auto rifles, especially bolt ones. not that you should pass on one just because it's explosive, it's definitely better than nothing.
---
pretty sure vanguard is better but I forget the numbers. not that all the DResist in the world would make a difference at 20% health.
---
Thought this was the 5th egg.
---
I wanna say floor decorations tab
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
I think the chainsaw staggers 100% of the time? either way someone posted a video yesterday literally mowing down everything in the golf club with a bloodied chainsaw.
---
go to your armor bench, and you can craft a rabbit head helmet
---
I could have sworn I saw a TSAA weapon, wonder what I'm thinking of then
---
I really like explosive just because of instances when there's swarms of enemies like with ghouls, one shot ends up hitting most of them if I'm lucky
---
Hey they don't teleport, they merely burrow real fast to the point they are faster then light underground but slow as molasses while running on the surface. Its like a typical consumer that barely walk 20 feet in a mall but when black friday hits everyone turns into athletes sprinting vast distances only a professional Olympic athlete can dream to one day be as good.
---
floor decorations tab, same spot as the Deathclaw Statue (scroll like you're looking through variants)
---
My base is pretty much constantly under Siege and I just sell a bunch of junk ARs and shotguns with hard bargain 1 and I still make like almost 1000 caps a day when I play
---
send me a vid of what you want to get rid of @ koolnoob99
---
Yeah got him squared away.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Literally the same happened to me yesterday. When I logged in today, all the duplicates were gone.  I think you're safe.
---
Dense isn't a scrap mod for any armor type. Other valuable non-scrap mods for combat armor include Deep Pocketed (torso, limbs), Ultralight (limbs) and Shadowed (torso, arms, legs). Apparently some people like Strengthened too.
---
Having left and right excavator arms on your power armor gives additional ore. Don't need the whole thing, but why would one leave that extra 100 carry weight (200 with calibrated shocks) behind?
---
I'm just happy to be playing. Waited a long time for a multiplayer Fallout and I'm still in the honeymoon phase I suppose. Plus I have the recipe for stimpacks and blood packs, so I usually have extra.
---
it was most definitely something else. explosives work best with shotguns and full autos, since you can just blow everything to hell.
---
instigating is great for bolt rifles. or just bloodied really. but keep in mind you'll have a hard time killing big game like the queen or imposter with a rifle. what I'd recommend is optimizing your build to squeeze every last drop of damage, do drugs and carry half a dozen bloodied Dragons.
---
then again, you'll probably be able to sneakly oneshot everything else.
---
all? today was the last one, onyx. you're missing 2.
---
All of them, sadly I missed the first one.
---
Sickle.  It's pretty badass and has no mods.  Could be a fun weapon for 1h melee or just for a random gun user to have as their emergency option.
---
Well that sucks for me. Are there any mods I can buy to make it more powerful or faster spinning (if so where)?
---
A good way is some of the nuke silos have gyms with tons of weights and its in the first area so just run inside look for the weights and grab them and get out. Second option is theres a camp spot with two extractors you can get access to, one being lead and the other being acid and you can easily get a steady supply of them. Location of this spot is right in the cliffside literally inbetween South Mountain Lookout and Lake Eloise. Also linked to the map that you can use to see all the extractor locations on world map so you can know where to find it easier.
---
 [https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png)
---
But with the specific words like Water and Wasted, only the first two match. I've ran into this problem before.
---
I have to say that revolvers are actually very good with the right build
---
Not true. I have my paypal linked and I can buy whatever I want and it just charges me. I used to have to add money before buying but that was years ago.
---
Good spot would be the location on cliffside where your camp can reach both acid and lead deposits, south of South Mountain Lookout. Only thing is to expect to make your camp multilvl because its on a cliffside.
---
Appreciate it!
---
If there's an extremely high level like 120 nearby, it does its best to average it out.
---
Weight, scarcity and fire rate. I've got an amazing grenade launcher but the weapon itself is so bad compared to any explosive shotgun. 
---
Auto grenade launcher is amazing though.
---
I played the pre-bethesda games when they were new. Nothing special about it, just been a fallout fan since...well, launch.
---
Absolutely.....having a legendary two shot scoped cross bow that would shoot electric or explosive bots would be awesome. Remind me of my hunting days minus the two shot and elect or explosive arrows of course
---
Lol there was 4 of them and a lvl 48. I was using a lvl 45 gun. I took his camp because they stole... I never said I was a hero. I'm trying to make a point to think twice before taking someone's bag. That's it.
---
No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and do not accuse players of cheating. Use Bethesda's official support page to report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/). Do not name in shame in general.
---
Everquest just had a 20 anniversary relaunch of classic era progression servers, as well as one that starts at Luclin, a couple months ago.  Good times :)
---
Bethesda officially loves the modding community because without the modding community, a lot fewer people would buy their games. Unofficially, every mod is non-monetized profit, and that makes their twisted, evil black littler hearts bleed.
---
Thanks, I have no idea how I got most of the mods/plans I know.  I saw a Deep Pocketed Marine plan there while farming for the BOS, so it sounds like a good spot for armor mod plans.
---
Certain mods you can do at a weapons bench put "anti armor" in the name, but it is not the same as the legendary effect. It will stack with the legendary AA I believe.
---
It's annoying when people put all that crap in their titles for exactly this reason. It can mislead people that don't know yet or forgot.
---
Ahh damn thanks, which two am I missing?
---
Lol I'm in a party with 7 ppl I play with since launch bro. I'm posting this to make a point. Dont touch what's not yours. Doesn't matter what I was doing. It's my fault for carrying it and his fault  Are you mad? My psn is their if you feel some type of way. Have a nice day
---
Had that happened the other night.  Everytime I reloaded my weapon or left VATS, another copy of the code would appear on my screen.  Very annoying when that happens during combat.  Fixed when I left and rejoined server.
---
I clear harpers ferry and sell all guns to the vendor there. Super easy
---
It happen to me the first time I died. The second time, I was heading toward my bag, saw a player pick it up and ended up shooting him got mine and his. Then server hopped.....lol
---
how about you just eat me?
---
Sent you a friend request. Let me no tomorrow. Thanks again
---
As I remember it, this was a deliberate choice. They CHOSE to make 3 star legendary enemies drop shittier loot shortly after launch. Because fuck everyone who didn't buy the game early, I guess?
---
Everything thats not a melee weapon.
---
I'm trying to improve my build right now, since I see people performing much better than I am in the SBQ and Imposter events. 
---
My primary weapon is a TSE Lever Action Rifle and it serves me well for most stuff, just not the SBQ and Imposter
---
that's probably it then
---
Interesting. I just did the mine and the highest level I saw was 24. I'm level 30.
---
Really? This is your response? Did you read what you wrote? You sound really desperate to justify your ill gotten and game breaking gear man lol.  
---
Legendary gear is part of the game, duping is not. Literally nobody should have *three* sets of .00001% chance gear. That’s hilarious. No wonder you’re against a clean slate. You’d get wrecked without your cheese. This whole “debate” is just absurd knowing this. Thanks for the chuckles man.
---
Look don't get me wrong. I love the Fallout, Skyrim, Dishonored, Prey, Doom all those universes they brought to us in game. Heck, just this week I dropped 140$ on hoodies from their online store. I have their fallout posters on my wall but I'm just not into this gaming trend of rewarding game companies who go back on their word. Although I'm really looking forward to Rage 2.
---
yeah, that checks out. it's just like I said, bolt rifles are capable of oneshotting most regular enemies, but they're terrible against "bosses"
---
just focus on sneak and try to maximize your damage output.
---
Unfortunately no sorry
---
Its not worth it. Even with the cheaper materials to craft, the Witch mutation is garbage. You cant even go anywhere with water without your character melting.
---
Bla bla blah, still a loser. No one cares. See ya in the wasteland mr popular
---
&gt;You sound really desperate to justify your ill gotten and game breaking gear man lol.
---
you're the one obsessing over dupes. I'm simply stating the obvious, that legendaries are unbalanced by definition. part of the game or otherwise, they don't fit too well in a pvp environment.
---
&gt;No wonder you’re against a clean slate. You’d get wrecked without your cheese.
---
did you read my posts? like, at all? this whole time I'm making a case for a legendary-free survival mode. what you're saying makes no sense.
---
I've been running power armor for so long I may try to get more Bolstering/Vanguard armor since I have one of each on separate legs, that'll make it more comfortable to not live in my PA.
---
I need to find a better melee weapon too since the only good melee weapon I have is an Assassin/Swing Speed/+1 Strength Sledgehammer that's level 40. But I'm sure I'll get something sooner or later
---
While this is most likely true (I don't know that people in the art department in this studio aren't also capable of working the QA side of the house, and I suspect you don't either). 
---
It would be interesting to know how they're budgeting this, how many people are working on quality control/bug fixes/future in game content, compared to how many people are working on future atom shop content. 
---
Because that IS something the company, as a whole, could, and should, be judged for.
---
Why did I get wood armor and a syringer from the Sheepsquatch? What’s the point of fighting it if some random mob drops the exact same loot.
---
I restarted from level 1 yesterday, saved every cap I got, walking everywhere to avoid fast travel,  so that when I got to level 15 I could buy the plans to make from scratch. After a scary  run into the Whitesprings I finally had enough caps at level 16. Now let the fun begin!
---
No we got connected. Thanks for the hunt it was fun, I found a couple pieces tonight and I leveled up in the process. This was a blast!
---
Sounds like a lot of work for some xp. Why don’t you just play the game as it’s supposed?
---
The new responder vendor, in the book store, sells the boards...under misc...the recall board plus other stuff will allow you to make at your tinker stand
---
&gt;Let's see how this gets resolved.
---
protip: it won't.
---
another protip: you'll get swarmed by downvotes and people demanding proof, because "this is just another hoax like the trade bug"
---
only after we get blackbird back
---
please
---
Watch it be automaton style
---
The tower itself is actually already a structure in game, I've simply built around it. And, fun-fact, if you reach the top of said tower, there's a hole in the roof that lets you drop into the building. I actually have my bed and such inside of there.
---
If you're interested in checking it out, go to Sunnytop Train Station in the Savage Divide, near the very top of the of the mapped train rail line, and follow the tracks south. You'll see an abandoned train, and the tower will be just beyond it.
---
I never found those useful because you have to space god plants like corn and razor grain so far apart.
---
As much as they've said "We're working on it" or some variation thereof, it's already several months into the game and loot is still fucked beyond belief. At this point it doesn't look like it will ever get improved. If it does, it won't be until the next or beyond next major content drop.
---
I'm missing two or three as my atomic shop didn't refresh (happens on console sometimes). I learnt this after the fact though, so I can't get the 'special' reward. I've just seen said reward though so I'm not too bothered, at the time I was pretty pissed off though, haha
---
Flamer - Ammo too expensive to create and do rare in the world.
---
Interesting items like syringer, binoculars, flare are too heavy for their niche uses.
---
New content is great, but this is a lot of existing launch content that's not really used because of issues.
---
I did too! A big bummer for sure, should’ve checked on reddit sooner.
---
Can we get mods you actually can put on?
---
Thats in tomorrow’s update fix
---
There’s no such thing as a bloodied chainsaw. They don’t drop legendary. HE was probably a bloody build, chainsaw was Bow Bar &amp; Flamer modded, overrepaired to 200%
---
And even if the intention was to have newly picked or cooked stuff on the top you'd still have to scroll through stuff that doesn't spoil at all to get to it.
---
Not to mention that since its sorting by condition actual fully spoiled food isn't at a place where you'd want it to be.
---
I had both my Excavator legs vanish on me after completing Uranium Fever earlier. 10 freakin' flux to rebuild them and add the mods back. =/
---
That’s awesome! So, stoked for the turn out and the enjoyment.
---
It'll get patched out eventually, probably. The bad news is there's really no hope to recover the items that went missing so you're jacked on compensation.
---
I mean, the fact that you can’t acknowledge that items that should be incredibly rare are *not* because of duping is too funny.  
---
I’ll let you have the last word, I’m just going to finish playing my game for the night. This has been a real fun total waste of my time though hahahaha.
---
I think i "resolved" it, after going back with another friend, we found the gun in the bushes, apparently I "dropped" the weapon? In the middle of a reload animation?
---
This is the only thing Banjo would make a “dear Bethesda “ about. NV had card games, shouldn’t be hard to to. None of that kids shouldn’t gamble crap if it’s just in game currency
---
They really are, sneak build with revolvers and abusing vats they're so good
---
Think I'll stop playing this game now, until I hear this gets patched. As a fellow legacy weapon owner you have my deepest condolences. Hope they can give you your gun back.
---
Oh okey thx
---
I've seen rare weapon plans spawn quite a bit at Camp Venture (in the room where you drop off technical data -- just below the reciprocal on the lowest shelf. A weapon mod can spawn next to where the plans do).
---
The SAA could use some tweaks to the reload speed, and more mods, but otherwise, revolvers are pretty good.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if there were new free fast travel points showed up when the map expands,  I don’t see that happening until next year at least.
---
I do that and pylons at level 10 or 15? I wont do pylons anymore cuz i found out my hp is too low lol! But i will play emt!
---
Most of us that are playing are constantly in the honeymoon phase. 😊
---
Add a ghoul mutation?
---
cosmetically changes you to a ghoul
---
+1000 rad resist
---
-2 to all stats 
---
Hell maybe even add a super mutant mutation.
---
+4 strength +4 endurance
---
-4 charisma -4 intelligence
---
If it had all the mods that 44 and western has (dont understand why it doesnt) it would be just as viable
---
Yeah excactly
---
Yes I can. When are you online. I'm UK based so will need to be at a time when I'm likely to be online
---
Fishing!!! Cook up some Radfish with Nukasauce..mmmm good eating👌☢️
---
Serums
---
Only 6550hrs to complete the challange and get 20 atoms
---
good tips, thanks
---
lol that challenge isnt there really for the atoms it's there because theres no other way to see your time played
---
it makes the gun weaker.
---
Yea they really do need to balance it better.  I doubt it will ever happen though.
---
GT?
---
Started using it kinda recently, doubt I'll take it off. Stealth sniper and I dont get hit very often so my armor is lasting forever. It's nice not having to worry about seeing that damn red shield icon on the bottom right
---
Maybe the devs will let us build a flux capacitor too
---
Put it at whitespring
---
Will you sell it?  I have a few decent things to trade if not.  2 star AA combat shotgun with faster fire rate, 2 star swing speed DC gauntlet, Grounded serums that I can craft and sell for 450 each when the vendors reset.
---
Lol it would of been nice if it was 760hr or  7600hrs gets you 760 atoms
---
You can already get it, I think. Go to your armor bench and you’ll be able to make a rabbit mascot head.
---
I was hoping for something a bit cooler, but whatever.
---
You've seen the reward? What is it?
---
W, A, and E are in the first few words you picked aren’t they? So it’s possible A and E were the two that matched.
---
Yeah happened to me as well.  Just...poof.  Gone. Very frustrating
---
Here’s how it works.
---
Fist weapon has 100 dmg, iron fist adds 10 dmg. With talons, iron fist now provides 12.5 dmg instead of 10, and talons increases the dmg by 25 also, equating to 137.5 dmg.
---
Two handed weapon has 100 dmg, slugger adds 10 dmg, expert slugger adds 10 dmg, master slugger 2 adds 15 dmg, equating to 135 dmg for 4 point investment versus 1 with fist weapons, just to get less dmg.
---
Do you ever play with other people? I'm only just about lvl 70. But I have a wide network of people that I can run with. It's not always or usually very focused, but it's always very fun. Sometimes we just wander around chatting and killing things we run into. Sometimes we help another team member complete a quest. Sometimes my friends are on a different team, but let us know they are launching a nuke or whatever. Every day I am usually teamed up. And I love when my friends who I irregularly team up with come around. I've met so many people to play with that I wish that we all could play on the same team. But still. I see no reason to torture yourself if it's not fun. Life is really too short for that.
---
Wow other people that use explosives? I haven’t seen *one* person besides myself throw a grenade in my 800 hours. 
---
Aside from what people already listed, you have to find the Nuke Grenade plan somewhere. They are so cheap to make- 1 frag grenade, 1 nuka cola, 1 aluminum. Procs with Super Duper when you make them all the time. And they are tons of fun to use. 
---
But even with Fire in the Hole and Grenader, it’s hard to hit enemies, right? Not when you Vats the grenade and shoot it as it flys past them!
---
I’ve blown scorched beasts and Nuclear Key card drones out of the sky with Nuke Grenades and Vats and it’s a very good feeling. High level legendary Mirelurk queens even go down fairly quick. 
---
As a mostly straight melee guy, throwing and shooting grenades with my back up pistol has saved me more than a few long runs ups a twisted catwalk to get that last super mutant.
---
Got one a lvl 50 hunting rifle to drop tonight and was disappointed to find out that it was weaker than .308
---
Bethesda could use a weapon's advisor
---
On my way
---
I don't particularly want it to have all the mods the other revolvers do, personally. I'd prefer it be a bit more powerful, to offset the slow reload speed, and maybe the glow sights, but none of the scopes and reflex sights.
---
All the reciever would be a definite plus, though
---
Yes please....mmmmmm, mmmmmm ,mmmmmmm baby, bbq mini games also, grilling those rad roaches, watch you don’t burn em suckas!
---
I, too, enjoy a fair bit of the content they produce. I do not enjoy the manipulative, exploitative methods they're starting to use to get more and more cash out of the people who already shelled out cash to play their content, though. 
---
And it's worth noting...some of that content you mention? Doom and fallout, especially? They were established entities long before Bethesda (or zenimax, which...same thing, really) acquired the rights to that game series (fallout) or acquired that company (id). 
---
So much of what we LOVE about bethesda were things people loved BEFORE bethesda got their mits on them. 
---
Do I love elder scrolls? Sure! Is prey pretty good? Yeah. Dishonored isn't my cup of tea but people love it. 
---
But I've been a fallout fan since before I even heard the name "Bethesda". Doom was the game that made me decide I wanted a PC. That puts me in kinda a weird spot, because I'm way more loyal to titles than to a company. And around here you get a shitload of flack for not liking the direction Bethesda is, at times, taking the franchise.
---
Are you actually? That’s incredible
---
Not at the moment I would like a nice mini gun or a big gun
---
What’s coming in May?
---
You can spec eating people and getting advantages from radiation. The only thing stopping you from being a ghoul is you. Just be a ghoul.
---
Haha it’s a strange gun. But here’s another stupid question, what the difference between charging your shot and not? I haven’t noticed a damage difference but I could be wrong
---
Gambling, yeah rad!,that would be cool.
---
The relation of the receiver and Two Shot is awkward, as far as we could determine. It doesn't seem to consider the receiver buff/debuff for the second bullet. Scorch Killer's receiver starts with a 20% debuff, thus it is weaker.
---
It's an Easter-themed hat
---
Wow... That's very anit climatic
---
They should really add poker since red dead redemption 2 online still Dosen't have it.
---
And that still doesn't explain why in mybother example where I click on Moonwalk with 4 Likeness letters, but the password ends up being something with none of those letters in it like Speeches.
---
I thought so too , but last night i got a total of 3 treestar legendary gutsys. Did not find the Sheepsquatch body at the end but walked away with 3 threestar weapons and one two. All max lvl.  Furios exploding ap cost handmade was one of them :-)
---
well then they should fix that too
---
It's definitely awesome!
---
Similar thing happened to me on PC.  Said the guys level was 0 and he one shot me out of nowhere   When I respawned close by same thing happened.
---
That sounds like P2W to me! BURN THE HERETIC!
---
So you're just pulling numbers out of your ass now? 😂
---
Iron Fist and Sluggers are all +20% when maxed out.
---
This means Iron Fist will do 120% of base damage, then times 1.25 for Talons is 150% of base damage.
---
1 maxed out Slugger will do 120% of base damage. Then another one is times 1.2 which is 144%. Then the last one is times 1.2 which is 172.8%.
---
172.8&gt;150, and then adding on the fact that Super Sledge already does more damage to begin with.
---
EVEN IF your claim, which 100% untrue for *any* effect in the game, were used, then that would be +20% times 3, or +60%, which would give 160%, which is still better than 150%.
---
You literally just pulled the numbers for those 2 perks out of your ass. 😂
---
Have you played since the last update? At workbenches they changed the way the repair button works because of the rename feature. Now you have an option to repair or rename when you hit whatever button you use on Xbox.
---
Ye, but Todd would cry
---
I think I have some on XBOX, I can check when I get home later.
---
*smurems
---
Obviously you care. Your commenting on this post.
---
I mean, they removed flare guns from the legendary drop pool. That's....a start
---
vendors or players
---
Ah. I think I remember finding one of those. It has a hunting rifle and a sleeping bag on the lower floor, right?
---
You guys are getting legendaries?
---
Let me know, I'd really like to play around with a decent Tesla.  I have caps to spare; can use serums as cash to sell at a later time.
---
Spend caps? I don’t even go to that event, why bother when a whitespring ghoul seems to drop the same crap. I have way better luck with legendaries one creatures in way easier, single player events.
---
That's reserved to us Mole Men thank you very much. &gt;_&lt;
---
The datafile indicates it is a pre-modded legendary chinese sword and uses the same legendary Assassin's flag as any other.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Is Combat Rifle speed correct as it's showing same speed no matter of the receiver?
---
I get 3.3 on all of them.
---
My Powerful automatic receiver shot 10 shots in about 1.7 seconds (not super accurate as I used my phone)
---
No, sometimes you get a syringer, like I did last time.
---
Any info about boost damage of grenade launchers? 
---
Did anyone post about it Bethesda?
---
I think if it only went caps to atoms it could work. Getting cosmetics gives no advantage.
---
I'm currently playing and have been for about six hours now. So I am hoping the update you speak of is live now?
---
I have TSE 50 cal
---
I feel they should also remove duplicate cards for Ammosmith, Weapon Artisan and Fix It Good, as I don't think anybody would want to equip anything other than the max rank card once they are fully levelled. Having to keep them all in your default card loadout, if you don't want to keep swapping them, means you are also missing out on cards you would otherwise be using in your normal playthrough.
---
By the time you reach level 100 there are just too many duplicate cards, which makes navigating between them a chore and distracts you from actually playing the game. How about a \*hide duplicates\* option in the perk cards menu? When you actually want to see them (and use them) you can, otherwise keep them hidden.
---
Iirc Bethesda Austin is a pretty small (and inexperienced) part of the dev team, and they most likely aren't rolling in funds. Regardless, my only real point was that it has nothing to do with the devs' willingness or unwillingness to focus on bugs vs cosmetics. If there is a massive imbalance of staff or funds going to the atom shop, that's on the upper management
---
Yes.
---
I suppose we did get the excavator bone skin. But I’d like a lot more raider everything. It’s the most "traditional" post apoc looking stuff.
---
Enclave bunker vendor, or other players. Cheaper from other players, normally.
---
That should have been for the raider armor, irritating that it wasnt
---
Nuke Whitesprings: ~40 each component, Nuke Wavy Willard: ~260 Violet Flux.
---
Wow. Another silly mask. How many silly masks does that make now? I know when I bought FO76 I was definitely thinking “I sure hope this game has silly masks! And princess and race car beds for my settlement!” I definitely wasn’t hoping for, you know, cool shit that makes sense in the post apocalypse.
---
Did you try everything stated in this video? I have and it worked for me. https://youtu.be/fJzgi3w5KVE
---
$1.60 worth of free atoms over a week period? I will survive. Especially since they never charged us for post launch dlcs, which most games do.
---
That sounds kinda beautiful. Mind taking some screenshots? 
---
And I'm sure it'll fix itself eventually.
---
I would love even a chrome one.
---
Added!
---
No thank you, I’ll take a TSE mini gun tho (:
---
And they're hard to hit, too.
---
Oki (: i keep it in mind
---
I agree it's not a big deal, but keep in mind the "payment" for future DLC is having up to $15 skins in a $60 game
---
Yeah i would mainly want atleast a few different reciever options and maybe a different grips
---
Yeah, gotta agree with you there.. about $2.00 for free stuff.. Yeah nah. I'll be right. Annoyed I didn't managed to collect them atoms, but meh. Free is free, and I'm not all that upset that we didn't get them. Lol
---
Deserve compensation ? No of course not
---
The ingame speed shows shots per ten seconds and I don't have good data on the speed of receivers yet. 
---
If you want, you could check ingame how numbers change in the workbench (you don't have to actually mod, just walk over the receiver types and see how the fire rate changes).
---
And energy weapons need cards badly, too.
---
Maybe put a foundation and build stairs downwards then flat floors?
---
I feel like that's a cheap concession. And I'm not attempting to bag you or anything.
---
But saying something "is good with the right build" doesn't mean it's in a good spot.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet/powerfist/meat hook are good with any build provided you have high strength. That's how strong those weapons are. There are other weapons (like handmades, dragon) that also are quite strong even if you have nothing specced into them.  
---
I can make the Shishkebab or Revolver work if I run a bloodied build, but everything works with a bloodied build. That doesn't mean they are ok.
---
Day and night difference. Thank you SO much!
---
I would like an option to make a card animated. My OCD wants me to collect all of them at max rank with the animation, but the problem is once you have a non-animated card at max rank it will never be animated even if you get a lower rank animated version. Also, you can't get animated card drops for a card you already own all ranks of (so something like lockpick is rip unless you got extremely lucky). You can still get that kind of duplicate for a non-animated card, except it just vanishes
---
No problem! I just wish more people on pc knew about it. Would probably hear less people complain about the fps. Fair complaints if you don't know about this method though. Just found it last week after playing the game at only 20fps. Lol
---
Search underwater camp on YouTube. You'll learn how to build in water.
---
Yup! Detailed in the wild Appalachia article and shown on the trailer.
---
I saw online the the precise variant only takes 1 damage away and the ammo is way easier to come by , been struggling with ammo so it would be a nice change .
---
Right side of the map near Harper's ferry fallow the railroad track till it ends a a train station u cant get into yet
---
As of now no, but the way its sounding with the new foundation changes where you only need one foundation to be grounded and the others will be able to float. At least thats how I took what they said on it.
---
Damn, sorry!
---
I have numerous skins and camp decor. I never paid a dime. They make them easily affordable through atoms you earn in game
---
This...ridiculous no?
---
I’ve spent $40 on atoms months ago, didn’t regret it. Been able to purchase whatever I wanted and I keep my atoms up with challenges
---
Thankyou for saying something reasonable.
---
I never even implied that. only that legendaries are too op for pvp, which is a fact. you don't need a full assassin/sentinel set to have a considerable edge over everyone else.
---
meanwhile it's become obvious you don't care about pvp or balance, you're only pissy about dupes. a clean slate would do nothing because eventually we'd be at the exact same spot, except only a small minority would have access to pvp-breaking equipment.
---
or you could just wait for the Unstoppable Monster, farm a few random unyielding pieces, buy a ton of stealth boys and dominate the server because that's how easy it is to break the game with legendary mods.
---
Damn. That sucks :(
---
still have it ??
---
I have been able to place foundations in water at a few spots.   The only areas I have had problems is where the water was too deep and the foundations would not poke above the water.   I have not tried other objects other than foundations.   I know I have seen a few pool house type builds in the river along the western boundary river on youtube.
---
Agreed!
---
I keep hoping and praying that I don't get on one day, or be playing one day and suddenly some thing(s) disappear. This was a bug way back when the game released, and was in game for a couple of months or so. I didn't lose anything personally back then, but my husband lost his two shot fatman back then when his game crashed one day, and when he rejoined, it was gone. He had just been using it, too, when his game crashed. It happened back then, and sounds like it's happening again :(
---
It's not the foundation that's the problem. For some reason it let me place the foundation down with no problem. The problem is that I cannot place anything on top of the foundation which I find very odd.
---
Honestly? Not going to happen unless they start removing already-present features in order to make non-paying people second class players. I don't care if you can end up paying for a moderate convenience. I don't even care if you can pay for something like a pile of caps if you're too lazy to grind them out and have nothing of value to trade. I play the game for myself and want to have fun in it, nothing more. I would draw the line at something like an exclusive damage boost or a guaranteed 5* god-tier legendary only for people who pay up. I don't care about loot boxes, they've been in the industry for long enough that nobody would bat an eye anymore. Unless they included the aforementioned no-nos as possible loot. If it was just something like 500 for a random skin, with a possible rare power armor skin, yeah why not (as long as you can just buy the skin for 800 or 1000 or whatever)
---
In an RPG (that's what 76 still is... sort of) it should be the players who decide whether they want to heavily invest into lockpicking/hacking very early in order to open containers with sweet loot OR if they want to focus on combat-related skills instead, to be able to kill enemies more quickly. 
---
This is a tactical choice and this is what makes playing the game interesting and diverse!   
---
Am I feeling greedy and want to pick every lock for experience and potential useful items - or do I want to use my skill points to boost weapon damage (or decrease the rate at which my food is spoiling or make my junk items weigh less or... whatever)... these many considerations are especially interesting at the beginning and can totally change the way you play/experience the game. And that's a good thing. 
---
Thus - the choice should be ours!
---
The free atoms are fairly generous, but the real-money conversion rate for atoms is not. Especially with limited-time skins, many of which are among the best stuff they have released so far
---
Jeez and here I am thinking my breath just smelt that bad...
---
Just make a free fast travel to the interior of Whitesprings
---
Yeah I've experienced similar issues in the past. What's weird is not one piece is below water and I'm still getting the error message. I've become too deeply invested into my camp to restart so I'm looking for work arounds
---
That’s a good information u provide to me guy, much clearer how to play.
---
Few more questions:
---
I’m using grenades, instigating grenade launcher m79 and a shotgun. 
---
Idea is to throw grenade to weak enemies to kill them much at once 
---
Idea of m79 is to use Instigating power to deal maximum damage to bunch of high lvl mobs (it’s half hp of 68 super mutant)
---
And the idea of shot gun it’s to finish wounded enemies. For now I use two shot pump gun.
---
Wanna know ur thoughts about it and suggestions of secondary weapon and legendary effect (I chose Shotgun cuz I really like that gun)
---
This has been the case since release and it was terribly disappointing then and no less now knowing its not been fixed 5 months later.
---
it would be crappy to just give out the head and not the rest. it looks like it should be part of a set.
---
Thank you!! I never saw that you could arrow left there, might need to check my settings...
---
I thought the option was just broken.
---
Actual spoilt food should be the thing at the bottom
---
The really money conversion is pretty standard from what I noticed. And don’t forget, a lot of games don’t give out their premium currency even close to how much FO76 does. If you are worried about limited time skins, keep some atoms saved in case something comes up. That’s what I do. They typically add  the “good skins” with a pretty decent gap between them so it gives you some time.
---
You’re some kind of huge neck beard loser, or maybe like 13, aren’t you?
---
Yeah. I'm pretty pissed that I missed one.
---
Player vending, Legendary vendor and the scout's backpack dlc. So, some of the anticipated features.
---
What plaform are you b0b?    It might be a floating foundation like another user mentioned.   You start with one grounded and the others are not really touching bottom, they float, and that could be something to do with them getting rid of several foundation work arounds.   In all my previous builds the foundations were always touching bottom, the water was shallow.
---
Oh okay. Like i said i heard it from a friend so...
---
In fairness you are limited to one in your camp anyway.

They actually deleted the one tweet they had about repair kits on twitter pretty shortly after they made it. Maybe they backed down?
---
Who knows. Bethesda is rlly good at letting ita fans down.
---
PC doesn't seem to have any limit in game. I make lots of pics for mods I make and I usually forget to delete crapton of doubles I get in the process. And that's beside actual gameplay screens which I also got a ton of.
---
WHAT IS THAT PHOTO FRAME, BRÖTHER
---
The atomic shop refresh issue is a real problem. I wish I could give my costume rabbit heads away to others but it is personalized atom shopped that nobody else can use.
---
Send my thanks, I love that sticky no headed tar shooting critter 👍
---
I'd say it might be useful if you have an alt that you have a planned build for with a few branching path options. That might allow you to use those excess cards for them perhaps so you don't have to use a level for the switchable cards. They could also make nice random gifts for new low level players.
---
Although that's just a smaller less efficient way of dealing with duplicate cards compared to a vendor or the main proposed idea.
---
I can make them on a couple of chars but really don't remember how they got the plans.
---
Yup. And pretending that any criticism of where talents time is spent is anything _other_ than criticism of upper management, strikes me as, odd at best. 
---
We all know that the people working on projects don't "choose" their projects, not usually.
---
That would be cool!
---
Won't be active 'til May 23rd though. :(
---
I payed 5-7k for mine 3 weeks ago. Not sure why its going up. Its a good bread n butter weapon but AAE and BE are far better but those seem to be only tradednfor others. Honestly caps are kinda worthless.
---
I think that there should be a handful of cards you cant get from just leveling up but they have a rare chance of dropping from the perk packs
---
‘and my wife collects gas masks’ 👀
---
I'm pretty sure the palace harbors exclusively just supermutants. Considering how they are immune to the effect, would make sense if nothing comes up.
---
Torches are 500 atoms.
---
You'd have been better off reporting this to Bethesda and mentioning you have done so in this post, that way they see someone finding a glitch and helping them to get it fixed and they probably wouldn't ban you.
---
Instead you've found a glitch and just shared it with the community. Bad move.
---
You might want to submit a ticket to try and save  yourself some ban potential :)
---
No I ment, if you took a week or two break you may not have noticed this particular change. Just keep and eye on the bottom of the screen in the workbench menu. Maybe you have a real glitch of some kind, but the way repairing works did change recently.
---
So what does this do? Unlock a fps cap or what?
---
i've been getting a bug where the remodel ("paint") doesnt show on other players
---
Ok thx
---
You know what annoys me the most about the Drill? That it’s not a Pelmans! They mention one brand of top notch tools, the only mention of a brand name for something in ages, then we get a tool and it’s not a Pelmans drill. I don’t understand why they wouldn’t have used this little bit of continuity!
---
Also rabbit have high chance to spawn right at service whitespring enterance.
---
What are the problems excactly? Is it not working at all?
---
I always have the settings on auto ( cause I am nosy). Sometimes, when on a team, teamchat stopps working, but area chat works.
---
I then have to change to "Team" in the settings.
---
...like, 2? 3? They take up way to much carry weight to keep piles of them around for zero reason.
---
Some players can disrupt your connection. I don't know how it works but it happened to me before where if i get close to a particular player, it would lag my game horrendously, which didnt happen with other players. I tested by getting close then moving away many times to be certain.
---
It could be that.
---
I know right! It's almost as if they just didn't think it through. 'legendary Pelmans drill' even sounds right. So many opportunities missed 🤣
---
How would a weapon cause that to happen? Pretty weird.
---
Winner you said had a likeness of 3 and the password was shines. the letters I,N, and E would be the 3 likeness between the 2.
---
Typically if you do all the  ( ), { }, and &lt; &gt;  you're left with only 1 answer (the right one).
---
It does sound like you aren't fully understanding it though. Based on your 2nd paragraph, likeness doesn't mean the letters are in the correct spot, just that there is that many correct letters in what you selected.
---
If I chose Waters and was told 2 then picked Wasted and got 1, I would notice that the difference between the 2 is that Wasted doesn't have an R (but has all the other letters), so that's why it dropped by 1. Then I would look for words with R and see how many I get. But with your example, after picking winter and seeing 3, I would notice that subbing an I and an N in raised it by 1, so 1 of those letters must be part of the answer. Winner should've also said 3. At that point I would realize that T is not part of the answer. It's that kind of thought process you have to have when approaching a terminal. Don't put any emphasis on the placement of the letters, just how many letters are correct.
---
Hope this helps
---
No. 
---
Change for sake of change is no good. Majority of us are used to how it is now.
---
Lmao I just traded with a guy on there, no problems
---
If you have a cell phone, take a picture of your screen
---
If you have established mats reserve and know where to farm stuff, Rank II is more than enough for passive. Use Rank III when you repair.
---
PLEASE stop spreading missinformation.
---
Standard 50 cal receiver deals the same damage as a hardened 308.
---
Refined 50cal receiver deals 2 points of damage less than a hardened 308.
---
It attracts greifers too, always trying to loot your shoes.
---
It's RNGsus. I farmed that event 5 times and still no laser plan, had to offer 1k for it.
---
Ah neat! Glad to get an answer. Thanks!
---
That guy has no idea what he's talking about. Get the standard 50 cal receiver. It's as good as a hardened 308 with no drawbacks. 
---
Standard 50 cal: https://i.imgur.com/YYTvame.jpg
---
Hardened 308: https://i.imgur.com/zU5Zimk.png
---
Yea it doesn’t work at all like I can’t hear or talk to people and when I’m in a party and change to game chat it just keeps me in party chat that only happens for this game
---
Lots of good suggestions. Something else to consider is Barbarian. It will help pad out your strength and give you pretty decent DR(max 80). Only good outside of power armour though.
---
Smegma smearums.
---
I'd be interested in seeing them, say, toss a extra weekly challenge on for the next few weeks after they launch it which covers some of the challenges for this, but I'm not expecting to see that or free atoms down the row.
---
It’s complete trash. Very annoying.
---
Ok I'm confused by what you mean by "animated".
---
What do you mean for passive?
---
To be honest, I don't pay too much attention to money and don't make any effort to drain the vendors as often as possible and fast traveling already is so frigging cheap. With quests, events and selling my surplus shit from time to time I make way more money than fast traveling costs. I don't see the benefit in making this easier, to be honest.
---
I mean, I wouldn't personally mind if they did. But I don't think it will change much.
---
Nothing was pulled out of my ass. It’s like you refuse to accept any form of logic. I should’ve expected nothing less arguing with someone whose username starts with “YaBoi” yeah you sound like a real credible person. If you’re just going to ignore any form of logic I say then this is pointless. Troll on kiddo, no one is listening but you.
---
Thanks, these are great numbers! I've updated the website.
---
I’m over 40 and this is one of the only games I play, and I’ll be playing it for a long time to come. 
---
I think there’s something to what you’ve said. The story with the overseer, for instance, definitely doesn’t feel aimed at a younger crowd. Can you imagine an 18 year old boy being interested in what the overseer is doing, an old lady reminiscing about mom and dad, reliving her childhood? Nah. 
---
I think you’re right, this game is like a hobby for the over 30 crowd, not a real video game. Something you do for a couple hours every day to relax. But if you ask me, the demographic Bethesda really wants to get interested in this game is “older female”. Yeah man. They desperately want all the girls who think playing a Kajiit or elf is fun to start buying fallout too. Look at all the not-very-edgy atomshop stuff. And the holotapes. Oh lord the holotapes....
---
Around December I moved my camp from outside of WS golf course, to bog, about between Watoga and abandoned Bog Town, somewhat off the road.
---
Just as I got most of my crops and stuff ready(I had just tiny shack, it's open camp site), ground right next to my camp opens, and SB pops out. First time I ever saw it. The fissure was very small and unmarked on the map.
---
It wasn't bad, after some initial fights it rarely showed up when I visited my camp to do small errands. There are no enemies where are no players, and it was far enough from the road. 
---
I relocated about 3 weeks ago, because I wanted a collector for lead and more central location with the new vendor rules. Another place I seriously considered was between Prime fissure and another marked fissure, but I thought nuking and other things would make it laborous, and kinda wanted to try the collector business.
---
Lead&amp;acid spot would have been greater resource-wise but only one place for that and the location was too much in the edge of map.
---
I don't like the lever because it doesn't have the perforating magazine (gives 40% aa). So on other guns like the handmade and sniper rifle, you can get bloodied variants instead and get 40% aa with the mag.
---
Those 3 perks offer +20% each... Iron Fist offers +20%... Why would you use any other numbers? We're talking abojt their max potential, so we're using maxed out perks.
---
It's not that hard to understand.
---
My username is a joke, dumbass. We went over this already.
---
Same here, ps4, impossible to attach mods on power armor
---
I did the same, but after messing around with two oddball builds I was able to look at my original build more objectively. I trimmed a bunch of fat from my main build and am having a blast with my OP sleek build.
---
*It. It’s a robot, not a Her. I’m sorry, every time I see this in a loading screen, calling a robot a Her, it’s irks me. It’s not a woman. 
---
Sorry, I’m triggered.
---
i have been running around nuke zones for the last couple of days and almost no high radiation fluids , it used to be that you couldn't get hardened mass
---
yeah that's what I was thinking also buddy.  you would think they would have just increased drop rate of harden and left the rest the same
---
Was about to say the same. It looks like the same material texture.
---
Amen.  I have found ONE in the last two weeks.
---
Haven't you noticed that the fourth perk card from a pack has a small animation to it? That's what I mean.
---
next it will be glowing mass that we can't get just to complete the set
---
Fancy lad snacks apparently don't count.
---
Have we been wrong this all time? Are they salty snacks?
---
Yes you are correct thats why i said with the right build, using a pistol as a side arm without any dmg perks they feel like bb guns.
---
But buffing them would make legendary effects such as Bloodied, twoshot and say executioners very op. 
---
For example my bloodied explosive western revolver does almost the same a amount of dmg as my 1* Bloodied Pump Shotgun with all dmg perks and as pistols are much better with sneak attacks cause of much better range they are better in my opinion.
---
But yes i would love to see a little buff for pistols and maybe even some perk with armor penetraion effect
---
where is garhm i can never seem to come across him
---
You mean in the bunker or in the resort?
---
I mostly just get disoriented by all the things happening at once and kill Eyebombs in VATS and die repeatedly. I keep wondering how high the devs were when they wrote the event but tbh its still fun I guess. My best skill is that I remember to stash my junk first.
---
Why don’t you just find a weapon that “speaks to you” and go from there, rather than worrying about which is better/best? For example, the ski sword is something like the best one handed weapon, damage wise. But, Fuck, is that an ugly stupid weapon. Like a fiber glass ski is better than a sword.
---
In the resort.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm just not understansing the Likeness process all that well. I alwayd thought if there was a Likeness of 2 in a word like Waters, that it meant 2 letters are in the correct spot, not that 2 letters in the word are correct, which is what would lead me to something like Wasted cause of the W and the A. But when the password ends up being something completely off the first word I click on like Shines, the only letters in that word that matches Waters is the S and the E, which only the last S are is the correct spot.
---
As in my second example where the word Moonwalk has a Likeness of 4, but the password is Speeches, none of those letters matches the any of the letters in Moonwalk.
---
I dunno, LoL. I mean, I have no issue figuring it out after a few attempts, and sometimes even on the first try, it just gets so confusing sometimes ☺
---
Nuka Dark is beer.
---
im on ps4 but thanks for the offer and the reply :)
---
A joke, just like you.
---
Yes they do, and if we’re talking maxed out, like I said before, twisted muscles provides 25% more dmg from every dmg boost melee gets, such as bloodied, adrenal, iron fist, str. It’s that simple, that’s why it’s so much stronger, it has more dmg, and more attack speed.
---
I agree there is something wrong with the hacking system sometimes in fallout 76 the words not in there. Weather sceptics will believe me or not meh... but just the other day at the ammo factory I hacked the terminal upstairs there and did all the &lt;&gt; () stuff and was left with only one word and it was incorrect.
---
And yes comparing Bloodied to normal performance of all guns just isnt fair since bloodied makes everything good especially with adrenal reaction mutation
---
He's kind of a set route. Walks from top of the world down to whitesprings. Sometimes the other way around too. Caught him on the west side train tracks too.
---
yeah thats not just rng, hardened mass drop rate a little bit and high raditation fluids drop rate have been heavily nurfed
---
He wanders around. Check out dulfy for the route. http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
okey thanks i will check it out
---
And wouldn't it be nice
---
Excavator arms (both together) yield double ore. Rusty knuckles also double ore harvested. Rusty knuckles excavator gives 4 ore from deposits instead of 1. Does not apply to extractor locations for whatever reason, just the single nodes.
---
Give it to your virgin friend who doesnt have a hat to tip to the ladies,
---
Really great idea !
---
Shouldn't no
---
I am not on PS4 but a great idea none the less, well done
---
I got a TSE Dragon from the event today.
---
Pretty fun ones, try it?
---
I make them and then leave them in containers around the world for other players to find, my alt character is called Johnny Nukashine
---
thanks
---
Do events. Everyone goes to locals, but doing events, even defend workshop events in the savage divide or bog, will often have 2 and 3* show up.
---
Nice. Was thinking of doing this.
---
I found a bloodied Fat man on my unyielding char and thought it would he funny to try out. It was during Fasnacht too so loads of mini nukes around. And yep, dense does not make you immune lol.
---
Around 6-7 weeks ago I had enough disease cures too cure myself of 40 different diseases.
---
Now I only have 2 disease cures left...
---
I think this happens when someone has recently killed the enemies in the area. When I do a whitesprings run and someone is near me (usually doing the same run), a lot of the ghouls will wake up and and then die immediately and contain no loot. I think I just have to wait longer for them to properly respawn after someone has killed them.
---
Well tbh just because you take your time and explore doesnt mean everyone plays like that. 9hrs is enough time to do much much much much much more than you did. 
---
You could then argue well, then maybe this isnt the game for someone rushing. To that you're right, it's not but that doesn't mean they can't play and voice themselves.
---
I like to see it as a “raiderized” version of the excavator pa
---
I run around that bit North of Whitesprings quite a bit. Never have I spotted this sign.   
---
The hell, Sheepsquatch and/or Raiders?
---
You can do them more than once a day. I don’t know how server hopping effects these dailies, but I’ve done these games more than once a day after leaving the game and coming back.
---
oh ok I’ll try that :)
---
Didnt we have exactly that last week?
---
Bethesda has always had buggy games, but this one is s.p.e.c.i.al, the sheepsquache quest line ain't even out but its prompts for attacking workshops still pop up in game with placeholder scorched enemies in it, and you can be Kim Jong un for a few hours as an added bonus,
---
Well, the first try would just be a good guess lol.  
---
But the 2nd example isn't an exact example and in that example yeah, that doesn't make sense but it also wouldn't happen to begin with because a likeness of 4 will have those 4 letters in the answer somewhere. I get what you're saying with the example, but in order to explain it thoroughly from start to finish I need exact real examples (similar to your first example). But the biggest thing to keep in mind (and arguably the only thing) is that likeness is just referring to the letters, not the placement of them. As long as you don't get hung up on placement, you should be ok.
---
Same here I get them now and again about the unknown error, no idea what that is all about.
---
No problem. Unfortunately it's still often hard to find him but it gets you looking in the right place :).
---
Max party size is 4, so he could only invite 2 others. Maybe they needed to fast travel to you? Were you sharing perks they wanted?
---
All I want are scopes, body types and maybe a repeater of some sorts. As for bolt types I’ll let the legendary effects handle that.
---
Couple hundred meters? Maybe.
---
Oh wow. Can't say I've ever had that hapoen before, but yeah, it's whack sometimes, LoL. Even after I do all the closed brackets, I'm left with like 6 words, so I'm not understanding how some players are left with only 1 word. Maybe it's cause of their Intelligence? That's possible, as I only have an Intelligence of like 5, maybe 6 or 7 with the Egghunt mutation (don't remember the bonus it gives a off hand). I'll have to pay more attention and see if I ever have that happen to me.
---
What's the LFG tool?
---
For starched genes, it requires you to spend Two levels to obtain the effect you want. If it was just a 2* card then you’d only have to use one level. That’s probably part of their reasoning on some of those cards: how many levels it takes to earn everything.
---
The boss spawns as a 3 star, yes.
---
Do you know if people actually find them?
---
Watoga High school gives 100+ from all of the plates and cutlery on tables in the cafeteria and above the kitchen.
---
There's a small farmhouse northwest of Bolton Greens that has 25 cat bowls in there which give 2 plastic each.
---
Morgan town high school (plastic pumpkins bowling pins and golf balls) Watoga high school cafeteria (trays/utensils) that’s for plastic
---
Good. Isn't it great how we definitely all don't have these weapons of mass destruction and therefore there's no need to check what's inside that blue box in my camp?
---
i haven't seen any posts on here but there are usally other players in the area, i tend to leave them in high traffic areas
---
I have a .44 Snubnose that I use in low level areas to burn through the ammo that I have, this also allows me to build up the other ammo types I want too.
---
Too many effects stacked on one card. Crafting Mods. Lower weapon crafting costs. Increased durability. I think I’m forgetting another. The other 5 star cards just reduce weapon wear and allow crafting (or crafting and damage in Demo Experts case).
---
I got back into this game about a week ago and have only had 2 disconnects. I'm pretty patient and like to take my own pace (half the Forest is still unexplored for me but I have half the Savage Divide explored and have joined the Enclave) but your son really needs patience. Bethesda's engine is from 2003. They can make it good but it was never designed for online play and disconnects are going to happen. He'll have to learn to deal with it.
---
Huh, I always do this. Is that why I’ve only seen four eggs despite playing every day? FML.
---
yeah but it's something to now that i finished all the quests
---
Lewisberg has alot of plates and forks laying about the street markets, and plastic cups at Camdan Park for a good haul.
---
*Camden park
---
No that could end up being a bad idea because 
---
1.buying caps off sites like ebay then transferring them into atoms  would remove any revenue going to Bethesda. The point of the atom shop is so Bethesda can make money to keep the game going and the dlc free
---
2.buying caps with atoms would piss off so many people because the atom store is only supposed to sell cosmetics
---
was it like that when the game first came out? because i remember having both and remembering the 50 cal did a decent amount less.
---
sounds like other people remember it being that way also
---
I doubt that somebody is going to be cycling at 40 miles per hour everywhere. Plus, in fallout 4, the brotherhood carried you around in a vertibird that took you to the dryden and for me that didn't glitch at all. It all depends on bethesdas server and how well it performs. It can load chunks at insane distances, but a bike shouldn't have a problem with such thing as it's on the ground all the time
---
40 miles is 64.37 km
---
Only we, who grinded atoms since dawn of humanity, are able to hold such a powerful painjob. It is not for newborn iphone holding slaves.
---
How high of levels are the enemies there?
---
I'm having a hard time getting plans in general, much less plans for the lever. I swear I go through so many weapons and get maybe one or two plans a day, tops
---
I might've exaggeratedexaggerated a bit, but I was playing by myself and I didn't invite anyone but someone somehow joined with me and made a team. Then he invited his buddies. I left without figuring out how or why
---
Map-wise I think the interiors of several cells, including the Silos are slightly south-southeast of the White Powder lodge (this is also where the interior of the Dev room was before). On a datamined map I have all the different crafting stations from most interiors shows up slightly south-southeast of White Powder on the map. A nuke there might possibly affect multiple interiors. 
---
Possibly...
---
Watoga is 40+ usually. No enemies at the farmhouse I think.
---
you could always go to help.bethesda.net/app/home/ log in with your account and send a support ticket I've refunded several items that I accidentally bought or didn't like they seem pretty chill and gave me atoms back in a timely fashion
---
Kinky.
---
Cool idea, just thought of something. Too bad we couldn't rename notes and leave our own in places as well
---
See, this is what I'm not getting. The W and the A in Waters are the only two letters that match in Wasted, while The S is the last letter in Waters and the 3rd letter in Wasted and the E is the 4th letter in Waters and the 5th letter in Wasted, so the Likeness would be the W and the A. 
---
In the word Winner, only the W matches the W in the word Waters while the E is the 5th letter in Winner and the 4th letter in Waters, so why was there a Likeness of 2 with Waters when Winner only has one matching letter in the correct spot, yet it's now telling me Winner has a Likeness of 3, and the actual password Shines has only one letter that matches the word Waters and that's the S at the end.
---
I just don't get it, LoL.
---
LMG. Ammo is too costly to craft and its very heavy.
---
Treaure maps and events only.  What platform?
---
The majority of us? Speak for yourself. I'd prefer spoiling items at the top.
---
No I haven't. Same with the BoS combat arms. I've got the legs and chest, but can't get the plans from Grafton anymore like you used to be able to. :/
---
It’s a human? Gah
---
Ah okay. Sometimes people will invite you to a team because they want to travel for free. It's harmless, I do it to help others out.
---
Often if you hover over let's say your friends icon, it will show a different player and that's where some of the random invites come from as well. These ones want you to decline, that's a bug though.
---
Idk why it would of automatically accepted you.
---
Idk man... I post up at 76 quite often to conduct trading with other players from market threads. Sometimes they're finishing something up, so sometimes I'll hang around 76 for 10-15 mins waiting for them.
---
This happened to me yesterday too and I basically never store my junk. 20 levels worth of farm all gone and for a newbie that kind of sucks. 😓 I think I probably spent a good twenty minutes looking for my loot at my death spot till I figured out that someone has just picked it up...
---
I swear the skill level of players doing this event is rock bottom. The other day I was triple conduit just avoiding the squatch and taking out the bots instead when I turned behind me I realised nobody was even attacking the boss!
---
There was literally 10 other people there all essentially doing nothing. I had to tell them off over voice chat.
---
This looks awesome! 
---
If you have a little time, could you help me figure out how you got 381 damage listed on a weapon which has 2 base damage? With my [weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html), I can get up to 74 damage per hit and 404 damage per second, but my data and formulas may be incorrect for melee weapons.
---
Where you the one who was chucking stuff in the bin at white springs?
---
really?
---
BOS stuff is dropping again after last patch.  Always at various static random drop points.
---
Plastic - Morgantown High School and Farmhouse north of Bolton Greens - both low level areas
---
Watoga High School  - loads of plastic plates and such, higher level ghouls and chances of getting caught in PvP (not happened to me yet, but possible)
---
Lead - Charleston Fire station, Flatwoods Gym (by the motel behind where you spawn if you Ft to Flatwoods) Any of the three Missile Silo's (a few robots and you need to be a general with the enclave to access them.
---
Real Lead numbers: Lucky Hole Mine (mid level enemies, crickets, rats, molerats and mole miners) an absolute shit-ton of lead ore available, when level 25 get excavator armour (from garrahan Mining Headquarters) and use that to double your yield. Once you hit level 50 invest in the Super Duper perk i the luck tree.
---
Using Excavator PA and Super Duper will easily net you 1,000 lead per run. 
---
Once you are making this much lead you will find getting enough iron to make ammo a problem, head to Hornwright Testing Site #2 and explore the hills surrounding it, for about 6-700 Iron per run.
---
Once you are swimming in Lead and iron Ore, Acid will become your biggest problem.
---
Hemlock Holes is a workshop worth grabbing for it;s three acid resource nodes. Beyond that kill Grafton Monsters (Grafton, Charleston X2, beside Hemlock Holes) and Snallygasters (Charleston X2, Near Hemlock Holes X2) for 50+ acid per server hop.
---
Yo, act with kindness, but don't expect gratitude. If i'm in that area and see something that i need i would also take it \^\^ You give away your stuff into a open world container, of course players are going to take stuff out of it. It shouldn't be your problem anymore if you literally put your trash away.
---
That’s actually a much easier approach to solving the problem I listed, I’d actually like that a lot. Even if they don’t go through with a physical atomic shop they should at least release the ability to see coming soon items with release dates, it’s much better then data mining the future items and waiting in anticipation for the day it’ll show up in shop.
---
15 year old here. i love this game, it’s kinda therapeutic in a way. not too much pressure like lots of games.
---
I thought that we would have got a full bunny ju.psuit like the one the vault boy is wearing on the store art
---
You can make them floating actually  if you put the egg on top of a nuka cola machine then remove it, it should stay up there
---
Yuh huh, not too fussed you're missing some eggs now are ya!
---
When I get bored I take off all my good weapons and armor, craft a new weapon I haven’t used yet, craft some armor to go with it till I get the right look (I only craft lvl 20 armor because, as you say, the game is eeeeeasy and I don’t want to waste ballistic fiber on armor I’m only going to use for a week) and try to play a bit differently. Be a different character, you know? But I hear you, the bored is real. Lvl 175 and it getting to the point where if I’m not playing with one of my teammates I don’t know what to do in game. Farm more loot? But why?
---
I certainly hope so. Seems like something fun they could add without putting too much stress on the servers that hold the main world, which I guess is the problem with some other suggestions like being able to build big settlement ourselves. Most of it could be prebuilt and just allow for some personal touches to the player's shops.
---
When referring to partychat so you referr to the PS Partychat, or to the ingame setting for audio?
---
If the Vendor thing is up im going to mass produce alcohol and chems so all raiders are satisfied :p
---
Its a Bethesda game. You can ger launched into orbit by bumping a bucket wrong.
---
Similar thing if you want a cute as fuck tiny dog.
---
Head to Harpers Ferry, from Fast Travel point do a 180.walk to the end of the road, until you start to take rads, look for a wooden path leading off the road to the right. Follow that, it leads you up various steps and ramps and stairs until you get on top of the cliff, look around and you'll see more ladders leading you to an overlook, on that overlook are two skeletons, a dog bowl and a tiny dog.
---
Build your camp there :)
---
You think so? I have the Impression, that the Mutation ist far more common ( because cheaper and much easier to get).
---
As would I, currently scrolling all the way to the bottom of my aid is extremely tedious.
---
No. We don’t deserve compensation. This is getting pathetic.
---
Y’all still get nukes??? I swear it’s been 6 days since I’ve seen one on PS4
---
Not the best source, but you get a lot of plastic killing mutants and scraping their assault and laser rifles.
---
I leave them in bags in front of 76 and in the overseers stash. It's definitely gotta be a fun little surprise for the bee players! XD
---
I remember back in the BETA .50 cal on a hunting rifle was awful. Large drop in damage. Seems that has been changed since, good to know.
---
I wasn’t getting much out of whitesprings lately but someone nuked Welch today (never seen it nuked) and I got more high radiation fluid than I had in a long time. Not a lot of flora down there, but I was able to save the fluid and masses for another event at the fissure site later on in the day.
---
this is a shot in the dark but does unlocking the science perks let you craft the energy weapon?
---
i dont remember getting any plans but i can somehow craft a lot of the energy weapons.
---
again..not sure if thats how it works but just an idea
---
We should be able to alter the level of the cards, so once we get the card maxed, we can change the level it has, so if you want a perk card to have a lower stat so that you can add another perk card, then you can set the card to level 3 (from level 4)
---
Aww man I want the Witch Mutation.
---
*I'll get you my pretty... and your little dog too!*
---
Yeah no nukes for ages. I had to actually drop one myself the other day. And of course, I could find fluids to craft flux. Great. Basically two hours wasted.
---
Nice. I know a few spots where some Super Mutants are.
---
10.
---
Some challenges are asking me to visit locales in certain areas, but because I visited these areas in beta (e.g. point pleasant), the challenges wont complete. I am positive that I have at least 500 atoms waiting for this.
---
I did also buy a cap in the atom store in beta, but never got it in the full game. I got a 500 atom refund for it
---
I can't say this for sure, but I could swear that around January some dataminer said that there were apparently some kind of Christmas gift lunchboxes or something that players were supposed to get, but that ended up getting cut (most likely due to management). I'd love to find that post and see if there was ever any proof behind it. I'd like to think these devs are truly working from passion and doing their best with what they have
---
Yeah I might have to just drop one tomorrow I want to know if queen has a chance at dropping the mounted head either that or would be nice to legend hunt some more I’m still looking for a good deathclaw gauntlet because I’m too poor to buy a good one from other players lol
---
To live together
---
That's right, its not just events and treasure maps. You can sometimes find it laying there out in the open if you get lucky at a random spawn.
---
Was farming SB’s in the bog and I too saw the SBQ, no event. Played her by myself for a few minutes, but each time I died, her health reset. So, I messaged a few higher level players in the map, and pretty soon we had a small team. Died again, but with the other players engaged, her health did not reset. Awesome thing is that there is no time limit to kill her, so aside from a DC, you’re guaranteed to kill her. She drops same Leg gear and Prime plans. No wall mountable SBQ plans dropped for me. Not sure how common this is, but it was a neat experience.
---
You da real MVP. Cheers mate, took me no less then a simple trip to the service entrance and turning around facing south and found them in a matter of seconds.
---
kinda sad youre so defensive of this game that you dont believe dozens of independent accounts of the bug...noone can proove it unless theyre recording 100% of the time and that just isnt something people do. it happened to me with no vendors or inventory shenanigains. 
---
ill say its rare. only happened once that i noticed in 100 hours of playtime but its 100% a thing. seems more common since this last update
---
Wait, What?
---
Sort by spoil? Is this new (I haven't been on in several days)??
---
Anyone could have easily bought it. It just shows either you wasted money or you played it non stop and decided to buy that.
---
I bought a different PA paint before it came out, gutted, but I cant change that now
---
I just need lead and plastic to make shotgun ammo. Always running low on that. 
---
And thanks so much for the help. Adding this comment to my notes for referral. Take my upvote.
---
That's exactly my point. So you're saying that all max Slugger will only add about 100 damage? That's just not true.
---
And still not banned? Dafuq?
---
lost mine last week so the fear is very real. PA pieces seem to disappear commonly. but the bug for weapons/armour seems fairly rare
---
yeah that would be cool
---
yeah no doubt dude
---
I'm on xbox I set about 3 off a day sometimes
---
PS
---
Top of the world would be great imo.
---
what are you playing it on
---
Ok there may be a better way for you to get shotgun shells specifically.
---
Again Morgantown is the place to be, go through the airport (do collision course if it shows up) and kill every scorched you find  (just don't use a shotgun, use a machete or something to minimise ammo usage) head to the high school, kill all the scorched.
---
Hell just wander around the entire green area of the map (The Forest) and kill and loot every scorched you come across, when you have killed everyone, server hop and repeat.
---
Low level scorched are about the most efficient way to stock up on shotgun shells (and also shotgun mods from all the shotguns you will be able to scrap)
---
When you do ammo and resource runs in low level areas, switch to melee, or build a pipe rifle to use up your .38's.
---
Lvl 1 and 6 scorched die really easily to any weapon once you are a few levels above them and they have a tendency to carry shotguns quite a lot
---
A run through the school and airport alone should get you a hundred shells or more, if the Collision Course event pops then you can close to double that.
---
They’re for launching nukes
---
i sometimes walk around forest in my T-51 Nuka Coka Power Armour and if i come across a new player i will give  some nuka colas as a welcome pack
---
awsome I may have to try that
---
It's a bug, they should go away after changing sessions, happened to me yesterday too. The silo codes are used to decipher the launch codes for th 3 silos on the map, if you want to launch nukes however there are websites that tell you the current codes. You don't really need to pick them up unless you want to manually decipher the codes.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
This reminds me of DC Universe Online. Where you could go to the Justice League Watchtower(or the evil lair if you were with the bad guys), and every armor and weapon was on display.
---
Be prepared for the long night
---
nice
---
Ah okay.
---
Yes, Fallout seems to have a problem with that.
---
If you have a PS chatparty it's always prioritized. Sometimes leaving the PS chatparty and unplugging/ replugging the microfon device works. Sometimes you have fiddle with the ingame audio settings, sometimes you have to start the Game anew.
---
This is the reason I mostly use the ingame Chat nowadays to reduce the hassle.
---
It's been this way since at least January...
---
If you check the flavor text for each of the receiver it fits what people say, but if you check the actual values you'll notice that the standard 50cal is as good as hardened 308.
---
It makes absolutely no sense why the refined 50 cal has "superior damage" in the text but it does less than the standard 50 cal. Standar 50cal only states that it changes the ammo type.
---
Another reason why people say 50cal is bad is because the standard 50cal receiver is rare as fuck and all other 50cal receiver deal less damage than hardened 308.
---
I think there was a massive stealth nerf on nuked creatures' loots. They used to give glowing meats and stuffs even if you didn't kill one, and you could pick up free stuffs from someone else's kills- Now they don't give you anything if you didn't kill them.
---
Looking for group, i think they meant the ads people post in that section
---
Thanks. Just sick and tired of barely having any ammo. I have some 10mm pistols with a lot of ammo plus some melee weapons to help.
---
ye I remember that they where the good old days
---
It think it's just shitty framerates. 
---
My biggest issue in the game is the handprint scanners. It's for the left hand &amp; it's always placed on the right side of doors. It's stupid, but it irritates the hell outta me. Lol
---
I know I've run into the Scorched there before as well.
---
No gone in May will be gone
---
that's why im willing to pay 1830 for keycard really want imposter outfit
---
I have had scorched fly into the air from a headshot. But not what you are describing.
---
[Pretty sure she says “fuck”.](https://digitalcitizen.ca/2011/12/26/ol-man-mose-for-those-who-like-1930s-music-with-f-bombs/)
---
Are you on PS4? You can have mine tonight. I’ll be on in like 4 hours
---
yes, its a permanent addition.
---
Only in the Cranberry Bog, so Fort Defiance for bout 20 Fiber and all those BoS Camps at the outer Line of the Bog (i think there 5) for 1-4 Fiber each Camp.
---
That's a lot of sarcasm, I mean sarcasm tends to be shorter, that seemed like a rant that needed letting out, but each to their own, be it right or wrong.
---
This tip is brought to you by Sugar Bombs! Sugar Bombs - your daily dose of sugar!
---
isn’t there a glitch for the sickle with bear arms or something where u can get around 200 dmg?
---
Yeah the Bog is rly good for farming B. Fiber. Camp McClin feels like that everyone goes there since its so close to Vault 76 so i dont bother to go there.
---
Would be great to turn 3 duplicates into a new/other card
---
Nobody knows?
---
I've found a ton of armor plans via treasure maps. 3 of us spent Saturday morning using all of our Savage Divide maps. BOS was not one of the plans we found but holy hell are we set on plans.
---
BTW the other 2 upped their luck to absurd high levels and my character has average luck (8 or 9). We didn't see a difference in loot between us.
---
Yes please. I don't mind to discard and lose it if necessary, IDC just let me do something with it.
---
Oh yeah, of course.
---
Nope it's been there since beta.
---
I don't mind someone having a go, I might not agree with them, but too many players seem to jump on the bandwagon and have a go for the sake of going with a group, it's easier to pick a fight with a bunch of people backing you, but harder to do so on your own, but whatever the reasons, make sure it's from you and not just repeating the comments of others for a reaction on social media.  
---
Have non-cosmetics been added yet? I don't see anything that's like that in the store currently, they might add repair kits, they might not, I won't be buying them, don't see the point, but in the end, people can complain when a non-cosmetic item is added, but should only do so when it is added, otherwise it's speculation, hell BGS might change their mind in the light of player feedback, maybe.  
---
In the meantime I will continue to play Fallout 76, because I like it and I want to, I do not need the approval of others to determine what I like.
---
First off if you check all the npc records for the scorched animals the race and/or enc template they are referenced from have the keywords for the base npc. They don't lose them just because they have been variented, meaning they are actually effected by the vs damage that corresponds with them
---
I can't explain the DR calculations, but it technically makes your weapon do closer to the Damage stated in your pip-boy, instead of boosting Damage directly like other effects.
---
Uh, Ghouls, Scorched, Mole Rats and other "Weak" enemies tend to have lower DR than Super Mutants and Deathclaws.
---
Kind of, depends on the situation.
---
No.
---
Kind of, deoends on the situation.
---
Yes, TSE has been nerfed so that other Legendaries may shine.
---
Raiderized raider PA? Raider PA is already raiderized T-model PA parts anyway, should be something different like maybe some raider faction themed then.
---
If the challenges (that earn you Atoms) weren’t an ever moving goal post (think the “level up” Challenge; it’s now got about another 2 layers of hoops for us to jump through) I’ll probably never check my Challenges again.
---
They are clearly making it harder to obtain in game Atoms, what’s wrong Bethesda?  We not spending real $$$ enough for your shop of skins?
---
He is a lot easier to spawn at the random spawn point west down the road from Lady Janet's Soft Serve, just past the bus. I usually get him in just a few server jumps there, unless RNGesus is in a bad mood.
---
Huh intresting seems really unfair to me but what else can you expect
---
No I'm on xbox, 
---
And you're unable to give or sell the keycard
---
That's OK, you wont get a chance to eat me, I am the guy on the roof safely sniping all the adds and explosive bots chasing you.
---
Same Problem ups and downs from 60fps to literally 1 and back, have to switch Servers then it gets better.
---
So it could be a server related issue? Thanks
---
You can use it to your advantage. For instance I have 2* in each slugger perk cards when I’m using traveling pharmacy in adventure, but in survival I take off pharmacy and run 3* slugger cards for more damage
---
Thats because they get upvoted a lot more than the hundreds of requests for the same thing that spur on these rants
---
Yes please!
---
A full-on sneak build isn't even needed, gun-fu/adrenaline crit works awesome. Not to naysay the sneak setup, but there's other viable options than just that and bloodied.
---
something so simple yet they don't do it.....instead, most of the people who actually do build camps have to glitch camp objects to get a decent camp built :/ 
---
Its crazy what potential they have here for camps and with the atom shop but I am guessing there is only like 1 person working on these things seeing they have another game coming this year.
---
I just assume that if you like the game enough to make suggestions and be following the sub on it you probably also be looking for infomation about that game too since it would be interesting
---
I mean, you could, but a level of trust would be required that I don’t think you would find
---
yea just luckky run. 4 military ammo bags at fort defiance.
---
In every vault at the same time
---
 Claiming a workshop flags you for pvp, it even warns you before you accept to claim it. If you still choose to claim then, despite the warning, you've got no grounds for complaint. They're in the game to encourage conflict, if you don't want that then leave them alone.
---
I've seen 5 or 6 impossible daily and weekly challenges about the camera over the last few days. I find it quite dodgy that they didn't switch them to something obtainable.
---
It's not just for the sake of it though.  This would be an improvement.
---
U r v cule est person i haf evar m3t bruv
---
Thanks, totally forgot about those until I saw this post.
---
Also, for the candy, I took over the Sunshine Meadows Farm and I've got the food packaging factory cranking out sugar bombs. It's not locked, so if someone happens to run into it, help yourself.
---
The .44 and the western revolvers would be so much better if they were double-action. In their current state they're just single-action revolvers with better damage and reload...
---
How do we get it? I have nothing shown :/
---
I think I still have my free one, on Xbox: BugDragon. Can get it done. ((I usually check Looking for Groups posts.))
---
Looking to the Future Emote.
---
Still in the shop, but nobody seems to be able to use it.
---
It's a bug though.
---
I will never not notice this now.
---
for your own peace of mind, dont claim a workshop. or accept the risk to meet the bullies. Thats part of the game...
---
Haha you're not the only one, one of my friends I play this game with noted that and it drives them mad!
---
As someone who does stuff similar to what you’ve described, we don’t go in for the caps we go in for the thrill and fight, if we lose because we picked the wrong target, we lose (and yes I’m aware that doesn’t happen due to our god tier equipment) but more often then not if you die in 1 shot and don’t seek revenge the person will leave you be. A big driving factor behind this behaviour is the lack of pvp in survival, sure you can go to a couple stations and maybe there’s somewhere their, sure there’s a leaderboard but all they need to do is crouch and u can’t see them, and most of the time me and my buddies are that leaderboard, a solution to everyone’s problems would be maybe a pulsing area system in survival, where it’d give u a massive area, bout the size of a nuke zone, and it’d be like hey this player is somewhere inside this zone, have it so the zone isn’t always visible, instead make it visible for certain periods of time, increasing the amount of time it’s visible for if the person is standing and has their weapon out. If you did this you’d move us pvp players back over to survival since it’d be fun again, and you’d leave adventure mode be. Also I apologise on behalf of the pvp community that you  feel the way you do, the majority of us don’t go out of our way to kill you even if it seems that way, we’re just so desperate for any sort of fight that we’ll teleport to a workshop, spend more caps to contest, kill the owners once and leave, often without taking their bag. That’s also a extreme case that we do that, majority of the time we come up do the pvp emote and shoot u, if u shoot back fair game if you don’t, well we might do the confused or angry emote and go
---
Why would you think it would be removed? It's related to a questline, so unless they remove it as well...
---
I believe marine needs paint as well.
---
All right, added you :)
---
I startedd playing a few week's ago and it's been there as far as i can remember
---
It happens. I witnessed it. I have no proof. People won’t believe it and downvote everything until it happens to them as well. But I don’t give a shit if they believe me or not to be honest.
---
Usually happens to me as I'm coming up on a 3 star legendary 😕
---
Bethesda would really be a bunch of fun-ghi's if they did this
---
Yes I keep getting notices that I have added random people to my team or rather I have sent them an invite.
---
Hey M8, sendt u a friendrequest, my IGN is RPGth93 woud love to get my hands on this helmet. been looking for it forever
---
It's intentially spaced out so you can't get all 3 early on. Also, yeah, flexibility is nice.
---
I agree.
---
I think so. I checked and some of his comment also says he is 72. he uses LOL in all caps and I think that's what a 72 yo man would do on the internet. he is only active in this sub like his grandson setup this ac for him and told him about this sub so he only know about this sub. really interesting to see a 72 yo playing fo76. great to have him here
---
I have screen shots of three blast zones at once from this week. ((Xbox))
---
The demo expert nerf. Enough said.
---
Nocturnal wooden left arm last night. It has become somewhat a joke. 10 mins before, 3* fogcrawler got me a 1* Ghoul slayers chest piece. It really is a massive load of bullshit.
---
Saw a post about it yesterday. Logged in today to realize my *** bloodied meat hook was gone. To add to the injury, I had put a third hook mod on it. 
---
I don't really mind since I have other weapons but I'd like to understand.
---
There have been a few unofficial polls on reddit and from what I recall the majority of folks are over 20 with a good chunk over 30
---
I think that's why i was most confused, it hadn't been looted (and was still locked)
---
Once I fought a scorchbeast at a low level using sneak and a black powder rifle for so goddam long and his corpse got stuck in a tree so I couldn’t even loot it.
---
I nearly cried.
---
Hmmm, ok, so Likeness doesn't mean number of letters in the correct spot, just that they're in the word somewhere. Got it, LoL.
---
But yeah, I have had it give me a Likeness from a word that the final password didn't match (like Moonwalk and Speeches). It doesn't really happen all that often though, but when it does I find it kindda odd. I mean, I'm not gonna complain. Doesn't matter what the password is, it's free experience either way, LoL. I was just wondering how it all worked and if anyone else has noticed it happening. Seems to happen more often with the longer passwords than it does the shorter ones, but it has happened with shorter words too like Dear and Most.
---
It's all just weird and confusing sometimes, LoL.
---
I agree. I've experienced most of the modern Fallout games, from fallout 3 on. So I know what to expect, he has too, but this level of annoyance is new to him.
---
People take them, it's a pain.
---
I can sell u BOS chest plan for 3k
---
Because fast travelling... Fast travelling never changes
---
I got one
---
If someone shoots you don't shoot back and you wont enter PVP and if you dont want to risk PVP never take over a work shop. It's so simple and yet again and again the same complaint.
---
Their removing the poster from atomic shop on may 7th i assume their getting rid of it all together then or no
---
Good to know. Sadly I haven't but I also need to play Fallout 1 and 2. Somehow they have issues with my computer.
---
People of any age can enjoy the game (though it's 18 rated, so take that how you will.)
---
But sometimes the game simply does not want to be played. If a game fucks you around enough times in a row, you'll take a break. Even if you like the game.
---
People like you who whine here are just hopeless. You simply dont understand the mechanics that are intended when owning a workshop. Not our fault, you're illiterate. They've limited PvP in adventure mode so much except when one owns a workshop, so really stop complaining about an intended feature, moron.
---
I've never had someone try to take a workshop from me and people cant do damage to me even if I don't have pacifist on, it's usually on because if I want pvp I will either do it or go to survival
---
That is true. I'll go back and so will my son, but right now we're on a break from it.
---
I used about 60 stims last night hiding in the hut as all 3 conduits. I died as the event ended and got nothing.
---
Its the 3rd time this has happened and I'm not doing it any more. The others can pull their finger out.
---
if you're looking for a similar experience to any other fallout game I couldn't reccomend this game, it's fun by some means, but the story/interactions of the previous fo's are definitely not in this one.
---
Oh yeah! I forgot about that motherlode, I was trying to hunt for mirelurk eggs 😂
---
Ahhhh good to know. Yeah my Sniper build also transitioned but from being bloodied to now just being max health, and is still very viable, just feels a bit boring to me now after a good couple months just using the same weapons, but recently been joking around with a Bloodied Bowie Knife, cause that thing just wipes out west-tek, it's an absolute joke XD.
---
I recently bought the plan for Emergency protocols for T-51b, even though I'm encumbered, the amount of damage I took in West-Tek was just tickle damage, so i'm planning too change from reactive plates on my Excavator to Emergency Protocols. I had Reactive plates because I figured if I deal 50% meele damage back to the opponent, if some bloodied Unyielding unarmed build comes and tries to smack me, I'd also take them down with my since they'll get 50% of their damage back, and since their low health they'll also died (some people swore at me saying I was hacking lol(worth losing that 100 caps)).
---
But yeah I face the same problem, in PA  I try not to but sometimes just drain fusion cores cause of VATS, and since PA doesn't grant any real sneak bonuses, except for the Stealth boy mod, it's not very sneak when you see a bright yellowed chunk of metal just sneak from tree to tree.
---
The only way I've adapted with sometimes using a hazmat suit is using Berserker weapons. Since it does more damage the lower your damage resistance, and since the hazmat suit does nothing, a Berserker Explosive Lever action or a Berserker melee does pretty well with a couple of it's appropriate perks, but is still hella squishy, but that means that those weapons really only take effect in a hazmat suit or when naked, not in PA or in armour, so they can just clog up STASH space (says the guy with like 20 heavy weapons clogging up his stash).
---
But thanks, definitely gives me something to think about!
---
A high level one spawns at White Springs as well. I've found it out by the fence S.E. area IIRC.
---
I have no working knowledge on how loot tables in these games work. But the name itself implies on a list of items and some kind of percentage on chance on each for it to appear on loot.
---
How hard is it to tweak this list?
---
Do they need to code the whole game from scratch to tweak it ?
---
People are not asking for 3\* god like weapons on all drops, but maybe tune down on the wood armor and other not so used items. They must have some kind of calculator on which items are used more often to kill mobs.
---
If they have been tweaking them constantly it would calm the player base a lot to just inform us that they have been and will continue to tweak them on weekly basis.
---
There's fun to be had for sure mate, and the story (as disjointed as it is) is actually pretty cool once you put it all together, would have made an amazing single player game. I say go for it
---
Ew that sounds like a cool combo. I'm sporting the bathrobe with it :). It's a nice balance of sexy/cute/creepy lol.
---
They're only removing the poster from the Atomic shop. The quest and event is permanent
---
Good idea, feels like a big waste of a perfectly good vault, we were only there for a few minutes, give it a good use
---
I started playing Fallout when I got to Uni at 18. My Brother was playing the classic Fallout games even younger.
---
Only problem with 76 is there is less to engage and enthrall. New Vegas is still one of my all time favourites. Every crash, every hour of progress made me want to scream and rip my hair out.
---
The story, the characters, the factions, the hundreds of ending permutations. The weight of your choices. From build to interactions. It all kept me coming back, time and again.
---
I enjoy 76. I'm in no way bashing it, but it's as shallow as a teaspoon in its current state. If the only thing keeping you coming back is the vague and elusive promise of RNG loot. Well, even its diehard defenders will get burnt out eventually.
---
Yes, it would be nice to actually visit the store in the game but I suspect it would also attract griefers, simply because it would be a popular spot where players may gather, easy pickings for griefers and players who "role play" as an a-hole, sorry meant to say raider.  
---
The store looks great as a place to visit, but it would have to be a separate location travelled to from the main map with a restriction on equipping weapons, as in not at all, I mean thinking about it, the Atom Store could be part of a social hub, with items on view, clothing on mannequins and small CAMP displays for relevant items.
---
The image of this meme popped straight into my brain space xD
---
Despite its bugs, it’s still a good game. Closer to fallout 4 with the camp building. There are (as many people have complained about) no human NPC’s, so all of the story is found by reading terminals, or listening to holotapes. From what I’ve experienced, other players do try to fill that gap. If you’re not into teaming up with other players, everything is can be done solo, except for maybe the “end game” boss. (But once that event starts, most people on the server will make their way down to help out.)
---
If you’ve enjoyed the other fallout games, and don’t mind a little bit of reading, you’ll enjoy this as well.
---
That was a refreshing read. I enjoyed your forward thinking suggestions and agree they would be a great way to enhance gameplay and community involvement as well. 👍🏼
---
Depends on the person I guess. Lots of times I will have the game open while I'm at work. Maybe check on workshops every 30 minutes or grab an event here and there. Doesn't mean I have those hours "played" but the game was open. Throw on happy camper and it's pretty easy to idle ingame.
---
Same and like the other person said if you leave and go back in it should be fine unfortunately I'm not sure if you or I  can use them yet
---
instigating handmade with 10% damage while aiming is best
---
A good idea
---
My wish is a text chat for console player
---
Super bloodied, adrenaline, full unyielding, everything
---
It would be great if garden plots were a thing, that you could directly interface with the plot to plant what you would want to grow.
---
Planting with limited space is a pain staking task of rotating and teying to avoid camp building mode errors.
---
No doubt, that sucks man!
---
I have x2 3\*\*\* western revolvers, I so want them to be viable.
---
Ooo, i had assumed it was like the Faschnaut parade event being here temporary. And thought what was being removed on the 7th of may was the event and quest all together.  I suppose I'll waste all my daily caps till i get both the imposter sheep mask and outfit.
---
I didn't connect on day one. Got all of them.. except the very first. -______-
---
Same. sucks.
---
Your right about New Vegas. It was an epic game. I played it till there was nothing left to do in it. It was also not a Bethesda game, but utilised the same engine as Fallout 3. It was what Fallout 4 could have been if given to a different games company. That's not to say Bethesda are a bad company, they just have different priorities.
---
Huh.  Yeah, you could.  You would have to stick to things that can be renamed to make it easy.  Players could pawn an item for a percentage of value, you rename it to player name and date of pawn.  Store it.  
---
Player wants it back and pays X amount above pawn payout and gets it back.  
---
If they don’t, it goes on sale to others.  
---
You will eventually piss someone off, but that just adds to the RP factor.
---
I think they might have nurfed black titanium drops from mole miners
---
If anything, allow a player to build more than one camp.
---
I'm pretty sure the likeness means that the letters are in the correct spot. It's been like that since Fallout 3. I think you encountered a bug, I can't remember ever seeing this happen.
---
Would it not just be easier to let us break down a perk card? So if I have a lvl 3 slugger, I could just choose to use 2 lvls instead? Sure would help us clean up the huge mess of perk cards and all these crappy duplicates. Also why cant we do the same for lock pick and hacker? Would be nice to combine all 3 into one card.
---
Just keep pressing the sort key...
---
It’s an award for Easter, calm yourself. They just added the badass paint for the excavator armor recently if you want something more post-apocalyptic
---
The Whitespring Resort is pretty much a hub with its vendors and neutral mobs.
---
Yeah. Obsidian's rep for world building and narrative are pretty legendary at this point.
---
To say I was somewhat upset with the railroading in Fallout 4 would be an understatement.
---
How did we go from a series where I get unique dialogue based on stats such as being a science boffin, being a complete dribbling moron etc, to a game where you can't even say no to NPC's.
---
In the past week I've joined in 5 nukes 2 in whitespring, 2 where the queen scorchbeast is at 1 in morgantown about 25 high radiation fluids in total. I've never gotten radiation fluid before update so I don't know how it was before
---
Sheepsquatch gave me a drill last night, so there's that.
---
Yeah same, was doing the burrows and I had latencies burst out of the blue
---
I have definitely seen this a few times, you go to loot it and the body just disappears, maybe it fell through the world, maybe it flew into space at 7 thousand miles an hour, maybe the game just runs corpse cleanup on it too fast, but it's definitely happening, and I'm pretty sure this is new since the last patch
---
before you used to get at least 50+ plus doing white springs and next to none harden mass now it's the other way around
---
No, would be a cluster fuck to an already established cluster fuck.
---
Rng to have a good build? Fuck that
---
Funny you mention this, recently started to notice stuttering and floor flickering
---
Another thing we noticed was the ground/grass would turn a bright pink/purple randomly for a few minutes then stop, at first we thought this was an Alien encounter, but eh...I don't think so lol
---
Is this different from another item? In the Atomic Shop it says;
---
"Log in each day and collect all 6 Deathclaw Easter Egg decorations to receive a free, limited time item on the seventh day!"
---
Did they give the cosmetic item without needing to claim it on the 7th day or is there going to be another item?
---
Or is the bunny mask going to a paid item, that is free only because of the 6 other eggs?
---
I'm confused.
---
Its been brought up before, the dev also responded to it but yes, this is a really good idea
---
Low level mobs spawn when a low level player enter the area.  The legendary system is meh, we all know that. Thats why beth introduced the legendary vendor, somewhere in may
---
No. This game is already too easy and being made easier with every suggestion.
---
I mean, they did say that the reward item would be a available in the shop on the 7th day if you got all the eggs, they never mentioned you could just craft it afterwards. So maybe the outfit will be in the store tonight and the head was just a bonus little thing
---
Wanted to buy this game when it was announced. But waited and glad I did.  Turned into such a sh!t show.  Sad how they lied about it before launch from what it actually is.  Sucks.
---
Wait, what were we talking about again?
---
It's a hat. A giant rabbit, hat.
---
???
---
Only way to get anything good is to buy it. Those crappy legendaries just provide you caps to buy the good stuff that was probably duped at one point anyway.
---
There's a lot more locations than printed on that map. Many are not the ones that pop up as discovered but are still worth finding. 
---
I think most of us have visited all the marked locations.
---
Normal firearm based TSE's - Yes.  
---
Energy/Plasma based weapons - No.
---
Hey dude, as a quick FYI you can farm the materials to make stims very easily. You just need butchers bounty level 3, then just go the lumberyard and kill all the ticks there, then move on to the moonshiner shack just north of it and do the same. Make sure you loot the tick fully, then press the search again button for more loot. Just server hop after clearing both places and repeat. In like ~20 minutes of that you could get like 60 stims
---
Ah ok thanks I just read a comment on another post a while back saying you can’t get them anymore, I was wondering wether you could for quite a while...
---
No, the air system shut off and anyone inside would suffocate and die. It is said on one of the computers in the vault. Vault 76 was designed to not let anybody inside.
---
... with one fecking ear too.
---
So it's Tab-T-1 for lockpicking, Tab-T-2 for rifleman, etc.?  I could probably use 10 of them
---
It's called a cupola.
---
May
---
I think this might be the best place I can think of. Nuke the airport in Morgantown and then just outside the fences of it and going towards the train yard you’ll find a bunch of cobalt
---
Add drill and syringer do not need to be in the legendary drop pool and we will all be far better off.  Not that i would mind an explosive drill for the fun i could have with it, but without the legendary effects, it should not be in the loot pool.
---
Im using one at PC and imo its pretty good
---
The answer to this is. Do what you want.
---
It's worth it if YOU think it is. It's not if you don't. Kinda a self answered question, lol.
---
Damn, all at once or are they shafting the road map completely
---
I am guessing you didnt read anything when you were exiting the vault?  It explains why you won't be able to re enter the vault once everyone leaves.
---
 Player hubs will be absolutely pointless without some kind of text chat.
---
 It will be a area full of mic-less people trying to communicate through 5 dumb emotes.
---
Nice landing!
---
Shotguns that are explosive can be a little tricky as you put yourself down if you aren’t careful so you need skeetshooter to tighten the blast and fireproof to shield yourself from getting killed as well as the three shotgun perks. It’s fun having an overpowered weapon but it’s situational.
---
If they had gambling in-game then Fallout 76 would just become Blackjack Simulator for me.
---
&gt;Do they need to code the whole game from scratch to tweak it ?
---
It's not so much the code, it's the balance.  Make a mistake fiddling too much with loot tables, and you could end up regularly dropping something that was meant to be super rare - suddenly everyone farms the heck out of it before you get a chance to fix it, and by then the item's intended rarity is blown.
---
And then they insist it's not a bug, but a feature!
---
Reminds me of the Silent Hill 3 mascot.
---
wow
---
 Nope
---
Wow that video needs editing. Two settings changed.
---
People will probably get triggered over this.
---
I also get the grass changing. For a while i thought it's my video card. Here's hoping the next patch will fix all this
---
For xbox, if the game has not crashed, search by xbox user name of someone  who was on your last server and hit "join game" from the home button menu.  As long as the server is not full you will join the last server you were on. Do not do it from the in game fallout 76 menus, only the home button one.
---
I also think that having some sort of non-combat hub would be nice since there isn't a way that you can actually pause the game.
---
I grew up with my dad singing 16 tons so I know the lyrics by heart.  I like to wander around the wastes now belting it out.
---
My roommate and I have encountered this problem multiple times a week. Super annoying.
---
Bit of a crap comment... The guys asking for advice whether or not it's worth spending time altering his build to a particular weapon and the best way to figure out uf its worth it or not is to gauge other peoples responses.
---
In response to the original OP, I find the AAE Combat Shotgun better than the Pump action, the reload time for the pump irritates me, however the AAE prefixe on any weapon will still make it one of the best weapons in game currently and well worth investing time in.
---
I didn't read any terminal entries or notes if that's what you mean. I tried to the first couple times, but I kept getting disconnected from the server halfway through reading and had to recreate my character like 3 times, so when on third time, I just went straight for the exit so it would autosave on my way out.
---
There’s always gotta be thy one.... congrats... that’s you!
---
Yeah, I hear your argument but it’s still shitty.
---
I see so many of these complaints from people who are just doing legendary farming wrong. 
---
If you want constant legendary spawns at high levels, go to high level spawn areas. Yes, you'll get a lot of crap drops in the process but that's just RNG. Why would getting a god roll weapon matter if everything dropped them?
---
Go north of kmax, keep walking up the road and kill every spawn you see til you reach death claw island. You'll hit at least 20-30 legendaries over the couple of hours and at least one will likely be a good 3* drop. 
---
This isn't fo4 where you can just cheatmod into godmode day 1, you're going to have to put in the work.
---
The drop rate is pretty low but still possible with a lot of legendary grinding. Whitespirngs and Westtek are your best options in my opinion.
---
I got 20+ high radiation fluids the other day at a nuked Harper's Ferry.
---
Burrows and Enclave event certainly helped with that.
---
I'm going to repost your information on another group to get the word out. Thanks for the info
---
They were a very rare drop to begin with and as far as I'm aware the drop rate for tse and aae have been lowered even more.
---
might have to try that out also thanks
---
Its happened to me about 12 times now.  Its not me dropping or selling the item, it literally just vanishes.  A few times it has happened just due to server hopping.  I hold the legendary power fist in my hand, server hop, and find it missing on the new server.  The most recent time for me was this past saturday.
---
Customisation.
---
More "Layers" means more options. 
---
I can use an outfit but no armour, so nobody can tell.
---
I can not wear an outfit, to show off my armour paints.
---
Or I can run around half naked.
---
It's not a "Technical Limitation," it's about increasing player options.
---
Are quantum grenades still broken?
---
Crap comment meet with a crap comment. I don't think I needed you to tell me that I was not the most helpful, as ultimately no matter what is said. One the info is out there and two .. it is up to him. If he finds it worth it .. do it. If not .. don't. Pretty sound  advice to me weather you like it or not.
---
What bothersome if you felt the need to white knight then answer, vs just answer him. In the future just ignore post you feel you need to knight on and just pay attention to the OP. You're not doing anyone any favors.
---
Coming from someone who's been banned since January . Had tried support tickets, emails, calling,ect. You are eating your time. And if your shell out more money on another account your just letting Bethesda make you thier bitch
---
Should start putting money into a new engine then.
---
Have you Frye’s uninstalling the game and starting from scratch... sounds like something is corrupt in the files.
---
Not asking for a god roll, just normal Legendary weapon with a cool effect
---
Always inspect before buying
---
Oh you want to rebuild your turrets for defense? Sorry— not enough fruit!
---
Heed your own advice, don't feel the need to comment when your not doing anyone any favours.
---
I've had All Rise since December. Logged in yesterday and it wasn't there anymore.
---
Yeah people like to feel they are sticking up for people here, boost their ego. Ignore him, the answer you gave was fine.
---
Gonna try.
---
Yeah, you can still get TSE's in game, just no Energy or Plasma based TSE's unfortunately.   
---
*^("May RNGesus be forever in your favour")*
---
I'd like to be able to craft explosive bolts for the crossbow.
---
Then you too, heed the advice, you continuing is not doing anyone any favors.
---
unless they untrack the event...
---
You can keep the eggs for your camp
---
Tennessee Ernie Ford has an amazing voice too
---
Agree and im sure they're aware of it, just gotta wait it out until the change gets implemented. Right now i can't "repair all" cause my Decontamination Shower got destroyed by an unpleasant player (can't use the G word, cause i'll get removed. Im not gonna fix it until May 7 when the Pacifist Mode for CAMPS gets added.
---
Lol. Okay. Well a exterminators rolling pin is a normal legendary weapon with a normal legendary effect. 
---
If you're wanting one of the top 5 weapons with top 5 effects that's at least a "good" roll if not a god roll. 
---
I know it's annoying to get crap drops but hopefully the token legendary vendor makes the crap drops at least have more value.
---
All of the inventory sorting needs a serious overhaul. 
---
It should sort once when you flip into that mode and not resort every time you sell an item.
---
I'm not worried about it. he seems to be more concerned with me than with the OP.
---
Underrated comment
---
Shhhh... it’s taboo to suggest it’s unbalanced. The reddit game Posse will come and take your karma. 🙅🏽‍♂️
---
If you’re gonna build around it, you need to get a dense chestpiece or you are going to be blowing yourself up all the time.
---
Xbox has been doing this a lot lately. Very likely the servers.
---
Yet in every other fallout it was there. You could buy a slave in fallout 3, cherry i think her name was, ended up as one of your follower, in new vegas you could give Arcade Ganon as a slave to caesar, and in 4, well you became the slave master (if you wanted) of the nuka world slave.
---
I know people might be offended, but slavery is part of the fallout lore, and so why should it be absent of 76?
---
I havent really play the 1 and the 2, but im sure they would have slavery in those also.
---
No, go away
---
I dunno the point of fallout games is you leave the vault to try and service on the surface. Kind of defeats the purpose if you have a high tech home to work out of.
---
Because it “ just works”
---
Yeah that sucks I didn't even realize it was a rare drop because I got it after so little playing. Have you tried farming with an alt? I have done this to get plan drops with some success. Logically it makes no sense but sometimes when I'm trying for a specific plan I have better luck with an alt character.
---
I want 20 atoms every time somebody bitches about this
---
“Still”??!!   I bet less then 20% of the player base has tried it let alone completed it
---
Go to armor workbench - craft head wear - and there's your rabbit mask /hat.
---
I ended up using this fence Thank You for the tip I'm going to make a conduit railing when I have some time to kill
---
eggcellent
---
let us trade our useless cards for a reroll, as a level 141 trying to edit there build its really hard unless we nuke harpers ferry to farm(which i do anyways)
---
Haha cool, thanks for the info man
---
I'm over these threads. People making stuff up for attention or boredom. I'll believe it when I see proof of it, and it's not that hard to record. I'm sick of that line. I *thought* my PS4 was always recording the last 15 minutes, turns out it records up to an hour of what I'm doing! Now do you see why it shouldn't be so hard for even one person to have a single bit of video evidence? 850 hours in now. Not a single missing item.
---
That would be cool, if you could like, fill someone's camp budget with black deathclaw eggs, but they're
---
 atom shop items.
---
should up your record time to 60 minutes
---
I'm 32. Spent the first half of my night in a group of 17-24 year olds, screwing around our various camps around the white springs. Blowing our own bases up, naked party, and all kinds of shenanigans. They were nonstop active and obnoxious on the mics, which nust meant I wasn't pulling my out. Just emotes from this guy.
---
I eventually left..found a few guys...teamed up. After a few minutes I actually ran to go grab my mic. For these people were in their 30's and 40's. We had some nice talks, got a few quests done for the wendigo mount/mystery meat recipe, and was generally a much more focused group.
---
They felt vending wasn’t ready so they pushed it back a month.
---
It’s not that bad at all. It’s very enjoyable and there’s a lot to do.
---
You can, under floor decorations. Scroll left from the deathclaw statue
---
What does not make sense to me is that we can fast travel to 76, I get that we came from it. But it's completely sealed off and shut down, what is the purpose for being able to fast travel there? Not to mention it is on the left side of the map and not near anything very good.
---
Fast travel to me to some degree does not make the most sense, though since we don't have cars, I suppose the FT is a needed thing?
---
I do that with some cards as well. The problem is that only works for 3\* cards. The current system doesn't allow you to have one of each level for 5\* cards.
---
Damn too bad nukacrypt is a thing lol
---
This needs to be moved to the marketplace.
---
Agreed, but have 3 "Good doggy" cards ain't benefiting anyone.
---
Imo, Bethesda already turned their backs on what the Fallout series is all about by removing dialogue and choice. So they might as well just try to make 76 a good game in general because it'll never be a good Fallout game. At least not in my opinion, Fallout has always been (all the way back to Fallout 1) about tough, morally grey choices and about giving you the player free reign in how you approach your problems. This includes being able to use speech to talk people down and using skill checks.
---
Yeah the respawn rate of glowing ones down in the burrows can be crazy. As a stealth sniper who went down there easily when it was not nuked, I was caught off guard halfway through when everything behind me respawned after a short time at the work benches.
---
You forgot the Drill. The most useless and underrated of melee weapons D:.
---
I was looking last night and there was numerous warnings and GTs posted of scammers.
---
I only trade with caps but it certainly seems more rampant than previous weeks.
---
Also a fair few time wasters, Somebody agreed to sell me a TSE shotgun that when I joined he mysteriously didn’t have, Then two minutes later he’s advertising a TSE handmade that I assume he didn’t have. Strange guy !!
---
Putting my tiny shrine to shame lol
---
Mostly consists of the deathclaw figure on a black fancy table, potted plants on the side, with aarge scenic painting on the wall behind it for a backdrop.
---
Thats heavy, thanks for sharing :)
---
Mine often happen 5-10 minutes after take them out of my stash.
---
I'll have already FT'd somewhere, and the leg. will show up on my screen. It's much, much worse if you rapidly take 5-10.
---
Or they could just fix the sneak indicator to not disappear.
---
I got a level 40 bloodied 1star smg, even though im level 72. I don’t even pvp on this game...
---
Make love to me now
---
Yeah, allowing for PvP at a predestined market/trading hub would be pretty pointless too. Just throw in some shooting games for those with an itchy trigger finger.
---
It may be a pain, but just make a secondary character to go to those locations. Should work.
---
I think that the assault rifle is overshadowed by the Handmade because of the “more bang for your buck” in the sense of ammo
---
Maybe in the future we can get antiultracite suits so we can dive in their tunnels and get to locations fast but dangerous
---
I think your bitch tiddies just grew two sizes this day
---
Is this just PC? Never even realised you can do this if it applies to xbox!! So handy to know
---
Shields for 1H weapon users.
---
Unarmed weapons that work with power armour (even if its just the power glove).
---
That's what I keep saying about your mom but they keep disagreeing with me
---
You need to try find an instigating fireax or sledgehammer on a vendor or something,im level  129 rifle build and mele the ghouls always,they always come to close for my tse.
---
just the fact that it takes up half of the screen while showing the weapon or armor for the fifth time is really frustrating, and the sound stacks so everytime i’m moving legendaries and “take all” in a bag it does the loudest noise imaginable
---
PSA: Do not repair crops. Scrap them for 1 of the vegetable/fruit and 1 fertilizer, then replant it. No loss whatsoever.
---
Just looted a tse +1 perception handmade today.
---
We could have like parties such. Could get a text going to get all the wanderers hooked up that there's a party tonight in fact l vault 76. Everyone's welcome but no mean people, might need some super high level bouncers..
---
Bring chems as I like to be fucked up at all times. Will trade some firecracker berry juice or something.
---
I ended up using a mod that has better inventory sorting on PC so I can just sort by food and dump it all. But I completely agree with this.
---
People get triggered by absolutely anything.
---
Back when vending was first announced a friend of mine was buying up every Quantum he could to craft them and sell them. I tried convincing him no one would buy them but he was determined to sell them for 250 caps. Says he has over 100 now. As good as the unarmed increase is they're not practical. I think he'll be lucky to sell one to an unsuspecting noob.
---
Nice one
---
It is and its not. Its an explosive shotgun, and these are nice. But anti-armor reduces the DR value of your opponent, and explosive damage is not calculated against DR the way ballistic damage is. Unfortunately, it makes it worse than assassin/mutants explosive which at least give you something. AAE is a fluke. Its just as good as exterminators explosive, except when against mirelurk when its even worse.
---
Carefull with those glitches! Game is full of them and you get banned by accidentally finding them.
---
It's still annoying. Even more when it appears with a delay
---
What a debbie downer

When I collected the last egg (onyx) d
---
About half of the people shitposting on this stupid forum don't actually play the game.

Other suggestions listed are good, but I found the whitesprings golf course rather good as well.  There is a spot outside the clubhouse by the row of golf carts with about a dozen golf balls and the trashcan is full of plastic as well.  Go to the front of the club house, by the tennis course there is a truck with baskets in it, with golf balls all over the truck bed and in baskets.  Inside the golf club house are 2 on a shelf immediately to the left as you enter, another 2 in the case, run around the corner to the right and 2 down low in a case.  Run over to the pool table and then downstairs another couple.  Run down to the golf course south of there is a small shack, it is down the hill from the pool entrance, heading back towards Enclave back door, inside is another basket of about 6 golf balls and also 12 pencils(lead).  On the practice tee is another 9 golf balls.  Run down the course a bit, and at the putting greens are about 4 balls per green.  I usually make a run, various locations have golf balls on porches, in rooms, etc., and then hit those.   I get about 60-70 plus a run, while also killing the ghouls.
---
ok but they made a multiplayer fallout and focused on exploring the wasteland which they did incredibly well. Maybe you don't like what they did but you don't control or own what fallout is lol.
---
Sorry dude, wasnt intended for clickbait. was just the best image i could find at the time for the fasnacht masks which fitted my thumbnail style
---
I did try it once but there was tones of people
---
Speaking of PvP, I'd like it if they kept that to Survival. I haven't ever engaged in PvP in Adventure, but I sometimes see Wanted markers on the map, so I know that there are some people who troll other players. Other live service games keep PvP to a separate sector, so I feel like it makes sense for FO76. I dunno. That's just me.
---
Ha, I think it's funny tho. I hear the ghoul upstairs, start walking sneaky, hear him go ahhbblatteeephhf. Walk upstairs the thing is just laying there like it couldn't take it anymore and killed itself before I could. Poor thing, happens a lot.

There should be a damage difference. I don’t use a Gauss but I believe it’s ~50% damage for an unchanged shot, up to 100% at full charge

Legendary flare gun.... smashes screen
---
Its not hard to tweak. 
---
You can mod the loot tables for the other fallout/elder scrolls games in about 2 minutes. 
---
You just go to the loot list you want to edit, drag a new item into the list, or right click "delete" on current item in the list. Then save the esp/esm/esl file. 
---
It might be different for fo76.... but I really doubt.
---
The beta / launch struggle to just get your character made was real.
---
Level 156? Holy shit man! 
---
I haven't came across to many voices but I'm 35 and enjoy the heck out of the game. I do wish I could wander with someone  to talk to and have help but it's fun solo. 
---
Most who are still playing the game are fallout fans and enjoy the game for what it is.
---
^this
---
When I have a 10 cap bounty I go to Whitespring to have it cleared. After stashing everything except 400 steel because I'm boring like that.
---
If you’re using a targeting HUD or other mechanism to see enemies, try removing that and see if your stability improves. Known issue (at least on this reddit).
---
Whitesprings is pretty much the player hub now (lots of enemies for level grinding, many vendors, etc.) and Vault 76 was design to make itself uninhabitable 24 hours after opening by shutting down life support and venting out all breathable air specifically so the Dwellers would be forced to go out and try to rebuild America instead of staying cozy in the Vault. 
---
Turning Vault 76 into a player hub goes completely against its purpose in the lore.
---
Faschnact wasn't.
---
I love it what can I do for ya today oh done silver table knifes most I can do is a cap
---
That is more than true. Though it looks like the butthurt babies are already downvoting you.
---
Nothing new on 76 reddit.
---
No insignia on the arm with Officer
---
You unlock Easter Bunny Mascot Head
---
None of my friends play it. I often get requests from randoms to team up but 99% of players I've met don't have a mic and i don't really know what they wanna do
---
Awh really?
---
Wonder if you could build on top of the spot lol, love hearing fo76 stories!
---
Yeah I missed quite a few, and I also can’t find them while trying to place them in my camp
---
Yep, earlier today someone posted how it looks
---
Uh, really?
---
It's a pretty excellent quote.
---
Zero since I can't complete the quest since it bugged out after the sheepsquatch update
---
No... unfortunately
---
Damn I can't believe I missed a egg
---
I have mine displayed in camp, they are not easy to find in the menu.
---
You are literally salty over a game mechanic. It's pathetic.
---
HW also have a huge variety of weapons to play with. Your 50cal and Gatling gun will be your staple weapons, but there’s a ton more to toy with, and if you run Bear Arms you can carry 9 HW for the weight of 1 rifle. Add in the explosive HW (missile launcher etc) and ordinance express and you have a lot of choices and you can carry them all. I run T-60 with calibrated shocks, I sit about 30 under carry weight when I’m not hauling a ton of loot around, and I’m carrying 2 1h melee weapons, like 9 HW, a pistol with a recon scope, about a hundred grenades and mines of various types, about 4-5k of .308+50cal+5mm ammo, 10 mininukes, 100 40mm grenades, 40 missiles, 5-6 fusion cores, plus a random bit of other ammo. 
---
I run minimal aid items because I always run a surplus. Usually about 6 stim packs because with healing factor and a vampiric LMG, I rarely use them. I grab more stims and radaway for nuke zones or the sheepsquatch.
---
I believed it was in floor decor and cycle left to right where the bunny plush is
---
I think I'll be satisfied once they take out Camp damage. Not that I really see the point of PvP in Adventure mode, but at least you can opt out completely then... Though I guess I only say that cause I've never even seen it happen myself.
---
Or the deathclaw statue.  I cant remember
---
Indeed a master wordsmith!
---
Yeah me to,why not a egg shoot gun of somekind...just for fun ,these masks i dont care about
---
it def is, i am on the young side(still an adult) and most of the people i talk to are older. also a suprising amount of women in this game compared to others, game seems to be 1/4 women when other games its like 1/8 or 1/16
---
157 now. I play nearly every day for about an hour. Sometimes I just tweak my camp, other times I go to Harpers Ferry and kill everything to gather money and scrap. I still have a few missions to do, not many though. It doesn't matter that much to me, I just enjoy the game. I'm on PS4. You?
---
It would also be nice to get empty beer bottles from drinking beer.... you know.... for cocktails.
---
Free fast travel is necessary for at least one location. It's an anti-stuck mechanism. No matter how many mechanisms they put in place to detect if you're stuck and try to dislodge you, fast travel is the most effective method. A free one just ensures that you always have this option available, even if broke.
---
There are a lot of people who says that the eggs didnt show up in atomic shop for them. It is lossible that there was a bug go stg.
---
All types play, as it's not a traditional shooting or RPG game. It sits kind of on its own.
---
Sad face. I meant the costume though haha
---
Death claw statue section.
---
this is some cool pasta. not only that the word power gamer is hilarious
---
Look it doesn't matter anyway. I personally find it quite challenging but that's fine. The problem is there's nothing in between. The game's either way too easy or in this case only beatable with certain tactics or friends who know what they're doing.
---
Everyone in survival will have at least 1% rads to negate Instigating weapons.
---
Am I missing something here? I logged in every day to collect mine and only have 5 now?
---
Hmmm, that sounds familiar...
---
 You should play the lottery with that kinda luck
---
Dont focus on this 'very young' business, thats only one scenario, and a whale can be anything, their existence and their 'share' of the total money spent is the staggering takeaway, and the other poster saying its kids with parent's credit cards is only his guess. Whether young or old it's the fact that a small percentage of players are handing over tens of thousasnds of dollars to microtransactions in a single game on the regular, making microtransactions with whales the actual business model. The intuitive old-school model is surprisingly irrelevant as these companies know where the cash cow is and they cater to those whales as the PRIMARY source of revenue.
---
I couldnt agree more!
---
I still hope we don't get any human NPC's per Bethesda promise. I'm happy with robots, mutants and maybe ghouls.
---
Same issue on PC - had me checking task manager a few times to see what was causing it but only fo76 hogging ram and disc.
---
Yes, ticks drop tick blood sacs (which scrap into antiseptic), and tick blood. Blood packs require antiseptic and tick blood to craft, and then stimpaks require blood packs and antiseptic. So farming ticks is all you need to get the required materials (minus the tiny amount of steel you need). 
---
They drop the blood sac more often compared to the tick blood, so butcher’s bounty help a lot, because when your search the body again, I think it will *only* give you tick blood if the second search is successful. Meaning almost every tick you search will give you both antiseptic and tick blood. Very convenient!
---
Me too.
---
Could not a "/unstuck" command be added to fix that single issue? Most online games that that command. Fast travel to just get out of being stuck seems like a bit excessive just for a unstuck feature.
---
Since it’s an item we already bought I doubt they will add more to it
---
thats an absurd exaggeration. all my friends sibilings are the oppisite, hell look at r/teenagers
---
There's no suit, but if you have the sheepsquatch outfit it's close enough to match.
---
I see the merit in it but it doesn't fit in that it was intended to never reopen again, unlike many Vaults which have continued almost two centuries after they were sealed. 
---
I agree that the Whitespring has become a player hub in the absence of one being made for us, like a lot of things that have been lacking, players have kind of created them themselves. How Bethesda works with that, remains to be seen.
---
I play every day and I'm pretty sure they have been making a lot of server side changes (no client update needed) I say this as the amount of legendary creatures that spawn seems to be changing and so do their drops. Enemies in the game have also gotten a bit tanker in the last week or so. 
---
I think they are listening folks. I think it is just something that is a bit more complicated to fix than some other things. They seem to be trying to rebalance the game in total rather than just focusing on one thing. I have no concrete evidence on this other than my experience in playing the game waaaay to much. 
---
Having said that they fixed the repair on the armour bench but not the weapons bench which seems very odd. Also mods found in the world still don't seem to be fully working weeks after the patch thag broke them came out.
---
I'm a bit more concerned about the lowballing or reduction in prices of a lot of things in the trading subs. I think there are a few ebayers out there possibly driving prices down or attempting to grab things cheap to resell. Again just my experience in looking at other peoples posts. I know stuff fluctuates but geez. Do you know how hard it is to even find a decent 2* legendary drop, let alone a 3* nowadays.
---
umm do you know if they were in your inventory or stash because rn pretty much all my PA is in my stash (i had to restart my character from level 50 cause her damage out put was sad, so all my shit is like 45-50 and although i cant use it right now i'd still like to keep it)
---
When did they ever "promise" never to add human npcs?
---
Why are you farming the queen?
---
Just player vending
---
Yeah, I'm getting it a bunch lately too over the last couple of days. Most often when going into the Pip-Boy or the map. Super annoying.
---
&gt; Go north of kmax, keep walking up the road and kill every spawn you see til you reach death claw island. You'll hit at least 20-30 legendaries over the couple of hours and at least one will likely be a good 3* drop.
---
OP was asking for high level legendaries, and you tell him to farm them in the Forest? Cranberry Bog / Mire / Whitesprings are where you go for &gt;lvl40 loot. Yeah, events can be lower level, but if you tour the usual hotspots (WS, WT, NAS, Steakhouse, EMS, and everything in between) you should get consistent high level drops.
---
You still need to roll the dice a lot for good to god rolls, though, but I'm almost always getting okay legendary weapons from a simple Whitesprings run. Easy way to turn the stakes in your favor: server hop at the WS Service Entrance until the game either drops you into a blast zone or (better) the flora is still nuked, but the blast zone is over, only then start your WS round.
---
You need to follow the line slightly further south
---
It would be hilarious if BGS made it so "as long as your hp is full" then boom. Which means no amount of rad damage would protect you .. only having less than your full hp at the time.
---
Even before launch and afterward. It is same old question over and over again for them and answer was always same - no human NPC's, all humans are players.
---
Honestly I've never played pvp but instigating weapons are probably completely useless. Like when was the last time you had full health?
---
Where and how can you get this quest?
---
Kmax is right above Robco and Steakhouse, heading north towards Dyer Chemical and Power Station. 
---
WS has had diminished results lately, as has Watoga. Still getting strong, consistent legendary spawns in the Mire.
---
What you say would he true for a different RPG, but not this one. There are so many levels in this game that you don't lose anything by opting to get lockpick all the way up right away, because it only costs you can hour if time at low levels. Plus you will he getting it anyways.
---
That's what I'm saying though. Lots of games have an unstuck command, but they do have conditions which they fail. Just last week playing Warframe, I was being pulled by a water current into an unplayable area (and reset to the playable area). The reset location however was still inside the water current, so whenever I had escaped the reset black screen, I would have gotten stuck in the current again. The unstuck command in the game reset me to the same spot that the default out of area reset did, keeping me stuck regardless. This kind of thing can happen in any game, and is infinitely more likely in open world games like fallout.
---
Holy gosh you seem set! The only weight reduction perks I have is just travelling pharmacy because I started to carry 200 stimpaks around when the sheepsquatch event was the big thing. I'd say I'm happy with the 50. cal I've got, they're really good, and for my Gatling gun it's also pretty good but the spread is down right terrible, can't seem to hit a mirelurk spawn when far away or right up and personal.
---
I'm guessing to points of Perception can go into Strength for some of the heavy reduction perks, since in luck I can replace Mysterious saviour with One Man army, and I also need to cut down on the amount of stimpaks I have, but not completely clear it out, since the only High rate of fire Vampiric weapon I've got is a Auto Tesla Rifle.
---
Though I need to find a way if I can keep what I have in Intelligence, but also add power user, since it also increases the mag size on the gatling laser, and I just need more fusion cores in general XD
---
That's good to know thanks , now just to get my hands on one .
---
I am asking when did they explicitly say "We promise to never add human NPC's" because to my knowledge they NEVER did. Which means, human npcs could make it in.
---
They also said "No micro transactions and only cosmetics" for the atom shop yet .. repair kits and an increased rate of degradation of weapon and armor.
---
Lol and ?
---
10mm pistol anyone? I'm level 31 and the pipe revolver is still my go-to weapon. I flipping hate pipe weaponry.
---
Same, game had always run fine before, but plenty of stuttering and occasional frame rate drops now.
---
and faschnact was specifically mentioned to be a limited time thing where nothing else was
---
The game required a restart to refresh the Atomic Shop. There's been numerous post about this all week explaining it.
---
If our characters can build a nuclear reactor to power their camp, motion activated turrets, and build power armor, I think they can salvage some parts from the mine air systems and fix that
---
Instigating weapons are not helpful in PVP.
---
It’s not for the sake of change, it’s for improvement.
---
I don't want any human NCPs. I think the online part of it ads all the humans we need. 
---
And I don't miss Preston garveys ass either.
---
Nope, hopefully there will be soon.  I would live a flat ceiling for one.
---
Ill take it into account thanks!
---
I have one of those inside my house.
---
I've definitely been using more stimpacks in the last week or so, so I think you're right about being "tankier."
---
Thanks!!!
---
Where do you get that clown mask? Neat.
---
The hat was unlocked when you got the 6th one but the adds for it stated on the 7th day will get something new. So I think there is something else as well.
---
So they took a bag that's not theirs. I killed them all destroyed their shit because they stored it. I didint claim to be great or cool. I caught a thief out of passive mode and destroyed his stuff for stealing mine. Anyone else want to defend the idiot who knew he was taking somthing that didint belong to him and knew there could be consequences? Any more lame arguments or salty comments?
---
Good to know... you wonder sometimes if it's just you but there does seem to be a trend. My friends think similar as well
---
Wouldn't be surprised if they added charisma perk cards for interacting with human NPCs.
---
Mothman photo frame is a limited time item that pops up from time to time.

I think me and him both got ours from one of the cells in Fort Defiance.

The six ranks of Science do what the three levels if Armorer already do. Let's look:
---
Armorer:
---
-You can now craft advanced armor mods
---
-Crafting armor now costs fewer materials
---
-Crafted armor now has increased durability
---
Note that some armor mods require Armorer rank 2 or 3. Simply having Armorer rank 1 will not allow you to make every armor mod.
---
Now look at science:
---
-You can now craft energy weapons
---
-You can craft rank 1 energy weapon mods
---
-You can now craft rank 2 energy weapon mods
---
-Energy weapons now cost fewer materials to craft
---
-You can craft rank 3 energy weapon mods
---
-Your crafted energy weapons have improved durability.
---
So there are only three different effects for six ranks if science: Crafting higher ranked mods, fewer materials, and improved durability. This is exactly the same as Armorer, but is six ranks and three cards instead of three ranks on one card.
---
Absolutely. Now i need the Stimpak Blueprint lol
---
WHERE DO I OBTAIN IT, BRÖTHER, ATOM SHOP?
---
Not sure why you’re being downvoted. It’s the same as anywhere. I’ve traded from Xbox LFG wince the beginning and have had no issues. Same with on the reddit market subs. As long as you’re cautious and smart about it, you’ll have no problems.
---
Automatic Grenade launcher's heavy barrel still does not give it the damage increase that it states
---
My quest also disappeared after the sheepsquatch update
---
Pretty annoying Tbh hopefully it's fixed soon
---
People on here would rather insult others and defend a soulless corporatation than relive repressed memories of how bad the bugs and glitches were and are in this game.
---
Oh, ok. I appreciate the clarification.  I was having trouble with the idea that kids were somehow outspending 30-60 year olds who may have tons of disposable income.
---
Maybe tomorrow
---
Can confirm. Ran into him there yesterday. Bought the clock plans and a clean version of the ranger's hat
---
Down votes give me nourishment
---
And the handheld Camera. Was due out in April, but moved back a week.
---
Eh that's the pvp part you initiate with your own free will. You don't have to. I mean you die you die. Plenty of workshops to go around and I haven't been attacked by another player yet. Ps4.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
&gt; I have "change POV" mapped to clicking the mouse wheel, so that's not it.
---
I'm not on the PC... PS4 player here.  But the default key for editing CAMP and Changing POV is the same on PS4.  Just hold longer for Editing menu.  Tap to switch between 3rd/1st, hold to open Build/Edit menu.
---
Dont have that much money
---
Also idk about you but Im on PS4
---
Just leave the door open
---
Could we... just leave the doors open? Maybe build a secendary ventilation system? I mean, we can craft decontamination arches, fusion generators, power armor, mini-fucking-nukes, you get the idea. I think we could manage it.
---
I got mine at the spawn point to the right of Cranberry Glade. Both there and the glade itself can spawn tameable Kings, so it’s one of the better areas to check.
---
They are exceptionally rare though. I’ve been trying to get another since a player killed mine, but no dice.
---
Yeah, I've never had my camp damaged personally, but I've heard other people mentioning it happen to them. That's part of why I keep my camp pretty basic.
---
Go to your armor crafting station
---
Just a bunch of random items put together. The deathclaw statue and black eggs are in the atomic shop, so is the stand it is on. The plants I have no clue got them from a tool box.  
---
the frame is a limited time item from the atomic shop that is no longer available
---
That’s very cool
---
Play a game of cornhole?
---
Yeah but you'll still get banned for it
---
Okay, um, condoms are a must. The safe word is sea cucumber.
---
Reward is in your crafting menu at the Armor Bench.
---
It happened a lot to me when I ran around Watoga
---
I use 100% Power Armor build Shotgunner. I feel you should drop the strength perk that allows you to sprint in PA and the other solo perk. 3 blocker is a must IMO as it’s the best mitigation perk in the game.  If you’re going with explosive weapons, demo expert is clutch.  I don’t recommend power user or power smith.  I don’t recommend vats in PA, and if you’re not using Vats cores last for hours.  The durability of power armor is also insane.  I repair mine once a month without the durability perk on.  It’s definitely not as crucial as white knight is for normal armor.  I don’t know much about heavy gunner perks, just giving you an opinion from an experienced shotgunner PA user.
---
I wonder if future purchase options will come out of those as a DLC option ... different primary mission, expanded character slots, etc.
---
You are not the first person to suggest this and you won’t be the last.
---
Report them all as Bethesda Plz posts. This is the 4th post I’ve seen of people requesting that these posts stop, and it’s always a mod issue. The most I can do is report the posts. But I agree with you, it’s annoying.
---
Easy and COOLEST way to do it: 
---
Do it like people did in the 50's-90's. Osaka stadium built a model town in a baseball stadium for people to visit and pick a house and furniture. Model towns used to be common for this. 
---

---
So I just like, throw corn at things?
---
Now if only I could fast travel straight into the resort, rather than the door outside, then entering, for two lengthy ass loading screens.
---
I'll be on later this afternoon. I'll give it a shot.
---
Yup, I'm guilty of fast traveling way too much already, if they added even more free fast travel points I'd never walk anywhere.
---
Me too. I feel dumb.
---
To be fair .. warframe for as old as it is. Is at least not marketed as a complete 60$'s game and still considers itself in it's beta phase, even if players don't. Which means like how you mentioned .. the unstuck feature bugs out, I've had it happen in WF too. Though in that game fast travel is also a thing for vendors in the open world and that works 100% of the time, lol. Due to the small enclosed space the npcs are in.
---
Fast travel to your home base I can understand to get unstuck, but to a closed down, out of order vault. No. It's also not exclusively used for when people are stuck with further pulls it away from being a unstuck feature and more a QOL thing.
---
But I get where you're coming from .. it's a necessity for unstuck, though I still think there are better ways to go about it without the need to use a travel system as such.
---
I'm headed to Cobbleton farm at the moment so worst comes to worse I can make an insane amount of whiskey
---
Are they all the same because I think I've ran into this glitch before on accident.
---
I still fast travel everywhere.used vendor run for travel money
---
I have 3 snallygaster right outside my camp.they each give me 5 acid.
---
Player vending: May 7th  
---
Handheld Camera: 23rd April.
---
You can get it in the science wing of the whitesprings bunker, don’t remember how much it costs though
---
Is that a report option?
---
Yes, I use it all the time for those posts.
---
Hello! Thank you for your response. I was wondering if there were any new developments on this :)
---
That'd be nice.
---
Cool i will start doing that too
---
I was wearing my PA. Started walking and was like how TF am I over encumbered? Then I saw I was missing pieces from my suit. The first time it was when server hopping. To find a nuked Burrows.
---
The second time I just did Uranium fever and I was heading deeper into the mine to farm a little more Black Titanium. I did scrap the weapons I received after the event to get steel but this happened about 40 seconds after I left the bench and I only scrapped weapons. 
---
I was running then I was suddenly really slow because I lost my extra carry weight because my leg was missing. If I was able to run I doubt I scrapped the piece at the bench. I also did not pick up anything after leaving the bench.
---
But again I'm not going to rule out user error who knows I could've messed up or it's a bug. I hope it doesn't happen again but if it does I'll make sure I have video.
---
I've been playing every day and it's only offered two so far. Totally feeling ripped off. (And yes, I log out and/or go to the bottom of the atomic shop to look for it)
---
Bad Easter Deathclaw, bad!
---
Are you trying to apply it to the right type of armour?
---
Upvote
---
Log out or close your app and restart completely. Cause that's what you needed to do. And that was mentioned by myself and many others, repeatedly.
---
Human NPC's would be a problem, imagine if you had to turn in a quest but had to talk to a certain NPC. Going by how vendors work you would have to wait till the player currently talking to the NPC finishes, that is if they do and don't go afk like a lot of people do at vendors.
---
Unlimited spoiled food!
---
What you said doesn’t disprove his point. If anything you reenforced it. You’re right fallout is now a multiplayer exploration game. So why go through a change like that and half ass it instead of full out wholesale change? Might as well make the QoL changes that make it a better game regardless of how untraditional it is. Bethesda obviously plays fast and loose with tradition anyway.
---
Ok so all the vaults were pretty much experiments. They were meant to save humanity in a sense, they were meant to record social experiments within the vaults or some other purposes. Vault 22, plant life. Vault 111, cryotechnology, Vault 8, it was meant to open after 10 years for recolonization efforts. Vault 76 like vault 8 except it’s 25 years instead. And of course the infamous 87 with its FEV experiments. There are many other vaults if you’re interested in researching them.
---
i'll leave it in my stash and see if it does anything thank you
---
Plot twist
---
Welcome to maturity!
---
The game is bugged. Cannot apply mods (the wooden box ones from vendors) since last patch
---
Wait until tomorrows patch. Mods are currently broken.
---
This happened to me at uranium fever as well. I'm going to try and replicate it there.
---
Then the vault won't be safe.
---
Pretty sure they said multiple times "there will be no human NPC's", so still a promise. Of course Todd never raised his hand and never told that it's a promise...
---
They also didn't add the repair kits yet.
---
I like the idea though. You could code it so that once you've done the Charlestown intro stuff you can go back into a hub.
---
Well, that is lackluster to say the least. Thanks for sharing.
---
Start leaving bags of corn at peoples houses you find, lol
---
Every man, woman, etc. and their dog in Survival will be running Rank 3 Fireproof. Those out of PA will be using dense mods in their armour to further reduce the damage. I've hit people with 700-1000 direct hit and it never reached more than a 1/3 of the hp bar.
---
Looks like you’re on PS4. I always create a PlayStation chat party. That way disconnects are thebgame only and you can continue to speak to one another.
---
I agree with you and feel sorry for you - all the downvoting you will get, just because people can't get over it...
---
Yes, thank you. People are say its broke at the moment.
---
At least it gives me time to throw on the kettle I guess. Coffee break while I wait to offload my trash. 😅
---
My weak attempt at a silver lining.
---
Thank yoy
---
Thanks to the helpful (and unhelpful) comments, I was able to sort out the WONKY interface for perk cards.
---
So one revelation was that when my perk packs came in, that 'rank up' versions of same were the wasteful ones, not vice versa.
---
And all it took was a few wendigos and a scorchbeast to get my gunsmith up high enough to start cranking out handmade guns. Of course while doing this I finally get a decent legendary drop, a two shot .308 that does 100 damage. 
---
Now if I rank up my gun nut in the same fashion, that sucker will pump out some stopping power.
---
Damage Mitigation (Cavalier probably, since you will be running up to things to try to hit them) and AP Refresh, with +1 STR.
---
So that’s where Space Mom went
---
I have been selling anything under level 40. I don't have the stash space.
---
I have to say rarely do I see camps that sink away into the background as well as this does from the outside.  I honestly thought at first you just plopped your CAMP module down on an exisiting warehouse and put down all your furnishings.  Well done.
---
When Server hopping plan locations, each spawn will reset in 20 hours, but if you do not pick up the plan, you can server hop and find a different Item.
---
There are several locations that seem to spawn the rare Armor Mod plans more frequently, and some of these also include random weapons in the table, so remember, if you see something you don't need, just server hop for another chance, but once you pick up the item at that location, you won't see another for 20 hours.
---
Now he and his group will downvote you into oblivion too XD. Made me laugh though, lol.
---
im level 24
---
I was hoping for baby deathclaws.  Damn it!!
---
I personally just sell my one stars to vendors, unless it's something nice like a anti armor handmade or something.
---
 I'll hold on to 2-3 stars though, either to sell to other players or hopefully to make use for when the legendary vendor comes to town.
---

---
Is my normal build. Max damage setup. I swap perks around a ton, situationally, though. I’m on PC so perk loadout Manager is mandatory! 
---
I noticed a new change recently though that is pissing me off no end, I need to post about it separately actually. I may have to start running starched genes permanently, because I’ve been getting new mutations even in power armor, which never used to happen before since I never take 5+ radiation damage (which used to be the threshold for mutating).
---
I don’t use the energy heavies much at all, because they don’t currently benefit from any armor piercing effects (armor piercing effects only affect DR, not ER). 
---
I’m on the fence about more stims for the sheepsquatch. Because if you die during the event you respawn literally right at it, I’m inclined to say just stash all your junk, just take the death and respawn. It’s minimal downtime and way less chem usage. Unless you’re trying to tank the squatch, and thus want to maintain its attention, like I do now :)
---
I was in a group this past weekend and the SQB was nice and stayed on the ground for us. We chipped away at her here and were able to kill her with about 8 mins left.  I did take some bufftats to help during the fight but working on saving caps to buy a couple of serum recipes. 
---
Thanks everybody for all of your help
---
You assume incorrectly that people look to Reddit for every solution. The info is appreciated, your choice to imply that people are doing it wrong becasue we aren't scouring this sub every day is on the shitty side. Good day, sir.
---
You can still be a conduit if you're downed. The best strategy I've seen so far is to sprint and grab all the conduits with one player then hop on the roof. Up there you can safely spam super stims to keep yourself alive or avoid getting killed when you're downed. Have high damage players lay in to the Imposter, it can be killed fairly easily with that strategy. I'd also recommend shooting at its legs, it has less armor there
---
You should let people know what platform you're on.
---
I trade on the LFG daily and don’t have issues. You just need to be mindful and and if it seems to good to be true it normally is. If you’re trading items - always make them go first or trade for caps- make them put the item up for caps and you buy it and then put your item up for caps and they can buy it - trade done.
---
I think the only thing I would avoid altogether is junk trading until they make it so camps cannot be destroyed as players will often “wtb junk” wait until you have it and attempt to murder you for it by destroying part of your base.
---
Not sure if it was a bug for me or if it’s a feature but proceeding with the repair all function has repaired as much as it can for me in the past and recently so hopefully you can repair what you need to without having to pull up broken crops
---
"Yet" but they already increased the rate of items degrading, announced them and will be rolling them out. Thus one promise they did make is on it's way out the door.
---
Now, even if it was said multiple times before launch. That there would be no human npcs. They never said there would NEVER be human npcs, so too that point. We can say we don't know dick and are just speculating, though they never promised no human npcs, so that in and of itself was misleading.
---
Bad part is, if you take one legendary out of your Stash, you get a pop up of _every_ legendary you have that matches that type.  I notice it all the time when I store/retrieve the legendary heavy combat pieces I get from Tech Data turn ins.
---
Store that Exterminators Heavy Left Leg, retrieve it, get a pop up for it, then also my Troubleshooter's 3* Heavy Left Leg I have equiped.  Same with chest pieces, etc.
---
Was annoying when I was holding onto 3 pieces of Heavy Combat Chest (3* and 2* versions) and would get take a single one out of my Stash.  Would get notifications pop up for all 4 pieces, and they would reset their "I need to display" if I interrupted them with bench interactions, causing them to pop up again and again if I did not let it complete 100% before interrupting it again.
---

Wish it was that simple for me. I have a ton of razorgrain stacked inside eachother. It's easier to repair a couple, harvest and repair because getting them that way again is a pain. Only really lose fertilizer from that.
---
Congrats! Technical data can be a pain but definitely rewarding!
---
Probably this. OP needs to just hold down the mouse wheel.
---
Alternatively, go to the actual CAMP object and interact with it.
---
Im assuming everyone got the same reward? Id say what i got but i dont wana spoil it for others
---
I think this is fixed I repaired my camp w/o needing the damaged crops it just fixed what I had that mats for and next time I clicked repair all it only showed my crops
---
We always have a friend in PA take all the pylons, someone focuses on the adds, and the rest of us takes out the imposter.
---
You're not allowed to both LIKE the game and be  CRITICAL of the game at the same time, silly!
---
Luckily I haven't had anything disappear, but I have had them "disappear" while in the workbench so I can't modify them, but that has been posted about since the first day of the last patch. (it doesn't happen every time, only for certain weapons, btw)
---
But yes, anything aside from ass kissing, whether it be post or comment, seems to be targeted.
---
Thanks - too early for me to follow directions apparently - dugh....
---
All I know is don't aim for the head that's the most damage resistant spot so you'll little damage. Hide behind stuff while it's using its laser. Pylon gods should run away from fight and hide.
---
Mod name pls
---
Sounds fair, but also sounds risky.  Try not to die while eating people.
---
&gt;If you sort your Aid by SPOIL 
---
then you clicked too many times and passed the useful sort options
---
Except that it's been fixed already.
---
man. I tried to spawn this vendor dozens of times with no luck. I made an alt and at lvl 8 who do I run into accidently? With only 500 caps. Not enough to but any outfits he had on him. AHHHH!
---
the left arm of paladin has a rank logo.  everything else is the same; except in your inventory they'll be listed as  something like "calibrated BOS T-60 Left Leg"  where paladin will say something like "Calibrated BOS V T-60 Left Leg"
---
so, name difference and left arm. that's it.
---
I caved and bought the outfits from other players. Some how the guy only wanted 200 for the long coat!
---
Gave ya gold because you reminded me of the great times I had playing Doom/Quake with my son many years ago. Enjoy it while you can before he “grows up” and branches into other online games. Agree also on the need for faster action with the younger crowds. I enjoy the Fallout series especially because I can take my time. As a senior citizen, these fingers aren’t that fast anymore!
---
Well I agree with your answer. I use a Double Explosive Shotgun because I like to play like it's DOOM. Play how you have fun, it's the right answer.
---
I missed one also. Oh well.
---
Yeah, that is a issue. Though that would be on them to code a npc that could interact with multiple people, as they should have already done with vendors.
---
They could also add a time out for npcs so the afkers get kicked if they spend more time than necessary in a npc. 60 seconds to 120 seconds 1-2 mins .. that is way more than enough time. As dialogue would be just as it is now .. not something you interact with. Just because they are human does not mean you get more out of them then the robots.
---
Though to that point, how would you fix the current problem of people afking at vendors? The same we do now and just hop to a new server.
---
It's just a very silly argument as to why no human npcs, when we clearly already have npcs with this issue already and it's really not even that big of a issue. It's something gs needs to work out on their end though, it should be easy enough for them to allow multiple interactions on the same npc at the same time and if not … it just shows how out of date and limited this games engine is as 99% of  mmo's have npcs that 100's of people can talk too at once.
---
&gt;Once a high level player even just killed me because he wanted to use the trader I was busy trading with and couldn't wait for me to finish.
---
You probably help a workshop at that time, they went there, started to contest it and canceled, then came after you, and not because they wanted to use the vendor.
---
I agree that the above mechanic sucks, bailing out of contesting a workshop should also protect the owner from PvP again, but it doesn't. So just be extra paranoid when you must own a workshop, and server hop once you don't need it anymore.
---
At least you made an attempt instead of just joining the bitch wagon lol
---
I only asked because you said you logged off. And logging off is different to closing it out completely.
---
Moreover your choice not to use the search function for a solution the minute you couldn't get an egg, knowing you needed them all; and then proceeding to give me attitude, because you're frustrated you didn't get all the eggs, losing out on the limited time bunny mask, is on the shitty side as well. Have a good day :)
---
I just got the t-60 knight paint job the other day. I mistve handed in 100s of t data
---
make cosmetic atom shop camp items(example eggs) not take budget
---
Awesome! Did you get that all in one drop? I seem to only ever get a bit of ammo, but did get a science scribe outfit one time.
---
Shut up the Slenderman bug is back??? They gotta be kidding....
---
Sweet I was just thinking about making a post about this. Pleasent Hill Cemetery is where i was able to get my Deathclaw and Shishkebab plans. 
---
I was server hopping white springs because it has the two level 3 safes right near the entrance in the manager's office and the coat check and getting nothing good, so just as general reference to anyone else reading this I think they just have shitty spawn pools, don't waste the bobbypins.
---
Thanks man, but two of then spawned, and it's not giving me the option to send them home? I have both Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend maxed out
---
And I'm swimming in Bomber Jackets and never got a PA paint plan again after Initiate. I keep going there, though.
---
No downvote for me even though I disagree with him and you.
---
I WANT human npcs, but unlike most redditors who are to wrapped up in their own ideals. I feel everyone is entitled to their own opinion, just as long as they're up for debate.
---
The rampant downvoting does get annoying though, but it just shows how mentally inept the people are who are downvoting verses engaging in a proper conversation.
---
More power to both of you :).
---
I agree with what you're saying, but what does that have to do with what u/chumec said about Whitespring?
---
what do you play on xbox ps4 or PC?
---
No. Sometimes the CAMP module asked for way more fruit than was actually needed for the repair and wouldn't repair unless you had that many. That was the bug that has been fixed.
---
The point it to rebuild not go back. Also it's a game haha. Vault 76 was so yesterdayyy :P
---
&gt;Yes, I was in the "weapon" tab on the scrap menu so power armor wasn't even in that scrapping list, but this may be the cause of a lot of the Disappearing P/A bug that I've seen a lot posted here
---
If you select quickly enough, the "filters" in your tab menu don't update properly.  You can see this when you empty a tab out, you are left highlighting a random item from another tab.
---
This issue shows up causing many other issues.  Quite some time ago people thought that notes were holding "phantom weight" because they'd go into their stash and retrieve every single note very quickly, and end up 10+ lbs lighter.  But if they paid attention, they'd see that they were actually pulling out random pieces of Junk as their notes updated and they clicked quickly and the cursor was highlighting a piece of Steel, etc. in another tab.
---
It also causes issues when selling items to players and vendors, if your inventory changes the cursor position updates and can be on another tab all together.
---
I always make sure to scrap/sell one item at a time, to avoid these inventory updating and cursor position issues.
---
I think this can even allow you to be able to scrap legendary items when normally not possible.
---
They are definitely bugged and are not always reliable.
---
It's a texture glitch that's been happening for a couple of weeks.
---
I had the scribe and knight outfit, one level below shielded for the last 100 levels or so. Then bam all in one drop.
---
Must have been Vault 71 that got all of the air chips.
---
Ah...ha. ok. Since I saw it yesterday for the first time... wasn't sure if they were just doing some weird Easter thing. Tks
---
FBI! OPEN UP!
---
He's talking about OP.
---
Maybe we should be able to scrap them for crafting parts. Make a prestige system where we can use the parts to further improve the cards we like at no additional perk point costs. Each prestige upgrade would require more and more parts. It would give us a reason to continue leveling.
---
You step on something that looks like turd. You don't believe it is turd so you try to smell it, and it smells like turd, after that you still don't believe it, so you put it into your hand, and it feels like turd, you still don't believe....  Hey if after this many month this game is still bad, don't put it in your mouth.l
---
Yeah so thats probably where these reports of disappearing items is coming from, hopefully it can be fixed by bethesda
---
id rather have it be with less bugs
---
Twice now. 1st was my All Rise a month or 2 ago. Then this weekend, I sold an AA Hunting Rifle. Go to deliver it to the buyer, get it out of my stash, sell it to the buyer and 10 minutes later he's messaging me it was an Assassin's Hunting Rifle. So I figure maybe I grabbed the wrong one mistakenly in a hurry. Check my stash, and nope it's not there. So I pulled AA hunting rifle from my stash, set the price, and he buys it. Clearly during all of those steps you'd think one of us would've noticed if it were an Assassin's 1 star instead of an AA. I bought it back from him, and looked like a fool. I'm just glad it wasn't a big ticket item. But extremely odd nonetheless.
---
I’m just tryna get elder paint, sitting on 5 or 6 shielded linings and so many outfits I’ve just started vendoring all of them
---
I can repair my camp when I have 1 plant broken, everything but the plant gets fixed.  Didn't used to be like that, but the last (?) patch fixed it.
---
I haven't seen a bug that asks for more fruit than the number of broken plants (not saying it doesn't happen though).
---
I prefer the Gatling gun as it is more powerful per shot, and you won't mind the relatively slow fire rate compared to the others. It also just sounds cool. The 50 Cal has wildly inexpensive ammo, but you tend to use all of it during a fight. I never like the minigun so I can't speak to it's pros. The LMG is hot garbage, chewing through expensive ammo for almost no damage which is a shame.
---
Its reversible, I had it on my machine gun but ammo was a prick so I changed it back
---
Yes, they match with each other, but maybe not with the actual password
---
This is exactly what I've been doing
---
It would be pretty easy to nerf Sent/Cav by just negating the effects when jumping or when invisible. Stealthboys + Assassin's Cavalier makes for a really tough opponent. As you mention, going after their AP is pretty much the only way and even then you are likely to die more than they will.  Survival needs less invisible, tesla jumpers (myself included).
---
That's one of the few things I understand about people only dealing damage. I was DPS only in WoW for years and loved it, but wasn't specced for much else. At 29 I die a lot doing conduit, but I'm not good for much else. And I have stims. So I'm cool with getting in a shot now and then while players like you deal real damage and lower levels like me can provide the opening for it. That's how we work together. I just wish more people tried.
---
Also my favorite time to hit them. I can pop an emerging lvl80 SB before he has chance to fly. Do I feel bad because I effectively spawn-camped them?  Yeah, a little.
---
but that requires an ingame text chat
---
i find it lowkey stupid how from the look of it theres gonna be all these mods for the camera like different lens but they cant give us more than 1 mod for the 50 cal or auto grenade launcher
---
It used to happen.
---
Although tbf I think you are right about the first part, I do remember fixing my turrets from the camp module even though all my razorgrain was destroyed.
---
But the excess resources bug was there and it was fixed a while ago.
---
The weird part is, I think it used to be caused by being in power armour, right? But he wasn't in power armour. Then when he did get his suit out and enter his power armour, he was completely invisible to me.
---
It was all very weird. Standard 76 session.
---
We did and with the benefit of the conduit hiding while in stealth with a stealth boy active the whole time, and another player up there drawing any unwarranted fire.
---
this is likely
---
Thank you for this. I was able to get the last one I needed now.
---
I picked up a TSE Railway Rifle at WS this weekend. It's my best drop thus far.
---
If u like fallout that much you should at least give it a try. I kno $40 is $40 but I love the game and paid the full $60 even when everyone was sayin it was trash.
---
Try putting on some unyielding armor to get your luck up first if you haven't already. I had been doing this for forever the normal way (without luck boost) for way too long. Am now up to paladin paint. Not worried too much about getting elder, but it's nice to know you can speed things up some.
---
lucky, I have not gotten a drill yet /s. :( all I have ever gotten was a 1* wooden leg
---
Kill  the moleminers in the cities at the ashep and sell theyr stuff
---
Not necessarily.  You ever see those Maskimal things at Wal-Mart?  They are just oversized mascot heads that you could wear with anything.  Given all the different clothing in the game, I'm sure there are some funny combinations you can pull off.
---
Do you have the corn pone recipe? With some sugar and mirelurk eggs (easy to get from the Swarm of Suitors event) you can make some tasty desserts that give a nice charisma bonus for selling stuff.
---
Not just any Easter hat it’s a bugs bunny looking rabbit mascot head that looks a bit psychotic cause it’s got one ear missing lol
---
Anything under lvl20 or so I dump on lol level players.i figure there will always be legendary farming so it's fine not to have 12000 tokens/rerolls immediately. I still have like 500 lbs of legendaries in stash anyway
---
Thank you.

Straight jackets from Fort Defiance otherwise farm westtek for guns and gear.
---
You really that anxious for more three star junkies weightless +blocking pipe wrenches? People will always have reasons to bitch about legendary drops. 
---
The real question here is why are people still sinking resources into killing her when they already know their chances are no better than killing any other three star.
---
I've had one char do well over a hundred drops and got most paint but no lining. On a different char I did one and got it straight away. Madness.
---
&gt;  hopefully it can be fixed by bethesda
---
Hopefully, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
They tried to fix the selling issue.  If you were listing multiple pieces for sale to another player, and the other player purchased one while you were setting the price of another, the new price set would be for a completely different time than the one you originally selected.
---
Because the position of the items changed when the player bought your first item.  This lead to people selling items for the wrong price and pretty much giving away stuff they wanted to keep.
---
The system now tries to force you out of the price setting menu due to item positions changing.  And it works some times, but there are still time frames where the issue can occur, as you set the price at the right moment it still messes up.
---
I believe the issue lies very deep in the way the inventory management system and tab filtering is coded, and not likely to be fixed any time soon.
---
Thank you very much kind sir. I too was a young man playing games with my Dad. I continue the tradition, just as my Dad taught me, I teach my son. We are very much alike.
---
pretty sure theyre adding a prestige system so it might be your lucky day
---
Alright enough time for you to disappear.
---
Can’t really be abused in any way nor does it offer any advantage doing that so I doubt it will be in their priorities to fix
---
 that's actually brilliant! Good idea but sometimes I feel that Bethesda doesn't even read Reddit.
---
There are ways to easily farm stimpacks, with or without the crafting them &amp;/or the use of Pharma Farma.  There's also a few ways to reduce the number of stimpacks you use; the main way being damage reduction effects, such as Sentinel or Troubleshooting.
---
Personally, I have/use Ghoulish 3 together with Rad Worms, Glowing Pustules and the excessively large amount of Radaway that I have to mitigate physical damage and save on Stimpacks.
---
That wasn't a stealth nerf, it was mentioned in patch notes a while back.
---
Now that's a pretty solid build. Wish mine was that clean and simple XD. I'm also on PC and I just hate having to scroll through all my perk cards, miss the one I need, scroll more, it's just an actual chore just to swap out a card and slap on Super Duper for me half the time, so yeah perk card loadouts are so needed! I'd just have one for crafting and one for damage
---
I've just chucked on one point of both Ordinance Express and Bear arms, and hell a drop of 20 to 14? Hell I take it, never really needed those two point sin Perception.
---
I'm aware the Anti Armour doesn't work with energy weapons, that really needs to be checked out by Bethesda, and I still feel that energy weapons need a buff, because even with 20% damage increase, I do more damage with a bloodied Pipe bolt-action than a laser sniper rifle.
---
In charisma I mostly just have travel agent and lone wander (Mr no friends of mine play this game), but I plan to ditch Travel agent after I get a good float of caps to sit on. But one I thing is that I need to  find a way to get Adrenaline back on, it was so useful.
---
Oh and I could never ever tank the sheepsquatch, I normally just become a conduit and attack the Sheepsquatch with a Quad Explosive shotgun just since that can noticeably tear chunks of health of it, but the minute I see that thing turn to me I just leg it, cause one hit and I'm dead, or it's beam will just drain my health. I gave up on using a Auto Vampiric Tesla rifle because with it's only 15 mag capacity and high rate of fire, it never really could heal me quick enough, so I've been trying to find a Vampiric Minigun, because that thing just insta heals, plus I have too much 5mm! But God, you must be brave to tank that one hit K.O bot!
---
Furious isn't bad either for end game, as the damage bonus actually has a chance to stack up. As far as heavy gun go, I just slap on bear arms and run a mix, mostly energy weapons (mostly because of ammo costs)
---
No and now it seems that the nuke launch alert is also bugged. Over the weekend I was 14 different launches and it only alerted 3 times I saw. I missed all of those other events because the Death from Above warning never was displayed....
---
I do that as a last resort, as I do like to chat to the people in the area too. We did end up in party chat after we failed.
---
Yeah, either way I submitted a ticked to bethesda.net just now so hopefully in the future they can re-work this, if not, ill just have to slow down in the mean time
---
Yeah, so does royal jelly, super inconsistent.
---
So this is pretty awesome. I did a comparison between my two heavy guns: a zealot explosive Gatling and a TSE .50cal prime. The .50 still does insane amounts of damage. Great work! Couldn't find the plasma Gatling to compare though.
---
I end up getting at least one Technical Data whenever I do a silo.  I swear I'm either really unlucky, or the rewards have been made rarer for it, because most of the time, all I get is some 40mm Grenades and a couple token healing items.  Rarely anything beyond that now. 😂
---
some guy was data mining and it didnt seem like a hardcore mode like described
---
I think you were just unlucky (or lucky before) since I think you have a chance to get mutations when exposed to any rads.
---
I pretty much play with the rule "SG2 if you don't want mutations / changed mutations".  Cause otherwise there is always that chance to get them from rad sources or water.  Any time you aren't using it there is always that chance to screw things up.
---
Previously Bethesda had limited time easter eggs on the atomic shop for free that you could place in the camp. If you didn't get them all then you missed it.
---
Whitespring over and over... It's big enough that I don't get bored doing it and you can pick up garbage legendaries to sell as well as lots of other loot to bulk then sell... Level 3 hard bargain + grape mentats FTW.
---
You can also put a mining helmet on before you step into the power armor. When in power armor you can turn the headlamp on.
---
Yeah there seems to have been quite a few of those assholes the first few days, but now it seems they've either given up or got whatever reward they were trying to farm, since I haven't seen one in a bit.

I want elder Maxon’s coat back
---
My game sometimes crashes when entering indoor areas too, usually repeatedly after it happens once. To try to fix it I wait for about a minute after loading into the world or area and kill something outside, loot it, and maybe stick a spoiled meat/fruit/vegetable into the corpse or into a container. (The looting may be helping in my imagination, but I really do think the waiting helps.) This is on xbox as well. Some people say to clear your game's saved data reserved space, but that erases my pictures so I don't do that much.
---
there had been radio silence since the mention of repair kits, i think they realised that we dislike this idea, i wouldnt worry too much
---
Who knows.
---
This is hard to read
---
I wonder if that's what happened to my Calibrated Excavator Leg that disappeared mid-session on me 🤔
---
Where's your points at homie? What special skills do you have?
---
Exactly. The update even put every train vendor in whitesprings. /u/theinsanegamer23, you think having 2 hubs for 24 people is a good idea? What? Even on top of the retcon?
---
Sounds like you want a lobby for people to stand around and queue for missions, aka not playing the game or exploring.
---
This is quality advice.  S.Mutants drop caps quite often. they also drop higher valued ammo. they also drop higher valued weapons.   Other than that make sure you hit the easy-peasy cap stashes, like on top of enclave service entrance, watoga high school, watoga EMS with cap collector on.  you can probably get about 2 or 300 caps in a very short amount of time just from the caps stashes.
---
What would you like to do? Weapon types you like and whether you use VATS or not is a good start.
---
Hmmm I haven't tried actually. I could imagine you can build on these small unmarked fissures. 
---
Just like you can build over radioactive pit in one waste disposal workshop. It probably won't allow to fill it with foundation, since the small radioactive pit is not ground, but if the camp can be located on the area, you could place floors over it. And just like enemies can spawn inside your house, SB can spawn though your house.
---
Ok, misread you then. I am not familiar with Kmax. WS is still dropping lots of legendaries for me, it just doesn't reload enemies automatically any longer whenever someone FTs there. You kind of learn to 'read the server' after a while, if I happen upon a golden server (my term for one with a high amount of legendaries everywhere), I keep doing my rounds between WS, Watoga and the Mire until either I have to log out, or (most of the time) the server either kicks me or shuts down for maintenance.
---
Actually, the WS Golf Club spawning anything other than ghouls (e.g. diseased eyebots) is a marker for a golden server, as that only seems to happen after the server has been up for a while and WS has been nuked a few times (and is now exhausted).
---
i wouldnt worry, theres no reason this wouldnt of already happened
---
Following stats

let us use the settlment recuitment beacon from fo4 for broadcasting location on the map
---
I would suggest you plug your perks into this: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) . That way we can see what you have an make some recommendations.
---
Improvement, so you and OP have difficulty using the current sorting? Why exactly? 
---
It's fairly simple. Anything that can spoil, is below. Anything above, are in alphabetical order.
---
Like the mentioned spoiled stuff. It's right there where it should be, according to the simple system. It can't spoil anymore so it's in "S". It's so silly to even mention the location of spoiled stuff. You got only two ways to interact with it, and the other is absurd. One, you can admire your spoiled stuff. Another, you can drop it. In both cases you find it right where it's always at.
---
&gt;Yes you are correct thats why i said with the right build, using a pistol as a side arm without any dmg perks they feel like bb guns.
---
My highest level character started as a gunslinger, but switched to bloody/unyielding unarmed because I got some lucky loot drops and thought, why not? But I still carry revolvers as backup, and the thing is, even fully specced and mutated for melee, *and with no pistol perks equipped*, I still use the revolvers probably half the time, because I can kill most things in a couple shots with my bloodied .44 or AA western, so unless the enemies are all bunched together, I kill them faster with vats headshots than I would having to chase them all down to punch them.
---
I went 7 patches just getting lucky, and got it multiple times since patch 8? That seems unlikely. And I swear I saw somewhere that it was a 5 rad threshold for mutations.
---
what service were you denied?
---
Hell, I'd settle for sort by spoiling to work at a vendor.
---
The easiest way to do it is to build a fusion generator right next to the FC processor. (Obvs you have to take the workshop first) and surround it with walls of some sort. It's kinda boring, but you can farm the other stuff that's there too. If you need the plans for the generator, the vendor at Welch usually has it. 
---
TBH it's a really boring process, especially if you don't want to leave the area for long. Also make sure you level up the cards that extend the life of your FC to 200%. I only have to do this every few weeks.
---
You can also farm them by going to the known locations where there are FC available (I followed a post on here when I did that) but those are not always there when you arrive, and those FC aren't 100% so the best, safest, but most boring way is to make them yourself.
---
I don't know what wack servers yall get on.  I always see people launching on ps4
---
Huh. Maybe he didnt know what it was worth. Well, good for you!
---
Not when half the players are using energy weapons and despite dealing piss pore damage, they insist on never taking a pylon.  This is a common issue on PS4 at least.
---
So Hunter &gt; Exterminator!
---
I found it easiest to jump on top of thr antenna on the roof and shoot from there.  I am 100% sneak chameleon mutation sniper with all sneak perks maxed and applied.   I clear the path for other players doing the conduits.
---
The entire inevtory interface is trash.  I don't play a lot of games but I watched a friend play Diablo 3 recently and it really sunk in how much FO76's inventory system is horribly out of date.  It really takes time away from playing the actual game to a level that is unacceptable imo.
---
So after playing for how long you gonna demand your money back? Pathetic.
---
Did they change that? Because you didn't used to be able to undo Primes 🤔
---
Because they've already ruled it out from a lore standpoint. The final goal of vault 76 is Reclamation, kicking the vault dwellers out so they can reclaim the country. What happens to the majority of successful vaults that open and just let their people choose to come and go as they please? They all opt to just sit safely in their vaults until something ends up forcing them out.
---
If the camera wasn’t available it means you didn’t actually do the challenge, so I don’t see what compensation you’re entitled to. 
---
If you did the challenge, and the reward didn’t come, then sure.
---
Will do shortly. At work and dont have access to the char.
---
Crazy, but enough good news for me to keep making that run every day!
---
Are you that 900 hours guy? Well, good, we can all stop having to read about how you were "unjustly" banned. See ya.
---
Will give that a try, thx!
---
In some ways, the secondary effect (Sentinel or Cavalier, although it doesn't always say as much in the name) is more important than the primary one.  Whenever you see armor with a "Reduces incoming damage by 15% while standing still/sprinting," that's what's ultimately going to help the most.
---
I used to run all Vanguard and had very high DR/ER when at full health, but the problem is, that's based off your total HP, not HP - rads.  You have *any* rads at all, and you eat into that benefit.
---
Personally, I still think Unyielding is the best overall, especially if you're melee, and even if you aren't bloodied, because the effects start kicking in around 50% HP and boost every stat except END.  Your armor is doing something above-and-beyond basic armor for a much larger span of your health bar than Vanguard and Bolstering, and you'll always find yourself at low health at some point in the game.  You'll get more Strength and Agility points for more damage or running away from what's hurting you so you can Stimpack.
---
The rest of the armor is pretty circumstantial.  If you know you're going to be fighting a particular enemy, then you could find the appropriate prefix for them (which is like having one of those secondary effects, but only on a specific enemy).  But armor is heavy and most players will generalize.
---
I assume he means 
---
[Better Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/32/).
---
Which no one is putting a gun to our heads to purchase  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_\/¯
---
Mutation serums sell for 450 or more to vendors depending on your charisma.  Also can sell them to players for 200 caps
---
Personally, I'm all *about* the wacky headwear. I often rock the Vault Girl mask with my Bone Raider Excavator armor.
---
I haven’t done it yet but from what I’ve read you just go to an armor bench and it gives you the ability to craft the head I believe.
---
They have upped the loot pool a little bit a few patch or so ago. I know it sucks getting a 1 star but always getting a 3 star would kind of beat the purpose of doing anything else. Also if any of you take up to 30 minutes and spend more than 1500 ammo you might want to take a look at your approach to that fight. Or look for a decent group instead of relying on randoms that probably try to leech where possible.
---
Yeah really, what happened? I’ve had a great time playing 76 now that it’s more stable.
---
Hi, I will be online after 30mins or so, i will still be on later today if you are not available by then
---
Oh okay
---
Oh yeah. Weapons in the game are kinda boring. Or add new legendary effects like cold, lightning, etc.
---
head wear section. it is the "Easter Bunny Mascot" head
---
I’ve bought it twice...the Tricentennial edition for my Xbox and the regular for my sons.  I LOVE this game. I haven’t played any of the other FO games yet, but definitely will once I get tired of this one...which will still be a while yet (I’m level 125 so have a lot of hours in).
---
Okay
---
He cheated and was banned.
---
Yeh I like that.
---
Not from the queen or imposter I suppose. They drop max level gear. Gear level is tied to the monster xp level ALWAYS.
---
Dtheresthe cat bowl house east of Morgantown and the mess hall/dining tables in that asylum the brotherhood lives in. Also golf balls
---
It’s a mascot head so go to an armour workbench, select headwear, scroll down to the Easter item 🐰
---
The game technically has it though it is disabled due to the " dev commands" not being taken out of the game :/.
---
**.50 Cal FTW**
---
Been playing HW since Beta, tried em all, and there are plenty of good options with different upsides and downsides, but the .50 Cal always manages to rise above the rest.
---
Even mass producing the Ultracite Ammo isn't too hard, you just need to stockpile Violet Flux every time you hit a nuke zone, but if you're using it against the Queen anyway then boom, every time you kill her you can restock.
---
Also, if you're switching from a melee build, don't forget to pick up the Stabilized Perk - the armor penetration is a huge deal for HW.
---
Ye I did that xd got 7
---
You can't have three of those. It's only a level one card
---
Marine Tactical Helmet sold to vendor in bulk.
---
then why does he think he gets money back?  
---
if the servers didnt work, okay, but this is just asinine
---
On a related note, what's the deal with Forest Treasure Map #3?  I know where it is thanks to guides, but that (W) direction is very misleading.  Poseidon Nuclear isn't west from that location at all.
---
That's kind of when I gave up doing the maps.
---
That won't bring airflow to the lower levels. You do **not** want to live in an underground area with only one point of airflow.
---
I use to think they were a complete waste. but I’ve actually found it useful in refitting my specials. I’ve modified my build a couple times and it is helpful to be able to put 1 of something instead of having to put the whole 3 in there. But with that said I do have quit a few extras that I don’t use at all so yea it would be nice to recycle them some how!
---
Imagine coming out of the vault to see essentially a shopping mall.
---
Nooooooo!
---
There is a shopping mall on the map.  Use that one.  There's barely any lore about it right now anyway (no, not top of the world, keep going right/east).
---
Why you hate whitespring? leave vault 76 alone
---
I actually got an answer from customer support. Wasnt a very good one, said that theyll release the accounts when the servers are more stable. Basically theyre worried all the items will bog down the servers and cause issues. I told them my account doesnt even have that many items. My character isnt over encumbered and i have at least 400 stash available for more storage. They said theyll look into my account. Doubt they did
---
He won’t get back anything.
---
Since re-opening the vault goes against the lore, we can build on the outside.  Vault 76 is already a free fast travel spot, it'd be perfect for a player hub outside the vault.  Or, you know, let us actually rebuild Appalachia like we are supposed to.  Set a player hub up in an existing town.
---
Yeah, it's boring but the only way to get them at 100%. I held it for about 3 hours before logging out so I'll be good for a month or so.
---
check out this idiot's post history. more of the same.
---
I just noticed that you are missing the Plasma rifle/pistol, Gatling laser, plasma Gatling, Laser rifle/pistol, Flamer and cryolator. ofc with those, you would have to take into account the different barrels for the energy weapons as well as the receiver. still great job
---
Honestly I just want new mods for the crossbow like poison tipped or barbed arrows for bleed damage
---
Because with a semi decent group you can kill her under 5 minutes easily without spending much resources honestly. Also she drops quite a few items and yes yo ucna get no or 1 star but from my experience it's less time consuming looking for a decent legendary like that. I can farm 6 locations 3 or more times and get a butt load of 1 star items or low level 3 star (nice horde event levels btw fml). It's not unusual to kill 3 queens under 20 minutes.
---
Let me know if it works. It’s kind of been bothering me all night lol. I’m racking my brain to try and remember if I got all 6 for sure!
---
Son, it's time for ''that'' story about the bugs and glitches. Once upon a time there was a bug called Data. He lived in a server in a client based players inventory and every day went out to gather Variables from the mods around his inventory. Brokey absolutely loved zeros. All runtime long he collected every zero from one inventory to another, collecting zeros and taking it back to the server where the other data would use it to make even more zeros.  But one day Bethesda came. The zeros turned to ones and variables and strings began to fail inside the mods. The days grew  longer and the complains grew even higher. And when Data went to his favorite client, you,  the zeros were gone. He transfered to the other clients where he'd had so much fun, only to find all the zeros gone. ... He realised everywhere he was going every variable in a mod turned to one. In this moment he understood that he was the failure all along and he made everything bad in the source code, because he collected all zeros and brought them  together in one place. So he went corrupt and he liked it. So he never stopped to collect all zeros from mods inside players inventories. 
---
You maybe ask whats the moral of the story am i right my son? Well we don't know. The data is still there and destroying your inventory. Only time will tell us what variable is Bethesda going to change next. Now go to bed woodspider and hope for the best.
---
It worked
---
Vanguard Cavalier armor (Combat, Marine or Metal preferably). Couple that armor with Executioner’s, Swing Speed, +1Strength Unarmed weapons are you’re in good shape to wreck Bloodied builds.
---
Can you tell me your special stats and perk cards you have? If a build is something your interested in I can help out. In general I point people to a strength power armor melee build for pve
---
This isn't uncommon I'm at or above that and I'm not counting my mule
---
Can't you get them thru gum packs?
---
Bro this is amazing! I would love to see this kind of thing in the game, pat yourself on the back friend!
---
Oh yeah, i like to carry a lot of weaps and keep changing, handmade, lever action, gauss and dragon, so imagine the carry weight and im using 3 parts of my armor with weapons redux and they are still heavy.
---
They def need to include it on any weight redux perk
---
You won't do ANY damage if they don't fight back
---
Ooh... Since you don't need the lower ones equipped to equip the higher ones, the whole team can have level 3 lockpicking, with only one point in perception and 3 charisma each. One person shares lockpicking, one shares expert, one shares master.
---
What utility does the Flare bring?
---
WV- Are you getting many Fallout 76 tourists?  Just curious
---
IF you do a Workshop your are choosing to participate in PvP, If you don't want PvP don't take workshops
---
Of course they're weightless, it's not like they're Bobby pins or something.
---
This was always my biggest problem. Cap stashes used to appear much more frequently and could be server hopped. Not anymore, so they’re not the best way of getting caps (but don’t pass them up if you’re near them either).
---
Selling certain outfits gets you a good amount of caps. For example the golf outfits at the Whitespring clubhouse or the straight jackets at the asylum sell for a good amount of caps and only weigh 0.1lbs. What I farmed were the space suits at the crashed space station. Just build a camp near there and server hop, you’ll get 2 space suits and two helmets almost every time. The code to the door is 111418. 
---
I’m now over 700 hrs in and farming caps has become roleplaying a vendor with an interesting shop. I’ve collected tons of plans while playing and just sell the duplicates. I’ll spend all day farming workshops for plans to sell later and collect randomly spawning plans from different places. Then the next day,  I just hang out at my shop and barter with players. I’ve made thousands of caps each day that way and other players get some plans they’ve been wanting as well. You can make way more than the daily sell limit that way. 
---
Best way for you currently might be to find someone on r/market76 that’s selling the plans for the marine tactical helmet. It’s super cheap to craft and sells for around 28 caps each. It’s basically the new civil war top hat. Hope that helps
---
You can change the sorting on Ps4, I assume it's similar on Xbox.
---
I agree though, sorting by spoil is backwards and generally just odd the way Bethesda decided to sort things.
---
I went to the Overseers Camp over the weekend to drop off stuff and there was a bag there. I peeked in and there were a couple of plans I didn’t know so I grabbed them, but then added around 30 more plans to it along with some stims, radaway, &amp; ammo.  I’ll never take anything other than plans I don’t know. Along came a level 4 and I used my emotes to get him to pick up the bag. Was a great day for that guy. So if I’m in the area I may peek in for plans I don’t know, but I’ll always add stuff...especially considering the only time I’m in the area is to drop stuff off 😁
---
Kind of a mixed bag. I use a sniper for distance, shotgun for close gun fights, asphalt rifle for medium range gun fights, and a super sledge for the up close melee like super mutants and bugs.
---
Shit I don't deal with because I deleted fallout 76. Its not gonna get better.
---
I'm not sure what you mean either.  The only weird deaths I've seen are when you kill Scorched before they "wake up," which launches them into the sky and is pretty easy to do at Camden Park, and I assume it's because in that pose, they are intersecting the ground or something.
---
There might be some kind of terminal velocity in the game to prevent the physics from becoming too expensive.
---
I'm 58, and sometimes team up with a few that are older than me, and frequently play with people in the 25-45 range where I'm the Old Guy, but I'm cool with that.
---
I have several Vendor characters and deal with lots of other players on a regular basis, most (75%) of the people I meet in game tend to be in the 25-40 age range, with the Over/Under 25% being fairly equal.
---
The group I regularly play with is a mature bunch for the most part, and tends to be well behaved in Party Chat with the women and occasional younger players, but we also limit the party chat where younger players are involved since the parents of some (Under 15) don't seem to pay any attention to what their children are doing online.
---
I believe this game is better suited to the Mature players, as most of the Toxic players I have encountered tend to be in the 15-25 range, not to say all younger players are toxic, some I have met in game were very courteous.
---
Yeah bloodied probably does do decent dmg even without perks theyre just not viable for endgame enemies 
---
Do you remember how much excatly? My Bloody explo western does a 475 if i remeber correctly
---
Or maybe there was a flash, a bam, and an alakazam?
---
Energy Weapons :/ Still horrible damage ( the +10% was a joke )
---
AID should be turned into 4 tabs

FOOD  DRINK  CHEMS  INGREDIENTS
---
Just like MISC should put KEYS under its own heading.
---
NOTES should put treasure Maps separately.
---
etc.
---
Armor should show its position FIRST... [Head] [Arm Left] [Arm Right] [Chest] [Leg Left] [Leg Right]
---
Seriously Bethesda... look at the sorting mods that have been available since FO3, throw the developer a few grand, and implement it!
---
Hm. Well i guess thats why they didnt make me overseer
---
Yes saw a mutant once walk towards a pole or streetlight and die on impact it was funny😊
---
Same happened to me.
---
They didn’t steal my money I gave it to them and I’m still playing the game you should play it’s great.... oh wait that’s right you cheated and you can’t so you post this crap on a sub designed for fans. Yeah good plan
---
Because most mmo recipe games allow start areas to have free fast travel. It just works.
---
I think the train stations would be better instead.
---
VATS Crit?
---
True, hard to get to craft flux now.
---
Yeah would be pretty cool, or some of the railroad type coats.
---
Broken game mechanics dude. People put out huge amounts of damage (needed in some pve scenarios) but it doesn’t translate to pvp very well.
---
Holy shit. Same happened to me. 😂😂😂😂
---
IMO you need more luck points some of the best all around perks are in luck. Like Bloody mess, class freak, one gun army, starched genes, super duper, and serendipity
---
As for the sentinel if you get staggered you get hurt. Same as moving ofc
---
My route is usually fort defiance, collect all the straight jackets (any everything else there)
---
Freak show next, two straight jackets, ranger outfit in box, lots of caps in buckets and caps stash usually.
---
Blackwater mine and whitesprings, if by chance I haven't maxed the vendor caps.
---
Haven't tried a cap stash rout yet, but they are out there and can yield a lot of caps with the right perk and aid items.
---
I'm not sure who "Bethseda" is.  They sound terrible.
---
Well, gotta go - I'll be in the wasteland loving Fallout 76!
---
I took over all 3 for the majority of a day last weekend, ended up with over 100 fc.  I split them up between myself and 3 others that I play with on a regular basis. We’ll all be good for a while 😉
---
I did all my treasure maps a few days ago as well. Had every one of the except the Space Station one. I too didn't get a single BOS plan.
---
Because that's how rarity works.
---
They have 100% of they daily recommended amount of sugar !
---
I focused on all the gladiator perks with unarmed perk and incisor to ignore damage resistant. As weapon wise I went with meat hook since it weighs less than the miner gauntlet. Pluse I have an anti armor meat hook which adds to the incisor perk. But the miner claws look better
---
I farm people at workshops for their junk.
---
This was happening to me last night. Seems to be a visual glitch I didn’t actually have any new usable items
---
I use floors as roofs so I have multiple options from the atom shop.  You always get a flat roof, but I'm pleased with the color options.
---
Agreed; I've never encountered an enemy at the farmhouse north of Bolton Greens, but it IS creepy. I keep expecting a zombie cat herd to pop out.
---
You don't need to be in a team for that.  You just need to be friends.
---
I made a lot of "friends" during Fasnacht. 😂
---
Initiate paint was removed from the drop pool. Either intentionally or accidentally.  I suggest do your best to find an extra plan on the marketplace before all the available ones dissappear (if you're looking to have full collection).
---
I keep 3 ranks on all the time, swap down to 1 rank and max adrenaline for queen fights. Really cuts down on repairs, a lot. It's one of those quality of life perks that allows you to enjoy the game by needing to grind less for the basics.
---
It makes me angry that this mod has existed since November.
---
I want to know this also. Gladiator is one handed weapons, and iron fist is unarmed.
---
This is sad. It's been months, you got banned. Get over it.
---
Are you on Xbox One? That sounds like some of the shit I do ;)
---
Everyone forgets the Broadsider.
---
Your firing a canon ball, but only does around 150-180 damage.
---
And the ammo weighs a lot too. 
---
Compared to the Harpoon gun which deal 180-210 damage 
---
and the ammo weighs less.
---
Broadsider should have a damage amount around 250-300
---
I've had All Rise vanish from my inventory after repairing it then logging out. I loved that sledge and now I can't get it back unless I pay someone caps which I'm not fully ready to do yet.
---
Same goes for safes. If you lockpick them and don't like what you see just don't touch anything. It will reset/change for you.
---
Yea you're mixing waayyyyy too much. Stick to one or even 2.
---
If it's anything like the alcohol quests, you'll probably have two months of camera challenges to make up for it. 😋
---
junk jet
---
Indeed and it should happen.
---
All I read was whine whine whine, the thoughts of an over pretentious person who's not happy with anything in life because it doesn't live up to his standards , more whining, the end.
---
&gt;Also getting rid of my Fallout collection. Not going to give the company another cent
---
Fallout games are not an airport you don't have to announce your departure. No one cares.
---
Become a Moonshiner! You've got a perfect setup to become the best bootlegger / bar owner in the Wasteland 👍 go give the Bobrov Brothers a run for their money
---
Yeah! we need a re-roll function!
---
It should be the strongest revolver in the game with a reload speed like that.
---
I started picking up the crappier legendaries for like 100-200 caps, the rolling pins and pipe wrenches and such off of vendors. Figure they'll be tokens and if not, it's just some caps. No one wants a lvl 50 rolling pin. I'm usually the lowest one in my group, so I end up reviving other of people more than fighting in big fights, before the legendary vendor was announced people would pay me in crap-tier legendaries, rather than sell them for like 20 caps.
---
Oh Yeh, The junk jet would be cool
---
So sad I had to visit family and missed a couple eggs by leaving town 🤦
---
Not sure if this is true. Because I remember fighting some bots at dyer. A friend spawns in and they all die. Could have been that he respawned the ones  I already killed and they insta died but seem unlikely (since their bodies where nowhere close to eachother.)
---
Best answer. Informative and pragmatic.
---
I just get the glowing blood, then I sell it for caps
---
Well there are new weapons in the games files, but they're all melee. Only ranged one is a Cross bow that has been in the files for a while now. I honestly would like to see things like a caravan/lever action shotgun plus a single shotgun, Anti Material rifles, 9mm pistol and 9mm submachine gun, and my a rocket launcher, not a missile launcher. I believe in New Vegas you had a missile launcher, one that we have now, and then a rocket launcher.
---
12.7 pistol and 12.7 submachine guns is also good addition, I need we need more variety in ammo and pistols/submachine guns, because after Playing Fo4 a lot, they feel old now.
---
Some ammo types could be re-used, so a 5.56 pistol, but oddly I find it weird how ammo types for the lever action in Fo4 changed from 45-70. to 45.
---
I'd also like the Riot shotgun back, but for now the Combat and Double barrel are fine.
---
Though one thing for sure is Chinese weapons, such as the Chinese pistol and assault rifle.
---
The dart gun would be a good addition, but I think modding the crossbow would be better.
---
And finally maybe some more unique Machine guns with some special quirks, like FIDO from FoNV
---
&gt; The free atoms are fairly generous, but the real-money conversion rate for atoms is not.  
---
It can't be, though, because they are essentially giving you "free money" for playing.
---
I suspect everything in the Atomic Shop would be cheaper if you couldn't earn Atoms during normal play.  The fact that you can inflates the prices.  If they want to tip the balance more toward players who pay real money, what they should do, imo, is to take the current USD cost of Atoms and provide another 50% of Atoms for it.
---
Thank you. I made a post about me having trouble with the lag and people downvoted me
---
Platform please?
---
You can sort by SPOIL on the XBOX, but it doesn't really work the way you'd think it should. It seems like the intent was to list the items from fresh to almost spoiled, however it doesn't quite work this way. In your Pip-Boy the spoilable items will be lumped in the bottom, but in a seemingly random order. In the stash menu, and vendor menu, it will sort everything in a seemingly random order with spoilable items mixed in with non-spoilable items. It might have been fixed, but I stopped sorting by anything other than name a while ago.
---
Platform?
---
Nice! Thx man!
---
I would love to animate the cards I maxed out already but now they will forever be plain.
---
I don’t think they have sad anything about it for a while, I can’t remember if they talked about it during quakecon or an interview
---
Can confirm. Perk cards that give higher % to stagger are the best defense against someone in Sen/Ass armor
---
Hehehehe
---
Xbox players are the biggest scammers ever dude. IDK if it’s worse on other platforms but omg. One guy tried selling the Fascnacht  man mask(the one you find at fort defiance on the ground) for 4K caps. So I message him and he didn’t reply... go figure. And just yesterday I was looking to buy a two shot explosive handmade. So the guy tried selling it to me but it only said “Two shot hardened” so I actually made a good move and I told him to shoot it which in fact it was explosive. BE CAREFUL PEOPLE
---
You're just mad you can't complete your junkies/mutants wooden board/rolling pin/pipe wrench/ lead pipe set. I have them allllllllllllll
---
I think that's the only way to not be bored silly... I'd be super paranoid the whole time, though!
---
Maybe thanks but people where saying on another one that the plans give both the laser gun and the laser pistol so I don't know what to believe anymore but I'll try this it's probably my best chance
---
I'm pretty sure I've found all of the named locations.  As in every Bethesda game, there's a ton of stuff in-between that's easy to overlook unless you travel between locations as the crow flies.
---
This is one of the reasons I quit, just felt like my time was being wasted to finally see a 3* just to kill it and get a 1* or a drill.
---
Thanks alot this is perfect
---
ManBearPig is real! I'm being super cereal guys!
---
Yes please. Got disconnected from a fresh WS nuke server this morning and the one other player that I knew was on the server with me wouldn't respond to my friend request, so I was SOL.  If Bethesda can't give us consistent game stability then they need to give us the ability to rejoin the last server we were in.
---
Nuka cola plant needs more love. I hardly see anyone there :(
---
I also think having a tesla cannon for the encryptid event would be pretty nice.
---
I just want a legendary pipe revolver
---
The best legendary I have ever gotten from either the queen or sheepsquatch was a 1* 10mm... it was level 35 instigating
---
Found the BoS combat armor chest piece in black water mine
---
Those are energy weapons and are pitted against energy resistance. I don't fully know how to compare a ballistic and energy weapon yet and also enemies have different ballistic and energy resistances that would misalign the comparison.
---
Awesome list. Let's hope Bethesda have plans to add then
---
What I want to know is what will it take for someone to finally excise Drills and Syringers from the list.
---
Haha indeed
---
So when you get banned from BL3 are you going to cry a lot also?
---
Bullies lol
---
What if we really ARE the beta test group, and there's another vault underneath our vault, and that group is in our old vault right now, laughing at us and going through all the stuff we weren't allowed to take? I would have been pushing a shopping cart out of that place IRL. You know the AC still works and we got played like a banjo.
---
It looks SO MUCH better. That is where I am at, honestly. I want MMG to work out because I think it looks sickening. Is the damage comparable at max level?
---
Not to mentiom that selling your games doesnt somehow magically remove that money from bethesda. He already bought their games.
---
I'd be fine with something as extreme as dumping 3 cards for a randomly selected card. I have so many worthless cards that I will never use
---
Yes, most bugs are squishy enough to not switch to Exterminator's, but Fog Crawlers, Honeybeasts and Mothmen are tougher.
---
Don’t worry. Time will fly by quickly
---
Tell you what... how about, BEFORE you come here and talk out of your ass... YOU go, get a lawyer, fight this fight, and set precedent.
---
Til then... stop being a salty little  bitch, and suck it up.
---
Just reminded me about holotape sorting too.
---
Quest description is: play certain tape on this terminal.
---
Real quest is: WTF was the name of that tape and where is it on this list of 300 others?
---
Energy weapons are currently not included because calculation and resistances are a bit different and I haven't fully explored them yet.
---
Sugar Bombs! It's the bomb, sugar.
---
I got the first lockpick in three separate card packs. That was more than slightly annoying, glitch or not.
---
Well thats true, 7th of May sees the release of the backpacks &amp; Player Vending. :D
---
Update on this! It is slated to be fixed in a patch early May.
---
This should actually be the case.
---
Make those stars stronger and give better stuff
---
BOS  III has not been removed, but I went from II to IV when being awarded the plans.
---
Where are people getting this idea that the Mole Miner Gauntlet benefits from both?  I tried it myself after someone suggested it, doing a before-and-after with the Gladiator cards, and it doesn't affect the damage at all.
---
ALL OR NOTHING!!  
---
NO HALF MEASURES!!
---
MUTANTS NOCTURNAL FLARE GUN would be my God roll.
---
I saw that come up yesterday as well
---
Food storage 101. First in, first out. You want to eat the oldest food first so it doesn't go bad.
---
Thanks! I'll check it out.
---
Thanks for all the feedback provided here guys :) As always, I will make sure this gets shared with the team.
---
One question, are there 6 eggs?
---
Because I logged in everyday and only got 5 eggs.
---
The first egg did not refresh for a whole day
---

---
Lmao that vats crit to the head gets them time
---
Most offer ways such as portals though their worlds are leagues larger and often are tied to a cost that is far more than a few caps. Such as mining They also have mounts in which you can traverse the land, air or sea on.
---
This map in comparison to a mmo is insanely small. Large for Fallout, tiny for a open world mmo style game. 
---
This new game mode also all but took it away from minus the vault, stations and home. Which is already a step in the right direction to eliminating it or removing it or even only making it to home.
---
When they are added they will be cash shop, and very rare from drops at bosses, or random legendaries. Basically, you won't get them reliably unless you pay for them. So much for the game never adding pay to win aspects....only selling cosmetics my arse.
---
I recognize that name. i play on xbox and had a bunch of friends get slaughtered by an invincible guy contesting a workshop. He probably had 6 people on him using all kinds of weapons and they couldn't touch him. the level 0 thing is just a visual glitch
---
More intermediate cartridge heavy weapons. Or, at the least, switching the MG42 to the accurate 7.92 mauser ammunition that can be crafted in bulk like 5mm and 50 cal.
---
I'll have to check, I may have traded it. I'll let you know when I get back on.
---
Uhhh it’s not Exactly the same. “You can now craft energy weapons.” That’s the extra one I forgot. You don’t need a perk to craft armor, or basic melee weapon or guns. So it’s an extra ability and sets it apart from the other crafting cards. 
---
That said, I’m not saying three 2* perks is, you know, the ultimate smartest superior way it had to be done. I’m just brainstorming a justification for they way they did it. 
---
I feel those cards are sort off too.
---
Gatling gun is recommended
---
Also no confirmation Bethesda actually increased those rates, can be yet another line of bugs this game has.
---
Fact is actually Bethesda never said human NPC's would be added, but they did say they wouldn't be adding them, so considering official information available, more likely they will not add human NPC's.
---
I don't see the point even in human NPC's either than ppl are just used to human NPC's from previous part of Fallout and just can't get over them. What human NPC's can give to the player community that robots, mutants, ghouls, etc can't? Why not try something new? Why this craving for human NPC's?
---
It did in 4, and NV gave you caps from Nukas, and from Sunsets.
---
i have high hopes for these with the "ever onward" questline (pioneer scouts). especially since there will be "merit badges" to earn, one of which being archery.  
---
but im sure il just sadly be disappointed in myself for getting to excited
---
Same here man. Should be six. I logged in every day as well. I some how missed the paint splash egg
---
Yeah.  I found an Instigating Meat Hook in a vendor, and it was the thing that finally supplanted my 3\* Instigating Combat Knife.  Against undamaged enemies, that thing kicks out at least 1,200 damage on the first hit, and that's not even with full Gladiator.  It's crazy.  Pretty much everything dies on the first hit, short of Scorchbeasts or the server doing its weird "That hit doesn't count" logic.
---
But it also makes me look like a demented pirate.  I just wish the player character would put their arms down when not in combat with Unarmed instead of keeping them up until you holster it.
---
Got one saturday from the Market channel for 5k exactly this one with faster fire rate.
---
How did you get the Marine combat armor helmet?
---
One of the many things obsidian  did right with FNV.
---
They go and take "Unique" versions of weapons and give them character.
---
Meanwhile at Bethesda studios...
---
"WE DONT HAVE THE BUDGET TO ADD UNIQUE SKINS FOR FREE!!!!"
---
Still... a better investmant than paying for repair kits.
---
Heart of the swamp.
---
Haha I don’t tank the squatch in the perk loadout I linked. I built a tank perk set, and usually use some health chems and health food to give me more cushion with my low health. I’ve got some ideas for further tweaks and a different gun that I think could possibly solo the squatch with :D
---
And I run quite a few mutations, I just never had an issue with getting new mutations unexpectedly when I was wearing power armor. All of a sudden in patch 8 I am.
---
I like the semi-hidden entrance and the way it fits into the surroundings, but also have to say that is exactly why I don't put craft tables near windows.
---
I've started spending my free atoms this past month or so. There are a lot of things finally peaking my interest. So as soon as I hit zero I'll get the atoms stash back up.  Yay to lots of new content!
---
NO...
---
The rock-it-launcher...
---
That weapon badly needs some new toys. I would love to use mine because I play stealthy but it just isn't practical enough.
---
I have a crazy thought... how about just play the game as it is, and be happy when you get an item that is designed to be a rare drop.
---
One time I went to take a workshop and all the enemies were already dead and the shop free to claim. Nice. I also wanted the junkyard  and it was the same story, all enemies dead, open for the claiming. Just for the hell of it I checked another, same story again. I traveled the map and took every unclaimed workshop without firing a shot or throwing a punch. Failed a lot of defend quests tho.
---
Same here.
---
Me: (In power armor)  Level 5 diseased radtoach: *its free real estate*
---
how about when the epic launcher steals his info and he gets his ID stolen?
---
I don't think removing it a step in the right direction. I am not going to walk from watoga to flatwoods. Sorry, but most players don't want farming simulator paired with hiking time waster simulator.  If you don't like fast travel being available by all means walk everywhere. On top of that, I prefer the vault being there in case the game screws up like it does a lot and gives me 1 respawn point- the vault.
---
Ill admit i don't do the pylons bc of the low health bloodied build I run but you best believe once the imposters shield drops, I rush in, land a couple good hits for dmg and I die. Also have fireproof so I'm usually taking care of the robots anyway
---
we already have it, it is a mascot head of the easter bunny
---
I prefer the Vanguard's since I tend to keep my health topped up, but Regenerating, Auto-Stim, &amp; Life Saving, are also good prefixes, and every Stealth Player needs a Chameleon piece, point is that the Armor Prefix is not nearly as important as the Type, and the associated Major/Minor modifiers.
---
Heavy Combat Armor with the BOS mod is hard to beat for overall DR/ER, Marine is also very good, and Trapper Armor also has Rad resistance, even Leather Armor has some advantages with it's High ER.
---
Modifiers are the real Key to a great armor set, Cavalier's (Sprinting), or Sentinel's (Standing Still) can mitigate 75% of incoming Damage, combined with Special Perks that mitigate Damage can give you a fighting chance, but that only means you can survive 1-2 shots/hits in most PVP situations. Weight Reduction Perks are also great for those who like to carry more, and frees up some of the points needed in strength to give added carry capacity.
---
All of this is meant to convey that Best is a very subjective matter depending on your individual Build and play style, personally I keep 2 complete Armor sets. (1 for PVE, and another for PVP).
---
The reward is already out :) It’s the Easter Bunny head in the armor work bench!
---
(Deathclaw babies would have been fun though!)
---
lawyer would laugh him out of the office
---
Oh damn hah...thought it was tomorrow. I picked up my last egg this morning,.
---
Okay thanks
---
Yes, it is Like you say.
---
I am considering making a big sign at my CAMP entrance that reads "right perks?" Or something.
---
Harvesting plants, cooking, harvesting some Wood, encountering surprisingly many enemies, searching that chem stash but having to pick that lock First ....hmm what about a Silo Run?
---
Different cards for every.single.action.
---
I think only one queen spawns
---
Your account should be banned here too, for promoting chargeback fraud.
---
I've been having the same thing to recently.  I've been avoiding going ik inside there until it gets resolved next patch.  I have 76 on PC too but I'm unable to check it out over there in the mean time
---
Im not losing my whole armour set but like 3 days in a row now ive lost random parts to my excavator armour each day, and just now i lost my right leg on my t51, the pieces just disappear without a trace, 4 days in a row now Im getting kinda triggered
---
Let *me* worry about how I want to play the game.
---
It got pushed back to early May
---
true, I didnt think of that. well if you add them or not, thank you for making the calculator
---
It wasn't ready, so it was delayed to the next patch.
---
i got the egg when it dropped, yesterday at 8PM Est
---
Vampires shotgun, just blast away and you will almost never have to use a stealth pack while having all 3 pylons active on you.
---
If players could build camps together and not far away. Imagine: player built diamond city 
---
(Or just a really big town)
---
I would be happy if we could just break apart larger increments into smaller ones and then respec or allow for an alternative spec option. 
---
As a lvl 169 I’m running 2 specs at once (shotgun and auto rifle) but would be nice to have a melee option or non auto rifle option without having to blow up my perk build
---
There’s nothing that pops up saying what the reward is, but check your armor workbench
---
Given that planting season is generally in the summer (and so is our Nuclear Winter expansion) I could see some additional Green-House/Thumb expansion. It could give us the green-house set plan, access to new planters such as 2x2, 1x2, 1x1, hanging, pots, etc. Maybe even some form of small pool of water for stuff such as tarberries and snaptail. Given how the Nuclear Winter will probably hike up our food and water needs, I could see something like "Ready your crops and stock up for the winter".
---
Time has been flying by quick, I swear Christmas was just like last week.
---
Well damn. Glad to know at least!  Is the damage boost of having Gladiator apply enough to have the meat hook outclass a DG or PF in damage by a substantial margin?
---
Why do you make these I'm a cheater posts?
---
Pretty sure all the Nuka Cola cups at Camden park are CLOTH and not plastic. So are the hot dog buns and such....unless you are referring to some other cups
---
Scrap or sell them.  Forget legendaries.  I’ll bet I have 30 perk cards/points I’ll never use but someone else may be able to.
---
Wasn’t that a feature in fallout 4? If so, it seems it should be doable in 76. Maybe in a future update...
---
Thinking the eggs were actually going to hatch is kind of silly IMO. If you've had a tamed creature or ever played FO4 and seen the way NPCs had pathing issues then you'd know that would be a disaster. Eggs planted in weird spots and things getting spawned under foundations and on roofs.
---
Sugar Bombs! Diabetes.
---
Even being able to save one (additional) appearance would be huge, but I find it hard to care until they display character names rather than (or in addition to) account names.
---
Spotlights have been broke since fallout 4 in 2015. This is the company we're working with.
---
I’d like some more post apocalyptic gear, like road sign axes and armor plates, tire pauldrons, chain flails and junk spear mods.
---
I use the Gatling gun for PVE high damage per shot, then when it comes to the queen I use the 50cal high damage fast damage big magazine size 
---
Pvp I spray and pray with a 50cal aswell
---
I just noticed last night when you move stacked items to/from the stash, in the "quantity" pop-up menu, the highlighted item will change if the mouse moves up/down before going to the quantity menu. So I'd be trying to move one item, and another item gets moved instead.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if you can accidentally sell another item to a vendor because of this.
---
Ok I'm on team patch 8 sucks.  I also got two mutations in two days in PA fighting lvl 1 ghouls taking over the junk yard workshop.  I'd gone months with no mutations.  Lucky for me they are ones I wanted ok like marsupial.  But something changed for sure at my lower lvl char got talons this weekend, too, fighting in PA she just got at lvl 25.
---
I think there should just be a whole new section of the inventory for food and drink, separate from aid. Also remove holos and notes and throw them into the data section like it used to be. And condense the main, side, daily and events into one list with dividers.
---
Damn ghouls sure don't have pathing issues tho :-/
---
Yeah, well, the rest of us are sick of the arms race that just destroys any sense of economy in the game, and makes it a constant "one upmanship".
---
So, it kind of affects how we play the game, too.,
---
This!
---
deals less damage?
---
that's called being weaker.
---
You missed a bunch, I have gotten as much as 478 lead Ore from Lucky Hole in 1 run in Excavator PA.
---
478 Smelted = 2390 Lead, SnallyGasters and Abraxo are my main Acid supplies.
---
Mods can fix it sort of better inventory is the name goes of it
---
Yeah, I fail to see why they can't do this like ESO, and let the player decide if they want "GT" or "Character" names to take precedence. Both are still displayed... just one is more obvious.
---
I wouldn't mind the card shuffle if I could save some sets and have a one-click swap, and I like that the card system allows experimentation, but I just died to the sheepsquatch yesterday partially due to forgetting to switch back from my ammo-crafting set.
---
Honestly, I'm slowly quitting the game because aside from looting for looting, there's no end game on wich you can use them.  
---
So imo 1* or 3* or 6* I don't care.
---
If you're planning to move to heavy weapons I would advise being a PA user.  Unless your using the gatling having stabilized is a god send for heavy weapons like the 50 cal and mini gun.
---
Personally I dont use minigun but a 50 cal is a great support weapon due to its fire right and dmg.
---
But if you're sticking with gatling gun, which has higher damage whilst paired with a slow rate of fire, you dont need stabilized since that gun is pretty accurate and really devasting.
---
One downside is if you don't plan on complementing you heavy gun with PA you cant get the armor penetration that stabilized brings. Of course nothing like an anti armor gatling cant fix so there shouldn't be an issue.
---
And s ik nce you're thinking about transitioning over to heavy weapons can I point you over to the lucky hole mine?  Really helps combat the ammo c consumption of your guns especially with the excavator arms.
---
True.
---
Edit: My reasoning for simple damage increases is that it would free up for example a rifleman perk card, and these legendary perks wouldn’t affect your special slots.

You are comparing the wrong letters/answer. You compare Waters with Wasted, but u should compare both seperatly to the answer. Example:
---
Answer:  Shines
---
Word 1: Wat**e**r**s**  = 2 letters match
---
Word 2: Wa**s**t**e**d = 2 letters match
---
See how the "W" and the "A" had nothing to do with the answer? But your mind is thinking: "the only letters that could possible match is "W" and "A" so the answer can't be Shines.
---
Also seeing the sentence: " Something like Speeches" is that the examples you gave are not real world examples, but simply made up. If you can come with some real examples we can show u that the letters do actually match with the likeness to the answer.
---
Welcome to multiplayer, sweetheart.
---
I'd say more, but then I think I over loaded my list with pistols and shotgun types XD
---
Plastic:
---
[Morgantown High School](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1168) and the cat lady house north west of [Bolton Greens](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1163) are great for an easy low lvl run.  I can get 150 plastic if no one has plundered before me.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Lead:
---
Set up CAMP by a lead deposit.  [FO76 Map](https://fo76map.com/) has lead deposits on the map.  Click on the Hide All button and only select Lead under Resources. You can go to any gym and loot the weights.  [Charleston Fire Department](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1035), [Camp Venture](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1129), [Vault Tec University](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1169), and [Green Country Lodge](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1237) have weights in them.  Tin Can Traps are also a good source of like 7 lead if you loot them.
---
Shotgun Shells:
---
Go to [Blackwater Mine](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=1306), kill and loot all the Mole Miners.  They all pretty much carry shotguns and shells.  Try to use a melee weapon for maximum yield.
---
Do you always only understand the bits that are convenient to you?
---
Standard 50cal = hardened 308. Same damage, much cheaper ammo.
---
its not a glitch, the packs are completely random.
---
Damn 😢
---
My buddy wanted to buy the game, i told him to be prepared for lots of wasted time and disappointments especially for endgame bosses, he was like lol wtf kind of game is this, I told him a while back Bethesda promised to remove certain garbage from loot, he said ok let me know when they actually do it.
---
Ammosmith, Super Duper, and Bandolier fixed this problem for me
---
even as a level 80 it is.
---
im planning to help people with a major boon with this during dxp though.
---
if your on PS4 hit me up, im planning to bring 1k alum and 1500 steel to the ammo dump this weekend and letting everyone who wants in farm the vertibird for over 600+ xp a kill.
---
Oh, well I'm still pretty impressed with that build, you've probably seen mine and the mess that it is, and damn a plan to solo the sheepsquatch? I can barely even survive while being one or two conduits, keep forgetting health exists!
---
And damn, not to sure about the mutations in PA, I never instantly chucked on 2 ranks of starched genes when I could, and I didn't really get into using PA for a while, only carried Excavator incase I was carrying too much and X-01 just for nuke zones. Might be worth just reporting that bug to Bethesda with mutations in PA, if it is a bug that's the question.
---
Though some bugs they gotta fix is missiles, Mini nukes or MIRV just disappearing mid air and not exploding/impacting. So many times have I launched a missile and the thing just hits the enemy doing next to no damage, still must be harsh to get a missile to the face though XD
---
But hell, wish you luck in finding a good way to chuck on Starched genes while maintaining a build like that you've got up there, that's some real power of a build!
---
So when he’s invisible is is legit invincible? 
---
I assumed so however the intro says activate the conduits to disable stealth mode not invincibility mode. 
---
(No worried I don’t actually attack him while he’s invisible, just curious)
---
lies, or you're hacking your cache to hold infinite crap
---
You couldn't even change your appearance in 4 without a surgeon or a barber. There were presets but they were just that. I don't remember this feature and I played a ton.
---
It seems like all the good small company’s are being bought out by larger shittier company’s (I.e Bethesda)
---
Imagine if obsidian made an Elder scrolls game...
---
Can we just ping all the Bethesda employees on here, I know people like myself complain about Flamers being unusable because of the scarcity of ammo, but goddammit just do something about it.
---
can i suggest reworking your camp and dedicating the bottom floor to a garden? making the middle of it open will let you garden to your hearts content and have a liveable space upstairs. you can even seperate the 2 with outside and inside staircases
---
Answer: Shines
---
Word: W**in**n**e**r = likeness of 3 to the actual password
---
Why are you even comparing Waters to Winner? Waters is not the answer, so there is no need to compare them.
---
While they do not seem to be as common as they were at the Whitesprings, they do seem to be in the bog from scorched and other mobs there during nuke events.
---
This time...
---
It works.
---
Unyielding is op for melee. There's no armour that will save you in pvp other than assasin sentinel or cav, all the damage reduction in pvp comes from perks if you dont have that set. If I didnt run low health I guess I would use random pieces with ap refresh, bolstering or whatever I could find.
---
you were team killed
---
Yeah I wasn’t sure, I’m  thinking of a different games character creator. But yeah, it would be nice if they implemented something like that on 76
---
You can be killed in adventure mode if your teammate starts pvp with another player/group you don’t actually need to attack anyone to be considered hostile
---
I agree
---
Did you take any public workshops? People can put you into PvP by contesting your workshop, even if you're not in the build zone.
---
\-Single Action Revolver (reloads like your character has 2 left hands and 10 thumbs... seriously just pull the animation from New Vegas for reference)
---
Hah. Self fulfilling prophecy… darling.
---
Had the game not been flooded with duped bullshit and 3* legendaries, the economy wouldn't be fucked, and a 1* would be a good find.  It's pretty simple to see how it works.
---
But you do you.
---
Not to sure but I carry a mmg why not just have both
---
workshops. if you own one you are opening yourself to PVP.
---
That it. PVP me and my junkie's mutant's nocturnal lvl5 pipe wrench that I got off a lvl 6000 alpha scorched ultracite scorched beast queen. YOURE GONNA BE SORRY
---
I will do me, thank you.
---
True that's why I go for the miner gauntlet when it comes to looks
---
Yeh I would like to see more Heavy weapons added
---
I leveled a secondary character on a second account so I'd be able to use 2 accounts to do lots of neat stuff. One neat thing is that I didn't do the BoS quest line, so I can keep as many tech data on that character as I want. Currently sitting at 50+ tech data, going to turn them in one by one on by handing them to my main and then turning in on him once I get to 100.
---
Even with all the perks and great procs on super duper, you can farm for 12 hours a day just to use the LMG for 2 minutes... and then the base damage is so low that killing anything other than trash mobs is just not worth it.
---
Can't tell you the number of times I forgot to switch out Hard Bargain with Lone Wanderer. I actually get embarrassed by it every time, even though I  play solo.
---
For sure. It was too convenient and suspicious. But its not worth fighting against because those types of players are rare and there's nothing to lose/gain in this game. Especially if they add instanced dungeons later on.
---
I've mutated from a level 3 ghoul hitting me, don't know where you got 5+ rads from.
---
Gamma gun needs some love, they need to buff the physical/main damage
---
Awesome
---
D ok not forget you could also make people slaves in fallout 3.  Easiest 125c I ever made.
---
But Legendary items vanish as well.  You can't scrap those.
---
:/ rip
---
Thumbs up for &lt;insert bullshit excuse here&gt;
---
High radiation fluid has always been the rarest for me.
---
However i fought the sbq yesterday and after i was getting loads of it. Which was nice
---
"We've listened to the community and are happy to announce Inventory Sorters^tm coming soon to the Atom Shop!" -Bethesda probably.
---
I built concrete under the water and can't delete it now.  Any advice on how to get rid of the concrete?
---
I just want it to reload like a real single action gate fed revolver.  Not whatever the hell is going on now.  It reloads more like a western themed, mentally challenged, wrist strength building exercise.
---
It's more that they increased the drop rate of hardened / glowing mass, but left fluid the same. I farmed 400 glowing / hardened mass over the weekend and I only got about 200 high rad fluid. Thankfully I have a bunch muled and I'm not really in any need of flux right now but... I normally just make flux and stockpile it for when I'm ready to craft ammo. And stable flux weighs a hell of a lot less than the combined weight of it's ingredients. Would be nice if we had an equal drop rate.
---
On the plus side, I'll have lots of glowing / hardened mass to vendor, though I usually have no issue capping out my vendor sales every day with stockpiled Rad-X, Ionized Meat, etc.
---
About how you are crying because you don't understand how to read and thought the email bethesda sent to glorf mentioned duping in anyway, even though the email never once said anything about duping. So I've been taking the piss out of you for being dumb enough to make such an easily disproven claim. 
---
Hell, I even gave you opportunities to show some proof that he duped, and you couldn't offer any, other than "He had more ammo than you know how to craft in a 30 day period" Yet, well trusted and highly active member of this community even came in and explained to you that the amount of ammo he had was well within the amounts a person could collect at the time.
---
So I mean I tried to give you a chance to make your argument, yet you ended up just being hung up on the ammo amounts because you yourself don't know the game well enough to farm the mats to make that much ammo in that time frame. 
---
Meanwhile, I offered links showing that he wasn't banned in the first place, he was suspended. If he was caught duping he would have been banned, not suspended. It is obvious you don't know what you are talking about with this whole situation because you try to claim he duped yet the email even said he was only suspended, if he was caught duping bethesda wouldn't have given a suspension, but would have given a ban like they did to those that they actually did catch duping.
---
So TL:DR you don't know what you are talking about, so I've been having fun drawing out your ignorance and getting you to put your lack of knowledge about this whole situation out in public for everyone to see.
---
I'm afraid I must have traded it, sorry
---
I do see the \*SOME\* in the title and agree with the theory, the Legendary aspect is just fresh as I lost a weapon this weekend.
---
Had this happen with the impostor sheepsquatch. And we're supposed to throw 2k caps away to do this?
---
Great so, once a month all they have to do is put together the most bland insipid holiday package and you’re happy. You’re probably excited for the camera. Me too, I always thought this game could use, like, a photomode. 
---
Its not that it’s Easter. It’s weak, weak content. Atom shop or not. Yeah I bought that armor- it’s been like the Only atomshop piece that fits a normal fallout theme and the world.
---
If you're running an anti-armor weapon (50%) and Max level incisor 
---
(75%) you'lll notice it doesn't help much. If you're not running AA weaponry, you really need max incisor. Sacrificing martial artist for more damage is essentially asking *is it better to have high DPS or high one-strike damage?* which is a matter of what enemy you're fighting. I'd personally never consider gimping Martial artist. Blocker is pretty helpful depending on your other Damage Resistance perks and if you're planning on wearing power armor.
---
lol I'll happily buy high radiation off you if your selling
---
AHH no worries then..I got mine from top of world plan spawn points and treasure map
---
What was your rad resist? And when did this occur? I believe even basic ghouls do 5+ rad damage if you don’t have any rad resist. And especially if they give you rad worms.
---
All I know is pre patch-8, I had no issues if I was wearing power armor, and I’ve been playing since BETA. Now I’ve acquired multiple mutations while in P.A. since patch 8. That’s a change, be it bug or stealth intentional adjustment.
---
The rank 1 of science feels really strange because no other perk in the game works that way. You can craft heavy combat armor with no perks, and you don't need rank 1 gunsmith to make basic guns. 
---
I guess it just really baffles me why they bothered to level gate science like they did when gunsmith and makeshift warrior work the way they do. To top it off, you don't even need any perks to modify the Gatling laser, which is basically the only viable laser weapon.
---
Found that out the hard way: a friend and I took an unowned workshop and then walked away, then later, when we were across the map, a 100+ level player comes up, acting all friendly with the emotes, then slays us with what appeared to be an explosive black powder rifle. He said in area-chat "Thanks for the caps" and bounced his marsupial ass away...
---
Seems that since the PvP cap nerf from the last patch that griefers are looking for easier, 'more profitable' ways of gaining caps.
---
but they are an item in a list/inventory system that is so buggy that apparently the bugs are making the impossible possible sometimes
---
Exactly
---
You can get that mask in the safe room of the ruined bank by the train yard in near Whitesprings. The one with all the robots. YouTube “Fasnacht Man Mask”
---
I'm going to add that the learn rate on Radium Rifle scraps is just too damn low. If this weapon was the holy grail of ranged, I'd understand, but it's not.
---
They will probably monetize the 3 stars in a subtle way soon.
---
Yeah, I don’t think most people noticed because everyone just uses starched genes, but I loved the fact that as long as I was in P.A., I didn’t have to keep starched genes on.
---
Are you sure that's what we were talking about?
---
No didn't have any workshops, had just logged in and started my rounds.
---
Lots of good comments here, but don't forget to rank up and use Fireproof, I used to kill myself regularly before getting it.

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
Hahahahahah
---
Thanks. I think you're right. Sucked but its all part of the game, I guess.
---
Bloodied or AA sickle with swing speeds are very badass.
---
I stopped playing for a few months, come back and everybody's running around with twoshot explosive shit, kinda disheartening to see. I'd be happy with pretty much any decent two star combat shotty and rifle at this point.
---
as far as i know they dont get they should not get assasins sentinel effect on the head since there isnt such armor isnt that right?
---
Even after the nerf they are still very good but behind BE and AAE ofc.
---
We have a fix for this with Grognak's Axe currently planned for Patch 9 in May!
---
We have a fix in patch 8.5 tomorrow that should help address this.
---
Man I got sick eating morels a few months ago, undercooked ones wreck you’re stomach.
---
Yeah, they're exploiting an in-game mechanic to take your shit. 
---
Douchenozzles, basically. Making the game shitty for everyone else.
---
Not a terrible issue, I know, but I would still like to see the single action reload animation reworked so that it reloads like normal humans would, rather than 10 thumbed aliens with multiple left hands.
---
I’d like to see Legendary Players have the ability to Prestige their perks so it increases the properties they currently have without affecting the point cost to apply them (Bloody Mess Rank 3 = +15% damage. Prestige Bloody Mess = +25% damage).
---
Another way of prestigious progression I’d like to see is a “passives” deck maximum of 10 “Legendary Points” that would allow passive perks like lockpick and hacker to apply to builds without reworking our min maxing or damaging the build for a tedious and temporary swap out
---
(Using Lockpick + Expert Lockpick costs 2 Legendary points leaving 8 Legendary points left for use) Perks that affect item weight may pass as passive but perks that affect player stats like Starched Genes and Ironclad would not pass as they change the balance of a player’s survival I.e resisting/inflicting damage
---
As a heavy gun user I do appreciate things like this since it helps me focus more on the queen when she lands and can spray all those bullets onto her face.
---
I can see where the displeasure of seeing a low lvl in scorched earth comes from (lord knows I get upset when I see a lvl 25 there) but if you're able to clear adds and pick me up when I get down, it ensures that I can still keep doing constant damage in the queen and makes me happy knowing that a scorched with a pitchfork isnt banging me in the back of my head
---
7. so like an armour stand in minecraft?
---
Well it’s just because the robot has a female body structure and voice, also, people call animals “her” regardless of the animals sex, and I was trying not to spoil that the final boss isn’t the actual sheepsquatch.
---
We're planning to include a fix for this in Patch 8.5 tomorrow!
---
What I might recommend is expanding your circle. The nuke silo isn't nearly as bad when you have a couple other people that have done it before to come and get you when you get turned around. 
---
The other recommendation is to not rely entirely on in-game chat. I've been in a full group of randoms but our team chat cut out the moment we loaded into the silo. 
---
Being on Xbox I find myself in the xbox group chat. Used to bother me that it locks me out of in-game chat. My workaround is to use the xbox app with my ipad to connect for xbox chat, and have my headset freed up for in-game area chat. (took a little getting used to having a earphone in under my headset)
---
What you and your son might do is to have a plan to connected over cell phone or skype as a backup.
---
ADDS before DADS make the party GLADS. 
---
Was one of my old guilds motto. I don’t care if you’re level 1 in the SBQ, so long as you’re a team player, I’d welcome ya. Revive, aggro pull, all worthy time sinks for the higher level people who can DPS.
---
but its not only that since i have perks for that hes basicaly the same build but always gets me even when im sneaked up on him and shoot 10 bullets before him i do lower him to 1 hp and thats all... while he haves time even after a whole mag to insta kill me with the same weapon? thats just not possible idk
---
Yeah I only did it because I know why way around the game and can kind of make up for being a low level with my gear and perks lol
---
Awesome still
---
Essentially, you can take it on and off and wear it. Just want somewhere to display my cool / rare outfits and armor rather than in a box.
---
Yeah, I kinda had to rethink my perks to run SG2.  But I like the mutations, so it's worth it I guess
---
Right on my main so many people ignore the adds and befor long there are like hundreds of them. I actually have a zelots tesla on one of my characters that's an amazing add clearer
---
yeah but thats not what im struggling with because i also do that damage on a simliar equiped pllayer and he dosnt die but when i get attacked im a 1hit death
---
I really hope Helmut is ok :/
---
B/Vats or B/Nerd can melt him fast enough that people get mad because they didn't get a hit in before he goes down.  
---
It's really people being unwilling to hit pylon that costs everybody stimpacks and wastes time.
---
It could have been anything. But it’s Another giant head. Go ahead, be excited.
---
I’m excited for all the upcoming content in the game. It’s more things for us to do at no extra cost. They’ve given us a pretty clear roadmap of what’s to come, so there’s no reason to be expecting some huge Far Harbor or Nuka-World sized DLC.
---
Two shot explosive stuff is like third tier weaponry. But you cant seriously be proposing that leaving the game you expected to keep up with people who were still playing it, right? Because otherwise your comment makes no sense.
---
Just bopped to where you wasted an SBQ ... didn't see where you were on the map or I'd have waited. I'll be on the map poking things with a stick for a while.
---
I think you may have confused the conversation with me. Which is disturbing if you're wrong in so many situations, that you can no longer keep track of how you were wrong, and in which misguided conversations the wrong statements were made.
---
Do you know who Bethesda is? I'm having my doubts, because you keep saying that **I** called him a duper, when it was someone from Bethesda who said he was.
---
Do you think I'm Bethesda? Have you had a concussion? Do you suffer from a dissociative disorder? Is this a cry for help?
---
Harpoon Gun can not 1 Shot Scorch... it needs a serious buff for how annoying Harpoon Bolts are.
---
But do you have the coveted Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Gun?
---
Insert any excuse in their and it will fit
---
Lol bot made it funny
---
They shouldn't....but they do.
---
Been using a lobber no legendaries, works pretty well. Though I’ve been running my heavy gunner as of late and just blow through most ADDS. Honestly the XP rate there is astounding. I just never have enough ammo and have to resort to my slower Gatling gun.
---
May 7th - Player Vending &amp; Ever Upwards(backpacks?) questline, if the roadmap changes, people will chime in with the changes pretty quickly
---
It seems that people are coming to the more known sites (like the Greenbrier aka Whitesprings)
---
Haha.  
---
Can't disagree, but I think this would fall under quality of life!
---
I play with a group of people (7-10) on a regular basis. We have room in our flock for someone looking to get into end game, even if some of us are well beyond that phase. 
---
PSN = MyTurkishPrison
---
Can you learn the lobber mod or is it only found as a mod box?
---
No problem, hope it helps out! Remember to use super duper as well if you have it unlocked, will give you even more stims when crafting
---
Holy shit. I never realized the slanted wall pieces could be used like that. This is game changing.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'm not using any targeting hud. Just running around in my standard level 45 excavator armour.
---
That and the Assault rifle is ugly as hell. They really should have called it a Machinegun and had a G3 as the Assault Rifle.
---
I believe in Fo4 there was the Mighty legendary perk, which just added a solid 25% extra damage (I think that should be dropped down a bit, so maybe 15% or 10%) to you base weapons damage. Those types of legendary effects would be nice, since it won't make the weapon overly power, and the only way to increase damage is by the respective perk cards plus bloody mess and sneak attacks, and if the 25% extra damage is reduced, it'll just basically do a little more damage than it's normal counterpart, but also won't displace effects like Two shot, Instigating or Executioners.
---
Now legendary effects like as you said -5% from explosions would be great, since there are builds that mitigate Explosive damage, but that doesn't make them OP, just don't take explosive damage.
---
Though with legendary effects, I want effects like Violent (more damage, but 25% recoil, which for balancing sake, make it a 50% more recoil, to prevent high DPS guns from using it too much) and Plasma infused (adds plasma damage) or incendiary (add fire damage) or wounding (adds bleeding damage) or Irradiating (adds radiation damage) and Defiant (final shot in the magazine does twice the damage, but this perk shouldn't work on weapons such as the Harpoon gun, all of the Blackpowder weapons and any weapons that can only store one of its respective ammunition at a time). Hopefully these will be reintroduced when we get weapons that can have 4-5 stars, excluding the sacrifical machete and Scorch killer receivers.
---
With adding more perk point? I don't think that's good, since it caps at 50, it means everyone has only 50 points to use which is balanced between all players, having 52 or 52 points over other that don't isn't fair, since maybe with those extra 3 points they may add a perk to avoid more damage. Having 50 points would mean you have to chose what you want, and sacrifice some cards over others.
---
with legendary players, I believe it should be the same how a normal legendary you kill, it drops some loot (in this case the legendary players junk) and the game auto generates a random legendary. The legendary won;t be of any kind on the players inventory, nor will it be one of the other players legendary, but if you kill a legendary player, the game should just automatically slap a random legendary in you inventory, to prevent the legendary player who was killed from quickly coming back and looting a new legendary from their death, so how when you finish the SBQ, the game gives you always a 2\* legendary armour piece (wait if the game can do that why can't it secure a 2\*-3\* for the SQB and Impostor sheepsquatch corpse?? \*tinfoil hat time\*)and puts it directly in your inventory and not on the SBQ corpse.
---
To prevent farming of this, when a Legendary player is killed, he should lose his legendary entitlement and have is original level (So like lvl105-&gt;3\* Legendary 50(the amount of stars may be affected by what your level is)-&gt;Death by other player-&gt;lvl105).
---
To prevent the player from just jumping back to being legendary, he should have a cool down of maybe 2-3 days, meaning that a legendary player is to some degree rare(not have a whole server full of legendaries, so there is more competition to find one and kill one.
---
Those are my general thoughts and stuff (sorry if it's a lot to read hehe)
---
I was going to sell them a while ago, but something told me "meh, you might need those at some point". Glad I kept them. Hopefully my excess will cover my farming shortfalls until BGS adjusts the ratio.
---
The game seems to treat anything above 80% as full health, I use Instigating weapons almost exclusively, and they work very well in PVP except on the Bloodied build players, for those I use the Radium Rifle or Gamma Gun.
---
The harpoon gun is still too weak for its mag size.
---
This is going to sound counterintuitive, but if you want to take over workshops, play on the survival servers.  Your location is only flagged if you are in the top 3 for kills so you can remain hidden.  You are easy to find on the  adventure servers.
---
I don't think they even spawn with legendary effects either.
---
That's also a big reason why nobody uses them.
---
Each and every time I play It blows my mind that Aid isn’t split into food, water and chems.
---
That and sort by wt shows only unit weight!
---
Let it spoil and turn it into fertilizer, bulk it and sell it to players/vendors
---
I’d go with too comment that never happens with me and I play a lot using a mobile hotspot at less than 1mbps
---
yeah prob best to just hold them
---
Basically you have to craft things to farm caps. Even if you can't make marine tactical helmets and mutation serums, you should be picking up meat off of enemies and cooking it. Because crafting is usually involved, Super Duper is an important perk for making money
---
I don't even think you can get a Chainsaw at any level other than 20.
---
Whitesprings is perfect for this. Imagine walking into an actual store that has manikins posing with clothing on, statues that you can preview, etc. I don't know why, but yes, I'd be far more willing to spend atoms them. As is I hoard them and never use them.
---
can you destroy it or have someone else destroy it?  It'll technically still be there, just non-repaired.
---
They said Flamer and Cryo ammo was going to be fixed in next patch several times.
---
Almost constantly since I have Healing Factor.  Even before it I'd heal up to full health between combats just to consume aid items to reduce weight.
---
Ooh, how about the mesmetron? Let me stun other players without doing any damage to annoy them!
---
Does anyone know if there will be legendary crafting (picking/adding effects to base weapons) or will it be like a legendary roulette?
---
You're right, I didnt think OP was doing anything with workshops I just assumed so if they're taking workshops yes, but if they're not taking them then there is no risk what so ever really
---
They could give you a three star, but make you pay atoms to unlock the 2nd and 3rd legendaries.
---
Off the top of my hat...
---
* Gauss Pistol as seen in Fallout 2;  
---
* The .223 Pistol from Fallout 1 and 2;  
---
* The Bozar;  
---
* Pulse rifles; and  
---
* Some kind of ridiculous revolver chambered for .308 ammo.
---
That was my point, the question was whether that works.
---
Move camp just a little should take eveything off
---
I have a bit of a hoarding addiction. 2 accounts and multiple level 50+ "retired" characters with full weight reduction gear / perks means I have pretty much infinite mule space lol. I'll have thousands of legendary tokens whenever the vendor gets here.
---
I wasn't ever able to when it happened to me. I had to move my camp to get rid of it.
---
Maybe higher level players but since PvP is not my focus I know thats far down the list of priorities for me, at least.  Can't be the only one.
---
But as soon as you eat something you don't have full health anymore
---
I got a drill from a 3* ghoul last week, I went to take a photo on my phone just for the laugh and the fucking thing disappeared before I could get it done.  
---
Awesome.
---
You pulling adds and reviving fallen players keeps more DPS on the queen, which is the difference between a success and a wipe. Yes, those are greatly appreciated actions. In fact, I wish more low levels would start doing these things at Encryptid too, as they seldom ever take the pylons or help with adds in my experience and instead spend most of their time getting one shot by the imposter SS and calling for revives themselves.
---
Pretty sure it was a limited time event.
---
A nice practical way to get rid of Junk.
---
You'll probably have to provide exact examples/screenshots to get any traction with this. As it stands, I, and probably most people, are going to chalk it up to user error or incompetence.
---
When I'm speed farming nuked whitesprings it's just a constant annoyance taking up half of my screen. And it lags behind. I'll often be picking up the 2nd or 3rd legendary while the first is still displaying and rotating.
---
I've mutated from collecting water and I've gotten nothing from standing in a room full of toxic waste barrels in my underwear. The only definite rule I'm aware of regarding mutation is there's a time limit on the frequency per server. If you don't want it to happen use starched genes, that's what it's there for.
---
Could clip under the map to get the pieces then just pick up everything down thhere afterwards
---
Yeah I have done encrypted as well around like level 15 and 20 and I was holding a pylon because no one else was lol. What got me was some people took attention off the queen just to hit me with there weapons lol
---
Thanks for getting back to me. I bought them last night though.
---
Fine, you’ll be satisfied with anything. So if we suddenly start getting some inspired atomshop skins and something better than paying 2000 caps for a chance at a 3* legendary, you’ll still be happy. 👍🏻
---
*Shrug*
---
Mine was a loot drop, and it was starred for the lobber effect so honestly no idea.  Haven’t found enough to break down to find out.
---
Thanks for the info!  Although I'm sure with this legendary quest making this instigating fat man common people will build around defenses towards it, like Fireproof, as /u/Sherincal_of_Astora mentioned.
---
Might be an incidental nerf to your build unfortunately.
---
I wish that there had been some point to getting the Gold Perk cards.
---
Try hardwiring your internet connection instead of using WiFi and see if this solves it
---
&gt; The majority of us?
---
Well, I wasn't talking about "preferring it" like you talked.
---
I see you too are playing on console, just like others who bothered to disagree with words. 
---
Now Fallouts and Pipboy haven't exactly ever been nominated for industry awards for great interface for the stuff it does. It's clumsy, and slow. The online version is only slightly worse. You will spend lots and lots of time scrolling your inventory tabs up and down and in and out. Now on PC we got two things we can scroll simultaniously with. Both your mouse wheel which is fairly accurate, and arrow keys when you need to scroll first 40-60 items up or down, so then you can use both and it scrolls faster.
---
I don't know but I'm guessing it's quite slower on console if you only have one kind of control of scroll up and down? I mean it's not great on PC, like I said, but it's still probably better. Keyboard arrow keys together with scroll wheel allow faster scrolling while then releasing the key allows fine control with the mouse wheel.
---
Either way any real improvement would require major redesign. Not this minor suggested change.
---
I can vouch for that, but Bethesda just don't have it. 
---
Best example is the insane key system. They had somewhat okay system on F3. They made it significantly worse for F4. They kept doing updates to F4 for years, they made new versions which I'm guessing still use the completely stupid system as original. And never during all those years, they got the idea how it's bad and pointless. So they kept it as it in here. Why mess with perfection? You practically have no reason to have keys as separate items, because you can't interact with them. You just keep scrolling over and over them.
---
I had to get him replaced unfortunately, ill never forget you excavator hemut #1
---
For me they’re all mixed up; doesn’t seem to be a pattern at all
---
U can still pick them all up quick! They are in the atom shop still ;)
---
Thanks i will check :D
---
They want to team up with you, so that they can kill you, steal your junk and wreck your for camp. Don't talk to strangers.
---
Thanks i will give it a look :D
---
Cryolator still super difficult to get ammo for.
---
All energy weapons still do not have Anti armor mods or perks
---
I think I still need two more to get the Paladin plan, which is my goal.  Don't even really want the Elder one, may not bother to try after getting Paladin.
---
Will do! Thanks!
---
I don't think it matters.  I tried using luck armor and luck boosts for a while, now I just stay in PA and turn them in and I've gotten 3-4 of the higher level ones since then.
---
I don't want to keep up per se, i'd rather not have a TSE myself as it's not my character's style, just a decent weapon that is relevant to me. It's just the lack of creativity and RP that bugs me, people just want to kill as much as they can as quickly as possible and with the least effort. 
---
Had an Enclave event the other day to protect the bots, some guy rocks up after a few minutes in his power armour and starts spraying with his TSE oneshotting everything, it's kinda pointless me joining in at that point so I just stood there and let him do his thing. Luckily those occurrences are pretty rare as I generally don't cross paths with other players, but it just makes me think why bother?
---
GREATEST. DAY. EVER.
---
This isn’t how credit card chargebacks work. 
---
You can do it, and your bank will likely give you the funds immediately, but Bethesda will have the opportunity to dispute the chargeback—and in cases like this, they’re going to win. 
---
After that, at best, your bank will take the funds back, often adding additional fees. At worst, they’ll take the money back, charge fees and close your account.
---
They didn't just tweet it thought there was the [inside the vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019) 
---
they might have just delete the tweet to get rid of the responses since you cant reply to their article.
---
No one but the camp owner can destroy items
---
I was paranoid. I server hopped until I found a pretty empty server.  Got a lot of XP though, and it definitely kept me busy 😁
---
Good ol' Mr. 900 Hours...
---
I'll give this game a pass for a lot of things, but nothing sets me off like a failed nuclear reactor more than getting a fucking drill.
---
Isn't the meat hook glitched at the moment?
---
Lol you can't do a charge back this late.
---
Nah they'll sell buffs in the store that 'increase the chance' of getting 2 or 3 stars.
---
Sorry friend, the only way I've been able to remove is to replace camp. You're able to reset it in the exact same spot if you like. Thankfully resetting your structures isn't as hopeless as it once was.
---
I literally just did this yesterday with my new build, thankfully I wasn't far into it.
---
For every person there, the queen gets stronger. LVL 30 characters usually shouldn't be there because they have neither the perks or weapons to contribute to damaging compared to the increase she receives. The queen is actually quite a simple event that with the right people and weaponry, she can be taken down in less than 5min, but lower lvls joining the fight and not adding dmg but boosting hers is what makes others use more ammo and resources, and even occasionally fail the event because she becomes too difficult to beat.
---
The people at the event don't know if you're a LVL 30 with good guns, being able to hold your own. They don't see you clearing the mobs and reviving everyone when they go down (although higher lvls shouldn't really go down during a queen fight anyway), because they concentrate on the queen.
---
They just think you're just another low LVL trying to get a free ride and costing them ammo and resources.
---
People were cheating to get the codes?
---
You can already own a Brahmin and milk it. It's the fertilizer producer you can build in your camp.
---
Dude this post didn’t take off because these are all bad ideas or stuff that exists. There’s no point breaking them each down. Look at 18. You already can.
---
It does.
---
I started playing this game around christmas....and there was a nuke being dropped multiple times , every time i played.
---
Its pretty rare now. Sometimes ill wait on a server if i see someone at a silo. But usually theyre farming something i guess
---
Yeah. I haven't seen a ton of nukes lately either. It's a bummer.
---
Good idea! Thanks.
---
If you head to Drop Site V9 East of Watoga, once you approach there is a proximity trigger that spawns a scorchbeast at the fissure right next to Fissure Prime.  I usually hurry and kill the 3 scorched at V9 then snipe the scorchbeast before it can take off into the air each time.
---
I'm wondering if/when they will patch this?
---
it's not just the head, crits negate any form of damage mitigation. it's just more noticeable when it's on your head.
---
Wasn't aware, I haven't broke level 20 yet. My bad I'll edit that one out. That's not the only suggestion though 😂
---
Still outta town, but weren't the eggs only available one per day? How would I get the ones I missed yesterday and Saturday?
---
Well that's all true but waiting time hitting me is probably taking more dps away the I am just by being there. I have finished 3 queens at low level so I'm not one of the ones that just hide hoping to gain free stuff lol
---
40+ hours a week... Nice
---
I got a quad explosive harpoon gun. Its my primary weapon.
---
I also have a anti armor +400 resistance while reloading Broadsider that would be a perfect tank weapon if it actually had reasonable damage vs weight.
---
We launched two nukes last night on the same server.  Someone else launched a third nuke on the queen.  The main issue I see is the lagginess when trying to kill the SBQ.  I got kicked once and a team mate got kicked 7 times.  Constant freezes, etc.  This is on pc.
---
I agree. Most players I meet are polite and courteous. I've met only a few who aren't
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
Yeah, I think that guy was probably a bit of a douche.
---
Sorry I didn't know! Thank you! I edited the post.
---
Yeah, I hate that, not sure why but the Vendor bot seems to self destruct for some reason after a relatively short time.
---
I've launched three in the last 48hrs. I'm knackered.
---
Well we havent been given any other activities beyond killing as much as we can as quickly as we can.
---
word
---
I keep saying that pets would be a surefire way to suck the money right out of our wallets but **nooo**, apparently Bethesda hates insane profits.
---
something like dogmeat except they'd have absolutely no purpose at all. kinda like Diablo 3 but even more useless. just standing around being cute.
---
Pretty sure it's even less than what you pay for it from the vendor.  That's odd.
---
How about this Bethesda forget legendary enemies give us lunchboxes in the atom shop so I can spend hundreds of dollars for a chance to get legendary items to play a game that I have now idea why I’m still playing because it just feels like a waste of time atm.
---
Thing is if they are going with the group cause it's easier to have a bunch of people backing you up, they usually agree and just otherwise would have stayed silent. Way before the internet there used to be this saying that one angry letter to a company usually meant at least 10 more people thought the same thing (but weren't bothering to write a letter). Internet just makes those people willing to speak up. 
---
But to assure you, I'm not jumping on the bandwagon, non cosmetic microtransactions are the one thing I really hate in game design to make money. I'm fine with DLC, I'm fine with subs for online, I'm ok on cosmetic microtransactions (though I wasn't enthused that we could still work for them, I'd actually prefer that they be pay only but at a reasonable price). You can search my history to see how much I rail about them on GTA online (Even from the very beginning when most people didn't see why they were a bad thing and Rockstar was much better about being subtle about it).
---
As for having the repair kits not be added yet, I'm not waiting for them to do it. They already announced they plan on doing it, they have not said they are not going to (and with the backlash there is absolutely no reason for them to be silent if they changed their mind) and have pointedly ignored all the people talking about it on a forum where they have been pretty good at responding. To the point there is no way that is accidental. So, I really think it's foolish to htink they aren't absolutely planning on doing this. At best they may push back the date to let people forget the furor but unless they say they are not going to do it, I'm taking them at their word that they are going to do it. And it is easier to get a company to back off on something before they do it than afterwards.
---
I still play Fallout 76, but Bethesda won't see a dime from me on the atom store unless they backtrack on the repair kits being available on the atom store.
---
Isnt the game broken for nukes or something
---
You don't understand how hard it is to do that when item inventory is stored individually, item by item, in an array. /s
---
I've been seeing them every time I've been in a server. Whitespring was hit the other day I was on. Ps4.
---
Eh, kinda.  I mean I use the single action in my cowboy playthrough, and the fact that I can reload my real single action from a replica ammo belt thrice in the same time it takes my character to load his once with ammo appearing in his hand is rather sad.
---
How high did you get your luck? I'm sure you can get them without high luck, just that higher luck speeds things up. Had mine over 20
---
I do. This was a massive help, hank you
---
id like that too
---
PS4?
---
Admittedly I did the quest in a group, but we tried to take our time to read and listen. Despite taking a slow pace, I'm still not sure what the story was behind the waste management quest. 
---
I think I read that someone got fired due to automation and they sabotaged the robots? I'm not sure why sanitation had an assaultron? Even if that's the story, why does it mater since the robots weren't venturing out, and there's nobody in Hapers Ferry to benefit from restored sewer and/or water service? I'm not even running an errand for a robot. Nobody asked me to do that, did they?   
---
I guess it's all just getting a bit meaningless if we're not actually going to vanquish the scorch plague or rebuild the area.
---
Just fix the Grognak axe so it can be repaired past 100%.
---
Quit whining. Either play the game or don't.
---
I get it tho but I also know what I'm doing lol
---
Anyone else have any luck completing their Nocturnal wood armor set?   Super rare and coveted!!!!
---
Worse, it is ported from Fallout 4, which was ported from fallout 3, and has existed since about 2009.
---
I know there's tables for the most powerful weapon, I wonder what the absolutely worst legendary to exist is. I feel like gamma gun is probably up there.
---
It's like that so you can use different levels whenever needed, since you can't demote cards...
---
It's literally a damn intended part of the game, and people still make these posts.
---
I say you mad my good sir, a 3 star enemy dropping a 3 star is madness and whats next screws from scraping weapons and armor?
---
That is my Epic quest on Xbox to find a Quad Harpoon Gun. I don't think it's realisticly useable without Quad. [Non Stealth]
---
Quick addition after looking online, the chemist perk gives you double chems when crafting, so use that too. I don’t know if it stacks with super duper but it probably will
---
Who’s whining? It’s straight talk, and I’m calling a spade a spade. Lame content. Don’t like my take on things? Too bad, but your bunny hat on.
---
Those aren't the ones already showing as [owned]?
---
I’m adding you now with a couple of accounts to help with the fight!
---
I would help but I’m at work rn. But I’m always down for SBQ fight. Add me if y want Sleepz2184
---
I'll take them plans if they are still going? I'm on ps4
---
what about the Automatic grenade launcher's heavy barrel. in the description it says that it is suppose to increase damage and range, but as of right now, it is just a heavier long barrel with no damage increase
---
Lvl 291 bloodied build here, I need to focus on queen, not adds, I feel like that's my part in it. I need to be squishy to maximize damage, so absolutely is it helpful. If you're able to take em out or keep the damned things off, I'm extremely grateful.
---
I rarely need a revive, I just die dead mostly, but when I do, a kind revive always gets a heart from me (if timing is appropriate).
---
I'd be happy if while looking through cards to select the "Already Owned:" was reliably correct.  It is not. Some times it says nothing when you own 1,2, or 3 stars in that card already. Since I tend to get several levels before I go do the state and card updates-ask me how I got Rifleman 3 twice on my new sniper...
---
Ah, nope, Xbox. It's not the first time either
---
Diabeetus..
---
Rusty knuckles don't affect harvesting. I don't have them on my excavator set and I get four ore from every node.
---
You mean they should be polishing the brass on the Titanic? I agree this seemingly minor fix should be address, but at this point with the leadership they have at the top... Fallout 76 (while a game I enjoy playing) is pretty much doomed. Unless they remove whomever is making the terrible decisions that are being made, this game has less than 18 months until it become FTP or even slowly deprecated into vaporware.
---
You are. Call it what you want, it's whining. I don't have nor do I want a bunny hat. Cosmetics are useless when you play 1st person.
---
Just posted this morning about getting a SBQ fight with 2 Queens.  We cleared them both in about 15 minutes, thanks, in no small way, to the lower levels who were clearing adds and helping instead of hiding.  Made mention of this in my post too.  I know alot of players just show up to mooch, but I don't remember seeing anyone not helping in this event.  Thanks to all the heads up, real players, low or high who make this event so successful and fun for all.
---
have you seen lucky charms? take out the flakes and make all the marshmallows sugar coated, harder (like the ones for hot coco) and shaped like nukes.
---
NICE!!
---
Oh I agree, I just think its overkill in a lot of situations. Like I said it's more the RP aspect of it that bugs me, a Falllout game for me has always been a very character-driven experience and a lot of other players obviously aren't interested in that.
---
No problem bud.
---
Try to launch yourself. Get it going again. I’ve been doin fissure prime every other day. It’s tough but if you kno what ur doing u can do it solo then ask for help against queen .
---
My main is bloodied so I know the pain of adds lol
---
I just did the monster mash event.
---
What about shooting the ever living shit out of it/grenade it big time? Second thought, that may just leave you with the entity placed but damaged needing repair. BUT maybe it would give you the option to scrap rather than repair?
---
I’ve got one! I turned it into a pipe rifle, but still. It’s the only one I’ve ever come across and it’s 3*.
---
The interface used by Nukes And Dragons perk builder would be perfect. 
---
Show the cards you have for each stat, select the number of stars you want on that card and it loads to the stat. Simple, easy.  
---
Then fix cards so you can't get more than the max for each. If you already have Slugger at 3 stars, it is not a selectable card anymore for a new level, nor does it appear in a pack.
---
You sure they are available for purchase still by those that do not own them?  Things you own, that are not longer available, still show up in your Atom Shop, even after they are removed for everyone else that did not buy them before they were removed.
---
I have bought Atoms and might just buy more.
---
IF repair kits are added to the store, no-one has to buy them, but someone will, just not me.
---
someone forgot the card packs you get every 5 levels.
---
Well now I want to pull mine off and see what's what, because I've been using them since launch. Maybe even beta.
---
Also, it sorts by closest to spoiling at the bottom but if you consume that and another item of the same food is LESS spoiled, then that item type jumps back up the list! 
---
I honestly wouldn't mind the inventory management if you could somehow briefly pause and not take damage. When I'm out of Stimpacks and in the middle of battle, it's hard enough to go to the favorites menu much less go into the Pipboy.
---
Mine does that too lol
---
Literally an item from fallout 4, no idea why it's not been implemented. I'm thinking it might come and we get to purchase it 🤔
---
I was planning to do that one, but it never came up for me.
---
So I had my character eat whatever had sugar in it that I could find. Figured out that Sugar Bombs could complete the daily :D
---
Zero. Quantums are more valuable and useful in their base form. No need to make them into something worse.
---
There's already a heft amount of tabs, I prefer betterinventory's way of doing it where you can filter to specific types of items.
---
It wasn't, there's a bug that kills the questline, wait for a patch.
---
You just don't understand what we are talking hete. We are not asking to remove this part of the game but just to have the chance to change or delete cards we don't need.
---
How bout once you hit lvl 50 you can reset all your cards and pick the ones you want? By lvl 50 youve done everything possible anyways just let us have our huy the way we want no. (Sorry for spelling gramma)
---
Usually log out and log back in and your active quests will reset.
---
move your CAMP, if only a few inches. that repairs everything for the cost of a few caps.
---
weapons mods haven't worked since the last update. Keep it in your inventory til bethesda fixes the problem.
---
Attaching mods was broken in the last patch and not hotfixed.
---
Hopefully it will be fixed tomorrow.
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
---
I would love to have the R91 again. I miss that gun. the combat rifle can never replace that.
---
Ahh alright.
---
Yeah, but as long as they're not 100% useless, I doubt Berhesda will ever do this. They intended it this way.
---
It’s ridiculous that’s becoming the /r/fo76 meme.
---
What would be cool is if you could use the favourite wheel but there was a spoke for sort by water one for health and one for HP.
---
For me that’s be a good start.
---
I'll add you!
---
So this is crazy sounding but some people attempt to tank the imposter when it is invincible so it doesn't eat the guy trying to be the conduit.
---
Truly an OG Responder
---
I killed a level 1 legendary eye robot in the burrows... dropped a one star level 1 baton.
---
I was gonna launch a nuke at Harper's ferry but got too much stuff so can't do much till I unload
---
I would be onboard with this.
---
I love making ~~newbies~~ new visitors hit it. I first throw then off by insisting they "touch it!" then they have a moment of o shit when it explodes my house LOL it's a good cackle.
---
(I'm a very nice and passive player, I don't pvp or harass, but this is a fun time lol)
---
Are you sure, as in you have a feeling, or have you done a mathematical analysis of rewards with differing luck levels?  My luck was up to about a 10 I think out of PA, now it's back to 5 I believe in PA because I stopped trying to boost it for the reward.
---
Are you saying that you don't think assault rifles spawn with legendary effects? They do. I have a 3\* one. It's not worth using, but I have it. It's 90% reduced weight, so I haven't gotten around to tossing it.
---
Cryolator and healing perks. 
---
One person with lots of healing perks to make stims better and faster, ideally with a pretty tanky build and power armor takes all 3 pylons. That person also uses the cryolator to keep the imposter frozen in place. 
---
Ignore the adds as much as possible. They are a distraction. 
---
Another person doing high damage blasts it until it’s dead. 
---
We did this the other night, just myself and another person. Had it down to about 25% health with 4 minutes left when a handful of other people showed up and got a few hits in.
---
I use the activate through window all the time to enter locked camps. I get surprised and angry responses when the owner comes home to find me scrapping or playing their piano behind a locked door.
---
I had an instigating explosive assault rifle and even fully tuned, with full perks it was still weaker than my powerful auto handmade.  
---
They're okay if you need something to scrap but the handmade beats it every time.
---
I had an instigating explosive version, it was crap.
---
What a ridiculous justification for lame content. Because “you play 1st person”. Thanks for stopping by.
---
I bet we’ll be getting the bow so maybe that’ll become upgraded and maybe the crossbow with it
---
I’m on Xbox btw
---
Nope. Even Rippers which you can get Lehendary versions of, only come in level 40. Drills and chainsaws are 20 (and overrepaired diamond-tip drills at 200% do more than a chainsaw, and have v.fast speed- chainsaw is listed as “slow”!)
---
Especially since the Mesmetron was created in prewar WV! I forget where it is, but during the mistress of Mysteries missions you can read a log on a computer about them trying to create a device that scans the entire interior of a building. The log talks about how the test scrambled everyones brains and caused them to go insane and attack eachother. They mention it being a failure but possibly useful for military use.
---
I also got a quad crossbow but each shot has to be reloaded 1 by 1 making it pretty pointless on crossbows.
---
That's the thing, I feel you have to make them feel tehy are going to lose sales for them to back track. Otherwise it doesn't hurt to ask and to get them to back off on somethign that could make them more money, it has to hurt to ask (why I won't give them a dime for anything more on Fallout 76 now unless they backtrack). And it is easier to get them to back off now then later when they already are seeing money from it. 
---
And the problem is isn't that it is other people pay to get an advantage (I don't care about that, I don't even play the PvP servers)... the problem is they will start changing balance around in the game to make the game slightly frustrating to play without those repair kits. So, it will affect you even if you don't buy them (Look at what gta online has become. And if you were smart you could see the design choices from teh start as Rockstar designed it from the start to sell shark cards. Stuff like insurance having to be paid every time your car got destroyed, whether by you or the other person).  ANd yes, there are many ways they can change the game. Harder to find materials to fix your weapons/armor (hell, ballistic fiber is hard enough to find now), your weapons/armor start degrading quicker so it's less feasable to fix them when you get to an armor/weapons bench, hell, adding in new dungeouns that will really wear out your stuff with no repair benches anywhere so good luck getting through without some repair kits.
---
I have no problem with them having them in the game, I just have a problem with them having incentive to make it annoying to do without them (and making them hard to get in game) because tehy want to sell them.
---
Reason for the down votes is its easier to shoot the messenger then accept how this bug is affecting a lot of us, and this is the reason the messenger asks us to protect him through the wasteland.
---
I want a three star flare gun now. The more useless the better.
---
Nah it's the same as always, I've done a few recently and didn't notice any differences
---
It is not that I am whining. There is a dedicated pvp server. I don't mind people taking a workshop if they want it, but to one shot me, take the workshop, then leave it seems like a jerky move. When I got shot at the trader I wasn't even close to my workshop. The player then continued to take down 2 other players in the area as well just because he saw them. All on the adventure server. I don't take workshops often, only when I need resources and accept the risk but the reality is that some players just take advantage of that, and the blocking feature.
---
I wasn't justifying the content, you half-wit. I was stating I don't care about cosmetics because I play 1st person. 
---
Lame content to you is awesome for others. Nobody is forcing you to support or play the game.
---
Well, since you didn’t even pay attention to my questions, I’m going to assume you also haven’t been paying attention to your rad resist and when this happened in game. I am deeply interested in game mechanics, and thus pay a lot of attention to how things work. This was not an issue prior to patch 8.
---
&gt;  it was level 35
---
This is the one that triggers my rage button. Oh look, we killed a level 95 queen. And I got some level 40 loot from it. Yay.
---
Probably worth more to just sell to vendors straight away for one cap each.
---
bloodied is not just PvP, it is a damn good weapon for PvE. Maybe you are thinking of Assasin's.
---
Yes! We do mushroom hunting in Ohio as well. If you've never had pan friend Morels, you're missing out. They're a local seasonal delicacy around here. 1 pound of Morels can go for $50-100! I lived out in the country growing up, and one of my fondest memories is going mushroom hunting with my dad and coming back with 4-5 grocery bags full of golden sponge (the absolute best type) morels. Mom prepared the Morels and dad called all the neighbors spread across the countryside. My dad, myself, and our neighbors went fishing in our back yard pond. A few hours later we had a big mess of Bluegill, Bass, and even a few Catfish.
---
What followed was one of the best meals I have ever had. Battered Morels fried in butter, deep fried battered fish fillets, fresh spiral cut deep fried french fries, and deep fried Cauliflower. All told I think we had 4 cast iron frying pans running full time on the stove and 3 deep fryers (neighbors brought 2 with them). Everyone pitched in during the cooking, with us kids doing the egg wash / batter coating, and parents handling the deep fryers and pan frying obviously.
---
**Recipe for Pan Fried Morels:**
---
1. Soak freshly picked Morels in a cold saltwater solution for an hour or so. This adds flavor and gets any bugs out.
---
2. Rinse thoroughly in cold water. 
---
3. Slice lengthwise and pat dry with paper towels.
---
4. Prepare an egg wash (several well beaten eggs on their own or mixed with cream or milk).
---
5. Prepare a bowl with flour, salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you wish mixed together.
---
6. Dip Morel slices in egg wash, then coat well with flour mixture.
---
7. Add butter to frying pan (cast iron is the best here) over medium / medium high heat. The butter should not burn - if it's turning brown quickly your heat is too high. You want that perfect temperature where you butter is sizzling and popping but not burning.
---
8. Fry coated Morels on both sides with plenty of butter, until golden brown. Place on paper towel to drain / cool for a minute or two, and serve immediately.
---
Deep frying them is also an option, but IMO the flour + butter pan fried combo is the way to go here.
---
Possibly
---
Those won't get added into your hand. I've gotten Thru Hiker countless times but only have the 3, 2, and 1 stars. I don't have extra of any of those levels.
---
It increases incrementally as you go down, which is why I use it even without a bloodied build. 
---
As far as I know it works with all weapons.
---
Okay are you referring to this post or did i miss something?
---
But that is lore breaki...
---
Nevermind. I'm with you mate
---
I only launch on sbq because people like to one shot my spawns at the other locations, and I think like many I find the process very tedious now so I hardly ever have the motivation to do it.
---
I like the idea of strengthening perks already implemented! Nice one.
---
Lol this happened to me this weekend during the Uranium Fever event with a mole miner.
---
Possible, wasn't 100% sure it could be sold unbulked lol
---
the same way this user made their secret entrance/camp with no door. you activate a usable item- in this case the red stove- and it teleports you in to the use position.
---
I’ve got a 2* bloodied war drum with ss but it’s level 35
---
What exactly does it do wrong? I don't know enough about the SAA in particular to say.
---
Your game is broken, because the card packs get added to everyone elses' hands.
---
I never said that lmao, can you not read? My god man.
---
Just in case you didnt notice this post is about under armors, think you mixed some posts but all good
---
I think you're in the wrong post...
---
It wouldn't appear in your hand if you already own all levels. The only time it should it to replace the standard with a gold version. Although I don't think that works. Unless it's been fixed in a post-launch patch.
---
I see that now. how the hell did it do that? I clicked reply on that post and it popped over to this one.
---
Time to move it.
---
I will do 1k.
---
You mean only the good ones...
---
\+karma ty :)
---
There are none so blind as those that see things that aren't there.
---
I didn’t even remember that but that ties in pretty perfectly
---
Haha these posts are pretty close if you sort by hot
---
I'd like to see perks that improve very specific playstyles, things that are underutilized right now. Pistols, unarmed power-armour, and explosive heavy weapons come to mind. Some completely new playstyles would be neat as well. Perhaps some to go with the Junkie's and Berserker's legendary effects which are pretty useless at the moment.
---
I'd also love to see the Karma Syringer make a return, as well as a syringer that fires stimpacks.
---
“This is a loot game so let us loot things that aren’t useless”
---
Amen, brother.
---
I am sure as in I have been doing tech data since beta (low yields mostly ammo, was stuck at knight forever), and since doing it with increased luck, I finally started getting them to drop, all within a week. Have not done "mathematical analysis" of the game. I play for fun, not homework. Simply dismissing an observation because I haven't dedicated my life to the science of fo76 is ridiculous. Again, it's not impossible to get them with low luck, but it IS luck. Higher luck equals higher percentage chance, equals more chances to obtain a rare item.
---
You said that Slugger only adds damage to the base damage. If a Super Sledge does 200 base damage, that's a total of only +120 damage from ALL MAXED OUT Slugger perks.
---
That isn't true.
---
Also, if I look at how quick you are to call a total stranger illiterate and a moron, then perhaps you are the one with the problem, mate. I can read and comprehend things just fine.
---
I remember when I use to hop servers for an hour in Grafton and get them all from the vendor. Times were good and simple
---
It’s possible that this lets you scrap an item that shouldn’t be in the scraping menu.
---
I’m imagining the displayed menu being filtered from the inventory it’s potentially possible that the menu selects unscrapable items and the skips them.
---
So there would be a race between you clicking scrap and the UI moving the cursor over the unscrapables .
---
Maybe...
---
same with preplanned buildings
---
Yeah they dont call it the mesmetron but the way that they describe it makes it pretty obvious. Its at the place where you have to use the SIPHON.
---
Cool let me know!
---
OK, I'll specify. Duplicates won't get added to your hand if it exceeds the total combination. Because Good Doggy is only a one level card, you can only have one in your hand. You can get duplicates for cards with multiple levels because you can have a 3-1* thru hiker. So at most, you'll get 6 level 1 thru hiker cards, but no more.
---
What times you usually on? I play almost everyday and are like you , play solo but wouldn’t mind team play. My psn is same as here.
---
they have to fix the dirt exploit first, otherwise these will be used to plant foundations instead of crops.
---
They tried to fix the campfire one, but it still works. It just got a lot harder to place the foundation.
---
I usually run through West Tek, National Radio, Ski Resort, Blackwater mine. Or really any place with Super mutants, moleminers, or Scorched for their weapons and then equip the bargain perk card and a grape mentats and I can go through all 1400 caps. Super mutants are nice because they also drop 2-5 caps each.
---
Same it's been on my list for over a month now and I couldn't seem to figure it out ...
---
\+karma
---
Yup. Ammo crafting needs to be looked at for this. 
---
Performance wise it’s in a good place after the buff. But x21 rounds per craft is awful for how fast it eats it.
---
You’d be better off priming it provided you have the fluorescent flux since it yields like x86 with ammosmith
---
Anyone who can take the yard trash off of the tank is a good guy in my book.
---
&gt; Do you know who Bethesda is? I'm having my doubts, because you keep saying that I called him a duper, when it was someone from Bethesda who said he was.
---
No they didn't, which is why I even offered you a chance to link to that. Yet you still haven't because it doesn't exist. LOL
---
We made several nuke runs over the weekend.  I also did two solos myself.  Does not seem any harder, more lag when replacing the mainframe cores but not harder.  In fact on one of the runs we noted the surprising lack of bots during the launch prep section.   
---
 I think that it is luck of the draw, sometimes it is really busy and other times really easy.  We always bypass the fixing the reactor section by picking the locked door (last one on the left wall) which allows us to skip cleaning the reactor room.  I only worry about the assaultron that is near that door.  We also shut down the turrets and the lunch engineers where ever we can.  
---
Finally destroy all the eyebots you see using sneak and ranged weapons.
---
That is true. Test and see for yourself.
---
39 here, and my usual team is either a friend about my age or my dad, who’s enjoying it so much he has even cosplayed as his character. He and I both get motion-sick from video games sometimes, and personally I’m also very bad at aiming, so I like that it can be slower-paced exploration and not just constant frantic button-mashing and trying not to get sick. If you want a fight, you can find one, but if you want to spend an hour tending crops, cooking food and working on your camp you can do that too. You have options.
---
"Trying to get by." -Raider
---
"Just trying to get money."- Bank robber
---
Hmm, dont think they have a karma bot here, but take my invisible +1 karma xD
---
Makes no sense lore-wise
---
My workaround for this is just dropping all of my non-quest related notes and holotapes in my stash, but it's annoying I have to do that in the first place. It also makes trading plans and recipes with other players easier because you don't have to scroll all the way through the notes list just to find them.
---
How is it wrong? If you sort weight or value it goes high to lower... you want the option to add ascending or descending by the sounds of it. It’s not the wrong way since everything else is sorted in the same way.
---
700 hrs in and have still not launched a nuke once. Bookmarked that page though so I could start trying silos this week
---
Too bad this glitch has literally no use. You dont even need silo codes to launch a nuke.
---
I already did last night. This isn't whatsoever. How can you just blatantly lie? You're absolutely pathetic.
---
If you're on PC, there's a mod for that.
---
Even if the noob tags 1 critter then kites it screaming like a scared puppy the rest of the battle, they helped.
---
You still need the key cards tho just don’t need to have the code pieces.
---
PS: all my slaves are participating willingly and do get "paid" = indentured servants
---
Yeah all raiders are the same... you big racist. 😋
---
Go to southen belle hotel check tables outside starts a quest for the wendigo mounted head leads you to the sunken church
---
Iv'e never gotten one, guess i'm just unlucky with that.
---
The "Valley Galeria" is a mall, with lots of space to show items, that is already in-game but drastically under-used. It would be a great place to put this type of thing.
---
Absolutely!
---
Completely. With the same attachments and perk set up my level 35 handmade was doing 12 more damage than a level 50 AR.
---
Feels like it needs some added utility to make it more worthwhile. Right now all it has is reload speed
---
For you.
---
Where do you get the keycards? If it’s a lengthy answer or it varies, don’t worry about it, I can check out a video online
---
Jesus, how does this still exist? Power armor randomly popping in menus has been a thing all the way back to Feed The People hopper eating PA in beta.
---
Unarmed
---
I have an instagating mole miner 3 blade gaunlet
---
*double damage if target is full health
---
Ninja perk card ×3
---
Iron fist perk card ×3
---
1890 damage on that first shot
---
Oh plus bloody mess perk card ×3
---
Anything i hit on my first shot pretty much explodes into flesh and blood!
---
So back to the question in hand, you want to use ironfist perk card for either gaunlet you use.
---
Yeah wish people would realize not all low levels are noobs at the game lol
---
Yeah the blast radius is the size of a nickel
---
Yeah, you should have six :(. They were quick to take them out of the atomic shop.
---
Yup, that’s why even though I’ve gotten the first Lockpick two or three times from packs I only have one in my hand but have multiple 1* home defense cards.
---
My group launched 3 nukes at once last night. The server was pretty empty except for us 6 and 2 or 3 other people. Surprised the server didn't poop out.
---
Yeah only think I have trouble with on my low level is the larger adds like deathclaws mirelurk queens and stuff like that.
---
It’s not a blatant lie. It’s how the game works Danny, you obviously have no clue how it works.
---
I was the conduit last night, but ran out of stimpacks. I told everyone I am out, someone else needs to conduit. No one did, then everyone was mad at me for stopping. But no one else stepped up to take over.
---
Yeah I have a quad harpoon 1*. Helps it dramatically. My dream roll would be a quad explosive though
---
You can either buy them from players at 100caps per which is what I see them go for or you can get them from the flying drones by either 1 starting the quest which you can do multiple times in the enclave bunker to shoot drones down or just be lucky to find a random drone with 3 vertibirds flying by.
---
The lower your health the more damage out put and it works with any build any weapon any armor set
---
I'm kind of torn here because I ran two this weekend - one went so smoothly - in and out - easy peasy. Then last night we got it handed to us just like you described - everything re-spawning constantly and eventually we tapped out. So I don't know if it's just RNG?
---
It has very specific uses. But for general use i agree that it’s quite underwhelming
---
The economy is fucked not because of the dupes but because there is no cap sink to get caps out of the game, and the cap limit is laughably low. Not to mention an economy is never going to happen when the game doesn't even have a text feature to try to trade on, the trading UI is absolute garbage and for a long time wouldn't even let you see what legendary effects were on an item aside from the first effect.
---
So trying to blame dupes on the economy being garbage would have first required there to be an economy to destroy. This game never had an economy to begin with, bethesda made sure of that.
---
Definitely is Ive heard its like 800 caps from the vendor, that’s like an 75% discount
---
Except the system they have in place is broken. Someone can walk right up to you anywhere with his team mate back at your workshop. What are you supposed to do, slap damage him in a game where the person who shoots last wins? 
---
Or if they’re in the workshop with you, what can you do? Slap him? All they have to do is wait for for the right second, press claim and open fire and you’re dead. 
---
These aren’t pvp arenas. They’re workshops. Contesting it should be for the workshop, not the caps.
---
no one launch because it is not worth it.. Sbq droop most times * legendary items when you nuke white springs if you lucky you will kill 2 maybe 3 *** leg one time i kill 3 ghoul all server come on one time great fun.....bigger chance drop something good is doing invents....
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info!
---
Crafting yield isn’t terrible. Lucky hole mine has crystal ore for days.
---
Crystallizing barrel is easier on ammo consumption. Worth looking into if the standard barrel is eating it too fast. Also adds ballistic damage which **should** benefit from stabilized
---
How are you going to deny something that I can clearly see with my own eyes?
---
My experience in the Fallout games is that nearly all raiders try to kill you the moment they see you. Some have the decency to try to rob you first though. The lore doesn’t seem to match up with the reality.
---
Seems legit
---
Imagine the regen rate if you are grouped with a conduit that is spamming stimpacks with Team Medic maxxed out. Seems silly not to. But no one does.
---
All you can do is stay crouched and hidden on the map. Maybe go around and block everyone on your map first so they can’t see your icon.
---
I've heard if that was a nuke zone before flux will still appear after nuke zone is gone, Also rad storms. Just like I've had a few time I go to WS and all the ghouls are glowing ghouls no nuke zone.
---
Map was probably made by some dumb hillbilly.
---
I have full Troubleshooters gear so I usually take a pylon and then then start wailing on the colonel gutsys while the other players focus on the imposter.
---
The tse nerf
---
Yeah, we all understand how simple it is, pal. The problem is that players see workshops as their personal hunting grounds, jumping from one to the other to take down players that have no chance in beating them. Then they don't even use the workshops, costing the player caps for getting killed and the caps spent on the workshop.
---
I don't think it's *completely* random. I think there's some sort of unlisted rarity rating with the cards.
---
What platform?  I had the same issue on xbox until I cleared the cache.
---
  Turn on your xbox and let it fully load then press the power button and hold until it turns off.  Give it 5 min to fully clear the cache and turn back.
---
Gluck
---
You could at launch, but people were making too much money from it so they changed it.
---
X-01 and the occasional radaway, always my go to.
---
Simple answer; yes. If you're clearing the way for other players to focus on the SBQ then that's great. Extra help sure isn't to be sniffed at. Plus it's good levelling for lower levels so yeah.
---
Just put on rad sponge and share it with your team. You have 0 rads the entire time you are in the nuke zone.
---
Yeah I eventually ended up doing the same thing, but like you said we probably shouldn't have to.
---
Even if tapes related to an active quest were marked with a star, It would make them 100 times easier to find in a big list.
---
That wouldn’t be a chance, it’d be a certainty.
---
The [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/) I [linked](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/) in the [linked](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/) [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/as0aea/banned_im_the_900_hours_played_guy/)? Is that the link, linked to, that you don't understand was linked? I linked it from the link your bestie linked in his link that was linked in the link I posted.
---
Methinks, certain skinks don't think a link is a link, which stinks! But doublethink, means tiddlywink, to a fink on the brink of a pink slink to a shrink. **I**think, a fink with a kink shouldn't drink, lest he sink to be hoodwinked to overdrink.
---
Wink, wink.
---
Right. Like I mentioned to a few others if people where worried about low levels taking away dps why would that stop to hit me with a hammer instead of focusing on the queen lol
---
I've heard nuked flora persists for about 1 hour after the rads clear. Best time to farm flux in my opinion.
---
NVs unique weapons didn't have a variety of models to retexture, and couldn't even be modded without, well, mods because they didn't have textures for the mods. 
---
I understand where you're coming from, but it's not really that easy to compare the two.
---
While Valley Galleria seems logical, someplace on the east side of the map is probably not a good idea. You'd essentially lock people out of the shop until they were strong enough to survive the trip, which could be as much as 10-20 hours depending on how quickly people advance.
---
Someplace in the forest would probably be better. Maybe convert the responder bot in the Morgantown Airport into a "gift shop" vendor. Since there's another vendor 30 seconds away in Grafton (that doesn't require a load screen to visit), the dud in the airport is pretty much redundant already.
---
It's hitbot could be reworked as well.
---
I appreciate the revives - especially at the Encryptid event - it's really frustrating to see low levels who are just hiding in hopes of a reward as they increase the health of the boss etc but I have experienced a low level that was just running around and reviving downed players and it made me really happy! As long as you're helping\~
---
Had 10 once, was up near the steakhouse and I was 2-3 shot killing from stealth as they spawned out of the fissure.
---
Look at it from his point of view.  He's in his camp and suddenly there's a player just outside.  He's most likely not going to offer you tea.
---
You cant get the ones you missed
---
Have some Free Content instead‼️
---
not worth it
---
Did that update already come out where CAMP is indestructible?
---
I believe the pylons take a percentage of max hp so I have been turning on those when I do encrypted on my low level because there are so many people that refuse to use them
---
Only real option is to move entire camp, once in water you can't do anything.
---
AMEN BROTHER!
---
I'm bloody too and adds are the w o r s t.
---
omfg so true
---
I would make a case all most all heavy weapons are still fairly weak when you look at most melee/rifle builds.
---
Fatman Useless NO range so no real way to make any use of it and its power.
---
Harpoon gun fairly weak damage and slow reload along with only having a single shot and no real mods and ammo is fairly costly to craft.
---
Broadsider the same as the Harpoon gun for the most part slow reload and poor damage.
---
Cryolator has like 2 mods damage is fairly meh ammo is super rare and costly to make.
---
Jump inside one of the turrets, and just spam the repair button.
---
Perk cards need a total rewrite.
---
Can we start a petition to get a QOL patch on it?

This comes across like an asset a beginner Creation Kit modder made who's struggling with lights.

Ok... let's try this on.
---
Diamonds.
---
If only a few people have diamonds, and only a few diamonds are available... then diamonds are super rare, and demand goes way up. Every now and then, someone finds a diamond, and it's a true treasure. 
---
Now, along comes someone, who has figured out a way to artificially create a perfect diamond. He sells these diamonds to people, one at a time... and people buy them, because... diamonds, right? Super rare! But, then... all those people look around, and realize that everyone is wearing a diamond. Everyone has a diamond ring, and diamond earrings, and a drawer at home with some diamonds in them. People are trying to sell their diamonds, but the market if flooded with them... 
---
THAT is how an economy gets fucked. The answer to solving that problem is not "introduce more diamonds!" 
---
Dupers introduced a shit-tonne of high end weapons and armour into the game... making anything less than those high-end items... near worthless. Making the value of those high end items, near worthless. 
---
Now we're at a place where players want MORE, BETTER, BIGGER... because the "top" has become "meh".
---
It's not about cap limits, it's not about a trade UI. It's about "keeping up with the Joneses"... and dupers made sure that "powerful" was the average, and not the exception as it should have been.
---
Non legendary creatures are dropping legendary loot now. The whole system is flipped on its head. I’ve seen single enemies (both legendary and non legendary) drop multiple legendary items and some legendary creatures drop nothing but ammo and junk. Makes legendary farming a little more challenging but they are out there
---
“You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax or that may in any way influence or advantage Your playing abilities, or influence or advantage Your use of the Services”
---
Mules are a clear advantage in your use of services.
---
Yeah I've seen low levels tank it too - normally when we run it - i make a ton of stimpacks for my friend and he takes all three so we don't have to worry about it because getting the pylons is 90% of the fight to be honest.
---
I found him last week walking in a random tunnel in the cranberry bog. There wasn't even a road, FT location, or spawn point in sight.
---
IMHO, the rarity of his items are based upon his randomness. To guarantee a meeting with him would hurt an already shaky economy
---
That's pretty dumb of them.
---
Personally if I'm downed I just hit the respawn button right away so nobody has to waste time &amp; simpaks reviving me.
---
Players with 15 Charisma get the Ultra Coveted ability to speech-check it out of rampaging lol

I’m gonna be your even better friend here today, because with one simple trick, I’m gonna turn those 2 braincells of yours into 5!
---
The secret to all questions you’ve ever had has been on the internet all along.
---
www.google.com
---
This website. This unreal, magical, incredibly powerful website, has the ability to answer most questions you will have.
---
Using google can be extremely difficult however, statistically speaking, 98.376% of people who attempt to use it fail, and resort to other more neanderthal-like methods of finding solutions to their question at stake, similar to your post here.
---
When you get to google, there will be an empty field where you can type. I hope I haven’t confused you yet, we’re not done quite yet. In that field, type your question. After your question has been written in said field, there are a few ways you can do the next step. Pressing the ‘Enter’ key is one option, but it depends on what platform you’re using to access this miracle of a website. If you see a little magnifying glass, click/tap that, alternatively.
---
What’s going to happen next is, google is going to perform an actual miracle. It will, in the blink of an eye search up answers to your previously written question, and show you what it finds.
---
I know, this sounds crazy and only a madman would believe such a site exists, but by all means, try it. You’ve got nothing to lose. 
---
Last but not least, USE GOOGLE RESPONSIBLY. It is so incredibly powerful it is capable of finding things no man should know of, provide a knowledge out of this world, and you know what they say - *Knowledge is power, power is corruption*.
---
Good luck, today a boy becomes a man.
---
Well, that sure is a screencap of a character, alright!
---
Uhh… OP... how about some deets, maybe WHY said character is your favourite? Build? Ya know... *something*?
---
you don't *have* to swtich out cards. It's cost effective for materials.., to a certain point. I have an excess amount of ballistic fibers. I don't think I'll take the time to swap until I get low again.
---
I don’t think support helps for that type of problem
---
And wood armor
---
Then it would jave to be deathclaw**s** island.
---
Survival of the fittest. You’re welcome to crawl back into the vault if surface life is too much for you. Although, from what I hear, that place isn’t what I’d call hospitable either.
---
More fool them. The people I play this game with range from level 30 to I think approaching 200s. My other character is only 12 but I have the near 400 hours on my main one to help with that by skill alone. Not that I plan on throwing her into the SBQ event anytime soon but folk don't know what capability a player has or why they are that low level.
---
It seems to stagger a lot when shooting all but Ghouls it worked quite.
---
Only reson I want to revive is because we nuke the queen to fight out of the rad zone and half the time it will spawn me in the rads lol
---
Because most solo players are put off by silos - either afraid, or maybe don't think they have the time commitment. 
---
My theory at least. I'm going to run maps for a bit, then drop a nuke myself here in a bit. Anyone nuked a silo yet? Any idea if the robots inside spawn more legendaries?
---
Then dont take the work shops! The workshops are by no means a necessity and are in most cases the slow way to get resources. All I can say in that you are complaining about people doing pvp in an area that states as you obtain the workshop that other players can initiate pvp at any time. It is set up for pvp to happen by design and people use it as such.
---
You’re right, whichever one does extra damage to players
---
I don't think it fun or fair to bash lower levels based on their level alone. Sometimes it's obvious that the low levels in the event are alt toons.  Pretty obvious who's a noob and who knows what's going on. most of the time.  Some low level players get educated before getting into that event.  You never stated the level of your higher char(s), but I'm sure as an experienced player, you know exactly whats going on during that event and who's doing what.
---
Yeah I know that alot of low levels are probably peoples alts so i dont assume they are ignorant of stuff
---
Those are different perk cards in themselves. You have either the standard, expert, or master with 2 at level 3.
---
I'm fairly sure this is a game about surviving a nuclear wasteland so Queensbury rules probably don't apply. Broken system or not you're still inviting it by taking a workshop.
---
&gt; 3* Legendaries are rare as it is. Why make it harder?
---
Bethesda's whole concept for this game is making people grind. Instead of improving drops, they decided to implement the Legendary Vendor which will introduce what is essentially a gambling element to the game. They will never make 3-star drops less rare because then people will be fully geared up faster and will be more likely to get bored and stop playing. Instead they want you to kill a million legendary enemies, or re-roll your legendaries a million times with the Legendary Vendor. That keeps you playing the game.
---
Tie this into the another thread, about making the Atomic Shop an actual place you can go visit, in WV map.
---
Central social area for peeps to cash in perk cards, spend atomic, maybe do like LFG kinda activities. Give players another reason to come together and socialize.
---
Oh sorry I didn't include that - I play on PC.
---
No. I have two of the base Rifleman, both at 3*. I also have level 2 and level 3 at 3*.
---
I have a 170 something a 150 something a 70 something a level 5 that's merchant so it doesnt count and my level 30 I'm working on
---
I understand it is part of the game but the high level pvp builds are tearing through the players that don't build for pvp. It feels like the players that want to enjoy the adventuring part more is getting the short straw here.
---
That's exactly how I feel about it. Well put.
---
Last 2 SBQ events i've gotten a drill, a syringer, full set of ultracite armor plans (which I already know), and a couple of wing fragments...
---
0-20% hp: +50% damage
---
20-30% hp: +44% damage
---
30-40% hp: +38% damage
---
40-50% hp: +31% damage
---
50-60% hp: +25% damage
---
60-70% hp: +19% damage
---
70-80% hp: +13% damage
---
80-90% hp: +6% damage
---
Stacks additively with other sources of general damage (Bloody Mess, Adrenaline etc). Multiplicatively with everything else. Should apply to all outgoing damage.
---
Great Job on the Camp!
---
Don't get too used to the meathook, eventually it will get fixed like the M79 and Gatling Gun
---
The gatling plasma is great for flying SB because even with all the stabilized perks, it still bounces around a lot...which works out great on a big target. You can hit  the wings, body etc while just aiming at the body when they are airborn and it drops them quick. IMO it kinda sucks for the ground stuff.
---
I have a 2 shot, heavy barrel 50 cal that I use on fast moving targets, and that about it
---
My go it is the normal gatling gun with speedy receiver and 500 rnd mag and some kind of legendary perk. I have 3, lol. Mutant slayer, ghoul slayer and anti armor.
---
Bear arms and stabilized perks maxed out is a must for heavy guns
---
Assaultron Blade as well. But I agree Shishkebab is the most needed sword buff, it even does the Legendary pick up animation for christ sake.
---
Nobody’s forcing you to keep commenting about an issue you apparent don’t care about, either. 
---
However, I Do care. You’re just making dumb excuses because you’re enjoying the game and don’t want someone ragging on it. Im enjoying the game as well, but I want meaningful content, not the most basic bland crap they can whip up in an afternoon.
---
Nice!
---
They could've just put it in as that model rather than the assualtron with some bits on it
---
I am trying out a gunslinger build so it's taking some work to get to where it is viable.
---
Thanks you for your reply. Seems you are one of the better ones :)
---
Considering the expenditure of resources killing a \*\*\*lv91 Deathclaw, getting a drill or a syringer as reward (happens about 50% of the time), seems to be a failure of the "game economy" to me.
---
\*\*\* legendaries should drop two stars minimum ... even if that means TWO separate single star weapons.
---
(On the note of useless ... yeah the Ghoul Slayers Gamma gun has got to be it .... got one with 90% weight reduction, and extra fast fire rate though ... gotta be worth something PvP?)
---
Broadsider needs to be more powerful. It’s AoE is also very small for a “launcher”
---
All launchers in general should be buffed back to pre-demo expert nerf levels of damage, if not more. And I’m saying this as someone who uses launchers religiously.
---
Send a pic then. Because that's game breaking.
---
Supposedly gamma gun is great in PVP at killing low hp unyielding build players.
---
I think they mentioned they are working on figuring out what to do with excess ammo. 
---
Problem is it’s too common to sell at 1 cap each. Maybe if we could bulk it to where it’s 1 cap per hundred or something.
---
If you know /exactly/ what you are looking for, it works somewhat acceptably. If I need to eat or drink and I know I have soup, I can sort by spoil and figure out if that item is spoiling faster than another. It's still bas enough that I make all razorgrain on Monday, all corn on Tuesday, all glowing fungus on Wednesday, and so on, because then I know what to use up when I log in the next day and stock up on new soup. Easier than bothering with the sort system.
---
Don't even get me started on sort by weight. Whoever did that is going to the same circle of hell as theater talkers.
---
Where is that though?
---
Fair enough - I know sometimes they do with certain online games.
---
I don’t mind inviting it, at all. But you can’t defend yourself against someone who wants to contest. That’s what I hate. Pvp is 100% initiated by the aggressor, and the chances you’ll go down in one second as soon as they decide to press Contest is extremely high.
---
Thank you that fixed it
---
They really screwed up their roadmap by having Faschnacht so early in the content update. Made everyone question if the other content is limited time. Some people still think Sheepsquatch was a limited time lol
---
Maybe make it challenging, every time I’ve gone it’s been a level 21. Being 96 now it’s just not worth going to.
---
Cosmetics, regardless of what they are, are not meaningful content. The roadmap is pretty clear. If nuclear winter doesnt add something new then we won't have more meaningful content until modders can make it, like every other fallout or elder scrolls game. I'm not mindlessly defending the game. They used an old game engine and produced a pretty average game with no real end game.
---
Grind. Reason to play.
---
Wait a second! The ISS at least drops max level 3 stars. It may be a golf club, rolling pin, walking cane or something else end game.
---
Only for you. I will grab a shot tonight. Then post it, and screenshot that for when you delete your comments in the attempt to pretend you never made this claim.
---
500+ hours of gameplay is just a fluke, is that what you’re going with?
---
I uploaded this from work, so I don't have time to write but in short, I loved the mission where you explored kellogg's mind, I just connected really well with his story. With so many characters in fallout lore, he is one that I think received some of the best development.
---
Ya, that's what I thought 😔 no bunny head for me
---
Which is fun, because they left it in beta condition!
---
It's already been said up above but you need to pick a weapon type that you really want to focus on and then use the website Nukesdragon to refine your build. Luck definitely needs some more points in it. I also have a high intelligence build like you to use power armour.
---
You've just got to choose what you want and how you want to play the game. Also whether you want to do pure damage or if you want quality of life perks such as reducing weight and not needing to eat/drink as often etc
---
What’s broken with the Gatling gun?
---
But it’s really unnecessary and tedious
---
My group launched 6 this weekend.  4  - SBQ fights, 1 - Harper's Ferry and 1 - Whitesprings.  Doing our part!!
---
Yea its fuckin stupid im prolly done with this game
---
I feel like I have the exact opposite problem lol.
---
I want to armour UP the outfits and / or want a toggle-able way to make things an under-armour outfit.
---
Would love to see my armour pieces on top of the spacesuit or halloween costume.
---
The bunker cave on righthand side of map always has 2 mid level deathclaws. Also the power station northwest of watoga always has a high level deathclaw.
---
Sometimes it does but sometimes it drops 1* and sometimes a drill. Same shitty loot tables as everything else it seems.
---
Nothing now, it got fixed. The faster swing speed with melee weapons perk used to affect it. Made it's rate of fire so much better
---
Can't wait for tomorrow's patch! Frustrating all week
---
1. Single shot weapons take far more condition loss per shot than other ranged weapons, but Gunsmith works for all ranged weapons.
---
2. Don't know.
---
3. Should do. As far as I know, the only difference in damage mechanics with VATS is the criticals.
---
lol then screenshot my comment:
---
"I will eat my underwear if you can prove you have two of the same card at level 3"
---
I recommend everyone use the remind me bot.
---
I am level 70+ player, who usually plays solo. I know I do not have the best spec for high dps output. During SBQ events, I am always running around clearing adds and reviving players, when i can. 
---
I know I appreciated getting revived over the weekend, while i was face tanking a Scorched Mirelurk Queen, during SBQ event.
---
!remindme
---
This is what I’m waiting for.
---
It's in the forest so it's not supposed to be extremely challenging. I know of plenty of other locations where they spawn regularly.
---

To give 100+ lvl players something to work towards.
---
I think some of the adds are harder then the queen sometimes lol
---
If u Can card stack do that if not use rad x and the special kind of rad x u get from a mission which name I can’t remember
---
It is 100% I’m still hating the fact that I’ve got to level up a bunch of times to re spec and try different builds
---
I sell apparel and plans to other players. Sell serums to the in game vendors for 500caps each.
---
*cries in mutants 10mm sub machine gun*
---
You need (*Bethesda needs to implement*)  [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124).
---
I wouldn't hate wood armour if it had the potential to be good. Like say you get to the mire or bog, and you can collect mutated wood unique to that area that let's you upgrade regular wood armour to put it on par with the better ones.
---
I was taken to several queen fights with high level friends when I was level 45 or so..... I assumed my job was to keep heat off the tanks and keep people on their feet. I was there for experience and my team was happy having me there.... I was in power armour running around the bunker. 
---
It’s a bit different now.... at level 115 I’m in there with a big gun.... but honestly, I still work on keeping the mobs off the heavy hitters and healing whoever is down.
---
If I see a lower level at a queen fight, my first thought is .....  “ballsy” and my second is “it’s probably an alt”
---
Radshield?
---
I remember nv doing that.
---
My crew and I launched about a dozen nukes over this weekend. All depends on the server you're on. If you're on a server with more higher level players the chances of a nuke dropping are much higher. It's hard to tell when somebody could launch a nuke.
---
Then again, we always look at server health before launching a nuke. We won't launch one if there's not a lot of higher level players on (80+) because we tend to find the response we get is minimal.
---
(We only nuke the SBQ as we can't stand the grind at Whitesprings, and Harpers has proven to be a bust for us)
---
Thanks, but I´ve already seen that. 
---
I was refering to the description of the Easter Egg Event in the new newsbox. It reads like it was more about the easter event. Literally says get all 6 "and find out where the rabbit hole leads to." At least in the german client. I already thought that it may refer to the not-a-dungeon-"Dungeon" which was implemented last. I wasn´t in Harpers Ferry yet, still leveling so I don´t know what´s there. But if there is nothing more then picking up Eggs in the Shop then it is quite disappointing. 
---
It´s like "Hey it´s easter - Here are your eggs, kids. No need to search for them." That would be really disappointing.
---
Which are many things in and around the game, so I should have not expected more in the first place anyway.
---
There should be other end game things to do. Not level up just so you can slightly change your build.
---
Use spacing bro.
---
Yes please
---
Yeah I rarely ever do the queen on my high levels anymore but the experience is great on my low level lol
---
This conversation is over, and you’re trying to derail it. The Easter content sucks. Period. You keep waiting on modders.
---
That's incredibly annoying.  Was stuck in a loop of dying to rads within 3 seconds and having that be my Groundhog Day moment until I quit and rejoined since it was respawning me instead of letting me choose.
---
[](/kcelestiareally)Instigating Dragon, I can only imagine why he'd sell it for Vendor caps, but I am not complaining.
---
Yea but with the deathclaw not being able to leave the island it literally is not challenging whatsoever. And I know of a couple too, you’d just think Deathclaw Island would be the cream of the crop.
---
Yeah it is a pain for sure lol and half the time I dont even have time to pop a rad away to try and run out
---
With the re-emergence of server crashing lately .... largely brought on originally by duping and the servers' inability to cope with the sheer volume of exceptional items in the game ...
---
You gotta wonder if the inevitable stockpiling of \*\*\* legendary items resulting from the long wait for player vending and the legendary vendor has something to do with it? 
---
At level 180, I know I have over 120 \*\*\* items ... not a single one of them useful to me and the way I want to play.  I still play with a full set of ONE star weaponry (at best, an under levelled \*\*Exp) and my best armor is TWO star at best.  Can't wait to play the legendary vendor slot machine a maybe get ONE useful \*\*\* item.
---
I can’t tell if u bein sarcastic or not lol
---
I’d take you but I don’t do deals with raiders
---
Being able to bulk and sell would be lovely!
---
Its not really a random spawn, there are certain areas that trigger an special spawns that can include the Responder vender. Ive seen it at the ice cream place, and just south of morganstown following the road
---
VATS counts as shooting from the hip, so use weapon attachments that boost this.
---
Nuked Flora persists after the Nuke zone clears for about 30-60 minutes.
---
Glowing Ghouls and enemies with Glowing mass, Hardened Mass, &amp; High Rad Fluids stop spawning, but any that were not killed will remain for a while as well.
---
YES!!! I feel dumb for not knowing I use it all the time🤦🏼‍♂️
---
I just want a 3star bloody drill
---
Yeah, this is the same with my crew. Every time somebody nukes Whitesprings you hear a collective "Eugh..." because there's no challenge in it. Just running around killing glowing ones gets kind of monotonous for us.
---
I have alvl 45 pump action two star with anti-armor and limb damage. I paid 1k caps for it and it wrecks almost anything even w/o enforcer. Good non bloodied/tse shottys exist.
---
I paid 49 caps for a 1* ghoul slaying combat knife. With  perks and 200% repair level it does 113 +30% and is super fast. I can kill a lv 62 ghoul in 2 swings and  a 58 glowing one in 4-5. 
---
Not even on a melee build... (Rifleman primarily)
---
It happens to us all every now and again.
---
Yes, but the fun is taken out when you have no chance whatsoever to get a leg up because you can't hold a workshop for long enough and can't even defend yourself against a one shot from a guy that you didn't even see coming because he blocked you before he attacked.
---
I do agree that it's a bit boring for higher levels. I think they should've named it something to mislead unsuspecting vault dwellers.
---
Of course, I can see the intentions behind it. 
---
People want content, but right now they grind for legendaries because there is nothing else to do. And if even that becomes a frustrating chore, well...
---
Bloodied builds are more than capable of carrying SBQ, if that's what you're referring to. Never lasts more than 5 minutes, even when everyone else there isn't really contributing.
---
You can also eat that most spoiled first that way you can save the newer stuff.
---
I've missed two now. They won't show up no matter what I try.
---
We still don't know exactly wether or not it's JUST the head. It very well could be, but I greatly doubt we were suppose to be able to craft it early, and we have still yet to get the limited time 7th day item that's for free for those who bought all 6 eggs. We'll know by 8PM EDT when the store resets
---
I'm with you on this one bud. It was sarcasm. The last 3 star legendary I got was from the ISS and it was a lvl 45 hunter's golf club right after getting a lvl 35 2 star golf club from the burrows. I wanted to scream.
---
Crafted only prefix, I believe.
---
The queen certainly used to scale with the player count, but there was a major change a few patches back and I'm not convinced that it scales now. 
---
Unfortunately Bethesda are incapable of communicating, so no-one really knows.
---
I was able to get the brown and green asylum workers outfits about 30 caps each. That was a good day.
---
I find your lack of faith disturbing
---
Legendary Vendor will turn Fallout 76 into a casino, that's for sure.
---
Because not everyone can statistically have a shiny Charizard.
---
 Ad Victoriam  :)
---
It's no fun launching a nuke alone...
---
My friend lost her primary legendary weapon and her PA right leg this weekend - probably to something like this :(
---
2 full sets of assassin sentinel bos combat armor.  It was most probably a duper.
---
I dropped some very good armor too,when i needed space.
---
Thats a great idea too but some outfits might have some clippimg problems
---
And that's why most people have a starter Bulbasaur? (or whataver his name is)
---
Noticed that alot of the Whitespring Ghouls were dropping up to 3 of both masses and High Rad. Fluid each this weekend.  We only nuked the Whitesprings once.  I didn't see this at Harpers Ferry or the SBQ event though.
---
3* Chameleon armor with junk weight reduction. They might have sold it because it wasn't max level. Ever since then I check everything vendors have.
---
Beth is going to add a 'Player Legendary' System. I assume that means something like Skyrims System, but with stronger Perk Cards? Or Just like Overwatch where every 100 Levels becomes a Star and you get some benefits, dunno what they have planned, but Leveling up will definitely become more worth with this.
---
Thanks. Good to know. I'll plant something and try it out.
---
Probably whatever I sold off to the vendors. I sell nearly everything to vendors, up to and including 3 star items. I would keep a TSE or AAE if something like that ever dropped for me, but I figure just vendor it and hope others see it and need it.
---
Many others have been reporting the same lately. Upvoted.
---
Hopewell cave had a 96 in it
---
FO4 was lacking in conventional heavy weapons, and heavies in general. FO76 does a better job but still lacking
---
I more like a shiny Machamp.
---
It's never been possible. It's a "sick joke".
---
Thanks for your reply, I saw how he started using the trader after shooting me, then proceeded to kill me again and two other players in the area, for no reason. He actually followed us to kill us, again and again.
---
I have to confess, I know nothing about Pokemon.
---
Off of the top of my head, All Rise and the Fixer are both unique looking
---
I wish I could up vote more than once. This is econ 101.
---
I’m level 125, and I personally don’t care who’s there, at what level, as long as they’re helping in some way. I’m a melee build, so when she’s in the ground I’m focused on her. When she’s in the air I let the others, with better guns than me shoot at her while I run around and clear up adds and revive anyone that needs it...until she lands again. I know my strengths. As for the SS, I go for the pylons first then pound on her until it says activate pylons, and just go back and forth. Most of the time, if I die doing SS, I’ll just respawn in...when her health is getting low I call for help. I’ve been healed by many lower levels. Any help to keep the higher levels focused on where they’re needed is appreciated by me!
---
To be fair, all you missed out on was some meat, a single piece of ultracite scrap and some rando weapon.  I've been having legendary enemies straight up vanish after I kill them.  No meat pile nearby, nothing.  Just totally gone.  It stings a little.
---
My first scorchbeast kill was a pretty special moment.  I think I was maybe around lvl 30 with a combat rifle.  It took a long time to bring down.
---
Im just here for the comments and nukashine.
---
My group is on Xbox and we launched several last week, several days in a row. 
---
I try to announce to the groups I’m in so that anyone checking for something to do can join on us and get in on the action. Can you do that on pc?
---
We typically nuke the prime site, but if someone needs materials or a leveling run we’re game to do whitesprings (although not very often)
---
The other day I had a group on my server mass nuking the Queen, as soon as one fight was done they booked it to another silo and dropped another. I've been playing since beta and haven't seen that in a loooooong time. It was a lot of fun and you could tell everyone capable in the server was enjoying the back-to-back fights, we destroyed her each time.
---
Meanwhile, I dropped a nuke on WS the other day and got annoyed that ghouls weren't really spawning and the ones that did had already been taken care of by others. What's the point of wasting my time and ammo to launch a nuke if I don't even get a reward?
---
They don't recognize "scorchbeast" as an approved species, unfortunately.
---
Selfish tin cans. Those who used laser pistols on scorchbeasts, haha!
---
Thanks for the replies all. 
---
Im thinking cond loss is based on amount of damage and not per shot it would seem. Oh well, good to know I'm not crazy :D
---
Good to know about how VATS works too, before I get some pistols that don't benefit me.
---
Pro tip, avoid killing scorchbeasts in heavily wooded areas.
---
Thank you here is a red arrow that means nothing but makes you feel good on the inside
---
I took a level 60 and 40 through their first nuke launch yesterday.  Didn't seem any harder than normal. Not a single death.
---
Honestly - I can deal.
---
If you set your character model to fat it also has clipping problems and if you base build on an edge it can clip through the bottom of the rock mesh. 
---
It would add massive variety to the existing game and honestly if there's outfits that are too. . . big like the impostor mask - don't do them. I think that most however would be good enough to work.
---
&gt;- Laser Weaponry (even after the 20% boost, they still don't do enough damage and their durability is awful; laser rifles still break in 100-200 shots)
---
these are the best weapons in the game right now for pvp (they work the same as in pve)
---
with the beam spliter/and the legendery effect explosive bloodied you can do 200 damage for eatch shot. and the beam spliter actually makes it 5 shots. so its 200x5..
---
Free legendaries Island.
---
They're technically just a special type of feral, so Ghoul Slayer's would be the most appropriate.
---
How would low level noobs farm black titanium if not for the lone Deathclaw on Deathclaw island being lvl 21??? When I first unlocked the Excavator armor quest, that was how I safely farmed for the stuff. Any more Deathclaws or higher level ones and I would’ve had to wait to complete that quest... expecting any gamer to have patience is an absurd idea good sir or madame!!!
---
'Not' Deathclaw island
---
Make a digferent build with that perk lowered plus what happens when you get everycard you dont get more... Just different levels of them so you can minorly alter you character i have sooomany builds. And ways to us my character. But i guess half the game is knowing how to play
---
Yep. So are Grafton monsters.
---
Youre better off selling it to a vendor tbh
---
You forgot the railway rifle
---
Because they want the grinders to keep grinding so that they’ll eventually cave in to the atoms shop
---
I’ve been seeing a lot on nukes. I have 3 cards, maybe I’ll launch one tonight when I get on 🤷‍♀️
---
I was doing the quest in there yesterday on a lower level toon. Killed the 2 level 40ish ones, went to the elevator and a 3rd one spawn. Level 80 something mythic this time. That kept things interesting.
---
Wanted to say thanks for making that page. I've used it a couple times. A couple suggestions: add critical damage and related perks, and another upvote for adding energy weapons. I know those are a lot of work but I would love to see it. Thanks again!
---
Unless I missed something, not yet
---
Bethesda have proven time and time again that they have no interest in making this game easy or fun. It's designed to be grindy. We're at the point now where people are actively defending stuff like the paid repair kits on this subreddit.
---
All the possible ways to charge us atoms lol
---
I could have sworn I’ve seen it at the enclave bunker, but don’t quote me on that, I’ve been wrong before
---
Players: *grabs 100+ nuke codes
---
Bethesda: "ZA WARUDO. TOKI WA TOMARE."
---
Not worth the effort most likely
---
Even easier to clear your cache then.
---
What's considered challenging though? Everyone I see above level 100 just uses their one shot guns on everything anyhow.
---
Sorry you can't form a decent thought or argument. All you can do is throw opinions around.
---
We get it, YOUR opinion is that it sucks. Others may like it.
---
You can't just state your opinion as fact, doesn't work like that.
---
Go whine some more. 👍
---
well, they worked, we are still around, you just can't see us "yet" lol
---
What about giving a daily quest where you have to bury bones and you have to use a shovel for it but there's no shovel around the place!
---
You get the odd scorched/mutant spawn, every so often I get 3 SBs, but that's rare.
---
Same. I’m not sure why that particular ammo is so common, but it’s become seriously annoying that I keep getting grenades every time I turn technical data in.
---
Red arrows for all!
---
I remember that
---
Ive been looking since beta, No luck so far.
---
That's a nice system, making different stuff each day just so you know what will be closest to spoilage. I haven't played in a little while, but I would typically sort with the default, I think alphabetically, and just go to where I knew items were. I would also sort by spoil and it was just a bit annoying to scroll all the way to the bottom to find the food closest to spoiling. 
---
As feedback, if I were organizing the system that controlled sort by spoil, I would put the spoiled stuff at the top, then organize by the condition of non spoiled food from closest to spoilage to farthest and non-spoilable food/drink below that (purified water type stuff).
---
Or perhaps there could be a favorite system within each inventory type screen? Favorite items like water, Nuka Cola, food, buffout, or whatever, and they appear at the top of the list all the time. 
---
Anyway, just a few thoughts.
---
Especially if they were to take the suggestion of using Valley Galeria. Would love a free fast travel to the east side of the map. Although, it could gatekeep lower level players.
---
Ultracite torso for me - and i didn't find out till till i ran into a mirelurk queen, with 4-5 adds plus here little ones, couldn't figure out why she was doing so much damage to me till i died. And i saw that my torso was missing from my P/A suit...... nice really nice.  S i had to make a new one, no biggy -  but it still is annoying a hell. And I've been losing quest holotapes too.  And when they reply to your ticket they tell you they are unable reset quests or replace what has gone missing.  Oh and send us diagnostic data and check your graphics drivers blah blah blah.  (I'd hate to be support, they must feel so whorish with standardized policy replys like this)
---
Real classy, server connections drop when their sever overloads while your crafting, you lose stuff. Some of it is critical to game play.  And they try to song and dance you that it's your gear. THis is F4 with a different dress on. The code is well known, I just wish they'd stop with the bullshit excuses, especially when the bugs they created with each new patch, keep crippling gameplay.
---
I level up at west teck and all the assault and laser rifles sell for a good price. You can easily drain vendors like this,and level up fast while doing it.
---
Yes, I understand the pvp part of it. Some resources are best found at a workshop though, like fusion cores, black titanium, even steel. It feels like the pacifist player is getting punished. We don't build for pvp and have no chance, don't even see it coming. If one or two workshops are taken by players then fine, but how much fun is it for a player to get killed over and over again by other players they have no chance in killing? It is like pvp players are deliberately using all the workshops as hunting grounds, costing the other players caps. There should be something that helps the adventuring/builder player more. So far it seems pvp players get the best rewards and opportunities.
---
It was mentioned a few inside the vaults back about how they are looking into adjusting expsolsive weapons. I don't have a link or what one it was. I think it was around the time they put AGLs back on the bear arms perk card.
---
That’s because they’ve struggled to balance out weapons since day 1. Soon bloodied weapons will get the next nerf just like tse did. And by challenging I just mean not level 21. Make it a location people would actually go to. Legendary at least. Deathclaws have always been the apex but I’ve never struggled with them in 76.
---
Got both pieces of the Mr Fuzzy outfit, that was a pleasant surprise!
---
The lake above the behemoth usually spawns some scorched or ghouls on the far side
---
It had dawned on me that although their admins are in the US but their programmers are probably overseas like in india, that’s why it takes forever to get something fixed, and with that fix there’s always new bugs introduced, maybe it’s because of the challenges in long distance communications and cultural differences.
---
Last time we tried launching a nuke, the progress bar lagged out on the reactor-fixing step and we couldn't progress. Hacking method works, but you need lockpick 3 and hacker 3 for that, which may be a barrier.
---
Also nuking prime is likely to be a giant waste of ammo unless you bring a team of bloodied players with you.
---
Wow.
---
Good to know.  Constantly getting plinked at by New Gad and the Lakeside Cabins...Not a big deal but from far enough away my turrets don't do shit.
---
Yeah it's really bad. Like when Im crafting lots of food items, particularly doing the super important thing of boiling water, I see this weird brief flash of slider bar, that allows setting an amount. Just like for example in trade menu setting a price. 
---
But crafting menu has no such thing. It's not supposed to have such thing. Yet when you craft stuff fast, you will see it over and over. What is that? Why it's popping up consistintly? 
---
How could so many of interface parts of the game, be so badly made. It's like every action you do, has RNG 5% chance of doing something completely different, or possibly something that's not normally even an option on that part of submenu, except with that RNG roll.
---
Whitespring aside, all you need to do to find him is run from the moth man shrine to Billings homestead along the highway. Every time I do this, he spawns.
---
Yeah, I feel mole miners aren't the loot pinatas they used to be.
---
Most commonly he  shows up at Charleston train station, you trigger a random event by running  over the red bridge and back.
---
Well I don't think that should be an atom thing, some things I can see why they would be, but that was already in base game for FO4 so I don't see why it can't be included for free into 76
---
Probably the most dangerous thing you'll see up there is a pissed of dude who can't place his base because tons of people seem to camp there. I've been in pvp with groups there who rage quit, just to see another person load in in nearly the exact same spot before I even finished tallying up my shiny new junk.
---
They should do this for someone who doesn't have enough caps to cover their bounty. They  have to work off their debt.
---
It’s not so much about lvl as it is about the role(s) we all play.  I never ventured to SBQ until I got to about lvl 75 and at that time really focused on letting the big dogs attack the SBQ and went after the crap on the ground harassing the tanks.  
---
Now I’m 150+ with decent weapons to put a dent in the queen so I do that.  
---
My frustration is when people show up to gravy train or not contribute to the fight.  I see that more with lower levels, but not exclusive to just them.
---
&gt;Creatures turned scorched: Angler, Bloatfly, Bloodbug, Cave Cricket, Deathclaw, Flog Crawler, Grafton Monster, Gulper, Hermit Crab, Honey Beast, Megasloth, Mirelurk (Crab, Hunter, King, Queen, Spawn), Mole miner, Molerat, Mutant Hound, Nuke Code Officer, Rad Ant, Radrat, Radroach, Radscorpion, Radtoad, Attack Dog, Snallygaster, Stingwing, Tick, Vicious Dog, Wendigo, Wolf, Yao Guai
---
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING TO KNOW THIS. I'd assumed as much, just judging by the damage my Prime Hunting Rifle dishes out, but it's not exactly easy to tell in the clusterfuck of an SBQ fight. =P
---
Whenever you see a cargobot flyaround, take it down. Also any one of your friends or anyone close by can all get nuke codes from the same drop, you only have 5 minutes once the box drops and you open it, but say if you have 3 friends, all of you can get a nuke card. I have 2 characters, 2 xboxes, what I do is make sure both characters are next to it when I open it, then I grab 2 cards, then I spawn in an alt, I have just enough time to grab a 3rd card from the same box.
---
I thought so too and I've seen others say the same but honestly I don't think its in there. I've got over 700+ hours and been to the medical wing 100+ times easily! I know all the plans and nothing new every pops up. I'm not giving up though lol.
---
You should try crying about it.
---
Yes. Way less crashes and bugs. It still has its issues but it’s worth checking out. 
---
Purely anecdotal story, but this weekend me and three friends got together for a game day. I bought them each a copy of 76 (they wouldn’t have ever bought it and I got 3 special editions cheaper than just my base game at launch, $45 for all three!). I told them we’d play it just for fun, if anything we could just make fun of it. However, once they started playing it, they each really liked it. It was a fun experience for them and they’ve played it since solo.
---
*cough* brotherhood fatigues *caugh*
---
What? oh, yea, i would like brotherhood fatigues as not an underarmour
---
I have one but never had a chance to use it, does it make ghouls glow?
---
It's subjective.
---
It's a Fallout game without NPCs or companions. This includes typical Bethesda quirks/bugs/glitches.
---
There's room for improvement and that does come through updates. They update it regularly.
---
I like it for the players/community.
---
Todd Howard denied us the power to remove them the use of joining another server.
---
Bwaaam!
---
And also stop overworking your employees to the point of mental breakdowns pls.
---
It's a good thing the server wasn't full or else the server probably would have melted.
---
I'm under the impression it heals them.
---
I don't think it's in the game to be honest but I'm not going to stop looking haha!
---
Nuke it
---
Its a pointless feature, and hinders gameplay. It was cool the first time it happened, then it got annoying real fast
---
Honestly. The reason you dont see as many Queen nukes is that its 6 months into the game and she just doesnt have any appealing loot for people. She's a 30minute capped 3star fight with a few ultracite plans that makes her unique. It's not worth the resources/time spent trying to kill her
---
she has also had the serum plans removed off her lootpool in this patch. so theres that aswell.
---
Add that and a regular 3star mobs lootpool and the question turns into "Why should i bother doing the Queen when encryptid has the same drops and requires less time and resources?"
---
Bethesda has promised a rebalancing of her, but it seems like they've forgotten to actually do that, since they havent mentioned her in weeks now :(
---
Okay can you get on in 10 min my gy is crazy cool 926
---
i was having this same problem with west tek yesterday .4 time my game crashed trying to go through the front door
---
Yeah and i dont think it would be too much work to change some code bit (dont know anything about game making dont judge) just like fallout 4 had with outfits
---
Plans are drops from events i had them on my other character
---
My favorite character is full explosive, grenades of every type for every situation. A few AGLs, of various effects. A Fatman and missile launcher. It's expensive but no other character I've played is as fun.
---
I am at work until late afternoon pst. Will you be available then?
---
4 Places? What are they? SBQ, Whitesprings, maybe harpers ferry, and?
---
Rubbish. Go look at the linkedin profiles of some of the people listed on the credits: https://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/fallout-76/credits
---
They are almost all at Bethesda Maryland or Bethesda Austin.
---
My theory for the slowness and (re-)introduction of bugs is that the Maryland team has largely moved on to Starfield at this point, and the Austin team are less experienced with their tech.
---
Should have pointed this out in my post, but it was getting a little long winded.  I was always a solo player and launcher until I recently hooked up with these guys and a couple of them have seen overlapping nuke drops with 2 Queens before, but this was the first time for everyone together, and the title reflects the fact that we got 2 with one launch, which was definitely a first for everyone in my group.
---
Yes! Thats one that i would love to use since its only urban camo besides enclave armors
---
Spot on
---
No I’m sadly not I can only be on till 1:00 today
---
Being mostly super mutants, I suspect you'd just get glowing masses, etc. There are already a couple of legendary mobs there (chickenshits that run away) so I don't think many people consider it a place to nuke. 
---
Also, automod is on a roll today, it got me too.
---
This is incorrect. The only thing that changes eith the amount of people there is the amount of adds. She gets no increases whatsoever. Check my post history where I actually show proof of this
---
No sadly not I will only be on till 1 today
---
If you could switch whenever, builds wouldn't matter. Character investment goes down.
---
Do you remember what event?
---
I'm guessing it was since this one is only a few weeks old and all the posts are the same crap.
---
Gotcha, so it wouldn't increase the chances for more legendary enemies? What do ghouls drop that's better? I don't run nuke zones much.
---
As far as I can tell, it's only Diseased creatures. 
---
It's because the Diseased trait often overrides Legendary in the enemy's name.
---
Obviously anecdotal, but I've never seen a non-diseased non-legendary drop a legendary.
---
Any time this evening? Or Tuesday morning?  I have tomorrow off.
---
Yes. Great community in and out, excellent world design and plenty of lore goodness.
---
Pretty sure I got it as a random loot find .. I will check to make sure I am not confusing it with something else .. don't think I used it, so might still have it in my notes.
---
Because things are so messed up!! Now the alert system is bugged so when a nuke is launched we are not eeven notified most of the time now. I was on Friday. Saturday and Sunday almost all day long and out of the 15 nuke launches I counted, I missed 12 of them because there was never any alert (IM on PC....)
---
Also Sunday night during the SBQ event, we were kicking her ass and right when we were about to klill her, she simply few off for the mountains north east of Watoga to never return and the event failed.... WTF Bethesda??? This was a first seen for me....There went almost a 1000 rounds of shotgun ammo for nothing...
---
I would launch more but with things so buggy lately its not worth it....
---
... because you couldn't get the Easter head?
---
I mean I'm disappointed, but not that fed up about it lol
---
If you provide materials I can make level 30 weapons for you. My GT is Xwolfpackleader
---
Let me know. I'll happily buy it off you lol
---
Granted. 3 star enemies no longer drop any items.
---
Exactly what low levels should do ... pot a single shot at the Queen to get the reward, then keep the crap off the backs of those doing the damage on the BIG baddies.
---
Got a Bullet Shield, Heavy Gunner build ONLY for the Queen fight ... love to focus my attention on making that useful to everyone else there.  Hard to do with dogs, ants, and Scorched nibbling at your bits while you shoot.
---
I snagged a Bloodied Gauss Rifle 😁
---
3* Suppressors Golf Club? Faster swing speed, reduce damage when blocking, lowers targets damage output. 1 cap.
---
I should be on tomorrow I’ll let you know tho
---
It's a popular CAMP spot. Lots of flat land and a scenic view. I've got my CAMP right next to a magazine spawn by the lake.
---
I think enemies just naturally spawn to attack your CAMP no matter where you put it, but it's usually just a bunch of trash mobs for me. There aren't many existing enemy spawns there other than the Behemoth, I think.
---
I feel like the average solo player (90%+ of the people playing) that doesn't run an optimized build is going to have a real slog of a fight with the SBQ, so it's just not worth it. They also can't farm glowing / hardened mass and high rad fluids in the amount needed to mass craft Ultracite ammo because they don't have a way to respawn the nuked mobs. Many players also aren't good at silo runs, whereas I've optimized it so I can launch a nuke in 15 minutes or less. Most simply feel that it isn't worth it due to how respawns work.
---
Personally, all I do ls launch nukes, but I'm not the average player - I run two accounts simultaneously. All of my end game activity revolves around 2 things - keeping myself supplied with ultracite ammo / junk / consumables, and farming legendaries. 
---
In my opinion, it's not worth nuking things like Whitesprings anymore unless you have a friend to run with or can run two accounts. Either will allow you to reload your nuked zones over and over. I run two accounts so I still do this. If you're in my game, you'll notice that the ghouls respawn about every 10 minutes. That's not a coincidence. That's because I'm respawning them by leaving and rejoining. If you want to farm with me, you just need to ask. My only rule is that I don't slow down and I don't wait for tags, so you either keep up or get left behind. Bringing a tesla rifle and using it to bounce shots off of me in order to tag mobs is highly recommended if you want exp, but you'll still get loot even if you don't tag, as long as you're in my group.
---
SBQ is still worth it, but only if you nuke it in the right spot. 99% of random nukes that I see are as far in the bottom right corner as possible, and this wastes 70% of the nuke area because it's in areas that you can't go to, and it misses the best violet flux farming spots. Honestly the SBQ is more of a "Why not? I'm already nuking for flux." than anything else. Should also be noted that I can carry the SBQ fight. I typically advertise my SBQ nukes on certain Discords, but lately the game servers always seem to be full so they can't get in, which is a shame because I have some friends that are just as well optimized for pve damage and geared as well or better than I am, and having several of us there makes the fight go even faster. Our record was about 2 minutes. Even solo, it never takes me more than 5 minutes. If more people were willing to optimize their builds and do cooperative farming, they could be doing as much dps as I am.
---
The other areas I farm are Harper's Ferry and West Tek super mutants for steel. I've thought about nuking them so I can get glowing / hardened mass and high rad fluids while farming steel. Might bring a lot of attention there though, which means people killing my spawns, which I don't want. Might try it out to see how it goes though.
---
ugh? yes but still not worth it 
---
t.guy who uses bloodied build
---
I should be on tomorrow I will let you know tho
---
That's pretty lame that people were trying to mess with you.  There's no level gate to do the event, and good players with good gear shouldn't care if a lvl 5 wants to try their luck and plink away with a 10mm pistol.  Chances are there 4-5 players with god-tier gear doing at least 50% of the work anyways.
---
I have two completely different perspectives on the event from two wildly different characters.  One is a stealth sniper and the other is a T-51b/super sledge guy.  Either way, if you want to keep crickets, scorched and other random mobs off my ass while I'm focusing entirely on the queen, be my guest.  Happy to have the assist.  Sometimes I get jostled around by a couple random dogs, crickets, radscorpions (ugh) and would love someone to kill them all for me so I could keep mashing power attack while the Queen is down, instead of turning around to clear the vermin away before getting back to work.  You could be level 1 and I would commend your bravery for stepping up to the plate.  As long as you're doing something productive, other players shouldn't try to shoo you away.
---
Fallout76 has two sides.  Players are generally friendly or at least polite when not in combat, but tend to get salty and selfish when rewards are involved.  I can't say I haven't gotten irritated at times, particularly when someone refuses to share kills at a Whitespring nuke, but I always try to remember that poster I hang above the bed in my CAMP.  "We're In This Together".  
---
If you play on PC, I'll be happy to help you with a silo run or tank ghouls at the Whitespring for you.  IGN shankwell
---
Would love it, I'll be on tonight about 430
---
 Also from Wallace I got a level 45 Instigating Lever Action. Could not believe it, about 350 caps.
---
So you..... do NOT like the card shuffle then.
---
Although he's not my personal favorite, I agree that it was interesting to see his past. He was certainly no saint, but he also didn't seem to be the monster that he was initially portrayed as.
---
It's the way that inventory information is passed to the server. It's a terrible terrible way to do things. Instead of using a unique ID they just use the location of the item in the array. This causes a lot of the issues we see
---
That was bioware
---
I kind of disagree. It's a low level area and this is something fun for newbies to stumble across, not a place to farm deathclaws.
---
I only go through 2-5 plasma cores per fight and I've picked up over a 100 just exploring. Seems I always find a stash right after a fight. I save it just for her because it's so much fun using a TSE gatling plasma during that fight.
---
Heal ghouls to destroy Golf Club turret camps without getting wanted. ;)
---
Yep, I have it and am on for a little bit before bed.
---
2* vampire minigun 30% vats.  Imposter sheepsquatch head.
---
It doesn't exist. Checked in the ESM and it's not in the recipe list or the list of constructible objects. They probably forgot it.
---
How about we get some balance with weapons already in game?  
---
I would love to run a crossbow or cryolator build, maybe use a furious drill on some ghouls, or cut up a mirelurk with a chainsaw.
---
Right now, those aren't feasible.
---
Do they get 1h buffs?
---
Thanks. On ps4 sadly but got a pretty large multi platform discord I roll with so never have a lack of people to play with
---
What platform?
---
Ok gt is impartialpants9
---
No way, gutted!! Thank you for letting me know!
---
&gt;PS: All my slaves are participating willingly and do get paid
---
Not a slave then ;)
---
LOL. MY no Legendary Serrated Combat Knife hits at 150 when re4paired to 200%. My Nocturnal 40% Speed onje is ri9diculous and hots around 185 at night. That's about 4 times a sec. Melts Ghoul Hordes.
---
I haven't seen grahm in months, miss that guy.
---
I guess that makes 2-Shot even more worth it. Since you could get 2 arrows back.
---
Good idea, I mean you would still have to earn the points to enable the levels, but it would be so much faster than scrolling a catalog of perk cards every time .
---
Never trade on LFG, I've hunted down more than a few people who have ripped off friends. Just don't do it.
---
You play on PC?  My melee guy uses pistols as a ranged option, and my pals always give me good drops.  I just gave away a two-shot single action yesterday because I'm running out of stash space and I'm too lazy to make a mule.
---
Shame about those mods huh
---
I used energy weapons exclusively, early on, even before the patch/fix.  For light work I swap between the cryolater and tesla rifle.  For heavy work I use a two-shot gatling prime plasma to open up with and I switch to a executioners prime gatling laser to finish.  I do NOT like the charging barrel versions at all, they cut down the rate of fire way too much for the damage increase they have.  Both gatlings are 1 star weapons, haven't had much luck finding multistar versions of energy gatlings.  When I am perked up they are amazing, and when I am not they are still very effective.  I would probably not try to use them in pvp due to the spin up time, but for pve they work fine for me.  I wear Excavator or T51 depending on my needs at the time.
---
I’m sure they mentioned something with breaking down the ammo when talking about adding certain qualities of life alongside fridges and storing junk without returning to a stash
---
because the slot machine design worked so well for wow battle for azeroth /s
---
theres nothing wrong with grinding but make peoples time worth it
---
Max level Vampire-Swing Speed Grognak Axe. I found it at the enclave vendor when I was around level 30-ish, bought it immediately and held on to it until I was level 50. It's still one of my favorite weapons to this day.
---
I play on PS4
---
Legendary Drill and Syringer. Why someone would sell those sweet queen drops. /s
---
Well it’s not like they slowed down or anything, it’s always been buggy from launch so there’s little difference between the two offices if what you said is true. It actually runs much better now than a few months ago. The ‘less experienced’ team has been performing well.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
...Lore like blowing a dam killing thousands directly for the "crime" of self defense, and **everyone** indirectly by spreading the scorched plague with infected water and drowning out the cure project. 
---
Raiders and griefers aren't the same things though both should be shot on site. But griefers deserve to be hounded off the server and out of video games entirely.
---
Ghouls don't drop better. But they change from normal to glowing, so they get max lvl. 
---
Those muties are already max level.
---
It is way faster to clear and server hop, than nuke (pull all players from whole server there) and try to clear it.
---
There are a lot of misconceptions regarding these dust piles. The actual bug is that the pile doesn't despawn when all the players that tagged the enemy fully loot the container. If it's just a 'loading...' then it's been fully looted and should normally despawn. And if you aren't the one that looted it, it means you didn't tag it enough to register the kill and get nothing. Happens with normal weapons sometimes too. The other problem is that they can stack, so an empty container might be sitting over one that hasn't been looted, preventing you from doing so. Happened to me at Whitespring the other day.
---
Right on.  Best of luck to you, sir.
---
The Queenie is deadly to me only when I go to melee her when she is at 40% (have a executioners hammer), before that the only threat is adds.
---
So, the answer to your question is, from my point of view, yes. A big yes.
---
Her scream and piss cloud is annoying, but not a real threat. I'm usually on T-60 armor and can easily withstand her attacks. The adds on the other hand keep nipping my health slowly and slowly and many times have to stop DPS on Queenie because I have two or three melee adds on my back.
---
I wish more people would understand the necessity of add clearing. If I see lot's of 150+ levels on event I'll focus on adds, as they will probably have better DPS than me with their TSE, AAE and FE weapons.
---
I bet the coming 4-man raids will be an tough learning curve for some people. Add control, tanking and cc in general.
---
 You talking Heavy Combat Armor? You want the BoS mod, not Fiberglass.
---
As far as we know.. pi))*_()(_)_)(
---
Baaaaaaaaah!
---
NO CARRIER
---
I love you folks that nuke fissure prime. I haven’t made a run yet but I’m finding it very difficult to have enough ammo to do anything really. I’ve been collecting resources mostly and use most of my ammo that I get up defending it. It’s a vicious cycle.
---
I have a full Heavy set of BoS Combat Armour but I prefer the look of Fiberglass.
---
Bummer, I'd be happy to unload a couple solid pistols on you, since I'm sure they'd be put to good use.
---
https://imgur.com/HlCCDRq just collects dust.
---
Game is slowly dying, better enjoy it now, before there will be only 2servers going.
---
This is true, but the cap limit is also a problem. There are still things worth a considerable amount of caps, more than the limit, such as legacy weapons. It is impossible to trade these for what they're worth, without the risk of scamming. 
---
Even with a UI that allowed trading multiple items at once for a single thing, I shouldn't be forced to trade for items because of a money limit that's incredibly low. You know plenty about real life economy, but real life economies don't have a money limit, besides the obvious tax increases.
---
At WS and in the burrows all the regular ghouls turn into glowing ones who drop more loot and give more xp. They're much more abundant there. There are also SM in Haper's Ferry above the burrows and they don't seem to do anything special other than drop their newly formed cancerous tumors. I suspect West-Tek would be similar.
---
Oh it could be... but it won't. Look at the steps? The base game ones look lik e they were robbed out of a sinking warehouse, now we get a bit of an upgrade with rails and gotta buy it from shop.
---
Nope, anything Xtra is coming thru shop.
---
You should lead with the M79 then follow.with the grenade. Or you will negate the effect of the legendary.
---
I personally use a AA/limb AGL it wreaks havoc and keeps things from getting to close because what doesn't die in the first volly has to crawl to you. And sometimes they don't even have arms in which to hit you. 
---
If you get good at fast throwing regular grenades the explosion of the first one will detinate the second one killing most mobs in one glorious boom. 
---
Another grenade thing to know is they can be targeted in vats and shot to make them explode. In some set ups my friend will target my grenade mid flight and shoot it as it fly's into the mobs. This is good if on a slope because the grenades like to roll away.
---
Mines are not that great. You can't Chuck them they kinda just fall at your feet and you can have only two mines out at a time throw a third and one of them explodes. If they are to close and one does that and they all explode killing you.
---
Mini nukes are great but with out Ordinance Express is just to heavy to carry much ammo. My guy usually has around 40 minis at any given time to just give a big FU to any large beast or group of super mutants.
---
Missile launchers break incredibly fast. Mine has a quad barrel and I get 3 reloads out of it that 12 missiles before it breaks.
---
Learn how grenades bounce and ping them off door ways just to wreck face.
---
Thanks. Got a 3* AA western ilk be using once I'm at 50. Should be great
---
Do people legitimately use Nukashine? I have lots of quantums but have never made a Nukashine outside the first quest. I am hanging onto the ones I've picked up in case they are needed for a Tipsy Taste Test but I don't use them otherwise.
---
becouse in the time i clear silo and launch nuke a some douchebag oneshot all glowing ones before i even fart i can go to westtek and farm 4x more legendaries with more chances at 3\*
---
I wish! Thought I would get something good from a nuke dropped on Whitesprings. Came across a few 3 stars but only got 1 star. Two of the Legendary enemies dropped there loot on the ground which I could not pick up.
---
You can see the item clearly shows it's a legendary item but you can do nothing but kick it around.
---
Awesome!
---
RC
---
It's called role-playing
---
Same with sweet rolls
---
4:30am? Pm?
---
ok this is amazing if Bethesda does this i will personally make sure they live
---
Is there any word on if using mods on PC that aren't outright cheats is okay and wont result in a ban?
---
If you'd said it had 40% faster swing speed as well then I'd say there's no question to switch. As you have it, idk, other factors come into play imo. Levels, personal preference as to how it "feels", etc.
---
What’s the base attack? Over 9000????
---
I'd like outfits which look like full armor sets, which appear over your under-clothing.  Armor sets look cool, armor mish-mashes not so much.
---
Same buddy
---
&gt;They are really missing the mark in the atomic shop. Even worse now that they have taken some of the coolest items out.  I doubt that many Fallout players want Easter dresses. We want cool looking mad max shit. We want more weapon skins like the Lever action got. not lame ass golden "call of duty" skins, and tuxedos. what a shame.
---
Not everyone wants the same thing. You think you know what will sell better based on what you and your friends want, or even popular opinion on this subreddit, but that's a pretty small fraction of the player base. They have access to a lot more player data and market research than you do.
---
I've been in quite a few nuked zones this week. What system are you on?
---
 ROTFLMFAO.
---
&gt; Silo Bravo might have been interesting, since indoor areas can benefit from nuke zones, but the only note of interest is that silo interiors aren't affected by nukes.
---
Sort of makes sense :)
---
Or they should use a stable sort, so resorting wouldn’t be visible. 
---
In this case I’d typically sort on the primary key first and name second and probably something like item id last.
---
wait, so you posted this without having tried it recently?
---
What would the rationale for that be? (Not being judgmental, legitimately curious)
---
If you're on XB1 I'm down to nuke the area with ya and see what comes out
---
Thank you!
---
I kinda don't even understand why wood armor was added to the game at all. You can right out of the vault build leather armor that is better without needing any perks to do it, just scrap material.
---
Could sell it to other players or drop it in cash registers at train stations for low lvl players :)
---
Thats not the only reason lol
---
Good for you, I mean, it's a team effort. I usually end up getting swarmed by adds, so I switch to mop up duty, which is fine. I don't run a bloodied build or anything, so having, well, anything other than Yao Guai or a Mirelurk Queen come at me isn't going to do a whole lot, as long as I keep an eye on my rads. Better me than the big guns (literally and figuratively). Conversely, my main ranged weapons for Scorched Earth are both Furious (a Handmade and an Explosive Gatling), so if I'm trying to focus on dealing damage, I want that shit as far away from me as possible.
---
Basically, those people are a bunch of cocknoses, and should feel bad.
---
Yes i especially when you want particular legendary effect and for them to all match is a little more difficult.
---
If i remember correctly Fo4 had some sort of armor outfits
---
Yeah, the last time I went to kill the queen I lagged out for minutes at a time, and then got disconnected. It's not worth it until Bethesda fixes that.
---
They would rather make everyone angry with repair kits instead.
---
There's a lot of enemies inside. Always high level. Either super mutants or robobrains and gutsy's. So I figured it'd be a good place to nuke. I thought there would be a high chance of legendary spawns having so many enemies. I am on Xbox but can't try this til later. Like 8 hrs from now
---
May 23 itll be out and we have little info on him
---
No one knows until Bethesda releases more info.
---
The All Rise is a good weapon, but it is easily beat by other legendary weapons. Furious tends to be bad for heavy damage melee weapons because it probably kills them in one hit usually. Instigating is way better if you are not specialized or don't use team play.
---
Gotcha, and awesome - that actually works on my end as well due to work. GT QuasarSilva - shoot me a message when you're on!
---
\*chuckling\* I've seen it from time to time, much like the elusive pink alien monster with no legs. ;)
---
No
---
something similar happens if you drop items to fast. the game will randomly select legendary equipment to drop. its always worth it to check your bag as a precaution.
---
Well, setting up an extractor at the Gulch Workshop would be a good start, there is a black titanium pit there!
---
I've seen people nuke the steakhouse across the street for the flux (big garden out back with all kinds of different plants). Kinda seems a waste not to throw RobCo into the mix.
---
Will do! And same here! Working now 😫😂
---
give us a toggle for both sound and display seperately. I would turn off the display, ut leave the sound so I get notice if I grab one in a shoot-and-loot junk run somewhere.
---
That’s just crazy talk.
---
wow, what a game huh?
---
Thank you so much
---
What platform are you playing on?  Appalachia was red hot (literally) Easter Sunday all day.  The server I started on around 11am eventually crashed because people were launching nukes literally as soon as they could get back into the silos.  It was non-stop for 3-4 hours.  There was a constant pile of triple blasts on SBQ all day.  I burned completely through 5000 round of 5.56 through a semi-auto handmade and had to stop participating in favor of hunting down more lead and steel.
---
Most of my guns are two shot! 
---
LOL 😂😎
---
I'm nearby on the lead deposit due east of there. Almost nothing but rad rats and the occasional scorched. On occasion another player will lead some supermutants up there, but you really don't have to defend against much.
---
I bought a TSE 10mm just so I could apply the paint lmao
---
I drop it in Overseer boxes for lowbies.
---
Ps4
---
Anything you read about how it will work is mostly speculation.
---
Okay thank you 😊
---
This is absolutely true. I did a queen fight the other day and instantly thought why the hell am i here? Ill get nothing, use up most of my ammo and than have to go farm for springs cause my guns will break. Its really amazing how everything they keep doing has me asking why should i bother.
---
I’m not saying I have a problem with it. I’m just pointing out that your description of raiders seems inaccurate. In the game I play just like a raider myself. I kill everyone I see.
---
I'm honestly surprised we didn't start off with having to use wood armor from the start. It's such a weirdly placed item. Almost no mods save the stealth upgrade and that's nowhere near the starting area. It's just...why?
---
But radiation only reduces maximum health so won't you still have to do their entire health bar in damage?
---
There's only the one option. It also lacks a few important shapes like an inside corner. Hopefully there will be more options available to us in the future.
---
I love it, but usually wait until just after the blast dissipates.  The initial rush is long gone and I maybe have to compete with 1-2 other players.  You lose out on the high value flux making materials, but I'm just there for the legendary gear.
---
I know I have fiberglass for the chest, don't remember for the limbs. If you don't find it anywhere, I can craft you some in exchange for karma.
---
I won't be on until later tomorrow, though.
---
I got a instigating Tesla rifle for a low amount of caps then resold it for 1.5k caps on the market. I also got a bloodied gatling gun but that got swiftly replaced by a bloodied gatling plasma that was randomly dumped into my lap by a member of my ps4 community.
---
I have so many nuke cards I launch one at random locations around the map fairly often.
---
Sell it on the player market
---
I am on XB1, but unlikely will sell it unless both my mains have it, then I might do you a favour .. but let me try find it .. I have 9 characters, just need to figure which one picked it up .. pretty sure I got it at whitespring
---
I'm obviously not op, but I certainly wouldn't mind taking them off your hands if you'd like? :)
---
I had my C.AM.P. there for a while at the start of the game. That spot looks really nice, but after a while the Scorchbeast’s that hangout behind the Whitesprings Resort will really annoy you. They are scripted spawns in that area. They come from a couple different directions, but mostly from the nearby Fissure Site.
---
Having to constantly server-hop because of the roaming Scorchbeats
---
 there got really old. 
---
I would suggest going a little further North so your location is more centralized on the map for Fast Travel. With the added bonus that
---
On PC it's 20 hrs after the first interaction(sale/purchase) from any vendor bot.  Since I sell to the vendors at whitesprings everyday @1130pm ( when I log in) they are available again the next day. Hope this helps
---
Does that record whether there is an increase in damage resistance?
---
I think this is the answer, when they instanced the nuke stuff for some reason they made it so hardened mass can drop multiple, and high radiation fluids I've only ever seen one at a time. 
---
The instance change also made it so you can't clean up after others anymore which also probably make it feel rarer
---
I'd even be OK with the old Fallout NV system of needing specific primer caps for different sizes so you couldn't just magic 10mm into 50 cal. All that stuff I dump in suitcases hurts the hoarder in me.
---
My sheepsquatch idea includes rebuilding my power armor into T-51b for max resistances, probably swapping legs to AP regen mods to keep up Dodgy, and using a vampire’s 25% fire rate 50cal to maintain my health. Ideally also with 15% reload. Add in speed demon and the fast reload perk for HW, and you fire a lot of bullets, very fast, for insane regen, and reload very fast when you’re dry. Stack up Blocker for 45% melee Reduction from the ‘squatch, Serendipity for 45% avoidance for everything, dodgy for 30% reduction as long as I can maintain AP,  E Protocols for 50% reduction, Empath from an alt (I guess I’m not totally soloing it, I run 2 clients with a mid level mule character sharing Empath and situational perk cards and enabling Strange in Numbers on my main, although I don’t use SiN in combat because it breaks Adrenal Reaction), and I’m thinking Suppressor perk as well, and the ‘squatch itself gets pretty tankable. The big problems are the health drain from the conduits- if I’m trying to take all 3, as a low health build, it could be very difficult as they don’t seem to care about any damage reducing effects you have. I don’t notice a difference in how much damage I take from pylons between my tank build and my normal max-DPS build.
---
When sneak was working. I was able to stab enemy in face, re-croch and stab him again with sneak multiplier. Escape artistan don't work anymore so yeah, those weapons are useless
---
I can see that. It's something I could do with one or two other people, but I hate fighting the crowd -- and I find most people in Whitesprings events don't share the legendaries. They just go in for the kill, and you have to hope you got damage on it.
---
Interesting. I hadn’t noticed that. Good info, thanks!
---
As MANY other have posted/responded to posts.
---
Modding with premade mods does not work ATM broke since patch 8. Wait till Tuesday. Hope they fix it.
---
The thing is, there's a a ton of that alreadyin the game. Dirty torn outfits. Survivor looking outfits. Mismatched armor over filthy longjohns. All kinds of typical post apocalyptic looking clothes are already in the game, for free. Camp stuff, too. Run down post apocalypse shacks made from scavenged junk? It's already there. What's not in the game, though, is clean prewar outfits and camp decorations.
---
1000 caps each and they're yours.  I won't be on tonight, but add my IGN shankwell, you can usually find me at my CAMP next to the Whitespring Station and remind me of what you're looking for.  I'll dig them out of the crate no problem.
---
I would love that saying how I like to make my character look like a more disfigured pug but sometimes I want to look badass
---
That’s actually an excellent idea to upgrade wood armor.
---
Clearly your eyes have been lying to you for a long time.
---
Ripper does. I haven’t checked the drill or chainsaw. 
---
A bloody ripper repaired to 200%, with 1h melee perks, is ridiculous damage output. It just doesn’t last all that long- damage drops fast once you get below about 150% repair. 
---
I’d think a mr handy buzzblade would do even more, but I haven’t found a bloody one, and the mod for it adding energy damage wouldn’t help much because it doesn’t benefit from Incisor.
---
I always go in there because its a great place for glowing fungus for radaway
---
I didn't think so either
---
It's sorted by the shit you DON'T want to consume. Why is that so hard for people?
---
Obviously my sarcasm wasn’t very clear
---
Uranium Fever is awesome for getting junk and leveling up, with the work bench right there, just loot everything and scrap it.
---
Make mule, you will have 5k of every ammo, then you sell it to other players.
---
I was kinda let down by the reward. I expected full costume. Just a hat is ok, but a full costume would have been better. 
---
And I would have LOVED a baby Deathclaw.
---
Wait this game has Slurm now?!?!
---
When you make a second account to piss and moan because you broke the TaC. 
---
Bravo
---
The Freak Show also often spawns Radscorpions.
---
there is no way to stack them unless you havn't gotten the quest yet
---
Naw, it was, I just wasnt sure if noobs would even know about extractors...I know I didn't when I started out!
---
I don't really see the issue. We can already tame Deathclaws, and cats, chickens, dogs, etc. Having a dog sized Deathclaw would have been AWESOME.
---
Pm Xbox is thenewfluff
---
she takes 30% damage from all damage sources regardless of how many people are there.
---
My main is melee. I do have ranged wepons Bloodied and Zealots.
---
For maxium dps from me she needs to land. Untill than i whoop the adds so the Range built characters can shoot her. While everyone should naturally work as a team since its is a Group Event.
---
But there are those S.P.E.C.I.A.L. people.
---
Lol I don’t think he owes you any of that. He just wanted to show his character...
---
Once you get the quest your inventory count will look like 1. You won't be able to split them individually anymore and itll drop all of them into the camp venture slot. Your best bet is to mule them prior to getting the forbidden knowledge quest.
---
I've only been playing a few days but I'm enjoying it. So far, there are plenty of quests to keep me busy. Exploring is always fun, and I haven't had any bad run-ins with other players.
---
Yeah, sometimes, mid game, I find a cool weapon, and suddenly, I have an idea... but, wanna switch back at some point, ya know?
---
I wish I could...
---
* Downgrade or split a leveled card
---
* Transfer a fully leveled, non-animated cards to any newly acquired animated card
---
* Move lock-pick and hacking cards to a newly created passive section
---
* Destroy a card 
---
While I'm wishing...
---
* Reset/re-spec my character (at this point, I would sadly pay for this ability)
---
But if you can craft it at the workbench, you can put it on your gun.  
---
I put a tri barrel on a friends gun for him.  
---
I could do yours if you are on PS4
---
A long long time ago, while trying to run some tests, a buddy of mine had some phantom DR we could not get rid of. It turned out his weapon had a 50DR while aiming legendary on it that was active simply from pulling the weapon out. He did not need to ADS to get it to activate. Maybe that was fixed since then, but I still believe you get the aiming bonus simply for having your weapon at the ready.
---
FUN GLITCH FACT: The 'bug' is just a text glitch that makes the pipboy/stashbox believe it has several of the same item when it actually only has one. If the 'real item' is moved from one 'storage container' to another (ground, stashbox, player, random container) then the entire pile will also move with it. Ive had this happen with Power Armor Chassis's with one being placable and the other not responding to any attempts to 'drop/place' but when I picked the 'real armor set' from the stashbox the other went with it. The same has happened with a Clown Costume, it's just a 'fake' glitch.
---
Can confirm. As soon as you unlock the last Easter egg you unlock this, no message or anything saying that you got it you just have to find it in the armor workbench.
---
That's not the point of the hunt. You get rewarded at the end for your dedication to the game. It wouldn't be fair on the people that logged in everyday to get the reward.
---
I was doing the things at the spiritual center too....  
---
Oh my god.....
---
If you already have legendary combat armor, I can convert it to BOS for you if you supply the junk to do it. 
---
In many cases it almost doubles your stats.
---
Ehh, as long as it's between two consenting adults there's no problem. Better make sure you ID em
---
I stumbled across a mad fight earlier today between a megasloth and a two star glowing Yao guai (also on the floor were two dead Yao guai and one dead baby megasloth rip). I'd just replaced my armor with some lesser stuff from stash as my decent gear was wrecked from a queen fight. Motherfucker downed me twice, I used about 10 stims, then when it was finally over I had to laugh because it was all for a mutants pole hook! Ah well one more for the pile, not long til the legendary vendor.
---
The gameplay is still the same, stability is better. Most of us are burnt out and jaded but starting fresh youll have fun as you will have purpose. Its  after 50 hours of finishing the game and confirmed 200 hours after that, that you realize its a tedious highly unrewarding grind and your goal simply becomes getting to the center of a tootsie roll pop in 3 licks or less only to find out theres no tootsie roll or its just a 1 star even though your pop was 3stars.
---
Condition loss probably is multiplied by damage as well, but if you had the same damage on a BP pistol and lever rifle, the BP pistol would still lose more condition per shot.
---
If you do have some spare mats and a lot of pistol perks, try testing the damage theory. Take off all your weapon damage perks for one run. Count the shots until it breaks.
---
See that’s my concern
---
They wont even put things back in the Atom shop that people missed out on and have had MANY people say they'd spend real money on. :(
---
I would LOVE some pet options.
---
That would be much better,
---
- if you are in group count to you too doesn't matter your hit the or not. (not only the last hit)
---
- if you are in group you get exp doesn't matter you hit or not.
---
- if you are part of an event and with others work as in group (you get exp from everything and count kill for challanges)
---
What platform are you on? I'm willing to bet someone would be willing to trade one-for-one on your BOS armor. I can craft all the heavy combat armor pieces, but won't know until I get home if I can also do the fiberglass mod on the limbs as well as the chest.
---
Looks like carnivore/herbivore. Bone and fertilizer are trash and easily found. Fluorescent flux is probably the most abundant in every nuke zone I see.
---
How much you looking to spend?
---
Damn that’s still a little ways to go then
---
So I can go ahead and assume this “random roll” is crap as well?
---
Instigating sledgehammer. Best 70 caps I've spent so far.
---
Hmm I don't think. Scrapping involves server check, I don't think server would allow scrapping legendaries.
---
But who really knows, over and over I see on new login to server, that occasionally some quest market items I have, are also laying on the ground on my feet.
---
As I haven't yet had the courage to take a swing from the nukashine, often I see that. Lately I spawned into a cliff near my camp, and I could watch the bottle to fall and roll down. So it even has frigging physics. And yet it's still in my inventory. That's pretty standard now.
---
One player I tried to trade with, at first some oddly way could not add me, and later said he couldn't anymore start his game, so he was doing repair install, and later he told few legendaries were missing on his inventory. And that part was pretty medicore level 35 armor piece that could not possibly been ever duped, even, so it couldn't have been removed by Bethesda. 
---
Hell I don't even know all the stuff I have, I might lose stuff without even notising it, particularly on mule char carrying dozens of useless legendaries waiting for Purveyor.
---
I love nuking things, but I hate rude players who refuse to tag things, they just show up and 1 shot everything.  White Springs, Burrows... it makes the effort and time taken to launch not worth it. I'll only bother  if there are very few people or mostly lower levels on the server.
---
I hated seeing the same perks multiple times. It makes sense now to have a couple with different levels now. Your comment makes more sense though. If you have a maxed out card why not be able to drop it to 2 or 1 star. Sometimes I don't have that much charisma and I can't share out a 5 star perk. I like this idea.
---
You cheated. You lost.  Move on.
---
Never said he owes me... I asked him if he'd share the details. Chill a bit.
---
Raiders can be mindless drug fuelled psychopaths, I just want to make sure people don’t feel belittled if they want to play a raider and are told they’re doing it wrong. That’s not how rp works. 
---
If we were all npc ai enemies, then yes, we’d be mindless killers. However, we’re not, and we shouldn’t have to be because some folks can’t imagine raiders with thoughts and motives. You played nuka world?
---
We had challeneges we are unable to do, take up space from chanllenege we could do. Therefor it was taken from us. Now if they add extra challenges once they do release the camera, or up the rewards for a limited time would be accptable. But we do need to be compensated in one form or another.
---
Awesome man, I'll give you an add when I'm next on! Looking forward to it :D
---
You should be banned on here too....
---
I lost both my excavator legs last night due to this. 10 flux to recraft and remod them. Ouch.
---
If you can put up with the toxic in-game community that then comes here to lie and make up insane stories about how helpful they are to new players out of some desperate need to be accepted, then sure it's worth it. The game is fun if you stay away from other players, that's IF you're not interested in PvP. Pretty much every player will try to fuck with you somehow. 
---
That said, the game is awesome. The bugs are completely overblown as they ALWAYS are, in any game, or any community whatsoever. Never had a crash, never lost my inventory, never encountered a friendly player. So basically, take the exact opposite of everything said on this sub, and that's the game.
---
This is a better alternative to prior Fallouts. Fallout 3/NV required pre-planning to make sure you would have the right SPECIAL allocation for the perks you wanted. 76 expands on the with the option to re-spec or fine tune with perk cards.
---
Bethesda did say they were trying to think of a way to let us sell/break it down, but no definitive answer on whether something would come from it or not.
---
Yeah... I feel your pain bro.
---
Fyi I went straight to 15 luck from the beginning. My rng is still average on just about anything.
---
Idk the market price but I’m willing to spend 500 caps just so I don’t have to search anymore.
---
Yeah, its unfortunate.  I remember players being a lot more communal about a nuke before everyone had their instigating weapon or ghoul slayer's automatic tesla rifle.  Maybe the last Whitespring nuke i saw that wasn't every man for himself was late December.  
---
If you ever catch my name Shankwell at a common farming location, I'm MORE than happy to share the wealth.  My melee guy has a tesla coiled T-51b torso piece and a vamp/ss/block sledgehammer to swap into specifically for pissing off giant mobs of ghouls and being the center of the mosh pit while everyone else can just smash/shoot at their leisure.  I'm happy to put my "OP" tank character to use for the benefit of others.
---
I mean, I don't agree that they are trying to target female gamers, at least not solely, but the fact that you think adding stuff that would appeal to females is a "negative aspect of the game" kinda says all I need to know about your opinions anyway.
---
There were literally a dozen scammers last night
---
I would be all for that change only if they significantly reduced the amount of 3 star enemies you find in the game
---
It's all over the place. I have 3 character. lv25 lv55 and lv 85 they all seem to get random dailies per character. My lv 85 (since beta) doesn't get any toxic valley, mire, or cranberry bog. He gets ecological balance every time though. My lv55 gets mire... He used to get toxic valley but they stopped one day. My lv 25 seems to get forest, mire, toxic valley so far. They ALL get the Camden daily. There's no ryme or reason but it seems the fresher the character the more dailies are coming up.
---
Hey I didn’t blow that dam.
---
Legendary wood armor shouldn’t exist in my opinion that’s all I ever get and it leather
---
&gt;	But we do need to be compensated in one form or another.
---
We really do not. We’ll be just fine, believe me.
---
I don't care what the levels are, as long as they are contributing something and not just mooching.
---
I run as a heavy gunner on SBQ battles using a Primed TSE 50 Cal, and a Primed Zealots Exp. LMG, so I'm Pounding the SBQ in the air &amp; on the ground, but frequently have to stop to get the adds off my back while the Melee guys just stand there staring at the sky. 
---
It does piss me off to see players of any level hiding in the Shed, or the Rampart and just doing enough to get the rewards without any significant risk.
---
Same things happen with selling, too.
---
Not gonna lie, lvl 144 here and i do this 100% of the time with dusky bois. They fuck me up, so ill kite them and usually people will help when the sbq is out of range. No shame in it.
---
No they aren’t. This game has gotten better by the day now that the cheaters like yourself are gone.
---
You are spot on. This is how a lot of online games work. They reward those who are dedicated and paying attention. 
---
ESO, GTA Online, Warframe, and many other games do this. The people asking for limited time stuff to not be limited time have probably never played those types of games. Or they are just very entitled and can’t stand that they are missing something that someone else has. 
---
It sucks to miss out on these items for sure. That’s life though. You can’t be everywhere at once and experience every single thing. Pick and choose. You didn’t log on that one day? You missed out. Move on.
---
Floor decor, look for the little deathclaw statue and scroll right
---
Also they need legendary crafting materials
---
I know you are right and it is a massive bummer.
---
That hopper ate all my ammo in beta. Every single last round. To this day, even knowing it's fixed, I'm hesitant to do it.
---
In floor decorations in one of the tabs with small statues.
---
Dirty Tan suit is one that comes to mind or one of the cool war era suits, both readily available, I can probably make you one if you on xb1
---
Legendary items feels like common 2.0 items and 99.9% of them are total garbage. They should be "Legendary" as name says and something truly special when compared to common items.
---
I farm tech data regularly. And it seems like you get something good maybe 1 out of every 25 runs (power armor or underlining plans).
---
Do you know that for a fact from modding or just being familiar with the internals, or is that educated guess? 
---
Certainly could explain if people (try to) drop some useless crap on the ground, but serverside they are actually dropping something important, and they can only observe it happened later on when they relogin. 
---
I've had some sync errors with trading with players, because my client thinks I got X amount of item and Im trying to sell them, while server actually knows I have X-1 and fails the trade as invalid. And then the other player is saying "uh I get trade rejected by server" and you have to figure it out.
---
Using location index sounds really horrible.
---
Can you only do one data at once?
---
r/Market76 sell it like I do, 1 cap gets you 4 bullets. This is a quick way to get caps.
---
Gotta be a bog standard, work-a-day schmuck suit.
---
You should have delivered the orbital strike they deserved...
---
If i could mod the drill into a crazy weapon on par with a deathclaw gauntlet id be okay with it
---
Someone nuked West Tek a few days ago on my Server and it was pretty lame. Just regular Super Mutants like always so nothing special.
---
Ammo seems to be one of four: 2mm, 40mm grenade, 5.56, or 5mm.
---
But health rewards tend to be tons of stimpacks. I get so many super-stimpacks from the tech data at one point I had 100+.
---
I just wish they would change it so the fricken mutants that attack my base every day attack my walls instead of my fruit and veggies.
---
Why do all the enemies in the game near my base hate my fruit and veggies?
---
I have a radio playing loudly at all times, why don't they go attack that?
---
 Anyway I agree with the OP they should have a repair what you can type button.
---
I may have a couple on my plan mule.
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much. I'm expecting the result of the eggs to be super disappointing anyways.
---
Exactly. But then when Bethesda sell the Easter eggs at £5 each, everyone goes on a rampage slagging Bethesda off saying they're money hungry and greedy. Games Devs cant win.
---
"edit: I play on PC"
---
Lol.
---
Today on multiple occasions i had a 3* legendary drop me either a drill, synringer or a freakin 1* autostim wood armor. Not even worth the ammo or the cost of repairing my armor from being swarmed by super mutants with miniguns.
---
You couldn't sell ammo.
---
Elder paint is the last one I need, but I'm not sure why I farm it. Elder paint looks terrible compared to Paladin or Officer. It looks more closely in line with Initiate paint than the others. =/
---
Im kinda okay with the real rarity of good things, but yeah stuff should be more consistent.
---
3 star should have high chance of dropping 3 star ect.
---
No, it heals them 30% more.
---
A true powerhouse.

Escape Artist still works, you just need to fall back a bit.

Man I would so do this if it was on Xbox...
---
Pissed me off when I couldn’t make another radio after I moved my base
---
He never changes inventory for me.   Each encounter is Groundhog Day.   Very disappointing.
---
Can confirm.  Worked for me multiple time over the weekend.  On PS4.
---
Hey, last time I was on Deathclaw Island, there were two deathclaws!  What more do you want?
---
My theory here is that duping + overly generous drop tables saturated the market early on and this is a correction. We weren't meant to be gods so soon. I'm a stealth sniper build and I'm sitting on tons of great armor and weapons that just don't fit my play style, almost all of it acquired from early drops.
---
I'm half tempted to start an alt and do nothing to aid that alt and see if the game is more enjoyable that way, struggling the whole time.
---
I highly doubt it. This game is 95% copy and paste from FO4.
---
Dirty tan suit then is bog standard and you can find them in various locations, I don't think a specific that randomly spawn. I have extra, are you on xb1. The war era suits are also standard and can be found at fort pricket or Helvetia museums ... I prefer them over the dirty tan but you can decide, you on xb1 ?
---
You're not selling in the right places then, I get max caps for simple shit like that all the time
---
What platform? Every queen fight I see on PC has a pretty solid group involved. 
---
Actually that’s a lie. I saw a nuke a month or so ago that I went to with my vats sniper alt. I was actually there alone for a bit, I think the person who launched it took a while to get unencumbered and able to fast travel. I think by the end there were still only 3 or 4 people there. It’s been the only failed nuke I’ve been to in ages.
---
They made finding the eggs part of the Easter Egg Hunt.
---
There were no turrets, it wasn't one of "those"...
---
No one remembers this because [you're wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-e46xdcUo).
---
Or you can find it here.
---
https://youtu.be/9_zgJ2energ
---
That's a bummer.  Any source?
---
 And you wear only Excavator, I do understand. I will laugh at you though. 
---
 Drop it somewhere it will be useful to someone. ;)
---
Right, one of the main points of this post was questioning whether having rad damage prevents Instigating from triggering.  I've gotten some mixed answers.
---
I use that mine to round out my cap runs. Often I end up clearing the area and then walking over to Whitespring to sell all the garbage the mole miners drop. Also a good, easy source of materials if you don't feel like outright selling the weapons.
---
For all the people complaining that you shouldn't get a 3* too often then why don't they just make 3* enemies more RARE. players should get rewards that match effort. If it's a 3* enemy, I want my 3* legendary. Don't want to give those out too much? Make 3* enemies EXTREMELY RARE. lower the spawn chance of the CREATURE not the loot. 
---
Bam fixed.
---
But, they also have to be the Unruly Golfer Ghouls.  And only 10 atoms reward.
---
(Got to make it as impossible and worthless to do as their current trend seems to be.)
---
5.56 can be rewarded? I honestly just keep getting grenades 😂 I have gotten 5mm before though. The only time I had any luck with tech data was when I used a second account to drop technical data 1 at a time (15 total).
---
....but you can switch builds whenever right now. And buying different perk card levels still lets you switch whenever. This is just charging multiple times for the same thing, and it doesn't make people play more.
---
Broken back. Not much else for me to do
---
Ah sorry to be redundant.
---
It’s a bunny head and you can get all the eggs in the atom shop but idk how long that’ll last so if u want want to get em
---
Yeah. I do upwards of 10 technical data a day. Grenades are extremely common (and take up so much weight, too).
---
yep .... got it
---
Supposedly, yes, they did. Apparently there was a “code list” in the Dev Room every week that the dev room hackers on PC found, so for as long as the dev room was available, people accessing it could just see the codes. I swear the maker of nuka-crypt actually made a post about this back in January or something. I believe he even posted a video with proof. I’ll see if I can find it.
---
How about all three XD. I have 13 years of programming experience and 3 years of reverse engineering experience. I've also released 2 mods so far. one which fixes the workbench repair bug and another which removes the news popup.
---
In my experience what happens is that if you attempt to do things too quickly it will send both of the locations in a short amount of time and sometimes the server doesnt see the first one so the second one ends up being seen first and can end up being the wrong location for something. trying to explain this actually gave me an idea that might help. I'm going to see if i can make a mod that stores the array variable locally and also expands on the item info in the array giving a unique id for each item. this will allow me to always be able to match up which items go where and never have to worry about this again.. Hopefully
---
I think the cups with straws in them have plastic, but I'm not entirely positive. I just know that some of the cups are tagged for plastic while others aren't.
---
Silly me indeed 😜
---
Not sure if you've played since the update, but the LMG is an absolute beast right now on a heavy build. The only limiting factor is its sorry ammo economy that's tied to the sniper rifle, and this is -barely- overcome by using a prime receiver because prime 308 ammo crafts at 86 a pop with LVL 2 ammosmith. Even more with super duper.
---
This is helpful since I just started runnin a junkie melee build. one thing I'm curious about is skeeto spit. I for one can not find Blood Sacs anywhere. Any tips?
---
Sell to other players or just dont pick up ammo you dont need to begin with.
---
how much are you willing to spend?
---
Thank you. Sent link to 20 friends
---
You can find lvl 10 legendaries, but your best bet is to do events. You get random 1\* legendary armor from them.
---
There's usually one hanging with a group of super mutants over near pylon V-13.
---
Bethesda (and cd project red, and EA) are notorious for overworking their employees as well. Nearly all major game companies are. You are right though at the most recently reported ones were at bioware.
---
Good point!
---
And it’s called a joke
---
Xbox mate.
---
I can craft the the Heavy set and already have, just can’t for the life of me find any Fiberglass mods/plans.
---
Friend of mine can craft the Chest piece but that’s all so far.
---
Honestly depends on the perks on it, if it’s vanguard sentinel I’ll pay 6k a piece at most yunno. Really depends on the perks
---
That sucks 😪
---
I've done the event probably 100+ times (it feels like 1000 but I never kept count) and I still enjoy it for the challenge, especially when a lot of low level players are participating and boosting the Queen's health and enemy spawn rate.  You've got a chance at a 3-star piece from the queen, one from the event reward, and there's always a 3-star random that spawns at her first health regen.  More often than not it's a radscorpion for some reason, but I have seen bloodbugs, yao-guai, a fog crawler and a wolf.  The problem is finding it in all the chaos.  If you have a good team, that's 3 chances at 3-starred loot for maybe 8-10 minutes of effort.  I don't mind the "free" stable flux and ultracite scrap either.  Serums are always in demand.
---
I know for instance GTA online would give you some sort of “money” back , but some days ago a guy showed a screenshot of him asking support to give his tse back , got a reply like “ in game items “ are out of help desk handling
---
I have a 1\* instigating harpoon gun that is actually pretty good with my adrenaline heavy weapons build. I basically use it like a slower RoF gauss rifle.
---
But I'm a special snowflake and want to know if it is worth it for ME!  /s
---
Found some legendary lv1 eyebots at Harper's Ferry. They dropped level 1 legendaries. They were on the side where the Super Mutants usually spawn. Good luck.
---
alright I hate to burst your bubble but the going rate for a single piece for a vanguards sentinel is minum 30k and on combat armor ive seen them go as high as 60k plus trades. Best of luck to you though.
---
My bloodied baseball bat and bloodied sledgehammer for under 200 caps total at a Whitespring Resort vendor. Those 2 weapons finally got me to focus on a specific build.
---
Still looked at the faction that did that and has (almost) every location they occupy full of heads on spikes and other dismembered bodies and said, "yes this is what I want to be a part of." You can't fault those of us in the Brotherhood, Responders, and Free States for responding to that ascetic with a barrage of bullets.
---
I've never compared the base Meat Hook with the DG or PF.  The Meat Hook is kind of a second tier melee weapon to begin with, so even with the boost from Iron Fist and Gladiator, I expect it to be better, but not substantially better.
---
I sometimes have issues with conduits. Most of the tines its because the place im wanting to place them is "non buildable" though. 
---
They seem a bit buggy, but the "passthrough" conduit is Absolutly fantastic.
---
Oh yikers that’s tuff
---
Brilliant!
---
If you provide the mats I can make you a full set of heavy BOS combat armor + mods.
---
Its pretty obvious that they dont listen anymore... :(
---
This was never a thing my dude.
---
I know but you just have to be a little smart than them?? Like obviously don't put your weapon up for 0 caps unless it's for a close friend. It's really not that hard to avoid people  like that. Just note the names and move on - buy and trade with people you see on there more frequently - like the shops I see on there daily.
---
Leader of the Pack apparently gives low level legendaries (near the dirt track/fair grounds). I've never done it and I think it only rarely pops up as an event.
---
Other than low level regular quest rewards, I killed a legendary dog once at the Darling Sister's Lab (was definitely not part of Leader of the Pack). I think it was level 5 and it dropped a bloodied pipe pistol. I was level 15 so I just gave it to a level 5.
---
Press down directional pad plus right thumb stick.
---
Sorry to hear that, at least you got something that keeps you preoccupied
---
Dev room. See my reply to OP in this thread.
---
The fixer just has different colored foregrips, stocks, and grips. The all rise  is just a super sledge with the concrete rocket mod.
---
Yes. See my reply to OP in this thread.
---
What's a shame about them besides Xbox and PS4 users can't use them they make the qol of the game way better
---
There was a cheat of sorts. See my reply to OP in this thread.
---
And, to be fair, it's not like the mainline Fallout games are bug-free either.
---
Stuff in 76 does get fixed.  The patch notes are quite long.  It's a question of priorities, I guess.
---
Does that one actually work on PC?
---
Or if it, itself was legendary ... make it unique ... worth something.  It stopped being a funny joke when it became more common than getting ANY useful item.
---
You know, it IS actually really hard to get a full set of wood armor! Nobody keeps it because they consider it worthless (most because it is due to terrible stats and unable to have more then one star legendary effect) but my full set of unyielding wood armor gives me a unique look and the fastest sneak speed around!
---
Oooh brain fungus
---
Yeah and that’s if you can find someone selling for caps. It’s damn near impossible to find that nowadays. I’ve been searching for a while. Your best bet would probably to keep your eyes out on the lfg. You can find some pretty sweet deals there.
---
&gt; Soon bloodied weapons will get the next nerf just like tse did. 
---
I doubt it, bloodied isn't really above and beyond any of the other good weapon affixes and it has a pretty huge drawback to maximize the damage it deals. Meanwhile TSE was like 4x stronger than the next closest options. In fact, TSE is **still** about as strong as bloodied tbh at 165% weapon damage, while bloodied caps out at 150% and b/e caps at 170%. If you add in the explosive perk tse beats out b/e 189% vs 182%.
---
Frankly bloodied itself isn't even that strong, it's everything you can stack with it that makes it wild... What people don't seem to realize is that you can do the same thing with several other weapon affixes. Instigating is the strongest legendary affix if you're not fighting SBQ/ISS and don't have a full auto. Furious is tied with bloodied for full auto users. Executioners is a great back half effect for SBQ/ISS. Then slightly behind all of that is AA, while not the best in any situation, a strong contender across the board for every weapon type except melee or anyone else who can manage to get their damage up above 1500.
---
I have more luck getting him by lady janet's soft serve

I am. What's your GT? (PM me)

Here is currently all the information that exists about the legendary vendor:
---
* Scheduled to be released May 23rd [Source](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/40o6r9tR5VkoMudGUgl9qg/fb745bd7f94a83991f95c53cf6bb8b8a/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-10-EN.jpg)
---
* Building located near Harper's Ferry [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b28221/legendary_vendor_location/)
---
* Will use some kind of token based system [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfyViQ9Uo_M)
---
Anything beyond that, is speculation. And as far as we know, those points are still subject to change anyways.
---
Like I have 1000 5mm that's gone
---
What’s the Ifg?
---
Rip, Accedentally just did this thinking something cool would happen. Not impressed.
---
Yea ive gotten it off legendaries...same with the syringer...only u can scrap the syringer for all the mods it has. I roll unarmed/melee and the drill as a weapon in concept sounds great...fuckin put holes in your enemies but you might as well tickle a supermutant and get better damage.
---
Yep mods work on PC and no one has been banned for using QOL mods
---
The looking for group on Xbox live it’s a great platform for finding traders and the prices are way more down to earth
---
Wish I remembered where I got the plans; I get most of my armor mod plans from the raider strip mall behind Pleasant Valley Ski Resort, although a fair amount come from the BOS camps around Watoga and associated missions.
---
2* vampires machete. Same vendor had sacrificial mod making it a 3* with 40% faster swing. Cost me about 100 caps with mod. Leveled me about 40 levels without using stims.
---
Ok thank you!
---
Oh yeah I use that all the time I just decided to try this too yunno just to put it out there
---
I’ll keep checking them out. Thanks for the replies bud!
---
I want them to fix all the current weapons/mods first, there’s so many broken/nonsensical weapons and mods it’s not even funny. Armor too.
---
Its is hard to be smarter than them when have the chat is them
---
Dammit Todd, you did it again!
---
It was for Psychobuff, not stats. I would definitely server hop at the enclave bunker, it likely will eventually show up .. or just keep checking back .. I will do the same if I am there to see if it pops.
---
Top of the world almost 99% of the time I’ve stumble into a burrowing surprise
---
Turrets should offer you a "ok" list with a black list if your friend is wanted you should be able to control you turrets to who's friendly bounty or enemy.
---
I notice this all the time, you have to really pay attention. I make sure to always give a second look before confirming.
---
Not in way it was before they broke sneak.
---
For melee it is super useles perk.
---
It's the only one I know of
---
No I can’t. But remember how restricted you are by a vestigial moral code. 
---
We are not. We are free of your autocratic bullshit. I don’t agree with everything my brothers and sisters do, but I’d pick them every time over cattle like you.
---
I plan on playing these games till I die....and I plan on living a very very long time!
---
Do leader of the pack, it's only one stars but they are level 5-15. Also the hoard events. As for locations check out arktos pharmaceuticals, and take a walk along the road that goes through pleasant point. Lots of random spawns along that road.
---
Though I didn’t personally nuke it, I have witnessed a few nuking General’s Steakhouse and Robco jointly. 
---
Robco was a bit of a disappointment. Though the exterior spawned some glowing ones and some additional super mutants, the interior robots were pretty standard, just also dropping nuclear material, High Rad fluids, and mass.
---
Nuked it today, was pretty shit, I'd stick to WS.
---
I dump it in the blue suitcase at Watoga Station.
---
Use the ammo perks they become weightless and enjoy that unlimited ammo mini gun.
---
That's the way people do bloodied/nerd rage builds. Rads till 19% life left.
---
Well now we know for sure boys! They planned to farm our wallets from the start!

---
I have seen quite a bit. Only today 1queen and 2 sheepsquatch. 
---
Ps4 players are nubs probably hah
---
Thumbs up for powering through a shitty situation, man.  The tough moments are where memories are made.  
---
I had a similar experience at "Line In The Sand" with a friend.  We barely managed to make it through what seemed like double or triple of everything, but we took a photo together standing next to a pile of at least 6 scorchbeasts and dozens of dead scorched minions, and I always love it when that photo pops up as a loading screen.  Memoriiieeees.

Considering there were over 300+ posts while I was on last night and you say about 12 scammers- that's hardly half of them \^ \^ Try to find the big traders who have actual set up shops with multiple vendors - you will have better luck.
---
No, they want to sell you micro's. They're not fully exposed and i'm 100% DONE with their bs. Spread the word or be a whale.   
---
Just let it go.
---
SHIIT
---
Gracias
---
I'm sure this does happen from time to time, but personally lost another PA leg the other day, and mine are formatted to always be at the bottom of my list, and have lost Legendaries, so I think the issue is larger.
---
Oh shit!? I have seen this suggested 50+ times.
---
🙄
---
Oh, for sure.  Bethesda is fairly inconsistent with stats, their effects, and hidden effects though so I didn't want to take for granted the code recognizing "life %" for Instigating is the same for those builds.
---
I need to find a secluded spot with good access to water for 7-10 industrial purifiers

EXPOSED!
---
Neither does the Brotherhood of Steel being around but here we are.
---
I don't know, but I launched my first nuke (solo) yesterday and was shocked at how little trouble it was for me to go through. Didn't die once and used maybe 6-8 stimpacks. I'm level 81.
---
Did it error out? That happened to me.
---
Sounds like bs tbh I’ve grinded all the free challenges atoms and I ran out last week with the silver excavator suit ( I’ve used all atoms for skins ) no more free down the road , tally that if you’re a yearly player it’s close to 60 dollars ... 
---
Don’t come tell me it’s ok to them to “bug” challenges
---
Absolutely, the Deep- pocketed mod i suppose? I have mats
---
Good. The more the merrier.
---
:D
---
Yeah, seems to be somthing to do with it trying to inspect nothing.
---
Btw, If you are interested, I have a crap load of syringer ammo for sale. Cheap.
---
Oh nice.  Stopped playing for a long time because of the sad state. I keep meaning to come back  but I keep finiding other ggames to finish.
---
Sometimes they spawn on a grave in the grave yard. If not, head through the cemetery straight out from the big tombstone into the woods and keep going straight in that direction. you'll come onto a site with a broken car and some garbage piles and barrels. There is always a shovel there. Also either bloodbugs or mirelurks. Hope this helps!
---
Indeed. It doesn't help that I'm allergic to painkillers. 😶
---
I like to be the Mad man with the Harpoon Shotgun.  
---
I have a 2-Shot, a Double, and a Explosive Harpoon guns and by far the Double is the best for me.
---
There are about 300 mods on Nexus atm for the game and none are really hacking *glowing mods are in the grey area*
---
Or a setting option to turn it off.
---
Don't Bethesda have beta testers (besides us the players of course)
---
It is i got a furious gamma and it just wrecks
---
More funny challenges!  I’m a rifle build though, could be tough for someone like me to do this... but I’d give it a shot
---
So there is a game client bug that prevented the Atomic Shop from updating and requires you to completely close the game and restart it in order for the Atomic Shop to update.  Bethesda knows about this, however the only communication I saw was here in Reddit from the community managers and other players who have been told the same thing.  I didn't know about this workaround until after the time frame to collect an egg had passed, so I missed one out of six eggs.  
---
I contacted Bethesda Support to see if I could get the missing egg or the mask, who indicated:
---
&gt;Customer Support is unable to grant missed Easter Eggs due to any reason.
---
So I'm out of luck for the bunny mask.  It's not the end of the world, but pretty telling that their Support Team won't give a free digital item that can't even be purchased separately to account for a **known bug** in their software.  I logged into the game every single day during the 6 day event, checked the Atomic Shop every single day but because their software can't account for how modern consoles suspend games instead of restarting them, I'm out of luck.
---
Again, it's just a stupid mask that I probably won't even wear outside this week and a pointless decorative item, but it's a bad trend to set.  Maybe this is my background in Customer Service and Support speaking, but if you screwed up and admit to it, you make it right somehow.
---
You can get level 1 legendary gear, up to 3* if you find a 3* level 1 legendary enemy. I've found and killed a 3* legendary level 1 Eyebot and a 3* level 1 Rabbit before. I've never seen a 3* level 1 piece of gear before, but I've gotten some 3* level 10 gear.
---
There is no way you have 120 3\* legendaries and not a single piece is more useful than your 1\* set up. Like, statistically that has to be impossible.
---
You've discovered "Deathclaw(s) Island"
---
no thank you goodbye
---
I dumped several hundred 40mm grenades at the train station at Top of the World,  missiles too. I have over 7000 shotgun shells I can bring myself ro dunno since I hope to get another TSE shotgun someday.
---
sick bastard this is a lot of good info :D
---
They changed how VATS targets turrets, so now you will never get a % to hit chance and even if your standing right next to them you cannot hit them in vats.  This dramatically increased the time it took me to clear a silo and so I don't do it as much anymore.  its also not as fun as it was before, flying through the air to take down a ceiling turret.
---
They most likely did this to prevent a glitch that let you skip a portion of the silo, so now both combined and it takes much longer to run a silo and its harder to do, so less people doing it.
---
I actually wish this would happen for me. I'm at the point with my character that I honestly think I can solo the event but I never see a queen fight with less than 8 or 10 people.
---
A 1star bloodied handmade. I couldnt beleive my eyes when I saw it lol. If I remember correctly it only cost 300 caps, give or take a few.
---
Youd think they would. Like I dont have a problen being a beta tester. Just give me some neat items.
---
Well at midnight it's like 32. During the day it actually negates damage and gives the other player caps. But to die from it? How embarrassing.
---
Well, legendary are all over the place.
---
Actually have way more crazy idea.
---
Remove all the legendary. Give all the gun new mod instead.
---
Too balance. Right?

Thanks, I've never seen it either but at least the chem drops a lot in the wild.
---
This gets posted like 5 times a day and it’s the only spam I don’t get irritated by. Needs to happen.
---
I hate giving away my ammo id rather get paid caps for it
---
Ok, that's interesting
---
I want quad ammo miniguns then laughs maniacally as I unload my never-ending belt into said enemy.
---
Had someone try to lure me into PVP last night by challenging my workshop. I had just placed my fast travel mat, too, so odds are it was mined or covered. Skipped servers and took it again.
---
I was at a SBQ event a few weeks ago, and a Scorched spawned with some kind of Gamma Gun with an impressive fire rate.
---
About 7 or 8 of us lv 175 - 225 types ... ALL wiped out in a few seconds ... respawned and wiped out again.  No one could get close to the scorched.  
---
Shoot at it ... and you died almost instantaneously.  The event was abandoned .... no point.
---
Moo 🤪
---
Hm after reading the comments i'm not sure anymore
---
I must have a hole in my stash, because that stuff just keeps falling out of my inventory.
---
It does not need to stay equipped.
---
The adds cannot hurt most players with a brain and can be ignored.  The corpses vanish in the dust, anyway.
---
Unless you're a melee or a vats crit build, at any level, you aren't being helpful.  It's not a level thing, nobody cares, idiots just like to have something to bitch about and a smaller number is a simple indicator to cry about.  Who gives a fuck what people like this think/do?  Don't worry about idiots, there are way more of them out there.
---
Wow, that's pretty damn close!
---
I made my character after my favorite as well, Glory :)
---
I have a quad cryolator. That thing just chugs along for what feels like an eternity
---
At the moment it seems like Nuclear Winter is a storyline unto itself, though it's not unlikely that it'll have harder survival mechanics.
---
Technical data is pretty common in lvl 2 and 3 safes and all military installations.  Locked boxes in military locations very commonly have tech data.  
---
If you're after BOS shielded lining, T-60 paints or whatever other stuff that drops while turning in "techncial data" (I will always call it that), those are the best places to go.
---
Don't forget that you can store tech data in your stash and pull it out one at a time if you make an alt that hasn't gotten Forbidden Knowledge yet.  You can pull out one at a time, drop it into a random container, pick it back up and get the quest to pop up.  Also, if you find more than one in a location, don't pick up the second one.  Fast travel to Defiance, turn the first one in, fast travel back to the second piece and repeat.  I got really lucky and found 3 separate pieces at the Ranger District Office in Cranberry Bog one day, fast traveled back and forth and finally got the [BOS shielded plan](https://imgur.com/8f75kXL) on the second go.  This was after dozens and dozens of outfits and random ammo drops.  RNG rewards persistence.
---
Pneumatic is pretty nice and you can get it from scrapping.
---
Thank you. See I was hearing a lot more wild things. I appreciate it
---
Nah the legendary vendor should have a random weekly spawn
---
Yes, Moonwalk and Speeches were just example words. I was trying to point out that I have had passwords that have none of the letters in a word that showed Likeness. Like the first word I'd click on (Have) would show a Likeness of 2, but when it's all said and done, the password ended up being a word with none of those letters in it (Drip), so where'd the Likeness come from?
---
Some are saying the Likeness means there are letters in a clicked word that are just in the actual password, but not necessarily in the correct spot, and others are saying the Likeness means that there are letters in the clicked word that are in the correct spot of the password. But which is it?
---
I used Waters, Wasted, Winter, and Winner as examples to just show how close the words are alike but not with letters in the corrext spot of each other. I mean, I suppose I could have used words like Cinder, Dashes, and Sinner, as examples, but wanted to show how similar the words can be so alike but with letters just slightly off.
---
I'm not trying to make a huge deal about this, I was just curious if anyone else has encountered this problem before. I replied somewhere else that it doesn't happen very often. Maybe 1 in 20 attempts, if that. It's just a fluke I encounter occasionally.
---
I don't have any problems figuring out the password as I eventually get it. I just find the whole thing confusing sometimes, and with some saying that Likenesses are letters that are or aren't in the correct spot in the actual password is making it all the more confusing.
---
I'm just easily confused, LoL.
---
huh
---
Lucky... Unfortunately those weapons like the flame is very weak.
---
Then we need another island for highbies. Deathclaws spawn based on number of players and player levels. Specifically so you get overwhelmed no matter what gear you have.
---
Level 230 like me gets swamped by 23 high level deathclaws.
---
The adds may not be much damage wise except for like the Deathclaws and such but they are a real pain when your tring to shoot any they keep staggering you lol
---
It drove me crazy that my homemade Starlight Berry pie didn’t count for the  cakes and pies achievement either. ;)
---
What about handies? Does it give those out at truck stop bathrooms?
---
PM on Reddit or Xbox. GT is knucklessyrup
---
The real answer is because this perk system is absolute garbage and was very poorly thought out and implemented.
---
That's atomic shop dlc, check for it in May.
---
Its more of a novelty item to me
---
I stopped picking it up, but sometimes I wind up with a good amount by accident. I'll go around Watoga dropping it and make it a treasure hunt. I drop ammo all around there and try to leave something good at the end. I usually see someone finding the bags before I leave. Makes me smile and why not collect it and give it away. It's a pain to make ammo..
---
why are you making a big announcement about this? if you're going to stop playing, then just stop playing.
---
Edited
---
We did her decent damage in two actualy. But i burned thru 4k 5mm ammo super fast, the other guy was melee and queen landed maybe 6times...
---
I belive it is soloable with some bloodied explosive sentinel god build, but very costly in chems and ammo.
---
I think I got all the heavy weapons
---
I'm capable of moving and shooting.  Folks that aren't probably aren't contributing much anyway.
---
TSE nerf and bullet sponges thats why
---
Forreal though why is every legendary that I get dropped junkie mutant or nocturnal????
---
This beauty right here

attention whore
---
Ya I'm gonna have to go shopping for flux and message my mechanic 🤦 hopefully throwing some caps at the situation will fix it quick because losing that leg cost me 150 carry weight and that's just brutal
---
Feel your pain pal, this is a rough bug
---
Heresy!
---
I tried using those conduits on a few builds, but they aren’t great. One alternative I use all the time is putting pylons or conduits on floor mats or signs. This allows you to run wires through walls, floors, the ground, roofs, or even other objects without needing those pipe conduits at all. 
---
To do this, just put down a floor mat or rug, then put a pylon on the mat. Now when you move the mat, the pylon stays attached. Put them next to your generator and connect a wire. Now select the floor mat and move it like an inch to the side so everything stays green and the wire stays connected. Once you’ve placed it one time with the wire connected, you can now move it literally anywhere in your camp without the wire breaking. And like I said, this also works for signs (like the no smoking sign) and wall conduits. Just have to connect a wire, then move it once, then anywhere after that.
---
There's plenty of places where no one goes and you can rack up mad amounts of xp. I killed 2 high levels yesterday just running into them but that was after farming the guarantee. Turrets I agree. I saw a level 18 with an actual camp once but he gets a buff, could only take off half health with one shot. I let him go, figured he was a pve guy. No one should have a nice camp in pvp xD, make an alt.
---
Oh and bandolier perk takes less room to carry it anyway.
---
Nuking White Powder is going on my consideration list.
---
A legendary rabbit? Happy Easter, motherfucker!
---
Different builds require different tactics.  My sniper is better when standing still and using vats and staggers knock me out of vats so the adds can be annoying.  It all depends on peoples builds tho.
---
Got a legendary harpoon gun too. Cant remember if its 2 shot or quad though
---
My thought are make 3\* star legendary a little rarer because I always find at least once every time i nuke white spring or the burrows plus every time someone disconnects and re logs it re spawns them so make them a little rarer and make it a guarantee.
---
TSE Pipe Rifle for 300 caps with the purchase at Watoga a while ago before the explosion patch went through
---
Is it explosive also?
---
Actually I like it. Gives me more options if I decide to change my build up. For example I have level 5 adrenaline but I’m currently working on the levels I need to move some special points again and just have a level 3 adrenaline.
---
You're burnt out. Play something else or go outside?
---
Why do we care?
---
We don't need more critters. We need more content.
---
I've had the game crashing entering lots of places. For me the worst is westtek. It's a near 50/50 chance to crash or get stuck in an infinite loading screen when I try to go inside.
---
Yeah, like 90% of the things on this subreddit, all you need a couple people to suggest their speculation and 2 days later there's non-stop "Oh I heard it WILL be like ________"
---
No, I wish it was.
---
Okay, dude. 😂
---
Clearly this conversation is going nowhere, because I already proved you wrong and you've devolved into just straight up denial.
---
Y'know, something I saw yesterday that baffled me was someone initiating Encryptid while half the server was already dealing with the SBQ.
---
Somehow, we were successful at both, but please.  Don't do this.
---
You would have to be level 100000 wouldn't you?
---
My ghoul slayers swing speed golf club would do wonders!
---
Oh wait a 2 shot quad explosive mini gun.  Ohhh the orgasmic explosions.
---
If you put a bladed bit on the drill and repair it to 200 percent, it will WRECK. same with the chainsaw
---
 Full BoS Heavy Combat Armor. About 325 325 3 in my case.
---
It would make to much sense if I got a screw from a pipe weapon with a scope on it, you know, the scope with two screws in it.
---
I have suggested that, when Survival was launched. But they already have this system in place, and it's not going to change.
---
Is that how money = caps Scales?
---
I need to find a Charging Shotgun mod for it, but I can attest that the Instigating Tesla Rifle is a really nice tool for clearing mobs.  Even Charred Feral Ghouls fall in a couple shots.
---
Or train station suitcases. I drop it on the ground at vendors
---
I carry 2. All rise and grog ax. You can repair all rise to 200% but not the ax is why I carry all rise as back up until they get it fixed where we can repair the ax right.
---
Nice build!
---
It's a numbers game.  Some lucky bastard might get a BOS shielded plan almost immediately, and other might have to be persistent and get it after months of repeats.  I finally got mine a couple weeks ago, and I started playing that very first open BETA Thursday afternoon.  Fast travel, kill four ghouls, maybe a couple radroaches, drop your data into the container and look at ammo box loot while your quest loot takes over your screen for a minute.  It's very, very little effort, so why not do it for the easy xp and lottery chance at something interesting?
---
Everyone else is also getting a small pile of ammo 90% of the time.  I think I've gotten the engineer uniform once and the science uniform maybe a handful of times since BETA.
---
Found an actual assassin's Cavaliers piece of armor. Score!
---
Recently found a level 10 instigating pole hook with swing speed and +1 strength. That one's for my next play through.
---
I'm playing around with a quad assualtron head that has +10% damage while aiming I found at a vendor. 20 cells is almost enough to take down a level 61 hermit crab in one shot. Incinerated a level 65 scorchbeast in 3 shots. Its not exactly practical but it's kinda fun.
---
Take it off. Only good while at a bench. As for armor drops, it doesn't affect their Durabily. But it will repair them to 200% Condition. Durability and Condition are different things. Luck determines Durability of items you find.
---
I had the same issue with never getting rare drops after a tun of turn ins and I found that turning two technical at a time was a night and day different with rare plans and apparel drops rates. I highly suggest turning in two at once. Although do to a weird graphical issue it will only ever show you having one technical data, so you'll have to keep track of it yourself.
---
cool. I have been wondering the same thing about the PA version.
---
It doesn't match my build so I just sold it for profit.
---
Lmao. Right on. Yeah I didn’t know that either. I spent so much time farming black titanium from that lone Deathclaw and was so upset when I found that I could use the extractor for it. Now I’m swimming in the stuff from repeated runs through Uranium fever
---
It wasn't on Easter. It was a few months back. I saw a glimpse of it pop up on my screen and simehow tagged it with a recon scope. I was not quite sure what I saw, but I saw legendary and multiple stars. And it ran. I had to chase it for minutes until I killed it. It dropped a 1*.
---
Pretty sure thatd have to be legacy. If possible at all. I think they occupy the same legendary chart, someone explained it to me once. 
---
2shot and quad cant go together
---
I'm pretty sure. When they first opened the survival servers, a lvl 200 gave up 400 caps when killed. Now it's 50 caps or 25% of their level.
---
Or I just wait at my base for 30secs and kill them as they attack my watermelons.  Seriously, why always the watermelons?   I wonder if watermelons to giant irradiated mutated scorpions is the same as cucumbers to cats?  They are pretty similar animals.
---
Max level Two-Shot Handmade. My buddy has an auto-rifle build going on and when I told him I bought it for him he lost his shit
---
Not to mention they don't drop anything to make them worth killing. Hell they can't even be legendary, so what's the point?
---
Deathclaw Island 2: Black Titanium Boogaloo
---
[https://imgur.com/TF5kEZw](https://imgur.com/TF5kEZw)
---
I can respect that.  Sometimes a cosmetic decision matters more than practicality.
---
My 3* Bolstering Cavalier Trapper armor is great against the SBQ, but man, it's a dorky looking thing.
---
Middle Mountain cabins has them, but you may need to server hop for them, it can also be bears like you saw.
---
Rad sponge shared and ghoulish to stay healed up, otherwise you can use rad-x if you aren't mutated or rad-x diluted if you are along with rad-sheild and glowing blood packs.  But honestly if you have a group Rad sponge shared will keep you rad free.
---
This is why I keep saying that mods will fix the game.
---
Until then, It's staying uninstalled.
---
Maybe something like the quarry from fnv
---
Good point on the durability vs condition! Didn’t even think about it like that, and especially since I didn’t craft the armor to begin with, this perk isn’t need then unless I’m crafting armor from scratch.
---
If someone has such a monster though I would buy it. OwO
---
Awesome thanks!
---
I kinda figured but I couldn't pass up the joke haha
---
*Sigh*  it is quite a shitshow of a game sometimes though. I keep enjoying the improvements, but like it always just reminds me that they should've waited like a year before releasing instead. Or kept it in "Beta" for like 6 months or something. Annoying as hell that game studios keep pulling this bullshit of releasing unfinished games and totally getting away with it.
---
Xbox? If so I'll buy for 300 caps
---
The SB Queen is endgame, the SB's are a big normal part of the whole Appalachia :)
---
I kinda like them, easy to handel when you get up in levels...
---
Anyone remember the reddit search bar option?
---
The Brotherhood can be and is explained, the Atom Shop can’t reasonably be explained.
---
With most people, I can tell them "halfway between this and this place" and they understand.   I cannot post a picture as a reply on reddit.  So not sure where you suggest I post a picture.  I'm erasing this post anyways.
---
I doubt we will get private servers. I didnt like fo4 but the mods made it cool. 76 is alright but agreed let me add a few things for QoL and its a great game to sink time into
---
Yup had this happen with power armor.
---
The hermit crab is just a super crab. Crabs are animals, not bugs. So it should be classed as an animal but definitely not a bug.
---
Also This is helpful, thanks.
---
Id consider paying real money for that tbh.
---
Because 76 isn’t that great
---
That's fine and all. Chalk it up to whatever you like, but this has happened to me. I was simply curious if anyone else has encountered an issue like this. I understand what people are saying, I just don't know who's right. Is the Likeness similar letters but not in the correct spot, or is the Likeness similar letters that are in the correct spot?
---
And in the case of Moonwalk and Speeches, there are no similarities, so how could Speeches be the password when Moonwalk showed a Likeness of 4 and has no letters matching the actual password?
---
This has even happened to me with smaller words like Dear and Join (again, just example words), where Dear would have a Likeness of 1 or more, but Join has none of those letters and turns out to be the password.
---
How would a situation like that be incompetence or user error?
---
There was someone who commented somewhere that he/she went through and clicked on all the closed brackets to leave just one word, but when he/she clicked on the word it was incorrect. Is that still incompetence or user error?
---
I used to always find 1 at “top of the world” when I was doing the main quest
---
Was Mari the wendigo ?
---
I've had that happen a bunch of times, mainly during the Poseidon event. I'll load into the reactor room, hear a death moan, and then all the scorched just drop to the floor.
---
Another weird bug I've been running into lately is ghouls that continue shuffling along after death. The only place I've seen it so far is in the Burrows. I'll kill them and can loot the body, but they'll stay upright and continue limping forward until they clip through a wall and disappear.
---
Middle mountain cabins also have a chance for there to be honey beasts.
---
Like, the no radio soundtrack is pretty ass
---
I keep have power smith as well,  but I actually crafted my X-01 gear whereas the armor I wear were drops. 
---
So I guess that means once I crafted my X-01 I don’t have to have Power Smith equipped anymore then either!
---
All this is great and all but the game is still unplayable for me, I can't aim down my sights at all.
---
There was always one right at the Top of the World elevator for me.  Was the bane of my low level existence trying to do Rose's questline.
---
Another important question when is the best level to retire said character but keep items for transfer (becomes the mule and other newer character takes its place).
---
"Free Puppies That Will Be Your Companion We Swear Island" wouldn't fit on the map.
---
Legendary vendor will be located over near Berkley Springs. There's a train station over there that if you go to it, all the windows are closed up, but you can take a peak through some holes in the windows, and it looks exactly like the background for the vendor did in the trailer. Go check it out, it's a pretty neat find!
---
I would pay to see that movie.
---
Lemme guess, your TSE not killing them like before? Besides removing the exploit that allowed you to skip half the silo they haven't made any changes to the silos that I know of. They did however nerf the bejesus out of two shot explosive weapons.
---
It'll happen eventually, even if it happens like "Skyrim Together"
---
cranberry bog is an amazing area..
---
terrible idea to place a camp there
---
😏
---
Any advice on what a tier one weapon may be? I thought TSE was basically the best you could get.
---
lol but do you have sick weapons tho
---
I'm having this issue as well, what was the fix that you got to work?
---
Question - do you mean actually *share* it?  Is that what I'm missing?  That added step that requires you to have Charisma 6?
---
Yeah that sounds like it could be it, I was spamming scraping stuff in the Vid
---
serenity island
---
 Scorchbeasts are wonderful. No need to change a thing as they are one of the best things in the game.
---
 I hunt them myself and have a strong bond with my prey. They know me now and often run but I like 3 as sometimes I can make a good screener. Dropping them all so you get a good photo can be challenging. I have a lot of 2 shots, but getting 3 in the picture still eludes me. ;)
---
I think we need more random Deathclaws all over the map, not just on the island.  Scorchbeast are fine but they are kind of ammo sponges that, once you figure out the tricks, don't really dish-out a lot of damage.  Also, they only appear in this game so apparently are regionally limited. Deathclaws however appear in all Fallout games which cover a wide variety of regions. They can be very challenging since they do lots of melee types of damage and are typically tough at higher levels.  We have the "Hoard" events, why not a Deathclaw hoard event? I don't have first hand knowledge since I never played the game but I heard the Deathclaws in Fallout-NV were tough as hell and not something to trifle with. Maybe that's the model they should use?
---
No!  I know you combat folks aren't big fans, but wood armor is the best stealth armor in the game.
---
Too far behinf in PvP? Meh. I started a new toon exclusively for survival mode. He's only level 28 and regularly ganking player 50 to 80 levels higher than him. With a pipe revolver.
---
There are a lot more viable metas in PvP than current player consensus seems to think.
---
I have had this happen to me quite often and I’m on xb1 as well. Seems to mostly be just the silos for me.
---
I think it would be a funny challenge to do!
---
New Year's White Tuxedo with tails, Sea Captains Hat, and Patrolman sunglasses. Have a beard and instantly become the world's most interesting man.
---
I demand an explanation as to how a skin tight rubber suit makes sneaking around in the woods easier.
---
Any combination of effects that werent recently nerfed by 115%. Anti-armor, furious, bloodied, executioners are all better primary effects and anything having to do with fire rate, swing speed or VATs crit will net you more damage if you build around it.
---
It ate my Excavator. Fortunately before I had gotten around to hunting down the mods for it but still.
---
Unless there's been an update, it isn't in the game yet.
---
I'm pretty sure it actually does repair what it can. If you try to hit repair all again you'll notice less materials needed (mainly for the damaged stuff). The game does not do a good job of conveying that it does that though (took me a while to figure it out).
---
I PvP every single day, and I’ve yet to see a single person use energy weaponry. 
---
I’m not saying that you’re wrong or that those numbers are incorrect; I don’t have enough knowledge to comment on that. 
---
All I can say is that, last I checked, energy damage isn’t effected by armor penetration perks. And an Ultracite laser pistol at level 50 doesn’t even 1 shot a level 3 feral ghoul.
---
If you keep your application running without closing the game on any platform the store won't refresh until you do
---
I keep my All Rise, but do have a 2* &amp; 3* Grognaks Axe as well. I carry the All Rise and 1 of the Axe’s &amp; my 3* Berserkers HM at all times.
---
It was supposed to be released alongside the burrows. There's challenges for it right now in dailies and weekly
---
You never proved a damn thing besides how bad you are at math and understanding basic principles of the game.
---
I'm level 198 and do lots of SBQ battles, so I will give you my perspective.
---
1. Ballistic weapons are still much better for Damage and Durability
---
2. Prime receiver does make a significant difference, and it can be reversed, just go back to the bench &amp; apply a different receiver.
---
   1. Ammo is expensive to make, so plan on farming Flux after every battle
---
3. Anti-Armor is good, but also Two Shot, Furious, and Zealot's work well.
---
I have 3 weapons I use for Queen battles, and always bring 2 of them in case one breaks;
---
1. Primed TSE 50 Cal, with + 10 Damage while aiming, my favorite, does massive Damage per Second, regular SBs drop in a couple seconds.
---
2. Primed Zealot's Explosive LMG, with + 33% Vats hit chance, great for dealing with the mobs, or anything else, but eats ammo super fast.
---
3. Furious Explosive Gatling, very reliable, high durability, don't use it that much anymore, but keep it because the ammo is so cheap.
---
My Character is a Stealth Rifleman, but a few card changes turns him into a solid Heavy Weapons guy for the SBQ battles.
---
Same with me at Westek too.
---
It was on xbox and I did all that.
---
Congrats you got way more than 60$ worth out of the game . 700 hours means that you paid a little over 8 cents/hr of entertainment . That’s a great deal
---
It was delayed. Possibly coming out tomorrow.
---
Had this happen to me, by finding one loose on the ground, it would not stop spamming my screen with a new one every 3 minutes, till I closed down the game and restarted!
---
It's a legendary poor creature.
---
Im pretty sure share means the same thing as share.... you need 3 charisma for a level 1 perk. Once you share it, it applies to your whole team. So i share rad sponge and when i take rads, yours go away. When you take rads, mine go away.
---
Ammo like mininukes, missiles and 40mm are the only types I’d drop.
---
I've only met two griefers and both at least came for me (maybe they would have gone for my camp but I tend to just move servers than deal with griefers, not worth the frustration and all they want is for me to be frustrated so even if I could get back at them there really isn't much you can do to "get back" at a griefer other than ignore them).   
---
But, because I hear about that I only put out my decontamination shower when I'm there. But I can't wait til May 7 so I don't ahve to keep taking it out and putting it back again.
---
I did. Good point.
---
Or that one spot across the river on the East side of the map... there were a ton of deathclaws there.  I remember being legit terrified of going there,  but the enclave power armor was worth the risk
---
Delayed? Welp. At least I know I'm not crazy not finding anything
---
I think you're correct with the Devs being furries. If the bunny head is the "reward" then meh.
---
I don't mind them - just wished they had a little bit better loot pool. I get more loot from Wendigos/Ghouls/Mutants.
---
Maybe they didn't have any stimpacks and it was the fastest way to get you back into the fight lol?
---
Lol I dont care that they didn't revive me but the sledgehammer was a bit much
---
Try brotherhood and free states venders.
---
&gt;Shared perks cards work at any distance on the map as long as you are in the team with the person sharing 
---
It's not quite universal. I know for sure that Rad Sponge doesn't work if you're more than a couple hundred meters from your teammates.
---
They just decided not to take down the dailies for it funny enough. Miss out on some atoms but luckily nothing that gives item rewards, assuming they continue that.
---
After level 50 there really isn't much to spend except to get the different level cards. Not unless you want to spend time constantly reworking your SPECIAL stats (not really feasable to have one character do different builds the way it is done anyways, only good if you changed your mind on what build you wanted).
---
Hahahahaha yep it’s appalling how underwhelming it is.
---
Yeah that would make sense for there to be a reward after fighting through the deathclaws
---
Well it is a marine tactical uniform so i thought that you would be less visible with all the fancy tech they got, and who knows maybe theyre just that comfy (i wouldnt know). 
---
On second thought maybe youre right theyre not that great for sneaking but atleast it would look cool
---
that is a good bowl of cereal. part of a balanced breakfast
---
Somebody's offered them 1k in the other post that they've made about this gun.
---
Closing and reloading FO76 should work. That totally sucks :(
---
This is kind of unrelated but just in general I find deathclaws way less intimidating in 76 and 4 than they were in 3 and NV. They telegraph their moves too much now with the dirt scoop and zig zag thing they do when running at you. I always have enough time to dump enough rounds into them before they get to me. They were way more scary when they ran directly at you and lunge attacked.

I know, it's ridiculous. I have tripled duplicates of every dam card except the ones I truly want which never shows up in perccards pack always the same 5 cards. I thought this was supposed to be fixed in the beginning? I am level 270 so do  the math, it is absolutely annoying! You wounder why you can't have different builds per character. Personally I think it is the way they want it to be.
---
&gt;I PvP every single day, and I’ve yet to see a single person use energy weaponry.
---
this if false because:
---
&gt;I’m not saying that you’re wrong or that those numbers are incorrect; I don’t have enough knowledge to comment on that.
---
because if you did you would know that the most effect build right now is the legacy explosive lazer rifles that can reach 200 damage wile being automatic and having the burn effect of the mods that go trough sentinel assassin . 
---
and if you actually played this game at a high level without being a casual (most of this sub is casual) you would be knowing that with the beem spliter you do literal 1k damage with just an explosive lazer rifle at long range lmao.
---
Every single effect is multiplicative. Equipping and unequipping Sluggger proved this last night.
---
You're arguing something that we can see with our own eyes. It's like saying that water is red.
---
For only 3000 caps they'll add .0005% more deathclaws
---
Awesome, good to hear :)
---
Oh you gotta play the others. 3 and new Vegas look dated but dont let that stop u from playing them
---
He spent 700 hours of his life playing it so it can’t be too bad . Also you are hanging around the sub of a game which you don’t think is “that great” so what does that say about your life?
---
So basically you only want Bethesda to release cosmetic content that YOU want. Another one that thinks the world should cater to you. Please 🙄
---
Based on your post history, I can only assume you were banned, and now you're throwing a bitch fit. You spent money, you decided to break rules, get the hell over it. You had it coming
---
Yeah almost every time I stop by, theres a lvl 91 there
---
This is a good option for Bethesda as well, maybe in adventure mode, take losing junk out of the equation. Its fucking stupid and when youre a level 118 all the enemies you fucking fight are literally gods with god aim and never miss shots at all. So maybe stop punishing your players with stupid ass shit, and save that griefing ass bullshit where an AI kills you and you lose your shit cause they literally are all sitting on it every fucking god damn time you die. Fix your trash ass game. I reinstalled for the burrows update. DISAPPOINTED. I will be uninstalling again and i hope the people who boycotted this pathetic excsue for a AAA game before, will soon do it again. This product needs pulled, and the company forced to release a completely polished version. No excuses. No bullshit. This game is pathetic since the update. Ive done nothing but die from EVERYTHING. Before i would tank groups of level 68 super mutants, legendaries, hella strong ghouls, i mean honestly, idc what you fucking did, its NOT working. I log on to play a couple hours, die 3 times as soon as i log on. Yup, turned it off, and uninstalled. Your game sucks just like your personal lives. With all that money i hope you all get depression and cut your throats bethesda. Bunch of fucking scam artists. Fuck yourselves. Id rather fucking play shit hole COD whivh ive had uninstalled for months. XD. Thats fucking sad. I hate cod and would rather play it than your game. It has 0 hit reg. Let me hit for over 1k dmg on a melee build, lmfao, and not reg the first 4 hits xD. God id love to see a post on twitter about todd howard getting ass cancer. I would literally screenshot it, frame it, and hang that shit on my wall. It would be the best day of my life.
---
Ugh... I think I might skip this challenge. Last time I met radscorps was in that area and they completely kept kicking my ass. I hate rad scorpions with a passion. They're just not fun with the way Bethesda does the burrowing mechanic. Especially if you are built up as a sneak build but can't one hit them. Hit them, they go caution and instantly find you. For my character that's like death (she's a glass cannon, she can do damage while stealthed but she goes down quick if she gets hit).
---
Preach it.
---
Bethesda - what? You mean you don't appreciate that level 40 1* legendary Rolling pin?
---
Even Trade thought a player or vendor would be satisfying.
---
Not if they haven't coded luck as a factor in those drops. I think you were just RNG lucky, not perk lucky. There are a number of people who have tracked drops with luck perks enabled and said there has been no change to the drops.
---
If your name wasn’t what it was, you’d probably actually troll more people. 10/10 for effort tho
---
You can't stop levelling up.
---
On PC mine removes all the grass for about 300 yards in every direction
---
Good troll, nope never been a thing played since early builds before beta even sooooo, idk what game you were playing lol
---
That's why it's a useful mutation for pretty much anyone, not just Bloodied/low HP builds.  You're still seeing a ~+15% damage benefit even at high HP.  You'd spend SPECIAL points on Bloody Mess for a benefit like this, so why not a mutation?
---
Here are the results of my last 3 scorchbeast queen fights:
---
Vampire's pole hook
---
Syringer
---
Nothing (albeit somewhat my fault, I was using a tesla gun to kill the adds and apparently that dealt the killing blow on the queen. She disintegrated and her ash pile either disappeared or I could not find it)
---
On the bright side, when you load back in you can kill the 7 mutants on the outside again.
---
I've given up on doing Surface To Air events because the enemies often spawn inside the AA turret or in a position where its too hard to kill them off before they kill the turret.
---
The cost to repair the turret even once its kinda high, but I'm often having to repair it 6+ times.
---
I definitely plan on playing them all!  I’ve watched my son play 4, which got me interested enough to buy this one 😁
---
Ranger. Veteran. Armour.
---
Multiplayer pipboy games would be a nice addition as well.
---
*Shia labeouf*
---
Killed the queen last night, looted her and ran to revive a low level froze. Started up again into a server with 3 nukes touching down. All 3 hit and crashed again. Took a break after that
---
Might be the helm one
---
because i can?  because i felt like it?  because my friends should know?  do i need to explain more?
---
YES!!! So glad it wasn’t just me. I’m using a First Gen Xbox One and occasionally I think it’s starting to die. 
---
Every time I entered the elevator, the game would crash to Xbox Home Screen. I thought it was because ghouls were chasing me or because of some other glitch but it started happening over and over again. I switched from Charlie to Alpha and it still happened. 
---
I waited about an hour and restarted my Xbox and it worked fine.
---
I find it consistently lags in the part where you replace the Mainframe Cores.  Removing them, picking them up, and replacing them can lag by a minute.  It's ridiculous.
---
who is the real attention whore here?  ::points finger at you and laughs::
---
I mean, i'm sure that's great for a very specific build, but then you include the random teleport at the end and it's a overly long novelty lightshow with no real value.
---
It's Easter what you expect? It's either eggs or bunnies. Think it's better than collecting 6 ornate bunnies and then getting an egg mask. 
---
Well egg mask sounds awesome tho. What wouldn't I do to get one of those....  but you get the point.
---
That'd be cool, but I want the exact opposite too. 
---
[This mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/745) is essential for every Fallout 4 playthrough for me. 
---
Even with the clipping, there's just something super immersive about it. Check out [the user images here](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/745?tab=images). There are so many cool outfits that you can come up with! I very rarely wear costumes in 76, cause I really like the look of armor. I'd love it if I could see my armor AND a costume.
---
It'd be a lot of work for them to make the costumes work with minimal clipping, but I think it would be worth it. The option to have a costume act as under armor would really add to character customization, and it would make costumes on the Atomic Shop worth considering for even more kinds of players.
---
do not care if you care.
---
To be fair, it's free if you don't count time expenditure.  I just feel like they're going HAM with goofball outfits and hats because they clearly enjoy making them.  Like, they enjoy it A LOT and it seems to be a priority to the team in charge of cosmetic/atom shop content.
---
i think so too.  it was a fun ride, but time for some thing completely different.
---
Coulda sworn it existed, dont need to dunk on me so hard
---
Strongly disagree, I think. 
---
If I’m understanding you correctly, you think the new Legendary Vendor should be roaming?
---
I think he should be in a dedicated spot, as they have planned it appears.
---
not really!  lol.  i think my best was a 2 shot pump action?
---
It's for combat armor helmet. limbs and chest is what you want
---
Yeah I agree server verification would be ideal. But that assumes legendarys not being scrappable was a deep design choice I.e. as a dev do you want to have to update the servers(with downtime) or the client to allow legendary scrapping?
---
I’m assuming the check is basic I.e. is this object in your inventory? And now it’s gone.
---
I mean you could have let your friends know without making a public post announcing your departure. Reddit doesn't care that much, dude. Plus everyone is sick of the posts of people announcing their leaving 76, and I don't blame them. I'm super sick of the posts, too, cause they are all pointless and annoying
---
i did that too.   mine is level 22.  had a completely different experience.
---
And people would have to pay a cap to play a game
---
Her health does not scale to the number of players. A dataminer looked through the files last week and posted her stats. She has 32k HP, but she has a built in 70% damage reduction perk that kicks in before you even get to her armor, so in reality she has 106k HP.
---
Same thing.  Crash to Home screen.
---
My camp is by there and there is never a legendary there for me. 
---
Tho leader of the pack event runs quite often in that area so maybe it wandered over?
---
You can get 3 1* legendaries from that event, levels 5 or 10.
---
It won’t show, cause it’s not in the game
---
True.  True.
---
They really need a sticky post that deals with all these questions that come up daily.
---
Yeah, anything at all to make it more worth it for people to spend real money. I remember paying for a ton of $2 camos in black ops 2 because they looked cool and were worth it for me. You could apply those camos to every single gun too, not a single set of power armor. Whether they lower the amount of atoms earned in game and then lower the prices of atom shop stuff, or they raise the amount of atoms you get for money, doesn't really matter to me. As long as you aren't spending anywhere from $8-$15 for a single skin
---
Maybe, maybe not. Just saying this worked for me, people can try it or not, idc.  Will be more than happy to admit I'm wrong if proven so. Tricky thing, luck and possibility.
---
well, since i am retired military and have all the time in the world on my hands, 700hrs was not that much.  still found the time for RL.  now i got more time for RL.  again, the fresh air comes to mind.
---
I dump all ammo I dont use and known plans in the overseers cache I  flatwoods church.
---
Yeah true, I appreciate the free bit but I do agree with you on the whole goofyness of the outfits. If some were a bit less daft then all good.
---
I get it.  It's supposed to be friendly/creepy and fitting of the Christian holiday.  I just feel like there's WAY too much of the silly/creepy and I can count the actual hard-ass wasteland-y outfits on one hand.  Drifter outfit and Brotherhood Scribe gear are the only three pieces that come to mind immediately.
---
On mine I noticed that it cleared a large bit, but not quite that big!
---
Never said you could stop? I'm saying that at a certain point is it bad considering how cap loss increases with level
---
You can also jump (carefully and with practice) on top of the pylon. I've seen a couple folks take the pylon and then sit up there taking pot shots when they could.
---
I've also taken a pylon and then crouched behind it to stay out of damage area. I only ventured away to hit a colonel gutsy or protectron that came near me and saw me and started firing. Keeping the pylon between you and the sheepsquatch has proven valuable too.
---
are you sure they're watermelons and not hatching radscorpion eggs?
---
I mean, shit, I'd run in the other direction if I was in survival and saw all of you xD
---
so are yours   ahhhh ha ha ha ha!!!
---
Do not care, if you do not care, that I do not care.
---
See how childish this is?
---
Ah, I get it, you're a stupid troll. Gotcha
---
yea you only get BOS mod from plans
---
Is being a furry bad?
---
as childish as you like it to be.
---
To the best of my knowledge charisma/luck have no effect on Legendaries except the durability of the weapon.
---
I have several thousand pounds of 2-3 star legendary items on my mules.  NONE of the legendaries I have looted are in use by my toon.  I have had to buy/trade into every single piece I own.  Not only are 2-3 star legendaries hard to come by, then are almost always trash when they drop.
---
My level 30 character picked up a level 10 bolstering metal chest piece very early on, so I spent a couple days swimming in rads to gain talons and a bunch of other fun mutations. By the time I was level 15 I'd found some  other legendary things to grow into that gave me direction for the build (unarmed/commando) and now I've got a couple Fixers and legendary 10mm SMGs, both in level 20 and 30. At squishy low levels, pretty much any legendary effect is a nice boost, but don't sleep on the idea of making yourself legendary with mutations!
---
Also just this week a started a new player as a dedicated slugger build specifically because I had come across a 1\* lvl 1 bat and a 3\* level 5 pickaxe on my main and wanted to use the thing. He'll definitely be getting the hand-me-down bolstering chest.
---
Like others said, set up shop in the NW of the map and jump in all the events you can.
---
lol@u
---
I’m not saying they look bad, just that they’re old school. I’d drive one.
---
Does that mean I can take off Power Smith as well?
---
That's a five star idea!
---
I've been doing about 3-4 per day for the last 4 weeks, and I still haven't gotten a single paint yet. I feel cursed to never get one.
---
I'm leaving too, are you tired of me now? :v
---
TSE or no
---
Ouch, yeah... that's pretty bad. =/
---
If you’re talking about the waste disposal site,  I encounter 3 more often than not.
---
I thought I heard we were
---
Honestly, I really liked the eggs.  My parents immigrated from Poland where Pysanky (elaborate egg decorating with wax and dye) is an Easter tradition.  I sent my mom a screen shot of my in-game egg collection yesterday and she asked me how I made them.  It took me a minute to explain that they were virtual eggs in a video game.
---
Did you sell your camp for beer money?
---
The spawning in the turret is so absolutely annoying and wrong
---
no explosive.  never found one.  :-(
---
I mean if you don't make an unnecessary post about it, then I wish you luck and hope you at least had a decent time playing
---
Yeah, Arktos, that's where I got my 3\* level 5 pickaxe from a molerat.
---
depends on your definition of wreck... none of the perk cards work with the chainsaw, I cant imagine the drill being any different.  Any old bloody swing speed weapon will out pace either in DPS.
---
I'm level 130 and have 7 to 8 unused perks, I can move points if needed. I agree with OP totally on this, it's one of those things I just work with. Sometimes the level 2 perk card works better than 3 lol or 5. I've wondered if some perks go active after you log off and back on, sometimes reloading your character the Perk is being recognized? 
---
I can spend 10-15 minutes playing around with the cards too. It's super frustrating not being able to use cards due to the point limits of each column. I wish each section had an additional 2 points and the option to move points, build around (PS4)
---
I have the PA perk card build and the non PA melee build. I try to keep it simple so I spend less time fidgeting with the cards.
---
Dear God........
---
Not at all.  I respect all forms of humans.
---
&gt;Good point on the durability vs condition! Didn’t even think about it like that, and especially since I didn’t craft the armor to begin with, this perk isn’t need then unless I’m crafting armor from scratch.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about those. But I think laser weapons are classed by rifle, pistol, heavy. So they still get bonuses like other weapons. If energy cards were added they could be under intelligence, and they would have to be removed from current classes to prevent double dipping.
---
I was about to ask the same question. I am hoping Friends List gets fixed and BOS CA plans in vendor.
---
Why didn’t I realise this. Thanks man.
---
i love the trolls who came here and slammed me!!  it is actually making my day!!  was feeling a bit down, and now i am all giddy with excitement.  BRING IT ON!!!
---
Preach. It takes a certain amount of stupid to continue paying dog shit on a sub for a game you never play anymore or uninstalled.
---
On one hand, if something costs 18,000 caps, but has a slim chance of being acquired for free, then won't you feel silly when you find it the latter way after buying it?  On the other, the SBQ's loot is decidedly not "legendary" all these months later.
---
It's been announced and discussed on this forum, so yes, we probably are.
---
"Know" is a strong word though.  No one knows the future.  The country could be nuked in the next ten minutes.  Then I'd look like an asshole, buried under a mountain of rubble and radiated to death, having told people that I know there's an update tomorrow.  I don't want to be that guy who told you something was going to happen and then it didn't.  
---
So it's scheduled, but no one knows whether or not it'll happen.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.
---
Yep, they get bonuses from being automatic, rifle, etc. but the base damage of energy weapons is so bad because almost everything in the game has some sort of energy resistance. Rifles can get the Tank buster card for armor pen. Energy has nothing like that.
---
It is back, but different this time. Going Wendigo II: Electric Boogaloo
---
Yup, exactly. Also, happy cake day!
---
With my team - we all trade it among ourselves to make sure everyone has the ammo they need. You could always just sell it directly to other players or find lowbies around vault 76 and donate it!
---
What does this add to this sub? You're part of the problem. Congratulations.
---
Really? I’ll take it out of my post then, I really thought it was double of the modified value. Thanks.
---
nah.  stay a while!!
---
Sure. I’m always in need of steel now, never lead haha.
---
So I don't have an Xbox, but that wouldn't stop you from building an arcade and throwing events yourself.
---
We could even coordinate and keep the scoreboard updated per game by platform if it happens.
---
i sure did!!  love fallout!
---
You probably moved it when jacked on Nukashine.  Check random areas of the map and look for it
---
I guess it has been posted here before, but I think it's still important to bring up, especially considering that post had been removed for whatever reason.
---
A buddy were just talking about this- we both want to start farming the different flux’s from nuke zones and are trying to figure out the best location around the map to get the rarer varieties.
---
Nah I'm not. I'd be part of the problem if I was announcing my departure from 76, which is stupid and pointless, seeing as literally nobody cares. People announcing their departure doesn't add anything to this sub. I'm very much hoping that a mod sees this and they at least consider banning those types of posts, cause the majority of us are sick of it
---
Just me camping them from 300m with my pipe. You may proceed
---
Bethesda does not want you to socialize, they want you to kill each other, trash each others camps, and get stupidly drunk and hooked on drugs! I would love for your Idea to become a reality, but after playing this game as much as I  have, this seems to be the horrible reality. You are only rewarded for the behavior above!
---
Well, it is Duck Season. not Wabbit Season.
---
&gt;! https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qPtSxZchA34/hqdefault.jpg !&lt;
---
Righto. Will try that :) what lvl are they? I'm lvl 27 myself.
---
Well, we sure as hell aren't fueling them with all of that oil and electricity in your camp...
---
So i play on PS4 and enemy deaths aren't like how they were in F4 or even F3 where they had some weight and gravity to them. F76 enemy deaths (at least on PS4) fall to the ground almost feather light or like gravity almost doesn't affect them. Not sure if it happens on PC, &amp; Xbox.
---
I would love the Gauss pistol
---
Raiders hop up on chems rape kill steal though that's bad. I'll choose minute men Preston Garvey was so dedicated his only conversation was only about the minute men. Plus the general has light weight grade A armor.
---
&gt; Who gives a fuck what people like this think/do?
---
Y'know it's starting to sound like you're talking about yourself.
---
Rolling pin?
---
If not i'm probably gonna stop playing until it's fixed
---
The perk system sucks. It's so poorly thought out. Everything about leveling up in 76 is a mess. Respeccing is a complete joke too.
---
Haha how about no drills
---
Np, i thought it same way, before someone corrected me. Overall fallout mathematical fuctions are hard to understand, because they are not much logical :D
---
Yeh very true.
---
Huh, not sure if I've ever seen scorpions there. I pass through pretty often and it's pretty much always three or four bloodbugs for me.
---
I think it's okay that 3* Legendaries drop 2*/1* and a small chance of 3*. But the SBQ should he dropping at least two 3*, rare plans, mutation recipes, and you get a legendary reward like we do. But no way that boss should have the same shame loot table as a 3* ghoul. 
---
3* legendaries should be end game materials. Finding them should be a big deal. But we farm a nuked whitespring and get better loot than the final boss. Give me a break.
---
I feel like part of the appeal is being able to compare your setup against others and test the efficacy of different builds.  When you see her HP deplete, and you realize that *you're* the one doing it, it's very rewarding.  Most PvE enemies don't offer a true cooperative challenge.
---
I agree I wish there was some type of quick communication for those going to do it. I want to launch much more but it would be more fun with a few along with me...
---
Time to solo nuke some random spot again. People get so touchy when its not a place THEY want nuked.  
---
Hey- you want whitesprings nuked again, you go nuke it. This is my nuke. Maybe I wanted to see the waterslides in glowing orange light today.
---
I think Gunsmith, Makeshift Warrior, and White Knight are the only cards you might want to consider keeping on during combat. Remember, Durability is a permanent stat. Condition is what changes with usage and repair.
---
Yeh the mesmatron was awesome. That would be a Super PvP weapon
---
I don't like scorch beasts. I don't have really good ranged weapons and they refuse sometimes to land.
---
Not sure why you are being a dick to the person who defended you. You responses in this thread don’t come with the maturity which someone presumably in their 40s and proudly representing the military should have. I’m not sure how my squadron would reacted to our higher ups saying  “No U!”
---
I dont ever remember being able to sell ammo even in the beta
---
Most of the people have already exited the game, because there is no end game content. SBQ doesn't offer anything for them. Only "Bethesda please..." -players are leveling their low level characters in game and waiting for new cosmetic costumes.
---
Zenimax is worth over a billion. Think the punk rock mentality of yore died long ago.
---
Asides, an Easter bunny mask for collecting Easter eggs. Yes, that sounds like roughly what should be expected from a little free Easter event.
---
No I got plenty of money for beer.  It was more like “dude where’s my base?”  Except I don’t have a cool buddy like Stiffler.  And yes I’m Ashton Kutcher in this scenario.
---
Your friend was banned because the people rose up and siezed the means of production.

I have 2 accounts and 6 characters and use the Serums as an easy and fast way to empty the vendors on a daily basis (saving up to all the serum recipes) Talons need acid-bones-ultracite and fluorescent flux and is one of the easiest to mass produce since that flux is abundant in every Whitespring nuke. Bones is everywhere and acid can be stockpiled through the Hemlock Holes workshop.
---
Serum Recipes cost 17500 a pop with Hard Bargainx3, 15 Charisma and Grape Mentats, so its quite a lot of caps
---
Well, i already get drunk, do drugs and trash my own place.... so doing it online, instead, seems like a healthy improvement for me....
---
I agree some features of this game are self defeating; however, overall it seems to be a good game....because here we all are playing it and posting on reddit about it....
---
It's not like I'm trying to do anything exotic, just run run pipes along interior walls. Some Conduit pieces snap together as easy as anything, but rarely the pieces I want. I just came back from a bit of adventuring and managed to get another piece to snap into the place I need it, but nothing else. It's almost as if the game puts in a length, then forgets what it's done and refuses to acknowledge it. I've had similar issues with build pieces not snapping properly at first, but nothing so persistent. Looks like I'm going to have to do this in slow increments.
---
He dosent sell that great of stuff. I dont miss him or anything.

It will never happen OP. We just have to live with it.

I'm on Xbox sorry
---
wow!!!  you are a piece of work!!  nice try though, putting words in my mouth.
---
how about you go hump some one elses leg........dogface.
---
When are people going to stop whining about people complaining?
---
Is it just me or does every single banned users sound somewhat mental?
---
Unfortunately, you may be right. Feelsbadman
---
Any particularly fun spots you've found?
---
Wait there is a helmet skin?
---
Semi Auto = rifleman
---
Auto = commando
---
I have the map that shows main &amp; secondary locations...the map you show is only the main ones. It would be nice if there was an achievement for discovering every single location. I’ve been thinking about doing the same...starting with the main, then the secondary. It could be fun 😁
---
when again is the legendary vendor coming ? In the middle of next month right ? Because hopefully we can just make our own 3 star legendaries then and be done with this bullshit.
---
Mods havent been attaching since last patch its all over reddit how you not see that
---
I took it down with some randoms yesterday who slapped down a turret camp right outside the event area. It was really helpful especially since the turrets would 1-shot the eyebombs and keep the other robots distracted that spawned on that side. I focused on being the conduit guy and died a few times, but definitely less than usual. After we took the squatch down we all went to the top of the tower camp and traded and emoted goofily and the camp owner pulled it randomly, killing two or three of us as we plummeted to the ground. This was also the first time no one took my fucking bag and everyone was cool and goofy
---
Damn
---
I mean I wouldn't have posted this if I didn't see at least two posts from people announcing their departure every time I get on this reddit, which is pretty much every day when I have free time so 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
So when I put that receiver on the gun it will switch over from rifleman to commando
---
I've gotten mutations like that 2 times in my 300ish hours, both before the latest patch.  It's just very unusual, more so to get it more than a couple times.
---
Dropping this here, as it is related: how about level 3 safes contain at least one item worth breaking three bobby pins? I've had several with nothing but bad junk. Like, stacks of prewar cash bad.
---
You might be taken seriously if you made a post that was serious sounding. Your post is mainly incoherent and lacks the most important thing-  proof.
---
I launched 4 yesterday. I would have launched a couple more, but I ran low on circuits for repairing the mainframe cards.
---
Sounds like you need to trade with another player. Someone out there has your ideal pistol and will want to trade it for one of your fine rifles. Good luck and trade safe.
---
all you negative nancys are REALLY making my day!!  i love it!!!  i am laughing so hard right now!!  :-D
---
What?
---
Be aware that just because it looks luke it snaps together, sometimes its actually not. And power wont pass to the end of the line.
---
fine fine \^-\^ no more drills
---
how about a slingshot o\_o
---
Might not be, since the latest inside the vault says, "...and taking a look at a pair of upcoming C.A.M.P. changes in Patch 9 this May."

I tend to agree, I never understood the whole "Hey Im going to leave thing&gt;" If you are unhappy and leaving then leave. I dont think anyone is counting in a sea of over 182,000 a few fish. Not trying to be mean, but I think it is just the way it is. People will come and go, people will be upset at different things, again just the way it is. Dont think anyone is going to chase any one of us to include the 900 hour guy......
---
I was hopeing for a mini Deathclaw like Stripe in FO4. Wishful thinking clearly
---
0/10 would ban them all again
---
Lol y'all can downvote me all you want, but I'm not wrong. Announcing that you're leaving is stupid, pointless, and literally nobody cares!! If you're gonna stop playing, just simply stop playing. It is literally that easy
---
hey!  i got an idea!  every one please down vote this!  i am curious to see how LOW WE CAN GO!!!!
---
Correct. The receiver determines the cards it benefits from.
---
I'll tell you what *does* bug me.  When other players use the "I need reviving" emote when they don't actually need to be revived.
---
How can you
---
i farm deathclaws..i would never ever go there
---
If you could fire little explosve balls then YEH sounds awezome
---
ok i will :D
---
Awesome thanks for the help!
---
What does it even matter there is no end game content.
---
Thanks alot
---
Yes. Your gun won't benefit from rifleman perk until you switch back to semi auto receiver
---
what the hell???  it is going up??   HA HA HA!!
---
Downvoted for incessant whining about downvotes. Also, it's far more likely that you and the handful of other people reporting this are simply clicking shit too fast and either selling the item or dropping it by mistake.
---
I would bare knuckle fight a deathclaw to get a legendary drill.
---
The absence of that continues to be a real mystery to me.
---
Can't take anymore of these anti quit posts! I'm out! You can't haz my stuff either!
---
/s
---
Yeah I see that a lot
---
Ok Chief. Telling me that I don’t do something every day that I don’t is a quick way to ensure I don’t listen to what you have to say. 
---
I certainly don’t have the ability to play for 8 hours a day, but I have killed quite a few people. 
---
The 3 most common builds I see are:
---
1) PA with a heavy weapon (usually .50 cal with TSE/AAE)
---
2) Some variation of an unarmed build (either aa/bloodied with swing speed)
---
3) Standard Rifle/shotgun build with AAE/TSE
---
Btw I’m past level 160 so it’s always a the deathly one with a skull
---
EXACTLY. No one is going to try and come after you for leaving. If you're done playing, then you're done playing. No need to announce it
---
I hate it when I finally get a 2 or 3 star and it only level 35 and they drop shitty 3 star wood armor.
---
I have a suggestion, what about stop reading this kind of post and just read what you are really interested for, it will change your perspective of the world, i mean you can keep being a dick for no reason or just be a little bit more nice with ppl who like to express theyself. 
---
Btw no english so if you find any gramatical or cohesive error please let me know so i will improve my writing :D
---
They’re a major pain....I’ve only found about30 since beta, accidentally scrapped 1/3rd of them....random finds in containers and random drops from glowing ones at nuka springs....I just keep running and pick up everything, get very overweight And sort it all out after my melee Weapon breaks
---
Wow, no wonder out military is going to shit. I will hump whatever leg I want and is dog face really an insult? I mean I know I’m not terribly attractive, but honestly dog face is one of the nicest things people have said about me. Might I suggest something along the lines of my acne scars looking like I got in a fight with a shotgun and lost. Still not good, but would at least make the list of top things I heard this month.  
---
If I put anything in your mouth it wouldn’t be words.

Jeez this sub hates anyone who has anything remotely negative to say about 76.

Lol thats funny

Not exactly true since there was a bit of a bug noted by Bethesda. Their fix was to close the application completely and the Atom Shop would reset. I checked every day but still missed  one because of that since I usually put the PS4 in rest mode instead of shutting down. I don't care about the egg, but makes me wonder what else I may have missed if that's how the shop works. Now that there's a bunny head I missed out on, I may be a little bit annoyed.

If you didn’t care you’d keep scrolling. Sounds like your pissy someone’s leaving.
---
"you put out a shiny turd"... 
---
"please let me back in to play this horrible, shitty game".
---
think what ya like buddy.  that is what i fought for.
---
It would be one thing if these types of posts were rare and didn't pop up all the time, but they do. It's annoying, it's unnecessary, and it's stupid to announce that you're done playing. If you're done playing, just tell your friends if you feel like it and then leave!
---
Also, your english looks pretty good :)
---
Its reddit not politics
---
Well, when you're junior high aged, and you spend 900 hours in a few months playing a game... chances are you aren't exactly a whiz in school.
---
and all of the loot as well
---
Because it was worth more in the past.  Even if it was an outfit I already had, it still made finding Technical Data feel special.
---
Where do ghouls play golf?
---
On a golf corpse.

That makes no sense, why waste it on new players that will just die or run. I think making it a deathclaw farm should have been how it was from the get go. I mean it's super disappointing for long time fans even when we were new to 76. "Oh my God a whole island! Nope, nope, just one sick one...blah."
---
Steam but I thinks it's because of the compatibility of Windows.
---
I was just looking the same thing.  The annoying thing is the best ag farm locations are in the safe zone.
---
Given that the responders/free states lore is clearly full-on socialist and live free or die, I'd say there's still a healthy amount.
---
Absolutely no, lol. The point is they don't die, they turn into Glowing enemies/etc.
---
Number one I'm not complaining because I'm downloads I'm complaining because people don't acknowledge a problem. Number two you're proving my point. If you read what I posted or what other people posted this isn't an accident of someone selling something or dropping something. Stop acting like it doesn't exist. Most people that have stuff vanished there on mule characters where they keep an inventory list. No one is selling or dropping stuff off mule characters by accident. I also made it very clear that I didn't sell anything. I don't sell weapons so I couldn't accidentally sold it and it's favorited so I can't accidentally drop it. So really why did you even bother posting? Just to cause drama? It's people like you that are literally the reason that Reddit has problems to begin with. Read what people say before you comment and look stupid as f***
---
...literally how is me saying it's unnecessary to post this shit means that I'm pissy that someone is leaving? Lmfao you're dumb
---
Yeah, I don't think Luck actually helps with RNG, though I agree it should.
---
I'll even take my chances on RND and get a walking stick, but make it a 3 star.
---
Gotcha. So when I crafted my PA with Power Smith active it made my armor more durable and that should be for the life of the armor. Therefore, I can unequip it now and just repair it to 200% every so often but it will always be more durable and from now on out only the condition of it will fluctuate. Am I understanding that right?
---
I’ll have to stock up on supplies... I’ll see what I can do though!
---
BUT I WANT ALL YOUR CAPS D:
---
Dang..ok. I was thinking they would drop from Bloodbugs and fought about 50 to 60 with nothing to show. I guess it's off to a nuked whitesprings.
---
Okay.
---
Because the text of Rad Sponge suggests that it heals rads off your teammates (it's implicitly shared), which made me wonder how it works if I manually shared it with the CHA 3 option.
---
lol, seems that way, huh?  i remember now the guy who posted about him being at 900+ hours.  he got slammed too.  no big deal though, i find these nincompoops hilarious.  like i said, was feeling a bit down today, now i could not be more happy.
---
&gt;Map-wise I think the interiors of several cells, including the Silos are slightly south-southeast of the White Powder lodge (this is also where the interior of the Dev room was before).
---
Let me get this straight, are you saying that the interior of a location isn't necessarily underneath the map marker? If so, this could be a game changer, and I second the request to see the map.
---
Awesome thank you! You just freed up 9 perk points for me!
---
They never will.

We live ina  society now, wherein everyone is a minor celbrity in their own mind.

"look at what I'm eating for lunch."

"Look at  my new clothes."

"I got mah hair did, look at it."
---
"Is this a zit?"
---
Nah, they're never going to stop, everyone today is convinced that everyone gives a shit about what they have to say.
---
I always appreciate people helping with crowd control.  I think that unless you're on a team, you shouldn't count or expect people to revive though.  Just respawn.
---
And every time I visit this subreddit I see more people complaining about complainers than actual people complaining, so 🤷🏿‍♀️
---
Heh, you may be right. I'll try keep my cynicism under control. 😏
---
The point of a nuke zone is to collect fulx, or raise the level/loot of enemies in the area. If you are high enough level, west tek only spawns max level mutants, and there isn’t much flora around, so the only point is to get hardened mass and other nuke materials, which can be acquired in greater quantity at whitesprings.
---
They found objects which had the coding attached which says that the object is intended for the atom shop. 
---
Pretty sure they also pulled them out of the dev rooms or something, I know i saw videos of them opening.
---
I used to call them flying rats. Now Cancerbats, lol, ty!

"The thing about happiness is that you only know you had it when it's gone. I mean, you may think to yourself that you're happy. But you don't really believe it. You focus on the petty bullshit, or the next job, or whatever. It's only looking back by comparison with what comes after that you really understand, that's what happiness felt like."

My favorite quote in any video game ever.

Wonderful job dude, looks just like him!

I had not noticed that.

O shet

Gotcha, thanks for the response!
---
Pipe rifles vs pipe pistols if pistols are infinitely lighter why use the rifle mod?
---
You do realize that you coming here and complaining about my complaining, complaining about people who announce their departure, is kind of ironic, right?
---
I dont expect anyone too. And I'm usaly on a team
---
It is what my father, mother, both grandfathers, one great grandfather, three first cousins, my sister, and I all fought for and we all treated people with more respect than you have shown here.
---
To be fair we also all fought for your freedoms (assuming you are in the US) to be a jerk so I guess it is fine in the end.
---
A nice list. I'd only add that the roadmap release page stated that the number of stars on the items you scrap will matter, since that might be useful hint to guide hoarding, or it might be a red herring.
---
Despite the fact that Preston Garvey isn’t even a twinkle in his daddies nut sack at this point, you really want to use THAT guy as role model? "Oh general, you’re so wise and powerful, not go do my bidding all over the commonwealth while I kick back in your old house". Screw that guy.
---
two shot explosive slingshot? haha
---
I mean, that's just part of long-term game growth.  You can either have something be a one-in-a-million roll and remain incredibly rare or eventually more people will land that 1-in-10,000 and it starts to get slightly less desirable as it filters through the community.  I have no need for shielded BOS lining, so I gave it to my melee friend and she undoubtedly crafted all her melee buddies BOS suits.
---
is this in the american server? because that would explain the diference in "builds" play styles and atitude twords the game..
---
&gt;1) PA with 
---
that is a stop right there. pa only role is if you use a reflector melle build and even taht its shit . pa is shit in general lol.
---
&gt;Some variation of an unarmed build 
---
LMAO only good if you have 300 stealth boys.
---
&gt;3) Standard Rifle/shotgun build with AAE/TSE
---
in  automatic  rifles and auto combat shotungs? if yes tose are not actually bad. if single fire they are shit.
---
anyways i didnt mean to sound condescendidng. its reddit you cant convey a tone wile typing. lol
---
well, lets see.  looking at the list of F2P games.  think i will give planetside 2 a try.  build up some PvP skills, for when PvP here gets out of beta.
---
You are free to do so, in the immortal words of Ron Swanson.
---
Yeah, I hit 185 recently. I always find a swarm of level 42 bloodbugs. Once or twice I remember it being ants or radrats or something. We are talking about the area directly under the tower, correct?
---
Self awareness is not your strong suit, I see.
---
Thought it'll get few laughs its discussion aint nothing gonna happen anyway
---
Best weapon in the game. Goes further the higher your strength is.
---
Neither is it yours, apparently
---
No you “fought” to protect the interests of the wealthy and corporations. We haven’t been directly attacked by any country in our lifetimes. Yet we’re waging 7 wars currently against countries that didn’t attack us and are standing by as our “allies” commit genecide with our weaponry. Soldiers these days aren’t heros and judging by all the other comments, you sound like an idiot. Thanks for leaving Appalachia though
---
&gt; Deathclaw farming
---
It ain't much, but its honest work.
---
That would be cool! What if the server alerted us when he set up, kinda like when the sheepsquatch event sets up
---
I don't plant crops anymore for this reason. When I first started playing a high level destroyed my entire base one piece at a time and I could fix everything..... except my single blackberry bush and had to scour the wasteland for it haha

You got to be kidding, are you seriously shielding this Corp selling system? do i have to remind you that we all have already bought a AAA game for 60USD with microtransactions in a poorly state of development?

It's a fucking miracle.  A reply that doesn't call me an idiot or berate my ideas out of hand.  You must clearly be an actual punk rocker.  Pleased to meet you!

Just wait until you VATs critical a low level enemy and they go sailing 500 yards as their head disintegrates

LifeHand Island?
---
max lvl antiarmor handmade 25 firerate DR/ER while aim
---
That’s why I made a build that uses pipe rifles and wooden armor.
---
I play the game. I enjoy it. I also recognize that it’s still deeply broken in ways that I understand why people are quitting. It’s not a good game, but it’s okay to still enjoy it. Stop pretending it’s a moral stance to like it.
---
Dang you need to focuse on your school and hang out wit friend in rl be cool stay in school
---
Here is an idea let’s get a 4 star item lol
---
My dying breath would be "but he said there was an updaaaate....".  And then he'd feel terrible.  Why do you wish these things upon others, OP? WHHYYYYY
---
Might depend on platform, but on XB1, that item was heavily duped during that phase, making them very common.
---
5 times a row *star legendary and jetpack plans some ghouls have beter loot like main boss great way to keep end game players in game bethesda,bethesda never change
---
Me and my friends launched 3 nukes in the past 2 days.
---
I'm not??? I'm saying it's dumb and pointless to announce when you're leaving the game cause nobody cares. Can you not read or??
---
Yes, there has been an issue with nuke silos, I experienced it 3 times over the weekend. Not to mention the SB Queen quest failed twice aswell, been a bit glitchy since last patch. Xbox platform. I don't understand why you are getting downvoted over a question? Oh yeah, that is how it works around here, gliched!
---
And as grand high nukey nukey pubaah, you should get first choice of all loot!
---
I've seen a couple go for 10k or so recently. Not sure if it was just good deals or if thats the standard price
---
On ps4 in my region, I notice most people launch on weekends. 
---
To me the meta feels like:
---
Farm 1-2 hours on weeknights, then go nuts in nuke zones on the weekends.
---
Nuke runs themselves take time, plus fighting/farming the sbq. Just kinda how it works out.
---
But, in my experience, if you yourself nuke it during the week, people will come!
---
And 1 copy of every possible legendary weapon in the game, infinite caps, and the keys to Todd Howard's home.
---
I was thinking more AliveMitten mainland area
---
First of all, thanks a lot mate, i think my english suck a bit because i've never learned, just playing games and gathering some info.
---
And btw i feel you, it is unnecessary but still you can just dont look at them, im a greedy bastard i watch everysingle post in here because im working and i do not have nothing to do so.. this is why i am here, but still i hate this post as much as you, but it still being fun to read the comments :P
---
I know they are duped but I dont see many now
---
well, it was fun trolling with y'all.  you guys made my day!  turned a unhappy day in to a happy day!  and a special shout out to

sure hope you find what you are looking for.  piece of advice....you will not find it here!

i am off for some PS2 PvP
---
But how come the nuke kills players/sheepsquatch but not other enemies I mean realistically nothing should survive the power of a sun.
---
Yeah it has been an effort to try to get duplicate holo tapes. Nuka Tapper is the easiest to get, thus starting with that game. I want to run these for all the games on a regular basis moving forward so the hunt is on to find more.

Funny enough building the camp and the terminals was the easiest part of this endeavor.

People have told me things from 10k to 50k so I have no idea lol

Thank god someone said it

The plan is a hot fix tomorrow that will address the mod issue.

I read somewhere we are getting patch 8.5 tomorrow with a fix, wish I could remember where so I could put a link but I’ve a brain like a sieve atm
---
Realistically, it's a videogame. Logic doesn't apply
---
Oh, on reddit? You can only see karma / upvotes and downvote after a certain amount of time passes. Think it's an hour. Unless it's your own post or comment.
---
Yes please. I'm saving all my .38 ammo for this reason
---
Two shot and explosive
---
Lol I gotcha, I see what you mean. Sometimes just reading through the comments can be funny, and eh true, I could just not click on them. Most of the time I don't, but I still see lots of them anyways, which is what is annoying. That's all
---
You were the one that called a guy a loser when he was defending you. I’m still not sure why you did that. One person said the game wasn’t good and then the person you called a loser said you must have liked it.  Also you must have missed where I included myself. I did join back in 1993.
---
Sad megasloth is sad

Unyielding sentinel +1 luck combat leg.  I think someone was trying to swap gear on toons or over clicked.

i was at WS last night after it was a blast zone...and to my surprise..there was a ton of glowing ones there..i thought they sort of nerfed the respawns there but there was a lot
---
Same issue, I put my money on last patch.
---
What about a broken bottle melee weapon? there's all different kinds of bottles out there just waiting for us to smash in some heads
---
TSE 90% Reduced Weight LMG.  I couldn't believe it.  Sold it on the Market forum for 11k caps.
---
Oh I meant regular pistols like 10mm and rifles like lever action rifle not pipe weapons.
---
I think it would be...better....if they simply gave us the option to "split" a ranked card.  You have Adrenaline 5, split it into Adrenaline 3 and adrenaline 2.  Then you can recombine them later.    
---
Or simply let us choose "How" active a card is, we only want it at level 3, but the card has a max level of 5, we simply aren't using 2 of them.  
---
Those are the options I would prefer.  you can have cards at max level, but not be using them at that level.
---
That’s a fair price, I bought one for that last night. Let me link you to someone else who offered one to me
---
Both would be great to have.
---
Even with armor and outfits clipping atleast we would have a choise to make.
---
 I really hope someone at bethesda has thought about this.
---
It said I already completed the challenge when I logged in but didn't get any atoms. :(
---
I'm sure it's a money thing, you could get rich real fast selling ammo i imagine.
---
Trade.
---
Keeping all 2 and 3 stars ... Is hard on stash space even with several characters so is considering dropping the 2 stars ... Dont delay him again Bethesda or my stash will explode!
---
You can view all comments from bethesda devs at https://nukacrypt.com/test/php/devtracker
---
Currently a WIP though, any feedback is appreciated.
---
It’s just as, if not more, dumb and pointless to announce your annoyance at others announcing they are done. Congratulations, you attempted to lower the level of discourse and succeeded.
---
u/FattToney
---
The difference being that Skryim wasn't designed to be multiplayer, so they didn't care if you made a mod. This would be more like the private WoW servers, and Bethesda would probably have to have them shut down like Blizzard did.
---
Yeah, noticed there's significantly less SBQ fights/Whitespring nukes in the last two months. But that's also around the time I played the game considerably less due to the terrible loot pools.
---
SBQ gives a bit more variety in loot like the Prime plans these days so...yay? But if I'm still getting Ultracite Explosive vents after 6 months with no real tweaks to the SBQ loot pool along with less players/nukes?...Fuck it, I cant be bothered at that point.
---
Crawl out thru that fallout!

It will be a blessed patch if they fix the friend's list

There are some YT videos of someone using an auto 10mm pistol, that made me consider making a new build around it, but it's strictly PvE only. 
---
Sorry, I don't have a link, but you shoukd check it out before you give up on pistols.
---
The best part I don't think he has a daddy/mom. He's a well hidden low key synth. XD
---
1. You come here, whining about me complaining, which is very ironic cause now YOU are complaining,
---
2. You tried to change the subject and make it sound like I was talking about how good the game is???
---
3. You're weird and dumb, I feel like I just lost a shit ton of brain cells after dealing with you
---
Because unnecessary posts get down voted and 0 comments and go straight to the bottom. Everyone in this thread is stating they don’t care what he has to say but they took the time to comment on his thread. Does that make sense? I’m dumb? Yet you and others are the ones trying to tell me you don’t care by responding to me. Your best course of action next time is to not respond. That would show you actually don’t care.
---
Could have at least given a bunny suit...
---
Everywhere? Sort by new. Lots of topics get posted here.
---
If it could spawn from a Rad Storm; that may explain it.
---
I nuke when I need flux, and SBQ is just a bonus really. It's a lot of exp and some caps as well. IDK, 15 minutes to nuke, then you get 200+ violet flux and queen rewards. Not bad. I'm doing it on my alt now so that I get prime plans that I can sell too.
---
OWO dreams do come true.
---
Ah, thanks for the clarification.
---
I was hoping the eggs would hatch too :(
---
Anarchy isn't a real political ideology.  It's the antithesis of community that only exists theoretically or in brief flashes of political turmoil.  Punk music is by and large very socialist in lyrical content and community.  Anarchy is a angsty, testosterone-fueled teenage dream, about as realistic as Marxist Communism.  Just a wild idea that looks flashy on paper.  You can't build any form of stable community with anarchy.
---
New this please, new that please.
---
I mean im as pumped for as you for new content but I would rather they spend their resources on fixing bugs and improving performance. 
---
To me its kind of annoying alot of the new content patches have little to no bugfixes. And theres so many bugs that have returned last boss still drops shit as does new event boss. I mean their entire loot system needs to be ripped out and balanced properly.
---
 Since the Explosive perk dont drop anymore on Energy guns, it is very rare now, of course it was duped a lot in the past, i´ve seeing this from 10 to 50k on the markets.
---
Good suggestion.
---
8k. Most sell between 6-8k when being reasonable.
---
"what they're worth".
---
They are artificial goods, they're "worth" nothing. Bitching that you can't sell them for as much fake money as possible is, quite possibly, the dumbest shit I've ever heard. 
---
"but I need lots of fake dollars for this possibly duped item, of which there are tons more, so I can spend that fake money on more fake stuff... but the game doesn't allow me to sell it for as much fake money as I want".
---
So, in otherwords, a bunch of players that pretend to hate "pay to win" mechanics in games, when the developer makes money, really like "pay to win" when they can exploit the game, and sell worthless crap they found or made, for a ton of in game fake money, so they can buy their way to being more powerful".
---
Got it. Makes PERFECT sense.
---
Nah dog what threw me off was you saying I was pissy cause someone is leaving. I'm annoyed cause I see posts like this all the time. I don't give a fuck if someone stops playing 76, these posts are just dumb and unnecessary cause nobody cares if they stop playing
---
well i agree
---
its been said literally hundreds of times if not thousands.
---
bethesda isnt listening / caring / communicating that they would care to finish the game.
---
all the passionate players fell away because of this and in lurking i see the same ideas of what the game brutally needs just posted up over and over by a bunch of different players.
---
we tried and we gave up a long time ago, all i do now is lurk and watch the same stuff getting said to No recognition.
---
Canines - Claim workshops in the forest and defend them while doing other things, eventually you'll have to fight waves of canines.
---
Mirelurks - I did Swarm of Suitors event in the Toxic Valley over and over and server hopped till I saw it.  Nice and quick.
---
Bugs - I kept an eye out for the TeaTime event in the forest as lots of bugs attack in waves.
---
Yeah, I thought about it but I mean "more stars means better chance of getting your dream legendary" or however they phrased it, didn't actually say anything meaningful. 
---
It could be anything from "extra tokens mean more random rolls on legendaries" to "guarantee yourself a 3-star item" and about a billion other things. Ultimately I think it's best left as "just wait and we'll find out sooner or later" instead of more speculation feeding the confusion.
---
I think the hunter coat and longshoreman outfit are pretty good but I agree we really need more rag-tag outfits for sure. I want less cute and more wasteland.
---
Depends who is the area, they can be 16 - 64 and normally a boss scorpion, either a glowing one or crowned. You can stand on the steps on the cabin on the right and take pot shots at them, tedious, but will eventually get the job done ..

According to the updated roadmap we will be getting it tomorrow, it was originally delayed but they forgot to change the daily/weekly challenges.

We served to protect everything. You are 100% right in that we wage wars we have no business being involved in and those are done waged by rich people and put people in danger in both sides. I don’t agree with those things and quite honestly a great many things the country is doing, but we have the right to vote to change them which many places do not. This country could not survive without a military but we do need people in charge that will use it for more defense than offense and far more humanitarian efforts that are not greed fueled but we all need to vote those people in. 
---
Also I’m not the person leaving Fo76. I not really sure which of my comments would be considered idiotic except the silly self deprecating one.
---
You should tweet that at the Bethesda Twitter accounts. They might retweet it because it's just a cool pic.
---
I've got a full set of Shrouded Unyielding Wood armour (and loads of other ledge wood pieces). It's good for being a fast sneak with ridiculous attack power at low health. Just don't get hit!
---
What about not picking it up?
---
Do you think the game is telling you something? :D /jk
---
Why are still here if you don’t care?
---
It's shouldn't be called a nuke then only a enemy amplifier that increases 'insert sciency stuff here to justify its strength'
---
on the subject of crossbows I want a extended magazine :D
---
I'm sure they are doing, but it's a big company, I'm sure they can spare a few people for new weapon content etc
---
theres a really smart player who already suggests this as one of the vital streamlines for the perk system. they also suggested gaining the option to hide cards, so that as you rank up you possess every rank and simply hide the ones you don't have a use for.
---
no one in the community team or anywhere has acknowledged that this is needed to finish the perk or control binding system and make it more usable and less bloated.
---
haven't seen them players post in a while because the game devs and team seem so out of touch as to never acknowledge a few key areas that need to be playable for the fun of pvp or difficult raids. not to mention how bad everyone wants a group clan system with leveling and shared building CAMP
---
I don't know about you, man. But I've been getting 3* drops left and right. Last time I blasted my way through the Whitespring Golf Club I came away with three 3* legendaries.
---
I have one but I won't be on for atleast 24 hours I work till 10pm tonight m gotta hit the bed n get up at 6 n do it again lol if ur still interested I'll send a message when I get off tomorrow
---
Just a note, if you've got the flux, you can craft them at chemistry stations.  If you do then they'll have 113 durability instead of 100.  You also don't risk unwanted pvp. 
---
I don't recall the exact recipe, but it's surprisingly reasonable, with stable flux being the hardest material to get and the rest being commonish.
---
i got level 15 handmade with vampiric if you want to buy
---
Oh I was explaining why I called you dumb and why I was confused, if you couldn't tell by what I literally just said. Lol
---
Almost 100% I saw it, they released a new updated video after nerf and its still good but just really bad luck, I've never found a Two Shot 10mm let alone a TSE 10mm and Im also ok with vats perks on it but just that RNG really wreaking me.
---
imagine being level 300 and you have PILES of unnecessary cards and some you wish were down rank but don't have those ones yet. the system is whack
---
I have a 2 star Instigating Swing Speed lvl 50 with Spikes and then I have a 3 star Instigating Swing Speed +1 end lvl 5 with spikes. You got an offer? The lvl 5 is worth more than the 50
---
Yeah they hate these posts yet there are more than 50 comments. Seems like these posts are keeping them occupied.
---
Whilst I miss the seperation of skills and perks, I do rate how the new system promotes actual builds compared to 4s jack of all trades. However I also associate perk cards with the word **tedious**.
---
Also...if you’re interested in a Junky exchange I’d be glad to trade u chems u need for ones I use: Daytripper and Daddyo are the main ones I need but I also use medx and mentats (don’t really need to trade for them but just so you know they aren’t available for swaps)
---
That's because Bethesda told everyone this is the best place for suggestions
---
That's what I have heard
---
Is karma hidden plus how is it calculated?
---
See that the lowest anyone has said
---
100% agree.  I've been wearing the Drifter outfit to cover up a couple gangly, spiky trapper pieces that look more harmful to myself than the enemies.
---
That is a good deal. Even at 200 hours it’s a good deal.
---
Sounds dangerous.
---
It's the true price, IMO. On Xbox, knock off about 1k since it is astoundingly common.
---
definition of bloat. there's no gameplay, the change would be a slight buff to gaining the different levels in one single perk faster than you can now by eliminating the redandant aspect of Combining and losing a lower rank. Feels like a series of test apps for what could be a frickin amazing online game after the rest of what it needs to be an online game gets made
---
Like next patch almost only had fixes for survival mode that doesnt affect me at all. And theres so much broken as of last patch it really makes me scared. I know its only one week of playing on a bad version but this time we didnt get downtime so we’ve been stuck on a buggy build for almost two weeks.
---
I now use almost exclusively conduits for power distribution.  The one problem I have is getting the power between floors or from inside to outside since some of the building material is a little too thick for proper alignments and causes the conduits to not want to join together.  What I normally do now is either plan to run my power exclusively inside or outside with minimal through wall/ceiling connection.  I do run missile launchers on my roof so I ran in interior conduit up to the corner roof section and then used a power conduit which just barely protrudes above the roof but it sticks up just enough enough to make a connection.  The good thing about doing all my conduit runs internally is that almost nothing is exposed enough to be able to target. I can send pics later if you want
---
Does pretty good damage
---
Please just stop. It's a solid, fun mechanic.
---
pretty sure you sold it to vendor :)
---
Well good thing I'm not on xbox. I never see the dam things on ps4
---
they dont care, all the really attentive players fell away because they havent shown that they care about finishing these test app feature elements
---
I have one if you're interested, PM me for details!
---
I've been running them solo in 15-17 minutes for months now and haven't noticed any sort of changes. Sometimes it seems like the turrets don't spawn, or I get lower than average robot spawns during the final segment, but that seems to be completely random.
---
Death is a preferable alternative to communism.
---
The surprise bear is a hallmark of an MMORPG, though.
---
76 Isn't full MMO, but it's close enough.
---
But I mean pipe wise though.
---
Build a wall fuk it
---
I find three at Kiddie Corner cabins pretty frequently as well. Just jump on the rooftops which aren't too high for non-mutants, and take them out from above. Easy pickings!
---
Yup, I throw 1 every patch.
---
I think they might be keyed to the wrong object. The size of the explosion looks suspiciously like that of the Nukatron's quantum shots from FO4.
---
Is there a max level? Has some got every variation of the perk cards yet?
---
I hate bethesda and I hate fallout 76 I tried not to but I enjoyed it for like 57 levels and then realized I was deluded and no one is listening to what needs to be done to finish the break it early test applications they released.
---
Yeah the legs especially on trapper armor are weird with the spikes that stick out in angles that don't look useful at all? 
---
But hopefully Bethesda is watching - the raider excavator PA skin was a step in the right direction to me personally - just need more of that.
---
Welch? I just farmed mole miners the whole time.
---
Do you need your armor modded or do you want someone to make and mod a set for you? I can do either
---
Hello,
---
I have free power armor frames to give if you want one.  It comes completely free and with the fusion core included.  I’ll even give you an extra fusion core or two.  If you don’t believe me, I have already posted about giving away power armor and already gave away a few. And because you’re so low level, I’ll even throw in some ammunition and regular armor pieces.  Maybe even some legendary armor.  Hope that sounds good and message me if you’re interested and we can set up a meet time online. :)
---
I'd be interested in the level 50 despite the adds on the level 5. Are you interested in trades or caps? I may have something to suit your build. We could start negotiations at 3k? What are your thoughts?
---
This needs to be pinned to the top of the main sub!!!
---
According to leaked images people have seen of the real Sheepsquatch those quills look exactly like the quills on his back. Same color pattern and all.
---
Says the literal trash.
---
Wow what a very original idea, that I've never heard before.
---
Mine was fine, then it was doing that, then I moved it and it was fine again. Try moving it maybe?
---
When I was low level I was able to hang there for long. It was easier and cost me less stimpacks/aid items to farm the island
---
Sheepsquatch I think. You might hear some kind of roar. Were you just south of Harper’s ferry when you discovered the random event?
---
Just examples yall focusing to much on it just venting
---
You literally can't insult me with that when I named myself that. Lmao. You tried
---
Democracy will never be defeated
---
If you haven’t tried apex it’s pretty fun. It’s the first battle royal I’ve played and I’m enjoying it so far.
---
You’re wrong and stupid. But if I’m so wrong, then tell the first person to answer the post I’m about to link how wrong they are, since apparently no effect is multiplicative. Go tell them that and watch yourself get laughed out of that post like this one.

---
Last night I had a 3 star legendary Super Mutant drop a 1 star legendary walking cane.
---
I can craft or mod all BOS. I can also add dense mods to chest, and deep pocketed or ultra-light to limbs.
---
I'll do it for at least partial mats and karma.
---
Won't be on until tomorrow evening though. 
---
GT is same as ID
---
Thought i have seen this challange before.
---
I have a question. I havr like 25 but when I take 1 out of stash it doesnt activate the quest. Must I give them to a friend and then they give me one at a time to properly start it or am I missing something?
---
I said this like five times now. I do not sell weapons or anything like that to vendors. All I sell is serums and before that hats. I don't sell anything else ever. I also have her favorited so I can't drop it either. This also isn't the first time it's happened it's probably the fourth or fifth time I simply didn't care until it was something important like now. I really don't understand why you and other people refuse to acknowledge it's a real problem. There are people with inventory list on you will characters that see stuff and change. Those are characters people don't sell anything and don't drop anything. Please stop posting stuff saying it was an accident or didn't happen because all that does is not make Bethesda think it's a real problem and they refuse to fix it
---
Agreed.  I didn't buy it because I run around in T-51b, but I appreciated the design choice.  The "desert camo" wasteland wanderer skin whatever it is was also nice.  I got the bundle deal and it looks magnificent.
---
I think the durability is tied to a stat (likely INT), because mine have 117% charge. 
---
&gt;I don't recall the exact recipe
---
1 stable flux of each flavor.
---
I would like to see this happen
---
Saw him in grafton yesterday! Good guy, theres meat over them hills
---
It was explained about as reasonably as the Atom shop could be....
---
i think its okay that they drop 1\* sometimes but atm its almost always a 1\*....
---
if they would drop always a 3\* then 3\* items become the new 1\* star items aka nothing special
---
Fallout doesn’t follow science. It follows “Science!”
---
Make and Mod. I can give mats and Caps for time
---
I was thinking more for it, but we're not way off. We can settle at 3500. If that sounds okay I'll be on later tonight
---
Oh Im set, 3 alternates packed with legendaries and I plan to farm legendaries later to fill more characters up. But just really just farming to hopefully get that sweet 10mm TSE
---
Hmmm. I would put it at 600 -1350. At most though it could hit 1600 (depends on person). My estimate
---
Not ready for a full announcement yet :) Slowly re-designing the old site and adding new features. Ill probably make a post about it in the next week or two.
---
You’re not fooling anyone
---
GT is knucklessyrup
---
I would absolutely love Deathclaw Horde event. As a primarily ranged character outside of PA; Deathclaw of any decent level (I'm level 70) are still a threat, especially cause they can be sneaky bastards.
---
First, they fixed the silo runners glitch.
---
Second, they made the queen boring and worst than before.
---
That's high for non bloodied all things considered
---
It would be really cool to also get counter faction quests. Like the brotherhood gets a mission to blow up that patrol MODUS just sent out, or the free states have to fight off the Chinese etc...
---
I am in the same boat. My pistol character has multiple three star rifles. I would love to use those on my rifle character, but have no way to transfer them.
---
I use a super basic anti armor automatic 10mm. It is enough to carry me through PVE and even PVP. The only issue is SBQ as I cannot reliably keep sneak attack up.
---
Pistols are best in vats. My automatic 10mm gets 12 shots with 15 agility. A pipe pistol gets about 14. They are fantastic with concentrated fire. A couple missed shots and suddenly you are capped on accuracy for a barrage if head shots. The critical vats nerfs and one shot protection took them out of secret God tier, but they are still pretty good. I calculate my potential DPS to be 1,900. For PVP, you may not win a man fight, but if you stay behind cover, and time your attacks right, you can easily have a winning record against full sentinel set users.
---
Lool best funny I see here.
---
You’re cool, want to be friends?
---
After all that? Nah, I'm good
---
PSN Flooping_pig
---
Guys I just played FO76 for 700 hours and I’m boreddddd. This game is empty and lacking content!! I feel ripped off. Something something fallout new vegas
---
i got one perk card in level 1 one in level 2 and level 3 maybe in level 4 .... thats the moost useless cards i got lol
---
Fantastic, we have a deal. I will pm you my psn tag and plan to meet up with you later. Thanks for the quick replies!
---
I'm jelly you have those double shot explosive weapons.
---
But you’re so calm, polite, and friendly!
---
Thanks for the info
---
I personally don't have Bloody Mess or Adrenaline. If someone can prove that they stack, and aren't separate and multiplicative, then I was wrong that all effects are multiplicative.
---
Oh, and dumbass, that proves my point. The top comment says that general damage perks stack, all else is multplicative. Slugger is not a general damage perk.
---
Either way, our argument is about Super Sledge vs unarmed, though. You're denying 3 things, despite proof right in front of our eyes: Super Sledge's perks outweigh unarmed, Slugger is a mulitplicative perk, and Super Sledge has the highest max damage of all melee.
---
The people who post about leaving are the first ones to come back. It's like they need to make a post to prove to themselves they actually want to stop playing. The people who really quit and don't come back are the ones that plain old just stop playing. They don't make some big deal about it making posts about how they quit and uninstalled and all that shit. 
---
Who cares either way though, no reason to have a temper  tantrum like OP.
---
XBOX has been absolutely horrible since they introduced Laying Lowe. Frame rate stutter, random disconnects and the whole host of issues that appeared to have been corrected are seemingly back. I don’t know if it was the content or another misfire on version control
---
It's not meant to be equal in power, none of the legendary effects are
---
Seems like you don’t understand how reddit works. This thread now has upwards of 50 comments. It’d have about 5 if everyone who came here to say they didn’t care just kept scrolling. You still seem kinda pissy.
---
I've been wanting this for a while as well. I think there's a lot of room for different accessories. 
---
I like the prisoner collar but if we can have that I think there could be an option to wear the bandanas around your neck or around your arm instead of over your face. I think a spike collar or junk collars would be neat. 
---
It would be neat if you could also have a version of the underarmors that could go over the armor - like the BOS officer suit and the raider underarmor are a couple of my favorites and I would like to wear just that without my tacky armor showing.
---
I think we need more creepy bone accessories as well. More cultist stuff!
---
I mean I am when you're not a dick to me 🤷🏻‍♀️ otherwise I'm a dick back
---
I have 16 GB Ram and a GeForce GTX1060 3GB. 
---
I've been playing with Task Manager up on my other monitor and noticed that my "during lockpicking" CTDs tend to happen when my GPU hits 100% while opening the lock
---
I \*seem\* to be able to avoid it by trying for a moment when it's under 99% to push the (W on PC) button, but not sure if it's actually a working thing or one of those placebo "swing your NES controller to jump father" deals
---
I'd pick a lot more locks if I wasn't worried about losing progress clearing a location, from the CTD
---
That's why I said it's my estimation plus it's a sniper weapon people are gonna wanna want a 1 shotty sniper explosive fetish.
---
Mine did it a lot right when they dropped it but it seemed to fix itself.
---
I love emoting to people to come over and when they get close, I activate it.
---
You can always tell who has seen it before or not by their panicked step back😂
---
lol my camp is literally right across the street from there on that lake. I round em up and drags em over to my camp. let the turrets do the work.
---
I think it's a bug that it keeps appearing. I only have it reappear after I pick up another legendary item.  It might be fixed in the patch tomorrow.  I'll be watching the patch notes for that one.
---
GT is Harry Wagstaff. send me an invite, i could use a break from server hopping for plans
---
I have just experienced this on a number of occasions.
---
I hear the 'click' then unceremoniously CTDs.
---
As yourself I cannot narrow it down to a certain lock.
---
I do wonder - because in my case is always after a successful 'pick' - if something in the loot causes it. Circular levelled lists for instance can cause CTDs and the way they are 'nested' in this game is possible that one particular entry in the godawful multi-levelled tangle is a 'bad' one.
---
I suspect that they'll turn some items into containers of sorts. Like you'll be able to interact with the magazine rack to deposit magazines, which will then "display" them in a non-interactive fashion. Presumably those new containers will also be linked to your stash and inaccessible to other players, otherwise we'll be flooded with "asshole griefers blew up my wall, broke in, and stole my magazine/bobblehead/whatever collection!!@!@" threads.
---
I just like to milk Chally the Moo Moo.
---
Only if there is another legendary prefix, Human's does the same, but better.. ONLY when not mutated
---
I’m glad to see someone on my side about this. I think the items that you listed would be so cool
---
I scrapped an arm and get it for the helmet? Makes sense now I have to scrap a leg and get it for the chest and then scrap the chest and get it for the arms. My fault for not reading the whole message when it popped up, but saw BOS that was all I needed. When I got the polymer after scrapping combat I could apply it to my arms and legs was so stoked  this one I don’t understand...
---
They nice but I die a lot from enemies rushing me, explosive damage hurts players a lot more then enemy monsters.
---
So, you can actually do everything without the quest guidelines and you will get the rewards and the quest completion on your screen. I fiddled with it this morning and got it to work. Just have to do everything without it telling you to.
---
This should help a little
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_brewing_and_distilling
---
Not a problem m8. I get it. I’m also not arguing that PA isn’t the most viable build out there. 
---
I do play on the NA server. I’m not sure what server you are on. 
---
Again, you could be entirely correct in your assertion that laser rifles are OP, I simply haven’t seen it.
---
I love to make constructive criticism and I also like to be positive toward al ideas, but even I have just one word to say...
---
Naw.
---
How about using fireproof? I am using it it allows me to survive such stuff.
---
You’re quite possibly the dumbest person I’ve talked to on this sub.
---
You just admitted to not even having two of the best damage boosting perks in the entire game. Stupid as hell.
---
No it proves you wrong you fucking idiot. And it proves you have severe reading comprehension issues and that it’s not just my writing you can’t understand, but apparently you can’t understand what anyone writes.
---
Like I said, jump in that post and say this stupid shit so I can watch you get laughed out of there.
---
But you won’t, because you know you’re wrong, and you’re too embarrassed and don’t have the guts to admit it.
---
Hooooooly chrsit do you have a plan. I'd just be like "Me have good PA, me have good weapon, me have good heal heal, me pew pew and gain health, but me die awww, me alive again wee" XD.
---
If find that the pylons are really tricky, I find that if I become all three conduits at a time, my health drastically decreases and have to use Super stimpaks to counter it, but then again I don't run much in defence. But definitely I don't think there's anyway to reduce the damage taken from it, but some people say that the closer you are to the conduit the less damage taken, but I'm not so sure if that's true.
---
With taking less damage and keeping AP I'drecommend using some magazines(also alcohols and food, but I don't look to much into those or chems, tho using Nuka colas are great for AP, especially Quantum and Grape), because I know there are which are "Take less damage from robots", believe that's a Love Live issue (My stash is filled with nearly every type of Magazine except the Tumblers Today, I don't use them and when I used to go Watoga to try and get lucky and find a Plan for PA (Before the Plan update) they spawned every day (They don't spawn frequently at all now which is annoying, same for the bobble head(Also have a bunch of those). I know there can be good health regen( Astoundingly awesome tales has a magazine that gives 20 HP back every minute, which can be useful, Grognak the Barbarian issue can add 2+ Resistance, but that may not be worth it)  and damage redux magazines (The love live issue that means you receive 25% less damage from robots, Guns and bullets have a lot of good magazines, from doing more damage with weapons that don't have scopes,  better Heavy critical (but that may mean VATS), The unstobbales then is just chances to take less damage from X, and Tesla sceince has another take less damage from robots and Heavy weapons take less ammo consumption (Got no idea how that works tbh))
---
After I finish with my exams (woo 2 months of exams...) I plan to start selling all my magazines and bobbleheads (they're mostly explosive, ballistic, small guns, healing at what nought, I was going to do it earlier but Player Vending got pushed back so yeah there's that.
---
Also heeeeeeeeeell I've finally kitted out my T-51b PA, and oh my god it's just tickle damage in West Tek, purified water outpaces damage taken, p u r i f i e d   w a t e r. So hell T-51b with emergency protocols is great.
---
In luck I think there's a perk that gives a chance to automatically reload without having to do the animation, it doesn't trigger too often, but it sure can help time to time since you don't have 15% reload.
---
Also does serependipty work in PA? I used to have the perk on all the time, and it never triggered in PA (Shows that little animation on the side), but when not in PA (before my excavator days) the thing half the time went AWOL with dodging.
---
Oh you have a vats build too with your pistol lol. Same my pistol build meant to use vats but yea can't wait for legendary vendor as I hope it gives better options to get what we want.
---
Collecting outfits and things has kind of become part of my daily/endgame routine! I'm still missing a few things but I could always use more things to hunt for! And it's a fun way to make your character a little unique.
---
Sure, I totally believe that.
---
i got this stuttering too... soo anyoing i never ever had that since release (maybe some lagggs in the past but not this continuos stutters)
---
"You're weird and dumb".  
---
What is this? The 3rd Grade?
---
\+20 would be nice.
---
I might have to start doing that it seems fun
---
Wow fireproof stops explosive damage. Never knew that, Im going to have to try it out.
---
I've found all sorts of goodies sold to the traders. Bloodied 10mm Pistol / Hunting Rifle, two shots of all types.. But arguably my best weapon I've ever bought from the traders was a Bloodied LMG! With the Prime upgrade on it and using stuff like psycho, it does around 200+ damage per shot! It absolutely MELTS the SBQ and any Scorchbeast unlucky enough to anger me and make me take it out to kill them in literal seconds. You'd think the downside would be 'well gee, obviously you don't use it much because you have so little ammo' but think again! With ammo-smith I can make almost 100 rounds per craft and with super duper its around 170 per, and to top it all off i t only requires fluorescent flux which can be easily farmed at the Whitespring. Usually I care around 2k-3k rounds of the stuff incase the SBQ is being done multiple times.
---
Entirely possible. You get a gold star
---
I do agree
---
Yeah I wanted it and I might regret not grabbing it later but I am 99% of the time never in power armor unless I \*have\* to and when I do it's X01 because I just like that alien look it has?
---
If anyone on Xbox find the BOS arm plan can they please trade it for my BOS chest plan?
---
I've thought about this and would love it but it would be way too exploitable.
---
Imagine taking a low level into a silo with you, give them a keycard, and the code and then let them launch on Whitesprings.
---
Boom!
---
10+ level 100+ players annihilate all the glowing ones in thirty seconds and the low level player skyrockets in level by doing basically zero work. 
---
That's unbalanced. 
---
And experience is available all over the game. So experience isn't really the issue I have as a character at 150. 
---
What pisses me off about nuke zones is I put in the work.  I launch the nuke. Then everyone in the server benefits more off the nuke than I do. 
---
They get all the kills, legendaries, and nuke zone items leaving me to collect flowers. 
---
Not all the time but sometimes this happens. 
---
And i hate feeling like I wasted 10-15 minutes fighting a cargo bot for a keycard (I'm a melee build), and then another 20 minutes to run a silo when there's a possibility of me to end up with nothing except the shitty reward of a couple missiles from the Silo mission. 
---
I would much rather be able to LOOT all of the killed glowing ones than get the experience. 
---
Again,  that's exploitable to.
---
What makes it worth so much it's just double damage only if target is at full hp. the extra swing speed enchantment is unnecessary.
---
im a good noodle
---
I took over all 3 power stations last weekend for most of the day and didn’t have one person bother me, and o fully expected it &amp; prepared for it. I did find a fairly empty server to do it, but after a while, it filled up. I just kept jumping back and forth between workshops. It’s part of the game 🤷‍♀️
---
I have a feeling we're in different time zones, I'll be off work at 9 EST
---
Well, compatibility mode's a good place to start with that.
---
Glad you liked it.
---
Tested it at first at the ammo dump (explosive rounds on turrets).
---
The best noodle
---
Bethesda: No.
---
How do I even finish that quest? It's just been sitting there even though I have farmed the Whitesprings so much?
---
I'd like them to make the new-to-series weapons first, like the 50cal and the Gat Gun, and the LMG especially.
---
I love these ones.
---
(https://bethesda.net/community/topic/337561/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-april-23-2019) 
---
We will not know the fixes till tomorrow though :(
---
Nope, I even restarted
---
Mutants need a bigger head.
---
No you cannot get BOS paint for limbs/chest via scrapping. They are only available as very rare plans.
---
What does me not having the best perks have to do with this?
---
And wait. 😂 If those perks aren't multiplicative, how are they the best? Dumbass. 
---
We're talking about Slugger being additive. It isn't, and the comment you linked literally agrees with that. It's not a general damage perk.
---
In addition to the locations he listed, Poseidon is a great place to gather shells. There's probably 100+ scorched in the area if you clean out the whole area. Roughly 1/3 of them will be carrying shotguns and typically have 6-10 rounds each. 
---
Also, the vast majority of the level 16-30 mole miners in the ash heap area carry shotguns, so just wander around Welch, Beckley, etc and kill them all using some other weapon that you have extra ammo for.
---
I don't believe you there is no constructive criticism on reddit
---
The swing speed definitely comes up in farming situations
---
I literally conceded that I may be wrong about no effects being multiplicative. Are you serious?
---
But yes, the Super Sledge has the highest potential. I was trying to not involve others because that's immature, but now you're just about to humiliate yourself.
---
Yea it was crazy how broken it still was coming out of beta
---
It was doing that a lot to me in the bog. Started after the last update.
---
I think they called it checkered suit.
---
Bloody mess is multiplicative, it’s just additive with all other multiplicative perks.
---
It does stack with it. What I do is make stims, then diluted stims.  You end up with a lot more.
---
Me, too... pretty sure it only started with the most recent patch; don't remember seeing this before.
---
I've got an alt that I'm trying to play without weight reduction and combat perks, a park ranger. Long story short it's a fucking hassle. The game was meant to be a hunter/gatherer simulation
---
That's true.
---
So you're just going to ignore the part where Slugger was shown to be multiplicative? 😂 ok
---
Don't be silly
---
Crappy legendary Light Armour pieces from the Queen. It's great.
---
I’d like to come by for a look.  Certainly interested
---
It was not shown to be multiplicative, you misunderstood his writing.
---
What console does everyone play on I’m on PS4 and I’m down to launch a nuke any day of the week! My PS4 gamer tag is CrazyBurrito3000
---
;)
---
I don't do conduits because I barely have any stims, along with my character having a grand total of 3 endurance.
---
I seem to have the most problem with this in the forest general area - don't see it too much outside of it but it is really annoying.
---
When they snap and write their own post about how they're leaving Fallout 76 because they couldn't take it any more.
---
Sweet!  Thanks for this tool!
---
"doorbell"???
---
&gt; Stacks **additively with other sources of general damage** (Bloody Mess, Adrenaline etc). **Multiplicatively with everything else.** Should apply to all outgoing damage.
---
I'll add you when I get on later
---
Please let this have the fix for gear modding.
---
The thing is, I purposefully put my camp in a location without enemies because I don’t want to be attacked. I’ll move my camp to a cool location and like it and be fine for a day then the next day, bam 4 scorchbeasts arrive and destroy my camp.
---
Just make sure to use the wiki guide.
---
This is ok as long as you are with a team that understands this. If not, you're not contributing and shouldn't do event.
---
How long did you spend kicking Deathclaw ass?
---
&gt; It does sound like you aren't fully understanding it though. Based on your 2nd paragraph, likeness doesn't mean the letters are in the correct spot, just that there is that many correct letters in what you selected.
---
The letters have to be in the same position in both words for it to show up as a likeness. For example, SAND and NADS would have only have a likeness of 1, despite having all 4 letters in common.
---
You mean a normal Vault 76 suit?
---
Agreed; I've noticed it anywhere that offers a distant view.  Smaller, more closed environments - even outdoors - have been okay.  As soon as the view opens up, the textures are botched.
---
I've been wondering how it gets exploited in PVP...  Seems it would be really easy to pick up someone's movement.
---
I don't believe you can get the checkered shirt and slacks if that's what you're thinking of but I know you can get the flannel shirt and jeans in 76 but it's definitely more tattered and worn looking than the checkered.
---
Well, it is Deathclaw Island, not Deathclaws Island.
---
Is this real?
---
Couldn’t really remembered what he looked like becuase I blew his head to pieces right after I met him
---
Solo player here, can confirm, silos look both too hard and too long. I derp around the map exploring and have no patience for grinding materials or for long missions. Basically, I play FO76 like it was FO4. 
---
This probably means the game is going to end for me sooner or later, but that is OK, I will have enjoyed it.
---
I try clearing adds to the best of my Supressor's Lever Action, and slapping the shit out of the impostor. I don't get the mentality of "if you can't do much, just leave" when there isn't a limit on how many people can join an event.
---
Don't listen to that dude. The letters have to be in the same position to show up as a match. Like the other reply said, the system has been the same since FO3.
---
If Destiny taught me anything, it’s that this will never stop being a thing.
---
BoS does make sense though, satellite communication, in fact this game indirectly explains why the BoS are so isolated in their first encounters. They tried to reach out to other military groups but those groups fell, so they feel they must isolate themselves.
---
I believe it
---
I don't really know about the Chinese ones, but the rest seem good. Maybe we could do some Enclave quests too?
---
The plans for things that they already gave you are the ones I hate most.  They base plans shouldn't even be exist... much like plans for the chemistry bench.
---
Food still costs too much budget but we are complaining about lights?
---
Psn is the same as u/ I'll be on in about 10
---
You should be able to spend a perk point and save a card until you reach the skill you need.
---
I farmed a certain few areas with a couple of three stars. We got a few three stars. They're usually melees though.
---
How do you define endgame enemies? I mean, if they land, I can tear through a scorchbeast in a few punches, but I regular drop them with my AA western before they ever land. Robots, ghouls, scorched, and maybe super muties make up the bulk of mobs in end game dungeons, and those are all easy enough to kill with pistols. Just because there *are* weapons/builds that can hit 4 digit damage values doesn't mean you weapons need to do that much damage to be viable.
---
You can craft it literally on a armor bench.
---
Thanks so much. Where's Bolton Greens at though?
---
Just kill unruly golfers if you can ever find them
---
That is the point, they will spend time to work on that but not fix the bigger issues.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
You’re complaining about dumbass, pointless posts when this is one? How does that work?
---
They could buff the "Mutant Slayer's" prefix instead. Have Mutant Slayer's weapons do increased damage against mutated players and armor reduce damage taken from mutated players.
---
Eh well, agree to disagree. It makes no sense for them to be all the way in WV so early in their existence. Bethesda wanted to reuse their most recognizable factions and enemies such as the BoS and Super Mutants instead of creating new ones, and did their best to explain it.
---
perfect! Thanks
---
I think the best place for Brain fungus would be the wendigo cave - not sure about the firecap!
---
I don't think so since they are both primary slot effects
---
brain fungus is easy is a ton by the service entrace at whitesrpings the firecaps are a little rarer a few patched around the overseers camp area
---
Yes that's the one. It's really pre-war and clean and would go really well with the hunting caps you can get. It's a shame that you can't get it then, but thanks for the info.
---
You can only craft it with the plan but normaly you can find it pretty fast
---
I had a friend show me how to use the conduit piping. Set down a coffee table first, the set one of the pipes on top of that, then attach the rest of the pipes (there are curved ones too).  Then move the coffee table and original pipe, scrap the coffee table and attach that pipe piece to the others. Viola!  I was so excited when he showed me that!
---
General damage is perks that generally boost all sources of damage, slugger does not do this, slugger boosts a specific damage, that being two handed weapons.
---
Felt cute, might leave this up to continue to somehow piss y'all off idk
---
If like further specialization. Give me a perk for 100% energy weapon damage, - 75% ballistic
---
Also. Energy weapons still Need their damage buff. 
---
And vice versa.
---
I don't think that's it but I'll google an image right quick. Thanks
---
So you’re complaining about complaining people?
---
What purpose does this serve?
---
Oh shit it's mother fucking Frosted Flakes! I remember when I had to kill Raisin Bran the first time!
---
Maybe they are? Idk. I appreciate the coming Donni Darko reference’s tho.
---
Yes, reread what I quoted ^
---
Then did you mean to say the camp owner can't destroy their own things?
---
Yeah, hopefully good with salt will help me to keep these from spoiling too fast. Thanks for reminding me about the cave though
---
No the elevator to go see rose
---
My group made three launches from Charlie yesterday with no issues.  Didn't use the others, so I don't know about them.
---
The same purpose that people announcing their departure does, probably
---
Might have been fixed unintentionally .. no one really knows, but would of been cool if it stayed for sure.
---
I just saw two land in the same server last night what are y'all on about?
---
 I live not too far from a Fissure and they leave me alone because of my tree cover. There are thousands of spots where Scorchbeasts will seldom attack you, pick one and quit whining. ;)
---
What did they do?
---
Unite attachments\*
---
Awww yes.  Home sweet home!  Enjoy watching him leisure around the island, while sitting on the dock, playing the guitar.  Kinda glad, he can't swim across the island and snoop me, in my sleep.
---
That downvote on my comment pretty much someone else is the one pissed off. Be more subtle next time, cutie.
---
I guess I only need to find 50 Firecap. Hopefully its not too hard to find. (Kinda forgot about green thumb)
---
It's sad I'm either forced to use majority of my budget doing essential stuff like defenses/house walls well there goes 1/2 my budget now comes food/water that's not counting work benches I must place to have full functionally of my camp.
---
In theory wood armor is supposed to make you undetectable to scorched.
---
I meant using a pistol without any perks to increase its dmg is not that good of a main weapon.
---
And i have a pistol build so i know that they are great weapons even in sbq fights
---
I'm sure i've been making plenty of people at Watoga Station happy between dropping plans in the blue suitcase and selling legendaries I won't use, but it gets old really quick.
---
Idk man y'all all seem to feel like it's necessary to tell me how unnecessary my post is when your comments are just as unnecessary so
---
Thank you.  This is what I was looking for.
---
You just need to level up more, I spent a long time in the middle and south of the map near Flatwoods, lots of fun to be had, .. make sure your build is decent .. don't rush it, only go the high level areas when you ready, you will have more fun this way.
---

---
? I thought you came with it I guess I played this game longer I thought.
---
Near Slocum Joe’s there’s a lot of firecap. Make sure your green thumb perk is on
---
The issue is pathing and placement. For the creature to suddenly spawn out of the egg in a camp where people can put them anywhere leaves way too many variables. I know we can have pets, I have a Mirelurk King but I've had almost all of them and the mega sloths still regularly spawn into foundations and just die. So there are issues.
---
Got a berserker's the other night.....
---
Tell me the name if you come back.
---
Wow, you even edited that on the main post. I didn’t intend to get you this salty, man, I apologize.
---
My friend has had all these problems on his xbox.  Mine has been ok so far.  But ... yeah.
---
And i never said that it has to hit thousands of dmg
---
Don't ever expect anything to make sense or be useful. There was no thought process given to any system.
---
Not really
---
Hopefully my randomly disappearing items return to my stash
---
Early launch when low level that thing harassed me every time I went there. Now it never spawns. :| Freak show was nothing but Mirelurks, toads, wolves and rads after tons of resets. Mountain Cabin had 3 right away, then three server hops for the other two, so thanks OP.
---
Would be cool if dailies didn't require server hopping to complete, or playing 24 hours straight and getting lucky, but this is the world we live in.
---
I had to remove a lot of my crops. At least the one prior patch did help with the budget some.
---
Well, that's all the proof I need...
---
I trade on it often and never have problems, I often look for people trying to buy serums and just give them away. Not all people are bad and untrustworthy. Just try to protect yourself by not doing 0c for 0c trades unless the poster goes first and you've done everything possible to verify the item is correct.
---
High chrome graphics. IN THE FUTURE everything's chrome.

Every day, that's what I do. Laser rifles and automatic rifles.

It's SE of Morgantown. In this screenshot, the player is standing at the crazy cat lady house, and Bolton Greens is just south of him where the blue and white some shaped billboard is located.

---
Damn this is still going on... You know, I hate it but I haven't touched the game in over month because of this shit here. I want to play, I do but it's just so disheartening.
---
There is no need. Like I said ask around and find out since you won’t listen to anything I say no matter how right I am.
---
No problem - good luck on your hunt!
---
Attacking people that have legitimate issues with the game and voice them is pointless, and it makes Bethesda’s job in regards to listening to the community harder.
---
Is this a troll post?
---
I mean it IS my post so i can edit it to add whatever i want. your apology isn't accepted considering you're just trolling
---
True that. I thought about it, and its final. Without friends or Reddit market. This game is horrible. Ive spent 230h on a game that doesnt run more than 20fps lol it hurts my eyes and i got used to it
---
Lumberjack outfit?
---
I agree. I would do some exploring, go the White springs for easy leveling. 
---
Try to scrap all weapons and armor you won't use. This will help learning plans to mod them for better damage and protection .
---
even if he didn't walk around I was really hoping for a little sleeping Deathclaw in a little pet bed.
---
XB1, lvl58 - I hope this doesn't come across wrong, but what you are describing (i.e. exiting the game, and then quitting out of the game) is what I have been doing since the BETA.  Now especially after your input, I am glad I adopted and retained that habit.  Not all habits are bad!  ;-)
---
You propably found the plan as fast as me I played 2 hours and had it then because it is not rare
---
Indeed.
---
XspacerX77 0 caps
---
It wasn’t an actual apology. You’re not very bright.
---
Yeah I feel like there's a lot of outfits they're holding out on us but hopefully they'll release them down the line.
---
Devs should have used FO4's system but simply limited the amount of SPECIAL stats that we could get, thus making us still have to choose what build we wanted, but not have to swap perk cards for shit like crafting and lockpicking.
---
no, they're both primary mods. and the chameleon mod &gt; mutation. if memory serves, the mutation also makes you visible while shooting.
---
I mean a post voicing issues about the game is one thing cause a lot of bugs have been fixed that way. Announcing your departure doesn't do anything except be an eye sore
---
All the main quests lead through the Whitesprings/Pleasant Valley area, which has no level cap and typically high level players nearby scaling up the enemies.
---
I'd recommend taking a break from the main quests, at least until you find yourself on an empty server. Explore the Toxic Valley and Ash Heap, join any events you find. The Sheepsquatch-related quests added in the last patch mostly lead to level-capped areas, so that helps.
---
This is incredible
---
Put some cards into melee? When I started leaning towards melee weapons I started having more fun. No more worrying about ammo, and melee can do some real damage too. Just explore places you haven been and level up some more. Once you get above level 50 the game gets way easier.
---
How about we just treat them like the things they are supposed to be cards.  Don't level them up, just stack them with a limit to match the current upgrade system. 
---
While we are making them cards, let's make them tradeable.  It feels back to open yet another pack to get duplicates of things you have a maximum for, or worse cards that don't even upgrade (I'm looking at you lock picking)
---
That would also be a cool idea, like a special scope on like a gauss rifle. Or like a huge magazine on the handmade rifle. That seems cool
---
I already knew that, apparently you can't tell when someone is being sarcastic back? Yikes
---
True and hopefully the rainbow effect can be resolved. Thanks for the info.
---
+Karma
---
I would recommend searching for some raider power armor as well which might help you out.
---
I’m sure you did, buddy. Kudos for the “no u” type of reply.
---
That's weird i wasnt able to craft it on an armor workbench.
---
The FEV at West Tek was neutralized, it's inert, so that's not going to work.
---
I did but go off i guess
---
Make one! Do it, that's a great idea!
---
I really want a handband.
---
yea thats gonna be touch even with green thumb i might come away with about 14 firecaps at best they just don't spawn like other plants
---
I have never seen that list, and it's awesome.  Thank you!
---
Sometimes moving towards it does not fix it. But, what I did notice was that even with server hopping, it remains an issue on that particular server. Was farming technical data recently and noticed it happening so I'd check to see what other players were on the server/area and it was the same players I had noticed a few hops ago.
---
X's and z's in username. Im convinced
---
Was suppose to trade my uny-cav set for a BE laser. I offered to put up 3/5 items. And he kept begging me to pur up onky the arms. And he wldnt even show me proof he owned a BE laser, claimed it was on another profile....i didnt g wtf scammed but he tried like hell to make me cave
---
Any vault suit really i could take any as long as its a vault suit.
---
Sorry to say this but I think you're going to be disappointed.
---
If you have quests that take you to the savage divide or east side of the map you should just ignore them for now. There's plenty to do and explore in the the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap to keep you occupied until you hit level 40 or so and can survive an encounter with a level 50 gutsy or super mutant.
---
As for crafting tips, the best general one is to find enemies that use your preferred weapon type, kill them, and scrap their weapons until you've unlocked all the mods. Scorched carry rifles, 10mm pistols, and pump shottys. Mole Miners carry pump and combat shotguns as well as the occasional missile launcher and assault rifle. Super mutants almost always carry automatic weapons of some sort, low levels will have auto pipe rifles, mid tier guys will have laser rifles, and the meanest of the bunch usually carry miniguns.
---
I don’t know what that is but it sounds cool 👍
---
See, that's what I thought, but others are saying it's not that way, which is why Waters and Winner would have a Likeness of 1 with each other, that 1 being the W.
---
It's just weird, is all, LoL.
---
I wonder how many duplicates of non upgradable cards we all have sitting around.  Like pick lock, hacker, ect...
---
West-Tek, RobCo, Nuked WS/Burrows, Uranium Fever, Steakhouse, Watoga... Those are the best places that come to mind.
---
Actually I want 10 missiles 5 outside 5 inside to cover from spawns/high levels. 8 crops each except 3 carrots/blk berry/gourd/melon. I had to reduce them to 4 crops due to this very limited budget. I couldn't place decorations except a couple posters. If I made a item though I would make a improvised air conditioner that provides a small yet lasting buff when indoors then lasts for 35 min.
---
Yup. My camp is near there. It's always the same lonely Deathclaw on that island. Every time I login and pass by he gives me the ol "hello neighbor" wave and I do the same by blowing his head off with my legendary scoped lever action explosive rifle.
---
How is the plan obtained again?
---
Shiny and chrome...
---
Witness me.
---
Again I think you have to earn it it's just that I played so long I thought you came with it.
---
Maybe ill just hop around in the forest until find some then. I see them on trees fairly regular. But its not really a distinguisable location. Just around.
---
26 minutes-ish.
---
I did a whole lvl on this toon (from 125 to 126).
---
The lvl 91 glowing ones give some really nice exp :)

Hallelujah.

Gee, now I'm sad.

I agree.   I figured they would of had merchandise or something.
---
I want the service rifle so bad and could have the Chinese assault rifle as well.  Add in a couple of weapons that use the 7.62 rounds.  Bigger punch but harder to control and degrade faster (Even though you can toss an AK into anything and it will still go)
---
Its likely that I consistently play this game for years.
---
In every one of those cases, those people have voiced their opinions already and provided legitimate criticisms and suggestions, and it was either ignored or suppressed, and they were tired of it.

Being a rabid super fan and saying everybody but yourself sucks is exactly what the subreddit doesn’t need.

What is the purpose of this post, other than to reveal your superiority complex?

yea i found them in the campsite during the mystery meat side quest 
---
so assuming the Sheepsquatch has a ranged quill attack 
---
and still no sitings yet?
---
It's like he got caught in some driving infraction and had his license suspended and is now asking for the money he spent at the DMV back
---
You have to find the plan inside some buildings at the beginning ( Morgantown, Faltwoods,etc.)
---
Lol I literally don't have a superiority complex but go off i guess
---
Personally I'm glad they fixed this. I think it was because that Nuka lamp is coming eventually, and this was never intended. I love the string lights but the Nuka Cola logo (when you have several of them close together) just looked like crap on my walls. It was all bunched up in a corner and illegible.
---
27 total to show in your brewing selection, for those not willing to click.  It’s 10/??/??/2.  Can’t recall the middle two without looking to be 100% sure.  I think it’s 9/6 (6 being the 2 each lead and tequila, White Russian, and hard lemonade).
---
BIv will not teach you hard lemonade.
---
You don't have to rush the game the game naturally levels itself. Keep doing flatwoods events then move on to the graftion after level 30-35 ash is 40s red zone you should have 70 with power armor till you have a feeled out build where you can function without power armor it helps a lot though.
---
I was singing this on repeat when writing this post! Maybe we need a Wendigo to step in for Shia?!
---
Ok i'll send you a friend request.
---
Anarcho-capitalism is a concept and many punks endorse the philosophy. I really think you are painting punk rock with a personal bias here.
---
No problem. I've gotten a lot of use out of it myself.
---
On PC, I can give you a Shielded one (best there is) for free. IGN: jchamlin
---
Lol and see I’m new to this site. Long time lurker though but I see ALOT of that. Kids hear a rumor and run with it
---
They go around your CAMP device, so move it somewhere they won't die.
---
Great time to test PS4 Remote Play to download the update.  Now I just gotta remember to leave my console on tomorrow morning. :|
---
Gotta do what makes most sense for yourself, no harm in that ever. Might be worth coming back in a year or something. Keep up with the updates and see when you want to have another look. After all, not going to cost anything.
---
Honestly, I wish I had the option to take Glory as a companion instead of Deacon. A badass minigun wielding synth lady? Hell yes.
---
Why not create Deathclaw Park?
---
I will agree with this. I did look like garbage if you tried to use a bunch. But it was a unique touch that a lot of people liked and didn’t expect at first. Maybe add it as an option later? But I’m sure we would have to pay for it. 
---
On a side note also I didn’t see that listed in any patch notes. But I don’t expect them to list every change.
---
Nice! STD free? I don’t need anything that I can wipe away with a good ole shot. This games twitchy enough as it is
---
If you wanna get serious about Lead, take your Excavator Armor to Lucky Hole Mine. Clearing the whole place takes like 15 mins (even less once you know the layout) and you'll have enough Lead Ore to smelt into like 800+ Lead Scrap. It's also the most efficient smelting recipe around (well, tied with Steel) so even though it takes a lotta Acid, you can just slowly work through the pile of Ore as needed (because it weighs less un-smelted). There's also some Crystal down there if you're interested, but if not just ignore it and ditch what you accidentally mine because it'll be a waste of acid.
---
Tag Acid for searching (keep an eye out for Abraxo, it's plentiful) and hit the Mine whenever you run out of ore. If you're hard up for Acid grab the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop up north, but I recommend just putting your Camp on an Acid spot instead.
---
&gt; The people who post about leaving are the first ones to come back

This. Once in a while I look at the post history of these folks and quite a few times I've seen MULTIPLE "I'm quitting" posts with varying lengths of time between.

pvp is the end game..
---
Ok thanks i'll send you a friend request my username is skewb.
---
Looks like one yeah.  I think they released something called the lumberjack outfit a while ago but I can't remember what it looks like. I'm talking about the checkered shirt &amp; slacks from fallout 4 and wondered if it was in 76.
---
How did you do that? I just updated windows and since then I’ve been having this problem!
---
Wood armor is good on stealth builds. Not best in slot because of the limit to 1-star but with a few wood pieces with the shrouded mod wood gives stealth and speed while crouching buffs that are pretty nice.
---
So it won’t be a “ I have 50 tokens I’d like this item please” it’s more of a “ Iv got 50 tokens let’s hope this slot machine gives me something worth a shit”
---
Your items now break 50% faster and food spoils 25% faster.
---
Honestly?
---
If you're looking for conversation, then I get it.
---
But I suggest you just... play it. Then come back after a few hours to talk about it, if you want. Just... go play it.
---
I HAVE AN OPINION MOM
---
I will try to find the plan for you :)
---
Nah.. but being able to communicate at a level higher than "monkey" is a pretty handy skill to have.
---
I just wish it had 2- and 3-star affixes. Then Wood arms and chest with leather legs would be amazing.
---
That ain’t happenin anytime soon pal trust me.
---
Uh, multiboxing doesn't require the use of any hardware or software to do. It is built right into the base game.
---
WITNESS ME BROTHERS
---
For real though, I love the chrome finish on the PAs, it's refreshing and ties in with the timeline
---
Yeah it's called the checkered shirt &amp; slacks. It's less of a suit and more just a T-shirt that's red and white checkered and some light brown pants. It's one of my favorite outfits from fallout 4 and wondered if it was in 76.
---
I’m usually not on until later evenings mountain time.  I will add you though and join sometime you are on.
---
I think it's the best first armor imo it's lightweight has a 2 strength 1 luck 1 endurance final form. Plus it allows for more armor.
---
Yes. I know. Unfortunately my mega sloth, despite my best efforts to keep my device away from the foundations, still spawned in dead. I've lost four of them to that issue, but mirelurks and deathclaws have few problems. Aside from the fact that the deathclaw roar slightly damages my own stuff.
---
when you see "checkpointed"
---
Good news a moderator stated this week we would see the fix to that bug. Linked it to the post where they replied to.

Combat armor helmet has a BoS skin, purely cosmetic
---
Looks like a gambling suit though.
---
None of those links say anything about duping. Seems you keep missing that point. You can keep sharing random links, but those links do not say anywhere that he duped.
---
Thank you, so if i don't see it then i need to finish it?
---
Thanks for the help! Didn't expect so many replies so quick. Great tips. Some of which are pretty obvious that I never even thought about. See you out there!
---
You on PC man? I have a few alts in the 15-30 range I wouldn't mind leveling up. I can show ya the way. Level 345 main with a lvl 100 mule, lvl 92 alt account character, and 500+ hours played.
---
Sounds good. I will see you when I see you 👍
---
Somewhat unrelated, but they really need to turn the volume down on the ASAM missile launches. It's literally deafening.
---
I downvoted because this is a lame post that adds absolutely nothing of value to this sub. At least people that post about leaving usually have some sort of feedback as to why they won’t be playing anymore.
---
Grahm’s exciting because he’s so random and wandering. If he set up shop with all of the other vendors, the world would lose that bit of charm he brings to it. :)
---
Also the Camera will be added, all camera related challenges disappear.
---
You guys still haven’t learned your lesson by releasing late patch notes?
---
It’s a good game in my opinion. It just gets a little tedious like any other rpg game when you become overly powerful. The game is still in development. Bethesda said that all the DLCs will be free, so there’s that. Pvp is kind of fun. It just depends on the opposing person and if you want a challenge or not.
---
Syringer is actually fucking awesome.  Been using that to kill a few sentinel builds, plus it's funny as hell when they get hit.
---
What are you saying? So he didn’t actually rip you off and you ended up not trading? I
---
Yeah we stuck to Whitesprings, Westek, and Watoga. Of course Uranium Fever when it's available.
---
For that specific quest you can just go straight to glassed Cavern to search for Taggerdy there. So i would recommend not redoing it all, just skip to the end.
---
Yeah there's a handful of scorched that hang out at the winding path. Must be left over incense heads from when it was a commune.
---
First thing I though when I started reading your post :) nice work by the way
---
lol that's future content, vault raids come in during the Summer
---
Yes, better inventory. It's great.
---
No it is literally about the shit UI, lack of trading area, and horrible cap limit.
---
Duping actually doesn't kill ingame economies. Diablo 2 is an absolute prime example of that, they had public dupes multiple times on d2 and yet they still have an active trading community, and during their heyday they literally created the largest online game trading site on the internet with d2jsp.
---
I have a 3* that's an anti armor one.  Handmade still outshines it though.
---
I mean, the patch hasnt gone out yet, Im not expecting them to release patch notes until the patch is in progress or finished.
---
Pretty lights
---
Awww vault raiding.... I wanted to live in a porta room with limited space or a alliance thing.
---
Although the mutant version isn't the best, the pole hook is actually a pretty sweet weapon. Damage is the same as a sledgehammer, plus it can be modded to ignore a chunk of armor. It also doesnt make your screen bob as much when you swing it, and I could swear it has a slightly further range than any other melee weapon. Been using my instigating swing speed p0le hook for a very long time and it it never let me down.
---
I have an AA aiming amp Lever action .... I don't use cause I'm not a rifle build ... A Ghoulslayers Submachine gun with Expl. I don't use cause its useless ... My best is a Mutantslayers powerfist with speed bonus and an Instigating Gat with Expl. Nothing *** that is has any value.  For Armour, I'm currently wearing some leather and lower level trapper wear because of the carrying bonuses ... my best/strongest armour is all ** 
---
The best gun I have .... The Fixer ... Zero stars.
---
WHY IS IT A THING WHERE PEOPLE CROUCH STEALTH NEXT TO A PYLON!?  Every time I jump in this event I see that.
---
He'd be way better off make Nuka Quantum Grenades 🤦 what a waste of Quantum
---
No, but I've made like 200+ Quantum Grenades 🤣
---
Orrrr. We could look up the ending to said quests to end them quickly.
---
Maybe they think that's how you take the pylon?
---
They are either dumb on accident or dumb on purpose.
---
Awesome, I need that!
---
This, I love my two shot explosive laser rifle.  Bad thing is I also have a quad ultracite explosive laser rifle and it seems to have not been touched when they fixed the laser rifles.  The dmg is considerably lower than my  two shot explosive.
---
&gt; The country could be nuked in the next ten minutes.
---
We've been preparing our whole lives for this boys!
---
Well anything without the damage perks isn't going to be a great main weapon. But if I had to pick a weapon to use without the damage perks, it's probably going to be pistols, because they get a lot out of vats and crits even without the gunslinger perks.
---
I'm not afraid of random invites, I just have no interest in joining a team with random people with no explanation as to why they are inviting.
---
Along with a keyring it would be cool to have a notebook that keeps all that in order. I think resident evil had something like that for notes found.
---
1*? I killed three 3* on sat that didnt even drop legends.  They all had grenade launchers and .44s and frags.  But no starred items. Was running buildings in bog.
---
That's nice. I don't care
---
No, the majority of us are sick of shit like this:

Anger. Rage. Foaming at the mouth. That’s what kills communities.
---
I have a offer for 1k
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Oddly enough the feature you want is already implemented into the claimable workshops
---
I agree. That was something really cool about FO:NV, and something I also had appreciated about The Fixer. 
---
Yet, I can't help but think the reason they've not bothered, is indeed due to the Atomic Shop and not wanting to take away potential means of revenue.
---
Not that they couldn't both, easily, coexist. Would simply mean that the Atomic Shop skins would have to be *that much* better than the ones in game.
---
Yeah but you can't mod any other super sledge with a concrete rocket can you? All though, I do wish we had more guns like the Deliverer which was my favorite gun in FO4. It just felt really cool to use.
---
Crickets spawn when there’s no ghouls ,if you see ghouls seeever hop
---
Yeah, I posted this awhile back. You know, before I felt this way. Opinions can change. Creepy that you decided to go allllll the way back like that 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
If it's just venTing then you shouldn't care how a bunch of sarcastic grammar police respond.
---
To be fair I never said I was done with the game, just done with the sub whole people were complaing about pay2win stuff - I’m back now though :)
---
Should have bought anthem if you need confirmation before playing.
---
How did you stack the razorgrain?
---
They don't drop as explosive (no energy weapons do anymore) and teslas have higher duration than laser rifles apprently - I wouldn't get rid of mine tbh
---
Prob changed it cause so far all super mutants have sounded similar and they mabey thought the voice lines worked better with a more stubborn sounding voice
---
Finally I can stop farming gauntlets and just slap on a third claw 😭
---
Good Idea!
---
Kill mole miners in the Ash Heap? Most of their stiff acraps into black titanium.
---
My camp sits at this spot and it's served me quite well for some time now. Not only do you get the three radscorps, honeybeasts, or yao gaui, but this spot also has:
---
Raider power armor
---
Two bobbleheads
---
A stealth boy
---
Ranger's outfit
---
Crossbow
---
Various ammo
---
Various food and drink
---
Radaway or addictol
---
Screws
---
Two or three mods
---
A random melee weapon (sometimes a max level super sledge or shiskebab)
---
Plenty of wood piles
---
Plenty of leather
---
And I also have cargobots flying over on an almost regular basis, making getting those keycards so much more convenient.
---
tl;dr: Middle Mountain Cabins is a great spot.
---
I’m there too man.  I perked up to 5 on Demo Expert due to my explosive double barrel and then the nerf hit and I’m stuck.  I can’t pull it but probably only need it at 3.  Same thing with Adrenaline and Gunsmith.  I have both maxed out at 5 but probably only need both at 3. 
---
It sucks as I’ve had to rebuild another perk profile to adjust for the explosive nerf and nuke adjusted with auto rifle build.  If they nerf that now I’m fucked.  As it is I’ve probably pissed away 25-30 levels just switching shit around.
---
Oh, I'd be pissed..
---
This.  Sometimes I choose the wrong person on the map when asking my brother to join the team.  Only once has someone accepted the invite.  I had to immediately kick them out.  It's great they OP is trying to be friendly, but for the most part, people are trying to dupe others into joining a team only to get them killed.
---
If it was creepy, peoples post history wouldn’t available to the public.
---
I want a Deathclaw Island to have more deathclaws. Like Fo3's Deathclaw Sanctuary.
---
+karma your welcome :)
---
Knowing Bethesda, they will grant ur request by giving us 3* wood armor with nocturnal...Been playing since launch and have yet to have a TSE weapon or a single piece of sentinel armor drop. This is bullshit.
---
Thanks guys. I’ll message you later then if I still don’t have one
---
Or you may fast travel to my base and clear out my water purifiers.
---
Im not a racist not callin u a monkey
---
Nah definitely creepy. Obviously he was looking for something in an attempt to discredit my post. Kinda failed, cause ya know, opinions can change. And I'm not afraid to admit how dumb that post is 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Tse Tesla is just a shotgun using cells, not very useful but value will go up as you can't drop it anymore.
---
nah. there is NO point to not have any mutations. give us the Human's Prefix
---
Okay!

---
I  just joined your server, but now you are showing as offline.
---
I'm gonna say they take the Monkeys paw route and make them predominately drop 0* items. Specifically pipe pistols and canes.
---
Me, a level 45 intellectual: Glad for any legendary drops I can get
---
Just take your time.  You are meant to just explore, build, scavenge... just generally do your own thing.  Many sidequests are found exploring random places.  Also do open event missions you are able to do.  The farmhands and wolf horde are two of thr possible ones you can do at flatwoods.  You can also try world hopping until one of the world has the event you want.  There is no real reason to rush leveling and progressing through the main storyline.  Building, cooking and ect also gives exp, but not a whole lot though.  I think discovering new locations also give exp.
---
Thanks guys that’s what I thought.
---
But hey we got more stupid shit added to the atom shop!  Time to celebrate good times cmon!  
---
Makes you wonder if Bethesda is asleep at the wheel.  For higher level players like me this perk limit and structure and inability to break up multiples or respec is ridiculous.
---
Huh?
---
You know what I would love, for people to stop complaining about 3 star Legendary creatures stop dropping 1 star items.
---
WE KNOW.
---
that is awesome.  even though he is the asshole who killed my wife/husband
---
Now you know how everyone else feels about your opinion on this. Good job!
---
In my case, I had to manually close Fallout and reopen it in order for the Atomic Shop to update with the new egg daily.
---
The changeover from one egg to another might have been while you were on.  You would have had to close the game, then reopen it to see the new egg.
---
Hmm maybe one of the vaults could have something with this. Like the experiment is that you could get as many robotic upgrades you want, and something turned them insane.
---
Only a racist would think "monkey" was a racist term.
---
Idk man the 43 upvotes seem to say something else. Y'all just want to complain about me complaining for some reason lol
---
ACtually it does make sense. One of the first things an army is told is the importance of communication. So it makes sense that the BoS would reach out to any and all military forces they can contact via radio and satellite, any connections they have anywhere to grow a web of communication.   
---
Militaries know that the more info you have the better the BoS is no different. And in the start they did have the resources for that, but as those resources dried up well things went dark and they went dark fast. Isolation does a lot to the mind.
---
I like this idea a lot and would love to see it become a thing, I also sort of envision it kind of like the outfit system in ESO but closer to how you could change Appearance in The Sims with mix’n’match theme.
---
If this becomes a feature and the battlecoat gets released, I’m definitely putting that over smart looking shirt and slacks
---
wendigo cave is good and also the underground road outside Watoga
---
Welcome to the fucking clube mate, you want your members only jacket? To this day I feel like it's a total myth that she is supposed to drop legendaries.
---
People that announce they are leaving are just venting. Almost all of those people come right back, if not all of them. They’re the same type of people who vent by asking “what’s up with x” when x is something that isn’t working correctly, or post about the crashes (I just crashed at the end of silo, for example. It’s frustrating). I’ve done it. If you’re going to complain about people posting about leaving the game you might as well complain about all posts that bring up issues.
---
I agree most definitely
---
You're saying Slugger is additive. You're also saying Slugger isn't a general damage perk, which is true. The comment that you linked says that only general damage perks are additive.
---
U said it not me
---
Sometimes I feel like the only scrub still using that functionality
---
I'm in the Brotherhood Outcast group, is this a different one?
---
Yes
---
I’m more or less talking about Unique additions Along with skins, say they can have a specific barrel for a specific weapon that fits for it, Like bone raider excavator how it changed it’s overall model and skin
---
where u get bunnu suit?  is that only on survival mode?
---
Glad you took the time to write a complaint about my post, thank you.
---
Dismissed.
---
New Vegas vs 76 are two entirely different beasts... I know 76 takes a lot of flak, but what mmo doesn't on release... Their all living creatures... Do u wanna wander the wasteland alone or would you rather have random folks popping shots at you on a regular basis... Depending on your goals you will have different opinions... Occasionally someone is 76 is nice to you too
---
Thank you for the offer, but I did have one and it isn’t what I’m looking for. If you do come across the Bloodied SS and want to sell it though, reach out to me...my GT is the same as my name on here 😁
---
“Patch notes for tomorrow’s update will be realeased during maintenance” the update is clearly ready, wanna bet that the only reason they haven’t released patch notes is because they’re releasing repair kits tomorrow and wanna avoid negative press?
---
The headpiece is the reward for collecting all 6 Atom shop Easter Eggs last week.
---
The fucking boards and pipe wrenches are an instant rage quit
---
Okay, let's try this REALLY simply.
---
IF nobody duped 3* items, and they were gained only though gameplay... then there would be fewer 3* items in the game, and therefore, the value of 1* items would be higher to players.
---
Get yourself pa with emergency protocols and any bloodied weapon (preferably melee or shotgun) you will be surprised how good this combo is.
---
In the case of these live service type games, I wonder if it's more about a way of telling the developer that they are unhappy with the product rather than telling the community. There are probably a lot that are directing it at the community as well, but many of these "I'm leaving" posts provide constructive criticism with the intention of providing feedback in hopes of improving the game.
---
Perhaps we see these posts on Reddit because there is no other outlet for providing feedback, or this rub is simply the easiest way to submit feedback with hopes the developer will see it. I've been away from FO76 for a little while, but I don't recall a way to submit feedback directly to the developer from within the game. 
---
Just my take on it I suppose.
---
You... are not a smart boy, are you?
---
Sweet, I'm down to join. I play on PC, Discord tag is BranSolo#6430.
---
No what it says is that multiplicative damage boosts are additive with each other. Because if they were multiplicative with each other they wouldn’t be as good and result in lots of diminishing returns.
---
Oh I REALLY fucking like this. These sound great. Also might I just add I really like the idea of the Free States capturing and reprogramming Liberators for their own use? I really think that oughta be a canon thing they tried to do.
---
Quest involving hunting them down for parts that you can graft onto yourself, that gives minor perks like Math Wrath or  Entomologist.
---
You don't need to kill the scorched officers to get the nuke code btw, it's the same for everybody and resets every week. nukacrypt.com is a website that displays the current nuke codes when they are solved.
---
You can get the rocket concrete on other super sledges, but on all rise you can’t change it tho, they need to bring back the 9mm Weapons, the repeaters, and the Assault/marksman Carbine. I thought the Medicine stick from NV was pretty cool
---
if you clear the game cache should fix it but will lose your pics
---
I have not applied this serum because of the reduction if HP... is there a way to make it up with class freak?
---
I want to like those but the radius seems so much smaller than the regular nuka grenades. I only have the first rank of Grenadier though.
---
Is there even a worthwhile benefit to doing survival? I feel like it would be rife with griefers, and I despise PvP.
---
Too late... You stuck with us now. Besides that they both have pros/cons. Anyways new Vegas has stop time im a badass slow motion aimbot. Awesome story legendary mailman let's not forget the ultimate badass villain who only rivals Riddick voice Ulysses. Cons well limited leveling and that end game feeling where once you get everything the game becomes hollow after. 
---
Now fallout 76.... Pros: players,ability to make multiple mules unlimited leveling updates (and some other things I forgot about)  cons: occasionally trolls easy to produce bugs limited stash/ camp budget weaker vats that requires more precision but still aimbotty. 95% accuracy doesn't mean 95% sometimes.
---
the atom shop only updates when you fully shut down the game and log back on. if you did not check that day before the next change you missed your chance at that day's egg
---
All legacy items should go for more
---
How much would it cost to upgrade my xo1 arms left leg and torso to lv 50 form lv 40 and maybe add some mods onto it?
---
Worst case scenario is you became a ghoul who gets to live with that knowledge for the next few hundred years.
---
When I was server hopping for desks in the building just opposite the top of the world I was running from the spawn point if you travel to top of the world towards the train station (when the plans didn’t spawn), I ran into 3 scorpions amongst 15 hops, hope that helps
---
How would I even know?
---
Glad I’m not the only one who does this XD
---
Whatever transponder you found last you can start from there even though it sends you to the beginning.
---
That almost sounds devious. You drop your workshops on them unknowingly, and when you’re gone they get farmed by someone and they don’t know how they’re hostile.
---
Ive done it smoothly solo, whereas other times the turrets are unrelenting. Is there a way to globally disable them, or do you have to hack/disable each sections turrets?
---
apparently the raider longcoat is coming. but yeah, they're drip-feeding us content. the rider PAs have been datamined forever ago.
---
I was just reading about him and you're right. That would be terrifying. Especially in a game with no other living human npcs.
---
No kidding. It took me about 10 levels just to switch from one handed melee to two handed
---
So lame...
---
Another question... how long does stuff you sell to a vendor, stay in their inventory?
---
Well you give me no hope but I appreciate the honesty
---
Likely RNG but now we’re getting back into speculation. Todd’s phrasing in the video was interesting but still ambiguous.
---
meh, it's the forest, it's supposed to be for newbies
---
how about raider paint jobs for each power armor.. even the ultracite and X-01 they could claim some silly reason, like raiders stole a copy off of the plans of a protectron attempting to deliver to each faction's respective outpost. kind of like with the description of the Excavator power armor's raider paint
---
Middle mountain cabins can be great.  You can get bears and load up on springs, you can get honeybeasts and load up on machine guns, or you can get those burrowing assholes.
---
Are you talking about like the dlc of new Vegas? About the robot brains/dog brain (my favorite gun sad to hear the whimper when switching guns.)
---
It is, it's tiny, but you make outta different nukas anyway so I just make both. The Quantums have smaller radius but higher dmg, so it balances a bit 🤷 but I carry some of each lol
---
Im level 245 and I love stacking that adrenaline and absolutely wrecking anything in my path while everyone else works on the queen.

Your mom got hella brains if u catch my drift

I can do this all day

Ended up not doing it bc it was sus asf. Kept begging for the arms first....

Didn’t know that
---
I hate to agree with brotherhood scum but it would make appalachia more interesting.
---
I was just referring to your edits. You mentioned that you thought people were downvoting you because they were in fact people that were planning on writing a post saying that they are leaving the game. I was just trying to clear that up a bit because I think you are being overly defensive here. 
---
I see you have since deleted all of the accompanying text. You do you man.
---
The suit from Wilfred
---
That's the thing, we don't know. And a lot of people claim one way or the other. They didn't provide wording specific enough to know for sure, yet.
---
I believe I have some of both. Were you looking for any ones in particular?
---
I actually haven't deleted text but nice try :)
---
In adventure, I accept all invites.  I haven't been burned yet (Xbox)
---
Uh, the post doesn't say anything like that. It only says that Adrenal Reaction is additive with general damage perks and multiplicative with all else.
---
And no, that's not true. Multiplicative damage boosts are more effective than additive. For example, 2 maxed out Sluggers are +20% each.
---
If multiplicative, then 100% times 1.2 is 120%. Then times 1.2 for the second perk is 144%.
---
If additive, then 100% +20% is 120%. Then +20% against is 140%.
---
and it might  mean you've got three friends hiding in the wings to steal my shit.
---
No thank you. You just log off… and I'll take your workshop for myself, thanks.
---
They can certainly be deadlier!
---
I don't agree with this idea. 
---
There was a post a few days/weeks past which noted all the good locations for finding 3 star legendary creatures which may interest the people reading this. The West Tek Research Center if I remember was a good spot. Besides that, the Uranium Fever Event is also a great source for 2 star and 3 star legendary items. To add to this, I've met alot of lower levels who are already decked out in 2-3 star legendary equipment. If you read the comments here on /r/fo76 you're bound to read a comment about people having stockpiles of legendaries that they've been hoarding for the legendary vendor. I would surmise that most people hoarding legendary equipment would be hoarding 2-3 stars minimum equipment.
---
One of the problems Fallout 76 has is balancing and I don't believe that making 3 star items widely available will help, as if "the balance in the game already sucks, let's make it suck more" is an argument. If you are in dire need for 3 star legendaries, I would also recommend using /r/market76 if you really want 3 star equipment. 
---
I believe OP, people like OP and the people who have upvoted this are arguing for 3 star legendary creatures to drop ONLY 3 star legendaries so that getting a god roll would be easier for yourself. If the game was this easy, 1. how is balancing ever going to be fixed and 2. no one should complain how easy the game is.
---
Killing him was the most satisfying kill in any FO game. Fuck Kellogg.
---
You can put stealth mods on better armors though too, so why would you choose the worst one?
---
There it is again... you think you're the one leading the charge here? Cocky little shit.
---
I have characters with empty camps you can build.
---
I don't think it will work when server hopping, as it would not let me *mine* at the same spot 12 hours later (note: this was not on the same server). Maybe it will reset after 24 hours (as plans usually do). If you have multiple characters on your account though, you can still *mine* with each one no problem.
---
i got there at some point and i was thinking "no way"... instant regret
---
Even base NV had cybernetics that improved a SPECIAL Stat by 1,or increased your DR.
---
Yes, please let me have a long involved quest resulting in cybernetics!
---
:D I remember that show I don't want to spoil what happens in that show.
---
Had an bugged out invisible Deathclaw wrecking everyone one day was crazy. People would go from full health to none in like a second and have no idea what did it
---
And to think I just got a legendary goul golf club today,had a mutant one yesterday.
---
1) add Deathclaw hordes
---
2) increase deathclaw random spawns from 1-&gt;3
---
3) make them quieter and not scream when they aggro
---
4) more pep in their step
---
5) have a high level Old Olney style dungeon in the forest that you can accidentally stumble upon and fall in
---
6) bring back the high level variants used in FO4
---
Yeh I liked it a lot , very dark and funny
---
Good on you for the visual (how’d I forget that?!?!?!?). Yeah, kinda. I was originally thinking, if Scorched are basically Feral’s w/ scorch disease, then the Augs (Augmented) could be like feral’s with robotic qualities.
---
You'll get more hours on NV probably, since that's the type of game where after you beat it you start up another playthrough, never to visit your old character again. This FO game has no reason to restart, so you just keep going. Never had a lvl 200 character in 3 NV or 4
---
My opinion is, if you don't want low levels there, don't launch the nuke on a server with low level players.
---
You launch with low levels present, you get what you get.
---
Appreciate the help.
---
Because it’s weightless without a legendary affix. Adding shadowed and muffled makes other armors heavy even if they’re legendary weightless. And the buff shrouded wood gives is better.
---
Be there in 5
---
The second character I want to start is just waiting on 2 apparel peices, black leather cop hat  and black assless chaps.
---
Hook line and sinker  bro
---
Yeah that makes sense
---
she didn't drop legendaries for me, but she did drop 2 plans:  Decontamination shower and ultracite .45 ammo.
---
Hope they fix the weekly and daily challenges too. Kinda weird having challenges around using camera and films and what not . It’s not even in game yet . Ridiculous
---
Oh wait I know what your talking about that implant clinic. it scales on your endurance level but you can't have more than 3 or something due to strain to the human body can't handle more than that. That was a fun side encounter I love going to.
---
Sure, which is why I didn’t go beyond their statement.  Stars will matter. That’s all we “know”.
---
I don't think there's a plan for the DCG. Pretty sure it's like the grog axe where it only drops as a legendary weapon
---
I’m in the same boat as you as far as having a maxed camp that I don’t want to move. What I do a lot is test out new building ideas on workshops I’ve claimed. They’re temporary but you can practice there for hours (or until you get disconnected)
---
We can get you into a new Xo1 model for 1k with a trade in. 
---
Unfortunately, with the mods being bugged atm I can only offer an Xo1 with a jetpack. 
---
I have both standard and prototype paint jobs in stock. 
---
And if you upgrade to the maxed Xo1 I am willing to offer the Quantum paint at no charge! That's right, I will pay for Bethesda's bug.
---
I believe you're looking for the fancy plaid suit &amp; tie, that gives me a gambling vibe. Don't know about that one being in 76 but it could be.
---
Deathclaw island? I've been playing almost daily since beta and have not discovered this location.
---
It’s always been like that , patch notes during maintenance
---
Sounds like you were playing a healer and everyone else was playing a dick.
---
The island should be shaped after a death claw and if you nuke it. A 100 foot death claw spawns.
---
Random? Is that yet another name you have for Bethesda? Is this yet another cry for help?

If only I had more confidence in your ability to follow a link! It says right there, "I'm the 900 hours played guy", and everything!
---
Really? Shit.... :(
---
Yeah I do tend to play support rolls alot lol I'm use to it
---
I failed Surface to Air on Saturday, because i ran out of steel scrap to fix the SAMs. lol
---
Yeah that does sound fishy, glad you didn't get scammed though!
---
Funny, I created Kellogg's wife
---
Yeah :(
---
Too bad about that plot twist though about (I think his name is Dave?) Found out he was just a man in a suit.  I wanted it to be a man communicating with his dog due to his condition.(as far as I got when cable turned off)
---
You can't resist. You see nay response as a blow to your frgile little ego. Every response you've made in here is a childish, little "I was just kiddin' bro" response. You're textbook, dime-a-dozen... "bro".
---
You won't be able to ignore this one, either. Your ego can't handle it... I can see you now. hovering over the keyboard... "how do I respond and twist this into me being the one in charge... if I respond, he's right, If I don't... then I've lost in my own mind... OMG... "
---
I’ve tried workshops, and have a lot of bad luck. Typically, people will come and sneak up and kill me, which begins the onslaught of an hours worth of being attacked for no reason. It’s rlly bad
---
I like using the crossbow but the one thing that annoys me is the iron sight so yes plz some mods would be great.
---
Sheepsquach event areas before they start I think.
---
You're not a rifle build so you dont use an AA rifle but your best gun is a rifle that helps you sneak better? Which is worse than an AA rifle most likely? This doesn't add up.
---
lol i got a fusion mag lv 20 alien blaster it did 4 damage it was practically a thirst zapper mk.2 what a joke
---
I hate to commend dirty Enclave members but thanks
---
Pray for fallout 5 :)
---
I'm trying to remember, I wonder if it's still on Netflix
---
That link doesn't say anything about duping. Want to keep proving you fail at reading comprehension?
---
Ah...okay. I didn't know that. Might just carry on doing it like that for a while. I found 2 new locations.
---
Yeah that's what I mean. Right under the tower, in that landing with the two elevators, close to the area with two workbenches that leads to the ski resort
---
Still sounds really useless when you compare it to how it balances vs other options. In PVE you can easily wear better armor and be nearly undetectable, plenty fast, and not have to worry about your armor weight, and then in PVP I'll hard scope right through that chameleon mutation and you'll wish your armor was good at actually protecting you from damage.
---
You...  you do know that no chaps have an ass in them, right?
---
The key feature to look for is... are the snaps/zippers INSIDE the leg, or OUTSIDE? THAT is what defines their purpose.
---
They're like Pandas.
---
There is a plan for the deathclaw gauntlet - you can obtain it from the safes - i got two plans over the weekend. The best place to farm it is at the cemetery above the lewisberg station - i forgot the actual name but the location is just north of that train station - it's in the ash heap.
---
I do this with all holotapes and notes (that arent plans or treasure maps)
---
When my husband and I are playing together he usually has to ask me which holotape he was supposed to listen to. We've played together since Beta and he's never dropped a single holotape. I'm pretty sure he even has like 8 or so blank holotapes.
---
The fact the bulldog gun uses 44. Rounds. Aka magnum rounds made me feel sad if I can't feed it bullets. I wore the stealth suit with the dog gun for maximum talking. While the lababdor gun uses (I think) 45s.
---
Na just a shit talker gettin my daily fill thnx texting between rounds is all
---
Thanks.  Guess I missed my chance.  Bleh.
---
I've never gotten even a mid tier 3* from the SBQ in hundreds of hours. Lots of duplicate plans and 2*'s though.
---
Welcome to the club.
---
Hope someone got in. I ctd fast traveling there....
---
Boom. There it is.
---
Raider Longcoat? What and where is that?
---
Pretty much the same boat as you, I usually only pick up shotgun,(close quarters) 45,(long range snipe/lever action) .50ball.(Dragon) the .38 and 10mm I usually dump with a lvl 1 + lvl 5 weapon off a scorched that I repair and mod for the xp at overseers, everything else in train stations.
---
They've been pulling some shenanigans with patch notes and non-announced changes in more than one of their games lately, so it's worth keeping an eye on things right now.  But I believe you're correct on the timing, that much seems like business as usual.
---
Duping? What's that?
---
Doesn't even have to be that complex. It would just be smearing some paint and putting some bones over the armor. Hell, if they need it to be a proper plan, they can just incorporate Rose into it
---
Likewise. I got initiate pretty fast after launch. I’ve been turning in at least 1 tech data a day since the new paints were released, still nothing. Couple outfits and 1star armors but that’s it.
---
That has nothing to do with the lack of economy. The lack of economy is due to no place to trade, a UI that is set up to cause scamming, and a cap limit that every trader is already maxed out on with all 5 of their character slots.
---
Why would I trade for anything when it is a bigger pain to go trade for it than it is to grind it myself? It makes no sense for me to waste my time trying to go trade when the UI is so garbage a person could scam and lie about the second and third attribute of the item and I'd have no way of knowing. There is no in game way of finding people trading, and nobody even wants caps because they are all maxed out from selling civil war hats.
---
What level are you? I wouldn’t have thought the deathclaw spawn level would be much if any different from player level 50 onwards, but all I got was a diseased level 65. Unless of course a creature level doesn’t affect stats from some level onwards, say 60.
---
If anti material rifle was introduced I would switch my build to rifleman in a heartbeat.
---
Oh... Too bad fallout 76 can't adapt other fallout games main iconic suits
---
The reason you couldn’t before was only on certain guns, there was no “standard” receiver mod to change back with. They added standard receivers for all those guns (I believe)
---
Calm down satan
---
What you keep harping on about in the earlier comments. You starting to lose your memory from dehydration from all those tears you been crying?
---
PS4
---
Yeah I think we're full-up on mascot type outfits right now.
---
Came for Fallout, stayed for the lesson on chaps.
---
I'm a bit disgusted. My first time launching a nuke solo and nothing for my troubles... :-(
---
It sounds dangerous, so they should make it dangerous, and something to prepare for
---
It is EXTREMELY valuable. If you give it the charging shotgun barrel, it destroys anything. The base damage is already very high
---
fam...im on pc. it sounds like most of the people this has happened to are also on pc. understand that WE DONT HAVE a constant screen recodring going on and its unreasonable to ask anyone to have that.
---
also please understand the glitch seems to despawn a random item stack from your inventory. and it only happens very rarely.
---
the reason a lot of these posts are about people losing valuable items is because youre more careful with them and know where they are at all times.
---
think of it like a wallet. youd notice if a 100$ bill disappeared from your billfold but you may not notice if a penny did.
---
it sounds messed up but i sincerely hope this happens to you, that way youll understand. noone has anything to gain by posting about things disappearing. bethesda will never refund us our items. but mabye theyll fix the bug so it wont happen again.
---
20-25k on PS4 now. Nearing trade only.
---
The 20s are the worst. Once you get to level 30 and can get starched genes and marsupial the game is better.
---
Oh shweet, I'll have to check next time I'm on
---
I don't think is really abnormal. I have played a few games that don't release patch notes before hand. What benefit would you gain anyway? Plus I can't recall them doing early notes before patch anyways.
---
Either or! I just feel it’s something we’ve had up till 4, and I want them back lolol. They could balance them similar to Mutations, or have you pick one over the other (although a mutant cyborg dweller sounds AMAZING)
---
Ye also be warned once you find all the codes you have to decrypt them. They don't automatically make the nuke code, they are pieces in a complex encryption code
---
Oh! You mean "using system exploits resulting in duplicated items", like **Bethesda** said in the link. I think we're on the same page again, you should have just said so, it would really be appreciated if you could be just a tad bit clearer.

This. As a bloodied HW player, an Instigating (hell even a bloodied) Gatling gun does enough damage to 1-hit a lot of enemies, even 62 non-glowing bloated ones if you’ve got adrenaline running. Anything that takes more than a few bullets I switch to a bloody 50cal. Although the accuracy of the Gatling gun means I still use it on scorchbeasts while they’re airborne.

I’m pretty much always in a group with a mutated teammate who has Empath, too, it helps with survivability since my only other survival feature is an emergency Protocol torso. 
---
I do switch up some perk categories pretty frequently, and I’ve got a pretty different perk loadout for tanking the sheepsquatch.
---
Thank y’all both. I appreciate it
---
Good god, I'm not setting myself up for disappointment or hyping myself up for it. All I'm saying that it's still possible as we haven't seen exactly what we're getting yet. Just trying to be matter of fact here. There might be a suit, and there might not be a suit. We'll just have to see. Every mascot uniform ingame so far has both a head and an outfit. It's far from unlikely that there would a suit as well, and it's very likely that we weren't suppose to see the head before it came out in the store, especially as it was suppose to be a surprise.
---
I picked up my first ever legendary assault rifle a few days ago , it was trash, low level one star poo , but it surprised me to see it at all
---
Had this happen twice the other day.  I reported it as bug on Bethesda support site
---
That drill pierced the queens hide cherish it to kill smoug the dragon now.
---
It has a plan, like the grog ax and dragon only way to get it is level 3 locked safes. And even then it is rare.
---
There's no plan for any of those...
---
hey. will you all please address the bug where random items keep disappearing from peoples inventories. there have been dozens of independent accounts and it has gotten to the point where some people are hesitant to play out of fear of their favorite items disappearing.
---
I only discovered it recently.  So now there's 2 of us.
---
then, they will need to increase rhe size of the island...
---
You can rank up duplicate perk cards without gaining a level...
---
Or, *decrease* the size of deathclaws!
---
Firecracker Whiskey has two mixed drinks?  Has anyone been gotten Firecracker Whiskey?  I have all recipes except Nuka Dark and anything related to Firecracker Whiskey.
---
I missed the second egg because of the refresh issue as well. Was thinking of putting in a ticket 🤷‍♂️
---
It uses a perk point to do that though. If we already have 2 lvl 1 cards why should we need to use a point to combine them. It dosen't really make sense
---
I have had the quest but when i want stuf some td in the mailbox it wont let me,happens nothing.can you help me please
---
I want both it's not op it's just a booster considered how nerfed special is compared to new Vegas.
---
Nah. Increase the size of the island and the deathclaws
---
Not really just trying to gather some cause I love the original mask and always wanted to have a "story" Behind it what time will you be on and what's your psn
---
Dude a hoard of little deathclaw glass cannons would be adorable.
---
Mr freeze
---
there seems to be an issue where after fast traveling, a piece will disappear.
---
it can also happen to pieces inside a frame thats inside your stash.
---
i pulled out some armour i hadnt used in a few days and the arm was gone. it was there when it was stashed but not days later.
---
I think it's a deathclaw gauntlet skin that will be released later.
---
I have found and learned the Deathclaw Gauntlet plan but I have not yet seen a plan for the axe or the dragon but I have seen a non-legendary dragon before but not the axe. I'm not ruling them out tho.
---
You've discovered "Cazadores Island"
---
There’s the nuka cola paint for T-51 you can find following an unmarked quest
---
That's what I'm sayin'! We already got the eggs and everything.
---
Sounds like those people are dicks and not capable of thinking outside the box. If I were in that fight I’d have kept a close eye on you whilst attacking the queen, so I could revive you when necessary. Keeping the mob off people is a good idea in general, and I take a break every now and then from attacking the queen to do it myself. It pisses me off to no end when a bunch of random scorched won’t leave me alone while I’m trying to attack he queen.
---
http://ase.tufts.edu/nohomersclub/nhc-sign.jpg
---
This is timely because I’m on this quest and also got pulled away from the game only to find the quest reset. Good to know I can go straight to glass cavern.
---
Maybe also a all in no movement full on damage perks activated set.
---
Hmm, okay. The weapons workbench shows what you can learn to craft, so when I hop on later I'll check that out cause wtf I'm just now hearing about this lol
---
The Atom Shop doesn't update with new items while the game is open.    
---
So, for example, if you start playing before the daily update (5pm PST) you'll see the previous egg only until it expires but you will not see the new egg until you restart your game.
---
People in the wasteland are scary. I’ve been lured back to people camps thinking they were friendly and then taken into a camp with locked doors and got the poop knocked out of me. So I have a hard time joining random invites.
---
Do you know where that starts
---
I would really like these. It would also be super cool though to have pots I can plant my stuff inside with. There are flower pots around the game, and whether I can plant carrot flowers or mutfruit or whatever I’d quite enjoy having a patio garden or a quick herb garden.
---
The T-51 Nuka Cola paint. I’ve got an extra one and am on PS4.
---
I also switched from hardened to tweaked.
---
Switching the perks, I lost like 5 damage but got more dps(automatic) and vats shots. It depends on your builds though,but tweaked is a valid option.
---
That makes more sense then a new weapon
---
The right hand holds the gun and does a motion from pointing forward to pointing at ground, while the left hand uses the ejection rod, rotates the cylinder and also loads the round.  Hilariously overcomplicated way to load a single action with one hand.
---
Totally agree, my son just started playing so the other evening I rolled a new character so we could play together. Upon spawn we went to the overseers camp and then proceeded to head to in a northern direction as told him that we are heading to one of my favorite places on the map. Eventually we came to the river, we crossed with me taking the lead directly to the spawn site, as he noticed the islands name and said something the deathclaw spawned. I sprinted for the river and jumped in and he died.
---
Same thing happened to me. I was logged on at 5 pm pst when the Atomic Shop changed but since I didn't "quit" Fallout 76 it didn't reset the store so I never got the 4th egg :-( Make sure to play something else or quit the app to reset the Atomic shop if they do another event like this. Sucks, but it is what it is.
---
Cool. By extra one do you mean full set of power armor or the paint plans
---
Out of curiosity, which clothes had bonuses? I don't remember hearing anything about that, but I don't spend many Atoms (prefer to save for limited time stuff) so maybe I missed it?
---
Yeah, I figured that. Wasn't sure how it all went, I was hoping to figure it out when I got there!
---
https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/26/fallout-76-nuka-cola-power-armor-paint/
---
This article will walk you through step by step
---
It's okay! I just found out Friday night myself and I've been playing since beta too. I was in a party with a friend who was trading and he asked for a Deathclaw Gauntlet plan the guy had and I collect deathclaw stuff so my eyes were like 0\_0 a what now?! And I found them! Those three safes at the cemetery seem to be the best place to hop and farm!
---
Make it a second, separate island. Perfection.
---
Next time you get the ash pile if you wait around a while without collecting it often still reverts back to a meat pile with flies for whatever nonsense reason.
---
Yeah only reson I like to be revived is so I dont respawn in the nuke zone lol
---
but since deathclaw cant to projectiles like mirelurk queen, it is perfectly fine to limit them to an island even within newbie zone.
---
Is it possible to buy them from someone or id it a atom shop item that gets destroyed dropping it
---
Well I know what I'm doing tonight!! Haha, thank you!
---
The drill is in the legendary loot table. I die a little inside every time a 3* drops me one.
---
Two nukes or glitch?
---
ALSO we need a perk that negates ammo usage like luck of the draw that has a chance to not use ammo on the next shot etc.
---
We're a very exclusive club
---
Just the paint plans, I’ll sell it to you for cheap. Or you could do the quest by following a YouTube guide which gets you the TNT dome key so you can get the plans for it as often as you want.
---
Hell just called, they want their boss back.
---
Not yet for me. I stumbled on the lemonade stand for lemonade and hard lemonade (in the Savage divide or close to the Mire? I think).
---
Im feeing lazy ill just buy it off you
---
If you’re thinking about buying it. I say do it. And that way you’ll have your own opinion on the game and then you can decide whether or not you like it. People have been bashing this game or 100% supporting this game. You won’t get a clear answer until you see for yourself. 
---
My opinion: Yes get it. I love the game. I’ve met some really cool people wandering through the wastelands and have some funny stories. I’ve been in fights with other people where all I could do was run away to my camp and hide in a bedroom as they knock down my walls looking for quick caps. It’s scary but fun.
---
He only sells lemonade.  The whiskey should come from Biv.
---
Yeah at least give us the option to destroy perk cards we don't want and have them turn into perk points so we can choose ones we want or just leave the points for later.
---
Ok I added you. I also have the nuke quantum paint for x-01 if you want it.
---
Then change the name. As this is false advertising
---
Would love to see a 1911 pistol.
---
Wood isn't ever going to be for PVP. But in PVE, what's really the better Damage Protection, +20 or never even being seen at all?  Wood has it's role, especially with chameleon.
---
Still on the lookout for this, haven't found one yet
---
That'll be fixed by the camera actually being released. if we're lucky, they'll increase the value of some challenges to make up for this week's impossible challenges, but I think we're just gonna have to deal with it.
---
Yup
---
Nope
---
I mean a bunny head for an Easter surprise is almost definitely appropriate and accurate, but with regards to all the costumes? It’s Halloween when the bombs fall, isn’t it?
---
He's the mailman from New Vegas.
---
Yeah, he’s appeared much more frequently for me there.
---
Not at all. I'm level 184 with 500 hours in the game and use all 1 star gear. I have never found a useful 2 or 3 star piece of gear that fits my play style. I have also bought most of the one star pieces of gear I use from other players and venders.
---
Pretty sure you won't get the same build space as you would in your own camp
---
I'm never seen at all unless I want to be without using wood.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Current speculation is that you will be able to trade in legendaries for tokens, and that potentially different tokens or amount of tokens given depending on number of stars on the item and that something can be done to make it more likely that you will be able to get the type of weapon if not even the type of effect desired. 
---
They also supposedly will be able to do straight buy, sell, scrap but 🤷‍♂️
---
I've no interest in work shops or workshop pvp so I will definitely not accept random team invites .

---
Glitch.  My post title was "2 SBQ's for the price of 1".
---
Yes LOL
---
Nope, it literally doesn't say that. Keep failing at that reading comprehension.
---
That’s very kind of you. 
---
I have other characters I play with that are much higher level and with power armor. I’m just trying out a new build, automatic weapons, rifles and pistol builds.
---
I had never seen an x01 up close and to have some stranger set it on my platform only to have it stolen by someone else was disheartening.
---
Again thank you for your offer. 
---
Happy hunting and i hope I can keep paying it forward.
---
I have consistently been solo dropping nukes this past week, with several hitting SBQ. Got a prime railway rifle receiver from one of the kills. It's a royal pain to build ammo for it, though. One cobalt flux is just 7 spikes, 10 with that ammo perk. I do not recommend it. 
---
Might start nuking other fissure sites though just to see what happens.
---
Just build 4 rocket turrets and 4 heavy machine guns. Place them around your camp in a way they can defend all sides. A tower with them mouted in the corners will do. If sb comes the rockets combo does enough damage to drive them off or kill them if they dont run.
---
It's so much fun!
---
Wth is a booldie???
---
Great will visit it soon!
---
Powerful Automatic Receiver has almost the same damage as the hardened and thats what i use
---
What does [Removed] mean? That’s all I see where your text was... also, I thought you didn’t care?
---
The multiplicative perks stack additively with each other. 
---
And yes it is true that you would receive diminishing returns if multiplicative damage bonuses stacked multiplicatively.
---
For instance, a weapon with 100 damage.
---
Bloody mess adds 15% more multiplicative damage, adrenal adds 50% more multiplicative damage at low health. Stacked together additively you get 65% more damage, stacked together multiplicatively and you get 57.5%.
---
The problem with your math is you’re including the whole(the base damage) more than once.
---
I'm a grinder..only seen 2 things ever in the atom shop worth buying...princess bed and skull excavator...nothing elese seems cool/useful
---
Do you use the flechette mod? I just think the thing needs a significant range increase with no mods or with barbed harpoon. As it is its the dsame as an unmodded AR, which seems to go against its design (a heavy bolt action gun)
---
I think it needs. More damage or more range to compensate.
---
The flechette mod does make it usable though, but it sucks you pretty much have to stick to that
---
For bloodied I like the damage so hardened. But for a high health build tse, tuned.
---
Come back when you pass 2nd grade.
---
I don't see anything removed on my end so I'm not sure what you're talking about. Also if it says "removed" then someone reported a thing and a mod deleted it. It would say "deleted" if it was taken down by me
---
They could make a huge monster island, like in the mire.
---
Drop mirelurks, death claws and snally gasters everywhere.
---
Well I’m not adding decorations or lighting or anything, just a bare frame of a house. I’ve got a couple designs to work around
---
bloodstained, in German Blutbefleckt my english isnt well
---
I would, no loss. Seems like a crap way to miss a egg not knowing
---
The problem here is that you're arguing about value *in caps*, and that's the only way you're defining value, and that's flawed.
---
That isn't the true value of the thing. The value has been fucked because there are so many 3* items in place, that finding a 1* item feels meaningless. Back to my diamond example... if everyone has diamonds, finding one on the ground is about as exciting as finding a dime. Now, if those diamonds also define one's worth in prestige and power... finding a dime in that world is 100% pointless.  Diamonds = 3star items... dimes = 1star. Players are bitching about "why doesn't the SBQ drop 3star?" and are paying for them (in caps) because they require them at this point to remain competitive. Why? *BECAUSE EVERYONE FUCKING HAS THEM*. Stop trying to tell me what I mean. THIS is how an economy gets fucked. Market? Doesn't matter... people will always create a way. Ease? No matter, people will always create a way.
---
This economy has been fucked because it has devalued anything less than 3star in player's eyes *in game terms*. Now, if you want to talk about trade value, in Fallout Monopoly money,  that's a separate discussion.
---
Im too poor for x01
---
Holy fuck learn how to spell mate reading this post gives me a fucking headache.
---
It is at the north-west edge of the map, west of the ferris wheel, north of Mothman Museum. I haven't gone there myself as well and I blame Bethesda for this, since quests naturally push you away from that side of the map.
---
Yeah it's crazy BSD seems to be promoting team play and socializing(multiplayer/voice chat) yet implement game mechanics that promote solo play .. 
---
I normally do however accept random invites cause I'm super social and my voice is angelic and hypnotic .. but 9/10 times it's just someone that wants a quick cheap way to the part of the map I'm in then they dip and abandon me … my feels
---
No. Mutants has zero downsides and zero maintenance (apart from having mutations, which basically everyone should). 
---
Vanguards rapidly loses effectiveness as you lose health, so you have to stay aware and maintain your health to get benefit. Bolstering is the same except you have to maintain low health, so it’s even trickier because you’re that much more vulnerable staying that low all the time.
---
I'm lvl 79 rn, and I'm not sure if enemies lvl with you or not. I've seen those level 65s in there but lately it's been a lot of level 91s
---
50k is simply outrageous. You can't even hold that many caps.
---
Then we have a few issues: Two-Shot is notoriously bad on rifles. The accuracy debuff makes it un-usable with VATS. This is even if we ignore the buggyness of the Gauss rifle itself. If you're not a VATS user it's a bit better but that accuracy debuff is still there. Gauss Rifle ammo is heavy as heck, the rate of fire is quite slow, you have to charge your shots to take full advantage of the rifle itself... All of this in a game where rate of fire seems to be better.
---
What you have there is an overhyped weapon, it's a status symbol, a weapon people can use to brag about stuff. Personally as a VATS rifleman user i would never use such a weapon. 
---
The 6-8k caps someone said feels the fairest price, it's an extremely niche item that's only okay in some very specific scenarios. You could probably get more for it, but that's only due to the hype around TSE weapons, not because the weapon itself is useful. 
---
In the end it's up to you how much you want to get for that gun. You'll always find some sucker willing to pay stupid amounts of cash for stuff like this. I keep some Two-Shot weapons in my stash for this exact reason, to sell them to less informed people when vending comes up...
---
...since no dev will reply to anyone I'll pretend I'm a dev named dev for a bit "I have heard your feed back and will pass it around like my bad cosplay photos and crappy dogs to the dev team thank your passion"
---
Good luck!!
---
Legit worse than deathclaw island
---
I’ve been wondering the same thing, I need some crimson flux for a recipe and can’t get any
---
Buddy, calm down, take your meds.
---
Right
---
Nice Thank You!!
---
Bc u shouldnt have that many in the first place. Wtf dobubneed 670stims
---
I couldn't agree more. I really hate two shot weapons in general I just want to max my earnings without being a dick that's why I'm doing some research lol
---
Good bot
---
&gt;This FO game has no reason to restart
---
Sure there it. Leveling up an alt to try a new build is a heck of a lot less tedious than shuffling 1 perk point every level in order to respec an existing character.
---
Automatic vs. Rifle
---
More bullets/Less time = more punch per second vs. 5 slow shots and reload.  Play solo ... can't afford to one shot kill one thing while a mob kills me.
---
Because the perk system is an ill-thought out hacked together barely functional feature with absolutely no plan or design philosophy behind it.  
---
Don't worry, the community "We've forwarded your feedback" managers will ignore this one just like all the other perk related posts.
---
Good thing you had a solid enough team to take them both out in 15 minutes. That’s rare unless planned with friends.
---
Check the bunkers for brain fungus too. The firecap I've seen one here and there but stavvi seems to know.
---
No, no. I'm saying that's what Unique Uniques does. It's not skins its unique gun mods
---
I think the update tomorrow is an extension of patch 8 rather than a new one. It fixes some bugs and adds the camera and that’s about it
---
I tried sugar bombs and sweet rolls yesterday and they didn't affect the counter. I'll have to check again, maybe it glitched on me for some reason.
---
PC here too. I get my crap together and exit the server after the second nuke. Something about standing around waiting for a disconnected message that I don't enjoy.
---
It’s the highest defense upgrade available for combat armor (and gives more ER than DR oddly enough) and adds ZERO weight. It’s OP.
---
I do this.  I'm a sniper build and I do much more damage perched somewhere far out than I do close up.
---
I usually snag adds as they are running up behind people.
---
Of course, but serum recipe plans are no longer on her loot table since P8. it was removed either by accident or intentional, i'd say the first seeing how it's been a recurring thing with every patch sofar having some sort of unintended change slipping in.

could we get some confirmation if this is intentional change or not in relation to the serum plans no longer dropping off the Scorchbeast queen ? 
---
a comment on the nerfing of watoga's legendary mob spawns would be greatly appriciated aswell, since it wasnt mentioned in the patch notes.
---
as far as we know, protectron watoga government worker bots was added to the EpicCreatureDisallowed keyword, lowering the legendary spawn rate in watoga by quite a bit.

---
Yes and I understand that completely. But this change could help make it a little better. Too bad the managers pick and choose what to respond to and ignore this post despite its current status
---
I have to ask why does the TSE nerf effect it?  Is it just that you find the game to hard without a OP weapon?  I'm not judging just asking why a weapon nerf effects your desire to nuke, the end result is the same
---
Oh yeah, you're right
---
*injects psycho*
---
Oh God oh fuck
---
Yeah the cosmetics in this game are terrible right now .. it's fun to run around one shotting people in a mascot head cause it's silly and makes me all tingly all over but once all the cosmetics are just as silly it loses it's touch .. we need more normal I survived the bombs and threw this together outfits or a way to split outfits into top/bottom/boots etc to mix and match.
---
Also more raider stuff bethesdah!
---
You forgot about people who like to roleplay a ladyboy. I dress my guy up in ladies wear only.
---
Oh I need that and that mask //ooh
---
And I'm trying to tell you I'm an active trader and I literally have 5 characters full of caps. The economy is fucked because no one wants to trade because fear of being scammed due to the UI issues. You keep ignoring that part in your diamond analogy. Why not add into your diamond analogy the worry of being ripped off with no recourse. So randomly you may want a diamond but get ripped off and get a cubic zirconia instead.
---
The reason the economy is fucked is because no average player wants to do any trading, they all chose to play solo. The only ones trading are those that spend 8+hours a day on this game, and at the rate its been going the amount of people that spend that much time playing end up leaving due to bugs and just can't sustain an economy because most players don't want to trade at all, has nothing to do with dupes, has to do with the fact caps are worthless because you can max out your caps in under a week selling civil war hats you make in 10 minutes. NOT because duping ruined the economy. For duping to ruin an economy there had to have been an economy to begin with. There never was.

I think you meant to say: Being forced to level up another ~30-odd times because you have to spend a levelup just to move a single point  
---
Seriously, it's on the level of intentional mobile-game time-waster features that you pay to skip. $3 "1 SPECIAL stat respec" atom shop item in 3... 2...
---
I'm lvl 209 and have all of the str based perks. There's so many builds just in str it's unfair. picked up the other perks in case I ever feel like changing it up. Though I really mean about choice and consequences. They do have it on the road map but it's almost a year away
---
Same here. All that good steel that could go toward ammo!
---
You'll find a few if you feel like venturing into the boring abyss that's at the bottom left of the map.
---
The lemonade vendor can pop up at any of the random spawn points on the map. The first time I bumped into him was at the spawn point just south of the Overseer's camp, and a couple days ago I saw him at the spawn point south of Crevasse Dam.
---
On the plus side, one successful S2A netted me a bloodied plasma Gatling which seems made to melt SBs.
---
I've been thinking the same thing but didn't feel like saying anything because i doubt they'll fix it. 
---
Vats on melee never go above or below 95%, they should have removed it when they took explosive shots away from energy weapons. 🙄
---
Could that be related to time of day, rather than server? I don't tend to notice this problem during in-game daylight hours. Or do you think it seems to be specific servers that aren't loading properly?
---
Oh cmon not everything named like that is pluralized.
---
Ur afk and im standing right next to you
---
86DR, 55ER, then I can put a deep pocketed on it for you too.
---
If you talking bloody (low hp high damage) or get junkie to have that same effect go either explosive (5 explosive double size AOE with level 3 bloody mess perk) or get 1 heavy arms tank master and heavy arms (those speciality perks that increase NON explosive Heavy weapons with bloody mess) don't forget bear arms/ammo weight reduction perks.
---
This. Can confirm. 
---
This weekend I pulled two out of the safes in that cemetery as well. Really nice spot for completing your weapon plan collection.
---
Didn’t know my one post on my thoughts on a physical atomic shop would have anyone go this far in depth with it. Great ideas even if it were just a little more simplier I wouldn’t have an issue with it either way.
---
he's ESL apparently, chill.
---
Still waiting on that black, what looks like, tactical suit that was found in the latest atom shop code dive from this patch.
---
I found one so far by a tree not far from water.
---
Have no idea what to look for and before uding Google, i search fo76 reddit and here i am.

This is my Bloody HW/Explosives build. I consider Power Armor mandatory for HW, because of stabilized.

---
Hi! To start off you will need the adrenal reaction mutation so you are doing more damage the lower your health is, and there is a perk under intelligence called “stabilized” that takes off your enemy’s armour with heavy weapons while you are wearing power armour. Those are great things to increase your damage! 
---
And don’t listen to the rude people in the comments - you’re doing just fine! :) It is called a “bloodied heavy weapon build” so you know for the future!
---
I want to fight the wise mothman. He won't just soundwave me he will mind Fuuk me then CQC me into the ground.

Yup, also noticed it seems to get worse while building in your CAMP. I noticed it the other day when I was remodeling my CAMP. Was getting a 3 second hang like ever 30 seconds.

Cool, TIL
---
That is coming to patch 9, so not tomorrow but should be the next one.

How do you get more Lowe quests? Do you have to keep reading the poster? I have two mounted heads currently

He was announced in the Wild Appalachia roadmap. The Purveyor, a friendly Mole Miner vendor - based on the roadmap we know he'll let us scrap our unwanted legendary items to get new legendary gear. Based on interviews and datamined content it seems like we'll be able to scrap our legendaries to get special tokens, which we can exchange for new legendary gear or maybe to re-roll effects on our current legendary gear.
---
I have a lvl 10 bloodied sniper rifle, it took my alt to 45 without costs (alt is now 80). It has the 50 receiver on it and one shots just about anything in the game except mirlurk kings and queens, scorchbeasts. Friend is using it now to level a character, just took him into pvp and got him to 10, handed him the rifle.
---
It's really about having a weapon like that. Low level, low cost, lot of damage. You don't want to be leveling with a 50 cal or lmg
---
Not a low leveler here. Tickling 160. But I dont have any heavy hitting weapons that are good for the queen. I do however clean up ground forces like no bodies business. Glad to see from all the comments its not all for not.
---
I already have quantum paint so I’m good there as for jet pack I don’t really want that upgrade just because of the increased fusion core cost but I would be willing to do the 1k upgrade trade in if that’s ok I’m currently at work but will be home within the next few hrs I’ll let you know if I’ll be longer then that
---
i have officer plan how about 600 caps?
---
Skinnyhb - I can catch some nights with you on occasion hopefully. I'm a morning player MTN, but I am changing to night as I have a newborn.
---
that doesnt give you the plans though
---
There’s one at Toxic Larry’s Meat and Go, I really thought that would unlock Snallygaster but no luck. There’s another at Southern Belle hotel, on a table out front, it’s a pretty good one with a good reward.
---
That's a little too expensive..... Could you go any lower?
---
There are four notes tacked to two billboards (the ones in his office with all the cryptid stuff) inside the taxidermy shop.
---
Some legendary rewards are decent and they apparently are changing requirements from grinding gears to something easier and less boring.
---
But other than that there is no reason. Most of the players in there are likely to be assholes + you can't faster travel to many locations + server hopping does not work, because one is enough for all 10 people playing that mode.
---
I suppose that it could be OK for role playing people, assuming that you want to pretend to live in a world of Kill On Sight, don't do events or go to popular locations.
---
450?
---
yeah i just checked the fucking demo expert is not working in survival right now for some reason. and im using my twshot explosive cryolator to.
---
What I fully remember one of those gave me BOS mod that gave superior armor amounts and maintained same weight.
---
Good to know. Right now I have 2 on each hand and 2 on his head and thinking about building some stairs to see if I can switch that to a stack of all 6 on his head.
---
That's a lot better yeah I'll but from you
---
You aren't fooling anyone....but also the amount of hate is pretty silly.
---
I personally find it interesting that the game occupied you for 700 hours and that you got a lot of value out of it.  So thank you for sharing.
---
They are synergistic if that's what you're asking
---
Well now you got the paint plan for whenever you can build one!
---
you on now what is your GT ill invite you
---
That's an intercontinental bucket.
---
There’s also a bug where you can’t repair the thing you need to repair to start the event. At least there was, there’s been a few patches since I last did it.
---
Tuskedcargo99, not on right now it'll be a sec
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Ok sounds good. I generally offer more mods for the Xo1 but until Bethesda fixes the issue I only have select few prebuilt
---
send me a msg on xbox when you on GT: Tanaas
---
K.
---
Sure, it was ridiculous.
---
Also ridiculous, wanting them to remove camera based challenges in the update that adds cameras.
---
Oh okay. Sorry that person was a jerk.  Hope you still keep enjoying the game
---
and i also have knight and soldier plan
---
Ok thanks
---
I've been told that they work great together. But if I were to get the mutation and I had 100/300 max hp would it cut into 50/150 hp? And if I were to raise my health back up to 100 would it start to negate the bloodied effect?
---
After 8+ patches you still haven't learner those don't come out until the servers are go down?
---
Yet I brought up vehicles :/.
---
You're also keeping it dumbed down to a unstuck button and laziness thing, though in survival. You're walking 90% of the time anyway, lol.
---
The explosive sub machine gun surely must be better than the fixer if you're an automatic build
---
Played a few times this weekend, saw several nukes including three launched simultaneously to the same spot. YMMV
---
You can find the Fascnahct mask in Fort Defiance upstairs somewhere, found an extra last night there if that helps
---
I take one or two and then crouch and spam the stim when I get low enough. Some people actually do what needs to be done like that. Others are just fuck offs with no clue what to do or dont care. Unfortunatley that is more often than not. After 10 stims if no one else grabs the remaining pylons I usually bounce. Not wasting time and resources for the time to run out.
---
If you split the map in half, its just like FO4 where the further south you go, the harder it gets. There is LOTS to do up north to level up before going down south. I didn't head that way until I was lvl 35-40 ish.
---
All 10 people? Brutal burn, lmao.
---
Always tempted to poke my head in, but not really feeling it.
---
I just want the mantis gauntlet.
---
That's not a half bad idea! I'll start work converting my humble camp into the best tavern in Appalachia
---
Absolutely. It's like no-one tested this thing. Yesterday I moved 233 legendaries to a mule. Cue about 25 minutes of faff and the total inability to see danger or caution warnings as you say. QoL Bethesda QoL.
---
Easiest way to know your maxed is using nerd rage. When you see the animation of the guy busting a nut, you're there. Use a gamma gun to manage your max. Shoot the ground to irradiate yourself. +50 rads each shot without armor. Beats sitting in a rad source.
---
*Giggle* "NO U"!
---
I appreciate that some people want the wacky, attention grabbing look, but I think they look like an absolute clown and it actually makes me want to shoot them!!! 🤡
---
Have the wacky outfits but have a balance with more post apocalyptic, tactical, cool looking stuff too.
---
They never said they would not add them. At all, least be real here. All they said is there would be no human npcs at launch as they wanted us to be the only ones there as WE are the humans, yet games evolve and add new content. If you honestly think there will never be human NPC's more power too you. My problem is you keep saying stuff that is just not true. 
---
Also you only interact with robots, terminals and notes. A npc shop mutant hardly counts as you get zero quest and often zero worth of items in his shop. Crazy right?
---
Cause I don't see ghouls, mutant, molemen or scorched giving us quest or adding anything like a static/roaming quest/story given npc could.
---
If you wanna stay locked in you tomb of robots, notes and terminals more power too you. Just stop spreading misinformation, please.
---
I will risk my karma to support this post.
---
Regardless of the crime, unilateral limbo should not be considered an acceptable business process.

Unfortunately this is probably low on their agenda, and you will just have to be patient I am afraid.
---
You want to run around the wastes dressed as Mr Slave?!?
---
You are not missing much. There is only  a sad level 20 deathclaw.
---
I keep seeing 17 and then I'm seeing 18 which one is it . I can only find 17 and yes i did launch a nuke.
---
Thank you. All I'm asking for is communication from Bethesda.
---
So theres a limit to bloodied? Or is it adrenal? Anyways this helps clear thing up a lot. Thank you!
---
Devs would also have to actually make Deathclaw Island a size of a typical small island-- not the one the size of my living room.
---
Should they appreciate it? Yes. Should the support perks work on everyone that's in the event? Yes. Are support roles really relevant for endgame content? Not really.
---
Charisma has a whole host of options to.keep everyone healed, fed, and alive, and even make the enemies easier to kill and do less damage in the meantime, but until those perks apply to everyone in the same event and not just nearby team members, it will be irrelevant.
---
You clearing the adds and reviving people is definitely helpful though. I imagine you used to enjoy playing healz in other games.
---
That’s understandable maybe once they fix it I’ll be back :P

Looking at eso, bans tend to be permanent. A kindly written letter seems to work sometimes. Proclaiming innocence in said letter may not work well.

Well thank you for your comment. I appreciate your input.

Yeah I always end up playing a healer lol
---
And no shame should ever be felt.  I"m lvl. 202 and Yogi's and Mirelurk Kings are what  I respect the most in this game.

I did a SBQ one night, and about an hour later I'm running around, and I get a notification for a legendary item... and it was the damn item I picked up from the queen fight.
---
The fact these legendary item picks up can be *that lagged* can't be good for the rest of the server. The game has tons of lag-related issues, and it seems like Bethesda really hasn't done a lot of fine tuning on them.
---
I think you get the plan after completing one of the BOS missions
---
You can only sell them to vendors for 400 to 500 caps, so don't pay any more than that mate
---
I got you dude

Yea, throw in a bottle cap.

Thanks bro

---
Bro I hate designing my camp in this game if you want to help me put something else together that would be great

I wish Bethesda would make a lot moar weapon skin. I dont buy atom points cuz i dont really care for the costumes or Power Armor paint.
---
DING DING DING WINRAR IS YUO!
---
Those events are frustrating as it is. When all the scorched or ghouls appear they literally spawn on the damn ASAM launcher. By the time you can react, they'll usually have punched the thing to deal within seconds.
---
Yeah there's a limit. Like bloodied sniper rifle can get around 510 without chems (with adrenal). Play around with it, you'll find sitting at \~18% health is a good place. Try not to keep well fed or else you'll lose half of what little health you run with when the buff wears off.
---
Ok I may take a look when I get a chance thanks
---
Depends if a higher level ran by before you showed up.
---
Maxed out STR does you flexibility for melee, shotguns, and (to some extent) heavy weapons, but it doesn't leave enough points in PER or AGL to do much with rifles or pistols.
---
What's your PSN
---
Same as on here
---
What else would you use those levels for though? Not like you actually need them beyond a certain point.
---
..why must everything end in violence..?
---
If I don’t come home to someone playing an instrument in my house at least once during Fo76, I want my money back!!
---
Thats all i want. That and transparency. If im banned, tell me. Don't leave me waiting around just to never find out if ill ever be allowed back on
---
As someone else mentioned, as this game progresses further into MMO territory, specialized roles will become necessary. Tanks, healers, DPS. Honestly if Encryptid had come with a change that made support cards affect all players in an event, it would have made the event so much easier and less frustrating.
---
How about new perks when this prestige system comes out. Or more points if you wish to change your build.
---
Their nuke. Their choice.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
I'm just hoping for larger team sizes or something
---
The right side of the map is generally higher level - travel with caution :)
---
The west side of the map has lower level enemies. There is a lot of exploring to do there. It seems the story pulls you towards high level enemies rather quickly.
---
That isn't true, though. I tested it myself, and you have provided no proof that they are additive.
---
Uh, how'd you get 57.5%? 😂
---
Multiplicative means they get applied one after the other, additive means they get added then applied at the same time.
---
Wow, a lot of useful tips I've just now learned about. I'll keep that stuff in mind and I'll probably be getting adrenal reaction sometime soon.

The only one I would like to see added are the Free State suggestion, because they are the only faction we actually join. We also already have a Mothman event to. The Chinese need a update dedicated to them to give them a story in WV. We are also getting the Pioneer Scouts soon.

Bloody bethesda Easter is a decent event you could of taken advantage of and implemented more fun things.
---
IE : super mutants and or scortched all wearing ridiculous easter outfits and things.
---
Rabbits running around everywhere from normal to diseased, make camp items for easter just like faschnat.
---
its just a ploy to get you to log in everyday and if its not rewarding enough will never be logging in everyday just for an egg hahaha lol at BGS.
---
I think you're misunderstanding the mutation. All it does is increase your damage for having lower health, which is the same thing a Bloodied weapon does, and you get both bonuses at once. Simple as that, both bonuses, no big complication.
---
Now Adrenal Reaction does have a side effect, but all it does is lower your maximum HP, nothing else, just a -50 to your Max, no halving or anything like that involved.
---
you're right! i thought exactly the same thing, ie it was much too big a jump in difficulty. i went back to the area to the nw area and hung around there until i was strong enough to compete with the enemies at the top of the world...

I was thinking like keep teams the same and then make a larger Raid Group, maybe 8-10 players. Also, instance events so it can actually be organized, or make a group finder like in WoW. Would make the fights more cohesive and make it easier to report players who don't do anything at all etc.
---
We need an actual raid area first lol
---
Oh, I saw it as -50%. That makes it a lot less of a problem for me.
---
Between us, you just want the keys to Todd Howard's home
---
Ya it's an amazing mutation, everyone should rock it even without Bloodied Weapons 🤣
---
This was easy to accomplish, too, because many vendors stock Sugar Bombs.
---
This has been here an hour and nobody has said it yet? Bloody hell you lot are slipping.  
---
*Ahem*  
---
FUCK CAZADORS!!!
---
What we need is a lvl 91 deathclaw to be some sort of challenge. Yao guai and Radscorpions are harder to take down, especially in melee combat.

My friend is coming to sell you it his name is zombie

Having a lower tier is fine if you want to try out builds with different perk levels.

I have one and yes the do

I’ve been trying to get a trenchcoat like the one Nick gives you in FO4, but i havent found one, meaning my ‘suave detective’ look is incomplete

&gt; no breaking of more important things

So just cancel the maintenance then?
---
Don't forget about me! Member #3 right here...
---
I've been running Rifleman on a BE Hardened Handmade. Many things are 1 shots. Glowing ones are triple tap and I VATS a fair bit
---
Is the Automatic worth the ammo? If the damage that much better?
---
If you're low level (and can keep from getting killed), the 20%XP boost is nice. I stacked it with well rested and cranberry relish and jumped 5 levels in less than 2 hours the other day.
---
I thought Burrows was decent nuked?
---
To late homie.
---
I had that yesterday at Whitesprings but only the distance textures. Then today in Flatwood with selected close up ground textures. Odd but kind of snowy looking.
---
This week isn't so bad. 
---
The leader board revealing the top three is kind of important factor. For now it is player kills that reveals you, meaning you can easily track and avoid killers, conversely if you don't kill anyone you won't show up on the map at all, meaning it's a quiet time where you can be relatively safe outside high traffic areas, there is still some risk of course, but unless you take workshops or go to events then you can more or less avoid people entirely.
---
Previously it used time alive, meaning you ended up getting shown and hunted down regularly on the hour almost, as griefers cycled through the server constantly killing whoever was on top.
---
They plan to rotate through the leader boards, so we will see when they change it how the next one goes.
---
I heard the burrows is full of glowing bloated
---
I dont think harpers ferry is a waste if u can hit the burrows
---
Or the Quarry from NV. An area that truly is challenging.
---
I did it on survival once i hit level 50 with all my chems and alcohol and my Anti Materiel rifle and my Oh Baby!...rolled in with Boone amd Rex and still died multiple times to the Matriarch....(decided to stop killing her babies first to eventually win)
---
The mounted wendigo isnt gotten from the quest started at toxic joes, you get the mystery meat pie from that one. The mounted windgo can be attained by activating the quest at the same hotel in the mire where the robot gives you idle bombs quest. One of the tables l
---
Close to him will have an issue of C.H. Monthly January. Read that and the quest starts. Pass for computet is MARI1117.
---
I've gotten random mutations from low rad sources many times, especially when lvling a low character. I think you were just godly lucky my man.
---
True. If it was a "let's find out" run OK.
---
Please don't misunderstand me, I don't hate female players. I just think Bethesda is focusing on cosmetic aspects, rather than fixing the real problems. I'll admit I could have chosen my words more carefully. Take care.
---
How's the exterminator perk? I always have a hard time committing to a perk that only affects 1 type of enemy.
---
Search the words "deck" or "loadout" and you will see approximately 105,398.6 threads since BETA asking for this very thing.  Bethesda has unfortunately shown no indication that they plan on implementing it.
---
There is already a mod to do it on PC.
---
Daily challenges like this make me think Bethesda maybe has a 10 year old coming up with them.
---
I mean, Savage Divide... there's not exactly man places these spawn... but that they also want FIVE of them... really?
---
My 10 year old drew up a treasure hunt for her younger sister this weekend (and me :P ) but failed to work out that there was only 1 golf ball in the entire house... needless to say I lost. :)
---
Middle Mountain Cabins is being spammed with server hops... the Cave Cricket only took 1 server hop and it was like 100m in front of me as I spawned... a bit too easy...
---
Anyway... hopefully in my 'prime time' server time there won't be too many people hopping servers at MMC... at least it's only those two mob ones... two camera ones and the usual levelling one - though I've worked out that the ragged clown outfit does not count (in PA?)... and when they say mines/caves... Belching Betty does not count...
---
I hate reddit bots so damn much. 
---
And the mods on this sub are ass and randomly decide what posts gets removed, as hardly anyone follows and/or enforces those rules anyway.
---
West Tek is already high level like others said. I've gotten no legendaries there, and then up to 7-8 legendaries there. Pretty random, but certainly not worth nuking.
---
I'm just going to keep asking for a blood spattered skin (like the current one for combat armor) for my Raider PA.
---
Good to hear. It's nice to switch between pew-pew and explore and build. My nephews just play pew-pew :p
---
I'm not complaining about them releasing it during the server maintenance but if they released it before it goes live they might be able to make a few changes based on how it is precieved.
---
Wait..pc has mods??
---
I have 9 per, and have considered a weapons master build. It wouldn't be too difficult if you planned it out. Even considering different builds that's not enough of a reason. You can't change anything about the story or have a different ending
---
Rubberduckie91 I play with a few guys who are pretty high level. We are knots always doing a nuke event or sheepsquach or something like that. Cool dudes.
---
MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT
---
I keep it on for mirelurk kings and queens, but I swap it for glow sights if I’m running nuked whitesprings or similar. I’m at a level where I’ve got most every possible perk I could want to use, so I swap around frequently depending on the situation.
---
Theoretically, sure that's how it would work in adventure mode. Not survival since they decided to over nerf the cap loss...
---
Good luck getting that high though...
---
Today is my first day going 0 for 5 on the dailies.

and she regenerates 3/4 of that, so deal \~175k damage

Well I'm going to start doing it after this kerfluffle.  It's dumb, because suspending a game and quickly resuming it is the preferred way to handle it and to regress from this behavior is user-hostile, but whatever.  I'll accept losing out on a couple of minor cosmetic items now, with the hopes that I won't miss future content I really care about.
---
Dude. Thank you. Been struggling with this forever.
---
I get a lot of random invites. Sometimes I’ll accept them. The ones I find weird are when they invite you but never speak to me or join up with me 🤷‍♀️  I’ll leave them on my team until they leave just to use Inspirational and get the extra XP.  Or I get very low levels that need help, which I don’t mind.
---
&gt; When I make my way to the Top of the World, enemies are now level 36-40. 
---
Starting a fresh alt, I've found level 68 supermutants there. It happens. 
---
Server hoopers (most with 3 digit characters) target the two vendors there, causing top enemies to spawn in the area.
---
If you want an easy main quest run, just server hoop yourself for a server with your own spawn of mobs.
---
Tell me about these outcasts
---
Last night on one of my characters ( level 119) i decided to do my fire breather quest finally. I hung around belching betty in case anyone else was nearby low level because everything spawned to level 68 inside. I kept clearing it and no one showed up. I felt bad but left to go do top of the world. My apologies to anyone low level who couldn't finish it due to that.
---
Avoid negative press...for a few hours?
---
The advantage would to make adjustments or delay changes based on feedback they get. Obviously it wouldn't make a huge difference but it would have an impact.
---
Good point.
---
Survival is about running faster than your other teammates - GG :D
---
Is that what your T-shirt says
---
Wasn’t this called Spiked armor in fo4?
---
South of the pumpkin house, just down the road
---
From what I've seen, the *intended* route is forest -&gt; ash heap/toxic valley (both seem about the same, toxic valley has higher level potential spawns but they are rare) -&gt; savage divide -&gt; mire -&gt; cranberry bog. The top of the world is also a very frequent destination for higher level players, so they could have spawned in the higher level enemies before you got there
---
...with Deathclaw themed restaurant, Deatheclaw inspired rides and Deathclaw plushies if you win the Deathclaw toss.
---
Actually there are only 5 mounted head to unlock.
---
Pretty sure it's Watoga, maybe someone else just got there first? Have you hopped servers a couple times already?
---
I don't want it to go that far. I just need the almost spoiled food to properly be on top so I can munch it quick. Nothing else you are talking about is a time limited scenario that I encounter on a daily basis.
---
I didn't like the modded solutions for armor naming and all that...  It's just irrelevant to me. I don't hoard that shit so it's not a problem.
---
I've said this in other posts. It's almost certainly the cause. Luckily I've only lost some apparel and nothing too great.
---
Is that the cave near the pumpkin house also near that scorch beast spawn?
---
I really don't give a fuck about the implementation details.
---
wow..i sell.ally stuff on reddit
---
Hi u/ladydevann, any headway made into BOS plans?
---
Or King and Queen Mirelurks
---
&gt; butt-hurt, entitled bullshit
---
Irony.
---
Yeah I saw it in a juice head vid and i was curious
---
i'm very tempted by making the handmade automatic, but:
---
1) i hate the way half the receiver suddenly becomes invisible;
---
2) the weapon deteriorates far too quickly;
---
3) it makes the game far too easy and i like a challenge
---
4) the powerful automatic receiver has the wrong stats, ie it has the same damage as the one that also increases the critical damage  (the 'tweaked' one)
---
I could google this, but scrub #3 would like to know what this is.
---
Ok thank this is perfect
---
Can we get the FO3 leather armor?
---
I cant do shit, either ):
---
I didn't know about energy weapons not dropping with explosive anymore. The only really good find I've gotten is a tse gatling laser I've kept in my inventory since they boosted durability. It's not good for much besides tagging, but it will tag everything you point it in the general direction of, multiple times.
---
Oh its beautiful, Im extremely tempted but TSE handmade with Tank Killer stun locks most opponents in pvp and is my only option to survive the weekly legendary drops so I'm going to have to turn down this offer.
---
x-01 mod plans aren't in the game. You probably mean a T-Series jetpack
---
How do I join?
---
I love NCR gear. I'd drop atoms on that.
---
Will the severs ever be fixed better? Been playing this game since the game has came out everyday and not one day has gone by that this game has not crashed on me EVER.
---
Same here. Had some great times with randos
---
I did earlier today for the same reason.
---
agreed. I could see torn capes with hoodies or stuff like that as well for apocalyptic-sniper-builds. we need more immersive customization indeed
---
Last night I went to lucky hole mine, and there was a 2 star, level 1 legendary rad roach out front. After giggling at the absurdity for a minute I killed him and was rewarded with a 2 star hunting rifle that had quad ammo capacity and lower VATS cost. I pimped it out and gave it to a level 3 person wandering around near Flatwoods.
---
Many of the quests have legendary weapons/armor as rewards, several of which are useful at low levels.
---
Player vending is on the way at some point. I'm keeping my known plans for that day.
---
xD
---
I don't think it's the game. maybe it's your ps4. he's dying
---
r/fo76marketplace
---
Are a few trading hubs
---
Enemies come in discrete levels. Some enemies have higher level variants.
---
Super mutants highest level variation is level 68, deathclaws 91, molerats only go up to level 21. It is entirely dependant on the specific enemies, the highest level enemy should be the scorchbeast queen at level 95
---
One of my characters got a bunch of clothing the first time she got to flatwoods. I don't remember most of it now, but I had her wearing the BOS Scribe gear for a while.
---
Do you have an image?
---
Upvote because I too can't get into these masks in the slightest!
---
1tb ps4 slim. I blame game lmao
---
I've had it happen before, but I think its a single server going down for one reason or another, was still able to join up on a new one.
---
Its an old term, been thrown around here before. Props to whoever came up with it first, may interloper smile upon thee.
---
I would *buy* Atoms for literally anything from FNV. 
---
Assault Carbine skin for combat rifle? Ranger Sequioa for .44? Let me get my card
---
Just what I was looking for, thank you!
---
As with all the posts with this specific "badass" request....
---
I'm fine with the weird and the wacky. It's better than "badass" aka boring, cliche, overdone.  
---
See the badass bone armour.
---
If you get a random invite I’m just trying to share 3 points of blocker in return of the sweet sweet bodyguards card
---
Not a chance, with the challenges repeatedly asking us to kill that specific Deathclaw, they’ve got no time to reproduce.
---
Well once any developer gets rich they get bored and go into unique hobbies such yiffing.
---
I like the idea of perk cards more than just infinite leveling and unlocking every perk. However, because you can switch perk cards on the fly, it creates the exact same issue but with more tedious menu manipulation.
---
Like, is there anything that your character can’t do? If you have at least 3 perception, 3 charisma, 5 intelligence, 3 agility, and 3 luck, you have access to every perk card that lets you interact with the game world. Ie, all the looting perks, all the crafting perks, etc. Maybe you can’t swap weapon types on the fly, and maybe there’s a few perk combos that don’t work for you, but otherwise most builds can do most things. 
---
I chose to make a crafting build with 15 intelligence, and I like it for the roleplay, but it really showed me there’s basically no reason to go over 5 Int on any character unless you really want demo expert AND gunsmith for a heavy weapon explosives build, or something like that. I learn mods by scrapping pretty fast, but otherwise I am exactly as good at crafting as 90% of players. In fact, the best thing I have going for me is the level 50 Super Duper perk, which is in luck :/
---
Always get annoyed when they warp away after I shred 80% of their health.
---
To be fair: I think the Imposter Sheepsquatch suit is a pretty good ‘badass’ contrast to the ‘goofy’ Mascot outfit
---
I give them away to low players/ anyone who waves at me. I workshop alot for plans so I always have duplicates
---
I wanna say that's where I got mine too.
---
I hope they will add some taxidermy quest with tomorrow's patch. It's mean we can have more mounted.
---
I swear I read somewhere that grenadier doesn’t apply to explosive weapon modifier, only to grenades and naturally explosive weapons.
---
God yes it's so annoying
---
Wait what? How have I missed this?
---
Could u link us?
---
Agree with you OP. I posted this same thought like a week ago. 
---
I want my red BOS knight outfit back.
---
I got all but the firecracker variants,
---
I have multiple of the same recipe as well , I’m starting to believe firecracker might be bugged
---
I just have my level 3 travelling pharmacy shared all the time. I can immediately over encumbered my friend by unsharing it. I try to not use this power for evil. 🤣
---
Don't question it, just throw it on the steaming pile of shit they should have caught and fixed during QC testing. My last SBQ reward was a fucking 1 star ghoul slayer's gamma gun, which has to be the stupidest combination imaginable.
---
I think so. There was a cage armor and a spiked armor, and I believe they both looked like this but with very slight differences. Oddly enough, I don’t think it drops in 76 yet I’ve seen many raider corpses wearing it...
---
You're welcome. Glad you came out.
---
I send you many kisses Bethesda.
---
No worries.  I’ll keep it around (killing low level ghouls in the forest... def not specd for pistols) if you change your mind or if I can sweeten the deal.  ;)
---
Brilliant
---
I have one of these pretty heavy it does benefit from rifle perks but in field test a higher rof and larger magazine makes the tse a slow combat rifle
---
You guys can add me: 
---
Javijr9 have a buddy i play with but thats about it 
---
We both high level
---
Have any x01 cal shocks?
---
Yeah this has happened to me...I always play right until the end...I figure it’s a good time to solo whitesprings
---
The player vending is supposed to drop next month. I'm hanging on to my goods for the moment.
---
Honestly, this suggestion has been made tons of times already. At this point, it is either somewhere on the "to-do list" or it just isn't going to happen. I would guess it is never going to happen, because the trend in this game is moving to a bigger grind to keep people playing and spending. Started with a nerf to xp gain and spawn rate, then nerf to repair, then making food spoil faster. I feel it is safe to say these things are no accident. They could take all these community ideas and make the game less annoying to play and make maintenance easier, or they could add something to the cash shop to make it all better and slowly increase the need for them in game.

Server hop at flatwoods. 2 different suits (dirty tan and patched dirty IIRC) are among the clothing that can spawn on the bed in the church.
---
I can't recall any company holding off a patch based on feedback they get in a 24-48hr window. If they have it's far from the norm.
---
Agreed. Where the hell is my bumper sword?!?
---
What do you want for it?
---
Integrity is primordial
---
The quills were also in a Brahmin due south of the tanners shack by the pool in Toxic Valley
---
It's all about play style.  I run a sniper build and kill most things in 1 or 2 bullets.  My buddy runs a full auto builds and eats through ammo. I personally prefer slower fire but higher damage
---
Weren't we supposed to get something if collect all 6?
---
Pretty sure they removed the stair exploit I think youre referring to. I noticed it once they started messing with firepits
---
Ah, I'm so used to people taking things way too seriously around here I did not spot the sarcasm. First successful ISS I got some shitty 1* armour that I posted about on here, to be told I hadn't collectes enough data. Silly me, playing a game for fun.
---
 I've gotta admit despite the mostly horrendous rng I actually had my first decent weapon drop for the right character from that boss. I suppose once in 1300 hours aint bad.
---
There is an element of level scaling, it just depends on who's in the area when you encounter the enemies. I haven't seen a single level 10-15 enemy at whitesprings since the game launched.
---
Your assumption is incorrect. The vendor caps reset every 20 real time hours, regardless of how many hours you've played the game. There is a weird glitch where sometimes the vendor will show zero caps, but if you sell something you'll get money and their cap pool will update to show what they actually have. If it's been more than 20 hours and it shows 0, this is probably the issue.
---
That's probably coming via QoL micro transactions. Just like the rest of our suggestions
---
But the kicker is: NONE of your cyborg augments stack with Power Armor (similar to normal armor pieces), but DO stack with  normal armor, mutations and perk cards. Meaning they're only active when not wearing PA.
---
Or maybe some are and aren't, idk. 
---
Like augments for night vision, strength, dermal armor, and rad resist would be cool. You could finally walk into a nuke zone, no PA, no Hazmat Suit, your cerbernerically augmented head held high.
---
Also... GuN hAnDs! Think Automatron... but peeeeoooppplleee!
---
Wow, still crying 2 days later.
---
It's the Helmeted Cage Armor in Fallout 4. This atom shop version does have different textures though.
---
People will still find ways to hunt other player I got a lower level character with explosive weapons trying to sneak and burst what sounded like a tse handmade , jumped in to water and just left the mode ...
---
I could had turn around and killed him but I’m not one to loose time with another player as my primary objective is the actual hostile npcs , not gonna baby sit somebody else’s kids lol
---
This reminds me so much of [Get Down by Groove Armada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWY2ume21TQ)...
---
Nah they won't ignore it. They took that idea, put it on a wall, and are gonna charge you 1400 atoms for it
---
No , as an atom store item , dropping will destroy it

If you missed an egg then that is it. You miss out. It’s for the dedicated ones to the game.

I don't why I'm got downboted due to exposing a flaw in the leveling system. Level up are supposed to reward you for playing not punish you.

Sent requests to everyone here. IGN Robofox5
---
Weird flex but k.
---
I think it was ok given you got 6 eggs for free ( pointless ) and a bunny mask ( mask go on atom store for like around 4 dollars )
---
So I’m taking more or less a 4 dollar freebie not bad
---
Whore Island.
---
I've been only hoarding 3* armor pieces and weapons that have reduced weight perk. And all 3* heavy weapons with bear arms equipped go in my inventory. I'm busting at the seams and just hoping it will pay off somehow.
---
I had somebody snipe him there last time I found him. He did it when I was going up to the vendor bot though so I didn't even get to buy the clocks or see what else he had.
---
Yeah they did. Foundations weren't designed to be stacked
---
You mean removing the fun elements.
---
Don't know anything about having someone else craft what you're missing, might be true, but if you just missed a day or more, then yes you don't get the free completion award.
---
What about other related quests to the Enclave or Brotherhood?
---
Great... Since the atomic shop refresh is so janked many people missed egg one or two so that it?  Seems really scuffed if Twitter was late and the launch page wasn’t up to date.
---
I dont see why they had to go mess with firepits without giving us planters. But I guess thats a lot to ask for.
---
Cool, I've got a bunch but not all. It's kind of amazing going through my perk cards and realizing how many there are that I've never even equipped.
---
I love all of this. +1
---
Yeah I’ve heard people saying that others have crafted the eggs and other have the shop shows that they “bought” the egg.
---
I know that feeling ... once I hit the wall.
---
Days are solely on , maybe a new character and build him a perfect perk build.
---
Go to main character collect dailies and weekly challenges and good bye.
---
I loved it while it was things to explore but at this point I’m sure I’ve been everywhere and seen almost everything.
---
Only thing that ails me is that I’m still not able to get those goddammed Camden tokens.
---
I just want Mr. fuzzy costume and that’s it
---
There's something similar in the school versus event. If you stand near a shack or something the ghouls will ignore you mostly.
---
The wacky cosmetics are for fortnite kids, they look horrible.
---
Dunno. Your best bet would be to try that out yourself, finding someone who has any eggs you don't. 
---
If it works, be sure to come back and show proof hereso people can know the workaround.
---
Yeah, I’m on PC so I can build 12 quick-swap decks of perks with Perk Loadout Manager, so that is *most* of my perk swapping. There’s a few things I still do manually though.
---
Produce berry mentats to give them the SHARINGON
---
I’ve gotten tons of good plans here. Handmade, MG42, deathclaw guantlet, etc etc. 
---
There’s no reason not to warp here every day or two and see what you get. It also helps that the Encryptid event is so close. While you’re server hopping to reset safe inventory (new items will appear if you don’t take anything from the safe), you’ll often run into at least one of those events.
---
Brain fungus, the trenches south of Watoga are best. Hundreds there. Firecaps rare but all over the forest. Look for them on fallen logs.
---
Will do.
---
I have a lvl 50 shotgun with two shot, its the best shot gun I've had drop and i modified it the best i could. In a few weeks I've burned off about 3k shells with it, mostly because i needed a break from melee.
---
You get a free bunny head that you have to craft. It’s not much of a loss. I was hoping for something deathclaw related. A deathclaw mask would have been awesome.
---
Don't think that many people missed it. Ones that missed an egg via bug are very vocal tho
---
Rug glitch still works from FO4.
---
I'm gonna nuke.... A lake.
---
Rug glitch still works last I checked.
---
I think the leather hat was (maybe still is)in the atom shop. Didn't have a badge or anything tho, just leather
---
Yeah but the collector in me wants it. Even if it’s just a costume.
---
🤣 Don't worry, already on it. Think I had 20 of each flavour Mentats at the end of today's session.
---
Doesn't it suck that you are always competing against other players for spawns? Feels like no matter the circumstance, encountering other players is always a negative.
---
So we just have it in our crafting - we don't have to claim it in the Atomic shop?
---
Seems like a lot. On Xbox mostly. A lot of the people in a few the discord groups I’m in have missed egg 1 or 2 as they didn’t get notifications of the eggs until egg2 release
---
Yes I do agree my weapons are solely non auto , i probably didn’t set the example right.
---
I have this piece and it’s wonderful and deviating , but at level 68 or more the enemies require 3 shots or maybe 2 or 1 depending on perk set up , the clip size is limited and the reload speed slow in comparison to a handmade with the same prefixes non auto and a larger clip you might be loosing 20 damage per shot or so but at the long run in a minute you’re able to make more damage with a larger rate of fire ( rof)
---
Yea. There’s that. I’ve never been much of a cosmetic person myself. I think I did Helvetia maybe four times and said not worth the time. If they made different versions and had a rarity/trade factor, maybe I’d be a little more enthusiastic.
---
I guess so.
---
Yep, I've brought this up in many threads. For a game that is supposed to highly encourage group play, Fallout 76 makes seeing other players almost always a negative thing. The best thing that can happen to me is if I get on a "dead" server, which only happens once in a while. If I have a server with no one else on it, I can do wonders.
---
Rug glitch?? Isn't it a flat object what is glitchy on it?
---
Hi ! Share pictures of your arcade my mind was blown by reading it hahaha
---
Same. I did Fasnacht mainly to see if someone DID get one of the “rare” masks.
---
Ooh, Jesus Christ!

Me waiting for that mod fix for mods

Bethesda is now Activision

Ill check it out thanks

There should be a ready up zone that allows group events if wished
---
I've gotten a mutation while I was inside a building while there was a radstorm going on outside it.
---
Yo, How do you add Brotherhood to your r/
---
You cant craft atom shop items for other people.
---
I conquered the Workshop near Flatwoods and produced some free Sugar Bombs. I'm cheap.
---
I personally like the lever action.  It's got great damage with decent fire rate and with speed demon reloading isnt bad and the ammo is really common.  A guass with the right perks tho can be really good I just havent found one I would ever use
---
Sweet :P

This is amazing, I hope you use lots of stealth boys and something like his signature pistol.

Maybe even try sounding like him on headset lol

I believe it was either post glass cavern or post military ID.
---
It's the experience, not necessarily the products, that make Graham and Chally the Moo Moo worth it.
---
This is heresy!
---
Something needs to happen feels like a missed opportunity
---
What reference???
---
You have to craft it like all other helmets and masks in the armor work bench
---
I gotta Vita that doesn't charge and a pstv, use remote play on both. when I can hold the wire just right, and check it every 2 minutes to make sure it's charging, then find out after a few days of this it's charged to 10%, and I use my pstv anyway.  yay pstv
---
Does it automatically just give it to me
---
Yes I do.
---
Oh, jesus chtist!
---
Pretty sure you have to put alot of dmg into the queen so it rewards you more it seems to me I get ultracite plans and legendary weapons
---
My plan when play vending comes around is simple. Sell the chems relatively cheap and the addictol horrendously expensive.
---
Its coming back when bethesda fixes it
---
I have Starched genes lvl 2 and opened a perk pack and got a lvl 1 starched genes. I wish there was some sort of reroll system in place so we can reroll our unused perk cards (at the cost of caps of course)
---
If you had them all then yes it will just show up
---
Take my caps
---
Support

build your plant you want out on dirt, then take a rug and place it next to the plant so it touches and they connect, then pick them up together and move them to where ever you want the plant to be and as long as you pick it up by the rug you can place it pretty much anywhere, ignoring the need for dirt.
---
Ill be at a Job Interview while the game is offline.
---
I know. Hence the post. Was confirming the eggs weren’t an exception to the rule.
---
Wasn’t there a new one discovered that uses the confetti as a stacking medium?
---
2 days? My, has it really been so long? 
---
Well, I'll just consider this my good act for the week. I'm always willing to help out those less fortunate than myself. 
---
Hmm, although, of it has been two days, and you still haven't given an intelligible response, maybe I'm not doing as well as I assumed.
---
Are the words I'm using to big?
---
Gah, sorry, let me try that again. ME WORDS TOO BIG? ME TALK BITTY WORDS!
---
900 GUY MAKE BOOBOO. HE DID BAD THING AND GOT ~~PUNISHED~~ ~~BANNED~~ ~~SPANKED~~ (whew, this is harder than I thought! It's ok, Jane Goodall was patient, and look how it worked for her) WAS A BAD BOY. NO BE 900 GUY
---
Yeah, I'm just saying I don't have a strong opinion about it.  But, imo, thr SBQ really should be a 3* drop given how much expenditure goes into taking her down.
---
Me and my mate were terrified as we swam over to 'Deathclaw Island'. We left dissapointed.
---
Though later down the line, I walked into a cave and a chameleon Deathclaw just snapped me in half. So I guess I got my harrowing experience eventually.
---
Yep I hop all three until I get a plan I want from each then I move on to other stuff :)
---
Here you go, not sure if it still works. But it worked recently and they never said anything about patching it.
---
https://youtu.be/sahlOICt5e0?t=191
---
Deathclaw Island?  Don't worry, it's just a name.
---

---
What was your radiation resistance?
---
Just give us a mission reward style pop-up, and give us the option to enable/disable it. also treasure maps.
---
The Atomic Shop updates at 5pm EST.  The only jank is that you have to restart the game in order to see it.
---
Cool. I like to confuse the ghouls with long stairs. They just walk two steps and try to turn. So stupid and rarely make it to the top. I love testing the AI.
---
I make most of my caps selling Plans and outfits to other players- I would definitely give it a shot!
---
Perk loadout manager is a huge QOL increase. Especially now that F76 has a simple version of a script extender and we no longer need to manually create a build on nukes and dragons and save the URL into a config file now for PLM.  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
Yet you've offered no proof, only tears.
---
I only have 4 of the eggs but it let me craft it today?? I was surprised because I was trying to craft some armor and it just popped up...
---
Hope that it's a full outfit and not a raider armor paint/skin like the combat/metal/leather ones.
---
About to say, I know I have encountered a pair of deathclaws there on more than one occasion.
---
Individual servers can go down for maintenance from time to time, outside of the normal Tuesday maintenance.
---
Her loot table is trash, she's just a time/resource sink. Better off farming any other enemies than her, I soloed The Imposter Sheepsquatch in 3 minutes, it has the same loot table besides flux drops.
---
Wait I got all six eggs. Where's my bunny head?
---
But I love farming gears there!
---
Be nice if I could install my x-01 calibrated shocks.
---
Is this faction still going strong?
---
Yes. Handmade has a gentle fire rate and you can still easily tap to shoot only one bullet. 
---
Anyway you can always come back to single shot.
---
That'd be sweet. Shame the NCR won't be around until the end of the century.
---
Yes you could ve right. So many reports of tmussing items are getting down voting but ur explanation could ve the problem. People need to stop down voting these post. Glad this one's taking off.
---
Don’t get me started with the lever action hahaha the beauty of this weapon is the high accuracy and the ability to make a 45. Round go in to crazy damage with the ability to shoot all rounds back to back and to reload in between makes it almost like an endless clip
---
When will you be on and what's your psn
---
I actually managed to recreate it and record it so ive sent that off to them too now, it cost me a calibrated excavator leg though :(
---
How does a giant Easter bunny head qualify as Fallout content? Excuse me for believing we could have fallout content in a fallout game, instead of yet Another giant head mask. 
---
How many is there now? 12? 20? 
---
It’s not just the Easter content- this whole Wild Appalachia content has been a bust. 
---
Two features delayed. One of them a camera in a game that has been pushing pictures from the start. How useful. More bugs breaking simple mechanics that used to work. Literally impossible to complete Atom shop challenges because they don’t double check their work (or don’t care). A mini boss that drops legendary loot same as whitespring ghoul. A sewer level of as much consequence as any other interior. Dumping more robot vendors in whitespring in the most bland, unimaginative, and lazy way possible. 
---
BIV is the only saving grace (and the raider excavator PA), but that work bench is only so useful. 
---
So go ahead and pat Bethesda on the back for this half baked effort. They’ll be super stoked to know you’ll eat up absolutely anything they dish out.
---
I can get online now what’s your psn? Mine is the same as on here
---
I prefer stinging. My handmade has the perk of of extra armor when reloading so i enjoy all the time it takes.
---
Fo76 market is more active and keeps a blacklist so trades rarely go wrong. Just so you know :)
---
The armor was repurposed LAPD riot armor, so it was technically pre-war
---
I honestly dont know why its damage is higher then the hunting rifle. I feel like it should be in between the combat and hunting rifle
---
This worked great, I got it completed in 3 server hops.
---
It was so long ago I don't know for sure, but since it was so early in the game I'd guess low to non existent.
---
Keep the grog ax for queen battles.
---
They didn’t even care to hotfix the mod bug . You think they care about giving you free atoms?
---
Anything would be nice. I shudder to think on the Atoms we've missed out on, I'm pretty diligent about getting my daily's done
---
This is literally 1 string change. Lets wait for next big patch to change it. I don't understand why Bethesda can't fix everything fast
---
The obvious thing to do , would be to make it a radio station like hunter/hunted
---
They're not gonna give us free atoms. Best case scenario, they increase the value of this week's daily and weekly challenges to compensate. But I don't really think anything's gonna happen.
---
Yeah, I'd be cool with the riot armour, without the NCR trappings. Just mean in general. I miss the NCR. (and human NPCs in general.)
---
Think it's time to play NV again haha
---
My PSN is mgs_otacon and I'll probably be on later tonight, looking like after 10:30pm EST
---
I'll give you 500 caps for that hat!
---
I got another one of these the other day from a safe. Xb1 if you want to buy it cheap.
---
Isn't the surprise the bunny head you can craft in the armor workbench?
---
Still works, been doing it this whole time.  Worked on my crops, water purifier, and my fertilizer pit, not sure what else it would need to work on.
---
They fixed the bug that let players skip the majority of the silo. The time investment vs reward just isn't worth it now.
---
Yes because I can rapid sneak attack the Queen with melee but if adds get too close I lose \[caution\] till they die :(
---
It was a bug, when the lights were released they were not the nuka pattern in terms of glow until they added the Nukashine DLC. I'm glad they fixed it because it actually caused lag with all the flashing patterns overlaying eachother; the nuka pattern should be unique to the nuka lamp. I bought white string lights afterall not nuka string lights.
---
i personally didn't like NV, the world felt way too...dead, i love urban/forest wastelands like appalachia, but that's just me, still a great game, cant argue with that
---
I have a 4\* Furious armor piercing hunting rifle i'll sell.  When are you going to be on XB1?
---
I just got a bloodied ripper to 312 with full unyielding at 30 str
---
So mean so efficient.
---
Could you be on around 9 EST tomorrow I have some stupid timer making my get off at 9:30 EST on weekdays
---
Do you have any tips or how-tos for optimizing DPS you could share or places you could point to with advanced tips? I'm 115 and do my best (read here and everywhere I can), but I feel like I could go further, especially when reading about your team.
---
Are you sure?  I checked and it wont let me craft
---
where the FUCK are the Rangers!?
---
Yeah I got no items when I did it, thank god my friend has 6 alt accounts full of max level legendary loot.
---
As far as I can tell there is no easy way to find out who completes these challenges and who doesn't.
---
Personally I don't.
---
If they were to 'compensate' for the hiccup by giving away atoms they would just be giving me free stuff.
---
Perhaps increase the reward for completing the relevant dailies/weeklies for the next week by 10 atoms would be a nice gesture; handouts would just be another flavour of unfairness.
---
I would like to see more done with Rose anyway.
---
Positive...... because I thought I had missed out even though I’ve been on everyday but still only managed to get 4 eggs. I have the mask now.....
---
Yeah me neither, makes it hard to kill those golfer ghouls
---
My god I have to try that it sounds like imagination to soar right there.
---
So you know most of the people who plays this game
---
Careful. You might cut yourself on all of that edge, kiddo.
---
Huh well I'm gonna try placing them and see if it works
---
Wouldn’t they have a phone number for customer complaints? Can’t you go that route? You’ve got to get more traction going that route than sending an email.
---
I hear you there! Who cares anymore, just nuke where you please. The ones that wine, are the ones that are only out to poach your kills, and farm your XP!
---
I'm not really telling him how to play, but suggesting that maybe he rushed through it.  I'm fully aware nine hours is a lot of time to accomplish a lot however, depending on the quest you're going through, nine hours might only grant you a little actual success.  I'm also not saying that he can't voice his disappointment when he's gotten to the level he's at and can't find anything else to do. I did however suggest perhaps to devote his time elsewhere and wait for the devs to release more content for him to go play.
---
There's 2 of those outfits already in the game. Admittedly they're a ridiculously rare drop from dailies that are mostly bugged, but they're in there.
---
yea it's already out lol been out since yesterday it's just the bunnyhead it's in your armor bench
---
The best thing I've found is a level 40 3 star bloodied baseball bar with swing speed and +1STR. With adrenaline, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, radicool, and a full set of unyielding armor I'm over 2k damage per swing.
---
What’s even stranger........ I never placed the eggs at my camp because my budget is currently maxed and I haven’t made any changes recently..
---
I swear every time I take the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop, it gets attacked by hordes of rad scorpions and they tend to be all around that area in general.
---
Was west tech in the zone?
---
Lol there are no bullet sponges, everything in this game is too easy to kill after level 50.
---
I believe you are referring to the effect of a card that applies to a team, whereas I am referring specifically to sharing cards with your team and their ability to use the shared card (which is universally applied regardless of distance).  If shared Rad Sponge is still something other teammates have even if across the map, though having that perk would be useless if no teammates are in proximity for the effect to matter (however, in a team of 4 that split into groups of 2 there would still be a benefit).
---
It really chaps your ass when people get that wrong doesn’t it?
---
I can't even find the eggs anyway so rip
---
Not to discredit the idea, its a good one, but...
---
I love that a BGS representative replies to a suggestion on ** the one game aspect directly tied to making them more money**. Seemingly the first "we'll pass that along" reply I've seen in about a week.
---
"Glaring bugs, booooriiiiing. Wait what? Did someone say we could be making MORE MONEY??! Hot damn I'm calling Todd"
---
Love you guys, I just think its funny, thats it. By all means make that cashflow to support new content!
---
I think I read they are by the death claw statue in decorations
---
Interesting theory, and Idea! The game may break those.
---
I would spend so much irl money for actual good looking normal outfits instead of this fortnite shit that’s in the atomic shop rn
---
Only in player vending though
---
And the anti material rifle. Since the 50 in fo76 is absolute garbage
---
I should be good for that
---
You also got XP....
---
🤢it’s fugly
---
What’s with my cards after I share them it shows it on my name then fades away and I’m no longer sharing them?
---
Ok see you tomorrow thank you
---
It's not a game for trolls.
---
I hoped for something SPECIAL like say one of those rare Fasnacht masks or a 3 star legendary kickass weapon.
---
But no it's a wabbit mask.
---
At least it only has one ear - which is cool.
---
No wonder why that quest never clears for me I was reading it wrong the whole time lol
---
I don't know either. But there are tons of things in the game that don't make sense but this sub Reddit will defend to the death.
---
Meh i have had my home there bk when i needed black titanium just placed a shit ton of rocket launcher turrets and let them do the work
---
Ah.  That explains why it "disappeared."  Thanks.
---
it is, but it is poorly mentioned. not many people know about it without exploring their headgear section or armor benches.. or being told on Reddit
---
In about 1 hour.
---
Aside from player cosmetic items, I think this could be said of CAMP decor as well.  We see a lot of "clean" things on the Atom Shop but I think it would be nice to have some of the scuffed/improvised stuff we see around the world.  The chair lift sofa, for example.
---
Bring back every weapon from previous fallout titles. Wacky weapons are like half the fun of borderlands, why not do it here? (Shout out to wacky weapons workshop mod from Fo4).
---
Then monetize the shit out of weapon and armor SKINS. Rainbow 6 Siege does that and is nearly halfway into year freaking 4!
---
Personally I'm hoping for the original R91 Assault Rifle from Fo3. You know, the one featured on all the commando perk cards, but doesn't exist in-game? Just to fuck with us?
---
What are you paying for them?
---
You are right. I would have sworn on my dirty underwear that second card was a three.
---
For me they're "Flying lunch".
---
"Hey, I didn't \*mean\* to hit you with that mini nuke, it just kinda happened. If I didn't, that bloodbug would've given you some nasty blood-borne diseases if it bit you, and the sum of all my medical knowledge says I'm obligated to prevent such a thing from happening to any of my patients."
---
"Gee... thanks..."
---
Plz enlighten me lol I wanna know the more ridiculous downvoted facts.
---
According to this, this states scorchbeast are affected by both hunters and zealots prefixes, is this true or does the great debate of what they are classified as continues?
---
Ive been to several nuked areas over the past week.
---
Wait that's an option? For the record, my friendly cannibal teammate eating my body is not canon.
---
Fixer does double damage of the exp. without alerting absolutely everything that you are there.
---
Actually, I got the Last Bastion chestpiece, so I might mod that. Though I think the mods are broken right now. Thanks, though.
---
Are you serious - they removed the serums in the patch?  I didn't read that, but that's really disappointing.
---
Ultracyte is a anti scorched weapon (50% plus vs scorched)
---
It would be nice for them to introduce a whole knew armor type based on police riot armor. Add a quest line for getting the plans and have it look similar to the ranger armor but with a distinctive Appalachian flavor.  
---
Then they could sell skins in the atom shop for people looking for a nice ranger version.
---
I think its just implied at this point
---
Queue
---
One can hope the raids will be damn tough. I tire of the complaints of people saying the game is 'too ez' and then complain later when nerfs come.
---
i hate that it only has one ear, its not symmetrical ill never ware it
---
DaddyIsStressed is my name I'm mostly on at night
---
It looks like a piece of raider power armor also.
---
That quest was so confusing to me haha. I went around for hours trying to find one.
---
I accidentally discovered this place and was instantly scared because I was lower leveled. Once I explored the island I was disappointed.
---
Im not sure as I missed one egg sadly :(. But I'm thinking maybe you have to claim it from the atomic shop?
---
Would love to see an anti-material rifle, 2-handed sword(s), 25mm or 30mm autocannon, more pistols, and more mods for heavy guns and other neglected ones.
---
It is the answer
---
Sorry we are currently out of stock
---
Go to the front page of this sub (r/fo76). Press the 3 dots button. Then Change User Flair. Then select the desired faction.
---
It's the sheepsquatch. There's also a couple 9f random encounters that you'll either find some dead brahmin with those quills sticking in them or a nest, also with dead brahmin and quills. Sheepsquatch really hates brahmin it seems. I've heard him howling too when I was by one of those nests.
---
True. The Enclave Uniform is probably the most professional looking outfit so far. I would like to see more like that.
---
Wonder if its the same shithead I saw when I playing on my lunch break that was destroying people's camps.
---
Added.
---
That’s where I’m coming from. I’m almost positive you don’t get mutations from rad sources under 5 rads/tick, and prior to patch 8 this was *after* rad reduction. 
---
I found the source for my 5rads threshold, although it’s not definitive. The fandom wiki (fallout.fandom.com) says mutations have a 5% chance per 5rad damage taken to occur. I’m downloading the ESM data mining tool to see if I can find out if that means if it’s under 5rads it should truely be no rads taken, or if the chance simply goes down below that.
---
Good luck!
---
I believe it has lower base damage but higher fire rate than the regular one. Plus the scorched bonus thing. Plus the green lasers look cooler. So yes, but purely because of that last point.
---
In my play since launch, I've only seen Grahm at the makeshift camp in the middle of Morgantown.
---
I've wondered if it's only bash damage that is increased.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/337561/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-april-23-2019?language=en
---
There isn't anything solid yet outside of "maintenance and apply updates".
---
Um nothing off the top of my head unfortunately
---
They must feel very conflicted.
---
Maybe it's only one because it's a smaller island and a low level zone?
---
I honestly have no idea. I was just trying to maximize my usage of land by placing things on the very edge of the camp building zone and at some point it randomly allowed me to place all of my razorgrain inside one another. It has only happened to me twice and I don't know how to replicate it (hence why it would be a pain to fix).
---
Hunt down, kill, the the bounty and immediately log off.
---
Suprised more people didnt see my post on it it got lots of attention but not everyones active everyday
---
Thank you for that. I lost two really good peices not pa but to this glitch. What ever it is
---
It's probably an issue on your end while I used to crash regularly it's pretty rare now. Why system to you play on?
---
We're gonna need a bigger gun.
---
Having capped SPECIAL stats encourages picking a build, like u/taac52 was getting at, so it would be difficult to prioritize more than 2 or so things in a build, e.g. I can spec into crafting, carrying, and a little rifleman/commando stuff, but VATS is gonna be off my list for this character. That said, being able to swap cards around means you still have some wiggle room. For example, lockpicking and hacking like you mentioned aren't used often enough to really justify having three points permanently locked in for those skills. Sure, in a group having one or two people specialized in those things can help cover the people that aren't, but only when the group is playing as a group. I wouldn't wanna be screwed for safe/lockbox loot just because my lockpicker isn't online.
---
Got a 1* chameleon wood right arm from the queen today and yep... Dashboard... Quit game... Haha
---
It was a quick fight but seriously come on
---
I have been able to stack foundations with the atom store metal stairs. It might be possible because I am building into a hillside, so the stacked foundation is considered to be built in the ground.
---
Any news on the issue with Heart of the Enemy, and Breach and Clear not triggering the PSN trophy? I've completed both on multiple characters and no luck yet!
---
i got tons i will sell ya.
---
im at work atm but ill be online bout 5pm today
---
Don't forget about the AWOL event think I've gotten the best stuff there the 3 star at the end almost always drops 2 or 3 star shit
---
What do you think would make it better?
---
Just throw 4 quarters in a jar and stop worrying about it
---
They also need to be harder, I punched it to death with my bare fists
---
It's seriously awkward, and over-all a downgrade from the system from 4, which, until now, was pretty much the worst (in my opinion) to date.
---
*sigh* you're not even making an effort now.
---
I feel we're growing apart, we should down and talk it out.
---
I totally read that as Booty.
---
And greatly increase the level to make it actually challenging
---
It's like the No Homer club
---
There were a few in the Sheepsquatch quest that really drove this home for me. The death by the water of&gt;! the two girls was gross to listen to, and didn't seem necessary. I mean, we found them. We knew what happened to them. Why the final holotape of the actual deaths?!&lt; Also, there was a character I really liked in the quest, which was a huge downer when&gt;! I stepped around the corner and there was his dead body. Which I then had to step over for quest stuff. It was the policeman that was talking into a recorder as if he were narrating a detective story. I had a moment while listening to it thinking, "This character is fun. Maybe we'll hear more of him in other quests." Nope...a few steps later and the Wolf has killed him. :/ He actually even made sense to have more holotapes, cause he actually was recording himself by the canon of the story.!&lt;
---
I just sell serums now, 500 each with Hard Bargain (3).
---
probably a server restart
---
Fallout 76 has unique legendary skins. You buy them on the atomic store dumbie
---
This is normal, it usually happens early in the morning, as a night owl it is not that weird for the server I'm on to shut down for maintenance, probably every other night I'm on for any length over the 4-5 hours after midnight.
---
5pm what timezone
---
I mean, sure, it's nice when people keep adds out of the mash up, and who is gonna say no to a revive. I think part of the problem is that people might not be noticing you doing those things, and just assume you're a useless leech.
---
That, and perhaps they think they can finish you off and steal your junk. 
---
Question tho - doesnt them killing you give them a bounty?
---
Whatever your willing to sell
---
Don’t speak to me or my son ever again.
---
Not sure if it's still this way, but it was mislabeled as Padded for a while.
---
My best legendary from the SBQ is a 1* Junkies Pool Cue!
---
SBQ, Heart of the Swamp, and Encryptid would have been great fights to do it for. Then we could even have level scaling for something like Uranium Fever, so the loot stays relevant even when you're max level.
---
Yes, this is an awful system, takes up the main 'action' part of the screen. I've been annoyed by this for months, glad I'm not the only one. There should be a small display off to one of the sides, towards the bottom. Or something. Anything.
---
This would be so good. 👍
---
Don't worry, it's still pretty to me.
---
The week of yes, that’s why the decorations are always in the games
---
I like it, except for the bit about deathclaw island. It seems like players could make alt characters and just farm a bunch of atom.
---
I noticed a bunch of glowing ghouls at WS earlier today and it hadn't been nuked either.
---
Has nothing to do with my internet or anything. It’s the severs! I’m on the Xbox x and play with many other and they crash as well almost everyday.
---
I did get it to work; explained in the edit. I deleted my custom ini file, but I had to allow Fallout 76 to “make changes to my PC” in order for it to create a new one.
---
I kept my post nuked camp in that condition for a long while, only repairing workbenches. It was cool that people would sometime stop by and offer to repair for me
---
It’s weird however i am not complaining easy xp and also a great way of glowing blood which sells to vendors for a great source of caps
---
I am just saying this topic has been cover many times before with the exact same conclusion.
---
would be a one time quest per account. Not character.
---
The damage scaling is definitely ridiculous. PvP is infinitely more fun when it takes more than 1 shot to kill someone. Really hope with the new batch of legendary rewards in Survival they do something about the PvP damage. Its the only reason I'm not on Survival more often. I just get the legendary reward and leave.
---
Yes! Just like fallout 3, DR, RR, PR, and energy weapon damage! It will be the lynchpin to finally make energy weapons not awful!
---
Nice! Very well done. It would be so cool to get a version of his outfit in the game.
---
You mean like every other patch they've released?
---
We are all entitled to the free atoms the game offers.
---
At this point, you might as well accept the ban
---
That would do the trick
---
Very underrated quote, thanks
---
Full auto uses less ammo per kill as the dps is so much higher!
---
Where is this player market?
---
how do the pc players get so many caps i have been playing on xbox since beta and i only have 45k
---
Pro tip: Wanna look badass, just don't equip a costume. The most badass costume I could come up with was the Brotherhood Engineer with sack with hoses as a helmet (makes you look like scarecrow/bane). Then I realized, heavy variants of armor look more badass on their own.
---
Deathclaw island was kind of a let down, it surprised me but I just swam away and sniped it. It should have had only one good way to get in, be a cage match.
---
Part of the outcast gaming network, but it's been dead af the past couple of months.
---
Good, good. It has to be brought up until something changes.
---
Bless my antiarmor explosive cryolator.
---
Everyday I weep, for it is level 35.
---
Happy Cake!
---
I always try to keep my rads around 50 or 60 percent. Play around with it and see the damage lvl on your weapons change
---
PS4 and over the weekend fissure prime there was a guy same set up. No armor and no name tag in a nuke zone fighting adds and SBQ.
---
The survivalist outfit is my favorite thing on the atomic shop and I love it, the mask is really goofy though. There really does need to be more apocalyptic mask options.
---
Upvote for describing ghoul fighting tactics as a "mosh pit," which is unexpectedly accurate.

Depends... Could be frozen with cryolator, crippled with one gun army (or similar) or glitched. The past few fights Ive had have been 30 minutes of down to the chaos.

Exactly what I think. Beth is trying hard in the Atom Shop to make kids think Fallout is just like their favorite current flavor of the month.

So, it’s been a few hours.  What do think so far?

Change this in your fallout76custom.ini file and add your mods at the end.  
---
You can find this in the "Fallout76.ini" every time there's an update check there if they added anything so copy and paste it into your custom.ini.
---
It's a bug, being patched tomorrow.

The building nechanics are not that bad once you get used to them. I'll paste a link to someone who built a 3 story camp. Hopefully it helps (I didn't bother watching the vid sorry kinda busy atm)

Awesome video.  There is something I don’t understand.  Why do I sometimes go into nuked WhiteSprings and see a players camp?  Shouldn’t it have been destroyed?  Till I saw your video, I was starting to believe that a nuke wouldn’t destroy a camp.  Please ‘splain!

I've noticed this at Charleston station after fast travelling and server hopping trying to spawn the Responder vendor. Clears up after I load an interior space
